as for being polish myself, i was very pleased with it.i used real potatoes made the way we make them old style, and it came out great. a little hint, try adding a little sharp cheese,american cheese,onion,and cream cheese to potatoes next time.it will give flavor.

It keeps getting better....I suggest saving some potato and cheese filling to cover the top layer of noodle and use lots of onion. A layer of fried cabbage doesn't hurt.

I had printed this recipe off in a recent search for a good lasagna.  One day, my husband and I realized that we had what seemed to be nothing to eat in the house.  Both of us being pooped from a long day at work, we didn't have the energy to take that walk to the grocery.  I saw the recipe hanging on the frig and realized we had everything needed.  Altho, heavy this recipe was great.  Luckily the lonely bag of frozen vegetables in the freezer accompanied it well.  

My twist: I added ricotta cheese in with the potato layer.

My family LOVES mashed potatos, and I thought they'd flip for this. It was a no go, so I served the leftovers with fried kielbasa. This kicked it up a bit, and they liked it better. I'm going to use chive-and-onion cream cheese (or garlic) next time.

Quick and easy!!!  I up the onion amout and use a little less butter than called for.  My family liked it much better.  I also spark up the spuds with some dry ranch flavoring or use a little green onion.  I have also added layers of extra-sharp cheddar or kraut.  If you use the kraut, rinse it first to remove some of the salt, then dry or skillet it to add a little crunch.  As for the noodles, I just used a little butter flavor Pam and it does the trick with at least a little less fat.  Use neufchatel for even less and a margarine sub.  works just fine.

Really easy to make and everyone enjoyed it.  Even my fussy eater asked for seconds.
My hubby took left-overs to work and he thought his co-worker was going to eat it on him.  My husband grew up eating polish foods and enjoyed this dish but requests cabbage in it.  I however like it the way it is but might try it with keibasa or bacon some time.  I think a good layer of onions makes this dish great.  I aslo found that the layer of noodles did not cover the entire surface of my pan but it still came out great anyway.  We will have it often in the future as it is so easy to make.

The taste was great.  However, if you don't watch the edges of the noodles, they will become hard and crunchy.

WOW!  We marked this recipe as a "winner".  Very much like pierogies.  I would consider this to be a base recipe.  It's fine as is.  We added a little cheddar, caramelized onions and sauerkraut, and served alongside some Kielbasa.  I think it would be sensational with just some extra butter.  It's a keeper, and we'll be making it again!

I did follow others suggestions and added a can of drained sauerkraut to the middle layer, bacon bits to it and added the onions cooked in butter to the mashed potatoes. I topped it with a layer of the mashed potatoes and added shredded cheddar cheese the last 10 minutes of baking. I couldn't have imagined it would have turned out as good as it did!

This is a clever way to enjoy pasta and potatoes.  I made a few simple modifications that made it a bit healthier and added flavor.  

When cooking the onions I used 2T of olive oil and a 1T of butter.  When I made the potatoes I added a 1T of dried spinach mix and used 3/4 of the cream cheese called for. I made sure it was a lower fat cream cheese too.  I did add garlic salt and some Parmesan cheese to add more interest. 

My favorite variation was at the end of baking.  I finished the dish under the broiler to caramelize the onions.  If you think this recipe looks tasty, I highly recommend this last step.

This was very good, after reading reviews I added a little milk while making the potatoes,also cooked two onions so I could add some to each layer. Last but not least, I cooked up a pound of bacon and crumbled some into each layer. Ummm bacon, is there anything it doesnt go with. :>)

This was so good!!!  My fiance and I had it with sour cream and it was just like perogis.  I used garlic and herb potato flakes instead and made the mistake of using the no pre-cook lasagna noodles....a bit crunchy but that was my fault!  Can't wait to get it right!!!

The only thing I did different was I added some cheddar in with the potato flakes and cream cheese and then topped it off with cheddar and then the onions.  I would make this again.  I like the idea of maybe having it as a side dish with kielbasa though.

My fiance really wanted to try this, so I made if for him one night. First of all the mashed potatos where hard to spread across the noodles.  I kept tearing the noodles.  There were no seasoning listed, so I added some garlic and pepper.  It just turned out bland and neither of us would eat the left overs.

This is an oldie - I add a thin layer of saur kraut on top of the potato layer and it livens it up quite a bit.

This is one of my all time favorite casserole dishes and I'm from the south so we have a lot of them. Like other reviewers, I doubled the onions and saved some of the potato/cheese mxture with a little added milk  to cover the last layer of noodles. Top off with heaping amount of cheddar cheese.

I used oven ready lasagna noodles, after half an hour they still weren't soft enough to eat. There wasn't much flavour to this dish either. I will have to try it again using the noodles that need to be boiled, maybe it will make all the difference in the world! But this dish wasn't very pleasing.

Your lasagna recipe (sent from Heaven) stood on its own and with every bite was amazing.  For the people who wrote that the potatoes were too dry and hard to spread, mine were as creamy as ice cream because I added more water then indicated on the box.  Next time I might try adding some sausage.  But it was the perfect meal served with steamed broccoli.  It might be a mistake to think that this recipe needs more ingredients.

I made this for New Year's Eve dinner for company and people raved and raved. It was ALL gone. I made a few changes and additions though...I used wholemeal lasagna, used low fat cream cheese and added a half cup of low fat cottage cheese to the mashed potatoes as well. I fried up 2 onions, 2 cups of sauerkraut (rinsed and drained) and 10 rashers (slices) of bacon and then layered that on top of the mashed potatoes. It was divine!  My husband who is of very strong Polish heritage loved it... YUM I will make this one again.

Pretty good.  I changed this up a bit and added 2 pounds of ground beef and then layered this.

Use this recipe as a base and add what you feel is best for your pierogi style. With modifications it's a 5 star.  I add fried onions to the potato mixture together with some cheddar and other cheeses, (i.e. parmesan, mozzarella, etc.) Without these cheeses it is not as good and does not taste like the potato and cheese pierogi most people eat. Feel free to add sauerkraut or fried cabbage as a layer.  I make this each year for Christmas eve for my Polish family together with Fried Cabbage with fried onions & a bit of sugar, and Polish Pound Cake.

This was a very tasty dish. A giant perogie! I love how creamy and smooth the cream cheese made the potatoes. Two things I might do next time is 1) double the amount of potatoes...was hard spreading it evenly with such a little amount, and 2) I love the crunchy onion topping, next time I might put that on top of each layer

This is a keeper! I made 3 layers in a smaller pan. I used 2 onions and some rinsed sour kraut and mixed 3/4 of it along with the potatoes. I put the last bit left over on top of the noodles. It was wonderful!! Just like a perogie. Even with putting most the onions and the sour kraut into the potatoes, I still had to add extra milk to make the potatoes creamy enough to spread, as others have said and maybe I added too much extra liquid but hubby said it was one of the best casseroles I've ever made. Thank you for this!

I made this a couple times, but found that when I mix some of the onions in with the potatoes it's even better -- adds flavor to the whole dish.

Good stuff.  I really liked this one, but made a couple additions based on the suggestions of others.  I used a Chive and Onion cream cheese in the potatoes.  I also added a little Sharp Cheddar into the layers, and some on top of the onions, for some kick.  The cooking times were perfect, and the whole dish was a great sucess.  Filling, hearty and savory; a perfect fall/winter lasagna.

I added bacon and cheddar cheese to the potato layer.  I also added a little cheddar cheese on top of onions.  The potatoes need more liquid.  Perhaps some sour cream?  Milk?  They need something.  Next time I will also add more seasonings to the potatoes, salt, pepper, garlic powder maybe.  Lastly, I will add more onions, because the sauteed onion really is what made this dish, and I don't think one onion did the job.  I will definitely make it again, but with the changes I've noted.

I lived in Poland for a few years and I was excited to see this recipe - Perogi Ruskie (with cheese and potatoes) were always my favorite.  Overall, we liked it.  We used fresh potatoes and added a lot of milk to make them thin enough.  I also tripled the amount of onions and it added great flavor.  The only word of caution I would add is to make sure the lasagne noodles are cooked ALL THE WAY before you assemble the casserole.  They really won't cook at all in the oven and there is very little moisture to help soften them up.  We served with sour cream and bacon bits and were really happy with it.

This was soooooo good!!!!  I did tweak it a little.  I put salt, pepper, garlic powder, chedder and mozzerella cheese in the mashed potatoes.  I also added a little extra water, as some had said the middle was dry.  I used some turkey bacon and sauted the onions in the same pan after.  I used olive oil and butter for the onions.  I did use lite cream cheese.  I'm not sure how many calories were saved..hehehe... I put the onions and 1/2 the bacon in the middle and used the rest of the bacon on top.  Of course I topped it off with more cheddar and mozzerella.  DELICIOUS!!!!!  my famliy loved it.  I served it with a green salad, nothing else was needed.  This one is a keeper...

Excellent as a side dish.  When making any type of lasagna I always add an extra layer of noodles directly on top & throw them away afterwards.  It keeps everything else moist.  I served this with keilbasa & cabbage and everyone loved it.  I plan to make this again for a non-polish meal and maybe add some cheddar cheese, bacon & chives.  There's really a lot you can do with this dish.

We enjoyed this meal, but I made it with plenty of additions so I'm not sure what the original recipe would have been rated.  I made the mashed potatoes with baby reds - and left the skins on.  Added green onions and garlic powder to them as well.  Stuck shredded cheddar cheese between the layers, and topped it off with sausage.  Served with sour cream, and once we tasted it, decided it needed a little bit more of something, so we just added Tony Chachere's (Cajun seasoning) for lack of any better ideas.  After all that, yes, this meal is definitely a four!

Why is everyone adding MEAT to a vegtarian dish?  Traditionally, this is a peasant dish and if you really want to capture true Pierogie flavor, use lots of farmer's or mild cheddar cheese into your mashed potatoes; also, mix jullienned, wilted cabbage with the softened cream cheese and add a scattering of sliced sauteed or reconstituted mushrooms, then layer that over the potatoes; more flavor and will keep it from drying out.  Also I sautee the onions separately and top the whole dish off last.

This was a really good recipe!  It's very much like eating one large pierogie.  We add shredded cheddar to the potato and cream cheese mixture to give it a little more taste.  Plan to try adding bacon at some point also.  Very tasty!

I have tinkered with this so many times- but it's good every time.  How could you really mess it up?  I say- take this basic recipe and expand--especially with seasoning.  I have started to layer the onions in each layer- and I personally like a potato layer on top- I dont like the crunchy, chewy noodle that forms on top without a protective barrier.  I've added boursin cheese, cheddar, garlic etc... sooo good!

This recipe was awesome!  I did use 2 onions instead of one and my husband asked me to use 3 next time.  I also sprinkled a little cheddar cheese and some breadcrumbs on top before baking.  This will become a regular in our home.

My hubby said this was just great, I thought so also.  Follow the recipe, except for using garlic mashed potatoes and added a 16 oz, can of kraut to the onions.  Will enjoy the spin-offs that will come next.  Ironically I was looking at the recipe and then my daughter mailed it to me and told me how delish!!!!...she was right.

This was good, but a little bland.  I always try to follow the recipe as written the first time so that my review is of the recipe, not my modifications.  Next time, I will add more onion, some cabbage in with the fried onions... and layer it into the casserole instead of just on top.  In fear of dryness noted by other reviewers, I prepared the mashed potatoes as per the box instructions, including adding the milk. NB: for those who like and use the "no boil" lasagna noodles... that's all I had, SO, BEFORE I started prepping anything else, I put the noodles into a heat-safe dish and poured VERY HOT water over them and let them sit for the entire time I was preparing the rest of the ingredients.  I then used them like cooked noodles and it was perfect!!  A little tweaking and this recipe will be REALLY good, but as a side dish, not a main course, which the name "lasagna" implies.

Pretty tasty! I'll probably add some onions into the potato layers next time, but it's good comfort food, nonetheless. Great take on an old fav.

This is really good and so easy.  I think I will saute extra onions to add in with the potato layers next time.

This was yummy!  I am munching on the leftovers right now!  A few comments though.  First of all - I think this is a great SIDE DISH.  By itself and even served with vegetables on the side - It feels incomplete like you had potato and vegies but no meat....I DONT KNOW!!!  But then - it is so rich that to add more you would really be full.  I agree it needs something as others have said added right to it.  I like it though and I am definitely going to experiment with it - and try other things.  I will watch for suggestions.  Next time - I will try the sausage and the chedder.  I am not sure about the chedder because I like the cream cheese taste and don't want to distract from that - but I will give it some thought!

This recipe was so easy to make and tasted just like pierogies to me!  We loved it! It's heavy, but definitely super easy!  Thank you for sharing this original recipe.  I made it exactly as the directions instructed, with no modifications.

I REALLY enjoyed this!! I love pierogis and this tastes like a giant pierogi.  I added a small amount of cheddar cheese in between the layers, and ate it with some sour cream on the side.  YUM!

Added 1/2 a cabbage with this meal. Very starchy. Would be better as a side dish for sure with meat.

I had to go back to make sure I had not forgotten an ingredient on this one. Some cream or milk along with cheese would have made it very good. Also, it was really bland. I was hoping this would be an easy to dish to throw together for my kids, but not so much. On a side note...I did follow the recipe exactly as written. I'm not the most experienced cook, but I'm pretty sure I did everything right.

I served this as a side dish and actually had to go back to look at the recipe to see if I made a mistake.  We found it bland and pasty and I wouldn't make it again.

I love this as a (make ahead!) side dish. I add the cream cheese before I add the potato flakes, because it incorporates easier in the hot water. As for consistency of your mashed potatoes, I'd say err on the creamier side (add more water or milk) as opposed to stiff, but keep in mind the buttery onions on top add a bit of moisture as well.  I also like to grill portabella  mushrooms as an additional topping to the grilled onions.

WOW!!!! this dish tasted like a pierogi in a casserole.  I was worried about some of the reviews being bland, but all turned out well.  I did use real mashed potatoes and added milk to make them spreadable.  I also added an egg to bind the potatoes, I was worried about not setting up well from the extra milk. that worked out well, too.  I also followed other reviews about top layer being crunchy, so I followed suggestions to add top layer of potato.  I wish I would have added 2nd onion.  I can't wait to make this again when I can get to the polish meat market and pick up some sausage. I will probably be trying a lot of different variations, as they seem to be infinite!

This is one of the best recipes I've tried on this site. I did use my own mashed potatoes instead of the flakes, but I never would have dreamed this one up on my own. Five Stars, Excellent!:)

Growing up in a huge polish community I was used to eating homemade perogies a lot.  Now that I moved away, I don't get them that often.  This is a good substitute for them that takes a fraction of the time to make.  It's really good.  Make sure to have sour cream on hand.

Admittedly, I didn't follow the recipe.  I thought it looked kind of plain, so I made my own mashed potatoes, caramelized some onions, and stuffed some manicotti with it.  It wasn't very good as main dish that way because that's just WAY too much mashed potato for one sitting, so next time I will stuff jumbo shells instead to make more manageable portions and serve it as a side dish.

I made this for the first time a couple of nights ago and everyone just LOVED it!! I will definitely be making this again and again. It's so much easier then making perogies but the taste is pretty much the same; and the variations are endless!

This is real excellent!! My husband made quite a face when I told him this was for dinner...but he was more than happy with the results. I used Betty Crocker Roasted garlic & cheese instant mashed & mixed in the cream cheese & 1/2 cup sour cream. I layed the onions in between the noodles & potato mixture...and added an extra layer of potatoes then sliced mozz on the very top. After baking, I stuck it under the broiler for a few minutes to make the cheese bubbly & give it some color. I also sprinkled with some paprika...it doesn't look appetizing at all, but the taste is FABULOUS!!I will definitely make this one again.

Yummy!  Cooked up two onions for other layers and added a dash of sharp cheddar cheese.  I did use the milk in the mashed potatoes, otherwise it would have been more difficult to spread.  We will saute garlic with the onion next time.  We will certainly make this again.

we enjoyed this recipe. very easy to make, and sure is cheaper than buying frozen pierogis. i did use yukon gold potatoes though, we don't really care for instant. i also used 2 large sweet onions. i made a huge pan of this so we had some leftovers for the next meal.

Loved it. I made this exactly as described and the kids liked it as well. The fat content is a bit too high for me. Getting older and can't tolerate it as much. So I will make this again, just not that often, or cut down on the butter and cream cheese. Thank you for a great recipe.

Absolutely delish!  I added sharp cheddar, American cheese, and sweet onions as suggested by other reviewers.  I also used real potatoes because I like them so much better than potato flakes.  I will definetly make this again.  Thanks for such a yummy recipe!!

This was a big hit. I used about half the butter recommended and it was still very tasty and rich. My kids love pierogies, and this is a great alternative.

I enjoyed this lasagna, but found it a little dry. I would recommend adding extra onions in between the layers, and maybe some bacon for those meat-eaters. Don't forget the sour cream on the side!

This dish was good.  The only problem I had was the process of layering the potatoes.  Since you omit the milk in making the potatoes, they end up very sticky and stiff.  This makes spreading a little difficult.  This is a good base recipe but would be excellent with crumbled bacon, sour cream, cheese, garlic or other things added to it.

This dish is perfect comfort food. I served it as the main dish at lunch and it was quite satisfying. The noodles make it more interesting than straight mashed potatoes and the sauteed onions add flavor. I reduced the butter by almost half, adding a little extra water and the potatoes were moist enough. My only complaint would be that the finished dish is very white and a little bland in appearance. It wouldn't  be a very impressive dish to serve company without some type of garnish. Although I gave this recipe a 4 star rating, my husband said he would give it 5 stars for potential. He suggests adding peppers, chiles, sausage, cheddar cheese or anything else handy.

I thought this recipe would make an interesting side dish to grilled polish sausage but I'm sorry to say that this was not very good.  The flavor was way too colorless to suite our palattes and the texture too dry.

My family sautés onions and adds it to sour krout and does the layers with that. I add pepper to taste (I don't cook with salt). I also add cheese to my mashed potatoes (which are homemade).

This was fantastic. My husband and son said it was just like eating a perogie.  I did make the cream cheese the chive and onion flavor and add a 1/2 cup of sour cream to the potatoes to add a bit of bit to the flavor. I add potatoes to the top 3rd layer of pasta and then added sharp cheddar on top.  Served it with some homemade good ole-fashioned polish sausage.  My husband was in high heaven.

 polish about it? the potato?..i'm going to try to make dumplings with the leftovers..a big dissapointment..thank goodness my wife came home with thai take-out .

This was totally excellent.  I'm Polish and watch my parents make pierogies all my life.  This is a tribute to that hard work.  I think that either you need more noodles and potatos or a smaller baking pan.  What I did was just have two layers of noddles, one on the bottom and one on the top.  I also spinkled rosemary and basil on the potatos and added lots more onions.  I did use instant mashed potatoes & that was fine except they were kind of hard to spread.  I will always, always make this!!

My husband loved this recipe! With a few modifications it was a meal in itself. I added thin sliced kielbasa, sauteed sweet onion, sauteed red pepper and mozzarella to each layer. Yum! I'll make this again.

This was a good base recipe. I added 12 oz of kielbasa sausage with the sweet onion I used while it was sauteeing. I will use another onion next time, this layer was very thin. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon sugar to the onion while it was sauteeing, which definitely helped it carmelize slightly. My final addition was mild cheddar cheese on the top.

This is the first time I've tried a recipe from this site and everyone at my house liked it. I made the mashed potatoes, added a little bit of the flavored instant potatoes, 8 oz. of sour cream, a pound of crumbled bacon, cheddar cheese, and then a little of the cheese over the onions. I also did a thin layer of the potatoes before the onion topping. Thanks for the great idea-I'll be making it again.

I was so excited to make this dish... but was very disappointed in the out come.  The dish was not a total flop, but it just did not jump out at me to make me want to make it again.  Sorry.

This was wonderful. I used cheddar and sour cream flavored mashed potatoes with a splash of milk to make them creamier and easier to spread. I also added a pound of sausage to make it a meal in one for my carnivourous husband. Also being that it's only the two of us I made this in a 8X8 and only ended up using 3 lasagna noodles. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks!

This was interesting.  The overall flavor was good, but there was way too much floating grease from all that butter in the onions, definitely cut that way back.  We loaded this up w/ pepper as we felt it was lacking in spice.  We would make this again in a smaller quantity and use as an accompaniment to a grilled piece of chicken or beef.

The potential for a real "WOW" is there -- it just needs to pop with flavor.  I use lots of fresh mushrooms with the onions, use real mashed potatoes with sour cream and cheddar, and a ricotta/egg layer.  It's rich and not for every day, but it's new hit at Wigilia!

so-so.  We love perogies so I thought we'd like this.  Turned out bland and more like just eating mashed potatoes for a side dish.  Won't make again.

This recipe was really great.  I added cabbage to it and did two onions like other reviews suggested.  I also used four cups of real mashed potatoes and can't imagine it any other way. It is the first dish in a while that my whole family and my grandfather enjoyed.  It tasted good with spaghetti sauce on the side.  My sister also likes ranch dressing with it.  Make sure the noodles are cooked before going into the oven.  The top layer was a little dry.

Wonderful! made it for my sister (she is handicapped and wheelchair doesnt work in the kitchen) and she went wild for it. My Irish bf didnt care for it much, but its the cream cheese that put him off.  I personally love it :) thanks!

Just got done eating this.  It's pretty good.  It seemed a little dry, maybe I messed up on the potatoes.  I did add frozen zucchinni slices and just sauteed those with the onion and the minced garlic (I added the garlic.).  My husband, who is learning how to enjoy vegetarianism enjoyed it and said he was "very impressed." And he is a very picky eater.

I'm giving this 5 stars, but I didn't use instant potatoes, I used real mashed potatoes and topped it with some shredded cheddar. Very good, we had no leftovers!

I thought this was pretty good. I think using potato flakes made it not quite as good as it could've been. I will try it with real potatoes next time & maybe some cheddar cheese too. I think it would have tasted almost like my [Polish] grandma's recipe with real ones. I fried some bacon & crumbled it on top with the onions & served it with fried kielbasa. All in all, very good recipe.

As other reviewers did, we changed up the recipe and it was fabulous!  We made real mashed potatoes, added a pound of bacon, 2 onions, add an extra layer of noodles on the top, it helps with the drying of the noodles.  Thanks so much for a great start to a wonderful recipe.  I'm polish and this is as close to making a Pierogi as it gets without all the work!!

We made this recipe for dinner tonight. Tastes just like a pierogi! Very good. We served it as the main entree, but I think it would be better served as a side dish (needs some meat to go along with it). Again, very good recipe - added it to the "Tried it - Liked It" file.

I made this last night and it turned out great. It tasted just like perogies. I did change the recipe a little from the advice of others. I did add a layer of fried white cabbage and a layer of the potato mixture on top. I also but some chedder and mozzarella cheese in it too. I made some kielbasa on the side from my husband and we both enjoyed the lasagna.

I must have done something wrong with this recipe because it was very dry and bland.  Out of five family members, only one said that she liked it.  

I followed the recipe as written, except I added the milk to the potatoes like some of the others suggested and it was still very dry. Maybe adding extra onions and butter to the layers might help, but the reception was not good at my dinner table, so I will not retry this one.

OH SOOOO GOOD!! My husband and daughters (6 and 3) couldn't get enough.  I did add real bacon and grated cheese as suggested, and I also served it with sour cream, and it really was fantastic.  Now I can't say I'll be making it too often, only because it's not exactly "low fat", but as a special supper now and again, ABSOLUTELY!!!

I took a bit of everyones advice and this turned out excellent.

I made the potatoes including the milk.  Layered as original.

Used three medium onions sauted and a 1/2# bacon of bacon crumbled for the topping.

Served with Kielbaska and corn.  Great comfort food

I had this at a friend's house almost two years ago and have been looking for a recipe since then!  She just told me, "Just add the ingrediaents togather and bake it."  NOT very helpful!  Of course I was thrilled when it came in my Daily recipes from Allrecipes!  Thank you sooo much!

I loved the flavor of this dish, much like a piegori. However, I used the no-boil noodles and it did NOT work in this dish. They were still pretty crunchy at the end of the cooking time. My total mistake. I am going to try this again with the "normal" noodles next time.

This recipe has potential. I added 1/2 pound bacon, crumbled, and about 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese to the potato mixture. My only complaint is that the top layer of noodles were too hard. A nice, quick replacement for perogies.

Very Yummy!  I made this according to the instructions except I used less butter to saute onions, used onion/chive flavored cream cheese and added garlic powder to the potatoes.  and used chedder cheese between layers.  I served it with fried saurkrout (sp) and keilbasa.  Lasagna satisfied my pierogi cravings and was much cheaper than buying the frozen ones.  boyfriend enjoyed this also.

A little too rich for our taste. Tasted like a giant casserole of ultimate mashed potatoes.

my husband and i literally just got done eating this!  it was really good, but the potato was insanely dry!  i added more water, and it was still very hard to spread.  because of the other reviews, i made more of the mashed potato to add an extra layer on top, which i followed with cheese.  i also mixed in my saute(1 and 1/2 white onion, 2 green onion stalks, 1 celery stalk, minced garlic) in the with potato, as well as garlic salt(instead of regular salt), ground pepper, basil, parsley, and dill(loooove dill).  instead of regular cream cheese, i used the chive and onion kind.  if i make this again, i will definately add milk to the potatoes.  they stuck to the roof of both of our mouths!  i may add a layer of kraut, but my husband hates it.  ill just have to sneak it in!

This was ok.  It's a lot of work for what tastes like a "twice baked potato" type casserole.  I used mashed (skins on) baby new potatoes instead of the instant potatoes.  I sauteed the onions in butter with garlic.  I also added 1 cup sour cream, milk, salt, and pepper to the potatoes.  I layered in some sharp cheddar cheese as well.  It did taste similar to peirogies.

This recipe is awesome. I found because their aren't a lot of ingredients, you can mess around with it. I ended up adding 2 pounds of ground beef with some bacon. I also used the suggestion of mixing the cream cheese before adding in the potatoes, and it made everything much easier when it came to mixing.  It is a very hearty dish. I made it for my fiance and myself and reduced the recipe to 4 servings and we still had tons of left overs for the other room mates.  This is definately a recipe I will be using again.  :)

this recipe was awesome! i followed most of the recipe using the cream cheese in the mash patatos. i did grill an onion and mix it with the patatos and on each layer of patato i sprinkled sharp cheddar cheese. i then put more grilled onions on the top and put the rest of the chedar cheese. the flavor was great, like a hug on a plate! thanks so much for the recipe

This was a hit at my house! We love pierogies, but can seldom find them in the store. I misread the recipe, and added the sauteed onions TO the potatoes, which turned out just fine. I topped it a very thin layer of jarred alfredo sauce (just so it wouldn't dry out - you couldn't even taste it, but kept it moist) and lots of shredded cheese. I also added a layer of sliced, smoked sausage to the bottom layer of the casserole, but it would have been just as good without it. Great!

Now, this was good. Not great, but maybe I'm just not used to somewhat bland foods. I liked the simplicity, and it was a good comfort food. What I didnt like was the lack of WOW!! I prepared it with the cabbage like a few others, and I think without it, it would've been boring. No insult to Polish food though.

This was good and had a good tatse to it all thought I would do alot more onions. I also played with this recipe a little like others that reviewed the recipe, I put a little bit of milk, sour cream, and sharp cheddar cheese into the potatoes. I would of liked to mix my onions into the potatoes but my fussy eaters would not of liked it but will try one day. The next time I'm gonna try the cabbage. Will make again. The only problem we had was cutting the noodles and they were cooked all the way? Very good.

Made this last night, with a few changes: increased the amount of onion and added about 1/3 head of shredded cabbage (sauteed with the onion), plus approx. 1/4 cup of caraway seeds. Yum. A big hit!

This is so easy and so good. We, too, used to call this "lazy pierogies". Add some cabbage to the onions and you got "lazy haluski". Maybe you have to be Polish or grow up in the Coal Region (think BLOCK PARTIES!!!) to appreciate this, but it IS worth trying.

Pierogi's are a favorite of my husband and his family. We loved this recipe!  It was much quicker to whip this together than to spend hours making dumplings. I had his mother try it and she was really impressed. I will definately make this again. Next time, for variety, I may add a little ground beef. And my husband would never dream of eating this without sour cream and crumbled bacon as a topper! Thanks for a great, quick substitute for the real thing.

This was a really great recipe - everyone really enjoyed it! I added some real potatoes to the mix, mostly because I had them and needed to use them, but it worked well. My only change for next time is that I will cook the lasagna noodles longer...

We added a bunch of garlic to the potatoes, as well as a BUNCH of cheese, and some sauerkrautto the layers.  It was WAAAAY too gummy without adding milk as well as cream cheese to the potatoes.  And we're VERY into onions, so I more than doubled the onions called for.  I do definitely recommend saving potatoes (or making extra) to spread over the top layer to keep the noodles from crisping.  But we were both impressed with how close it was to actual pierogies, and it will be made again.

This recipe was a hit with me and my partner but I did have to doctor the recipe quite a bit to fit our needs which I think actually made the recipe better. For example, my partner is lactose intolerant so I substituted vegan cream cheese for the cream cheese called for. The vegan cream cheese actually had a nice spice to it which I could still taste after the dish was finished. I really think that if I had stuck to the original recipe it would have been too bland for my tastes. Otherwise an amazing dish! My partner is already asking to have it again.

i followed the directions exactly except I added polish susage, and sarakruat and I  added, chopped mushrooms. I cooked the polish susage, onion, mushrooms and sarakruat together. I drained and rinsed the sarakruat. I layered the onion, polish susage and sarakruat and mushrooms on top of the potato mixture and also put cheese on top of each layer. I will be making it again

This was a fun dish to make!  I had 1/2 carton of sour cream to use up and stirred that in with the cream cheese.  Added drained kraut and boy, this was good.  Play with some seasonings, I did.  Makes a lot and will make again.  Thanks for sharing this one.

Definite comfort food.  We enjoyed it with kapusta.  I did doctor up the potatoes though, adding onion powder, pepper and sharp cheddar cheese.

This is kind of an unusual combo, but I like it. I added shredded cheddar to the potatoes as another reviewer suggested. I used real potatoes. I also used more onions for the topping as someone else suggested.

I gave this two stars not because it didn't taste good, (it was okay)but the execution of this was poor in my opinion. Layering the potatoes between lasagna noodles did not add to this dish in any way. As well, putting the onions on the top noodles just didn't seem right to me, as some said, the top noodles just got hard and crunchy. The mashed potatoes were pretty dry too. It was definitely not a main dish, better off as a side dish.  If I was to make this again (which I probably won't) I would have to include some sour cream to the mashed potatoes, proabably some bacon as well in the layering and mix the onion in with the potatoes instead of on top and I would also probably leave out the lasagna noodles, which pretty much completely changes this recipe.

I made this last week with just the bottom layer of lasagna noodles because of issues with my water supply. My SO and my 1 year old thought it was amazing. I used homemade mashed potatoes. Definitely a keeper.
