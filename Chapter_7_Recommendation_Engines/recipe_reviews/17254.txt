This was really good. I used fresh spinach and mushroom and only used a pinch of salt.

My husband and I really like this. Here's what I do differently:
-I like to use dehydrated onion, because I don't like a lot of crunch (only do 3 Tbsp, I don't know why it's listed twice in the ingredient list).
-This tastes good with either canned or leftover chicken.
-I use raw spinach instead of cooked, and I don't really measure it, I just rip it up and add it in step 2. This also works really well with frozen spinach, because it's a lot faster to break up.
-I use 2 eggs instead of 1, and I cut them up into small pieces and crumble the yolk into the mixture, instead of having it in slices like it shows in the picture.
*Note: I found that this makes enough for 5 slices of bread.
