I made this recipe for a party and it was a big hit!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I have also replaced the shrimp with chicken chunks and it's just as good.

This was different. I don't think I will make it again. Looked pretty. Liked the dressing but something was lacking.

This makes a very elegant, visually pleasing lunch or side salad.  I'd suggest tasting the dressing to see if you want to add a little more honey mustard, to make it a little tangier.

I made this for Mothers Day and it was a huge hit.   I used extra large shrimp and added just a little extra sour cream and honey mustard.

I added seasoned pepper and dill blend to the dressing and it was a great lunch salad. Thanks.

The problem with this recipe is that it does not tell you to start with raw shrimp and saute the in something tasty, like white white and butter and lemon juice....I used cooked shrimp, like the kind for shrimp coctail....the salad was VERY bland...could have been so much tastier if I had thought to cook my own shrimp for flavor.  I don't recommend making this otherwise.
