I saute asparagus all the time, but to make this recipie into a 5* I use olive oil that will not burn so easily, a tbsp. of balsamic vinegar and a tbsp. of minced garlic and don't cover it as it'll get soggy.  I use a teflon frying pan and stir fry/toss it for 3 - 4 minutes.  When it's ready, I sprinkle with fresh grated parmasen cheese, salt and pepper.

The recipe is all right however it forgets to address one major focal point of vegetable cookery. Now of course this is an option and not required however I would first blanch the asparagus because sauteed asparagus has an unattractive brown tint to it.

To blanch; bring a pot of water to a boil and season with salt. Prep a large mixing bowl(size varies on quantity) fill with ice and cold water. Place asparagus in boiling water for about a minute then remove and put in ice. Let it sit for a few minutes and then remove, pat dry - then saute.

Good Luck & more importantly have fun.

With a few minor tweaks this recipe is a total winner. There's no need for 3 tablespoons of butter. 1 and a half was just fine... just enough to coat the asparagus. Also, the cooking time was a bit long. If you like asparagus a bit more firm and crisp, I would reduce the cooking time to about 7 minutes. 10 made it a little too mushy. But I will and have made this many times over

This is so good! The only way I cook asparagus now! It is a helpful hint though: don't leave the asparagus while its cooking! Depending on how thick it is, it could be done rather quickly. Instead, rely on the color: a minute or two after it turns bright bright green and right before it starts to brown is when it is perfect (we like ours semi-crisp). I also add a splash of white wine maybe 1 1/2 minutes before it's done.

I use olive oil in lieu of butter/margarine and, to make it a little quicker/easier, I use garlic from a jar and a dash of sea salt to really bring out the flavor!  One of my favs.

easy and tasty way to prepare asparagus.  I like the change from steamed.  However, a tip when you saute asparagus that wasn't mentioned in the recipe - the smaller (thinner) the stalk the better it is for sauteing.  Larger stalks are better suited for steaming.  And 10 minutes I found much too long, since the butter needs to heat up quite high to saute I think 10 minutes would of burned it or the garlic.  I sauted for 5 minutes.

Used olive oil instead of butter. Chopped asparagus into bite-sized pieces and added a handful of shrimp to the mix. Served with pasta. Quick. Easy. Delicious.

Two stars as written, I'm afraid, but with a few simple adjustments, four stars. First, add the garlic at the end of the cooking time, probably the last 30 seconds to one minute. I can't imagine how the garlic wouldn't burn if added right up front. Second, 1o minutes at medium high heat is probably 5 minutes too long! And I cannot even imagine cooking this an additional 10 minutes after that! Five minutes, on medium heat, adding the garlic at the end, was just right. Finally, this benefits by simple seasoning with salt and pepper and a drizzle of lemon juice to finish.

This review is from hubby.  I do not like asparagus so I couldn't touch the stuff.  On the other hand, hubby ate the entire bunch.  He loved it.  Thanks for the post.

I had never made asparagus before, so was looking for a simple yet tasty recipe. I added 2 ingredients to this recipe; some chopped onion and a sprinkle of instant chicken bouillion. My kids raved about this and want to know when I'm making more! I would rate this recipe higher than a 5 if I could!

Quick, easy and flavorful. I followed the recipe cooking for 10 minutes and the texture was perfect. Asparagus loses its integrity if stored too long, so make sure it's fresh for best results. Store in refrigerator cut ends in a cup of water, or wrap in a wet paper towel and use within 2 days of purchase. Photo available on my profile page.

Way too much butter. I would go for olive oil and even I, a garlic lover, would cut it down. The garlic just burns in the butter.

I’ve made this twice in the last couple of weeks.  The first time, I pretty much followed the recipe as is (except for reducing the butter by half), and it was delicious.  Tonight, I changed it up a bit, and before serving, added couple drizzles of sesame oil and topped it off with some roasted sesame seeds, tossed it all together, and it was delicious!

I've made this a few times and let me tell you..it's great! I usually make it with 1 TBS butter and 2 TBS of olive oil. It always comes out perfect, and it's super easy to make. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I have made this twice now, two different ways. The first time,  i put a touch of soy sauce in with it, and sauteed it in olive oil. The second time, i also used olive oil, but put a touch of honey in the mixture with the soy, and it was so good!! This is going to be a regular with us, thanks !

Just tried this recipe on a whim and the butter cooked away so fast that the garlic started to burn. Left a burnt taste on the asparagus too. I added some salt, pepper, and parmesan like others suggested, and that helped to cover the taste, but I would say go with an olive oil next time to avoid the burning.

Although it had good flavor, you have to be careful using butter as it does burn easily. I would suggest a light drizzle of olive oil with low heat. Also, the lid does make it soggy, leave the lid cracked a bit.

This was a tasty, terrific, easy and fast way to cook asparagus.  I used virgin olive oil to get it cooking, and in the end added the butter.

Great!  My oven was in use so I couldn't roast the asparagus like I normally do.  I used olive oil instead of butter (so much healthier), tossed in a few teaspoons of minced garlic, and squeezed half a lemon over it, then added two slices of lemon before sauteing it all over medium high, covered for most of it, for about 11 minutes.  delicious!  The lemon gives it such a bright flavor.

4 stars with some minor changes. I put the garlic in about 5minutes into it (so it didn't burn). It took about another 5 minutes to get to the crisp-tender state I prefer. I did NOT use 3T butter (more like 1tsp olive oil and 1T butter). And it really was exceptional with a little squeeze of fresh lemon juice... I STRONGLY recommend the lemon juice. Oh, and I happend to have sliced almonds so I threw a few in there for the last 2 minutes to toast a little bit. Ha...am i even reviewing this recipe with all these changes? :) ENJOY!

it's hard to mess up a recipe with three ingredients. 10 minutes is really way too long to cook the asparagus. if you leave it uncovered and cook for about 7 minutes, you're aces. also, a little bit of salt and pepper is pretty important.

Love it!  I made this to go along with Baked Salmon II recipe, and it was delicious!  I made the mistake though, of after taking it off the stove, keeping the lid on, so it still continued to cook and they got a little soggy, but they were still good! I recommend sauteeing for less than 10 minutes, or until bright green, if you like them still crisp like me.  Very good!

This was a good basic recipe. I prefer more seasonings. My husband assisted in cooking this, so I added olive oil with the butter to prevent burning. That didn't help. ****PLEASE make sure you have the heat low enough**** My husband learned a valuable lesson......I am always right when I am in my kitchen! 

  Overall a good recipe, great for a family dinner.

This recipe was excellent, and so easy! Be sure to cut the garlic a little thicker than normal. I did that, and put it in at the beginning of the recipe on Medium heat and it didnt burn. I did use 1lb asparagus and a bit less butter. also, I broke the stalks by hand where they naturally bend, and sprinkled some lemon pepper on the asparagus while cooking. Definitely top with parmesean at the end!

Fantastic alternative to the traditional steamed asparagus covered with butter recipe I was raised on.  

Took the advice of Karen in the comments (April 5, 2007) and sauteed a bunch of asparagus with 1.5 tbsp olive oil, a tsp of basalmic vinegar, and a tsp of garlic for about 5 minutes, then topped with parmesan.  

The asparagus was crisp and the flavors were complimentary without drowning the asparagus.  This recipe will be THE way we cook asparagus from now on.

This recipe is wonderful.  I added salt and pepper and a dipping sauce- mayo with a bit of siracha (spicy red asian sauce).  I covered it while cooking and let it 'burn' a little.  I had to discard the burnt garlic, but the flavor was amazing.  Keep the simple recipes coming!

Have made this a few times.  I agree with other reviewers to sub evoo for half the butter.  My family is nuts for garlic - and this was a great way to spice up asparagus.  Definitely a step up from steamed.

I really liked this. Apparently, I made it twice. The first time didn't go over so well as there was too much browning due to reducing the fat too much and subbing some oil. I do not recommend that. I tried it again the other day and we really enjoyed it as a side dish. The only change I made this time was just going with 2 tblsp of regular butter and 2 cloves of chopped garlic. I wanted to keep within the same ratio. The cooking directions worked perfect this time. It makes 2 large or 4 small servings. The only thing it is only good when just made. The next day the butter bits all over the asparagus and the softer limper texture did not make it very good for leftovers. Definitely make this fresh and enjoy. I used about a medium sized asparagus, if that helps, about a 1/4" thick.

Agree with previous reviewers - when you add the asparagus to the pan, turn it down to medium or med./low, cook for about 5 minutes. Done. Bam! Add a sprinkle of salt & pepper to bring out the flavor.

We eat asparagus this simple delicious way ALL the time!  If you use unsalted butter you may need a sprinkle of salt and I like to add a couple turns of fresh black pepper.  Yummy!

Made this as a side dish with Tilapia. The flavor was fantastic. Asparagus is one of my favorite if not my favorite vegetable to eat, but I never prepared it before. I would not leave it on for 10 minutes on medium heat next time as it did brown quite a bit and the garlic lost that delicious stinky garlic flavor I love so much. 7-8 minutes will probably suffice next time. Other than that, this recipe was right on!

I totally agree with Karen, the other reviewer below.  Her suggestions are fantastic and I will never complain about asparagus tasting blah again! Her ideas about the olive oil and seasonings were spot on -- I definitely recommend that you try her tips the next time that you make this recipe.  I give this recipe a 5 if you make it with Karen's suggestions.

simple and quick. But ten minutes was too long for the asparagus I was using - maybe the stalks were too thin to cook that long.

Flavor was great but cooking times were off.  After only 8 minutes at med/high my garlic was burned and ma asparagus was overdone.  Next time I will cook at a lower temp for less time.

It's easier than steaming, and the garlic gives it just the right amount of extra flavor.  I used cooking spray instead of butter, which seemed to work fine.

Very good recipe! After reading previous reviews I used 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter, instead of just 3 tablespoons of butter and only sauteed it for 8 minutes. 10 minutes would have been way too long! It turned out perfect, tasted amazing, and I highly recommend this recipe!

Great...The second time.... The first time I made as written and the garlic did indeed burn. I should have listened to the other reviewers but I'm pretty stubborn about sticking to the recipe the first time. The second time I used 1 T. butter and 2 T. olive oil and sauteed for only 5 min, adding the garlic after about 3 min and it was perfect!

I have never eaten asparagus that I liked, until now!  It was always overcooked and that nasty brown/green color.  I coooked this exactly per the recipe and made sure not to overcook it.  My whole family loved it.  My husband is now talking about planting asparagus!

Absolutely, amazingly, mouthwatering good! I cut back on the butter a bit and used a little extra virgin olive oil in place of the "missing" butter. I even added an extra clove of garlic, and it was divine!

Made the asparagus as instructed (with minor revisions as noted below). Only 4 stars due to lack of spices, which I felt it really needed to bring out all that asparagus greatness! I used salt and cracked black pepper. Following advice of others, sauteed in half olive oil and half butter and sauteed for about 5 minutes. This was a wonderful recipe, better than steamed as it really kept the crunch. Thank you for posting it. :)

I make this all the time, I do steam it briefly first though. I also use roasted minced garlic, and olive oil as well.  This is also TERRIFIC BBQ'D.

Everyone at dinner loved this.  It was pretty quick, very simple, and made for tender tasty asparagus. Definitely will be making this recipe again soon.

Ill tell everyone this. Do NOT add too much lemon juice. I did a trial and error on this one because ive never cooked asparagus before and i put in way too much lemon juice and they became bitter. I tried the recipe exactly with my remaining asparagus and it was much better :]

Very good! I didnt cover the asparagus while i cooked it because i didnt want it to get soggy and I added an extra couple cloves of garlic (first time i made it I couldnt taste it too much with the 3 cloves) sprinkled it with parmesan when done cooking. My boyfriend loved it! definitely a keeper.

Good and easy recipe. I added salt and pepper after cooking, and it was excellent! I also reduced the cooking time a little to make sure it wasn't soggy.

I HATE ASPARAGUS.  In fact, my brother loved it so much  that he asked for it EVERY year for his birthday.  I also HATED his birthday!!! That being said...I decided to give it a try, what with the grown up taste buds and all.  And....drumroll...it was delicious!!  I sprinkled a teeny dusting of parm cheese on after, and definitely add fresh garlic at the end.  Also used mainly olive oil, with just a tbl of butter for a healthier dish.  My kids loved it too!

Easy and satisfying. I would suggest adding an ample amount of lemon pepper, as the flavor complements the whole thing quite well.

Simple recipe, however the cooking time is pretty long - 10 minutes and the asparagus is moosh.  And I prefer my asparagus in bite sized pieces and al dente.   The best way to know when asparagus is done is when it is bright green.

I made these last night, and served them over a green salad with lettuce, tomato, hard-boiled egg, onion and pine nuts. The asparagus went great with it, I just layed them on the top of the salad.

This is the only way I make my asparagus, with the exception of using olive oil only.  Mine never burns or gets mushy.  I cook the on a low heat after flavoring the oil with the garlic and cook until the crispness that we like.  Anyone who cooks until mushy just doesn't check it while it's cooking.  It's not the recipe's fault.

Only changed "butter only" for a mix of butter and olive oil. Fresh salt, sea or grey finished it off.

This was a wonderful starting point...LOVE the GARLIC!!!  But after reading ANOTHER Asparagus recipe from this site, combined the two (added brown sugar and finished it with some Sesame Seeds) and some other seasonings, it was GREAT!  Also, I agree with others...cooking time is WAY TOO LONG!  I wasn't able to serve mine immediately, so I actually almost "blanched" it in the butter/garlic, and after reheating it a bit it was a PERFECT consisentcy, for us anyway.  Thank you for the recipe!  Will make again (just a wee bit sweeter)  :)

Very nice way to serve asparagus.  The texture was just right and not too much garlic.  1 T of butter and 1 T of olive oil is sufficient for this recipe.  10 minutes is perfect cooking time.  Thanks for sharing.

I haven't found an asparagus recipe yet that I haven't liked.  I LOVE asparagus so this earned 5 stars just because of that.  But because my son liked it and he is not a fan of asparagus, this deserves extra points.  The cooking method is just as simple as steaming it, but the garlic flavor was an extra bonus.  One change I did make, I always saute with olive oil instead of butter (it's better for you).  Thanks!

This recipe is great as is. The only change I make is to swap EVOO for the butter when I have guests that prefer olive oil.

Enjoyed the recipe.  Made sure to cut off the bottom 1 1/2 to 2 inches of the tough part of the asparagus.  Also used a pan that was already greased from olive oil and flavored with garlic and other additional spices when browning a tenderloin before going into the oven.  I do not like my asparagus to be too tender and the sautéing gives an excellent opportunity to control the crispness of the vegetable.  This recipe gave me great idea in a pinch.

I used half butter and half olive oil and waited to add the garlic until half way cooked and the garlic still browned too much.  Did also add alittle bit of lemon to help keep the color(as many had mentioned in their reviews) and it did but it took away from the asparagus taste. At the end I had to add some Parmesan, it was too bland for us.  I'm giving a 3 because it's better than steamed but other than that I would have given it a 2.  There are just too many other great ways to make it and with more flavor.

So simple and so satisfying.  I don't cover the asparagus, and just use butter, garlic and a little salt.  I can't say I've timed the cooking - but it comes out perfect every time.  Truly a great preparation for my very favorite vegetable.

Read a lot of reviews before I made this...cut mine into 1 1/2 inch pieces used half the butter for 8 mins. 
First...my garlic did not burn and It was finely minced....4 cloves. Second, the asparagus did not need to be blanched it came out perfectly crisp and beautifully green.....thanks for a great recipe...will try adding wine, soy or lemon juice as others suggested for variation. So quick,  easy and delicious.

This was very good. I can't get my kids to try many new vegetables...but they loved these, even my 5 and 7 yr old gobbled these up. I did use olive oil instead of butter though and sprinkled them with sea salt. Very good.

Saute is the way, however for a bunch of fresh asapargus I use 2 tablespoons of garlic butter - it's quicker.  I only cook 10 minutes because I like it firmer.

Love it.  There is no need to blanch the asparagus first (as one mentioned).  It came out perfect just as instructed.  I did however add just a touch of Sea Salt and White Pepper.  Delicious!

I have been cooking asparagus this way for years and love it.  Really simple.  Try it sauteed in olive oil also.

Elegant and delicious.  For the most delicate texture and best taste, choose the skinniest asparagus you can find.  Wonderful; thank you!

We really loved this asparagus.  I love asparagus any way, but my husband does not.  He said this was the best asparagus he had ever eaten. Even my picky 12yr old ate it, but he says he likes it a little saltier. :-)  We will definitely having this again.

I have always loved asparagus at the restaurant but never been able to make them like that.  Ahhhhh these are just like the fancy restaurants.  This recipe is so easy to make. They are so yummy. i tried with butter and olive oil.  Both are great.

Very good, very quick and easy. No salt necessary. However, end result is VERY tender asparagus. So, if you like your asparagus a little crunchier, reduce the cook time.

Yum. I just needed a basic recipe for asparagus and this worked perfectly. I wouldn't go much longer than 10 minutes because it started to shrivel.

Tastes almost fried.  My boyfriend who doesn't like asparagus likes this recipe.  Once you've made this recipe, you'll always remember it.  And for me, this is the only way I'll make asparagus in the future.  Keep in mind the thickness of your asparagus spears though.  I'd opt for a thinner spear.  But if you can only find a thick spear just saute it longer. Also, I do not cover the pan.

Another tasty sauteed asparagus recipe. I made to recipe according to the directions, but will make again using half olive oil, half butter.  The garlic did turn quite brown, so would add it in half way while cooking.

This was AMAZING. This was my first time making asparagus and I wasn't too sure about how it would turn out. Luckily it turned out great. I did take the advice of some of the other users and subsituted oil for the butter and added the garlic in at the end.

I love asparagus and never imagined you could sautee it. I have cooked this the way the recipe calls and then using some of the tips of reviewers. I like the advice of using the olive oil instead of butter. I added white wine near the end and I only sauteed it for 5-7 min. I do like my veges more crisp and gardenlike. I love this recipe and my boyfriend now cooks it this way in his home for his kids. Thank you for the recipe.

This is a GREAT recipe that I've used many times. It's quick and easy. Although, I do cook them less then 10 mins. because it like them more firm. It's a PERFECT dish with the broiled talapia parmasan on this site.

Use Olive Oil instead of butter for a healthier version... I find garlic burns too fast so I used garlic powder and kosher salt.  To make it go better with my italian dinner grated parm at the end was the perfect answer.

I substituted the butter with olive oil but with the medium high heat you have to be rotating them very often otherwise they burn. Next time I will add the sea salt as someone else mentioned. I cooked them uncovered for lack of big enough lid for around 8-10 minutes and they still came out soggy but thats the way I like them. Very yummy. Will make again.

I made this as a side to pasta and salad and it looked and tasted great.
ALTERATIONS: I added a little salt and lemon juice midway through cooking for a little zing. 
ADVICE: Be careful not to overcook - I agree, 7 or 8 minutes is probably adequate otherwise can go a bit squishy!

So easy and great tasting. I made this for my vegan friend and used 2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil in replace of the butter.

Great recipe.  I substitute olive oil for the butter without measuring.  I also throw in onions.  My husband who doesn't really care for asparagus loves this recipe.

I got to eat 2 spears. My husband wolfed down the rest of the bunch. I'd say this was a good recipe. I cooked the stalks w/a combo of butter and olive oil. Yummy!

Instead of butter I used olive oil. This added some great health benefits and gave the dish a more robust flavor. Also sprinkled a little salt and pepper.

I used half butter, half evoo and added generous amounts of salt and pepper.  The asparagus came out perfectly crispy-tender, just the way I like it.  For an asparagus recipe, this one is good and easy to make.  You need to keep your heat down though.

Sometimes the most simple recipes are the best tasting!  I added a bit of sea salt, fresh cracked pepper and used dry minced garlic.  They turned out delicious and my taste buds were anything but bored!

I'm glad I tried this recipe, it was very tasty.  Although, I'll have to agree with other members about the incorrect cooking time and temperature.  The first time I made this it burned a little. On the second try I reduced the cooking temp. to med low, and it came out much better.

This was not as flavorful as I had hoped for.  I only cooked mine for the 10 minutes it said in the recipe, but the asparagus was overcooked for my taste.  It was extremely easy and fast, but quite plain to me.

Made this to go with a turkey dinner, and it was very good. Next time I'll add some white wine, that sounds extra-yummy! We might not have let it go the full ten minutes, and next time I'll make sure to go at least 12, because I like my asparagus less than crunchy.

Tried this tonight. I added salt & pepper and used olive oil and just a touch of butter. 10 minutes is way too long. It came out tasty but brown and soggy. I think I will stick to steamed.

AMAZING. The only change I made was used mostly olive oil with a dab of butter to make it healthier. The husband said it was the best asparagus he ever had!

Perfect timing for the asparagus.  It turned out crisp.  We used white asparagus instead (which you need to run over with a peeler) and was just right.  Also splashed soy sauce while sautéing.  It was quick, easy, and flavorful.

Very easy.  Because I live at a high altitude where it takes longer to cook, I partially steamed the asparagus first, then finished it with this recipe.  I only used a 1.5 T mixture of butter and olive oil and would recommend that over using 3 T of butter.  After a little salt and pepper were added, it was perfect.

I did these again with not such skinny asparagus and they turned out great.  I did not cover them though as my hubby has made it clear he likes crunchy asparagus.

So simple! So delicious... like others said, leave in longer if you prefer not so crisp asparagus.

I used olive oil instead of butter. Otherwise, I loved this. My friends ate all of them. I bought 2 bunches of asparagus and between the 5 of us, they were all eaten! :)

i do not like asparagus and this is the only way i'll eat it. i've been doing this forever, but what i usually do is use a mixture of butter and olive oil, then i add the zest of one lemon (or more, depending on how much i'm making) a few minutes before i take it off the heat to serve. delicious!

My new favorite way to prepare asparagus! So simple, and yet so delicious. I just cut the asparagus stalks in half for easier handling, and use an equal mix of melted butter/olive oil (eyeballing for approximate amount, just enough to coat the stalks). I saute them in the pan for 5-8 minutes since I like them more on the done side with a slight crunch, and then add generous amounts of garlic and red pepper flakes towards the end, then saute for another 30-60 seconds. Perfect!

I substituted 1T of the butter with EVOO like others had recommended.  But even at 6 mins, the stalks were too soggy for my liking.  Next time, I don't think I'll cover them and see how it goes.

I don't know why I didn't think of something so simple, but this was great. I always steam my asparagus, but looking for something different, I found this. Thanks for sharing. I might try some white wine next time like some of the others said, but it's also great just as is.

Perhaps I misunderstood some portion of this recipe? I opted for the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic version with a saute time of approximately 8 minutes. My asparagus was fairly thin so it shouldn't have taken more cooking time than that. In the end, however, I found it to be stringy, chewy and without the expected flavor! I opted to bake the asparagus for another 10+ minutes at 400 degrees and that helped somewhat. But, still stringy with very little flavor! In the future, I will return to boiling or baking my asparagus and using a combo of melted butter and balsamic vinegar as a drizzle or a dip for the spears.

I loved the taste of the garlic with the asparagus.  I had to substitute olive oil for butter because of dietary needs but would have loved to try it with the butter.  Very simple and tasty.

In a family of asparagus lovers, this is now a unanimous favorite.  I substitute olive oil, with only a little butter for flavor.  Then sprinkle a little sea salt on the asparagus when serviing.

Wonderfull!  I hate asparagus but my husband loves it.  I didn't know how to prepare it, but even my kids ate it which was a real suprise!  It works good in the broiler to if you need the stove top space.

This is a good change up but both my wife and I like asparagus steamed and just a littl bit crunchy better than sauteed. Thanks for posting.

Yum.  I made a double batch for 4 because we all love asparagus.  Very simple and easy but a great mild taste to compliment any type of meat.  Thanks!

At medium high heat the garlic burned, and the asparagus was a bit soggy, due to being covered.

I thought this recipe was delish, but I would suggest only cooking them for 5-7 minutes...they got really soggy when I cooked them for 10.  I usually prefer asparagus to be crunchy.

I think this is made for fatter spears because my bunch were pretty thin and they overcooked in the first 10 minutes. Just got really mushy. I'd start with 5 minutes and go from there.

Must be careful not to get it overdone (in my opinion). Anything over 10 min (at least on my stove) would be way too much. If you add balsamic as another reviewer suggests, do that at the end. We like it roasted a lot more which is why this only gets 3 from me.  Okay, but not the best way to fix it.

I hate Asparagus, so obviously I don't make it often, and my husband loves it.  He says I don't know how to fix it right.  So I made this last night for him, and he said it was the BEST I have ever made.  Thanks, as it was even easy.

This is an excellent way to cook asparagus. I added a chopped shallot along with the garlic towards the end. And seasoned with creole seasoning. Everyone loved it.

I like to saute this in clarified butter (ghee) it is butter that has had the milk solids removed so its dairy free, and it is suited to higher heat cooking.  When you remove the milk solids it doesnt burn easily like when your normally try to cook on a higher heat.  I like the taste of the butter much more than the flavor other oils on my asparagus.

I used less butter than called for because it was all that I had (maybe a little over two tablespoons.) It was still way too much! The asparagus cooked way too quickly -- some of it burned before the ten minutes. This recipe left the asparagus soggy. I would probably never use this again.

I loved this recipe!  I am always looking for recipies I can make my own and this went very well with a couple of baked salmon dijon filets I covered with no salt seasoning, dijon mustard and then covered in seasoned bread crumbs I made earlier in the week mixed with a little melted butter.  I seasoned my pan with olive oil first.  I have found this to be useful in just about any recipe calling for sauteed or pan seared processes.  I sauteed in basil butter I had made from an earlier recipe and added baby portabella mushrooms very thinly sliced.  Also, I cooked for 15 minutes at medium heat.  Asparagus was still green and crisp while mushrooms were well cooked.  Plates licked clean.  :)

I actually steamed the asparagus in the saute pan for about 5 min. with the garlic.  Then poured out any left over water and added butter, olive oil and sea salt and sauteed it for about 5 more min.  Garlic was left while sauteed with other ingredients.  Turned out perfect.

VERY easy recipe and it adds a great taste to the asparagus.  Quick to prepare.  Enjoyed the flavor of the garlic - I added a little salt because I used a non-salted butter.

I had some nice thin asparagus to use and this recipe was great!  Everyone loved it.  I needed to make this dairy free so I used about 1 TBSP of olive oil instead of the butter and I added a generous amount of minced garlic.  I can't wait to make this again.

Good garlic and buttery taste. And I like that you don't get that stringy texture that you sometimes get with asparagus. But the flavor just doesn't pop like my soy + balsamic recipe.  While good, this recipe will always be second rate.

Asparagus is one of my favorite veggies. I used garlic powder instead of cloves because it was a last minute fix, sprinkled parmesean cheese and sauteed on low with the lid on for about 15 minutes. Tasted great!

great, easy to make, side dish. i put in a little more garlic than the recipe called for, simply because i like a stronger flavour. and i used less butter to make it even healthier.

Great recipe but a little bland.  A few tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and some salt took it to five stars.  Also, the asparagus was ready in 10 minutes.  Ten more minutes and it would've been mush!

Excellent.  I prepared this to accompany Barbequed Pork ribs, Mashed Potatoes and Buttermilk Biscuits.  If you allow the garlic to cook with the melted butter in the cast iron(in my case), it melds with the butter to provide a mild, almost sweet garlic flavor that goes very well with a bold main dish, such as ribs.  also, do not forget to trim and peel(if necessary) the asparagus, to prevent it from being tough at one end.

This was pretty good! My husband is not the biggest fan of veggies and he said they "weren't bad". I liked them! I made them just as the recipe stated except per other users suggestions I sauteed them in olive oil.

What an easy and quick way to prepare asparagus.  And was it every yummy!  I did cook the asparagus before hand to make it crisp tender and then quick sauteed it.  Topped it off with some grated parmesan.  Will definitely be making this one again.

We enjoyed this recipe although it didn't taste very different that our typical roasted asparagus in the oven, but it's definitely a good option when the oven is full.

This turned out very well, and went great with the pork tenderloin I served it with. I only used about 2 tbsp of light country crock butter, and I also added a shallot with the garlic. Very good, will make again!

Wow! First asparagus of the season-and this was wonderful! I added a squeeze (1 Tbsp?)of fresh lemon juice just as they were finishing up.  Tastes like spring to me!

I used just 1 clove of garlic, 1.5 tbs butter and cooked about 10 mins and was excellent. Added a good sprinkle of sea salt at the end.

Yummy! I used 3 Tbsp. of olive oil. I added the chopped garlic halfway through the cooking. Sprinkled with salt on the way to the table. Even my picky eaters liked it.

Excellent! I like asparagus but rarely cook it. Had to find a recipe for Xmas cuz my sister likes it. This was so easy, and everyone raved about it!! Followed the popular suggestions, using butter and olive oil, stir-fry and toss for 6-8 minutes, and garlic from the jar. It was amazing!!

SO SIMPLE AND SO PLEASING! I am allll about flavor, and this dish has it. I took others advice and used EVOO for half of what it called for the butter. I added more garlic bc I have a garlic addiction, dash of salt bc I used unsalted butter...but all in all, this is a FANTASTIC way to make asparagus!!!

I have made this recipe several times and will continue to do so.  I make just a few changes.  I use olive oil instead of butter and I cut each asparagus spear into 3.  This made it more kid friendly and be easier for my kids to eat - for whatever reason they eat more when I cut it up then when I serve whole spears.  Watch the cooking time if you cut the spears up - they cook and bit faster.  Overall this is an easy and nice tasting recipe.

Loved this recipe.  Used 1 TBSP olive oil and 2 TBSP butter as the other reviews suggested.  I didn't need 10 minutes though....the garlic was starting to burn and the asparagus tasted done after 5 minutes.  Went great with the Grilled Marinated Swordfish....definitely make again.

this is my FIRST time making asparagus and my husband and i just loved it!!  the only reason i gave it 4-stars is b-cuz i changed some things according to the reviews.  i used reduced the butter and added EVOO so not to burn the butter/garlic.  covering it did make it a bit mushier than i preferred so next time i'll leave it uncovered and cook it for about 5-7 minutes instead!  overall, asparagus will now be a staple food in our house =)

This is the best way to cook asparagus if you don't like it mushy.  I used 2 Tbsp of butter and 1 Tbsp of olive oil to keep it from burning.  Instead of chopped garlic, I used garlic salt, along with lemon pepper and lemon juice.  I had some sliced mushrooms, so I sauteed them for a few minutes on medium heat, then added the asparagus, which I had broken in half.  I stir-fried it without timing it, and when it was still bright green, I tasted several pieces and they were perfect - tender but still slightly crisp. I am going to be eating more asparagus now that I have found a great way to cook it.

I gave this recipe a 4 simply because I've adjusted it a little. I only use about 1 1/2 tbsp of butter (enough to coat the asparagus) and I use 2 cubes of crushed frozen garlic that I get at my grocery store (they are fabulous...1 cube = 1 clove of garlic). I let the butter and garlic melt together in the pan before adding the asparagus so the flavors have a chance to mingle (sooo yummy). I don't cover my asparagus as I like it to have a little crunch to it. I then saute it until it's color turns bright green (toss it often in the pan to get all sides of the asparagus the same bright green color)this should only take a few minutes. I also crack a little black pepper on the asaparagus while it's cooking. My family always requests asparagus this way and it's the only way I've been able to get my kids to eat it (they love it like this)!

Tasted good, but I will cut back on the butter a little next time, and also reduce the heat to medium (med-high burnt some of the garlic).

This recipe was a really great starting point. I ended up using 1 tbsp of butter and about 1 tsp of prepared minced garlic, which I sauteed with the asparagus for about 5 minutes. I then added some sea salt and fresh squeezed lemon. I cooked for another couple of minutes(to the crispness I liked), then served with a little bit more fresh lemon. Delicious!

I used olive oil instead, like others suggested.  I would reduce the amount of olive oil by 1/2 next time though, as it makes the asparagus more oily than that amount of butter would.

Awesome!  This is how I usually prepare asparagus.  Fast and easy!  I didn't have fresh garlic so I used minced - still very tasty.  Also, I usually top it off with Kraft's grated 3 cheese blend.  Wow!  Of course, remember that the skinnier the asparagus stalks the better!  They're nice and tender crisp.

So simple, yet so delicious! I never would have thought to prepare my asparagus this way, but it's much better than just steaming it!

I liked this, but I'd cut the butter down next time.  It was a little too greasy. The garlic provided a really great flavor and my dinner guest complimented the fact that no extra seasoning was needed. As the garlic cooks, it caramelizes and it really sets the asparagus off.  All you need to do is add a little salt to this right when you add the asparagus and garlic to the pan and you are done. I will try this technique next with broccoli as others suggested.

This was simple and easy.  I took the advices from the other reviewers and used only a small amount of olive oil (just enough to cover the pan) and added balsamic vinegar to the ingredient.  It was absolutely delicious.  We loved it...it was so good that everyone just finished it all.  NO leftovers.

Too much butter in this recipe. The flavor was okay, but cooking it for as long as the recipe calls for (the least amount of time) makes the asparagus too soft and mushy.

Oh so good! I use olive oil to cut down on the fat. Steamed broccoli can be substituted for the asparagus, and it's just as delicious.

Very easy and very good! I took the advice of others and used 2 T. olive oil and 1 T. butter and sprinkled w/ parmesan. Such a quick and easy way to fix asparagus. I love the simplicity!

I halved the recipe for my hubby and myself. When the spears weren't completely burnt, they were quite soggy. I would say reduce the cooking time no matter what, and reduce it DRASTICALLY if you're going to reduce the recipe.

UPDATE:  It's been 1 1/2 years since I first tried this recipe and it is the only way we serve asparagus as a side dish now.  All our friends and family do it this way too.  Having grown up in the same city as the submitter, I was compelled to try this and am so glad I did.  DELICIOUS!  I always make hollandaise sauce for my asparagus, but not anymore.  I too will cut the amount of butter in half next time.

Wow! Who would have thought such a simplistic recipe could add so much flavor.  Probably not the healthiest way to prepare a vegtable, but if you are going to splurge...add the parmasean cheese, it's out of this world!

This was very yummy! It was my first time cooking asparagus and it was a little softer than I'd probably like it. I'll cut down the cooking time next time and also use a tad less butter. There was definitely more than needed. I threw some slivered almonds into the pan with everything after 5 or so minutes of cooking and they were delicious!

Thanks for a quick and easy way to serve aparagus, Dartanyun. I imagine cooking time is determined most by the number and girth of the spears you are cooking. I adjusted and got a 
tender-crisp, well flavored and delicious side dish. Oh yes, I did cut the butter in half.

Used olive oil instead of butter, added salt & pepper.  Still a little bland.  You do need to stir them pretty much constantly or they will burn!

I am not a huge asparagus fan, but I thought the addition of garlic would make it taste better.  I found that sauteeing covered resulted in some of the asparagus being overcooked and some being undercooked.  You could probably stir it more, but that's hard to do with 7 inch pieces of veggies!  I substituted olive oil and kosher salt for the butter/margarine, but I can't see that butter would have improved this a lot.  The asparagus was still edible, but it did not bowl me over.  I think I will try steaming and tossing with minced garlic, lemon juice and olive oil next time.

I didn't think the asparagus gained much flaver from the garlic & Butter. Maybe if it was marinated? Either way, asparagus is good, flavored or plain!

Just the taste I was looking for.  Only needed to cook for 5 minutes because we like our asparagus crunchy.  Used about half the amount of butter that was originally specified.  Will make again.

i was taken back by others reviews saying it was bland, as i found it to be not that way at all.  it was very good.  the only thing i did different, which was not intentional, was i actually forgot about the oil and had put butter in to cook it with, well country crock.  i loved eating the cooked garlic. mmm mmm good.

This is delicious. I like my asparagus really crisp so I only cooked it about 8 minutes and that was just right, then seasoned with salt and pepper after cooking. I love the browned garlic, that's the best part!

Ten minute cooking time was a little off here. Used more evoo than butter and because we like our asparagus tender crisp, I gave them a quick stir fry rather than covering the skillet. Good tho and thanks!

This is the best way I have ever found to cook asparagus! Simple to the max and yet elegant enough for company.  It works well with broccoli too; just shorten the cooking time to 5 minutes. I tried olive oil instead of butter and it was just as good. Enjoy!

The asparagus was so delicious that both my daughter and nephew could not stop eating it. Will make it again and again.  (Be sure to check after 10 minutes.  The second time I made this I left the asparagus in the covered pan too long and it almost burned.)

For ease plus wonderful taste, this recipe can't be beat.  I prepared this for asparagus-loving guests and they raved about it.  I added a few sprinkles of salt before serving and cooked it about 8 minutes.  Will definitely be preparing asparagus this way again.

Made this recipe to go with Easter dinner, except I used olive oil instead of the butter and cooked for a bit longer to get a softer asparagus.  It was a big hit at Easter.
Thank you for sharing.

This was the worst asparagus dish I've ever made.  It was soggy, overdone and lacked flavor.  Look at all the other great asparagus recipes on this site before using this one!

I had never tried fresh asparagus before I made this receipe (only pickled- which turned me off of asparagus all together).  However my husband enjoys it so I decided to be nice and make it for part of our Valentines Day meal.  I definitely like asparagus prepared this way!

I boiled the asparagus until almost done (we like ours firm, so thick stalks took about 5 minutes) then tossed them with the garlic butter.  Added liberal pinches of salt and pepper.  I took another reviewer's advice and tried this recipe with fresh green beans - equally delicious.

I modified this by using greenbeans instead.  Also, the medium high heat was excessive, as it burned the garlic.  Next time, lower heat setting.  Overall good idea.  =)

We loved this!  It is so easy to do and it is better than eating plain steamed asparagus.  The garlic was just right to give it enough flavor to say yum!

The asparagus was easy, quick, and delicious.  Although, next time I won't cook it quite as long.  I cooked it about 13 minutes as my asparagus was frozen, but it still ended up pretty limp.

I had high hopes for this quick recipe, however was disappointed with the outcome.  I found the asparagus to be tough and fibrous, although it had a good flavor.  The high price of asparagus makes it hard for me to want to try this again, I will probably go back to steaming.

Really enjoyed this asparagus dish. Make sure you are evenly sauteeing the asparagus else it will burn, but found that a little burn tasted great.

Very good, simple to execute and tasty results. I agree with some of the reviews in that 3 TBSP of butter is a bit much, and 10 minutes is a bit long, but overall, a simple and tasty way to serve fresh asparagus.

It was excellent!  I did add grated pecorino Romano cheese at the end after taking it off the heat. Excellent.

This is a great way to fix asparagus. Quick and easy.  I saute mine in 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  When it is bright green I add 1 cup of chicken broth, turn the heat down and let is cook until  done. (Note:  I do not like raw veggies so I cook mine for about 10 minutes).

10 min on med-high heat was WAY TOO LONG.  The bunch in my covered frying pan was burnt at 8 min.  But I et it. It was ok.

I made this asparagus recipe according to instructions and did not blanch, wasn't necessary, used unsalted butter, minced garlic, 2 tsp and pepper, turned out perfectly soft and tasty. Thank you for sharing.

This recipe didn't work for us. I think it's important to note the cook time is going to differ significantly depending on the thickness of your asparagus. We use the color of the asparagus and a fork test to determine if it's cooked to our preference. With that said, there's likely no issue with the total cook time of the asparagus as some people prefer it more soft vs. firm. The same applies to the amount of butter. This was way too much butter for us using medium/average thick asparagus. I never thought I would say this, but the flavor of the butter here was too much for the asparagus. If I try this again, I would use less than 1/2 the butter called for or just use a little olive oil instead of the butter. The amount of garlic was fine though, but we do like garlic! :)

I blanched asparagus pieces for 2 min then transferred to an ice bath.I used butter (1 tblsp ) and olive oil. Sauteed the drained pieces for about 7-8 min when they were at the tender-crisp texture I was looking for. Just before they were finished, I added jarred garlic and some small, cooked shrimp. Topped with a little good quality balsamic vinegar and small amount of parmesan cheese. This was an excellent one-dish dinner tonight! Good starting point for a great recipe!

The asparagus and garlic are burning in the pan, the asparagus is not cooked, 2 minutes to go and had to open the windows from the smoke. I highly doubt we should add the garlic from the beginning or that the temperature should be medium high. Thanks for ruining it.

First time cooking asparagus, and it turned out quite well. I followed the tip to blanch it first, and now I'm just waiting for it to get tender enough to gobble down. Yumm!

Really good way to cook asparagus.  I used butter the first time I made it, but now have decided to use olive oil instead.  No burning of butter and garlic. Easy to do on the grill too

I used my Tupperware Micro Pro Grill and did this in the microwave.  I added some grape tomatos as well.  It was so good.  Cook about 5 mins turn and 5 mins more depending on how you like it cooked.

I used this as my base recipe since I decided while I was cooking that I wanted shrimp too lol. It turned out wonderful. I didn't have fresh garlic so I used onion powder and then sautéed some shrimp with it. Turned out pretty good.

It was delicious. However I did boil it for about 3 minutes to ensure it wasn't too rigid. Of course, I didn't have fresh garlic so I used garlic salt. It was still amazing. This was my first time making asparagus and eating it.  I definitely will do again!

10 minutes was definitely too long, some of them were overcooked and I stopped at 7 minutes. Also very bland needs more seasonings.

I loved this recipe -- I will cook asparagus this way much more often. It was really easy and very tasty! I discovered for a more crispier texture - which my son and I both think is great -- almost like french fries -- you saute them longer in olive oil and butter on medium high heat, lightly salt and eat away. The garlic is a little dark in color but not burned and I'm good with that. Never liked asparagus much before now.

I have made this for years. It tastes great. I have learned a few things though. We prefer ours sauteed in a garlic infused olive oil, a little sea salt and pepper. When done, we like to sprinkle a little grated Parmesan on top. 

To those that say ten minutes is to long....It really just depends on the size of the stalk. A thin stalk may only take a few minutes, while a thick stalk will of course take longer. It also depends on the tenderness you prefer. I like mine with just a little crispness to it, while one of my boys likes his very tender, ALMOST to the point of mush. Go figure!

For this recipe, I  also added some minced white onion (about 1 tablespoon) and it was delicious. I will make it again, but will likely  substitute olive oil for the butter.

Do your best to find the freshest, local, and organic produce- it makes a huge difference in the results in taste and quality.  Also, there is no mention of how to snap the tough end of the asparagus stalk off and this is simple and perfect, if done correctly- holding one, with both hands , gently snap it allowing it to bend and break at the spot where the tender end meets the tough portion , which no one likes to eat.  They can be composted, thrown out for wildlife, or kept if one likes to create stock from such pieces saved in the refrigerator.  Also, there is no need for covering this nor cooking asparagus for more than several minutes, to achieve the most desirable results of tender, hot, yet leaving it with a bit of crispness left.  I even like it raw!  Blanching it seems extreme as well, as one reviewer discussed, and would not do this.  In addition to the garlic, which is extremely great in this, use the best quality of ground mixed pepper corns as well as freshly ground sea salt, or Himalayan Salt which is NOT expensive for the benefits; also there are options for using good quality olive oil, or butter, or coconut oil....it should never reach a high temperature nor be left alone, as you are continuous stirring ,gently turning each piece which will allow it cook more easily without taking much time.

Love it!  Followed the recipe as is and let it sit for the extra 10 minutes.  My husband likes soft asparagus and i like mine a little crunchy,  but I've never seen a green vegetable dissappear so fast. It was delicious and suser easy!  Will definitely save for the future :)

Did a revision.  I happened to have the drippings and the olive oil in which I cooked a pound of Italian sausage links.  I puncture them with a fork while they cook in about 3T of olive oil. The flavor from the sausage gets into the oil.  I added about 1T of butter for flavor.  I agree that to get crisp asparagus, my preference cooking 7-8 minutes is better. After cooking the asparagus, I sprinkled Parmesan cheese over it. Yum

Add Cherry Tomatoes..... I make this recipe all the time but use EVOO as others have suggested.  Sauteeing the cherry tomatoes just until they are about to explode and serving it with the 'gus is fantastic. Your family and friends will be very impressed.  Strain off a bit of the oil so you don't get puddles on your plates

I would never use butter and definitely always blanch my asparagus before I sautee it as I do my broccoli too. A twist of sea salt is all you need and it is delicious.

I made this as a side dish for a Valentine's Day dinner. I was easy to make considering I've never cooked asparagus before.  I covered the skillet to steam it a few minutues after sauteeing, but be sure not to over cook them as they get soggy. Tasted great. My six year old loved it.

Best Asparagus recipe ever! I have found that fresh garlic cloves are nicer than jarred minced garlic, but fresh tastes weaker (although the breath indicates otherwise). Thanks!

I used 1 tablespoon of butter, and added about 1/4 cup of italian dressing to spice it up a bit. Chopped 1 bunch of asparagus into about 1" pieces, added about 1/4 cup thinly sliced onion, and about 5 cloves of diced garlic. I sauteed  it and then added some real bacon bits and topped it off with shredded italian cheese. Great basic recipe, but I prefer a bit more flavor. Great side dish! Thanks!

Fantastic! I did what another person suggested---I blanched the asparagus first, then cooked according to recipe for only 7 minutes with a lid on the skillet.  My family, including in-laws, loved it! I made it again tonight!

I love asparagus and I'm always looking for different ways to cook it. This was a great recipe; it was seasoned just right. The only thing is I cooked it just a little less because my asparagus was kind of skinny.

I will be adding a clove of garlic next time. I put the finished asparagus on a plate and poured the sauce over it. WOW! The chopped garlic was so goos. This will be a repeat for many meals.

Simple and delicious.  I only used 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter - that was plenty!  Added a pinch of salt and cooked for about 8 minutes so it was still firm and crispy, the way we like it.

My family did not enjoy this at all.  I am trying to incorporate   more variety of veggies in our diet and this one missed the mark!  We found it to taste very grassy and could not taste the butter or garlic flavors.  I followed the recipe except I only cooked it covered for about 6 minutes so it wouldn't get soggy.

Really yummy and quite easy to make. I peeled the rough bottom of the asparagus with a vegetable peeler. I used a combination of extra virgin olive oil and light smart balance margarine to get a great "buttery" taste. I added salt and pepper to it! Beautiful color!~

I tried to make it last night and it's very good. I used 2 table spoons of olive oil instead of butter or margarine. Add chopped dried chilli. And, it only needs less than 10 minutes to cook it... I will try to make again next time

Decided to try this on a whim tonight after buying some fresh asparagus tonight and was quite disappointed. It just tasted like butter no garlic and I put extra garlic on as well - texture/cooking time was right but I found of the garlic stayed in the pan.  Didnt read reviews/changes curious to see them now.

Very good guidelines for cooking asparagus. I like mine cooked and 10 mins is plenty, just a hint of crunch left. Of course, this is a guideline. Salt and pepper to taste and even a bit of fresh grated parmesan makes these to die for. :)

This was great.  I sauteed Olive Oil and a tbsp of margerine with garlic and onions for about 3-4 min and added the Asparagus (canned) and it turned out wonderful.  I usually do not care for Asparagus but my husband and I ate every last bit.   Thanks for this one...:)

This was a great starting point.  I steamed the asparagus and blanched them. Then I mixed in some whole wheat penne to add some texture it made a complete side dish.

Easy and good. I used frozen asparagus spears and cooked them in the bag in the micro. I then put them in a serving dish with the butter and garlic and heated another 2 minutes to melt the butter.

We tried this recipe tonight because I'm trying to find new vegetables for finace to try. He's a picky eater and doesn't like too many vegetables. I added parmesan cheese on top and it was very tasty. He seemed to think it was "okay" although he did eat it!

Pretty good - I didn't cover, and cooked it for probably close to 15 minutes. Added a little sea salt, and my husband and I both enjoyed it. A nice change from steamed asparagus, though it was kind of greasy, and that was after cutting the butter in half.

This recipe is amazing!!!  I also had the problem with the ingredients wanting to burn (I cooked it no longer than 6-7 mins) and I took them out probably 30 seconds later than I should have. They were still crunchy (I love them that way, I hate mushy asparagus). Next time (I will only cook asparagus this way in the future) I will boil the asparagus for a minute or two to soften them up, so I won't have to saute them too long and worry about the burn taste. I halved the butter with EVOO and added a splash of lemon juice and balsamic vinegar after it had cooked for a few minutes. Thank you for such an amazing recipe!!

I'm so glad I chose this simple recipe over other, more glamorous-sounding recipes for my first foray into farmers market fresh asparagus. I added a splash of white wine, fresh chives, and pine nuts. Mmmm. And after some patient simmering, voila! Perfection!

This was my first time cooking asparagus & my family love it. I gave it four stars because I had to work it the recipe. I didn't have whole garlic, so I used garlic powder. I also used some lemon pepper season, added olive oil and cut the butter. I will be preparing this dish agian.

I used the advise from other reviews and used olive oil.  I let the oil, garlic and olives cook for a little while then added the asparagus and let it cook for about 10 minutes.  It turned out great.  My husband can't wait for me to make it again!

I have never fixed fresh asparagus before and this was absolutely delicious.  My husband said that it was so much better than the canned stuff.  I won't be buying the canned stuff anymore.  I will diffidently be making this recipe often.  It is so easy to do.  I did take others suggestions to not cook it for the full ten minutes.

long time lurker and HUGE allrecipes fan. I figured as long as I was logged in to add some of "your" suggestions b4 I printed... I'd write too.

Very good easy. Took suggestions of less butter, added a splash of balsamic and used sesame oil (sprinkled with sesame).  I was hoping to go with the cheese/red pepper flakes- but went "oriental" (or asian?) instead.

This is great!  I added about 1/8 cup of water to the pan because the butters goes fast.  And I also used garlic powder instead of cloves.  I chopped mine into thirds and put the bigger pieces in the pan first so that the tops wouldn't be too soft and mushy.  One more thing that i did was sprinkle some of those fake low fat bacon bits over them.  My asparagus was awesome!  I was looking for a good recipe for my husband to try it because he has never had asparagus.  I know he will love this one as much as i did.

The asparagus was cooked well, but the garlic was way overcooked.  Sauteeing garlic for 10 minutes burned it and gives it a terrible flavor.  I would make this again because it's simple and easy, but I'd definitely wait until the last few minutes to put in the garlic.

I used olive oil instead of butter. I like my asparagus well-done, so I covered and simmered then in 1/4 cup of rice vinegar (for some tang) for an extra 10 minutes after the sautee. Garnished with salted peanuts. Delicious!

Got rave reviews at the Thanksgiving dinner I took these to.  I used olive oil, and added balsamic vinegar at the end.  The second time I added the vinegar plus some parmesan cheese and it was even better.  Yum!

Absolutely DELICIOUS. I also added tofu to cook with the mix and served over rice. Even my picky 3 year old ate every bite! Yummy!

Typically I will make asparagus by simply coating the asparagus with olive oil spray, sprinkling with seasoning and searing it in a hot pan or grill until it browns.  I wanted to try something different this time, so I tried this recipe.  First, I switched to olive oil instead of butter, and I reduced it by almost half.  Even so, I found the asparagus to be way too greasy and overcooked.  I like sauteeing asparagus in general, but I don't like it this wilted and soggy, so I will stick with my usual recipe.

I loved this- so tasty and easy!  I subbed one TBS of butter for oil.  Loved eating the sauteed garlic with the asparagus.  Good recipe to have on hand.

I think next time I will try leaving them uncovered, as they were soggy instead of crisp as I could have liked.  Good flavor, but soggy and stringy.  I will definitely try it again uncovered.  The flavors were great.
Update: this time I followed some tips and cooked them for only 7 minutes.  I still covered them.  They were perfect.

This is the best asparagus I've ever had! I did add a little balsamic vinegar and thought it was great. Great recipe - good, fast, and easy!

I used Extra-Virgin Olive Oil and maybe I should have used plain Olive Oil instead since I think it doesn't burn as fast.  My garlic started to burn before my asparagus was done.  This is a good recipe and very easy, therefore, it's a keeper.  My family doesn't like asparagus but it's my favorite and I always saute it like this.  Fast, easy and delicious!

Flavorful without swamping the asparagus taste. I only used 2 tsbp. margarine and cooked it for only about 5 minutes. I also added some salt and pepper which turned out great. Will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks!

This is a great side dish. Just the right flavor, I did use a splash of lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. It did the trick for me and my dinner guest. Everybody’s plate was clean and so was the serving plate it was on. Thanks Dartanyun.

This was my first time trying sauteed asparagus. I think I prefer it roasted (the way I usually prepare it). The garlic was really good though! Thanks for the idea to try something new.

This was okay. Nothing special. I halved the butter, and I am so glad that I did! When I tried it, I knew it needed something so I added salt and some soy sauce. I think next time I make this I'm going to add some soy sauce to the skillet or maybe lemon juice.

My normal recipe for asparagus includes garlic parsley and lemon, so this recipe was not that big of a twist.

I used olive oil instead of butter and only sauteed it for about 5 minutes otherwise it gets too soggy.  I also added some cilantro as per my husband;s request.  I also threw in some cherry tomatoes to add more veggies for dinner.  I also sprinkled some lime on it at the dinner table because I love lemon/lime on almost anything.

This was pretty good although I agree that you don't need anywhere near as much butter as the recipe called for.  I only cooked the asparagus for about 7 min.  I would make this again and use garlic powder so I can get more of the garlic flavor in every bite.

I think this was too much butter for the asparagus. Mine were pretty oily, but the flavor was good. Next time I'll either use way less butter, or I'll use olive oil.

Not great..but pretty good.  Asparagus became MOOSH when cooked for as long as instructed in recipe so I suggest half the length of time.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this recipe with baby broccoli instead.  I think it's also called Broccoli Aspurus or something like that?  Like a smaller broccoli with long stem.  Wonderful dish!

We are not big asparagus fans.  But we doesn't love butter and garlic!  I agree with the previous posters that the cooking times are too long.  It could also be cause my asparagus was thin.  Overall we enjoyed it.  Thanks

Great and easy recipe.  I also added white cooking wine as suggested by another reviewer and would agree that the recipe turned out GREAT!  I also didn't sautee for 10 full minutes because the asparagus was cooked after about 6 -7 minutes.

I made this with dinner tonight and it was really good.  It wasn't too much garlic and the butter really accented it nicely.  I was worried about over cooking it so so I used low-medium heat and cooked it for longer.  Thanks for posting, I really look forward to making this again.  Whee.. veggies rule!

This is very good! I added a little white wine and some vegetable seasoning, and I actually cooked this on my George Forman instead of sauteeing in a pan.  I will definitely be making this easy recipe again soon!

The butter will burn easily so I added a little wine and also some prosciutto.  I think blanching the asparagus first then tossing in the butter mixture for about 5 minutes works best for us because we prefer them semi-crisp.

I have never tried asparagus before but my husband loves it. I was pleasantly suprised I liked it and so did he. He did find it a little bland. I guess next time I will add some more season.

We loved this recipe. If you like the yummy garlic/butter flavor of shrimp scampi, you'll love this dish. It's so easy to make; we added a sprinkle of coarse kosher salt and freshly cracked pepper. I think you could easily reduce the amount of butter and still have the same great flavor. We'll definitely make this one again.

So yummy and a nice change from the steamed way.  I sauteed for 15 minutes because I like my asparagus soft.  Thanks for the simply and tasty side dish.

This was incredible! I melted the butter with a little olive oil and only cooked about 7 minutes...I like asparagus more on the firm side. But this is definately a keeper! Thanks for sharing it!

Way too mcuh garlic.  It made the entire house smell like garlic and it overwhelmed the taste.  I recommend using half of what is called for to start until you see what I mean.

I used olive oil instead of butter and I think I could have used less.  It also had less garlic taste than I expected.  But good.

cooked at med-high heat as suggested.  butter started to burn at 8 minutes (suggested 10 minute cook time).  I was standing right there and watching it or else it would have been ruined.  tastes good.  kinda plain.

The first few bites were great, but then it started to get a little bitter. I also added some salt to help with the flavor. Not my favorite, but it was okay.

The perfect asparagus.  Super simple and tastier than anything else I have tried.  I used garlic from a jar and it turned out great.  I love it when you can dazzle in the kitchen with as little effort as this!

My husband and I do our own variation of this recipe, which involves lightly coating the asparagus with olive oil and topping with chopped garlic.  We then put it on the grill and cook until it gets a little crispy on the ends.  Very delicious!

Quite tasty.  I used olive oil instead of butter and I think it could have used more garlic.  But it was pretty good.  My husband and my daughter didn't like it, but I did, so what do they know?!  I will make it again, but just for me!  Thanks for sharing.

My husband and I have never cooked Asparagus and chose this recipe to be our first attempt.  We loved it.  I think I put too much butter so next time I will lessen the amount that I put.  I added more than what was said. Other than my own mistake, EXCELLENT!

This recipe tastes great and is sooo simple! I've also tried the recipe with broccoli instead of asparagus and that was good also.

Simple, delicious and FAST!  I usually roast asparagus, but we really enjoyed it sauteed in butter. Yum.

I have never eaten asparagus before and I really wanted to try it and so I went to my favorite place all recipes.com to find the best recipe that I could and boy did I ever. Even my husband who can be very picky and my 14 and 11 year old daughter liked it my other two children would not give it a chance. I will how ever cook it less time next time. I cooked it about 20 minutes and that was almost too long. I took the advice of another person and added sea salt and boy am I glad I did. The aroma while cooking was to die for. Thank You for this wonderful recipe. I tell everyone about this website and they probablly get sick of hearing about it but this site is the bomb as kids would say!

Excellent! I added a tiny bit of lemon juice to it. Fabulous! I served it with the Parmesan Tilapia and Long Grain & Wild Rice. Once again, EXCELLENT!

growing up, we always had the "vegetable stand-bys"...peas, carrots, green beans, corn.  I wanted something different...and this was delicious (for our own taste, I will cut back on the butter or maybe use olive oil).

I love that this recipe because it's so easy. Who doesn't have butter and garlic in their kitchen? I like my asparagus a little more tender, so i looked for about 15 minutes, total. This was great, will definately make again.
