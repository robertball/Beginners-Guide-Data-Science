This is one of the best ways I like to do chicken, except on the grill.  I like it alot more than pineapple or apple chicken.  I used homemade strawberry jam instead of the apricot jam.  Will make this again!

I prepared this for dinner and thought it was excellent. The only substitution I made was to use red wine vinegar. For such a simple recipe, it is a great result. I love the flavor of the blueberries when you bite into them in this recipe.

I thought it was good.  My picky husband and three kids didn't want to try the blueberry sauce, but I thought it was very interesting.  It's worth noting that the chicken is quite good without it as well.  I will say that when I added the vinegar (cider), the aroma was very overpowering so be prepared.

Very, very good.  It's also good with strawberry preserves instead of the apricot!

Really good and really fast!  We loved it and didn't change a thing except for using sugar free apricot preserves.

I was hesitant to try this, but it was AMAZING! It tasted gourmet, but was very simple to make! I didn't have dijon mustard, so I used classic yellow with a touch of cayenne for heat. I didn't use the full 1/3 c of white wine vinegar based on other reviews, but I thought the sauce was wonderful and don't think 1/3 c would be too much. I served this with asparagus and a side salad of spinach, feta, and pecans over which I poured the extra sauce. Everything paired so well together, my boyfriend was blown away! I will definitely make this again, especially for anyone I'm trying to impress!

LOVE this recipe! I was looking for a way to use up some fresh blueberries. This filled the bill perfectly! A few reviewers didn't like the vinegar, so I used slightly less than called for in the recipe (1/4 cup instead of 1/3), but it was fine and I think would have been perfectly good with the original amount. The tanginess of the vinegar and mustard was nicely balanced by the sweetness of the fruit. I didn't have apricot preserves, so I used raspberry and strawberry preserves. I also added about 1/2 cup water while simmering the chicken, because it seemed too thick with no liquid. It turned out perfectly. This is a unique dish, very easy and delicious!

Too much vinegar!  It was too strong for the other ingredients in the sauce.  I even used the preserves (strawberry instead of apricot), but the vinegar taste was too much.  I ended up picking the blueberries out of the sauce and eating those w/the chicken.  My husband and daughter did not like it at all.

Yum Yum! I don't know why, but I was craving a combination of blueberries and chicken for a week, and your ideas made the perfect meal. I used mashed peaches and apple cider vinager, and I chose to bake it without the oil to avoid fat, but it worked fabulously!

I really liked this, but my husband didn't care for it. The mustard, vinegar and preserves combine to create a really unique flavor. I served over couscous.

Loved this recipe.  The sauce is more tangy than sweet, and when you bite into a blueberry, what a wonderful combination of flavors.  A keeper.

For the short list of ingredients, this was delicious enough to warrant 5 stars!  I was doubtful, but the unlikely choice of ingredients melds together perfectly somehow.  And it's so very easy, to boot!  Followed the recipe exactly, using 1 tb wholegrain Dijon and 2 tb smooth Dijon; whether this added anything I do not know.  I am not sure what the purpose is of removing the chicken before you add the vinegar.  I overlooked a few small pieces in the pot and they tasted exactly the same post-vinegar as the ones I removed so I may omit that step next time.  Thanks very much Thomas!

I loved loved loved this dish!! I made it exactly as written and it turned out so delicious! Reminds of another recipe I love to make called Fruity Baked Chicken. The vinegar adds a wonderful element. Served it will Garlic Kale and rice.

This was delicious, quick and easy!!!  The perfect combination.  I followed the recipe as directed, using the white wine vinegar.  At first I thought it was going to be too much, but it turned out perfectly.  I may try this will cherries and berry preserves over pork chops next.

Made for the first time this week.  My husband and I both loved the flavor.  Did use red wine vinegar in place of cider.  Will definitely make again, but would like to try it with just fruit preserves.

We really liked this recipe. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts because that is what I had on hand. Instead of adding less vinegar I used about a tablespoon bit more, but used wine vinegar. I did this because I wanted more blueberries in the sauce. We didn't find it too tart at all and actually because of the extra blueberries I could have added more vinegar. We tend to like sweet tart foods. All in all it was very easy to make and I will most likely make it again.

This has interesting flavors - my family loved it; I made the recepe exactly as it is - I prepared in the morning and reheated gently for dinner - next time I would add the blueberries at the last minute as some of them popped;  I sliced the chicken into fairly thick pieces and served over rice.  Simple and delicious!

We thought it was just OK. The blueberries give it unique flavor, but not really a memorable dish.

excellent recipe.  I followed as directed and thought the vinegar amt was fine.  I used spicy brown mustard and red rasberry preserve as I did not have the other.  Easy to make.  This is a keeper.

This amazing recipe actually tempted me into cooking for just me! I never cook for myself although I like to cook for my family when they come to visit! Wow! I will make this for the whole clan next time they are in town! Really delicious due to the tart and sweet combined! I would not change a thing unless it would be to add a few walnuts for crunch!

I made this for my family tonight -although I found the recipe a bit strange.  WOW- it was absolutely awesome.  I used a peach brandy conserve and I did cut down on the vinegar as one reviewer suggested.  I could not believe how good it was.  I have been asked by my crew to put it into the usual rotation and they are pretty discerning critics.  Great recipe!!!!

Decided to try this recipe to use up some blueberries.  It was just ok.  I used white wine vinegar and it overpowered the entire dish.  I may make this again but would substitute regular white wine for the vinegar.

The sauce is too strong if 1/3 cup of cider vinegar is used. It completely dominates the other flavors. Perhaps the sauce is fine with 1/3 of white wine vinegar, but I can't bring myself to make it again.
