This was fabulous! I have a go-to spaetzle recipe, but I thought I'd give this version a shot, and I now have a new favorite! It's so flavorful, not to mention much easier to work with, with my spaetzle maker. I omitted the salt, and added a dash of garlic powder. Thanks for the recipe!!

Delicious!!  I did add a pinch of garlic powder and a bit of thyme, as well as the other spices.  Added it to the chicken soup in my slow cooker and the family loved it.  If you do this, add a bit more liquid to the chicken soup, as the spaetzle will continue to absorb the liquid.

We enjoyed it. I cut the portions back to two but used 2 whole eggs. To compensate for more egg I cut the water back to a 1/2 cup. I warmed some butter in a skillet and tossed the spaetzle in that before serving.

Batter turned out fine and was thick, but when I spooned them out of the boiling water they were very limp. When they cooled I touched one and it just smeared. What did I do wrong?
