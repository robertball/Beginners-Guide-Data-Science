Wow what a great recipe this is a game changer for me! This site has many great lasagna recipes and I have made quite a few! Using the parmigiana and bechamel in the recipe created a very light creamy feel to it that is so different than using ricotta and mozzarella! We loved the bolognese sauce it is so flavorful and delicious! Yes I did make the pasta noodles and yes it is true that I am a mere novice and this was the first time I added spinach to a pasta. It was harder for me than I expected but I just worked the dough until it was the elasticity I am familiar with adding flour as I went. In the end I made a presentable pasta next time around I might make them ahead of time. This is a labor of love and the end product delivered!
