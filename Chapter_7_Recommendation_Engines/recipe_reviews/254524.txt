I made this sauce last night and served it over zucchini noodles as I am on the paleo diet. Can I just say, that was the best spaghetti I have ever eaten!

This was easy and quick to make and it turned out very tasty. Even though the ingredients list seems long, it really isn't since a lot of them are repeated. Good recipe.

I have never made spaghetti sauce before and this one was quick, easy and delicious. The only adaptation I made was that I did not add the meat to the sauce. I just added the Cumin to the vegetables and made meatballs on the side. I also did not add the hot sauce as we do not like it, but it still packed a good punch. With early prep, I threw it together start to finish in about 20 minutes. I will be making it again.

Delicious but I cooked the sausage with onions and garlic and then added the other ingredients in a crock pot and cooked for 7 hours it was so yummy
