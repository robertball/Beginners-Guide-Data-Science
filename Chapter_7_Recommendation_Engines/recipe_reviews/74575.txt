I have not tried this recipe yet but I've had smoothies just like it and they were delicious! Try substituting sweetened and condensed milk for the milk.

This is a great way to use all the frozen fruit in my fridge! You can even omit the ice if you use frozen fruit. Play with the proportions if you prefer to have it more smoothie like. I added a splash of vanilla for additional flavor.

This recipe was just what I was looking for, it was perfect! I used strawberry flavored yogurt. And I added half a banana to sweeten it up a bit because it was a little sour with all that pineapple. I will definitely make this one all the time!

I would have give it the extra star but i think that if you would have added a bit more strawberries it would taste more fruity 
Still a great recipe .

This was very good!
i served it at a party and my friends liked it. It was really thick though, and we had to use spoons. Im assuming thats becuase we used ice cream insted of yogurt though.

I agree with a couple of reviewers who noted there is too much frozen fruit and too little milk - I have a powerful Vita-Mix and still this didn't want to blend witbout adding more milk - and I didn't even add the ice. Beyond that, it was neither flavorful enough nor sweet enough. Hubs liked it but then he didn't know how I had to play with it.

Delicious! We couldn't find frosen pineapples, so we used mangos instead. Even though I spilled a lot of it, the smoothie I WAS able to eat was fantastic.

This one's hard to rate as it doesn't scale well. I didn't need four servings, I only wanted to make one. It's hard to get a smoothie to blend with only 2 tablespoons of milk, so I added some extra which ended up thinning it down quite a bit. I wouldn't recommend it unless you are making the full four servings it's written for.

It was just ok for us. We didn't add extra ice, because of the frozen fruit. It was so thick, that we used spoons. I found it a bit on the tart side.

Delicious flavour, but very thick, almost like soft ice cream. I added some extra milk and then it was great. A good way to get some extra calcium into those non-milk-drinkers in your house. Thanks!

Cool, sweet and refreshing. I used fresh strawberries and canned pineapple chunks. Didn't need any sugar, was sweet enough.

One of the best smoothies I ever had. I love the pineapple flavoring. It makes it taste so sweet. The only thing is I didn't have any strawberries so I add mix berries  with strawberry yogurt.

Very refreshing summer smoothie! I did add a bit more pineapple and strawberries because you couldn't taste much of that in it at first.

Delicious summer treat.  We didn't have any yogurt in the house, so we made instant vanilla pudding and substituted equal amounts instead of yogurt.  We only used strawberries.  Delicious all by itself.

Great Smoothie.  I didn't use anything frozen (except the ice) and it was great.  Fresh strawberries and canned pineapple made this so quick and easy and super yummy.

This was easy, quick to make and simple is always good. Only thing I will do next time is just try different fruits. Also I used fresh strawberries and canned pineapple but the consistency was still satisfactory.

This smoothie did not turn out well at all!!!!!!!! I could've made a better one. I followed the directions perfectly but when i tasted it it was flavorless and quite runny. I ended up throwing it back in the blender and adding more sugar and more ice!!!

This tasted wonderful, but I will not be making this again.  I have a "thing" about pulp in drinks--I hate it.  And the pineapple when blended, shreds and creates little stringy bits.  I could not find frozen, so I used canned, which possibly could be the cause, but I'm not convinced frozen would've been better. Because this is totally my issue, and the taste was good, I gave it 4 stars.   You've inspired me to use pineapple juice and pineapple flavored yogurt with strawberry smoothies in the future, just not whole pineapple.

Really yummy! Some may want to add a little more sugar if they don't like a bit of a soury-pineappley taste - I do like it though. I used fresh pineapple and strawberries, and a 1/2 cup of low fat soy milk and it was great. I also used more strawberries that what is called for. :) Yum

This was great! I actually used canned pineapple and strawberry preserves, blended with plan yogurt, a teaspoon or so of sugar, and milk. I imagine it would be even better with frozen fruit, since you could cut down on the ice (which can water it down a bit) while still getting the thick and frothy consistency. Regardless, really refreshing!

Tasted great. I added some pineapple juice too and some extra ice to make it not as thick. Next time, I'd add more milk too.

We did not have frozen pineapple, so I used a small can of pineapple juice.  Did not use milk or ice.  It was delish!

I really liked this smoothie.  It used my two favorite fruits, strawberries and pineapple.  I also add half a banana that needed to be used up.  It was very filling and I'll definitely be making it again.

Yummy! I used vanilla fat free yogurt. I didn't have frozen pineapple so I used canned and added a little of the juice too! I will definitely make this one again.

This was very yummy!  I used Splenda instead of sugar b/c for the morning no added sugar needs to be in my diet.  I used a little vanilla, and used vanilla yogurt because it is my favorite.  It was pretty thick with the frosen strawberries so I added a little extra milk & no ice. YUMMY!

the recipe is better if you don't use the yogurt and use a little more milk

Very good! Instead of 1 1/2 cups of the same kind of yogurt, I used 1 cup each of peach and strawberry yogurt.

It was amazing, but I would use a little less yogurt. To me, the flavor of the yogurt was really prominent and kind of blocked out the flavors of the other ingredients. I also used 2 cups of strawberries instead of 1 1/2.

This is a hard recipe to rate. As written, maybe 2 stars because even with a Vitamix, it was impossible to mix without the ice even. However, I did scale the recipe down to 1 serving, so perhaps it was too low in the container to blend properly. I added a little more milk (almond milk is what I used) and no ice, and it was absolutely delicious...5 star quality. It has a refreshing, fresh taste sure to quench any thirst and satisfy completely.

I didn't use any sugar or ice.  I didn't have milk so used half and half; used Brown Cow Whole Milk (cream on top) Vanilla yogurt.   This was very thick (probably because I didn't add ice) and tasted much like a strawberry malt.  I will make again without the ice but might add a little bit of sugar
