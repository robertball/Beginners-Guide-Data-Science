very good! Did not use the amount of sugar called for--kind of chickened out for fear that it would be sweet, but it is not--it adds a subtle quality that makes for great eating. Also, used fresh basil, doubled the quantity, did not have garlic salt, so I used powder and regular salt--all of these details doesn't change the overall effect of the dish. Shows well, the sugar glazing adds a golden appearance. Very much recommend this. You can tell it is written by someone that understands that salmon needs only augmentation, and this treatment does just that.

I've had much better salmon. The flavors were odd together (my husband and I usually like a sweet glaze) and not at all appealing. The vinegar was strong, and in my opinion, doesn't belong with a subtle tasting fish. I will not make this again. It ruined a perfectly good filet. I recommend "Baked Dijon Salmon" instead.

Yummy! My picky, "Don't let that fish touch my steak!" boyfriend even admitted this was good. Sweet and tangy at the same time. Adds flavor without overwhelming the salmon. Use fresh basil (~2 Tbs) for best flavor. Garlic salt is unnecessary. Just add some salt and more garlic!

Used this marinade on some sockeye salmon filets and then BBQ'd them.  The marinade is excellent on salmon-- the sweetness seems to go perfectly with the fatiness of the fish!  I used balsamic vinegar because I didn't have any red wine ving. and it turned out fine.

Salmon is one of our favorite healthy foods.  I enjoy preparing this recipe with asparagus and rice pilaf for accompaniments. For the final touch,I use a lemon sauce drizzled over both the salmon and asparagus. It is a beautiful presentation.

This was delicious.  I like things a little sweeter and thought the sugar added a nice subtle flavor.  Very good and we didn't have to marinate it forever!

This recipe has an excellent sweet flavor in the after taste.  Don't be afraid to be liberal with the sugar.  I also added about 1/2 a tsp of lemon pepper and used a few extra cloves of garlic.  I don't have a grill, so I put a little oil on a skillet and grilled it up like that.

Delicious! I used the broiler though and loved watching the sugar turning dark. That was the best part of it all :)
I used chopped fresh basil instead of dry.

We ate it, but it wasn't one of our favorites.  I halved the sugar - putting half of that amount in the marinade & half on top.  Well, eventhough I used Balsamic vinegar - sweeter than red wine vinegar - it still tasted too much like vinaigrette on salmon.  Sweet & salmon does go together fine, but I think the problem is the vinegar.  I'll stick with Asian Salmon, but still hunt for another good one.  Any suggestions?  :)

If you're a huge fan of salmon, avoid this recipe.  I tried this recipe thinking it would be a new and different variation on my favorite fish - boy, was it!  Wayyyy too sweet, and like another reviewer said, the sauce completely masked the distinctive flavor of the fish.   Now I know that sugar and salmon were not meant to be. 

Not to completely trample over Yvonne's submission, I DO think this might be good for someone who hates fish or to maybe convince finicky-pallated young children to eat fish. I'd say it's a recipe for fish-eaters on training wheels.

This was OK-be sure to watch the salmon to avoid burning with the glaze.

I made this for my wife and she really liked it. Most of the sugar seems to drip off while the fish is grilling, so it's not overly sweet. Ignore the wacky smell of sugar burning when you first put the fish on the grill, as it has no effect on the finished product.

My husband brought back a freezer full of salmon from Alaska and so I've tried several different recipes.  This is his favorite and request it on a regular basis!

Light and tasty, good for summer grilling!! Easy, too. I am a novice griller, so I don't know if this is normal for salmon, but the "skin-side" of the fish burned to a blackened crisp once I had flipped the fish over for the 2nd 12-minute side. We didn't eat that side so it was fine in the end, but I wanted to mention it to others making this recipe.

I love salmon and I love vinegar so this recipe was perfect for my taste!  I'm making it again tonight.  I recommend reserving some of the marinade for drizzling on after its cooked...that way, it is not contaminated by raw meat.  YUM!

The whole family loved this recipe - it is perfect for us because we don't all like a sweet marinade.  I just omit coating some of the pieces in sugar and it works out perfectly.  I occasionally substitute dill for the basil as a variation.

This was a nice, different recipe for salmon.  The combination of the vinegar and sugar flavors gently blended for a great taste.  I used the sugar lightly as we had never used a sweet treatment for salmon before.  Over-all it was well liked by my family, but I think that my husband is just more accustomed to the old lemon and dill-type treatment.  Good change of pace:)

I wanted to do something new to my usual salmon fillets and I thought this recipe was a "safe" bet since so many have given it 5 stars. I love salmon, but I could barely eat it this time. My tastebuds must be completely different from everyone else's because I found this recipe terrible. Salmon is already sweet since it is naturally fatty. The sugar and red wine vinegar made the fish so sweet and fruity tasting that it was really a waste of good salmon. All I could taste was the marinade and none of the salmon. I would not recommend this recipe. Sorry.

Was ok, the flavor wasn't bad. I'm not saying don't try it, it may be good to someone else, it just wasn't anything special to us. Sweet and salmon DO go together, I have many recipes that call for a sweet glaze or sugar within an Asian sauce, so don't be afraid of it. Again this wasn't bad, just nothing extrraordinary.

The marinade gave a nice subtle flavor to the salmon and the sugar glaze was a plus.

Easy to make marinade, love the fact that it uses basil. I cut the sugar down a bit and it still had a nice little crust on it. Nice variation for fish.
