I loved this recipe...so easy in the crockpot.  I didn't have bbq sauce, so I nearly doubled the spices and added 2 teaspoons of Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning.  I cooked it all day in the crockpot with 3 cups of water.  At the end of the day, I pulled the pork and strained the juice.  I then put those back together on the stove top to simmer a bit.  The flavor was GREAT!  We used it for sandwiches.

Very good, I removed the meat and allowed it to cool then chopped it and put it into a casserole.  I poured BBQ sauce over the meat and added about 1/2 cup broth from pot to keep it nice and juicy.  I covered the casserole with foil and baked at 350 degrees for about 30 min. then served it on buns with sliced red onion and sweet pepper strips.

Fantastic!  I got added broth instead of water, let the liquid reach a boil on the stove and then put it in the oven at 250 degrees for six and a half hours.

I used a center cut pork roast which is a little less fatty than a pork butt and not much more expensive.  I cooked it 8 hours on low in the slow cooker and then shredded the meat and returned it to the cooker with barbeque sauce for another 30 minutes. I did add a bit of the cooking liquid back to the pot to keep the meat nice and moist.  The success of any type of pulled pork has to do with choosing a barbeque sauce that you really like.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's and my pulled pork fanatic declared it superb!

Wow. What else can I say? This has proved to be easier than I ever imagined and absolutely delicious. I read in a review that it ends up tasting like whatever barbeque sauce you use... so I took care and bought some of the really good stuff. I ended up having to use two bottles. And a suggestion! Something seemed to be lacking, so I sprinkled some brown sugar on top and mixed in. WOWZA! It was like magic!

This is absolutely devine!!  I made an 8# roast and took it to work to share.  It was a HUGE hit!  I rubbed the seasonings into the meat and placed the roast in my crockpot.  I added water, turned it on low, and woke to the delicious smell of pork.  The meat had fallen completely off the bone.  This is definately a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

This is great! The success of this recipe depends very much on the barbecue sauce used. I think it is important to pour off the excess grease and then add more barbecue sauce prior to serving. Served this with cole slaw, chips, pickles and fresh brewed iced tea. Thanks!

Fabulous!!  My family flipped for it, so I am making it again tonight for mom, dad, sister and kids.  If you are using BBQ sauce... use Sweet Baby Ray's... I am so picky and these turned out AMAZING!  Going to try the slow cooker this time though.

Meat turned out nice and tender.  Great basic recipe for bar-b-que meat.  I used another reviewer's idea to make it a casserole and it turned out great.

Good stuff and really easy.  I put all the seasonings on at night and started the crockpot the next morning with a cup of water.  After cooking for 8 hours I shredded it and put maybe a third of the liquid back in plus an entire bottle of KC masterpiece hot and spicy barbeque sauce. Cooked on high another hour to heat through and perfection!  Will make again.  Thanks!

Such a delicious and Easy way to make pulled pork.  The only change that I have made is to use a Pork Loin.  The wife and kids (when they visit) really like ie.

I used the seasoning from this recipe and combined it with the cooking method from the slow cooker pulled pork recipe on this website.  Instead of water, use root beer (for 6 lb. roast, use about 3 12 oz cans or 1 liter) and cooked it in the slow cooker.  It was so tender and delicious!

Great recipe but i changed few things around. Rubbed pork roast with garlic salt and pepper before placing in the crock pot, added 8oz of dr.pepper, cooked for 5 hours on high, drained well and added bbq sauce. Returned back to the crock pot for 1 hour. Very tasty, will make it again

YUM!!  This recipe has been on my list to try for a while now, I wish I had made it sooner, it was delish.  Pretty much followed the recipe as was, only I don't have a dutch oven so just slow cooked it in a regular casserole dish. covered in a low oven.  I used Nana's barbeque sauce recipe found on this site and it was a family hit instantly.  Will definitely become a regular meal in our house!

This turned out wonderful!  I used frozen chicken breasts...put them in the crock pot, put the seasonings and garlic and onion on top.  Then added a can of chicken broth and the bbq sauce (KC masterpiece) and let it cook all day long.  Delicious, and so easy!

I had no problem with this recipe; I'm not sure why it didn't work for some of the reviewers. Just don't overdo on the water, and add any extra seasonings that you enjoy. I made a 4 lb. roast in a dutch oven; it took about 3 1/2 hours to cook, and the whole house smelled wonderful! The meat, minus the BBQ sauce is basically "carnitas" in this family. This may not last until I get the chance to add the BBQ sauce---it will probably be gobbled up as taco filling!

I'm sorry, but this was not very good.  It lacks seasoning and tastes only like whatever bbq sauce you use.

This was the first barbecue pork recipe I used after moving to the US. It's pretty good made as written but I now prefer to omit the cayenne, and use chipotle powder instead. I also use V8 juice instead of water for a bit more flavor. Thanks, Faye!

This was a great simple recipe. I made it over night in a crock pot with some extra garlick and cayenne. I awake to a wonderful smelling house. Was able to shred it, add bbq sauce, and take to work for pot luck. The meat really pulled in a lot of the spice and bbq flavor before the potluck. Delish.

tried this recipe.  looked at reviews and took those into consideration.  followed the recipe and it is perfect as is.  but, if you are looking for more flavor, add jalapenos to the water as it simmers with the meat.  more of the rub helps.  as for bbq sauce, i make my own, so the spice level of the meat is not a factor for me.  all in all, a great meal. paired with some corn on the cob and a side of cole slaw, makes for a great sunday afternoon picnic meal and leftovers!!!!  well done.

This was an excellent  easy recipe. My husband and kids loved it.  I used Sweet Baby Rays Barbecue Sauce and I added a little of the broth with it.  I also served it with cole slaw and barbecue beans.  This is a keeper so I will make it again, soon.

This is a really quick (to prepare) and easy recipe that tastes great.  I throw it in the crock pot and get on with my day.  I love pulled pork sandwiches and this makes a great one.

This was fantastic!  I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts in a slow cooker, and replaced the water with a can of vegetable broth.  I made it for a Bible study group, and it was a huge hit - very few of my guests even used the BBQ sauce or the cheese that I put out for the sandwiches.  Thanks!

My compliments to the chef!  This was delicious.  I bought the steaks instead of the roast and it took less time to cook in the Dutch oven.

Great recipe.  I made it a week before I needed it & froze it.  Put it in a crock pot, added the BBQ sauce, and some of the original liquid I saved.  Other reviewers are right, it will taste like the BBQ sauce you use.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for. After making pulled pork with only bbq sauce and being terribly disappointed, I was thrilled to find this one. Thanks Faye! :)

Very easy and very good. Threw the spices and onion in the slow cooker before i went to work. When I got home I took the pork out and shredded it, took some of the liquid out and added the pork and bbq sauce back.

For simplicity, I just sprinkle on garlic and onion powder and throw it in the crock pot.  After 8 hours, I pull the fat off, take out some of the liquid, shred the meat and then add the BBQ sauce.  I make this for DH to take to work all the time!

This was the best pulled pork I have ever made!  I took the suggestions of others and added back some of the juice and added the barbeque sauce (Famous Dave's Sweet and Zesty, our favorite) and then baked it in a casserole dish for half and hour. It was outstanding!  It does make a huge batch, but I just froze it in bags in individual serving size and it is perfect for a quick lunch or dinner!

This was one of the best barbeque recipes I have ever had. The meat was incredibly tender and moist. I bought the meat at the butcher counter, cut it in half and simmered in two dutch ovens because I needed it to cook faster (I was running late). It only took 3 hours to cook (each piece of meat was 4 1/2 pounds). I used two full bottles of barbeque sauce and I bet I spent under $15 for everything I needed for 8 pounds of barbeque! Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe that I will make again and again!

This is the best barbecue that I have EVER tasted!  I used all the same ingredients in the same amounts except for the amount of meat and barbecue sauce.  I was just trying it out and used 3 pork chops and about a cup of barbecue sauce.  I boiled the chops for about an hour, chopped them, then added the sauce and let it simmer for awhile.  DELICIOUS!!!  You must try this one!

We love this recipe. We always make it in the crock pot. Since the leftover broth is so flavorful (once you skim off the fat) we use it to make a veggie and pork dumpling soup. Thanks for the recipe!!

Great recipe and very easy! I made this in the crock pot. I halved the recipe, then rubbed the meat with the spices, let it cook for about 6-7 hours in the crock pot. Then discarded the juice and shredded the pork. Added a bottle of sweet smokey KC BBQ sauce and let it simmer in the crock pot for about an hour more. WOW! This was ten times better than I expected! 3 lbs of pork made enough for two to eat on for 3 days. Definately a recipe I will add to my recipe box!

I didn't use the cayenne pepper while making this.  We just didn't have any.  This was quite tasty and very very tender.  This was served on mini rolls and none survived.

This recipe makes alot (for not a lot of money!), so make sure you invite plenty of people over to enjoy these sandwiches.  We like our pulled pork really saucy, so we added extra bbq sauce and also topped our sandwiches with cole slaw.  YUMMY!

I cooked this in french onion soup and beef broth, with some creole seasoning, 2 bay leaves, and 2 finely chopped celery stalks...and used about 1.5 cups of Cattleman's BBQ sauce. Delicious.

Turned out great!  I have to get a slow cooker instead so my house doesn't get so hot!  The meat was really flavorful even before I put the sauce on.  Can't wait to experiment with better sauces and bring this to the next barbecue!

I used meaty country spareribs instead of the pork butt and Cattleman's Hickory Smoke BBQ Sauce. It came out GREAT!! Husband doesn't like BBQ sauce, so he took his share w/o the sauce as carnitas, and then I added the BBQ sauce for the rest of the family. Everyone loved it!  A keeper for sure.

This is so easy and so good, I use Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce and K.C. Masterpiece for seasoning while its cooking. Then I put butter on  buns and a little garlic powder and toast them and then pile on the meat. Deeelicious! A new favorite and my friends love it too.

My family and friends loved it. I made two roasts 
for my Memorial Day Picnic one mild as per recipe  
and the other spicy hot. Everybody raved about it.
It was good I had to give the recipe out to everybody.

Followed that recipe for the rub.  Coated the pork butt then left it covered in the refrigerator overnight.  Added the onions and water to the crockpot in the morning and let it go on low all day. What a great dinner!

I did not include any cayenne pepper since I don't like things too spicy.  I used less than what said because I had about 2.75 lbs of pork and sprinkled liberally with garlic powder and used some salt and pepper too.  I cooked a long time in my crockpot so it was good and soft.  Pulled it with two forks and then added the sauce until I had enough to my liking as I don't like mine dripping.  Enough for flavor...  Overall I'm very happy with this and would make this again.  4.5 stars

This was really good. For Fourth of July I made it at my family barbecue and everybody loved it. I partially broke the Rules because I actually didn't grill it but it was still a smashing hit! I just added some special spices to the sauce and it was perfect.

had no seasoning salt so added garlic plus,added some worchestshire sauce,used a combination of sweet baby rays bbq sauce and diana original. When thickening more added about 1 1/2 tbsp chicken soup base with about 1/2 cup brown gravy mix then poured in cooker. I als used 1 1/2 lb left over pork loin roast for this recipe and it was awesome. Next day i cooked minute rice and put pulled pork over top and added soy sauce and it was delicious too

The meat was so tender.  I drained most of the juices and then added the BBQ sauce otherwise it would have been like a soup.

This is the best pulled pork recipe I've found.  I throw everything in the crockpot at the same time. I use onion powder instead of chopped onions.  I also add liquid smoke  and some smoked paprika. I let it cook on high all day. Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was SO good! I scaled to 3 servings for my 2lb roast and put the rubbed roast with a little bit of water and the chopped onion in the crock pot on low for about 7 hours. Then drained, shredded, and added Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Everyone enjoyed this recipe very much!

This was fantastic.  I do monthly dinners for groups of 40-60 people and pulled pork in crock pots takes way to long.  
This way of cooking was great and very tasty for managing large groups.  I got compliments and request for the recipe from many people.  It worked so well for large groups that we actually did it for a club affair for 400 people and it was a hit. I did add a bit more garlic and we used Sweet Baby Rays Barbeque sauce. Fantastic

I followed the recipe except we love sweet pulled pork so I used brown sugar rather than cayenne pepper. I slow cooked it for 7 hours over night. Oh and I used shoulder like others mentioned and sweet baby ray's BBQ sauce.... Amazing and there is plenty to go round! Very easy to follow and complete will make again. Excited to share for our camping trip...

Great recipe!  I changed it a bit by using a pressure cooker.  It makes it a lot more tender a lot faster and it really absorbs the spices.

Excellent recipe.  I took someone's advice and after cooking the roast on the stove, I put it in the oven for 30 minutes with the BBQ sauce.  I mixed about 1/4 of the meat with a vinegar based sauce for my husband and baked that as well.  My kids can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

This was so simple to make. This tastes as good or better than the 2 local soul food/BBQ places in our neighborhood.  The meat was flavorful and tender, it was great with or without sauce.  I had to substitute garlic powder instead of cloves, and cooked mine in the oven at 400 for 1 hour and 300 for another 4 and let it sit overnight closed in the oven.

Yummy Yum! We love pulled pork and I'm always interested in trying new ways to fix it. I followed the recipe, but did add the following ingredients because we like our pulled pork with a hint of sweetness. I added: 1/2 cup of pineapple juice, pineapple tidbits, used only half of the garlic that called for in the recipe, and added 1tbsp of brown sugar. This was a wonderful recipe, especially served with coleslaw and sweet potato fries.

We liked it. But it had no real pizazz. I probably would not make this dish once or twice a year.

I have made this recipe several times and my whole family loves !  I cook until the meat falls off the bone.  I shred the pork and then add some of the juices back to the meat if it seems too dry.  I also add a little extra garlic salt to taste and we are good to go! We add the sauce on the side.  Love this recipe!
