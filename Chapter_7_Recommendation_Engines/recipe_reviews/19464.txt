WOW!!  Used a few more mushrooms, and a clove of garlic in the crust, and substituted a couple of slices of whole wheat bread toasted dry for the bread crumbs.  Didn't have the herb flavored cream cheese, used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and about 1 tsp. dried thyme instead--YUMMY--also used pieces of sliced deli ham instead of chunks of diced!!!! This is a beautiful recipe, with lots of great earthy flavor--served for dinner with a salad and fruit, or great for a brunch--not bready like so many other breakfast casseroles can be!

This was wonderful.  I sauteed a couple of cloves of garlic with the mushrooms.  I didn't have herb flavored cream cheese so I added 1 tbsp of pesto.  I'm doing a low-carb thing right now so I didn't add the bread crumbs and increased the parmesan cheese to 1/2 c.  Thanks so much for submitting this recipe!

i just found this recipe this morning...and it forsure gets a five plus from our house...we were supposed to go out for brunch but really glad we didn't bother...i made this instead (tho i was in a hurry) it turned out fabulous...i used white shrooms (coz that is all i could get at the grocery store) but would like to use brown ones next time...and there will be a next time...didn't have regular bread crumbs on hand so i used panko...followed the recipe but added a few drops (seven) of worchestershire as another reviewer did...as well as a few shakes of good garlic powder...well...the dh was pleased...he suggested next time i put in either green and/or red peppers too...and i used herb and garlic cream cheese spread...the dish was so tasty and creamy...will be making it again soon!!! thanks so much for sharing the recipe..

Used Egg Beaters, reduced fat cheeses, and butter flavored Pam, and it was fine and greatly reduced the fat content.

It's a lovely recipe, a bit time consuming but all the ingredients compliment each other really well and the pie tastes wonderfully. I added garlic to the mushroom crust and didn't use ham. Many compliments to Linda Miranda.

Perfect the way it is.  I am on a VERY low carb diet and doing very well.. so I did only 1 substitute on this.  I crushed pork rinds into crumbs in replacement for the bread crumbs.  Worked very well.  Yes its adding more "fat" - yet on a Low carb diet..it works!   Thanks for this Recipe!  It's a keeper!

Loved this recipe!!! I made it for Easter brunch, and the mushroom crust is awesome! I used lo-fat cream cheese (Alouette makes lo-fate herb and garlic)and sauteed and added the extra onions I had chopped to the ham and cheese mixture. Next time I will try fewer bread crumbs or the toasted whole wheat bread, but it was delicious as is!

This sounded better than it was.  I liked it ok, but my kids and even my mushroom-loving husband asked me not to make it again.

I love this pie. It's my faithful standby for when I have friends coming over for a comfy evening and need to make something that I can prepare slightly in advance. Everyone asks me for the recipe and I have to admit I almost always say it's a secret:-)

As my son would say, OM NOM!!  I made the recipe for 8.  My husband and I ate half of it....  I added garlic and I used marsapone cheese instead of cream cheese, and because I wanted no side dishes I added frozen peas, baby lima beans, and topped it the 10 minutes w/ mashed potatoes. We call the dish Shepherds Quiche.  Took longer to cook that 30 minutes. I ended up speedbaking for about 10 minutes.

Really enjoyed it!  Used a pack of plain cream cheese and added garlics and herbs.  Can't tell a difference.

This is a wonderful and unique variation of Quiche.  Followed the reviews to add more mushrooms and garlic to the crust.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

Had I read closer, I would have seen there was only 1 cup ham. I put in closer to 3 and it took about an hour to cook and completely set in the center. Everyone loved it, including my picky eater who hates mushrooms. I will definately use this crust for other dishes as well. Thank you!

I loved the mushroom crust! So tasty, even my toddler ate it all up! I used 1 tbsp. olive oil instead of butter to sautee the mushrooms and Pam cooking spray to coat the pie pan to cut down on fat. I might use a little less cream cheese next time too to save on calories. Our family was super happy with this recipe, thanks!

This was SO SO SO good.  I was really afraid to try this because of the eggs.  Thought it would be a quice, but it was not.  Total comfort food (but not calorie wise) LOVED IT!!!! Thank you so much for this recipe.  WOW! A repeat!

very yummy! I would've added a few more mushrooms to the crust but it"s sooo good! I also added chopped asparagus to the ham and egg mixture broccoli would also be good or peppers too.

This was awesome.  I used a garlic and herb cheese spread which is very similar to cream cheese.  Other than using Italian seasoned bread crumbs and layering my ham on top of the cheddar cheese layer, I followed the recipe to a T.  Oh, I also used a 9 inch deep dish pie pan.  Cooking time took more like 45 minutes but the end result was well worth the extra wait time.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was wonderful! I made it with chicken rather than ham, since that's what I had on hand and everyone loved it.  Definitely will make it often.

Very good!  I couldn't find any garlic and herb cream cheese, so I used chive.  As I was assembling, it looked really full so I ended up only using 3 eggs and 3/4 of the tub of cream cheese.  It was plenty to fill the pie.  Also, I added the diced ham on top of the cheddar cheese before adding the egg mixture.  That way the ham was evenly distributed in the pie.  The taste was interesting, in a good way.  Thanks!

That was so good!  I used chicken instead of ham.  I added a few more spices and cooked the mushrooms and onions in oil instead of margerine. I also did not use the hot pepper sauce.  It was delicious.  I will use this recipe again but not too often because it is very fatty, but one can treat themselves once in a while.

I cooked it longer than 30 min.  I think next time I would cook it at 350 instead of 375.  I also think a little garlic would have been good.  Overall it was great!

This was SO good and SO easy!!!  I used leftover ham, so it had a sweet honey glaze still on it. Delicious!!!

Excellent.  For those of us who don't care for HOT sauce... I cut the ground pepper in half and substituted 1 T of Worcestershire Sauce instead of the HOT sauce, and it gave it a nice rich flavor, without being spicy.  :)

What a great, creative way to use up the rest of a ham! I made it with a few lighter options, like many people---I used 1 whole egg, and 3 egg whites, 2% cheese, and light cream cheese. You would never know the difference in taste. My husband, daughter and I polished off more than half of the pie in one sitting----we kept going back for seconds! (and thirds) Definitely will make again!

What makes this pie is definitely the mushroom crust, no doubt about it. It is an original and very tasty addition. While I really liked this dish, I felt it was too rich and salty otherwise. I think next time I make this I will omit the Cheddar cheese altogether and reduce the cream cheese to 2/3 container. I added garlic and Rosemary to the crust, as well as Rosemary and thyme to the egg mixture for an even more savory flavored dish. This is a great recipe to experiment with your herbs for different versions of this recipe. I will definitely be keeping this recipe and experimenting with it to tweak it to my tastes. I'm glad I found it here! Thank you!

Very good flavor.  The crust was a bit gooey...next time I will try baking a bit before adding egg filling.

200 calories, 9g fat, 19g protein, 12g carbs (per calorie count)  I used 6 mini pot pie pans and altered the recipe as follows:  Substituted non-fat cream cheese and instead cooked mushrooms with 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2 tsp sage, 1/4 tsp tarragon and 2 tsp onion powder. Omitted butter and instead cooked mushrooms with 1 tbs olive oil and sprayed tins with Pam.  I used extra lean ham (5% fat). I had to add 2 eggs (6 eggs total) to fill the pot pie pans. I omitted the cheddar cheese and salt for nutritional reasons. I omitted the parsley and onions because I did not have them. I refrigerated the individual pies and reheated them at the same oven temp. for 10 minutes. Yummy & easy dinners for a week.

This was so good!!!  The only change I made was to finely chop a leek into the mix.  I think it really flavored the dish nicely. I also replaced half of the cream cheese with cottage cheese and you couldn't tell the difference, but my diet could!

This was just ok.  We absolutely love all of the ingredients, but it would have been easier to make an omelet and put all the ingredients in it.  I really didn't care for the cream cheese in the eggs either.  The only thing I did different was use chive cream cheese and I added bell pepper to the mushrooms.

Well I was impressed. I've never had Quiche with anything other than pastry crust  but it was great.  I stuck to the recipe but didn't add salt as I knew my ham would be salty enough.  I guess I don't know exactly how much a dash of hot sauce is as I couldn't taste it.  My 2yr old loved it though, I didn't think she would like it so this dish is now on our list of things to make. =)

A little salty for my taste, but good!  I would make it again w/low sodium ham and cream cheese.  Also omit the salt added to the crust.

This was great! I could not find herb-garlic flavored cream cheese, I substituted a 6 ounce container of Alouette cheese spread. Will try cooked bacon instead of ham next time. Definitely a keeper.

This was really very good. I changed one thing  just because of availability of ingredients. I used chive and onion cream cheese and left out the onion in the crust. I thought it would be too much. I'd probably still add the onion to the crust next time. I will most definitely make this again. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

Family really, really loved the crust.   I am giving the crust five stars.  I can't  rate the filling since  I adjusted the filling to reflect what we had available.  I  used  about  4 oz. of plain cream cheese and added more eggs and some egg substitute and added some cooked broccoli.  Used Panko crumbs; I think they gave the crust a little extra  crunch.   I also put the pie pan on a preheated cookie sheet which may also have insured that the crust was crisp and  not soggy.    I don't think the stated filling amount would fill the crust.  Since I used more  ingredients required a longer bake time.   The crust is great; I will experiment with other fillings.

I couldn't find herb and garlic cream cheese, so used Alouette Garlic and Herb Cheese Spread.  Used panko instead of regular breadcrumbs.  This was yummy and a great (non-traditional) way to use leftover ham.  Will definitely make again!

YES! This was so delish! I added extra mushrooms and garlic to the crust as some suggested, and I will be making this again for sure. I ate the left overs for 4 straight days (and I never do that due to getting tired of things). A+

Delish!  To make this Paleo I used almond "bread" crumbs instead of wheat bread crumbs.  I shook several drops of gourmet hot sauce on top before baking.  I think we used Honey Baked Ham as well, leftover from Christmas.  Wonderful!

Excellent! Very happy I found this. I accidentally forgot the cheese which I would add next time but for anyone wanting or needing to leave the cheese out, don't worry; it was fantastic anyway!

I had leftover ham and wanted to use it in a creative way.  This was absolutely delicious.  We had it for dinner and it was quite filling.  I used an assortment of exotic mushrooms and baby portabellas as well as  minced fresh garlic.  It was probably closer to 15 oz, but definitely made the crust delicious. I also substituted cream cheese with chives and onions as this is what I had.  I cannot wait to make it for company.

Just finished this and I did read all the reviews.  It was easy to make and sauted mushrooms in olive oil, used Italian breadcrumbs and 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  Also used non-stick spray instead of butter.  It was excellent and is really easy to tweak to your taste.  Just remember if you double the recipe, it is important to not put it all into a deep dish.  You need the shorter pans to ensure they cook correctly.  I will make this again!  Only downside was NO leftovers.

It more or Less tasted like quiche. The crust would make an excellent side dish on its own, though. Tasted like stuffing but with more mushrooms than breadcrumbs.

Preparation was straightforward for a novice like me.  However, the taste ddn't live up to the review levels of >4.  Definitely not that good.

I used Bella Mushrooms.  I used ricotta cheese instead of cream cheese and added a couple of tablespoons of flour to thicken the custard.  I used a little extra sharp cheese.  It was to die for.  Tasted good the following day when reheated in the microwave.

I made this with leftover Christmas ham and everyone loved it! I substituted Alouette w/garlic and herbs for the cream cheese and it worked really well although I would skip adding salt next time. I definitely think you could use other leftovers like chicken or turkey as well. Next time I might add fresh chopped broccoli or spinach! Very good recipe

This is okay.  Very rich.  I think a regular crust with the mushrooms and onions mixed in the rest would be just as good.  Guess I am saying that you should just make quiche.

Funny!!  My husband said "you'd better have something else on backup", realllly didn't think he would like this. BUT....my family LOVED it!!  Told me to add it among his favorites!! I didn't alter the recipe at all.  I found the listed cream cheese at a grocery store called Sullivans.

I gave it 5 the wife gave it 4.  I will leave out the extra salt in the future.  Unfortunately I can't find herb and garlic cream cheese.  I used the closest I could find, chive and onion.  Followed everything else as written and it was excellent.

Fixed this for dinner last night and had it again for breakfast this morning.  Loved it!  I only had 8 ozs. of mushrooms, but it still came out perfect.  My husband was crazy about it.

This has become a family favorite for breakfast.  It is unusual, rich and satisfying!  I have had to substitute herb and chive cream cheese sometimes, and it's still very good.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and the filling was not even close to being set after 30 minutes.  We also found it really salty and probably just a personal preference, but didn't care for the taste of the cream cheese filling.  The mushrooms were really good though, thus the 3 stars!  Thanks.

Just finished my first piece.  It's cheesy-licious!! Other reviewers are right and I sure to feel guilty about the fat, but, darn it!  Sometimes you just gotta!  I'm already thinking about a long walk so I can have another piece before bed.  Great recipe!  Used smoked sausage (Hillman's).

Mmm, cheesy! I made this with thinly sliced sandwich ham as that's what I had on hand, and I also added a little bit of garlic powder in with the mushroom/onion mixture. We enjoyed it. Thanks!

This was good.  It is much creamier than a quiche, which pleased my husband.  The flavor of the crust reminded me a bit of stuffing.
