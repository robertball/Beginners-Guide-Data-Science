Bake these at 400 watching after 10 min and you will have the absolute best Butter tarts.I tried baking at 350 the first time but it wasn't hot enough. Makes enough for 3 1/2 doz bought tart shells.

I had lost my mom's recipe for butter tarts and this one seemed similar in ingredients from what I remembered... however the temp settings must be too high or too long because I followed the recipe exactly and have an oven thermometer and they came out as crispy critters... did the 2nd batch at 400 for only about 12 minutes and although not quite so "burnt" flavoring was blaw...

I lost my favourite recipe for making tarts. One of the ingredients was golden corn syrup so figured this must be close and it was. I use dried blueberries instead of raisins or with raisins on occasion. Also sometimes use nuts.Stampy

I would lower the oven temp to 350 and bake a bit longer.  When I baked this recipe at 400 the filling didn't set very well and they stayed too runny.  When I baked them at 350 they came out perfect!

I loved this recipe. Bought Costco frozen tart shells,distrubuted plump raisins in each shell then pored the filling in. I found the amount called for was more than necessary unless youur a raisin lover. 15 tarts fit easily on a cookie sheet and I got 30. These freeze very well. C'est tres bonne!

Really enjoyed this classic butter tart recipe.  Followed it to the letter with the exception of adding walnuts, raisins and cranberries. Delicious!

I used this recipe as a guide to my late wife's recipe because she didn't have good enough instructions for me. I changed some of the ingredients to what she had. It all worked out very good. Thank you

A Canadian classic recipe that my Mother made for special occasions.  Only difference is that we have always made them with toasted, finely chopped   nuts -- usually walnuts. Always a treat when we had tea at my parents best friends in Southern Ontario.  Millie, who was like a grandmother to us all, gave my mother this recipe .  It is hard to just eat only one!!!

Excellent! I needed a recipe with golden syrup as I live in the UK where corn syrup is hard to find. 

I used my grandma's pastry recipe, so I can't speak to the pastry  here, but the inner part is lovely. 

I baked them in silicon cases and after the time, popped them out and put them back in the oven for 2 min to brown the bottoms. 

My British in laws loved them!

Tasted wonderful.  I cooked the first pan for 15 minutes.  The rest I left in for 10 - 12 minutes and they were much better. Just got this oven and it may be a bit hot.

This is an excellent butter tart recipe!  It is gooey and runny and that's what makes it so wonderful! I followed the advice of others and lowered the temperature to 400F . They baked for 15 minutes and looked perfect, but I waited and kept them in an additional 5 minutes. They were thoroughly cooked and came out perfectly!
