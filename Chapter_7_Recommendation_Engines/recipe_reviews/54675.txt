this was simply the best way to cook cauliflower that i have ever had. make sure you cover the casserole dish. i also baked with the lid on next time  and at 400 instead because it started to burn. thanks so very much.

really, really good recipe with the following tweaks:  i tried to keep the florets as uniform in size as possible to accomplish even cooking.  i added the parsley at the start to let the flavor bake in.  i also added 3/4 tsp. onion powder.  i covered and cooked at 400 for 20 mins, then added bread crumbs and a fair amt. of romano chz and broiled for abt. 5 mins uncovered (my oven has a low and high broiler setting--i went the low route) and it was delicious.  great way to make cauliflower and will save this recipe!

This is now my favorite way to prepare cauliflower!  Nice to see a healthy way to perk up cauliflower - I usually just steam it, and I try to avoid the cheese sauces that so frequently go along with cauliflower.  This is easy and delicious.  The only change I would make is to just toss the oil and garlic with the cauliflower in a bowl instead of the bag, as some of the garlic bits got stuck to the inside of the bag and it was a pain to scrape them out.  Otherwise a perfect, healthy recipe!  It is even delicious cold (couldn't stop picking at it after dinner...)  Thank you for sharing!

This was unlike any cauliflower I have ever eaten-truly special and unique. Whether it's the roasting aspect, or the addition of Parmesan cheese, or the combination of the two, this is a memorable dish, which is saying a lot since after all, this is just cauliflower! Other than reducing the cooking time by five minutes because I used just a small amount of cauliflower for the two of us, I prepared this exactly as the recipe directed.  Outstanding!

I thought this recipe was soooo good. I love cauliflower and like finding new ways to prepare it that don't involve a heavy, dairy-based sauce. This was fantastic. I only used about 1/4 c of parmesan cheese, which seemed like enough. I used Kraft Parm Plus so it has garlic, basil, and some other stuff in it and it was VERY tasty, but I think regular parmesan would be just fine. I also added about 1/4c. of italian breadcrumbs. This was so easy and tasty, I will definitely make this again. Oh, after reading about some people haveing problems with burning garlic, I kept the dish covered with foil for the first half of cooking. And I didn't find it undercooked at all; I thought it was perfectly cooked.

I cut this in half to use up half of a cauliflower head I had in my fridge. Plus, I'm the only one who likes cauliflower on it's own in this house. I made no changes. This turned out fabulous. NOTE: This makes an EXCELLENT cold salad! Just substitute it in place of your potatoes or toss it with other chopped veggies and a good italian dressing. It's SO good.

I was looking for a recipe for the frozen cauliflower I had on hand, but I tried this even though it called for fresh. I used about 1.5 TBS olive oil and 4 large cloves of garlic. I added the whole bag of cauliflower frozen which congealed the oil, but I was still able to get it all covered. It was ready in less than 20 minutes and was very good and very easy. I'll try it with fresh next time to see if it is worth the difference in time and money. Update: Yes, the fresh is worth the extra time and money! Love it.

This was delicious.  You can add as much garlic as you like.  Roast it only until slightly soft.  Don't let it become overcooked.  Very good!

great flavor and super easy. make sure to give this plenty of room by putting it on a cookie sheet so it roast and doesn't steam. I get better results at 425 degrees.

We were going to have cauliflower today but I wanted something different.  I used this recipe exactly as written (well, more garlic :-), and didn't read reviews first.  I will definitely roast this veggie more often; thanks, Shellery!  (I enjoy it raw and steamed, and mashed, too) Now, after having read ALL 615 reviews, quickly skipping over all of those that added enough extras to make a casserole, I agree that I'll skip the bag next time...to avoid having to scrape the insides for minced garlic!  I agree that maybe some disappointing results had to do with the freshness of the cauliflower. I think part of the attraction of this recipe is the ease of preparation with no pre-cooking required, for us, anyway. I agree it's important to have all pieces about the same size. I "sliced" the florets and they really browned beautifully!  I used a 9x13 Pyrex dish, uncovered, and had *some* burned garlic after stirring since some pieces escaped to the sides of the pan, unnoticed.  (Not a problem since I had added extra!!) I used olive oil to grease the pan and had no problems with cleanup.  I can't comment on leftovers because we didn't have any!   We'll enjoy variations now and then but the original recipe is delicious!  Try this, especially if you already like cauliflower :)  and garlic :)

We really enjoyed this. However, I didn't use a whole head of cauliflower as I had already bought florets.  What I found to be a problem was that the garlic and parmesan cheese both scorched before the cauliflower was completely done.  This whole dish actually only took about 25-30 minutes to complete.  I'll make it again, but will have to really watch the progress so it doesn't burn.

I actually think this recipe is better (and easier) with just olive oil, sea salt and a generous sprinkling of garlic powder.  Also, I always use frozen cauliflower; just cook it a bit longer. Wonderful with broccoli, too!  Oh, one more thing:  I always roast broccoli/cauliflower at 400 degrees instead of 450.  Also, there's no need to grease your casserole dish or use a plastic bag to mix this up.  Just put your veggies in the (preferably glass) pan, pour on the oil and seasonings, toss everything together and cook.

Don't understand the reviewers who lowered the heat and "covered" the dish?? That just makes for steamed cauliflower without the wonderful carmelizing of roasting vegetables.  :-/

I used the suggestions of others and reduced the heat and covered the dish.  I found that it was steamed cauliflower opposed to roasted.  The flavour wasn't bad but it was fairly mushy.

1st time making cauliflower - i thot it was a wee bit bland but good texture so will make again. hubby & daughter loved it. made per instruction except i did sprinkle panko per earlier review - it made for a nice crunch to go with the soft not mushy cauliflower. my advice is to make uniform smaller florets for consistant cook thru without having to cover with foil. next time i will add a little pinch of salt & pepper. nice addition to my veggie rotation.

I thought this was a fantastic recipe for cauliflower.  I personally love cauliflower, but hubby isn't as fond, so I decided to try this one out.  I used about 6 cloves of garlic, baked at 425 (was cooking something else too), cooked uncovered for about 25 mins and then covered for another 15.  At the very end, I added parsley, fresh parmesan and bread crumb mix to the top and cooked another 5-7 minutes.  Turned out great!

Really excellent!  I was not a "cooked" cauliflower fan at all but wanted to add some new veggie's to my family meals and decided to give this a go.  EXCELLENT!  I use more garlic and crushed red pepper.  The amount of olive oil stated is plenty.  I toss this whole thing in the dish I'm baking it in and it tosses fine.  The cooking time may be a little off.  I tend to cook for a bit longer but I think it comes down to how well done you like your vegetables.  Mine was still crunchy with the stated time.  I went another 10-12 minutes and got it to my level of doneness.  This one is definitely a keeper and is the only way I'll be preparing cauliflower from now on.  Thank you!

After the first 25 minutes make sure to get the parm sprinkled a little on each piece.  Also, after broiling the cauliflower in the oven, transfer everything to a serving platter and drizzle the leftover oil over the veggies.  You'll get the oil, cheese, garlic, and sweet juice from the cauliflower.

This is awesome. I made the cauliflower twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. My family said it was great. The second time I made it I added juliened red and green bell peppers, a bit of basil, thyme, and some grilling spice. Oh my goodness. it was great. My family liked it also and said both are good and both are going inot my recipe book as regulars.

My son said this was mighty tasty! I didn't even know he liked cauliflower. I roast cauliflower frequently and don't understand why everyone wants to cover it to steam it. Part of the roasting process is to carmelize the vegetable and have it all nice and browned. At 450 with minced garlic the garlic does tend to get burned a little, but it gave great flavor to the cauliflower. I tossed in a bowl like I always do. After adding the cheese and dried (no fresh) parsley I did broil for a few minutes, but I don't think it is a necessary step if you have roasted uncovered. The cheese will melt from the heat of the cauliflower, unless it is to get it browned a little. Very nice change for us from cajun seasoned cauliflower. Thanks for the recipe!

Okay ... I just made this for with supper tonight.  Husband is not home yet, but I wanted elements of the meal ready to go for when he gets back.  It might not make it that long.  Notes, though:  you don't need to cover it when cooking - you want a roast to it and covering it will more steam it.  Enjoy the roast.  Don't add bread crumbs - you want this to be a vegetable roast and nothing more.  Leave it simple and enjoy the flavor of the cauliflower and garlic.  The light flavor of the cauliflower with the roasted garlic (which sweetens it) combine beautifully enough.  The parmesan adds a light element with a tiny bit of salt, so don't salt it too much in the beginning.  I did find that I didn't want the whole 1/3 cup of cheese, but my cauliflower head was small, so you may want to use more than I did.

Don't tweak ... let the flavors shine through!

Those of you saying to "cover it" are out of your minds.  If you want to steam the cauliflower, go ahead and cover it...but if you want to roast it (as the recipe name "ROASTED Garlic Cauliflower" indicates), don't!  That delicious carmel-colored browning that happens is not burning.  That's what happens to veggies when you roast them - for the love of God, let it happen!  This recipe is perfection.   Thank you!

Thanks for such a great recipe!  I have gotten so I make this all the time and have tried various techniques & ingredients.  Our favorite is:  3-4 T of extra virgin OO, 6-8 cloves of chopped garlic, about a tsp of garlic powder, salt, ground pepper, 1/3 c parmesan, I mix that all in a zip lock baggie and let maranaide at least an hour.  I do it at 450 for 20 - 25 minutes until it browns a little.  Then I pull it out & wait for the rest of my meal to finish cooking.  Just before serving I sprinkle with extra sharp cheddar cheese & parsley & throw in the broiler for couple of minutes until nice & hot & cheese is crunchy on the pan.  I have had a lot of teenagers mothers call me and ask me for this recipe because their kid came home and raved about it.  P.S.  My farvorite is to do this on my pampered chef cookie sheet stone so no need to pre-greese.  If that's being used for something else I use a regular cookie sheet & put down a piece of tin foil otherwise cleanup can be a real pain.

I had never tried cauliflower (unbelievable, I know), and it was so delicious prepared this way!  I didn't change a thing as far as the ingredients go.  I lined my pan with foil because I always end up having to soak my pans for weeks after roasting vegetables, haha.  I also covered the pan with foil while cooking it... I think that's why my cauliflower came out soft and not a bit crunchy as some of the other reviewers have mentioned.  Broiling it at the end was such a nice touch.  The cauliflower was slightly browned and the cheese was melty... I love this!

I did this on the bbq.  Just put cauliflower, oil and garlic all mixed into a foil packet.  BBQ about 10 minutes on one side, flip and cook 10 minutes more.  Open packet and sprinkle with parmesan, salt, pepper and parsley.  Close packet for 5 minutes to let cheese melt.  Excellent, it smells as good as it tastes.  This is the best way to have cauliflower.

I don't much care for cauliflower, but this recipe is great.  I followed the recommendation of other users and lowered the temperature.  I baked the cauliflower/garlic/oil mixture at 400F for about 30 minutes, stirring half way through, followed by ~5 minutes under the broiler after the addition of fresh parmesan.

I made this last night. It was wonderful. And easy. 
It baked in the oven while I did other supper things. Then it had to sit on the counter (covered with foil) while the broiler was busy with salmon fillets (I took it out of the oven while it was a bit undercooked).
I mixed the cheese and seasonings in with the cauliflower rather just leaving it set on top and stirred the dish a couple times while it was broiling.
My husband and teen-aged son loved.
A great way to fix an under-utilized veggie.

This was great, I tweeked it by adding yellow squash and sliced onions. I also added some grated mozzarella and stirred it through before I broiled it. I found keeping it covered until the last 10 min helped to soften it up just a little. Will cook this one often!

Very, very good!  I added some extra garlic because I am a garlic freak, mixed the parsley with the oil mixture and, before broiling, added about 1/4 cup of buttered Italian bread crumbs to the top.  I did bake the cauliflower in a covered casserole but I cooked it for about 40 minutes because I like the cauliflower soft and juicy.  It WAS that and my husband and I alone polished off a very large cauliflower --- which I served with baked sweet potato and pan-grilled chicken breasts.  A relatively low calorie, healthy and delicious meal.  I will be preparing cauliflower in this manner again and again.  Thank you for sharing!

I have been making cauliflower this way for years and it is simply the best! Roasting really brings out the flavor of the cauliflower. I would suggest turning the temp down to 400 and roasting for 20-25 minutes. Also, make sure you cover your baking dish with aluminum foil! This will prevent your garlic for scorching and make your veggies more tender.

This recipe was a pleasant surprise!  I usually don't like parmesan cheese but it was really tasty with the garlic and cauliflower.  The roasted cauliflower by itself is a little bit sweet, so adding salt, pepper, garlic and parmesan is a big improvement!  I didn't have any parsley, but the recipe turned out great without it.

I made this recipe tonight for the third time, and it was PERFECT-so delicious that I am going to double it for a company dinner party next month.  I cut the cauliflower into SMALL florets.  I steamed the cauliflower for 4 minutes.  I then mixed the cauliflower in a bowl with the garlic, olive oil, fresh  parsley, and I added 1/2 chopped red onion, a few baby carrots that I peeled  with a potato peeler, some fresh oregano and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.  I cooked it covered at 400 until it was soft enough (at least a half hour).  We like it soft, but that is a personal preference.  Then I added parmesan cheese and whole wheat bread crumbs and broiled for 2 minutes uncovered.  My broiler is extremely hot. Yummy !!

hubby said 'I don't usually like cauliflower but this is great!'  nuff said!!  (he also likes the 'smashed cauliflower' recipe on allrecipes which tastes like mashed potatoes--also worth a try!) and I only had garlic oil (instead of real garlic) and forgot to use the parsley!   it's worth it to use real grated parmesan (gets all crunchy!) and I recommend dipping it in some pesto!  thanks for a fantastic idea!!!

I have already made this a bunch of times.  It is wonderful.  I don't put the parmesan on it.  I put the parsley in the bag with the califlower and cook it all together for the 25 min.  Its usally brown enough without broiling.

I've loved roasted cauliflower since I was introduced to it in culinary school... I liked the addition of garlic, even though some pieces were a bit charred by the end of the cooking time. I went the full 25 minutes, as I love the caramelization that begins to occur around that time. I added maybe 1/4 tsp crushed pepper flakes and skipped the step of adding the parm and parsley. To finish it off, I just gave it a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice and tossed it around. I eat this like candy...

YUM!  Side dish with Artichoke Chicken.   The only thing I did different was cover with alum foil for the first 10-15 minutes.  I then stirred and broiled on high.  Think with my oven temp I could've gone without covering first since they were a tad bit mushy.  Still great and I will make again!

SO GOOD! I cleaned out the fridge and instead used 1 green bell pepper, 1 italian squash, 1/2 head of cauliflower, & 3 carrots.  The cauliflower definitely had the best flavor, but all were very delicious (and healthy!).  Also, I forgot to stir halfway through and just did it before broiling and everything turned out perfect.

The first time I thought this was OK..not really memorable, but my husband liked it ..preferring it to  mashed cauliflower (yeah, we were doing the Atkins thing). So, I decided to revisit the recipe.  This time I replaced my pre-grated parmesan (yeah.. the kind in the green shaker bottle), with some Parmigiano-Reggiano I grated fresh, this melted better and allowed you to actually taste the cheese, as the garlic in this dish can be pretty over powering. I thought it was pretty tasty this time and intend to use it again.  Thanks Shellery.

This is fabulous and easy!  I accidentally forgot to add the parmesean at the end, and it still tasted delicious with just the garlic (lots of it!), salt and pepper.  I will definitely be making this again.

If you are a cauliflower lover, please try this recipe. It is absolutely delicious! I roast in a large baking dish so I can spread it in a single layer taking 15-20 minutes in my oven. When I take it out to broil it, I put it in a oven proof serving dish and sprinkle on the parmesan and parsley. Yum!!

We absolutely loved this.  The darker it got, the tastier it got.  We did some with and some without the parmesan at the end and it was good both ways.  If your broiler gets too hot you can toast finely grated parmesan in a non stick pan over med-low heat.  Shake or gently stir often so it browns evenly.  It's super yummy.
A lot of reviews suggest covering the dish - that completely defeats the purpose, it won't be roasting.  For this recipe you want the cauliflower to turn dark.  The black edges were my favorite part!

Great dish!  Followed the other suggestions to cover with foil & roast at 425.  Also added 2 small chicken breasts which I cut into 1" pieces.  Served over brown rice to round out the meal.

I know its only cauliflower but WOW! This was delicious and SO easy! My whole family loved it, and that says a lot. It did take a little longer to bake than it said...I just left it in the bottom of the oven while I broiled the flank steak we were having with it.

This is a nice change of pace.  Not knock your socks off fabulous, but a solid weeknight side.  It was easy, healthy, and tastes great.  I followed the recipe (though I didn't measure anything) and I added a dash of garlic powder, some dry minced onions, and a dash or 2 of crushed red pepper to the mix.  Thanks for *introducing* me to cooked cauliflower that doesn't smell gross! ;)

My first attempt at this recipe tasted great, but the garlic and cauliflower were a little too burned for my taste.  So, I reduced the temp to 400, started roasting the cauliflower with a little olive oil for 15 minutes, then added the garlic and more oil for an additional 15 minutes (covered in foil).  It turned out perfect.  Also, I omitted the cheese and parsley.

Followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed! Very delicious. Will make this over and over again until I can't stand the sight of cauliflower.

This is the only way I cook cauliflower. Family who didn't like cauliflower loved this recipe. I bake 15 minutes at 425, turn over the cauliflower, bake 15 mins. add cheese, bake 10 mins.  I do not cover as I like the cauliflower to brown a bit rather than steam.   I make this even when I'm cooking for one as it reheats nicely. I use fresh shredded Parmesan cheese in place of grated.

OH MY GAWD...this was the FIRST time I ever tried to cook cauliflower and let me tell you this is GOOD...I didn't even know if I really liked cauliflower...but I DO NOW!!! This was easy and VERY flavorful. The only thing I think I did wrong (so I will share my ignorance with the world so that hopefully I will be the only one that does it) was to use that type of grated Parmesan Cheese that you buy off the grocery store shelf, and even with that this was still DELICIOUS. Didn't change a thing!!! My only suggestion is the serving size be adjusted from 6 to 1...because 1 person can easily eat the ENTIRE thing this is so good. I will be cooking this at least once per week.

I need to double this recipe next time, as it's fabulous and the entire family eats it with no complaints.  I didn't change a thing.  Baked it in an enameled cast iron roasting pan at 450 degrees for the entire time and it browned beautifully.

Holy COW! So delicious. I used garlic salt instead of regular and didn't read the direction well so I added my Parmesan and Parsley when I stirred half way through....it was out of this world. I did sprinkle it with a tad more parmesan and garlic salt as soon as it came out of the over. The slightly crispy pieces I scrapped from the bottom of my dish were our favorite. =-)

Being diet-conscious and lactose intolerant, I ommitted the cheese and added a liberal dose of oregano along with the oil and garlic.  It had a nice italian zip and fewer calories.

OMG !!!  Look at my user name.  I put some really choice sirloins on the barbie tonight and this dish in the oven, then ate maybe 4 oz of beef & every bit of the cauliflower I could scrounge. That scenario is less likely than seeing the Panama Canal jammed with two foot ice. Best dish I've found on this site.   Now, I did double the garlic and next time I will treble it, but that's me, the garlic-lover. Anyone who likes garlic who doesn't try this recipe is making the mistake of their culinary career. Me? Saying anything so positive about some  vegetables? UN-bloody-Believable.

The best cauli I have ever made or eaten! It is good cold too; I used some in a cold pasta veggie salad and it really made it super tasty. I tossed about 5 sliced cloves of garlic in a bowl with the olive oil and cauli. Next time I will use a smaller casserole though; an 8-inch square would have been sufficient, and it keeps the cheese together. Mmm, thanks for the recipe!

Very nice! We'll definitely do this again. 

I was cooking with something else so I had it in at 450 for 15 minutes, then lowered to 350 for 20 minutes. I did not need to broil and forgot to add the cheese. It was tasty anyway and I cannot wait to make it again and remember the cheese! LOL

Very Good.  I steamed cauliflower in a microwave steamer for 4 minutes then stirred w/oil & garlic. Placed in a foil line pan, sprinkled w/ parmesan & placed in broiler on low for about 5 min. until golden brown. Turned out perfect! So quick and easy with these modifications. Done in less than 10 min. Even my kids enjoyed.

It must be me....everyone else seems to love this recipe.  Is the cauliflower cooked ahead?  Did I buy bad cauliflower?  Mine did not cook.  I had to add some water to steam it.  I also added asiago cheese which gave it more flavor.  Would like to see more vegetable side dishes.  Thanks for sharing,  Pi

This is a great use of a healthy vegetable. I only had dried parsley and I added it before. I didn't really measure anything either. After reading the other reviews, I decided to cover with foil until the stirring, and this kept the garlic from burning. Thanks!

This is amazing, I've made this multiple times though each time I add a little less oil. So far I'm down to only adding one tablespoon and I still think it can go for less, keep in mind the cheese has its own oils/fat adding to this. But wow, I don't think I could ever get tired of eating this

This is a delicious way to prepare cauliflower! I put a bit more oil than the recipe and baked covered as suggested in other reviews. I added shredded cheese and removed the cover for the last 5 mins. Very happy with how it turned out.

Cooked it at 400 degrees and covered it with foil for half the time. Used a whole head of garlic. Did not even add the cheese. Tastes so good you'll forget you're eating a vegetable.

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  Even our twins who are only 2 1/2.  I do recommend covering for the first part of baking or the garlic will burn and be bitter.  Second half, toss, leave uncovered.

Pretty darned good.  I roasted mine at 375 because I did chicken at the same time.  I had it in there about 45-50 minutes, and it turned out just fine.  Didn't do the broiling step, but did add the parsley and parmesan about 30 minutes into the roasting.  This'll be repeated!

Extremely simple recipe.  Great way to make cauliflower and keep the cauliflower taste - it isn't boiled away or drowned in salt, cheese, or lost with other veggies.  I stirred my cauliflower every 10 minutes to keep it cooking evenly.  We had no leftovers.

This scored high with everyone at our table tonight- now thats unusual. Veggies don't usually score hi with my kids however there were NO LEFTOVERS - Fantastic! not overpowering garlic, not mushy, & especially not the same ole cauliflower. Thanks for sharing.

Fabulous and easy too!  I used half a head of cauliflower for just two of us and reduced the other ingredients accordingly.  You need to keep an eye on the last few minutes as it can burn quickly.

This mostly just tasted like cooked cauliflower to me - which is fine.  I just didn't get much flavor from the roasted garlic.

Nice side dish with a very mild taste.  Next time I make this I'll just toss the cauliflower florets with the oil and the garlic.  Putting all into the bag and shaking left quite a bit of the garlic sticking to inside of the oily bag which then left a mess to get out to put on the cauliflower.

This was amazing.  I suggest using broccoli as well for a nice combination.  A nice sprinking of sea salt is crucial, not just pepper.  Cover for the first half of cooking time, then uncover for last 10 minutes.  Extra parmesan cheese before broiling is wonderful, too!

I love this recipe and have been roasting my cauliflower for years.  The only thing I do is skip the parsley and add crushed rosemary.  The flavors really compliment each other and this has become a family favorite.

This was delicious.  Note:  You DO NOT need to cover while roasting.  Just make sure your rack is in the middle of the oven, and turn the cauliflower after about 10 minutes.  I had cut my florets in half, because they were quite large.  Because of this, I reduced the roasting time by 5 minutes.  After adding the parmesan and parsley, I put the oven rack on the top and broiled for about 1-2 minutes.  Perfect!  Will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my new favorite Cauliflower recipe too.  It was great.  The timing and directions were right on.  I added a little bit of chopped red onion to mine and I grated fresh Parmesan.  Superb!

Like others I found the heat far too high.  As well, I put a lid on. Followed the advise of one reviewer to use a bowl but then found that the garlic pieces were burning.  My suggestion is to infuse the oil with the garlic in a pan, strain the garlic out before using oil. If that is adding one more step then perhaps just garlic powder could be used, (although I'm not a fan of powder it does have its uses). It will be a matter of tweaking between the heat, lid, and garlic.

This recipe is really fantastic. I added Kosher salt to the oil and garlic to give it more flavor. I also covered the cauliflower for the first 20 minutes or so, because we like ours tender, not crunchy. With lots of black pepper and freshly grated Parm. Reggiano, this was awesome, almost like scampi. (I know that sounds weird, but the extra virgin olive oil and Parm. Regg., yum.) Next time I'm going to add a little crushed red pepper in with the oil and garlic. This recipe spiced up a dinner of turkey sandwiches.

I chose not to rate it since I omitted the parm., and I would imagine that's where the recipe's best flavor comes from. Still, after only using 1 T. oil and 1 T. low-fat butter substitute,  and adding red pepper flakes, basil, and seasoning salt, I would have to rate it a 4. I was still expecting blandness, but in the end, I was quite pleased!

Wow!  This was really good.  I made some changes that my husband loved.  I added some grated carrots, sliced mushrooms, and some leeks chopped small.  Also, I stirred in the parmesan cheese and (dried, didnt have fresh) parsley before baking, then I added 3 Tablespoons of milk (with a sprinkle of seasoning salt), and stirred every 10 minutes.  When cooked, I sprinkled mozzarella cheese over the top and broiled.  It was fabulous!

wonderful.  I even cut back to 2 tablespoons of oil and 1/4 cup of cheese to save on calories.  I also baked for 15 minutes at 425 covered and then 10 minutes at 450.

i DESPISE CAULIFLOWER.  Well, I USED to despise cauliflower.  This was the most delcious side dish I have ever enjoyed.  I will make it again, and again, and again.  I can't say enough to convince you to try this.  Even a child would eat this.  :)

My fiance hates cauliflower. He told me that the last time he tried cauliflower he spat it out. I made a deal with him to try it again if I could find a good recipe. I made this, and not only did he inhale what he had on his plate, he went back for seconds -- and thirds.

This was the best cauliflower recipe ever! My only complaint is my cauliflower head was too small so there was not enough. As far as covering versus not covering; I covered until the mid point. When I uncovered it to stir, I left it uncovered. It was perfect!

I will never be able to eat steamed cauliflower again! This recipe is so easy and so delicious.  The only thing I changed was to put the garlic and oil in a bowl and then toss in the cauliflower -- that way you don't lose any garlic in the bag.  DON'T cover the casserole -- that just causes steaming -- you want the roasted effect!

I've been exploring roasting many heretofore NOT explored veggies. Cauliflower is something I've liked in a variety of formats (stick blended to make Mac and Cheese)...but roasting makes it taste like vegetable candy. Also, 450 degrees is probably too hot.

I roast cauliflower all the time, but thought I'd try this recipe because of the high reviews. I didn't need nearly that much oil, and think it would be way too greasy if I had used the stated amount. The flavors were nice together, but I agree with the reviewers who said that by the time the cauliflower was tender the garlic was starting to burn a bit. My initial feeling was to add the garlic at the halfway mark, but decided to follow the directions (after all, this was much easier), and am sorry I did. I also didn't understand the need to use a bag, so I just mixed the ingredients in a bowl and poured them onto a foil lined baking sheet. I may combine these flavors again, but will probably add the garlic further into the cooking process. Finally, I found 450* to be a bit too high, 400 worked very well for me.

This is the BEST cauliflower I have ever prepared/eaten!!  The second time we made it we added a sprinkle of Mrs. Dash = a YUMMY variation!  Next time, we will add a dash of Lemon pepper!  The possibilities for this dish are endless!!

It's amazing what roasting can do to a vegetable, taking it from "ho-hum" to "wow!" I definitely recommend giving this a dish a try (or 2 or 3); it has become a staple in my regular meal rotation. The flavors make a wonderful side-dish to any number of meals and you'll find yourself wanting to have this dish again and again.

I made this exactly as described, except didn't bother with the whole bag-mixing step, just mixed everything right in the baking pan.  I also didn't bother broiling at the end, just cooked it a little longer (maybe 40 minutes total).  The cauliflower was perfectly browned without being burnt.  And, I used sea salt and dried parsley flakes instead of fresh parsley.  Will definitely be making this again, although I may try to cut down to 2 tbs oil to cut out some calories.  This was hands-down the best cauliflower I've ever had, although it does make it a little less healthy than my normal plain, steamed cauliflower.

Very good.  I also lowered the oven to 400 degrees.  I can't imagine why anyone would even think about covering this as you would end up with steamed cauliflower.

Great recipe! I used the instructions as guidelines rather than following it exactly. I mixed the cauliflower with olive oil, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper in the bag (didn't measure any of them exactly) and baked as suggested. I will definitely be making this again.

I think I make this at least once a week now. My family and I enjoy this very much.  I followed the recipe except for the temperature/time.  I have a convection bake oven so I cooked at 425 for 10 mins, removed and stirred then put back in for another 10 mins.  I removed from the oven stirred and sprinkled with shredded parm and put back in the oven for another 5 mins.  This was so delicous.  My husband usually doesn't like anything with cheese but it is such a mild flavor enhancer that he didn't notice and still loved them. I don't think I can eat cooked cauliflower any other way again.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Wonderful spin on a great vegetable.  I agree with others, toss in a big mixing bowl & turn out onto baking dish. ADD onion flakes & other spices as desired.  Before broiling, mix Panko crumbs & the parmesan. Sprinkle generously!!! And broil as directed.  SO GREAT.. So FEW CALORIES!!!!!
Thanks, Shellery

I avoided buying cauliflower for more than 10 years because I was the only one in my household who would eat it. Well, this recipe converted my 4 cauliflower-hating children into cauliflower lovers!!! They now insist that we buy cauliflower whenever we're out grocery shopping.

I read the other reviews about roasting at 400 and I'm glad I did, some of the pieces were blackened even at the lower temp. Was a little lacking in flavor, next time I will double the garlic and add other spices.

Fantastic! I skipped the cheese and it was tasty without it. I followed the advice of many and put the florets in a bowl and drizzled the oil and garlic in and mixed it by hand. I spread it on a cookie sheet and baked at 400. I used purple cauliflower because it was so cool looking at the store! (Unlike most vegetables that lose their unusual color when cooked, the purple got darker when roasted!) Really great! Kids even liked it.

I could eat this all the time...  To make it even faster I now steam the cauliflower in the microwave first (frozen works great too!) then roast it.  Because it doesn't need to roast for as long the garlic doesn't get burned.

This was such a simple, and different, way to cook cauliflower. I usually just steam it, but I wanted to try the new purple cauliflower and didn't want to steam it, since the nutrients are so water soluble. I followed other reviewers suggestions, and covered the casserole dish for the first 20 minutes, then uncovered, added cheese and broiled. Next time I use purple cauliflower, I'll cut back my cooking time since it cooks so much faster than the regular. Will definitely be using this recipe again.

Very flavorful! A nice change to the steamed cauliflower I usually make and easy to prepare. I mixed in a large bowl, not a ziploc bag.  Perfect doneness; but I did let it sit for five minutes before broiler step while waiting for other dinner items to cook.  Great complement to my grilled flank steak.

This recipe rocks. We had our first freeze of the winter and I had to go out and immediately harvest all of my fall broccoli and cauliflower, which was looking a bit stressed. This recipe turned average vegetables into something EXTRAORDINARY! I used a metal pan instead of casserole dish, so the florets browned nicely without having to turn on the broiler. I recommend finishing it off w/ a squeeze of lemon. Bravo!

This was a very easy and delicious recipe.  My family hog-scarfed it.  I added extra parmesan cheese because we are big fans of it.  Will definitely serve again.

This is my new favorite recipe!  Delicious!  Next time I will double everything as one head of cauliflower wasn't nearly enough for us.  I will never make cauliflower any other way again!

This isn't a bad recipe, just kinda bland in flavor.  Without a dip, double or triple the shredded cheese for taste!  I kept the pan covered the whole way through and baked on 400 - the steam with cook and soften the cauliflower, but do stir otherwise burning will occur!

Just made this and snuck a taste as I was dishing it up. OMG!!!!! SO good. Made it exactly as written except a sprinkle of dried parsley instead of fresh. Didn't cover at all, no problem with burning. Wonderful!!!!

I am a fan of cauliflower, so I am predisposed to this recipe. I used the oil and garlic, covered it and cooked it stirring once in the middle. Wonderful. I tried it before the cheese and thought it was so good that I didn't add the cheese. Next time I might use less oil ( I didn't measure it). I also double/tripled the garlic as usual and wow was it strong. The dish has this wonderful roast garlic flavor that is so addicting.

Incredibly good, given how fantastically easy to prepare.  Substituted dried chives for fresh parsley.  Cook Time is actually 28-30.

Oh, my goodness, this was delectable.  Hard to beleive it's a vegetable!  This will become a regular in the meal rotation and for special meals.  I let it get a bit brown, and the "crunchies" were delicious.    Be prepared that they shrink in size by probably about 50%. Keep the pieces on the big side for nicer presentation. I had about 1/3 of a head for 2 of us and we would have liked a bit more.    I LOVE cheese...so it pains me to say this, but it really doesn't need the parmesan.  I forgot to put it on before serving, and probably won't bother to next time, either.    Oh, don't be worried about the large amount of oil...a lot of it sticks to the bag and there is a lot in the bottom of the baking dish...I can't imagine very much is actually on the florets.    Top it off with a sprinkling of sea salt...:-)

I made this last night and everyone around the table loved it. I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic because I was concerned it would overbrown and make the dish bitter. I also added some broccoli because I had it on hand. Omitted the parsley because I didn't think it was necessary. There was no need to waste a plastic bag, either. Just dump all the ingredients into the pan and mix with your hands. This is a terrific winter side dish!

This was wonderful! I love caulifower and wanted a new way to prepare it. My daughter didn't care for it but she doesn't care for garlic much. I did add a lil onion and garlic powder to the mix but other than that and adjusting temperature at which it cooked and extending cooking time, that's all I changed. Very yummy!

This was wonderful.  Add the garlic during the end of cooking time or it will burn.  I am always looking for ways to get fresh vegetables on the table that people will eat.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This  was a  good  dish. Simple to make. I'll be honest, I most likely to not make it again, I like broccoli much better than cauliflower but I'm not regretting that I made this. You try it.

Cauliflower can put off alot of water which can drown the other flavors.  I've done this similarly in a pan using olive oil, and a bit of butter.  Salt the florets, toss to coat, turn down heat to medium low and cover.  When tender but not mushy, Drain off excess water leaving just a little wet in pan; Add garlic (fresh or roasted), parmesan and just a sprinkling of bread crumbs, retoss and heat for just a few more minutes.  Everyone loves this.

I love cauliflower and have always steamed it, well now I will be making it this way, it was great. The only change I made was to mix the cauliflower with the ingredients in the bowl I was making it in, there was not enough room in the bag. I also didnt put it under the broiler, I didnt need to, it browned up real nice in my nesco oven.  Its to hot here in Mich. to put on the broiler. I did add some salt and you can really put what ever spices you want to.

This is pretty good for a simple cauliflower side dish.  The high oven temp will cause the garlic to burn, so I'd suggest a lower temp: 375 - 400 should be fine.  We do love the garlic & cheese flavor w/ the cauliflower.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful!  I left out the parsley because I just don't keep it on hand, and I didn't cook it any more after adding the parmesan.  I've also made this recipe with broccoli instead of cauliflower many times, and it is a great side dish either way!  Also, I usually slice the garlic rather than mincing, because I like the way it crisps up and makes crunchy garlic chips.

This is definitely one I'll use again. Much better than the old cheese sauce routine. Thanks Shellery!

Nice way to eat cauliflower. I lowered the temprature to 390 - in a convection oven. I just had the parmesan in the can and dried parsley, but it was still really good and done in 25 minutes.

I changed this recipe a little... 
On my first try : I only used 2 tbs of Parmesan cheese, I added 1 pinch of red pepper flakes, 1/4 cup italian bread crumbs and 1 tbs of dried parsley (didn't have it fresh). I didn't grease the casserole dish. I placed the olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes in the dish and tossed in the cauliflower. Topped it with bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and parsley after cooking for 25 min., and broiled on low until golden brown. My bf who doesn't like vegetables liked this recipe.
The second time: I used 2 tbs olive oil, 0.5 tbs pesto, 1 tbs balsamic vinegar and I omitted the parmesan and parsley.
I preferred my second attempt at this recipe!

This is an excellent way to prepare cauliflower.  I like my food a little spicy, so I added a 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder to the mix and it is now my favorite way to have it.

I have made this several times to use up a head of cauliflower or as a side dish. It couldn't be easier or faster! The only downside (and for me it's a big one) is that the dish is HORRIBLE to scrub afterward. Next time I'll try lining with foil first.

Delicious - my husband loved it and he can be picky.  I used forzen cauliflower that I cooked in the microwave for about 5 minutes before roasting.  I also used a lot more garlic, because we love garlic.

I must admit I was sceptical about roasting the cauliflower but it turned out perfectly cooked (as long as you like your veg with some "bite").  I added some broccoli as well which was lovely.  Next time I would try what other reviewers suggested, to add the garlic further into the cooking so it ooesn't burn and get bitter.

Due to a meal with too much garlic I chose to make this without the garlic. I just used a little onion powder and a little garlic powder. Followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. Everyone LOVED it!!

I love cauliflower any which way so loved this.  After 15 minutes I added a good 2 cups of packaged julienned carrots and then stirred.  Used a covered casserole and didn't broil.  The kids ate it up.  I wish I had done 2 heads so there were some leftovers to toss into the weekly pasta bowl.

I've always HATED cauliflower, even when soaking in cheese sauce to disguise the flavor.  But, I've got to say, this is delicious!  I even went back for a second helping.  I prepared it exactly per the recipe, no changes & it was great!  My mom couldn't believe it when I said I was actually eating cauliflower now!  Thanks!

Absolutely fabulous!  Even my non-veggie eating boys loved it.  I turned the oven temp down to 400 to avoid burning the garlic and took another reviewers advice to mix it all up in a bowl, instead of the ziploc bag.  Otherwise followed as directed with a GREAT result!

I think this is the best way I've ever eaten cauliflower, I loved it. My cauliflower was already pretty browned by the end of the 25 minutes, so instead of broiling after sprinkling on the cheese and parsley, I just let it bake for a few more minutes. Great recipe!

Wow, and I didn't think I liked Cauliflower.  We got some from our CSA, so I thought I'd try to cook it.  I used this recipe since it was one of the few on the site with little or no dairy.  In fact, I omitted the parmesan cheese, and it still came out fabulously.  I may actually purposely buy cauliflower now.  This was delicious and EASY!

Was great!  I made it without the parsley just because I didn't have any, but it would be wonderful with parsley as well.  I also covered it for half of the time it was in the oven so the garlic didn't burn.  Very good!

This was delicious!  I made a couple of changes that made it a little healthier, and this is definitely making it into my rotation of dinners.  First of all, I only added less than 1/4 cup of parmesan and a little less oil and I didn't grease the pan.  I also ommitted all of the salt.  Also, I just mixed it all together before I put it into the oven covered and stirred it once during cooking.  This made it super simple and the taste was wonderful.  I have also made this when you add the cheese and parsley on top at the end and broil it and it was good but it didn't reheat well the next day.  Also, for the calorie and sodium difference I would much rather do it my way.  This tastes very indulgent without a lot of calories, almost like garlic mashed potatoes!

I made this and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly but added some grated cheddar cheese on top with the parmesan and parsley.  It was a nice change from the usual steamed cauliflower with cheese sauce.  Wonderful recipe!

This was very easy to make. These are my changes:  I boiled the cauliflower for a few minutes with the fresh parsley, drained, and then added the olive oil and garlic.  For the parmesan cheese I added almost the equal amount of bread crumbs to it and sprinkled it over the cauliflower.  It is a very nice dish to make and smells wonderful while baking.

A Keeper!  So simple and it went so well with my roast beef which I was cooking at 450 degrees for 25 min. and then lowered to 375.  I took the cauliflower out after 25 min. - let it sit.  When the roast beef was done to our liking I took that out and popped the cauliflower with the cheese mixed in (used another reviewer's suggestion for that- it turned out well) and broiled it while I was making the gravy.  The garlic flavor in the cauliflower was super!  That and the mashed potatoes with gravy made a nice, quick Sunday meal.

My kids like Cauliflower but this made them love it. I have three kids from 5 yrs to 11 yrs old and they could not stop asking for more. This is the first time there hasn't been leftovers. Great taste and easy to do.

This was a fair amount of work to prepare without much of a result.  I don't know, the garlic tasted terrible cooked this way - it got that "funny" taste.  I probably wouldn't go to the trouble of making this dish again, but if I did I would omit the garlic entirely.  Maybe different spices could be used in its place, along with the parmesan.

Love, love, love this! So easy and so many variations in flavor (if you wish) my go-to is this with more garlic and I juice about half a lemon over the top when it is done and in the serving dish. Sometimes I'll add some ground red pepper in the bag for an extra kick!

Cooked cauliflower is something I rarely make, unless I also make cheese sauce.  But, much to our surprise, we loved this!  I used the method described in the original recipe and it came out perfect; no burning.  The only thing I did differently was to skip the plastic bag for tossing the cauliflower with oil/garlic, and just tossed in the 13x9 pan with my hands (which already smelled garlicky).  That way I didn't lose any of the delicious garlic bits. Thank you for sharing!

Mine came out kinda dry. I was sleepy when making dinner and not at my best. I do think it has potential will have to try again. I feel it need some creamy sauce tho but that's just me.

Really good recipe. Nice and quick to make and also a nice healthy option to substitute for potatoes at the dinner table!! just added 2 more cloves of garlic because you can never get enough in my opinion. This one's a keeper

Delicious! I rinsed the cut-up cauliflower and let it dry really well, covered a baking sheet with foil, spread out the cauliflower, drizzled with just enough olive oil to moisten, added salt, herbes de provence and fresh cracked black pepper, mixed it all up with clean hands and roasted at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, stirring about halfway and keeping an eye on it so it gets browned and crisps up on the outside. We like a crisper, more well-done cauli. I always burn garlic when I try to add it to roast vegetables, so I left it out, but would use granulated garlic if I was going for some garlic flavor. Try this - you will fall in love with cauliflower!

Who needs fries when you can have roasted cauliflower. So nutty and garlicky (and low-carb to boot)! Betcha it'd be pretty with yellow, purple, and green cauliflower, too.

This was amazing.  Only changes:  mixed garlic, evoo, salt and lemon pepper together and let marinade before tossing with cauliflower.  Also finished with a squeeze of lemon.  Probably the best cauliflower I've ever had.

Delicious and easy. I did reduce the heat to 425 and covered it for the first 10-12 minutes. If that means it's not truly "roasted," then okay. It would have burned in my oven otherwise.

I put the cauliflower in a foil lined ceramic baking dish at 350 degrees for 40 minutes turning halfway then added Parmesean and put back in the oven for 5 minutes...no broiler. I also cooked chicken and roasted sweet potatoe slices at 350 and worked for all 3 dishes.

Followed directions with the following changes: 425 degrees instead of 450.  Used broccoli and cauliflower, added about 1/2 c of chopped onions and upped the garlic to 8-10 cloves.  Turned out wonderful!

I roasted the cauliflower for 12 minutes covered at 400 degrees and 13 minutes uncovered, I sprinkled some Italian seasoning before roasting and then followed the rest of the recipe. It was delicious, still a little crispy!

Cooked this tonight after my 11 yr old daughter has been raving about the cauliflower a friend's mother cooked.  This was my first time ever trying, and it turned out great. She said it's even better than Ms. Lisa's! Can't get much higher praise than that I guess. :)  Thanks for sharing.  Will do it again.

I've been making cauliflower like this for years and absolutely love it when prepared this way. To make it Paleo-friendly, I've omitted the cheese but added extra garlic to boost up the flavor and add to the browning. I also use this recipe for making broccoli and Brussel  sprouts. I prefer to bake the florets on a cookie sheet for 10-15 minutes at 350F, then broil them for 5 minutes or less, turning florets as needed. Even my husband, who only eats cauliflower with cheese sauce (LOTS of cheese sauce) ate them. I ate the leftovers as snacks the next day - yummy and VERY filling!

This is SO good!  I used frozen cauliflower that I cooked just until thawed in the microwave. It should be cold, but not frozen solid.  I have a convect ROAST function on my oven and the cauliflower came out perfect. I had tried it with convect BAKE before and it was kind of mushy.

I grilled mine in a grill basket, using garlic powder and garlic pepper to season instead of fresh garlic and parsley, and only 2 T of butter-flavored olive oil. I agree with reviewers who said to add the parmesan after cooking.

This is a fantastic way to prepare cauliflower.  Very flavorful and easy to prepare!  I changed nothing in the recipe, except for cutting it in half.  I also just mixed in a lidded bowl as opposed to a plastic bag.  I did not cover the dish while cooking and my cauliflower came out perfect!  Thanks for sharing this keeper, SHELLERY!

Made this the other night, just for some variety. Used canola oil as we had no olive oil. And grated parmesan. It was awesome! My daughter, who hates cauliflower, was caught snitching food from her brother's plate! Everyone loved it. Definitely a keeper. Although I personally would have liked a little more seasoning, that is cook's issue, as I probably could have used a little more. Maybe some onion powder, or paprika.

This is literally the BEST cauliflower dish that I've ever had and I love most cauliflower recipes. But this was so delicious, I ate most of it out of the casserole dish as it was cooling on the stove. And that was without Parmesan added!  SO GOOD!

We loved this!  A friend of mine told me to use a garlic press for the garlic (instead of using minced garlic,) and nothing on my dish scorched or burned at all.  Next time I would skip the bag and make this in a bowl as I could never get all of the juicy bits out of the bag.  Also I must have had a big head of cauliflower and could not use a casserole dish but used a large cookie sheet instead.  For the cooking time, my same friend advised me to cook this in (3) 10 minute intervals, shaking or stiring up the cauliflower each time, adding the parmasan cheese in the last 10 minutes (I also cooked it quite close to the top of the oven just under the top rack at 450 degrees as stated...truely ROASTED CAULIFLOWER!!... not steamed at all, I did not cover this.)  It couldn't have turned out more perfect. I'll be making this ALOT!  Thank you!!

I wish I hadn't read all the reviews first and cooked as originally written.  That being said, what I did was change recipe slightly by using 2 Tbs reg olive oil and 1 Tbs jalapeno infused olive oil. I lowered the heat to 425 and covered the dish for the first 20 min.  it was undercooked, so stirred and left uncovered for another 10.  stirred and let cook another 5.  FINALLY got the little roasted spots I was looking for.  Threw on some parmesan and it was pretty amazing.

This was so good & super easy to make.  I tossed everything in a large bowl, rather than using a bag, otherwise following all the directions. Two of us almost finished the entire head of cauliflower!  I will be adding this to my regular rotation.

Absolutely amazing way to prepare cauliflower. Kids even ate it.  No need to pour orange processed cheese over our cauliflower anymore.  Would make again!

Really delicious way to prepare cauliflower! Instead of a casserole dish, I spread the cauliflower out on a cookie sheet and reduced the cooking time by 5 minutes. I sprinkled the parmesan cheese and parsley on top and put it under the broiler for 3 minutes. Spreading it out on the cookie sheet meant that each piece was slightly brown and crispy.

I made this tonight.  I was looking for a recipe that I had all the ingredients for and could use up a head of cauliflower that I bought.  This was delicious. I did not have the parsley, but will use next time.  
I cut the florets as uniformly as possible, and put them in a large bowl.  I then used my garlic press to press the garlic into 3 Tbs olive oil and poured it over them.  I mixed them well and then spread them in a pan to roast at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.  I put the Parmesan over them and left them in the oven until it was melted and browned.
My 14 yo looked at the recipe and said "gross", but after one bite he said "this is delicious!"  Will make again and again!  Thanks!

Roasted cauliflower is my family's favourite cooked vegetable which I've made for years.  We do two things differently.  Instead of salt and pepper, I use a bit of onion salt.  And sometimes after it has roasted, I mash or whip it until it has the consistency of rice before I add the cheese to broil.  This version is as big hit with kids who think they don't like vegetables.  We all love this, and it is healthy too!

I made this w/ a mixture of broccoli & cauliflower and it turned out great. I also baked covered in foil and removed the foil at the end right before I added the cheese. 5 stars, easy and yummy.

Excellent recipe. I par boiled the cauliflower (or you can microwave) for approx 6 mins, using cold water to start this process. I then roasted the veggies after seasoning. Perfectly roasted and nicely browned.

Simple, easy, and delicious.  Really brings out a richer, nuttier flavor of the cauliflower.  The only thing I changed was that I did not have fresh parsley, so I used dried and mixed it into the oil as best as I could.  Very tasty.

Excellent! I made this exactly as written and it turned out delish! I did not cover it (I wanted the roasted flavor vs. steamed) and it did not burn. You do need to watch it though, because I can see how it could easily happen. Flavors are perfect, wouldn't change a thing, even though next time I might just because I can... ;)

If I could give this 10 stars I could!  Before this recipe, I was the only one in the house that would eat cauliflower.  I have now made it 2 times in the last week just because the kids and hubby actually asked for it.  Shellery is a hero in my book for this recipe!!

My oh my, what a woderful way to eat cauliflower!  I could eat this everyday!  I didn't have parsley and didn't use salt & pepper either.  I tossed the rest in a bowl, extra garlic of course, and arranged the pieces on a parchment lined cookie sheet to roast without covering.  I only had the Kraft canister of parmesan which worked wonderfully.  Nothing burned and it had a nice cripsy texture.  I will make this often from now on!

I made mine with cajun seasoning instead of salt, and I chopped up a couple of red potatoes and threw them in the mix as well. I actually forgot to add the parmesan cheese and parsley (oops!), but I still think it tasted great! I heated the oil in a cast-iron dutch oven on a medium-high heat and then cooked it for just a minute, and then I just put the lid on and cooked it according to the directions. Very good!!!

Very good, and easy. I cut the oil down by 1/3 and added the fresh parsley halfway through cooking rather than right before broiling. I've also tried it with a pound of fresh broccoli florets instead of cauliflower, and I liked that even more; I mixed the broccoli version with an onion herb quinoa and it was amazing. Definitely a keeper, in either style.

Love this. I have made it many many times and it's always delicious. Sometimes I just mix the parmesean in and let it cook with the cauliflower. Also most of the time I leave out the parsley since I don't have it on hand. Still always delish!

Excellent recipe. Two thumbs up. My preference is to cook just a couple minutes less than 25 for a crisper texture. Just a preference...it's good both ways

I added some things to this delicious recipe. I had 2 (12) oz steam in the bag broccolli and cauliflower florets and used them. I added ground cumin, garlic powder, rosemary and very thinly sliced spanish onion to the other items in the shake and bake mix. Baked at the prescribed temp UNCOVERED. Stirred at 10 minutes. At the 20 minute mark, I took it out, added some sweet mini roasted peppers I had made several days earlier, mixed, put the parmesan and parsley on top. Broiled it for 5 more minutes, took it out and squeezed 1/2 a lemon on top. The broccolli added some nice color and texture, as did the mini peppers, which added some sweetness as well. (Trick: put lemon in microwave for 10 secs to make the juices flow). Serve over brown rice or whole grain angel hair pasta.

Excellent way to eat cauliflower. The only thing I did differently was to add a little thyme and oregano before baking. Turned out great.

Wow! This rocks! I made it with cauliflower and broccoli and used more olive oil than the recipe called for. I also added bread crumbs to the parm cheese and mixed it all in a big bowl. Roasted it in glass dish at 400 for about 45 mins. I covered it with foil for the first 30 mins and then uncovered for the remaining time. It went great with baked flounder and brown rice. I think this recipe would be great with carrots too! Thanks for sharing..so simple and delicious!

Not sure if it was me or the recipe, but the cauliflower never did get tender, even with cooking way longer than the 25 minutes stated.  Also, all the goodies didn't stick to the vegetables.

Not a fan.  It had a weird after-taste to it. Not sure if that was from the roasting process or the mixture.  Won't be trying again.

Wow! This recipe is awesome! I've never had cauliflower prepared this way and it blew me away. I'm definately keeping this one. I think fresh parsley is pretty important and I used and extra two tablespoons of olive oil when coating the cauliflower.

Roasted cauliflower is one of my favorite vegetables. Adding some garlic and parmesan makes it that much better. Sometimes when I make this recipe, I roast some cherry tomatoes as well. The combination of red tomatoes, green parsley and white cauliflower is gorgeous on the dinner plate.

I'm trying to branch out in my veggie group and even though I don't like cauliflower I decided to buy it and give it a try.  Well, I'm HOOKED.  My 9 year old daughter was upset when there wasnt enought for seconds!  Avoid burning the garlic by covering the dish with a lid or foil while baking.

I used dried parsley instead of the fresh parley, since that was all I had on hand. Good recipe, but wasn't too thrilled with the way parmesan turned out.

There was nothing wrong with this recipe. I enjoy cauliflower in many ways, but my son, age 7, doesn't typically. This recipe, however, changed that. He went back for multiple servings. Definitely a keeper! Thanks.

Yummy.  I took the advice of other reviewers and covered the cauliflower for the first half of the baking time and that cooked it nicely.  I'm sure it would have burnt otherwise because it had a nice carmelization and was sizzling loudly by the time the baking ended.  I skipped the parsley because I didn't have fresh and I was afraid the dried would burn.  This was an awesome, simple way to prepare cauliflower.

Love cauliflower and love garlic so gave this a try.  Only change I made was to reduce temperature to 400 degrees and to cover while baking as recommended in comments.  Very bland except for the garlic taste.  Also very dry.  Very dissapointing.

OMG! so delicious and easy! My roommates always comment on how delicious it smells baking, and the taste does not disappoint. Delicious over sausage/cranberry couscous and super easy to make.

Be sure to cut them into small florets for the baking time described. Also, baking with a lid or foil cover prevents scorching of the garlic. Thanks!

This is incredible! I'm not a big cauliflower fan but wanted to add something different to Thanksgiving this year and it was a hit - my brother abhors cauliflower and he ate most of it. I used 2 bags of frozen cauliflower, added extra garlic, and doubled the parm. This will be a regular veggie in our house. Thanks for sharing.

This is amazing. We make this at least once a week, and I have never been a big fan of cauliflower. My 18-month old who won't eat anything will eat the entire pan of this if we let her.

This was excellent.  I didn't change the ingredients at all, I just mixed it in a bowl instead of a bag and covered it with foil while baking (removed the foil for the broiler).  A great vegetable side dish that was super easy to prepare.  Very, very good!

Very, very good!  Definitely heed the warning of one of the reviewers to cover the casserole dish (I didn't).  It made my cook time longer, but the end result was still absolutely delicious!  In fact, that's all I needed for lunch today!  Thank you.

So great! This may be the only way I ever eat cauliflower again. PS--You can't add to much garlic, roasted with the oil and topped with Parmesan... MMMM... it doesn't get any better. PPS--Feel free to throw in any other veggies/root veggies you have have in the fridge.

I really never thought to roast cauliflower.  I roast a lot of veggies but never thought to these.  They really did turn out good.  I used frozen cauliflower cus that is what I had on hand.  That's the first time I have ever roasted frozen veggies instead of fresh.  I just thawed and mixed with olive oil and garlic and s/p.  I did not put the cheese on it, however I think that would be really good too.  My daughter after she ate her dinner and desert she went back and ate the rest of the cauliflower as a snack.  The kids really liked this..better then broccoli they said.

Brilliant idea on every level. Not only did I love it as written but I pureed the leftovers for a "potato" soup & it really made it shine. I like cauli. I'm shocked at myself. Thanks!:o)

This is how I roast my cauliflower, but I skip the resealable bag and just toss it all on the baking sheet.  I also add the juice of half a lemon for a little kick.  Yum!

My family loved these. I thought they were very good, but I think I wanted more of that steamed taste as opposed to roasting. My family says otherwise so I'm outnumbered for the next time I make this, which I will. I did NOT cover them while baking which is why they have that roasted taste. I believe I would have preferred to have covered them for the majority of the cooking time to get a bit more of that steamed taste. This is all a matter of personal preference, though. Delicious either way, I'll bet. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Wonderful!  This had such good flavor!  I left out the parsley because I didnt have any and I mixed the cauliflower with broccoli.  I also cooked it at 375 covered for 25 mins then broiled because I had a chicken dish in the oven as well.  Turned out fabulous!  Will make over and over:)

I liked the recipe for how easy it was, cook and serve in the same dish.  My husband said, "This is the best cauliflower I've ever had."  Thank you for the recipe.

So good, my boyfriend and I ate all six servings in 1 sitting, in addition to our main course!  I used reduced-fat Parmesan and 1T dried parsley instead of fresh.  That's just what I had on hand; I'm not sure it made any difference in the flavor.

This was delicious. However, I had to almost double the cook time to get the cauliflower tender. ( And I mean not rock hard) The flavor was amazing though. Next time I'd steam until firm and then cook in the oven.

This was pretty good. I added the parsley before cooking, and didn't bother with mixing the cauliflower in the bag. Overall, it worked really well and my husband liked it.

Delicious.  Simple.  Easy.  I was heavy on the garlic and the parsley.  Only had about 1/2 the parmesan on hand so also grated asiago and tiny bit of romano to compensate.  I forgot to add S&P and it didn't matter.  I cooked it in a glass meatloaf dish at 400 covered for 15 mins. mixed, 10 minutes, 10 minutes uncovered and  tossed and then 4 minutes under the broiler, turned it off and let it sit for a bit in the hot oven. So delicious.

This was a nice change for cauliflower (even though I forgot the Parm!) and will definitely make it again.  I do the same for brocolli and like that it draws out some of the moisture and condenses the flavors.

I made this recipe twice. The first time I steamed the cauliflower till it was fully cooked then followed the directions except for it baked for only 12 minutes and broiled for 2-4. The second time I put the cauliflower in the oven raw as per the directions. Both times were very good but I preferred the cooking/steaming the cauliflower first. That way it was absolutely delicious and the garlic didn't burn so much.

Wow, just as almost everyone else has said, this is amazingly delicious. Hubby and I felt like it was a treat not a vegetable that we had to force ourselves to eat! I made half a recipe for just the two of us so I cooked it at 425 for 20 minutes then added the parmesan (no parsley) and broiled for five minutes. Make sure to grease the baking sheet or maybe try cooking on tin foil to make cleanup easier. The broiled parmesan is NOT easy to get off an ungreased pan and cooking spray was not a good substitute as I found out the hard way! LOL  We will eat this many times in the future! Thanks so much for this easy and yummy recipe. Update: I actually made this again the very next day! I used tin foil on a baking sheet and sprayed the tin foil with cooking spray before spreading the vegetables on it, worked like a charm for same taste with easier cleanup!!

This is the best cauliflower I have *ever* had. The cheese made it so crispy and the garlic was so great...I think I really added 6 cloves because you can never have too much garlic. I may try without the parmesan next time just to save on calories. Thank you for this beautiful recipe!

Personally, I thought this was a bit TOO garlicky but my partner -- the garlic lover -- took a bite, sighed, and said "I'm in heaven." So, I'm giving it 5 stars! Very easy to make.

Excellent and so easy!  Definitely use fresh garlic--I left the garlic cloves whole (I usually use the minced garlic in a jar, but I was going for the whole roasted garlic like I've had in a restaurant).  I agree that you could also cut the oil down.  I think I'll add some different spices next time--maybe red pepper flakes.

This was delicious! I actually prepared the cauliflower the night before and let it marinate in the garlic/olive oil mixture and then just roasted it for dinner the next night. I covered it with tin foil to roast it at 450 and then removed the tin foil to broil it for the last few minutes. I served it at a dinner party, and everyone loved it!

Loved it!  Cauliflower is not my favorite veggie, but I will eat it more often with this recipe.  I took this dish to Thanksgiving dinner and the pan was emptied.  I modifed the amount of oil (watching my calories)and increased the garlic.  It tastes great!

We love this recipe and make it about once or twice a month now.  I don't change one thing.  It's perfect.  I've also used frozen cauliflower when I didn't have fresh.  I just thawed it out and drained the water off of it beforehand.

We really enjoyed this.  I'm always looking for healthy ways to fix veggie sides, and this fit the bill.  Probably used less oil than called for and used dried parsley instead of fresh, but otherwise it was fantastic!  Next time I may cut back on the garlic or use garlic powder instead - some bites were overpowering with garlic.  I can't wait to make this again!  Thanks!

I am a cauliflower lover, so I was really looking forward to trying this.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular by any means.  I used twice the amount of garlic called for and I still found it lacking flavor.  Sorry, this looked very promising but it just didn't work for me.

I followed the recipe nearly to the letter.  I added a few dashes of garlic powder and onion powder to the oil mixture, as well as the parsley.  I tossed the cauliflower in a bowl (much easier to scrape out all the yummy seasonings) and I didn't use any parmasean cheese (don't like it).  The results were fabulous!  I normally do this in the microwave with a little margarine in a gallon size zip loc bag (5-8 minutes on high).  This was divine!  Thanks!

I tried this recipe to introduce myself and family to cooked cauliflower.  My husband and I loved it!  I will try it with different herbs the next time I make it.

This was very easy and delicious.  It was nice to find a less "cheesy" cauliflower recipe.  I have made this several times.

This is easy, delicious, and healthy.  I served it with Crystal's Chicken Saltimbocca (also from this site), and they went really well together.  Instead of mixing the ingredients in a seperate bag, I just added the cauliflower to the casserole dish, topped with the olive oil, garlic, etc. and mixed really well by hand.  Turned out just fine and was well coated.

This is a wonderful.  I made a couple of changes.  I added bacon bits, minced onions and 3 tab. ranch dressing to mixture. I baked it for 15 minutes to brown, then added cheddar cheese, & paprika and covered with foil.

This was simple and delicious. I added a little lemon juice and left out the cheese just to be healthier.  My daughter and I loved it but next time I will not cook it as long because I like it with a little bite to it.

My family, accustomed to cauliflower only as a raw hors d'oeuvre, went back for seconds! I did increase the amount of olive oil -- the cauliflower was a giant -- and also followed suggestions to cover the baking dish with foil. Excellent dish, a real winner.

I chose this recipe, only because cauliflower was on sale at our grocery store.  Wow!  It is reeeeally good.  I added some shredded cheddar prior to broiling, and it was a great addition.  I went to pull out the left overs the next day, and they were gone.  Yay!  The family loves it!

Oh so good! I came home from work and realized I needed to do something with the rest of my cauliflower before it goes bad. I thought of just steaming it, but since I don't really like cauliflower in the first place I thought I'd pop in and find a better way to prepare. I took one glance at this and headed back to the kitchen -- it was that easy...hardly anything to remember, 5 minutes to prepare, in the oven and out in time for dinner. Delicious! I think I may actually  eat more cauliflower now.

As far as cauliflower goes this was great. I added about 1/4c. water to bottom of the pan and loosely covered with foil to avoid burning (which also softened the veggies too). I also tried sprinkling onion soup mix over it, which was delicious. You could do this from scratch with granulated beef boullion, onion powder and onion flakes.

This recipe is awesome and an easy way to make cauliflower.  I used fresh parmesan cheese(the best taste) and added extra at that.  They were cooked perfect and tasted fabulous.  Will make again and again this way.

I love this recipe.  I want to try it with every vegetable I can. As for alterations, I added rosemary and black pepper.  I didn't find the temp too high - I liked the crispy edges the bit of charring made.  I forgot all about stirring it but it didn't make a difference. Quick, easy, awesome.  A+

Very delicious!  However, I found it needed to be stirred every 5 minutes to keep from burning.  I used 2 tblsp. oil and didn't find it oily at all. I also added 1/4 cup water in the beginning to help it steam.  Once it evaporated, it browned nicely and after 25 minutes in the oven, I covered it with foil and let it rest on the counter 15 minutes to steam in the pan.  I will make this again for sure.

This was soo good! I was making it for only myself so I used half a head of cauliflower, added WAY more garlic because I love it-probably like 5 cloves and also threw in some baby carrots. I covered it for about 20 mins then took the foil off and cooked for 10 mins more @ 375 degrees. I then added parm. cheese with some panko bread crumbs and crumbled that on top to broil for 3 mins.
It was soo filling, healthy, and tasted fabulous!! Oh and it also smelled amazing!! I will def. make this again!! :)

It was easy and good, but not THAT special. Maybe I'll add in more flavoring next time I make it, and maybe a dash of white wine. Cauliflower is a pretty bland vegetable itself, but this recipe will be a good start.

Absolutely wonderful! I'm not a big cauliflower eater so finding a recipe that makes it tasty is great. I was low on parmesan cheese but had some asiago so I mixed it with the parmesan & it was great. I also added just a little bit of basil & oregano in with the cheese. I am going to try & making half cauliflower & half broccoli next time.

I was suprised how good this was.  As others said, the garlic burnt a tiny bit but that didnt adversley affect the taste.  I used purple cauliflower plus a few florets of broccoli.  I also added some fresh basil and a tiny Cayenne - fantastic, will definitely make again.

I make this with broccoli (I have tried it with cauliflower and that is good too) and asparagus when it's in season.  It's my favorite side dish to make hands down, and I would (and have) recommended it to others.  Thank you for the nice recipe - I love finding new ways to jazz up veggies!

Oh my, this was a nice surprise! I was kinda skeptic about all that garlic but gosh, this tasted GREAT with a piece of steak marinated in red wine!:D

PS: I used a LOT of cheddar cheese and left out the parmesan(didn't have any)! It was yummy!

My husband hates cauliflower...hates it, hates it,  hates it.  He loves this dish.  For our own personal taste (husband likes it soft), we cook cauliflower in the micro a bit before we put in the oven.

so unbelievable delicious.
I dont like cauliflower boiled, or steamed, but roasted with the garlic is amazing. 5 stars - so easy and healthy.

OMG This was soooo good!  I too added some bread crumbs, and just left it in an extra 5 minutes instead of putting it under the broiler.  Came out nice and crunchy.  We'll be making this one all the time!!!

I made this with broccoli instead of couliflower, because that's what I had... it was soooo good!! Me and my boyfriend love garlic so this is a great recipe! I may have used more garlic than called for, but it's good for you so it's okay :}

EXCELLENT!!!  This is so good and so simple.  My boyfriend doesn't like raw garlic so I roasted the whole garlic bulb first then mashed the cloves. I then tossed the mashed cloves with the olive oil and cauliflower. YUMMY!

My wife hates cauliflower but loved this.  I didn't have parsley on hand either, but it was still great w/o--it's so easy I will definitely make it with some frequency.  I was surprised to see some reviews thinking it was too garlicky.  I would consider adding a bit more, or at least leaving it alone.  Thanks for this one!

I wouldn't make this again.  I felt sketched out about the baking instead of boiling and it turned out I was right.  Maybe you were supposed to boil first and that just wasn't included in the directions?  They were dry and crunchyish and just tasted oily and garlicky -- which I suppose is exactly what they were.

My other half looked at me when I told him I was making this and point blank refused to eat it. I ate half of it, and thought it was pretty good- he had some and though that it was edible. I added breadcrumbs to the cheddar cheese, but also found that it doesn't turn crisp when broiled. My dish needed more time in the oven, so I nuked it in the microwave, then returned it with cheese on top, and it turned out fine.

My only complaint is that it didn't brown under the broiler... but that's probably because I got impatient (and hungry!) because it smelled good.  I used an oil mister, which cut down on the amount of oil required and made the dish even healthier.  Very good!

Great recipe for roasted cauliflower, I baked it on a sheet pan, otherwise exactly as written, and it turned out perfect.  If you cover it as some reviewers stated it would be steamed.

This turned out pretty good. It needed more umph tho for my taste. I think next time I’ll add more garlic. Also, it roasted pretty quick so I wasn’t able to broil the cheese...that would have been super delish if I could have done it without burning everything. Next time I’ll cut the roasting time to allow time to broil the cheese.

I'd put this in my rotation.  Generally appealing.  I'd go heavy-handed with the garlic and parmigiano.  I think it might be nice with the addition of raisins and pine nuts.  I happened to have dried cranberries and pistachios on hand, so I threw some of them in my portion and it was good.  It's a pretty plainish base, so you can take it any direction you want.

Since making this a first time, my family keeps asking for it over and over. I tried adding some Italian seasoning and a few of my family members liked it, so now I make 1/2 with Ital seasoning and 1/2 without to please everyone. I also bought gourmet garlic from our local farmers market and German Red Garlic was the best tasting for this recipe. I bought it from Krebs Pleasant View Farms - check them out!  Who knew there were different varieties of garlic?

shook it up in a bag of olive oil, garlic, seasoning salt and baked on a baking sheet for 1/2 hour at 400 degrees. 
 Sprinkled some parm on last few minutes.  Perfect!

I have made this recipe several times. My family and I LOVE this! This is by far our favorite way to eat cauliflower. I have never added the parsley as I have not had it on hand. I may use a bit more cheese than suggested, I don't measure the cheese! I toss the cauliflower, oil and garlic together in a bowl. No need to use a plastic bag. Ditch the plastic habit as much as possible! Also, I don't cover the dish while cooking at all, turns out fine! GREAT recipe!!

Very similar to a dish I had in Spain.I  used spray oil in the casserole dish and  tossed cauliflower & garlic with oil when it was in the dish. Also used some cheddar (but not a lot) to top  along with the Parmesan to cut down on cost. This one will be used again.

Really good and easy.  
Followed the recipe exactly and it was really good.  No problems with burning as others had complained.  However, I did roast at 400 degrees instead of the recommended higher temperature.

I used Avocado oil, not olive oil. and used minced fresh garlic in the bag as suggested. I roasted it on foil on a backing sheet at 400 and turned them at 20 minutes. Longer would have burned them on middle rack. At time of turn added large parmesan flakes and dried parsley.  Turned the oven off and returned them to the oven for 5-10 minutes. They were awesome.

I loved this as it makes a change from the usual cauliflower cheese. It's much healthier and tastes great. I did cook it a bit longer on a lower temp, but didn't cover it. I like crispy edges

Good stuff! My son, who said he didn't like cauliflower, loved it.
I forgot the parmesan cheese, but was still good.  One improvisation: My wife had just softened some bell pepper and onion in a skillet to go on pizza, so I took the melted butter that it was cooked in and drizzled it over the cauliflower before broiling it at the end...a few extra calories, but good flavor!

Follow the directions and do not put a lid on the pot/pan - as someone who tried the recipe did. Lid = Mush. However, if the heat is too high, just reduce to 400 or 375 degrees and put on the top uppermost rack in the oven. Experimentation is one of the mothers of invention! I left out the parm. cheese and after it was baked enough, I added approx. 1/3 cup shredded med. cheddar and let it melt on top for about 7 minutes. Also very tasty.

Heck you don't even need this much Oil, and the Garlic and Parm are optional at my house!!!  Just use the non-stick foil for the best results with limited oil and a few shakes of Seasoned Salt.

I drop the temp to 350F, cooking for 15 minutes then turning the florets and cooking for another 15 minutes. Don't cover, you'll end up with something completely different!!

I would have given 5 stars, but I had to make a few changes. I didn't want to cover it because it would get mushy, I wanted it roasted, but I know from experience cooking at 450 was going to burn it.  I preheated oven to 375 and I covered my baking pan with foil and sprayed with oil,  cooked the cauliflower uncovered until it was tender and golden brown, about 30 minutes depending on how big the pieces are  and it was firm with a lovely nutty taste.

I have been using this recipe for years. Learned this cooking method in an Italian cooking class. It is now the only way I cook cauliflower. Have also used broccoli. Broccoli not nearly as good as the cauliflower .

Modified it a bit... Being in the Outer Banks I added brown sugar and Old Bay. The brown sugar added a nice crisp and the old bay always adds a nice flavor. Had a salty sweet zing with the garlic.

I made this tonight and was very impressed, after reading the many reviews I ended up changing up the method of cooking. Many people commented on that even after the hour + the cauliflower was still somewhat raw.  I put my cauliflower in an aluminium pie plate and poured chicken stock ( no sodium) to just cover the bottom and covered with foil. This created a steam that made the cauliflower cook faster, about 15-20 mins before i took it out of the oven i removed the foil and let it brown and the liquid reduce.  It was absolutely fantastic!  It has a mild nutty taste and it was not over done , it was still firm but cooked through. I grated some parm on top  and the reduced liquid became some what of an au jus  that  I spooned on top.  I was never a cauliflower eater until today, I will be making this again and again.......enjoy!

This was an easy delicious side dish that the whole family loved. I cooked it at 450 as directed and kept it uncovered as you should for roasted veggies. Rather than waste a ziplock bag, I mixed it all in a bowl. Will definitely make again!

Four stars for a yummy healthy recipe! A little too much parmesan cheese IMO, next time I will use less. The smaller pieces did start to burn a little and although I had read other reviews that said to cover them, I thought that would be more like steamed cauliflower so I left uncovered. Next time i will reduce the cooking time or temperature. Thank you!

This was my first time eating roasted cauliflower and it was delicious! I used the ingredients listed, mixed everything but the parsley and parmesan together on the roasting pan, and then baked it covered at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. At that point I removed the foil from the top, added the parsley and parmesan cheese and put it back in the oven for five minutes until the cheese was melted. We'll definitely be having this again!

We love roasted cauliflower and normally do a blue cheese version so this was a nice change. I subbed melted butter for the olive oil to complement the garlic flavour and it was perfect! Don't try to cook this covered as you will end up with steamed mushy cauliflower rather than a nice roasted crust.

Everyone loved this, even those who supposedly hate cauliflower. The only thing I did differently was use melted butter in place of the olive oil.

Don't have a broiler so I cooked @ 400 for 20 mins covered with foil, took it out to cook our chicken.   When the chicken was almost done I removed the foil added the cheese and put it back in the oven for about 5 to 10 mins.  I thought it was fantastic, husband said it tasted "like cauliflower and garlic" so he wasn't very impressed.   It's hard to find veggie recipes we both like so I wasn't surprised.  Will definitely make it again, he can make what he likes when he cooks!

I made this according to the recipe. You have to watch the cauliflower closely towards the end of baking because it has a tendency to burn, especially at the edges. I've also made it with chili pepper and garlic infused olive oil, but it's great with just regular olive oil, too. My whole family loves it. This is an easy and tasty way to eat a healthy food.

This recipe already looked mouthwatering and it tastes even better! It's simple and quick. I didn't bake it for as long as recommended for a more crunchier bite - my husband and I loved it! And instead of using minced garlic, I sprinkled the cauliflower with garlic powder, which still marinaded it very well. I will definitely try this recipe again!

A very flavorful and healthy take on cauliflower.  I normally do not enjoy this vegetable and took a chance with this recipe.  Not only did I love it, but my husband (who asked where the melted cheese was) ate two servings of it.  This will become a new side vegetable for me to use regularly!

I made this for my children who absolutely loved it. My 15 month old is very finicky with his vegetables, but he actually cried for more instead of throwing it from his highchair. I did follow advice and covered with foil for about 20 minutes. Also I used oregano instead of parsley and it turned out great.

The broiling of the cheese at the end just makes this garlic Cauliflower perfect.

I've been looking for different ways to make all the cauliflower that has mysteriously accumulated in my freezer.  Because I didn't have fresh cauliflower or garlic, I used frozen cauliflower and garlic paste.  It came out quite good.  I did not cover it up, like other users suggested, I wanted a more roasted look and flavor. The florets were firm enough to stay on the fork, but soft enough to eat easily.  The parsley was a good visual contrast.  The cheese added a little bite at the end.  It's a beautiful dish and the garlic smell is fabulous. This is great as is, or as a starting to add other ingredients!  This will be on the Thanksgiving table.

I didn't use as much Parmesan cheese because it was a lot, but it still came out great for what it is. I don't care too much for cauliflower but I would make this again. I baked it at 400 because I only had it at 450 for a few min before it started to burn. Then broiled it on low for the last few min.

Well I had no fresh parsley or garlic so I used a mixed seasoning, baked at 400, and tossed in the pan. But it's excellent! I added spaghetti sauce for a gluten-free meal.

Added some cut up red pepper & chopped fresh parsley.  Wasn't looking forward to burnt garlic, so I used some garlic powder. After 10min of cooking I added the chopped garlic and that worked out great.  Hubby loved this, I think it still needs a little something, will play with it some more. But thanks for the recipe, we will now be eating more cauliflower with our meal.

Easy, yummy recipe. I don't really like cauliflower but I enjoyed this dish. 

Make sure to use GOOD parmesan (grate your own, if possible). It makes a big difference in flavor. Oh, and the more garlic the better!

This was just OK. I thought it was bland. I think I left some of the florets too large because some of the smaller ones had more flavor.I am going to take the other reviewers advice and make a cold salad out of the leftovers. I think it will be better with Italian dressing.

Very tasty and flavorful recipe!  I only had a small/med. head of cauliflower so I should have cut the other ingredients.  But it still turned out yummy.  Will definitely be trying this one again!

Very good. I had it with a pork loin roast with roasted potatoes and carrots. It was a very nice addition.

Very easy and tasty! I just roasted the cauliflower on a cookie sheet for about 15mins. I sprinkled with the cheese and parsley and roasted another 5 mins.

Amazing - 10 stars!  I used a bag of frozen cauliflower (just put into the oven frozen), drizzled the olive oil on top and baked at 400 for 20 min, adding the Parmesan cheese for the last couple minutes. It was perfect!  Next time I will use two bags if I do frozen (as it definitely didn't make enough for our family with one bag :).

WOW & YUM!!! Never thought cauliflower could be this good. Great recipe and works as a base to add more veggies.  I added a bit of broccoli springs and doused a spoonful of balsamic vinegar out of preference. Agree with the other reviews that say 400 degrees is the best temperature. HONESTLY I could eat a pound of this dish! Its a keeper.

never liked cauliflower until I came upon this recipe. I LOVE it and it is my new favorite! I was gonna have it with NY strip steak but after the aroma from the cauliflower cooking I decided to just have the cauliflower. I had the steak the next night with the leftover and it was just as good reheated. I am actually excited about getting my next head and making it again!

Loved this!  I didn't have a bag so stirred/tossed the oil, garlic and cauliflower really well in a big glass bowl with S&P.  I used fresh garlic - I prefer it to the jarred stuff.  I had shredded Parmesan so used that.  (Unfortunately I didn't have any parsley.)  Delicious!

Awesome recipe! I pretty much followed the directions, but I lowered the heat to 425F, kept it uncovered, cooked 25 mins. as directed then broiled for 3 mins. at 500F. Make it your own by adding different seasonings. I added a couple shakes of onion powder and Bell Pepper & Herb Rub from the Pampered Chef line. You could use any number of herbs like rosemary or tarragon, depending on what you're pairing it with. Just fabulous. Will be making this again for sure!

This was a great new way to eat cauliflower.  I used three cloves of garlic which wasn't quite 2 TBS. and it was enough for us.  I also did not have fresh parsley on hand to top it off.  I covered the dish at 425 degrees for about 25 min then just sprinkled some cheese on top and broiled it on low for about 5 min.  Any hotter a temp or longer the garlic would have been burnt.  The kids weren't impressed but my husband and I loved it.

I thought that this was pretty good, but felt that it was missing a little something so the recipe itself gets 4 stars. However I think that next time I'll try adding some red pepper flakes to it to spice it up, otherwise it felt slightly bland.

Delicious and so easy! I only used half a head, but now I wish I cooked all of it! What looks like a lot will shrink quite a bit. Next time I will add ruttabagas or parsnips, too.

Who knew Cauliflower could taste so good!! Loved it!! Instead of sprinkling the parmesan cheese over the top at the end, I put it in the bag with the garlic and olive oil and cauliflower. Gave it a nice crisp taste. I will make this again and again. Oh yes, the serving size needs to be adjusted because I ate half of it when I made it.

Made again and cooked at 450 with no cover and used  half the garlic and delicious. My husband likes a bit softer so probably could have cooked 30 minutes.  Previously: A little dry and the garlic did get really brown (and I cooked at 425 because I had another dish cooking at the same time).  Guess I should have read the reviews and put in a covered casserole but that is a different recipe.

All of the reviews are correct - this was fantastic! I used fresh garlic that I pressed (it was really garlicky bc I used a whole small head, but I love garlic). I did reduced the temperature to 425 degrees and left mine UNCOVERED and it roasted beautifully (my pieces of fresh cauliflower were avg., not too small). I enjoyed this just as much cold the next day. Awesome. Can't wait to make for a family party. We usually bread and fry ours, but this was much easier, healthier (I'll try two tbls of oil next time and see if I can get away with less oil) and way less messy! Thanks for such a great recipe.

The only way my bride could get me to eat cauliflower! And what a delight it was. It's the marriage of the tender stalks with the cheese!

I wanted to like this....I REALLY did!  I LOVE Cauliflower....but this was dry and completely tasteless.  I read a lot of the reviews and decided to cover it for the first 15 minutes, then another 15 uncovered.  It was still hard - and not a "crispy goodness" hard...but an "uncooked" hard.  I left it in the oven for a little bit longer than 35 minutes, but I finally had to take it out because it was going to be totally scorched on the outside if I didn't, and that was with reducing the heat to 400 after about 25 minutes....and it was still pretty much raw in the middle.  I'll try it again - at some point....I can work around the temperature of the oven...but there is going to need to be A LOT added for flavor!

Roasted at 400 degrees for 40 minutes, with olive oil, salt and garlic powder. Stirred at 15 and 30 minutes. Came out caramelized and flavorful; my one year olds loved it!!

GREAT!  I used four cloves of garlic and tossed directly in baking dish--no bag.  Baked covered 400 for 20 minutes or so.  Tossed with more fresh-grated parm than called for (doubled?) and a handful of plain breadcrumbs--broiled per directions.  We loved this--even the non-cauliflower fans.

It was a little too much garlic for my taste. Otherwise, I liked it. I'd make again with a few tweaks & less garlic for sure.

Yum!!!  I love roasted cauliflower, and the garlic addition was awesome.  I tossed my cauliflower pieces into a corningware, added the olive oil and seasonings and tossed it together in there before baking.  Less dishes.  :)  My oven temp was lower based on the other food cooking so I just cooked it a little longer.  My kids and husband gobbled it up so it's definitely a keeper!

I omitted salt, used dried basil instead of parsley, and just used a sprinkling of the parmesan cheese, really tasty!

I always make a recipe as written and this came out wonderful. Thank you will make again. 

However another reviewer  had a problem with the ingredients in the bag and garlic sticking. I didn't  have much garlic on the bag  and the little I did  I just turned bag inside out and tapped it and it fell into the dish.

My family loved it, especially the younger ones. I followed the recipe as written, but used 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder instead of the minced garlic because I was worried about it burning in the high heat. Will make this again since it was so easy to prepare and was a winner at the table. Thanks for sharing it!

Good recipe. I agree with the other reviewers on the temperature and time. I now do it at 400 deg for about 30 minutes and skip the cheese. Works every time.

I really liked this, my husband wasn't so trilled.  He wanted a cheese sauce on it.  I told him the point was not to do that.  Anyway, this is so much more tasty than just steaming them.  Took another reviews suggestion and made sure the pieces were even.

We use cauliflower all the time now! This dish is delish!
I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and then made modifications to fit my family.
1. I do not use the bag to toss olive oil & minced garlic, it works better for me to use a large bowl.
2. A little extra garlic - my family loves garlic.
3. Covered baking dish with foil - it keeps it nice and crunchy, yet keeps it from drying out and burning. 
4. I followed others advice and kept florets uniform in size. Works wonderfully.
I will try other veggies with this great recipe!

Excellent recipe. I agree with another reviewer that the plastic bag is a bit frustrating (garlic sticks to the inside instead of the cauliflower) - might try a bowl next time. I did also cover the casserole dish and bake at 200 Celsius for 20 minutes - then uncovered, added Parmesan, and attempted to broil (Europeans don't really understand the concept of broiling, so basically just put my oven as high as it would go and selected for heat from the top only). Very tasty. Had this with brown rice and Quick Chicken Piccata (from this site).

This is a fantastic recipe. It uses a rather lackluster veggie and turns into into an impressive side dish. My husband is not a fan of parmesan cheese, so I subbed it for some grated sharp white cheddar. I baked it covered for about 20 minutes (stirring once) and then broiled it uncovered for another 10 or so (stirring a few times to evenly brown it). My husband doesn't usually care for cauliflower, but even he had seconds!

I usually make broccoli this way, so I made this last night with cauliflower and it turned out pretty good.  I think I will lower the amount of garlic or maybe try different spices next time I make it.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and lowered the cooking temp to 400 and covered the dish for the first 20 minutes and then broiled for the last 5 minutes (on Lo).  The cauliflower still had a little crunch to it but was tender as well.

I thought this tasted good. Although, the garlic and oil was just a bit much. It all fit fine in a 9x9 flexible non stick pan I have. I lightly sprayed it with PAM and had no problems with sticking or it over cooking. Although it tasted fine, I think I personally prefer a more mild tasting baked cauliflower dish.

Easy to make, not a lot of ingredients. although I ran out of olive oil and garlic, I made mine with just one tablespoon of garlic and 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, I could smell it cooking and I could only imagine how tasty it would be with the correct amount of garlic! I read in previous reviews about covering the casserole dish and bake it at 400F. I did not think there was a need in that. Cannot wait until I have all of the correct amounts to make tasty roasted garlic cauliflower. Thanks for sharing!

This is excellent!  I didn't have parsley so I chopped some cilantro but kept everything else exactly like the recipe.  So good, so easy.  It is the best cauliflower I've ever tasted.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Delicious! Will definitely be making this again. Used 1/2 the cheese and cheddar instead of Parmesan (because that's all I had) and it was still amazing!

Definitely 5 stars.  Everyone in my family likes this, including our 2 kids.  It's even good cold or re-heated!  I make it just as the recipe is written.

Our family loved this recipe!  My husband forces himself to eat cauliflower and he said he loved it because it didn't taste like it.  I added some extra spices (garlic/rosemary and some garlic salt).  Otherwise, followed all directions.  It is now on the dinner rotation.  I'm going to try mixing it with broccoli next time for variety.

Cauliflower isn't my favorite, and I've found that roasting it with garlic and Parmesan makes it the most palatable.  I slice the cauliflower and use far more garlic and cheese.  Also I don't bother with the plastic bag, instead just toss it in a large bowl.

I made this for dinner tonight and my cauliflower hating husband liked it.  I was out of fresh garlic so I used dried.  I mixed it with the olive oil and let it sit a while, along with the salt and pepper.  Used very good parmesean along with Kraft and it ws excellent  I can't wait to try it again but with fresh garlic.  Very very tasty.  I hate doing dishs so I mixed and baked in the same ceramic casserole.

It was great. I made it just as the recipe called for except I tossed the olive oil and garlic with the cauliflower in the casserole dish instead of using a resealable bag. Wonderful. I will make it again.

A great alternative to all the creamy baked cauliflower recipe.  Like others, I cooked the cauliflower at 400 degrees.  Instead of parsley, I substituted a tea spoon of dry thyme and that worked out very well.  At the end, I topped off the cauliflower with Panko bread crumbs and let everything bake for another 15 minutes.

Followed the recipe as-is except that I covered it for the first 15 minutes. Didn't feel like measuring the garlic, so I just guessed at 6 cloves, which I grated into the mix. Perfection!

Very good! Changes I made... I had to use mozzarella cheese in place of Parmesan because I didn't have any. It kind of made me think of garlic bread because the flavor was so intense - in a good way! Will definitely be making this again.

This is the most delicious way I have ever eaten cauliflower. I usually smother it with butter or cheese in order to eat it, but this is so much healthier and actually tastes better too. I followed the directions exactly.

We love cauliflower made this way, it's like vegetable candy!  We use Pecorino Romano cheese instead of Parmesan, so we don't use any additional salt.

I liked the way these tasted, but I found them to be a bit dry.  I added some extra olive oil when they were finsiehd.

Nice!  Simple and healthy.  I can't eat dairy so I omitted the parmesan cheese and added more garlic.  It was tasty and satisfying.

I added 100 g chopped chicken breast to recipe to create a simple but yummy one dish meal. I also added 1/2  cup chopped green onion when I added parsley for a bit of colour and complementary flavour

Love it!  It never occurred to me to cook cauliflower like this.  It's great to find a yummy healthy recipe for a new vegetable.  I sadly omitted the parmesan because we have family with gluten/soy/dairy allergies but it was still delicious!  I think I may add this to the Thanksgiving menu this year!  Delicious, thank you!

Update Aug 31, 17: We tried this again, cooking it about 30 min. It was very  good, even though I forgot about the Parmesan cheese. Every bit got eaten! Very disappointing. My husband said it was probably the best cauliflower he's had and gave it 3 stars but the kids didn't like it at all.  It wasn't worth the extra work and time it took to cook. 400 degrees for 20 minutes wasn't enough. Even after 30 minutes, it was still a little hard.

Made this for dinner last night with a few tweaks since it was our main dish.  First I did not have Parmesan so I substituted with shredded cheddar and substituted fresh parsley with dried.  Added about 1/4 cup of crumbled cooked bacon for the last 5 minutes.  Like other reviewer I cooked in a pyrex covered casserole dish for entire time.  It turned out delicious and will definitely make again.

YUMMY... Will never boil cauliflower ever again.  This dish got rave review from all my dinner guest. I did reduce the roasting temp to 400 degrees after read other reviews.  I also added 1 Red Bell pepper for colour and flavour.

Wow!  This is the first time that I actually loved eating cauliflower!  I mixed the olive oil and herbs right in the casserole dish and then stirred in the cauliflower--no need to grease the dish or use a plastic bag.

My family will not eat cauliflower any other way. The garlic gives it such a great taste. I also used lawry's seasoned salt and that made it great too.

This recipe was very nice.  I'm not a huge cauliflower fan, but it was very tasty.  I followed advice of others and combined the cauliflower, olive oil, and garlic in a bowl instead of a bag. It was easy to scrape out of the bowl into the casserole dish.  I didn't have any fresh parsley, so used dry and put it on prior to roasting. I thought it came out a bit salty. Next time I won't add any salt. My family liked it okay, but not really a homerun.  I will try it a few more times.  Thanks!

No need for cheese with this recipe. The parmesan is good but all you really need is salt, pepper, and garlic. I didn't have any parsley and I didn't miss it. Roasted it for 30 mins on 400 covered with foil. Delicious!

If you are a cauliflower fan than you will probabvly like the recipe. My husband and I don't really like cauliflower to begin with so I am going to chalk it up to that. I probably won't use this recipe again but I don't think it was because of the recipe, just our personal tastes.

Our new favorite way to eat cauliflower.  I baked a head of cauliflower with 2 cloves of garlic (minced) at 400 for 20 minutes, added cheese and baked for an additional 10 minutes at 400; skipped broiling.  Tasty.  For 2 heads of cauliflower we use a cookie/brownie sheet and 4 cloves of garlic.

This recipe is incredible!! I love everything about it. SO easy, so tasty...just perfect!

Sad to admit, but I will eat the entire dish for dinner when I'm home alone. Actually, it's every time I've made it! :)
I think even people that don't *love* cauliflower raw would enjoy this.

I stick to the recipe except now I just eyeball the ingredients. I never have fresh parsley, so haven't used that. 

Thanks for posting!! One of our regular favorites!!

Simple and delicious.  I didn't add any parsley because I was too lazy and just now I see that I didn't add any salt or pepper either.  So maybe my version was a bit more simple but it was still delicious, nonetheless.

Absolutely delicious.  I added some more veggies - onions, chayote squash and some red potatoes.  Just upped the parmesan a bit.  It was so yummy and a great way for kids and adults who aren't big veggie fans to eat them.  My husband loved it, my son was ok w/ it, but still ate it.

This was delicious! My fiance and I ended up eating the entire head of cauliflower (and I didn't feel guilty because it's cauliflower after all). I added some Italian seasoning and left out the salt entirely. I served it with Hoppin' Johns (black-eyed peas) for a healthy and delicious meal. I'll definitely be making this again.

Use large corning ware and toss floretts with EVOO and garlic.  (tried plastic bag and most of the garlic stayed in the bag)
Update:  crush roasted garlic, salt, pepper and mix with EVOO. 425* on speed bake and stir every 7-8min until done.  Can top with italian cheese too!

This recipe got both of my children (aged 7 and 3) to eat cauliflower.  Amazing! My 7-year old actually said "wow.  I like this." My husband said that this his favorite cauliflower recipe by far.  I followed the directions as written.  Can't wait to make this again!!!!

The tastiest way I've had cauliflower in a long time.  I followed the recipe as is except that I covered the casserole loosely with foil while in the oven.  This stopped it from burning on top and helped to hold in the steam for the cauliflower.

Heart Healthy. Nutritious. Delicious. Simple. Low Calorie. Monounsaturated Fat. This has to be one of the easiest dishes to make for the flavor. I didn't have parsley - will try another time. Covered casserole and baked about 35 minutes @ 400 degrees; then uncovered and broiled 3 minutes.  DELICIOUS!  Will make again and again. Will also try with sliced carrots.

This cauliflower recipe is delicous!  As a family, cauliflower isn't a favorite veggie but we try to eat it since it's good for us!  This recipe makes eating it enjoyable & my kids even asked for more!  Thank you for this simple and nutricious way to eat cauliflower!

I was so happy to have found this recipe but I had trouble with cooking the cauliflower. I ended up cooking it almost 40 minutes before it was tender. Not sure why. I liked how it was more healthy than other ways of cooking cauliflower. Will have to figure out what I did wrong.

Turned out great! My boyfriend said it was the best cauliflower he has ever had. I let the cauliflower marinate in the garlic and olive oil for a few hours and used only two tablespoons of olive oil to cut down on fat. I also stirred them every 10-15 minutes. It took longer to cook than noted. I also did not broil  it at all and it was still good.

Loved it. I didn't use fresh but frozen cauliflower because we are moving next month and all the food has to go. Also, I did grill these because I was grilling everything else. Next time (hopefully in the new house) I will make as is. Served with Marinated Pork Chops and Grilled Broccoli.

I love Cauliflower, but I didn't find this recipe to be that great.  I was really disappointed.  My husband didn't care for it much either.  I'm not sure what exactly it was about it that didn't work for us.  It just didn't.

This is great!!  I put the cauliflower mixture in a foil packet and cook it on the grill.  Turn it every 10 minutes.  Awesome and easy!

Very tasty!  Best tasting way to eat cauliflower.  I dropped the temperature 25 degrees and covered after 10 minutes.  Will make again :)

Tasty, but I think mine needed to be roasted a little longer. I used a blend of marble cheddar and mozzarella instead of the Parmesan. Used dried parsley. This would be good using broccoli too.

Roasted Garlic Cauliflower Haiku: "Nice, perky method, to dress up cauliflower. Dull veggie made good!" Chuckle all you want, but we ate this as an alternative to chips or fries alongside grilled hot dogs last night. With the lightly-browned top and satisfying seasoning of garlic, we really liked how the ingredients, and preparation, of this recipe made a typically boring vegetable more tasty. But, I find the AR recipe "Cauliflower alla Parmagiana" far superior in taste to to this, which I think is due to the use of panko sprinkled on top.

I had raw cauliflower in my fridge and I knew I wanted to roast it but wasn't sure what to do with it besides that. Found this recipe and now I've got a winner! I was liberal with the garlic and it turned out fantastically! Even my boyfriend who has an aversion to veggies like cauliflower liked it and said he would definitely eat it again. I cooked mine at around 425 and most pieces were nicely browned after about 20 minutes.

This is DELICIOUS! My whole family was wow'd! I made according to directions, but I topped with a grated 3-cheese blend that I happened to have, rather than just the Parmesan (it included Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago). This became a staple for us!

Everyone loved it. The only dish with no leftover.  Just mixed everything in the baking dish. When the cauliflower was done added butter and parmesan cheese and mixed. Will have to buy 2 heads of cauliflower next time.

This was so easy and yummy. I added quartered red potatoes. I think I left mine in for a bit too long but some edges were nice and very crispy. YUM!

this was delicious! i used a bit more oil because i had a lot of cauliflower and used a little less garlic. i used romano cheese because i didnt have parm. also, i added buttered breadcrumbs to make the soft cauliflower have some texture. it was a healthy and tasty way to serve up cauliflower(:

This is probably my favorite cauliflower recipe now.  I have to admit that I thought I had gotten fresh parsley but it wasn't in the refrigerator.  I ended up using some dried basil.  It was still wonderful!

Yummy!  Just finished eating this recipe with dinner tonight and it was very tasty!  This was the first time I have eaten cauliflower prepared this way and I'm definitely a convert!  I followed the recipe as written except I kept it covered for the first 15 minutes of cooking as other reviewers have suggested and instead of measuring the parm I just sprinkled a little bit over the cauliflower.  I probably used a little less than 1/4 c.  Also, I omitted the parsley just because I didn't have any.  I really enjoyed this method of preparation.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The veggies turn out perf4ect everytime. Because I usually buy the mixes that include broccoli and carrots with the cauliflower, they usually get roasted as well. The flavors work great together and the recipe is so versatile.

I'm only reviewing for the method of cooking, as I didn't follow the recipe ingredients (used granulated garlic instead of minced, and skipped the Parmesan entirely in order to lower the calories), but this was absolutely perfect. I cooked at 450 degrees on a metal sheet tray spritzed with non-stick spray, and pulled out at 25 minutes as directed, after stirring once partway through. The florets came out of the oven with just the tips starting to turn golden. Delicious and healthy!

Delicious and easy! Followed suggestions to lower the heat to 200 c. and cover with foil. I also sprinkled some panko breadcrumbs for a crunch effect. A hit with my 7 year old!

My kidlet loves cauliflower this way!  No heavy cheese sauce needed!  I made this exactly as described, minus the broiler, because I don't have one.  It's tender and delicious and my favorite way to eat this veggie.  Really easy and good recipe.

Tasted fine but a bit bland for my taste. The cheese makes it tasty, but cheese makes nearly anything tasty.  Texture was good- not oily or mushy.  The best part is the crumbs at the bottom of the dish, immersed in oil and garlic, which is why next time I'll crumble the entire cauliflower so it's easier to mix. Next time I'll experiment by adding additional spices and herbs: chilli flakes, rosemary, oregano, mint, basil etc.

Tasty! We were pressed for time so I microwaved, then tossed with oil, garlic and parm, and popped in the over to broil/brown. I trimmed the oil & cheese by about half and I don't think it suffered.

Holy cow this recipe is fantastic! You will not regret trying this one out!  Make sure to use fresh grated Parmesan; I prefer Parmesan Reggiano. Also, I didn't use quite a whole head of cauliflower for this amount of ingredients.

Delicious. I like to double or triple the recipe because it really only yields 6 servings if you're giving each person 3 or 4 fleurettes.

This one turned out awesome. I used a 50-50 mix of cheese and bread crumbs (1/4 cup each with a Tbsp of olive oil) but otherwise made it as written. Great recipe, thanks.

i just drizzled some olive oil and tossed the cauli in a bowl. garlic tends to stick to plastic bags so i just sprinkled it on top of the cauliflowers before popping it in the oven. the only disappointing part was i didn't make enough for my family! i didn't expect them all to go for the cauliflowers! (we're carnivores hahaha) thx for the delicious recipe

Yummy!!! Can add in other veggies, like fennel root, broccoli, potatoes, brussel sprouts, etc.  A great way to do veggies, especially some of those that aren't very tasty when simply boiled.  I sometimes add some fresh lemon juice and/or zest after baking for an added fresh kick...but this is very good as is!

Easy to make. It has subtle garlic-parm touch to the already bland cauliflower. Well, I don't mind eating cauliflower without anything at all. I love cauliflower that much but this gave it a nice enhancement. I just threw everything together and covered it with foil. I might even add a little bit of butter next time.

Very bland. Cauliflower's like water, no flavor until it's added. I will definitely have to triple the spices and roast longer for that smoky aroma.  Family enjoyed. Me, not so much.

I don't usually like cauliflower, but this was delicious. I made it for my husband who had never eaten cauliflower and he loved it. I also brought the temperature down to 400 and sprinkled some onion powder and a little Italian seasoning on it, but it would have been just as good without it.

Heavy garlic taste (I suppose the name kind of gives one a hint of that) and a bit on the dry side. Nevertheless, easy to make and great tasting.

This is AMAZING! I was a little worried that it would be too much garlic, but it was fantastic.  I didn't have parsley on hand but I used real grated Parmesan and I really think that just put this dish over the top good.  I will definitely make this again.  Would be great to serve to guests too.

This has a wonderful taste...I lowered the temperature to 400 degrees and increased to 450 when I added the cheese.  I did not broil.  Only took a few minutes for the cheese to melt and brown a little...I will use this one often.

Made this exactly as is and my whole family loved it, even the one who said she didn't still ate everything on her plate.  Definitely a new great way to make cauliflower!

We all loved it!  Even the kids, which is saying a lot for cauliflower.  Watch the tops so it doesn't burn.  Also, we used dried parsley because we didn't have fresh on hand.  Fresh would add even more good flavor though.

This was delicious - best cauliflower I've ever made - used a cookie sheet covered with foil and tossed the ingredients together with two forks. Temperature at 450 and didn't broil it- just sprinkled on the shredded parmesano-reggiano cheese and and baked for 3-5 minutes. The cheese made the whole thing - I can't wait to make this again.  Has anyone tried it with broccoli?

Wonderful!  I only had 1 clove of garlic so I used that and substituted garlic powder for the remaining amount.  I also used vegetable oil instead of olive (taste preference) and it was great.  My boys (4 & 7) loved it too!  Thanks for a great recipe for cooked cauliflower!

This was good and I will make it again, however, it wasn't over the top good as I had expected from the reviews.  A nice change from steamed cauliflower.  I recommend people try it.  I didn't use the Parm Cheese but otherwise followed the recipe using some other readers suggestions of tossing the florets in a bowl with the garlic and oil.  Thanks for a nice change of pace recipe.

this probably would have been better if i had fresh grated parm and fresh parsley.  it was definately better than just plain ole' steaming.  next time i will lower the temp on the over to 425 or 400.  the florets had already started burning at the half way mark when i stirred.  all in all it was good and i'll definately make again.

Ok, when I first saw this recipe, I wasn't all that excited even after reading the ginormous list of excellent reviews.  I love cauliflower raw (and hate it steamed or cooked in general), so I thought, why do so many people love cooked cauliflower?!  But my mother in law gave me an entire forest of cauliflower (my husband and I would have been eating raw cauliflower 3x a day for a month), so I decided to try something new.  SOOOOO...from now on, if I ever cook cauliflower, it will be in this recipe!!!  It was delicious.  My husband loved it too, and he's a raw cauliflower person like me.  This is a fantastic way to cook cauliflower.  Thank you for the recipe.

Eh. I used frozen cauliflower, about six cloves garlic - baked, covered, at 425* for 25 minutes and then broiled, uncovered, for 5 minutes more. Nice side to my fish but nothing to write home about.

A nice way to make cauliflower - the roasting helps take away some of the "cauliflower" taste.

Wow, this really turned out great.  I cookeed mine a little longer so that it was browned and carmelized.  I then added the parsely, crushed red pepper and parm.  DELICIOUS!

This is really good. I cut up some broccoli and mixed some of that in as well. To make this healthier I omitted the part with Parmesan cheese. I just cut into smaller bit sized pieces, mixed in a bowl, no point wasting a bag, and baked for 20 mins turning half through through. I usually eat my veggies raw because I don't like them steamed, never thought of baking them. Soft, but still with a crunch. Yummy!

Love roasted vegetables. Great side dish to replace potatoes, rice or pasta. Husband wanted it again next night, offered to pick up cauliflower on way home from work--amazing.! Didn't use cheese or parsley, forgot cheese and seldom buy fresh parsley. Used lots of garlic, sprayed baking dish with Pam and covered it with foil. Wasn't dried out and no leftovers  but I did use a very small head of cauliflower since there are just the 2 of us.

I love cauliflower, and I liked the idea of this but it just turned out dried up. I'd rather steam and add some flavoring. It was probably user error, but still - I'll keep looking.

Great and versatile recipe. Made it a number of times with or without extra spices...tastes great with just olive oil and minced garlic! I use a tupperware container to do the shaking/coating step and then can use it to store the leftovers.

Excellent.   I have always felt lukewarm about cauliflower and never purchased it (not enough flavor as a vegetable). Someone gave me some so I went in search of a recipe, found this one, followed it except for doubling the garlic and lowering the cooking temperature to 400, and everyone in my family wanted more.  I found it hard to believe that such a simple recipe added so much flavor.  I will DEFINITELY go out of  my way to buy cauliflower now.

I have tried this quite a few times, i have found what works for me.  I keep it covered the entire time add a little more garlic (I love garlic) and salt and pepper.  I add the cheese and broil it until the cheese browns.  My son loves it and will eat the whole pan all by himself.

it was very good, could have cooked a little bit longer though.  It also needed something a little bit more... maybe more salt or a very small amount of butter.

The CSA bin is starting to fill up with cauliflower and this is an excellent way of utilizing it. Also, it is super week-night friendly since it has simple ingredients and quick cooking.  Finger lickin' good.

The flavor of this recipe was good, but it definately needs more spice, like hot pepper flakes. Also, it took longer to cook by about 25 minutes. Next time, I would  add the salt after the cauliflower is roasted, since too much water leaches out during cooking if it is added before roasting, hindering the carmelization of the veggies.

Excellent.  I added 1 tsp seasoned salt to the oil and garlic.  I also added broccoli and carrots.  I'm sure you could put in whatever you have on hand.  My husband and daughter really enjoyed it as well.

So good! One of my favorite ways with many veggies is roasting at high heat. Cauliflower really gets luscious when roasted and browned. Used three cloves of garlic since two of them where on the skinnier side, perfect amount for me. I left out the Parmesan since I had an earlier meal that had a lot of it, so I skipped the last broiler step and simply stirred the parsley in when the cauliflower was done. Definitely though, I can see that Parmesan would be outstanding in this and will do that next time. I can't think of anything to improve this recipe.

This didn't have a ton of flavor, but it wasn't too bland either.  I made it exactly as written except that I used 16 oz. frozen cauliflower instead.  Watch your oven--the time/temperature in this recipe was a little too much for my oven and some of the cauliflower pieces started to turn black.  I caught it just in time, but only left it in for about 18 minutes.

Never knew cauliflower and broccoli could taste this good!  I used a mix of califlower and broccoli.  I also added in a little bit cayenne pepper and some onion powder.  I also skipped the broiling part, as I don't think it was necessary.  After roasting for 25-30 min., I immediately put the cheese on top and then served.  Thanks, and will make again!  Update: reduce cooking time to 15 minutes my putting the cauliflower in the microwave for 3 minutes before the mixing step and oven.

I loved this! I'm not even a huge fan of cauliflower. This cooked perfectly for me. Like someone else said chop them small & uniform. I didn't even broil them, just put the parm on & left it a few more minutes.

This was incredible!!!  My child who hates cauliflower loved this!!  I used lots of fresh garlic and spooned the oil and garlic over the cauliflower and then stirred.  I also made the cauliflower uniform in shape (as another reviewer stated) for even cooking.  We were fighting over the last piece!  YUMMM!!!

We loved this!  It's such a great way to cook cauliflower.  The only thing I did different was to cook it at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes so that it would be done around the same time as the rest of dinner that had to be baked at 400.  So yummy!

Thank you so much for this recipe, it's delicious!  I've made this three times in the last month for my DH.  He just can't get enough of it. It's such an easy recipe.  I mix the cauliflower, garlic and EVOO all together in the pan I'm using, no need for a plastic bag.

Awesome - best cauliflower I've ever had. Made this with a purple variety I found at the farmers' market - wish I had taken a picture; it was beautiful. I was too impatient to grate that much parmasan cheese, but added an extra sprinkle of shreadded sharp cheddar. It was so flavorful, it didn't even need it. Fabulous recipe.

I went looking at the last minute for something to do with my cauliflower other than steam it or drown it in cheese, and this was a winner.  I doubt it had much impact on the flavoring, but to save myself time I prepared it in advance. I broke up the cauliflower and put it directly into the baking dish, then mixed the garlic and olive oil together and poured it on top, mixed it up, covered it in foil, and stuck it in the fridge until I was ready to bake it.  I baked it at 350 for an hour because it was in there with the chicken and it came out too soft, but next time I will follow the directions to see if it's a little more firm.

I would steam the cauliflour for a few minutes before roasting it to make sure that it softens enough.I ended up roasting it for an extra 15-20 minutes. I mixed it with the oil in a bowl instead the bag and then I added the garlic mixing it in with my hands. (I used the microplaner to mince the garlic.) like the others I covered the dish for the first 10 minutes. I really liked the dish though. I didn't find that the parm cheese added much to the dish.

This was very tasty. I was cooking other things at the same time so I only had the oven temperature at 375 degrees. It took about 15 minutes longer and it was fully cooked without the burnt garlic like some other reviewers had complained about.

I didn't add the cheese, but this was still great. I had some grape tomatoes that needed to be used up, so I halved them and threw them in halfway through cooking. I made this early in the day when I had the oven on for something else, with the intention of heating it up for dinner, and I just couldn't stay away from it throughout the day.

Loved this. I do think the cauliflower needs to be steamed for a few minutes before roasting in the oven. Otherwise it is too hard.

I was looking for a way to get some more veggies on the table.  This was really good and easy.  I used the roast setting on my convection oven and it turned out fantastic.  Also use fresh garlic and a little more than stated due to a love for it!

Very Good! Make sure to use fresh garlic. Second time, I used dried minced garlic (lazy me) and it burned a bit. Still yummy.

I like this very much (but dont' cook it in a toaster oven - it BURNS!).

I also like it better with these variations:  Add a sliced red pepper to the cauliflower.
Combine the olive oil, garlic & parsley with two chopped spring (green) onions, 1/2 tsp ginger and 3 tbsp lemon juice.  Brush this "marinade" over the veg and cook as above.  I added a thick slice-worth of toast crumbs and 1/4 cup of finely-grated Gruyere cheese to the Parmesan towards the end.

LOVE IT!  This is our favorite way to make cauliflower.  We will usually make the recipe as is, but depending on our mood, we will add more or less garlic, onion powder, or grated romano cheese, or when adventurous a touch of chili powder.  We have noticed the age and freshness of fresh cauliflower matters.  Sometimes the florets seem dry and we need to add a little water to the pan or sometimes just needs to cook a bit longer.  Either way, this dish is a hit at our house.

the garlic and parmesan go wonderfully with the roasted cauliflower!  I used garlic powder instead of the minced variety and it was wonderfully flavored and a great veggie side dish with broiled tilapia parmesan and orzo pilaf.  a great easy recipe; thanks for sharing!

YUM!! Made exactly as directed, except when it came time to sprinkle on the fresh parmesan, I realized I didn't have any in the fridge. So, I sprinkled on some of the green can "fake" parmesan. Still good!! Will definitely make again!

Best cauliflower I've ever had!  Used grated irish dubliner cheese instead of parmesian and topped with crushed onion flavored saltines.  Deliciious!  Alot of extra fat and calories than our usual steamed veggies so will save this recipe for company, but a definate keeper!  Thanks!

A very good, simple way to prepare cauliflower.  Tossing it in a big bowl is definitely easier than a bag.  I made this recipe with cauliflower, broccoli, and carrots.  Also threw in some oregano and a little bit of lemon juice.  Next time I'd use a vegetable or chicken broth because it seemed dry.  It might come out just a little bland but a sprinkle of parmesan fixes that right up.

I'm very glad I tried this one, it is definetely a husband pleaser; I had to tell my husband to leave some for me, he was just eating it out of the pan!.

It reminded me of bagna cauda-dipped cauliflower, to tell the truth, but without all the hassle of actually preparing it!.

This was very, very good!  My husband ate so much of the cauliflower he had no room left to finish his steak--that NEVER happens!

Excellent dish! Finally a new way to prepare cauliflower. I also sprinkled a little bit of bread crumbs when it was almost done. Yummy....I'll be making this one again.

This was a delicious change from my usual steamed/sauteed cauliflower-with-garlic recipe.  I really love the texture that roasting gives to this dish.  I'll definitely be making this one again.

I was in a hurry so I just did it in a very hot no-stick skillet.  Iadded chopped scallions after the cauliflower was started to get brown crisps and I added the cheese at the end.

I absolutely love this recipe!! I would give it 10 stars if I could. I have been dieting for some time now and it is very rare to find something so delicious be so good for you! I used olive oil cooking spray instead of olive oil for fewer calories, and as I had no fresh garlic, I used garlic salt with parsley flakes, and had no trouble with anything burning. It's a good thing my family also loved this, because I will be cooking it all the time!

Oh, this is super easy to make. My mom loved it and my dad thinks the strong garlic flavour really suits the dish. I left out the cheese but it was still fantastic. So maybe next time, I'll do a portion with cheese and a portion without just to taste the difference. This is a really quick and easy dish to whip up especially on a lazy evening when I don't feel like using the stove top. And by the way, I cooked the cauliflower with aluminium foil cover for the first half of the time and uncovered it for the second half. After cooking, I switched off the oven and left the dish in there until dinner. It was still warm and was absolutely delicious!

I found this recipe to be missing something. I followed other suggestions and melted butter with Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and put it over the dish at the end , without the butter it would have been a very dry dish

This recipe was awesome!   I don't usually like cauliflower but we grew a bunch in our garden this year and I've been looking for creative ways to use it.  The only thing i changed was i only cooked it for about 17 minutes cause i was running out of time with everything else and it was done perfectly .

This was by far some of the best cauliflower that  I have had in a very long time. The only thing that I did differently was bake it at 350* for an hour and finished it up in the microwave for 5min on high to get it tender.

The worst cauliflower I've ever had.  I used less oil, as someone had suggested, and they were still like mushy oily yuckiness.  My husband choked them down, I couldn't.  The flavor was fine, the texture was terrible.

This was really good.  I baked it with "Guy-approved Meatloaf" from this site, which means that they baked at 375 for about an hour.  They still weren't done quite as well as I would have liked.  I ended up broiling them for 5 minutes at the end to brown them up a bit.  I also added carrots and sprinkled some cayenne pepper over them.  The spicy went well with the sweet from the roasting.  Everyone raved.

Delicious new way to cook cauliflower. We both loved it. Doesn't need 3 tbs of oil though, next time I will use 1.5 tbs. Also doesn't need as much Parmesan, 2 tbs was plenty. I will definitely try some different herbs from the garden also.

This tastes very good. I baked the cauliflower in a covered glass dish (medium-sized one fits in a 10" dish). I used more garlic than called for, as well as parmesan and romano cheeses. Somehow I think this would be even better without the cheese.

Pretty good- I used frozen & baked 30 min at 375. Added cheese halfway through. I like "Cheesy Baked Cauliflower" better.

Honestly, this was the tastiest cauliflower I've ever had (even compared to fried with cheese!). I used 2 large garlic cloves, which was probably less than the 2 tbsp called for, but was plenty. I also used dried parsley and added before cooking. YUM!

I don't make cauliflower very often, but after finding this recipe I'll definately be making it more and more.  I'm sure this would be equally as delicious with other veggies as well.  Thanks for the recipe.

So good. I added more oil than the recipe (I wasn't paying attention). It ended up being too much oil. Otherwise, this was so good and so easy.

Fabulous! I increased the cheese to half a cup. I must say that the garlic did burn, but that didn't matter for some reason. I left out the parsley since I was out, and that didn't seem to matter either. And I didn't need to put it under the broiler, because it was plenty brown without. My husband who hates cauliflower liked it.

This recipe will rock your world!  My (soon to be) 3-year-old loved it, my husband loved it, and I loved it so much -- that I ate it cold out of the fridge the next day for a mid-afternoon snack!  To top it off, so easy to make.

MMMMM, this was yummy! Instead of putting everything in a bag, I just mixed it in the dish. I also added more parm cheese. I agree with other reviewers that this would be good with broccoli also. I'll try that next time. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Good! I didn't bother mixing the garlic & cauliflower in a separate baggie, but did it in the casserole.  I also added some cumin, italian seasoning, and onion powder, and used an italian cheese mix (and lots of it!) in addition to parmesan.  I also prefer softer florets, so I cooked it about 10 minutes longer than called for as per other reviewers suggestions.  Thanks!

Delicious !  Because I had another dish baking at a lower temperature, I baked the cauliflower for 30 minutes at 400 degrees...That worked out find.  For goo-ier cheese, I also added a four white cheese shredded blend that really added some nice moisture & additional flavor to the cauliflower.  I will make this again.

This was pretty good.  A little plain, but I followed the directions exactly and next time I will add more seasoning to taste; I'll definitely add some crushed red pepper flakes next time.  My one complaint is that I like more tender cauliflower so I may try steaming for a few minutes first or just increasing the cooking time.  After 30 minutes, the cauliflower was still fairly crisp.  Good taste, though, thanks for the recipe!

This was ok.  I love the garlic flavor.  But I think I like my cauliflower more tender.  I guess I will have to cook it longer, next time. I may try this with broccoli.

A great healthy way to add flavor to cauliflower.  To lighten the dish further I reduced the olive oil by half.  The only problem I had was my garlic burned.  I am not sure how to stop that.  But the roasting added a nice touch of flavor to the cauliflower when compared to just steaming.  I will play with the seasoning, but this is a definate make again at our house.

This was really good.  I don't like cauliflower raw but I loved it done this way!  Very garlicy and addicting.  However, I think it would taste a little better if I had cooked it closer to the heating coil... the best pieces were those that got browned.

This was quite good, but I think if I were to make it again, I would break the cauliflower into smaller florets, boil them very briefly, and use much more garlic.

This was very tasty and different from the ho-hum steamed vegetable.  I had a small head of cauliflower but kept the garlic the same, as I love garlic.  I just combined the oil, garlic, s&p in a dish and poured over the florets in a bowl and tossed.  I didn't bother with the cheese/broiling step at the end.  The cauliflower still had a slight nice crunch and not mushy at all.  Squeezed some lemon juice over top at the end.  This is even better cool/warm and I ate it like popcorn.  A nice way to get the veggies.

Strangely, my family likes cauliflower, because they are picky about everything else.  I've made this recipe three different times, changing it a little each time.  

The first time I made it exactly as the recipe said.  My family liked it enough they wanted it again.  The second time I also added a package of dry italian dressing mix.  It was a little salty.  The third time I added italian breadcrumbs with the mparmesan cheese (and only half a packet of dressing).  I liked it that way the best.  But the original recipe is great and my family likes that too.  Thanks for the great beginning!

This is really tasty.  I am constantly trying to eat more vegetables and this recipe helps.  I added extra garlic and served it to guests.  The guests who liked garlic enjoyed it, the ones who did not like garlic did not care for this dish.  But I make it for myself all the time !

This is really good.  I had 2 large heads of cauliflower, so I put them on a cookie sheet instead of a casserole dish.  Cauliflower browned beautifully.  Used lots of extra garlic, too!

Made it with orange cauliflower. Very nice color! Freshly grated peccorino romano adds some nice zip. Maybe my head of cauliflower was too big because I didn't really taste the garlic. I doubled the cheese, but not the garlic. I'll try it with more garlic next time. Definitely a good recipe for guests.

Loved this - what a nice change from the plain old steamed cauliflower that I make!  I reduced the oil to 1 1/2 Tbl., and didn't miss it at all.  I used chopped garlic in a jar (produce section) to save time (was great!).  I baked the dish at 425 because I had a casserole in the oven at the same time - didn't affect it at all.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is soooo good.  I ate half right after it was made and liked it, but the next day when I heated the rest up as leftovers the cheese got melty and it was seriously one of the best things ever.  I would say DONT skimp on the garlic, as the strong garlic flavor is what makes it so great.

Not bad, I really like the flovor of galic on it. I usually steam and then fry the cauliflower in flour and egg batter. Perhaps baking it simply cuts out the steaming out of the process. Mine turned out too oily anyhow.

This recipe deserves 10 stars!  What an easy, wonderful way to cook cauliflower.  I love garlic and doubled the amount.  I also added breadcrumbs to the top with the grated cheese.  Excellent!  Thank you for this recipe.

This is my new favorite side-dish!  Super easy to make and, when using quality ingredients(olive oil and parmesan), this turns out MAGNIFICENT!!  Even my veggie-resitant husband had to agree that this was a good vegetable dish.  Made it for the first time last night and have been planning when I can make this again.

This is such a good recipe. I've made it a few times and have it roasting in the oven as we speak. I use slightly more garlic since we're a garlic lovin' family. Sometimes I toss in some Rosemary for something different.

DELICIOUS! I threw the garlic and cauliflower in a bowl, poured olive oil over it, parmisian cheese, a dash of salt, pepper, and spread it out on a cookie sheet. I baked it at 425 for about 15 minutes before stirring. I then baked it about 10 minutes more. It was so good! We will be making again. I’m doing Keto so this is an excellent recipe for me. Simple and delicious!

This was really good, I followed the instructions from another reviewer to lower temperature to 400 and cook with lid on.  I added cheese and baked with lid off for additional 3 minutes.  A nice healthly tasty option. I did not add parsley.

Excellent!  I served it tonight with a beef fillet for the perfect dinner.  Easy to prepare and experiment with.  Like many other commenters, I used a lidded bowl rather than a plastic bag (so wasteful!) to mix the garlic and oil with the cauliflower (I was able to scrape up all the remaining oil and seasoning to put atop the cauliflower once it left the bowl).  I also added about two teaspoons of finely chopped rosemary from our garden.  I roasted at the recommended temperature and time and didn't cover the glass roasting pan.  It came out just a bit browned after 25 minutes.  Before putting under the broiler, I dusted with a bit of Italian breadcrumbs and then added the parmesan cheese.  I left for five minutes for more color.  Delicious served immediately.  Just crispy enough; so glad that I resisted the temptation to cover. My husband, who does most of the cooking in our house, was very impressed.

First time out, I mixed the cheese with the olive oil and mixed. I still added 1/3 cup of cheese and some hulled sesame seeds before the broil. Very good. Next time I'll do it right.

I don't really care for cauliflower. However, wanting to deviate from the usual veggies that I've been cooking and knowing that my husband is a fan of cauliflower, I decided to give it a try. I followed the recipe and it turned out great! I even thought it was good. I doubt cauliflower will ever be at the top of my list of vegetable choices, however, this is definitely a keeper and I plan to add it as part of our ongoing family meals.

My only change was putting it on a foil covered baking sheet. The great thing is this is a great base for all different kinds of spices! Use what you love!

Everyone gobbled it up! My 4-year old swore he hated it (before he tried it), and then served himself more than his required two bites.

Made it exactly as written. I loved it. My husband thought it was too salty, I think because of the Parmesan. Will try eliminating the salt next time and maybe putting a little less Parmesan. I’ll let you know.

I only had shredded mozzarella, worked great. I also let the florets marinate in the garlic and oil for about an hour til it was time to cook. Definately cover the pot.

I used purple cauliflower from the Farmers Market which made it a little more festive! I use a bowl with a lid to cut down plastic use-it coats just the same . Great recipe-no changes needed.

Delicious! I would recommend not mincing the garlic too fine. It can have a tendency to burn. Make sure you stir halfway. Will definitely make this again.

Absolutely don't cover the baking dish. The point is to get it soft and sweet on the inside and crunchy and caramelized and salty on the  outside, almost blackened. It becomes like veggie candy. It doesn't keep well. You need to eat it hot and crunchy out of the oven so it should be the last thing you pull out. I skip broiling by baking at 475 with lots of tossing and watching. Make a lot because it reduces down when you cook it this way. Even the very brown, very crunchy bits are delish.  This is my absolute favorite veg and I can literally eat it like candy.

I made this for company last weekend.  Delicious but I think I would cut back on the cooking time a bit.  I added this to my favorites and I will make it again.  Great replacement for potatoes.

Adding additional garlic was an improvement.  Needs additional roasting time to soften the cauliflower.

Yummy! I made this pretty much as directed, with what I had available. I drizzled the olive oil (messy if you do it as directed), and added the Parmesan after roasting the cauliflower until almost done. Much more health friendly than all the heavy cheese sauces, and my family liked it better! Thanks!

It has a great flavor.  I agree with some comments that covering it with a lid is pointless and prevents it from caramelizing.   It cooks fine without messing with it.

Yes, I will make it again and I did add a few more seasonings to the olive oil and minced garlic. I added 2 tbs of minced garlic, 1 & 1/2 tsp cilantro with lime and 1 tsp fennel. It was delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

I love lots of garlic so I adjusted the amount to my own taste. After combining garlic, olive oil and cauliflower I left it to marinate for a few hours. Really brought out the flavor of the garlic. Everyone enjoyed it. Will make it again.

I added cajun spice to the recipe and thyme. tossed it all in a bowl with the oil and salt and pepper. I cut the florets up into bite size pieces.. and i tossed with my hands to make sure all the oil was distributed well. I will not be adding parsley just the cheese to give it a cheese flavor.

Seriously amazing. I made for a Passover Seder because it looked easy and had good reviews. My only problem was that I only made one head of cauliflower. I could have had three and still had no leftovers. Thank you so much!!!!

Love this!  It would have been a 5 even as is, but I did tweak a bit. Used 1 more tablespoon of garlic and probably doubled the cheese. Regardless, it was great!  If you are looking for a super soft, steamed cauliflower, cover....but that isn’t this recipe. It’s still soft this way, just a different texture.

I used half a head of cauliflower and maybe  a couple tablespoons of cheese to keep it cleaner. We all love cauliflower, so this will go into a rotation of how to prepare it! Thank you!

I made this as it was intended, in an open pan. You can’t roast when it’s in a covered casserole. Someone else pointed out that their’s was mushy when they did this. That’s because it’s steamed. I cooked mine in a countertop oven and just dropped it down to the bottom rack, to avoid burning. It turned out great.

This is definitely healthier that a cheese covered recipe (which I was looking for). Next time I will at least mix most of the parsley in with the garlic and oil, leaving a little to sprinkle on later. I might also try adding a little Italian seasoning to the mix as well.

Simply delicious. A couple of tweaks, I added a little more olive oil to the cauliflower before shaking. I then topped it with Pam spray before putting the dish in the oven.  I have made this with and without the cheese, both ways it turns out very tasty!

Hubby and I both liked it. I didn’t use the Parmesan cheese, just cuz I didn’t have any and was making it on a whim. Next time I’d use a roasting pan instead of a casserole dish just because it didn’t crisp up the way roasted Bessie’s should. It was a bit mushy. Otherwise, it was great.

Made it exactly as written in my toaster oven using a Pyrex dish. It ended up a little burnt so next time I will reduce the temperature. Delicious as written! Thank you!
12/5/19 I used an eco green baking sheet in my oven, not toaster oven and I loosely covered it with aluminum foil for 10 minutes. Yep, mushy but not burnt. I uncovered for the next 10 minutes and some of  the florets were burnt. Put into a pyrex before broiling with cheese and, I love the taste but it's still not ready to serve to guests. I'm looking for the perfect cooking feedback. Thanks. 1/27/20 Oiled glass pyrex, baked at 400 for 10 minutes, turned and baked for 12 more than broiled on high with cheese for 3 minutes. Perfect! Not soggy! Not burnt! And yes, it was uncovered.

This is a great recipe. I mistakenly combined the cheese with the rest of the ingredients but it didn't deter the results.  We all loved it and it was done sooner than the recipe called for. Thanks for sharing!!

I find that 450 degrees is too high a temperature, so we cook ours at 425 on a baking sheet. Also, we mix everything on the sheet instead of in a bag. Garlic powder works in a pinch, but fresh is better. Overall, very good recipe.

I used a bowl to mix the ingredients, and I substituted the garlic for a seasoning mix, but it worked perfectly! My family loved it! Even my dad, who hates cauliflower!

Overall, I enjoyed this side dish, but my only problem is that this recipe calls for too much garlic. I usually love a strong garlic flavor, but for some reason the flavor this time was too overpowering.

Using others’ suggestions, I followed the recipe as written but reduced oven temperature to 400. The garlic turned bitter (as can happen when exposed to high temperatures) and the cauliflower wasn’t particularly amazing. My family ate it but no rave reviews. Btw, they are accustomed to fresh vegetables and healthy meals, and eat cauliflower regularly.

Cooked it a full 30 minutes because I didn't add the cheese and used roasted minced garlic because that's all I had, but this was very pretty and very tasty. I will do it this way again for sure.

I think I have made this 20 times. Absolutely love it. I will sometimes use Romano because that is what I have on hand and never am organized enough, or to lazy, to add parsley. Delish!

I am not a regular eater of cauliflower but this recipe was fantastic. I doubled the olive oil and used minced garlic. I prepared small florets in a freezer bag with the oil, garlic, salt and pepper and let it sit for two hours. I cooked it a bit longer than the recipe calls for and added the cheese at the end, with another 10 minutes to brown it slightly. Italian flat parsley generously sprinkled over the top. Wow what a hit!

A delicious and different way to prepare cauliflower!  I used a bag of refrigerated flowerettes from Trader Joe's. I didn't use fresh garlic because I was afraid of it burning at the high temp. Instead I used garlic and onion powders (easier, too!). Put on a foil-lined cookie sheet instead of a casserole dish. Broiled only for 3 min after the fresh parsley and parmesan was added. Delicious  flavor from the parmesan, and the cauliflower browns but is not crispy and melts in your mouth.

I first made this recipe because I had a ton of cauliflower left over from another recipe and I had all the other ingredients.  I don't have a casserole dish so I cooked it in a normal baking pan and it worked just fine.

This is simply amazing!!!  What I mean is,  it's 'simple' and 'amazing'.....literally.  I did realize though that the smaller pieces were the best so next time I will make sure to cut the cauliflower in all small pieces. Wonderful way to fix cauliflower....and healty too!!!!

I wound up cooking longer, probably depends how small your pieces are. Also don’t create more plastic waste by using a bag - this can be mixed in the baking dish. Delish! Thanks!

Made the recipe, increased to serve 20 people. I used fresh grated parmesan. It is delicious! Nice and moist and the garlic is not at all over powering. Will definitely make again.

Yes, please!!!!

This is fabulous. I love roasted cauliflower anyway; this is a very simple recipe but is just perfect!

As a warning, the cauliflower shrinks when it bakes. Two people can easily eat an entire head (this is really good!) so make extra if you have more people.

Great staple vegetable side dish with lots of ways to customize as far as flavour.  My only complaint would be that 25 minutes at 450 degrees makes for garlic bits that are slightly too burnt/bitter for my liking.  I will likely try this again at 400 for 35 minutes.

It  was very flavorful and had a great crunch. I had some difficulty getting the oil and garlic onto the florets. There was way too much garlic stuck to the inside of the plastic bag. Any trick to this? Otherwise, the garlic flavor made the cauliflower one of the best side dishes ever!

Excellent as written!  Leave uncovered to roast.  Just watch it and stir as needed if starting to burn.   Cooked ours for 20 minutes - perfect, and we've never liked any cooked cauliflower before.   Thank you!

Huge kudos to Shelley on this one!!! This side dish is absolutely amazing! My family and friends always ask for it when they come over for dinner. I use a ton of garlic & black pepper and omit the parsley, but there are never any leftovers and it’s sooo easy to make.

Delicious! I was not a fan of cauliflower until I decided to prepare it this way.  Love it.  Skipped adding salt as the parmesan brings a rich salty flavor.

Wonderful recipe.  Followed the advice of others and combined the oil and garlic in the baking dish and tossed the cauliflower there.  Other than adding a little more garlic, I didn't change a thing.  I will definitely make this again.

meh.  followed the recipe spot on, not hard to do.  cauliflower tastes like the spices you put on it, and the texture is dialed in according to cook time, the longer the softer.
not bad at all.  tasted like Cauliflower with garlic & oil on it.  
just nothing worth writing home about.  
I'm home, so I'm not gonna write about it.
next.

Cauliflower never tasted so good. I'll keep this around for a while. Just be sure to stir it and don't let the garlic burn.

Wonderful!  Also reduced oven temp to 400, and these were so delicious we snacked in the leftovers thru the week instead of chips ??

We loved it, it's a great way to get your veggies. Made half with and without cheese to save some calories, both were good.

I made this cauliflower dish and we LOVED it!  The texture and strong roasted garlic flavor made this dish a hit with us. Next time I will buy a larger head of cauliflower so there’s is more to go around.

The taste was really good but it wasn't cooked all the way through.  I covered it during the baking part so it wouldn't brown so quickly or dry out.

I thought it was a 3 (average) but my fiance is still raving about it a day later. Light, crunchy, with so much flavour is how he described the dish. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out well. It just wasn't a 'wow' dish to me. I will make again because he likes it so much and there is nothing wrong with it.

Great way to make cauliflower, this will definitely be a go-to for a side dish.  I really like garlic so I put a generous amount in the bag.  I also only cooked at 400F similar to other reviews.

I didn't make any changes but next time I will add some red pepper flakes and maybe a little less olive oil which depends on the size of the head of cauliflower.  It was tasty though.

The texture came out perfect. The right exact cooking time and temperature was given. I add as much seasoning as I like. I usually add more to my liking but was so impressed the way it turned out. I was worried it would be under or over cooked. I am not the greatest when it comes to roasting vegetables. Thanks for the recipe. Will be saving this one!

Fantastic way to make cauliflower! I double the garlic and heated it in the oil for 5 minutes on low to infuse the oil. Then I covered the cauliflower and let it marinate for a few hours. I also halved the cheese, and there was still plenty. It was delicious, it's not often the vegetable bowl gets scraped clean!

Add sun dried tomatoes before baking!!! Also add a bit more Parmesan cheese before baking.  Bake at 400 degrees for 20 or 25 minutes.  I really liked a lot, Gene liked too.  Refer to Xynthee’s review.

Add a few slices of onion and toss in some thyme.
Just toss it all in a bowl, no need for the plastic bag.
Use parchment paper to ease cleanup.
No need to cover.

Awesome!

nothing to write home about. Nothing wrong either, just a bit bland although an improvement over just steamed cauliflower.

This recipe was very good, however, my garlic started to get too brown so at the halfway mark I took out the garlic chunks that I could to save to add after the cauliflower was completely roasted. Will definitely roast cauliflower this way again.

I am not a big cauliflower fan but this was quite good. I agree with lowering the temp to 400 and not needing to broil the cheese at the end. And no stinky cauliflower smell!

This was really tasty! I did reduce temperature to 400 degrees instead of 450 and put foil loosely over the top as suggested by others for the first 20 minutes. Was a big hit with the family!

Wow! I followed this recipe exactly except that I cooked it for 25 min at 425 as some reviewers said it was starting to burn. This is my new go to recipe for cauliflower and any other vegetable I decide to roast. Very easy and really really good!

I hate cauliflower. My husband loves it. I've been looking for a way I can cook it that even I like it. I made no alterations to this, and it was delicious. Even I enjoyed it and will happily make it again.

Made this recipe very closely to stated, just used a different cheese.  We used Cheddar and only because we had it on hand. Cauliflower was delicious and will make again and again.
Thanks!

Turned out so yummy! I mixed the salt and pepper in with everything in the bag instead. I also mixed some shredded mozzarella into the cauliflower towards the end of baking in addition to sprinkling parm. I will definitely be making this again! My two year old even ate some :)

I made it exactly as written.... with one minor exception but don't know if it affected the outcome. In a desire to be better prepped for dinner with company, I prepared a number of things in advance. I cut up the cauliflower and added it to the bag with salt, pepper, garlic and oil and left it in the fridge for 24 hours before cooking it. It was amazing. So tasty and a big hit with all. Next time!

I steamed cauliflower for 12 min. Also, cut as much stem off as I could- Used mostly the flower. Added about 1/4 c. chopped onion to 2 cloves garlic and cooked in 2 Tbs olive oil. Followed prep directions exactly. Finally, tasty and creamy cauliflower!

Loved it! Baked at 400 for 35- 40 mins but that's only because I added chunks of sweet potatoes to the mix. Also added some garlic powder. Some chili powder would have given it a nice lil kick. Oooooo or some vinegar based hot sauce. Yum!

This was fabulous!!! To keep the garlic from burning, I did not mince or chop, but rather smashed the cloves and drizzled with a little olive oil and salt, then added halfway  through the cooking time. Cooked at 400F for 40 min to get edges crispy and browned. Seasoned with lemon pepper, sea salt, dried parsley, and a little garlic powder. Skipped the parm because we didn't have any on hand and I was too lazy to run to the store!?? Turned out terrific anyway! Thanks for sharing!

Nothing amazing, but I am not really a cauliflower fan and this was pretty good and easy. I didn't have any fresh parmesan, but the grated worked pretty well.

You can use a little less oil and more cheese and garlic.

I used coconut oil instead of olive, and added sliced carrots since I happened to have them on hand.  Did not change anything about the baking temperature or time. The results were perfect! This will be my go-to cauliflower dish from now on!

This has become a favorite side dish in my household! What an easy and tasty way to incorporate cauliflower into our diets. I prepare it per the recipe, though I do the mixing in a large bowl instead of a bag (helps keep the garlic with the cauliflower instead of sticking to the side of the bag). I've also found that I can skip the broiling step at the end--it works just as well to add the Parmesan 3-5 minutes from the end time.

I found  a forlorn cauliflower in the bargain bin, cut off the few little brown spots, and followed this recipe, adding plenty of salt and pepper to taste.   WOW!   I ate almost the whole pan like candy.

OK it wasn't done exactly the same way, BUT WOW . . .   

. . . I microwaved a cut-up head of cauliflower first,  THEN looked for a recipe and found this one. Had no fresh garlic, parsley, or olive oil left, so I used dried parsley, garlic powder, and butter. But I did have fresh Parmesan cheese (yay!) I did not measure the add-ins, just sprinkled away, zapped it for 2 more minutes, and WOW was this delicious!  Everyone loved it and wanted more. I can't wait to re-stock my kitchen with fresh ingredients and try this cauliflower roasted in the oven.

Simple, easy and delicious. Even those who really hate to spend time in the kitchen will fall in love with this quick and simple recipe. The combination of spices and cheese really brings out the flavor of the cauliflower. I followed the suggestion of others by making the cauliflower pieces as uniform as possible and bite-size. I also cooked covered with foil. Instead of adding the parmesan and parsley later, I combined all of the ingredients into the plastic bag, shook until coated and baked as directed without stirring midway. It turned out spectacular.

This recipe is really easy to make and so delicious. I was looking for a way to add more cauliflower to my diet and this recipe is really good.  I added a lot more garlic and ginger and this recipe would be a nice compliment to say marinated salmon or as a tasty side dish.  Can't wait to make it again soon. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe certainly roasted the cauliflower. My husband and I love roasted vegetables. I will make this again, but make some changes that will make it my own. (Add whole garlic cloves that have been marinated in a bit of olive oil; cut some red peppers in large chunks; 1 large sweet onion cut into large wedges.)

My family LOVED this and I made it exactly according to the recipe.  Next time I think I'll add some bacon pieces just for added crunch but it was DELICIOUS as is.  Big flavor, great bite, and super easy.  I served it with Chicken Sopressata (from Eating Well Magazine March/April 2017), farfalle pasta with basil pesto and a mixed green salad with lemon vinigarette,

Made it according to the directions.  I thought it was very bland.  It needed salt and I'm not sure what else.  Don't think I will make it again.  One thing I would recommend it cooking it less time.

I like to slice the cauliflower instead of breaking apart the florets. I'll eat just this for dinner.

I used seasoning salt, garlic salt (which had a little parsley in it), and toss with the olive oil, and pepper.  The caramelized parm was almost as good as a dessert!  I will make this over and over and over.  So healthy, so beautiful and delicious.

My family loved this! This only thing I don't like is when the garlic becomes bitter from over-cooking, but perhaps that can be avoided somehow? Or I can just use another herb. Other than that, it's a healthy and very tasty way to enjoy cauliflower (and get kids to eat it!). I would recommend this recipe to others and I will make this again.

I agree with the suggestion to not over-roast it, and use as much garlic as you want.  Delicious.  You will wish you had doubled the recipe.  I added mushrooms to the mix for fun.

A hit with all four of us!!  I eye-balled instead of measured and didn't  have parsley.  But followed the basic directions. Crispy and yummy!   Will definitely make this again. And again. And again.

It turned out perfectly following the recipe exactly as written. I used shredded pecorino which is an Italian cheese very similar to parmesan, but made of sheep cheese because I'm allergic to cow and goat. It definitely gave the cauliflower an entirely new flavor and it was pretty easy.

I followed the recipe, except for baking at 400F, and enjoyed the finished product very much.  I can't imagine covering the dish while it baked.  It's the roasted aspect that makes this dish unique.  I would make it again.

Pretty good, steamed it with the cover on - then removed the cover to brown. Browned slightly and the cheese melted. I think if I made it again, I would rather use a flatter pan to bake and brown it. Might not cover it. Thanks!

So easy and so delicious. I used frozen cauliflower florets, so even avoided the cutting! And cooked just enough to bake in a toaster oven. Did not even use a deep casserole dish.

I made no changes and wouldn't change a thing!  This was so amazing. I actually made it thinking it would be a great low carb side for me and my husband for dinner, but when the kids tasted it they gobbled it up. We barely got any of it. My stepdaughter told me to not tell her mom that she ate "that white stuff", lol. It was a winner with not just the adults, but all 4 kids as well. Thank you!

I've roasted cauliflower on a cookie sheet, prepared as in this recipe, and can never get everything to roast evenly. But roasting in a casserole was entirely different! The cauliflower came out evenly browned, and wonderfully flavorful! I did not cover the casserole and I stirred it a few times. Perfect!

I made this in the oven and it was a hit time over time. I started to make it as a side dish or a meal on its own. To save on time I would pan fry the cauliflower vs, roast. This method was faster and it still came out the same. I preferred this method, not only for the time saver but also for the char made on the cauliflower.

Amazing. Made it as the recipe calls for except I didn't have olive oil on hand so I used coconut oil instead. Not sure how much this affected the flavor but it was delicious. My father who normally doesn't even care for cauliflower enjoyed this dish.

The only change I made was to substitute shredded jack cheese for the parmesan. I probably didn't exactly follow the baking directions, just watched the dish and brought it out from the oven when it seemed about done. The cauliflower tasted and smelled great and was cooked well. Great recipe.

Made it exactly like the recipe and came out amazing!! I added a sprinkling of sugar when it was on the place since I add sugar to absolutely everything.  Needed to adjust nothing.

I spread the cauliflower on a baking sheet. Once roasted, sprinkled with parmasean, allowed it to brown, then removed. Let sit for 5 mins to 'firm' up. Delish!!

Basically prepared it per recipe with possibly a bit more garlic.  I also didn't have any fresh parsley, but I did have fresh basil so used that instead and it was fabulous!

Simply delicious!  It was a GREAT Thanksgiving side dish!  The only change I made was to cook it WITH brussels sprouts  and add a bit more oil because of the extra volume of vegetables and it was amazing.  I thought it might be too much garlic but went ahead and added what the recipe called for.  When the garlic was raw the garlic aroma was so strong but after cooking it was perfect.  I used the parmesan cheese that comes in the little tub in the deli section instead of the powdery shake-on variety--don't know if it matters but mine turned out great.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I cannot say what the author of the recipe intended in regards to covered or uncovered, (because it is not specified to cover it, I assumed not). I made this actually on a cookie sheet (I dropped my casserole and it being of advanced age it shattered). I did not cover it but spread it out and allowed it to slightly brown. My family is begging me to make it again this week, and they NEVER ask for Veggies, well with the exception of my home canned beans, but that is another story. Anyway I agree with Granny Bird and others that this is "simply the best way to cook cauliflower that I have ever had".  Thank you for posting it and sharing it!

5 stars because my husband actually ate it, and he HATES cauliflower! I cut the florets as uniform as possible, only tossed it with olive oil and salt. I loosely covered with foil to get it a bit soft (i have a 1 and 1/2 year old) for about 10min. After removing the foil, I stirred and roasted for another 10-15min. I didn't have time to roast the parmesan so I just tossed it in right after it was done. If I have time the next go around I will definitely roast with the parmesan!

This recipe is very good and easy to make.  The garlic/califlower/roasted flavor combination is wonderful.  Other reviewers suggested covering it, but I prefer the more roasted flavor, so I cooked it uncovered for 20 minutes and it was still a bit crisp as I prefer.

Very easy variation for cauliflower. I followed someone else's suggestion of baking 20 minutes at 400-degress, increasing the heat towards the end of the baking time. I found that broiling for 3 minutes was sufficient after adding the shredded parmesan -- the vegetable didn't become overcooked; the browned melted cheese was so tasty!

This was a phenomenal recipie! I followed the suggestions by marinating the cauliflower with garlic in oil, salt and paprika (instead of just pepper), cooking at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and broiling for 5 after adding cheese and panko crumbs. Holy Schniekies! I could eat the whole dish by myself. I will be making this dish again(and again).

No changes.  Add as much garlic as you like.  I cook long and slower, so I have to cover the cauliflower for the first 15 minutes or so.

This is a good and easy recipe, probably for those who like cauliflower a little more than my family does. I thought it was fine, my littlest one ate it but my older daughter did not and my husband wasn't impressed, but really doesn't care for cauliflower. So, easy, decent, probably better for those who actually like the vegetable.

It was really good although the Parmesan left it a little dry. The next time I make it I believe I will substitute Romano for Parmesan. I think bacon bits would add a nice change as well.

Simple and good. My 7 and 11 year old liked it (although they like vegetables). I liked it b/c I could quickly prep it and not think about it while I cooked other things. As an aspiring vegan, I skipped the cheese.

Very tasty. Used rice noodles instead of spaghetti and kids still ate it up. Used extra garlic and lots of Grand Padano Parmesan.

Unlike some reviewers decreasing Parmesan, I added more than called for (1/2 cup) as well as 3 tablespoons garlic and it was awesome!

I prefer the 2013 recipe for Smoky Cauliflower ...drizzle florets with olive oil and a little butter, salt, tsp. of smoked paprika Toss to coat and bake uncovered in a 15-in. x 10-in. x1 in. pan for 10 minutes Stir in 2 minced garlic cloves ( or as much as you like )and bake 10-15 min. longer or until cauliflower is tender and slightly browned. Sprinkle with  a little bit of fresh minced parsley. Simple . With the florets cut small, there is no need to cook or steam them before roasting.

This is the only way I'll eat cauliflower! Don't go heavy on the Parmesan cheese- it's better wih just a light sprinkling.

this was pretty good! I think for me the key was don't be stingy on the salt and be liberal with the parmesan. also, make sure all the florets are broken up about as small as the smallest florets so they bake through at the same speed. not mindblowing, but would make again.

I followed the directions exactly. Since these are roasted you really shouldn't cover them. Otherwise, they are no longer roasted... they are steamed. However, if you like steamed veggies, go for it!!! The seasoning, although simple, was superb!

I reduced the oven temp to 380, and stirred every 10 minutes for 30 minutes uncovered...the garlic got a bit blackend but this did add a nice flavor...next time I may use half butter with the olive oil...we loved it and will make this dish again

This is a perfect recipe. I followed the instructions and roasted uncovered for 25 minutes. Just perfect. Only change I made was adding red pepper for color. Will defiantly make again.

This was really good. I used kosher salt to taste instead of regular table salt. I baked covered for 15 mins, uncovered for 5 minutes. Then broiled on high for five minutes. The texture was perfect- not mushy and not too crunchy.

I followed the directions exactly.  It is crunchy and the "burned" portions of the cauliflower add a nice roasted flavor.  If you like very soft cauliflower, you might want to follow some of the other comments that lowered the heat or covered the dish.

Made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit. Everyone raved about the flavor and the fact that the cauliflower still had some crunch to it which they loved. I loved the fact that it was super easy and not a ton of ingredients. Next time I make it, I might add more cheese, because, well, more cheese is always better! LOL

We loved this.  To be fair I had a computer problem after finding recipe so just made it from memory.  I added a bunch of asparagus in bite sized pieces and added cajun salt and Tabasco.  I probably used more olive oil as I didn't measure.  I put it on 2 baking sheets covered with non-stick foil.  I topped it all with a cup and a half of shredded Parmesan and put in to bake at 450.  I cooked it about 15 minutes until the cheese had become brown and crusty and found the veggies perfect!!  It was WONDERFUL!!  Thanks so much!

Before seeing this recipe, I have been making this for a couple years now.  My daughter in law, who wouldnt eat vegetables, tried this and loves it.  She makes it now at her house.  I also add other veges, like sliced carrots, brocolli,  hal ed brussle sprouts.  I make in large batches on cookie sheets and freeze in ziplock bags loosly so i can then get out as much as we want per meal.  My daughter in law, is the one who started adding the garlic.  We loved it so much I have started using it also.

Delicious! I love veggies, but have hated cauliflower my entire life. Hubby loves cauliflower, so decided to check out some recipes. I'm very happy at how easy and tasty this one is! The reason I only give it 4 stars is because i didn't follow the recipe exactly. I doubled the garlic and added a good bit (6+ shakes?) of Scotch bonnet pepper sauce. I now love cauliflower.  :)

Very good! Even the kids liked it. Only reason it isn't 5 star is because I plan on twerking it next time and steam the cauliflower a bit before roasting. We like it super tender.

Wow. Best cauliflower ever!! I'm tired of creamy sauces drowning the cauliflower, and I bought a head of golden cauli today to try instead of plain white. 

Phenomenal. I only did half a head and wish I'd done the whole head as I fed two others as well and they wanted seconds of it. An a1 winner.

Don't cover it - it steams. Leave uncovered in middle shelf and keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn. I'm going to try again tomorrow night but use some leftover ricotta I have instead of parmesan.

We make this frequently and sometimes combine it with broccoli, and lemon pepper.  Shallots instead of garlic is also a good alternative.  Have fun with this basic recipe and enjoy!

OMG, delish!! I sprinkled it with bread crumbs just prior to adding the parmesan cheese and it really made a difference. I used Italian seasoning instead of parsley. This was sooo good; I'm definitely going to be making this again. Thank you!!

Very easy and quick dish with a wonderful flavor. Made it in the same casserole side by side with bite sized red potatoes, which were seasoned the same as the cauliflower, just added salt pepper and rosemary before putting it in the oven. Same cook time and temperature.

Delicious!  My husband and I LOVED this recipe.  It simple and healthy.  Can't go wrong with this one.  I used minced garlic (from a jar) and I covered the dish with foil for at least 1/2 of he cooking time.  I set my stove at 425 degrees.  Aside from those minor tweaks I followed the recipe as written.  I'll be making this dish again for sure!

Really good..except plastic bag did not work well...too much garlic and oil left behind...instead mix  all ingredients well right in casserole dish. I used speed bake at 425 degrees and stirred every 6 minutes...topped with Parmesan and bakes 3 minutes more...very good.....most good delis sell this for almost $10 a pound.

Very very easy and everyone loves it. I added asiago cheese to the parmesan because it's my favorite cheese. Other than that,  I did everything thing the same. I wouldn't cover the dish while cooking... no need to steam it. Cooks perfect with the olive oil. Thank you for sharing!!!

Could use a little more flavor and less time under broil because it did burn a little bit. But all in all was really good and went very well with the chicken parmesan.

This was great!  I used orange cauliflower and smashed garlic since I do not like minced. I also used crushed nuts on top with the parsley because I am avoiding dairy (parmesan).  It was great and will do it again. It was not soggy.  It did not burn - just had to watch the broiler as always....  Creamy and delicious!

I am now officially addicted to roasted cauliflower!  I mix the cauliflower with chopped onion, olive oil and minced garlic in a large glass bowl, NO plastic bag.  Bake uncovered at 425 for 20 minutes, give it a stir then sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese and put back in the oven for 10 more minutes.  No measuring anything, just add until it looks good.  I've made a batch every week since I came across this yummy recipe.

This was a great change from the plain ol'  steamed cauliflower I usually make. The only change I made was to reduce the oven temperature to 425 degrees. I'll definitely make this again!

I'll only use this recipe for roasted cauliflower! Delicious! Even my picky kids loved it and even went for seconds! And that's saying a lot! Use only fresh garlic though! The garlic plays a big role here.

Very nice. Could use extra parmesan and parsley and an additional 1tbs oil. Didn't require a lid and didn't burn. Turned out perfect, although did have oven set a little lower. Hubby and I enjoyed this, however, 11yo wasn't sold! lol Thanks for a great recipe. Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe. My husband even likes it. We like a little heat in our cooking so I added a bit of red pepper flakes to the bag before adding the cauliflower. It was great. I wish I'd made a larger head of cauliflower.

Delicious.  Needs a little adjustment - next time I would not put the raw garlic on the cookie sheet at the beginning of the cooking process at 450 degrees.  It got way to crispy and overcooked, near bitter.   I would sauté it separately on stove top while cauliflower is roasting and then sprinkle over top with the fresh parsley when done. Or I would put the raw garlic in with the roasting cauliflower when only 10 minutes left on cooking time.  Be careful of 450 degrees - start high, then reduce to 425 and watch it all the time.  It needs to get browned up to taste good.  Not steamed. Using a cookie sheets lets it brown up crispy. Other than that it's so wonderful.  I personally did not care for the parmesan cheese on top so I would offer it in a bowl for each guest to take if wanted.  Thanks you for this great recipe.

This was good, easy and a nice change.  I prepared as recipe stated except I added a splash of onion powder.   My husband liked it and that is a plus. The second time I made it, I added a small sprinkle of cheddar cheese with the Parmesan.   Very good.

Awesome. I cooked mine at 400 degrees because I wanted to keep the pieces a little larger and I wanted them to cook through. I also used garlic powder instead of fresh because I was worried about the burned/bitterness. I flipped the pieces half way through and didn't bother with the broiler. They browned up nicely just the same.

I couldn't bear to add an oily plastic bag to a landfill, so I simply put the oil and garlic in a large plastic salad bowl and threw in the cauliflower and tossed with a slotted spoon until thoroughly coated. Also, because I was bringing this dish to a pot luck, instead of broiling at the very end, I let it cool down after cooking and put the cheese and parsley on it at my destination and left it in a warming oven while we had drinks and apps, and it came out fine.

Yum,  but recommend trading the bag for a mixing bowl. A lot of the garlic  and oil coat the bag, and is lost unless you scrape it out, which is tricky. Much easier to turn the florets/garlic/ oil over a few times in a mixing bowl which is then easily scraped out with a spatula. Also, you can't reuse that sealable bag, so it is not environment-friendly.
I mixed my parmesean with Panko crumbs to give this a crispy topping. Lower heat for sure: 375-400 until tender.

This is so delicious!  My new favorite way to make cauliflower.  I used coconut oil instead of olive oil.

Just made this and both my husband (who is not a big veggie eater) and my toddler loved it.  I decreased the heat to 400 degrees and cooked for the full 25 minutes.  I did not cover.  I used fresh garlic (a whole bulb for a large head of cauliflower; we are huge garlic lovers).  After pouring it into the casserole dish, I sprinkled with a little sea salt and garlic powder.  Don't forget to stir it halfway through.  I didn't have any issues with sogginess or burning.

The exception I made to the recipe was to roast the cauliflower on a sheet pan, rather than bake it in a casserole dish.  I also followed another reviewer's advice and mixed the cauliflower with the oil and garlic  in a bowl rather than a plastic bag.  It was quite tasty.

Excellent!!! Cauliflower has a strong taste naturally that is why so many people try to tame it with cheese. But with this recipe you don't need to tame the natural flavor, it is perfect and mild!!! WOW!! Thank you  so very much for the recipe!!

Yum! This was a hit with the whole family, including the very picky 6 yr old!  I added in some broccoli and green beans that needed using, used garlic salt (because I had it), and mozzarella cheese instead of parmesan (again because it's what I had, and hubby despises parmesan).  Hands down our new favorite way to do veggies!

I love this recipe.  It's easy, delicious, and also great served as a cold snack the next day.  Use good shredded Parmesan (not grated) and it's hard to go wrong, just watch your oven so it doesn't burn.

Excellent, simple, delicious way to make cauliflower. I used seasoned salt instead of salt and pepper. Read reviews and decided to add an extra minced clove of garlic and toss in casserole dish instead of bag. Everything else I did as written. Some garlic that stuck to the dish did burn. No big deal. There was enough on the cauliflower for the flavor to come through. Very very tasty. Now I just have to stop myself from eating the whole thing at once!

YUM!!!  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly and made only one alteration in preparation.  Instead of tossing the olive oil, garlic and cauliflower in a sealed plastic bag I tossed them in a large glass bowl (as recommended in a previous review).  I will most DEFINITELY make this again.  Going forward I will omit adding salt during preparation as the Parmesan was enough.

Yum!  Made recipe as directed and LOVED the flavors.  I added a bit more oil after tossing in plastic bag cause a lot of it stuck to the inside of the bag along with the garlic.  Sprinkled a bit more garlic on it too.  Very easy to prep and bake.  Will make this again!

I really liked the flavor of this, but I had the same issue with burning. I loosely covered with foil but the bits of garlic & oil on the bottom of the pan burned. I'll try this again but with lower heat.

This is a really yummy recipe!! I changed the spice level to my preference though. I added some red chilli powder and some garam masala. Didn't add cheese because my husband is lactose intolerant. And instead of parsley, I used cilantro. Still turned out mouth watering. Couldn't stop eating it!

I think this simple recipe actually sparked a liking for cauliflower!  My family actually wanted to eat cauliflower!  The only thing I changed was omitting the Parmesan cheese and added a couple pinches of paprika.

I didn't have parm, so I sprinkled some mozzarella over the top right before turning on the broiler. I thought this was really good!   I used a sheet pan covered with foil for less clean up and 25 min was perfect.

Very good!   We added 1/3 cup of bread crumbs too because my husband was trying to duplicate a recipe that he had at work.   Perfect cook time!

OMG BEST CAULIFLOWER EVER!  But I always spread it out on a baking sheet, skip the casserole dish and the cover, you want to ROAST it to a browned, sweet perfection, YUM!

I haven't made this yet but I have had deep fried cauliflower and it is absolutely delicious. But I wanted to find a better way to eat it,  and now I found one.  All the reviews sound great.  Everyone who has made it said it was good.  Can't wait to try it.

Good, but not as tasty as I had hoped it would be. Added a few cloves of roasted garlic, which added the zing I was looking for. If I made it again, I'd probably add an entire head of roasted garlic to it.

Delicious. Prepared as written except garlic powder instead of fresh.  Used silver cookie sheet.

Or just olive oil, salt, pepper, 400 degrees for 20mons if cut small. Yum.

Added a little thyme and Italian seasoning just because, mixed in a bowl and cooked on a foil covered cookie sheet. Cooking times were right on for the size of my flowerettes - about same size as ones in the picture.

I made this recipe and was not overwhelmed by the result.  Cauliflower has a delicate flavor that doesn't deserve to be mowed over by so much garlic, in my opinion.  Way too much trouble for a veggie that's costing over $4.00 a head in my area.  And that head is smaller than a softball.

Amazing recipe.  Cauliflower cooked down so much that I wished I had made two heads of cauliflower.  Could probably serve 4 people better than 6.   I didn't have fresh parsley and just used dried... it still turned out delicious!  Best cauliflower recipe!

Fantastic!! Love this recipe and its so easy to tweak for variety. I've used several kinds if cheese, and my favorite is Aged Dutch. I also like to add red pepper flakes for a little kick. AND I've tried some of those fancy flavored olive oils, and find the garlic is the best. The truffle is really interesting, if you like that. My mother who has always shunned cauliflower likes this recipe. Score!

Made as recommended, although I used baking dish instead of a casserole.  That made two layers of cauliflower which I stirred midway though.  The cauliflower was perfectly done, roasted, tender not mushy.

I added lots of whole cloves of garlic, and a sliced onion.  Loved it.  I used parchment paper to keep the roasting pan easy to clean up.

Wonderful!  Definitely needed salt, I try not to add any until it's cooked.  Luckily, I have the luxury of having Grade A Parmesan to grate into it.  Next time, I think I'll add sun-dried tomatoes and some black olives with some italian seasoning!  If you're not making a whole head of cauliflower, don't cook as long!

I roasted the cauliflower drizzled with a little olive oil for about 15 min @425 and then finished it as the recipe said-my housemate couldn't wait till I made it again-he actually requested it 2 days later!

Ok I do not like cauliflower, I have never liked cauliflower. I tolerate it because it exists and other people like it, namely, my fiance. I LOVE this recipe. It is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! I used a gruyere instead of pares an and it was to die for!! THANK YOU!

Delicious! I used frozen cauliflower, which required time adjustments. For frozen cauliflower, steam for 3-4 minutes until just tender but not fully thawed, and per recipe instructions mix with olive oil and garlic (I didn't have parsley so I didn't use it) and put in oven on 450 degrees. Cook time will be less than if you'd used raw cauliflower; I did 10 minutes before adding my parmesan, and left it for 3-4 more minutes. It was perfect - and tasted amazing! Great, quick way to make a tasty and healthy side dish.

I have never roasted cauliflower so this was new territory for me. BUT - oh my goodness, it was amazing and I will never boil it again! I made it as written and believe me, it was the ONLY dish at Thanksgiving which was completely GONE. Seriously. It was incredible. Watch it and stir it so it doesn't burn, though.

Didn't have any  parmesan cheese so after roasting it I added some shredded cheddar cheese on top.  A little more on the unhealthy side but still good

This was great!  I did 400 uncovered.  If you cover the dish, be aware that you are steaming the cauliflower rather than roasting it, which will change the flavor.

I am not a cauliflower person, but this is good!
I read comments before I made this, and I separated the Cauliflower and put in my casserole dish, mixed everything together (except the cheese) and poured it over the cauliflower  in the casserole dish, stirring to make sure it is evenly coated. I didn't need to grease the pan by doing it  this way. I didn't add the bread crumbs until halfway thru the baking time, this worked out great, the flavors from all the ingredients blended in well before adding the breadcrumbs.

This was really yummy. I added one more TBS of olive oil and just tossed it in a mixing bowl with the garlic because I prefer not to use baggies unless totally necessary.   Also I would not cover this when baking unless you prefer it on the softer/musher side (blah!). I then topped it with shredded Parmesan cheese instead of grated for the broiling.   My husband and 5 year old loved it too!   I will definitely make this again.

Followed the recipe but used a baking sheet instead. It's easier to watch, there's no need to cover and thus the cauliflower is not steamed but truly roasted. Whenever I make it there aren't any leftovers.

Really enjoyed this recipe! 
I did make a few tweaks based on some other reviews I read. I cooked it at 400 instead of 450, and covered it for about 10 minutes, I then uncovered it, added the Parmesan and some breadcrumbs and broiled it for another 10 minutes.
I also did not have parsley so I used dried basil and chives.
Over all this turned out really well, the cauliflower was still crisp which I enjoyed. My brother who doesn't normally like cauliflower loved it, he said it was like "cauliflower alfredo" (minus the cream).

VERY DELICIOUS RECIPE!  Added 1 crown of broccoli.  Omitted parmesan.  Used 1 tsp. sea salt & 1/2 tsp. coarse ground black pepper.  Baked at 425 on a cookie sheet sprayed with cooking oil for 20 minutes.  Sprinkled with dried parsley and baked another 5 minutes, and it was perfect!  No need to broil; it browned on bake.  Note:  I used 8 cloves of fresh minced garlic to get a measurement of 2 tbsp.

I've  this dozens of times and every time it turns out perfect. It's easy to adjust ingredients depending on what you're looking for. To make it healthier, you don't need all the oil or cheese. This recipe works just as well with lower amounts.

This is a super easy recipe. Be sure the cauliflower is cut into small florets or you'll need a longer cook time. I also found more olive oil was needed to fully coat the ingredients. This is good, though,  & I will definitely try it again.  Please keep in mind that the recipe may need minor modification to suit your taste.  I will make it again, though.

Great way to cook cauliflower!  I left off the parmesan cheese to save calories.  Didn't miss it!  I cooked it for only 18 minutes.  I skipped the broil too because of having skipped the cheese.  I like my veggies with a little firmness.

I love this recipe.  I make it without the Parmesan cheese (have you ever smelled that stuff) and it comes out great each time.  It is the only way to make Califlower.

Yummy way to make cauliflower.  I took it to my daughter's house and my son-in-law, grandkids and all loved it.  There were no leftovers.  To prepare a dish like this I always put it in a bowl to mix instead of a bag; that way a rubber spatula gets all the garlic and oil onto the cauliflower.  Thanks Shellery.

This was delicious. I prepared the same way but wrapped in foil and grilled in the top of the grill for about 30 minutes.  I also added sliced green onion. I opened the foil for the last 5 minutes and sprinkled with Parmesan. Great for clean up and could watch my chicken at the same time.  Next time I think I will add a few new potatoes to the cauliflower mix.

It was too much garlic!  The idea of roasting the garlic with olive oil and garlic and putting on cheese and parsley at the end is great.

I tried this last night and it was delicious.  I'm not a big fan of vegetables, but in my effort to eat more healthy I thought I would try this recipe.  I forgot the broiling part but it didn't seem to make a difference. The cauliflower tasted even better the next day as leftovers.  I paired this with the Lemon Garlic Tilapia by Eireann and found the flavors worked very well together.

Between greasing the pan (even though I lightly sprayed it), the olive oil, and the cheese, I thought it was way too oily. It was fine though, just basic veggies with cheese.

2014: Loved it!!! This is how I am eating cauliflower from now on!!! Easy, quick side dish that has a ton of flavors.
2016: Amazing!! Cooked this with the lid on at 450 degrees for 10 minutes longer than directed. Then I grated Parmesan cheese over top. Hubby and kids (4 & 3) raved about it. Every last piece of cauliflower was eaten. 5+++ stars

A bit bland, but liked the consistency. Will try again, but maybe with some spiced added. We did enjoy it cold the next day with some Italian dressing, as suggested by another reviewer.

Yummy.  The only thing I would do differently would be to cut the baking time by 2 minutes so it can be a little more crispy.

I will make this again, but I will reduce the cooking time. I like my veggies with a little more crunch - al dente? Excellent idea though. Broccoli would take much less time too.

I absolutely love this recipe and have shared it with so many people! If we don't finish this at dinner, I toss the leftover florets into my soup or salad the next day.  I have even eaten it right out of the fridge as a snack.

This was so good that my husband, who does not eat vegetables, ate two helpings. I didn't even add the cheese and it was still extremely good.

This is the tastiest and healthiest way I've found to prepare cauliflower. The Parmesan and roasting gave it lots of flavor. And, bonus... it's easy!  I didn't have quite enough garlic to get 2 tablespoons and it was still great.

This was absolutely delicious. Used 2 heads of fresh cauliflower and a baking sheet. I baked them for a little longer (man, is it hard to cut uniform pieces of cauliflower). Broiling them for a few minutes made all the difference!  I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe : )

Love this recipe. I make it all the time, but leave out the parmesan cheese since I'm dairy intolerant. I very seldom have fresh parsley so use dried.

This is my absolute favorite recipe. I don't bother greasing the pan anymore, just a little healthier if you eat it ALL the time like I do. I love to use Saputo's parmesan petals (shaved parmesan)the best. Thank you for this recipe.

This was very good. I would make this again. Definitely the best way to cook cauliflower that I have found so far, but wasn't the "wow" that is needed for me to give it five stars.

This had such great reviews, I couldn't wait make it for my family. I followed the directions exactly but my husband was the only one who ate it. It didn't have much flavor and still seemed raw. I may try again using the suggestions of other reviewers but my kids just want me to go back to my normal way of steaming it.

THis was yummy, and I gave it the benefit of the doubt with 5 stars - but I would take half a star off because I think the instructions could have been a bit clearer. It says to put this in a large baking dish, and I used a 2 quart casserole dish - but I think it should have recommended a 9x13 pan so the cauliflower was basically in a single layer (I looked at the video after the fact and that is what they used). It browns up more evenly that way. Also, whenever I try to roast vegetables with minced garlic, my garlic always burns. This may be due to the fact that I usually go a little light on the oil, maybe it needs all that oil to keep it moist?
Anyway, this was very good and easy to throw together on a weeknight. What more do you need?

Love this recipe, my kids hated cauliflower! NOT ANY MORE! roasting it gives it a great sweet flavor, every time I make it they gobble it up. I usually skip the parmisan and parley, I just dabble a little bit of olive oil some fresh garlic, a little salt and pepper and it comes out just as good. I also make it fun for the kids and buy different color cauliflower , I mix white, orange and purple cauliflower. It gives whatever dish I cook great contrast of color.

I followed the recipe, but it turned out dry and not very flavourful. It may have been better if I had checked the reviews first and tried the suggestion to reduce heat and cover. Probably won't bother trying again though.

Easy and delicious.  I had only ever had steamed cauliflower before and it was okay.  This I couldn't stop eating, and I ended up making it twice in one week.

Unlike other reviewers I did not cover the pan as I was going for a more roasted vs steamed texture, but I did use a high sided ceramic casserole dish and I think this helped it somewhat from burning. My only change from the recipe was that I used about one cup of freshly grated parmesan, I had only dried parsley so I used about two tablespoons of this, and I added about half a teaspoon of Tony Chachere's instead of the regular salt to give it a little spice. It was fantastic! Even my kids ate it. I had prepped it for my husband to put in the oven, and when I came back home I could not believe how good it smelled, too. No stinky steamed cauliflower smell here! Super easy and my new favorite recipe for cauliflower.

Easy and tastes great!   We don't even add the Parmesan...just johnny's seasoning and pepper, garlic and oil.  Don't worry if parts get "black" just stir...it's like eating candy!!

I loved this recipe! Super easy, cheap, and delicious! Makes a great side dish. My tweaks to the recipe: add some herb de provence midway through the cooking process and use plain goat cheese instead of Parmesan. Amazing!

This was so simple and very good.  The only thing I did different was that I added a small onion to it.  I also added Oregeno and Itialian Seasoning to it.  This is a keeper for sure!!!

Husband said that he had never(ever!) eaten cauliflower before this & he loved this recipe!  I used a little extra (1/2C) grated parmesean cheese & wouldn't hesitate to double the recipe next time & use more cheese again (this fed 2 adults & 2 picky kids that ate a little of it for us.)

Easy, delicious, and healthy!  I didn't use quite as much olive oil, mostly because  ran out!  I recommend following directions and using a casserole dish instead of a deep cookie sheet (which I used to do).  It's much easier to stir in a casserole dish.

Also, I didn't put mine in the broiler.  I just threw some foil on top, left it in the oven,and turned off the over.  The cheese and parsley got all melty while I finished preparing the rest of dinner.

It was good leftover too!  I snacked on a few cold pieces this morning.  Nom nom!

I only give it three stars because I tweaked it a bit.  I roasted it uncovered for the first 15 minutes, then tossed in fresh spinach and covered for the next 10 minutes.  I then stirred in the Parmesan cheese and roasted for another 10 minutes covered.  Wow!  so good and the roasted garlic flavor was amazing!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Awesome.  Not a speck left from a huge head of cauliflower.  I did add about 3 tbsps of bread crumbs, as another reviewer suggested, and covered the dish loosely with foil for the first 20 minutes.  My husband said it was the best cauliflower he'd ever had, and only wants it cooked like this from now on.  :)

This is my favorite way to make cauliflower. It's so nutty and cheesy good! I don't add the fresh parsley because I never have any but I'm not sure it could possibly taste any better...

Better with Italian five cheese vice just parmesan.  Mix in a large bowl, less wasteful than using a plastic bag and easier to put on baking dish.

This is the BEST cauliflower I've ever eaten!!  I spread mine out on a foil-lined baking sheet and skipped the parsley (just because I didn't have any).  Served with grilled salmon and a creamy cucumber salad.  Delish!

Loved this!  I used 6 cloves of fresh diced garlic.  I followed other recommendations to bake at 400 for about 20 mins.  I loosely covered the pan with foil for the last 10 mins.  (I removed it before broiling at the end.).  Delish!

I'm not generally a big fan of cauliflower unless it's been mashed to mush. While this did not do much to improve the texture of cauliflower, it did add some fabulous flavor to an otherwise bland vegetable. I included some fresh basil and a pinch or two of oregano. My mother, who is even less a fan of cauliflower than I am, greatly enjoyed it; she even complimented me on it! 

"This cauliflower is delicious! How did you make it?"
"Why, thank you, I just threw some- Wait, what?!"

DO NOT overcook.  I accidentally left in just a few minutes longer than stated and it got VERY dry.  Maybe it just needs a tab more olive oil.

THE BEST!!..OMG this was so good..The perfect way to serve this vegetable which is so bland tasting to me.. I followed the instructions just like the video.. Except I added a little more twist on it. I did sprinkle some black pepper over the cauliflower with also a little more garlic powder..I then sprinkled dry Parmesan cheese over it, baked it for 20 minutes @ 450 degrees.. then I took it out sprinkled pieced of pepper jack over the florets put it in the over on broil.. when it melted I then sprinkled the diced parsley on it put it back in the broiler for 45seconds then it was ready to serve.

I tried this recipe for the first time about a week ago. It was super delicious! I ate it with some chicken breasts that I cooked. The only difference was I added about 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Made it sooo much better! Will be using this recipe frequently. Thank you

I am a deep fried cauliflower lover but tend to stay away from it due to it being far from healthy. This recipe is a great alternative. The longer you roast it and the deeper in color it gets the better it is IMO. Love it!

Good flavor and easy. I wish it would have been a little more creamy, but all and all a good fairly healthy side dish.

Delicious and quick but needed just a *teeny* bit more flavoring so I added lemon pepper and Tony Chachere creole seasoning prior to putting in the oven. Also I did not have a plastic bag big enough so I just put the cauliflower in the baking dish and then sprinkled on garlic, olive oil and seasonings and then tossed it all up in the pan. Very easy!

This was a success all the way around at my house, all 3 of my guys liked it very well. I made a few changes. Added 3 slices of bacon, which I cooked lightly and cut up. Used only 2T olive oil and 1T bacon grease, tossed oils with cauliflower in the dish I was baking it in, salted generously and put a little pepper on it, cooked at 425 for 15 minutes, then stirred and added the garlic (to keep it from burning per other reviews) and the bacon. Covered and cooked another 20 minutes, removed from oven, added the parmesan and recovered and let it sit on the stovetop while the rest of the meal finished cooking. The cauliflower was perfectly cooked with no crunch left, just the way we like it, and the flavor was awesome. Will make this again for sure!

It was delish!!! I did not cover it but turned it down to 425 and kept cauliflower pieces same size. I added extra garlic and put Johnny's Mediterranean seasoning with garlic and oil. (lower sodium than salt) Will make it again!!!

Myself, my husband and 2 of our 3 daughters, liked this, one daughter and son, not so much. However, it was different, could use some tweaking, less garlic & a few herbs. I put cauliflower in a jelly roll pan to roast. I'd make again. TY

I've been looking for a new way to make cauliflower. I used a package of the fresh (not frozen) broccoli and cauliflower. Following the directions exact, they turned out quite good! The next time I made them, I added a little extra olive oil after I put them in the pan, I thought they were a little dry the first time, and doubled the parmesan cheese, my 3-year old's "favorite cheese!"...they were DELICIOUS! Will be making these again in the near future!

This was definitely a very good recipe.  I chose not to grill it and just pan cooked it instead until it was golden brown.  I already had another meal cooking at a different temperature in the oven so I came up with an alternative.  It was very tasty though and I plan to make it again and place a more in-depth review on my blog (laurensconcepts.com).

I have made this recipe a few times, and it's a great way to add flavor and color to cauliflower. I added the Parmesan cheese and sprinkled on dried parsley (didn't have fresh on hand), but I didn't have to use the broiler after baking. The cauliflower was beautifully browned after the baking. I generally make a couple of heads on a large cookie sheet, and then freeze them in meal-sized portions. When I use them for a meal, I simply have to thaw and re-warm them in the microwave.

So good!! I didn't really notice the Parmesan cheese flavor. Maybe I didn't add enough. I kind of eyeballed it. But it was good without the cheesy flavor, so maybe it doesn't need it. Ironically, I was at a restaurant and they offered roasted cauliflower with truffle oil, and it was soooo good. If you have any, drizzle a little on top!!!

This was my first time roasting cauliflower and it was really delicious. I followed the recipe exactly but left out the parsley because I didn't have any, and I roasted it at 415 degrees instead of 450, which worked perfectly in my oven and I didn't have any problems with the garlic being burnt. Next time might try shredded parmesan insteady of grated. But overall it was delicious and the husband even really liked it.

I just tried this recipe tonight, and it was a hit with both my husband, who really couldn't be bothered with vegetables, and my one-year-old who, though not usually picky, has been turning down old favorites for the last week or so. It was easy to prepare and tasted delicious! I'll definitely be making this again.

I LOVE this!!   (could eat the whole head all by myself!)   I cook this at only 400 (covered with foil part of the time) as I don't like my cauliflower to get blackened.  Roasted Cauliflower is AWESOME!!

This was so good that I wanted to eat ALL of it! I'm not a huge fan of cauliflower, but it is good for you so I wanted to try roasting it. This is truly a wonderful way to eat it. Thank you for sharing Shellery, I will definitely be making this again!

great and simple way to enjoy cauliflower.  I've tried it twice with the cheese (and breadcrumbs) and after last night, fiance and I agree: its would be just as tasty without the cheese... we like simply seasoned veggies so salt and pepper is delicious enough for us.

Best recipe ever! I used dill instead of parsley simply because this was what I had in the fridge. It turned out amazing!

Made this for my husband and son. None of us thought we liked cauliflower, but I thought this sounded pretty good. It wasn't good, it was AWESOME! Finally, I have another great white/yellow side dish as a go-to.

This is the best cauliflower I have ever had.  It wasn't mushy and had just the right amount of crunch.  Yum, yum, yum!

This is fantastic!  I did not use the bag, just mixed in 9x13 and used garlic Olive Oil along with the garlic.  Did not cover and did not do the broil just put back in for five after putting on the cheese and parsley.  I am going to make this alot and try other vegetables.

Wonderful! I add a bit of curry powder while I'm shaking the cauliflower with the oil - it turns out delicious every time. Make sure you leave it uncovered for most of the cooking time if you like it to be firm instead of soggy.

I give this 5 stars without actually knowing . . . I made this because I normally don't like cauliflower, but we had a head of it from our CSA, and I thought I might find a way I like to eat it. I had to take my daughter to girl scouts, and told my husband to go ahead and eat some of it meanwhile. When I got home, it was gone. I didn't even get to taste it. So my review is based on his reaction. I didn't use a plastic bag - I don't like plastic or wasting plastic bags this way, so I just mixed in a bowl. I could have just mixed it in the pan and not had to wash a bowl. Also, I used a larger glass dish to bake it in rather than a casserole, so I could spread it out to avoid burning as others suggested. I didn't change the recipe (except I didn't have any parsley) and I didn't cover it, but I always bake for less than recommended time because our oven seems to run hot. This was very easy to make and clean up. Now if I had only gotten to try it!

My daughter who has never liked cauliflower asked for more, and my wife told me the next evening that she was craving it at work.  A great way to turn what to me is a very bland vegetable into a family favorite.  Next time I'm going to double the recipe.

I ate half of this before it got to the table.  I have to admit the kids didn't like it, but they've never cared for cauliflower.  That's ok, though; more for my husband and me!  Yum!

1 tablespoon of parsley did not seem like enough; I added a small handful which was the perfect amount. We ate the leftovers the next night in spaghetti sauce over pasta, yumm.

Excellent all the way around!  I made this for my family and they loved it!  Even my daughter who normally doesn't like cauliflower loved it.  I usually just boil or steam the cauliflower so this was definetly something different for us and I will certainly make it again.

Usually dont like cheese but this was very good! Be generous with the salt but not too generous, a little more cheese would be good too! Other than that it was super good!

The whole family loved this.  Definitely takes the full 30+ minutes to cook.  I had to use dried parsley with the oil mixture since I didn't have any fresh.  Excellent.

I have been making roasted cauliflower for ages.  On a lark, I tried this recipe.  Fantastic.  Truly the best cauliflower I've ever eaten.   I think next time I will cut the garlic by 25%, but that's just because we like our garlic flavor to be subtle.   I think the Parmesan cheese makes this recipe, although we used less because we are watching our cheese intake.

I can't agree with the others. I like cauliflower  just fine but this isn't worth the time. I'll revert to my old stand-by & micro-steam it, drain & add bunches of butter. Yum!!

These were so delicious! I made a whole cauliflower and I think I ended up eating half of it myself. Even my 5 and picky 7 year old enjoyed it.

WOW. I hate cauliflower...or did until just now! My changes were: coarse grey sea salt, freshly minced garlic, covered with foil and baked for 20min, then broiled on high for 5min. 
I am giving 5 stars because it is so easy and could be versatile (balsamic vinegar comes to mind) if one chose.
I served with curried brown rice and Parmesan broiled squash slices. Thank you!

Excellent! I did what others suggested. I cut the cauliflower as uniformly as possible, mixed it all up in a bowl, instead of a baggie and and covered the cauliflower for almost the entire cooking period. I didn't measure my salt, pepper or garlic, but my whole house smelled yummy garlicky. This is a super easy, very tasty recipe.

I grew some cauliflower in the garden this year and  didn't know how to cook it.  I found this recipe and tried it.  I actually roasted it for 35 minutes but mixed it up twice and it came out really delicious.  Easy side dish with a lot of flavor for so little ingredients.

I made this tonight and it was delicious.  I followed the recipe but substituted the fresh parsley for fresh rosemary as I had it on hand.  My husband told me this was the first time he has ever liked cauliflower!  My preschooler and 12 month old loved it too!  Hooray!

Excellent! I never thought I would Crave cauliflower but this is memorable. I didn't use any parmesean only because I forgot it and instead of salt & pepper used cavenders seasoning. I roasted this uncovered on a large jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper and do not cover it.

Great easy dish with lots of flavor. Will definitely make it again!  I added a bit more garlic. Used a casserole dish with a top on it so I put all ingredients in it and shook it up, no need for a plastic bag.

Wow easy and almost healthy.  This is a simple and yummy recipe to prepare cauliflower.  Nice alternative to a heavy casserole mixed with creams and soups.  Per service price is basically nothing.  How can you go wrong with garlic and parmesan?  Make it once and remember it forever.

Fantastic! The best cauliflower I've ever had. We added onion powder and bread crumbs per some of the other comments. I will definitely be making this again!

The cauliflower turns out absolutely delicious.  I have used many recipes from this site, but this is the first time I felt compelled to share with others how impressed I was with the recipe.  I can't wait to cook it for others.  Thanks much.

Delicious! I followed the directions as they were written but added powdered onion and cooked it in a covered casserole dish and then put it uncovered under the broiler on low.  The cauliflower was tender and tasty.  There were no leftovers which is always a plus!  I will definitely be making this again!

My husband hasn't been a fan of cauliflower in any of it's previously presented forms.  So when we ended up with a cauliflower I knew I needed to come up with a unique presentation if there was any hope of it being a success.  This recipe fit the bill precisely!  It was super easy to prepare and my husband now thinks he likes cauliflower!  We will definitely be making this dish many more times in the future :)

The garlic overpowered the taste of the cauliflower.  I like the fresh taste of cauliflower and I love garlic but I felt like it was a waste of a good head of cauliflower.

Loved this! Would agree with covering a little to help with steaming. Added a few red pepper flakes and breadcrumbs. Loved it! Even my husband who doesn't really like cauliflower asked for seconds.

Just tried this for the first time last night.  It was pretty good!  I stirred the Cauliflower every few minutes, so it wouldn't get dry.  I also cooked it for an extra five minutes because I didn't want it to be cruchy.   The next time I make it, I will stir in extra Parmasean cheese at the end, as well as add it to the top, before broiling.

Very awesome! I tried this recipe literally 15 minutes ago. I loved it so much that I wanted to post my review right away! Thank you so much for this yummy recipe. 
I followed it to the tee but I added just a splash of left over white wine from last night. It just added that little extra something and this is so amazing!

Delicious!  450 was just too high a temp, garlic started to burn.  I lowered the oven to 350 and cooked it for 40 minutes.  Would have given it 5 stars if the temp worked.

The garlic and parmesan cheese provided a nice balance of flavors for the cauliflower. It was pretty good, and my parents thought it was okay. However, they are more used to more flavorful foods so this wasn't a favorite with them.

This was extremely easy and extremely tasty.  We don't even normally like cauliflower but Dr. Oz said we should eat more cruciferous vegetables, so I bought some. I didn't really measure anything, just guesstimated.  I had no parsley.  We will be making this regularly.

Good, but when you put it in the oven with the cheese it tends to burn the cheese.. I would suggest adding it at the last minute before your ready to pull them out.

Ok, so I love raw cauliflower and have never been a huge fan of any cooked version. This is better then most, but not anything spectacular. I was hoping for a lot of flavor and was disappointed. This is good but not great. I followed the recipe exactly. My husband said it was 'good'. Next time I will add some garlic powder, a little seasoning salt and a dash of red chile flakes. Johnny's makes a good parmesan garlic seasoning that would probably taste really good on this. On a whole it was very easy and something I will try again- with some variations.

I ran out of gallon baggies, so I tossed cauliflower in bowl with garlic and olive oil.  Otherwise, prepared as directed.  This recipe is wonderful!  I am sure I can play with the ingredients when I make again, but it is 5-star as is.  Thank you for a new way to prepare cauliflower!

Like so many others, I have never liked cauliflower. I got a bunch through my local food co-op and decided to try this recipe so it didn't go to waste. To my surprise, it was delicious! I buy cauliflower just to make this recipe now.

YUMMM!!! I just tossed the ingredients together in a bowl instead of a bag and roasted at 400. 450 would have burned it too much.

Best cauliflower I’ve ever had! & I NEVER buy cauliflower!  Had a friend give me one. You can depend on ALLRecipes.com to supply an assortment & tasty ways to prepare such a lovely dish as this!  (I Love using the INGREDIENTS tool to "salvage" whatever you have on hand in your fridge) Like someone mentioned: "This is now my favorite way to prepare cauliflower" AND-->  "Add as much garlic as you like! Roast cauliflower only just 'til slightly soft. Don't overcook"  The one thing I did differently (I like to prep ahead) was to marinade all, all afternoon: same ingredients...just extra EVO & added oregano as well, to zip bag.  Thought this was a marvelous dish. Added Xtra cheese...did not broil, just let sit in oven for 10 mins. Even after dinner was over, couldn't resist the urge to pick the crusty Parmesan bits...soooo good w/ the cauliflower! :)  yum!! I've done a 180 on cauliflower- This recipe is Keeper!

Absolutely the best cauliflower I've ever had! I now make it at least once a week. To switch it up, I used cheddar cheese one night and it was delicious, as well.

Mmmmm. This was SO good! I have been craving cauliflower lately. Not sure why, but after tasting this, I am glad I have. :) To speed prep, I purchased a small bag of cauliflower florets. I proceeded as directed, but instead of roasting at 450 degrees, I roasted (on a shallow cookie sheet) at 400 degrees for 25 minutes. My only suggested change (for next time!) would be to decrease the amount of Parmesan cheese called for... there was too much of it for my taste. I'm also not sure I'd use the parsley either (it didn't add any oomph, IMHO). Other than these two very minor changes, this recipe is perfect as is. I have now found a new way to enjoy one of my favorite veggies! Thanks SHELLERY. :-)

It's such a great alternative to asparagus and broccoli, which are so easy to just pop in the steamer...  I take the olive oil down to 2 tablespoons and have used other cheeses as well - shredded cheddar works well, as do mexican blend cheeses.

OUTSTANDING.  I've made this once a week since finding it.  I've made with Parmesan and without.  Either way - fantastic.  I spread mine on a cookie sheet and bake at 450 degress for about 20 minutes.  Served with Spicy Grilled Shrimp (from this site) and you have a great, light, dinner!

This is really a delicious recipe.  I love cauliflower but basically had only 2 ways to fix it.  I love that it also doesn't get mushy and still has bite to it.  I had it with steamed rice and the Greek chicken from this website and it was a great meal.

This deserves more than 5 stars. This combanation really goes well together. I added more garlic than called for, we are garlic lovers,.  The next time I will steam the cauliflower a little. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is pretty tasty!  I'm always looking for new ways to make vegetables and this is definitely a keeper. I did a couple of things differently.  When I put it in the oven, for the first half, I had a lid on my casserole dish. I also didn't broil this, I just turned the oven to 500 for 3-5 minutes and it was perfect!

This was fabulous!  I pretty much followed the recipe but I didn't have fresh parsely on hand, so I used 1 tsp. dried parsley and it came out amazing!  I will definitely be making this again, especially since everyone in my house ate it up!

Honestly, I was disappointed with this recipe...especially based on all of the reviews. I followed the recipe except for adding some paprika, onion powder, and some extra garlic. Not too crazy, right?! The result, however, was that the result was too dry and crunchy. I am not sure if that is the intended result, but I don't care for my vegetables to be al dente. I will try this again because I believe it has potential. However, next time I will steam it first briefly for 10 minutes, add some melted butter, then place it in the oven for about 20-25 minutes. We'll see what happens...

even the non cauliflower fan hubby liked this. Nice thing is that it is a cauliflower recipe with no cheese sauce! I did add a bit more oilve oil since it looked a little dry on a large head of CF.....came out great.

I tossed in some parsley and rosemary, and omitted the Parmesan (I didn't have any on hand). Because I didn't have any tin foil handy, I baked in an 8x8 uncovered for about 30 minutes, and the firmness of the cauliflower was just about perfect. Already since I made this for the first time four nights ago, I've made it again twice. It was delicious with couscous.

I don't like cauliflower very much but I loved it prepared this way.  The garlic is wonderful with it.  Only change was that I didn't have fresh parsley.

I have a great 'vegetable rub' from Harry and David that I love and it was perfect with this dish.  I used it instead of parsley, salt, and pepper and it was sooooo good.  Kids ate almost all of it by themselves...

This was so easy and very flavorful!  Delicious and will make again!!  I used fresh garlic instead of from a jar and what a difference!

Yum!  My mom always made deep fried parmesan when I was growing up, and as much as I love it, I just can't swallow those calories.  This is not the same, but has a similar enough taste that it satisfies that craving, thank you!

usually i really like roasted veggies, but this wasn't appealing at all to me.  I did cover it with foil per suggestions and I did not use fresh parsley.  Maybe something there made a difference. I will say, that it tasted better to me the next day reheated in the microwave. I don't thing I would make this again.

It was ok, but I have liked other methods of cooking cauliflower better. I think my biggest worry was the texture, which was firmer than I've eaten cauliflower before. I left it in longer, and it wasn't softening. That's just a taste issue. Garlic flavor wasn't overwhelming at all.

I enjoyed this, though DH said it had too much garlic.  I cooked the cauliflower at the temp and time specified in the recipe, and it was cooked to perfection (though if you like your vegetables crisp-tender, I'd take it out sooner).

After reading all the positive reviews I couldn't wait to make this recipe. Sorry to say, no one liked it. I followed the recipe exactly and the cauliflower came out very dry and somewhat bland. My daughter tried dipping it in blue cheese dressing and said it made it a little better.

This is good but can be improved.  I found it to be too greasy, so next time I will just toss the cauliflower with water instead of oil and bake it covered at 400F for 20 minutes.  I removed teh foil, topped it with mozzarella, and broiled it for 5 minutes uncovered.  I skipped the parsley because I don't care for it.

I began by making this recipe as stated, except that I covered it to keep the garlic from burning. For our tastes, it was very bland. I ended up adding more garlic and cheddar cheese and sticking it back under the broiler, after which we thought it was awesome! Good base recipe, just needed a few adjustments for us.

I was excited to try the recipe- since there were so many reviews for it, and it looked so simple! I found that the recipe was just so-so, it filled the house w/ a great garlic aroma however- and I thought that it was going to be really tasty, but found that it was missing something.  I added shredded parmesan on top of the grated parmesan and it still wasn't doing it for me.  I think it's good for a basic recipe for cauliflower, but not great.

I tried baking this at 400 for 20 minutes, then broiling for 4 minutes.  I used 1/4 cup Parmesan & 1/4 cup breadcrumbs.  We did not like this.  The cauliflower was still crunchy, and it just seemed to be missing something.

I placed the oil and garlic in the baking dish, added the cauliflower to it and stirred it up a few times before baking.  I will cover it next time and leave it a shorter length of time, 20 min. should do it.  I will try adding some onions and cheese also.  Great starter recipe.

I made this recipe pretty much as recommended. I have never really liked vegetables and picked this recipe as my first introduction to cauliflower. Not only did i like it, but i found myself enjoying the leftovers the next day. A very good recipe that made a cauliflower lover out of a previous cauliflower hater.

This was sooo yummy.  Per other reviews, I doubled the sauce and the cheese (though I won't double the cheese next time).  It was so delicious and my 3-year-old ate nearly half of it.  I call that success.

This is good, but not as great as I expected based on the reviews. I usually steam cauliflower whole in the microwave, top with a bread crumb/garlic powder/butter mixture and broil for a two minutes. I wanted to try a different method and had high hopes for this recipe, but it just didn't wow me.

Great recipe! I use other veggies in this recipe too.  I learned my lesson the first time around and from now on make sure that I cover it with tin foil to prevent burning.  Now, I uncover it when it's time to put the cheese and parsley over.

I enjoyed the roasted cauliflower, but the directions did not work well for me. Before the cauliflower was cooked through, the garlic was burnt. Maybe it would work better to roast whole cloves or a head of garlic and combine them with the cauliflower after it is cooked.

My friend gave me a whole cauliflower and I wasn't sure what to do with it. Well this came out great especially for " cauliflower" and healthy. Pretty simple and easy to make. I did place the ingredients in a bowl instead of a bag but the cauliflower didn't get completly covered. Next time, I will try the bag and see what happens.

Eating healthy tastes great!! This cauliflower was delicious! The garlic and parm. compliment the cauliflower tremendously. Made this as a side dish numerous times. Hubby loved it which is saying something since he hated cauliflower the old boring way I used to make it. Picky 5 yr old loved it too!  ;0)

This recipe was decent. I love how the texture came out after following others' advice to cover the dish with foil and cook at 400 degrees, but salt to taste to me usually means just a bit of salt and I had to add a lot. Admittedly, I use kosher salt, so maybe I needed more in the first place, but after much salt adjusting plus added garlic salt and cayenne, then it was good, but not great. I will try this again. My advice is to taste this a couple times before serving, and you'll be good to go. Thanks for the recipe.

I combined this recipe with a rosemary cauliflower recipe and swapped broccoli for cauliflower. I think it will be terrific with the cauliflower as written, but it was very nice with the broccoli and rosemary and a slightly shorter baking time. Hubby raved and definitely wants it again. Served with grated parmesan on top rather than broiling/melting.  OK, looking at this, I'm rating the variations rather than the original--but I believe the original is solid and can take it. :)

I was lazy and found this worked great tossed in a bowl with garlic powder, dried basil and the olive oil! Did need to add salt and pepper however, as it is too bland for my taste.

This recipe was very good but slightly bland for me. I eat a lot of Indian food and made the following changes. After baking the cauliflower, I added 1 teaspoon of Corriander Cumin Powder, 1/2 teaspoon of Garam Masala (used in most Indian dishes), 1/3 teaspoon Degi Mirch ( hot red chilli powder) and 1/3 teaspoon of Turmeric. (All these spices are easily available at all Indian stores- MTR brand and you can add more/less to your taste). Toss till the spices are evenly spread, ganish with fresh corriander leaves and serve over steamed rice. I even added 3 medium sized potatoes chopped in the same dish with the cauliflower. Tasted like restuarant style Aloo Gobi (Cauliflower with potatoes).

I really liked this--something different from the regular steaming.  I thought there was plenty of garlic!  I may try cutting back the garlic and adding some shredded cheddar to get the kids to eat it better next time.

I made this for dinner for people who dont really like cauliflower (I love it).  They said that the cauliflower was good, and they would eat it again.  I found it good, but not a fantastic tasting recipe.

I like this better than steamed cauliflower.  The garlic flavor was strong, but I really liked it.  If you don't love garlic you may want to reduce it a bit.

We used colored cauliflower, from the local farmers...green, orange, purple and white. I did blanch it first. But the clean up was easy. I just sprayed the baking dish with cooking spray! It is now our staple winter vegetables, and an elegant dish to serve guests for Christmas dinner!

This was fantastic!  I didn't even have fresh garlic, so I used powdered, and it was still great.  I can't wait to see how good it is with the real stuff.  I baked it covered, and then uncovered it for the broiling.

Nice to find another way to cook cauliflower w/o sauces or just steaming.  Recommend uniform florets & will cover w/ foil next time.

I have never been a big fan of cauliflower but with this recipe is the best, I love it! Cauliflower normally is very bland but this recipe actually gives it a great flavor. This is the BEST recipe yet!  I am always looking for recipes to enhance the flavor of vegetables and this one really does it!!!!!

Very good recipe.  We love roasted cauliflower and the Parmesan was a nice addition.  I did add about 1/4 c. drained, rinsed capers the last 10 minutes which added a little tartness, and used coarse salt.  Fresh grated lemon peel is also good when added with the olive oil and garlic.  We like the cauliflower a little crispy so next time I think I'll do it on a large cookie sheet.  Thanks for an easy good recipe.

Wow... a great recipe and a nice change. By mistake I mixed the Parmesan cheese in but it turned out great. Will try adding on top next time as I'm sure that will be really good as well. I didn't mix in a bag but instead just mixed in the casserole dish I was baking it in anyway. Less clean up for me. Yummy!

Cauliflower is on sale right now so I've been looking for different ways to make it. This is very good. I added broccolli to it because my daughter loves it. I'll make this again for sure.

It was OK. I followed other's advice & covered with foil for the first half of the cooking. But the overall result was still the same. Even with uniform florets, my cauliflower was burnt in places. It was dried & was lacking flavor, except for the garlic.

Yum!  I am writing for two families, because I tried it and it was delicious, and more importantly my kids ate it and my husband said "this cauliflower actually has flavor!"  It did not take as long to bake as the recipe called for. I baked it for only 20 minutes before putting the cheese on top. Then, I told my friend about it, and she made it and said her young children ate a ton too, and it was definitely easy and yummy.  Highly recommended, and not that much more trouble that the basic steaming method - but the results are 1000% better!

We found this just okay.  It wasn't fantastic but neither was it really bad.  My garlic started to burn half way through so I covered the dish. After 30mins in the oven the cauliflower was still too crunchy for out tastes. The parsley and the parmesan saved this for us.  Would maybe make again but I'd par boil the cauliflower first and cover the dish for the entire cooking time then uncovered while broiling to brown and crisp.

I'm sorry but this didn't work as I expected.  Some of the cauliflower was perfect others too crunchy.  We like the flavor though.  I wished this had worked out better.

In my oven the temp or the time to cook was too long.  I will continue to tweak this to get it the way I want it.  I shook it all together in a bag and threw it on a parchment covered baking sheet. Was just a little to done for our taste.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this tonight for husband and friend.  We were all pleasantly surprised and agreed it was the best cauliflower we've ever eaten that wasn't smothered in cheese sauce.  We didn't have parmesan cheese....might be even 5 stars with the added cheese.

Added some flavored bread crumbs to the parmesan cheese and parsley. Did not cover and baked at 375 degrees in the oven along with my main dish for about 40 minutes.
Was a great side dish. Family loved it!

This was good, it didn't cover the cauliflower taste which I liked but it seemed like it was missing something for me. I'll use this recipe again but just keep trying out little additions until it feels completed for my palette.

YUMMY!  This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I didn't even add the cheese, just lots of garlic.  I've made this so many times and it's hard not to eat the entire pan in one sitting.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

My husband and I disagreed on this. He LOVED it and would give it a 4 and ate the entire head of cauliflower and I did not like it and would give it a 2 and so happily shared pieces that were on my plate with him. He made the recipe according to the instructions.

Usually cauliflower is boring to me, but this recipe gave it just the right amount of flavor to perk it up.  The only change I made was to just toss the cauliflower in the mixture in a bowl rather than going through the resealable bag route.  Quicker and easier. Received lots of compliments.  Thanks!

My husband can be picky about vegetables (with meat he has no problems!) and he really liked this! I served it with peas, hamburger patties and brown gravy, and he made very certain that he got the leftovers packed for lunch.  Delicious recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, before reading the other reviews.  The garlic cooked faster than the cauliflower making it bitter.  I think I'll try it again, blanching the cauliflower first, maybe mixing in broccoli, and adding the garlic towards the end.  Even with the slight bitter taste, the recipe was tasty.  I'm looking forward to trying it again.  I did use purple broccoli which made the kids want to try it!

I'm not a big fan of cauliflower, only with the nice thicky and cheesy sauce on top.  BUT this was a nice light change.  I didn't do anything different.  Will definately make again.  Cheese sauce is still our favourite topping for this vegetable.

This was absolutely wonderful. My grandma is a very finicky eater with a very small appetite. She (and everyone else) couldn't stop eating it. I actually made it with the "Grilled Lemon Chicken" and the "Blueberry Salad" also listed on this site, and it was a lovely meal. I did the recipe to the "T", but because my grandma has difficulty chewing I had to up the cook time to about 35 minutes. It became soft and very buttery. Will definitely make again!

We've never been much of a cauliflower eating family, but this recipe might just change that. It's fabulous! I used frozen cauliflower which I defrosted in the microwave. Be careful not to over bake.

Simple, tasty recipe. I make it exactly as written. I gave it 4 stars simply because the garlic seemed to me to overpower the cauliflower.  My kids all liked it, though, so we will definitely be using this recipe again.

This is almost identical to the cauliflower served by my favorite middle eastern cafeteria in Houston.  I've cooked this twice and love it, and so does my husband who said that's the only cauliflower he's ever liked.  I didn't cover it as some said to do - but let it brown before adding the parmesan which really adds to the flavor.

This was good, but I think I will blanch the cauliflower first before I bake it. It will cut down on the baking time and make the cauliflower a bit more tender.

Pretty good. I made this as I had to use up some cauliflower. I would not necessarily purchase cauliflower for the sole purpose of this recipe. But a good idea, to roast it with garlic.

i thought this recipe was good, but my husband and two kids didn't like it at all. (hence the low rating) I think my kids would have liked it with melted cheddar on top so I'll try that next time with no garlic.  sorry. . .

Very delicious. When I made it I added a bit more garlic and I sprinkled about a teaspoon of Spike all purpose seasoning. Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly! I will be making this regularly.

Very yummy and easy to make.  Next time I'll increase the Parmesan because my family loves it.  I baked it alongside baked potatoes for two easy side dishes.

Really good.  I followed the recipe except skipped the plastic bag part (just mixed together in the pan) and did not broil at the end.  Just sprinkled with grated cheese and baked for five more minutes.  So Good!

This is the best way to prepare cauliflower - fresh or frozen.  I skipped greasing the pan first, and also putting the ingredients in a bag.  I just placed the cauliflower in the pan and drizzled the oil and garlic over top and stirred to coat.  I covered and baked for 20 min, then did the broiling step.  I also added two strips of bacon, cooked and crumbled with the cheese.  Thank you for this recipe!

I really loved this recipe, however my husband said it was okay.  It was a great alternative to a cheese sauce.  I will definitely make it again. I followed a few suggestions and covered the dish and cooked it at 400 so it wouldn't burn, and it turned out great.

I loved this recipe.  The only thing that I did differently is add a dash of Mrs. Dash and seasoning salt.  Made it a little more flavorful.  Otherwise, an excellent combo of ingredients!

This was very good!  I added panko bread crumbs and it tasted a lot like the fried cauliflower.  The only problem was some of the garlic burnt, and it did take longer to cook than stated.  I guess it depends on how big your cauliflower pieces are.  Will make again!

This was very good and a great change to the "usual" vegetables that get made at our house.  You can roast them quite a bit more even than it says for an amazing flavor.

Very easy, tasty new way for my children to eat cauliflower!  I had some roasted garlic butter, so I used that in place of oil and minced garlic.  This is delicious!  Thanks Shellery.

So good and so easy.  All I did differently is that I added about a 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese instead of the amount the recipe stated.

Outstanding dish.  Everyone had seconds, including my 3 year old!  I used crushed garlic (as opposed to minced) and it adhered to the cauliflower wonderfully.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out pretty well.  We weren't quite as impressed by the end product as many reviewers, but it's probably the only decent cauliflower recipe I've found that doesn't incorporate a ton of cheese, so I'll definitely keep it around.

Mmmmmm.  I have tried roasting caulflower with parmesan before, and I didn't like it.  This recipe browns the cauliflower perfectly and actually brings out the sweetness in it, with the combination of the garlic and parmesan this will be my "had-too-many-calories-today-but-still-want-a-tasty-dinner" dish.

I really liked this recipe. I am surprised how I didnt think of it before. Garlic, olive oil and S/P ..so simple yet very delicious. I loved the garlic flavor with Cauliflower.I added some green beans to the cauliflower and boiled the two halfway and skipped the cheese on top. It was really good and healthy too.

I love this so much! I've been making this dish for a few years now, and it's still a hit with everyone I make it for. I always leave out the fresh parsley since I don't usually have it on hand, and I don't think it affects the dish at all. Purple and orange cauliflower makes this dish especially striking!

Very yummy!  I agree that you should cover the dish - otherwise it will burn!

This recipe was so easy to make and so tasty that it is a winner! I was very fortunate to ahve purchased a "mistery Box" of fresh from the farm veggies in San Francisco, and among the fresh produce, was a whole cauliflower.  I used the outer leaves with collards on a sourthern dishe, but the winner was the cauliflower with the roasted garlic! You have to be careful that the garlic does not burn since we have all experienced the nasty taste of overdone/burned garlic. The timing on this recipe is very crucial to get the right roasty taste of the garlics. Between my hubby and I we ate a whole cauliflower... and we are on a diet!  I figure, that without the olive oil (not much f=for the whole dish) and the grease (margerine) in preparing the baking pan, I would not have added more than a couple of Weightwatcher's points!  Plus I served it with brolied halibut (no fat added, only herbs) and a heirloom  tomatoes with basil (no oil added). A perfect recipe for those on a diet and those indulging on just good food without coutning points or calories! A delicious low fat content dish!! Thank you for sharing!

This was pretty tasty, but not what I was hoping for - too crunchy. I did use a mix of romano and parmesan cheese which made for a stronger flavor.  Baking longer would alleviate the crunchy factor, but I think it was still missing something.

Yum Yum! I cooked the cauliflower for 5 min in the microwave to speed up the cooking time. I added a sprinkle of Panko (Japanese style bread crumbs) and a small sprinkle of cheddar to the top to add a little pazazz. Husband loved it!

This was pretty good. Nothing spectacular but much better than steamed. Of course, I had to bake mine at 350 degrees and about 45 min. because of another dish I was cooking at the time.

Great recipe!!  My husband loved it, and he is not a cauliflower fan.  I also sliced up some red potatoes into wedges and tossed them in olive oil, salt, pepper and parlic and roasted them at the same time.  Both were great!

I had never roasted Cauliflower before and was suprised that it was tender without being over cooked.  The taste for this recipe didn't exactly thrill me.  I think I might prefer my cauliflower cooked the traditional way.  Steamed.

This just tasted ok to me and I love cauliflower.  Hubby said he liked it 'cause it's light.  Maybe I'll add more seasoning next time.

This was good, I used more garlic as I always do and followed the rest exactly.  It wasn't what I pictured in my mind for taste but that's not anyone's fault but mine and I did enjoy it. I don't think the rest of the family thought it was super as they didn't finish their helpings but it's nice for a change in preperation.

Really quite tasty.  I didn't add the garlic until the last five minutes as previous posters suggested.  I also mixed the garlic with about a tablespoon of the oil and let it set while the cauliflower roasted.

Excellent recipe!  I served it with goulash over whole wheat egg noodles last evening.  The only thing I may suggest is to add a little more olive oil to the recipe but other than that it was exceptionally good.  Thank you for the recipe.

This is a great way to eat caulflower.  I think next time I'll add brocolli, too.  I didn't have enough fresh garlic, so I substituted garlic powder (1/2 tsp per clove) and it worked okay.  If your head of cauliflower is a little smaller, cut down the parmesan.  It was a tad overpowering for me.

Wow!!!  I made this as directed on half a head of cauliflower then on the other half I did not put the cheese (I don't like cheese).  Everyone loves it!  I am making it again today.

I've never had cauliflower before (not that I can remember, anyway) and this was a good introduction to it.  It had a good flavor with the garlic and parm.  I had to bake it at 350 for a longer amount of time because I was baking some chicken too.  After taking the chicken out, I upped the temp to 450 and baked until done, then took it out and added the parm.

This goes with everything! I made ginger mahi-mahi and only had cauliflower in my fridge as a side. I made this and it complimented to fish perfectly. My mother-in-law raved about it and had three helpings. Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

A good and different way to serve cauliflower. I used some of the Bistro mozzarella with basil and sundried tomato just because I had it on hand in addition to the Parmesan, and it was complimentary to the cauliflower. Be careful not to let the cauliflower get too soft, or the flavor will change too much and become too strong. This was better fresh than re-heated.

This was a pretty good way of preparing a vegetable that I find boring.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the topping.  In addition to the parmesan cheese, I added the same amount of bread crumbs, I also added dried parsley instead of fresh.  I enjoyed this (as did my DH) and will likely make it again.

This is AWESOME!  Roasting adds a whole new dimension of flavor to vegetables and the garlic & Parmesan compliment this flavor very well.  I foresee our cauliflower consumption mega-increasing.  I changed nothing except I forgot to add the parsley.  That super-finicky 6-yr-old of mine wouldn't touch it, but the rest of us love this.   I'll use two heads of cauliflower next time I make this - one for the family to share and one for me!

I too made this with broccoli and the results were very good.  Some of the reviews say to add salt, and you should add a little, but not too much...i added a bit too much but it was still good.  Can't wait to try this with cauliflower!

This was really good! It tastes a bit like breaded cauliflower. My husband thought it had a bit too much garlic, but I thought it was great. A nice change from the normal cauliflower, and really easy to make.

This was a very easy way to prepare cauliflower. My whole family enjoyed it. I followed the recipe, except I had no parsley. Next time, I will decrease the oil and increase the garlic.

This was pretty good.  Mine didn't turn out with as much garlic flavor as I expected.  I would make it again, just need to figure out what other spices I can add to it to make it more flavorful.
