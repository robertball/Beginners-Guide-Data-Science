To Jenny Lynn, there is no vinegar in this recipe! Apple cider is what gives this dish its sweetness (NOT apple cider vinegar). 
Very tasty!

Just a question. It says a perfect balance of sweet and tart, but there is no sugar in the recipe. Is that right? The chicken was tender, but the only flavor coming through was vinegar.
