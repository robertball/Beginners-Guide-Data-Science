I think this recipe is absolutely gorgeous! I couldn't find maple extract so i just used Vanilla and it was absolutely fine. Once I even ran out of maple syrup halfway through and so i filled in the rest with golden syrup and it was still really good. I'm trying it once more with half whole wheat and we'll see how that turn out.

After making this I'm not going to use the recipe in my "New York Times" cookbook anymore. The banana bread recipe I was using was more labor intensive (grated orange zest) and it never turned out as good as this one. I used vanilla extract, too. I used a little less baking soda. I got great results, a moist, sweet banana-maple flavor with walnuts, I just made this first thing this morning and fresh from the oven, served warm with coffee -- it was fantastic. Thanks!

This was an excellent bread--I added walnuts to the batter as I had them left over. I think this recipe would depend on the quality of the Maple syrup and fortunately we have very good syrup in my area

This banana bread recipe is a nice change from the norm.  Here in Vermont, we love maple in/on everything, so we particularly like the maple twist.  I don't keep maple extract in the house, so I skipped that ingredient.  Like one other reviewer, I added a tsp of vanilla and cut back on the baking soda.  I have added nuts for texture, but it's good without also.

This turned out great, and I liked that the main sweetner was maple syrup.  I did make a couple small changes.  I added 1/4 tsp. salt to the flour mixture, and I stirred in a small handful of chopped walnuts to the batter in addition to the walnut topping.  And I only used 1 Tbsp. of sugar for the topping and that was plenty.  Once the bread was out of the oven and cooled slightly, I took it out of the pan and wrapped it in plastic wrap.  This kept the bread moist.  Delicious!

Very tasty and moist!  I also substituted vanilla for maple extract and lessened the baking soda.  I was very pleased.

I couldn't find my loaf pan so I made these into banana muffins. Fill your muffin tins (with liners) only 1/2 way, as they expand! I baked it for about 15 minutes, at the recommended temperature. I also skipped the maple extract (didn't have any on hand) and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla sugar, and cut back a wee bit on the syrup (to compensate for the added sugar). Divine!

This was just OK, I was a little disappointed. It had a strong baking soda taste to it and was very crumbly. I would definitely make some changes to the recipe for next time, including adding more banana and decreasing the baking soda!

I tried this recipe for a different spin on the banana bread I usually bake. What a disappointment! This bread was dry and tasteless. I'll gladly go back to my original banana bread!

Made this into muffins and topped with maple icing (from this site).  Awesome flavor in the muffins, but with the icing, these are amazing.  Definitely a dessert rather than a breakfast muffin.

My husband and I were disappointed in this recipe.  We didn't think it had much flavor and was very crumbly.  Also the crumb topping fell off every time you sliced the bread.  My just go back to my mom's banana bread recipe and try maple flavoring in that instead.

I have tried a couple of other banana bread with maple syrup, and this is good.  There are a couple of others I like better.  I only had to bake it 35 minutes.  I used 2 tbs of brown sugar instead of white sugar.

Its easy, I love that part.  However, the bread was not really sweet at all.  I did enjoy the sugar on top, but the majority of the bread was not sweet enough.  maybe add just a little something to sweeten it next time.  It was really easy!

AMAZING!!!!! this was so easy to make! My little boy was my assistant and he loved it...not to mention how great my house smelled after it was done. Instead of the maple extract i used vanilla extract... FYI-maple extract was 5 dollars for a tiny bottle!!!

A great idea and it sounds delicious but...the maple flavor is very delicate and the bread is a bit bland.  Couldn't really taste the maple or the bananas.  What we could taste was baking soda!  The recipe needs a make-over.

Good recipe but I'm a tweaker so...

I used dark brown sugar instead of white sugar, added an extra black banana (so 3 total for extra moistness and flavour) and sprinkled an extra 1/8 cup of walnuts and about 1 1/2 tbsp of brown sugar on top.

It was super extra delish!!

I love this recipe, but whenever I make it I use four bananas instead of two.  It adds maybe five minutes to the baking time, but gives a really moist, fruit-focused loaf.

I skip on the walnuts, both on top, or, as some reviewers have suggested, within (due to allergies), but the extra bananas give sufficient texture to keep it interesting, especially if you do not over mash them.

I thought this was pretty good.  Not my favorite banana bread, but tasty.  A little bit bitter, and with less body than I like.

love it! We've gone off sugar and finding recipes with no sugar is hard. I just put the walnuts into the batter and skipped the sugar. Also I used my own Gluten free flour blend and it turned out great!

I love this banana bread - it's wonderful!  I couldn't resist making a few changes though.  I used 3 smallish bananas, added 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon (love the banana-maple-cinnamon combo).  For the topping, I added another 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and replaced 1 Tbsp. of the sugar with brown sugar.  It baked up perfectly in 50 minutes and it came out so moist and delicious.  Reminds me of eating banana pancakes!

This was pretty good banana bread.  I used a mixture of whole wheat and oat flour.  I also used extra banana and eliminated the oil.  I used buttermilk instead of milk and doubled it to compensate for the oil.  Turned out very moist.  And I really like the use of the maple, makes the bread just sweet enough.   Next time I would probably use even more banana.

I made this exactly according to the recipe, and it's not as great as I hoped it would be.  I love the idea of the maple flavor though, so I haven't given up on it completely... I'll play around with it next time and see what I come up with.

This really is a beautiful banana bread recipe.  I modified the recipe a little by using pecan nuts instead of walnuts, since they go so nicely with the maple taste.  I also used about 30ml less maple syrup and replaced the flour with commercial gluten free flour which has worked perfectlyd . My loaf tin is quite large, so I doubled the recipe that is given for 12 and it's made the perfect size loaf.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. I made some changes, so I didn't think it would be fair to give it a lower rating. I used pure maple syrup but used vanilla extract and wheat flour instead of white, also I used 3 bananas and 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder. I was surprised at how unsweet the batter was, so I added a tablespoon of sugar and extra maple syrup. It came out okay, not bad, but not great. I would add alot more maple syrup to it next time if I were to make it again. I am wondering if the maple extract is the key to the maple "kick" it was missing.

Very good, and not your typical banana bread in that it was lighter than most. I made it just as directed, and then again with a few changes.  It took a full 60 minutes bake time for each, and the changes in the second version I made were simple: instead making the topping as directed , I substituted maple sugar for the white sugar, and black walnuts for the english walnuts, and mixed them directly into the batter. Lovely!

I wish there was a way to comment about a recipe without rating it.  I changed the recipe by using vanilla extract instead of maple and a little less baking soda (which was plenty), and used a commercial, non-pure maple syrup.  I'd only give the result 2 stars (but I didn't want to bring down the average).  Really, it was pretty bland.  Next time, if I didn't have maple extract on hand, I'd use the vanilla, but also add more bananas, cinnamon and raisins.  The texture's OK.  It just needs more flavor.

This maple banana bread was VERY easy to make. Although a little messy, because I'm a messy baker, it was fun and simple. I didn't have maple extract, so by recommendation of evenstarlight, I used vanilla. I used a 9x9 pan and it took 45 mins. Instead of 2 bananas, I used three. I used more nuts. And lastly, I used a "bloop" (I usually eye things) more maple syrup. I used a tiny bit too much baking powder, but it turned out FINE! It's very tasty, and moist. Amazing. Could use more banana and maple flavour, but overall, great.

This was a pretty good banana bread. I used 3 bananas, soy milk instead of regular (I forgot to pick it up at the store) and extra walnuts mixed in. I couldn't taste the maple syrup very well, so next time I would probably use a fancier variety instead of the regular stuff I had. Last thing, I used brown sugar with the walnuts over the top to give it a yummy crumbly top. It was good!

Well, this is nice moist tasty banana bread but it does not even have a hint of maple flavor so I rated it harshly.  I used the darkest I have (supposed to be grade C but more of a very dark amber) it was off, had i known that, i would have used brown sugar instead.  I guess it's my fault for assuming it would add a flavor and not just act as a sweetener.

I double the maple extract to get more of a maple flavour, and add 1 tsp of cinnamon. Also usually use whole wheat flour instead of white.

I don't think I made this correctly.  Because it did not taste good at all.  As many others recommended I substituted vanilla extract b/c I did not have maple and I used less baking soda.  It was very moist but at the same time extremely bland.  I will stick with my other banana bread recipe and not make this one ever again.  Sorry but it was not to my liking.

I had some left over maple syrup left from breakfast and I didn't want to waste it. I added enough to make 1/2 cup. I didn't have any maple extract, so I used vanilla. It didn't have TOO much maple flavor. I made them into muffins for our bnb. They were, "OK," but hubby thought they were pretty good. I've given each guest 1 and they haven't come back. They rose nice and tall, something I have trouble achieving with my muffins. Batter was pretty thick, but in the end, the texture was perfect.

Made this recipe into muffins for Father's Day brunch, and they received rave reviews!  The only change I made (since I didn't have any ripe bananas and had to use ones a little on the unripened side, which yielded less of that good banana sweetness) was to add some light brown sugar to my tasting and some chopped pecans.  Baked them at 350 for 25 mins.  Moist, delicious muffins!

I used 100% whole wheat flour, changed the maple extract to 1 tsp. vanilla, and added 1 tsp. cinnamon.  This is my favorite banana bread recipe.  The maple syrup is a natural sweetener that pairs perfectly with bananas.

I made the banana bread exact, only omitting the nuts. (My boys aren't fans of nutty breads like I am. For shame.)

This seemed like it took FOREVER to bake.
I had to place a piece of tinfoil over the top to keep it from burning. The flavor was different, but pleasant. It was easy enough to throw together with items most people have on hand.

Not my favorite banana bread, but tasty all the same.

Made this magnificent recipe, and added my own touch of taste, by adding 1 1/2 tps of pumpkin spice. Everyone here loved it and asked for more. I will definitely be making this for the holidays.

Pretty amazing Banana bread! I love maple anything, but I never thought to put it in banana bread! I made a few substitutions based on the ingredients I had, but it worked out well! I used vanilla extract instead of maple extract, egg beaters for the eggs, I left out the nuts, added chocolate chips, and topped them with cinnamon sugar. Made mini loaves which took 25 minutes to cook. I used oil instead of butter, but it still had a butter taste since I used some butter-flavored maple pancake syrup. I KNOW this recipe would be even more amazing with pure maple syrup, but the HUGE jug I got from Vermont is nearly empty! Gives me an excuse to plan a vacation though! ;) Can't wait to try this with pure maple syrup, and I might play around with the flour(wheat/oat)and with the egg beaters, it'll also be a pretty healthy bread! Thanks so much for the recipe! :)

Delicious! The perfect fall variation of banana bread. I made some adjustments, but five stars for a good solid recipe. (Adjustments: 1. Added a nice heaping half teaspoon of ground allspice. 2. Added about 1/8 t. fresh ground white pepper. 3.  Used vanilla extract instead of maple because I didn't have maple. 4. Left out the nuts because my fiancé is allergic. 5. Accidentally included the sugar in the batter because I wasn't reading the recipe carefully enough, heheh.)

First let me say I hate it when people change a recipe and then rate it poorly.  But I did change the recipe however I do love it. I replaced the butter with coconut oil (I'm dairy free), vanilla extract instead of maple extract (didn't have any), replaced milk with almond milk, added 1/2t salt and substituted whole wheat pastry flour for the white flour.  I also ditched the sugar and just added a cup of walnuts and about 3/4 c of dairy free chocolate chips and to top it off I made muffins (filled tins 3/4 full baked 20 minutes).  These aren't real sweet but that's fine, I wanted a muffin with a lot less refined sugar (so I only had what was in the chocolate chips) and ended up with a much healthier muffin that still is a treat and doesn't taste too healthy.

No different tasting then any other normal banana bread recipe. Still a decent recipe if you like maple syrup.  I am going to try Butter Pecan syrup next time to test the flavor.

This is a great recipe and I love there is only maple syrup as sweetener.  I've made this before and always have added walnuts, but this time I was out so I didn't.  Still love it, even without the walnuts.  :)  Spread with a thin layer of maple cream for a super delicious and mapley flavor!

It was very nice, not too sweet, but the maple syrup was wasted because the flavour was not at all apparent. I have had banana bread that was every bit as good but did not involve the expensive maple syrup as an ingredient.

I made this a little healthier by replacing the ap flour with ww and replacing half the butter with applesauce. It turned out delicious. My favourite part was the crunchy topping. I'd make this again for sure.

Although there really wasn't much maple flavor in the finished product, this recipe did result in a lovely, moist and delicious banana bread.  I doubled the recipe to make two loaves and naturally I was a few tbsp short of maple syrup, so I topped it off with some dark agave and an additional splash of maple flavoring, and used 5 large bananas.  It smelled wonderful baking and when the loaves came out of the oven they were a beautiful golden brown. Very nice texture.  I actually forgot the sugar and next time will add it because I think it could use a touch more sweetness - even though there was a lot of maple syrup here, the bread is not too sweet at all.  Nice recipe! I will definitely add it to our banana bread rotation!

I really like maple syrup so I thought this would be a great recipe for me but somehow it did not turn out right. The bottom of the bread was doughy and rubbery and only the upper half seemed to have been baked right. I wonder what I did wrong? Possibly beat the batter too long? Need to work on the taste and add some of the suggested spices but otherwise ok. Can someone think of what I may have done wrong? Thanks.

This is a great banana bread recipe. It is very moist and flavorful. I brought the bread to share with a group of people who were helping move a friend.  They all loved it. I used vanilla instead of maple flavoring, because it's what I had on hand. The maple flavor from the syrup wasn't very strong.  That was fine with me. I especially appreciate that this recipe does not require processed sugar.  I enjoy experimenting with alternatives to sugar.

This was an excellent tasting bread and it made a beautiful loaf.  I like that there is no refined sugar in it.  You won't miss it!  I used vanilla extract instead of maple only because I didn't have maple.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, minus the topping.

Pretty good bread.  I didn't have maple syrup so I pondered for a while and used honey and maple flavoring instead.  It needed another 10-15 minutes past the stated bake time, but that seems to happen a lot in my oven.  The taste is good and it's moist.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great basic recipe.  I tweeked it with adding another egg, some cinnamon with the the flour mixture.  I used 3 large bananas and for the topping, brown sugar. Came out in about 45 minutes and was just perfect.

I was so excited to find a maple banana bread recipe, but found this one a little on the bland side. I couldn't really taste the banana and I couldn't really taste the maple (I made the recipe exactly as indicated). It was just "OK" - I wouldn't make it again.

This recipe is tasty, but nothing special & cannot compare with the standard sour cream banana bread I usually make. This bread turned out pretty fluffy.  The changes I made were as follows: 1) used margarine instead of butter because that is what I had in the house 2) didn't add in maple extract because I didn't have any 3) added 1/4 tsp of salt to the flour mix 4) added 1 tbs brown sugar to the topping to make up for the missing sweetness of the maple extract.  Again, I am not saying this is a bad recipe but I have had better banana breads that are much more moist, dense & flavorful.

This recipe is more subtle than I thought it would be based on other's reviews. I didn't find it overly sweet. It came out a little dry but otherwise has a good flavor esp. after toasting and buttering it.

Everyone loved this Banana Bread, I also didn't have maple extract, but because I was using fresh Maple syrup from the local farm in the area, I found that was enough.

This recipe was a nice template for me but based on other reviews such as it being bland and requiring too much soda, I made a few changes. I lowered the baking soda by about 1/4 tsp, I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, I added 1 c of slivered almonds to the batter (I love nuts so the pecan topping and almonds inside were great for me), and I swapped 3/4 c of wheat flour for some of the white flour to make it a little more healthy. Lastly, I baked them in muffin tins instead of a loaf pan to cut down on time. 20 mins at 350 and they were done (the recipe made 15 muffins by the way). They turned out great!

I followed the directions to the T..  Wasn't a great recipe.
Sort of fell apart, and the bottom didn't cook up like it should have.

I found a better one with 1/2 cup of sour cream for a real moist Banana Nut Bread..

Although this was very tasty! It was really dry and Dence. I will make it again but will find a way to make it moist. I think adding more bananas, and maybe some oil or cream will make this moist and delicious. Also it could use some raisins to add to the flavor.

11.22.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/36772/maple-banana-bread/ ... This was okay, but no one could identify the difference as maple.  A bit too buttery.  'Ended up throwing nearly half of it away.

Followed this recipe to a tee, and found it somewhat flavorless and soda'ish as others noted. Had high hopes though. Will find a better banana bread recipe to give it a maple kick.

This was excellent!!  Of course, I had to make my it my own.  I doubled the recipe, used vanilla extract, substituted bourbon for half the milk, mixed the walnuts in the batter but sprinkled the top with the sugar.  My house smelled so good and we ate it hot because we couldn't wait.  I am looking forward to eating the remaining loaf!

Overall, boring flavor and dry. I cannot taste maple at all and I used both actual maple syrup and maple syrup extract. I will not make this again, too many modifications needed to make it taste good.

Really Delicious, made as written except left out the walnut & sugar topping. I love how this bread was all sweetened by the maple syrup. I did add the extract but not sure if that is necessary as i couldn't taste it. oh well no big deal as this was a perfectly moist and fluffy bread, one of the best ive ever made and eaten.

This bread turned out great! Not as much maple flavor as expected. Most likely due to the absence of maple extract which I did not have. Overall a moist and delicious result... Especially with that sweet crunchy topping.

Quite tasty with the maple flavour, though a little drier than I expected.

I used Vanilla extract instead of maple and really liked the depth of flavor it added.  For me, the bread was tasty but dry. I live at 6000' and often have this problem with baked goods.  Does anyone have suggestions to help?

This banana bread was great! I used almond flour to make it gluten free and it turned out amazing. Couldn't even tell that it was gluten free, no strange texture and it's super moist.

I loved it and so did the Hubby. Especially the topping. Made it exactly as recipe except for the maple extract, which I did not have. Used vanilla extract as the other reviewers have stated they used. Will absolutely make it again.  Liked the idea of using maple syrup. It is not too sweet and very moist.

I love that this uses maple syrup which goes well with bananas! I've made this numerous times and give it to the neighbors (who give us apple bananas from their trees!) who LOVE it. They especially love the topping. By the way, three tablespoons of sugar for the topping is way too much. I use half that.

I would actually give it a 4.5 rating .... it is very tasty.  I found it helpful to mix the dry ingredients first (sugar and nuts in one bowl, flour, soda and powder in another) and then mash the bananas, so that once I began to put things together, I didn't have to stop and measure and mix other things .... I could just work straight through the process.  Also, if you turn the baked loaf over to get it out of the pan, some of the topping may come off -- it is quite messy, so have a plan to catch it! :-)

I will make this again. My friends and family really enjoyed it. I used real maple syrup and used miniloaf pans.

This is my new banana bread recipe! I loved it, and I've been making my mom's banana bread recipe for years. 

I used apple sauce instead of sugar, cut back a smidge on the baking powder and soda.

Used oil instead of butter and extra 1/2 banana instead of egg to make it beautifully vegan! 4 yo, 3yo, 1yo gobbled it up!

It crumbles and is not sweet. I added 3 bananas because they were small and I didn't do her topping bc I had left over streusel topping (butter, brown sugar, and crushed pecans), which I used instead. I also used organic maple extract. Maybe that made a difference? Didn't taste the maple, nor the banana. Just a crumbled, flavorless, mess. My streusel topping was good though.

I wanted more banana taste... I used the recipe as written... mostly!! I did 1/2 tap of pure vanilla, 1/4 tap of maple extract, and 1/2 tap of vanilla nut extract. I also used 2.5 bananas and added 1/2 package of banana cream pudding mix.. I put walnuts and white sugar in the bread batter... LOTS of flavor!!!

I liked the texture of this and it rose well and baked well, but it was a little bland.  I added shredded carrots to it.  I think a lot of cinnamon would help it taste better.

I loved it!  I used 2 large bananas but feel it can use at least 1 more banana.  Also I feel it can use just a touch more sweetener.  I used vanilla extract and it worked fine...baking time was perfect...it browned very nicely...so to sum up...it could be just slightly sweeter & richer but overall I will use and tweak this recipe again, thank you!
