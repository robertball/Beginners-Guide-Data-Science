I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't turn out anything close to drunken noodles I have eaten out in restaurants. Next time I would add carrots, double the sauce, and add some chili paste or chili-garlic sauce to give it a little heat.

I enjoyed trying this recipe.  My finished dish was tasty, but required some tweaks.  I found the sauce to noodle ratio way off, I only added 8oz of noodles and still found the dish too dry and not saucy enough to coat the noodles, meat, and veggies.  I added some prepared stir fry sauce to save the dish.  Probably could have added some broth, too.  I used ground chicken and spicy ground pork instead of diced chicken.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I used egg roll skins (as noodles) cut in to 1" wide strips. I add them in at the end of cooking so they would not be over cooked and this was Great. Great flavor, taste, and texture. My family loved it.

Too sweet and sour and not enough of anything else. It was ok.
