It was pretty bland so we added cheese on top. I was short a potato so I added a sweet potato, without which the dish would have been REALLY bland.  The dish is really not attractive to look at if you follow the directions since the sprinkled flour remains where it landed in small white clumps. The onion also remains semi-raw so there is no depth of flavor. The dish lacked the creamy sauce I was expecting from the name.

If I were to make it again, this is what I would do:
Instead of layering as directed, use the butter (possibly a little more than directed) to cook the onions and some garlic in a frying pan.  When the onions are translucent, add the flour to make a roux. Then add the milk, salt, and paprika and cook until slightly thickened.  Pour 1/3 of sauce over each layer, then bake as directed.

After reading tons of reviews on this I hesitated to make it but call me suborn but I just needed to see for myself.  Made it exactly as written.  It was simple and easy without the time it took to make a roux.  The truth is "it tasted just like POTATOES", which is what it was meant to be.  Not cheesy or garlic or anything else and it was very good.  What is wrong with the good old fashioned taste of potatoes?  If you want something else make something else... if you want an easy scalloped potato recipe I recommend this.

After reading he reviews, I upped the garlic, threw all the ingredients into the crockpot together. Halfway through the baking time, I added cheese to the top. I think these were better as leftovers than with dinner. I think this definitely needed the cheese and probably more than I added.

My brother-in-law makes a recipe that sounds and tastes  exactly like this one, simple and delicious just as it is. For an added layer of tasty goodness I thinly sliced a small onion and caramlized prior to adding to potato dish, plus I used more flour, salt, and paprika than originally called for. I used heavy cream in place of milk and added  1/2 lb hickory smoked ham, diced. I layered the potato dish in a 9x13" pan to give more surface area for the crisping of top layer of potatoes, bc that's my favorite part. I was going to add shredded sharp cheddar cheese but this rich and creamy dish doesn't need it. Next time I make this dish I will slice potatoes thinner to lessen cooking time, be aware it takes a full hour plus to cook this dish perfectly. All in all- we loved the crispy potatoes on the top and the velevety perfectly cooked scalloped potatoes underneath, thank you to whomever posted this recipe, this is one dish I make repeatedly,

Glad I added garlic and extra paprika, this dish would have been bland without it.

My  two small casseroles are still in the oven, so four stars for now. I gave them a head start with 4 minutes in the microwave. After reading reviews, I think the garlic is probably a good idea, but to all those who added cheese, you no longer have scalloped potatoes; you've made au gratin potatoes.

This is a very simple recipe. I made it with butter milk instead of regular milk. I cooked the onions in pan with garlic, salt, pepper, paprika & a pinch of dry sage. I added 3 table spoons of flour  & 3 table spoons of butter to the pan and made a rue. I slowly added the butter milk to the pan with the heat on low. I poured that over the pototes.  I added cheeses to all layers and it was delicious! ! I will definitely make this again.

These were really easy, and really good. I took some user's suggestions and made a few modifications. I used 5 russet potatoes. I only layered twice because that's the room I had in the casserole dish. I doubled the butter, and sprinkled paprika and garlic powder on each layer. I also sprinkled shredded cheddar in the middle layer and on top. Next time I'll cover it with foil and wait until close to the end to sprinkle the layer of cheese on top - maybe take the foil off 15 minutes before it's done baking so the cheese gets melty.

yummy, we added ham but this is scalloped the way my mom used to make, not au gratin which uses cheese.

As always, when I make a recipe from allrecipes.com I try it as written the first time, then modify it if I think that is needed when I make it a second time. My 3 stars are based on the recipe as written; a good starting  point but some additions make it much better.   Along with many of the other reviewers I found the recipe as written bland. I added minced garlic with the onions.  I also added black pepper and just a bit of cayenne pepper to the flour mixture.   Try it, I think you will like it.  By the way, I am also sure the addition of shredded cheese would make it more flavorful, but wouldn't that make it Potatoes Au Gratin?

Really good scalloped potatoes, thanks for posting the recipe. For the last five minutes in the oven, I tossed some shredded cheddar on top, it was great!

I made these changes - based on other review and common sense.  
1. First I sliced and cooked potatoes in microwave for 7 minutes cause I only had 35 min to oven cook.  2. During, I sliced onion and lightly cooked in butter in saucepan.  3. Fished out onion and added garlic for 1 min, then 2.5 cups milk and made a roux (added garlic powder, salt and pepper.  4. Layered potato, onion, thin sliced parmesan (family preference), twice.  5. Sprinkled paprika and baked 35 min at 400.  

So I know it's lousy to review a recipe after changing it, but I didn't know how to make it without this recipe.  I want this review to tell me how to make it next time.  My family LOVED it.

This is a really simple recipe and I only made a few changes. I used a 2 quart pan rather than a 1 quart. I added pepper and an extra 1/4 tsp salt. Also found that adding 1.4lb of finely chopped chicken breast really helped the dish.

had never made scalloped potatoes before, they came out amazing. I did take the advice of many people and cooked the onions (I used a whole onion!) in the butter and added lots of garlic and spices, and flour, and then the milk and let it thicken a bit, then added that to the potatoes ... not in neat layers, mixed it around a bit, an hour at 400, and it came out delicious

As written, I think a great recipe!  Thanks!  As always, you can tweak to your liking... I did the 2 qt dish, because I don't have the 1 qt (broke it sadly)... turned out great.

I did add garlic because we love it...  black pepper... garlic salt... but not for everyone... I really liked that the potatoes came out perfect and crispy on top.  A great basic recipe that could really hold up to any additions!

Thanks again!

We liked it. I followed the recipe exactly, and it did not turn out as creamy as I would have liked so next time I may shorten the cooking time. I did add black pepper after the first taste, and adding garlic would be good too. Will make again as it is a good base recipe.

Excellent!  A classic recipe that is sure to please.  Baking at 400 gives you the crunchy top while the middle is creamy goodness.

Well.  Based on others' reviews of this recipe being kind of bland,  I also added a clove of minced garlic and shredded cheese (maybe 1/2 cup); still pretty bland.  I didn't like the way the flour just sat on top and did not mix with the butter and milk.  It got pretty brown on top after about 45 minutes, so I took it out, but some of the potatoes weren't done.  If I make this again, I would make the following changes:  I would slice the potatoes thinner, add more onion and maybe garlic powder, add more cheese, add more salt and pepper, make a roux of the flour and butter and milk,  bake it covered at 375 for about an hour,  then uncovered for maybe 15 minutes. I know, I know, that's an entirely different recipe, but I feel I would like it much better, just sayin'....

Wish I had read the reviews before I made them!  They were definitely VERY bland.  Was going to trash the recipe but will try it again with some additions.

I made this on Christmas day and it was a big hit. My family loved it. I took the advice of other reviewers and made a roux. I also used the more expensive white cheddar cheese which was worth it and also added some Asiago cheese. I baked it covered for an hour and took off the foil the last 15 minutes. I will be definitely be making this again.

My husband normally doesn't like scalloped potatoes and he liked these. Went well with a spicier chicken and heated up great for leftovers too. Will definitely make again!

I added garlic and cheese and it turned out delicious. I also used more than six potatoes...more like 10 or so. I will definitely be making this again.

Made exactly as written. Good flavor of comforting potatoes & onions,.... I just wish it was creamier. Maybe I should add more milk next time.

These needed more salt and more flavor overall. Bland and milky-tasting. I probably won't make it again. (The only thing I changed was to add sharp cheddar cheese in the layers--wasted my cheese. . .)

I made this in individual casserole dishes which decreased the baking time by a bit.  It smells delicious but is quite bland.  Have the salt and pepper on hand.

The based recipe is nice but is lacking in flavor. I ended up making a roux with 1 TB of butter and flour then adding the milk and flavored this mixture with pepper, salt and garlic. When stacking the layers I added the paprika and some basil, also poured some of the mixture in every layer then whatever was left  over the whole thing. I think this definitely needs much more seasoning.

10.15.18  So easy to make using the slicing blade on the food processor.  I used skim milk (what I had on hand) and still found these potatoes delicious.  There’s no need to add cheese as others have mentioned; these are scalloped potatoes, not potatoes au gratin.  Delicious side dish to Instant Pot Cranberry Balsamic Pork Loin and some fordhook lima beans.  ****UPDATE 2.18.19****  This time I skipped the “chopped” onion and added thinly-sliced onion to each of the potato layers.  Also, added a healthy dose of freshly-ground black pepper to the flour-salt mixture.  If you have a food processor, it just doesn’t get much easier than this recipe for DELICIOUS  scalloped potatoes!

I used Chihuahua quesadilla cheese and Vidalia onions. It was delish.  No garlic. The onions were, indeed, almost as sweet as apples.  Backed the same time as meatloaf. A veggie or salad made it a great meal.

This is a keeper!  I just finished eating the last of it and will definitely be making again.  I used small red potatoes and added two to three garlic cloves minced.  Instead of layering the flour and seasonings on top of each layer, I made a béchamel sauce and added the paprika then poured some on each layer and used the rest to pour on top at the end.  I also sprinkled just a little parmesan/romano on top of each layer.  This will be the dish I will take to our next potluck at church or when my family gets together.

Add bite size pieces of ham from spiral; used diced frozen hash browns and freeze dried onions.  (In a lot of pain tonight so took some shortcuts).  Didn't even measure but did 3 layers.  Yes, will definitely make again.  It was a meal in itself.  I also added a bit of shredded cheddar on top.

11 28 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/240289/creamy-and-crispy-scalloped-potatoes/ ... I didn't think these were anything special, but E, 20, complimented so "Yay!"  I wonder if they're better in a shallow dish.  I covered then removed after tender.  Oh, I used a tip my dear friend, Emma, gave.  Melt the butter in the warmed milk, then pour.  I'm all about streamlining.  :)

Having tried many here, this recipe for scalloped potatoes yields the best results but still must be changed to yield incredible, creamy potatoes -- and with less fat! But you cannot do away with making a roux. For 2 people, I do the simple white sauce calculation -- 1 TB butter, 1 TB flour, 1 cup milk. To make it a tad thick, I make the measurements heaping. I layer the potatoes as described but now skip the flour and butter and add a sprinkling of garlic powder in addition to the salt and pepper over each layer. Once the white sauce is desired consistency, I pour over and bake at 350 for approximately 40-45 minutes, adding a layer of cheese on top the last 10 minutes (I used Jack, which was super with pork chops) and toasting/broiling  the top to golden brown before serving. Incredible!

Not creamy or crunchie as I expected; suggest mixing flour and milk together before pouring over potatoes.

Was very bland. Looked at the reviews after (a mistake!) and realized I should have added a lot more onion and a sharp cheese. 

Will try again, but with many of the reviewers suggested add ons.

I read some of the reviews and thus added a bit more paprika, garlic, and used cheddar cheese.  These made it much better.

It need more taste in my opinion.   I added powdered garlic, spinach, onions.  It also did better with more salt and cheese.

These were very good.  As some suggested I also minced 2 cloves of garlic and added 1/2 c. freshly grated parmesan cheese at the end.  Thanks MKBeatles

I actually haven't made this recipe yet.  I accidentally posted a review that was meant for another recipe, but don't know how to delete it.
