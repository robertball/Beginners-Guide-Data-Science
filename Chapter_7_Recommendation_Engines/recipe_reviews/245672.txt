Just got back from Sicily and I was looking for a pistachio pesto recipe. This sauce tastes pretty authentic. My husband and I were both very happy. I did not use gluten free noodles though.

I enjoyed the pistachio pesto and it alone will grab you. I used a pestle and mortar to make it so I didn't need the ice cubes. The pasta is probably the best gluten free pasta around, not just for it's authentic taste, but for texture. Thank you for the recipe.
