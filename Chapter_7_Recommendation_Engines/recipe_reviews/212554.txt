As is, it lacks on flavour BIG TIME.  Suggest it needs some herbs - oregano, thyme, basil, etc., It was quick & what I normally would think of a comfort food, but it needs more flavour.

my family loves this recipe! I just add some sauteed onions and a little celery. It's always requested at turkey time!

Have to read on...I put 3 stars because this recipe is too bland stand alone.  The other reviews had good tips and this recipe is a good base and then you can add what you want to spice it up. I sauteed chopped onion, garlc, and celery in a little butter.  Added pepper, oregano, and basil to taste.  And also added some shredded parmessan to crumb topping.
