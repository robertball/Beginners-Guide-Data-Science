This was very good.  I didn't have strawberries so I used mango..also good.  I think I might use a different vinegar next time...taste was good but hubby didn't like the strong cider odor.  Maybe use white wine vinegar next time.

This salad was absolutely delicious! I don't know that the dressing really needs to be refrigerated for six hours. I also don't think I will use butter to toast the almonds the next time - I'll just use a dry skillet. That said, it's wonderful as is!
