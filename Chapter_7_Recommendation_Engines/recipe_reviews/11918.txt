A little bland for my tastes.  No garlic=Not Italian.  Add some garlic and basil for starters.

Excellent and easy base recipe.  I made the following changes.  I increased all portions by 15% and made each layer thicker.  Used Butter Milk rather than normal milk.  Substituted a double amount of wheat germ for bread crumbs.  (I always find this tastier than bread crumbs in recipes) And spiced the meat to our taste.  Topped with  thawed and drained chopped frozen spinach and then the final Mozarella.  Baked for 40 minutes and then changed the oven to top grill at a higher heat to brown it off for ten.  Came out looking and smelling fantastic.  Family ate every last bit!

This was my first time ever attempting to make lasagna. This is a fantastic recipe even for a beginner. My family loved it. A friend said it was better than his mothers who had been making lasagna forever. I think that says it all. Will absolutely make again. My family said I had to. Great Job Missy!

This was a great lasagna recipe, and pretty easy to make!  All that it needed was a little salt/pepper, which could be added when browning the ground beef.  I added it after the fact and it turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

I used sauce with mushrooms already added and regular lasagna noodles.  I took it to a potluck and got rave reviews.  Thanks so much and by the way I didn't take the credit!!!

Wonderful recipe!!!  I normally don't use cottage cheese in lasagna but wanted to try something different.  I ended up getting company when I made this and was asked for the recipe.  Thanks for this post!

Overall, I'd say this recipe for lasagna was okay.  I added about two and a half TBSP. of garlic and increased the tomato sauce by at least a half cup, although it was still a little dry. (I used part of a jar of Ragu with basil in it.)  I also added a 10 oz. pkg of spinach, threw in some leftover slices of Italian sausage and used on an 8 oz. pkg of oven ready lasagna.  I'll try a different lasagna recipe next time...

This came out quite dry so I think I will try it again with a can of tomatoes added. I think I'll also put in equal portions of cottage cheese and ricotta cheese because ricotta cheese is too dry for my tastes. I will probably also add garlic and a bit of basil or oregano.

Please add more seasoning - needs garlic, parsley, a bit of salt & skip the boring bread crumbs...and if you want a fluffy mid-section, add more eggs - up to 4 or 5 (an Italian told me this & it's lovely) and  Parmesan cheese to the egg/ricotta/cottage cheese combo - at least a half  a cup of "real" parm..also - YOU CAN USE ANY lasagna noodles - as long as you put a first layer of the sauce on the bottom of the dish...you don't need to pay more for the "instant noodles"...or waste time cooking the noodles! Just some quick tips to make this tastier, less expensive & simpler...

As you add noodles to each layer generously spray the layer with lightly salted water - I have a spray bottle that i just use for cooking purposes. Easy to do and works great!

The first time I made this lasagna(and it was my first time making lasagna, ever) I didn't fully understand the "no-cook noodles" part...anyways the noodles came out uncooked but everything else had a good flavor so I refused to give up on it. So the next time I tried making it, I cooked the noodles and used the same recipe, except I added garlic, salt and a dash of pepper to the ground beef while browning it and a bit more shredded cheese to the cheese mixture and it came out absolutely delicious. My mom was astonished at how wonderfully delicious it was and my hubby loved it :)

I never pre-cook my lasagna noddles and I don't buy any special noodles.  I use regular plain lasagna noodles.  I do add a little extra sauce and the noodles cook as the lasagna cooks. I have been doing this for 40 years and my lasagna always comes out perfect.....and it is a huge time saver

Very good recipe!  I substituted vegetarian crumbles for the ground beef and it was absolutely perfect! We made two loaf-size pans of lasagna and froze one for another time :)

I agree with Josyln H.  Don't review so harshly if you haven't even tried it.  You could add polite suggestions but the "ew" part of one review was uncalled for.  I, for example, do not like cottage cheese or bell pepper, so I simply wouldn't add it.  I found the addition of bread crumbs to be inventive and I WILL try that.  To another reviewer, the reason your noodles didn't cook is probably because you didn't buy the lasagna noodles which specify "No Cooking Needed".    All in all, this is a delicious recipe and I believe the canned mushrooms were for ease in preparation so there is no need for slicing and sauteing.  Missy, this recipe is wonderful.  It's a nice change from the one I'd been making for years.

This recipes fast and easy to make. Which is just what I needed when I was asked to bring lasagna to a work social. My co-workers loved it so much that I was asked to bring it a second time with co-workers offering to pay me for the cast of the ingrediants. Thanks Missy

Easy and good. Can add more spice if you like or use jarred spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce but remember the bread crumbs you add to the cheese mixture are Italian seasoned. Delcious as is. Thanks Missy.

I have been making lasagna for several years.  Of course my family says it's the best.  I did not make this lasagna recipe because just by reading it I can tell you need about 28 ozs. more sauce, especially if using the no boil lasagna noodles.  That's why it is so dry.  Whoever found it dry, try it again with MORE sauce.

So bland and the noodles were uncooked.  The end product could have done without the dried bread crumbs... they took moisture away from the recipe when it needed it.  Would definitely add some herbs next time - basil garlic oregano and salt and pepper for sure.
This recipe really fell short.  Plus why used canned mushrooms ever!

This recipe has a good base, but definetly needs some spices and herbs eg. garlic, basil, oregano, salt and pepper. and more sauce if using oven-ready noodles, or add some wine to the sauce.

NOTE: "slightly custom" review: 

Nice, simple recipe which is why I chose it. And the good ratings, of course.   I am basing my rating on quantity of ingredients.  Could have used a half lb more meat) and at least 50 percent more cheese mixture.   If doing this, I would 8 oz more tomato sauce as well.   The dish came out moist (unlike other reviews) but the edges were very dry due to lack of coverage. 

I will note (as above, the custom aspect): I used lean ground turkey as it was all that was defrosted.   I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned (just sauteed them first) and added chopped up three cloves of garlic.  Lack of garlic seemed like an odd omission.

This is a basic lasagna recipe. It's an excellent starting point, but made as written, it needs some serious help to be called impressive. With only plain tomato sauce, onion and green pepper, it is missing key spices to make it have that true Italian taste. Also, the addition of the bread crumbs to the cheese mixture, give it an odd texture, instead of a creamy one, that you don't normally expect in lasagna. Overall, this recipe is mediocre, at best. However, the good bones are there to give it potential.

This was good, but needed more cheese on top. I used ground turkey because that is what I had on hand. Could do without the bread crumbs. That gave the cheese filling a different texture that I didn't care for. Also needs garlic somewhere. Next time I'll add some with the meat, onion, and green peppers.
