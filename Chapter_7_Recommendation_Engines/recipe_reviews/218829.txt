This is one of the yummiest (and lightest) recipies I've ever made! I first made it for a couple when the wife had just come out of the hospital; I wanted something yummy but something lighter.  I took it over and they invited me to stay and enjoy it with them.  We all LOVED it and they begged me for the recipe.  (In fact, they asked me where I got the recipe and they said, "We LOVE that website...ha ha!)  This is a keeper.  The only thing I actually changed is the sausage.  I actually prefer Hillshire farms Hot & Spicy sausage (I like it spicer).  And I add more peppers (and more colorful peppers to add more color).  But this rocks! :)  I also made Bruschetta as a nice side dish. :)

What a delicious recipe! I stuck to the recipe, except for two minor changes - I used Johnsonville chicken/pork blend mild Italian Sausage and whole wheat fettucine to make it healthier. The veggies smelled amazing while they were roasting. I cooked the sausages in a pan, until just slightly pink, sliced them and tossed them in with the veggies to finish cooking. I think next time I will cook the sausage on the outdoor grill for added flavor. This one's a keeper!

We enjoyed this recipe.  We don't eat peppers, so I used 1 yellow squash & 1 zucchini.  I didn't have feta, so we substituted grated italian cheese mix and added basil, pepper & salt.

This was good! Light and baking the veggies with the sausage gave it a nice flavour.

Delicious, easy recipe.  I chopped and prepped the vegetables the night before and then tonight I just popped it into the oven, boiled the noodles, tossed and served. I was skeptical this would be good without a sauce, but the sausage (casings removed) and feta add great flavor.

Had friends over for dinner and served this, along with a broccoli salad.  Yum! It was a hit and so easy! I loved the interesting flavor of the feta cheese and that the veggies weren't drowned in red sauce. Definitely a favorite

This was good!  I made it using regular garden tomatoes, a mix of colored peppers, and hot Italian turkey sausage.  I didn’t cut the sausage into coins, but grilled it whole, and served it atop the pasta and roasted veggies.  My garden tomatoes were quite mushy/watery after roasting and perhaps the meatier roma variety would have held up better.  I did use the time and temp indicated in the recipe, although I thought it might be excessive.  However all the veggies turned out well except the tomatoes.  I'll try it again using romas to compare.

This was delicious. I stayed pretty true to the original recipe, tho I used hot Italian sausage because that’s what we had.  I also seasoned the vegetables with salt and pepper (because cmon, mama didn’t raise any fools.) Halfway through I started panicking because the veggies were boiling in their juices rather than roasting. When I added the sausage to the veggies, I transferred everything to a large baking sheet, and ended up broiling them for the last five mins.  I’m not sure that was necessary, in the end.  On first bite, I was happily surprised. The flavor was great and I’ll definitely make this again.
