Made these without the red pepper as I knew the kids wouldn't go for that. Easy to make. Made some with my small scoop, those came out great. Made some with my larger scoop and flattened those more like croquettes. Those came out more like Chicken flavored biscuits -- not a bad thing, but might try reducing the baking mix some next time. Thanks for a great recipe Nicole!

Yummy and quick.  This one is a keeper. I used Chi Chi's southwestern ranch dip and served them hot.  They were gone before I knew it!

An interesting concept- mostly like a biscuit flavored with chicken.  I added a little salt, subbed sharp cheddar cheese, and had to add a little milk to prevent crumbling while shaping the balls.  Maybe that's because I used reduced fat baking mix.  Will certainly make again...maybe add some chopped up bacon  green onion.

Wish I'd read all the reviews before I pre-made a double batch for my party (by the way, this makes about 5 dozen 1" balls!).  I thought they were bland also and would have added more spices, but they were filling and not bad with salsa.  I suppose I'll leave them for the guests who like blander foods and definitely NOT call them spicy, and will serve a variety of dipping sauces with them.  I doubt I'll keep the recipe though!

I like them.  I just think it may be too much bread.  However, my two year old LOVED them.

Great idea for the kids - sans the red pepper of course. But you need much less baking mix and more chicken otherwise it tastes like a bland dough ball even with sauce. next time I will bump up the chicken, turn down the mix, put some more onion in there and maybe garlic and I think we'll have a winner

They were really good and easy to make.  I used cheddar cheese instead of Monetery Jack and chili powder instead of red pepper flakes.  They were good dipped in ranch dressing, but even better in homemade vegetable dip.

maybe after I tweak this a little I may rate it differently but I was not impressed with this.  I  have another LB of ground chicken now in the freezer but I keep putting off trying this again because of the level of disappointment.  The idea is great and when we added spicy ranch as the dipping it was okay but not more than that.  It's not like it's horrible... it is just missing the WOW factor.  I agree that it tastes like a biscuit with chicken flavor.  We are a huge fan of the anytizers and thought this would be a good replacement.  It's nice to have something in the freezer and pull out and put in the toaster oven when we have suprised guests visit.  I think I am going to try again and cut back on the biscuit mix (use it more or less as a filler rather than the main ingredient) and add a little hot sauce and/or cayenne pepper.  I think if these had more spice, it would zing it up a little and give it a higher rating.  I'm trying other recipes now, but will maybe come back to this one some day and will see what the changes do for it.  If the changes don't make a difference, I won't try again.  sorry.

I love these balls, except I make them without the red pepper flakes, cuz I dont like things real spicy. I only use about 1/3 of the baking mix it says and double up on the garlic.

These were OK, they were just very bland.  I tried adding additional spices but it just didn't seem to do it.  Served with honey mustard sauce, which helped, but I don't know if we'll be making these again.

This recipe was very bland and tasteless except for the pepper flakes.  Far too doughy to be enjoyed.  A good concept but much experimenting with quantities of baking mix, chicken and cheese ratios is needed to get an enjoyable snack.  I even had my eldest taste test then for his cheese and bread loving children,  he himself eats anything.  He tried them alone and with a number of sauces and condiments and couldn't get them to taste good to him.  Failure for a snack for the grandchildren. Disappointed.

Too bland, too nothing.   Too much baking mix even though I added only 2 cups of the 3.    Don't often ditch recipes but will this one.

I made these with Sausage instead of chicken the first couple of times and loved them.  I thought I'd try the chicken to see if they were better - and I thought the chicken ones were very bland.  I'll go back to using sausage - those are a hit!  :)

Turned out really well.  Used only 2cups of baking mix because that's all I had and used sharp cheddar and smokey paprika and a little chayenne pepper.  Kids loved them but could do without the onions.  Very very sticky to work with but I'll definitely make them again.

These turned out to be much less flavorful than we hoped they would be.  There was no hint of chicken or cheese that we could taste, and they were nowhere near spicy.  They mostly just tasted like biscuits to us.  We will try them again with only 1 cup biscuit mix next time and a we will probably add double the red pepper and maybe some chopped chile peppers.

very dry! you defiantley need the ranch dip!!!  I personally think there was to much biscuit mix.
