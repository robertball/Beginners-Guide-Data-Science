2.28.20  They certainly are easy to make, and I followed the recipe to the letter.  Although I liked the flavor of these rolls, the one thing that just didn’t satisfy me was the texture.  The turned out somewhat dry and chewy, not soft like an ideal cinnamon roll should be.  One criticism I have is that the recipe doesn’t give you any indication on what size the dough rectangle should be (such as 16” x 21”), and that’s important.  Also, I chopped up 2 cups of pecans which turned out to be too much on top of the sugar mixture. I stopped at 1 cup, probably because my dough rectangle should have been larger.  This recipe has no icing, so I took the photo accordingly.  My husband asked “where’s the icing,” so I did go back and made a quick glaze, and gave each roll a drizzle.  These were OK, not my favorite on this site, and honestly,  doubtful I’ll make again.

Loved these! Used coffee for the liquid, proofed my yeast, used molasses and seasonings for the center, and chia seeds instead of flax seed. I let it rise a bit longer both times. They came out perfect- except they needed more sugar! I'm thinking dates....I will try it. 
Thank you for this! It's hard to find good vegan eats!

Not bad, but could be better. I prefer the giant rolls, and I was looking for something for my kids' egg and dairy allergies, so I rolled the short way for bigger rolls. They didn't rise as much as I was hoping, which may be because of the yeast being mixed with the dry goods instead of on its own with water to activate. Still turned out better than the store bought ones we had a couple of weeks ago, and may still give this a shot with tweaks like adding the yeast to water first, and cutting the milk in half to make up for the extra liquid. Also, waited on preheating the oven, since I didn't want it sitting on for 60+ min.
