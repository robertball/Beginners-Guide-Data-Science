When a friend of mine who had lived in Italy for 2 years had a slice of this, he immediately asked for the recipe!  Thanks for making me look skilled in the kitchen.  I didn't have all the individual spices so I added 4 tsp Italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp garlic powder instead.  I used olive oil in place of the butter for a more Italian flavor, added 5 Tbsp grated Parmesan instead of 3, and reduced the yeast to 2 tsp.  ALSO, I noticed several comments about the bread falling.  When using cheese in automatic bread machines, be sure that it is mild.  Sharp cheese can cause the dough to rise too quickly and then collapse due to the enzymes that some sharp cheeses contain.  Hope this helps!

This is a wonderful recipe for bread. I don't use a bread machine and was worried it wouldn't work. It turned out great! The only part of the recipe I changed a bit was the seasonings. I had to use what I could find at the grocery store. It's wonderful just to snack on. My toddler son even loved it! (making the bread the "old fashioned way" I used all purpose flour and set it in a greased bowl in a warm spot, left to rise for about 45 minutes, kneeded it for about 5 min. Then put them in greased (shortening) pan. (I used mini loaf pans) and let rise for about 30 minutes. It ony took about 20 minutes to bake. ( I kept checking)

Great bread recipe! My husband couldn't stop raving about it! I think he may have enjoyed it somewhat, since I made this recipe into 10 dinner rolls, and he ate five of them! Instead of butter, I used two tablespoons of garlic flavored olive oil. Left out marjoram and used fresh rosemary from the herb garden.Mmmm Good.

I used all-purpose flour, regular milk, 1 tablespoon of margarine and 1 tablespoon of olive oil, about 5 tablespoons of 3 cheese blend (parmesan, asiago, and romano), a tablespoon or so of Italian seasoning, a few good shakes of garlic powder, and just under a tablespoon of yeast. I don't have a bread machine, so I mixed it with the stand mixer using the dough hooks. Then I kneaded it for 6 or 7 minutes and put it in an oiled bowl to rise until doubled in size. After it doubled, I punched it down and put it back in the bowl to rise a little more. 20 minutes or so later I put it on a lightly greased baking sheet, forming it into a French bread-shape. I baked it at 350 degrees for 30 or 35 minutes until it was a lovely golden color. It needs more seasoning and cheese, but I did alter the recipe a lot. I'll play with it some more so it's more to my family's taste, maybe add some olives. :) It turned out pretty yummy though! Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a recipe for herbed pull-apart bread when I came across this one and figured it could be adapted for my purposes.  I did use the italian seasonings with the basil and a T. of  garlic powder.  Set the machine for the dough cycle and made balls of the dough when it was ready.  I rolled the balls in a stick of melted butter with a little garlic powder mixed in and placed about 5 dough balls in each of 24 muffin cups, sprinkled with the remaining butter and some more parmesan.  They were terrific.  A dozen are going to work for a bake sale and the rest (what there are!) stay here.  My bread machine will make a 2# loaf, so I will try to scale it up to make a few more rolls next time.  Thanks.

Great bread! I used fresh herbs and it was wonderful. I used the dough cycle only on the bread machine- took dough out, let rest for 10 minutes then lightly kneaded a few times in olive oil. Put bread in loaf pan- let rise until double in size. Bake at 350 for 40 minutes. Yummy!!!!

This bread tastes really great, but I wouldn't recommend baking it in a breadmaker.  Just like a previous reviewer, mine fluffed so vigorously it stuck to the inside lid, and half of this yummy loaf was scraped off into the sink!  Take the extra time and do this one by hand, and add a little rosemary and Italian seasoning.  Very tasty!

This was a family favorite!  Simple, flavorful, and extraordinarily fluffy.  I'll probably use a little less yeast in future as the bread grew until it pressed the top of the machine, but keeping everyone on tiptoes and out of the kitchen prevented any falling, so the end product had a wonderful airy texture.  I also added garlic (1 teaspoon) and substituted Romano cheese (4 tablespoons for even more flavor) for Parmesan.  Went perfectly with tomato basil soup and club sandwiches!

A really delicious bread.  I used fresh milk rather than the dry milk powder, and went with another reviewer's suggestion and used 3 tsp of Italian seasonings.  It smelled wonderful when baking, and tasted great!

The first time I made this, I didn't like it at all.  But maybe my my taste budds has changed a little...  everyone in my family including my 8 yrs old daughter and her friend LOVED it!!  I used olive oil since I thought it's a little healthier.  I didn't really taste any of cheese.  I may increase the cheese to 5Tbsp as others suggested for the next time.

I do not have a bread machine so I had to do it the old fashioned way.  I added a large clove of garlic (minced), increased Parmesan cheese to 1/4 cup and added 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning.  Cooked at 350 degrease for 40 minutes and it turned out perfect.  It was a little too salty (probably due to the extra cheese) so I will cut the salt in half next time.  Otherwise it was just delicious!  Family loved it!

Thanks for sharing this great recipe!  I added a little of garlic powder to this. Even my finicky two-year-old loved this!  He ate four pieces all by himself.  Definitely will be making this again.

Good flaver, but my top fell also each time I made it.It is great tasting but it is too bad when it falls, makes the loaf seem small.

Familiar with basic bread recipes, and given the benefit of other reviewers, I made some adjustments on this recipe. It's a delicious bread, but it still could use some tweaking in the measurements. Even reducing the sugar and yeast to two tsp. each, this still rose more than I would have liked and wasn't as dense as I prefer.  This was very light and fluffy. I used a small handful of fresh chopped herbs over the dried--parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme and oregano. I also substituted olive oil for the butter. While not a perfect recipe, this was the perfect bread for our grilled cheese sandwiches!

I made this bread twice. The  first time I put all ingredients into my Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer in order that was given. I baked it in the oven and it ws good but almost like a foccachia bread. The next day I tried again and dissolved the yeast in the water and made it like I would a regular receipe for the mixer. I made the dough in the morning and brought it to friends that evening and baked it there. It was the best bread I ever had!!My friends and husband agreed. Will make often.

I made the recipe exactly as it said and it turned out great.  The bread has a gourmet taste and seems like something that someone slaved over.  It wasn't as cheesy as I thought, but it was still great.

I substituted the marjoram for garlic powder and used real milk instead of powdered milk.  All of the bread I have made in the past did not turn out for me but this one did and truly tastes awesome!!  I have made this many times and my friends enjoy this one.

This bread is so delicious. My whole family loved it...even my picky 4 year old.  I left out the marjoram (forgot to buy it at the store and was not going back with two little ones!), added some extra parmesan, and added some garlic.  It was so good...I will definitely be making this bread again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

yum!  I used Italian seasoning instead of all the herbs seperately, and added onion and garlic. I also used only 2 tsp of yeast and the bread turned out perfectly in my bread machine.  The whole loaf disappeared immediately!

This bread makes a MEAN ham sandwich! It is super crispy when toasted.  My family loves it! Great with Roma Tomatoes, Feta Cheese and fresh basil on top.  Best recipe I've found so far! I Use a little less yeast, don't double the fresh herbs, and use more cheese.

FANTASTIC! I had no problems with this recipe-it was fluffy, and crispy on the outside. I wish i could have tasted my spices more, so next time i'll make it a little stronger, but still-5 stars!

This is excellent toasted and smothered with butter alongside a pasta dinner!  My husband could eat the whole loaf himself if I'd let him!!!

Best bread I've ever made, the smell and the taste, yum. But for my bread machine 1 tablespoon dried yeast is way to much. 2 teaspoons at the most.

This bread was delicious! After baking I noticed that it had a very nice crust and
was just the right texture. I was thinking
of adding a little garlic to it as well
next time when I try it.

This bread was absolutely delicious!  I didn't have any thyme in the house, so I skipped it and the bread still tasted wonderful.  This recipe is a definitely keeper!

To make it healthier, I substituted one cup of flour with whole wheat flour, and oil instead of the margarine.  It worked!

I have made this bread dozens of times over the last year and half and without fail it is one of our favorites. The original recipe yields a great bread, but I often adjust it depending on what we need. The first time I made it I was new to making my own bread and I didn't knead it long enough, the bread still tasted ok, but it didn't rise into a nice fluffy chewy loaf!  Since then, I've experimented a lot, sometimes leaving out all the spices for a simpler white bread. I've also left out the parmesan when i don't have it on hand and it's still great.  I have found that when i use bread flour, i get an even more chewy texture which we love. I also always add reg. milk instead of powdered, as i never have that on hand. Usually i divide the dough into two smaller balls and bake them on a cookie sheet.  Sometime I double the recipe, divide it into four balls and freeze the dough in a zip lock baggie.  I can just take it out the morning i want to bake it and let it rise/defrost.  I love serving this bread to company because everyone is always so impressed that I made it, it’s so good!  I hope you try this bread, you won't be disappointed!

Amazing bread! Followed some other posters suggestions:  2T basil olive oil, 4t Italian seasoning, 1t minced garlic, 4T parmesan cheese-used just the dough cycle and baked for 35 minutes in the oven after the second rise.  This would make an amazing pizza crust too!

This bread is fantastic! I'm new at using a bread machine, and this turned out perfectly for me. I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and made a few tweaks:  I reduced the yeast to 2 tsp. and the bread rose almost, but not quite, to the top of the bread machine (no mess). I substituted olive oil for butter, increased the Parmesan to 5 tbs. and added about a teaspoon of powdered garlic. I didn't have any marjoram on hand, so I substituted rosemary, which worked great. The aroma while baking was almost irresistible, and I had to sample a slice while it was still hot. As others have said, it tastes quite a lot like the bread at Macaroni Grill. It's perfect for dipping into EVOO with freshly-ground pepper, and makes a great accompaniment to pasta dishes. This is definitely the best bread I've made so far, and I'm sure I'll continue to make it on a regular basis.

Good recipe.  I made the dough in the bread machine and baked in mini loaf pans.  I added rosemary, garlic and extra cheese and omitted the dry milk.

This went beautifully with our Italian dinner last evening. I don't have a bread machine, so I did it the old fashioned way, using my Kitchen Aid mixer and kneading. I used a quarter cup of parm and added a tablespoon of garlic and onion powders. Delicious with garlic butter! Thanks so much!

This bread machine recipe is a great one! Here are the few changes that I made: I used olive oil (2 T.) instead of butter, increased the Parmesan to 5 T., & used only 2 tsp. of yeast - perfect...moist and delicious! (Oh, and I just used the powdered-type Parmesan that you would use on pasta or pizza).

I hand-kneaded this bread, since I'm not really into the bread machine thingy... Didnt use as much water - just kept on adding water bit by bit til the dough was elastic but not overly sticky, the bread turned out wonderful!! Shreded old cheese (don't know what type), mixed it with italian herbs and 1-2 tbs flour and patted it on top of the bread. Looked wonderful!

This is great! I omited the milk powder, used 2 tsp of yeast, and used a lot of Italian seasonings. I also added fresh minced garlic. My husband added too much yeast once and the bread looked like an inside out mountain, so you really do have to be careful of how much you use. This recipe does work on the basic rapid cycle.

I don't have a breadmaker and I could still pull this off successfully! Yeah!! Thanks to others, I added some minced garlic, 1/2 tsp of onion/garlic powders, a pinch of crushed rosemary and 1/2 tsp of Italian seasonings. I also upped the parm to 1/3c. After letting the dough rise for 1.5 hours, I rolled into a large rectangle and using a pizza cutter, made these into breadsticks. Baked at 350 for about 12 minutes, removed them and added some butter and baked again until they were lightly brown. These were wonderful and I will make these again...perhaps I'll try the loaf thing but these were breadsticks were great with our steak dinner! Thanks!

This recipe is AWESOME. Made it in the bread maker and hubby and Grandma in Law couldn't stay out of the kitchen for waiting to see how much longer was left.  Is a bit on the strong side for those that don't like the robust flavors of all the spices.  I would advise adding a tablespoon of garlic powder to your dry mix and some minced during the add in cycle of the bread maker. (We like garlic) Would make great cheesy bread toasted in the oven or broiler. I have found that I only like this toasted with butter, something about it untoasted doesn't do it for us.  I got this from the recipe book. Yum :)

This bread warm from the oven with a pat of butter is one of the best things I have ever tasted.  I set my bread machine to dough and then made the dough into about 10 rolls.  Baked half and froze half, and the ones that had been frozen were just as good a few days later.

Great recipe! I baked this bread by using my hands. Followed others suggestion, I used only 2 tsp of yeast and added some fresh minced garlic. The bread is so soft and smell so nice! Finished the whole loaf during breakfast! Will bake more this week!

I adapted the recipe for the oven. I followed the recipe as written, then allowed it to rise in a well oiled bowl until doubled in size. I punched it down and divided into 3 portions, making a "rope" from each. Pinching the ends together, I braided the "ropes", tucking the pinched ends underneath. Let rise again until doubled, applied egg wash and baked at 350 on a preheated pizza stone. I also sprayed water on the sides of the oven at the beginning and about halfway thru to add moisture to the air. If you look at "other photos" you can see the result. Wonderful aroma, wonderful taste.

Delicious! This was the best bread I've made yet. Definitely need to use less yeast, though, it did reach the top of my machine and then cave in. I used fresh herbs from my garden.

This bread is delicious!  I use fresh herbs from my garden (basil, rosemary & thyme).  It turned out beautifully and the house smelled divine while it was baking.

Yummy!  Will definitely make again, but will decrease yeast to 2 tsp. as it rose too high in the bread machine and then fell.  Has anyone tried the delay timer on their bread machine?  I would like to use the delay timer, but the water then would not be warm as called for.  Would it really make a difference??

I made this in the breadmachine on dough only cycle.  I was making it to go along with a lasagna dinner party I was going to.  I read some of the other reviews about the loaf being so big in the breadmachine so I made them into breadsticks.  I just made 3 breadsticks and threw them in the toaster oven to see if I would serve them.  They were fantastic. 350 degrees for about ten minutes.  I can't wait to see everyone elses reaction tonight.  I think I will brush then with some melted garlic butter before serving. Yummy. Thank You.

Last time I omitted the parmesan and added 3 Tbsp of fresh minced onion.  I make this recipe into 10 hamburger buns.  I sprinkle about 1 Tbsp of grated cheddar on top before baking.  Great recipe.  The variations are almost endless.  Thanks.

I make this as a regular loaf and add garlic powder. If the loaf sits for more than a couple days, I cube it up and dry in oven to make herb croutons. They come out great!

I made this as written, in the bread machine.  Turned out well, although top did cave in a little.  Could've been my fault bc i messed up hte timer function and it was ready earlier than i expected.  very flavorful, and served as toast with eggs today.

I don't have a bread machine so made this by hand. I didn't use quite as much water and didn't have any powdered milk so used 2T of milk. I kneaded it for about 10 minutes and put it in a warm place to double in size which took about an hour. Cooked for about 40 mins. It smelt wonderful and disappeared very quickly. Thanks.

This bread is good.. I've made it a couple of times already.  But, for some reason it always falls.  I cut down the yeast to 2 teaspoons.  So I can't figure out what the problem is.

I added l tsp. garlic powder and cut the yeast
back to a 'scant' 2 tsp.  It was touching the lid
of my bread machine as it was.  Next day, I used
it toasted as a base for Bruschetta and it was
excellent.

I only used 2 teaspoons of yeast (1 Tbl. seemed like a lot) and it came out excellent! We made it into garlic bread (heat up the broiler pan in the oven, mixed up some butter, parmesan, garlic, salt & pepper....spread it on a few slices..popped them in the oven on broil until they got brown, and sprinkled them with some shredded colby cheese till it melted) So good served with spaghetti!! You'll want it all the time.

While this recipe is super tasty, the loaf grows so much it's like something out of science fiction. I guess the only option would be to cut back on the yeast just a little? However, I'm afraid to do anything because the texture is so perfect as is, even if you have to scrape half the loaf off the top of the breadmaker.

This is a very tasty bread! I substituted regular milk for the dry milk, no problems. I also added more parmesean cheese, and reduced yeast to 2tsp. This bread recipe is definately a favorite in my recipe box. Thanks!

I tried this recipe a number of times in my bread machine.  My first time was a catastrophe--the bread looked like it was going to be wonderful--nice a full and plump.  But then just as it started baking, it fell,... and fell...  and fell.  I was embarrassed to serve it.  I thought no one would believe how much it fell, so I measured--it was nearly 2 inches down in the center from the sides.  After reading about troubleshooting, I tried, instead of 1tbsp of yeast (as the recipe says), using 1 tsp (1/3 as much) yeast.  (I always use Fleishmann's Rapid Rise yeast).  This worked very well.  It did shrivel a little during baking, but no collapse at all.  Just to be sure that this wasn't coincidental I made a THIRD loaf, but again using 1 tbsp yeast.  Collapsed catastropically again!  So for sure 1 tbsp of Rapid Rise is way too much.  Why did this recipe work so well for so many other people?  My suspicion is that most people either used Active Dry (rather than Rapid Rise) or else they didn't use the full 1 tbsp that the recipe specifies.

Really nice bread!  I don't have a bread machine, so made it in the KA with the dough hook.  I also had no dry milk, so I used 1 c. warm water and 1/4 c. milk.  I probably added closer to 1/4 c. Parm.  This turned out really good with our chicken pasta - the kids couldn't get enough.  Thanks!  Comes together quick and easy.  I made one loaf and baked it at 350 for about 32 minutes.

Wow, so good!  I did a 1 lb loaf and replaced half the flour with whole wheat flour, and also added 1 oz shredded Asiago.  I also did Olive Oil in place of butter.  It came out perfect.  Smells amazing!

Wonderful!  I've been making this recipe for over a year with the following modifications: I use fresh milk, and either reduce water by that amount or add a little extra flour. I reduce yeast to 2 tsp so my loaf isn't HUGE. I replace butter with olive oil, use 1/4 cup parm. cheese, 3 tsp Italian seasoning, and 1 tsp garlic powder.  I serve with olive oil, parm. cheese, and black pepper.

Another excellent bread! I asked my husband "what do you think" and he replied" tastes just like the bread I had yesterday at Macaroni Grill". Cooked perfectly. I used way more basil, fresh & dried. Only used 2 1/2 teaspoons yeast. Thanks!

Flopped in my bread machine for some reason.  Only had ground marjoram and ground thyme so they made the bread a greenish color.  Too chewy for me and I couldn't taste the cheese at all.

Smelled like pizza as it was baking! Maybe I will add some chopped pepperoni next time. Used 2 tb of olive oil instead of butter and changed it to 2 tsp of rapid rise yeast. The bread was HUGE! But tasted great. Kept herbs as is and could have even used more. Made an oil to dip in with marjoram, sea salt and garlic power.

I made this bread for a meal we hosted tonight and got lots of positive comments about it. It made the house smell wonderful, too, as people arrived! I did modify the recipe as per suggestions from other reviewers: decreased the herbs by about a third, increased the Parmesan cheese to 4 T., and decreased the yeast to 2 t. My bread didn't fall, and it didn't stick to the top of the bread machine. I also made an olive oil-herb dipping sauce that complemented the bread wonderfully! I look forward to making this again.

We loved this bread.  The cheese and herbs gave it a nice subtle flavour.  I didn't have marjarom, so I used rosemary instead.  I liked the flavour and texture of this bread so much that I decided to make it again without any cheese or herbs.  It made an exceptionally good white bread.  Thanks for the recipe.  It is definately a keeper.

I've made this a bunch of times; though it does sometimes fall as others have mentioned, it's incredibly yummy.  I generally use Locatelli Romano cheese instead of parmesan, and today I tried 2 tsp. of yeast instead of a tablespoon as several people recommended, and it didn't fall.

This bread smelled soooo good but unfortunately it FLOPPED - literally!  It looked pathetic when it was done.  I think it was way too much yeast/not enough water.  But I will try it again.....

Turned out perfect in my bread machine.  The fragrance while it is baking is great and the taste is delicious.

Delicious, but presentation was lacking since it fell. Also, it was very wet during the mixing cycle so I added more flour. Don't know if that's why. 2nd time used less water, more flour.  YUMMY!

I also used fresh herbs for this loaf and it turned out terrific!  It really gets a rave review at my house and is well worth trying.

Not sure how kids like this, but everyone I've given it to wants more!!  I usually at least double the amount of cheese, and I use freshly grated.  I've also made this with Romano cheese.  Both the Romano and Parmesan are huge hits and I've e-mailed this to several friends.  Thanks for sharing it!!

Very flavorful bread with good texture.  Followed recipe exactly this time, but think I'll try more parmeson next time and maybe a little garlic, although original is wonderful.  Ginger

This bread is fantastic! My husband loves it; I don't know how many times he has requested it. We serve it with olive oil dipping sauce... better than any Italian restaurant.

You might want to cut back on the yeast slightly. When I follow the measurements exactly, the bread over-rises about 80% of the time.

Excellent Bread. I didn't have any milk powder so I replaced 1/4 cup of water for skim milk.  Unfortunatley I ran out of marjoram but I'm sure with that addition this bread would be even better.

Great flavor!  I didn't have marjoram so I just skipped it; I also added an extra tbsp or so of Parmesan.  I would also consider the recipe for buns or rolls; just run in bread machine on dough setting and form into rolls, let rise for 20-30 minutes and bake.

Amazing bread!! IF it lasts long enough for sandwiches, cheese (hard cheddar), pickles, and romaine lettuce, wow.....  I did like others and used 2 teaspoons yeast, but didn't see where it rose too much so may try a tablespoon next time/  I did use olive oil instead of butter, and I added FRESH rosemary in addition to the dried herbs listed.  I also used 5 tablespoons of parmesan; two tablespoons were a flavored parmesan. Smelled heavenly while baking!!  This bread barely made it through the day.  I see this as a regular.  I like how some made rolls with it.  I think croutons and stuffing could also be made with this bread (especially if the rosemary is added; Thanksgiving in mind here).  I HIGHLY recommend this bread!!

This bread was delicious with a few adjustments. As others recommended, I reduced the amount of yeast by 1/3, and the bread still maxed out my machine. I'll use even less the next time. I used more parmesan cheese than was recommended and used fresh rosemary, Italian parsley and oregano from my garden. This was delicious served with  fettucini alfredo.

I have had great success with this bread.  I did make some changes in the herbs, used only the ones I liked @ 1tsp ea, left out the powdered milk and used fresh shredded italian mixed cheeses, 1/3 cup.  Mixed in my mixer, left to rise, punched down, shaped and rose 2nd time in a loaf pan.  Baked at 350 for 22 to 25 min and it came out wonderful.  Aroma is very sensual, taste delicious, texture very nice and proofs well.  Bake this every week.  Have baked in a bundt pan, it looks as beautiful as it tastes.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a favorite here.

This is a wonderful bread full of flavor.  I made it for the first time a couple of days ago.  I also made some bruchetta, toasted the bread and topped it.  Wonderful!  I'm sure this would make a great panini too.

Wonderful bread!  Such a great aroma.  I made exactly as written and loved it but gave four stars because it hit the top of my machine and even oozed out the sides a bit.  I've never used more than two tsp. of yeast in my machine and was hesitant but wanted to follow the recipe exactly the first time.  Made a second loaf with two teaspoons yeast, 1 tablespoon of sugar instead of two and used 2 cups unbleached all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat.  Turned out perfect.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I subbed 3 tea. Italian Seasoning (instead of using the called for marjoram, thyme, basil and oregano) and the bread came out great.  DH said it tasted like Macaroni Grill's bread.  Mine caved in, but I've read that is due to too much moisture in the loaf.  The dough did seem rather wet, so next time I will reduce the water to 1 cup and see what happens.  Otherwise, this was a great tasting loaf and DH toasted a slice and made a deli sandwich with it that is amazing!

I was looking for a recipe to resemble The Macaroni Grill's Foccacia, but made in a bread machine, and this is it!  The only change I made was to add 3 Tbs of Romano cheese as well.  Excellent bread recipe!

The bread was good, thanks for sharing the recipe.  However, when I make it again I think I may use half the listed quantity of herbs.  It was a little too strong for my taste.

This bread came out terrific!  I didn't use the milk powder or the marjoram, and I used two tablespoons of olive oil in place of butter.  I also added some garlic powder.  When it was finished, it had a soft, chewy texture and a nice brown crust.  Delicious, and, as a bonus, it made my entire house smell wonderful.

Excellent bread and I screwed up the recipe.  As I was putting the ingredients together I realized I did not have dry milk powder.  Then I found out that I ran out of basil.  I decided since I had everything else in the machine already, I may as well make it.  It came out great and tasted wonderful.  I can't wait to make it again but with all the ingredients next time.  I served it with the baked ziti I from this site and it was delicious.

Bread was fairly good but it looked terrible when it fell, can´t figure out what I did wrong, but I guess, from other reviews, that it happens to all. Won´t be making it again, at least not for company.

This is a great bread, but it's even better as breadsticks!  I'm a garlic fiend, so I added quite a lot of minced garlic along with everything else.  I also reduced the yeast to 2 teaspoons.

Great Recipe, even my kids ate it. I didn't have bread flour or dry milk, so I just used reg. flour and it turned out perfectly! I added more cheese and garlic salt and italian blend seasonings.

I baked the bread in my bread machine, and it smelled really, really good. I skipped dry milk, and I modified the recipe as recommended by the previous reviewers. However, my bread turned out a little sour instead of being cheezy. The cheese was melted into the dough and turned the loaf too sour. Maybe I did something wrong, but I won't make this bread again.

I love this bread! I modified it the second time I made it . . . I used regular flour instead of bread flour, and it turned out much lighter.  I served it to friends with lasagna this weekend, and they raved over the bread.

Delicious! I formed into breadsticks. Served one night with a beef tenderloin dinner and the following evening with beef barley soup. I will make croutons from the few remaining breadsticks that are starting to get stale.

Made this bread again.  Absolutely delicious!!  But again, it sunk in the middle.  I did not open the bread machine and followed directions, but still it sunk.  Any ideas why?  My girls are picky eaters and they requested this bread again!

LOVE this bread!  I've made it many, many times.  I first made it in my bread machine, but I always had problems with it rising too high and sticking to the lid.  Then I started making it like any other bread loaf.  It turns out wonderfully.  I mix and knead it with my stand mixer, let it rise till double, turn into a loaf pan, let rise again, then bake.  Perfect every time. :)

4 stars for flavor - not 5, because mine fell, too! I read all the conflicting reviews, so decided to try it as written (since so many had excellent results). I'm not one of them - mine is 1/2 the height it should be, and very dense. But my parrot & I are really enjoying the flavor - on our 2nd pieces now! I will try again...No loaf will ever go to waste, it can always be made into croutons or crumbs ...

In the past week, I have made this bread 3 times because everyone just loves it and requests this bread.  I did brush the top with melted garlic butter when it came out of the oven and it just pushed the flavor and scent sensation over the top.

a beautiful tasting bread, i altered it a little though by using 2 cups wholemeal flour and just the one cup white flour and replaced the butter with olive oil as i prefer my breads healthier, also i substituted half the water for milk as i had run out of powdered milk, i used chedder cheese and upped it to about four Tbsp, i also only used one and a half tsp of yeast and it came out perfect. all in all a very tasty bread...this recipes definitely a keeper.

Delicious, but yields a very soft loaf - better suited for rolls I think.  It rose well in my bread machine, but fell during baking and the end product is difficult to slice thinly (too soft).  I made as written except for substituting a lesser amount of tarragon for the marjoram.  Next time I would cut back on the total amount of spice because the bread takes center stage with so much spice.

I've made this recipe twice now & it's so easy, not to mention delicious. I followed the ingredients list almost exactly, I didn't have any dried basil on hand, so I opted for a little more oregano. No big deal. This bread still turned out perfectly, and I loved that the herb flavor wasn't over-powering, nor would I consider it bland.   Paired with a heart stew, the flavor is lovely. Or we've even been microwaving it with butter as a quick, but filling snack.   Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This is a nice, savory bread.  After seeing other reviews about the bread rising too high, I scaled back the yeast.  I used 1 tsp. instead of 1 tbsp.  It worked well.  I might try it with 1 1/2 tsp. next time- I think that would be perfect.  I only had dried herbs.  This would be SO much better with fresh herbs!  I might add an extra tablespoon of parmesan cheese next time.

I'm giving this 3 stars because I just pulled this out of my machine and the middle has sunken in and it just looks terrible... smells WONDERFUL... but looks like a disaster.  I'm going to attempt this recipe again in a few days once I turn this loaf into some texas toast.  I'll update in a few days...

I made this bread in the breadmaker - followed the directions to a T - and for some reason the top completely caved in!  It was perfectly fine until it had about 30 minutes left and the top fell.  However, it still tasted really good and I got many compliments on it!  I just cut it up before serving it so my guests didn't see what it looked like. ;)

This was a snap to assemble. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer from beginning to end, as I'm not one that has a bread maker. I had to add one more tbsp. of flour to get the bread to jump on the bread hook, but other than that, I made no changes. It's rising in the bread pan now, so I'll update how the family liked it after dinner. Just for ease and smell, it deserves five stars.

It rose way too high in the bread machine so it collapsed near the end of the bake cycle. Great tasting bread though, just use less yeast next time.

This bread is delicious, my family - even my kids - just love this bread! I agree with the others who have recommended reducing the yeast to one packet or 2 tsp. I think I read the recipe wrong the first time and added less yeast than written and it came out fine; second and third time I read it correctly and had a huge rise then deep collapse, which resulted in tasty but very oddly shaped bread. 

I use fresh herbs out of my garden, chopped in the mini food processor. I usually do 1TB rosemary, 1TB thyme, 2 tsp oregano, 2 tsp basil. The choice of herbs can easily be changed to suit your meal, as long as the total amount of fresh herbs comes to  3TB+1tsp.

MMMM! Eating a warm slice of this right now.... Perfect as is, but my personal little changes would include adding a little more parmesan and a little garlic powder. Also, I have a small bread machine so this load was too big (it stuck to the top of my bread machine!). I'll make a smaller one next time... Also, could add some chunks of cheese too. This tastes just like the "Subway Italian Herb and Cheese" bread... Very good. Nice to change up from a plain white loaf. Will make again for sure!

I really like the taste of this bread, the herbs are great! But...it was super sticky and wet! I will definitely decrease the amount of water next time I try to shape and bake in the oven. Maybe it would be okay baked in the bread machine as is, without decreasing the water?  I think I will definitely try both ways. Thanks for the great recipe!

Using the advice of others, I did use less yeast as I set mine on a timer, so I used 1 packet that = 2 1/4 tsp. It came out fine!!

I don't know what I did wrong, but the bread caved in my bread machine. Looks like other reviewers had similar problems too. Smelled AWESOME while baking, but the taste just doesn't match the smell. Not sure how to make it better, so I probably won't make it again.

GREAT recipe!  I made it three times within a week. This is a definite keeper. I didn't use majoram, because I didn't have any, and wouldn't make it any other way. It's perfect!

Excellent!! I was hard up for spices so I used 4-5 tsp of Italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp garlic powder and it worked great!! My kitchen never smelled so good. Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first attempt at making bread, it turned out well, just a little bland for my tastes.  I followed previous advice and only used 2 tsp of yeast, I also added garlic and fresh rosemary, and used olive oil instead of butter.  Nice texture and crust, needs more flavour.

This bread smelled awesome and tasted as good as it smelled. I wanted to make it without my breadmaker, and since my mom and I were the only ones home at the time I halved the recipe and made it by hand. I formed it into a ball and baked it on a cookie sheet at 350 for about 25 minutes and it came out perfect.

This was amazing!  I made a few changes, used grated Romano cheese because that's what I had and added about the same amount of old cheddar cheese too, I omitted the marjoram & oregano but added sage, crushed red pepper flakes & chunks of fresh garlic.  The house smelled awesome and the bread tasted great!

I followed several other suggestions from the reviews.  I added some garlic powder and substituted olive oil for the margarine.  I also divided the dough and made 2 round loaves, baked at 450 for 8-10 minutes.  Our favorite Italian resturant in town serves bread very similar to this.  It was wonderful.  I will definitely make this again.

Amazing bread.  Use fresh herbs if you can. I added a little mozzerella cheese because I ran out of parmesan while cooking.  Garlic too!  THE BEST I've made in the breadmaker to date.

I used dried herbs instead of fresh, in the amounts listed, and found it the taste to be too strong. If using dried herbs, I'd reduce the amount called for here and use a little more cheese. That would add another star to the ratings for me.

This was very good.  I usually don't have much luck with yeast bread recipes.  Made 2 mini loaves and several breadsticks.  The whole family liked it!!  Put leftover slices under the broiler the next day with a little butter and shredded cheese.   Yummy!

Not sure what I did wrong, but my goodness, these were gross.  I made them as breadsticks, they were dry and flavorless.  I don't think I could be convinced to make them as a loaf, but after all the good reviews, I;m wondering if I did something wrong.

Thanks for this wonderful recipe. Made it twice in the bread machine and once as small loaves in the oven. Turned out great every time. 
I used 2Tbs Olive oil and 4tsps of Italian seasoning as suggested by other reviewers. Was concerned about bread rising too much  with 1Tbsp yeast..but this was not an issue.
This really ends my search for a herb bread recipe.

I have made this several times. Usually to the recipe, but I’ve been known to switch butter for olive oil, or switch out herbs to complement what I’m preparing for dinner. If I double and make a few loaves, I use it for sammiches. This bread makes one of the best grilled cheese I have ever had. It’s also great for eggs and toast. One of my kids uses it for peanut butter and raves about it, but I can’t bring myself to attempt that. I don’t have a bread machine, so it’s all kitchen aid and oven for me, but this makes a great solid loaf that holds up well to thin slicing. It would definitely work great if you were the creative sort that likes to make the cookie cutter sandwiches. If you’re looking for light and airy and fluffy, keep looking. If your looking for one that has great flavor and holds up well for almost paper thin slices, you’ve found your recipe. Thank you for the recipe. It’s great as written, but also has a great base for playing around with different flavor combos. It also holds its shape well after cutting when making it as a braid. So many breads look great braided, but decimate when you try to slice it. This is a solid recipe!

This is great, the kitchen smelled wonderful while it baked. I use the bread machine for making dough and bake in the oven.  Since I don't keep the individual spices, I used Italian seasoning mix. This recipe is a keeper.
Addendum: This was great right out of the oven, but it's even better the second day. Thank you!

I added more parmesan cheese than the recipe called for; probably more like 6 tablespoons. I also made it into 15 dinner rolls instead of a loaf of bread. I baked them for about 30 minutes. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I brushed some melted butter on the tops of the rolls after taking them out of the oven. Great recipe, and easy to make.

This was delish!! This is the first bread I have made that wasn't your typical white boring :) I screwed up and added a little too much oregano.. but it was good regardless. My husband is still drooling, I think.

Thank you!

I substituted 11/2cups sourdough starter and 1/4 cup buttermilk for the liquid . In addition as one reviewer suggested, I included rosemary. The modest amount of rosemary imparted a bitter finish to the breads flavor. 
In saying that, the quality of the bread/buns was very nice. I will use this recipe again minus the incorporated rosemary. All in all a user friendly and nice recipe. Thanks!

I melded this recipe with the "Best Bread Machine Bread" recipe by SHECOOKS2, tweaked, and came out with a perfect loaf of bread. 

My tweaks: One cup of water, substituted two Tbls of olive oil for the butter.  2 Tbls granulated sugar, and, per another reviewer's recommendations, I added 1 1/2 tsp of salt to be in correct balance with the amount of flour in the recipe. Two Tbls non-fat milk powder, 1 tsp each Rosemary, Thyme, Basil, and Oregano, approx 1/4 c Mozzarella cheese. 3 c. bread flour. 2 1/4 tsp bread machine yeast. Set for basic 1 1/2 lb white w/light crust. PERFECTION!

Help! I made a loaf in my Hamilton Beach Bread machine.  The top collapsed. I was able to trim it off and it tastes great, but without the top crust, it won't stay together.

I put it in the with bread for stuffing.

Any ideas why if fell, and how to keep it from doing it again.

Instead of all the separate herbs I added Italian seasoning and some pesto.  Smelled divine and tastes fabulous!

Very tasty and best served with a little plate of olive oil to dip (instead of butter). I did not put in enough yeast the first time (used one packet, which I think is 1.5 tsp) and it was really dense. I'll definitely read it more carefully and use the correct amount next time. Excellent bread that we sliced and served for Easter dinner (brisket).

I made this recipe incorporating some of the suggestions from other cooks.  I increased the cheese (extra strong provolone) to 5 Tblsp (and probably could have used even more), used 2 Tblsp Italian Seasoning, added 1 Tblsp of granulated garlic, and olive oil instead of butter.  I chose to use the dough setting on my bread machine;  I divided the dough into 12 buns and baked them at 350*F for 22 minutes.  They were FANTASTIC.  My husband ate 3 with dinner and is already planning on having a cheese sandwich for lunch tomorrow using one of the rolls.  We both loved these---thank you!!!

Could be cheesier...but it was tasty and a good texture.  I ended up adding a little bit of cheddar to it, but should have added more!  I didn't have marjarom so skipped that, but added a little bit of dried minced onions...just cause it sounded good at the time.  The only other adjustment I made was using a tiny bit less yeast, since several reviewers said it rose too much in their bread machines.  Mine was just right!  I'll use this recipe again and play around with the flavors a bit to see what else works well.

Tasted great, soft and chewy texture but I didn't taste any parmesan. Planning to change the cheese to something else instead. Changes I made: increased parmesan to around 5 tablespoons; used vegetable oil instead of butter; switched herbs to 1 teaspoon each of Italian seasoning, basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary; and reduced yeast to 1 1/2 teaspoons. 1 tablespoon of yeast is too much for a bread machine!

Delicious bread!! I made a double recipe (using the kitchen aid mixer) and baked it in casserole dishes for round and crusty loaves. Made it for supper last night and used the leftovers for egg sandwiches this morn! So good! There is only one piece left, and I when I was mixing up more this morning, I realized that last night I had put in double the amount of butter that was called for, but it turned out beautiful anyway.

Reviewers warned that it rises a great deal (one tablespoon yeast -yikes), so I used the dough cycle and made three mini loaves.  They still puffed up large!  Baked at 375 for 35 minutes.  Yummy.  Went perfect with the pot roast dinner.  For more chessy taste, try using freshly grated parmesan in recipe then sprinkle with cheese last 10 minutes of baking.

Really good. I added minced up dried tomatoes. Made in the breadmaker and the top did cave it. But it was really good, so we didn't care. Thanks!

This bread is SO good!  The only thing I did differently was add the herbs to taste, which is what I always do with every recipe, but I only added the herbs listed here.  It was fantastic!  My family ate the whole loaf at dinner and asked me to make another loaf the next day!

This wasn't quite what I was looking for, but it was still good. There wasn't nearly enough cheese flavor in it, and I had added 2 tbsp of extra cheese.

I LOVED this bread!  I didn't have any dry milk powder so I used powdered buttermilk.  Also added 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  The ratio of dry to wet ingredients was perfect.  Oh, I only used 2 tsp of yeast though.  I will definitely make this again.

Great bread!  I did increase the cheese to 1/3 cup and all herbs to 1 1/2 tsp.  This bread makes an excellent grilled cheese - spread bread with marinara sauce and add mozzerlla cheese then grill.  Has become a regular in our household.  Also good spread with cream cheese.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Fantastic! I served this with spinach artichoke dip. I read the reviews first and followed the suggestions to only add 1 packet of yeast.  I also added a little garlic powder and rosemary. I used olive oil instead of butter. This recipes gives me a reason to use my bread machine again soon!

I really liked this recipe, the bread came out really flavorful and soft.  I have a small dinner for two bread maker, so I had to adjust the ingredients accordingly.  Also, I didn't use bread flour, but regular white flour.

I used 1 cup of rye bread flour for some of the white and 1/4 cup mixed cheese along with garlic granules. I didn't have any Marjoram. I was worried about it collapsing and wasting these ingredients so I took out to bake, at that time I should have added some chunks of cheese thru out to make it more cheesy. The herb flavour was good just not cheesy enough. Would make again with noted change.

Very good. I used the metric system because in Europe. I had to put a little bit more flour, changed for milk instead of powder milk + water.
It smells cheese, mniaaam.

I would give this ten stars if I could.  We have eaten this again and again.  The basil & oregano is a little strong if you don't like the "herby" taste - I add either garlic powder or minced garlic to this each time I make it, and it is wonderful.  It is best toasted in the toaster and eaten with butter.  I haven't had any problems with the bread getting too big in the machine, so I do use the whole tablespoon of yeast.  You will not be disappointed with this bread, it is SO good!!
