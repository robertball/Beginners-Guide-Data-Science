This was 5 star all the way! The Chimichurri was out of this world and one of the best I've ever had even though I typically prefer cilantro over parsley. I did run a little short on red wine vinegar so I added a little white wine vinegar but this was the only change I made and it was only a teaspoon at most. EXCELLENT recipe!

We loved it. Pretty spicy.  Had leftovers  with  scrambled eggs the next day and loved that too. The only issue was I had to buy the meat twice  because my dog ate the raw steak before I got a chance to put it on the grill.

First, the chimichurri was way too much in quantity.  It tasted ok, but the end result was not enough to invest in the beef.  No way I would make again.
