Excellent muffin!  I love fresh peaches and this muffine recipe is a great way to use them up. I used 1 cup of sugar and added 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the batter.  I left out the nuts and because I had extra peaches I used 1 & 1/2 cups. I love the large muffins that Perkin's Restaurant has, so I baked these in 6 Texas sized muffin cups.  I topped them with turbinado sugar before popping them in the oven.  These came out so moist and delicous! I will definitely make these again!

Since I have not had as much luck using white whole-wheat flour in muffins and breads as I have with cookies, I consulted my King Arthur whole grain cookbook before I started this recipe.  I used one cup organic whole-wheat white flour and one half cup unbleached all purpose flour. Made with fresh locally grown peaches, what a fabulous Sunday morning, read the paper, treat these turned out to be!  Since I tend to try new recipes all the time, my husband asked me more than once to promise that I would make these again.  No worries, I definitely will!

If you are a fan of Perkins fruit muffins, this is a comparable recipe!  I sprinkled "Sugar in the Raw" on the tops before I baked them and it gave them a sugar crusted top!  So GOOD!  I made a double batch and did blueberries rather than peaches in it.  They were EVEN BETTER!  When ready to eat, spread a little cream cheese on top.  Will definitely make again!  P.S. I omit the Pecans.

These were great.  I didn't have enough sour cream so I used some vanilla yogurt to make up the 1/2 cup.

My family loved these!  However, I made a few changes.  The first time we had them, we thought they were too buttery, so I only added 1/4 cup butter the next time.  I also decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup, used low-fat plain yogurt instead of sour cream and sprinkled pecans on top of some of the muffins instead of stirring them into the batter (some in our family don't like nuts).  We really liked the end result of these changes.

Another five-star rating with modifications.  I doubled the peaches (mine were very ripe and I recommend dicing them very finely), omitted the pecans (didn't have any), cut the sugar to one-half cup, and substituted two-percent-fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream (didn't have sour cream, either).  Baked the muffins in my cast-iron popover pan; recipe made twenty-one muffins of varying size.  I could have (should have) filled the cups more -- the batter doesn't rise very much, but the ones I filled more completely rose to a nice rounded dome.  These are very tasty.  I made them as sort of emergency rations in anticipation of the arrival of Hurricane. Irene, due here tomorrow night.  I feel ready!

Yummy!  These were so good. I used frozen peaches, but did not have quite a cup so I added a couple of teaspoons of vanilla yogurt. I added a cinnamon/sugar mixture to the top before baking.  I will be making these again.  Cannot wait to try them with blueberries and vanilla yogurt in place of the sour cream. ***Last time I used this recipe I added a cup of small frozen blueberries and replaced the sour cream with vanilla yogurt then baked for about 12 min in mini muffin tins.  My family loved them.  My 5 yo asked me when I was going to make them again.  This is a wonderful recipe that is very versatile.

Wow these were great, I used fresh strawberries instead of peaches becuase that is what I had on hand, I still used the pecans.  They were terrific, can't wait to try with peaches.  I think you could interchange any fruit.  The strawberries were fresh.  I just slice and put a little cinnamon and sugar on them while making the batter.

Awesome flavor. . . moist and fluffy!  The sour cream does the trick.  I ended up using 1/4 brown sugar and 2/3 white sugar.  Added slight sprinkling of turbinado sugar on top for crunch.  Delicious.  Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent muffin!  I had some fresh peaches that needed to be used up (used a very generous cup!) and came across this recipe.  Per other reviews, I also cut sugar back to 1/2 cup and in my slight effort to cut back the fat content a bit, I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and added 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce.  End result was GREAT!  I also left out the nuts as personal preference.  My 8 yo loved them too!

Very cake-like, very moist and very flavorful.  I used a heaping cup full of chopped fresh peaches, and rather than making muffins, I made three mini loaves.  I only had about 1/2 cup pecans, so I added chopped almonds to measure 1 cup of nuts.  In the future, I will use fewer nuts, but that's just a personal taste preference.  I might replace the vanilla extract the next time with almond extract, since it's such a nice complement to peaches.  Nice recipe, will make again.

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I changed was that I used a heaping cup of peaches. I definitely loved how these muffins were not too sweet, like a cake. I will make these again; thanks for sharing!

As written, the recipe is two stars.  It tastes like flour.  I sprinkled brown sugar on the top for fun, and it was still bland and not very sweet.  It really needs some extra flavoring, and I even used a generous 1 cup of fresh peaches!  I will make it again, but I will add probably 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla, 3/4 cup of sour cream, and 1 1/4 cup of sugar.  Oh, I forgot, I didn't include the nuts since my son is allergic.  I don't think this really affected the flavor of the batter.  It needs some tweaking for sure.

These were bland.  First, they need at least 1/4 tsp salt.  Second, something acidic or tart like lemon peel would bring out the mild peach flavor more.  A streusel topping would help as well, in addition to some spice (dunno which kind?). Finally they are a little heavy on the fats, especially if you use full fat sour cream like I do in addition to the full complement of butter.  Creaming soft butter with the sugars is necessary to avoid having them come out sodden and dense, and don't substitute oil for butter.   I would not make these again, instead I'll put peaches into my favorite blueberry muffin recipe.

I made these muffins this morning for the first time, and my husband pronounced them "Delicious!" The only change I made was to add 1 and  1/2 cups of peaches, as they are my favorite fruit. I had to use frozen peaches, as the crop this year was not good. I look forward to using fresh peaches when they come back in season. I was a little concerned when I prepared the batter, as it seemed a bit stiff, but they were delicious, with a delicate texture. Do try this recipe!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but mine came out terrible.  I followed the recipe mostly to the letter, except I added more peaches.  Probably because I used more peaches, they didn't cook fully -- even after extra oven time and then they stuck to the pan.  Plus I think they're too buttery/rich/heavy.  I think a lower temp for a longer time, with the peaches cut into smaller pieces, using paper muffin cups and cutting the butter with applesauce (or just leaving some out?), this may be okay.  But the way it turned out for me, I have to give it just two stars.

Easy and tasty.  Like other reviewers I exchanged one cup of flour for wheat flour and also added some cinnamon to the dry ingredients.

I very much enjoyed the muffins! They came out very moist. They were very sweet. I recommend that you fill the pan almost full because they do not rise very much ( if you prefer bigger muffins). Also, put them into the oven for 25 minutes, they came out perfectly! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I thought these muffins were a bit too cake-like. I did add 1 tsp cinnamon for added flavour. Also added 1/2 tsp salt (found it odd to not have salt given the recipe) and changed the white sugar to 1/2 brown and 1/2 white. I used fresh peaches (in season, so I thought they would be great). I also made a blend of cinnamon, brown sugar, oats and a bit of butter to make a streusel topping since it seemed a bit boring. All that being said, my kids like them and my husband thought they were good just not for me - just my opinion.

these were excellent! the end result is not a super-sweet muffin, but rather, a nice combination of slightly-sweet dough with tart/sweet fruit (i used canned peaches). i added a sugar-cinnamon topping made with flour, sugar and butter mashed together so the tops had a little more "interest" but that's optional. i can't wait to make these again!

I'm going to give these a 5* rating, mostly for the taste and texture.  They really are light and melt in your mouth. But presentation I think is only 4*.  I don't like how the muffin mushrooms in the pan rather than rise like a bakery muffin.  Also they needed a topping in my opinion.  I topped with chopped pecans and a cinnamon sugar mix.  While these are a pretty good muffin for me the overall is not a keeper as written.

If I could, I would give these more than 5 stars.  These are excellent muffins!  The only change I made was that I used 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour and a 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour.  These are delicious, and I would imagine they would taste quite good with different kinds of fruit as well.  Thank you for the recipe!!

These were nice, I used frozen sliced peaches, I used apple sauce instead of butter to help cut a few calories. Would do again

6am and dead of winter and I had to have peach muffins- all I had was canned peaches.  During a crisis you have to do things you otherwise wouldn't these were great.  I boosted baking soda to 2tsp as others said they didn't rise much and my peaches were wet- they were perfect.  Also did half and half brown/white sugar   and half and half white/wheat flour  2 egg whites.  Cant wait to make them in their full glory!

I didn't have any butter, so I substituted a little less than a 1/2 cup of vegetable oil. I also added a teaspoon on cinnamon - those are some TASTY muffins!  :)

I used 1/4 cup margarine and 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce to make it healthier.  I also used vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream because I was out of sour cream.  They were yummy but next time I'll try the sour cream.  I used only 1/2 cup brown sugar but mixed 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon and sprinkled it on top of the muffins before baking.  It added a nice crunch. I also omitted the pecans because I didn't have any but next time I'll make sure to use them. I added a sprinkle of ground flax seed in the dry ingredients.  Overall, very good!

These are pretty good. They didn't knock my socks off, but it's a good recipe and I'm sure I will make it again. I found they didn't "rise" much, didn't look like big, beautiful muffins when they were done for some reason. More like pucks -- good thing they tasted better than that!

These were fine, not fantastic but not bad.  I used fresh peaches and some blueberries, too - they were the real pops of yumminess! I substituted plain greek yogurt because I had it on hand. I might try these again, but I'll probably look for something with a little more flavorful batter.

I really liked these. They were very moist, and good flavor. When I put them into the baking cups, I put in half of the batter, then a teaspoon of raspberry jam, then the other half of the batter. This made them so delicious! I did find the consistency very cakey and thick, which wasn't my favorite, but they were still good! They also kept well.. they were left in a container on the counter for about four days, but could have lasted longer.

I did not have fresh or frozen peaches on hand, so I used peaches from my son's fruit snack cups.  This saved me time, as the peaches were already cut up into little pieces.  I also used fat free vanilla yogurt and I omitted the pecans.  What a great recipe!!

I really liked the texture of this muffin.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (I thought I had ALL of the ingredients on hand!) but subbed 1/2 c. whole wheat flour for 1/2 c. of the AP and only had half the amount of sour cream in my fridge so subbed NF peach yogurt for the rest.  I found them to be a little floury tasting, even with the vanilla.  The peaches and pecans are an excellent pairing.  Will try again with all sour cream and AP flour to see if the flavor is improved for me.

I make these often, sometimes I use almond extract instead of vanilla, always I use 1.5 cups of canned sliced peaches that have been well drained and diced up. This recipe is always yummy, always gone very shortly after they are done thank you for a wonderful family recipe.

I'd give this five stars for flavor, but these muffins didn't rise very nicely for me. Not sure why as I followed the directions precisely, but they just stayed flat. I'll keep tinkering with it to get the pretty, domed tops. The flavor was great, though. An excellent use for summertime peaches. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this twice now and it is delicious! The sour cream really made a difference! Followed recipe exactly, just lessened sugar to half cup and added more chunky pieces of peaches since they were a little overripe and extra sweet.

Also tried these with Manila mangoes :-)

OMG these are delicious! I followed the recipe as it is and I loved how it turned out! The buttery flavour is intense, the peaches are great! Very very moist. I sprinkled sugar on top before baking. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS RECIPE! I guess it will also be great with blueberries. Thank you for this recipe. Really really good.

To rate the recipe I feel that one should follow it exactly..  I was pretty close.  I used canned, drained apricots and substituted greek yogurt for the sour cream and added a bit of cardamom.  I don't think those changes made a structural difference - either way, these were delicious!  The texture and flavor were wonderful.  I say "were" because we ate them all!  I'm going to adjust the recipe to make 18 next time so they're a bit bigger.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These were very tasty muffins, the only thing I changed was using 1 1/2 cups of frozen peaches. I had a problem with them rising, I don't know what I did wrong. I will make these again and hopefully they'll rise a bit more.

These muffins are fantastic. I made mine with almond milk and substituted Tofutti brand non-dairy sour cream and they were GREAT!

I didn't quite have enough for the sour cream, but I had some cooked peaches (I had made them for the Peach Preserves recipe on here and they were leftover) that was more than the recipe called for, so I just used less sour cream and more peaches.  I also didn't really use sour cream--used plain greek yogurt, one of our new favorites since it tastes like sour cream but has a lot more protein and less fat.  These were extremely moist, but I think partly that's bc of the cooked peaches I used.  I had to bake them a bit longer as a result.  I found them to be very delicious and so easy.  thanks for the recipe!

The texture and appearance of these muffins make them irresistable! Following other's suggestions, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, used 1% plain yogurt instead of sour cream and added 2 tablespoons of flax seeds.  Prior to adding the cut-up peaches (which I didn't bother to skin and am glad I omitted that time consuming step) I noted that the batter was on the dry side.  I am glad I didn't add any liquid because with the peach nectar and existing yogurt, it was very moist after baking, almost cake-like in texture. I also baked until browned, which was 25 min.  Recipe yielded exactly 1 dozen muffins.

These muffins were a hit with my co-workers.  Using fresh peaches is key.  I accidentally threw in a nectarine in the mix and it was still really good.  I will definitely make these again!

This recipe is fantastic!! I had a hard time not eating it all myself! I made it into a loaf (baked at 350 for about an hour) and added a little cinnamon. Thanks Mrs. Michelson!

Thank you for sharing your recipe with us. These were delicious. I added cinnamon and used sour milk because I had no sour cream and used walnuts. I had to cut back on the butter as I'm doing weight watchers and they were still wonderful. I also topped them with brown sugar and cinnamon before baking.

Just took these out of the oven and had to have a taste. VERY GOOD!  I used canned peaches since I did not have fresh or frozen.  I used whole wheat flour, so I added 4 TBSP. of the juice from the peaches for added moisture.  I also used Splenda Blend in place of the sugar.  Topped with some sugar/cinnamon mixture and baked for 20 minutes.   I will be making these again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I only gave this a 4 instead of a 5 because I made some changes based on another review.

I doubled the recipe, used vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream, and used 1 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup each of brown and dark brown sugar.  Came out super tasty!

Great muffins, very fresh tasting.  Next time I think I will add some cinnamon, I felt they needed a little something more.
