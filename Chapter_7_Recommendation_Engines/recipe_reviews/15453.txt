Very good, very simple.  You don't really need a recipe to make something like this.  I mixed have milk chocolate and half semi-sweet, added a bunch of toffee and ground up almonds, also a macadamia nut on the bottom of each cup and they came out wonderfully

A very quick, easy and tasty candy that is very pretty.  I added some chopped raisins to make it like the old Chunky bars and it was perfect.
