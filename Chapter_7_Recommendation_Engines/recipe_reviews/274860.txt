Aged balsamic vinegar is the key. Definitely will make it again.
Absolute keeper!

This will be my third time making this terrific marinade. We love it. It's on my regular rotation. Today, I'm splitting a whole chicken for the grill and will use the full recipe (no adjustment, like that feature BTW) I found 1 to 1 1/2 hr fridge time is all it needs for our taste.
Bonapetite.

Since I first made this dish it has been a favorite. My husband wants it at least twice a month.  And it's so easy to make. Par it with a nice salad and I also made some garlic and olive oil noodles and also garlic bread.  Perfect simple and delicious meal
