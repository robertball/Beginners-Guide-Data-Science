I made this soup tonight for my family and I must say, it was REALLY good! Because we don;t eat grains, I made some substitutions: I used almond meal instead of bread crumbs, and coconut flour instead of all-purpose - the amount may need to be adjusted, because the meatball mixture was quite soupy. BUT I just added it in by the tablespoon full and because the soup was boiling at the time, it made meatballs - yay for physics! I also adjusted the spices - I didn't have the ones suggested, so I used an Italian seasoning mix, and it was still absolutely fabulous. Oh, and also, because I had some beef stock I needed to use up, I used it instead of straight water - 3 cups stock plus 5 cups water. Man alive, such a flavourful soup - I will definitely use this recipe in the future.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  We added a dollop of sour cream to our soup and it is just the ticket!
