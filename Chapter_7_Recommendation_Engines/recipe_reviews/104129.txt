Deeelicious! I would never have guessed by taste alone that these were "diabetic friendly". I used Brown Sugar Blend since I had some & it worked out fine. I also cut the butter in with a food processer to save time, and added a tsp or so of espresso powder to the cocoa mixture to enhance the chocolate flavour (a must!). Be sure to fill muffin cups right up as these did not rise much. I made these for my diabetic dad's birthday & iced them with a banana flavour icing, and gave the recipe extras to him to freeze for later. The texture was soft & velvety and not at all dry. The recipe made 4 large-size cupcakes and eight small ones; I don't think 18 is a realistic yield. I would definitely recommend these & will make again!

Very, very good. Extremely moist. A definite keeper. I found the cupcakes to be good without adding any icing.

I and my brother in law are both diabetic and I made this recipe the other day and it was excelent. So moist and good. Even my husband really liked it.  We had the first cup cake without frosting and then the rest of the cupcakes I made a frosting of 2 cups of Heavy Whipping Cream, 1 cup of 2% milk and a box of sugar free White Chocolate Instant Pudding and 1 tsp. Vanilla and whipped it up and frosted the cupcakes with it before giving some to my sister and brother in law.  They loved them too.. ***** rating from all of us.

Maybe I did something wrong (though I followed the recipe exactly), but these cupcakes turned out very dry. The flavor was good, but had a slight aftertaste from the Splenda. Others might not notice it, but I tend to be pretty sensitive to it.
