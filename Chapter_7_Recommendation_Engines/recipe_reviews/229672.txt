I didn't find that the pom juice lent any of its flavor to this. It mostly just tasted like oj. Family weren't overly thrilled with them either. I cooked them for at least 20 minutes and still weren't really tender yet. Even though it's meant to be healthy it would benefit from a little sweetening.

11.1.16  I steamed the carrots in the microwave for 2 minutes and then they went into the skillet with the butter.  I added the OJ and pomegranate juice, and I agree with the first reviewer in that the OJ dominated.  I added more pomegranate juice and let it cook down, and served with some fresh pomegranate seeds that I had on hand (so we really DID taste the pomegranate flavor).  If I were to make again, Iâ€™d DECREASE the OJ by 50% and INCREASE the pomegranate juice by 50%.  It was a totally different and new flavor for carrots.  Katie, thanks for sharing.
