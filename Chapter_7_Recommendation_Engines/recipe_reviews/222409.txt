Don't think of this just for waffles.  In minutes, this makes a delicious sauce for ice cream, cake, crepes..you name it.  Sooooo easy, and so good!

Between three and four stars really. Too bad this says it's for waffles in the title because that may prevent people from trying this. I made the sauce for ice cream. It's definitely not too sweet, but better on sweet ice cream- I don't think I'd care for it on the less sweet waffles. It seemed too runny at first, but as it sat it thickened up a bit.  You really  have to like the malted milk flavor-It tastes kind of like melted malted milk balls. My boyfriend is a fan of those (my guests weren't), so I am going to see how well this keeps in the fridge. Hope it lasts till I see him in a few days. I wish the recipe stated how long the leftovers can be stored. Biggest thing in favor of this recipe is how fast and easy it is......ok, in the fridge it turned into a ganache and ganaches can be used for so many things....melt and you can dip the tops of cupcakes in them, whip and they can be used as frosting, roll for truffles, etc. The problem I had when I topped my boyfriend ice cream was that it clumped up too soon because of the cool ice cream, so to keep it at a sauce consistency I needed to reheat it with a bit more heavy cream on the stovetop rather than zapping it quickly in the microwave.

Turned into a mighty fine sauce for cheesecake.  Easy enough for 7 year olds to make as well.
