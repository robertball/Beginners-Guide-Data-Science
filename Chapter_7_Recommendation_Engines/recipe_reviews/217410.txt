Just wanted to let you know that barbacoa is not a chuck roast; it is beef cheek meat.

Like the other person said, Barbacoa is beef cheek and is very good but has a very different flavor then a roast. Aside from that, this recipe looks really yummy

This recipe is pretty good. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the meat needs to be browned before roasting, and because the final product didn't have that spiciness I like barbacoa to have. Next time I'll add more chilies.

My fiance is Mexican and he said it should be just a bit more spice..a bit more garlic and an extra guallijo chili. It turned out fine except for this. I actually used cow cheeks and there was alot of meat on it. Depending on your area you might have to order the cow cheeks ahead of time. I am going to try it again but upping the spices a bit. Overall it was pretty darn good..for your info too, barbacoa was actually made with lamb or goat meat in the past..

Very good recipe. I used the crock pot after a quick sear on the beef instead. Flavorful and tender.

Phenomenal! Didn't have ancho chili powder so just used a spicy Mexican chili powder instead.  I also added  1 tsp of chipotle chile powder.  Cooked in Dutch oven at 300 degrees for 4 hours then shut off the oven and left it in there for another 2 hours.  Trimmed the fat and shred with forks. Wasn't too spicy and the kids loved it also. So tender! Definitely a new favorite!

Great recipe for street style tacos, burritos, tamales, pretty much any Mexican main dish.  I did use chipotles in adobo instead of the peppers in the recipe, replaced the water with vegetable broth, and added two tablespoons of brown sugar, but other than that I have done this recipe a few times now and it is always a crowd pleaser.  It also goes well using pork instead of beef or even 6-8 chicken breasts.  Great recipe, highly recommend.

I tried it, and it was pretty good but I made a couple of alterations.  I added salt because I was surprised not to see salt in the recipe.  I also added a tomato to balance everything out and I also added a head of garlic when I started to cook it.  Also, i marinated it for 5 hours, and cooked in a pot instead of the oven, medium heat for 4 hours.  I cut up the meat in the medium size chunks so it would cook a bit faster.  But it came out pretty good!!  I might add more garlic next time.   :)

I cut this recipe in half, and I used chipotle and ancho chiles because that is what I had on hand. Other than that, made as directed and it was a wonderful, filling Cindo de Mayo dinner.

This was WONDERFUL.  I improvised and cooked it in the slow cooker on high for 6 hours. came out tender and so juicy and flavorful.  The only change was that I added 1 small chile de arbol and 1 chile ancho (instead of powder) pepper (roasted just like the guarillo pepper)  to the mix and added 6 cloves of garlic  and one fresh big Jalapeno pepper to the blender.   I seared the meat and then I cooked the onion in the juices before adding it to the blender.  I also added about a 2 TBSpn of tomato paste.  My Mother always added a little paste to cut the spice for the kids to eat.  The Barbacoa is Delicious!  My husband loved it and since its a warm day I cooked it in the slow cooker instead of the oven.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe :)

I made this for a pot luck and everyone loved it.  I didn't make any substitutions but you may want to hold back on some of the cayenne if you're really sensitive to spicy things.

You can make barbacoa to your liking,  I'd prefer chuck roast meat. Is a process cooking it but it is definitely worth it. I love Mexican food. And barbacoa is one of my favs on the food list

I used a pork butt roast (it was just what I had in the freezer) and it was delicious.  Wasn't as spicy as I expected so next time I'll add some jalapeño to the marinade.  It's surprising to me that there is no salt listed in the recipe.  A tsp added to the marinade would enhance  the flavors and help infuse those flavors more fully during the marinating process.   Great recipe
