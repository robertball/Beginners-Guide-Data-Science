I've been making this recipe for over thirty years. Two differences I do are, I add a little butter and olive oil after removing the bacon. I then saute a nice sweet chopped onion before adding the cabbage and bacon. Cook covered until tender.I never tried the cheese.

I modified this recipe by adding a chopped onion, three small zuccinis and three small yellow squash sliced in quarter inch rounds, and a tomato sliced lengthwise.   Even people who didn't think they liked cooked cabbage enjoyed the dish.    The bacon and cheese make the dish!

I added two cups of water to make sure the cabbage was cooked because this made a 14" skillet full.

This recipe was just ok!,I found it to be a little on the greasy side.The bacon does add flavor to the cabbage,but I didn't really enjoy the cheddar cheese in it. this dish yields alot,it would probably be best to use it all up because I don't think it would keep too well due to the cheese in the cabbage,etc...inetresting dish but I won't be making this one again.

I added 1/2 of a thinly sliced onion, 1 shredded carrot, 1 sliced stalk of celery, and 2 T. extra virgin olive oil. I also used all of the bacon fat instead of only 1 T.  This was very very good.

Very simple to make.  Next time, I will probably use just 4 slices of bacon (I used 5 this time) as I did find it a bit too greasy.  I also only used about 1/2 a cup of cheese (combination of Monterey Jack, cheddar, mozzarella and colby).  I'm glad I did as 2 cups would have been way too much.  I highly recommend frying sweet onions with the cabbage as it goes very well in the dish.

I am the one who posted this recipe...just wanted to say thanks for all the rave reviews!  I will say that I never use an exact amount of any ingredient when I make it, so I was "guess-timating" when I submitted this recipe.  I don't actually use 2 cups of cheese.  I just use enough to thoroughly cover the cabbage!  And, I've also started adding onion after reading the reviews! Happy Cooking!

This is a great recipe. Adding the cheese made it even better. I also too always add onion.  I didn't use cheddar though I used shredded colby-jack. I prefer a little milder cheese. All in all a good recipe.

Awesome! I don't really care for cooked cabbage...this was excellent though. I did saute a small yellow onion in the bacon grease before adding the cabbage, and I shredded a carrot in the mix for added color and nutrition. Yummy!

I made this last night after buying fresh cabbage at the local farmer's market.  The only thing I did different was to sautee onions and garlic before adding the cabbage to the pan.  I think this may have been bland if I hadn't done that.  Some reviewers said this didn't need the cheese so I tried it with and without and I personally prefered it with the cheese.  The cheese added another layer of flavor.  Thanks for sharing.  We really enjoyed your recipe.

SO YUMMY!!  I added half an onion and garlic as suggested in another review but instead of using pork bacon I used turkey bacon and added just a touch of vegtable oil.  Again it was so good.  It reminded me of a scrumptious treat that my Church makes every year for their Germanfest called a German roll.  MMMMM, so good!!

This dish was really good, I have fried cabbage before, but I had never used onions or cheese, one thing is for sure I will not be leaving the onions out anymore. The cheese was a different twist, I could see using it sometimes. One thing I always did with my own recipe was add some sugar, and I will try that with this dish next time. All in all this was a nice change from my recipe.

DELICIOUS!  Thank you for sharing.  I also added in a 1/2 of sweet onion, 1 clove of chopped garlic and some red pepper flakes.  Instead of the cheddar cheese, I mixed in 1/2 a block of cream cheese once the cabbage was done.  Thank you DeeAnn for the inspiration!

DeeAnn, you're right.  Anyone who has a problem with cabbage should try this.  My Jamaican bro-in-law showed me this 30 years ago, but minus the bacon & cheese.  For vegetarians, steam the (onion) & cabbage until slightly wilted.  Add butter (or olive oil for vegans) to fry it up a bit.  Salt & pepper to taste.  I was going to try it with the cheese but at the last minute just couldn't do it.  I love cheese but have more than enough recipes with it that I didn't want to mask the wonderful crunchy vegies.

Delicious! Instead of frying the bacon I baked in 350 degree oven for about 15min. I fried the cabbage in a little butter until it started to brown around the edges.  Great way to eat cabbage!

This was very tasty, but it was missing something. I might add some celery seeds next time around, or some other spice. I reduced the cheese by half and only used 4 pieces of thick bacon. I also added onions, like many of the reviewers suggested. I found it necessary to cover the cabbage with a little bit of water to get it done without scorching it, but I was using a cast iron skillet, so that might have had something to do with it. Overall a good recipe, will use again.

I cooked up this recipe because I thought it was a novel way to spruce up the taste of plain cabbage. However I found the taste of the cheese to be a little over bearing. I would make this recipe again but I would alter the amounts of bacon and cheese used.

I always cook  my cabbage dish using bacon and onions...but I must say this recipe is far better.  The cheese takes it over the top.  One word for this recipe: EXCELLENT.

I read the prior reviews and added an onion with the cabbage.  I also did not use the cheese.  My husband said this was the best cabbage he had ever had.  I agree!!!

The onion is a great addition for those that like it. We add cooked egg noodles to make a casserole and dot with sour cream instead of cheese.

this was very good. I was only cooking only for myself so I used only 2 slices of bacon, a quarter of a cabbage, and added a clove of garlic and half of a small onion. This is perfect for my low carb diet and is a tasty alternative to mashed potatoes.  YUM  I rated it only a 4 becuase I think that it really needs the onion and garlic to be a 5 :)  Updated to add that while this is very good right after it's cooked. It's not very good the next day. just something to note :)

DELICIOUS!! My new, favorite way to have cabbage. Thanks so much DeeAnn! Like Sully, I sauteed onions in a little oil after the bacon. Added ~ 1 TBSP H2O & covered x ~ 5 min to steam the cabbage along. Then I added some butter, & the salt & pepper.  All I had was Parmesean & Asiago cheese(s) @ home, so I topped w/ a mixture of those. Then, turned off the heat, covered the pan & let the cheeses melt. This is so very yummy!

I have made this 3 times now-they want it once a week.  I used pkgd. bacon pieces and a little oil to cook the cabbage.  Added onion, garlic and sprinkled just a handful of cheese on top. Really good flavors and a must have.

I made this to accompany a roasted leg of lamb, and the combination was fantastic! I followed the recipe and only added some freshly chopped garlic and a bit of olive oil. 
Thank you for a great meal!!

This recipe is simplistic, but wonderful. I steamed my cabbage until tender then I added it to the bacon drippings.  It browned nicely and was very flavorful. I will be making this again.  I can see some caramelized onions being added also. Overall it was a hit.  I will be making this many times to come.

Wow, this was great.  I halved the recipe, and won't do that again.  It was gone and I would've loved some leftovers.  The only thing I did different was fried onions before cabbage and added a couple of Tbls. of butter.  I will definetly make again.

I cheated & used pre-cooked bacon.  I cut it up, added 1 Tbsp. butter and then added the shredded cabbage.  I also covered the pot while it was cooking, which I don't think was mentioned in the recipe.  It was great -- my 2yo even liked it!  I ended up not using the cheese because when my husband tested it, he said it didn't need it -- it was great as is.  I will be making again, maybe next time with the cheese. :-)

The best cabbage recipe I've tried.  Amazing!  I doubled the bacon and pumped up the cheese just a bit.  Your arteries might not like it, but your taste buds will find nirvana!  Can I get another helping please?

I seriously had my doubts about this recipe, but I had some cabbage I needed to use before it went bad.  WOW!  This was easy and tasty.  I added some onion as suggested by others and used turkey bacon.  I did add some water to the cabbage as the turkey bacon doesn't produce as much grease.  This recipe is fantastic and I will definitely be making it again!

Made this for a side last night... it was pretty good! I found it a tad greasy, but cabbage and bacon made such a lovely match! I'll make again, cabbage is suprisingly one veg my kids will eat.

My family loved this! I omitted the cheese and my son said it needs a little more spices (he likes hot food,so I  added crushed red pepper). My husband says i need to make this at least once a month. Truly a family favorite.

This was really good, I did not realise that I liked fried cabbage.  I halfed the amount of bacon, so it was not too salty but I did add bok choy, cause my hubby had picked it from our garden. It was a good addition, but there are so many things that would mix well in this recipe.

I had a half head of cabbage to use up and this was so quick and easy. I also added some EVOO to the bacon fat and sauted the onion and garlic in it. Delicious!

I love this!  Had to restrain myself from eating the entire bowl :)
I did add finely chopped sweet onion sauteed in the bacon grease and 2 Tbs  of olive oil as there wasn't much bacon grease to work with.  Also used only 1 cup of cheddar cheese.  I left out the salt because bacon and cheese are already salty and it was just perfect.
Wow, sooo good!  I can't wait for leftovers tomorrow.

I tasted this and thought it was a nice dish. It didn't wow me and I wasn't able to eat too much of it either (because of the richness). I will likely have again sometime, but not for a while.

This was good, but very greasy. I will make again, but maybe not as much bacon as recipe calls for.

This was outstanding.  The only change I made was to fry some carrots, celery and onions with the cabbage, but it would be just as good without those extras.

I did dice a little onion and saute it before adding the cabbage.  My family loved this and ate the whole pot.  I hope you enjoy the picture I submitted and thank you so much for sharing.

This is a great and easy recipe!  Slicing the cabbage like a loaf of bread, drizzling a little oil on both sides with salt and pepper and throw it on the BBQ about 5-6 minutes per side.  Gives this a little healthy help and a nice smokey flavor!

Great recipe!  I have made a similar version but never thought to add cheese.  I like to add some onion and garlic to mine as well.

This was good, but a little too greasy for me. I even used less of the bacon grease than the recipe called for...I did add onion & it made it really good. I also used maple bacon (all I had) & that added a nice sweet taste to it. Cheddar cheese was a nice topping! I will make again, just less bacon grease...
