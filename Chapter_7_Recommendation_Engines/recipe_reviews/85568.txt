I used Smirnoff Whipped Vodka and homemade Irish Cream in this drink. I did not have rum cream I used two tablespoons light rum instead. Delicious drink. For me I think it was the coconut cream that made this.

I went to Aruba last year I had this drink.. I kept forgetting the ingredients after having two or so Brown ladies.. I was too excited when I found the recipe.. Ran out and bought the rum cream liquor.. and just finished my first drink and it's everything I Remember.. Yummy.. Aruba here I come again...
