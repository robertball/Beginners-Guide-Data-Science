Could these poppers BE any better?  I did make with bacon and there are 2 tips I have to offer when using real bacon:  
1) Cook at 375 to 400 for about 30 mins, depending on how crispy you like the bacon. (at the 12 minute mark using 350 degrees, my bacon was raw)
2) Use a fatter, rounder cocktail toothpick and soak them in water for about 30 mins before using so that the bacon grease doesnt burn them in the oven.
I will be making again.  The men last night devoured these in about 20 minutes. So simple and so good!!!

I've made these four times now and use Philadephia cream cheese with chives.  I also use regular bacon and just cut a slice into thirds and place it directly on top of the cream cheese filled jalapenos - a whole lot easier than wrapping them around each half and having to use a toothpick,  You can also crank up the oven to 400.

This was great, and so easy!  I used real bacon and I baked on a rack over a jelly roll pan in the oven to help drain off some of the grease.  Thanks for the idea.

Have never made this recipe with the vegetarian bacon but I do make this recipe with the real stuff.  The only thing we do different is to grill them.  They are awsome, just make sure you wrap the bacon around the cream cheese and secure it well with the toothpick!

I made this for my potluck at work. Excellent! If you want mild poppers make sure you take out ALL the seeds! I used half slices of hickory smoked thick cut bacon. Remember to spoon off the grease every 10 minutes or you can try cooking them on a broiler pan. 
Don't forget to wear gloves when cutting up the peppers. I didn't. I couldn't put my contacts in for days. haha

As many have said I use real bacon (will have to try vegetarian when my vegetarian mother comes to visit!!! good idea) but I would also suggest instead of halving the Jalepenos just cut the top off the jalepenos and use a cheap oldschool metal peeler to scrape the inards out of the jalepeno.... saves alot of time!

Two other comments:
1- WEAR GLOVES (or you will wind up like me crying in the shower trying to rinse my face)

2- Fun fact: did you know that the pointier the tip of the jalepeno, in general, is an indicator of it's hotness? If you are looking for more mild peppers pick the bluntest ended ones.

I really shouldn't be reviewing because I changed the recipe so much, but I used real bacon and broiled them in the toaster oven. They were exactly what they sound like - cream cheese filled jalepeno wrapped in bacon. I think I was expecting the flavors to blend some more. I will try flavored cream cheese or use others' suggestions of spicing up the cream cheese with garlic powder or something. I also didn't need to use any toothpicks - the raw bacon sticks together when wrapped around the jalapeno and stayed that way in the oven.

AWESOME. Would give 10 stars if possible. I used real bacon and didn't need to use toothpicks, didn't leak at all. Word of advice, wear gloves, if you wear contacts then you need to wear gloves. Learned my lesson. You will love this recipe it is a no fail snack!

These were a huge hit this weekend.  I added parsley flakes, garlic salt, and a small amount of grated cheddar to spice it up a bit.  I also cut my real bacon in thin strips instead of using 1 big piece.  I will make these again!

These were excellent & easy to do. I baked about twice as long as called for to make sure they were cooked all the way (I'm too chicken & was afraid they'd be too hot for me!!) Also used turkey bacon. GREAT recipe!!

Excellent!  My aunt makes these quite often and they're even good cold.  I made them last night with real bacon and cooked them on a sheet of aluminum on the grill (for about 20 minutes but a little less would have been fine).  I didn't use toothpicks and can see where they would have been helpful but definitely not necessary.  WARNING: WEAR GLOVES when prepping your peppers.  I ended up with Capsaicin in the pores of my hands and would not wish that on anyone - it took over 12 hours for the burning to subside.

These were great. Like others, I used real bacon, which I precooked a bit. I also blanched the peppers in simmering water for two minutes as mentioned in another recipe's review. Baked at 400 degrees 'til done. By precooking the peppers and the bacon, I cut down on smoke and everything cooked through at the same time.

Great recipe, BUT if you don't wear gloves and get the hot capsasin on your skin it will burn. The antidote to the burn isn't washing with water but with a dairy product like MILK. It is the only thing that will stop the burning. And it does work. I found this out from personal experience after I found washing with soap and water made almost no impact. Remember soak in MILK and it will wash the burning out.

Just a quick tweek...SOooo...NEW MEXICO,Yummy...I having been using this great recipe for years.  Although, I did find that using flavored whipped cream cheese(as with chives) and garlic added too...really is an easy way to spice up the cream cheese. REAL Bacon is a must. They are the hit of parties and you can never make enough for the Boys.  I am able to get fresh peppers here in New Mexico in the Fall.

Awesome!  I sprinkled a parmesan/romano blend cheese on top of the cream cheese before wrapping them in bacon.  A little fresh cilantro would have been a nice addition, but my grocery store was out.   Don't worry if you don' have toothpicks; I didn't use them and the bacon stayed on just fine.  I wrapped the stuffed peppers in foil and grilled them over indirect heat for 10 to 15 minutes until the cheese was melted and the peppers began to darken.  I finished them off with a couple of minutes under the broiler to crisp the bacon.  Fanastic!  They were gone in minutes.  If you don't want a lot of heat, be sure to scrape out ALL of the seeds and white membrane.  You can also try blanching the halved peppers in boiling water before stuffing.  As for my family, bring on the heat!

SUGGESTION:  regular center cut bacon works great also try a packet of the hidden valley ranch dressing mixed with the cream cheese, you won't be disapointed.

I've made these twice; the first time I followed the recipe exactly, using some “facon” (fake bacon) to wrap around the jalapenos.  They came out very good.  The second time my hubby requested that I not take out all of the seeds and veins, and requested that I use turkey bacon.  Clearly, this was a bad decision.  Holy moly, they were burnin’ hot.  The turkey bacon was alright, but frankly it didn’t taste any different to me than the facon.  Thanks for the great recipe, and I will be sure to abide by your directions next time and take out the seeds and membranes!

This was a hit with my family.  I mixed seasonings (cayanne pepper, chipolte pepper and salt) in the cream cheese to give it a kick.  I also used real bacon. I put the mixture in a ziploc bag and cut a hole in it so that I could easily put the cream cheese inside each pepper.  I do recommend using gloves.  I didnt and my hands were on fire by the time I finished removing the seeds~!

I made a batch with real bacon and another with vegetarian bacon (for my veggie friends,) and the real bacon ones are much better. The recipe is pretty bland as is, so spicing up the cheese is recommended. I didn't use toothpicks, but I think I should have just to be able to handle them better, these suckers are greasy. Transfer them to a paper towel before plating them to get rid of some of the grease!

I love this recipe and will be making for Superbowl! The only thing we do differently, is I cook real bacon in the microwave, then crumble on top, and put in the oven. They aren't quite as messy this way!

This is the first time I have attempted anything like this and, being a novice cook, I was very pleased with the results.  I did heed the other reviews and wore gloves.  I wanted to try this before my New Year's Party and I'm glad I did.  I baked the sutffed peppers for 35 minutes at 400 degrees, using thick cut bacon stips cut in half.  I also lined the baking pan with wax paper for easy cleanup and put the peppers on a baking rack.  After 35 minutes the bacon was done but not crispy.  They were easy to bite through and not messy or gooey.  However, the cream cheese was a little bland,  I'm going to pep this up a bit for the party , use a full strip of bacon on my extra big (5")  jalapenos  and add some spices to the cream cheese.  I just don't know what kind yet!  Overall, this was an easy recipie and I will deffinately use it again with some slight modifications.  Thanks for a delicious appetizer for my party.  The men who are not watching thier weight will love it.

DELICIOUS!  We used pineapple cream cheese and panchetta (italian bacon, found in most deli meat sections). I know the pineapple cream cheese sounds weird, but the combination of sweet and spicy is perfect!  yum yum yum.

Loved This.  Was a big hit over Easter.  Changed a couple of things due to other reviewers suggestions.  I mixed some parmesan with the cream cheese and laid a piece of bacon on top of the jalapeno's.  I baked at 400 for 25 minutes and then broiled until crispy.  Yummy

I actually made it with the soy bacon, and it was good, but just not that exciting.  Just like I thought it would, the soy bacon crisped up really fast and was easy to use.  Like another reviewer, I baked the poppers for the first half and then put them under the broiler to crisp the tops.  I have to say, I thought this recipe was really bland.  I ended up making a few changes.  First, I did a mix of peppers, and found that we liked the wax (or banana) peppers the best.  They were a little sweeter and added a great flavor.  I also used reduced fat cream cheese and added garlic powder, black pepper, and grill seasoning.  Next time I'll either add more spices or throw in a packet of ranch mix to get some more flavor.  These might be better with some kind of dipping sauce too, I was just trying to keep it healthy.

These were excellent! I did have to cook them quite a bit longer than suggested.  I cooked them for 20 minutes on 400 degrees.  I used a 1/2 slice of bacon per jalapeno.  My company LOVED them.  They commented that they were PERFECT!  These are simple but time consuming.  Until you clean the inside out and then stuff and wrap them...it takes more time than I thought.  You can prepare them ahead of time.  I have them done 2 hours before my company came and then I just popped them in the over.  One last thing...if you have never worked with jalapenos..make sure you wash your hands thoroughly after you work with the peppers.

This recipe was good. I used Anaheim peppers instead of jalapenos because sometimes jalapenos are too spicy for me. I added one cup of shredded monterrey jack cheese to the cream cheese. I also used real bacon. For some crunch I crushed up some homemade tortilla chips and coated the cream cheese side of the peppers before wrapping them in bacon. I pan-fried them before putting them in the oven to get em crispy and render off some of the fat. 
They were good, but I will probably tweak the recipe some more next time to add more flavor. Great starter recipe though!

If you wanna use real bacon, but you're looking for a slightly healthier version than normal poppers, check this out:  We make these ALL the time in our house, but rather than wrapping the halves, we lay 1/3 piece of thick-cut bacon on top of each cream-cheese-filled half (bonus - no toothpicks needed!!!).  Then we cook them at 425 degrees for 48-55 minutes (we make a HUGE tray of them at a time - cook less time if you don't use the thick bacon).  Line the pan with foil to make clean much less hellish, of course.  These are to DIE for, and the 1/3 bacon still gives you all the flavor and crunchy/chewiness of the bacon with a few less heart attacks (use light cream cheese to keep away more angina).  We'll continue to make these over and over and over again...   EXTRA NOTE:  Leftover poppers folded into an omelet or cut up into scrambles eggs the next morning are something you wish you could eat every single day, I promise.

These were SO good. I did mix the cream cheese with an asiago/parm cheese (shredded) mixture and spread it on a piece of uncooked bacon and used the small slices of jalapeno that you can get in a jar. Wrapped them up. Stuck them with a toothpick and baked til the bacon was crisp...It was a little tricky trying to wrap them in such a way that the cream cheese didnt ooze out, which some still did..but they were DELICIOUS

These are quite excellent. I used whole peppers and removed the stem and just enough of the inside so that I could stuff them full of cream cheese.  I used light cream cheese so that the heat of the oven wouldn't cause the cheese to run out all over the baking sheet. I also used real bacon...one slice per pepper.  Oh my, were they good!  There were enough of the seeds left inside the peppers to give them a definite kick!  I'll make these again and again.  I didn't time the cooking time but baked them until the bacon looked crispy. Probably about 30 - 45 minutes. Thank you for the great recipe!

I agree with the comments about spicing up the cream cheese filling.  Next time, I will try to cut off just the top of the jalapeno rather than cutting lengthwise so that less cream cheese oozes out.  The cheese could be piped in with a pastry bag (or ziploc baggy with the corner cut off).

Deliciously simple...simply delicious. My goodness. My friends and I can't get enough of them. I know its irresponsible, but even during the salmonella scare, we're willing to risk salmonella for its deliciousness. It should be safe since it's cooked right?

I wrap each jalapeno half in half of a bacon strip (no need for toothpick) and drizzle honey over it. A delicious carmelization is formed. I think I'll experiment with some garlic powder of other spices in the cream cheese later.

I am the odd duck with this recipe. I made this as an appetizer for a dinner party, and I did not have one person that liked them! The cream cheese exploded out of every crease it could and basically melted all over the pan. The flavor was even odd.

I made these this weekend for a backyard bbq and everyone loved them. I used real bacon and added garlic powder and season salt to the cream cheese. I increased cooking time to 30 min. so the bacon was cooked well. They were awesome! Thanks for the recipe.

I used real bacon as well and cut the strips in half before wrapping.  I made ahead of time and brought them camping.  These cooked over the fire well, wrapped in foil.  Can be grilled as well on a foil tray with the grill lid down.  These were a big hit with our friends.

What Not to do!  Use real bacon & put on grill to cook!  Charred the bottoms & took forever!  Still, everyone gobbled them up & looked for more!  Delicious!  Next time will do in the oven after 1/2 cooking the bacon to get out the grease!

I baked these at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, turning half way through.  They were awesome!  They are also great grilled.  I thawed out some jalepenos that were frozen from my garden last July to use, and they tasted as good as fresh.  Jalepenos are full of vitamin C so these poppers are sort of healthy!

We made these for dinner and they were delicious.  I think they would be a great food for a party.  The only thing I would change is that I live in high altitude so next time I think I will bake them a little longer.

I've never tried these particular ones, but when my family was here from New Orleans, my stepson made some similar.  After seeding and removing the membranes to make the peppers milder (to my dismay, lol) he also added some cheddar on top of the cream cheese before wrapping in the regular meat bacon.  YUM YUM YUM.  A big hit that I'll make for a long time to come.

With only three ingredients, these looked too good to be true.  I used real bacon, cooked in the microwave just until done and pliable.  I added another minute or two to the oven cooking time.  The only suggestion I have is to list the serving size as more than only one - just try to eat only one of these!! Only three of us inhaled all 18 rather quickly.

I prefer to grill my poppers, because it gives them a slightly smokey flavor.  I also lightly fry the bacon before wrapping them, to reduce the chance of burning the jalapenos.  Absolutely delicious.  Can't make them that often, or I might have a heart attack.

A friend of mine made these for Superbowl party, They were Great! So I thought I would try to make some at home. They were so easy and a hit! I used real bacon as well and turned up the heat to 400* and cooked longer.

These are wonderful! As a vegetarian, I did use the veg bacon, and I loved it.  I followed the recipe as written, except I cut my bacon in half lengthwise(making it thinner), which made it easier to wrap around the small jalapenos I had.

Really liked these poppers.  I did add about 1/4 C. grated parmesean cheese and a few dashed of garlic powder.  Will make again.

I used regular raw bacon and added some scallions and sour cream to the cream cheese but cooked them 10 minutes longer than recipe...They were so good!  Definitely will make again.

Fantastic and simple.  My two favorite things.  I added a little garlic powder to the cream cheese.  Everyone (ages 2-98) gobbled these down.  I made them ahead of time and popped them in just before serving.  I did need to bake them a bit longer than the recipe says, too.

This is what I make except I use real bacon and put them in the oven on about 200 for 3 hours or so.  Don't ask me why, the recipe was given to me this way  and this is the way I always make them.

I used sweet peppers for this recipe because not everyone in the family enjoys spicy food. Also instead of cutting the peppers boat-shaped, I just hollowed out the veins and seeds from the pepper and stuffed them with cream cheese. The family loved the flavor the bacon gave them. Pro tip: mix bacon bits in with the cream cheese and wrap with even more bacon.

I'm going to enlighten you all. Put the poppers in a cold oven then heat the oven to 400. Your bacon will be crispy not soggy. And add some sundries tomatoes and garlic to the cream cheese.

We do like these but the baking time is not long enough.  I baked them for 40 minutes at 375F. on a rack and they were just right. This would have been 5 stars but for the baking time being so far off.  Used regular thin sliced bacon and added 1/4 package of ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese.  Next time I'll add garlic powder to it, also. Maybe garlic salt because, oddly enough, they seemed to lack salt.  I only had 10 fairly large jalapenos and had enough filling for about 12 (24 halves).  It doesn't work to overfill the halves because the cream cheese swells and the excess simply falls in the bottom of the pan.  

I was glad to be able to serve these without the breading and deep frying.  Atkins dieters alert:  This is a good appetizer for that diet.

P.S. Removing seeds and membranes from your peppers gives you a pretty mellow product. Also, the longer they sit before you bake them the more mild they are.  I think our 2 year old grandson would have eaten and liked these.  You're left with only the flavor of the jalapeno, not the heat.

I used lightweight rubber gloves to prepare these and washed my hands with soap with them on as I went from step to step.  You don't want the pepper juice all over everything and it does burn if it gets in your eyes.

Happy Football Season and thanks, Seahawks Fan

I used real bacon too and another similar recipe on here also includes topping each bacon wrapped pepper with some brown sugar which helps cut the heat even more and the candy the bacon!!! I also use herb/garlic cream cheese from time to time for a little extra favor. SO GOOD!!!!!

The bacon did not cook in the 20  minutes I had to cook them.  In 28  minutes the bacon was still not crispy but the bottoms were getting hard and I  had to serve them with the bacon still partially soft.  Next time I I'm going to cook the bacon first until half way cooked but still pliable enough to wrap around poppers.

It's wrong not to include a small (31-40 size, raw, de-veined and peeled completely) shrimp on top of the cheese when you wrap it and stick it with the toothpick.  
Also, I think you should only use half a slice of streaky bacon per half jalapeno.  If you have people who don't like hot foods too much, substitute half anaheim peppers (the 5" long narrow green ones) for half the batch.  Since they are longer, you can split the anaheim and make four poppers out of each pepper (use 2 slices of bacon for each anaheim).  IIRC, there are thirteen slices of bacon in a package of thick cut real bacon (1 lb) so if you half each then you will need 13 peppers also.

Followed the advice of others and placed a strip of bacon on top rather than wrapping it around. Added some shredded cheddar to the cream cheese mixture, too. Cooked for about 20 minutes @ 375 degrees.

Can't go wrong here!  Make sure to place poppers on a cooling rack inside a cookie dish lined with foil...helps the bacon crisp up.

These were delicious! I followed one reviewer's recommendation and soaked the tooth picks before baking, which helped. They were very flavorful. I will be making these again and next time I am going to try them on the grill.

These were a big hit with the family...I for some reason wasn't entirely crazy about them...i thought it was too much bacon....I'm sure it was just me considering how EVERYONE else loved them...but i felt a little sick after eating a bunch...PS smaller jalapenos are more spicey than the larger ones so consider that when you buy the peppers =)

This recipe as is is kind of plain typical jalapeno popper. I used real bacon and doctored my cream cheese quite a bit. I added a packet of dry ranch and some shredded cheese(the thin kind in the bag). This is a great starting place and anything with bacon is awesome but if you want it to stand out you very much need to add something to it.

You KNOW a dish is good when it's gone in the first five minutes...  a big hit at the Superbowl party, these puppies didn't last long enough to see kickoff!  I took a tip from another reviewer and used real bacon, then upped the temp to 375 and the cook time to 25-30 minutes.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

I've been making these poppers for a few years and they are awesome.  I usually use about 9 for a tub of honey nut cream cheese.  I probably have a little more ooze but they are so good.  Thin sliced bacon seems to work best.  I definitely recommend trying the honeu nut cream cheese!

I have never made these with vegetarian bacon, and I know I never will - real bacon is required for this dish in my opinion!  I add some shredded cheddar cheese & chopped green onions - and brush some bbq sauce on top of the bacon, and its just one of those addictive foods you can't stop eating.  I give the recipe a 3-4 star as written, but a 5 star plus with a couple modifications.

yummy! my hubby was drinking gallons of water, but would not stop eating them! the recipe does need more than 8oz of cream cheese, probably 12oz would be enough.

I made the poppers with both real bacon and veggie bacon.  It's definitely a hit for the people who eat meat and my vegetarian friends.  Adding chive and onion cream cheese makes a huge difference. I actually mixed it with whipped cream cheese so it wasn't so heavy.

These were awesome!  I didn't have any gloves so I used plastic bags over my hands.  Instead of wrapping the bacon I cut the strips of bacon in half and placed over the piped cream cheese.  Anyhow I took these to a luau party and they were a huge hit, eaten in minutes. thx for sharing!

All I can about these is YUM. My boyfriend has been making a recipe similar to this for years, whenever we have a party or guests over. He uses a tub of spreadable cream cheese in leiu of a block of cheese. I have never tried it with soy bacon, but now that I've gone mostly vegetarian, I will have to give it a try! These are by far, my favorite appetizer!

The recipe is good.  But I add half a pound of browned sausage into the cream cheese and then stuff the jalapenos.  Just make sure to drain the bacon well, or they can come out too greasy.

I use thin, real bacon (1/2 strip), bake at 400 degrees for 30 mins.  I added a pineapple chunk to each one and everyone RAVED about them - just enough sweetness to offset the hot.  These are a hit every single time I make them.

These came out great and were a hit at my New Year's Eve party. Definitely add some garlic powder or other spice to the creamcheese to add some flavor. I had to cook mine for around 18minutes to get my soy bacon to a nice crispness.

I have been making this exact recipe for years, with one exception....we always grill them.  I have had them both ways and believe me the the grilling make it.  You do have to wrap the jalapenos in bacon and stick the toothpick through, as well as be very attentive while they are cooking but it is definately worth the effort.  I have not meet anyone who does not fall in love with these!

These are a great snack for vegetarians!  I used Morningstar bacon and followed the directions exactly, next time I think I will try to bake a little longer and maybe flip during cooking to try and get the bacon a little crispier.

The only change I did was add garlic salt to the cream cheese for a little extra flavor.

Excellent version of poppers.  Easy to make and taste great.  I also used real bacon and baked at 385 for 30 minutes.  I turned on the speed bake for the last 3 minutes and they turned out perfectly.

We have tried these with lots of different peppers, and they are a hit.  They do take some time to prepare though, so fix them ahead of time if you can. I had the bright idea of making them one evening when a group of us got home from a festival.  Everyone was nearly asleep by the time I got 30 to 40 of them made and cooked.

Awesome & soooo easy! Made 4 dozen - people were asking for more. Don't forget to wear gloves to seed the peppers. Will make these again and again and again. Use a ziploc bag wtih the corner cut to smear the cream cheese. I used real bacon - baked @ 375 for 25min - Perfect!

I used regular bacon and only used 1/2 slice per jalapeno half. Took about 25 minutes to bake. Delicious! These are also good when cooked on the grill.

Assuming that you spice up the cream cheese and precook the peppers, these will definitely disappear in a hurry.

I have made this recipe before. Very delicious! I used onion and chive cream cheese to give the peppers more flavor. Just make SURE that you wear plastic gloves when handling the jalepenos. And don't rub your eyes - TRUST ME! I learned the hard way!

So bland  , would not make these again without adding a whole lot of spices, but then that would be a whole different recipe.        Emeril's jalapeno poppers are awesome, a lot more work but at least they are edible.

I've made these poppers dozens of times and they're always a favorite at my BBQs. Here's some lessons that I've learned over the years:

1. Don't stop with the cream cheese. I usually use a 50/50 mix of cream cheese and sharp cheddar but any cheese in your fridge works.  A Gouda mix has been popular with my guests.

2. Pre-cook  the bacon to half done. I've noticed that using raw bacon results in overcooked poppers or under-cooked bacon. If you don't want soggy jalapenos this is a must.

3. These get pretty greasy if you just use a cookie sheet. I always use a rack on top of my cookie sheet to let the grease drain.

4. A fish basket works really well for doing these on the grill. It allows you to easily flip and move them around the grill. They need a lot more attention on the grill do to flare ups and hot spots.

Hope this helps,
Ryan

Awesome recipe...this was part of my "guinea pig" dinner...that's when I make new recipes for everyone w/o trying them myself, lol. As with previous posts I added a little jive to my cream cheese...i.e. Minced garlic, dried parsley and dash of salt & pepper, then chilled it while I de-seeded the peppers (WITH gloves) and used a half piece of bacon for each half pepper. Roasted on a rack at 375F for about 40 mins plus 4-5 mins under the broiler to crisp/brown the bacon. They were a hit! My hubby said if we didn't have company he'd have eaten the whole plate (btw I only used 10peppers and had just enough filling). Great lo-carb appetizer and really didn't take that long to make.

If you really want to get adventurous add grated cheddar cheese, canned grab, chopped up green onions, chopped up bacon, and a dash of hot sauce to the cream cheese.  These are really good smoked too

We have been making these for years and calling them "Scorpion Bites".  You want to use gloves when you are slicing the peppers or your hands will feel the burn when you're done.  If you pop off the stem/cap end, you will leave a barrier to hold the cream cheese in better.  We bake them in a 425 degree oven for about 25 minutes.  If you want the bacon crisper, you can always put them under the broiler for a couple of minutes; we never need to.  Even the people that don't eat jalapeños like these.  Make sure you strip out the veins and seeds!

These were great. People still ask us to bring them to parties. One change we made was we added a bit of shredded mozzarella to the cream cheese to give a bit of a stringy texture.

Made this for opening of the 2014 NFL season. It was a HUGE hit and comments such as "Amazing"! I did add a couple of extra touches such as; chopped green onions, minced garlic and cheddar cheese to the softened cream cheese. If you have a baking rack to lay on top a sheet pan it really helps to make bacon crisper.

This without a doubt are the favorite at our house.  I use pineapple cream cheese and it gives a whole new dimension to the flavors.  Sweet, salty, fruity and completely yummy!

I've been making this recipe for years now. Every time I do it a little differently- sometimes I'll cook up some shrimp and scallops, dice it, and throw it into the cream cheese. There have never been any left overs in the dozens of times I've made this recipe.

Delicious, cheap, and relatively easy to make! I also use regular bacon and turn up the oven to 400.

Thought I would like these but the fake bacon was awful!! I've had these with real bacon and that's the way to go. I'm always looking for healthy versions of recipes but this was NOT something I'd make again. I keep trying veggie bacon in recipes but I think I'm going to stop trying to substitute bacon and all it's lovely badness!!

I've been making these for years, but with real bacon. I have a few tips to offer after many, many times making these. First, for a quicker cook time in the oven, I lightly pre cook my bacon. I've found that the bacon can take a long time in the oven and these things go fast in a crowd so I usually always have a second batch that needs to be made. I cook the bacon until about half done and then follow the recipe as directed. Second, I line a cookie sheet with foil, and then place my bacon wrapped poppers on a wire rack, directly over the foil lined pan.  This way the grease drips down from the bacon. Lastly, for those that are extra sensitive to hot peppers, I recommend using gloves while handling the jalapeños. I've had a few experiences where my hand were on "fire" for hours after handling the peppers! Other then that, these are ALWAYS a crowd pleaser and I constantly get asked to bring these to parties!

Awesome recipe! absolutely delicious!
I had to leave the poppers in the oven longer than the recipe calls for in order to thoroughly cook the bacon but it was worth it!! So good and I wish I had made more, my brothers ate all of them when my back was turned.

This recipe was so easy to follow for the first time making these! I even added mild and spicy sausage to the cream cheese to put in the jalapeno halfs. They went quick when i made them for a super bowl party last year. It was requested for this year!! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

We call these "Rattlesnake Eggs" in my family so the veg bacon is a strange twist for me! I suggest using the real thing. If you like spicy spicy, par cook the bacon in the pan before assembly and reduce cooking time in the oven. Kick up the flavor by mixing the cream cheese with anything from season salt to parm to even artichoke dip - depending on your tastes. Always a crowd pleaser!

I use turkey bacon every time, and everyone LOVES them.  (And I never use toothpicks...I just wrap the bacon around.)  Very simple to make, and you only need 3 ingredients!

I love this recipe. I tried it with real bacon and it was yummy. It took longer than 12 mins to cook but that's OK. My husband really liked it too. Its a recipe that I will share with all my friends. Thank you!!

Word of advice...WEAR GLOVES!!
Having said that,  these are definitely one if the best Popper's I've had. I used herb and garlic cream cheese and real bacon. I think next time I will try and add some Monterrey jack cheese to the cream cheese.
I would also love to invest in a deep fryer for these bad boys.

Very tasty but a little tricky with real bacon. Baked mine as directed but needed to put them under the broiler to get the bacon crispy. Tasted good though. Mixed a little shredded colby/jack in with the "cream cheese", I used neufchatel for lower fat tried using half strips of bacon but will use whole strips next time due to shrinkage. Will be making these again though.

So addictive! Wow. I have been making these for years, and I see that someone put em up here. These are delish, my kids (5 and 8)love them too. No need to use the toothpicks. I slice the real bacon in half longways just to make it $tretch further.

I make these all the time for my boyfriend. He LOVES them. I also use regular bacon and secure with a toothpick just in case. I will try using cream chees with chives next time. Planning on making these again for super bowl party! Be careful when you seed them- might be a good idea to wear gloves.
