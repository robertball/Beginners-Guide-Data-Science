The first turnoff was the description.  However, I had high hopes, which never materalized when I tried the recipe!  Sorry.

i thought this might be a little better than it actually was... I found it rather bland. Being from Maryland, and yes, I know we have plenty of good dip recipes, I wanted to try something different than the traditional... am sorry I did

I was looking for a crab dip recipe that did not contain cream cheese.  I had all the ingredients in this one so I decided to try it.  I didn't think this was half bad.  I did doctor it up with minced garlic and red pepper flakes and I did use a can of crab meat drained.  If you need something relatively quick and easy, I would at least give it a try.
