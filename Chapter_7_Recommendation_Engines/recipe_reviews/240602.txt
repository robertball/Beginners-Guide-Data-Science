This is tasty. Fair note let this one freeze in your freezer for minimum a couple of hours otherwise the flavors will not be set and overwhelm you with sweetness. I added about 1/2 cup of pistachios. It was delightful. Thank you for sharing this delicious quick recipe. Note for people you can sub the sweetened condensed milk for heavy cream if worried about sweetness. Forgot to take photo last night and it is already all gone. Beautiful light spring green color.

Super easy and a great idea for easy flavored ice creams.  As written it's waaayyy too sweet. We made several subsequent batches and used a half can of sweetened condensed milk and it was so much better. Flavor and consistency were both better with a half can. 5 stars with that modification. Used 50%half and half and 50% unsweetened almond milk.

I liked this, but my husband didn't. It is really easy... A good base recipe. Maybe if I added a few mix-ins it would seem "complete". I can't wait to try it with other pudding flavours though!!

This has a nice flavor and lovely light green color.  My husband loved it!  I had a problem with the texture.  It was almost like frozen pudding.  I did cut the sweetened condensed milk in half and added a half cup of half n half.  Also added 3/4 cup lightly salted pistachios.  This froze very well and hardened up in two hours.  Good for a quick frozen dessert.

This did not taste at all like ice cream.  It tasted like frozen pudding.  I ended up throwing the whole batch out.

Was shocked how simple but delicious it Wars.  I added lightly salted pistachios to it.

I didn't read the other reviews before I  made this.  I should have because I  didn't  like it at all. I  gave it 2 stars because I hope  it's  better  tomorrow.
