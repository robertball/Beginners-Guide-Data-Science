This was a wonderful way to cook lobster tails.  I used to always boil them, but they would curl all up and didn't taste as good.  With broiling them, you have more control over cooking them so they don't get over or under cooked and they stay flat.  Next time though, I need to season them more.  Thanks for a great method of cooking lobster tails!  Also, I wanted to add that if the top of the shell is already cut open, it's best to cook the lobster in the shell instead of pulling it out because the shell helps protect it from burning or drying out.  Also, like another reviewer, I only used about half of the butter on them before cooking and saved the rest for dipping.  Be careful when opening the oven door because the butter smokes up really bad and it will burn your eyes.  I like the idea other reviewers had about using old bay seasoning instead of paprika because I think it would give it an even better flavor that way.  I'll try that next time.

Ingredients are clear, but totally dependent on the size of the tails which isn't mentioned. I prefer to use 3/4 to 1 lb. tails. I split the shell only, not the meat. Separate the meat under the shell with a spoon and carefully push the meat up through the split, resting it on top of the shell, without disconnecting it from the tip of the tail. Broil no closer than the middle rack. A 1 pounder takes about 20 min.

Made these for New Year's Eve - what a treat!! I split the meat about half way through and used a skewer inserted just under the tail and run the whole length to keep them from "curling". Then, I spread the shell so that it was "open". I broiled them one up from the bottom rack to prevent burning with two one pound tails, and left he door open to watch them intently! I drizzled with garlic butter several times during the cooking process, as well as putting about a half cup of water in the bottom of the broiling pan (to help keep them moist - the water becomes steam during cooking). Keep in mind that frozen lobster tails WILL BE tougher than fresh - no matter what you do, so take great care cooking, or you will loose flavor and the lobster will be "rubbery". All that said, cooking time took longer than some folks for 1 pound tails, about 30 minutes, but well worth it!! The flavor was fabulous!!

I have used this recipe a couple of times.  I modified it by adding the salt, pepper and a little white cooking wine (1/4 cup? I didn't measure) to the melted butter.  Using a basting brush, I basted the lobster meat with about half of the butter/wine mixture before broiling.  I bought my lobster tails at Costco and they were fairly large.  They required more than 10 minutes of broiling.  I found that keeping them in the shell while cooking, keeps them from burning and drying out.  Prior to serving, I pull the meat out of the shell and lay it on top of the shell (partially attached at the small end) for a better presentation and serve with the remainder of the butter/wine mixture for dipping.

Sometimes the most simple recipes are the most delicious.  This was wonderful.  I didn't use near as much butter as called for, but used the extra for dipping.  I broiled my 6-7oz lobster tail for 7 minutes and it came out perfect.

Simple and delicious.  I split the shell down the middle with kitchen shears and pulled the shell halves apart to expose the meat, but still leaving it inside the shell.  I used the 2nd rack from the top and broiled for about 10-11 minutes and it was perfect.

Since we very rarely eat lobster, it was difficult to determine level of doneness.  The tails had been frozen, but thawed two days in fridge plus a few hours on the counter.  Tasted great, but only after 12 minutes broiling.  15 minutes would have been better.

Hubby made these for me & they were fantastic! He used Old Bay instead of paprika & salt & he added just a hint of fresh rosemary... along w/ some fresh chopped lemon balm. He added lots of fresh minced garlic to the butter cooked on the lobster & went easy on the garlic in the butter used for dipping. I think he outdid himself this time...thanks! We served these w/ leftover zuchinni batons (from  foodnetwork) & artisan bread that we dipped in the butter as well ... Lemon Syllabub (from this site) made a fine  dessert.

First time I ever prepared a lobster tail.  Great recipe - my husband loved it.  I used a small pan with about a cup of water on the bottom for steam.  It only took 10 min. to cook 1/2 pound tail.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

The time needed to cook lobster tails is way too dependent on their thickness.  The garlic, etc., burned long before the thick tails I was cooking finished cooking through, even though I had them on the middle rack in the oven.  Then, once everything finally did finish cooking, they were dry and tough.  Boiling and steaming work better.

Simple and straightforward instructions for broiling the perfect lobster tail. We had 8 oz. tails, which hubby broiled in the middle position of the oven, for about 10 minutes.

Lift the meat up to rest on shelll, brush with melted butter, broil 6" from broiler for 1 min per ounce.  i.e. a 10oz tail will take 10 mins.  Brush again with butter 1/2 way thru cooking.

This recipe was not very clear.  When reading it, it seems simple enough but in the process of actually working with the lobster, it was awful.  I had small lobster tails and it just seemed like the butter was too much and it would burn before the lobster cooked.  
I think for this recipe to work, it needs clearer instructions:
1. How big of a lobster tail..is the amount of butter synonymous with the weight of lobster?
2. Should the rack be close to or away from broiler?
3. I cut the shell lengthwise but it was difficult to open slightly...is it supposed to crack? Should the meat be exposed? 
4. Is the butter melted BEFORE you put the lobster in the oven?

It could be that I just didn't understand, but for such an expensive meal..it should be more precise.

Wow, I should've read the reviews before we cooked our lobsters for the time in her recipe.
5 minutes is not nearly enough time and 10 minutes was not either, not by a long shot.   I got our lobsters at Costco and they were as big as they come.   I broiled them for 8 minutes and looked them over then put them back min for 4 more minutes.  (not wanting to over cook them since you state that 5 - 10 mins is all that is needed.
Since we never broiled lobster before we took it for granted that the recipe was ok.  Well after trying to eat them we put them back in the oven again this time for another 6 minutes.   That is a total of 18 minutes.  We ate them and I thought they tasted good but still on under cooked.
Now I am thinking they should have been cooked for 25 - 30 minutes for the size we had (1b each).

This is the way to go for sure.  I boiled them in the past and they ended up like shriveled jumbo shrimp - chewy too.  This retained tons of great flavor!  The worst part is prepping before you cook them - I used kitchen shears and cut down the top, spreading the shell out.  Just like shrimp there is a large "vein" - i.e. the poop shoot the lies on the dorsal surface - you'll see it when you expose the top of the tail meat.  Just cut this part out.  I poured butter on top, sprinkled garlic and Old Bay - took about 7 minutes on Broil (low setting) 5-6 inches from top.  Dipped it in butter.  We served ours with boiled king crab legs and corn on the cob.  It was a great mother's day meal.

This is the best way I've found to fix whole lobster tails. However, you have to be careful with the time of 5 to 10 minutes.... I used two 5 oz. tails and the broiling time was more like 12 to 15 minutes. Be sure to watch the time carefully. It's better to cook a minute or so longer than not cooking long enough. Lobster is my favorite food and this is my favorite way to prepare it!

Came out perfect..  I basted with olive oil due to dairy allergy.. added just a touch of garlic salt rather than regular salt..sprinkled a little smokey paprika.. Wonderful!  I needed about 12 minutes due to the size and also I had the oven rack down two from the element..  that way the lobster cooked evenly and did not brown too much on top.
The lobster meat was pulled from the shell (still partially attached) sitting on top of the shell to cook

This recipe was great.  We used 3/4 pound tails and had to broil them for about 20 minutes.  We put the rack pretty close tothe broiler for the first 10, then moved it to the middle.  In hindsight, I'd have left it in the middle the whole time.
The tails turned out delicious!  This is a great simple recipe.  You don't need much as far as seasonings, since you really just want to taste that scrumpcious lobster!!
Thank you!

The way we ate it, it was maybe five stars, but with modifications.  This needed far less butter.  We used half a stick.  We added garlic and old bay and it was very good.  Our oven took about 10 minutes on high broil, second rack from the bottom.  If you want to know if they're done, just check the end where the meat is visible.  It should be opaque.

This was so easy and turned out great! I was a little nervous because it was my first time cooking lobster tails. I don't like lobster because it is always chewy in restaurants, but my father and husband love it! My mother and I decided to do a surf and turf dinner for my father for Father's Day. We used 4 oz tails, and cooked them for 7 minutes, and put a 1/2 cup water in the bottom of the broiler pan. I also didn't pull the meat from the shell until after it was done cooking. I think it helped the meat stay moist. It wasn't chewy at all! I am glad I used the paprika as I think the Old Bay, as much as I love it, would have over powered the flavor of the lobster.  My father said, "Next time we need more surf than turf!" lol I actually went back to the store and purchased more so that I could freeze and make it for my husband when he gets back from training. He is going to be so excited! Thank you!

First time doing lobster, great recipe.  My wife love it and so did I.  Simple and tasty.  I follow the advice for old bay seasoning and a garlic clove to the butter for basting.  Two 1/2 pound tails took about 20 mins in the lower rack.

Yum, yum, yum! Easy, tasty, and doesn't overwhelm the sweet lobster flavor. I cooked my smallish lobster tails for 8 minutes on normal broil, center rack, to get the firmness I desired. A pair of kitchen shears came in handy to cut the shells.

This is the best means of cooking frozen lobster tails. However, the recipe failed to mention that you should broil approximately 8 inches away from the heat. Any closer than that and the lobster won't cook evenly.

3/4-1 pound lobsters take me about 5-7 minutes. YMMV.

This recipe is not only very easy but, very good! All was done exactly as the recipe asks, except I brined my lobster for about 45 minutes, and this made it the most tender lobster I have ever eaten! I did use the paprika mixed with the butter and pepper. I don't believe I would ever use the Old Bay seasoning, as I use that for steamed blue crab and shrimp. Lobster has a very unique flavor and I would not want to over power it with Old Bay seasoning, even though I love it's flavor.

This recipe is elegant in its simplicity.  I'd never cooked lobster tails before and wanted to do so for my husband's birthday.  Success!  Thank you for sharing.  (Our lobster tails required 14 minutes to become opaque.)

Fast Easy Simple
Anything as good as lobster tails doesn't need fancy fixins' - allows the sweetness of the meat to shine through.  Added a few extra minutes for larger tails.

Very good recipe. I just used kitchen shears to split the tails and poured the butter mixture over the meat. I had 3 5 oz tails and I broiled them on low for 8 minutes and high for 3 and they turned out great. I will definitely be preparing this recipe again when lobster tails are on sale!

This was very good but I did have to broil it longer than 10 minutes. I also followed someones advise and put a pan of water under the lobster  tails. I sprinkled it with  a little garlic powder and also basted it with butter a couple times while broiling it. It was very moist and delicious.

Delicious! I brined the lobster tail for an hour before 1/4 cup of salt 1/4 cup of sugar and 2 quarts of water.  I broiled the lobster according to recipe and it came out so tender and tasty!  This one is a keeper ~ thanks!

Made this last night and loved it! Beter, IMHO, han steamed or boiled. Had 8oz and 5oz prev frozen tails. 2 racks down in oven, broiled 8 oz for about 11 mins, 5oz for 8 mins. I spooned on a sauce of butter, lemon juice, Old Bay about 3 minutes before they were done. Worked out perfectly - tender, fully cooked, moist and delicious!

This was my first time cooking lobster tails and I will use this recipe going forward.  This was so quick and easy.  I used two 4.5 oz tails and broiled on the middle rack for 6.5 minutes.  I like my food, even seafood, super done.  So next time, I will probably go 8 minutes.  Kudos to the reviewer who said stand back when you open the oven.  The butter does burn fast and runs right out of the lobster tail.  So turn your vent on as soon as you put your tails in to clear up the smoke and keep you from thinking you're burning something.  I only added butter and garlic powder.  To me, lobster tastes good by itself and needs minimal seasoning.

I used old bay and garlic salt to season the creature. I watched this video to show me how to remove the meat before broiling. I also brushed him with butter a coupld of times while broiling as my broiler is a super broiler and i was scared of burning my expensive piece of seafood. Good luck and thanks for sharing. PS this was my first time ever making lobster and it turned out great. the BF said "the heck with restaurants..i'd rather come here"

Very good.  I also added some Old Bay seasoning to the melted butter.  Mine was very large so took a little longer.
You may want to run a skewer through the tail to prevent curling.  I out them on the second rack so as to not burn the top and cooked on Low until the end then switched to High to give it a nice browning.  Served with extra drawn butter.  Yummy!  Good way to start the New Year!

This was my first time preparing lobster and it was an absolute success! The hints in the comments are great. As suggested, I used a combination of butter, black pepper and a pinch of Old Bay Seasoning. I also used the skewers, which resulted in a lovely presentation (both the shape of the lobsters and the "ooh-la-la" factor that shiny skewers bring). Served with corn on the cob (steamed with butter and Old Bay) and lemon wedges. Can't wait to do this again!

This was a great recipe for a first time lobster cooker. I had two 1lb lobster tails and followed the tips of previous reviewers. I broiled them for 25 minutes, and checked them every 10min. I cut the shells down the middle and kept them in the shell during the broiling. can I just say they were so moist they melted in your mouth. YUUUMMMMM!!!!

I did not butterfly the lobster in order to keep it moist. It took about 13 minutes for 4-6 ounce tails and they came out perfect!   I did brine the lobster tails in a 1/4 cup salt per 1/2 gallon for an hour before cooking them.

This was my first try at lobster tails.   I am so glad I did it this way!  Very easy and no mess.  The meat came right out of the tail once cooked and was very tasty.   I used Old Bay Seasoning and butter.

Great recipe and ideas on cooking the lobster.  We bought about a dozen for New Years and wanted to make sure we cooked them properly. 
It was sooo yummy!!  This was definitely a treat for all!

This is the first time I make lobster tails and they came out great! I love the idea about making them in the broiler. I used 'I Cant Believe Its Not Butter Light' to reduce calories and that worked out great. Will definitely make again.

The perfect way to do lobster.  The paprika is what makes the flavor so special.  I will never do lobster differently.  Tender and flavorful the way lobster should be.

My boyfriend and I went to his family's house for Thanksgiving, and they have a tradition of eating lobster tails as an appetizer. Last year he grilled them, but this year he tried this recipe, and he insists that this is THE way to make them! He claims that the paprika is key. Thank you!

Like others have stated, the key is to watch the lobster tails. I split the shell and meat down the middle, then laid the lobster meat on top of the shell for nice presentation. I also sprinkled them with a bit of garlic. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This was easy and delicious. I broiled 4 lobster tails, about 5-6 oz. each, using this recipe. I broiled for 10 minutes on the 2nd from the top shelf (gas stove) and then about 2 minutes on the top shelf to finish.

Recipe has problems: 1. 5 to 10 minutes is too short a cooking time; it's more like 20 minutes. 2. Lobster tails burn quickly (and splatter) when applied with (presumably) a 1/2 cup melted butter; perhaps lightly brushing melted butter from the onset and either adding more melted butter incrementally or once done.

The lobster tails I used definitely needed double the time the recipe called for. It depends on the size of the lobster tails. When melting the butter I threw in minced garlic to add flavor to the butter. I made sure to check the temperature until it hit 175°F. Everything else was followed as the recipe asked.

The best, the absolute best.  These lobster tails were cooked for our valentines day dinner.  The only thing that was wrong with it, well there wasn't anymore left for seconds.

What a tasty bug! He didn't scream either. Simple preparation is great-it's nice to not distort the lobster flavor.

These were fantastic!  Bought the $5 lobster tails from Albertsons.  Had to cook just a little longer than on recipe.  Bathed in a salt brine for one hour first and used a little Old Bay.

Absolutely delicious.  I made a few variations.  I used Old Bay seasoning and liquid zatarain crab boil.  I did not measure anything just eye balled it.

Easy and tasty!  5 to 10 minutes is a pretty big range, so we split it down the middle and cooked them about 7 minutes (medium sized tails).  Perfect!

I have never made any type of lobster before and I had no idea how to cook it.  So I tried this recipe for a special valentines day menu and it was great.  I followed the recipe as written, but I added some extra Old Bay Seasoning for a little more flavor.  The lobster was nice and juicy. This will definitely be my go to recipe for Lobster Tails. :)

Very good for a romantic dinner and easy too!  It took about 10 minutes for broiling and I used Old Bay instead of paprika.

I would rather steam the lobster than do this again. Putting it in the broiler made the shell smell really funny.The taste was not what I thould it would be like and I love lobster.

This was so easy, but it made me look good.  I used everything but the white pepper, which I dislike.  I used black pepper instead.  But doing the preparation and broiling per the directions worked flawlessly!  We had planned to grill our lobster tails, but rain kept us indoors.  But this was probably better than the grill.  Will definitely use this again.

This was very good.  I moved my first shelf to about 5 1/2" below the broiler and broiled my lobster tails for about 1 1/2 minutes per ounce.  Turned out great, not rubbery, even though they were previously frozen.

So here is what I bought and how I prepared it. My store had a sale...4 oz lobster tails that were previously frozen and now thawed on ice.  So...semi fresh?  They looked pretty fresh.  Anyway...this was the first time I have ever made these and this recipe plus the first two helpful reviews talked me through it easily.  My stove has a choice...low or high broil.  I chose low.  Second rack from the bottom.  Cracked the shell down to the fin.  Drizzled the butter in the crack.  Mixed the butter with the paprika but through in one clove of garlic minced.  Didn't pour ALL of the butter in it.  After ten minutes...checked.  Had NO idea what I was looking for.  haha  Drizzled more butter and stuck it back in for another five minutes.  The shell went from very dark, almost black to a bright red and orange!  I figured...it was done!  I kept the door shut the entire time except when taking it out.  The extra butter was for dipping.  However...it was so perfect that there was no need for dipping!!!  There was no curling either.  Not too shabby for my first time and I impressed my husband!!!

Our lobsters were small and took 5 minutes, but glad to know that 10 oz. takes 10 minutes and 1 pound lobsters take 20. We made these for Father's Day and tested one first. Then we made the rest--in a pyrex dish, which exploded all over the kitchen. Father's Day meal was ruined, but the one lobster we did try ahead of time was FANTASTIC! Note to self: Never broil in pyrex!

Super easy and great taste. We placed the lobster tail on the middle rack and broiled for about 20mins. Our lobsters were about 1/2lb each. I had two on the pan.

I have never cooked lobster before. Our friends gave us six lobster tails from the Keys. Ofcourse I came right to Allrecipes to search for an easy to prepare lobster tail recipe. These came out so delicious! My family was very impressed and I was am very thankful!

Broiling cooks the lobster perfectly, however the lobster will be very bland if you do not season it more. Beautiful presentation if you extract the meat and sit it on top of the shell before broiling.

Just made this. First, I had the giant Costco lobster tails. I am glad I read the comments first. I moved the rack down two levels from the heat element. At about 15 min the shells were burning and the meat was not finished. I suggest that this be made with the more petite grocery store lobster tails. I expect that those will cook nicely under the broiler. These big tails should be boiled or cooked on the out door grill.

Tried this recipe and it was great. I used paprika and the old bay and it gave it a really nice taste. I agree you do have to watch them because they can easily burn. My husband loved them and we will have them again.

Easy and great! Check em every few minutes (after the initial 5) and you can clearly see them go opaque.  I use real butter, if available, and sprinkle with a little old bay.  I cut the shell and the meat to season through and so I can check for temperature.  Recipe is easily adaptable to any size tail, just check them!  The shell might get a bit dark, but that's o.k!  Thanks, Skygretch!

Tried this recipe but my lobsters were a little large so the top half was perfect yet the bottom half was not fully cooked. For larger lobsters, broil the underside(still having the lobster tail in the shell with the meat pulled out) for a few mins. then follow the recipe...

I lined the baking sheet with heavy duty foil for easier clean up; and used smoked paprika.  Lobster tails were on the smaller side so it only took 6 mins low broil on the 2nd shelf of our gas stove.  Tasted great.

This was yummy! A little salty though. I'll use unsalted butter next time. Extremely easy to prepare! I had a couple tails in the fridge that I needed to prepare but I didn't have Old Bay. This was better!

Perfect! My first time making lobster and it was actually rather simple. I used Old Bay instead of the paprika as suggested by other reviews. Mine took about 7 minutes to broil. The only I would do differently is to pull the shell apart a bit more, but other than that it was wonderful!

I read the reviews and was so afraid I would over cook it into hard rubber  that I under cooked it,  then had to recook it.  I agree with everyone else there should be a timer in the recipe like 1 minute for each ounce and more if cooking 4 or more tails at the same time.  I've never had problems with shrimp or crab legs, but this made me nervous.  I'll keep trying though until I get comfortable with it.  :)

Perfect recipe!  The first time I broiled lobster tails I used this recipe.  It walked me through the process and took my fear away, lol.  I have used this time and time again and the lobster always comes out great.

Delicious! I followed suggestions of others and used old bay (my favorite spice) and watched the tails while broiling. Two 5-6oz tails took about 10 minutes. So good!

Easiest way to cook lobster tails. I added a little cooking wine and prepared everything else the same.

This is a simple and wonderful recipe. I added a little lime juice instead of the paprika and used about half the butter. The rest of the butter was used for dipping.

This recipe is pretty good actually!  Quite simple, but gives the lobster tail a punch in taste!  I did change it up a bit.  First, I did cut down the center of the tail, seasoned it with butter, salt and paprika.  Then I put it on the weber and grilled that sucker!  Every few minutes I basted it with melted butter.  It took about 20 minutes to cook (I was using a huge 1lb lobster tail), and the final product was amazing!!  Superb!

Thank you, thank you!  I made a romantic dinner for my husband & myself for New Year's Eve and paired the lobster tails with great tenderloin steaks.  After putting the steaks on, I threw the tails in the oven and everything was done perfectly at the same time.  Awesome!

The flavor was great but I overcooked the lobster and it was kind of tough. I may try this again but with a smaller tail. The one I cooked was nearly a pound.

It was good. The shell started burning so I took it out  after 10 minutes. It was not completely done in the thicker section. Need to open it up more.

Cook time turned out a perfect shell... however, prior to broiling (after cutting the shell) I opened the shell and lifted the meat to position it partially atop the shell...  Made seasoning the tail easier, and of course it presents more elegantly on plate..

Easy peasy!  We love lobster anytime we can get it. This recipe is so easy and delicious. If your tails are larger than 8 oz it will take longer than 5-10 minutes.   We will use this recipe again and again!

This was the very first time I prepared lobster tails (usually my husband makes these for the family). I was on a tight schedule and had quite a few to feed so I wanted quick, easy and delicious. This recipe delivered on all points! My husband was absolutely floored at how tasty this came out with very little effort on my part. Everyone else raved about it. Didn't change a thing and would make it exactly the same way next time!

I used four lobster tails without doubling the amount of butter. I added garlic to the extra butter and we used it for dipping and on bread. Cutting the shell was a little tricky. I did not find it necessary to re-arrange the oven shelves and they broiled in about 7 minutes.

I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day dinner.  .... Delicious!  I made a few adjusts ... I melted the butter along with the following ... 1 minced clove of garlic, a 1/4 tsp of paprika and a 1/4 tsp of smoked paprika  ... I wanted a slightly smokey, sweet flavour while not over powering the other flavours.         Yes, the cooking time instructions are vague ...  all I can say is, thank goodness for GOOGLE!!  *** The rule of thumb is  Broil 5-6 inches from the broiler on HIGH ... *** approximately 1.5 MINUTES PER OUNCE ***   I had (4) 2 oz tails = 3 minutes but decided to add 2 more minutes for good measure ... for a total of 5 minutes and they turned out perfectly! ... tender and juicy ***Youtube is also a great reference on, How to remove the lobster meat from the shell, how to prep for broiling for the WOW factor !!... LOBSTER TAILS 101 is a good one.   This will be a keeper for next year's Valentine's Dinner .

Many reviews had issues with the cook time.  I found this helpful from another recipe:
The lobster tails are done when the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees. The meat may be slightly browned but should be firm to the touch.
Bottom line, use a meat thermometer . . .

I also broil mine but add a bit of water to the pan to just cover the bottom to help cook the tails and keep them from curling. If you split the tails press down on one side of the tail and then the other to separate the tail from the shell but not completely. This helps so you can pull the tail up over the shell. Great recipe!

I have made this recipe for the last 3 years! This is the only way I make lobster, the butter does smoke a lot in the broil so be careful (I used a little bit less butter, a bit more paprika and garlic powder) So good!!

So simple and the timing on the cook time is spot on.  Changed a little by drizzling lemon & paprika butter pre-bake.  Turned out very tender and delicious.

Most people cook lobsters too long, and as a result the meat gets "rubbery". It only takes 12 minutes to boil a 1.25-1.75 lobster without overcooking. New Englanders know this, which is why the lobsters, in every form there, are so good; they're also usually whole, fresh, and unfrozen (the lobsters, not so much New Englanders), which helps. Even previously frozen tails can be great if cooked the proper amount of time (not overcooked).

Great way to cook lobster and turned out well even for an inexperienced chef.  4 stars for the instructions.  No matter the size cook to an internal temp of 135F and it will be perfect.  Had 2 about 5-6 oz tails and took 8 min for one and 10 for the other.

I left out the paprika and white pepper cause I didn't have any. Instead substituted black pepper.  The amount of melted butter for my two 4 oz lobster tails was way too much.  I used maybe about half and that was still a lot.  

For timing, I broiled it on the second from the top rack, for about 6 minutes and it came out perfect!

After many water logged lobster tails that just didn't make the grade, I decided to try broiling.

This recipe is simple and delicious and so long as you don't overcook them, they'll be tender and yummy!

FANTASTIC! Followed as directed but used butter spray on both sides of plumped tails. MMMMMMMM good! Nice big tails also. I thawed frozen tails in refrigerator overnight, unwrapped, split shells and placed in a covered ice bath until ready to broil...Sooooooo good..and I have an electric stove/broiler :-( but they still came out fabulous!

Great and super easy recipe! I didn't pull the meat out of the shell and basted them in butter half way through cooking. I just put paprika and lemon pepper to the butter which was really yummy. Definitely will use this again!

Yum! First time making lobster tails. This was definitely quick and easy. The 1/2 c melted butter was way too much. Since I used a brush on the raw lobster I ended up throwing the remaining butter out. Maybe try 1/4 c melted butter? Other than that, perfect!

Super good, I followed all directions except I was out of white pepper so I used garlic salt instead of regular salt. Super good! I cooked my small lobsters 10 minutes but I will try less next time, maybe 7 or 8 minutes.

This was so yummy and perfect for christmas dinner. So fast and easy! I used less butter for 3 tails and broiled about 5 min. The man at the fish counter cut and cleaned the tails and pulled the meat out onto the top of the shell so they were all ready to broil. My first time cooking lobster and will definitely make again!

Perfect!  based on other reviews, I cooked my 4oz tails for 6 minutes and they were perfect and delicious.  I also followed the advise of others and cut the butter down, reserving the rest for a dipping sauce.

This is good though not amazing. I ate it with a wilted spinach salad, and I can say that i probably enjoued the salad more then the Lobster. Maybe I just don't like the taste of Lobster anymore but following this reciping and then eating it... I wanted crab.  So, those trying this, pick the perfect spices! I will try this next time with Old Bay, and see how that goes.

Turned out great!  Salt, pepper, butter and some Old Bay is all you need to enhance the wonderful natural flavor of lobster. While broiling we really watched them to not overcook. We first had it on low on a low rack in oven but then increased it to high to finish it off. We usually steam lobster but this will be our method from now on.

This was delicious and easy. Beware the salt. My lobsters (frozen) came already salty whatever the store did to them. I use some fresh chopped garlic in the butter and Old Bay instead of paprika.

Super easy! I used to steam my tails and they would always curl up. This is definitely the best method for presentation. Unfortunately I did not get a chance to take a fully presented photo (with the meat pulled up) because the second I put them on a plate, my husband was ready to pounce! He said they were perfect.

I used Old Bay, pink Himalayan salt, freshly ground black pepper, garlic powder, a lemon squeeze, tons of butter and just a sprinkle of raw sugar.

I made no changes, and will definitely make this, again! With an electric oven/broiler, I moved the cooking sheet to the second from the top (cooking element) position. This recipe --  with this timing -- came out perfect! Sweet, tender, and the shells are far easier to cut with kitchen shears than I thought. I think you MUST use real butter, by the way...

Quick, easy and delicious.  Made it in my countertop toaster oven (2 tails).  Put them in as I was plating Chef John's outstanding recipe for Scallops in Corn Cream.  Those two recipes with Basmati Rice and organic mini carrots were my wife's Valentines Day dinner.

This worked great!  Had 4 tails which were about 4 lbs.  Put them under the broiler, set them on the second rack and set the timer for 8 minutes based on other reviews saying they took so long.  After 3 minutes could  smell them and shells were pink. Turned the pan and maybe 3 minutes later shells were starting to blacked so I pulled them and they were cooked perfectly.  Left the meat inside the shell to cook also.  Clearly depends on how close to the top you set your rack  in the oven on the cooking time. Delicious!

These came out perfectly.  It's just important that you don't overcook them.  Also, I made 4-7 oz lobster tails and the recipe as written contained enough butter and spices for all four tails.  I just put a bit of extra paprika on the top of the lobster meat before broiling.  Delicious and thank you.

I broiled for 7 minutes, added Ole Bay seasoning to the mix, and topped with butter before I broiled it. It came out so good!

Simple and elegant. This recipe accentuates the delicate sweetness of the lobster. Yum! Only adjustment was that I needed to broil them a few minutes longer to gain the opaqueness of the meat.

Made this tonight to rave reviews!  A few shakes each of dry spices on each cut lobster tail : powdered garlic, powdered onion and paprika with a drizzle of melted butter on each, about two tbsp total for four tails.  Broil highest rack in the oven for 20minutes.  Baste with juices from the pan and turn off the oven leaving the door open.  Plated some spaghetti (dressed with olive oil, garlic, basil and Parmesan cheese) along with the lobster, just divine.  Served with melted butter for dipping.

Easy and delicious. only change was some minced garlic which I sauted in butter and added with the melted butter over the lobster tails before broiling. I served with prosciutto wrapped asparagus and twice baked potatoes from this site. was a big hit with the family!!

For ease of dining, I recommend removing the lobster meat from the shell before plating.  Wish the recipe had stated that as we ended up with lobster shell pieces amongst the food.

Very tasty, kept to the recipe but did use garlic salt for the salt.  If you're worried about the cooking time just use 1 min for each oz..  But do keep a watch while under the broiler.  At the end when I took the meat out of the tail I let them sit in the lobster juice and melted butter in the pan.

It was so easy to broil the lobster tails. I squeezed on fresh lime juice because I didn't have lemons. Also I used Nature Seasons instead of salt and pepper.  Absolutely delicious, and did I say it was easy??? Yum.

So simple to make!! Love it. I used 6-7 oz lobster tails, cooked on second rack from bottom, oven on broil (I don’t have a degree on my broiler) i place day a skewer under lobster thru tail length wise while cooking to prevent curling. Leave lobster meat inside shell. I also used Old Bay Seasoning in place of paprika. Cooked mine for 12 minutes and was perfect!! I will definitely use this recipe again. Hope this helps others.

5 to 10 minutes is a joke. I weighed my lobster tails, about .75 oz each and idk if my oven is different or what but 20 minutes later my lobster is still broiling and clear on the bottom.  I've never made lobster so this has been a fun adventure trying to tell when its done but i'm confident that clear is a no go lol

Very good way to broil lobster tails, with just the right amount of seasoning.  Did need to follow other reviewers regarding how long to broil for  5-6 oz., as the recipe does not say what size the tails are.....good advice in many of the reviews.

My first time cooking lobster. I did as directed and used all ingredients as suggested.  I'm kind of queasy about cutting up meat . Once I cut up a whole chicken I didn't eat chicken for at least 6 months and vowed never to buy a full bird again. LOL Breaking the shell on my mini lobster tail was a little eww. Think I'll stick to the pros next time I have a hankering. All in all this recipe was great for my first time. Thank you.

We made the old bay seasoning according to a recipe on allrecipes. 1/4 c of butter and the freshly made seasoning for 16 mins or so was enough for a great result. BroIling in low setting on one level higher than the center rack of the oven was perfect. I checked the lobsters in every 5 minutes without opening the oven door. 3 large tails from CostCo which was 1 lb total, tasted perfect! Thanks for the skewer tip that kept them from curling up, and cleaning the vein/intestine that's on the top. I wouldn't have guessed to do that.

This is a great lobster recipe... super easy and good!  Will make it this way regularly now.  I did need to broil it longer than the recipe says.  The inside/bottom of the tail wasn't as done as the outside/top, but that could have been my oven.  Ended up broiling for 15-20 actually.  Not overdone or burnt, so was great!  I also lift the tail meat out of the shell, keeping a bit intact at the end, and resting it over the shell for presentation. Love it!

I will definitely do lobster tails again using this simple yet tasty method for cooking lobster.  I was always too intimidated to try lobster tails at the house. 
I found this recipe easy and convenient, especially since I was baking shrimp scampi.

I made dinner in less than 30 minutes with this great easy recipe for broiled lobster tails.  For sides, I made simple stuffed mushrooms and a few Cajun shrimps. The meal was delicious. Be careful not to leave it in the broil too long or you will have a chewy dry lobster.

I had the spiny lobsters from Micronesia and these lobsters turned out so good! I used ghee instead of regular butter and added crushed garlic to it. I spread the ghee and garlic on the tops of the tails instead of melting it first like the recipe called for. Ghee is clarified butter and this is what you use to dip your boiled lobsters in it. Ghee also works best when using high heat like broiling.

Oh my goodness! This was so excellent! I'm talking restaurant quality! This was my first time ever making lobster and this turned out above expectations! After reading the review that the one girl put that it started smoking I was pretty nervous but it turned out excellent! I used smaller tails and they turned out a little tough but the smaller lobsters usually are. Will definitely make again!

Simple and very tasty. I wanted to keep moisture in (as if steaming them). I placed them on a metal  cooling rack (which had small feet for a little elevation) then placed that on a cookie sheet pan.  I put water on the bottom of cookie sheet, enough to cover the bottom plus a tad more. I also sprinkled a very small amount of garlic powder in the split.

I cut the shell as instructed, and poured a little melted butter with a few dashes of white pepper and granulated garlic.  My lobster tail was only 4 oz., so everything was a guessing game.  Still, a great way to cook lobster!

Simple and good. The tail stays straight and doesn't curl up doing it this way and the taste with just the salt, pepper, and paprika is nice. I used smoked paprika and that enhanced the taste. Good recipe.

Definitely way better than a restaurant! I love the flavoring, and you can't really go wrong with how much seasoning you use. I loved it!

Good way to prevent lobster tails from curling when boiling or steaming is to put skewers through its lengthwise. This should prevent any curling.

very easy and surefire way to cook Lobster tails.   I skewered mine, but that is probably not necessary.  I minced some garlic and sauted it in butter before coating it and popped it in the oven.  I cannot give you accurate times on the cooking time, but I did this for the same about of time that I broiled two medium sized tilapia.  I recoated it once during the cooking process, but wasn't really necessary.   All in all, I would say 13 minutes in the oven at broil.  In hind sight I wish I had put in on convect for a couple of minutes - just for appearance.   It came out very tender and delicious.

The recipe doesn't specify the size of the lobster tails and mine were 6oz. I broiled them for exactly 7 minutes and they were done. The method is great but timing depends on the size. I split the shell and left the meat as it was, pulling the meat up onto the shell would cause it to dry out. I used far less butter, probably 2 Tbs and that was plenty. Thanks skygretch.

Great taste, I just added little bit oregano on top 3 min before removing from oven, that touch made a big difference

This was my first time cooking lobster tails and I was looking for a simple, tasy recipe.  This worked out very well with the only thing being I need to broil it for an additional 5 minutes (total of 14), but I tasted it after 9 minutes and didn't like it -- after 14 minutes (it was lightly browned), excellent.  Maybe this was because I used the LO broil setting instead of the HI setting.  Anyway, I will use this same receipe next time.
