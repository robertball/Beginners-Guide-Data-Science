This is DELICIOUS.  Be sure to use whole seed dijon mustard.  I was afraid the amount of olive oil would make it runny, but it emulsified enough and made a wonderful filling.  I drained my tomatoes for a few minutes so they wouldn't wash out the tart, and baked it in a small stoneware pan.  It did feel and taste like something I would eat in a French bistro or cafe.  Simple, tasty, and divine!  I look forward to making this for girlfriends!

This is truly delicious.  I used a refridgerated pie crust in a regular glass pie pan.  Didn't have fresh herbs so had to use dried.  After placing the ingredients in the pie crust, instead of crimping the edges, I folded the excess over the filling.....about one ince.  I did have to bake it longer to get a nice crisp crust, but it was absolutely to die for.  Even the next day at room temp!  Great recipe...thanks pocohr.  It's a definite keeper.

Followed the recipe as is with changes as per the AR Magazine. 
I also used Roma tomatoes, so as to have less liquid in the pie. I think this helped greatly, since the pie was still just a touch on the too moist side. Also, instead of fresh herbs I used dry. That way they could be added into the pie mix and baked in without being burned. I layered the generously sliced tomatoes half-stacked on one another so that there was basically two layers, to help give the tart some depth. Finally, I had plenty of pie crust left over (home made) so I cut strips and laid criss-cross over the top.
Taste: not as "tangy" as the recipe name would indicate. Not sure how to do it, but if the "tangy" factor could be raised would really be a great dish. However, was quite a nice dish. Even as a leftover it was good.
Will definitely make again.

"One of the top ten best" per hubby!  We ate the entire tart for a light dinner.  Fresh garden tomatoes were used along with oregano and thyme from the herb garden.  I did use all of the tips in the AR Premier magazine:  1) Used a 400 degree oven.  2) Dust the pie crust with flour before spreading paste.  3) Used a blender to make the paste.  4) Topped the tart with the one sprig of oregano and thyme after it was baked.  5) Magazine time was shortened to 40 minutes due to the increased oven temperature; mine was done closer to 35 minutes.  Thank you pocohr and AR for bringing this delight to our table!

I find this to be overly sweet.  I think the fresh tomatoes are overpowered by the honey.  I think I will try it again but cutting back on the honey, maybe 1/2 teaspoon at most.

Thank you for this delish and beautiful recipe! My slight variation....I did not butter the pie plate and I pre-baked the dough in the pie plate, for 10 minutes, so that it wouldn't become soggy. I used beautiful and meaty heirloom tomatoes and then lessened the honey and added extra garlic, per my family's taste. It was unbelievably yummy, easy to make, and very pretty. Thanks again for sharing this great recipe!

I thought this was good, but if I make it again, I will either greatly reduce the amount of honey or completely eliminate it.  I think I would have enjoyed it much more if it were way less sweet.  Otherwise, it is a lovely and different way to serve garden fresh tomatoes.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, pocohr!

I think the 6 Tablespoons of olive oil is a mistake and should be 6 teaspoons (2 TBS.)  Noticed when blending that it was way to runny to "spread" as the recipe stated, so made a second batch with 2 TBS. and that was much closer to what the recipe described.  On the whole, it really wasn't very tasty, so will not be making it again.

I made this recipe the other day and have to agree, the recipe calls for way too much oil.  I will be making it again though because I did like it.  But will either be cutting back the oil to 1 Tablespoon or perhaps leaving it out altogether.  Thanks for sharing!

I liked this tart. I used dried herbs and non grainy Dijon. I also used Agave (1tsp) instead of honey. I did put a dusting of flour on the shell bottom, and reduced the amount of olive oil to about 4 tablespoon. Tasty!

Made this last night. Didn't have a pie crust so used croissant dough. Found the honey to be too sweet for my taste. My husband really liked it. Will make again without the honey.

I liked the taste, but it had way too much olive oil!!  Swimming in it.  Upset  my stomach.  If I make it again I will cut that way back.

I used a 9 inch crust and it still turned out great! I also used raw honey and fresh shredded Parmesan. I didn't think it was too sweet, as one reviewer mentioned- but I do think I will try using just a teaspoon of mustard instead of 1.5 teaspoons. All in all, my family found this very tasty and SO EASY to make!
