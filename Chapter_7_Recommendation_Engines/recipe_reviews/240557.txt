Oh Yum!! I made this for an after dinner treat tonight and loved it! I made an Italian hot chocolate from scratch - Cioccolata Calda (Hot Chocolate Italian-Style) that wasn't too sweet and loved the addition of Bailey's and Crème De Cacao. Topped my cup with some whipped cream and it was a divine drinkable dessert. Good recipe ellie, one I'm sure to be enjoying a lot this winter.

As the creator of this recipe I encourage you to tweak it to your heart's content…Creamy chocolatey and very easy to make with just a few ingredients. Looks pretty in an Irish Coffee glass with a dollop of whipped cream on top… great for the Holidays or any day … brings a smile like a warm hug… :)))

Used your ingredients and topped the hot chocolate with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Absolutely decadent! Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful winter cocktail!
