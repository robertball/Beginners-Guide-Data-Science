Made this dish with pumpkin, potatoes, onions, beets and carrots. Everything else kept the same and it came out really good!

Tried this tonight - didn't use all the specified veggis - varied a bit based what we had at home (carrots, potatoes, onion with the pumpkin), however the spices and other ingredients were the same and was loved by all in the family.

I should of trusted my instinct when I felt 1 tsp. of ground clove was going to be overpowering. This didn't turn out well for my tastes.

Great recipe. I didn't have all spice so I used cinnamon and cumin.  Also turned out great! .
