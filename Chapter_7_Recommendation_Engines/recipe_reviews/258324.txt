The best lemon cookie I've ever had. It's so soft and tender, and the nutmeg is perfect with the lemon extract -- never would've thought they'd go so well together. I didn't use the nuts, and unless you're a major nut fan, I wouldn't because the melt-in-your mouth texture would be disrupted. Definitely going to make again!

I made this recipe because it contained ingredients that I had on hand.  Well, at least I thought I did.  Turned out I didn't have quite enough sugar or raisins.  I already had the rest of the dry ingredients sifted together so I decided to go ahead with the amount of sugar that I had.  Boy am I glad I did!!!!  This is my new all-time favorite cookie recipe.  I was about half a cup short of sugar to put in the dough and then didn't have any to sprinkle on top.  These wonderful cookies do not need the extra sugar.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  It will be my go-to cookie recipe from now on!

These make a very nice sized batch.  The dough is easy to work with even though it is on the softer side, I used the size small pampered chef cookie scoop and they dispensed with ease.  These are definitely better the next day.  1/2 tsp lemon extract seemed like a small amt. for the size batch.  I added the zest of one lemon and I'm glad I did.  When I tasted them after they cooled, they were nothing special in taste; very mild even with the zest.  The texture is wonderful though, as others have stated.  They are pillowy soft and delicate.  They are not overly sweet, even with the sugar sprinkled on top.  The next morning, I tasted them again, and they did taste a bit more lemony.  these could easily withstand a light lemon glaze without being overpowering.  I used fresh grated nutmeg, which I prefer for better nutmeg flavor.  It is slight but there.  I would make these again using a light lemon glaze and some non-pareil sprinkles for presentation.  On a cookie tray, they are a bit bland looking.

This recipe make the most delicious lemon cookies that melt in your mouth. I didn't have lemon extract so I used the juice from a whole lemon + a little bit of lemon zest. I recently purchased coconut flour and wanted to use it, so I used half flour and half coconut flour. These cookies have great flavor and are super pillowy soft.

I did not have lemon extract and instead added fresh lemon and rind, as another reviewer mentioned. I would add dried cranberries next time. The texture of the cookie  was soft and fluffy. Wonderful.

This recipe works very well.  It is very dainty and gentile.  I think I might add a bit more lemon to give a bit more punch but that is personal preference.  I made them larger, a tbsp full at least each and doubled the baking time.   They are lovely.
