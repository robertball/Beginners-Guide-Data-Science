This was a great recipe my family loved it.  It takes a little time to fry them so I spread foil on a cookie sheet covered it with a tablespoon of oil breaded the ravioli's and baked them at 350 for about 20 minutes Yummy!  Thanks for the recipe.

While this tastes okay, it's absolutely NOT like the traditional St. Louis toasted ravioli, and shouldn't be called by that name!  St. Louis toasted ravioli is not cheese filled, it's stuffed full with seasoned beef!  The real stuff is much much better!

These are so great.  I like to use meat ravioli from the refriderated section.  I have also baked them in an attempt to make them healthier.  They turn out okay if you bake on a rack.  Bread them per the recipe then spray lightly with cooking spray.  I cook in the oven for about 30 minutes at 350 or until they are toasty.

This recipe was AWESOME and so easy to make.  I used 1/2 cheese ravioli and 1/2 meat ravioli and we can't decide which we liked better.  I put the breadcrumbs in a bag and mixed the raviolis in there - made the job go much quicker.  Thanks, Barb!

These were great! I added an extra egg to make the "wash" a little thicker and fried them in my fry daddy which took only seconds to cook. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and cooked them frozen. (great idea) Hubby wasn't interested and wanted a burger instead, but when he saw the kids eating them he asked to taste "one". One turned into many and with the addition of a salad he was no longer interested in his burger! Thanks, Barb; I'll definitely be using these as an appetizer at my next party!

This was an outstanding dish!!! I followed the advice and kept the ravioli frozen and after I breaded the raviolis I put them in the freezer for 15 minutes,  then layered them (one layer at a time)in my deep fryer on 350 for about 1 minute. I served them with gnocchis and a salad for dinner and they were a hit!!!

Just a note.. as a St. Louisan who worked at a popular restaurant there.. it is much easier if you leave the raviolis frozen when you soak and bread them.  Then freeze the breading on and fry them frozen.. it is much more user friendly!!

Super fast and easy, especially if you put the Ravioli and bread crumb in a ziploc to coat. Oh, I almost forgot, very yummy!

How can you not like these.  I am from St. Louis, and am so glad that these are from my hometown.  Hubby has co-workers from Seattle that just love this stuff.  Hard to imagine that you can't get these on a reglar basis everywhere.  Thanks again for the reminder of this great recipe.

This is a variation of one of the best methods of cooking ravioli and it is unique to St. Louis.  You gotta try it.  Just try brushing the ravioli in egg white wash and then bread crumbs.  And try condensed milk instead of regular milk.  But try it.  This is a great dish but use a good ravioli or make you own cheese or beef ravioli.

I've never made toasted ravioli before, but I've eaten plenty of them at restaurants and at the fair.  This recipe was so simple and they tasted just like the ones I've spent tons of money on!  I completely forgot to sprinkle them with Parmesan cheese after frying, but they still tasted fantastic dipped in Four Cheese spaghetti sauce.  I doubled the recipe, but even with 24 large raviolis, we didn't use even close to 16 ounces of spaghetti sauce.  I recommend pouring a small amount of sauce into a dipping bowl and refilling it as needed.  That way the extra sauce can be saved for another use.

I added additional spices to my bread crumbs (onion/garlic powders, oregano, basil, red pepper flake) and I used meat filled frozen ravioli. My sauce was homemade marinara. We loved this. Next time, I'll know to make a recipe and a half as my husband wanted more than the recipe made. I'd like to try this next time as a baked toasted ravioli, to cut back on the fat content some. As is, very good.

These are pretty good. I think I prefer them baked then fried.  I took the suggestions from a few other reviews and baked them in the oven at 375 for 30 minutes. Also sprayed some grease on the pan before placing the coated ravioli on there.

Very good!  To make the breading process easier I placed the breadcrumbs in a resealable plastic bag (I also added a couple tablespoons of Romano cheese) and then added the ravioli and shook them until coated.  This was much easier than breading each ravioli separately, especially since I used small ravioli.  Will definitely make again.

This was one of the recipes I have missed since leaving St. Louis but no more - this is exactly how I remembered it.  I also kept the raviolis frozen and it turned out perfect. Now if I can only find the St. Louis pizza recipe to go along with it.

my boyfriend is from the st louis area and missed these very much after moving. he likes them best when made with meat ravioli, so i used those. the recipe itself was perfect, the only part we didn't like was the flavor of the meat filling of the frozen ravioli i used. now if i could just find a great recipe for meat ravioli...

Sorry ~~but I do not know what I did wrong.  This is the first recipe I tried from Allrecipe that didn't come out good. I used fresh ravioli & followed recipe exact. I was making these for an appetizer to bring to a dinner party. I ended up not bringing them. My husband & I are wondering if the ravioli were not good. They had a good experation date & seemed ok. When you cut it opened after it was cooked it was like a glob of dough in side. Real wierd. I have made fried ravioli before but not this recipe.  Sorry.. :( Nana

So glad I came across this recipe, although they are not unique to St. Louis.  These were (and I'm sure still are) very popular at the steak houses we use to go to in Omaha.  These are very good and remind of going out to eat as a child.

SERIOUSLY GOOD!!! This recipe is perfect as far as the ravioli prep. Instead of regular ole spaghetti sauce, I used one 7 1/2 oz. can of El Pato Tomato Sauce (for its bite) and simmered it with two cloves of garlic and one quarter onion and ended up with one hell of a dipping sauce for this appetizer. This one is one recipe I won't forget for an unexpected crowd pleaser.

Thumbs up from the Ozarks! Thank you for the recipe--the boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed the ravioli. 
I tried coating them first with a coarser type of Panko bread crumb, but it didn't stick to them very well, so I added some of the finer type of Panko bread crumbs, and it worked very well. I also used a small fryer to do the frying.

Excellent. I could not stop eating the ravioli and I don't even like ravioli. I used great value beef ravioli from w**lmart, progresso italian bread crumbs and classico tomato & basil sauce. I actually dipped my ravioli in the sauce instead of pouring it over the ravioli. The taste reminds me of sausage pizza and I had a salad on the side.  Loved it!!

I actually have been making these for a couple years. My 10 year old son loves them! He gets them any time he can when we eat out. I make them a little healthier. I use egg white instead of the whole egg, shake and bake in place of bread crumbs (Not for health but for better coating), let them set (dry after coated) and I use frozen Spinach and Cheese Ravioli (Mama Rosie's). This cuts the fat dramatically @ 6-8 grams less fat @ 2-3 grams more fiber per serving and he hardly knows the difference. I also use GrapeOla or Enova oil to fry them in, In a small frying pan, so I use less oil.

I know I would have enjoyed this recipe 10 times better if my husband hadn't bought some nasty tasting ravioli. (Prosciutto and Mozzarella I believe.)  I went ahead and gave this 5 stars because my disappointment was my own fault but definitely would have been great had I used cheese ravioli instead. I served this with a marinara sauce from this site.

These are GREAT!  I did a combo of portobello mushroom ravioli and spinich, feta cheese & artichoke stuffed rigatoni, delicious.  Everybody chowed these down, we dipped them in the "best marinara sauce yet" recipe from this site.  Thanks Barb!

Very good and a change from the usual ravioli! I breaded them early in the day and froze them. I saw that others wanted to speed up the time and baked them instead. I did what the recipes said to do and it took me 10 mins tops! Just took out of freezer and put right into skillet. Depending on the skillet size you can place about 8 - 10 raviolis in the pan. Good recipe!

PARTY PLEASER! They're an awesome little toasty finger food for parties or guests. I can't wait for BBQ season to start and I can toss these out on the table while we grill up some steaks and sausages. 

I have made these several times since, and will continue making them. I keep frozen ravioli on hand for just such a need. lol

I used evaporated milk to dip these in, as I was out of both whole milk and eggs.  It worked fine.  I also baked these in a 375 oven for 20 minutes.  My 6 year old gobbled these up so fast I thought I was going to have to make another batch for everyone else.

These were very yummy! My hubby prefers to eat baked vs. fried at home, so sprayed w/cooking spray and baked at 425 degrees for about 10 min. Used beef ravioli; Turned out great! Thanks for the recipe.

These are great! I made them "skinny" by baking them in the oven at 350 instead of frying them.  I used skim mild also instead of whole milk.  I just sprayed the tops with cooking spray and placed them on a cookie sheet to bake until brown I didn't even need to turn them over.  They were delicious!  My kids loved them.

Having grown up in St. Louis, it is a given that I like these! I used meat ravioli (homemade). For an interesting twist, after they are fried - sprinkle with shredded (not grated) parmesan cheese and "toast" under broiler for a few seconds. This makes them even toastier and the cheese melts better if shredded instead of grated.

This recipe is similar to our "toasted tortellini" recipe.  All the same ingrediants are included only we use cheese-filled tortellini and add 1 tsp of all season salt to the italian bread crumbs. We dip them in pizza sauce and every enjoys them. Using tortellini, we take them out while the deep fryer is heating up, which allows them to remain mostly frozen and cooking takes only 30 seconds, depending how crispy/brown you want them.  I can't imagine that ravoili would be much different so if they're still frozen inside, you didn't cook them long enough. No matter what cheese-filled pasta is used, they are are tasty bite-sized snack!

ABsolutly incredible!!! So so Yummy! It's just so simple that I can't believe it tastes as good as it does! I addes more salt to the crunb mixture as well as pepper and dried Basil. I also addes freshly grated romano cheese to the mix so there would be a slight gooeyness to the crumb coating and it worked out great! The cheese didn't melt everyehre in the oil at all. This would also be great w/ a creamy alfredo sauce on the side for dipping and also a creamy pesto sauce would work great as well! Thank you so much, I will be making this many more times to come!

These came out ok.. I tried both fried and baked and baking them tasted much better without the added grease. Definitely need the Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.

Very okay. Might depend on the sauce you use. Also, Even with the egg batter I had trouble getting the bread crumbs to completely stick. Also was unsure of how to thaw frozen ravioli.

Fantastic and easy recipe!  I made some with beef ravioli and some with Italian sausage ravioli and they were a huge hit with my kids and my hubby.  Served them for dinner with a green salad and fresh fruit for a great summer meal.  I highly recommend that you try these!

I have been living here in St. Louis for 34 years and we make this with meat raviolis.  I put mine on a tin-foiled pan sprayed with cooking spray.  I sprinkled parmesan cheese on the ravs then sprayed with cooking spray.  Cooked perfectly at 350 for 20 mins.   Serve with beer to truly be St. Louis!

These are really great.  They are different and the taste is delicious.  They would make good appetizers as well as a main dish with side salad and fresh bread.  I used chicken herb and broccoli cheese ravioli.  Would make again for sure.

The concept of this was much better than the actual result. I think it's because I used a poor quality store bought pasta. I used Buitoni, and the pasta was rubbery and dry. Ugh. The coating was delicious, though, so I would be willing to give it another try, but with much better pasta. I used my homemade marinara sauce as a dip instead of jarred spaghetti sauce, and added some garlic powder to the coating.

This is a great recipe.  I too am from St. Louis and have grown up with toasted ravioli.  I followed others' suggestions and baked rather than fried and worked out nicely.  Covered cookie sheet with foil, oiled it, and baked at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes.  This was just easier and healthier than deep frying.  As an aside, if you ever have a chance to get Mama Toscano raviolis in St. Louis they are too die for.  They are offered in some of the restaurants and sold in the italian grocery stores. You can order online as well.  They are pricey but just incredible. The have both regular and toasties!

Yummy! I tried frying them before thawing, but they were cold on the inside. I thawed the ravioli by sticking them in the microwave for 2 minutes and they were perfect. My husband loved it!

I did coat the ravioli with flour first for the 2nd half I cooked and those did a lot better!  I also used panko bread crumbs and they were a little more difficult to get them to stick but the crunch was so nice!  Fun treat.

I made this for a family get together and it is now a staple appetizer of any party I throw!  It was easy to make and the taste was fantastic!  I occasionally order this in restaurants, and this recipe is just as good as what they serve.  Thanks for a fantastic appetizer!

These are terrific! I have made them twice. The first time the breading did not stick real well. My son advised me to "double dip" them in the egg and bread crumbs and this worked much better.  Be sure to sprinkle fresh grated parmesan while they are stil hot.

GREAT!  The only thing better would be to hand make your raviolis at home.  I use beef ravs, the cheese ones tasted funky to me. I also add crushed red pepper flakes to the bread crumbs.  I great fresh parmesan on top of them before serving and make my own homemade marinara for dipping.  Im from St. Louis and like taking this to people's homes here in Phoenix to give them a taste of THE HILL....

Really good.  I used tortellini because I didn't have ravioli.  They were especially good hot, but once they started to cool they got a little hard.  The family liked them, but thought that too.  I'll try them with ravioli next time.

We had this the other night and we absolutely loved it!  My hubby and I are not too crazy about cheese ravioli, my hubby prefers meat, but I wanted to prepare exactly as directed.  We will try the Meat Ravioli next time.  Thanks Barb for a great meal!

I made these as an appetizer.  They were extremely easy to make.  Everyone enjoyed them. A couple of my guests made comments that you could make these for a main course and that they liked them better than just plain ravioli with sauce.  I will definitely make these again.

Made this tonight. followed to a "t" and it was awesome! This recipe is pretty much how it was made in the late 1930's and early 1940's when toasted ravioli was created. the origins say it was either Oldani's or a restaurant known commonly as Angelo's were the first to make it... fillings used were veal,beef or a cheese mix.

As a St. Louis native, I know good toasted ravioli! You can't find it where I live, so I was pleased to come across this. I made it for a gathering and everyone raved. Meat filled ravioli is hard to find here, but the cheese was good. :)

Tried these last night for dinner and Oh My Gosh! they are so addictive. Loved it. I  used the beef frozen ravioli and added my own italian seasoning to my plain bread crumbs (so I can control the sodium). I used my fry daddy to fry each square. For the spaghetti sauce, I used Bertoli marinara with burgundy wine- so good. This recipe will definitely be used often as my kids loved it too. Thank you Barb, for sharing.

I place mine on a cookie sheet and spray with butter flavor pam and bake them at 375 until they are brown and puffed.  Les fat, don't have to stand over grease and get popped and just as crunchy as they are if they were fried.

I made these as a party appetizer and they were a HIT!  I have to admit, I par-boiled them b/c it seems they would have been very tough had I not.  After boiling, I laid out on a sheet pan so they weren't touching and refrigerated until cool.  I also dredged lightly in flour before egg and breadcrumbs.  It really makes a nice crust.  I'm glad I did these extra steps, b/c I would have been disappointed if they came out any differently than they did.

My husband took a bite then asked what I had done to the pasta.  He then struggled his way through the rest of the dish, and once finished, he asked me not to make it again.  Not a good review from him at all.

These were fantastic!! We had a mix of cheese and meat ones and we liked the meat ones better. I baked these in the oven instead of frying them but I did spray the pan and the ravioli with butter spray and they tasted like they were fried.

I think should I ever have a crowd over for dinner, this would make a great appetizer! Maybe put out different sauces...ranch, pizza sauce, as well.  My entire family enjoyed the cheese ravioli's, however, I also cooked up some beef filled ones. They did not go over as well.  We will probably make this CONCEPT again, but try our hand at making homemade ravioli's.

I've made this recipe before and it was fine. Tonight I tried the baking method. 26 minutes @ 350 degrees is too long for thawed ravioli. Just a reminder for myself & and an FYI for others.

Fridays are for pizza.  If not, I make it simple. Followed exact recipe.  Son took a look and said he'd get something at the HS football game later.  Next thing I know, they were gone with a mumble that they were good and to make them again!  Fun, easy, and delicious!

This is a really easy, good recipe. My husband (very picky) really liked them. I had to get him to help me with them because of a review of someone else,(thank you) I double dipped the ravioli before frying. That took some time, but then the little devils cooked really fast and I had trouble dipping, cooking and sprinkling cheese when they were done. So my husband helped fry them and sprinkle cheese. I followed the recipe to the letter this time but next time I might add a little garlic powder or basil to the bread crumbs. I have even thought about using Panko...we will see. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I thought these tasted great.  I added a little ground beef to the sauce.  Next time I will use less ravioli or more egg mixture cause it didn't seem to coat the Ravioli well enough to get them totally breaded.  I also used a fry daddy and cooked them for about 2 1/2 minutes.

We decided to bake these because of health reasons and they were just ok.  I think they would have been better had we fried them like the recipe states-but they still would need a bit more flavor for our tastes.  My husband votes for me to make this again, but I'm not so excited.

Love these addictive raviolis!  The only alteration that I have made is that once the raviolis are cooked, the natural stickyness of the noodle holds the bread crumbs, I never egg/milk bath them.  The meat filled ones are great also!!

These were great!  I used panko breadcrumbs for crunch and seasoned them well.  I tasted them until I had the seasoning the way I wanted it.  Also, make sure your ravioli are thawed well and dry before you start...this will help the breading to stick!

These were very tasty - I used Panko bread crumbs, which made them nice and crispy.  Seasoned my panko with garlic salt and some italian seasoning.  My 4-year old loved them!

This makes a very quick & easy appetizer (would be great for a cocktail party). I used frozen ravioli which I just cooked for a little longer at a slightly lower temp. By using a ravioli you already love, you can't go wrong!

My dad loves toasted ravioli and so I tried this out on him and the rest of my family when my brother came home from Iraq and it was a huge hit!  My husband never had toasted ravioli so I made it for him another time because he wasn't there and he loved this!  He asks me to make this all the time now!  Love it!

Another fabulous treat! Made these for super bowl and there were none left! Every time I turned around my daughter had one in her hand. Crispy, cheesy, and delicious. Served with my home made marinara sauce and shaved fresh parm on top. After frying them, I drained and transfered them to a cookie sheet and kept them in the oven on warm and they stayed perfect. I was hesitant about the frying because we are trying to eat healthier, but they were not greasy at all. I cant wait to make these again!

Really good and easy to make.  Since I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs, I added Italian seasoning to plain bread crumbs.  I also used egg substitute (1/4 cup) instead of an egg since it's easier to bread stuff that way and skim milk instead of whole since that's what I had on me.

For cooking, I poored in only enough oil so that it covered about the bottom half of the raviolis.  This seemed to cook them nicely and they didn't get greasy.  I flipped them after they turned brown on the bottom side and cooked until they turned brown.

Unlike some others, I didn't have a problem with the cheese not melting.  I think it's the kind of ravioli being used.  I used a whole wheat and all natural cheese ravioli that worked really well with this recipe.

My partner, originally from St. Louis, has talked about this dish forever, since he's never been able to find them any place else.  Lo and behold I decided to Google it, and where should I discover the recipe, other than at this site, one of my faves.  Anyway, we both agree with the majority of comments -- great dish, but it would be even better with meat-filled ravioli.  I also double-breaded them, which is a must-do too.  Once done I placed them in a casserole dish, sprinkled with freshly grated parmesan and let warm in the oven for @ 5 minutes.  I will definitely make this again.  The next time I will likely follow Chef Tara's suggestion and chill for a few minutes after the initial breading, before deep frying.

this is a great recipe!i tried using the meat ravioli for my bf and he even liked the cheese better..i use italian style panko breadcrumbs, makes it crispier and full of flavor! i make a 1lb bag and they are gone fast! we use bertolli olive oil and garlic sauce for dipping. so yummy! also it does help to let them sit in the freezer for a few mins after you bread it..makes the breadcrumbs stick better. thanks!!

This recipe was good and very easy to do.  BUT, if you are gonna call it St. Louis toasted ravioli you have to know that in St.Louis we use meat raviolis not cheese.  Cheese is my favorite food and Im sure I eat to much, but with this you must use meat raviolis.  And I also wanted to say that even though it says "toasted" it is deep fried.  I use my fry daddy for these.

This is to LEASTMAN. I tried this recipe tonight, and it was tasty. The ravioli's I got were the refrigerated ones and were kind of hard coming out of the box, so I boiled them for a couple of minutes and they softened up, and melted the cheese as well. Try this.

The ravioli recipe was really good.  I did change it a little bit.  I baked the ravioli in a 450 degree oven for 15-20 minutes.  Not quite as good as when they are fried, but a little healthier. Will make these again with different kinds of ravioli.

I am from St. Louis and I can vouch for these T.Ravs, they are excellent and very authentic. I have a small deep fryer that I use instead of a pan and I think that makes a difference.

We thought these were pretty good.  I did add some garlic powder to the breadcrumbs.  I also added some Panko breadcrumbs for extra crispiness and drained on a rack so the bottom stayed crispy.

I would give this recipe 3 1/2 stars.  It needs some kick added to the breading, beyond dipping in marinara sauce.  I will make them again, but spice up the bread crumbs a bit.

These were definitly not worth the mess or the taste!  The frying made a mess in my kitchen...I followed other reviewers advice and kept the ravioli's frozen....the insides remained frozen, while the outsides were too crisp...I will stick with eating these out in a restaurant as a treat!  Believe me, not worth the time or trouble!

Very good recipe.  Will definately make this again.  My kids and husdand loved it, but I made beef and cheese ravioli and we thought the beef was better.  It does take a little time to fry all the ravioli, but it's worth it.  Thanks!!!!

Yummy. All of my kiddos loved it right down to the two year old. Not very healthy but definitely an occasional treat.

These are excellent, I actually went through battering process twice with the ravioli as I had read in another dish, to make them more crisp . Labor intensive to double that process but provides great results.

oh these turned out fantastic.  mine were slightly bland, but i didn't have italian seasoned bread crumbs so i used the parmesan herb planko ones i had on hand.  i blame the blandness on myself.

Instead of frying them, I decided to bake them in the oven for a healthier and easier clean-up. Bad mistake. The ravioli got so dried out and chewy, and it wasn't crispy at all. Also, the flavor was extremely bland. I guess that this was my fault for following someone else's suggestion, but I'm extremely disappointed.

Totally reminds me of home! This is a great (and easy) way to replicate what you get in the freezer section when your freezer section doesnt carry toasted ravioli.

These were absolutely wonderful! My husband, who does not care for cheese ravioli that much, loved them and I had to almost fight for them. The cheese and sauce just made them even better.

This is a tasty recipe, but substitute the cheese ravs for meat ravioli. I've never had cheese filled toasted Ravs in St. Louis and the meat filled is much better.

I added meat and sauce as someone suggested. I also attempted to put them under broiler at 375 as someone suggested but the came out a little rubbery on the edges. Another reviewer said 350....will try that next time.

We have made this.  It's a good sub when we can't get to Stl for the real thing.  The only thing I'd add is that StL toasted ravs are traditionally made with beef ravioli.  Also, if you're a purist, you'll want to be sure to pair this with a sweet tomato sauce.

Oh man, these are GOOD. I've never made (or even eaten) toasted ravioli before, but these were easy to make and so delicious. I used skim milk instead of whole and didn't bother thawing the ravioli. I found that it's important to make sure the ravioli are only getting a thin coating of the egg mixture; if too much egg falls into the bread crumbs, they'll clump and become pretty much unusable. I'll definitely be making these again.

We also used beef ravioli, plain breadcrumbs (added our own seasonings) and withheld the milk. And they turned out pretty good. I hate frying stuff,but am leary of baking! Dont know if theyd turn out as crispy baking as they did frying. Am making them again soon!

I used beef ravioli, as did many others.  I fried half and baked half.  The fried half went over better but we liked both.  My 3 kids, and I, loved them.  Hubby thought they were just "ok".  I made a pretty big batch so I just kept the finished raviolis in a warm oven until we were ready to eat.  I'll be making these again soon, I'm sure.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm from St. Louis so had to try this recipe, but I've never had toasted ravioli with cheese inside, it's always beef.  I made this with beef ravioli and was pleasantly surprised that it was quite good.  I have made homemade toasted ravioli before it was a lot of work.  This was quite easy & pretty tasty.  Next time I will try baking it to make it slightly healthier.

I agree with other reviews this was not good with cheese ravioli. I ended up with a rubbery lump of cheese in the middle. Not good and most of them ended up in the garbage which was disappointing because they are time consuming. I may try them again with a seasoned beef ravioli.

This was really good but I used skim milk to try and cut the calories and well the dish was dry...so I think next time I will just follow the recipe and use whole milk. I also add basil, oregano, and salt to the bread crumbs to taste and it worked perfect. Will definitely make again!

I make this recipe at virtually every party that I have, and it is always a hit! I omit the milk if I don't have it, but I've noticed the texture of the coating is a bit better with it. Delicious!

These were awesome...easy to prepare and tasted amazing!  I used panko breadcrums seasoned with salt and pepper, garlic powder, and and Italian seasoning blend.  Crunchy and delicious!  Will certainly make again.

This was good. I made it for a "ladies night" I hosted last month. I used fresh small cheese ravioli. Used marinara sauce for dipping.  While I did like it I probably won't make again. I will say this - my husband and I both thought it tasted even better the next day cold - right out of the fridge.

These were delicious! I doubled the recipe, so the frying was a little time consuming, but worth the effort! I will definitely make them again! My husband loved them dipped in marinara, my son liked them plain and I loved them dipped in ranch dressing.

I used tortellini instead of the ravioli and also baked them as someone suggested. Sure, not quite the same, but no frying and healthier for me. I baked them (from frozen) for a total of 30 minutes, flipping them all after 15 minutes. Next time I'll do 20, because 30 minutes was too much. They don't need to be browned, because the cheese just needs to be hot. 30 minutes later they were a tad hard/crispy.

I moved from St Louis a few years ago, and have craved this STL classic pretty much ever since.  This recipe tastes just like it does in the restaurants, and is unbelievably simple to make.  I double breaded Buitoni ravioli, & it turned out AmAzInG!  Thank you for posting this recipe; you helped a military wife feel like she was home!

I made my own fresh bread crumbs and added herbs and garlic salt. The recipe turned out great! Be sure to use good quality ravioli or the recipe will taste only okay. We used our favorite marinara sauce and homemade alfredo sauce to dip and we loved it! I will make this again in the future for all of our get togethers.

These were really good, but I wish we had used beef ravioli instead of cheese. I double breaded as many have suggested, and I think it made a huge difference. Also, I stuck in the freezer after breading for about 10 mins.
I can not stress enough THE QUALITY OF THE RAVIOLI USED WILL MAKE OR BREAK THIS RECIPE.....Unfortuantely I used average frozen cheese and they were ok, but not good enough for company. Had I used a superior product, these would have been much better.
All in all, will definitely make again.

Made these for my ladies Bunco night and they were a hit.  Only gave it four stars because I found that the pasta seemed a little hard and chewy and once they get cold, they get really hard and chewy.  I'll make this again, but next time I might try actually cooking the ravioli first and then breading and frying to see if that makes a difference in the pasta texture.

These were great! I had never heard of toasted ravioli before. I stayed very close to the recipe, only increasing the parmesan cheese in the bread crumbs. I didn't double bread as some have suggested and they were perfect without it. Once they were done I laid them out on a cookie sheet and sprinkled mozzarella over top and set them in the oven to reheat a bit and melt the cheese. I also doctored up our favorite marinara sauce with minced garlic, dried minced onion and italian seasonings so that it wouldn't taste like the same old pasta dinner dressed up differently. Everything was wonderful! I will definitely make this again!

These are a favorite at our house. Two inches of oil is way too much. You only need 3 tbsp of olive oil. These are supposed to be "toasted" not deep fried. Also, I like to add a 1/2 cup parmemsan cheese to the breadcrumb mixture.

I worked at the Olive Garden for my entire college career and lived on their toasted ravioli every Friday and Saturday night.  When I saw this recipe I knew I had to try it.  I used beef ravioli instead of the cheese ravioli the recipe calls for and they tasted exactly like the ones I had while working at the Olive Garden!  This is an excellent recipe!!!

I always wanted to try fried raviolis and I'm glad I did.  Recipe was great.  I used Barilla Marinara sauce with this dish.  I think I might experiment and try to let the frozen ravilios thaw a little so the bread mixture sticks better.

I love fried ravioli, but I have yet to end up with a perfect ending to this recipe.  Either the raviolis are done on the outside and cold inside, or they explode in the fryer!  Perhaps my deep fryer is to blame.  I will continue my attempts the perfect fried raviolis!!

Looked fantastic, smelled wonderful, tasted pretty darned boring, the marinara was the only thing that saved it, think I'll use the idea and change it to a "zippier" ravioli?!?!?!?

So good, in fact, that once I tried the recipe on my immediate family members, I decided that this recipe would be used for one of the appetizers at a family gathering that takes place each year. However, when it came to the family gathering, I made the recipe with cheese- and beef-filled ravioli. I made one package of each, thinking it would be plenty -- adults and children alike were still asking if there were more. These were absolutely easy to make and quite delicious. I would highly recommend them! When trying them out with the family, I served an Italian tossed salad and Parmesan garlic bread with them to round out the meal. I just served the fried raviolis and spaghetti sauce for the appetizers at the family gathering.

Mine turned out really dense and chewy and I don't know why. They tasted good though. Just hard to get the teeth through...

So good!!   Didn't quite know what to expect but they sounded so intriguing that I just had to try!!  Glad I did!!   I made up the entire package for just the 2 of us…way too much…but they are good heated up the next day as well.     Followed recipe as written.

Made as the recipe states this is just OK. Pretty bland for the most part. BUT I've made this several times and with a heavy hand at seasoning you can make this have tons of flavor. I've experimented abit and use plenty of grated parmesan, salt, garlic powder, oregano, basil and a good pinch of cayenne pepper. With these additions the taste is fabulous.

These were really tasty - almost like Mozzarella sticks but without the stringy cheese. I forgot the add the Parmesan at the end but found they didn't need it. Also, we just used about 1/4 inch of oil in the frying pan and it worked fine.

I tried this recipe and Giada's recipe on foodnetwork (basic difference being the dip - egg/milk vs buttermilk) and we preferred this just a tad more. I used panko bread crumbs with  italian salad seasoning spice mix I had made (1 c bread crumbs to 1 Tbs spice). Also dipped and let the liquid drip off over a cooling rack before breading. Fried in an electric fryer around 330' for ~3 minutes, turning if it seemed to need it. I did the breading prep about 2 hours before I needed to fry them and they came out fine. I'd emphasize getting high quality ravioli for the best result!

These were really good. Everyone loved them. I didn't have italian breadcrumbs like I thought so I had use plain and I just threw in a bunchof different spices. I cooked the whole bag of raviolis I had and had to make them stop eating them so I would have some to bring to lunch today.

These are wonderful...I also added one more egg to the wash and fried them. I plan to bake them to see how well they turn out but the whole family loved them and has already requested me to make again. Thank you!

My family thought these were just okay, nothing special. They kind of reminded me of mozzarella sticks. My mom suggested using beef ravioli and topping with cheese, we might try that next time.

Wonderful!!! This recipe was excellent and SOOO easy.  They turned out perfect and just like the real thing.  If you get your oil hot enough, you should have no problem with them being at all greasy. Ours might as well have been baked!  They were delicious.

This was wonderful.  My husband loved it, it reminded him of eating it at a restaurant.  The only change I did was use Panko bread crumbs instead of Italian.  There is so much junk in Italian bread crumbs.  Just look at the ingredients list and see for yourself.  I added Italian seasoning and garlic salt to the break crumbs to give it flavor.  Loved it and will definitely make again.

I was so excited to find this recipe!  A now defunct local restaurant used to serve a similar item, and my husband loved it.  Now we can have them whenever we want!  Great with the alfredo sauce recipe by alfanno2 from this site, or your marinara sauce of choice.

These were awesome! I am from St Louis but now live on the west coast and unable to find toasted ravioli. I did use beef ravioli since that is how they are served in St Louis and double breaded them per other reviews. I will definately be making again and again. Thanks!

i miss this from st. louis, i was so thrilled to stumble across this recipe! to be authentic it really should be beef ravioli (with all the marinara and parm. cheese you can fit on it), and next time i'll probably try double-breading them and baking instead of frying. thanks!

Mmm mmm mmm! Instead of using whole milk and egg for the wash, I used buttermilk. I found some really delicious artichoke and cheese raviolis in the fresh pasta section at Trader Joe's to use. They had a hint of lemon zest in the filling which I think added a freshness that fried dishes don't always have. I would definitely make these again.

I would've given this a 3, seeing as I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I'm giving it a 4.  I baked it instead of frying just to keep it a little healthier.  I'm sure frying it would make it so much better.

Excellent recipe! A favorite in our family.  But, I think it should be noted that in St. Louis every restaurant I've eaten toasted ravioli in (many) they've always been meat ravioli, not cheese.  That includes the original Charlie Gitto's version.  With that adjustment, this is the best representation of this St. Louis classic I've come across.

THANK YOU! I lived in St.Louis for awhile and I always got the Toasted Ravioli when we went out, and these are fabulous. Only difference is I use the meat filled ravioli.

I made these in hope they would be just as good as the raviolis at Olive Garden, they weren't the same but they were still good.  I followed the directions except I used meat filled instead of cheese.  My husband to my surprise was the first to speak out and say he really liked them.  After a couple I too really liked them and found them filling along with some pasta for dinner is a nice change.

My husband and I ate at the restaurant in St. Louis 10 years ago shortly after we married.  This recipe takes us back to that night.  It is very similar, the only component lacking is the quaint Itailian environment.  We loved it.

Definitely the best way we have had ravioli. Before this recipe we had never even heard of toasted ravioli. I let the ravioli thaw a little just so it wasn't too frozen, then breaded it and put it on a tray in the freezer for about 10.

I'm only rating the process.  I wanted to duplicate the fried ravioli appetizer I had at a local restaurant.  This recipe showed me how.  I bought refrigerated Italian sausage ravioli from a large wholesale store and a jar of basil spaghetti sauce.  Forgot the egg, but turned out great fried in just enough oil to almost cover.  Thanks for posting which gave me the confidence to try fried ravioli!!

A little messy to make, but these turned out perfectly and pleased my husband who grew up in St. Louis. I used a deep fat fryer instead of the skillet, just because that is my preferred way to fry such things, but otherwise I followed the recipe and they turned out great! Remember to serve them as soon as possible because they don’t reheat terribly well.

This is great with cheese ravioli only, dont try the meat. I added the parmesan cheese to the bread crumb mix and doubled the amount made so I could really bread them heavy. It was great! Dont get your oil too hot or they wont get done in the middle by the time they are brown.

These were pretty good. I took some other people's suggestions and doubled coated them with them breadcrumbs, which I think definitely made them better. Maybe my oil was too hot, or I did something wrong, but I think they would be better if the cheese would have been more gooey. Could have been the brand of raviolis as well I suppose...

Excellent!  We had a girls night over at the house and wanted nibble food.  These were a whole meal and expand big time!  I doubled the recipe and ended up freezing a lot of them to fry at a later date.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were awesome and fun to make.  This was my first time frying like this, and it worked beautifully.  My boyfriend and I only had little round raviolis, but we had an assembly line system and made a big plate of them.  Yummy!

I've been dying to try this for a long time.  I finally made them last night and they were pretty good.  I think my oil may have been too hot, they cooked up really quick but they just tasted a little bit undercooked.  I may try double dipping them next time for an extra coating.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used fresh 3 cheese ravioli and it worked great although the cooking time is really just in, over and out with the fresh ones.  I don't think I'd make this with anything less then really good ravioli.  Will serve again!

Be sure that the ravioli is good and frozen when making this dish.  I did as another reviewer did and added ground garlic and a bit of creole seasoning.  Also, better the quality the ravioli is the better these come out.

This was really good. I never tried fried ravioli before. I am happy I found this recipie. I didn't care for the sauce. I ate them plain with parm cheese sprinkled on top. I will try these again with a different type of filling maybe the meat ravioli.

Delicious! I loved this recipe. I made it with meat and cheese filled raviolis. Recently relocated from stl and wanting to go back. I now have a stl memory that I can take with me anywhere. I must admit that they do cool quickly if you defrost them first but very easy recipe. Even my picky boyfriend likes them.

Excellent!  This appetizer has been a huge hit w/ friends & family!  Easy enough to make, with no major changes.  I do pour the bread crumbs in bowl in shifts so they don't clump up by the end of the batch.  We also use the very best marinara sauce recipe...together this is unbeatable!  Just delicious!

Used a cheese/spinach ravioli. Breaded while frozen and then returned to freezer for about 30 minutes and then straight into hot oil 5-6 at a time and placed on rack.  Good idea to test heat of oil by frying just one.  Much better if served hot/within 15 minutes or so of cooking as they tend to get hard after  sitting - so these wouldn’t be optimal for a make & take hors d'oeuvre.

I wanted to bring t-ravs to a party and this was the perfect recipe to get me started!  I'm originally from St. Louis, so I had to use meat ravioli instead, and I also added a bit of oregano, basil, and garlic salt to the breading mixture.  I coated and fried them while they were still frozen and they turned out perfectly.  They reminded me of what I am missing from home!!  Great recipe!!

I made this twice recently, the first time frying and the second time baking. I much prefer the ravioli baked as it is way less “heavy”.

It was a tasty, but fattening, twist on ravioli. I used a mushroom stuffed ravioli.

These turned out beautifully.  I added a little bit of parmesan to the bread crumbs and pinch of pepper.  I experimented with about 15 raviolis when I started and will recommend, as other reviewers have done, that you freeze them before you fry.  I did not have to use as much olive oil as I originally thought, which is a huge plus!  These will be out foe appetizers at my next event.  Thank you!

I mixed 10 crushed Ritz crackers to the bread crumbs and a tsp parm cheese. Breaded in the morning and put in the freezer for 4 hours. Deep fried for 1 minute. They were awesome! I would make this again and again!

Ravioli texture was heavier than usual, requiring a bit of chewiness. Overall, it was an easy recipe.

Delicious ! I used a Spinach and Mozzarella stuffed ravioli. I did bread mine and let them sit in refrigerator for 10 or so minutes to allow the coating to set a bit better .

A nice appetizer!  I also made it from frozen meat ravioli and used store bought marinara, of which I added additional Italian spices to enhance the flavors.  My husband liked it and so did I.

Baked at 350 for 30 minutes. Probably a bit on the long side as kids had a tough time chewing. Pretty, though, and easy.

I doubled the recipe and added some more garlic and Italian seasoning to my breadcrumbs simply because they were bland. I had two very very picky 10 year old boys gobble these things up. We served them with homemade ranch and homemade pizza sauce. Frying takes some time but its worth it since the prep is really little to nothing.

Tried this mainly as written: just adding a substanticl amount more flavorings such as cheese, Adobo seasoning and additional garlic powder to kick up the flavor.  The second half I added chopped dried hot peppers- I served them as a large pile of appetizers with several bowls of differing sauces from anchovie to salsa for dipping.  It was quite a hit and I was happy to tell those that requested the recipe to get it at Recipes.com

We were so happy with this snack for game day!  I used cheese and meat raviolis, and both worked great.  Served with an onion and garlic spaghetti sauce.  Can't wait to make again!

Pretty Good! It reminds me of the toasted raviolis at Olive Garden. They were a little bland so I added some more spices. I used meat ravioli, next time I will try cheese ravioli.

These have the flavor of "boxed" a little.  And they were a little greasy.  But they went quickly at the party I took them to!

Wow! Just like we remember. I did nuke my ravs just a tiny bit because I didn't have time to thaw & they were stuck together. Used Garlic & Herb bread crumbs & Paul Newmans Organic Marinara. So delish, thanks!

I added some Italian seasonings to Panko breadcrumbs, and taking the advice of others, stuck them in the freezer for a while after breading. This worked out great. These were easy and fun to make, and although I didn't find them outstanding, they were as good as expected and something I will be making again as an appetizer at my next party. Thanks for the recipe!

We love these at one of the local restaurants ans this recipe is pretty close.  We made them in our deep fryer.  The only problem was the coating sometimes came off in chunks.  Will try again.

I was so happy to come across this recipe. We are from St. Louis and recently moved to Birmingham and this item has become one of the biggest hits at tailgate parties. We miss toasted ravioli, Imo's Pizza, and Ted Drewes (too bad no one has their custard recipe!)

These were really good.  I made this with the beef kind of ravioli.  My husband also loved them.  It was a little time-consuming but well worth it.  I will be making these again.

It's not horrible, nor is it sensational. One of those things you'd eat just 'cause you took the time to cook it. I'll try again, but this time I won't thaw the ravioli. But then again, maybe it was just the kind of pasta I used. As is though, I wouldn't recommend.

Oh my gosh, this was awesome!  It was fun to make and fun to eat.  Good thing I had an extra bag of ravioli as I had made enough to serve 6 and ended making enough for 12 (I was only cooking for 3!!) with only a handful left over.  The 17 yr old son in the house promptly devoured those when he got up this morning. The 15 yr old son who missed dinner as he was at a friend's was SO mad.  LOL!  I will be making this for dinner again soon and know it would be great for tailgate and other parties.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Five stars for simplicity!  We really enjoyed the different taste and served these up as appetizers, which were quickly snapped up.  I double breaded half the raviolis and both single and double breaded were a hit.  I used my favourite marinara sauce for dipping.  I did add a little personal seasoning to the breading mixture beacuse thats just how we like it.  Next time I would like to try the spinach and cheese raviolis - my one and five year old gobbled these up too so I cold sneak in some spinach that way!  Thanks for sharing.

Loved it--and we were surprised!  We had this as an appitzer for my dad's birthday and everyone was raving about it.  This dish could easily be used for dinner with a side salad or for a Superbowl party.  Fun alternative to boiled pasta.  Also--we used our new deep fryer and put the thawed cheese ravioli in for about 5 minutes and they came out perfect.

Should have read the reviews before starting this.....First, my oil was too hot. Second, I should have double breaded. I loved the idea of this recipe but I didn't get enough breading and these turned out more like crispy wontons. I am going to try again and look at using some spinach ravioli. I bet that would be great. Otherwise, it was simple to prepare, that's why a 4.

This was good.  I really had high expectations, sounded so perfect, but my hubby and his friend, ate all of it, but said it was "good".  I did follow the recipe exactly, maybe with some minor tweaking it can be "great".

I am so surprised by all the great reviews. I did not like these at all. Maybe I did something wrong? My boyfriend thought they were okay, but didn't go back for seconds. I agree with one reviewer who said she thought the cheese would be more gooey. I thought so too. Instead it was like eating a chunk of bread and the cheese had the texture of potatoes. Very strange. Thanks for the recipe though.

These are really tasty although I think you need a lot more parmesan. I used marinara for the dipping sauce & thought it was a good choice. Will have again.

I don't know why, but every time I make this the ravioli does not cook through. It's still good and a nice change of pace from saucy pastas.

First time making toasted ravioli.. very easy and tasty.  Will try another reviews advice and try with meat ravioli. Also, will add some garlic maybe parsley to breadcrumbs for a little extra zing.

Made these for a party I was hosting last night and they were not a hit.  They looked great and tasted ok, but no one ate more than one and I had a whole plate full of left overs.  I will not make these again.

Very good!  I wish I could find some frozen ravioli with a really spicy meat filling, like what they have at the Olive Garden.  But you could really use any kind of ravioli in this recipe and it'd turn out great.  Thanks!

Made these for my wife's "Bunco" friends and they loved them. I used our backyard deep fryer and was able to do a big batch in no time!

Good. Not as good as Olive Garden but that might have been the brand I bought. I used fresh meat filled ravioli. Very easy to do, just messy.

I used light cream instead of milk and also had to fry much longer than recommended.  This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I will make this one over and over!

These were so easy to make. I only had plain bread crumbs so I seasoned them myself. My kids loved them and they can be picky eaters. I will have to make these next time I have company. Thanx Barb!

I never heard of fried ravioli until I read a review of these.  I thought they were a nice change from traditional ravioli with spaghetti sauce.  I enjoyed the crisp texture.  I mistakenly bought meat ravioli and would like to try cheese.  They do take some time to prepare, so I probably would not make them very often.

Good, but they weren't as crisp as some I've had in restaurants.  Not sure if there is something I should be doing differently, or if that's how they were supposed to be.

Very close to what you find in restaraunts. My grocery didnt carry frozen ravioli - so I bought the fresh/packaged kind.  Still worked well & recv'd many compliments.  Thanks.

I had toasted ravioli in St Louis last week, and they were absolutely delicious! Mine were not as good - a little too chewy (perhaps because I fried them ahead of time, and then heated them up in the oven?), and not as cheesy as those at the restaurant. I think it's time to bite the bullet, and make ravioli myself (eek!)

Just alright.  Very simple to make, possibility for an appetizer someday, but not outstanding.

This was very good; a nice change for an appetizer.  I may need to fry longer or hotter next time; they cooled quickly and when cool are al little soggy.  But right out of the pan, they're hot and delicious!

This recipe was a big hit.  Easy to make, a little time consuming with the breadig process but worth the time.  Yummy
