Easy to make!  These have more of the horseradish taste when cold than when hot!  I used whole wheat flour, next time I think these will be better looking if I use white whole wheat flour!

Blend the peas separately to avoid overworking the mix.  These floated faster than my normal gnocchis and some were undercooked in the middle.  If I made it again I'd at least double the spices but I'll be sticking with my classic gnocchi recipe for now.

I liked this idea but found that the flavors were very mild; needed more wasabi for my taste. Again loved the idea and may retry this recipe again.

So Good!! If you like wasabi you should add a lot more than what is suggested though. I did and it tasted great!

This was really good but I would increase the amount of wasabi. I had to keep adding in flour while forming the gnocchi to make it less sticky, so the flavor got diluted. It was very time consuming! I served it over mixed asian vegetables and topped it with an asian vinaigrette (found the recipe on this sight) and sesame seeds.
