I used this recipe last year...people couldn't get enough of it!  It received raves from all who tried it.  Thank you, Margaret!

This is as close to authentic Scotch Shortbread I have found in a long time. Yummy, yummy, yummy!

I went into this hoping to adopt it as our Fraser shortbread recipe but it wasn't quite what we expected. It was very hard and tasteless. Disappointing.
