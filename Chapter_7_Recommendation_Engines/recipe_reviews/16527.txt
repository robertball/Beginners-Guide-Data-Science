Don't skip th eseason salt. It's the beef that's adding too much salt. If you rinse each piece of dried beef before you chop it up and then pat dry with a paper towel the saltiness is alleviated and this appetizer is a big hit. Takes a little more time but it is worth it.

Very good!  I used Buddig corned beef, about a package and a half and instead of making it into a ball, I just put it in a bowl as a spread.  Also added a little garlic powder.  Served it with Ritz and Triscuits and everybody loved it, even my brother who says he never likes "stuff like that".

like other reviewers, i chose the carl buddig packaged beef over dried beef, although next time may try it with corned beef like r.t. did! also, i didn't have green onions so i added about a rounded tablespoon of finely minced onion instead. the worchestershire sauce & seasoned salt really give this recipe a nice flavor.  great with triscuits. thanks joan!

I love this stuff, but to me, the Worchestershire and seasoned salt ruin this classic recipe, so as a personal preference, I've always made this with just cream cheese, green onions, and dried beef (in a jar...don't remember the brand name).  I don't rinse the beef, just mince it.  In this case, I love the saltiness of the beef with the creaminess of the cream cheese...accented by the green onions. Without the additional salt, it's not too salty. I am puzzled by rinsing salt off...then adding salt = ) ...

I also tried using Carl Buddig sliced Beef  instead of the dried beef and that tamed down the saltiness.  And some chopped pistaschios instead of walnuts. I like both versions very much. :-)

I added some shredded Sharp Cheddar cheese to this.  I made it for a party in November and have been asked to bring it for New Years, so I think it was a hit!

This was good but it was a little too salty.  Next time I am going to skip the season salt.

Really works better with shredded cheddar cheese and cream cheese (I do 8 oz of each). I was out of green onions and used dried chopped chives instead. I ran out of Worchestershire sauce and used Country Bob's instead (made it sweeter). Be sure and rinse the dried beef well to remove the extra salt.  I used onion powder and garlic salt instead of seasoned salt. I put all the beef into the cheese ball and then roll it in crushed pretzels.

good stuff.  Very salty, so don't forget to rinse the beef as I did!  I added a handful of sharp cheddar cheese as well.  Will definitely make again with rinsed beef!

I liked this alot, so did the gals I made it for. The dired beef was a pain. I rinsed it twice to be sure it was not salty. I used all the beef in the "ball" and used shredded cheese to cover it.

This is very close to the recipe I use.  I don't use Worcestershire sauce or seasoned salt but I do use MSG.  Sometimes I add a splash of Worcestershire sauce but I really can't tell the difference one way or another.  This is my 14 year old sons fav!!!  He can sit and eat the whole thing by himself!

I have made this several times.  I am sure this is terrible for you, but sooo good.  I usually use 4 oz of beef, b/c that is = to 2 packages of the Buddig Beef.  I usually just chop all the beef and mix it in and then just serve the mixture in a bowl instead of rolling into a ball. . .  Unless I am trying to be fancy. :)  I always try to make ahead, b/c it is much better when the flavors have time to meld.  We love it w/ Triscuits and Ritz.  Thanks for a great recipe!

YUMMY! I made this years ago and was so happy to find the recipe again...so easy to make yet so tasty. I added chopped nuts, and because I am a bit of a germaphobe, I didn't use my bare hands to make the ball - I rolled it around in a piece of plastic wrap and felt better about that.  I took it to a get together with girl friends, and they all said it was addictive!

Delicious and perfect for outdoor events because of the consistency of the cheese. Instead of wrapping it into a ball, I spread it out like a dip. The recipe is good, but a little bland, so I added several cups of fresh bacon bits and a little cayenne pepper to give it some zing.... that did the trick and everyone loved it! I'll use this recipe again.

I've made this for years, but instead of the Worcestershire sauce and seasoned salt, I use the some of the powdered flavoring from the Mrs. Grass Chicken soup mix that comes in the box. Yum!

I couldn't find dried beef at the store by my house so I used 2 packages of buddig corned beef and added 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder (POWDER not salt!) and it was really tasty. Make sure you leave the cream cheese out for a few hours and its really easy to mix. I'd recommend.

I have used this recipe for years but instead of seasoning salt I use Accent and let it set for a couple of hours before serving.  It's always a huge hit.

I made this for my son's first birthday party and served with sliced cheese and whole wheat crackers.  I should have made more because it was gone before the party was even halfway over!  This is a wonderful recipe and I'm actually going to make it again just to have in the house for a snack.

I got this recipe a couple of years ago from a friend, it is very good.  I do not use as a cheese ball, I blend everything in the food processor except the green onion (I mix that in by hand) and put in a bowl as a dip, everyone always loves it.

Love this stuff. I lost my recipe and am so happy to see it again. As a side note, Lyby basically changed the recipe then rated it. I don’t mind someone making a recipe their own but don’t rate a recipe and then change all of it.

I don't use seasoned salt. I use the recipe as is but add garlic powder and onion powder and don't rinse the beef. Perfect every time!! I have made this multiple times and it is always gobbled up!!!

I make this recipe again and again every holiday season!  The only change I have made is that I mix in all the dried beef with the other ingredients.  I cover the cheese ball with finely chopped pecans. Always a hit with family and friends.

I made mine and left out season salt and added just a little sprinkle of garlic salt and added 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese and served it with black bean tortilla chips and it was an absolute hit at work.  So delicious!!!

First, I chopped up the beef  in the food processor, then rinsed and strained it and patted dry on a paper towel - MUCH easier than washing each slice.  Onion was chopped nice and fine in the processor, too - I used everything but the last inch of those onions!  Only change I made was adding a jar of "Old English Cheddar spread".  When I first tasted it, i was worried it was way too salty, but I put it in the refrigerator over night.  In the morning, the flavor was VERY good.   Rolled it in chopped pecans and it was one of the first things gone at our snack day in the office.

I too used Carl Buddig.  My dad has made these for years as popems.  You roll the mixture into walnut size balls, roll them into chopped beef and you pop em into your mouth - no crackers required.  Thanks for sharing

I knocked off a star for this reason: 1 TBLS. is too much Worchestershire.  A teaspoon is plenty.  Jarred chipped beef is too salty.  Use Carl Buddig smoked beef in the bags.  I use 2 or 3 - 2oz. bags, it's fine and better priced.  I also only used 4 stalks green onion.  The idea is to have the ingredients marry each other, not overwhelm.  This is a great as a spread, too. You don't have to bother covering it with beef.  Best when it sits over night.

This was a tasty recipe variation of how I've always made it and others I know have made this. Instead of dried beef, I use the Budding beef packs. It reduces the saltiness greatly. I also add minced dried onions instead of green onions to give it more of a pop. I don't use seasoned salt either because the Worcestershire sauce and minced onions give it enough "pizzazz" to not need additional salt. All in all, I gave this 4 stars simply because the saltiness was through the roof for me and most of family.  Other than that it was pretty good

Good. I added 4 oz of sour cream and finely diced green, red, orange  peppers and garlic salt. The sour cream was added to help stretch the amount of end product.  Had unexpected guests.  Everyone loved.

Since the first time we made it (my husband and I like to cook together), it's been a "command performance" at family events.  We typically add a little garlic powder.  Great recipe.

Very good, rolled mine in parsley from my garden.  For the salt issue (I do like the regular dried beef) I used my kitchen scissors to cut it up into a strainer, then ran it under warm water.  Squeeze out the water, and that took care of the saltiness issue and my beef was ready to drop into the cream cheese.

Very good! I made this yesterday for a small Christmas gaqthering.  Everyone loved it.  I used 2 (2oz) packs of shaved beef inside the ball because I could not find dried beef; then I used 1 (2oz) pack of shaved beef on the outside.  I doubled the Worchestershire Sauce. It makes a large ball (about 5-6 inches in diameter). For a small gathering of 5-6 people, you could half the recipe.  We had about 1/2 of the ball left over with 5 people enjoying it; eveyone was trying to prevent getting full on this because we were following it with a large meal. I will try rolling in crushed pecan bits the next time.

This is my go to cheese ball recipe!  Very good.  A couple of important tips though.  #1.  The longer it sits, the more the flavors blend.  So I would at least make this the day before you want to serve it.  #2.  You MUST rinse the dried beef under some running water really well to remove the salt or else the cheese ball will be way too salty!  Just rinse the beef slices, then pat dry with paper towels.  Enjoy!
