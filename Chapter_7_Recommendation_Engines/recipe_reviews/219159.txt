This is an excellent recipe.  The onions that were in the bottom of the pan were brown and savory, the ones that cooked on top of the meat not as much--so next time I'll put them all in the bottom of the pan.  Other than that, no changes...and that's saying something because I almost ALWAYS change something.

This is an excellent pot roast ( and I thought mine was the best) I do NOT get the reference to a sweet not savory roast by another reviewer, because this was a tasty & tender AND NOT SWEET roast.  I also do not recommend that anyone eat pot roast rare as suggested by a reviewer. Pot roast is a very tough cut and the long braising and fall apart result is what a pot roast is all about. I would recommend that you salt and pepper the roast before browning because I thought it needed a bit more salt. I would also suggest that you use a grainy or country dijon and NOT a sweetened dijon mustard. The only changes that I made was that I used dark brown sugar because that is all I had. I cooked it covered tightly in a 275 degree oven for 4 hours and it  turned out perfect. I did have to add more slurry to thicken the gravy because of all the juices that I had left. Next time I might stir a few crumbled ginger snaps into the gravy to give it an even more pronounced german flavor.  This is a winner and I will make this again and again. Thanks so much for sharing.

I was very disappointed with this, in terms of flavor.  I made this with Sam Adams Oktoberfest, one of my favorite beers but I gave 3 stars allowing for different beers giving different flavors.  Mostly I think I didnt like the brown sugar which gives it a sweetened taste whereas I was looking for something more savory.  I cooked the roast in my slow cooker high for 3 hours cooks it perfectly.  remember it keeps cooking after you take it out so maybe take it out a bit sooner if you light it on the rare side.  Meat was tender, I just didnt like the lightly sweet flavor

I used a 2 lb bottom round roast, but kept all other ingredients & cooking time the same. Except for some extra beef broth I added about 3 hours in.  At that time I also stirred the onions into the gravy, turned the roast over and basted it with the gravy. Since the roast was so lean it definately needed the gravy.  The gravy is a real flavorful german style gravy.  Will definitely be saving this in my recipe box.

My Sweetie-Pi was all aglow with this, saying over and over again that it was a keeper, as he served himself multiple helpings.  I cooked this in the slow cooker for about 3.5 hrs, and the roast was fork tender.  Served with mashed potatoes and honey glazed carrots.  Made a beautiful presentation.  Personally, I thought the gravy lacked flavor except for the sharp flavor of the ale I used (and as someone else pointed out, each beer adds its own unique flavor), as well as the strong mustard flavor. I felt it needed another spice or herb to balance out the flavors, perhaps rosemary or ginger?  I wish I were better with herbs and how to combine them.  Anyway, I used my old standby, Gravy Master, to deep the color and flavor, and it helped considerably. Perhaps some Better Than Boullion would have been a good addition.  As another reviewer mentioned, the onions layered on top of the roast did little for them.  Those that cooked in the broth flavored the gravy and gave the onions an appealing, appetizing color.  Also, 1 tablespoon cornstarch and water was not enough to thicken the gravy to my taste, so I added more.  To me, this recipe is a 3, my Sweetie-Pi thinks it's a 5, hence the 4 star rating.

So delicious! I made this in a slow cooker, on low for 7-8 hours. I followed the ingredients exactly, except I used 2 cups of beer (a porter) and left out the beef stock.  I added some baby carrots the last 2 hours of cook time so they didn't get too mushy.  Served with some mashed potatoes and gravy made from the beef juices.  The family really liked this one!  Will definitely make again!!

This was terrific ! The only thing I did differently was put a mixture of onion wedges, carrots and celery on the bottom of the pot, then laid the seared roast on top of the mixture.

This is fantastic!  I made this almost exactly as written - just added a little more mustard to avoid too much sweetness, and left out the beef stock (put in more beer for more liquid).  With a dark ale this tastes rich & hearty, with the mustard really lifting the flavour... And the gravy!  Pshew!  Yum.

Very good, but I will go back to my favorite recipe for roast. This recipe needed herbs of some kind for flavor. It was just not my best pot roast!

What a FANTASTIC option to take as opposed to the usual pot roast with potatoes, carrots, onions and celery.  This is at the TOP of my recipe go-to list now!

Tasty.  Regarding the gravy--Like several other reviewers, my husband's 1st comment was..that is sweet. To assist with the lessening the "sweet" I served with regular beef gravy and blended both over meat.

This roast is absolutely delicious! I’ve made this roast a bunch of times. It’s our families favorite. I double the liquid and mustard seasoning ingredients so that we have extra for a gravy for the roast and mashed potatoes. I haven’t ever added the nutmeg that’s in the ingredients list because I dont have it in my spice cabinet. Still is delish without it!

I made this in my slow cooker on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  The luscious smell just about had me drooling!  I used a dark beer and added carrots  to the veggies.  The rub adds a very German touch to the roast.  May add some caraway seed next time!  It makes a ton of gravy!  I served it with mashed potatoes , but egg noodles or rice would work well too.  The leftovers were great too!

This was an easy and and a nice change from my usual roast recipe. I used Guiness for my beer and put it in a slow cooker. I could really taste the beer and brown sugar. A sweet sauce but not overly sweet. Definitely did not make a gravey.

Wow this is so good.  I love the flavors of the roast.  I put onions on the top and bottom.  It came out excellent.

Made this for the first time tonight.  It was awesome!!! We cooked it in an oven bag and the roast was moist and delicious.  Left out the nutmeg because wasn't sure about that.  My husband was like "why are you looking up a recipe, just make regular roast"!  He couldn't get enough of it.

My family loved it, I doubled it since I am feeding a crowd. I used Guinness and it made a wonderful gravy. I didn't get that it was too sweet like others. The only thing I would change would be to make a little more of the dijon mustard mix. I served mine with mashed potatoes and butternut squash. My husband had three platefuls, lol!!
Thanks for an awesome way to make a roast beef.

Good, not amazing. Followed recipe except used crock pot to cook and used double broth in substitution for beer. Broth did not thicken enough to be "gravy" with amount of corn starch added. But was still good.

The meat was tender enough, just not very much flavor. It might have been the cut of meat I had on hand, a rump roast.

Per some of the other comments, made this with a full bottle of dark beer and correspondingly less broth.  I used chicken broth since that's what I had on hand.  Based on what others have said about the onions, I chose to dice the onions and put them on the bottom of the pot with some finely diced carrots and celery.  As the roast cooked, the veggies turned into a terrific gravy with just a hint of sweetness from the onions and the brown sugar.

When I make this again, I'll probably be more generous with the mustard glaze - the bite of the mustard makes a nice counterpoint to the slightly sweet gravy.  I think I'll also brush on additional glaze periodically as the roast cooks.  The nutmeg in the glaze is a nice, subtle touch that makes this roast especially good.

Wife loved it - said it reminded her of the way her grandma cooked, which is high praise!
