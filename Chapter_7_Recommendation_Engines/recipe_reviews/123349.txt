I've been using this recipe (with a slight variation) for many years.  Instead of frying, I bake it in the oven.  Melting the butter and adding it to the breadcrumbs BEFORE you bread the chicken helps make the coating crispy in the oven.  I also vary the spices depending on what I'm serving...sometimes more thyme, basil, oregano, garlic.  Bake for 30 minutes or so, at 375.  Always very good, tender, and juicy.  Also makes good chicken strips and nuggets.

Simple and tasty!  Instead of putting it on the stove,however, I skipped the butter/oil step and baked the chicken at 425 for 35-40 minutes...was a big hit with the husband and I had the ingredients in the house already!  What more could you ask for?

Man! That was easy and TASTY!
I used olive oil to make it a little healthier.

Word to the wise: Be certain to heed the requirement on the thickness of the chicken. If it is too thick the crust will burn before the inner chicken is cooked.

I mixed oregano, parsley, and basil in the breadcrumb\cheese mixture.  I took suggestions from others and placed some spaghetti sauce in the bottom of a casserole dish and baked covered with cheese.  I served with spaghetti and French bread.  It was delicious. Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe! I used olive oil and garlic instead of egg on the chicken and baked it in the oven for 30 min at 350. PERFECT! Served it with Angel hair and marinara. Thanks!

This recipe is my favorite so far.  My husband hates chicken and is the most picky eater, but he actually loved this!!  I took the advice of another and added butter to the bread crumb mixture as well as adding a bit more basil, thyme and garlic salt.  I cooked for exactly 35 minutes at 375 degrees and it came out perfect and moist.  This recipe is a must to add at home, the kids loved it as well!

This is pretty good, however, the chicken is sort of bland.  Needs some dressing up with seasoning.  I pan fried about 2 pieces of chicken first and tasted them.  My daughter and I agreed that it was indeed lacking something.  So on the next few pieces, I seasoned the chicken with some lemon pepper and extra basil, then added some garlic powder.  I should have added garlic salt, but didn't have any.  It still needed something. The crust is very good and crispy.  I like the recipe and will use it again, but I need to find a seasoning combination that will enhance the flavor of the chicken.  Maybe I will omit the butter and use extra virgin olive oil and add some garlic to it.  Thanks, though.

Very good and very simple recipe.  The only thing I did different was that I added 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic to the egg mixture and I dipped the chicken in the egg mix then the bread crumbs, then dipped the same piece of chicken into the egg mix again and then the breadcrumbs again so it gave it a thicker crust.  Great recipe!!!

My mother made this for us when I was little.  It was one of the only thing all of us (there are five) would eat.  You can do just about anything with it.  Definately use italian bread crumbs.  Sometimes we would make sandwiches and top with mayo, lettuce and tomato.  I have also cut the chicken into strips and made "chicken fingers".  My favorite though is to add marinara sauce to the pan (drain any excess oil) and top with mozzarella and parmasean.

Besides adding a little garlic salt and white pepper, I did everything else just as the recipe called for.  Very simple and great tasting. My husband and son loved it.  Will keep in recipe box.

Very nice flavor!  To the bread crumb mixture I added  1/2 tsp. of oregano, 1/2 tsp. of minced garlic, and 1 Tbsp. of dried Parsley.  I used two eggs and dipped the chicken in the eggs and bread crumbs twice.  To cut down on the fat I sprayed a baking dish with Pam and baked these in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes turned them sprayed them with a little more Pam and baked for 15 more minutes.

This chicken was very good. I was out of bread crumbs, so I used crushed herb seasoned stuffing.  Turned out very crunchy. Served with spaghetti and a salad. Will make again.

This recipe is superb and really easy. I took the advice from BUZZYSMOM and added butter to the bread crumb mix and I also added a bit of olive oil and garlic powder and I used a wisk ( I would recommend a wisk and not a fork- the wisk worked better) to mix everything up.  I poured a minimal layer of Prego Spaghetti sauce (meat flavored because it's all I had) on the bottom of the glass baking dish and then placed the battered chicken on top of the sauce. I baked the chicken in the oven for 35 minutes at 375 and then pulled out the dish...sprinkled shredded parmesan cheese and shredded cheddar cheese on the top of the chicken and then put it back in the oven for 3 minutes to melt the cheese a bit. EVERYONE in my family (including my culinary grad Sister and picky 82 year old Grandmother!) LOVED IT! I served this chicken parmesan with spaghetti and french bread- THANKS for this recipe and the helpful reviews and alterations everyone made to it!

I really liked this recipe, except I made a few change to suit my liking.. First of all I should mentioned that I baked my chicken at 375 for 30 minutes and I also did pound my chicken.. As for the spices, I put 1 tbsp melted butter in with the plain bread crumbs and mixed it then I added parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, garlic powder, sesame seeds, and red pepper flakes for a kick *Although my boyfriend says I didn't put enough for a kick haha* .. this combination of spices and such was awesome!!

I've made other parmesan chicken recipes in the past and this was the best AND the easiest! Although I changed the recipe a little bit... I baked the chicken at 375 and poured melted butter on the breading to brown it. Turned out great!

A quick and easy chicken dish.  I make this often because I usuallly don't have a lot of time to cook.  I also do as others have stated and add a little spaghetti sauce to the bottom of an oven-proof dish and place the cooked chicken on top of the sauce, and add some mozzarella cheese to melt on top in the oven--delicious!

I made this version of Chicken Parmesan for clients tonight who are super picky.  They loved it.  Best thing is it doesn't actually use a lot of chicken to produce what looks like huge portions.  I dipped the pounded chicken in seasoned flour, egg and then crumbs.  Fried in a big pan.  They were thin so cooked quickly.  Served over a bed of pasta with home made marinara.  Topped with mozzarella...popped in a 400 degree oven for 10 minutes.    Great recipe.  Thank you!

This is the exact recipe I've used for over 20 years--since my kids were little and I wouldn't buy the mystery meat chicken nuggets at the grocery store. Instead of frying, I have always baked them. They've always been a family favorite!

Instead of dipping the chicken in egg, I marinade the chicken in ranch dressing for a few hours & then bread the chicken with Italian bread crumbs.  Bake in the oven..

I baked this in the oven for 30 min @375 per another user. This was perfection. Light, flavorful, moist and delicious.
I always bake meat dishes with a small amount of water in a separate dish directly under meat. It helps keep moisture so you can cut it with a fork.

Used Italian bread crumbs and cooked mine for a bit longer in a mixture of olive oil and butter. Served atop spaghetti marinara. Topped with mozzarella cheese and put under the broiler. Great meal.

I made this the first according to the recipe and everyone thought it was too bland.  The next time I made it I added 1/2 teaspooon sage, 1/2 teaspoon italian seasoning, and 1/2 teaspoon paprika.  I also melted the butter and added it to the bread crumb mixture and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese instead of the 1/4 cup.  I baked it in the oven for about 30 minutes in a 350 degrees oven.  When there was 5 minutes left on the timer I took them out and flipped them.  My family liked this way so much better we are having it again tonight for dinner.

The other suggestions were great.  I added fresh garlic to the egg mix.  Extra herbs to the Italian bread crumbs, montreal steak seasoning, Cayenne pepper for spice, and Parmesan cheese.  Next time I will tone it down since I could not taste the cheese.  I baked it but was not getting as brown as I like so I topped off under the broiler.  I paired it with pasta shells and alfredo and added parmesan and blue cheese to the pasta.  Wow...fabulous combo between the chicken and pasta.  Next time I plan on making a blue cheese sauce to drizzel over the chicken and substituting the pasta with a veggie.  Great recipe!

I have been doing this for a couple of years now and it's always a HUGE hit! If you want a really good thick crust just drag it through some flour before you dip it in the egg..also you can experiment..I use Italian seasoned bread crumbs, lots of black pepper and garlic. One time I was out of bread crumbs and crushed up some parmesan croutons for the crust! Yummy!

I'm new at cooking, so this was the first time I have made this dish. This was so quick and easy! Also, my boyfriend raved about it! I will definitely make this again. I didn't use all of the bread crumbs, probably tossing about a 1/3 - 1/4 of it and I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I also used boneless, skinless breast filets so I didn't need to flatten the chicken.

Very GOOD!!!  This was the first time we'd ever tried Parmesan Chicken and it made me wonder why I had never done it before.  I read the other comments so I also melted the butter and mixed it in with the bread crumbs then baked for 30min at 375.  Perfect!

Great tasting and easy!! I put diced garlic and olive oil in my wash bowl instead of egg. I added oregano, thyme, salt, pepper, onion salt and garlic powder to the crumb mixture bowl. Instead of pan frying, I baked at 350 for 45 min. Wonderful result. Served with angel hair pasta and marinara sauce over everything!! Yummy!

I hardly cook. So this recipe was wonderfully simple! Basic ingredients found in your cupboard and so.. easy to make. I seasoned the chicken with a little salt and pepper prior to basking it in breadcrumbs or panko. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. If you use thicker pieces of chicken you can always put it into the oven for some extra baking time to make sure the chicken is fully cooked. All together, simple ingredients but great tasting! :)

This recipe was delicious and very easy to make.  I didn't make it with the breadcrumbs but it was still tasty.  I recommend this recipe for people who don't have time to cook but want delicious meals.

This was a hit at my dad's 50th birthday party!  He loves Chicken Parmesan and wanted me to cook it for him.  This recipe is a keeper!  I also baked my chicken in the oven.  It came out crispy and just perfect.  I added the butter to the breading like someone else suggested to give it a crunchier crust.  I also put fresh garlic slices on top of my chicken to give it a little extra kick.  This is a recipe that can be experimented with.  So good!

This was moist, full of flavor and super easy.  I followed advice and added the melted butter into bread crumbs/parmesan.  I baked in the oven at 350 for 30 mins or so, then put a tablespoon of marinara sauce and some mozzarella on top of each and broiled until cheese melted.  Served with spaghetti and salad and everyone was happy!

Good, with my changes. Heh heh.  :)  I used my own marinara sauce, then put about a cup or so of it in the bottom of a greased baking dish (you could use store-bought marinara).  Then I took another's suggestion and baked them at 375 for about 20-25 min. then I sprinkled with some Mozzarella and baked for another 5 or 10 min.  Served it on top of pasta with the extra marinara.
Yummy!

This was very good and easy to make!  I changed this recipe a bit.  I added Oregano and thyme.  I used previously frozen chicken breasts, and didn't flatten them.  I baked them at 375 degrees for 30 minutes, took them out, put marinara sauce on the bottom of the pan and mozzarella on top of the chicken, and put it back in the oven for five minutes.  I served it over spaghetti and my husband absolutely loved it!  We'll definitely add this one to our list of regular meals.

Like everyone else....I MUST give this a five.  This is based on taste, time and ease.  My only change was using minced garlic and olive oil  in the pan instead of butter or vegetable oil.  It was delicious!

Good basic recipe.  I made these, baked them on a layer of homemade pasta sauce topped with mozzarella (just long enough to melt the mozzarella).  Served with angel hair pasta, a baguette and steamed broccoli.

This was a very simple and easy recipe! I'm a flavor kinda gal so I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic to the egg wash, doubled up on ingredients, so my chicken got 2 coats of the bread crumb and parmesan mixture. Also I made my own bread crumbs so they were seasoned well and I think that was a good idea since I didn't put any seasoning directly on the chicken....great dish!

This is almost a mirror image of my parmesan chicken that I have made for years.  This recipe can be altered so easily that when I make it, I prepare 2 full meals for my family and then freeze leftovers for another night.  I also substitute plain bread crumbs with the seasoned bread crumbs or different spices as needed.  This works well served over pasta with marinara sauce, with BBQ sauce for dipping or even smothered in a buttery lemon sauce.  Very versatile recipe and extremely easy to prepare.

Not caring for fried foods I baked this at 375 for 30 minutes. Didn't change anything else and we really enjoyed it. Will have the other 2 breasts as leftovers tonight. This is so simple and easy and will surely do this again.

Like others said, the flavor was kinda bland.  Added a few more spices and dipped a few pieces in Ranch.  Easy and quick to make.

Wow this was so good! I listed to other reviewers and baked the chicken instead of fried it. I also used crushed ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs b/c that's what I had on hand and I added garlic powder and onion powder to the mix. I also used someone's advice and mixed the melted butter into the crumb mixture to ensure the crispy outside. I baked it on 375 degree's for 30-35 minutes and they were so perfect! Crispy on the outside and juicy and moist on the inside. I served it over speghetti w/ marinara over it all. Very very good and super easy. Will definately be making this often! Thank you!

Love the parmesan chicken! I make this alot now.  I never have parmesan on hand, so I don't use it and I always forget the basil. So, I just use other spices I have on hand and it is super delicious. We serve with Angel hair.

Fabulous!  Super easy, moist chicken with a crispy coating.  The only substitution I made was to add a tad extra olive oil to my skillet.  Will absolutely make again - and again!

Easy and delicious! I did make one change and that is...I didn't fry it!  Instead, I baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes (as per the Shake n Bake box instructions for boneless chicken)...no flattening, no mess, no extra pans, its healthier, less work and best of all, I don't have to worry about the chicken not cooking properly!  Unless it's completely submerged in oil (aka deep frying) I always bake my chicken for safety reasons. Also, the oven will cook your chicken to perfection, so there will be no risk of burning and your chicken will look beautiful everytime! For that golden brown look, drizzle melted spread over the chicken before putting it in the oven. I use Italian bread crumbs and it works perfectly.  This is even more delicious over pasta and topped with melted cheese. Yum!

This is awesome! I found this recipe on family food in a Disney site, and noticed it was on here as well. My husband gobbles this up, always asks for more. I coat my chicken with flour before dipping the egg, that way the coating will never fall off. I will be making this once or twice a month!

This was incredible!! Tasted just like my favorite restaurant in town. I followed the recipe exactly. Heated up Classicos Spicy Tomato & Pesto, putting a couple of tablespoons on top of chicken with slice of mozzarella on top of that. Put under broiler until cheese melted and served with spaghetti and more of the spaghetti sauce. Will definitely make this again!!!!!

this was a great tasting recipe, extremely easy to make! just make sure your chicken is completely thawed or the egg has trouble sticking to it and the outside will come off during frying

Very easy and quick. Great solution to those "what do I do with this chicken breast" nights. A dish everyone can enjoy.

so easy and super super good. Authentic. I added a just a pinch of garlic powder to the dry ingredients and then put s few slices of provolone on top of each piece and threw it in teh oven for 10 minutes. A little left over marinara and it was awesome.

This is really awesome. I made the batter on chicken drumsticks instead of breasts. It went very well with steamed cauliflower as a side dish.

I have made this recipe in the oven and on the stove. I like it better cooked on the stove and so does my husband (who is very picky). I have taken advice of others and I add 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, thyme and oregano, 1 tsp basil and 1/4 tsp salt to the Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I brown the chicken as stated on the recipe in butter and olive oil. It comes out very moist inside and crunchy on the outside. This is now one of our favorite dinners.

I love this recipe, so quick and easy. I'll pan fry up a few breasts then put them in a casserole dish over a skim of marinara sauce to bake the next day for company. I serve them on a bed of spaghetti with more marinara and more Parmesan on the side

This is delish! I baked instead of fried and added one pat of butter on top of each breast before baking at 350 degrees for about 20 mins. Then I topped each breast with shredded mozzerella cheese and broiled. Made sauce from the Simple Parmesan Chicken recipe from this website. What an awesome combination!

This recipe is amazing! Seriously the best and easiest parmesan chicken I've ever made.  And super tasty! I changed a few things though.

First, I didn't have chicken breast so I used 6 chicken tenders instead.  I used fresh basil (approx. 1 TB) and added fresh thyme (approx. 1tsp).  I also used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil and dipped in the egg and EVOO, no butter.  After dredging through bread crumb mixture I laid them in a baking pan and sprinkled the remaining crumbs over chicken and thinly sliced 1 TB cold butter and laid this over chicken.  Then baked at 375* uncovered for about 30 minutes.  This was so tender and juicy I couldn't believe it! The butter on top gave it a nice crispy coating and wonderful flavor. 

I will be making this again many times I'm sure! My husband and 2 boys loved it!

The only change I made to this was that I baked it at 375 for 30 mins. It was a big hit, the whole family loved it. Thank you very much for such an easy, delicious meal!

The only changes I made were, I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs in the coating instead of regular bread crumbs. I then seared them for a few minutes on each side, then placed in the over at 375 for about 12-15 minutes. Delicious and easy!

WOW! I have never made chicken this good before. 
I listened to others and baked it rather than frying at 350 for 35 minutes. It was perfect. I put it in a glass baking dish after preparing it with cooking spray.
I didn't want to cut and flatten chicken breasts, and since some of the reviews said you needed to be sure they were flattened, I just used chicken tenders since they are already flat.
This will be a very common recipe in my house. This was a very good find!

I make this all the time but I usually add parsley instead of basil and I usually bake it.  We love it no matter how it is made.

I made this recipe tonite (doubled it) and served with linguine, sauce, salad and some nice bread. It was absolutely delicious, and my husband and sons loved it ~ there wasn't any left !!!!! I followed the recipe exactly, using Panko breadcrumbs as some reviewers suggested ~ Perfect !!!! My chicken cooked through in the time suggested, nice and crispy, done in the middle. I think the secret is, you need to make sure you have flattened the chicken as thin as suggested. I will definitely make this again :-)

My 6 year old adored this recipe and asked to add it to next week's menu.  That's rare from my picky little guy!  I did change the recipe a little bit.  I upped the parmesan to about 1/3 c.  I also added Italian seasoning, garlic powder & onion flakes.  I dipped the chicken in the egg, in the crumbs, back in the egg, and back in the crumbs for a thicker crust.  I cooked it on a cooling rack on a cookie sheet at 375 for 40 minutes.  Came out perfect.  I will make it again, but I will probably play with the spices a little more.

I have never made parmesan chicken before so I was worried that my family wouldn't like it. Was I wrong! I got requests for more just a couple of days later! I could not find my bread crumbs so I put a couple of pieces of bread in the toaster and then chopped up with the food processor. I tried the oven at first but the bottom was soggy so I then put the chicken in a frying pan. To make smaller portions, I sliced and then put on top of angel hair pasta with marinara sauce. My husband requested mozzarella melted on top...I was trying to be a little healthier...shhhh!

Great recipe, especially if you have picky eaters.  I baked mine at 375 for 30 minutes instead of frying.  As another suggessted I melted the butter and stirred it into the bread crumbs.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon garlic and 1/2 teaspoon oregano.  Moist and delish!

EASY and tasty.  Served with side of pasta, salad, italian bread.  Made extra and froze it before cooking (will bake it in casserole dish when thawed, probably, rather than pan frying).

This is an amazing recipe!  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added some extra basil and garlic salt and the melted butter to the bread crumb mixture.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and also dumped a jar of Ragu Garden Spaghetti Sauce on the bottom of my 9x13 glass pan and topped the breaded chicken with mozzarella cheese.  I baked it at 375 for 35 minutes.  It was perfect, wonderful and beautiful!!  It was excellent the next day too!  Easy and great flavor!!

This turned out great and was really easy to make. The breading had a good flavor and the chicken was really moist. I topped these with tomato sauce and mozerella cheese.

This recipe is sweet and simple.  The only thing I changed a bit was leave the basil out and add onion and garlic powder, salt and pepper.  My family loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I loved this recipe, thank you for sharing it!  I did make some changes however.  I used plain bread crumbs and added basil, oregano, and parsley flakes along with the parmesan cheese.  I used olive oil and and pan fried the chicken after I dipped them just to brown on each side.  I poured melted butter over the top and baked in the oven for ten min to finish cooking.  I served it with pasta sauce and mozzarella cheese on top with penne pasta tossed with parmesan cheese & a little salt, and garlic bread. My husband really praised me for it!

This was pretty good, but I think I overcooked them in the oven because they weren't as moist as everyone else boasts.  I'll make these again and really watch the time.  I did add butter to bread crumb mix before baking, as suggested by a reviewer.  I couldn't tell whether to use the canned grated Parmesan or real, so I used canned.  Next time I'll try real.

5 stars because it was easy and in addition it was delious!  Thumbs up from 5 of us!  Miracle!  I did make a creamy spinach sauce to put on top, but it didn't need it unless you were having company.  If you are looking for an easy family dinner that even the kids will love, this is it!  I am not saying this is a company dinner, though!

Fast and easy!! My 7 year old son was able to make this for dinner tonight and was very proud of the results. We baked the chicken in the oven instead of frying it and added garlic to the bread mixture for extra flavor. A hit with the whole family!

Yummy for my tummy! I've used a recipe very similar to this before, I was actually just looking up the recipe for cooking time.  I too add sauce and cheese and cover in fry pan for a minute or so and serve with thin spaghetti & remaining sauce.

My hubby makes this by first sauteing some fresh garlic in butter, then dipping the chicken in the sauteed butter, and then dipping the chicken in the parm/bread crumb  coating. Thus you can omit the egg and it comes out really crispy in the oven (or you could fry it as the recipe states.)

WONDERFUL!!! I was totally surprised at how good this was. I didn't have any eggs, so I just rolled them in melted butter. The bread crumbs stuck just as well as they would've with the egg. I prepared it in the frying pan as well, didn't see any need to bake them. Breasts were tender and juicy. My fiance' and VERY picky eight-year-old son LOVED it. My fiance' loves Chicken Parm, so I knew he'd be honest about whether it was good or not. So, Kudos to you Mollie! This one's a keeper, and its going in my recipe box!

This is an excellent recipe, I had an extra piece of chicken and used it to make chicken nuggets. One tip I offer is to let the chicken soak in a bowl of evaporated/canned milk for 30 min to an hour, it makes it extremely tender

My husband approved of this recipe!  Like a few other reviewers, I added butter to the Italian bread crumb mixture before coating the chicken, then put the chicken in a glass baking dish lightly coated with EVOO and marinara sauce with a few tablespoons of chopped garlic.  I baked it at 375 for 30 minutes.  In the last five minutes of baking, I melted mozzarella cheese on top of the chicken breasts.  To serve, I put the chicken breasts on top of spaghetti and covered everything with another layer of marinara.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, though I think marinating it in something like Italian dressing for a few hours before coating it with bread crumbs would add an additional layer of flavor to the meat.

Delicious!!! I added a bit of minced garlic and a pinch of red pepper flakes to the egg for some extra flavor. I also pan fried in extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil. Fantastic!! Next time I will try baking to cut down on fat but this was pretty perfect as is.

Even though I try not to fry anything in oil and butter, this is an outstanding recipe. I have made this several times using Panko or Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Both ways, it is delicious. For a nice addition, try the Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce with a teaspoon or two of Dijon mustard for a tasty addition to this chicken.

That recipe was very easy to make.  I had 4 large breast halves, so I had to increase the amount of eggs and breading.  I butterfly-cut the chicken so it would be thin enough.  It was very tasty with spaghetti.  Next time I'll put the cooked chicken in the oven with sauce and mozzarella.

I made this with my girlfriend last night. It was so easy to prepare, and it tasted fantastic. I used olive oil and butter, and I also put some garlic in the frying pan as well. Then we put the chicken on top of Penne noodles covered in tomato sauce, topped it all with some more parmesan cheese, and stuck it in the oven. Made a delicious meal, with plenty of left-overs.

This was very good!! (and according to my husband, very VERY good.  In fact after he finished his first helping he begged me to make another batch)  I didn't have any bread crumbs so I used flour and seasoned it with creole, italian seasoning, garlic powder, and a pinch of cayenne.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out delicious!!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe! :)

This was super easy and tasted great! Just add a little provalone and marinara on top and it's even better! I also baked the chicken for 35-40 min instead of frying it. Turned out delish!

We thought this came out very well. I don't know why some people had trouble getting their breading to stay on. Probably didn't dry their chicken enough before dipping it in the crumbs -- if you have too much loose egg, it will all slide off. I didn't really like the brand of breadcrumbs I used but that isn't the recipe's fault. Thanks for the recipe!

My sons and husband loved this. I used panko crumbs and freshly grated parmesan cheese. I served each chicken breast on a small mound of spaghetti wih sauce and grated parmesan cheese on top.

This is a great recipe to add old spices to get rid of them.  I add lots of Italian and my own dried lemon basil and a bit of garlic salt.

I love this quick and easy recipe!  The only modifications I make are to use chicken tenders to keep the serving size appropriate, panko bread crumbs, and instead of dried basil, use an Italian seasoning blend, white pepper and a little onion powder.  I use 3 tablespoons of olive oil heated high for quick searing each side then finish in the oven at 400 for 10 minutes.

Very tasty and moist. Like others I placed my chicken in a dish sprayed with cooking spray and baked at 350 for 40 minutes. Also added oregano and garlic powder to the coating mix. Simple and quick!

This was fun an delicious to make. I felt it was missing some spices because I only had plain bread crumbs to work with. So I added 1 tsp of sea salt, 3 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of drid parsley, increased the basil to 1 tsp, 1 tsp of cayanne pepper which set it off perfectly. I really enjoyed this. Thank you.

This was very good. I used shake n bake (basically bread crumbs), because that's all I had and I'm trying to clean out my cupboard, but it is a great recipe and I'm sure just as good with the bread crumbs!

The chicken came out a little dry but I may have overcooked it. Instead of cooking the chicken over the skillet, I followed another person's comment to bake it for 30mins at 375 degrees. In addition I mixed the butter and oil into the breading for a crispier texture.

Excellent!  I pounded the chicken to 1/4 inch and used them for chicken parmesan with spaghetti sauce.  Melted mozzarella on top.  YUM!

Loved this recipe.  I used panko bread crumbs and baked it instead of frying it so it'd be a little healthier.  Everyone loved it...even those who weren't that fond of chicken.  I'll definitely make it again.

Absolutly wonderful! The only thing I do differently is to bake it instead of frying. Much healthier and just as tasty. I add the butter to the bread crumbs before coating the chicken and I bake it at 375 for 30min always comes out juicy and tender! Great, easy recipe thanks!

I added oregano and black pepper.  I used panko bread crumbs.  I served this with the Chunky Marinara Sauce at the Allrecipes website.  We all thought it was delicious.  I also added some chopped garlic into the egg.

I made this last night and didn't follow to the tee.  I did bake it and was not able to keep the crispiness.  Also I found that it lacked it some flavor even though I added some powdered garlic, pepper and salt.  It was good, but not great.  I will definitely be trying again, but probably pan fry first.

My teenage daughter thought this was THE VERY BEST chicken I've ever made!  She thanked me so many times.  I think I'm a pretty good cook and I've made chicken dozens of ways, but this recipe will definitely be used again and again!  I followed the recipe with just slight variation... I didn't have plain breadcrumbs so I substituted Italian Breadcrumbs (they have a bit of seasoning in them already).  And the other thing I did differently was to cook it in a small amount of olive oil.  Crispy, tender, juicy and delicious!

This dish was absolutely fabulous!  I used Panko breadcrumbs, added garlic powder and didn't measure the dried basil.  I spread some pasta sauce on the bottom of a baking dish, coated the chicken as instructed, place on pasta sauce and baked in oven at 375 degrees for 30 mins.  I sprinkled mozzarella cheese over the chicken and placed back in the  oven until the cheese melted.  I served this with thin spaghetti and warm pasta sauce.  Will be making this dish again for sure.

Yep, I'll make it again and would serve it to guests. Nice recipe - easy, moist, tasty, and looks good on a plate. I made gravy with it but it was completely unnecessary. A little cayenne wouldn't hurt it a bit though :)

we used ingredients as written.  we baked rather than frying, 350 about 30 - 35 minutes.  breading was crunchy.  we added sauce and cheese to serve.  had tried it plain, as good as it is, we decided would be too dry by the time you were finished if eating plain.   very good, very easy

We enjoyed this simple recipe.  I used croutons for breading, doubled it and made sure the chicken was very thin.   I too baked it for 20 minutes at 375.  I also mixed the olive oil in with the breading before dipping the chicken in.  Very basic recipe.

Very Tasty!  Just one tip:  Dip the chicken breasts in seasoned flour before you dip it in the egg mixture.  The egg will coat the whole breast much better and the flour being seasoned will only add to the flavour!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used all natural cracker rounds (ground up) instead of bread crumbs.  Excellent flavor.  My family loved it.

Very easy, my family loved it and thought I had "bought" the chicken that way.  I used skinless boneless chicken thighs, and baked them in the oven for 20mins.

I have been making this for many years. My grandmother was Sicilian and had a slightly different version of this recipe. I have changed it somewhat. I use half breadcrumbs half Italian seasoned panko crumbs, the Parmesan cheese, and I fry the pieces in olive oil. If you want make a lemon butter sauce and serve along with the chicken. This recipe works well using very thin slices of sandwich steak. pound the the beef as you would the chicken everything else is the same. It's one of my family favorites.

I made this recipe several times. Last night I made a change that my husband thought was the best version so far. He likes hot wings and such so I added some mexican style seasoning in place of the basil and as always I baked it instead of frying. I liked it and husband loved it he shared with our son in law who immediately told me to give the recipe to my daughter.

Super easy! I also mixed the butter with the breading before coating the chicken.  Also for a low carb alternative, I used crushed pork skins in place of bread crumbs.  Our whole family loved it!  Thanks :)

Excellent.  We had it with 3 cheese manicotti from this website, a caesar salad and crusty roll.  Delicious. PS...Had it the next day on an Italian bun, with some marinara, mozzerella baked in a toaster oven till cheese melted.   Great leftover sandwiches.

Great recipe.  For those that want more Italian flavor, try adding Italian salad dressing to the egg and beating it together.  Dip the chicken in that mix and then the breadcrumb/cheese as directed.  I also season my breadcrumb mixture with Italian seasoning.  Olive oil and butter for cooking.

This recipe was a good basic start to parmesan chicken success. I agree completely with previous review entries where thin chicken is best. In the future, I'd like to try this recipe with chicken tenders and pair with a yummy sauce.

This was really really good. Now I don't have to wait for my husband to take me out to get Patmesan Chicken. Getting the chicken really really thin is a MUST. I could not get mine thin enough, so I finished it by baking it covered so it would cook through faster. It turned out good, but the breading was not crispy enough anymore. Of coarse I served it with tomatoe sauce and cheese over pasta. YUMMY, and my family LOVED it..and it was very easy.

This was very good. Pretty much followed directions except I baked at 425 for about 25 minutes as I didn't feel like taking the time to flatten the chicken. My cooktop was not working so I didn't brown the chicken on the stove either. When the chicken was almost done, I put some garlic bread in the oven, then sliced the chicken & melted provolone cheese on top. When garlic bread was done, I put chicken/cheese on the top to serve as open faced sandwiches with marinara sauce over the chicken & garlic bread. Yummy!

This get five stars for being so quick to put together. It was just what I was looking for today. Admittedly, I feel the chicken could have been just a bit more moist, but it was good nonetheless. I will definitely keep this one for busy days when I want chicken but can't wait for it to bake in the oven. Thanks so much!

This is easily the best chicken parm I have made.  I did make the following adjustments:  I used chicken tenders rather than breasts.  I pounded them to tenderize and pulled out that white strip they always have (what is that?) which nicely sectioned off some chicken nuggets for my two year old.  I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I put some whole grain saltines in the food processor along with parmigiano reggiano and some "pasta sprinkle" from Penzey's Spices.  It's a blend of sweet basil, turkish oregano, thyme and garlic.  I processed everything together until it was a light crumb consistency.  I used the egg and crumb coating as described.  Rather than pan frying, I put the chicken strips on a non-stick cookie sheet.  Following a previous reviewer's advice, I lightly brushed the chicken with melted butter before baking at 425 degrees for about 30 mins.  I did flip the chicken about 20 minutes in.  It browned perfectly and came out with a crispy coating I've never gotten out of an oven baked chicken.  I served it with the Tomato Basil Penne Pasta submitted by timbertiger on this site.  I noted my changes to that recipe in the reviews.  FANTASTIC meal!

I used boneless chicken thighs for this, instead of breasts (I prefer the flavor of thighs). It was crisp and flavorful.  It was easy and very good! I even submitted a photo of my version!

This turned out good, basic breaded chicken. After chicken cooked in skillet, I transfered to a baking dish, topped with marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese and baked covered. Chicken was not dry, and was flavorful.

it was so great, thank you! i made it for valentines day for my boyfriend and he loved it. a reviewer suggested mixing the butter with the crumbs before dipping the chicken in. i thought that it might get too lumpy, so instead, when the oven was heated, i put butter in the bottom of the pan i was going to use and let it melt, once the bottom was covered, i put the chicken inside and flipped it half way through the cooking time. it tasted SO wonderful. thanks a million for the recipe!

This was delicious, but I decided at the end to put the chicken in a glass dish, covered it with sauce and mozzarella cheese on 425 for 15 minutes then broiled it at the end to brown the cheese.

This is one of the easiest and better chicken recipes I have tried. I added a more parmesan cheese, because I just couldn't help it. We tried 2 recipes and compared them. We all agreed this was really good and came in a close second. It would also be wonderful with marinara sauce on top and a slice of melted provolone or mozzarella on top and served on a toasted bun as a sandwich. Thanks!!!

VERY NUMMY! I doubled the parmesan cheese. It's amazing how far chicken breasts go when you pound them down to 1/4" thick. I only used two half breasts for our family of 5 and we couldn't eat it all. Served on top of spaghetti noodles with "Chunky Marinara Sauce" (from allrecipes) on top.

Delicious! First I breaded the chicken in flour, then egg, then the breadcrumb mixture(which i added a little garlic salt)....i just think that helps it to stay on the best. Then I cooked the chicken in olive oil, topped with a little spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese and broiled it for a few mins until cheese started to turn a little brown....served over spaghetti. VERY GOOD!!!

This was AWESOME!! I smashed the chicken down, and cooked it 12 min on each at 350 and for the last 5 min I added PROVOLONE cheese on top...that was PERFECT! I made pene noodles and poured Ragu Spagatti sauce on top..served with green beans....What a wonderful meal...

SUPER EASY - I can whip this up after work and have dinner on the table in less than a 1/2 hour.  I like to use Japanese style bread crumbs for a more textured breading - just add in the seasonings of your choice.

I have made this several times - both for regular dinners and company.  It has always been a hit!  I have tried slight variations (like using a combo of romano & parmesan cheese) and it always comes out great!!

This was really good & easy. I baked it for an easier clean-up and used 1 tbs butter in bread/cheese mixture & put some mozarella over the top when almost finished like others. I never thought to add butter to the bread crumbs, it made it crispy in the oven.

I was looking for a quick/easy chicken parmesan and this was it!  As it was finishing I melted some shredded mozzarella over it and served it atop a bed of penne.  I topped it with Bertollli burgundy wine marinara and it was AMAZING!  I cut the recipe in half for 2 and it was still too much to eat!  I'll be making this again for sure.  Big hit with the girlfriend :)

Rarely does my family sit down to a meal & all 5 of us love it. This was delish!!! I used my Italian seasoning grinder & put fresh parmesan on after it was cooked (not in the breading). Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic!  I have made about 4 times in the last few weeks because my husband and I love it so much.  After a few times, I decided to try it on my george foreman grill and it was great.  I just coated the grill with the melted butter and oil with a brush and it still came out a nice golden brown.  This will be a staple of my future cooking!  It is easy to make, very little ingredients, all of which I regularly keep in stock anyway and it's delicious!  Thank you!

This was so delicious!  I added some black pepper, Kosher salt, and, because I like a little heat, some cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes to the crumb mixture.  My husband and I just loved it!

Tastes great, flattening the chicken was the hardest part.  I used Italian bread crumbs, added a little garlic powder, and left out the basil because I didn't have it. Will make again.

I’m a young cook and made this for the first time on my own and it went great! I like my chicken thick though so I also varied the cooking. I put it in the pan and friend it up a little before putting it in the oven. I made some spaghetti and mushrooms as a side to make a wonderful dinner.

I baked mine in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes.    Served with a light marinara and broad egg noodles and a side of lightly sauteed broccoli, lightly seasoned with italian spices.

Next time I think that I would add more basil, garlic, and oregano to the bread crumb mixture.  Also I would like to try it with an herb sauce, just to make it a little different.

Very good recipe,and easy to make. I did use boneless skinless chicken tenders, and put them in oven. Do not cook over 30 minutes as they will be dry. Next time I will try frying them in oil, and use checiken breasts instead of tenders

I think the great reviews on this dish made my expectations too high. The chicken was OK but I probably won't make it again. If you do I would recommend letting it drain on a paper towel after cooking.

This was so delicious! It smelled so good in our apartment when I was frying them and tasted better than the breaded chicken i've had from most restaurants.  Paired it with just simple spaghetti and sockarooni sauce which made a delicous dinner.  Will definitely make this again and will try with other pasta variations.  Thanks for sharing this simple recipe.

I used the advice of one reviewer that said they added a pinch of garlic, plus melted butter into the bread crumbs and then baked it in the oven for a healthier version and we loved it.

This is the best recipe I have tried.  The breading actually stayed on the chicken.  I used boneless thighs instead of breasts as my husband prefers dark meat.  I then put some spaghetti sauce in the bottom of a 13x9 pan, put in the chicken, topped it with sliced provolone and mozzarella and baked it for 20 minutes.  My husband wasn't crazy about that, but loved the chicken.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is delicious.  What an amazing and easy dish.  Hubby came home while cooking immediately said "wow it smells amazing in here."  That was all I needed to hear.  Dinner was done in less than 15 minutes.  Thanks for the post...will use over and over again.

Delicious! I made the serving for two and as the chicken breasts were cooking in the skillet, I cut them up into bite-size pieces and dashed some garlic powder and extra parmesan cheese. This cooked the chicken evenly and added more flavor. We served it last night over some fettucini and yummy speghetti sauce. Today's leftover lunch tasted even more spectacular! Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

This is an excellent recipe and I wouldn't change a thing!  I put it under the broiler with mozarella cheese and then served it over spaghetti and topped with spaghetti sauce.  My family couldn't get enough and I will make this again and again....

So yummy! Will make this one again. I pretty much followed the recipe with a few minor changes. I used panko because that's what I had on hand, sub'd olive oil for the veg. oil, and added a bit more parmesan cheese. I ended up cooking the chicken on medium heat for 4 minutes + low heat for 2-3 minutes on each side.  Next time, I'd like to try it with the seasoned bread crumbs and/or try the garlic, oregano and/or other spices.

I have made this before and forget to rate it so,,,my bf while tonight eating a hot dog requested this.He is Italian and knows his food.Anyway,I use a maranara from former chef's
site and cover it with mozzarella then bake.So easy and so good!!Not a meal you forget easily but you do want to use this method for the chicken.He is not a chicken fan but for this recipe and marsala.

This recipe really was super easy and super tasty!! I followed the recipe almost exactly - the only think I did differently was added more spices and cheese to the bread crumbs. My husband and I both loved it and this will definitely be a regular dish for us.

The chicken was quite good, but since my mom doesn't like Parmesan cheese, we melted it over the top of the chicken. The breading didn't adhere well to the meat, but it was still quite good!

I hardly ever write reviews. Others seem to say it all for me! But- this is by far the best chicken I have ever made. I can see using this recipe for many things. It was so flavorful and tender! My daughter loved it. I did use just a little Wegmans basting oil in the pan with the butter for flavor, but that was the only thing I did different. So happy to have this recipe, thank you!

For diet reasons I baked this @ 375 for 30 min, spraying the tops with butter spray (and therefore omitting the butter & veggie oil).  It was good but nothing special - I would have only rated this a 3 but my husband loved it.  I think part of my problem is I only had panko & store bought shredded parm - so the breading was quite chunky.  I think I would have liked it better with grated parm to help the coating cover the chicken better, but I love panko for it's crunch.  I will probably be making this again.

While it is a bit of work to prepare this along with sauce and noodles it is well worth it. I could eat this over and over. And it makes very good and versatile leftovers.

This was great..i made some changes.  I used parmesan herb panko instead of bread crumbs to the coating.  I added onion powder, oregano, dried basil leaves, italian seasoning, and garlic salt.  Fried in olive oil and Just before chicken was done, i put more parmesan on top and melted.  Beautiful and delicious.

Delicious and easy. I made the modifications suggested by the 'most helpful' commenter: baked it at 375 and used butter and additional Italian spices in the breadcrumb mixture. With 10 minutes to go, I topped the breasts with pasta sauce and more parmesan.

My husband loves this chicken recipe better than any dish he can get in a restaurant.  It's incredibly easy, looks beautiful and tastes even better. Whatever you do, don't skip the Parmesan!  The cheese elevates this from just another breaded chicken to something extraordinary. I made my own bread crumbs from dried bread and italian seasoning, as I prefer them over the finely ground (read: pulverized to powder) products I usually find in the store.  I would love a recommendation.

I absolutely love this recipe! I did change a few things. I made a spagetti sauce with onions and green peppers I did use canned spagetti sause but added a teaspoon of onion powder and garlic powder. I also added basil and black pepper. I made a few changes to the dry mix, I had to use more bread crumbs, added Tony Chachere's creole seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder,basil and about 3/4 cup of parmesan cheese. I browned the chicken on the stove first then put them in a glass casserole dish with the spagetti sauce on the bottom and smothered in mozzerella cheese. Cooked at 375 for 5 minutes covered and 5 minutes uncovered. Served on top of spagetti noodles. DELICIOUS!

AWESOME, AMAZING...I also top with marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese and bake in the oven for 5 minutes or until cheese is melted. I serve it with spinach fettuccine with alfredo sauce and a veggie like broccoli. I would make this all the time if the meal itself wasn't so fattening, so it has become a special occasion meal.

Wonderful recipe as is!  Simple for children who do not like to see stuff in their food!  We cook a total of 18 breasts (split in half) so we skip the frying and just bake.  The chicken is as tender as can be.  For personal liking we add some ingredients; first we have thick breasts so we cut in half, then we coat the chicken in a chicken pepper seasoning blend, then dip in the bread crumb mixture which is homemade cornbread crumbs, parmesan cheese, basil and garlic.  We bake as recommended for 35 minutes at 425.  THANK YOU for this wonderful recipe - as I said even with no changes it is wonderful

Nice and simple and tasty and fast. 

I rarely have time for prep or baking, so I'll definitely make this again. I think next time I'll adding some salt and pepper or other spices to the breading mix as it was a bit bland.

Tried oven baking and it came out a bit dry. Would probably be more moist if pan fried like suggested.

Kids AND Hubby said this was the best tasting chicken I'd cooked in a long time - very moist. I did allow the chicken to soak in the egg yolk for 1 hour. But surprisingly, it took me less than  20 minutes to cook with not much attention! Saved this one to my recipe box.

Easy to make, but after several tries, I've still yet to figure out how to make the cheese stick better. I've resorted to putting a layer of cheese right into the frying pan and putting the chicken on top so it fries on. Also, make sure you flatten your chicken breasts to an even thickness (about a quarter or half an inch) first, or else cooking will take too long and will result in tough, dry chicken.

Delicious. I did make the changes I saw most often (pound chicken, 1/2 the egg & breading mixture, and put cheese on during last 5 min). I also noticed "med-high was a tad high for sautéing the chicken, resulting in the outside being cooked and the inside not so much. So I lowered the temp to med-low after the first one I did. Everything else was FAB.

I really liked this parm chicken. I would have given 5 stars but I made a few errors. 
1. Be sure your chicken breast are not to thick. This really makes or breaks this recipe. 
2. The sauce I used did not do this justice.

Hoping for a 5 on my next attempt.

It was absolutely delicious! I am not a good cook by any means, but this was relatively simple to make and the girlfriend loved it.    I ended up doing what others suggested and set it in the oven for 30 minutes at 375 degrees rather than using the stove.

Pretty good! My chicken was a little dry though but i guess that would be my fault. Next time i will use chicken breast halves instead of whole. I will it make again though. It easy, quick and good!

This was very good. As other reviewers suggested, I baked the chicken at 350 for about 30 minutes instead of frying. It turned out great- my kids loved it.

Very good!  We have a recipe that is similar, only it is baked.  They pretty much taste the same, but I do like that this version gets a bit more crispy.  Served with a side of roasted carrots with honey.  Mmmm.

Have made it a couple of times and always turns out delicious. The only thing that I do differently is to place the chicken breasts into the oven instead of frying it in the skillet. Definitely a keeper : )

Very simple and good!  Used the Best Marinara Sauce Yet found on all recipes and kids and adults alike enjoyed!  Definitely something you could prepare and serve for "company coming" meal.

IT'S A HIT AT MY HOUSE!!! My son is so picky I didn't think he would enjoy this.  I added additional seasonings as recommended in other reviews...otherwise I cooked as instructed.  I cooked it for the first time last week and he woke up for school asking for it again for dinner tonight.

For me it tasted too "fried," but still sooo yummy!!  I have a recipe close to this but not quite.. sauté the chicken till a nice golden color, put in a baking pan, add a little ceaser dressing then add the bread crumb/parmesan mix and put it in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until its done on 450.  yummmmm

This is such a quick and delicious recipe to make. I've made it several times and have taken the advice of others by adding garlic salt, onion powder, and a little more basil. I think I will try baking it next time for a healthier version.

Juicy, crispy chicken--I used oregano as well. This even worked with freshly grated Parmesan.

This was delicious! We were even able to trick our 2-year-old into eating it (he hates chicken).  I did read it wrong and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil (which is why I only gave 4 stars), but apparently that was fine because I loved this dish!

Very similar to a baked Garlic Chicken recipe, from this site,  except that I sautéed this and loved it.  Freezes well! I live alone and I am always looking for recipes to make and then freeze in portions.  This one I doubled and froze most of it.  Since it thaws so quickly it is handy for a quick lunch or dinner.  Also great for sandwiches.

I loved how the parmesan gave the chicken a nice cruchy texture when cooked.  I gave it a spash of Tapatio hot sauce to spice it up a bit.

I have made this a couple of times baked and fried in evoo.  I like the evoo version better and since the chicken is "hammered thin" it is very tender and easy for young ones to enjoy.

Love this recipe. I normally just use the egg & bread crumbs.  But adding the parmesan cheese and basil made a huge difference. My husband absolutely loved it. Thank you very much for sharing.

I wasn't sure what I was going to make for dinner, and I looked in my e mail and I saw this recipe.  Super easy,  and I had all of the ingredients in the house.  I love when that happens!!  I made with new potatoes roasted in the oven with salt, pepp, and italian seasoning.  Delish!  Hubby even wants me to make it again tonight!

Very good! I did change it a little by following some of the sugestions, such as: baking it in the oven.  I used Panko bread crumbs instead of regular. It made lighter. Very good.  Husband says it is a keeper and remake.

This was a SIMPLE and easy dish to make I only used 3 breast but once you pound them flat they are very large. We could cut these with a fork they were so tender and the crust held in the moisture in so the breast were really tender and juicy! I LOVE this recipe!!! Thank!!

My husband, who is a very picky eater, loved this! I did use Kellogg's Corn Flakes crumbs instead of bread crumbs and fresh basil instead of dried. A very good recipe that can be easily spiced up by adding marinara, or serving with pasta.

This recipe rocks!! I added garlic powder to my bread crumb mixture and fresh crushed garlic (can you tell we LOVE garlic!?!) to my oil and butter mixture (I also used olive oil). I made whole wheat pasta and heated a jar of spaghetti sauce. Best new meal I have added in a long time! Family LOVES it and I will be making this on a regular basis. Thank you!!

This chicken was delish.  I took other's recommendations and baked the chicken at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  It was perfect - so juicy and flavorful.  Next time I might add more spices to the bread crumbs and melt butter to add to the breadcrumbs before breading the chicken, just to get a crispier coating.  This is a keeper.

I really liked this recipe.  I did add some thyme and garlic salt like the review suggested.  I also mixed half panko and seasoned whole wheat bread crumbs... just trying to use up things mainly.  Loved it!  (I baked it like others suggested and it turned out lovely.)

Loved it. In an effort to keep the fat down, I opted for baking as previous reviewers recommended. Instead I laid the breaded chicken on foil lined cookie sheets and sprayed with a light coating of cooking spray. I used very thin chicken breasts so I baked at 375 for 20 min. It probably could have been 15. They came out crispy and delicious!

We love this recipe.... it used to be that once a month or so we would go out just so that we could get Chicken Parm... not any more.. I can throw it together now in about 20 minutes! I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it... and it was so incredible... moist inside, crispy outside! everyone was looking for thirds. This time around i'm going to follow the suggestion and add a bit of garlic to the egg mixture... and maybe will even let the chicken soak in it until hubby's home from work

Fast and simple to 'throw together' for a restaurant style meal.  I recommend using a tenderizer or meat pounder (other side of the tenderizer, forget proper name) and make sure the chicken is the thickness the recipe calls for (otherwise it doesn't cook through) and ALWAYS put make sure the pan with oil/butter is HOT before the meat goes in, otherwise chef Gordon Ramsey (Hell's Kitchen) says it will absorb the oil and affect taste. Ha Ha.  Great dish, looks pleasing if you make a side of spaghetti, this dish should be topped with a red sauce or alfredo.

This was wonderful!!! I'm just starting to get into the kitchen and this was easy to follow. I didn't burn it, dry it out, or mess up:-) The taste was awesome and I couldn't believe I had made it.

What a perfect chicken parm. recipe! Finally one with a nice slightly crunchy crust, no sogginess, rich flavor, breading holds the juices in well. I have made this about 4 times now and it's definitely a keeper!!! By the way- if you don't have bread crumbs on hand try crushing croutons instead. Did this the first couple of times I made this and it was soooo good!!!

Good basic recipe.  Improves  if you first brine your chicken.  I used 4 chicken tenders and  the whole stated recipe  amounts so I double dipped, allowing the first dip to set for 10 minutes before dipping again.

Very easy to prepare and VERY tastey!  I will absolutely make this again!  Even my husband who, in 12 yrs of marriage has never complimented anything I have made, said that this was "very good".    I used Olive Oil instead of vegetable oil and used fresh grated Parmesan both in the recipe and as a topping after it was done cooking.  Thank you for this recipe!

I followed the recipe almost exactly except I browned in olive oil and used whole wheat Italian bread crumbs to make it a little more healthy.  It had good flavor and was great served over noodles and marinara sauce with broccoli and breadsticks on the side.

This is a pretty good recipe, especially when you need dinner quick or are pinching pennies. I halved the recipe for my small household, and served with steamed vegetables dusted in lemon pepper and olive oil. I agree with previous reviews on the subject of baking rather of frying, but either way yields something delicious!

This was a quick and easy fix for dinner. I seasoned the flour with Italian seasoning and some garlic salt. My family asked for a little extra salt but that is a taste thing. My husband absolutely loved it and he is not much for Italian food. I browned the chicken. I served with marinara sauce and Mozzarella cheese. I  baked about 20 min. until the cheese melted. Added a side of spaghetti and had a great meal in less than an hour. Thanks for another fantastic reciepe!!!!!

I like that you have all the ingredients at hand! It is yummy too! I went with other recommendations and added more basil, equal amount of garlic salt, and a bit of thyme. You need to also follow the directions and make sure the chicken is flattened. YUM!!!

My husband loved this!  I cooked the chicken 3-4 minutes each side, layered it on some penne pasta & italien sausage spaghetti sauce, covered the whole thing in mozzarella & parmesan and baked for 25 minutes at 350.  My husband who is Mr. Picky Eater said I could make this every week and raved about it!

This was easy, and surprisingly delicious.  I butterflied the breasts, pounded them super thin, and cooked them on a hot stainless steel skillet.  I had no breadcrumbs, and used cornmeal (!!).  Pretty pathetic,  I know, yet still, it  was (to quote my fiancee) "excellent."  Plus, I had dinner on the table in like 20 minutes!  Not bad, huh?

This chicken was so yummy and quick. I used a pound of chicken tenderloins and they cooked up so quick. I did use panko bread crumbs in place of the breadcrumbs, but that was the only change that I made. Will def. make again, my 19 month old LOVED this! Thanks.

My family thought this was really good!  It had a great flavor to it, it stayed very moist and I personally thought that the best part was the small amount of time it took to prepare it.  I followed the recipe exactly with no changes or substitutions-- this is definitely a chicken dinner that I will make again!

This was my first attempt at Chicken Parmesan and it was a success!  I did forget to add the Parmesan cheese to the crumbs but it was fine without it.  The chicken, which I pounded thin, was very moist and juicy.  Like others suggested I added a sauce (out of a jar), topped with cheese and baked at 375 for 15 minutes.  Next time I'll bake at 400 for 20 minutes and remember to add the Parmesan cheese, of course.

Simple, easy to make and delicious!  I used Italian Breadcrumbs and added dried basil for more flavour... Baked it for 20mins at 200C...

This was my first time making Parmesan Chicken and this was really tasty, moist, juicy in the inside and crispy on the outside. I also made a few changes, since I did not have bread crumbs at hand i used crushed ritz crackers, instead of just basil, I used the Italian seasoning,and garlic salt and this made this recipe very tasty. I fried it in butter and vegetable oil, I will try to bake next time for a more healthy version. Thanks again for this easy but yet great recipe.

My family really liked this.  I followed the recipe as written, and used thin-cut chicken breasts.  Mine browned a little too much in the skillet, even when I reduced the heat a bit, but it didn't really matter, because I transferred the cooked chicken to a pan and topped it with some marinara and mozzarella.  5 minutes on 425 gave it a nice finish without getting soggy like some of the other reviewers.  My husband said that his only complaint was that I should have made more of it!

Excellent recipe!  I've made this dish a few times for my family.  The serving platter empties quickly and my kids  always ask when we'll be having Parmesan Chicken again.  As for the an earlier review about the cooking temp... I use an oversized electric fry pan to maintain an even cooking temperature for perfect results. ;)

Easy, fast and simple. However, watch the temperature when browning,they brown quickly. I was afraid I had burned them a little, but was very surprised they were great.

I LOVE this recipe!! I take it up another step.  After cooking chicken I place in baking dish and cover with a jar of pasta sauce, about a cup of mozzarella, and parmesan chees and bake in 400 degree oven until the cheese is melted.

Very good simple rendition of a classic, I just seasoned the chicken pre egg with a bit of salt and pepper.  Turned out extremely tasty.  Thank you for the excellent recipe.

Very good with additions. I added some yogurt to the whipped egg. To the batter I added a bith more cheese some cayenne powder, Italian seasoning, onion powder and rosemary. After I flattened the chicken I cut each (lengthwise) into two pieces, I find that it is easier to cover them this way and eating smaller portions is better for you anyway. I also melted some cheese on top of the chicken while it cooking in the pan. Great recipe and thanks for posting it!

Me and my husband LOVE italian food and absolutely love the chicken parm you get at the cheesecake factory. We are currently living in Germany and sad we don't have some of our favorite resturants around, but love all recipes to find and discover new ones. This one is a 5 star all the way. Number 1 its so easy, I myself could not believe how easy the recipe is to prepare and how fast it can be on the table. To top that Number 2 it tastes SO good! Way better than the picture could ever give it credit for. If you haven't tried the recipe yet, what are u waiting for! My husband asks for this all the time, he loves it!

Excellent!  Very easy & tasty.  I only needed 2 chicken breasts.  I also did as another reviewer suggested & added the melted butter to bread crumbs and added thyme, oregano & garlic powder.  ( I sprinkled the extra crumbs on the chicken before baking.)  Baked in the oven at 375 for 30 min.  Excellent with some spaghetti sauce on the bottom (about 1/2 a jar).

Delicious! I've made this dish before using another recipe, but I took the suggestions of other reviewers and it turned out great! I flattened the chicken to approx. 1/4" in a plastic baggie using a meat tenderizer tool. Then used the olive oil/garlic salt instead of egg and used plain breadcrumbs (less sodium) and added in basil, parmesan cheese, oregano, parsley, and garlic powder. Sprinkled shredded mozz. cheese (covering it with foil for half of cooking time to avoid burning cheese ~ 30 mins. at 375 degrees F)and served over spaghetti and additional tomato sauce. Yum! Will be making this again!

I will use this recipe again.  I skipped the egg and just breaded the chicken immediately after I washed it.  Yes, the breading sticks. In addition to the ingredients listed, I added oregano, black pepper and garlic powder to the breading mixture.

Great 'go to' recipe for a busy day - quick, easy, and much healthier than take-out.  I did bake the chicken at 375 degrees instead of frying.  Also, in place of the vegetable oil and butter, I mixed 1-2 tsp olive oil in with the bread crumb mixture before coating the chicken.  Makes the chicken very crispy and yummy! Be careful not to over-cook.  Check after 15 to 20 minutes.

This was really good! I've made it a couple times but I bake it instead of frying. I've also topped it at the end with some spagetti sauce and a slice of mozzarella or provalone and put it bake in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese.

This is a fantastic recipe.  Followed exactly as written with one change - I filleted the chicken instead of pounding it out.  This is divine in chicken parmesan.  Can't wait to make it again!

Pretty easy, cooks up quickly, and tastes like restaurant chicken parmesan! Served it over a bed of angel hair spaghetti and with Emeril's marinara sauce (from a jar).

Whoa...great recipe!  I used the baked version from one of the other reviewers...I couldn't believe how easy this recipe is!  I used the white sauce that Aaron McCargo used on the Next Food Network Star...it makes the dish a five!  This recipe is NOW my husband's favorite.  He wants it every week!

I made this last night for my 2 bachelor roommates and they loved it. I think I used too much garlic so next time I'll cut down a little. The cooking time was perfect- the last 5 minutes I added a slice of provolone cheese to the chicken breasts and I served it with spaghetti sauce and pasta. Will make this one again, thanks!

This recipe was very good. It had a lot of flavor and the chicken was very moist. I do wish it had been crunchy on the outside. I think it was because of the amount of butter that is called for. Next time I will make it by dipping the chicken in egg instead and only drizzling a slight amount of butter/garlic on it before I bake it.

Wow!!  Made this for dinner on 
Friday and it was GREAT!  I didn't have the seasoned bread crumbs on hand so I used plain and added garlic powder, onion powder, seasoned salt and pepper along with the other ingredients and the flavor was wonderful...I didn't have a problem with it not being crispy...I served it with red sauce and thin spaghetti and italian cheese blend on top...I felt the chicken was good enought to eat alone!  Definately a keeper...thanks for the recipe!!

I don't really like the sweetness of basil so instead I used just the generic Itailian seasoning instead. I also put some marinara sauce on top like they do in the restaurants.

I followed this recipe but then put chicken in the oven on a bed of marinara sauce.  I used Emeril's marinara.  I baked it for 10-15 minutes depending  on thickness of chicken. Thinner sliced chicken turns out better. Added a blend of parmesan and motzerella to the top to melt.  Kids love it and they are picky eaters.

I made this last night and it was fantastic.  I followed another's advice and melted the butter into the dry mixture before coating the chicken.  I also baked it.  It came out crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Delicious!

I baked it in the oven instead of frying it. Also, I used Shake 'n Bake instead of bread crumbs. The coating was crispy and the chicken was moist.

This is a quick and easy recipe.  It was very good and easy to throw together on a hectic night.  I served this with the traditional pasta and spaghetti sauce but it would be awsome by itself with veggies.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Bf made this for us for dinner tonight.  It's very good.  He screwed up a bit and mixed the egg with the breading, so he had a hard time getting it to stick to the chicken, but that's his fault, not the fault of the recipe.  He served with veggies, spaghetti, and tomato sauce.  Yum.

I LOVE CHICKEN PARMESAN, HOWEVER I MAKE THIS RECIPE A LITTLE DIFFERENT.I USE PLAIN BREAD CRUMBS WHICH I SEASON MYSELF. I ADD BLACK GROUND PEPPER, GARLIC POWDER, GOYA POWDERED CHICKEN BOUILLON, AND THE GRATED PARMESAN CHEESE.ADD A LITTLE SALT TO THE BEATEN EGG. USE XTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL TO FRY UNTIL GOLDEN BROWN.I COAT A LARGE BAKING PAN WITH MARINARA SAUCE AND ADD GRATED PARMESAN CHEESE ALL OVER, I ADD THE FRIED CHICKEN AND BAKE FOR 20 MINUTES, ITS DELICIOSO,, SERVE IT WITH SPAGETTI OR ANY PASTA. I LOVE IT WITH WHITE RICE.

This was so yummy!! I didn't have bread crumbs on hand the first time I made it so I used Rosemary and Olive Oil Triscuits that I put in the food processor. It added a really nice flavour, and I've made this recipe 4 o5 5 more times the same way. Very good!

This is good as is, but better if you take it one step further- follow this receipe exactly, then add a splash of pasta sauce to the bottom of a 13X9 pan, place the chicken on top, add more sauce and motz cheese and bake for 15 minutes.  To me, this is tru parmesan chicken!  I serve this with Orzo.

This was very good.  I oven fried the chicken breast and served them over spagetti and topped with marinara suace and some mozzarella cheese. My 4 and 2 year old kiddos loved it!  I will definately fix this again.

I have to admit, I was skeptical of this recipe working out, the chicken breasts looked all pale for a good bit of the cooking time.  Then I let it do its thing in the oven and lo and behold, perfect golden brown delicious parmesan chicken, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.

I used the baking method recommended by pretty much everyone here.  Also I melted the butter into the bread crumbs.  I grated the Parmesan fresh into the bread crumbs, I don't even have one of those green boxes in my kitchen.

Definitely a five star recipe after alteration.

Tastes like something I've already had but with chicken tenders. 

Used egg substitute instead of eggs to make it healthier and because I've learned that it's easier to bread chicken coated in that.  Also didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I added some italian seasoning to the plain bread crumbs.  Baked for 30 minutes at 375F as others have done, but the chicken didn't get brown as I had hoped.

This is a great recipe - the chicken came out moist and tenderful, and flavorful. We used some spaghetti sauce in a 9x12 pan, and laid the chicken on top to bake, covered for a 1/2 hour. Perect!

This was awesome!  I did as another suggested and added basil and oregano to the coating and after lining the pan with spaghetti sauce, I baked the chicken in the pan for 20 minutes, added a slice of swiss cheese to the top with more spaghetti sauce and baked 15 minutes longer.  Served on spaghetti and it was a great dish!

this was good! thank you! i would have given it more stars but i did make some big changes: i used cheese and garlic croutons crushed instead of bread crumbs. I didnt use the parm cheese. and i baked the coated chicken in oven for 20 min or when done, then poured a very warm tomato sauce over the chicken when ready to serve so the chicken didnt get soggy. finally garnished with shredded mozerella cheese on top! yum!

This was quick and easy and tasted wonderful!  I used thinly sliced chicken breasts because I figured they would cook more quickly.  Once the chicken was finished I poured my sauce around the chicken and sprinkled mozarella over all of it.  I covered and simmered until the cheese was melted.  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

This was very good and pretty easy. After I pounded my chicken breasts, I seasoned them with garlic powder and salt and pepper.  I added lots of seasoning to the bread crumb mixture (I used Panko Japanese breadcrumbs: rosemary, thyme, parsley, basil, oregano, marjoram (pretty much any italiany spices I had on hand).  I oven fried my chicken: after I egged and breaded the chicken I sprayed each piece with Pam and baked at 375 for about 30 min and then I put them in a casserole dish with spaghetti sauce on the bottom and sprinkled with cheese and baked for a little longer.

This was awesome!!! I could not believe how easy it was. Rarely is soemthing this easy so good to impress your family and guests with. I served it with angel hair pasta and homemade marinara sauce. I did have to sautee it for a lot longer than 6 minutes though. I wish i had pounded the chicked breasts to make them even throughout.

Pretty Good recipe.  I crushed some Roasted Garlic Stove Top in place of the bread crumbs, and added some crushed red pepper flakes for some extra flavor.  My beef eating husband even liked the chicken when prepared like this.  My picky kids didn't enjoy it though.

I used this chicken for Chicken Parmasana, putting sauce and cheese on it after it had been cooked in the pan. Baked for 15-20 minutes, served over spagetti. It came out soggy - crispiness didn't hold up. Will have to try this without the sauce and cheese.

we thought this dish was very good however i think that pounding the chicken so thin then breading it took away from the actual tenderness & taste of the chicken. thanks anyway mollie, next time i'll reduce the pounded height to 1/2" & see what happens.

I used Italian breadcrumbs and it was absolutely delicious!  Great for a tasty mid-week dinner.  My husband and I eat the leftovers on sandwiches for lunch.  Yum!

The best!  I made this dish this evening for my family and my parents, and it was a hit with everyone.  As some of the previous reviews, I served it over pasta w/ spaghetti sauce, and I also put mozzeralla cheese on top and broiled it for a few secs.  I made a big salad and some garlic cheese toast!  We loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe.

So quick and easy! Like some other reviewers, I baked it at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes. I would suggest adding a few extra seasonings (I added salt and a little paprika). A great way to prepare chicken.

Fantastic dish.  I was looking for a flavourful, easy, simple chicken parmesan recipe and this was the one that impressed.  As a nice finish I baked the chicken in the oven with pasta sauce and topping of parmesan after browning it in the skillet.

Outstanding!! I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a little cracked black pepper to the parmesan mixture and combining the melted butter and eggs before dipping the meat. It smelled so good while it was cooking. Ill make this again for sure!

This was an excellent dinner!  My husband loved this so much he said, "however you got this recipe, print it, save it, whatever... just don't lose this one".  So it is definitely a keeper and so easy!  I added some mozzarella on top to melt near the end and some green onions. Also, I always sub olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

This recipe is so tasty and easy to make. I didn't have all of the ingredients so I substituted oregano and canola oil where needed! I think I borrowed some bread crumbs from a box salad mix I had, and then toasted some extra bread for the rest. I then used the Parmesan cheese mix from kraft! Great recipe and the family loved it.

I used panko bread crumb and shredded parmesan rather than grated and a tsp of my mccormicks italian seasoning grinder. We used smart balance oil and no butter to make it a little healthier and it was absolutely wonderful! My 2 year old even loved it!

This recipe knocked it out of the park.
I used panko instead of bread crumbs and took the suggestion to add the melted butter to the panko. I also pureed garlic and added it to the butter while it was melting. Perfect.
I used mayo cut with milk and a couple of eggs for the dipping before coating with the bread crumb mixture. It was the best I have ever had and so many positive comments. I feed about 40 people this dish and it was very easy.

Made this tonight for dinner, thought it was good. Didn't like the bread crumbs I used, but will definitely
make this again. The chicken was very moist. I also topped mine with mozzarella cheese and spaghetti sauce.

This was delicious!  I added some garlic and onion powder to the breading mixture, and some chopped garlic to the butter/oil.  I think it really helps enhance the flavors.  Also, after the chicken was finished in the pan, I topped with a bit of mozzarella cheese and broiled in the oven for 2-3 minutes.  The cheese comes out perfectly bubbly, and it doesn't over-cook the chicken!  I served over spaghetti and marinara sauce.  We will definitely be having this again.

This is an amazing recipe! I made this for my wife on Valentines day and she loved it! The only thing i changed is I used breast tenderloins instead of whole breasts and i added a little milk to the egg. I can't wait to prepare this recipe again!

Very easy to make and was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone!
I only had boneless chicken thighs so cut them up and pounded those instead, was still juicy and yummy. I decided to use garlic salt instead of plain salt, and mixed herbs, lots of flavour this way. I looove parmesan and sneaked a bit extra into the mixture! Then instead of butter, I fried them in ghee as it doesnt burn. I also let them sit for a bit in the fridge then on the side before frying which i think helps the batter mix stay on the chicken better while cooking! 
Served with little herbed roast potato cubes n green beans with a little garlic butter. 
All plates were cleared and extras eaten as seconds!

I really like this recipe, mainly because of its simplicity and how easy it was to cook.  Everything came out great, however I thought it was somewhat bland.  Here is what I added to the basic recipe: 1/2 tsp ea. of salt, pepper, oregano, garlic powder, italian seasoning, & cayenne pepper. Also I recommend using two eggs instead of one.
These additions add much more flavor overall without taking away from the core recipe.  Of course, there are still many variations - salt vs. garlic salt, pepper vs. ground/cracked pepper, etc.  Essentially you can make this as spicy or tasty as you'd like, but even if you use the original recipe you will be pleased with the result.

Excellent!  Used olive oil rather than veg oil.  Moist chicken, good flavor, fast cook and prep time.  Will be making regularly - family loved it!  Served with long grain and wild rice.

This was good but could use more seasoning in the bread/cheese mix.  I added salt and pepper to it and still felt it was lacking a bit.  Good recipe to play around with though!

These were pretty good, but I do agree with the other comments that it needs some spices to kick it up a bit. I added garlic salt, thyme, and basil, but I think it still needed some more kick to it. Next time I'll add more spices. I served these up using cut up chicken breasts and served them with barbecue sauce.

Awesome and super easy.  Even my picky eater (7 year old) likes it.  Per some other reviewers, I did up the basil to 3/4 tsp and add 3/4 tsp garlic powder.  We love it and it's become one of my regular menu items.

Really good and easy (that was the best part).  Like others I changed it up a bit, I cut up garlic and dipped the chicken into crushed garlic and olive oil mix.  Then I dipped it into the bread crumbs, and baked it for 35 minutes at 375 degrees.

Excellent dish, prepared as others suggested baking at 425 for about 30-45 mins and increased basil. Big hit prepared it with fresh snapped green beans with garlic and angel pasta with marinara!

This was just okay.  The breading did get crunchy, which was good, but it really needed a marinara or spaghetti sauce on top to give it some moisture and flavor.

Really good quick and easy.  I used a package of chicken tenders.  Cooked up very quick.  Tender chicken nice flavor.  Leftovers where great on a salad the next day.

In all fairness the recipe was good.  It was my fault for not pounding thin enough I think because the chicken took longer to cook and did not have a lot of flavor.  I also did not use seasoned bread crumbs, just plain and then added italian seasoning.  The crust was crispy, but thin.  Next time I will use thinner chicken breast halves, italian seasoned bread crumbs and double coat for a thicker crust.

This recipe was quick and easy!  Quicker than expected.  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts because that's all I had on hand.  Cooking time was a little longer due to the size of them but WOW what a dish.  This will be a staple in our household!  My boyfriend, who is always picking apart recipes, didn't have anything to say accept how good it was.

BROVO! My family loved this dish and it was so easy.  Very moist although next time I will opt to bake and use egg white for a healthier version.  Thanks for the recipe!

I follow recipes that are new to me as written as this one came out awful. Nothing stuck to the chicken and the result was a fried piece of bland chicken.

I just made this parmesan chicken last night and both my husband and I loved it. It was so easy to make, and such delicious flavor. I am new in the kitchen, and I was so excited this was a success! I am going to keep using this recipe and also pass it along :)

Very easy recipe to follow and tastes great. I liked that the bread crumbs made the outside slightly cripsy and flaky, but the inside was moist. The Parmesan gave it the cheesy flavor but was not overpowering at all, and the basil was a nice subtle flavor also. Good recipe that all three of us enjoyed. Thanks for the recipe, Mollie!

Great recipe, I used a previous reviewers suggestion and baked the chicken, its healthier and tasted great. I also added the butter melted to the crumb mixture and sprayed the pan and chicken with pam and baked for 35 min, it was great!!!

Awesome Recipe - It turned out just like the restaurant! One bit of advice to anyone who thinks about not flattening the chicken - Ignore that notion. Flatten the chicken because that allows it to cook perfectly. I have made it both ways, and trust me, following the recipe exactly yields a better entree. (surprise, surprise, right?)

Very good. The whole family loved it. I took the advice of others and added butter to the bread crumbs and I also added garlic powder and I baked it in a pan with a drizzle of sauce on the bottom. I sprinkled cheese on top for the last 5 minutes. It was crispy and delish!

Very tasty - followed the advice of baking it in the oven, adding more spices, and adding the melted butter to the breading mixture.  Instead of bread crumbs, I used Panko flakes.

very good, easy, and cheap recipe! Instead of flattening the chicken, cut into smaller pieces. Cooks more evenly, faster and more kid friendly.

Delicious and quick!   I only did one alteration. After I finished browning the chicken, I added extra parmesan on top and threw some marinara sauce in the pan. Then I broiled it for about three minutes (just enough to brown the cheese on top).   It was delicious! I served it over angel hair pasta and the more marinara sauce.   This is definitely the best chicken parm recipe I've found so far - it was just so quick! It took as much time to make as my pasta took to boil. I'd highly recommend it if you're looking for a quick, easy dinner!

I followed the recipe except for leaving out the basil.  I was serving it with spaghetti and didn't feel the need to have basil in both dishes.  I was thrilled to see the end result was tender, moist and a lovely golden brown.  I was even more thrilled when my husband loved it.  This one is a keeper!!

My fiance wanted chicken alfredo, but I was out of the shake and bake he likes with it, so I decide to hit up my all time favorite cooking website.  This chicke worked very well with it.  I didn't use basil, and I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs, so I just threw in some italian seasoning and some garlice powder into the bread crumb/cheese mix.  Turned out great.  Oh, I also used a huge pan, so I would up adding an extra tablespoon of butter and an extra tablespoon of butter.  In a smaller pan it wouldn't have been nessisary.

This was what was for dinner. It was good. I thought it would be even better with a pan gravy. All in all though excellent recipe! It adapts well using (Gluten Free white bread, also from the site). Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it! I used garlic and olive oil instead of egg though and I baked in in the oven at 350 for 35 mins. It came out perfect. I also got a slice of mozzarella and set it on top of the chicken a couple mins before it was done. Then I got marinara sauce and covered it. I served with a bed of angel hair pasta, salad and garlic bread. It was DELICIOUS!!

Yum and so easy.  I used 4 thinly sliced chicken breast, and followed others suggestion and dredged twice through egg and breadcrumbs.  I put a layer of tomato sauce in pan and the chx breasts on top with mozzarella on each.  I baked at 375 for 30 minutes (putting the cheese on in the last few minutes).  Perfect and so easy!

I just recently tried this last week, I made my own breadcrumbs, being that Idid not have any on hand, basically with about 4 pieces of bread toasted and then crumbled, then i placed in a dry skillet to make sure super crumbly. also my chicken breast was so thick so I had to place it in the oven to finish cooking. Because I lik some type of sauce on my meat, I mixed up honey and dijon  mustarde and it turned out really tasty, my husband called it his honey dijon chicken and wants it again tonight. great quick recipe, but it took quite a while to cook.

I've made this recipe for the first time yesterday. It was a hit! Healthy, moist and delicious! The taste was very good and here in France you know that we like cheese so it was perfect. I used garlic and olive oil seasonned bread crumbs. I put in the mixture more parmesan than bread and used frozen basilic instead or dry.  As suggest in other reviews, I dipped in egg and crumbs mixture twice. And I bake it 30 minute in the oven.  I served it with Tagliatelle and a tomato and basilic sauce.

I thought this was just your average parmesan chicken.  Nothing fantastic.

Very tasty.  Changed the spices a bit and cooked in the oven instead of frying (my attempt at cooking a tad bit more healthy).

Chicken was good. not exactly what i expected, though.  It is more of a chicken parmesan and i agree would be great with spaghetti

All in all the recipe was good, however, my chicken turned out a little soggy :{ May be my cooking temp was not high enough but when I raised it for the next chick breast it had this burned look on the outside. I had to cook it for longer because it was still undercooked on the inside.

I made this about a month ago and baked it in the oven.  It was ok that way but didn't get crispy as I like. I just made it again today but pan fried it then put it in the oven on broil with sauce and cheese.  My boyfriend said it was the best he ever had. Thanks so much for this recipe its a keeper.

This was very good. I did season the chicken before flatting it and found I had to add more butter/oil than stated during frying. Hubbie loved it!

after reading a few reviews, i changed it up a bit.  instead of using chicken breasts, i cut up the chicken into chunks for the kids sake. then baked it at 375 for 30 minutes in a foil lined 9x13 pan with the melted butter on the bottom. will definitely make again!

Very simple recipe for people who don't have lots of time to prep dinner. I add extra seasoning to the breadcrumbs since it's a bit bland. At the end of the cooking time, I add the sauce directly into the pan and slices of cheese on top. Put cover over pan for ~1min for everything to melt. Whole family loves it.

I told the advise of some of the other reviewers and put in the oven rather than frying.  My 12 year old son was not keen on the idea of me not adding pasta sauce as he is used to.  However, once it was done, he loved it.  I only got to eat one serving as he also wanted to take for lunch and have the other for dinner the next day.  I should also mention that I only got to eat half of a serving as he had some of mine as well.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe, I cheat and use crutons for the bread crumbs, the seasoned ones work great! Just smash them when your pounding the chicken. its a great way if you need to get some aggression out, or have some fun. My husband loves this chicken and he doesn't even like chicken that much.

Nice subtle parmesan flavor, easy to make and my kids ate it up.  I'll be making this one again.  Made this with a little asparagus and a rice dish.  Fantastic.

This recipe was easy and delicious! The only things I did differently were: I used fresh, shredded parmesan cheese (instead of grated in a can) and I baked mine in the oven, for 45 minutes on 375.  I did NOT flatten the chicken, so if you flatten it, you probably only need to bake it about 30-35 minutes.  I covered it with foil for the second half of cooking time, because the cheese was getting too dark.  My husband and 2 year old son also loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe!!  :)

The chicken was very moist and juicy, but the breading kept falling apart and the bread mixture was very bland. I will try to make it again with thawed chicken and adding more spices. I also didn't use butter, just extra virgin olive oil.

This was good and easy. I just added 1 tsp minced garlic to the eggs before dipping. Sauted till brown then baked at 425 degrees for about 10 minutes. Good and tasty; will have again.

This was very tasty with spaghetti but I guess I didn't flatten my chicken enough because they took longer to reach the right temp and got dark in the skillet.  Next time I will just stick to my oven-bake method.

I love this recipe! I follow it exactly except instead of egg I dip the chicken in milk due to a food allergy in my family. The crumbs probably stick better with egg. This chicken comes out great! My whole family loves it. I serve it with my sauce, some fresh grated parm over pasta.

As suggested by another person, I baked mine instead of frying it and with that change to the recipe this was a huge hit!  My husband loved it, and I was able to easily prepare it while chasing a 7 month old around, highly recommend!

Followed everything except added extra spices to bread mixture (thyme, italian seasoning, salted the chicken, celery salt) including the basil plus melted butter & put it with mixture so it held on good to the chicken breasts & got crispy. YUM!

Had good basic flavor.  In an effort to be a litle healthier, took suggestion to bake, and I don't think it worked as well as pan frying in a little oil would have.  The crust did not "crisp" well...parts of the chicken had the texture of dried out crumbs, so will fry next time.  Nice alternative to plain grilled chicken breast.

I loved this recipe. Everyone I have made it for has loved it. I did make some adjustments though; I do everything as planned, then I broil the chicken with a thick slab of mozzerlla cheese on top, just until the mozza is golden brown. Then I remove it from the oven, dust with real grated parmasian, and serve over a bed of pasta with a nice tomatoe sauce. Just like at a restaurant.

My family loved this chicken!  It was a little bland so I did make some changes to it though.  I did flatten chicken to 1/4 inch thickness (That is important) and used the recipe ingredients except for the veg. oil.  I added a more basil to measure 3/4 tsp. and I added 1/2 tsp more oregeno, increased GRATED permesan cheese to almost 1/2 cup (Use the grated for the correct texture) a little garlic and I baked it at 375 for about 35 minutes instead of pan frying using a little olive oil in the bottom of the baking dish and turning so not to stick to dish. Just a few minutes before done I sprinkled some shredded mozz. cheese on top and served over a nest of pasta. Yummy.

Perfect seasoning!  I marinated the chicken in italian dressing for 90 minutes, then breaded and seared the chicken for a few minutes on each side.  I baked it for 35 minutes at 375, and for the last 5-8 minutes, topped with marinara, mozzarella, and parmesan cheese.  It was the best meal I've had in a while.  We're making it tomorrow night, too!

i loved this recipe. I used a few variations offered in reviews and made my own bread crumbs. i even ate the leftovers at work the next day and it was still moist and great. I always like to add extra cheese so it was really amazing. My boyfriend and his brother loved it too.

This was absolutely delicious! I used grated and shredded parmesan cheese and instead of seasoned bread crumbs i just used regular bread crumbs and seasoned them with pepper, salt, italian seasoning and oregano. Definitely a winner!

Very good, easy recipe. I used my own homemade bread crumbs and added a little garlic salt, basil, parsely, oregano, and salt & pepper to the crumbs & cheese. I used olive oil & butter to fry and the chicken was very tasty and moist. I served with spaghetti & marinara. Yum!

This was a great recipe especially for kids!  I made is with chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts.  It was also easier to use Italian bread crumbs instead of adding all of the spices.  I served it with green beans and rice and it was a huge hit with the kids and adults we had over for dinner.

A delicious and easy to put together recipe. I used 4 minced cloves of garlic in dry mix for a kick. I also poured a half jar of red sauce in 9X13 baking dish and then nestled the grilled chicken on top. I then layered on the rest of the sauce. To top it off I used parmesan and fresh moz. cheese for the final layer. I put in a pre-heated 375 degree oven for about 45 minutes. Tasted Great!

I didn't have breadcrumbs, so I used Saltines, potato chips and Italian seasoning instead. I also filleted the chicken instead of pounding it. They were excellent!

I've never done chicken breast this way before and was amazed to see how succulent it actually was. I usually find chicken breast dry and bland, but this was delicious. 

I melted a small amount of butter and smoothed it over the chicken (after egg and breadcrumbs) and then grilled it. 

Very quick and easy. Next time, I'll probably sliver the breasts in half and put a thin slice of parmesan and some garlic inside.

This a great go to recipe when you don't have time to make dinner.  If you use thin chicken cutlets it cuts the thawing time as well.  Excellent EASY recipe. My husband and kids loved it.

Mine came out a little dry, I think next time I might bake it for less time, maybe 20 minutes. Othewise, it was pretty good. I served with spaghetti sauce to dip chicken in.

I looked up this recipes as parmesan crusted chicken because I wanted to learn how to make one of my favorite meals from a certain steak house. I had to add comment on the wonderful way they make it. They add fresh cold diced tomatoes that are coated with a creamy lemon sauce and I believe basil.  Thought I'd fill you in on another idea instead of just chicken parmesan!

This is a fantastic and very simple recipe to make.  I used oregano because I didn't have basil and it was great.  I sliced the chicken breasts in half horizontally and then pounded them flat between two pieces of plastic wrap.  I don't have a mallet, so I put my sankou knife over the chicken (flat side up) and pounded that with my fist.  Worked great.  The husband and kid were impressed and have requested I make this several times already.

I made this recipe last night and it was the best.  I added dash and garlic powder to the bread crumb mix. I fried it for a bit and put in the oven with motzarella cheese for melting.
I served it with pasta and ceasar's salad. It was a hit and I will make it again.  Thanks for sharing

This has become one of my favorite recipes. I bake instead of browning it on the stove, as someone else suggested, plus I cover the chicken with spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese. Yum!

I made this along with a marinara sauce that was listed on this site and it came out great.  Wife and kids loved it.  I followed the directions but added some dried oregano and parsley to the bread crumb mix.  I also put the chicken in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes until my pasta was ready.  They came out moist and tender.
Thanks

It was delicious and flavorful.  The only thing is that the breading fell apart and off the chicken towards the end of the cooking time.

This is a simple recipe that was worked great for me twice thus far! I prepared it both times with my custom mods: Italian seasoned bread crumbs; baking it on 350 for 15 min in layers: spaghetti, Prego Garlic Parmesan sauce, grated cheddar cheese, the prepared chicken, and then more parmesan cheese on top. Mmmm.

Easy and good.  I added just a little garlic powder to teh bread crumbs and baked the chicken after I browned it in the pan.  I served with " Quick and Easy Alfredo" sauce on top. (also found on this website.)

This recipe is good and easy.  Best of all I had most of the ingrediants in my staple items which is always a bonus.  Changes I made to recipe:  I did not have seasoned bread crumbs just plain so I added salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder to the mix.  I used fresh basil not dried.  I upped the parmesan a little bit (my kids dig it) This was fast easy and good.  This will go into the chicken rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious & so easy!  I've used this recipe countless times, even without adding basil but just regular italian seasoned breadcrumbs, or adding 1 part spicy breadcrumbs to 2 parts italian -- delicious!  I've even used this simple breading after having tried a new chicken cacciatore recipe that turned out dry, and it definitely improved the chicken (surprisingly!)

This was really good!  I had tried on my own to make a really good parmesan chicken recipe but hadn't gotten the proportions just right.  This was what I was trying for!  It was a hit with everyone in the family including a toddler.  I served it with pasta, a salad and the toasted garlic bread recipe from this site.

I reheated the leftovers in the oven and then made a parm chicken sandwich.  Very good leftovers.

Good stuff! I cut the chicken breasts into strips so I didn't have to pound them.  Definitely a keeper!  Oh, and I used dried dill instead of basil.  Yummy!

I made this recipe for my girlfriend and a couple friends and they all enjoyed it a lot. I kept the recipe as it was except that I used shredded parmesean instead of grated and it was great. When it was finished I warmed up Emeril garlic tomato sauce to put on top and sprinkled some more cheese on top and it was delicious.

This is delicious!  Best to brown it on medium heat, or it will brown too quickly if higher.

This was very tasty.  I had the heat too high when I browned the chicken, so it was a bit MORE than brown, but it was STILL good.  I will definitely make this again - and hopefully next time, I'll turn the heat down a bit.  :-)

I saw this recipe and it looked so easy I decided to give it a try. I am so glad that I did.  It is scrumptious. I did not change a thing and the chicken was so moist it was unbelievable. I don't know what in the recipe makes it so moist but it is so much better than any chicken parmesan I have made before. Try this, you will not be disappointed.

THIS IS A VERY EASY DISH TO PREPARE AND WAS EXTREMELY TASTY! I ESPECIALLY LIKE IT B/C THE INGREDIENTS CALLED FOR ARE ALL INGREDIENTS I KEEP ON-HAND, WHICH MAKES IT VERY SIMPLE. I ADDED SOME GARLIC SALT, DRIED ROSEMARY, THYME, (EXTRA) BASIL, OREGANO TO THE BREAD CRUMB MIXTURE. IT GAVE IT GREAT FLAVOR. I BEAT THE CHICKEN UNTIL IT WAS EVENLY FLAT (SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 1/4-1/2 INCH) AND COOKED IT IN THE SKILLET WITH OLIVE OIL (INSTEAD OF VEGETABLE OIL) AND FRESHLY MINCED GARLIC. IT COOKED QUICKLY (5 MIN PER SIDE) AND WAS VERY JUICY. I SERVED WITH A SIDE OF ANGEL HAIR PASTA & MARINARA SAUCE. IT WAS A HUGE HIT. LOVED IT! EVEN MY 1 1/2 YR OLD ENJOYED THE CHICKEN.

This was really good. I actually used chicken thighs, instead of the breasts, and it was really rich and juicy. I also topped it with tomato sauce, and melted parmesan cheese. We really liked it and it was easy to make.

A friend of ours made this for us and it was great!  She baked it instead of frying it like another reviewer suggested.  I will definitely make this at my house too!

I *loved* this! It was fabulous. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and turned out wonderful. It was super simple, quick and easy and it tasted great! Definitely a new staple in our house. :)

This recipe was delicious and easy to make.  I topped the chicken with a red sauce and that worked well too.

This was very tasty. I made it for my husband and I and it turned out great.  I did however deep fry mine oppose to pan frying and that worked out well.  Excellent recipe.

My new favorite!!  Yumm...and super easy to fix.  The husband loved it!  I ended up baking the chicken to make it a little healthier.  It still came out crisp and moist.  Will keep this recipe for sure.

I used chicken tenders rather than breasts and they turned out wonderfully.  This recipe will be added to my rotation!

This was a HUGE hit at my house!!  My husband and 4 kids loved it!  I added just a hint of garlic salt to the breading and fried in extra virgin olive oil! Quick and easy and very delicious!

This is one of our family favorites. The basil and parmesan make the perfect combination. Goes perfectly with "mouthwatering stuffed mushrooms".

Perfect! I used panko bread crumbs and asiago cheese, because that is what I had. Normally I would have been trying to add garlic and other spices. However, being 3 months pregnant, this seasoning was just right! Very simple and simply delicious. And the smell of the browning cheese made my mouth water.

My husband is so bored of chicken, he hates when I make it for dinner.  This recipe is a winner!!  My husband not only ate his, but wanted more!  I will definately be adding this to the regular rotation.

This was a good, easy recipe.  You can't argue about how moist the chicken was, however, I will punch it up a bit next time with seasonings.  It was a bit bland.  Husband loved it, daughter didn't.  Whatchagonnado.  I will make this again !!!
