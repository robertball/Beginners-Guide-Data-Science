By utilizing the suggestions of previous reviewers and adding a couple of my own, this pie turned out beautifully. I'll definitely be making this pie again and again. Here's what I recommend. 1) Taste your strawberries first to determine how sweet they are. This will help you decide how much sugar to use. 2) As suggested by a previous reviewer, discard the excess sugar, flour and cornstarch mixture to prevent your pie from becoming goopy and soupy. 3) Make a brown sugar oatmeal crumble topping for your pie by combining one stick of butter, 1 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup oatmeal, 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and a pinch of salt. The topping will be beautiful and brown.

This pie was very easy and very sweet! I thought the crumble topping might taste better made with brown sugar?! It seemed to harden up a lot and not really "crumble".  I may try brown sugar next time I make it.  Also, a tip if you have extra flour, sugar and cornstarch that does not mix in completely with the strawberries throw it out and do not add it to the pie.  I made that mistake and it all sunk to the bottom of the pie so there was a thick layer of white gooey liquid at the bottom. Other than that it was a quick and delicious pie!

A pie that doesn't turn out is worthy of *no* stars. Not even if the topping was good, which this was.  I should have expected it. A half cup of flour and a tablespoon of cornstarch is waaaaay too much thickener for four cups of ANY kind of fruit and I should have followed my gut and trusted my 50 years of baking experience.  I even used five cups of berries and it still was a pasty, raw floury, unappetizing goo.  (This literally WAS inedible - I'm not exaggerating merely to stress a point) It was a beautiful pie, I'll give it that, because the crust was great (Harden Your Arteries Pie Crust) and the topping was beautiful and delicious. But the disaster is obvious immediately upon cutting into it. Had this recipe called for half the amount of thickener I might have ended up with a decent pie, but the recipe is what it is and, if prepared as is with the error in the ingredients, is simply awful and a failure. (For those of you who are interested, I have posted a personal photo of the cut slice which is worth a thousand words)

This was the best strawberry pie I've ever had! I didn't know if I'd like a baked strawberry pie, as I'd only had the fresh, unbaked kind before but this was fantastic! As soon as I sampled my first slice I was already planning to bake another!!! Incidentally, I prefer it chilled and not eaten warm, as I believe you taste the flavors better.

Since some reviewers commented on the sweetness of the pie, I halved the sugar+flour+cornstarch mixture for the strawberries and slightly drained it on the side before putting the filling in - that helped a lot on the 'runny filling' problem, but it didn't help on the sweetness at all! If you want it less sweet, make sure you cut on the sugar in the crumb topping, because that's what's overly sweet. Also, the pie was white/yellow and rough (I could taste the granular sugar even though I sifted it), so definitely use brown sugar (sifted) for a better texture. Overall, if it weren't for the filling, this would've tasted like chunks of white sugar.

Absolutely delicious!  I cut down on the sugar just a bit after reading reviews.  I was unsure as to what to do with the leftover cornstarch/flour mixture once the berries were coated, so I tossed it out and I think that was the right thing to do (rather than putting it in the pie).  I'll make this pie often!  It's the BEST!

This is a great recipe. I go pick fresh strawberries at the local u-pick berry farm and then use them to make this pie.  I made one and brought it to work and my co-workers loved it! Helpful hint: After you make it, let it sit overnight in the fridge and let everything meld together and get very cold.  Tastes great the next day!

This pie looked very nice and bubly coming out of the oven.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and did not mound the strawberries so much, I'm glad I spread the berries out a bit.  It took a turn for the worst when being served, it did not look too great on the plate, even if I let it cool down considerably.  Nevertheless, it tasted great!  We had the pie warm with ice cream on the side, what a treat!  I will make this again and add more nutmeg to the topping next time.

A baker I am not and this pie turned out great.  I  read through the reviews and made a few changes.
1.  I used brown sugar  on the crumble
2. I used a deep dish pie crust so I added one more cup of strawberries
3. Because I used more strawberries I did not have the issue with extra flour mixture
4 I used slightly less sugar  because my strawberry were fresh

I also tried this exact recipe with fresh peaches.  I just  added 2 tsp of ciniamon to the  flour mixture and i did the  oatmeal crumbel that someone else suggested

This is a great recipe, but depends on many variables.  First, you gotta have a good pastry recipe.  Second, you gotta have good berries!  If they're tiny and sweet, then halve the thickener.  I thought my results were heavenly!

This pie has now become a tradition in my household. When I make it, I not just make one, I make 2 or 3 because everyone loves it so much that I share. Another poster mentioned not piling the strawberries up so high, but I've found, after making this so many times, that that partnered with the topping, is what holds the pie together when slicing. It's still usually a sloppy sort of pie, but the piling most definitely helps. Thanks so much, Scatterflake, for posting. I consider this a very valuable recipe and have now made it one of my own.

I loved this version of Strawberry Pie much more than the sugary version with the jello and the whole strawberries.  It was absolutely delicious and exactly what I was looking for.  thanks for the recipe!

I was very pleased with this recipe. This pie turned out wonderfully. I used brown sugar instead of white for the topping and margarine instead of butter. Some reviewers said to throw out the remaining thickening mixture, but I found that when you cut the strawberries into quarters or halves (depending on the size of the strawberry) it helps to absorb the flour/sugar/cornstarch coating better. I also used about 6 or 7 cups of strawberries instead of 4 and the pie filled out nicely.

This was more like a cobbler than a pie.  Just messy looking, too goopy with flour, way too sweet and could not even be sliced like pie. Very disappointed in this recipe, but I guess you could  serve it like cobbler with ice cream if necessary.

My kids and I made this recipe with wonderful, fresh strawberried bought straight from the field.  I am giving it two stars because the strawberries themselves tasted good, along with the crust, but using this recipe turned them into a gloppy, flour tasting mess.  What a dissapointment

I feel like I wasted my beautiful fresh strawberries in this pie. My daughter and husband wouldn't even take a second bite...and they both love strawberries.  Based on previous suggestions, after lightly coating the berries, I discarded the additional sugar/cornstarch/flour mixture.  Even in doing that, the pie turned out gooey (and not in a good way) and tasting like flour.  There was hardly any berry taste considering how much bland flour taste was present.  I pre-tasted my berries, which were very sweet and full of fresh strawberry flavor. The only other flavor that came through was the crunchy granulated white sugar.  Nothing blended well.  It did, however, look exactly like the picture. Very nice presentation, but not taste.

Yum! As someone who's not a huge strawberry pie fan, I couldn't get enough of this warm with ice cream! MMM! I used "Cooking Cuties" suggestion and changed the topping from white sugar to a brown sugar/oatmeal/cinnamon crisp. Absolutely 100% perfect, even w/ a store-bought pie crust.  Used freshly picked strawberries. MMMMMMMMM!

I've made this a few times now, and it's always been one of my favorite Allrecipes selections. Thanks to Cooking Cutie for making it even better. I followed her directions for the topping, and it was extra special. Just a note: The first time I made this pie, I didn't read the directions and added the flour/sugar/corn starch to the pie shell. It still came out delicious.

Scrumptious.  Yes, it's sweet, but good grief, it's a strawberry pie! I made it more like a big tart (flatter, in other words) so the heaping issue didn't really come up, so to speak. I've used it with different fruits (peaches and plums) and it was just as great.  This has become my new fallback pie strategy.  Well done, Old Boy!

SO GOOD!!! Awesome especially with whipped cream and/or ice cream. Only thing I didn't like was that the topping didn't completely cover the top of the pie, so you could see part of the pie underneath.

This was great!!  I used enough of the cornstarch/flour/sugar mixture to coat the berries really well, but did not pour it all in the crust.  It was so good, so pretty, and delicious chilled.  It cut into perfect slices that held together on the plate.  Will DEFINITELY be making again!

This is an all time favorite with my friends at summer gatherings.  I am obliged to make it everytime.  We refer to it as Strawberry Crack pie due to it's addictive nature.  One awsome tip is to put it under the broiler for one minute after baking to give the topping an extra crispy consistency. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

My husband used to bring me a raspberry pie that was made by a local caterer and sold in the store where he works. It was very similar to this strawberry pie. The raspberry was always a special treat, so I was very excited to find this recipe. The consistency and flavors blended fabulously. I used some frozen strawberries (thawed and patted dry) that I had picked earlier in the month. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar for the crumb topping and I didn't sprinkle any extra sugar on top. It turned out perfectly. I shared it with family and co-workers. They all loved it. I will definitely make this again.

wow.  this makes an excellent pie.  i added a pinch of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of oatmeal to the topping.  other than this, i followed the recipe exactly.  the strawberries had just a hint of tart to them, the topping balanced it well.  the way the berries cooked made an awesome filling.  i will be making this again for guests at our cookout this weekend.  yum!

I didn't feel like going to the trouble of making the crumb topping so I just used a deep dish pet ritz on the top sprinkled with sugar.  I put small chunks of butter on inside and out...wonderful!!!

There was way too much flour and sugar in the filling, and the crumb topping ended up as if it had never been baked, dry and flavorless.  The filling tasted raw and floury.  I've baked many a pie in my day, but none ever turned out quite this disappointing.

This is the only pie I've ever made that was a disaster! The berries I used were fresh and firm, but their liquid turned the filling and crumb topping to a pasty mush.

Don't you hate it when people change the recipe & then rate it poorly?  No worries on this review...made this today for Father's Day, didn't change a thing...BEST STRAWBERRY PIE EVER!  No spillovers, perfect sweetness...just all-round yummy. Rave reviews from everyone...my new go-to pie recipe...would work great with many fruits.  Thank you so much for a simple, delicious recipe!

I have made this pie for family gatherings for over 7 years now, and it is always a big hit. I have always followed the recipe exactly and it always turns out great without any of the issues i have read in the other reviews. The only thing I have changed a couple of times is the sugar when the strawberries are already really sweet but living in Minnesota that  doesn't happen often.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I would rate this a 5 but as others suggested, do not mix to much of the flour, cornstarch ect with berries for they do tend to get suggy after baking. I did add a little more berries and sugar (brown) since my berries were slightly bitter.

Absolutely awesome pie.  I love pie and I love strawberries but did not like the gelatin filling with most.  I made this pie yesterday and it is wonderful.  I did substitute brown sugar in the crumble  topping.  Worked great.  Thanks to The Old Boy.

I made this recipe in a 9x13, substituting the sugar for Splenda and adding blueberries for a potluck luncheon. The fact that there was nothing left to take home, when there were three chocolate desserts competing for attention, tells me it was a hit! I will make this again on a smaller scale for the family.

This pie is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as it's written, as I always do the first time I make a new recipe. This pie was so good that our 10 year old daughter told a friend who called while we were eating it, "You need to come over here and try this awesome pie my dad just made". It's very unusally, but very good. I've never had a baked strawberry pie before, but we WILL have it again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

We really enjoyed this. I'd describe it as a strawberry crumble pie.   I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and was very happy with the results. First, I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar for the topping.  2.  I discarded all excess sugar, flour, and cornstarch after coating strawberries.  3. I used a pinch of cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  We enjoyed it warm with a dallop of whipped cream for the first slice but I definately preferred it chilled the next day.  Thanks for a great recipe we'll make again and again!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I chopped the strawberries up (recipe gave me the impression that they remained whole) and followed recipe as is. Tart and sweet at the same time - perfection! Will definitely be making this again!!

My husband and son both thought this was one of the best desserts I have ever made.  A homemade crust is a must.  If you don't like strawberry jam, you won't like this. I used a bag of frozen strawberries--let them thaw, drained them and they were ready to use in the recipe.

100% delicious. used a crumble topping. tastes GREAT, easy to make, impatient me wanted to eat the pie right when i took it out of the oven -- BAD move, it's not done cooking yet, let it finish cooking after it's out of the oven unless you like watery insides and crunchy apples.

This pie was wonderful. I used a deep dish pie crust, so I added another cup of strawberries. Other than that, I made it as is. I wouldn't change a thing. It got rave reviews, and was SO SO good. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is a delicious pie and tastes great, but the topping turns out yellow when baked.  To give it a more pleasing appearance, the sugar you sprinkle on top at the very of baking can first be whisked with a drop of red food coloring, making it pink which makes the pie look better.  Thanks for a super recipe!

This recipe was great! I used fresh picked berries and followed another reviewers tip of not using all the flour/sugar mix in the pie.(just rolled the berries around in mix and tossed them in pie plate)  It turned out perfect.  I did add oatmeal to the crumb topping which was a nice addition. Actually making two more pies as I type this....we picked a lot of strawberries! Enjoy!

Just baked two of these, and while the topping is phenomenal, the filling isn't so much. 

So you all know, there will be left over mixture that you coat the strawberries with. I recommend decreasing the amount of flour in it by 1/3 or 1/2 of a half cup. So do a little less than half a cup, or only add 1/4 of a cup of flour into the mixture.

This was a perfect alternative for a baked strawberry pie when I could not find any rhubarb at the store.

I made some alterations - 
- I used brown sugar instead of white for the topping.  I used the same amount but next time will probably use slightly less.  
- I also felt like my strawberries were sweet enough to only use 1/2 cup of white sugar when coating them (along with the same amount of flour and corn starch).  
- Similar to another reviewer, I discarded the excess flour-mix after the strawberries were coated.  
- Between the butter in the topping and the extra bits added at the end, I used a whole stick.  
- I did a little final quick sprinkle of sugar on top near the end of the bake time.  Probably not necessary but didn't hurt either.  

The pie was delicious warm with vanilla ice cream and equally tasty when eaten cold the next day.  This recipe is a keeper.

I was so excited to try this with fresh picked strawberries.  We were disappointed.   Way too sweet and clumpy (if there is such a word) for my family.

I made this pie exactly as it's written and it's incredible!  The topping is amazing and I think it would be sad not to try it as written before changing it to a crumble.  It's so good.  Make sure to use very ripe strawberries to create the best flavor.  Just made another for a friend just because i love making it.  Yum!

I have made multiple strawberry pie recipes from this site and this one is by far my favorite.  This is going to by my strawberry pie recipe from now on.  I made it exactly as written and it was wonderful.  Wish I would have found this recipe earlier.

I love the flavor of this pie, but it needs some changes to work.  I needed to use between 6-7 cups of berries fresh from the garden to fill the crust and I didn't have an issue with sinking berries.  I used an oatmeal crumb topping as suggested by another reviewer.  I didn't have a "flour" flavor in the filling as I made sure to mix the berries evenly in the flour mixture.  Next time I will use additional corn starch and less flour to help the pie set up better.  I would have rated this a 4 1/2 if I could.

I followed the advice of several reviewers and made the necessary modifications - the pie came out non-gooey (thanks to dumping the extra cornstarch mixture), brown and crisp on top (thanks to part of the sugar being brown and part of the flour being oatmeal) and the topping not over browned (thanks to the foil for the last 15 min of baking).  All that worked, BUT.........I just didn't like the taste!  Warm strawberry pie just didn't do it for me (I prefer the Fresh Strawberry Pie I) but my daughter and father really enjoyed this pie.  To each their own!  I won't eat another warm strawberry pie...but I'd recommend this reciepe to those who will.

Awesome! However, I couldn't resist making a few minor changes; I used only white whole wheat flour and also used Splenda instead of sugar with the strawberries. I used brown sugar instead of white in the crumb topping and added cinnamon to it.

This was SO good. My husband was a little leery at first, but he LOVED it! By reading other reviews I thought about trying the oatmeal crumble topping as suggested by other reviews BUT I stuck with the original (except used half white sugar and half brown sugar) and I am so glad I did! The topping was the best part and complimented the pie well! Will be making this again and will try using different berries or adding rhubarb next time!

I used a Pillsbury pie crust and it was mushy.  Also, I needed 1 cp more berries than called for.  The strawberries were at their peak of flavor, but the pie turned out to be only so-so. I followed the recipe exactly and it seems the higher ratings came from people who changed it.

I made this pie for my anniversary dinner with my husband and it was delectable!  I did use 1/2 C of brown sugar in the topping as per other suggestions.  I wasn't sure if I should serve it hot or cold, so I chose cold with vanilla ice cream.  Yummy!

this pie is fantastic! try using brown sugar when it calls for white sugar, or try Splenda for baking. Decrease flour/sugar/cornstarch mix for coating berries to 1/4c./1/4c./no cornstarch.

The crumb topping was very tasty. The filling did not come out that great. This was my first time making strawberry pie, so I wasn't sure how to adjust it but the filling just tasted a little bit too "floury" to us.

Has a really good taste. Took others' advice and used the brown sugar/oatmeal topping..very worth it!  And threw away the extra cornstarch mixture, and it wasn't soupy at all.  It doesn't cut well at all. More like a very good strawberry cobbler. But tastey, and not too sweet.

This baked strawberry pie is so much better than any cold version!  I used "cooking cutie's" review suggestion and made the brown sugar oatmeal crumble topping and this pie tasted phenomenal!  This pie is so easy to make but tastes and looks complex, impressing all who try a slice.

This was really good. Different and good!  My berries were REALLY sweet so I cut the sugar by half.  I added the oatmeal/brown sugar topping that another poster created.  This was a very good pie.
THANKS Old Boy's Family!

I have made this recipe several times and now that we have fresh Oregon strawberries, I am making it again.  I have made it exactly to the recipe each time and it comes out perfectly, so I am not sure what the other comments are about.  My only problem is that I cannot stop eating this pie.  It is so tasty.

Yum Yum Yum!  I love this pie!  It's easy and wonderful with ice cream!  I did discard the excess flour/sugar mixture after tossing the halved strawberries.  I think next time I"ll use less flour and make sure the sugar stays with the strawberries, my pie was a little tart.  My hubby, who doesn't care for pies and was convinced he wouldn't like it, went back for seconds!  Thanks for the post!

I haven't been a big fan of strawberries, but this recipe changed my mind...or should I say tastebuds.  It is WONDERFUL and the crumb topping is a great compliment.  I've made this twice (getting ready to make it a third time) and the only thing I may consider is adding more strawberries.  After the pie is done, there seems to be alot of crumb topping as compared to strawberries.  I serve it warm, with ice cream...YUM!

Delicious! Only used the ingredients called for and didn't exactly measure. No need for ice cream or whipped cream. Used a crust made with shortening.

Nothing is ever to sweet for me so I made this exact to recipe .  The cornstarch and flour on the strawberries could be tasted it was very grainy and the topping had to much sugar not because of taste but the crunch factor.

This was tasty, but I think that was mainly because it was strawberries with sugar, butter and flour... You can't really go wrong with that! However, although it was tasty this was possibly one of the least visually appealing recipes I have EVER made. I think that people avoided it due to its foul appearance- the strawberries and the flour and sugar combined to make sort of a pinkish liquid in the pie that looked really unattractive. It tasted good, but it was not pretty at all. Three instead of four stars due to appearance.

This is fabulous! Not to sweet, and the crumb topping adds so much extra flavour! I couldn't wait for it to cool so I ate it warm as a cobbler and it was fantastic. Definitely on my make again list!

This pie is always a hit! My husband even requested it for his birthday. I like to use more strawberries. I also recommend mixing the topping in a KitchenAid which makes it more consistant. Enjoy!

A really yummy pie, but I was confused about the instructions on coating the berries in the sugar, flour, cornstarch mixture.  I didn't know if the mixture was supposed to be added into the pie along with the berries...so, I didn't include it.  Other than the recipe directions, the pie was really great.

The pie was very good, but 1 1/2 cups of strawberries that the recipe calls for must have been a typo.  The pie needs at least 3 - 4 cups of strawberries.  The crumb topping give the pie a nice texture throughout.

I made this pie for the in-laws to rave reviews. In the future, I would recommend using 3 to 4 cups of strawberries, far more than the 1 1/2 cups called for in the recipe. The 3 to 4 cups of berries I used made a nice-sized pie. Also, the pie was very sweet; when I make this pie again, I will probably cut back on the amount of sugar called for in the first part of the recipe. Great pie!!!

Found this just in time to save my strawberries from the freezer. My kids loved it and so did my husband, he asked did you do something wrong or did I do something right when I fixed it just out of the blue one day.

I used some previous suggestions and majority of the recipe as is, pie came out perfectly and not too sweet, with the perfect texture. I only lightly coated the strawberries with the cornstarch, flour, butter mixture and halved the amounts of each used. Once coated lightly, I discarded the rest and didn't overfill the pie crust. I also made the topping with brown sugar instead of white sugar, covering the pie but not mounding it in the middle so it would cook evenly across the top. Great taste and will make again!

Delicious recipe! I used the equivalent amount of strawberries and blueberries. I would recommend taking the foil off the crust 1/2 way through - the crust edge broke apart because it wasn't crisped up and I ended up with a berry crumble/crisp instead of a pie piece.

This was an awesome recipe! This was my first strawberry pie. I used a simple crust recipe and I followed other peoples advice on the reviews, the brown sugar sifted on the topping makes it so good! I got rid of the excess sugar that collected at the bottom of the bowl and it had just the right sweetness. I'll be making one for my mom and grandma!

I used all of CookingCutie's suggestions with the crumble. I also avoided the excess flour mixture. The consistency was perfection. I enjoyed not having to deal with a top crust and still getting a pretty pie. :)

This turned out excellent and is the easiest pie filling to make! I didn't have any corn starch, so I just used all-purpose flour instead and it still turned out fine. Thanks for the recipe!

This pie was amazing and so easy to put together. The crunch of the crumble on top was a nice contrast to the strawberries. I may have to make this a spring tradition.

This was a BIG hit at my Memorial Day BBQ! Everyone LOVED IT! My only minor complaint is with the directions as written. First when making the topping and you are mixing the flour/sugar mixture with the butter, it does NOT get fluffy. Mix with a fork or pasty cutter or even a mixer to a crumble. Second, after coating the strawberries in the flour/sugar/cornstartch mixture, coat well, then disgard the extra flour mixute. Do not put it all in the pie shell, it is too much thickener. Aside from that, it was easy and tasted great. Thanks for a keeper!

This turned out really good.I followed the suggestions from another reviewer and cut back on the sugar in the berries.They were sweet to begin with.I also used her topping made with brown sugar, oatmeal, butter, flour and cinnamon. I thickened my strawberries with quick tapioca instead of flour just because thats the way I've always thickened my fruit pies. I will bake this pie agan.

Delicious.  Followed many other reviews and did the following:  Replaced white sugar with brown for the topping.  Did NOT use all the thickening mixture--maybe only half.  Used a little less white sugar (for filling) than recommended--I like a tarter pie.  Just delicious!

I was skeptical of this recipe, especially after I put the topping on, because it looked like way too much, but it baked up beautifully! I used 2 pounds of strawberries, which I cut into hunks. I used only 4 Tbs. butter in the topping, which I cut into the flour/sugar with a pastry blender, and I used the other 2 Tbs. butter to dot on top. Be sure to place a pan underneath the pie pan, because it will definitely spill over. Great recipe!! Even more delicious served warm with vanilla ice cream.

Good pie I made this for mothers day.  I made several modifications.  1 used frozen deep dish pie crust, 2 used 7 cups of strawberries with the tops cut off and cut in half, 3 once coated with the mixture I dumped the remaining mix in the trash as recommended in several other reviews, 4 I made an oat topping, not oatmeal but Quaker oats using butter, brown sugar, etc.  Everyone loved it both cold and warmed with ice cream.  The only reason that I give this recipe 4 stars is because after all the changes it is not the same recipe.

Yummm... I had extra strawberries and wanted to use them up, and this was easy and perfect.  I made it without the bottom crust to save calories, but with just the fruit and topping it was incredible - I can't imagine how much better it would be with a bottom crust too!  Definitely will make again and again.

Great pie! Made this for a party and everyone loved it! My strawberries were really big, and I ended up using 6 cups instead of 4 to really fill the pie dish up. It was perfect!

This was the first pie (and crust!) that I have ever made and baked, and I found it to be quite impressive!  Since I did not have fresh strawberries, I used frozen ones.  I don't think there was too much of a drawback in doing so, except that it probably tastes less sweet than fresh strawberries.  Anyhow, the filling had a yummy, sticky consistency to it, and wasn't too sweet like others have said so.  However, I did omit the extra coating mix.  I also did not find it necessary to mound the berries in the middle, nor wrap the edges of the pie crust with foil to prevent burning.

5 Stars with the modifications I took from various reviews, including:  discarding excess cornstarch mixture to prevent a "gluey" pie, using an oatmeal/brown sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg/flour/butter topping, and eliminating the addition of extra sugar during the last  10 min of baking.  I also found that I needed to cover the entire pie, not just the crust, with foil during the last 15 min of baking to prevent the crumb topping from getting too dark.  It was DELICIOUS.  I used "Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust" from this site -- that one's a staple.... and this is too!

This pie was a big hit with my husband and a buddy of his that was here while I baked it. I followed the directions as written and the only thing I did was throw away the excess flour, sugar mixture after coating the strawberries. They thought it was great, served it with whipped cream.

This was a yummy pie, I thought the crumb topping was perfect and I made it exactly as written. Reading reviews I knew to not add the excess flour/sugar/starch mix: I let my berries sit for 10 or so minutes before I put them in and the extra coating they took thickened the pie up more than it should have, so I imagine adding everything would cause lots of problems. Next time I'll just add more berries to the coating and really fill the bottom crust. I had no problem with the pie being too sweet. Brown sugar may be good in here too but this is a delicious pie made as-is without all the flour mix: Thanks so very much for sharing, this was a hit at Thanksgiving :)

My hubby and I loved this pie.  I thought it was a little too sweet, but he thought it was perfect.  Next time I will try to make it less sweet.  I didn't cook it the full time, but I should have.  I was scared to burn the topping.  I will be making this again!  Yum Yum

This pie is simply wonderful...almost worth letting strawberries get a little sad on purpose just to have an excuse to make it!    My only suggestion is using slightly less strawberries than the recipe calls for by up to half...I preferred the consistency better and it took less time to bake.

This is very good.  I added the zest of a lemon to the berry filling.  Next time I will add more than four cups of strawberries for a fuller pie.  I used the topping ingredients, but put them in the food processor instead of blending them so they would be more crumbly.  Both times I've served it, people were surprised to see a baked strawberry pie - but they loved it!  Fresh whipped cream puts it over the top.

FABULOUS! This pie was so good it was gone the moment it cooled enough to eat. I only changed one part of the recipe...the topping. I took the suggestion from another user and did a basic crumble for the top (butter, oats, flour, brown sugar). This made the desert a pie/crisp that everyone loved! I did use all the leftover cornstarch, turned out good with little "goo", next time I probably will not add that. A must try and so easy!

If I could I would give this pie ten stars.  I have never baked strawberry pies before.  The topping made the difference.  I added sugar sprinkles to it just before baking was complete.    From now on I will use this kind of topping on all of my fruit pies.   At this moment I have a nectarine pie in the oven.  It is looking like a master piece.

Just what I was looking for...a fresh strawberry pie, without the gelatin.  This pie is very good, definitely worth making a homemade pie crust. I did substitute brown sugar for the white sugar in the topping. Just as good the second day, with some fresh whipped cream, you'll be glad you made this pie.

I used this recipe as base to build on.  I made two pie crusts.  Then I put the sugar, cornstarch, and flour in a bowl.  I found it easier to roll the strawberries a few at a time in the mixture (stir mixture well). Then I placed them in the first pie crust.  I then basket wove the second pie crust for the top. Next I lightly squeezed a lemon over the pie.  I melted butter, mixed butter with nutmeg and cinnamon; which I brushed on the basket weave.  This turned out amazing.    Today I am making it again, to my husband's request.  Only this time I don't have a lemon , so I sprinkled 3 tbps hard apple cider over the filling before doing the basket weave. It's in the oven, I think it will be great!

great recipe.  It did need some tweeking as others suggested I reduced the sugar and replaced half of the sugar on top with brown sugar.  Other than that it was fabulous.  best eaten at room temperature..tried it cold from the fridge the next day but the crust and topping wasn't as crisp.  Ideally done about 5 hours before serving.  Fabulous!

Fabulous, but I did make some changes.  I made a cream cheese crust, and then used the oatmeal streusel topping as suggested by another reviewer.  For the strawberries, I added juice from a lemon and lemon zest, and then once I put the filling in, I decided more was needed so I added a cup of blueberries just over the top before I added the streusal - baked as directed and the result was an absolute winner!!

Amazing!! One of my favorite pies ever! I've made 6 this week for friends. The thing I like to do differently is cook the strawberries and filling in a pan with a little orange juice. I have an easier time with making it the perfect consistency that way.  Love it! Thank you for sharing it!!

I had never made a "real pie" from scratch before, but I found a whole case of strawberries for $10 the other day, so I made one for us and one for our neighbors...THIS PIE WAS AWESOME, and so SIMPLE to make! I'll be making lots more, and am going to make with different kinds of berries....GREAT PIE!!!

It looks beautiful, smells wonderful and the taste is exceptional! The only changes I made were to add a pinch of cinnamon along with the nutmeg. Perfection in a pie!!!

The pie was excellent.  I added more strawberries to the pie and it became more robust with fruit flavor.

Taste was superb even with modifications: whole wheat flour, sugar substitute instead of sugar and quart of sliced strawberries and a pint of blueberries, as didn't have enough strawberries. The pie wasn't too sweet or sour, not soupy - just great consistancy and tasty - from someone who rarely makes pies. My tween asked for this each night for dessert!

Well,I haven't actually tried it yet,I'll be lucky if I get to,I made it for my dad today and my mom said,'It's good but sure is 'SWEET'! I can't say I blame her for the amount of sugar there is in the directions but  there is only a little bit of slice of this 'old boy's pie' for me so you get the idea on this?

This pie turned out decent the flavor was great I followed the other suggestions tasted my strawberry's to test for sweetness through out the left over mixture the oatmeal crumb topping that another reviewer suggested was awesome my only problem with this cake was the next day it had a terrible color and the flavor was not the same my suggestion would be to eat it the same day I would not make it again unless it was for a large group

MMMM!!!  Even the boyfriend said "This is Good Pie!"  I followed all directions- reading reviews to not put in excess sugar/flour/cornstarch.  I didn't have much of it anyways.  I also didn't use all the crumb topping.  I usually like a 2 crust pie,  but this was good!

This is AMAZING! My mom doesn't like strawberry pie, but when she heard that it was a BAKED pie, she flipped! It's a family favorite now and my husband requests it often! It's relatively easy to make and tastes SO GOOD!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it turned out perfect! I followed what other users said and used less flour and brown sugar instead of white. It was absoulutely delicious. And it looked good too!

This pie was absolutely delicious. It is everything a strawberry pie ought to be. I cut the strawberries in half before mixing them with the coating. I found that this allowed the coating to easily absorb and mix with the strawberry juices, likely removing some of the problems found in some reviews where the coating became an unsavory aspect.

Other than a slight change in strawberry prep, I made this pie as is and it is superb. I will definitely be making this again, possibly even for the annual pie baking contest in my building next month :-)

This was really good and everyone loved it.  A couple of changes to the recipe...I cut sugar to 2/3 cup and skipped cornstarch in pie filling.  I used brown sugar for crumble topping.  And, I did not sprinkle with sugar at the end.  Like others, I left the extra flour mixture in the bowl and did not put it in the pie.  My strawberries also did not sink much so I pushed them down about half way through.  It actually made it a little juicier.  Really good pie, not 5 stars though.  Next time I will use much less flour for the filling.

Nice easy recipe.  I was low on sugar so I only made two thirds of the buttery crumble topping and that was plenty.  It tastes better after it's refrigerated for a day.  It would probably be good to try with other berries added, or rhubarb would be an excellent addition.

This was pretty good, but I guess I am not a big fan of cooked strawberries.  I think this would be great if peaches were substituted.  I probably won't cook it again with the strawberries, but probally with with another fruit.

It was ok, nothing more. It wasn't as runny as I thought it'd be after reading the reviews though. You just have to let it set for a while. I think the strawberries would have been better eaten by themselves.

This was my first attempt at making pie and it turned out so good!  My guests even asked to take some home.  I agree with the other reviewers who said that it's not the prettiest pie.  I may cover it with cool whip the next time I make it.

A very nice non-cream pie.  I didn't have quite enough strawberries-if anything, I would add more. Very enjoyable recipe I will keep as I love strawberries and cream pies don't agree with me.

Super delicious! I added a bit of lemon juice for extra fresh flavor, and used a bit less butter, and added some blueberries, just because. It was a big hit with my family and we'll be making it again.

Delicious! Probably my favorite pie recipe. Definitely the best strawberry pie I've had. So simple, but so delicious. Great filling and I love the crumb topping. I usually add extra strawberries.

I baked as instructed and even sprinkled a little sugar on in the last few minutes of baking. It came out looking beautiful!When we cut it open, it wasn't a gloopy mess or anything. It was actually nice. But we didn't really like the filling. Without cutting, smashing or filling in the area between the berries with something (be it cream cheese, strawberry flavoured gelatin, whatever) it was kind of like baked berries on a crust absurdly covered in sugar.

Made it just as it says except substituted brown sugar because I was out of white. It was scrumptious!!! Don't throw away the extra coating mixture just dump it in. It needs the cornstarch and flour to thicken it.  I will be making this again!!!

MAKES A GREAT APPLE PIE!
We have been making this strawberry pie for years and love it.   This fall I decided to make an apple pie based on this recipe.  In my husband's words "this is the best apple pie I have ever eaten!"  Changes:  added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the crumb mixture, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the 3/4 cups of flour and sugar.  In lieu of 1/2 cup of white sugar, I used 1/4 cup of white and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Spread the apples evenly in the pie crust.

I shouldn’t say I made this exact recipe, but it helped! I made the filling from this recipe and put it in a double crust rather than using the crumb topping. Turned out delicious!

I have made this twice!  The first time it was very weepy, but it was completely my fault for not adjusting for frozen strawberries.  The second time I made the adjustment by doubling the flour in the filling and a tiny bit more sugar and it was just as good, but thicker.  This is THE best strawberry pie I have tried...good old fashioned, country strawberry pie!  A true blue winner in our book!  Thanks, SCATTERFLAKE!

Great recipe for berries, I followed it almost exactly as written.  I chose to use  one of the suggestions for the topping --  3/4 c oatmeal, 1 c brn sugar,  1/2 tsp cinnamon, pinch of salt, and 1/2 c soft butter mixed 'til crumbly -- makes a wonderful sweet brown crunchy top!  I am a beginner pie baker and this one is as the old saying goes "....easy as pie."

Used freshly picked strawberries, used NON dairy butter to make this an dairy-free dessert.  It seems like too much flour/sugar/nutmeg mixture on the strawberries but do NOT throw the extra powder out! It makes the pie just the perfect consistancy. 
To any review that says differently probably didnt bake the pie long enough. Brought one to a party, everyone loved it! Next time I plan to make more of the crumble toppings, that's my favorite part.

Will NEVER make this again. It was WAY too sweet and the filling was extremely runny.  Had I read a few of the reviews I would have substituted tapioca for all of the flour and sugar. I also did not care for the crumb topping. Again, way too sweet and would've been better with a crumb topping with butter cut in.

The first go around I followed the recipe to the letter and was much too sweet for my family. But I knew there were great things about it so the second time I cut the sugar by half, and it was incredibly delicious. Sweet and a just little tart from the strawberries.

My tips: 
Reduce sugar by up to half.
(2) 16oz packages of strawberries was perfect.
Add a tsp of salt to the crumble mixture. Btw, this can be mixed with your bare hands.
I recommend lowering the oven rack a little from the center, so the mounded top won't burn.

My family loved it.  It tasted like biscuits with strawberry jam.  I read another review and dumped the excess flour mixture off the strawberries.  I'd do that again.

Best strawberry pie I've ever had. We picked fresh strawberries at a farm and I'm sure that made all the difference. Everyone raved about it!

Gummy taste, with way too much flour.  This ended up in the trash because it was almost inedible.  What a waste of good strawberries!

I used a sifter to dust the strawberries with and I think that helped not to have the over floury taste on the strawberries some other reviewers had. I actually used very little of what the recipe called for and the pie still came out good, but it was pretty liquidy on the bottom, so maybe I should have used more, but it still tasted really good.  Its kinda more of a cobbler  consistency than a pie, but tasted great.

I've actually been coming to this site for this recipe for years. I had never heard of strawberry pie and looked up a recipe for one on a whim after having loads of strawberries going picking and I'm glad I did because this is now my favorite kind of fruit pie! I finally decided to review after seeing that some people rated it low. They must have done something wrong because this is so easy and it comes out lovely every time I make it and everyone raves over it. I also cut down the sugar a bit because when those strawberries get to baking they're already getting nice and sweet. The crumb topping may look crazy when you dump it on but as the juices bubble up out of the berries during baking it becomes beautiful.

I feel like it might be a bit difficult to top the strawberries and put the crumble topping on this pie evenly; with that said, it bakes really well and tastes good overall. Thank you for the recipe :)

I have made this pie several times over the years.  I make it exactly like the recipe and it turns out fabulous everytime!  This is my favorite strawberry pie recipe.  I also add raspberries and blueberries sometimes.  I think the sweetness is necessary to balance out the tartness of the fruit.  I read where some think it is too sweet.  It has never turned out too sweet for me!

This was very good. I have never had a strawberry pie that was cooked before but I have to say that I think I prefer the cooked kind to the no bake variety.  The nutmeg in the topping was great but The streusel was a bit too floury tasting.  WARNING!  Put a cookie sheet under the pie plate otherwise you'll end up scraping burnt strawberries off the bottom of your oven.

Turned out fantastic.  I read a few reviews so I illuminated corn starch and sugar.  It was NOT gloppy.  I would definitely make it again.

I added one more cup of  strawberries and added an additional 1/4 cup of sugar to the strawberry/sugar/flour/corn starch mixture.  The strawberries I used were freshly picked and very tasty.  Delicious.  I was asked for the recipe.

I had been looking at this recipe for some time wondering if it would work with frozen strawberries from last summer's abundant crop and finally gave it a whirl. I also decided to make the original with no exceptions other than the frozen berries. It was a huge success! Rather than discard the leftover sugar-flour coating I added it to the crumb topping mixture and then gave everything a whirl in the food processor which made the topping very fine. I then spread on top allowing it to filter down into the berries. After the hour baking time it did not look done enough in the center, most likely due to the frozen berries, so I ended up adding an additional 15-20 minutes baking time. The pie was still warm when sliced and there was absolutely no runny, gooey mess--just an absolutely delicious pie that would go well with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was an appropriate ending to Pi (e) Day!

With using the changes I read from other people this turned out perfect! 
I halfed the recipe (only me and my husband.. and he specifically asked for strawberry pie for thanksgiving haha) and I put my filling inside 6 little mini pie crusts I got at the store. 
I didn't use the whole flour, cornstarch, and sugar mixture.. just used enough of it to cover the strawberries.
This was a huge hit and my husband LOVED it!! Will def be making this again :)

Way too sweet with strawberries, in my opinion, so I make it with fresh peaches and it is to die for!  I get repeated requests for it from everyone who’s ever tried my Old Boys Peach Pie!  Give it a try!

I have made this twice now, and I LOVE, LOVE, love it!! I found the perfect pie crust for it and used some of the suggestions of others. i.e. not using all of the thickener, and using brown sugar. But I've made it in the "pure" recipe sense too, and it came out delicious, if not a little messy. lol The second time I mixed the strawberries with blueberries and YUM! Great recipe, definitely a keeper!!

This recipe is described by my daughter as deliciousness in a bowl. Of course we had this warm with vanilla ice cream. The topping was sweet and crispy. As it is strawberry picking season right now, we will be making this again next week.

This pie is really, really good.  We read the comments and took a hint from CookingCutie on the topping and used her oatmeal mixture.  I used a storebought pie crust and berries we picked ourselves. We did not mound the berries as previous reviewers suggested we did not do.  Here is my secret for a delicious fruit pie, shared only here.  Before mixing the ingredients together to stir into the fruit, I allow the berries to sit in some of the sugar for a while. Then reduce the sugar in your flour-cornstarch-sugar blend.  Each portion of the pie was good, and if you like yours slightly tart, reduce the sugar overall even a little more.  We added some whipped cream and everyone loved it!

I made this recipe exactly as suggested and it was excellent.  It IS sweet; it's a very old-fashioned, simple recipe.  It reminds me of something my grandmother would have made.  I suppose you could do without some of the sugar, but with summer-fresh berries, you can splurge once in a while.  I made it today for Father's Day, and it's just about gone (even though there were several other desserts).  I did heap the berries, and it turned out beautifully.

Delicious! I made this pie for a Memorial Day community picnic and received nothing but raves.  The pie was made as originally written and left no gooey white layer. The crumb topping turned out lightly brown and beautiful. I will be making this pie again.

This is not the prettiest pie but it is soooo good! I make it at least once or twice every summer. Be sure and bake this on a cookie sheet because it can bubble over a little.

While I typically take the suggestions of other reviewers, I, thankfully, did not this time. Don't waste your efforts making an oatmeal topping as others suggest. Follow the recipe exactly, with the exception of the last minute sugar addition  during the last 10 minutes of baking if strawberrys are already sweet enough and enjoy!!! It was excellent and so much better than the gooey gelatin versions of strawberry pie you see so often.

Found this recipe last spring, and it has become a favorite. Did not change a thing (except I use Pillsbury pie crust when I don't have time to make crust).   A beautiful, simple, delicous pie.

Nice tasting pie. Very easy to make. I'll definitely be making this one again. I would suggest someone elses advice that I read and taste your strawberries for their sweetness first. Mine weren't and I would have like them better sweeter.

I don't usually do reviews, but this was SO superb that I have to write. My whole family loved this. I made it for the 4th of July, made some homemade whip cream and topped with a few blueberries for the occasion. My family is having me make it again!!!  SUPERB!!!!!

This is the absolute best strawberry pie I've ever tasted! I've tried a couple of hot ones and none of them compare to this one! Definately use a drip pan so you don't make a mess in the bottom of the oven. No changes needed for this one!

Very good pie.  My family loved the crunch buttery topping.  I made it with strawberries, and then the other day I made the recipe but substituted fresh cherries for the strawberries  .  Excellent with some heavy whipping cream whipped up.

This was very good. I usually prefer the unbaked type of strawberry pie, but I liked this.  The topping is very good. I found that I did not need to mound the berries much, mine were not settling on their own, so I pushed them down toward the end of the cooking time. Next time, I will not mound them quite as much.

this was more like a strawberry cobbler than a pie, tasted good but very, very sweet. If I make this again I would probably 1/2 or1/3 the flour/sugar topping.

I did receive several compliments on it, and a request for the recipe.

Unfortunately, I had to use frozen strawberries.  I added a touch more flour to compensate for the added moisture that comes with the frozen fruit.  
It turned out fine and tasted good.  I really like the topping.  A nice change from simply adding another pie shell on top.

Wonderful!!!  The juices of the the strawberries makes the pie sooo yummy!!! :)
Very easy to make and not to mention pretty healthy with the berries.  I used "I can't believe it's not butter" spray to make it low in fat.  Thanks for the recipe!

it's good enough and light and fresh, but it gets 4 stars because pretty it isn't...
and I had a bigger mountain of fruit in the middle but it tended to burn if I left it in the oven more hoping it would spread evenly...

This was awesome!  I've never had strawberry pie before.  I used a 9" crust...mounded the berries.  But they didn't cook down as expected and I still had a pile in the middle when it was done...I'll spread them out more next time.  Nobody complained, tho!

The reviews don't lie!  This pie is delicious and easy.  My family and friends absolutely loved it.  I had less luck when I froze fresh strawberries and defrosted them-- the pie sunk a little as it was difficult to 'mound' in the middle.  My mom used fresh strawberries and found them too mushy for the middle.  This pie is best the day after making when the middle really 'gels' together.  Make this for your next summer get-together.

Great Recipe! We had just enough strawberries for 1.5 pies, so for the second pie we added some ripe nectarines and it turned out delicious!

This is a great pie.  I added some extra strawberries and omitted the 15 pats of butter and sprinkle of sugar at the end.  Will make again!!!

I am giving this recipe a great rating because it is simple to prepare and tastes delicious!! It looks funny at first, but it tastes great...especially with some vanilla ice cream.

I liked the fact it was different.  You MUST add more strawberries, other wise the "mound" doesn't bake high out on the sides.

I am not the best pie maker, but this recipe made it very easy to get good results.  I made two the first weekend I found the recipe, and the second was better than the first!

hmmm...  maybe it's just what you like..  I didn't really like the pie much for the first time I made...   The 2nd time I made, I didn't eat but my family loved it!

This was the first Strawberry Pie I ever had and it was delicious.  I read the reviews first and also used 4 cups - maybe it was supposed to be 1-1 1/2 quarts?  Anyway,  it was terrific and I can't wait to be able to make it again.

It was heavy on the butter;
definitely needs MORE strawberries (min. 3-4 cups);
delicious!
