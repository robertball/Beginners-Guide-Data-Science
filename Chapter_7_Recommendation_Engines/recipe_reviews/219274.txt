Loved this recipe.  I had done a couple of tweaks to it.   I floured the chicken before I dipped the chicken into the egg then bread crumbs.  I also did as one of the other reviews had suggested.  After I cooked all the chicken I added about 1 tsp. of butter into the non-stick fry pan to which I added 1 tsp. flour.  Once incorporated I added about Â¼ cup milk, cappers, 1 tbsp. capper juice and 1 tsp. lemon juice.  Mixed and allowed to simmer for a couple of minutes.   Family loved it thanks Lisawas for this recipe.  Will be doing again.

This was tasty. I used panko bread crumbs, added salt and pepper to the chicken and pan fried in a mixture of olive oil and butter until golden brown and cooked through.

I squeezed lemon juice onto the chicken along with the caper juice and served it with salad.

Super easy and delicious to make!
I used chicken tenders and left the capers out. Yummy! :)

This is a great dish! The directions for the sauce were perfect, as a novice cook I needed that specific info. I added garlic as well as some cornstarch to the sauce to make it even thicker. I didn't have wine (cooking or regular) on hand so used a mixture of half apple cider vinegar and half water. That worked just fine but next time I'll make sure to use wine for more flavor.

Yummy! Everyone in my family likes this lemony chicken. I served it over Trader Joe's lemon pepper pasta. A real hit! Will make again and again.

It was pounded chicken with capers on top. Nothing special. If you like capers, it is good -- capers on chicken.

Made recipe exactly like offered with one change:

Made a lemon caper cream sauce with heavy cream and drizzled it over the top.  Awesome.
