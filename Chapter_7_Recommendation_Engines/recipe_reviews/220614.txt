Excellent!  I grated the potato into my salad spinner full of cold water, then rinsed the potatoes and spun them dry.   I omitted the onion salt and added 1/2 of a small white onion, finely diced.  Instead of bacon bits, I fried 3 slices of bacon and crumbled it into the potato mixture.   Initially I made 3 large pancakes then for the next batch I did much smaller ones, about a Tablespoon full each.  We really liked the crispy edges.  These are a little peppery, which we like but if I were making these for company I would cut the pepper to 1/2 tsp.  Thanks for a great breakfast treat!

These were a hit with my husband, and they are pretty easy to make. I do think that they might be better with shredded pre-cooked potatoes, as they were a bit gummy, but living in Mexico, I cannot get russet potatoes, and our potatoes are high in water content. All in all, well worth making again. Like another reviewer suggested, I think I'll add minced onion next time. Great side dish with ham and succotash! Thanks for the good recipe.

I found this recipe looking for a way to use up some leftover boiled potatoes. It didn't quite fit, as it calls for uncooked shredded potatoes, but I decided to wing it anyway, just mashing the potatoes. Glad I did, as these were delicious. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and would only change it by adding some fresh minced onion next time.

When I found I was out of potatoes, I substituted them for yams.  Cut the recipe down by a quarter...that's right, bacon-potato pancakes for one.  I do work out 3-4 times a week and this isn't a regular thing for me so, I swear I'm healthier than this post will lead you to believe.  

Anyways, this was more like a paste going into the pan as opposed to pancake batter.  Subsequently, it became clear about 10 minutes in that it would have to come out of the pan as a paste as well.  That's okay, impromptu chef-as-creative-genius, voila.  

There really isn't much that holds this together so, all in all, this is more of a breakfast paste than you spoon feed yourself rather than pancakes.  I would have preferred just the 4 pieces of bacon I put into the batter.

Having made traditional German pancakes my entire adult cooking life, I thought I'd give these a try. I eliminated the bacon bits because this was going to be part of my twice weekly vegetarian meal. Found these to be very hearty and extremely tasty. I will remember to add BUTTER to my traditional potato pancake shortening, certainly adds more flavor.

Loved it. It was very easy and delicious. I added shredded yellow squash to amp up the veggie content, omitted the bacon but didn't need to increase the salt, between what it called for already plus the cheese, it was just right. I fried it on a griddle with just a light coating of oil and it turned out beautifully. Then I seasoned Greek yogurt with some sugar, garlic salt, chili powder, ground mustard and served it with the 'cakes instead of sour cream. Sriracha on my own (kids don't like heat) and it was moan worthy.

I thought this recipe was okay. I think, I may be more of a purist when it comes to hash brown potatoes potatoes. This had a lot of flour and cheese for my taste. For the potatoes I used one bag of Simply shredded potatoes. I added the optional real bacon bits. To reduce the calories I baked them instead of pan frying. I sprayed a non stick muffin tin with cooking spray, filled all 12 cups, then sprayed the tops of the hashbrowns and baked them. That avoided using the 4 tablespoons of corn oil and 2 tablespoons of butter. Calculating the calories, as made, they equalled 136 calories a hashbrown muffin which is fantastic. I accidentally forgot the baking powder, but really wish I wouldnt have. It is necessary because they will be very heavy without it due to the amount of flour in this recipe. I baked them at 380 degrees for 45 min.

Excellent potato pancakes! Made 1/2 batch because there are only 2 of us. I did rinse the potatoes to remove some of the starch & drained them well before combining with the other ingredients. I also combined all of the dry ingredients before folding into the wet. Used canola oil because that's what I have.

My daughter makes potato pancakes every Sunday for me, and I had her try them this way last time. She followed the recipe almost exactly, using a splash of milk rather than a half cup, real bacon, and mxing the butter into the cakes instead of with the oil. They were amazing! Crispy, cheesy, full of flavor! Wonderful recipe, thanks.

Made this following it almost exactly with the exception of 1/2 a lg sweet onion grated  into the GRATED not shredded (as some are saying..and doing which is very different in texture and taste!), I also used about 3/4 cup of flour (ran out of milk so used some powdered milk/water sub= to 1/2 cup, I added a bunch of chives, 1/2tsp Hungarian sweet paprika and used 3 tbsp peanut oil and 1 tbsp veg. Oil(instead of corn oil) w/2Tbsp of butter . I really had excellent results... ANYONE rating this recipe Negatively who didn't follow it is being very unfair to submitter of this and is inaccurately rating a recipe they did not make.. sweet potatoes are not even close to russets and it was a unfair review. 
Authentic Eastern European potato pancakes are grated on a box grater..the shredded potatoes are more of a hash browns kind of result..these were not heavy or like glue or anything but light fluffy and had ALOT of great flavors.
My very small differences like oil I used was based on potatoes are good in peanut oil and I didn't have any corn oil..I also like Hungarian sweet paprika on my potatoes. Chives I had fresh and needed to use up.. grated onion I always add to my Lithuanian potato pancakes so I added in these...but I followed measurements and other ingredients as per recipe and these were delish.. I will have one in the morning with a runny yolk fried egg! Eggs over easy w//runny yolks are delish with potato pancakes!
Thank you for sharing you really good recipe!

These came out great! Next time I'll have to double the recipe. Mine came out looking like the pictures. Golden brown on the outside, yummy good on the inside.  I did use russet's as called for in the recipe.

We enjoyed this recipe. I made one adjustment (other than scaling the recipe down to serve 3, which yielded 6 large cakes). I needed to make them wheat free, so I omitted the flour and subbed a Tbs of dehydrated potato flakes. This gave them the body needed to hold together. They were flavorful and hearty!

Good recipe. My husband said "save this recipe, these are really good".  This is easy to adapt to personal tastes or to ingredients on hand.  I didn't add bacon or onion salt and used all cheddar since I didn't have any Parmesan. The first batch were not cooked long enough so they were gooey on the inside, the second batch I turned the heat down a bit and cooked them longer and they were perfect. Thanks for sharing the recipe. I will definitely be making these again.

I HATED potato pancakes as a kid. These are nothing like what I remember. They are great, easy to make, and not the Grey goop  I remember. They are golden awesomeness. 
I did use white instead of russet because that's what I had, and all cheddar. I used light cheese and egg beaters, and shredder instead of grating because I'm lazy and my food processor is a time saver.
My two year old gobbled them up, and this is a really fussy toddler.

Made it for my family for breakfast. .. it was a hit. I added a dash of pepper and switched milk with whipping cream to give it a creamier texture. I would make it again.

I followed this recipe as written and they came out great!  I followed the advice of some of the other people and soaked my shredded potato in cold water and then rinsed again before mixing with the eggs, cheese and milk.  Since my family likes a bit of heat, I did add some cayenne pepper and that was it!  I paired them with some sour cream mixed with a bit of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  I will definitely be making these again really soon!

These were awesome! I added no salt seasoning and chopped onion, omitted the salt and onion salt AND baked instead of fried and they were pretty tasty! 
Served with a dollop of sour cream.

Delicious. Stuck to the recipe and worked out perfectly. Used the leftovers for breakfast with a poached egg.
I am always on the lookout for new ideas on how to serve potatoes as a side dish, I was not disappointed.

I enjoyed this recipe very much, it was a big hit with the rest of my family as well. I suggest dipping the pancakes into ranch dressing or sour cream, we tried both for an experiment and they tasted delicious. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Mine are not as pancak-y looking as the other photos on this recipe but I did cut back to 2 potatoes so I adjusted the ingredients in half, and since all potatoes are different sizes it's hard to tell if everything evens out.  Tasted great though, LOVED the bacon addition, which I fried up three pieces and chopped for these.  Very good!

This was medium on difficulty, so mix with easy dishes if you like to keep things simple.  It was really yummy warm, but not as good after it cooled.  Use the large cheese grater.  I used two large russets and it made 10 patties.  Next time, one large potato should be plenty for our family of 4.  Also, would be yummy for breakfast.  Everyone liked except my child that doesn't like potatoes or cheese.  They were a bit greasy (high in fat), so keep that in mind when you are pairing with other dishes.

I had just received two bags of potatoes and needed to use them up when I found this recipe. I omitted the bacon bits and onion salt because I didn't have them, and I added some green onions instead. I served them for breakfast and my younger sister, who is VERY picky with her food, requested for more. These were delicious and super easy to put together! I will definitely be making these again.

Very good. Have eaten potato pancakes my whole life but never thought of adding cheese.  I really liked them.

This recipe was fabulous!  We had leftover mashed potatoes so we used approximately 6 cups of mashed potatoes to make a double batch.  And like others mentioned, we grated a little onion instead of using onion salt since I don't have it.  Great recipe!!!

This is a new family favorite at our house!  I follow the recipe exactly every time I make it and we are never disappointed.  My pancakes turn out just like the picture.  I serve mine with sour cream.

These were so tasty. I added a bit more seasoning but only because we like things favorFULL. Made it for St. Patty's day. Kids loved them. Cooked a bunch and then kept in the oven to stay warm.

This is a nice, hearty dish.  I give it 4 stars rather than 5 because it seems like it needs a little bit of a kick.  Perhaps using a sharper cheddar would help.

These were comforting and easy to eat...I add fresh onion instead and made the full amount but would half it in the future so i'm not in the kitchen for an hour....would love to have a version where they're put in the oven somehow...have lots of leftovers after three of us ate them for dinner, id make them again with added sweet potatoes and green onion garnish

YUMMY, in capital letters! I had a little trouble with the first batch, as they were a little on the runny side. So, on the second and third batch, I used three egg yolks, and one egg white, instead of the two whole eggs stipulated in the recipe. Which resulted in big smiles from everyone.

You will need to  squeeze the shredded potatoes in a cloth, a lot of liquid.

@dfbour's review is the dumbest review I've seen online.  Giving a 1 star review because she doesn't know anything about cooking and substituted it with YAMS. Idiot.

Anyway, I've followed this recipe exactly how it was written and it's great. Don't let idiots who cook it differently then whine about how crappy theirs ended up being discourage you

These were amazing! I followed the ingredient part exactly, but  I made a lower fat version by taking another reviewer's idea of using muffin tins sprayed with Pam instead of frying them in oil. I also sprayed the top with Pam. 400 degrees for 45-50 minutes. It made 20. Delicious!

I had no Parmesan cheese, so I used more cheddar (marble) and these held together very well and tasted great.  As this was so easy to prepare, it is definitely going on my go-to list to get us out of the plain old potatoes rut!

I love Potato Pancakes and have been searching for a good recipe. I will look no further! This recipe was delicious and my family loved it!. I made only one change and that was to omit the onion salt and shred one half of a sweet onion into the batter. I also used my food processor to process the raw potatoes.   Will make again and will add it to our regular recipes. Thank You

Very important note, if like me, you've never made potato anything (other than baked) before: After shredding, YOU MUST DRAIN THE WATER OUT/DRY THE POTATOS! Otherwise, you'll just end up with a gloppy, mush that will not turn out well :( Having said that, this recipe was easy, quick and delicious. A little bit on the salty side, but nothing that either cutting back on the butter/salt beforehand, or just using ketchup afterward, can't take care of (^v^)

I liked this recipe very much. The pancakes come out very greasy but with the flavor of the butter. Very yummy. I was worried about the potatoes being undercooked inside the pancake but they were perfectly cooked. I grated the potatoes and cheese in the blender because I don't have a grater. Overall, very good recipe.

I made a few changes to make it vegan, and it turned out great.  Even though I was just using leftover boiled potatoes (and a bit undercooked), I'll be making this again, with the same changes I made.  I smashed the potatoes (there were still some chunks), which I think is less a hassle then shredding.  I used "swiss" and "parmesan" cheese from my Uncheese cookbook, bacon-flavor bits, vegan butter, soy milk, and Energy Egg Replacer. I also added some green onion and basil (only because I had some, but I'm sure it would still be good without them). And unlike another reviewer who said that her's came out pasty, even after 10 minutes of cooking, mine was never pasty, not even to begin with, and 10 min would have been way too long.  I cooked each side for about 2 min at about 325 degrees, and they all came out to be nice and golden and crispy.
