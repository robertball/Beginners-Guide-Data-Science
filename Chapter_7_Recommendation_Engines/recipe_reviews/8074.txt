Hello gang!

LueWana here reviewing yet another note worthy recipe.  I found this cake to be very moist and it holds up well.  Will last a week and still maintain it's flavor and moistness as long as it is either wrapped well in plastic wrap or placed on a cakestand/plate with lid.  I also subbed some items.  Not being very big on extracts and preferring truer flavors, I used a bit of vanilla bean, one bean to be exact, and opted for fresh lemon zest, about 1/4 of a tsp.  I left out the coconut extract, and used Puerto Rican Dark(spiced)instead of the rum extract. The end result was fabulous!  This is a basic pound cake recipe that will allow you use the flavorings or extracts that you prefer.  I tried this recipe again using just vanilla and lemon zest and still obtained spectacular results.  Watch your baking time, adjust it according to the type/size pan you are using.  I used the Fleur d'lis pan and had enough batter left over to make a few individual bundt cakes.  Hope this review helps or gives you some new ideas!

Wonderful, delicious recipe!  I used orange, rum, almond, coconut and vanilla extract, since that is what I had on hand. The glaze is a must, makes the cake so extra wonderful! I did not pour the glaze over the cake, I brushed  it on with a pastry brush.  One problem, it boiled over the 12 cup bundt pan I used..next time I will use less of the batter in the bundt pan, then maybe make a small loaf also. This pound cake has to be the best cake I have ever eaten.  Everyone at work raved about the taste and moistness.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

This cake was simple to make, it came out perfect! The only substitution made, was using various flavors of extracts - I used what was on hand (almond, vanilla butter nut, lemon, banana). The cake is so moist and flavorful...It's a keeper!

Excellent, excellent, excellent!! Very moist and buttery--baked up perfectly (1 hr 20 min) and made a nice presentation. Did not need a glaze at all. Very flavorful and still wonderful after 3 days. Will add this one to my permanent file.

This cake was fantastic, everyone I make it for loves it even the pickiest eaters. I am always changing up the flavors and sometimes even add a bit of rum to the recipe. The only thing that I do differently is brushing on the glaze in layers while the cake is still hot so that it can soak into the cake. Then I chill the cake for a few hours then add powdered sugar to the glaze mixture and add a final coat before serving or wrapping individually. Thank you very much for this great recipe, I will cherish it always.

I used orange extract instead of lemon.  The coconut extract "took over", so I would cut back on that next time.  The cake kind of rose funny, like it needed a bit more leavening.

This is a very good pound cake.  it has the same ingredients of the 7-up pound cake with the exception of the milk for 7-up and all of the flavors.  I did add a pinch of salt to the flour mixture.  Excellent, thanks a lot.

Love Pound Cakes, and this one is superb!! Play with your extracts, going by personal taste, but the combo here is very good, only thing I did different was use real rum. Be aware though, my cake was done in an hour, not the 1 1/2 it called for. Maybe I had my oven set wrong, will have chance to test it again, as I know I'll be making this winner often!!

Delicious!  I added some chopped candied cherries and only used vanilla and rum extracts.  The cake turned out delicious and moist.

This recipe is great. I was looking for a 5 flavored pound cake recipe to make a pound cake like my aunt. Since I found this recipe, everybody wants me to give it to them. There is never any cake left when I make it. The only thing I change is I use 1/3 cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of water for the syrup. 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of water is too much for me. But excellent recipe.

Very good cake, extremely moist.  I followed the directions exactly.  A couple things should have been mentioned in the recipe.  First, you cannot fit all batter into a bundt pan-it almost overflowed and when flipped onto a platter it didn't look as good because it had baked out of the pan and looked flat and odd shaped on the bottom.  So, do not use all batter for this cake.  Secondly, it didn't say to let it sit for 10 minutes or so before you flip and glaze.  A hot cake cannot come right out of the pan.  Let it sit for awhile and then glaze it.  If you want to fit all of the glaze on you will have to brush it on until it all soaks in.  Great flavor overall.  The texture seemed a little too soft to cut nice.

I don't know what went wrong. The cake was very wet and had a wierd after taste(I think it was the almond in the glaze-wet stuff). My family would not eat it and I ended up throwing it out.

My sister-in-law and her friends rave over this cake, and she actually pays me to make it for her.  So much flour and sugar, you need to use a huge bowl.

This is an excellent cake. It's nice and moist. I didn't have rum extract or the buttered flavored extract, I did have brandy extract and used almond extract in the cake and in the glaze. My husband loves it. He said I can make it again! Highly recomend.

The cake was perfect and I'm a novice baker.  Moist and lots of flavor.  So good my BF had some with his breakfast this morning.  And he doesn't go gaga over sweets at all.  The only issue is the "glaze".  Didn't suit me, so I will try something else!!  But printed this out and it is a keeper.

Oh my, do yourself a favor and make this cake! I made a citrus pound cake and everyone was so excited to eat a second piece. Normally I end up throwing out the last couple pieces of pie/cake, but not with this recipe!

I like to review a recipe as it is written, not rate it with changes made. This was good but I wasn't as huge a fan as most. I would not bake it quite as long. I also prefer a more dense texture to a pound cake. This was lighter like a yellow cake. The flavor was good but it seemed very strong and syrupy sweet where it was soaked in, and lacking in the middle. Not bad but I think I'll keep looking.

This was the first time I made a pound cake that incorporated so many flavors so beautifully. I truly enjoyed this as it brought me back to my childhood of summer cookouts in the country. Pound cake is not something I make often but when I do, I will surely use this recipe.

This is the one I tried so far, not the sour cream pound cake.  This came out perfect the first time and I enjoyed the granulated sugar glaze versus a powdered sugar glaze.

This pound is very good. My husband ate almost the whole thing. He loved the crust it made and my kids said, it was the bomb. Excellent recipe. Thanks

WOW! I have never made a pound cake before. I didn't have a selection of extracts to use, so I went with vanilla extract, some coconut rum, and fresh lime juice. The batter itself was unbelievably delicious (I'm a spoon-licker). And when it came out of the oven, it was sooooooo moist and perfect. I melted some white chocolate chips with some lime juice, a little milk, and some confectioner's sugar to make an 'icing.' All the guys at work thought it was heaven.

I thought this was really good. I only had butter, vanilla, and lemon flavoring. I thought it had too much lemon flavor but my guests LOVED it and I brought one to work and they loved it. Very moist.... It does make an odd amount of batter. I made one loaf and one small bundt.

I hate to disagree with all other reviews here... but I found this cake to be just so-so. The flavors all seem to be at odds with each other and the glaze adds to the flavor competition. Yes, it's moist but the texture is not nearly as nice as other pound cakes I have made. It is very, very sweet and the glaze seemed to add more density, making it heavy, even for a pound cake. 

So... it's OK but not something I will add to my list of favorites.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday party and it was a hit! It was super moist and full of flavour, I had to change a couple of things due to what I had on hand in my pantry. I used some lime zest and juice as well as an ounce of real rum instead of the extract for the glaze, and since I had run out of milk I used coconut milk and omitted the coconut extract...Thank you, I will definitely make this again!

I thought the flavor was wonderful, however the glaze made it a little too sweet for my taste.  Next time I think I will just dust the cake with powdered sugar instead of pouring on the glaze.

Excellent.  I used the pound cake as the base for a torte that I made.  First I used a store bought mix, made it, took a nibble and promptly threw it all out.  I found this recipe and thought I would give it a try.

I did not have butter or coconut extract on hand, however, I did have Mexican vanilla that has a heavy scent of coconut ... smells like suntan oil, seriously.  I used that plus regular vanilla, the lemon extract and almond extract in the cake itself.  It was outstanding.  I will make this one again and again.  Just say no to store bought mixes!

This pound cake was fantastic.  The best I've had in a long time. The flavor combination was great.  I used my own blend of flavors:  lemon, orange, vanilla, coconut and almond.  Will keep this in the recipe file.

All of the extracts are a wonderful combination. My only change was to use confectioners sugar instead of white sugar to make it a glaze that hardens as you pour, so it's not running all over the place.

This cake was amazing. It will be my go to pound cake recipe from now on. The only flavorings that I had was vanilla and coconut and it was a great combination. I did follow someone else's advice and baked for 1 hr 30 minutes bb

I made this for a repast and everyone devoured it. All ingredients were room temp and I used vanilla, rum, butter and lemon extracts. I excluded the glaze. Instead and made a thin frosting glaze out of confectioner's sugar, vanilla and almond extract, coconut water and milk. Came out of tube pan perfectly moist with a great crust. I will definitely make again.

I have been making this cake for years.  It is a very delicious cake and it is always a special request from family and friends!  I do not use the oil. Instead I add another stick of butter. It gives a nice buttery flavor.  I use alcohol rum instead of the extract and less of the coconut since that is a very strong flavor.  I will at times use half the amount of glaze so that the flavor of the cake is more intense!

I thought the Something Different Pound cake was the best until I tried this one today.  Didn't have crisco but had vegetable oil.   It is delicious and moist.   No one can eat just one slice, just keep coming back for 2nds and 3rds.

This cake is wonderful. My family loves & my daughter wants me to make another for her b-day. I did not read directions correctly so I put the whole amt of extracts in the cake. It is yummy that way. We will eat this one quite often.

FABULOUS!  This is now my go-to recipe for dense, moist, yummy yellow cake.  I turned this recipe into a homemade rum cake (all the other rum cake recipes seem to start with "buy a box of cake mix..."!) by substituting rum for all the extracts except for vanilla.  YUM!  I used a bundt pan, and while in the oven the cake rose a bit over the top, as it cooled it settled down to just filling it to the brim -- a perfect size! Thanks so much!

Beacuse of the way the recipe is written, I confused the amount of sugar that was suppsoed to go in the cake with the amount that was supposed to be in the glaze and actually on put one cup of sugar in my cake. I also added orange extract which technically made it a Seven Flavor Pund Cake (if you include the butter extract as a flavor). I was kind of bummed about not having enough sugar so to compensate, I added an extra cup of sugar to the glaze and poured it on thick when the  cake was fresh out of the oven. You couldn't even tell the difference. The cake was delish and all was great at the end of the day. In all honesty, I believe if you use 3 cups of sugar in the cake there's no need for the glaze... it would be too much.

This pound cake is yummy!  I made it for my family and it was gone by morning.  planning to make it again today (only 2 days later)  The only thing I did different was omited the almond extract.  I also thicked the sauce for on top slightly.  highly recommended!

I have made this cake 3 times. The first time was a disaster I used self rising flour instead of all-purpose so it was salty and spilled all over the stove.  I made it again for Thanksgiving and the batter made a bundt and a loaf. I made it again for Christmas to take to work.  I go tmany complements on this cake. It was the best cake I ever made.

This recipe was a fabulous base to work from.  However, I did make some modifications.  I only used 1/2 teaspoon of each of the 4 flavors (almond, lemon, orange, raspberry), however, I used 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of coconut to balance the flavors.  Also, I used 7-up instead of milk.  However, I did add about a 1/2 cup of evaporated milk to the recipe.  Finally, I made the glaze out of sugar as the recipe suggest, then I added 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar to it.  This cake was a real hit for Thanksgiving.  Everyone is still raving about it.

This is the best pound cake I've ever made and eaten - Oh so moist and delicious. The flavourings can easily be substituted for what you or prefer without affecting the quality. I used this recipe for a wedding cake and everyone raved about it. Awesome!

I made this pound cake for a strawberry torte out of the Pampered Chef cookbook that called for a boughten cake...I am so glad I didn't rush to the store and decided to make it from scratch instead...this was perfect!  I did not have all of the flavorings, so used vanilla, almond, and butter - a teaspoon of each.  I baked it in a 17x12 in. pan for 1 hour...was a little too much batter for that size pan and don't think I will bake it as long next time...but I will definitely be using this cake the next time the recipe calls for "store bought"!

Five stars for flavor and texture!
I must say, however, that the recipe should state that it will not fit in a bundt pan.  I kept out some of the batter to put in a couple small pans, but everything ended up running over a bit.  
This is a rich, super sweet dessert - perfect for those special occasions!
