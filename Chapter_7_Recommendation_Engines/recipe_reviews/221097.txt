Great alternative for a nice salad. I used apples and dried cranberries as I had no mandarin oranges or raisins in the house. Served it with cinnamon rubbed chicken and some sauted zucchini. Made for a wonderful light summer meal.

I really liked this rice salad!  I used my lemon olive oil for the oil, but then later I was thinking that my blood orange olive oil would have made it even better---so next time.  I chose to use red onion, slivered almonds, red bell pepper, and celery for dinner tonight.  When I eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow, I'll add some golden raisins.  This has all kinds of possibilities, and that's my favorite thing about this recipe!  Thanks!

I think this is my new go to recipe for when I have leftover rice to use up. Easy, versatile, and tasty. This time  I used white vinegar instead of wine (cause I mis-read directions), dried herbs d' provence instead of tarragon (personal preference), peas, mandarines and raisins. I'll report back on my favorite variations after I've made this a few times.

I used garden peas, celery, red pepper, red onion, and shredded carrots. I added a bit more sugar as I increased the size for a pot luck. It is delicious!

Used a mix of brown rices, wild and white .Added an Asian pear and red grapes and onion.  This has possibilities of being great by doing a more flavorful dressing.  Might try an Asian type of dressing next time, using soy sauce and sesame oil.  An excellent way  to use leftover rice.

Really good.  I substituted with sunflower seeds and added sweet peppers.  Quick and easy.

Excellent, so light and flavorful.  One major change - the oil can be reduced by half. I omitted raisins and peas and used red onion.

Made this for a family dinner and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  I added toasted almonds, raisins, peas, bell pepper and onion.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!
