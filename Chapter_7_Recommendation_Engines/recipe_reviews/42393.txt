It wasn't until I started preparing supper that I noticed the microwave cooking method of this recipe which didn't appeal to me at all. Microwaving this would not have browned the patties and they would have come out looking rather anemic.  Also, the canned mushrooms didn't appeal to me, nor did the basic absence of seasoning. So... I skipped the salt and pepper in the recipe and used 1 T. of Montreal Steak Seasoning instead. I sauteed the patties in olive oil in a large skillet until nicely browned, adding sliced, fresh cremini mushrooms to the pan once I turned the patties over.  I mixed up the cornstarch with beef stock rather than the more concentrated consomme, poured it into the pan with the browned patties and mushrooms and simmered it for about 20 minutes.  The result was a moist and richly flavorful dish that took plain ol' hamburger to a whole new level! With these modifications, a 5-star, comfort food  dish! I served this with "Garlic Mashed Red Potatoes" and "Escarole and Beans," also from this site. This was just plain comfort food at its best!

I found the sauce to be very good, but the recipe needs some improvement in my opinion. The fact that it calls for the use of a microwave to cook the meat is very weird to me. The whole point of Salisbury steak is to brown the meat, as the flavorings infuse into the sauce when it is added later, and the meat will just taste better if it is browned. I would not change the sauce mixture, it was delicious. But I would suggest browning the patties in a skillet, then removing them, adding some olive oil (if necessary) and briefly sautee FRESH mushrooms  (as I hate canned), then finally add the sauce and let the mushrooms absorb some of that flavor as well, then add the meat and serve.

We loved this!  We do not care for canned mushrooms, so, I used fresh. I sauteed them along with the onions.  I did NOT put this in the microwave.

This recipe is very tasty. My family loves it. I didn't cook it in the microwave though. I fried the patties in a pan on the stove top until they were brown. Added the consomme mixture and baked them in the oven until they were done. It is a very simple recipe that the whole family can enjoy!

Well, this was a hit with both my husband and my son, but I didn't care for it. (I would have liked it onion and mushroom free, picky eaters beware!) I had to use golden mushroom soup and some beef broth as I was out of the consomme. This made plenty of gravy. I didn't microwave this, just did it all stovetop. This is a great comfort food.

I had to scale this down for 1 pound of beef. I used Beef Stock in place of the consumme. Like many others, I cooked this stovetop. It was really good. Next time I am craving salisbury steak I will come back to this recipe.

Fan-freakin'-tastic!!! I made the sauce and put it aside (I used approx 600ml of reduced salt real beef stock for the Aussies out there) and all purpose flour. I made the patties, using my food processor for the crumbs and onion and fried them with the lid on (helps to steam the insides). When brown, I took out, drained the fat, added some cubes of butter, some fresh chopped mushrooms and one of those small cans of sliced mushrooms in butter that I'd been trying to use up. After frying until the mushrooms soaked up the juices, I added the sauce liquid and simmered on high for about 5 mins. Turned it right down, added the meat and simmered on both sides for about 10 minutes. My child, who hates mushrooms, totally begged me for more.

Ignored the recipe except for the gravy. I pan fried the patties which I seasoned with s&p, garlic, and worchestershire. I also added more seasoning to the gravy and used fresh mushrooms and onions.

I agree with some of t others about the cornstarch gravy.  The next time I will definitely make the with flour.  My only changes were that I fried them, used fresh mushrooms and I added a little garlic powder to the meat.  This tasted great!

I didn't want to go to the store so I improvised with what I had. I had 2 1/2 lbs. ground beef, so I made a recipe and a half. I used one can condensed beef consomme and one can condensed beef broth. I used 8 oz. fresh mushrooms and considering that condensed soup is so salty, I omitted the salt. I sauteed the mushrooms in the pan with a little fresh garlic AFTER I cooked the meat in a little butter. I then added the liquid and scraped all the meat bits off of the pan into the "gravy". While mixing the meat mixture together, it was a bit dry so I added one more egg. I served this over hot buttered rice. This was a big hit with my whole family. NOTE: Double this if you can. This is even better the next day, warmed over.

I did not make in microwave, but either way the cornstarch gravy is off-putting and has an odd flavor. If you can make traditional gravy, do it! If not, you probably don't notice the difference. I made the patties, seared each side (3 mins) in a skillet then removed patties, added cornstarch/beef broth mix to the skillet, cooked until thickened, added the patties back to the gravy, reduced heat to low, covered and simmered 15 minutes. Overall, the recipe was basic to prepare and decent to eat, but the taste of the cornstarch just ruined it for me.

I thought the patties were very bland but the sauce was good. I fried the patties and then let them simmer in the sauce for about 20 minutes. I think with some added garlic powder and some kosher salt, it would have helped boost the flavor a bit for the patties but I won't be making this recipe again.

This was a great simple meal. My three kids and husband loved it. Buuut, I did not microwave it. I am completely against microwaving meat, even to defrost I avoid it as much as possible.So I fried it with the mushrooms and used beef broth instead of consomme, as suggested. I also put the Montreal steak spice instead of the other seasonings and it was fantastic. It will become one of our regular meals. Thanks

I dont know about this one...I didnt use the microwave, fried them on the stove. I also used fresh mushrooms. It was an ok dish but not my favorite! I added some beef boullion to the noodle water to add a little flavor to them, that was pretty tasty.

Like most, I changed the recipe based on others' input. Seasoned the beef with Montreal Steak spice. Sauteed the patties in a bit of olive oil to brown. Added sliced fresh shrooms once I'd flipped the patties over. Used beef stock instead of consomme. Simmered all together for aprox 20 min, (covered). Probably needs more than 2 TBSP of cornstarch as the gravy wasn't quite thick enough.

I had to give it four because I changed it, but the basic recipe gave me the base from which to work.  I used sautéed fresh mushrooms instead of canned, powdered gravy mix instead of consommé, "cheese and garlic" croûtons instead of bread crumbs, and onion soup mix (zapped in a little water to soften) instead of diced onion.  Like other reviewers, I also browned the patties in a skillet (although I will probably try the microwave method some time, to save time and clean-up) and simmered them in the mushroom gravy.  I'm really pleased with the results. I just need to work on my meat-dividing skills... Somehow, I ended up with no two patties the same size :P

Since I really hate the idea of microwaved dinner, I opted to combine others suggestions. I fried the patties (pre-made work well make sure to season first)to brown on both sides, added sauce and simmered for 10 minutes. I then transfered it to the oven for 30 minutes on 325. Always taste test the gravy before oven baking to make sure seasoning level is to taste, mixture may turn out a little bland. If that occurs, remove patties from pan, add in your seasoning, test again then once it is to taste pour sauce over patties then oven bake covered. Family ate it up!!

Very good!  I willuse a little less Worcestershire next time.  I cooked mine in a grill pan and then baked them.  I also used Turkey instead of beef, yum.  I will also make the sauce in a pan next time so that it is thick when I pour it on the meat.

WOW! Definite comfort food. Absolutely delicious. I too fried my patties like others did instead of microwave. That was the only thing I did different. Everything else needs to stay the same!!! Sauce was perfect, delicious and plentiful. Served it with homemade mashed potatoes and green beans and it was a serious hit.

the only time i'd ever had salisbury steak before was either at a cafeteria or frozen meals.  this was awesome!  the only things i changed were i used less worcestershire (3 tbsp. - it was to heavy the first time i tried it), and i used italian style dry bread crumbs because that's what i had.  oh! - and i also used 8 oz. of fresh mushrooms.

Big hit with my family. I used ground turkey. I made the gravy with fresh sliced mushrooms. I heated the gravy and mushrooms in a sauce pan and then slowly added it to the steaks as they cooked it the skillet. I also used beef broth instead of french onion.

I really liked this recipe.  I did not use the microwave though.  Instead I sauteed fresh mushrooms first, set them aside and pan fried the steaks.  Then I added half of the consomme and simmered the steaks so they were soft.  After, I made the gravy and added back the mushrooms and let is simmer for just a few more minutes.  I have made this recipe more than once.

I love this recipe, but I did make a tweak.  I discovered adding 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning adds tons of flavor.

I hardly ever cook main dishes in the microwave but WOW! We really loved this! My kids wouldn't eat it because of all the onions and mushrooms but my husband ate almost the whole thing! Very good. Just make sure you stir up the cornstarch mixture well and I added an extra can of mushrooms. THANK you for a recipe that kept me from heating up the house. GREAT RECIPE!

Great recipe.  I didn't have the beef consume` so I substituted low sodium chicken broth.  I added 1 medium chopped onion to the sauce in addition to the mushrooms.  I formed the patties and baked them at 350 on a wire rack, transferred them to a baking dish, added the sauce and baked another 20 min at 325.  It's probably a lot easier in the microwave but I liked the results from the standard oven.

great recipe! i gave this 4 stars because i did not use the microwave.  i sprayed a little pam and fried the patties until done, poured the gravy over the patties, and then let it cook(covered) for 5- 10 minutes until gravy thickened.  family loved it!

I really wanted to love this recipe, because I love Salisbury Steak, however I found it do disappointing.  This recipe is very easy to make, but lacks flavor.

The reason i didn't give this 5 stars because of the microwave idea.I couldn't see doing that so i fried the patties in about 3tbls.of oil.After they were about 3/4 done i drained most of the fat off and mixed 2 packets of gravy mix and 2c.water.I mixed the basil and worchester sauce in the gravy and poured it over the patties.I covered and simmered for about 10-15min.They were AWESOME!!!Served with rice and corn on the cob.

Not sure if I should give such a high rating to THIS recipe because I absolutely did NOT use the microwave. I did everthing on the stove and used a lot of the modificatons from previous posters such as fresh mushrooms etc. It turned out very, very good!!

Cooked on stovetop, store did not have consumme used beef broth instead,patties too thick, dry, did not like the basil.  I think oven and thinner patties may be better.

I made this recipe last night and it was pretty good.  I cooked my patties on the george foreman grill.  I gave it 4 stars because the patties didn't have enough flavor.  I will probably make this recipe again but will add more of the spices.

The sauce was excellent. I made mine on the stove and didn't have a problem getting it to thicken.  The recipe does make a LOT of sauce...more than enough for use on mashed potatoes or rice.

I did these steaks completely in the microwave and while the steaks tasted great the broth/gravy didn't really turn into a sauce. The cornstarch separated from the liquid. This tasted great but I'd use packaged gravy mix next time. Note: If making more than six steaks there's no need to double the gravy too.

This turned out pretty good and I'd do it again. I cooked the patties on the stove and then finished them off with the sauce in the oven instead of using the microwave. I used fresh mushrooms since I had them on hand. Didn't have seasoned salt so I used garlic salt instead and it was fine. I ran out of basil so I just threw in some Italian seasoning and that also worked. I'd cut down on the amount of onion next time.

This was great! The only thing I did different was I added the onions to the broth and not into the steaks. Everyone loved these. Will make again!
