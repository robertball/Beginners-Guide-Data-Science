OMG! OMG! OMG! Saw this yesterday while surfing the site. Hours later was checking the fridge for something to whip up quickly and BINGO there were the mashed potatoes a pack of bacon and some shredded cheddar. Was running late- dinner a must in 45 mins. OK Lets try this! OMG! It was quick, easy and out of this world good.Served them up with some baked eggs and fresh fruit for a quick dinner and was instantly hailed as a kitchen hero by 4 HUNGRY teens. Thanks rae! this one will definitely be a permanent keeper in my house. LOL my hollow legged 19 yr old just walked by and asked if he could make these for breakfast!!!

Potatoe cakes are an iffy animal.  Couple of tips:  If they seem to not hold together well, try adding a little flour to help thicken them up, and also, it is a must that they be well browned before you try to turn them.

Rae:  I tried making these cakes and had a heck of a time trying to keep them together when browning them.  They fell apart completely so I just mushed them all together and the result was still outstanding.  I just read your note about potatoes being cold when making the recipe.  My potatoes were NOT cold so now I know what I did wrong.  I'm trying it again with cold potatoes because the flavor was awesome and I'm not giving up!  Now you know why I am the "recipe mangler."

Awesome! I had made 'Baked Potato Skins' last night, so I had all the insides that I needed to do something with, and this was perfect for that! I mashed up the insides and mixed in some melted butter, milk, salt and pepper and then proceeded w/ the recipe. I used my large cookie scoop to portion the mixture into the pan, and then just flattened them and let them cook. These had great flavor (loved that these were fried in the bacon grease) and sort of reminded me of a cheesy hashbrown~YUM! We make something similar to these, except putting more of an Italian spin on them...this is a wonderful alternative to those and one I will be making again! Thanks, Rae, for sharing such a great recipe! :)

I like the idea of all the ingredents, but you need to be very careful on the consistency of the mash potatoes. If they do not hold together on their own like a pattie when you cook them they will fall apart. If you need to add flour or bead crumbs.

A waste of some really good mashed potatoes. I always make a new recipe as it calls for, even added one more slice of bacon. Came out dry and the flavors never came through.

Removing from my recipe box.

I used a bit more bacon and added some bread crumbs.  They browned up nicely in some butter.  Good way to use up left over mashed potatoes.

Made these and mixed panko bread crumbs with recipe.  Did not use bacon, because I had none, but did cook in a light mixture of butter and olive oil.  Fabulous!  Thank you for a great recipe.

I like this recipe concept and the proportions are good. I did add 1/2 cup of flour after reading the reviews, as that was the first thing I thought "where is the flour?"  My mother made mashed potato patties and added flour and also dredged them in flour, which gives a nice crust, which I did. This is definitely a keeper with the irresistable combination of bacon and cheese! Thanks!

I make these all the time.  I add some sour cream and flour and use just 1 egg.  Fry on low heat until brown.

My Mom used to make this all the time when I was growing up. The trick is in the cooking. If you don't brown them they will fall apart. When making the patties you may need to add a little flour especially if your mashed potatoes were fake/box /mix and not homemade. We always added the leftover corn to the batter also (we always had corn, lol) and then gravy. True comfort food, YUM!

I followed the directions to a T and they still ended up falling apart.  The potatoes were made the day before and spent overnight chilling in the fridge so that wasn't the problem.  I tried cooking the size recommended and they just fell apart.  Tried smaller and still fell apart.  I finally gave up and cooked them in the oven.  Flavor was okay.  I would not make again.

Not only do the potatoes have to be cold, but the potatoes have to be the thicker type of mashed potatoes. If they are the soft type, they won't hold together and you will need to add 1-2 tbs of flour to the mix. I also only used one egg and it seemed to be enough. You can taste the potato mix and see if they are seasoned as well as you like before frying.

I really loved this recipe!  The flavors were great, but I did have some issues with the patties falling apart in the pan (possibly because my mashed potatoes are always mashed red potatoes with their skins on).  I plan to make this again, but form the mixture into more than 8 patties next time since I think their large size had a lot to do with it.  I also would add an another slice of bacon (& probably another egg to help it hold together) since we are big on bacon around here.  Great recipe, though!

I did a search for recipes with bacon and cheddar and this recipe came up.  I needed something I could alter to my low carb diet and so I decided to give this one a try.  I replaced the mashed potatoes with steamed cauliflower but left everything else the same.  They were good but there wasn't much flavor for our tastes.  Next time, I'd add garlic, onions, maybe some parmesan cheese.  These were good and easy to make.

This was very tasty!  My leftover mashed potatoes had lots of sour cream and some small chunks of potatoes, so of course, they didn't stay together as well as they could have.  I also think two eggs was actually too much for my already soft mashed potatoes as well.  What worked best for me was making the cakes even smaller and using a fork to turn them over after they got crisp and brown on the bottom.  They fell apart when I used other utensils and didn't wait for them to get extra crispy on the bottom.  Next time, I won't use leftover mashed potatoes with sour cream and I'll only use one large egg.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

My family have made fried potato patties for years. From a very large family and always made our mashed potatoes from scratch. The secret to making these is a well seasoned cast iron frying pan. I don't understand why but a Teflon pan doesn't work as well. The patties tend to fall apart. We used to have these for breakfast.

I thought these had a good flavor.  I did make a few modifications based on some of the other reviews.  I used five pieces of bacon because we are big bacon eaters.  I also only had mexican blend cheese, but I was happy with it.  I mixed a couple TBS bread crumbs into the mix to avoid them falling apart, and coated them with flour.  I just pan fried them in butter and finished them in the oven.  Good flavor, but I think next time I'll coat them in breadcrumbs instead of flour.  To avoid having them fall apart on you, you must make sure that, when frying, they are nicely browned before you go to turn them otherwise, you will have mush.  Thanks for the recipe!

As written it's not that good because you really need flour to mix in with the potatoes and eggs in order to keep the patties together, otherwise they fall apart while frying. You also need real onion, diced small to give the patties some down home flavor since onion powder isn't going to do that.

A great base recipe to adjust to your own liking. I used 5 slices  of  precooked bacon because I had leftover grease in the freezer and it was faster. Only one egg and no salt. Also used a little garlic powder. As others have said, I needed to add some flour. Definitely dredge the patties in flour for a nice crisp crust. Also they're much easier to turn if they're really crispy. A new way to serve leftovers. My family loved them! Next time I'm going to add some diced jalapeno peppers ( from a jar ) to add a little unexpected kick. Maybe even top with some sour cream and sliced green onions?

Love this recipe. I made meat-loaf earlier this week and my daddy walked in the kitchen and said we will have left-over potatoes you could do that recipe again. (My daddy is extremely picky so the fact that he requested I make these again was just a big plus!)

I changed it up a little this time around though. Instead of using a tsp of onion powder I just sprinkled onion powder on it and then chopped up a couple of the green onions I had on hand and threw those in. I also felt like it needed a little bit more bacon so I cooked half a pack. 

I liked it better with the changes I made but it is good either way! :)

I left them alone until they had browned well before trying to turn them so they wouldn't fall apart. I gave this recipe just 4 stars because I added about half a teaspoon of Sriracha sauce to mine for that flavor boost.

It was great, but, I used my leftover twice baked potato recipe and just added the egg. Tasted great. The cream cheese helped hold it together and the green onion was definitely necessary.

I REALLY liked Irish Coleen's idea of using mashed caulflower for a low carb version. You will definitely have to add more seasonings as she mentioned. Garlic powder, onion, chives & and maybe parm cheese and pinch of red pepper flakes.Read the reviews about 1) fry mixture when mixture has chilled. Besides, it allowed for make ahead & fry later 2) adding 1 to 2 T. Flour, so they do not fall apart. One other note: Mashed potatoes do not freeze well....they get gummy.

I didn't expect it to be so good!  My family loved it too. This will be a weekend regular. No changes either, just make sure your PO's are cold.

Before I made the recipe, I did view some of the reviews.  I mainly wanted to make sure that these patties didn't fall apart and had some taste.  I made the patties according to the recipe but with the following:  I used 4 slices of bacon; I added bread crumbs; and Goya's Adobo seasoning (about a 1/4 teaspoon,  to me this seasoning always trumps bland, and it did).  Great way to use up the mashed potatoes from Thanksgiving.  Both my hubby and I enjoyed them.

This is an interesting recipe that I decided to use as a base for some lrftover mashed potatoes and some stuff I had in the fridge. Instead of bacon I used some smoked sausage that I chopped up then added a small, chopped onion and some chopped green pepper. My 3 year old, who's not a big eater, really enjoyed them. Like I said this is a great base and I'll continue experimenting with ingrediants.

Delicious. However you need to dust these with flour before you fry them otherwise they will fall apart. But  perfect for leftover spuds!!

These were delicious but I had to add extra flour. Next time I am going to try adding one egg instead of two.

Tried this recipe and it was great. I seem to always have leftover mashed potatoes following a big dinner.  I often make these patties the next morning for breakfast.

Add some flour to the potatoes and they will hold together better. In my country we serve these with the bacon on the side and lingonberry jam (sold at IKEA)for dinner. YUM. Tried them and the whole family liked this version as well.

don't know how you make potato cakes without flour. At first I doubled the recipe to make enough for a lg family and couldn't make patties because it was just too sticky. After I added enough flour to be able to fry them, it made enough for an army.  the end result was good though... very good

By the 2nd time I got it down perfect for us by lightly flouring the patties and frying them in butter. They only took about 3 minutes a side for a nice, crispy crust. A bit of garlic butter on top and my bacon-cheese-garlic-loving hubby said they were heaven on earth! lol

I liked this recipe even better than my usual recipe.  When I make mash potatoes I always plan on making the patties for breakfast the next day.  When I boil my potatoes I add an extra to the pot.  When mashing I remove 1 1/3 cup and set aside and go on as usual.  The reserved cup and a third I add very little hot milk, an egg, onion powder salt & pepper, crumbled bacon and the shredded cheddar. This mixture I put in a small Tupperware to form into patties the next morning, I don't form the patties until just before I'm ready to fry them.  Yummy

This is my favorite potato cake recipe I've found! Like others I've had problems with them falling apart... found that using my triple ply stainless skillet and cooking them on a fairly high heat works the best! Also, forming them and leaving them in the fridge as you fry the batches helps!

Our potato mixture was a little too wet. Second batch added a little flour and made the cakes smaller and that seemed to work  a lot better.

So amazing and easy to to do as others have done I added 2 tablespoons of flour. I also added a medium sauted onion to the mix as I'm crazy about my onions.

Great way to use left over mashed potatoes. I followed the recipt and some comments. Added the breadcrumbs (panko) and some seasoned pepper. The patties cooked easily and stayed together just fine. My daughter is taking a forkful everytime she passes the platter. Will definately make again.

Very good and super easy.  I didn't have bacon so I used olive oil.  I added a tablespoon of flour as other reviewers recommended and they were perfect.

It needed a bit of flour as a binder and I preferred to use fresh chopped onion instead  of onion powder, but love them.

The flavor of these was excellent!  I had trouble getting them to stay together when I flipped them, even though I followed the instructions exactly, including keeping the potatoes cold.  Mine also got a bit too dark at 4 minutes per seed, but that may be due to my stove, which I think runs a bit hot.  Will definitely try this again, but next time cook a little lower and slower.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have TRIED this recipe to the letter TWICE and I have yet been able to get the ingredients to stay together and form into an actual patty. All I end up getting is a big pile of MUSH in the pan. Don't get me wrong, I still eat the mess, but it hasn't YET made patties for me. I only used half of the prepared recipe the second time, just TRIED to form the patties, and no such luck. I was disappointed, and I am sitting here eating a plate full of mashed potatoes with bacon and cheddar cheese. Wanted this to work so bad, just didn't work for me. Any Suggestions ANYONE?

Had to add some flour to get them to hold together and I just don't like cheddar cheese in everything so I used 1/2 cup pepper jack.  That was just enough.  But something seemed to missing, not sure what.  But I will try it again with some other seasoning.

I did not care for this recipe. I used exact measurements here and ended up with a mess in my frying pan.
