5.5.17  I don’t know of a store where I’d find currants in the Tampa Bay area, but I read on line that golden raisins were a good sub, so that’s what I used.  I typically follow the recipe the first time through particularly if I’m the first reviewer, but I just knew that 2 tsp of salt would be too much for us for such a small roast, so I cut that in half, and moving forward I’d cut it to 1/2 tsp (this could be personal taste preference).  We’re pepper lovers here, so I left the 1-1/2 tsp pepper as is and would do so again.  I measured out about 1 cup of gingersnap crumbs and used about half of that to coat the roast.  Lot of oil left in the skillet after browning the roast, so I’d try 2 Tbsp of oil in the future.  It took 35 miinutes to reach the 145º temperature, but then it sat for quite a while waiting for my sweet potatoes to finish cooking.  As a result, the photo may make the roast look not so pink, but that’s a result of waiting for the potatoes, not the recipe's fault.  However, it still was juicy and tender.  The sauce was absolutely succulent and delicious.  I didn’t have apple cider, used apple juice, and I did thicken it slightly with a flour slurry for a nice pan sauce.  This was very good, and I would make again.

11/5/19. This was delicious. It turned out great even though we messed up on the directions! I’m sure it’ll be even better next time! It’s a great fall dish, and if you like anything fall (pumpkin spice, gingerbread, apple cider) then you will love this dish. We had it with the simple butternut squash recipe. Awesome combo!

Great recipe. I brined the roast (1/4 cup salt to 1 quart water) for about 6 hrs. I didn’t have gingersnap cookies, so I used normal breadcrumbs with a touch of sugar. I also didn’t have currants so just left those out, but otherwise followed directions exactly and it was wonderful. Perfectly cooked, wonderful flavor, a big hit at dinnertime.
