I made zucchini apple pie before, but this is the best dessert recipe for zucchini. I substituted 1/2 cup oatmeal for 1/2 cup of the flour and I also put chopped walnuts (1/2 cup) on top. Absolutely wonderful!

Awesome!  I added quite a bit more zucchini than the recipe called for and cut the sugar in the topping down to 1 cup.  I also substituted 2 cups of oats for 2 cups of flour and used whole wheat pastry flour for the rest to give it more fiber.

Absolutely FABULOUS!  My 80 yr. old neighbor accross the street grows zucchini every year because his wife likes them.  He will not eat zucchini in any form--ends up giving most of the zucchini to neighbors.  I took some of this cobbler to them, and just told them it was a delicious cobbler--then told him to tell me what kind of cobbler it was.  Of course he said "Apple".  When I told him it was zucchini, he wouln't believe me.  I had to go accross the street and bring the recipe to show him.  His wife now has the recipe, and he might eventually try zucchini in other tasty dishes.  A real hit with everybody who has tried it.  Thanks Beverly for sharing this delicious recipe.   Gordon

This is wonderful! Frost killed all our apples this year, but the zucchini is plentiful. I have found I like it better if I only make half the crust mix and put it all on the top.  The bottom seems to get doughy and mushy by the second day.

This was very tasty!  It even fooled my husband who doesn't like zucchini AT ALL.  I did make this more like an apple crisp, with the topping only on top and oatmeal for some of the flour. If you're thinking of making it this way you may want to lessen the topping ingredients.  There was way too much and I froze almost half.  Also, the zucchini really reduces in size and the next time I make it I will use all 5 cups for an 8x8 dish, not a 9x13.

I am shocked. My husband is shocked. I am amazed how cooking zucchini in lemon juice could make it taste like a tart apple! The texture was the same because I halved, seeded and sliced the veggie pretty thin. I also used half brown sugar an half white because I love the flavor that brown adds, along with 1/2 of the flour replaced with quick oats. Even when eating the zucchini pieces without any crumb topping at all, it is EXACTLY like an apple. Who knew?! Also, this dessert is not too sweet. I keep walking in to taste it and can't believe it.

I found that this recipe worked best with the over sized zucchini.  the smaller variety seemed to have a more bitter taste.  everyone who has tasted it was amazed tht it was made with zucchini.

Comfort food at its best! Serve warm with a little pitcher of heavy cream or vanilla ice cream. Recipe needs a pinch of salt in the flour mix and and like some of the other reviewers suggested, more zucchini. I cut back on the butter and it was still really good. Do not taste the zucchini while it is  
cooking (gross), just make this recipe and trust those who gave it 5 stars. Save your secret until everyone is licking their plates!

What a great recipe especially since we have a garden plentiful with zucchini! Both my husband and I loved this recipe and have made it twice in a month for different functions. It was hard to believe that it was made with zucchini and we still have some disbelievers. The only changes I made is that I used 3 cups of flour and added 4 packages of instant oatmeal-maple & brown sugar flavor. I also added a little corn starch to the heated lemon juice to thicken the cooked zucchini. I also added more zucchini! Thanks for sharing such a delicious recipe.

This was delicious and very flavorful. It had my whole family fooled as no one could believe it was made with zucchini! I too used 1 cup oatmeal  in place of flour and added walnuts on top. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

This is very good but it is a little dry, nothing that some ice cream or whipped cream won't fix!. It does have a great bottom and top crust. I used a huge zuke that I had and cut like I would apples for pie.. I did add cinnamon to the flour mix and used half white and half brown sugar (personal preference.) No one will ever guess this is zucchini! Thank you Beverly! UPDATE~ This is much better the next day. Gets moist AND is wonderful warmed up with vanilla ice cream!

This is absolutely incredible! Now I wish our garden would have produced MORE zucchini just so I could make this.  I did cut back on the lemon juice the 2nd time (1/3 cup ReaLemon juice and added 1/2 cup water) as it seemed a bit tart the first time.  It may seem like there's too much crust for the "fruit" and you may be tempted not to use it all, but please do.  The crust is fantastic.  We added just a few chopped nuts to the crust on our first try and that was a nice addition. People thought I was lying when I told them it was zucchini.  It tasted incredibly like apple - texture and all. (Actually better than apple in my opinion) Thank you, Beverly, for a new favorite recipe!

OH MY GOSH!!!  This was soooooo good!  It actually did taste just like an apple cobbler.  NOBODY could believe it.  I adjusted the sugar and cinnamon to taste (adding a little more than called for) and used the juice of two fresh lemons.  Next time (and OH YES there WILL be a next time), I am going to double the filling so it stands out more and does not get lost in all of the yummy crust and topping.  Excellent recipe! Thanks for sharing!!! UPDATE:  I made this again and doubled the filling and it was perfect!  Just give the filling a taste test to adjust the sweetness to your liking before adding to the crust.  RAVE REVIEWS!!!

OMG!  Fooled everybody at the table - one person (who loves desserts and loves to bake) said it was the best "apple" cobbler she had ever had - and was blown away when I told her it was zucchini.  I cut the number of servings, so altered the recipe in that way, but other than I may added a splash more lemon juice, it was true to the original.  I am going to use the rest of the 2 HUGE zucchinis that I was given to make more to freeze for later.  Thank you for an awesome recipe!

Yummy! My neighbor requested the recipe. I did not add a bottom layer (personal preference) So I halved the crumb mixture! Mixed half in with the cobbler and sprinkled remaining on top. Thanks for sharing

This recipe is very good..but it was too dry.  I think if you have a recipe for apple cobbler that you like..you could fix the zucchini in it like you do in this recipe and it would be better.  The zucchini does taste just like apples!

What a wonderful way to use zucchini, especially those that are the size of baseballs!! Enjoyed by all and the look of surprise when they learned that it was zucchini was priceless.  Can't wait for next seasons crop.

My whole family loved this cobbler!  They wouldn't believe me when I told them it was zucchini and not apples.  They thought I was joking!  Quite handy, too, since our garden is overflowing with zucchini.  You can only make so many loaves of zucchini bread!

I made this for my family. I am always looking for new ideas for our zucchini, from our garden.
This is THE BEST Zucchini recipe EVER!!  I used about 7 cups of Zucchini (1 LARGE) and I added approx 2 T cornstarch when my Zucchini was finished boiling.  This absolutely tastes like apple cobbler. Fam couldn't tell the difference.  LOVE this recipe and will make again. Thank-you for shareing. Kay in Nebraska

This turned out surprisingly well and was a great new way to use up the large quantity of zucchini we have right now.  The cobbler to zucchini ratio seemed off to me, though.  I didn't even use all of the topping, and I still felt like there was too much.  I would make this again, but either increase the zucchini or decrease the flour/sugar/butter mixture.

I used yellow summer squash!  No need to peel them.  This recipe is a definite keeper.  I did use extra squash, more like 7 cups instead of 5 .....always a good thing in my book when the plants are producing out of control.

Have tons of zucchini from the garden to use up. Found this recipe and decided to take a chance. Glad I did. I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. Only made a couple changes because of what I had on hand. I used 6 cups zucchini and simmered it w/ the lemon juice for about 20 minutes. I used 2 C flour and 2 C oatmeal and 1/2 C brown sugar and 1 C white sugar for the crust/crumble. Turned out great. For the person who said this was dry, its like a combination apple cobbler + apple crisp. Way too delicious not to make again and again. And because I followed the directions and peeled and seeded the zucchini, not one person in my family had any clue there wasn't a single apple used in this recipe.

ok, I have tried many, many recipes off this site and altho most are very good, I do not feel compelled to write a review very often.....but I had to for this one!  I made this and used my dad as a guinea pig (he is the consumate baker) He was stunned and amazed how this tasted!  I had a family BBQ last night with 40 people and All were fooled!  I did make a few alterations to TRY to make it a bit healthier.
1. I up'd the recipe by 1/2 to make 2 pie plate sizes rather than 1 9 x 13
2.  changed all white sugar to brown
3.  cut sugar way down. even tho I up'd the rest of recipe, I cut the sugar almost in half. using 1/2 cup mixed with zucchini and only 1 cup for the cobbler part.
4. used 1/2 flour and 1/2 rolled oats
5. I also did not mix half the crumb mix with the zucchini. I added 'some' tho to give it a bit of body.

I also found I had to cook the zucchini alot longer than 15 minutes and I agree completely that using the monster ones from home garden are the best.  Mine grow to over 1 foot long before I get around to picking them and this is the perfect recipe to eat those up.  I got orders for next week  :-)  This is a dessert that will be used ALOT

This was fabulous!! it came out perfect.. my hubby and son and grandkids just loved it  I did add 1/2 teaspoon of allspice for good measure .  ..Thank you for sharing I will be making this many, many, times  I always grow my own zucchini and have too much..I'll bet this recipe would make a great "apple pie" too !!Wonder how some vanilla ice cream would be on the warm cobbler?

This recipe was wonderful and a lot of fun! I made a few changes with it: 1 cup Splenda and ½ cup brown sugar for a little depth. Very easy to make. The only thing my wife could say when I told her it was zucchini, not apples, was WOW.  I had her take some to people at work and she got the same reaction.

Who came up with this remarkable recipe?  Congratulations!  It deserves a $10,000 prize for being so tasty and creative!  I did cut back on the butter to cut calories and the crust was more crumbly (but still good).  Also I stirred the cinnamon into the crust ingreds instead of on top, which is probably why it looked pale. The lemon is just right - do NOT cut it!  This is now one of my new favorite recipes!  The husband loved it, too.  Thank you, Beverly, for the ingenious recipe!

YUM! Family didn't realize it was zucchini between the layers of crumble. With amount of filling, used 8x8 pan, leaving quite a bit of crumble after covering zucchini, so put in fridge and used on Mom's Zucchini Bread. Being diabetic, I used all Splenda in the recipe and it was delicious!

I thought this cobbler was very good and it really tasted like apple cobbler. I call it zucchini bars because you cut it like bars. I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and it was still sweet. I didn't tell anyone the difference. I am going to make it again soon.

When my husband heard my daughter and I say that it tasted like apples... he didn't believe us.  After his first bite he simply said "That's just weird" haha.

I didn't use all the crumb mixture.  It was simply too much for me.  Additionally, I think I will make it will more zucchini next time.  But I highly recommend this.

Fantastic dish for a potluck! No one guessed it contained zucchini--they all thought it was apple. I ran out of lemon juice so I used ~1/6 lime juice and it was very tasty.  I also substituted 2 cups oatmeal for two of the cups of flour, which makes it a hair more healthy and very tasty. What a great way to use up a giant garden zucchini that grew while we were out of town. I'm only sorry that our zucchini plant died so I can't make it again until next summer.

This was GREAT!  The kids thought it was apples and couldn't believe it when I told them it was Zucchini!  We all thought it was 5 STARS...The only change I made was since I was low on sugar, I added 3/4 brown sugar to the zucchini, but I'm sure it just made it richer...DEFINITELY a keeper!!!!

I saw this recipe and wanted to prove to my dad that zucchini can be good. I made one for my dad and one for my family. My husband and my daughter loved it. I made a vanilla mousse using one pint whipping cream and one small box instant vanilla pudding. I did add one packet of brown sugar oatmeal and changed the sugar to 1/2 cup granulated and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also cut the crumb recipe in half after reading the other reviews. My husband kept asking me how I could get zucchini to taste like apples. I just laughed. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

The key to this recipe is cooking the zucchini until it is completely soft.  As long as you do that, this is delicious and no one will know it isn't apples.  I served it at a picnic and no one believed that it was zucchini (of course I didn't tell them until they ate it!)  Great recipe!

YUCK!!!! I was so excited to use this recipe and extremely disappointed.  My husband and I could not get over the texture of the zucchini.  You can tell it is zucchini!!  It does not taste like apples!!!   Don't have high hopes for this recipe.

This does taste like apples!  My husband even asked if I had used the apples from our apple tree!  I actually cut this recipe in 1/2 and used a 8" pie pan to bake it in.  The zucchini does need to be fully simmered and tender for this to taste just right.  This made alot of crumb in my opinion, so I saved 1 c. of the mixture and froze it for a later use.  Probably cut down on the fat content too.  I will make this again.  It's fun to surprise people too!

This was so amazing!  It was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  No one believed it was zucchini, they swore it was apple, only better.  I used just a little less sugar, because I figured I always like my apple pies a little tart, and it was perfect.  I thought maybe, that I had made the crust wrong because it was sooo crumbly, but it was perfect too (This was my first cobbler).  My Mother-in-law told me I made the best food at thanksgiving, which I thought was pretty nice.  Anyway, thank you for the great recipe, this is a definate keeper!!!

Wow.  I figured with 20 Five-Star Ratings I couldn't go wrong.  And I was right.  I didn't even seed one of the zucchini, and it was still GREAT.  I took it to a potluck and no one even guessed it was zucchini.  I told them and they didn't believe me.

Worthy of *****+ stars.  EXCELLENT.

Great recipe!  I let my husband guess what was in it (after several servings) and had to tell him.  He felt "cheated" since he was sure it was apples and think zucchini can not taste that good.  My 2 year old begged for more.  The 3 of us finished it in 2 days! Will be good warm with ice cream.

I had many people sample this and they all thought it was apples.  My grandaughter who is very fussy was in shock when i told her.  After she ate a bowl of it first.  She even asked for more the next day.. All my neighbors loved it also.

Fantastic and so easy to prepare.  My niece still has no idea that it is made with zucchini.  I did find it to be bit more dry than other cobblers I have had, but it still very good.  I will be making this again.  My thanks to Beverly for sharing.

Surprise, Surprise!  The best way to use those zucchini that just get too big!   It really does have the texture and taste of apples.   I just served it as "fruit" cobbler and made everyone guess the fruit.  No one guessed zucchini - but they ate it all!  The hardest part of the entire recipe is preparing the zucchini!

I tried this because I did not believe it would taste like an apple cobbler.  I love this recipe.  It is all the taste of an apple cobbler and my skeptical husband and picky children devoured it.  Also you can use splenda and it is 100% sugar free, for those diabetics in your life.

This really does fool people into thinking they are eating apple cobbler! I tried it with my husband, sister, and brother-in-law and they really had no clue! Great recipe and I would totally make it again!

Loved this! Thank you. I would not have thought to throw the extra zucchini into a cobbler, but it works really well!

Amazingly tastes like apples. I guess when you prep and cook it just like you do with apple cobbler... =) The only thing I didn't follow with the recipe was not doing the crust on the bottom--I'd personally rather have the extras on the top, not mushy on the bottom. It was hard to get people to try it--but once they did, the were amazed. Just tell people it's "cobbler". =)

So I have to admit that I had my doubts about this recipe...and couldn't believe that everyone who wrote in had tricked people into thinking this was an apple cobbler...but I swear, you will think it's apple, too!  I made this for dessert for a family dinner and told everyone it was apple cobbler before they ate it...my cousin won't eat anything with zucchini, not even the amazing chocolate zucchini cake my mom makes or zucchini bread.  I nearly died when she leaned over and told me, "This is in my top 15 favorites of your desserts!" and THEN she took another helping!!!  And my cousin is NOT a huge dessert person.  Too funny.  When I revealed what it really was, she nearly died.  I did make some changes in the recipe...I used about 8-9 cups of chopped zucchini, and I halved the topping mixture, and used only 1 stick of butter.  I also had to bake it for 55 minutes for the topping to get browned, and even then, it still wasn't as brown as I'd like it.  But it still tasted amazing, and I'll definitely make this again!

Had everyone fooled! I made people guess what they thought it was and heard everything from Peach to Apple. I ran out of lemon juice so it ended up being 1/2 lemon juice and 1/2 lime juice. It went over really well and will def. make again!

This is the best cobbler I have ever had!  My two eldest (9 + 5) never knew it wasn't apples.  Well at least initially, my 5 year old held up one of the pieces that I hadn't deseeded to the best of my ability, and proclaimed to all that there was a pickle in her apple cobbler!  Oh well, at least they were fooled for a little while!  They still continued to eat their dessert and my 9 year old just had a birthday and instead of cake wanted a cherry cobbler, so I used this recipe and substituted canned cherry filling for the zucchini...mmmmmm mmmmmmmmm good!

This was great!  Actually, we liked it better the second day.  I needed 6 cups of zucchini, maybe because I sliced rather than chopped it.  I'm going to try this with apples this coming Fall.  Yummy flavor!

I took this to a church picnic.  No one could believe that it was zucchini.  They all thought that it was apples and wanted the recipe.  Great to us if your out of apples or have an abundance of zucchini.

This was amazing.  I used the 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 flour and 1/2 quick oats as suggested by others. No one could tell that it was not an apple cobbler.  Took it to work and the same results, everyone wanted the recipe.  I will make this again!

I was out of lemon juice so I used lime.  If someone gave me a piece of this cobbler and told me it was apple, I probably wouldn't question it. The zucchini looked alot like apples inside.  However, it almost tasted more like rhubarb to me but maybe it was because of the lime.  Good stuff.

Delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly.  Definitely an excellent way to use up those giant zucchinis that get missed in the garden.  It did taste a lot like apple cobbler which is great because my husband LOVES apple anything, but still had a definitive zucchini taste to me.  I think I'll chop the zucchini a little smaller next time and add a bit more filling - then it should be perfect.

It's true that the zucchini tastes exactly like apples, although I was not crazy for the cobbler part.  I think the other recipe posted would be better not mixing the cobbler with the zucchini, plus I would add more zucchini next time.

Very Good!  Even my picky 5-year-old liked it (told her it was zucchini only "after" she ate it.  I would have given it a 5 except I did make some alterations after reading others' feedback.  I doubled the filling recipe and kept the crust recipe the same and put it in a 9 x 13 pan--came out in just the right proportions of filling to crust.  I didn't have fresh lemon juice so I used bottled.  Probably next time I will cut the amount back as I could definitely taste it--made it a little tart for my taste.  But my family loved it anyway.  Will make again.

This is a good recipe.  Was surprised that you couldn't detect the zucchini-but it didn't taste exactly like apples and someone even said "what fruit is this?" to me. Recommend as a use for bountiful zucchini.  Good stuff.

This is an excellent recipe. The first time I made it I fed it to my step-dad because he absolutely dislikes zucchini, and he loved it. I told him it was zucchini and he still loves it!!!I also made this for a family reunion and it disappeared. I slice the zucchini so it resembles sliced apples and nobody knows the difference. YUM YUM

This was fabulous, and everyone was fooled. I would have given this 5 stars, except I thought the crust was too dry. I have made this since with a different crumb topping and it was great. The filling though is very tasty.

Excellent recipe! Very clever! I went to a summer BBQ and told everyone that it was a "cobbler", then made everyone guess as to what type of cobbler it was.... No one had a clue and when I finally told them, they were amazed - they thought it was apples and pears! The only thing I would do differently is modify the flour/sugar/butter ratio for the topping. It was a little too crumbly for my taste and the top never got a golden brown like the recipe says (there was too much flour). The consistency of the filling was just right though. I suggest using this filling in any pie/cobbler recipe for a unique (and fantasic!) dessert year round! (However, the original recipe TASTED fabulous without any modifications, which is why I rated this 5 stars)

Wow!  This really does taste like apple.   The filling is great!  The crust and topping are very very sweet, though.   I wonder what the zucchini filling would taste like in "apple pie".

This is really good, a go to stand by recipe that I have made many times. No one yet has picked it isn't real apple crumble but zucchini.  I once didn't have enough zucchini so added an apple. It tasted the same.

This previous recipe I got from you didn't make any sense and was a failure. This one is written differently so maybe I 'll try it again.

Just try it!  You won't be disappointed!  My husband loves apple cobbler and was fooled!  My only recommendation is to use a little less nutmeg, as it was pretty noticeable, but it was still awesome!  I noticed some reviewers didn't use a bottom crust. I did, and it turned out great...not mushy, however, I'm sure it would be good either way.  A crazy way to use zucchini, but it totally works!!

It needs salt and also I thought it was too dry I would also cut the flower a bit that was more dry ingredients than was needed,
 but the butter amount would be perfect with less flour.
I would use a little more cinnamon and nutmeg also.

If you like Apple Cobbler then you will absolutely love this variation!  This is really good and yes, the zucchini tastes just like apples! I didn't change a thing other than halving the recipe.  Yum! Yum! and Yummy!

Made this today and it is awesome! Taste like apple crisp! Used 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of oatmeal only because that is all the flour I had. Turned out great!

Excellent!  What a surprise that zucchini could make such a wonderful dessert!  I will make this again.  Everyone loved it and didn't even know it wasn't apples!

This recipe was awesome. I made some changes reduced the sugar to 1 cup in crust, changed flour to 2 cups oatmeal and 1 cup whole wheat and also reduced the butter to 3/4 cup butter and 3/4 cup apple sauce.  Increased the cinnamon to 2 tsps in both the crust and the zucchini.  Yummy!!

Not very good.  It's edible, and we'll eat it, but I won't make it again.   Also, way too much topping with not enough zucchini, as the topping takes up 3/4 the height of the dessert.

This is not the zucchini cobbler/crisp that I remember from when I was a child! It was too thick and had way too much butter. The topping didn't get doughy or crispy..just mushy. I definitely think that the zucchini should not be mixed with some of the topping b/c it made it too thick! I will definitely be asking my mom for her recipe!

I've made this twice and everyone has raved about it. Both times, I misread the recipe and used only 1/2 cup of butter in the crust (instead of 1 and 1/2 cups!). The crust on the bottom of the pan was perfect. The top was golden but dry and crumbly. However, everyone thus far has thought that's the way it's supposed to be on top... with ice cream it's great. So, if you wanna decrease the butter, that's a perfect option!

I thought this was just o.k. Per a previous comment, I think this recipe would work best with large size farm fresh zucchini. I usesd the typical zucchini you find in the grocery store. Mostly, I'm only giving it three stars because there was not nearly enough filling, and only using half the topping mix was still too much.

I've had such fun with this recipe for years. I never tell people what's in it until it is gone. I always just call it "cobbler". Everyone assumes apple.  They are always amazed.

wow! i cant believe how much it tastes like apples! I cut the recipe in half since it was just me and my boyfriend ...i think we finished half of it by ourselves! Next time I will add more zucchini's and cut them into bigger chunks. I added about 1/2 teaspoon salt, cut the sugar a little, and added more cinnamon and nutmeg. mmmmm delicious!

Using zucchini instead of apples works great in this incredible recipe. I made a lower carb version using ground pecans, almonds instead of flour and halved the butter. It was a big hit!

This recipe was good, but not GREAT. The only thing that makes this recipe "wow" is the fact that it's zucchini! You would NEVER know it was zucchini. But it definately is not a 5 star flavour!
