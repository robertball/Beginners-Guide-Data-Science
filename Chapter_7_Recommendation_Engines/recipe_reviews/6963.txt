I made this recipe without the use of a bread machine.  Leaving it rise 1 hour for the first rising, and after shaping, another hour, baking it for 33 minutes at 350 degrees and it was really good.  This was made in a Kitcheaid mixer with all the dry goods in first then the margerine, and the water last.  I left the machine run until it was entirely pulled together, about 6 minutes.  This was a real easy recipe taking no time at all, and oh so worth the time.  Yum.  Thanks.

This recipe looks fantastic.....I'm making it right now - but I'm going to also add 1/4 C GLUTEN for a better rise and fluffier bread. You can find gluten at any health store and some grocery stores in the baking isle where flour is. When you bake bread w/ 100% WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR, you're missing out on the gluten which is found in white flour....so it's best to add it for a nice fluffy high risen bread! Thanks for the recipe....also....*if I had honey* (which I'm out of!) I would omit sugar and replace w/ honey instead (same amts).  -Sharon

The first time I made this in my bread machine, it came out small and very dense. I tried it again using the whole wheat dough cycle. I kneeded it some when it came out and put it in a bread pan, let it rise till double in size. Forgot about it and it rose a LOT above the pan. Still came out very good, but way too tall to fit in the toaster!!! All my family loved it. I did add the 1/4 cup gluten flour also. I am going to try to make hamburger buns next. If you are going to eat bread, it must be 100% whole wheat or from what the nutritionists say, you are eating a slice of sugar. Thanks for the recipe.
6/11/07 I have been making this bread almost every day now. When I have all the ingred. out, I make bread baggies with all the dry ingredients in each baggies except for the flour. Now I only have to put the water in the bread machine, add the 3 cups flour, pour in my baggie of dry ingred., add butter, pop in the bread machine, set for ww dough and in two hours I can plop it in a bread pan, let it rise for about 45 min and bake at 350 for about 25--30 minutes. This is the only bread my 1-1/2 year old grandaughter wants to eat :) Gotta go make bread, thanks...
p.s. If you want to use honey, just don't add the sugar to the bread baggies and add it when you add butter:)

I tried this recipe (my first yeast bread - I used instant dry yeast) and it came out perfect and I didn't even use a bread machine. Just put all the ingredients in a bowl and kneaded. Allowed it to rise an hour, kneaded again, let it rise in a greased pan another hour, baked for 50 minutes and had the most glorious bread ever. It was soft and heavenly. Slicing it was a "moment". I don't know what took me so long to bake bread. The recipe was perfect, especially for a beginner like me.

Holy cow!  This is everything that whole wheat bread should be!  My only change was to use butter instead of margarine, and I added 1/4 C vital wheat gluten, per other reviewers.  It is SO light and fluffy.  Delicious!

I cheated the first time I made this, and used 2 cups of whole wheat flour, and 1 cup of unbleached white.  It  was so delicious, I have not tried it any other way, nor have I made any other kind of bread in my machine.  It's moist, light, and slices great for toast and sandwiches.  My 3 year old loves it.  You have to try this one!!!

This is by far the best whole wheat bread. My family loves it, down to my 2-year-old grandson. I do add one TB of wheat gluten; have tried it without the gluten, so I know it turns out better with it.

I usually do wheat bread with only 1/3 whole wheat flour, because I don't like whole wheat bread that much, but this bread was excellent.  It isn't too dense, and it is quite moist.  I make bread a few times a week, and my husband said this is the best I have ever made.  I made it by hand: proofed the yeast, let rise 1 1/4 hours, then formed into loaves and let rise about 45 minutes. Baked on 350 for 30 minutes.

It may be the baker here :), but this turned out really dense.  I was going to use it for sandwiches, but it was not the right texture.  May try again...

Finally a 100% Whole Wheat Bread that isn't heavy like a brick. Read the reviews for tips and used the 1/4 cup of 2% milk and only 1 cup of water as I don't use the milk powder.  Also used honey to replace the sugar.
Used my KitchenAid.  Put in flour, then salt in one area and yeast in the other then honey.  Poured water on top. Used mixer paddle until dough came together. Switched to kneading hook and kneaded for 2 minutes.  Let rest for 5 minutes then needed again for 3 minutes.  Shaped into a ball on counter, placed in slightly oiled bowl with cover and let rise in oven with light on for 1 hour.  Rolled out to 9x15" and rolled from short end up.  Pinched seams and ends. Put in 9X5 non stick loaf pan and let rise lightly covered for 1 hour. Baked at 350 for 25 minutes.
Absolutely perfect. High, light, not too "wheaty" tasting.  Brushed the top with a little olive oil for looks. Never cared for Whole Wheat Bread but this recipe is dynamite.  I use regular Robin Hood Whole Wheat Flour.  No need for special bread flour for this recipe.
AMAZING!!!  Thanks so much to poster and to those who  offer helpful reviews/tips/alternatives.

I don't have kids, so, I can't rate that category, but, this bread is very delicious.  It doesn't always rise correctly, but, it always tastes great.  Everyone who has tried it loves it, too.

Excellent, but I substituted honey for the sugar and olive oil for the margarine.  I also added some Italian herbs and gave it a great flavor!!

Very easy! Healthy too. I didn't have the dry milk powder, so I used low fat milk instead of water. Perfect.

This was one of the best whole wheat recipes I have made.  My kids were not to fond of it though they prefer a lighter bread.  next time I will add some white flour as well.

I made this with the exact ingredients listed and threw them into my bread machine, set it to the whole wheat setting, and it came out great. First time making any bread in the bread machine that didn't turn into a rock. I didn't add gluten (although I might at some point). Great texture and moistness.

The concept was good. But, I kept asking myself how is this going to rise without any white flour? Wheat bread recipes always use a mix of both. I have heard on here that something called "vital wheat gluten" could be used in place of the gluten in white flour, although I have not tried that method. I tried though despite my thoughts. I had some excellent yeast, that I used the day before, so that was not the problem. But, as I expected it didn't rise an inch! And, it broke a part on my bread machine because it was so tough, because it wouldn't rise. Most of the reviewers who had success did what I thought and added the white flour and reduced the wheat flour, to make the 3 cups.

I grind my own red wheat for breads and such. It is well to note that freshly ground wheat flour doesn't have any of the preservatives that flours bought in the grocery usually do. Even with the preservatives, flour can go rancid, so it's best kept in the refrigerator or freezer.  Make sure to let any flour come to room temperature before using in recipes.   Also make sure you take the temperature of the water or liquid you use with any recipe that calls for yeast - to hot or too cold and you won't get optimum results. And note the expiration date on yeast!  This is a great recipe that, if the above precautions are taken, turns out good every time.

I LOVED this recipe.  I did it all by hand (no bread machine or mixer), and it took me 2 tries to get it right, but it turned out really good eventually.  If you also need to do it by hand, click here to see my adaptation of it: http://www.southbeach-diet-plan.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=743538

I have never been able to make bread!  Even with a bread machine. And I love good bread. 
I followed TajMomHal's suggestion.
I put all the dry ingredients into my Hamilton Beach Mixer. Instead of sugar I used Splenda. I added 1/4 cup Wheat Gluten.  Added the marjorine and the water. Let rise for an hour.  Then let it rise for another hour and baked for 33 minutes at 350 degrees. 
I thought it might be a fluke that it turned out so good, but this is my second loaf. This is fantastic.  Thank you so much for this recipe. 
My family loves it.

One of the best bread machine recipes out there!  Turned out great!  I cooked it in the oven.  350 degrees for 30 minutes.

This bread was the most dense I've ever made, and I use my bread maker regularly.  Disappointed!  Guess I'll stick with the "whole wheat honey" bread recipe on this site.  The loaf come out twice as big as this one.

Perfect whole wheat bread!  I just substituted the milk with vital gluten and let it rise twice, then baked in the oven at 350 for 30 min.  I make it twice a week and it never fails.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Doubled and made in the kitchen aid. Let knead for 7 minutes on medium. Did need all the flour. Next time I'll do this at 1.5 the size since it really warmed up the kitchen aid with the big dough and I'll make it in an 8x4 and a 9x5 instead of two 9x5's. Thanks!

Moist, dense, and delicious. I didn't use a bread machine though, I let the dough rise for an hour after kneading and half an hour after shaping and baked it at 350 F for 35 minutes.

I made this without a bread maker, instead used my kitchen aid. I added 1 1/2 Tbsp wheat gluten. I first heated the milk, butter and sugar to 110 degrees. Put the milk mixture in  mixer with 1 cup w.w. flour, and the yeast, mix with a whisk until incorporated. Add the salt and mix a bit more. Than add the last 2 cups w.w. wheat flour, and the 1 1/2 Tbsp gluten, and the dry milk. Put on the mixer, run to incorporate, and then to kneed, approx 6 min. Take out, spray bowl with Pam, put dough back in bowl, spray dough with Pam, cover with kitchen towel. Let sit approx an hour. Punch down. Kneed by hand, just a bit, shape into loaf shape. Spray loaf pan with Pam, add dough, spray dough with Pam again, cover with towel again. Let rise another hour, put into a 350* oven for 25-30 min. Take out of bread pan right away and let cool on a rack. Very good. Wanna make with honey next time. This is a very light and delicious w.w. bread. Hope these directions help.

This was excellent once I made a few modifications. I replaced 1/4 cup flour with vital wheat gluten, as others suggested. I also used organic butter instead of margarine. I will definitely make this again with the changes I made. I also want to try to substitute the dry milk power for whole milk and honey instead of white sugar.

FIRST TIME I TRIED IT, I MADE BUNS - I ADDED 1/4 CUP GLUTEN AND FOUND THEM DRY.  RE-TRIED TODAY MAKING BREAD AND SUBBING OLIVE OIL FOR MARG, HONEY FOR SUGAR AND REPLACING 1/4 CUP FLOUR WITH GLUTEN - TURNED OUT EXCELLENT!

Really good and not dense at all for being 100% whole wheat! I made this the traditional way and added 1 1/2 Tbsp. vital wheat gluten to aid in the rising process. I dissolved the yeast in the water for 10 min. (until yeast bubbles to the surface), then added the sugar, salt (only 1 tsp. to cut the sodium), butter, wheat gluten, dry milk powder, and 1 1/2 c. whole wheat flour. I then added the flour 1/2 c. at a time, then turned dough out onto my floured counter-top and kneaded for about 10 min. (dough was stiff to work with). I let it rise for 1 hr., punched it down, rolled it out and rolled up jelly roll style, put it in a prepped pan, and let it rise for another hour. Baked in a pre-heated 350 F. degree oven for 35 min., and rubbed the top with a tad bit of butter right after pulling it from the oven to keep the crust soft. EXCELLENT is all I can say. :)

This is a fantastically, easy, and delicious whole wheat bread recipe.  I gauge the 100% part by the grams of fiber.  I like to have 4g. or more, and this comes pretty darn close!

I didn't have dry powdered milk, so I did 1/4 cup milk with 1 cup water. I melted the butter in the water and milk, then whisked it all into the mixed dry ingredients by hand. Without a bread machine, I found 35 minutes at 350 to be just right. Also remember to grease and dust your bread pan with flour so it comes out of the pan perfectly! I agree with one hour to rise, then knead and one more hour to rise in the bread pan. Mmm! This bread is light and delicious, and perfect for sandwiches since it isn't too sweet (no honey). I loved it hot out of the oven, drizzled with olive oil. :) The best wheat bread I've made!

P.S. After having made this bread several times now, I have two last comments: if you're baking with a regular bread pan, I would up the "servings" to 16 to get sandwich-sized slices. I've also tried 100% whole wheat as compared to half-and-half, and I prefer using some white flour. It comes out so much fluffier! It's still our favorite weekly bread!

We have no breadmaker! Also, we have no powdered milk! We had to make some minor modifications! 

So with a splash of milk instead of the powdered variety, melted butter, and two hour-long rising sessions followed by 25 minutes at 350 degrees, this turned out perfectly. Very very simple and tasty!

It's got a light texture and is everything I've been looking for in a whole wheat bread!

This is a great recipe.  I make is weekly now and use it for sandwich bread.  I substitute olive oil for the butter and add 1 TB vital wheat gluten.  Sometimes I sprinkle in a tablespoon flax seeds as well.  While the bread is warm, I brush the top lightly with olive oil to keep the crust soft.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a very good recipe, What I did was added splenda instead of sugar, I added 2 tsp of yeast and proofed it first.  I find proofing the yeast makes the bread a little lighter.

This bread is going to replace my store-bought bread. I actually like that it's dense, as it keeps me full.  I left out the sugar and added a 1/2 cup of flaxseed.  Very nice!

I really loved this recipe.At first I was worried when it looked like it wasn't going to rise all the way but then I figured out-it's about a 1 lb loaf recipe. It came out really great. The ingredients were the sinmplest recipe I had found. I did use brown sugar instead of white and conola  soft margarine. the old recipe I use to use called for honey and molasses. This I figured has less calories. It is a really light and non-bitter wheat bread.

I'm not sure what happened when I tried this recipe.  It rose well and looked perfect, but collapsed in baking.  I couldn't eat it.  I need to try it again and see if I messed up with an ingredient.

I really like this bread. I thought I'd have to be giving the recipe an unfavorable review, after trying 2ce and having utter failures. Then I discovered that our yeast was old, and should have been kept refrigerated. So I tried again, with new yeast. Excellent results. I did modify the recipe slightly: I used 1/2c white flour and 2 1/2c of whole wheat (based on some other reviewer's comments). I also used approximately 1/4c of Sugar Cane Syrup, reducing the water by the same amount and the sugar to 1/2 of what the recipe calls for.

Wonderful!  I let the bread machine do the work and I then baked this in the oven.  (I like bread better that way.)  I've been looking for a 'soft' 100% whole wheat recipe and NOW I've found it.  Thank you!

This is a great recipe! Makes a small & yummy loaf. I did not add the powdered milk & used butter instead of margarine & added some flax seeds. Set my bread machine for a light crust & used the 1.5 lb express bake setting. Fresh bread in an hour!

This bread is amazing in my book. I did NOT alter the recipe at all... except for the fact that I used the dough setting on my bread machine and then baked it in my own pan in the oven! It is the softest 100% whole wheat bread I've ever made, without adding white flour or extra gluten! I'm super impressed. I've made it twice now. Once as hoagie rolls and just now as a loaf. It's a keeper!!

I love this bread!!  I do use 1/2 regular whole wheat flour and 1/2 white whole wheat flour, but that is just my preference.  I like to use my bead maker for dough, but prefer to bake in the oven.  Thanks to the other reviewer who mentioned to let it rise for 45 minutes, then bake for 25-30 mins at 350.

I have tried MANY whole wheat recipes and this is, by far, the very best.  Nice and moist with a great taste and better yet I can make it in my bread machine.  Thank you so much !!!!!!!!!

I love the texture and moistness of the bread, but I could taste the salt.  Maybe I mis-measured, but will make with less next run.  I am enjoying a chicken sandwich on it now!

the only change I made was 1 cup white bread flour and 2 cups whole wheat instead of the 3 whole wheat.  I also used butter instead of margarine.  Turned out perfect!!

I'd give this a 3 1/2 stars, it is easy to prepare but DRY.  Not a lot of flavor unless warm.

The heading for this recipe says this bread isn't hard. Not sure whether that refers to the difficulty level of the recipe, or the texture of the final product, but it's true either way. I am a complete bread novice, and I don't have a bread machine, so I followed the steps outlined in the "Baking Yeast Breads" article on this site. It was very simple to do, although the hand-kneading process required adding a lot of additional flour, which may have made the bread denser than it would have been otherwise. Still, my first-ever loaf of bread  came out soft, chewy, and delicious. I'm delighted1

This was decent enough, but it didn't rise very much for me. I used the dough cycle on my bread machine, then put it in a bread pan and let it rise for about 45 minutes, then baked at 350 for about 35 minutes. It could be that not making it fully in the bread machine is the reason it didn't turn out as well for me. I would like to try using vital wheat gluten with this recipe, so I will try it again!

This is a fool-proof awesome recipe for wheat bread. It's light and very tasty. In a pinch, I've used 2 cups of whole wheat flour plus 1 cup of bread flour and it's also turned out well. Forgiving and easy!

This recipe was PHENOMENAL!    I have to admit that I was a little hestitant in using all 3 cups of whole wheat flour as I was concerned about the density of the bread.  Nonetheless, it turned out great and my family has really enjoyed this bread recipe.  It's much better than any store-bought wheat bread I've ever had!  I made this using our bread machine on the dough setting.  Once that was complete, I shaped the dough and placed it in a bread pan, allowing it to rise for 45 minutes.  I then baked it in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.  Is there a better smell in the house than fresh baked bread?!?!?! :)  Side Note:  I followed the suggestion of adding 1/4 cup of vital wheat gluten.

Added 1/4 cup gluten as suggested by other reviewers.  Great bread, makes great toast.  It rose about 3/4 the size of a regular loaf, but wasn't too dense.

I don't have a bread maker but found this bread recipe to be one of the simplest I've ever followed and the first whole wheat recipe to work perfectly. I doubled the recipe for two bread pans, but only used 5 cups of flour instead of 6. It seemed that less flour kept the dough light and elastic so that I didn't have to add gluten. I also used butter and grated it cold. I let the dough rise two hours until it filled a large bowl, then let it rise about 1/2 hour again in the pans, then put it in a cold oven and baked it at 350 for about 20 minutes. It's so good!!! Thank you, Flute, for a delicious recipe!

Somewhat dense, but tasty, and better than store bought.  Followed other reviewers suggestions and addes 1/4c gluten. I also don't have a bread maker so I let my Kitchenaid mixer do the work with kneading, as suggested by another reviewer and also let it rise 1hr after kneading, then another hr after shaping; and baked for 35 mins @350.

Is it just me? I cannot figure out how to make this bread rise. It's just awful. It doesn't even fill the bread pan of the bread machine after hours of rising. I'm disappointed. I want this to work. I tried gluten like other reviews said, I've tried it all. It's just a small hard loaf. :(

I kind of used this recipe as a starting point and then went on to create a masterpiece!  I also used the link anonymous cooker shared for making the bread by hand to give me additional guidance.
Also I made 2 loaves. Here's what I did.
I heated 2 1/2 cups milk in the microwave for 3 minutes to 115 degrees Fahrenheit.  While that was warming, I whisked 6 cups of sifted whole white wheat (sometimes called pastry flour) flour with 1 tablespoon salt and 6 tablespoons vital wheat gluten.  Then to the milk I added 1/4 cup grapeseed oil, 1/4 cup molasses and 2 packages Hodgson Mills yeast (especially for whole grains).  I mixed it up with a spoon and watched it until I saw bubbles then I poured it into the dry ingredients.  After I mixed it thoroughly, I dumped it onto the counter and kneaded it for 10 minutes.  I placed it in a lightly oiled bowl and put a damp paper towel on top.  I put the bowl in the oven which was somewhere around 150 degrees Fahrenheit.  I let it rise until it was double (about an hour).  I punched it down and kneaded it 35 times and divided it between my 2 loaf pans and returned it to the oven for about an hour (until the dough was doubled and about 2 inches above the top of the pan).  Then I removed the damp paper towel, turned on the oven to 350 and let the loaves bake until dark brown, about 1/2 hour.  Superb!

Great recipe, however I do not have a bread maker - I gave it away because it never worked at high altitude - 8,300 ft. I also substituted 1/3 cup flour with glutton, the sugar with sucanat and the oil with coconut oil. It turned out wonderful, and actually has been the BEST bread recipe I have ever made.

This is a tasty bread, but not quite what I was looking for.  I made it the first time as written, and wasn't thrilled with the rise or the flavor. So as suggested by some reviewers, I swapped out 1/4 cup of honey for the sugar and added an additional 1/4 cup of flour to pull the dough together. I added 4 tsp of gluten to aid in rising, and this bread still won't rise high enough to use for sandwiches.  It's also a bit dense for my taste.  My search for a fluffy wheat bread continues.....

Ok if you don't have a REALLY good bread machine beware!  This dough was SO solid it sounded like it was ripping the "heart" out of my new $500 professional grade bread machine!  It was having SUCH a hard time mixing it that I unplugged it immediately and threw the chunk of "cement" away.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  I will not try this again!

EUREKA!!!  I bake a lot of bread, and am trying to move my family to 100% whole grains.  This recipe works!  I added 1/4 cup vital gluten, and the loaf rose beautifully.  I mixed it in my bread machine on the dough cycle, then put it in a stoneware pans for a second rise and to bake.  It is lovely and tastes great.  Thanks!

Well My second go round of baking this bread came out much better.. I added 3 teaspoons of Gluten, this time it did rise but did not come out pretty like a loaf of bread is suppose to.. It does taste very good and I will make this recipe again.

I tried this recipe today with no bread machine or mixer or anything...just my hands. The loaf came out delicious. My picky children loved it, and my husband who hates wheat bread from the store loved it too. I was very surprised. Thank you for sharing.

I've been having trouble with 100% whole wheat bread recipes but this rose beautifully and is light.  I'm impressed.  I don't have a bread machine but the food processor worked just fine.

This was an easy recipe to follow,but the bread didn't rise right. It kind of fell and got a hard crust on it. My husband loved it though.

This recipe did not rise in my bread machine therefore it came out very heavy and dense.  Don't think I will make it again!

Mixed the ingredients in a ninja dough mixer until it was all pulled together, about 3 minutes. Substituted 1/2 cup soymilk for the dry milk and reduced water to 3/4 cup. Raised for 1 hr then punched down and formed in bread pan. Raised 1 hour then baked at 350 degrees f for 30 minutes.
It was delicious and perfect carb balance for two type 2 diabetics and 1 type one with a milk allergy. Great recipe with no white flour added.

I make this recipe all the time now and add a tsp of flax seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seads and poppy seads and my husband and I just love it. I use the mixer to mix and bake it in the oven at 350 for 30 min. That way you don't end up with holes in the bottom of your bread from the bread maker.

Light and fluffy?  More like a 5# brick!  I've been baking bread since the early 90's so this is not my first loaf.  

I've gone on the South Beach diet recently and wanted to make a 100% whole grain bread.  This recipe sounded good.  Well it's not which was apparent the moment the kneading got under way.  It was just a big clump.  I nearly doubled the amount of water to the mix and that turned out to still be insufficient.  I've put a picture of what this looked like coming from the bread machine also.  

It was horrifically dense (despite using the vital wheat gluten as others suggested) and it didn't even taste good.  Simply not enough liquid in it.  I would make with caution especially if using a bread maker.

I don't have a bread maker, so I made this recipe the traditional way. My bread came out soft and airy. I used 2 cups whole wheat and 1 cup all purpose flour. Very good whole wheat bread recipe. Definitely will be making again. However, I personally like my bread a little sweeter, so next time I make this I'll substitute 2tbsp brown sugar for the 1 1/2 tsp white sugar.

I just received my very first bread machine, a sunbeam.  I'm waiting for my cookbook to come with it so I searched for a simple whole wheat recipe.  This receipe fit the bill and is absolutely delicious.  The only difference was I substitued 1/4 cup of milk for the powdered milk and only put in 1 cup of water.  (I had no powdered milk).  For anyone looking for whole wheat, this recipe is great!

I wanted to make this South Beach appropriate. SMade by hand. I wanted to use one kilo of flour, so calculated to 33 servings. Used canola oil in place of margarine, one cup of soy milk in place of the powdered milk and one of the cups of water, and used liquid sucralose in place of the sugar.  Proofed the yeast with the remaining warm water and a tiny bit of brown sugar (so the yeast could grow), then added to the other ingredients. I needed to add extra flour, the dough was so sticky. Let dough rise twice, then shaped. Incredible texture - the lightest 100% WW I ever made. I like a sweeter flavor - honey would have been excellent - but it was really, really great. Will make again.

The best 100% whole wheat bread I have found.  To make it toast better I increase sugar to 3T.  To make it a bit softer I increase yeast to 2T and butter/margarine to 2T.

This has become my everyday bread; by far the best recipe I tried, though I also add the 1/4 cup of wheat gluten as recommended by one of the reviewers. It turns out soft and delicious every time. I also substitute canola oil for the butter (same measurement), and occasionally add sunflower or pumpkin seeds (pepitas). Wonderful for sandwiches, toasted, or just sliced thick to go with soup.

I don't own or use a bread machine. Made this whole wheat bread with a stand mixer and oven. I proof the yeast first, then combine all the ingredients and let stand for 20 minutes. I then do a quick mixer knead, oil the top and cover, and let it rise for four hours. Baked at 450 until golden brown. Flavor improves to store-bought with addition of 1-4tb of vital wheat gluten. No problems making it without a bread machine.

This was a tasty loaf, although mine fell a bit just as it was about to start the baking cycle. Just to mention that Whole Wheat Honey Bread on this site is also a pure w/wheat recipe and works incredibly well in the bread machine.

It came out wonderful, light, fluffy. I added ground golden flax and sunflower seeds for nutrition, substituted soy milk for powdered milk, soy margarine and added some honey. It was so good we ate it plain or with a little soy butter.  I've tried other whole grain and multi grain recipes which ended up hard or heavy. This one is a winner.

This is the best whole wheat bread recipe I've tried.  I prefer a loaf shape for easier sandwiches and French toast, so I used my bread machine's dough cycle, then turned the dough into a loaf pan.  I let it rise for an hour in a warm oven, then baked it at 350° for 45 minutes.  It rose and baked perfectly, wasn't flat or heavy at all - thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Seriously good bread.  I've made this twice so far.  Both times I added gluten so it wouldn't be dense as whole wheat bread can come out.  And the second time I replaced the sugar with honey.  That second time was beyond awesome.  I almost ate the whole loaf myself.  I spread peanut butter on top a slice and fell in love.

I bake artisan breads for a living in a wood fired brick oven.  But sometimes I like to use my inside oven.  I ground the wheat I used in this recipe, and did also add 1/4 cup vital wheat gluten per others suggestions. Other than that this is a very good recipe and turned out great.  Five Stars all the way--very easy recipe if one follows the instructions!

I didn't have any dried milk powder, so I used 1/2 cup soymilk and proofed my yeast with 3/4 cup of warm water. I made this by hand and it turned out great. It was a really quick bread recipe- a little heavy, but better than the too-squishy store bought bread. I'll be making this at least weekly now.

quite good-  even though my bread machine decided to go on strike.  i'd say this recipe is "foolproof" but after reading some 'expert' reviews, i'd have to retract that, lol.

i did add a touch more flour due to uncharacteristic high humidity in my area and i did add 1/4 C of VWG .  i think next time i might add a pinch more salt and an extra generous squeeze of honey because this bread was just a bit bland.       
all in all,  its a perfectly fine recipe and a good base recipe for tinkering with.

Very good bread.  I had some leftover in the coffee pot this a.m., so I used it in the place of the water.  I thought if it's good in pumpernickel, it's got to be good in wheat.  Also added about 1/4 cup sunflower kernels, 1 TB gluten.   Turned out nicely. makes wonderful toast.

Best loaf of whole wheat bread I've ever personally made.  It was delicious straight out of the oven (I used the machine for the dough cycle, then baked it at 350 for about 35 minutes) and it was delicious over the next couple of days as toast in the morning.  Still dense, but it was soft in the same respect.  I eliminated the milk powder since I didn't have any, added a bit more water as well as some wheat gluten.  Thanks, I'll be making this one again!

My husband loved it, and he eats about a loaf of this bread every week. I did add 1/4 cup gluten, and added the dry ingredients to the foamed yeast in my kitchen aid. I let the machine knead the dough for at least 5 minutes so it is light yet dense enough to use in sandwiches. The loaves do not rise very high though, but it's still very good. Thank you!

I just made this and and it was really good.  It didn't raise as much as I would have liked, but I don't always have the best luck.  It did taste great and wasn't as heavy as other wheat breads that I have tried. I used olive oil and 1/4 cup honey in place of the sugar and added some wheat gluten.  I always use my machine to mix dough and then bake in the oven.  I will definitely try this one again.

This recipe was so excellent.  It didn't rise as much as I thought it was going to, however the loaf is round enough to make great sandwiches!  I was so amazed at how moist and soft the bread was, it wasn't tough in the slightest!  I will definately be making this recipe again.  And the great thing is that I used vegan alternatives, and it still turned out PERFECT!

This bread was perfect. Considering it's made with 100% whole wheat flour, it's hard to believe it was so soft, light and fluffy with such a light crust.

Love this bread!  We don't eat many sandwhiched on bread, usually rolls, but I did make PB&J french toast with this and it was wonderful!  This is a great loaf you can throw together quickly to acompany dinner, we have it with homemade soup or pasta dishes often.  Thanks flute!

Excellent recipe. I baked this breadk tonight and it's all gone except for one slice.  My breadmaker tends to make the crust too hard for my family so I baked it in my bread machine on the basic bread cycle and took it out about 15 minute before the "buzzer" went off. It turned out excellent.

This recipe, no matter how delicious, is badly written.  My daughter is a novice baker and needed more instruction, such as rising time and baking temperature.  This read as not much more than a list of ingredients.

I have made this 10+ times with a stand mixer and in loaf pans in an oven.  I am new to bread baking and some of the loaves have been beautiful.  Some of the loaves have caved in and looked terrible!  But every loaf is delicious!          I have discovered:  1) If you use a food scale to measure, you probably need less water.   If you scoop the flour, you might need more water.  I use a food scale and set the recipe to 14 servings (420 grams of flour) and use 315 grams of water.  This seems to be a good ratio of flour to water for my pans, measuring method and climate.         2) It REALLY helps to mix the dough by hand and let it sit and absorb the water for 30-45 minutes.  After that, I kneed it with a dough hook in the stand mixer on medium speed for 8 minutes.        3)  Size matters when it comes to bread pans!  My smaller, glass Pyrex pan produces very pretty loaves.  My favorite Pampered Chef, larger, stoneware pan produces delicious, but ugly looking loaves.    4)  Proper shaping of the loaf really matters!  I made some really homely flat loaves when I just plopped the dough in the pan.  :)  Watch a few YouTube videos on shaping the loaf.
              I have looked at all of the whole wheat recipes on the King Arthur website and can't bring myself to use that much honey... so this recipe has been my go-to recipe!

This is a really good whole wheat recipe. I have made some changes to it, but the basic recipe is still good. I lightly spoon the flour into a measuring cup and scrape across the top with a knife so that there is not too much flour in the dough. I add two tablespoons of gluten to the flour to help it rise. I also use honey instead of sugar, and oil instead of margarine. I have made this using molasses too. I have also added raisins and cinnamon for a whole wheat raisin loaf. This recipe has turned me off white flour entirely!

The first time I tried this recipe, the flavor was great!  However, the texture didn't quite come out as I had hoped it would. With some changes, I think my second batch will turn out better:

3 tbsp of oil instead of margarine
3 tbsp of sugar
3 tsp of yeast
1/4 of gluten
No milk, and more water - about 1 1/2 c of water or so total. This gave the bread dough the texture I was expecting. I'll know soon how it baked.

Kudos to the original poster for getting a great flavor!  I had to veganize it; hence the no-milk, but with some tweaking I think this recipe will work out great in my particular bread machine. Thanks!

Was good w/ a few changes, did not use dried milk because I never have it, substituted water with milk.  First loaf was WAY too salty, cut back to 3/4 tsp.  Now its great.

I made the original recipe and although it is good, I made a few changes. I use 1/4 cup of honey to replace the sugar. I use 1 1/2 TBS canola oil to replace the margarine and I add 1/4 cup of vital wheat gluten. I use the dough cycle and shape and let rise in a 9x5 loaf pan and bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes.

Great recipe!  I've tried other 100% whole wheat bread recipes without much success.  These loaves were light and delicious!

I read other reviews and since I didn't have gluten I also mixed some bread flour in with the whole wheat flour (1/3 bread flour and 2/3 whole wheat).  

Also, I don't have a bread machine so I mixed everything in my stand mixer with dough hooks and then finished kneading by hand.

Sprinkled tops of loaves with wheat bran and toasted wheat germ, which added a nice touch.

Bread raised well and made beautiful loaves.  Doubled the recipe and gave one loaf to a friend.  Got a text from her saying she loved it.

Overall, this was very good.  I doubled the recipe and made in my Bosch Universal mixer.  I used WW Bread flour and found that I achieved better results with that than just straight WW flour.  I used honey instead of the sugar and butter instead of margarine.  Oil could probably be added instead with satisfactory results.  I made part rolls and part loaves and they were all great.  It was moist and a little dense, but not dry  or gluey.  My husband is not a fan of WW bread and he ate this without complaining too much.  Brush the tops of bread or rolls with melted butter as soon as they come out of the oven to make them even more soft and moist.

I had to adjust the yeast down to 1/4 teaspoon, to keep it from falling in the middle of the loaf, since I use bread machine yeast.  It makes a dense loaf of 100% whole wheat bread, so yes, this recipe does work, but I do believe that truly whole wheat bread is an acquired taste.  I can see now why most people usually only use 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of regular flour when they make "whole wheat" bread.  This 100% whole wheat bread does not taste very good at all.  In fact, after I use up my one sack of whole wheat flour I plan on going back to using nothing but regular flour for my bread machine bread from now on.  If I'm going to go to all the trouble to make my own bread, I want it to taste yummy.

I gave the recipe 3 stars because once you adjust the yeast to suit your needs, it actually does work.  You will get a loaf of 100% whole wheat bread.  It's just a shame that it doesn't taste very good.  At least not to me.  Everyone has different tastes, and some people may love this bread.  I had my brother try some and he didn't like it either.

This bread came out amazing!  I have never had such success with 100% whole wheat.  I subbed molasses for the sugar and coconut cream powder for the nonfat dry milk powder (I just didn't have any powdered milk) and it came out BEAUTIFULLY!

A good wheat bread that doesn't need buttermilk (we were out, my husband's favorite recipe on this site is the oatmeal wheat buttermilk bread).  My husband didn't get to try any of this, so we'll have to make it again and adjust per his review.  I used two cups wheat flour, one bread flour.  Nice crust too.

Consistency of the bread is solid. While in the abm, the top of loaf fell, but otherwise perfect all around.  Excited this is a simple straightforward recipe that does not ask for all purpose flour.  Way to go.

I thought this was very good.  It turned out great in bread machine, with a crispy outer crust and soft center.  My family enjoyed the dense consistency, and my kids had no idea it was good for them!  I think it would also be good to add some cinnamon!!  I also used Splenda instead of sugar.

I tweaked this a little. I used:

1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/4 c. gluten
3 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 tablespoons honey
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
1 1/4 cups warm milk

This is the first loaf of bread I've ever made, and it was great. The only change I'll make next time is I will use the light crust setting. (I set it on medium crust the first time.)

Soft and tender slices.  Did use 2 c. ww flour and 1 c. white flour.  Used honey instead of sugar.  Will make again.  Great toasted also.

Very nice results without honey.  I also added wheat gluten (1 TBSP) with good results.

This recipe baffles me. There is nothing in it to help the bread to turn out light, nothing in it to avoid the dense loaves that are common with homemade 100% whole wheat bread. Most people used gluten, but even though I did, mine just doesn't rise high enough or turn out light enough. I have tried increasing the yeast amount and other things (I also proofed my yeast.) I use fresh ground white whole wheat. I really liked it the first time, and have made it several times, but I just wish it would rise HIGHER and have more appeal once the "fresh out of the oven" appeal is gone. My boys eat this all right, but even though they only eat whole wheat bread, this is not their favorite.

A wonderful 100% whole wheat bread. I do use 1/4 cup of wheat gluten and 1/4 cup of honey, since I prefer my wheat bread a bit sweeter. I use the dough setting on my bread machine~remove and shape into loaf in 9x5 bread pan,let rise and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. My husband loves this bread and he is not a big fan of whole wheat bread. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

VERY good 100% whole wheat bread!  I baked mine in the oven (375 for 25 minutes) after processing it in my bread machine and it turned out great EVEN when I once forgot to add 1/4 cup vital wheat gluten!  This one's a keeper :)

This worked perfectly in my bread machine.  The only changes I made:  I used full-flavored molasses rather than sugar and, of course being from Wisconsin, butter. Oh yeah, I also added whole flax seeds.  There, I'm done.

I made this bread  tonight and it was delicious. I’m so happy to have been able to find a true whole wheat bread recipe.   I used the bread machine to make the dough and then allowed it to rise after being formed for half an hour. I then baked it at 350 degrees for 33 minutes as suggested by member TAJMOMHAL. Thank you so much for posting.

I loved the way this bread turned out. I have made whole wheat in my bread maker before but did not like the results. This recipe turned out almost perfect, the only thing I am going to try next time is reducing the salt by a 1/4 tsp.

I made it without bread machine. I used cinnamon sugar instead of white sugar and the result is better taste and smell. It's subtle but you can taste it. I used more or less 250 F and after 40 minutes or so it was ready. (But better check it in 30 minutes to make sure). This is only my first try. Thanks to God, it succeeded. Yummy!

It had a rising issue where a big gas bubble formed and created in even rising at the top. Looks nice but I expected the white whole wheat flour to produce a whiter bread. Used olive oil instead of margarine in recipe

Great recipe.  I only had 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour plus 1 1/2 cups Montana all-purpose flour (high in protein).  I used oil instead of margarine and  1/4 cup milk combined  with water to equal the required liquid.  I used the dough setting and let dough rise before putting in the oven at 360* for 35 minutes.  The bread was delicious with a wonderful crust.  Yes, I made changes but fully expect to get closer to the original recipe with good results.

This turned out wonderfully!  I did have to swap out low fat milk for the water and dry milk.    I also used 2 cups whole wheat flour and one cup bread flour to lighten it up.  Since I do not use margarine, I used butter.  It was delicious!

Only changes I made was I used 2 1/2 cups brown flour, and 1/4 cup white, 1/4 cup chia seeds.
I always use lard or shortening instead of butter but would like to try coconut oil next time.  
I let bread maker mix dough, let it rise, than reset it and let bread maker mix it again, than took dough out and divided into 2 loaves, let it rise in baking pan, baked 1/2 hr on 350.  Easy to slice and was so moist and good.  
Can't go wrong with this recipe.

This was the first recipe I made in my old new breadman that I bought from a garage sale. I can't imagine having one and never even using it! It was so easy to make this bread and I am excited to try out more.

I always use the dough cycle because I don't like the way my bread machine bakes. Just as well with this recipe, when the cycle was finished I had a dough which had harder clumps stuck to it. I put it in a bowl and added a little more water to make a cohesive dough and then shaped, proved and baked as normal. It has just occurred to me that this could be due to the difference in UK flour although it's never happened to me before. So I'm rating this a 4 instead of a 3 as I first intended. I did end up with an excellent loaf of bread which also makes great toast. I've also learnt a valuable lesson, to check on the dough when it's in the breadmaker instead of  just letting it run. Thankyou Flute.

I used the oven because I don't have a bread machine. I took the advice of another reviewer. Let it rise for 1 hour and then kneaded it placed it in the loaf pan and shaped it to fit and let rise for about 45 min and then baked. Very happy with it. Simple recipe. It might have to grow on you if you are not used to eating whole wheat but that is what we always eat so we enjoyed it. I will make it again.

Forgot to mention that I used the bread machine dough setting not the complete cycle since I have very poor luck with that.  Just took it out,kneaded about 1 minute with oiled hands (so as not to put more flour in), put in greased pans and let rise till about 1 to 2 inches above pan (rose higher in the oven) and baked at 375 in glass pans for about 35 minutes (till bread sounds hollow when tapped lightly.  Removed immediately from pan and covered with cloth for 15 minutes or so and then spread small amount of butter on top.  Couldn't wait to try it and sliced it warm....yummy!  Makes good sandwich bread.  DH had peanut butter and jam sandwich while still warm :)

Not impressed with this bread at all.  I followed the instructions but it just did not seem to rise well at all. (even with allowing extra time)  May be its something I did wrong, not sure.  Will not be baking again.

Very nice, mine fell a little, but maybe because I peeked! Very nice flavor and texture. It disapeared in a hurry.

I used 1 1/4 C of warm 1% milk 2.Used 2 1/4 c whole wheat flour(all I had) and 1 C bread flour 3. replaced white sugar with brown sugar 4. used dough cycle, let rise 1 hr, then baked about 37 mins @ 350. Thanks will make again and again

This fabulous!  Easy to double and it freezes really well!  If you don't have a bread machine  make sure you knead it really, really well.  Also, make sure you let it rise long enough (45 minutes - 1 hour).  I was in a hurry once and put it in too soon and it split a little on the side.  Still was yummy, just not as pretty!  I also add Gluten and I also add ground up flax seeds.  Thanks!

Very nice ww bread.  I added 3 tbs of vital wheat gluten to help it rise.  I used the dough only feature of my bread machine then placed in a loaf pan to rise and bake.  I didn't let it rise too much; I have a tendency to forget and let  my loaves over rise a bit, so I kept an eye on it. I baked it when it had risen out to the sides of the pan and a bit over the pan.  I baked at 375 for about 45-50 minutes; this time and temp seems to work best with my oven.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best Whole Wheat Bread recipe I've found so far. First time to try - I substituted 1/4 c honey for the sugar, added 1/4 c gluten. Will try again.

This was my first ever bread machine loaf and it was perfect. I usually don't eat the heel but that was the best part! I will definitely be making this again.

This is only the 2nd recipe I've tried since getting a Sunbeam bread machine.  I rated it 3 stars because although the bread has a pleasant flavor and was easy to assemble, it is extremely dense.  I was expecting a lighter bread.  I sub'd olive oil for the margarine and added 1 Tbsp. of gluten. I used coarse kosher salt. I used the dough cycle to prepare the dough, then turned it out onto a greased countertop and let it sit for 10 minutes.  Then I put it in the greased bread pan and let it rise for an hour.  Then I baked it at 330 degrees (dark nonstick pan) for 30 minutes. It just never did rise very high. Since I'm new to breadmaking I'll probably try some more whole wheat recipes before I attempt this one again.

I don't know what happened. I followed this recipe to a "t" and my bread turned into a brick. It didn't rise at all.  I ended up trying this recipe a few more time, try various suggestions from reviews, and it still did not come out good. I won't be making it anymore.

Tried it, liked it. Didn't raise as well as I hoped and was denser than I hoped. Very good taste and simple to put together.

I didn't do this in a bread machine, and mine didn't turn out very dense at all. However, I made some changes that probably influenced my result. First, I used 1/2 T. gluten. I also replaced 1.5 c. whole wheat flour with 1 c. rye and 1/2 c. bread flour. I really like the moist and soft texture. Thanks Flute!

Mine turned out moist, but a little dense.  It was very good alone, but too overpowering for a sandwich.  My kids loved it!
