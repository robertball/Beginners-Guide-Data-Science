It was delish! I used a blood orange flavored olive oil instead of butter and golden raisins.  Also used half whole wheat flour and half white. The subtle flavor of the blood orange olive oil compliments the banana very nicely.
Will definitely make again, as Iâ€™m always looking for ways to use my sour dough starter.

The sourdough starter is what made me want to try this recipe.  I made the batter and baked it as muffins and waffles.  I reduced sugar to 3/4 cup since I prefer things a little less sweet.  Waffles  took  only 5 minutes and  came out great.  I baked muffins at 375 for 27 minutes.   My husband especially liked the muffins.  I thought the interior  could have been cooked a bit more, so next time I will reduce the oven temperature to 350 and bake them for 30 minutes.  This is definitely a keeper.  I look forward to trying this recipe with nuts and cranberries next time.   Thanks for a great recipe.
