I really hate to say it, but this really isn't at all what I ate as a child with my highly-traditional Irish Catholic family. Unfortunately, the family's recipe has since been lost... just a friendly suggestion if you want to tweak this recipe... you should add about a tsp. of baking soda, at least a tsp. of salt (pepper optional), and quite possibly, depending on your taste, some fresh, chopped green onions or chives. Serve with LOTS of butter! :) Oh, and don't use olive oil for frying... use canola or vegetable oil. Irish food isn't supposed to be slimming! ;) Hope I didn't offend anyone.....

Crisp on the outside. Tender on the inside. MMMMM! To make these up faster for a brunch, I par-poiled the shredded potatoes for 3 minutes in a big pot of water, then drained well before mixing with the rest of the ingredients. This way, I could cook them for a shorter time at a higher temp, so they were even crispier. You have to dry this recipe for your next brunch!

OMG!!!  This Irish-Canadian gal loves her boxty..this is amasing!  I only used 2 tablespoons of oil and I made 12 mini-boxty and they all came out golden brown and soft.  Also I used spelt flour, I'm allergic to wheat (came out grand).  Fed them to my sister and she said they reminded her of Ireland.  We ate them with ketchup, but will definately come up with something a little more creative next time. Thanks!

This is awesome! My Dad used to make a variation of this. He would either use just mashed or just grated potatoes. He would actually use the rolling pin on the mashed to make potatoe pancakes, just like his Irish mother used to do. For the grated he would just squeeze them together and fry. Very different tastes and textures. Don't tell Dad, but this Irish Canadian likes this recipe the best!

My dad is from Ireland, and I wanted to make him something special for his 71st b-day.  He said it was a little different from what he remembers, but he did eat it.  He said that there were different kinds of boxty, and that his mother would make it as one big patty in the pan, and  then cut it up.  He also said he remembers her boiling it.  Thank you for allowing me to make my dad something to remind him of his youth!!

I used roasted garlic instant mashed potatoes and added a little onion and garlic pepper. Outstanding texture and flavor. Served with rotisserie roast pork and cole slaw - there wasn't any left :) thanks for the posting.

Not bad.  Very easy and has a nice texture.  Would like to try with some diced sauteed  onions in it.  Very traditional Irish recipe as is.  Served with butter on top and sour cream on the side.

We just made this recipe and it is good! I will definately make this again with all of my leftover mashed potatoes. The texture was great. I am going to try it with some onions, shredded cheese and diced ham as well.

This is also extremely Scotish as well as the little poem, both are in a 1937 school text book from Scotland from an elderly relative. Very exciting to find the recipe here, thanks for sharing.

This is good Boxty, but not great Boxty. It's too bland. My mom used to make this dish with grated onions added in, and fried in bacon grease.  that would be great Boxty.

I don't even have to make this recipe to know it is AWESOME. this is one of the first recipes i memorized as a kid.... 

Brooke, you just brought back a very fond childhood memory of my Grandmother and my Mom. 

My Grandmother and my Mom used to make these for us when we were kids. I read the recipe and it is the exact same thing... 

AMAZING! I love it!

Happy St Patrick's Day! Wooo Whoooo!

UPDATE!!!: I can't ever get my daughter to eat any kind of potatoes besides fries.... but I made boxty again tonight and she thought it was pancakes.... She ate at least five! I never told her it was potatoes but she loved it!!

I love this recipe. My husband and I both have Irish in our family (my great grandmother was irish but never met her). I wanted to cook something irish so I tried this and it was really good! My husband loved it too. I tried it regular, I've tried it with cheese and also tried it with garlic mashed potatoes.

I have been making this recipe for a couple years now for my Irish AND non-Irish family, and everyone seems to love it! I always serve it with ground beef (to crumble on top), chopped onions, and chicken gravy. I know the chicken gravy sounds wierd, but served with the ground beef and onions on the boxty, it is soooo good! I'll be making this for my grandkids!

Amazing! I actually wanted this because I went to a GREAT Irish Pub out in L.A. and I had lemon shrimp boxty! I recreated that meal by making the boxty crepe-like and putting lemon shrimp with sauce inside.... best thing EVER.

Yeah, I finally found a boxty recipe!!! My dad used to make these when we where little and we would bring a ton of them to the Irish American club on Sundays.  It would take us all morning to prepare them and they would be gone in a minute once we set them out.  Gotta love those hungry Irishmen.  He didn't used mashed potatoes though I don't think, as I was quite small at the time.  I do remember him adding grated onions to his though. Simply the best!!!  When I make them for my family we serve them with real butter and a dollop of our cream.. and a side of applesauce,  added some good bacon or sausage links and called it a meal.  The kids always got so excited when they heard we were having Boxty for dinner,  one of the few times (lol)  I could get them to help peel potatoes.  oooohhh I am getting so hungry for them now!!  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING!!!

I have tried several of the potato pancake/latke recipes.  This one is my favourite.  It's a great mix of mashed and grated potato, and I think the ratio of each is just right.  Quick to make, and adjustments can be made to suit your preferences, like adding spices/seasonings, or grated onion and minced garlic, which I have also done.  My husband devours them-never any leftovers. Thanks Brooke!

I have nary a drop of Irish in my veins, yet I think I made this pretty well!  I used mashed garlic potato flakes and everything else was the same in the recipe.  Fantastic!  My not-so-traditional St. Paddy's dinner turned out great!

This is very good, however, I added one med. grated onion, about 1 1/2 tsp. of kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, used 2 eggs because 3 large potatoes was more than 1 1/2 cups.  Served with sour cream and applesauce, it was yummy!

Mine came out fairly more like doughy pancakes than the crunchy hashbrown texture I was expecting. I think making these is very much like making pancakes - if you are good at making pancakes (I'm not) then you will have more success with these than I did.

I'm sure this recipe would be FANTASTIC if I had followed it correctly.  I tried to shortcut by using fresh refrigerated hashbrowns (Simply Potatoes) instead of grating the raw potato myself.  Yuck.  It turned out slimy, and then I had to dry the boxty out in a 350 degree oven.  My family still liked it, but go with the freshly grated potato!

I make this from leftover mashed potatoes.  I add onion salt, pepper, flour and an egg.  Mix all together and if it is too thick add a little half and half or milk.  I spray my skillet with pam and drop by the spoon full and fry until golden brown.  I serve it with butter and more salt and pepper if needed.  My aunt made this for me when I was a small child and I have always loved them.  I am now ready for my 50th wedding anniversary so I have been making them for a long while.  They are really good and gives another way to have potatoes.

Because of being orange Irish, I used pumpkin puree instead of the leftover mashed potatoes in this!  I chose to make these with rye flout.   I omitted the oil, frying on a pan that had been sprayed.  At first I thought them rather strange, but these are a comfort food, so I ended up really enjoying them!

No flavor, followed recipe to a tee. when the first batch turned out bad, I added a lot more seasoning, garlic powder, grated onion, pepper, it helped but i still didn't care for it.

These are very easy to make and very tasty. I substituted the skim milk with soy milk for a lactose-free version. They browned just fine with only a couple tablespoons of olive oil. Sometimes I mix in a little chopped green onion or herbs too.

Very good. Made this for lunch with leftover St. Patrick's day potatoes. I put a little sour cream and salsa on top and ended up with a very full belly! Will make this again for sure.

Not sure what I was expecting but these were not amazing. They were OK. I doubled the recipe, except for the oil, and fried them in a cast iron skillet. The outside texture was wonderful! The inside was kind of mushy. I made them for St. Patty's Day and if I make them again, it will probably be for that reason only.

Never heard of it before - thought I'd try it with this year's St-Paddy's day supper accompanying the Irish stew. I absolutely love potato latkes - this reminded me of them. It was good but lacked what latkes bring - the flavor of onion. Still, they were good - I'd do them again. To minimize burning the outside before the inside is done - it should say in the recipe at what temp to fry them at on the stove. Trial & error on my stove showed 3 min each side on medium (or just under).

I could taste a bit of the raw flour. I  wonder if this is because I had to double the recipe as I got a bit excited on shredding the potatoes in my new food processor and ended up w/ more than 1 1/2 cups.  I will reduce the flour a bit next time as the concept is very good

went by the recipe and the potato cakes are to heavy and bland.  Maybe next time will leave out the mashed potatoes and add some chopped onions for added flavor.

I doubled the batch and made about 10 large pancakes.  It did take a long time to make if you don't have instant mashed potatoes around, and mine were a little thicker than in the restaurant we had them in. We served them with a curry dish and got great reviews.

This took awhile to make because I didn't have the left over mashed potatoes but next time I do have left overs this is what I'll make with it! Very tasty and different than your average potato pancake.

I thought these were good and will make them again. I am Ukranian background and these reminded me of potato pancakes, which I love and find the potato pancakes on the lighter side as there is less flour in them than the Boxty; however, I will make the Boxty to have a traditional Irish meal on Saint Patty's Day or if I'm entertaining the Irish:) so I can serve the traditional meal. Thanks for the submission as I enjoy making and trying authentic receipes.

Delicious! Fried these up for my husband's organization as a "heritage night" food and they were eaten up! Tastes similar to hash browns..yum! My only suggestion would be to use a little more oil. By the time I got to the last few, it started smoking a bit because the oil had run out!

This was my first time making Boxty and it came out great! I elected to spice things up a bit more than the original recipe called for by adding some finely chopped green onions & garlic. I served them with some homemade honey-dijon sauce which was really good and I paired the Boxty with some oven-baked tilapia that I found the recipe for on Allrecipes.com...it was a wonderful St. Patty's Day dinner!!

Easy to make, especially if you use frozen shredded hashbrowns.  It could use something to add to the flavor, and that was after I added some onion powder.  Maybe some fresh onions or green onions would help. Will try next time.

It must have been too moist because it took a long time to get the pancakes  to stay together and finish cooking. But for a novice who never made it before and I combined a couple of recipes, it was worth the effort. But fine tuning in the future.

I thought it was really good! I had not had Boxty before, I know, what kind of Irishman am I?! I made fresh mashed, and didn't measure either them or the shredded, so I am unsure of the proper texture. They turned out fantastic anyway, a nice change from my usual diner hash browns.

A delightful meal accompaniment I did add some sweet onion and a dash of cayenne - my own preference. Very easy to make and went over well with the family. I'll make this again.

These were ok.  They tasted like a basic potato pancake.

I have made this a couple of times and it is great! I didn't change a thing to the recipe and will definitely make it again.
Thanks for the recipe!

Yuuuum! Our three year old's review: "this is my favourite food I've ever haaad." Nice and easy and tastey. We are a little sensitive to egg though, so used chia seed to supplement. We also had a TON of mashed left over so just used that instead. We had enough to make a double batch.  Excited to have this leftover recipie for regular future use! Thank you for sharing!!

Mine came out very heavy and greasy but tasted good.  Will I make them again?  Probably not.

This was a delicious recipe! It was fairly easy as well, so that's nice. Unfortunately, I made these for a party, so they were not super hot off the pan by the time everyone ate them, but I still only brought home a few. I will probably make them again.

We followed the recipe as written but added some grated onion and chopped chives. Good recipe, but next time we'll add less flour, as they were pretty heavy.

My kids loved them ... Me? I need some onion, cheese, or veggies in my potato pancakes but not fair to ding the recipe for that.  Not sure why I didn't envision them being so bland. I do like hash browns. I would make this again if I ever buy a mandolin.  Meanwhile, I recommend against making them w instant mashed and defrosted shred. Yes, a double shortcut but this was part of a huge meal so needed these quick.  My result 3 stars or less. Recipe 3-4 stars. Happy St Patrick's Day!!

My dad made these every Sunday morning to take to the Irish American club in Cleveland,Ohio. He would make them using 10 lbs of potatoes!!!  The club members would always look forward to Bernie Curleys Sunday morning Boxty!! RIP DAD WE MISS YOU

It is probably me... I can never get this Boxty/potato pancake thing down! Maybe it is because I use a non-stick pan instead of a skillet. Can never get it to brown nicely. So, if you are making this, use a skillet!

Easy to make and turned out well.  Flavor is just okay.  Needed more salt to bring it up a bit on the flavor scale.  This would be good served with a main dish with some sauce to it.

Made these for the first time and have to say, I'm a fan.  I wasnt too sure about how the texture would come out, but I stuck with it and they came out perfect!  They didnt come out oily or anything.  Good enough to eat on heir own and with KETCHUP!!  :-)

I made this for St. Patrick's day because I wanted something Irish and I'd had it once at a restaurant. Yummy! I would take people's suggestions on how to season it though; my "salt and pepper to taste" always ends up a little bland. Still love it!
