This salad is a personal favorite and VERY filling.  On its own, it seemed a bit wanting to me.  So, I tossed it over chopped spinach as a salad filler.  That gave it a more well-rounded feel to my meal.  Household likes: 4, Household dislikes: 4

This was good, but I felt like something was missing...maybe some thinly sliced onion or something? I also think that this needed more lemon juice than called for, but that's my personal preference. I did use dried mint (I dried my fresh mint from the garden last year), but that was my only change. We love radishes and this was a nice, new way to enjoy them. I may try this again and tweak a few things. Thanks for sharing. :)

I dont like radishes, but I had a boat load from my farm share, so I decided to give it a shot.  I would make this again.  I used 1/2 the amount of mint b/c my husband isn't a fan.

I'm not a fan of radishes in general and this recipe made them not only edible, but delicious! I read the recipe wrong and accidentally used 2 tablespoons of lemon juice so I upped the honey to 1/2 tablespoon and the result is fantastic. The combination of ingredients really cuts the spice and potency of radishes.

Good salad, made 1/2 batch and went very light with dried mint. Sliced the radishes in the food processor.

This only 4 stars because of operator error: I've only made this 1 time & must make it again. I forgot to buy mint so used Penzey's Greek seasoning. I loved it but want to try it again with ALL the ingredients.

This is the first recipe I've ever rated on here. It was THAT GOOD! Realized I forgot the honey after the first bite, shredded my radish for a slaw versus slicing, scaled it down for one person, and likely overdid the lemon not wanting to waste any precious juice but it was still incredible way to use my early spring veggies and herbs from your garden or that grocery store healthy food impulse buy. It was  very easy to make this dish with homegrown/local ingredients, including local honey. Awesome way to be introduced to radish as more of a hearty dish versus a garnish or dipped in ranch, very filling by itself for a snack. Powerhouse nutrition wise. OK, OK; I could keep going on about how awesome this recipe is so in final; Worth the try at least once. This will become a staple in my household!

Its May, and it is radish season! Also I have fresh mint  growing in my guerrilla garden, so I really wanted to try this recipe. Because of time I only made roughly a third or the recipe. We were both thrilled.The fresh combination of strong radish, fresh lemon, mint, combined with the wonderful textures made this a winner in my kitchen.
I had two left over scallions that I chopped up and added in because I was cutting back on the salt in the recipe, and it ended it coming out great! I would have never thought of combining walnuts with radishes but it really worked. 
I know we will be getting more radishes at the farmers market and this is a delicious salad!
