These were very good.  I served then topped with pinto beans, cheese, lettuce and diced tomato.  They would also be good made a little smaller and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.

I was a little nervous to make this, since I don't fry things in general,  but I was asked to bring a native American dish to a book club. I used an electric skillet set at 375Â° and that worked very well. I poured in about a half inch of vegetable oil and set that to heat while the dough rose.  Again, that worked out just fine. I got about 16 pieces of bread out of the 6 cups of flour. The bread is delicious, and I was thinking maybe to serve it with strawberry jam. Thank you for the recipe!

We did not use oil to cook due to dietary restrictions.  Pan Fried with butter instead.  Family loved them :)
