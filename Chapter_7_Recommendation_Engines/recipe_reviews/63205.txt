This recipe was delicious!!!  There was quite a lot of chopping involved, but the taste made the work pay off.  I think the peach fresca could also be called peach salsa as I've tasted something like it with other fruit salsas.  My children (14 and 12) didn't like it because of the onions, but I thought the onions gave it a nice balance between the sweet and spicy.  I'll definately keep this recipe for the future!!!

It was just OK.  I was expecting more from a 5 star recipe.  The Peach "salsa" was a bit over powering and didn't quite match the flavor of the meat.
