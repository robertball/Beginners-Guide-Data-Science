This is a good potato soup if you make a few alterations.  I omitted the celery.  I added about 1 cup of cheese, a package of bacon (fried and crumbled) and added a few green onions.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!!  Once I added those things, it was extremely good.  I will make this again (but only with those alterations!)

This is a great potato soup and my family and friends have all loved it.  I do make a few changes to make it even better.  Cook about 10 pieces of bacon in the oven and use about 2 tablespoons of the oil from the bacon to add to the soup.  Crumble the bacon to add as a garnish on top of the soup when you serve.  Also add Mild Cheddar Cheese on top of soup and make sure it's about 2 tablespoons of cheese and bacon that you add on top.  That makes the soup really good and everyone asks for seconds.  Thanks!!
Also - if you don't have celery which I didn't - add 2 to 3 shakes of celery salt instead.

A fantastically versital potatoe soup! With 12 of us living in our home I have to satisfy many different tastes!  I crumbled bacon and shredded some cheddar and put it on the table for those that wanted it. Me and the kids loved it the way it was but my husband loves more spice.  I added a teaspoon of thyme and some onion powder to his portion of the soup and set his favorite HOT sauce beside him so he could add what he wanted.  EVERYONE was happy because the original is so easy to adapt to the individual.  I served this soup w/a recipe I also got on this sight called CHEESE Biscuit I...Satisfying and filling and easy and YUMMY! I give 5 stars to any recipe that can please that many of us at once!

Good flavor.  I sauteed the celery and onion first in 2 tbsps of the butter and I used 1 cup of shredded cheddar instead of 1 cup of half and half.  I didn't think it needed any more cream and I like cheddar cheese in potato soup.

This recipe was great. I did change a few things, though. I used minced onion instead of fresh, and added extra boullion. Also added bacon, and instead of half of the butter, i used bacon grease. it added a great flavor to the soup. Also, since i can't stay away from the spice cabinet, i added garlic powder, onion powder, and more celery salt. At the end when you add half & half, I used evaporated milk instead. It was really good. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I'm sorry, but this soup recipe is not warrant 5 stars.  I followed this recipe to the "T" and found it very bland.  After adding wine, whole thyme leaves, nutmeg I found it much improved!

More of a "cream" soup than a potato soup, but still good. Make sure you chop the parsley finely, it helps to use scissors.

Wow!!!! This was really good! I've never made potato soup before. I made it exactly as the recipe said except I used evaporated milk instead of half and half, just because I needed to use some up. I also added a little cheddar cheese and bacon bits! I served with Chedder Biscuits as suggested. Oh and I didn't peel the potatoes cause I'm lazy. :)

I made this soup to use up the leafy tips from my bunch of celery.  The soup was delicious, and I have lots of leftovers!  (This recipe made about 8 bowls of soup)

absolutely the best potato soup I have ever tasted. My whole family made lots of compliments on it. This was the first time I have ever made potato soup. The only change I did was double the recipe and add real bacon bits to the soup.....Lusious Thanks!!

Left out the parsley and half-and-half, used two cups of whole milk and added five pieces of crumbled bacon.  It was delicious!

Love this recipe. I do serve it with crumbled bacon, green onion and shredded cheese on the side if anyone wants to add these. This also makes for a pretty garnish on top of each bowl if you know everyone will like the 3 extras.

I have made this soup several times and my family loves it.  As another reviewer suggested, I saute the onions and celery in the butter until tender, before adding the flour and butter. I serve with crumbled bacon and shredded cheddar. Occasionally I add a big spoonful of nacho cheese sauce to my bowl for some yummy zip.  This is a very versatile soup; so easy to adapt. It is also easy to double and provide a meal for another family.

Perfect balance of tastes. Will certainly make again and again. Be careful not to cut your diced potatoes too big; a small bite size is good. Try adding a few finely chopped celery leaves for a little different texture.

This recipe was excellent!  I did not want to use
celery so I doubled the onion, added some left over ham and three slices of deli style american
cheese!  I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers!!!

Delicious comfort food on a cold night!  My children loved the soup.  I served it with the cheese biscuit recipe on this site.  The combo was an absolute hit with my family.

This was excellent.My husband is always raving about his grandma's potato soup, which I have never been able to match, try as I may, so I gave up long ago. She adds spaetzle to her's so I added that to this as well, so he keeps coming back again and again tasting it, then he wakes me up last night at like midnight and says that soup is awesome, better than my grandmas!!! Thanks for sharing :)

I made this as directed except I substituted vegetable bouillon since I'm vegetarian.  It took forever for the milk to thicken--I ended up having to turn it up to medium heat.  I would suggest starting to heat the milk as soon as you put the vegetables on the stove.  I thought the soup was a little bland--we had to add a lot of salt and pepper.  Overall, though, it was pretty good.

This was an excellent recipe.  I didn't have any celery salt but it still tasted great.  I add some fresh green onions, bacon bits and grated cheese.  My husband absolutely loved this soup.  He said he could eat this at least 3 times a week.  Thank you for sharing!

Excellent potato soup recipe. We've been making this one for years now and we can't get enough.

We usually use dried celery flakes and mash the potatoes in the pot before serving. Mashing the potatoes produces a more consistant texture which we prefer.

This is the first time I've ever made potato soup and it was wonderful! I even left out the onions (don't like them) and celery (husband doesn't like it).  My husband loves potato soup and gave this 5 stars.  I also used a vegetable boullion cube instead of chicken.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was a hit with the family. This had a lot of "soup" and I wish there had been more potatoes as it seemed to need some body. I really didn't like this soup personally but I am super picky and the lack of body in the soup part, plus the celery and onion chunks, and I thought it was blah and needed cheese, bacon, and sour cream and would have much preferred my loaded baked potato soup. This was the cream of potato soup that my mom made and loved when I was growing up. I didn't like it then and I don't like it now. My husband loved it though.

This is a quick and simple soup with good flavor. If you're a fan of potato soup, I recommend this one since it's not overburdened with other flavors.
Thanks for sharing. :o)

I didnt use half and half because Im on a budget and not buying it at the moment. I used a can of evaporated milk instead and added 2% milk until I thought it was the right consistency. I didnt quite need all of the flour about 4 tablespoons. This was pretty good. Helped me get dinner on in a pinch. Id like to add ham or bacon next time it seemed like it needed something.

This is the first recipe I felt I really wanted to review.  This soup was excellent, pleasing the whole family.  I am making it for the second time this week due to request!  My 2 and 4 year olds loved it (and they are not crazy about potatos) and leftovers were eaten quickly.  I made the cheese biscuits, which were delicious with the soup.  I also added carrots to the recipe because my children love carrots.

Was a great recipe think it would have be bland by itself but 5 stars with changes.  Wow,  Warning non sodium users……….my chicken bouillon has 876 mg per tsp almost didn’t make this recipe. I added turkey bacon and a can of low sodium chicken broth a little bouillon.  No Celery salt used seed instead I didn’t have celery.  I cooked and then tweeked the spices after all was together.  Added until I had a good flavor.  I cut all the salt so had to add other stuff.  Here’s what I did:  doubled all the other spices in recipe, I fearfully added a couple shakes of Dash table blend and it was good, a few shakes of white pepper, thyme suggested by others (makes it a little ugly had to add some cracked black to cover up, freckly).    I had a sprig of rosemary but cook whole and pulled out also ugly.   Still was missing something so I added fennel seeds (quarter size) you will need to crush I may put a root in and pull out after cooking next time.  The fennel made this soup.  Don’t use whole seeds if you mind the bite.  Try one plain.  I added a cup of cheddar also sharp.  Will try without thyme next time.  Will also prepare my own broth extra strong.   Note:  Boil a chicken and the cook on low with spices needed for recipe and veges or left over veges.  Leeks are really good the whole thing and greens from other veges.  This I think would be a stronger flavor you could add a neck bone and some garlic cloves.  Strain and its ready no salt WOW.    I am going to make this soup with fresh

This is a great recipe, I did not have any celery, so I used carrots instead.  I also cooked bacon to a crisp and added it along with the green onions, after the soup was done.  I added extra salt to it as well.  My family thought it was soooooo good.  I have added this to my recipe book and have also passed it on to my sister.

This was good but there is a recipe I tried last fall that was better. Only I have no clue what recipe I used. If you have never tried potato soup before this is a good one to start with. It is very creamy. Good flavor.

Awesome soup recipe. I'm picky about potato soup recipes and this ranks up in my top 5 list!  I've also added some shredded cheddar cheese in with the half and half to make it a cheesy potato soup.  About 3/4 cup.  Yummy! Thank you for posting this recipe!

This was great potato soup. The only thing I changed was I used half the butter and added a stick of margarine, used evaporated milk instead of regular milk and half and half, used dried dandelion in place of parsley, and celery seed instead of celery salt. I garnished mine with some shredded cheddar, my son and husband garnished theirs with FunYuns.

Good recipe but I improved it a bit by:

-Substituting a can of Cheddar Cheese soup for the 1/2 & 1/2.
-added 1 teaspoon of bottled garlic
-added 2 teaspoons of salt (who makes potato soup without salt?)
-Instead of the butter, I cooked up 6 strips of thick sliced bacon. I removed the crispy bacon strips and crumbled them up.  Added the flour to the bacon grease, then added the milk. Mixed it together with the crumbled bacon.  Pretty awesome.

This potato soup was very good!!  My husband was sick so I was looking for a soup to make for him with the stuff I had on hand.  I didn't use any celery since we hate celery (but did keep the celery salt) and I didn't have any half and half so I only used milk.  I added a handful of cheese to my roux and this soup was very tasty.  I'm very glad I found this as I will absolutely make it the same way over and over anytime our family gets sick.

This was really good.  I added a little garlic powder and since I never have half-and-half on hand, I used a can of cream of mushroom soup to thicken it up.  Will make again.

My family loved this.  I made a couple slight changes.  I added 2 Tbsp of Chesapeake Bay seasoning, 2 Tbsp Seasoning Salt,4 large garlic cloves (minced) and left out all the celery and celery salt and it was delicious. Add 1/2 lb. bacon. Cut slices into 3/4" strips and fry until crisp. Drain and add to soup just before adding milk and butter thickening sauce.  Sprinkle with grated cheese at the table if desired.

I doubled this recipe and didn't include the onions. I added 3 cups of left over ham from Easter and instead of using water to cover the veggies I used chicken broth and reduced the amount of boullion cubes. This was my first attempt at a potato soup and it turned out good. Total comfort food. I think I might try the tips about adding some bacon next time..get a bit more flavor. I did make the cheese biscuits with it ..a MUST!

This is the best potato soup that I have made. I have a large family and doubled recipe and also added ham. My youngest child is a picky eater and she even ate it. That makes this recipe a 5-star for me.

Wonderful soup for a cold day! This is one of my daughters favorites foods and I made it yesterday for the first time. She said mine was better then the restaurant she usually gets it at and had 2 bowls. I did add my bacon grease to the recipe for a little more flavor and topped with bacon and cheses. Yummy!

EXCELLENT POTATO SOUP! The only thing I added was some garlic powder and a hint more celery salt.  I also semi-mashed up the potato mixture after it was cooked thoroughly to give the soup a thicker texture.  When it was done, I took others' advice and topped it off with sharp cheddar and crumbled bacon for the boyfriend.  He raved about it; said he could "eat it every day" and that I "hit the jackpot" with this recipe! He's not really a soup eater either, so I was very surprised.  I ate it without the bacon and cheese and it was wonderful!  Thanx Nell for a fantastic recipe!

This was by far the most amazing potato soup i have EVER had in my entire life. My boyfriend couldnt stop raving about it! The only change i made was using 1 can of chicken broth and then filling with water the rest of the way to cover the veggies. I also used chicken boullion granules instead of the cubes.

VERY good soup!!  The only thing I will change next time is either leave out the celery, or dice it very fine.  Thanks for sharing!

It was pretty good after mixing a lot of cheddar cheese into it. My husband also added bacon bits, and after taking his first bite, he just smiled and said, "Yes!"

I love this recipe because it doesn't have all that fattening cheese and bacon that so many potato soup recipes have. Thank you!

I added chunky style Portabella Mushrooms to accentuate the earthy flavor of the potatoes.  Turned out really well, made a pig of myself.

Because we are Vegan, replaced all dairy products with vegan butter, coconut milk, and soy milk, and all the herbs parsley, chives were fresh from the garden. Great recipe to start with.

I like the soup. I tend to mash 1/3 of the potatoes to use as my thickening agent, then maybe add 1 tsp flour if I feel impatient. Often double the celery salt and leave out the celery, usually add a pound of spicy sausage that I have browned, although I've also put in hamburger. Today, I'll be melting in a cup of gruyere cheese at the finish, rather than garnishing with cheddar cheese.

This only gets 4 stars because it NEEDS to have cheese and/or bacon added to it to be good. Other than that it's great!

A couple of other things I add for fun is diced garlic (I add garlic to everything), and grated carrots. The carrots are pretty much just for color.

This is a very good basic recipe.  I added some shredded cheddar cheese and diced ham.  I don't think it's real potato soup unless it has DILL in it so I added some fresh!  I didn't use half and half and only have skim milk and it turned out very nice.

We really liked this soup, I gave 4 stars because I did have to change it just a bit to suit my pantry.  I used Evaporated milk instead of half & half, because that's what I had on hand.  Also, skipped the celery but used a little celery salt.
Served with beer bread, it was a very good warm your soul kind of meal! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe for Potato Soup.  I changed it because I didnt have the bouillon cube so I put a can of chicken stock in the water that covered the potatoes and onion.  I also left out the celery.  I chopped up about 10 potatoes instead of the 4 cups.  I only used one cup of milk and a can of cream of chicken to add to the butter and flour. I mashed the potatoes so that it was slightly chunky and served it with sour cream and shredded cheese.  This is definetely a keeper.

so simple!  My husband asks for it everytime there's a nip in the air.  It really is a breeze to make.  Add a little milk to make it more soupy or leave it nice and thick.  The fresh parsley gives it a nice taste.

Well your recipes is great only when you add more flavor. I found just following your recipe no one would have wanted to eat it. I used bacon, cheese and chicken flavoring that I usually use on my fried chicken and also to give it some color carrots. You also need to add real salt along with the celery salt. More pepper doesn't hurt either. When I got done it tasted just like a loaded baked potato.. YUMMY
