Extremely easy and so good. I added a little vanilla to the mix and used brown sugar instead of white for the cinnamon sugar mixture and added nutmeg. I doubled the brown sugar mixture so there was enough to put on top of the bread to form a nice crunchy coating while baking.

GREAT recipe. I've made it 3 times this week, it's one I got in a magazine years ago, but misplaced. My family loves it, be sure to use the right sized pan, if you don't, then the bread will be doughy. Also, sometimes it takes mine 45 minutes, other times it takes 50 minutes. Just test it with a toothpick. I always start the timer at the lowest suggested baking time. That way I don't have burned stuff. Also, make sure you have an oven thermometer. I don't like low star ratings because an oven is off, or somebody changed the recipe, or didn't use the right pan size.

Five stars and two thumbs up from me.  I made no changes to the recipe other than using an 8x4” loaf pan and after preparing it and tasting it (well, to be honest eating a good-sized slice) I can confidently report no changes are necessary – nothing added, nothing substituted, nothing omitted.  You could change this or that if for some reason you felt compelled to, but it wouldn’t make this any better.  It’s a pretty loaf, first of all; very inviting.  Some baked goods taste better than they look, but this is good from the get-go, and you’d be proud to serve it to “company.”   The bread is at once moist, cinnamon-y with a delightfully sugary, crackly top.  It's incredibly flavorful, even tho’ there are no flavor enhancers (other than salt) like vanilla, brown sugar or butter.  None are needed, nor would they improve the structure or taste in any way.  With common pantry staples you are likely to always have on hand, this is one of those recipes you can just get into the kitchen and dig into without sorting through a ton of reviews while making notes of advised tweaks and changes.  Mix this up simply following the recipe as it’s written and enjoy.

OMG, this is sooo delicious! I used applesauce instead of oil to lower fat content. The bread is still moist, and good! Thanks for sharing this keeper!

This was easy and yummy!!  I substituted half of the milk with cinnamon hazelnut refrigerated coffee creamer.  That was tasty!  When I make it again, I think I'll cut back the sugar just a little since that added quite a bit of sweetness.  Also, I need to cook it a little longer, as it was quite doughy in the middle but a little experimenting with my oven should fix that!  I didn't wrap it and let it sit overnight, though I know that this does improve quick breads.  Thanks for a great recipe with ingredients most have on hand!  One more thing...the three star rating given by a previous poster can't really be considered accurate as baking soda and baking powder are two VERY different things and interchanging them would greatly alter a recipe.

This shouldn't be called bread but, rather, coffee cake or sweet bread. But as it is, it turned out really well and is delicious!
I made it a 2nd time and increased the eggs to 2, the oil to 1/2 cp butter, decreased the milk to 3/4 cp, and added 1 tsp vanilla. I also added 1/4 cp chopped peanuts to the cinnamon sugar mixture. It turned out better yet! So the original recipe is an excellent basic one to which you can make your own changes. Thanks, Bettina Bryant!

GREAT RECIPE! I make this all the time, and always get compliments for it. It's so easy to make, and the ingredients are so simple. Instead of putting half the batter. I actually divide the batter and cinnamon sugar into thirds and layer it that way. I just think it's prettier. :)

I used brown sugar instead of white for the topping, and increased the cinnamon to 1 tablespoon.  This came out very good.  I like to eat this topped with "Sunday Best Fruit Salad" (from this site) for breakfast.

An absolute family favorite.  I made these into muffins and mini loaves of bread.  I also used the vanilla glaze recipe from this site to drizzle over the top.  I made these for my daughter's swim meet for snacks, and they were the first muffins to disappear.  I also subbed applesauce in for some of the oil, and they turned out moist and delicious.

I make the following changes, as recommended by other reviewers: 2/3 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, use half brown sugar and half white sugar for the bread, brown sugar instead of white for the topping, and I double the topping.  Half of the topping goes inside as instructed, and the other half is mixed with 2 tbsp melted butter and sprinkled on top.  I also add 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla extract to each loaf.

The bread ends up being moist, sweet, and JUST the right amount of spice.  It's absolutely perfect with coffee or earl grey tea.  My dad makes me make him two loaves for the freezer whenever I visit!

Oh my gosh, so so delicious and moist. I didn't change anything except increase the cinnamon sugar by one-half. Next time, I'll stick with the original amount, and put 2/3 of it on the inside. The sugar on top was good and crunchy, but fell off very easily and made it hard to eat without making a huge mess. I'd rather have less on top. To the commenters who say this is not a bread - this is a quick bread. Such as banana bread and zucchini bread. EDIT: I made this a second time, doubling the recipe and baking in a 9"x13" cake pan and it turned out just as good. Maybe better, because you eat it on a plate like a slice of cake, so it's less messy. EDIT: This recipe makes 12 beautiful regular sized muffins with high domes. Fill the muffin tins halfway, add a spoonful of the cinnamon/sugar, then divide the remaining batter between the tins. Don't be afraid to really fill the tins, they expand up and don't spill over the edges.

This is one of my go-to dessert bread recipes. It's super easy to make and absolutely delicious; I always double or triple the recipe because it disappears so fast. I have to cook mine for closer to an hour for it to be set in the center. For a low-fat version, you can substitute applesauce for the vegetable oil, and for a richer, tastier version, substitute melted butter. Minus the cinnamon-sugar, the recipe is an excellent base batter for any type of quickbread: chocolate chip, flaked coconut, walnut, cranberries, chopped apples -- the sky's the limit!

This is the easiest cake ever. It is very clean and fast to do and ULTRA MOISTY! I have done it tons of times already and the only thing I use to change is that I mix brown sugar with the cinnamon instead of white sugar. If you want to go for something 100% sure, go for this cinnamon swirl bread!

I was actually surprised how well it turned out, though I did put more cinnamon in the  sugar-cinnamon mixture, just cause I like cinnamon. But the bread itself, was very moist and I ended up eating half the loaf today.

This recipe has been a family favorite ever since my daughter brought the recipe home from home economics class 9 years ago. I make it every holiday and at Christmastime for friends who look for it every year. You can't go wrong with this recipe. Be sure to wrap it when cool and wait overnight to eat it, it really does make a difference.

This was a great bread to make when you're craving something with cinnamon and sugar but don't feel like running out to the store! It was really good and I will definately make it again, but I think I will have to tinker with it a bit to get exactly what I'm looking for. A great midday snack!

This bread was a hit!  I added 1 t of vanilla to the milk and cut back my 1/3 c sugar to 1/2 c. I prepared it in an 8" round pan. I served this for Saturday breakfast. I was making the second batch less than 2 hrs later! I made a cream cheese frosting at the request of my guys and frosted it while it was still rather warm!!! Made a rabbit hug a hound! This is a regular staple now! I Thank you & my guy's Thank you, Bettina!!

Very good bread and easy recipe! I didn't change a thing (sort of). The only thing I did different that really didn't effect the recipe was I mixed 1/3 cup sugar and 2 tsp of cinnamon (not the ones listed in the recipe, you still need what the recipe calls for). Then sprayed my loaf pan and dusted the bottom and sides with the mixture. It made a crust on the bottom and sides, which left it so yummy. This recipe leaves your taste buds confused on if it is a bread or a cake. I am looking forward to making this again and hoping to put in the vanilla extract, walnuts and possibly a strudel on top.

This is incredible bread (more like coffee cake really)! I made mine in a bundt pan and it turned out amazing. I only had to cook it for about 30 minutes. I subbed the applesauce for the oil and was surprised how light and airy the texture was. Many times when using applesauce the texture gets rubbery, even when I am careful not to overstir. But not this time! My kids love it! I used turbinado (sugar in the raw) for the swirl mixture. I also used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 turbinado sugar for the bread. (I very rarely use white sugar for anything). We ate ours about 10 minutes after it was out of the oven. This recipe is definitely a keeper!! I may try to sub in some splenda next time to cut down on the sugar and calories.

Wasn't as good as I was hoping, but it did make for a good bed time snack.  I didn't have any baking powder, so I added about 1/2 tsp of baking soda and a splash of vanilla. I wanted to substitute buttermilk for the regular, but didn't have any. I really didn't think it was sweet enough...even with all of the cinnamon sugar swirled in, which did give it a nice appearance.  My son enjoyed it, so I'm glad I gave it a try.  Thanks for sharing.

I wanted something that was different from my constant Banana Bread & my Pumpkin Bread! THIS IS IT! Made a double batch in a 13X9 Glass Pyrex. Recipe calls for 1 cup milk. (Tweaker that I am) I did 1 1/2 cups 2% milk and 1/2 cup Buttermilk that I wanted to use up. I put 1/2 of the batter in and covered it with 1/2 of the cinn/sugar topping and then added the rest of the batter on top. Added rest of the topping and swirled with a knife. A M A Z I N G ! 13X9 gone in a day from my teenagers & their friends. This is so good I am going to make it again today per their request. I think I will add 1/3 cup Lt. Brown Sugar to the topping today. New favorite! 10 stars and it makes your house smell amazing!

If I had been able to use the exact ingredients I know it would be a 5, so 5 it is. I have to use SPLENDA and it' stil very, very good and quick.  I thought it wasn't going to rise at all but it did.
Everyone is right, even better the next day.

UPDATE:  My last batch came out a little dry and no one really ate that much.  I was cleaning out the fridge and just about ready to throw the remaining portion away when I suddenly thought of French Toast.  Oh my!  So delicious!  The cinnamon inside melted as it cooked, so it was ooey-gooey cinnamony on the inside and crunchy toasty on the outside.  Just had to post!  ORIGINAL:  There was no way this was going to make it wrapped in foil overnight.  Uh-huh.  Nope.  Not going to happen.  We ate it.  We ate it all.  Wonderful recipe - a snap to whip up and delightfully moist with just the right amount of cinnamon/sugar mix running through.  Didn't change or add a thing.  Perfect.

I've made this a few times and I really prefer to replace the 1/3 cup of white sugar for ALL BROWN SUGAR instead. It tastes much better. White sugar makes it kinda plain and boring. That's the only thing I changed and follow the rest of the directions.

This is way too good! Did knock sugar down to 1/2 cup, and didn't use quite as much cinnamon sugar called for (personal preference, trying to be *healthier*) and still very good. Bread was soft inside with a really nice crunch on the outside. Thank you for a great recipe!

This turned out really well.  I made one to try out for just my husband and myself.  Then I made six more  for a bake sale our woman's club was having, for these I did add 1/3 c. brown sugar for additional sweetness and a handful of cinnamon chips to the topping which I swirled in.  I got a kick out of the person who gave a review here and said it didn't turn out as well as she thought it should be,  she then admits she switched out baking powder for baking soda, then knocked off two stars......sheesh, it takes all kinds!

I did change the recipe as I wanted something real sweet.  3/4 white and 1/4 light brown, 1 TBS cinnamon for sugar mix.  1 tsp. vanilla in batter.  I used a square baking pan, 350 for 35 minutes.  I used 1/3 of sugar mix on first level of batter and the remaining on top.  I still swirled the batter prior to putting top level of sugar mix and I dotted with butter but next time I think I will cut in butter sugar mix.  AND, I think I will not use the vanilla as I think the addition of brown sugar and so much sugar to boot is flavor enough.  I also think this recipe would work well just as is.

I'd give this 10 stars if I could. Super easy - and tastes so good the next morning with your coffee.  My kids beg for it all the time.

I love this recipe. It's so easy, even for kids. But I don't know why it is called bread. It's really a coffee cake.

I needed a recipe for a staff meeting, and this one fit the bill. It was very moist, easy to make and the only modification I made was to make three layers of the batter and cinnamon mixture. A definite make again - thanks for sharing the recipe Bettina.

This is extremely easy prep wise and it makes you look like a pro! It is also a wonderful gift! Who can resist sweet cinnamon and sugar together!? I will even be so bold to substitute 2/3 C of applesauce in place of the 1/3 C oil! YUMMY!

This recipe is soooooo easy and delicious! I added about 2 teaspoons cinnamon and 1/2 tablespoon vanilla to the batter (Vanilla is a MUST in anything sweet!). I also cut the white sugar down to about 2/3 cup. The bread is moist and doesn't need butter slathered on top! Mine tasted like Amish Friendship bread, but it didnt take 10 days!!!

This was delicious. I used brown sugar, cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg and cloves to sprinkle in between the layers of batter. I will definitely make this again in the future.

I made this recipe two ways: exactly as written and adjusted for my 8,000 foot altitude. I did not add or substitute any of the ingredients. Both loaves turned out just wonderful and it's hard to tell one from the other. Letting the loaves sit overnight was the most difficult part, because they smell soooo good!. Cutting in to them this morning yielded a wonderfully crunchy crust and a moist, flavorful interior. Toasted with butter? Fabulous! Next will come French toast a la Santa Fe, which no doubt will be excellent! Thanks, bettina, for this recipe!

This was a very nice recipe. I made it exactly as written. At 45 minutes baking, the toothpick test showed it wasn't quite done yet, so I went the full 50 minutes. By then, the outside was a little too done. So the optimal baking time is somewhere in between. But that's quibbling. I enjoyed slices of this, slightly reheated, for a few days' breakfasts. It has a nice cinnamon-sugar taste throughout. Recommended!

Wow!  This is so good.  I've made 5 loaves so far and it was delicious. I have 7 kids and a picky husband, and all of them liked this.  It's quick and easy with ingredients that I had on hand.  Thanks for this great recipe!

This recipe is so easy and amazingly delicious!  I used applesauce instead of oil and the bread was still perfect.  Also (because it's what my husband prefers) I substituted brown sugar for the swirl.  Lastly I added a tiny bit of vanilla extra to the dough.  The bread is moist and slightly dense...perfect for coffee or dessert.

This recipe is amazingly easy and quick to throw together! I took some up to a college tailgate and the kids have requested it every week since! I used the brown sugar instead of white sugar for the topping and added a touch of vanilla...yummy!

Loved this!  The batter is almost like a yellow cake mix YUM!   I added a little vanilla to the batter and added some brown sugar to the sugar/cinnamon mix.  It turned out delish!  I made the layers thin so you get a lot of cinnamon sugar all throughout.  So good...will definitely bake again. Thanks!

Tasted kind of dough like even though it was fully cooked. Even with double topping it tasted lousy. Not sure why so many raved about it. I'll stick to my yeast bread version which blows this away.

Wow! I used Almond milk because I had a half gallon and needed to use it. I used brown sugar instead of white and tsp vanilla based on other reviews. Couldn't wait for it to sit for more than an hour, lol. A pat of butter on a still warm slice...heaven! Moist inside and slightly crisp on top from the sugar. I plan to make this quite often.

Prepared as written, made sure I really swirled cinnamon sugar mixture and it turned out good. I have been trying several quick bread recipes recently. I think the oil could be decreased just a bit in most that I have made. Bake time was right on.

I thought the bread tasted delicious.  I took the advice of another reviewer and sprinkled some of the cinnamon sugar mixture on top and ended up with it almost burning.  Next time I'll stay true to the recipe.  I do happen to prefer another cinnamon bread recipe out there that calls for buttermilk instead.  So I'm rating this 4 stars in comparison to another bread I like better.  However, if I'm out of buttermilk, this will still be a delicious alternative.

Yum.  After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to add a small box of vanilla pudding to the mix with a splash more milk than the recipe calls for. It did take about 15 more minutes in the oven but worth the wait! It turned out great! I was looking for something easy to pacify my sweet tooth and this fit!

Loved this bread! We have an amish store near us that makes this bread. We love the bread but not the prices so I wanted to make this myself. It was so easy and tastes great. I did add a little more cinnamon and sugar because we love things sweet. It is exactly like the one sold at the amish store...well done on this recipe!

I am a huge fan of yeast breads and was not expecting much of this, and really for my taste it is a little too sweet and cake like.    HOWEVER, it is a huge hit at every gathering I bring it to when I just don't have time to have yeast breads rise, and it makes the BEST FRENCH TOAST EVER when it is a couple days old--I'm talking good enough that I made a loaf cut it in half and set it out for 3 days just for  sunday brunch!   It is a little mild flavor, so I recommend adding a little more cinnamon and/or something else to jolt it up--I like ginger in the main batter about 1 tsp fresh grated as ginger and me are best friends!

This recipe is EXCELLENT! I didn't change a thing to the ingredients!  I did allow the bread to cool in the pan and then took it out and wrapped it up.  We also ate some of it while it was still slightly warm so it doesn't need to sit overnight either.  It was very , very good - my entire family loved it!  I will definitely make it again.

This bread is pretty good. I used applesauce instead of oil to make it low-fat. It still turned out moist. Next time I think I'll bake it for less time though, the outside turned out tough and chewy. Otherwise...pretty good!

Do not bother making this recipe. You will get a heavy tasteless, loaf of bread if you do. I made two loaves for a brunch and threw them both away. My husband ran to the grocery store for pastries. I was so disappointed with this recipe.

This turned out so good. Easy to make with ingredients that I always have. The only change I made was using  half regular sugar and half brown sugar. Will make again.

I just finished making this and it's already gone. I have to make another one for the morning! I even ate a piece and I usually don't eat baked goods. It wasn't too sweet or too rich. It was perfect and would be great with my morning coffee. The only things I did different was add a tsp of vanilla and used 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of white (just with the hopes of a darker swirl). Next time I'm going to use applesauce as other reviews recommended because it did crumble a bit (probably my fault though) but it is really perfect the way that it is.

This was so easy & came out so delicious, I doubt I'll ever go through the trouble of making cinnamon rolls again. I used brown sugar for the cinnamon/sugar mix & 1T cinnamon, used Splenda for the sugar in the batter, folded in 1/2c raisins (will add 1c from now on), used Egg Beaters, 1/2c Greek yogurt (I'll use regular yogurt next time, as batter was stiff) for 1/2 the milk and 1/3c applesauce instead of the oil. It's a lot of substitutes, but they are just to make it less fattening & more healthy - not a completely new bread. I put 1/2 in an 8"x8"x2" cake pan, sprinkled 1/2 the cinnamon, rest of batter, rest of cinnamon. I swirled it well and baked for 23 minutes at 350* in the toaster oven. Tasted it once cooled and it was great, but I dutifully wrapped it in foil & left it for this morning. I made a powdered sugar/milk/butter/vanilla glaze & topped the re-warmed bread (MWO 30 sec on high). It's moist & chewy & the perfect amount of cinnamon. I will be making this a lot! Thank you for this recipe - it will be handed out many times, I'm sure!

So easy, fast, and delicious! Great with an afternoon cup of tea. Might be good with some raisins tossed in too. I only let it cool for about 20 minutes before slicing. Not sure why the original recipe said to wait overnight. I don't think I could have held out that long!

I made it a second time but this time stuck with the recipe.  Very plain but perfect for coffee and tea.  Next time I will use 2/3 of the sugar mixture on the first level and 1/3 on the top as it tends to fall off the top easily.  What is touching the batter will stay on.  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil as I was out and it worked perfectly.  The coconut oil I use is cold pressed and organic but does not have a coconut flavor like some other brands so it does not distort the flavor.

Excellent flavor--a very pleasant, moist sweet bread w/ more like a "homemade" bread texture (vs. cake-like) that was simple to make.  I added raisins.

I think this bread makes a great french toast bread and it is good to eat.  Every time I make it I get rave reviews also some times I use margarine or butter in place of the oil and it taste great.

I made this out of boredom bc I had all the needed ingredients. Made absolutley no changes and it turned out wonderful. I'm a professional baker and this tasted better than my bakeries cinnamon bread! Don't add vanilla or brown sugar or anything bc it's great just how it is. Defiatly a keeper and having an infant at home it's very simple to make while he's taking a nap.

Really good and easy. I didn't have any milk, I only had heavy cream so I used that instead and the bread came out delicious....probably has alot more fat and calories, but defintely worth it. If I make it again, which I'm sure I will I will absolutely use the heavy cream instead of the milk.

This just wasn't good.  I am a whiz with sweet breads and this one just didn't come together.  Watched it like a hawk so not to overcook, but it came out hard, dry and crusty.  Won't be making again.

This is a really easy, quick, delicious tasting recipe.  I was looking for a recipe in the "breads" category that didn't take too long to prepare and this was the one I chose.  When I have time I will probably still make a yeast bread, but when I just need to pop something into the oven this is a great recipe.

I made 2 loaves of this for brunch today--one loaf was gobbled up straight away while it was still slightly warm to raves from the whole family.  It is moist and delicious.  I'm wrapping the other loaf in foil as per the instructions to see how it is tomorrow.  I did make 3 minor changes--one being replacing the white sugar with brown sugar in the cinnamon sugar mixture because I like brown sugar better; adding a tsp of vanilla to the wet ingredients; and adding the zest of 1/2 an orange to the dry ingredients, because I like a hint of orange in my cinnamon treats.
I had the same problem mentioned by another reviewer of having the middle cave in on one of the loaves; will try baking it in an 8x8 pan next time to see if that gets around the problem.
It does taste remarkably like Amish Friendship Cake, so if you like that, you are likely to enjoy this also.

Great recipe!! I like to play with recipes and see if I can make them healthier, and this is what I did for this one: I used 1/3 cup of pureed apple pear that I had (I didn't have any applesauce) in place of the oil, I used whole wheat flour and used a little more baking powder to help it rise because of that. I also used  3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup and upped the cinnamon to 1 tablespoon just because I like cinnamon! Thank you so much for posting!!

This tastes very good, I've made it twice and the first time I used a loaf pan and the second time I cooked it in a 8x8 pan. I actually preferred it in the 8x8 pan, it tasted more moist and like cake.

This was VERY good!  I'm giving it five stars because not only did it taste good, it was very easy to make too.  Simple ingredients everybody has on hand, and doesn't require a mixer either.  I messed up and put 2 T. of cinnamon in instead of 2 teaspoons, so I added another 1/3 cup of sugar to that mixture and layered it in 3 times instead of 2.  No big deal though, it still turned out great.  Thanks so much for this easy, inexpensive and delicious recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly...very easy to make but not much flavor. Definitely need to wrap it in foil and let it sit overnight.

This is a great recipe...Instead of the 1/3 cup of oil, I substituted 1 mashed very ripe banana. We couldn't wait to taste it...It is a very basic, go-to recipe which we will use many times, I'm sure.

i really want to give this bread 5 stars because it is super yummy and easy to make.  but, i feel like i overmixed it or something - the middle totally caved in.  is that what's it supposed to look like.  it just looks terrible.  and it took longer for me then the recipe said like others have said.  i cooked it an extra ten minutes.  yummy but not attractive enough to serve someone.

I don't know what it was, but I really thought this was just ok. I usually love stuff like this but it seemed a little bland & really crumbly. I made it days ago & it's still just sitting there. I made one loaf with chocolate chips & one without. I preferred the one with chips as it gave it a little something more. It was good, but doubt I'd make it again.

I made this bread for my mom who usually doesn't like cinnamon. She loved this though! The only change I made in this recipe was that I had to cut the sugar and cinnamon in half. This bread smells wonderful coming out of the oven. It fills the house with the smell of cinnamon sugar!

Took others suggestion & used 2/3c applesauce instead of oil, put 2 tsp cinnamon & 1/2 tsp vanilla into the batter. Was easy to make, but I think I'll try 1 tsp vanilla next time. You need the extra cinnamon to even taste it. My mistake was getting to much batter in b/4 adding the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  I thought I'd gotten half batter in pan, but will use less so when swirling it mixes better.

It was pretty good...I didn't have a problem with it being dry...I wanted something like a coffee cake and this was great...I did tweak it a little...I used brown sugar with the cinnamon... and for the topping I used the remainder brown sugar mixture w/butter and put in a few chopped pecans...I also used buttermilk instead of milk

This turned out good, I loved the swirls of cinnamon through out the bread.  If you love cinnamon, this is the bread to make. The only change I will do next time is to do half brown sugar and half white because I thought it was a little too sweet for my taste. The kids loved it and ate almost half the loaf.  A definite keeper.

Cooked for a little over 50 minutes. I used applesauce instead of oil (same amount), used 1/4 c of white and 1/4 c of brown sugar instead of 1/3 c of white sugar, and covered it the last 30 minutes with foil. This was so easy and the SO and I really enjoyed it!

I loved this recipe! I followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfectly. What's also great is that it's quick and easy and made with ingredients that I already have on hand! I had no problems with the baking- it was completely done in 50 minutes.

This recipe was easy!!! At first I was being doubtful tht it wasnt gonna come out good. Reasons why, 1- batter was a little bit, thts why i thought it wasnt gonna rise 2- cinnamon n sugar, i thought i had put a lot between the batter 3- the batter was sweet n had a condensed milk look. I changed the recipe in 2 things. 1st I used 1 TBSP of oil 2. I put a bit of VANILLA EXTRACT as basically all breads have vanilla, so I felt it was missing tht.   The only thing tht threw me off was, whn I tooked out the bread teh cinnamon n sugar i had put on the top didnt cooked all of it ...so it was still as how i put it whn i sprinkled it on the top batter. so I had to throw that away...but besides tht the cake was good..  I am definately, baking this cake again, but next time maybe w less cinnamon n sugar!!!  Happy  BAKING!!!

Easy and tasty.  This was the first time I made this, and decided to make it a little healthier by using 1/2 wheat flour/1/2 white, brown sugar, added flax seed meal, used applesauce instead of butter, and added the vanilla.  It was really good, but next time, I may indulge and just make it the way the recipe is written.  This will be a regular bread to alternate with banana bread in our house!

im giving this recipe 5 huge stars!!!!  i made it spur of the moment bcause my friends were coming over and i had almost all ingredients on hand.  i did use 1/3 cup apple sauce instead of oil because all i had was olive oil which is not good for baking.  added two tablespoons of melted butter.  i only had organic fat free milk so i used that. it came out perfect. everyone raved they said it tasted like entemans!! made the house smell like a bakery. even better the next day slightly warmed with a lil butter. mmmmmmmm.  will do this again 4 sure.  next time i will do exactly the same but add melted chocolate to the swirl. ill let u know how it turns out.

I got a lot of compliments on this when I brought it to a brunch.  It's like a moist cinnamon-y coffee cake.  I used 1 cup of plain yogurt because I didn't have any milk.  I made it the night before.  Next time I will experiment using whole wheat pastry flour and adding vanilla, as suggested by others.  Try it, you'll like it!

This bread is so good.  I made it healthier by replacing some of the oil with applesauce and using whole wheat flour and it was still yummy.  I used 3 heaping teaspoons of cinnamon instead of 2 (you can never have enough cinnamon!).  I will definitely make this again.

This was very yummy, also very easy. I love the fact that I have all the ingredients on hand, and my husband loved it. The only thing was that I found it was more cake like in consistency than a bread, which kind of surprised me. And, for anyone else who doesn't know better like me, don't just pour a bunch of the cinnamon sugar mixture on top... if it isn't mixed in properly then you just end up with that sitting on top! I ended up with a bit of a mess trying to get it off neatly.

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a ring mold (10 minutes extra on baking). I also put a lot of brown sugar on top before baking it, and it turned out beautifully!

I live on a boat, which means I have a SMALL oven and an even smaller amount of storage space for ingredients for baking.  
This bread was wonderful, because I was able to use the ingredients that I would have for other things.

It tastes great, was simple to make, and a great breakfast bread.

Turned out very good.  I use whole wheat flour and a little extra baking powder.  I love my sweet breads.

I know the recipe says to let the bread sit overnight before slicing, but I just couldn't wait.  I cut into it an hour after taking it out of the oven, and it was fantastic.  Even better the next day (hence the instruction to let it sit overnight!).  I followed the recipe exactly, but added 1t vanilla based on some other reviews.  The bread had a nice, moist, dense texture, and was sweet without being too sweet.  A great basic quick bread.

Very good and easy to make.  I have made it twice and the second time I used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour.  Turned out great both times!

This was wonderful.  My 4 year old just devoured three slices.  My 2 year old helped make it and was just tickled to see the 'fruits of her labor'.  They had forgotten that we had made it yesterday and it was a big treat for breakfast this morning.

I tried several different recipes for cinnamon bread, and this one, by far, was the best.  Moist, perfectly sweetened, and super easy to make.  I added walnuts and it tasted even better.

I made this twice. Once exactly as written, and it was great! The second time I made it I added 1 tsp vanilla to the milk/egg mixture before mixing it with the dry ingredients, and I made a streusel topping to put on top. AMAZING. For the streusel topping I used 1/4 cup all purpose flour, 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, about 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 2 tbsp cold butter- cut into chunks, and a pinch of salt. Mix all ingredients except the butter, then add butter chunks and mix with a pastry cutter or a fork. Then you just sprinkle it on top right before you put it in the oven. I read another review about using this for French toast... I will be trying that next time I make it. Also, it makes your house smell amazing. Great recipe!

Make as directed before you change the ingredients.  It is delicious.  Then, if you think the recipe would benefit from additions, make it again and rate again.

As for the “most helpful” critical review:  "I didn't have any baking powder, so I added about 1/2 tsp of baking soda”,  at first I thought I was reading a   typo.  She substituted baking SODA for baking POWDER?  No wonder her bread didn’t turn out as expected!!!!!!

This is a very good coffee cake. I used 2 eggs, 1/2 c. melted butter instead of oil, added a tsp. vanilla. I also mixed up Much, Much more brown sugar and cinnamon to taste for the filling. I was afraid it was too much batter for my loaf pan so I divided it into two loaf pans and layered most of the cin-sugar filling into the middle of the loaves. My pans are dark/coated so I baked for 35 minutes at 325 degrees. I turned out very moist and tasty. I also added raisins and cinnamon to the batter for taste. I know I made a lot of changes but the base batter is very good. I will make it again.

Really liked this loaf but I did add and change a few things.  I reduced sprinkling sugar to 1/4 cup then added 1/4 tesp. each of nutmeg and ginger to the cinnamon.  In the batter I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and used brown instead of white sugar.  I added 1 tesp. vanilla and used applesauce instead of vegetable oil.  I also added 1 large golden gala apple, peeled and chopped, to the batter.  Wow, it was good.  Will definitely make this again.

I  made it exactly as is.  I agree with some reviewers that the topping would have been better with brown sugar, and a touch of vanilla  would give  it just the right kick.  

It's not my favorite recipe on ALLrecipes.  I But, its' definitely a good recipe.  Especially,  if you need something quick since ingredients are already in your pantry.

Horrible!  I couldn't believe how bad it turned out.  I am not a beginner and I could tell there was something wrong when the batter did not rise.  It came out like a brick.  So, I thought it must be the baking powder.  I threw out the baking powder that I had used and used a different brand.  Again, the same result.  Very disappointed.

Hi, Baked bread and it was identical to the pic. I offered it to my father. He loved it. But I kept pressing him as to whether he could taste the cinnamon. He said, yes. But I felt I could have added more cinnamon. I LOVED the crunchy areas. I think for the future it is a winner for Xmas gifts.

WOW!!!! This IS a keeper! I made the first one as written, and it was great. The next was changed slightly. Subbed half brown sugar, half white. Used applesauce instead of oil. And added extra cinnamon, a half TBS. Both were very well received, but the one with extra cinnamon was favored. I loved them both. My cinnamon was stick, that was freshly grated. If you are looking for a great, easy, flavorful bread, this is IT!  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!!

I made this cinnamon bread exactly as it was written. I really thought the base had no flavor. The cinnamon streusel was ok but definitely not enough as written. Even if I had doubled it as other reviewers suggested, I think it would have been just ok. The streusel was crisp on top, I needs butter maybe to make it softer.  Nobody in my house liked it enough for the calories so 2 days later I threw it away.

made the recipe as stated with the exception of adding a few chopped pecans to the topping.   excellent and easy.  i made it before reading other reviews and next time i will try using brown sugar instead of white for the topping to see the difference.

I took Jillian's suggestion and used brown sugar. Also added chopped pecans to the swirl and the topping. 
Plus for a healthy, low calorie option - replace the oil with applesauce. This keeps bread moist but the bottom/sides may be slightly tough.
Keep extra in the fridge and it softens back up.

Smells good during baking, and definitely after baking. I followed recipe, except looked at reviews and decided to use applesauce verse oil only for calorie content. My 4 year old helped me mix everything as was excited for a piece. She said she liked it. It was good, I wouldn't say Omg amazing

I think I made mine a bit too sweet. Subbed white sugar for brown and probably should've only did 3/4 cup or even half. Used cinnamon applesauce instead of oil, took about 50 mins, and I couldn't warrior the whole next day they, we ate it twenty mins after cooking it ahhaha

I subbed brown sugar for the cinnamon sugar mix, and took another reviewer's suggestion and made muffins rather than a loaf (to save time) and they turned out great! Bake at 400 for 20 minutes, and fill the tins right to the top - they rise beautifully and get a perfect muffin top :)

This recipe is delicious and simple! I like to pour my batter into muffin cups and cook them for about 30 minutes. This recipe makes great muffins! (I follow the marbling instructions as well when I do this, it always comes out perfectly!)

I made this last night and brought it to work today,  and it was a hit!  Everyone complemented me and when I tasted it I knew why - it was simply delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and baked for 45 minutes. Thank you for the recipe!

Second time making this, and it's very good. I did use an 8x4 pan, so you get a little higher bread. Mine was done at 38 min, so it's a good habit to check baked goods earlier because you never know. Also added 1 tsp of vanilla. After I topped it with the cinnamon mixture, I gently swirled the batter a few times with a dull knife. I'm doing other things, and made a mistake, forgetting to add the oil! I realized this after it was in the oven for several minutes. I can't believe it's still very good! I did replace the milk with non-dairy creamer (richer) that needed to be used up, so that may have helped, too. I'll also make up for it when I spread the bread with butter when I have it! Nice, easy recipe!

It was pretty good, but missing something in the white cake part. May try adding some vanilla next time.

Very tasty, and quick to make. The house smells amazing when the bead is baking.  I made it twice in two days, as family and friends enjoyed it throughly.    The only two things I did was added vanilla, and made a glaze for the top for presentation.

This cinnamon swirl cake came out sooo good! I did make some changes , instead of regular milk I used unsweetened almond milk and I also used a bit more cinnamon. The changes did not affect the recipe the bread came out moist and crumbly and with crispy bits of the cinnamon and sugar. I will definately be using this recipe over and over again!

Needed to use some yogurt and milk, so chose this recipe.  Used half milk and half vanilla yogurt.  Wanted to decrease baking time so used two 8X4 pans and used lots of cinnamon.  Moist and delicious.  Will make again.

The flavor is excellent, but the texture was very crumbly. I used whole wheat flour, which may have been part of the problem, but the top of the bread which had cinnamon sugar did not bake all the way and had loose sugar just lying in a cavern on top - I will ensure the entire top of the loaf is covered next time, so no cavern forms.

This is very good cinnamon swirl bread.  Like other reviewers said, I found this to be somewhat cake-like, so, if you are wanting bread consistency, I don't know if this recipe is for you.  I followed the recipe exactly, and some family members commented that the only thing that is odd about the bread is how the parts that don't have the cinnamon/sugar mixture aren't really sweet.  I don't know if the batter needs more sugar next time, or maybe a combo of brown and white sugar...or, instead of only two layers of batter make it three so more cinnamon/sugar mixture is throughout the bread?  I'm really not sure, but, when I make this again, I will definitely be doing one of those three modifications to make the batter sweeter.  The cooking time of 45-50 was spot on.

Made this morning and waited 20mins before trying. AWESOME! I'll never buy boxed again. So easy and soooo good. The only thing different was that I made in an 8x8 pan instead of the loaf pan and baked for 35 mins as instructed by another reviewer. (Thanks for the tip!) Thanks for sharing this recipe. It will be used often. :)

This was so fast and delicious!  Based on other reviews I upped the amount of cinnamon mixture, added a little bit of brown sugar to it, and cut the sugar in the batter to 3/4 cup, but I think it would have been great as written.  This one is a keeper!!!!

This is a great recipe, always very moist. I use 1/2 cup homemade yogurt and 1/2 cup milk instead of all milk.  Maybe that's why it is so moist.  I always add a teaspoon of vanilla.

This bread is very good and I would not hesitate to serve it to company.  Especially nice for afternoon tea.  Prepared exactly as directed with the exception of making a little more cinnamon/sugar mix for the top.  Wrapped tightly overnight.  The bread was moist and delicious the next morning.

I added raisins and chocolate chips to it once and it was great!

The next day, I made the recipe again (doubling it) and added raisins and white chocolate chips. With this batch I made muffins and a loaf of bread. 

Delish and so easy!

Great, easy bread. I would highly recommend reducing the sugar to less than 1/4 c. sugar for the topping portion and 1/4 c. for the cake portion. With that amount of sugar, it was still quite sweet... next time I will STILL use less. Used brown sugar for the topping and lots more cinnamon.

I made this yesterday and after reading some reviews I cut down on the sugar from 1 cup to 3/4 cup and used brown sugar in the cinnamon/sugar mix (only because I ran out of white sugar). It turned out great!  The only thing I didn't understand is why it needs to be wrapped in foil overnight before cutting into it?  It smelled so good I just wanted to try it while it was still warm!

Incredible bread!  I replaced the oil with applesauce to cut the fat and it is delicious.  It is so quick and easy to make.  It's great warmed up for breakfast or a quick snack.  It smells great and tastes even better!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was great! Exactly what I wanted. It's a cinnamon bun style quick bread. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used brown sugar instead of white, added more cinnamon, and added 1/4 cup of butter to the cinnamon/sugar mix. I also added vanilla to the batter. Thanks for the advice! 

I cooked it in a bread pan, so it took about an hour to bake, but it turned out perfect!

I gave this recipe 5 stars, even though I did a few things different..because it is a GREAT base recipe. I will be preparing this a lot...regularly for my family. Instead of 2 teaspoons cinnamon I used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp Chinese Five Spice. For the 1 cup of sugar added into the flour mixture, I used brown sugar instead of white. I forgot to add some vanilla, and I think it would be a wonderful addition to this batter bread. 

I am very pleased.

This is very good, very moist....reminds me of friendship bread without all the kneading bags, adding milk and waiting.  I have made it twice now.  The first time I couldn't wait overnight, so it was never wrapped in foil and I thought it was delicious.  The second time I waited and wrapped it in foil and the taste was the same but it didn't seem as crumby.  Quick and easy, nice for guests.

This was really tasty!!!! I used white sugar for the bread batter part & brown sugar for the cinnamon part. I also added chopped apples to the batter (I know its not the same recipe!) But I had some I had to use up & am trying to get more fruits into my toddler. He ate it right up too!! I served with cinnamon honey butter also from this site & it was soooo good :-)

Very good batter bread.  It's better after it sits in the refrigerator for a day or two (even three).  I preferred the texture of the bread after a few days - the flavor is great!  If you refrigerate it, let it come to room temperature before serving it.  I'll be making this regularly for my B&B.

I was originally going to give this bread a 3 star rating.  It was just too sweet and not cinnamon-y enough for me, although my husband loved it.  But then I went back for a second thin slice a couple hours later, and I liked it better.  This morning I had a slim piece and thoroughly enjoyed it.  So either it's better with age or better in very small amounts.  Either way, it's bumped it up to 4 stars.  I only did 2 things differently, I subbed applesauce for the oil and I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup in the batter to compensate for the natural sweetness of the applesauce.  The bread part tasted fine and was moist.  When I thought it was too sweet it was because I thought there was too much sugar in the cinnamon sugar mix.    I think a good variation on this would be to add pecans to the cinnamon sugar mix and chunks of apple to the batter.

Excellent recipe. Very quick and easy. I also used 2x the sugar for the swirl/topping and substituted brown sugar, and added a little vanilla extract. My husband loved it!

I followed the recipe to a T and yet something felt missing. The cinnamon flavor was great but it wasn't rich enough. Maybe I'll try butter instead of oil next time.

We thought this was very good, but just a tad bit on the bland side.  I don't know if it's because of the lack of butter in the recipe or what, but it just tastes like it's missing something.  Still a good bread though,

I made this for my family and they loved it. My boys are always eager to try any new recipes I may make and they absolutely loved this one. I did follow some of the other reviewers suggestion and added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar it came out great. The top of the bread had a nice golden brown look with a nice crisp taste. I recommend this recipe 100%.

I messed up and didn't see that it was supposed to sit overnight.  I didn't have anything else to serve for breakfast and my hubby was dying to have some (the house smelled sooo good!) so he ate it after it sat for 10 minutes.  I used brown sugar for the topping and then after it sat ten minutes, I made a cinnamon roll glaze and poured over it.  He said it was wonderful.

This recipe is so easy to make, not to mention delicious! I was having weekend overnight guests and wanted to try this recipe on my family beforehand. The first loaf was gone in no time, and the other loaf went just as quickly when I served it for brekfast for my guests. This bread is a keeper in my house.

May I recommend: make it as written. Indulge a little and use the oil. I made this for the first time tonight... since I already made one successful banana bread to share at work tmrw, I decided to try to play with this one. Instead of using applesauce, I used a baby food (pear & strawberry granola). Now, I know you're thinking I'm an idiot. The flavors really don't come through in the bread, but I think it completely messed up the texture. And what is a quick bread with weird texture? Really, I'll update tmrw if it's significantly different... otherwise, I think it might make a good French toast (set out to dry up a bit) or just toasted. I'll try again. It definitely has potential if you follow it correctly, I think!  ***Update: my coworkers loved it. They loved that it was low-fat and thought it was tasty. I guess it's just the texture that really throws me... if texture isn't a big deal to you... then try a pureed fruit in place of the oil. Also, i forgot to mention I used buttermilk. =)

Very easy to make, thats always a plus!  Also was very good.  In the cinnamon sugar mixture I subbed 1/3 cup of brown sugar, it was good but next time I will use regular sugar to see which combo is better.  Made the house smell great while it was cooking.

I'm not sure what it is about this recipe that is just not there for me. I love the idea of this bread. I wanted it to work out so badly that I made 2 batches.  The first one I prepared as the recipe directed and it was very blah. The bread part does not have much flavor at all and the cinnamon/sugar mixture needed something.  The 2nd batch I made I added a big splash of vanilla to the batter and to the cinnamon/sugar mixture, I added brown sugar.  For the milk part I used whole milk and then half n half.  I figured that the richness of the half n half would add more flavor or depth.  This improved things some but the cake part just does not have that much flavor still.  But wow, did my kitchen ever smell good while I was baking this bread!  Maybe I will have to play around some more with the recipe.  I would love to find the perfect combination of ingredients to make a similar bread.  The texture of this bread could use some improvement also.  I think I prefer a finer crumb - maybe I could use cake flour or maybe sift the ingredients? Anyways, the best part about this bread other than the smell is that it is SO quick to put together.  From the moment I walked in the kitchen, I had it prepared and in the oven baking in 15 minutes. Very fast preparation!  I made it in mini loaf pans and with 2 recipes completed, it only produced 5 mini loaf pans! That's not much for a double recipe.

I'm not sure why it's called bread but it was pretty good, anyway. I used an 8x8 baking dish and it rose beautifully an inch or so above the rim. It never spilled over either. I do believe there is a better coffee cake recipe out here somewhere, though. I, too, like a stronger cinnamon and used 1 Tbl to the half a cup of sugar.

i really liked this recipe. this is the first loaf bread i've ever baked, and it couldn't have been easier for a beginner. it came out perfectly and tasted great, even without butter. but i must admit, i wasn't able to wait overnight to slice it!

I love anything cinnamon and this bread is sooo good. Quick and easy to make. The only thing I changed was I ate it right after it cooled down a little, but still warm...yummy...there was no waiting for this, lol.

This is an easy, relatively quick and truly delicious bread. I wanted a sweet bread for Christmas morning that didn’t involve rising & used ingredients I already had in the kitchen. This one fit the bill. I made it gluten free by using Bob’s Red Mill 1to1 flour, and I did double the cinnamon sugar mix using half white & half brown sugar so I’d have a thick crunchy topping. The kitchen smelled so spicy & festive! I made it just before Christmas brunch today so it didn’t have time to sit but it still held together when sliced.

Did not get all half of the sugar mixture between the layers so the bottom half was very boring. Would have been better, but still will not be making again.

Very Good! A little too sweet for us. The second time I made it I lowered the sugar for the swirl to 1/4 cup and that worked out well.

I consider my self a decent cook and my friends and family would agree and even consider me a great cook. But this bread didn’t turn out! I followed the recipe exactly and I baked it for the length of time but it was gooey in the center. I gave it more time but it still seemed gooey. Finally I took it out. It tasted blah like it was missing something.

I used the advice of another cooks review and added 1/2 c butter instead of oil and 3/4 c milk.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla.  Kids LOVE it and a nice Saturday morning fall treat.

It is a really great recipe! All I have to say is if you do two loaves prepared separately make sure that you have extra time to cook it and pay attention to the instructions, especially waiting overnight to cut it because otherwise it's a lot harder to cut if you don't. I found it was a lot easier to use a bread slicing guide since I'm not good at cutting bread.

I’m a vegan so I put a little twist on the bread. Like other reviewers I substituted 2/3 cup applesauce for the butter/oil. I used 2 flax eggs in substitution for the eggs. Also, instead of white sugar I used brown sugar and coconut sugar. The recipe called for additional white sugar in the batter so I used bourbon maple syrup and coconut sugar instead. Turned out AMAZING. Will definitely make again.

It was ok. I followed the directions exactly but it was really dry and not yummy. I looked back to see if I missed something or followed incorrectly. But I didn’t. It’s ok but I won’t make it again.

Had been making another one forever, but this is my new easy go-to if I don't want to use sour cream.    Definitely better with addition of vanilla.

I will definitely make this bread again. The first time I made it, though, I forgot to swirl it and there was just a bunch of dry cinnamon on the top!

I love this bread, so easy to make but I do have a question.  Why does my bread sink in the center.  I am an accomplished baker (not bragging but I've been baking for over 50 years).  I've researched the problem and I've done everything that has been said, but the bread still sinks in the center.  if anyone can help I am all ears, this is driving me crazy.

I baked this yesterday and it was fantastic and super easy to make.  I used parchment paper to line the loaf pan sprayed with olive oil.  I also sprinkled a tablespoon of granulated sugar on the olive oil before adding the batter and cinnamon swirl.  So good.  Thank you Bettina!

I am so sorry I ate it all because now it’s gone. This was so easy and fun to make and kept very well wrapped foil in the refrigerator. I can hardly wait to share it with friends and family. Would make a nice gift.

I  used white sugar as specified but I think this would have been even better with 1/2 brown sugar.  The bread was very moist. It baked in about 43 minutes in my oven.  Great with coffee.

Extremely easy.  Make it exactly as written and you'll be so pleased.  The taste is amazing.  The texture is that of a light pound cake.  The amount of the cinnamon swirl is just right.
So quick to make, I can see making this recipe when unexpected company arrives.
(would be great as a muffin recipe too).
My family was too eager so we ate some as soon as it cooled.  The remaining, I did wrap in foil overnight.  It tasted great both times.  The benefit of wrapping overnight (IMO) just made it a little easier to slice as the top is crispy when it first cools.
Make this!!  You'll be so glad you did!

Very quick, easy, and delicious!  You could probably get away with 2/3 of the Cinnamon/Sugar mixture they call for.

This is a great and simple bread recipe. I doubled the amount of cinnamon, as we like a stronger cinnamon flavor.  Otherwise, it was perfect!

Pleasantly surprised at how this turned out. Only changes made were that I substituted brown sugar for white in the cinnamon blend, and did cake/cinnamon/cake/cinnamon/cake layers before swirling, then topped with an all-purpose Streusel mix that I originally got with a muffin recipe. The bit of butter and flour in the streusel gives a nice coating that I use with a few loaf recipes.
Additional note - added raisins for texture, turned out even better.!

I did try some the suggestions for this recipe.  Doubling the filling is a bit too much. But definately used the brown sugar for the topping.  I did add some melted butter to the "filling mix" for the very top.  Added about a tsp of vanilla extract to the batter.  Baked in to small loaf tins lined with baking paper-for about 25 min.  Perfect. 
Brought it to the ER-- staff loved it

I  added a tablespoon of brown sugar as well. Turned out delicious! Also a little more vanilla.  Made double batch and baked 3 smaller loaves instead of 1 large so I could share with my daughter and her family.  Really loved making this recipe and definitely will again!

This was a very simple and easy recipe and I did not make any changes, for me, that is not following the recipe as written.  If I decide to make the recipe again then I tweak it to my preferences. I however was disappointed with the results because when I tested to see if it was done the center collapsed and as yet I have no idea what went wrong.  I was very disappointed to say the least and yes It was edible and I enjoyed it as a messed up sweet bread snack. 
I found the dough to be very THICK and difficult to spread in the pan and with the second layer not sure why. I would make this again but I will have to tweak it just a bit.

I made this using artificial sugar and it was very good. My family could not taste the difference. I will be making this over and over because my husband and son are diabetic and this is the first thing that I have made with the artificial sugar that tastes great.

So simple and soooo delicious!
My family loved it so much I'm making another load.
I did sprinkle the sugar/cinnamon mixture on top but it's good without it. The swirls of cinnamon came through like a canvas. I didn't take a picture because it was gone before I could think about it.
Thank you so much for sharing this delicious easy recipe

Excellent. Very moist, with a nice crunch from the sugar and cinnamon !  I will definitely make this again, but I will use less sugar.

I made this the other day. It came out great. It only lasted one day. Now I have to make more. I did make one change to the recipe.  I used 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar. absolutely delicious.

I doubled the recipe and was so glad I did.  It was fantastic. Young and.old alike loved this bread. It's not to sweet,  but sweet enough to  satisfy.  Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent recipe! I have made it several times now, both as is and with minor changes. It works really well either way. 
Some changes that I have made successfully:
I have substituted brown sugar for the white mixed with cinnamon and increased the amount to 1/2 cup. I have doubled the cinnamon when I used Ceylon cinnamon (that has a milder flavour than the more common cassia cinnamon).  
I often use avocado oil instead of canola oil and have sometimes used 2 eggs and 3/4 cup milk and 1/2 cup oil in place of the milk plus 1 egg and 1/3 c oil.

Obviously this is an easy and quite adaptable recipe that can work even when short on an ingredient or two!

I made this exactly as written and it was very good.  The only thing I will change/try next time is the construction of the layers.  Most of the sugar/cinnamon on top did not cook or bake into the bread.  When I inverted the bread to remove from the pan, more than half it just fell off.  Next time I will layer 1/3 batter then topping, 1/3 batter more topping, 1/3 batter and just a small amount of topping on the third layer, so that it will hopefully cook into the batter on the top of the bread as it browns.  
I definitely will make this one again.  Thank you!

Made as directed. Super tasty recipe. More cake like than bread. Be careful to use the right size pan. I skimmed through the directions and my pan was too small so I had a very tall loaf. Still worked out though. I will definitely be making this again.

Oh my gosh!  Best cinnamon loaf ever.  Made it exactly as the recipe stated, changed nothing & my daughter couldn't wait the overnight stated in the recipe to eat it - actually none in my household could. Didn't even make it to the next day!

The best Cinnamon Bread EVER!  I am gluten free so I just substituted gluten free flour.  You cannot tell the different.  I have tweaked it a little bit, and you certainly can too, but, it's a fabulous recipe and everyone who has tried it, loves it.  They have no idea that there is gluten free flour in it.  A must-have for any occasion!

Easy and the whole family loves it. Only used 3/4 cup sugar in the batter just to cut down a tiny bit on the sugar and it was still delicious! Smells great baking. Oh, and I skip the part about wrapping and letting sit in the frig overnight before slicing! No issues. Smells and tastes too great to wait! :)

I didn’t make any changes to the recipe and it’s just ok. All the good reviews I read made changes. No offense , but giving a great review to a recipe that you’ve made a bunch of changes to isn’t a good indicator of how it will turn out if you make it as is. It was fine, but won’t make again.

I made this recently when we had family visiting us. It was eaten before the long weekend was over!  I made it exactly by the recipe, except I made half granulated and half light brown sugar. Bread was moist and really delicious warmed slightly every morning for breakfast.

Received this email today and made it today!  Then ate it today!  Why wait:)

Very simple.  Very moist.   Batter was very creamy.  Not sure what some reviewers are doing wrong.  I added a smidge of vanilla and brown sugar .   Every Sunday I make something for the family to munch on as they have their coffee and read the paper.  Thank you for this recipe!!!!

This bread was easy to make and tasted delicious.  I bake for my church group every Sunday and they loved it.  The only difference between my outcome and the picture was that the whole loaf was a little darker than that shown in the picture but the taste and consistency was perfect.

When I made it the first time, the batter was thick and not pourable!  I made it anyway and it was so dry!  I tried again but I made a couple of changes.  I added 2 eggs and a 1/4 cup more milk.  It was a pourable batter, cut in the cinnamon and baked.  It came out like bread and so much softer.  My husband loved it and so did I!

I used almond milk due to my lactose intolerance, and a smaller pan(8.5x6.5) resulting in a longer baking time(2.15 hours) but still came out great

This was very tasty and quick to make.  The only change I made was to add 1 tsp of vanilla.  I will definitely make this again and maybe next time add some chopped nuts.  Great with coffee in the morning.

Used brown sugar instead of  white sugar in the cinnamon mixture. I also added lemon zest and juice of half a lemon into the liquids. It turned out fantastic!

This was very good! I made it exactly as directed. My bread was a tiny bit gooey in the center towards the top. I did not wrap in foil to sit for the night so maybe that why. I’ll just leave it in the oven for a few extra minutes next time. I will be making this again

I decided to make this as written and it's wonderful just the way it is, no changes are necessary!  This will be my Christmas gift bread to the family members this year.  I like that it's a simple bread without the extra add-ins that many quick breads have...just cinnamon and sugar.  Very cost effective for gifting, yet impressive.  Thanks Bettina!

So delicious that I had to make more in a matter of days!! Definitely agree it's best to wait until the next day to try it. Like some other reviewers, I added a tsp of vanilla to the batter and some crushed pecans and brown sugar to the topping mixture. Very easy to make! Mine baked for a full hour.

Made this for a dessert  for friends and it was a hit. I did use brown sugar and doubled it for additional swirl and topping  and added a few pecans.  I love how quickly this recipe come together.  A definite keeper.

This is really good.  More like a coffee cake though.  I used 3 tablespoons of cinnamon for the sugar that you swirl in.  I used all brown sugar. I added 1 teaspoon of real vanilla.  Next time I will grease the pan a bit more and add an extra egg.  I also used unsweetened almond milk.  I wrapped it in plastic wrap and then in a ziploc bag once cooled.  I baked it for 50 minutes in a 10x6 pan. It's fairly moisture and not overly sweet.  I think it's really good.  Adding the extra egg next time will add moisture.   I consider this a keeper.

This is a great recipe!!  I also doubled the crumb mixture, used brown sugar with nutmeg and added the 1 tsp vanilla with the egg mixture.  Tried it t home then made it for two pot luck events to rave reviews.  Easy, great taste.  WINNER!!

Perfect as is!  Played with it for additional loaves because it’s fun!  Used half oil/applesauce.  Added vanilla because it’s VANILLA!  And added an extra egg.  Did the cinnamon sugar inside with white sugar and did the top with brown sugar a touch of nutmeg and cloves and cut in some butter.  Also put in funfetti white chips.  Only because my family has a crazy sweet tooth!  These are just my notes because I don’t want to forget!    You really can’t go wrong with this recipe as submitted above!

This recipe is good as is. I agree that anything else added (e.g. vanilla) is not going to make a big difference. I do however try a slow baking because despite that I followed instructions to a T regarding pan size and temperature, I had to add extra time for baking it because it was not done at the given time. My only change then would be to bake it at 350 and then lower it to 325 for 15 or 30 minutes to let it finish baking inside. If I do it the other way around, I would bake it at 325 for 30 minutes and 350 for the last 20 and if for some reason is not yet done inside, then I would lower it back to 325 and let it bake for 15 more minutes. This is a dense but moist cake that goes excellent with coffee!

Excellent!  I thought the ingredients looked familiar and it turns out, this is my favorite, go-to coffee cake recipe doubled and baked in a loaf pan!  It's fantastic with the cinnamon swirled through it!  It's so moist and deceptively rich for the small amount of fat in it.  I've actually used this recipe as a yellow layer cake (without the swirl) when I need one in a hurry because it's so easy to put together.  It's not fine crumbed like a cake, but frosted it's so delicious and moist, nobody cares about the larger crumb!  I'll be making it this way again..the loaf is lovely with  that swirl of cinnamon sugar rippling through it.  Thanks, betina!

Used applesauce instead of oil, and it the applesauce taste was too strong. Bread was very dense and heavy. I have a recipe for cinnamon swirl bread I like better.

I had to add 5 minutes to the cook time and I did more than one layer of cinnamon sugar.  My family loves it. I usually have to make 4 loaves at a time to cover everyone and make it last more than a day.  Very easy to make.

This is a great dish for when you don't have a lot of time but want that home cooked meal at the end of the day. Even though the ravioli already has the cheese inside, we'd like to add a thin layer of cottage cheese, which makes it even creamier. Probably just a Midwestern thing, LOL. But leftovers are few and far between when we serve this dish.

Does anybody actually wrap this in foil to slice the next day?? Not me! This was delicious and a keeper. I did add a vanilla glaze just because. Will double recipe next time and freeze one. Thanks for the recipe!

I increased the amount of cinnamon sugar as others did and used brown sugar instead of white. I also substituted 1/2 cup honey for white sugar in the bread. The loaf was delicious, very moist. I will make this again. Thanks.

Added a bit more oil and some vanilla in the batter and used brown sugar and a bit more cinnamon in the swirl as mentioned in other reviews and my coffee cake came out really good. My personal taste calls to use a bit less sugar in the batter. I really appreciate the recipe and the added comments that led me to this fabulous coffee cake.

I've been making a very similar recipe for years.  The only difference, you use a teaspoon of vanilla in the batter.  After you remove from the oven and let cool for 30 min, you drizzle it with a simple orange glaze using orange juice, powdered sugar, 1 melted tablespoon butter and  orange zest.  It's very festive and worthy of any holiday breakfast table.

This is so easy to make and SO delicious to eat. This will be a regular go to for me. Took about 55 minutes to bake, used the suggested brown sugar with the cinnamon. 
Have to walk away before I scarf down the rest of the loaf!

The first time I made it per directions. It took way over an hour to bake. The 2nd time I made it, I added blueberries and sprinkled brown sugar on the top. That turned out excellent!! It takes about 1 hour and half to bake. Will make again.

Made this over the weekend to bring into work as a dry run for a fundraiser later in the year. It went together very easily - as quick breads do! I was skeptical about the amount of baking powder with no acidic component to activate the leavening, but it rose so no worries there.  Like other reviewers, I made the cinnamon topping with brown sugar and doubled the amount; however, when I applied it to the bread, it was WAY more than needed. So I did have some left over that I put on other baked goods this weekend. It turned out beautiful. Good crumb, easy to cut and serve. Very well received from the test subjects at work! Thank you for the recipe bettina.

I made this according to the recipe, didn't change a thing. It took 55 min in my oven. Because of the sugar in it I wouldn't call it a bread, but neither is it a cake; it's somewhere in-between. We loved it!
Next time I will swirl the cinnamon sugar through after I pour in the first layer, then swirl again after the second layer as the bottom didn't have much of the cinnamon mixture in it.
I think I will also add a spoon of yogurt to the batter and increase the cinnamon from 2 tsp to 3 tsp but that's because I love cinnamon!
It's definitely worth baking this bread/cake.

We love this coffee cake in a loaf pan!  I followed the recipe except for the following:  used half buttermilk and half milk, added a tsp of vanilla to batter, additional cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg to the topping/filling along with about a cup of crushed pecans. Since I made two loaves, I tried 3 layers in one and 2 in the other. Both were good.  An excellent recipe that can be easily adapted to one's tastes.   I’m thinking that I’ll top my next loaf with  a simple glaze once it’s out of the oven and cooled.  Thanks to Bettina and all who’ve suggested changes!

NO changes made and I followed the instructions exactly....I will make it again it was a very enjoyable bread/cake and really easy to make

Initially I wondered why you'd need to wait until the next day to eat it well you don't but it is amazing when you do and just great when you don't :-)

Quick and easy to make. Everyone enjoyed it and want to know when I'll make it again. Did not make any changes but I might increase the sugar & cinnamon mix.

I thought I'd already commented but oh well. Everyone raves since I found this recipe. I have made it so may times already. Only thing different is I substituted using 3 Quaker instant maple cinnamon oatmeal packets for the oatmeal. I could eat the entire loaf - ha! Best banana bread recipe I've come across, thank you!

I mostly followed the recipe except that I used a 50/50 split with sugar and brown sugar plus I substituted applesauce for the oil.  The bread itself was moist and delicious, the outside crust was tough - not hard but tough.  I was careful not to over stir the mixture also.
I will make this again and not use the brown sugar to see if this changes the crust.  I substitute the applesauce for oil in almost every recipe so I do not think that was the issue.

I really liked this recipe. I needed to add 15 minutes of cooking time and I put a few tabs of butter on top prior to removing it from the oven, because the sugar on top was just pouring off all over the place.

I made this and my family LOVED it. The only thing I did differently is instead of 2tsp of cinnamon I did a tablespoon (basically 3tsp) because my 4 year old and I  love cinnamon.  It turned out wonderful. There is still a little left but not much.

A little too sweet for me - I made it as written, but would use 1/4 cup less sugar. I didn't like the taste of the vegetable oil, so would substitute olive oil or butter. It was simple to make and moist.

Loved this and so did my family.  I altered a bit..
.doubled the sugar  cinnamon mixture and used brown sugar
Used brown sugar cinnamon mixture on top...what a wonderful crunchy sweet loveliness it is
I used butter instead of oil
Added vanilla and lemon extracts

Does this freeze well after baking?

Even when all I had was cream instead of milk, this was great. I used applesauce instead of oil, as so many have, and could have upped it to 1/2 cup. But nice recipe, very flexible - will add nuts next time. Thanks!

I added chopped pecans on the layer of cinnamon in the middle. It was really delicious. May try adding vanilla or almond extract next timed, just to see what it does. Baking time was longer that shown, it was about 60 minutes.

I made this exactly to the recipe provided.  It was, according to my husband, "edible".  I did not care for it at all.  In my opinion, this recipe needs a lot of tweaking.  It is pretty though.

I made this today and it was terrible tasting.  It took so much longer to bake than posted.  The middle was doughy.  We tried to eat the outside pieces and it was just tasteless.

I thought this was very very bland, I made according to the directions.  It's just missing something.  The consistency & texture was good.  I had to cook quite a bit longer than the directions as well.  My 11 year old didn't care for it either.

Full details with pictures are on my instagram @cookingwithderah I’m loving it!!!

I thought this was tasty, but it is definitely more of a coffee cake than a bread. I also added about a tsp of vanilla to the flour mixture and a little sprinkle of nutmeg to the cinnamon sugar mixture. Thank you for the recipe.

The flavor was good, but the dough was rather bready and dry, and it really didn’t rise at all. I was wondering about other reviews that said this was moist. I baked it for 42 minutes, but maybe could use less time. Next time I’ll use 2 eggs and increase the oil (I used coconut oil).

Yummy! This was so easy to prepare and tasted fabulous and moist. I too doubled the cinnamon/sugar topping and I added 2 tablespoons to it so it would be like a crumble. Substituted brown sugar for white, added 1 teaspoon vanilla and a teaspoon of lemon juice to my milk for a buttermilk version. I had fresh blueberries so why not add that to o?! GREAT!

This was pretty good. I replaced the vegetable oil with coconut oil and the sugar topping with brown sugar. I skipped the step of wrapping it up in foil overnight...just couldn’t wait to try it! Thanks for a yummy simple recipe.

We really liked this bread!!  Of course I made a few changes, but not to the basic recipe.  I added candied pineapple bits and coconut to it, then baked it as muffins.  They were richly flavored, moist, crispy on the outside and very tender inside, and pretty much ran off the plates by themselves.  I can hardly wait to try this again with apples or pears.

I made this as specified.  The "swirl" made for a gooey center that fell to the bottom of the pan.  Maybe I didn't swirl it enough, but I thought I did.  Outside was delicious, however.

This recipe was very easy to make.Super moist and delicious. I will definitely make this again . My family loved it and ate every crumb. I did add 1 tsp of vanilla, however, that is just a personal preference, not necessarily required.

Wow. Very pleased and surprised. Was as good as my favorite coffee cake but less ingredients, faster,  and easier. Rather than 1 cup of milk  I used 1 cup of plain greek yogurt and then added just enough coconut milk for right consistency.   Also added 1 tsp vanilla.  Had to bake a full 60 minutes due to the yogurt. Firm, but extremely good consistency and sooo moist. Amazing loaf. Will make great gift! I'm sure it would be delicious with no changes, just wanted to use up the yogurt. This will be a favorite. Thanks for a perfect recipe.

This was very good.  The only thing I changed was to use brown sugar instead of white sugar for the swirl filling.

I followed the recommendations of others that said to mix the wet ingredients together, then mix the dry ingredients together, then stir them together until they're combined well.  Then I doubled  the topping ingredients as recommended by other raters and poured half of the bread batter in the pan, followed by 1/2 of the topping and then the rest of the batter and the rest of the topping.  I forgot to swirl the knife through the bread batter and topping before I baked it, but it was still really good.

If you want cinnamon bread , you don't need to change this . very good. very easy, made exactly as written.  If you rate it 5 stars and make several changes,  you are rating a different recipe.

I modified this recipe a bit for commercial sales. I had been looking for a good recipe to act as a base and this one was excellent. One thing I did was coat the top with the cinn/sugar mix so it makes a nice crunchy layer on top of the bread. I also made more layers inside. i.e. batter bottom, cinn/sug, batter layer, more cinn/sug, but only right down the middle of the layer. Otherwise, it will run out the sides when it bakes. This makes a really gooey layer in the middle.

My daughter and I made this collaboratively for holiday gifts.  It took a couple of tries, because we were unsure how many "mini loaves" each batch would make.
As it turns out, each batch made three small wonderful loaves.  We did use brown sugar for the swirl, but followed the rest to the letter of the recipe.  Thanks for such an easy, tasty treat!

9 14 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/23376/cinnamon-swirl-bread/ ... Yummy, but not so pretty.  First time I'm not sure if I didn't swirl, but I don't remember it being as issue as it was this time.  I deeply swirled in an enlarging oval.  'Looked fine before baking, but after, the typical quickbread crack was indented, not rounded or even flat.  Soooo, my thinking is swirl the bottom layer, then the top one; or not at all; with some cinnamon added to the batter.  I only used 2T cinnamon-sugar on each layer.  (This is a variation ... http://allrecipes.com/personal-recipe/63704315/cinnamon-swirl-bread/ ... )

I put 1teaspoon of baking soda and used heavy cream instead of regular milk, I also buttered the pan, and layered the mixture, alternating the cinnamon and the batter, starting with the batter, then the cinnamon, so fourth and so fourth, until I ended up with the cinnamon/sugar mixture on top, I let it bake half way, then I put streusel topping, and let it finish in the oven, so moist inside, with slightly crispy edges, I would've taken a picture, but by the time I finished this review, so was the bread....

I made two of these for Thanksgiving the other day and both were gone within 15 minutes!  This is a easy and simple recipe that will have everyone asking for more!  I also added a little vanilla extract to the batter mix.  In addition, I coated the loaf in melted butter and sprinkled the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the entire loaf for added flavor.  I'll definitely be making more soon!

I doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves. I also add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to enhance the flavor. This bread makes the house smell wonderful. We like it warm with a little unsalted butter spread on it for a snack but it's great cold without the butter.

I'd make it again. I used butter not oil, and didn't use all the cinnamon sugar. Just spread half the batter into the pan, sprinkled in some cinnamon sugar to coat, then the other half of the batter and sprinkled the rest on top - it gives it a nice crumble like texture. I'd like to make this again but with cocoa sugar instead, just for fun. Everyone here liked it. Reminded me of my family recipe. Don't over mix it - fold it until there isn't really any dry flour in the bowl, and it stays light and moist.

Put it this way: I made this last night for my church's ingathering service & picnic this morning. The only change I made was to substitute applesauce for the oil. By the time I got to the food line, there was no sign of my bread -- it was long gone! Luckily it was as super easy to make as it looked. Clearly I'll need to make another for my family.

Loved this bread! I used brown sugar for the cinnamon swirl and it was perfect. The tastiest quick bread I've ever had.

Perfect crusty cinnamon swirl bread (or coffee cake). Added a little bit of vanilla extract and followed everything else to a T.

Absolutely delicious! SO easy! Light, fluffy and wonderful hot. I used an 8x8 baking pan instead of a loaf pan (because I don't have one), cut the baking time to 40 minutes and just....wow.

I made this and loved it. Because I have several food allergies, I used gluten free baking mix, almond milk, and Splenda in place of the flour, milk, and sugar.  My husband even liked it, and he's pretty finicky about sweets like this.

Made this recipe as is and it was awesome!  Next time I might reduce the amount of sugar topping as it was a bit to much for me.

Just made this and had to have a piece right away. Sooo good!  Looks awesome, too!  I followed the directions (I made THIS recipe...not a 'sort of this' recipe like some people post about) without any changes, only I used an 8 x whatever pan because that's what I have. Was perfect after 45 minutes. Very impressed with this, and I'm sure I'll be making it a lot!

I tweaked it a tad and added two tablespoons of brown sugar to the mix you sprinkle in, and also layered everything more. I can never keep this around for longer than a half an hour once it is finished, it is so good.

This bread turned out ok for me. I wasn't wowed by it, but it was good. A bit boring with just a cinnamon taste. Maybe I was looking for more flavors.

This was ok. I found the baking time to be off, it took over an hour to bake in my oven and the center was still raw. I found that the batter itself needed more flavor so I added cinnamon to the batter and increased the amount of cinnamon in the cinnamon/sugar mix. A nice, sweet bread that's good for dessert that just needs some adjustments, imho, to warrant 4 or 5 stars. Thanks for sharing!

This bread turned out awesome!  It reminds me of the cinnamon coffee cake we make during the holidays.  I added chopped walnuts to the cinnamon sugar mixture which turned out to be a nice addition.

I needed something easy, inexpensive and delicious to make for my cowokers for our staff meeting this week. This bread did the trick! Everyone has been raving about it, saying it's just the right amount of sweet. *I substituted brown sugar for white sugar in the bread itself, but still used white sugar for the topping and swirl.*

Easy and delicious.  This is a great quick, sweet bread.  Moist and good flavors.  I didn't change anything, and it came out wonderfully.  I broke my ankle, so I only have one good foot, so you know it's easy if I can do it! :)

Super easy prep. I think I did everything right, except I didn't put enough cin/sug in the middle of the layers..  so it doesn't look very cinnamon swirly. 
It isn't the most amazing thing ever, but it isn't the worst! I'll probably try again sometime..  
Thanks. :)

I made this today, following other suggestions of doubling the cinnamon mixture and mixing it with brown sugar. I don't have patience when there's yummy smelling food on my counter, so there was no sitting overnight in foil. It was AMAZING!! And so easy to make! The reason I only gave it 4 stars is I think it could use a little fine tuning. Next time I want to try adding some apple. Thanks!!

I made this and did not care for it.  It was easy to make but I gave it away.  I wrapped it in foil for 24 hrs but still did not care for it.  My friend liked and appreciated the bread.  I will not make again.

Great recipe.  Moist and delicious.  I doubled the cinnamon sugar mixture and used brown sugar in place of the white sugar.  I swirled it with a butter knife.  It came out beautiful.

Nice recipe. My Son made it as written & it came out ok. It was quite dry even after being covered some breads soften but this one didn't. It actually seemed to get harder. Ok with coffee but not that great.

Excellent! This recipe is so easy and comes out perfect every time! I've made it three times and it was a huge hit each time! There were never any leftovers!

Update: I've been using this recipe for over a year now and it's still everyone's favorite dessert! My friends and family request it constantly! I actually have the recipe memorized now because I've made it so much!

Excellent recipe. Super easy to make. Tastes like a coffee cake. It worked out perfectly just as the recipe is.

Great bread! I did cut the sugar by about a fourth cup, and it was still delicious. I also used aplesauce and just a little vegetable oil, and it was very moist.  I was craving something cinnamon-y, and this hit the spot without being horrible for me.

This recipe is good, but definitely more cake-like than bread-like. It tastes a lot like coffeecake and is decent. A big plus for this recipe is that it's quick and easy and uses ingredients that most people already have on hand.

I must have done something wrong, because it completely fell apart when I was taking it out of the pan and the bottom stuck to the pan.  I used a glass loaf pan, maybe that's why.  But I haven't had that trouble with any other bread I've made in that pan.  The bread is really crumbly and impossible to cut.  But I tasted it and the flavor is good when you get a bite with the cinnamon/sugar in it.  I might try to make it again when I can concentrate better and am not worrying about my 2 and 3 year olds ripping the house apart! Bread slices much better this morning.  Tastes really good.  I will try this bread again!

This is the easiest bread I have ever made and it is so tasty!  Even my picky husband who doesn't particularly like homemade bread loves it and requests it all the time.  I love baking it with cinnamon and sugar smothered on top.  Goes great with coffee.

yum, yum, yum!!! This bread is so easy to make and it comes out great.  My husband is a bread lover, so when i'm wanting to score some extra points i just whip this one up! Maybe I'll try subbing the oil for applesauce next time.

Everyone that has tried the recipe has fall in love with it. The one thing that I do different is 1/8 c of brown sugar and 1/4 c of white instead of 1/3 c white sugar.

This bread was so easy to make. I did have to bake mine much longer than the recipe said to get a toothpick to come out clean, but it still turned out really moist and delicious. The hardest part was waiting overnight to eat it. I will make this again!!! My husband has requested that I add raisins next time, and judging from other reviews, it'll be great!

I wanted to make raisin cinnamon bread so bad but thought I had ran out of yeast. So I tossed in some raisins at the end must of been at least 2/3 cup. My cousin was coming over for breakfast the next morning. So I followed this recipe using unbleached bread fl & at least a 1/2 of the fl I used w.w., I used aluminum-free baking powder, & half & half for the milk. The next morning I used this loaf for French toast with the mix I had (2/3 cup half & half, 4 eggs, 2 Tblsps pure maple syrup, 1 tsp. vanilla, pinch salt) I didn't need to add anything to it it was soo amazingly good just like that. The only thing that stopped me from eating it was getting too full. My cousin was so impressed too. We both thought we were in heaven when we ate this.

This was delicious! Like others I made my own changes to make it healthier but I can guarantee it would get 5 stars with or without the healthy changes. I made it for a breakfast to me for my birthday & my kids were so happy. The only thing is it took more like an hour to bake than 45-50 min so after 45 min I covered it with foil just to make sure the top didn't burn. Best cinnamon bread ever!!!

Really awesome and with so little ingredients.  I made a little extra topping (used half brown sugar and half white) and swirled a little raspberry preserves through the middle.  This was super moist and delicious and I love how it didn't require butter to make an awesome crumb swirl.  I did have to cook it a bit longer than stated probably because I used a glass loaf pan.  This will definitely be my go to cinnamon bread.  Thanks.

I thought this was good--not great, but good.  I thought the amount of cinnamon was just right.  Whenever you have a craving for something cinnamon-y, this will definitely fit the bill.  Thank you for sharing!

Had a lot of trouble getting the center to cook in a glass bottom bread pan. Took an extra 20 minutes and it was still mushy. Tasty though.

So I decided to take this recipe to the next level.  Instead of a loaf pan, I used a bunt pan and turned it into a cake.  For the final touches, I whipped up a vanilla glaze with some cinnamon, nutmeg and ground cloves mixed in.  The result was both very pleasing to the eyes and the taste buds.  :-)

Delicious Flavor and super easy.  My only complaint was that it was not done cooking in the alotted time, so I had to keep putting it back in the oven which took an extra 20 minutes, which resulted in a dry outside moist inside.  
This was more a loaf to me than a bread.

I'm not sure what is meant by mixing until moist.  I mixed it to just shy of creamy.  Also I didn't marble the cinnamon sugar mixture as much as I could have and I think the bread would have turned out better.  

All in all, the recipe is extraordinarily simple and yeild great bread.

This was good bread, although mine came out a little doughy despite baking it for about 55 minutes.  I substituted applesauce for the oil and used a combo. of brown and white sugars for the topping.

Company worthy!!  We didn't let it sit overnight.  I pulled it out of the oven before we left for church, and we gobbled it up as soon as we got home.

I would add a tsp of vanilla next time.

This is delicious.  It does have the texture of banana bread or muffins but I really like it! I also think this is a good basic batter to add in any types of fruits or spices you would like.  Thank you!

This was very easy to make and very good. I replaced the oil with applesauce to help lower the fat and it kept the bread super moist.

I have three kids (6,5,3yo). My oldest and I made this yesterday when they had a snow day. It's all gone and I didn't even get any!!! It did smell wonderful and was nice and soft. All three of them LOVED it.

Very good recipe. The whole house smelled wonderful while it was cooking. I did add a bit of vanilla and freshly ground nutmeg, becuase that is what my family likes. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a no go for me. It wanted to stick to my bread pan and the taste was terriable. To much sugar mix for me. Sorry, but this won't be in my recipe book!

I recently tried this recipe, and it was fantastic.  I did substitute half of the sugar for brown swugar, but that only made it tastier!  Great recipe.

OMG!!!  So delicious.  I didn't read the whole instructions though, and was upset that I needed to wait until the next day to eat it.  But oh was I happy the next day when I woke up and remembered I had made it!  So good!!!

Wasn't that good of a bread.  The outside was very tough and burnt, we picked out the center and ate that, but it still wasn't the greatest.  I would say it has to cook for less time, but I doubt we will be fixing this again.

Great bread! I added more cinnamon and sugar. The top burned a bit, but that's because my oven is really bad.

This was a very good bread. My 2 year old loved it! Next time will bake it for less time.
