My kids and friends really love these.  Vey easy and much better than regular tacos because you omit all the chopping of toppings...these are great all by themselves.  Please let beef filling cool because the pie crust will tear up as stated in previous review.

Very quick! Make sure you cool the beef mix before you add to the pie shell. I didn't and the hot beef went through the pie shell on my first one. The next three turned out perfect. Next time I will add about a 1/2 cup of refried beans. My  kids loved it!! Thank you!
