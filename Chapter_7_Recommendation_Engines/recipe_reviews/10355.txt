Variation: used lemon vest instead of orange. Formed into "logs", after cool dipped bottom in white chocolate and 1/2 bath in milk chocolate disks.  Chopped walnuts very fine in food processor and folded into dough.  Great flavor, will definitely try again with orange zest.  Great cookie!

I used zest from mandarin oranges and added a 1/2tsp dried lavender flowers. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The cookies turned out fluffy and chewy. I'm a crunchy fan 100%! Some had more of a salt flavor than others. I'm going to get this right eventually!

I used pecans instead of walnuts, and added a splash of orange juice before adding the flour. After I baked the cookies, I dipped the bottom into white chocolate. They baked into not too thin and not too thick cookies that stay soft. I did not refrigerate my dough.
