Wow these were great! In fact, I'm eating one right now.  The really cool part about it was that I happened to have all 5 indredients on hand and was able to whip these up in a flash.  These taste just like the ones my grandma used to make.  Sadly, they were not a favorite of the kids mainly because of the almonds, but oh well.  This just means there are more cookies that I don't have to share!!  Thanks for the great recipe.

The list of ingredients was simple, but the cookies ended up being a bit too dry for my taste.  That being said, I think they will be wonderful served with tea and I agree that they have a very adult flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

Love it, but I was afraid that it wouldn't have much taste taking from what the others were saying so I added 2 spoons of brown sugar. It was awesome, and easy to do.

Quick and tasty!  As described, it does have an "old fashioned" flavor, but I did not find it boring.  It is very similar to Mexican Wedding Cookies.

These were a quick and easy treat!  I read the reviews from other users about the cookies coming out too dry so I was mindful of that when they were baking and took them out slightly earlier than the time listed here.  They were a delicious snack to have with tea!
