I needed something quick for dinner tonight and this fit with what I had on hand.  I wish I would have read the reviews first, I agree that it was too salty.  I did it different though.  I mixed the soup mix with some seasoned bread crumbs.  I dipped the tenders into the butter then into the soup mix and crumb mixture and then put it into the pan.  I drizzled the left over butter over the top of the tenders then put into the oven.  They were tasty and quick.  Next time I may reduce the soup mix to cut some salt.

I made this because it was such a quick meal to fix...This recipe is a good example of the importance of not being in a hurry! Way too salty...overpowering flavor from the onion soup packet. Not very good at all.

This was surprisingly good.  I did think it was too salty as well from the mix.  I would advise to use 1/2 as well.

Really surprisingly tasty and satisfying.  I omitted the extra salt & pepper and only used 1/2 packet for 4 chicken breasts.  Just sprinkle on as you would any seasoning, you'll know when to stop.  Pour the melted butter on first so you don't wash off the soup mix, but go easy enough on the butter that the onions have a chance to get crispy.  I served w/ plain white rice and a salad.  4 breasts only took 23 minutes to bake, by the way.

Quick and easy recipe.  I read the other reviewers comments, and only used half of the onion soup mix, cutting out the additional salt altogether.  I also served it with plain couscous, which toned down the saltiness of the chicken.  All in all, it came out tasty.

We really enjoyed this dinner.  The only change I made was to not add the additional salt as the onion soup mix already has plenty of salt.  It is a very quick dinner to put together.  Lay the chicken in pan, pour over butter and soup mix and pop in the oven.  While the chicken was baking I made white sticky rice to go with the chicken, and "Skillet Cabbage" from this site.  Dinner was good and I will make this recipe again.  Thanks Kim in Oklahoma for sharing your chicken recipe.

I made this as the recipe calls, only I added about a cup of sliced mushrooms to it.  Chicken was most and flavorful, but too salty (I did not add any salt).  The gravy it made was nice with mashed potatoes.  It was OK, not bad for so little work.

Another variation of this is to cut out 1/2 cup of water and to add 1/2 cup of sherry.  It really adds flavor and the chicken is still really tender.

Made recipe as is except that I added a piece of swiss cheese on top.  Really too salty, next time I will not use salt, and I will mix soup mix with water first.Husband still liked it, though.

Very tasty for such a simple and easy-to-prepare recipe. I made it exactly as written, and enjoyed it a lot. One suggestion though: the sprinkled-on soup mix didn't "cook in" totally. If I were to make this again, I might try mixing the soup mix and the melted margarine in a bowl (probably making it a little pasty), and then brush it onto the chicken strips. Just a minor point. This recipe has a lot of flavor and versatility - thanks!

I made this today. The flavor is wonderfulâ€¦but I wouldn't add any more salt to it. Butter has salt and so does the soup mix; it would have been way too salty. My daughters, age 7 and 9, loved it. Served it with a fairly plain baked potato and salad. Delicious!!!

This was a good quick recipe that we have used several times.  Its a little salty if your not a big salt fan but great for a quick dinner when cooking is not something you feel like doing.  Thanks

The kids loved it..I think next time I'll use real butter. The margarine had a funny taste to it...it's fresh though, I just bought the package of margarine last week. I omitted the extra salt after pouring the margarine on...just peppered it. The onion flavoring was good and the chicken was fork tender. Overall, good recipe and a cinch to make...thanks Kim in Oklahoma!

Really good, I only used half the onion soup mixture, omitted the salt, and added garlic.  Fast and easy, I even had it ready to cook, left for a class and my husband put it in the oven and had it ready for when I got home!

I loved this; quick, easy, and tasty.  I followed the suggestions of others, halved the onion soup mix, did not add salt or pepper, and used the bread crumbs.  Delicious!

I made this for my family last night and we really enjoyed it.  I did make a little change since I didn't have any butter on hand.  I decided to "bread" the chicken with the onion soup mix and some bread crumbs.  It was very good!

This was so delicious and very easy! Like many other people here, I left out the salt and only used about half a pack of the onion soup mix. I threw in a few fresh mushrooms and it was outstanding! This is one of those meals that looks and tastes like much more work than it actually was.

This is an incredibly easy way to prepare chicken!  I took the reviewers' advice and cut down on the onion soup mix, and it ended up tasting great!  I served it with cheesy hash brown casserole and a vegetable.  It made a good weekday meal.

My husband loved this.  In fact, it's the only dish
he's specifically asked me to cook again.  I thought
it was a little salty, so I think I'll cut out any extra
salt next time.  It was, however, VERY tender and very 
easy to make.  Thanks!

We thought it was too salty (and I love salt!). Would reduce the amount of dry soup mix next time. Also found it to be dry. Would add either a mushroom or onion gravy next time. Served it with orzo spinach pilaf and green beans with almond slivers. Would serve it over mashed potatoes with gravy next time.

This turned out pretty good.  I made it with chicken breasts instead and just adjusted the recipe a bit.  It is nice and easy with very few ingredients!

WOW, so impressed by how this turned out!!  I changed it up a bit, but am giving it 5 stars due to ease & taste.  I had frozen chicken breasts to use up, which sometimes don't turn out so well after thawing, but this turned out REALLY good!  I cut the chicken breasts into strips, dipped them in melted butter, then into a mixture of onion soup mix & bread crumbs. Drizzled the extra melted butter over the strips, then baked at 350 for around 20 minutes. I did not add extra spices.  Even my husband said they were really good!

WAY TO SALTY!!!!  I even omitted the salt as per other reviewers and it still had way to much salt.  That was the overwhelming taste in your mouth. It made it almost inedible. We had to remove the coating before we could stand to eat it.  Will never make this again.

This recipe really didn't do much for us. The soup mix made the chicken way too sweet for our tastes. I don't think I'll be making this again, but thanks anyway.

Like the other reviews, this was a tad bit salty for my taste. I think next time I'll use a lot less soup mix. But, my chicken was tender and moist-just perfect! I'll give this recipe another try!

I agree that this was salty, but I enjoy salt so it was great for me! I doubled the recipe, but only used 1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp of margarine. It was delicious, and I would definitly make this again!

I substituted light sour cream for the margarine.  It came out well with less fat. I thought it was tasty for such a quick & easy dish.  I will probably make this at least once a month.

I cut the onion soup with plain bread crumbs. My only complaing is that the breading was soggy; I fixed that by turning up the temp to 400 for about 10 minutes. Nothing special; I like my own recipe of butter & Italian flavored bread crumbs cooked at a higher temp better.

It was really, really salty and very strong, almost overpowering with onion.  However, it was easy and very tender.  I'll try it again with 1/2 pkg of onion soup.

I only used 1/4 envelope of mrs. grass onion soup mix low sodium,and no extra salt. They're ok, taste good with a ranch dip or bbq sauce on side.

This was easy to make and pretty tasty, but VERY VERY salty.  The soup mix definately needs to be watered down a little bit.
On the plus side, my 2 year old son loved them!  (and thats saying something)

This was not a winner in our house. It was much too salty and the chicken itself had little flavor. I did not use any of the additional salt either.  I had no 'gravy' as others have suggested, and I fear that it would have been too salty to eat anyway.

My family really likes this recipe.  Instead of using the margarine, I use either water or chicken broth, mix with the soup and pour over the chicken.  Very tasty and easy.

Be sure to skip the additional salt-just season with butter, pepper and onion soup mix.

Tolerable but not great. I even added extra margarine and the chicken didn't come out very moist or tender. I won't be making this again.

Unless you are a big fan of Soup Mix, don't try this one, or if you do, go easy on the powdery part of the mix.  The chicken was VERY tender, but just too strong.

too salty, but what I do is marinate the chicken in EVOO with spices and the soup mix. during cooking time,  i make a slurry of cornstarch and water and add to the chicken. Then i slice up some mushrooms and layer on top.

I made this using a large family size package of chicken tenderloins.  I did cut out the salt and used a whole package of soup mix. Also, I bake it for about 20 minutes to keep the chicken tender. The family loved it... it is now a favorite of my college kids to share with their friends.

I used bone-in chicken (wings and legs) and added black pepper, bread crumbs and season salt to dry onion mix and dipped chicken in margarine first then dipped them in the dry mixture. Baked a little longer since it was bone-in chicken and they came out great. Yummy~!

I changed this up a bit by using the onion soup as a rub for the chicken and adding crushed pepper corns to the mix. Then I used half the salt and then poured 3/4 of a cup of water into the bottom of the pan, helping  the chicken stay moist.

I modified this recipe.  I did not add any salt.  I sprayed PAM in the 9x13 pan before putting the chicken in.  I also used a egg wash instead of margarine then coated the chicken with a mixture of soup mix, dry bread crumbs, and pepper.  I really like that it was so quick and easy to make.  However, I thought the taste was just okay.

This was surprisingly good. I made it because there wasn't much else in the house, but it turned out to be a huge success. Everyone was asking me for the recipe. Highly recomended

Loved this for a quick and easy dish.  Very tasty and moist!  I mixed the soup mix with a little panko bread crumbs for extra crunch.  Dipped in butter first, then onion/crumb mix. Poured the remaining butter over all in the the pan. Wonderful!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was ok.  I left out additional salt and it was still too salty for us.

I was hesitant to make this dish, but I was limited on time, so I tried it.  My family and I loved it!   I mixed the onion soup mix with some toasted bread crumbs before putting over the chicken and I omitted the salt.  The flavor was great.  I used 6 boneless chicken breasts cut into strips, so I used the whole packet.  Served with mashed potatoes and corn, my daughter cleaned her plate for the first time!

Very good - used 1/2 the soup mix as other reviewers suggested and no additional salt- had it in the oven for 35 min. 3 and 4 year old actually ate it and we liked it too! Will make again for a quick easy dinner.

This was pretty good. I used two cans of sliced new potatoes, then a pouch of soup mix, then chicken strips, then another pouch of soup mix, then I drizzled on 1/3 cup olive oil instead of butter. It was way better the next day. It was actually really good after marinating in the fridge overnight.

This chicken was wonderful.  I used bone-in chicken breasts and covered the dish with foil - set the oven timer to turn on and be done when we got home from church.  It was SO easy and SO moist and flavorful!  Thank you for this recipe!

This was so easy!  Great recipe although the onion packet made the chicken just a little too salty for my taste.  But the ease earns it 4 stars!

This was a decent recipe and though we enjoyed it, I agree with one of the other reviewers that this would just do as a quick and fast meal. I omitted the salt and added a bit more pepper to spice things up a little. I also used the onion mushroom Lipton soup mix instead of just the onion one. Overall, not too bad of a meal.

This was very good and soooo easy to prepare.  I omitted the salt and used unsalted butter & only used 1/2 the package of onion soup mix because of the comments of everyone.  Next time I will use the whole package of onion soup mix, as my boyfriend thought it needed more coating.  This is a keeper based on easy prep alone, with the plus that it tastes good!

Good recipe, very flavorful. I used unsalted butter and did not add salt to the chicken.  The chicken was moist and had good flavor though it was on the salty side. I would make it again.

Easy, sooo tender, delicious.  A little to salty though.  I'd like to try to find low-sodium onion soup mix, but I don't know if they make that.  I might also thicken the sauce to a gravy-like consistancy next time. I will make this again. Very good, quick and easy. I served with mashed potatoes, roasted veggies.  Great weeknight dish.

My fiance really likes this. Everytime I make it he compliments me and gives me a big kiss. He says he enjoys the crunchy onions meshed with the tender chicken. I really love it too. I find that it doesnt take the entire 40 minutes to cook though its usually done for me at around 15 to 20 minutes.

this was a great meal to make if you don't have much time to prepare. My husband liked it and I had leftovers the next night for dinner it was great. Definitely make with mashed potatoes. I added a little chicken broth to prevent from drying out.

This recipe was tasty and easy. I only gave it three stars because even though it was good it was a little plain. Next time I think I'll make it with mashed potatoes and make some chicken gravy to go on top of both.

My family of 6 enjoyed this recipe very much.  Like the other suggestions, I used a little less of the onion soup mix since my family doesn't like food too salty.  A great time saving recipe in a pinch, and the chicken is very moist and delicious!

This was indeed flavorful, but perhaps a bit too much so. Next time, I will skip the additional salt and reduce the amount of onion soup mix.

This is a great, flavorful dish. I used garlic salt instead of plain salt, but other than that, I didn't change a thing. I highly recommend this dish.

Very yummy- the chicken was tender, juicy and flavorful!  Leftovers were even good for lunch the next day (not too dry even when re-heated).  Best of all, this was extremely simple to prepare.  Great timesaver for weekday cooking.  Will definitely make this one again.

This was great! I used garlic mushroom soup mix and real butter and a dash of rosemary. Probably the best "quick" chicken I've ever made. My family loved it!

I and my 3 yr old liked it, but my dh did not.  He said it was too salty and suggested using half the onion soup mix.  I also did not bake it for 40 min., but 20. At 20 min. the chicken was perfect.

This recipe is excellent. I have already made it 3 times in the past few weeks at my boyfriends request. The chicken comes out moist and flavorful. I use 4 chicken breast and cut them into strips. This will become a regular at our house, it is quick and tasty.

I modified based on others reviews. Mixed soup mix and panko bread crumbs together in a bowl-dipped chicken strips in butter then rolled in mixture. I did not add any salt. My kids LOVED it-as it was juicy and tender. This is saying something because my daughter is very picky about chicken. :)

Super easy and super tasty but on the salty side. I donâ€™t salt my food much so Iâ€™ll probably just use half of the packet next time i make it.  WILL make it again, though!  Cleanup was a breeeeeeeze

next time I would roll the chicken in the butter then place in the pan. I poured the butter over it, and once it started baking, the butter plus the juices made the chicken sit in a pool of juice when it was done. I had to put it on broil to try to dry it up. The flavors were great though.

Everyone in my family loves it.  The only changes I made were I breaded the chicken with onion soup mix instead of sprinkling it on and eliminated the extra salt.  It's great to have a quick and easy meal that tastes so good.  This is a keeper for sure!

Made this! I used mushroom onion soup mix, that's what I had in my cabinet.  I used less than half of the packet because I know them to be salty. 
 It was absolutely delicious!  My chicken breasts were on the smaller side so I only cooked them for 30 mins. Juicey, tender, and delicious

I put the Onion Soup mix in Mortar & Pestle to grind into coarse powder with Oregano and Fresh Black Pepper. Used bone-in Chicken Thighs. Rolled the Thighs in melted Butter and rubbed in the Onion mix.  No Salt. Baked at 370F for 1 Hour. Served with Mashed Potatoes and fresh Green Beans. Great Winter comfort food.

As is-- only a 3, too much sodium.  Regular butter has salt too and the mix has tons.  Take the onion soup mix, add pepper and sprinkle sparingly on chicken, or I have used the soup mix with Panko bread crumbs to season and coat two batches of chicken parts, then it works real well.

The trick to this (in my humble opinion): only sprinkle half the packet of soup mix onto the chicken. The rest, mix with a bit of water for the pan.  I don't use strips, but rather, bone-in pieces, so this works great for flavor, and keeping the meat juicy while it cooks. If I'm feeling my roots, I chop up some potatoes and throw those puppies in the pan. Make it with rice, or mash potatoes and vegies on the side......mmm mmm. Easy, and no seasoning necessary. This is my lazy-man-recipe that I love!

Yum! I added a little garlic powder and actually only used 2 chicken breasts since it was just for my boyfriend and I. When I checked the chicken to see if done I did baste the butter on top to make sure there was good flavor. So yum! Some might say too salty, I didn't measure the salt and I used the full onion soup packet for the 2 breasts, but to me was absolutely delicious! Served with brocolli and rice.  Will make again!

I will make this again. It was a very quick simple meal however I will not add the salt and pepper next time because I think the dry soup mix has enough sodium and seasoning in it already.

This was an extremely easy recipe with great flavor.  The chicken stayed moist in the oven; however a bit too salty for our taste.  Next time, I will omit any salt since there is plenty in the onion soup mix.  Thanks Kim!

After a hectic day this was so easy to make. I did not add extra salt and I would not use all the soup mix in the future.  Very moist....
Thanks for the recipe (my first with all recipes).

Excellent! Very flavorful and doesn't dry out like some baked chicken recipes. I added the dry ingredients to 1/2 C of bread crumbs because I figured the kids wouldn't taste it if it didn't look like "real" chicken strips. They liked it too!
