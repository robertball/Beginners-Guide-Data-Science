I really enjoyed this. I did make a fair few changes though, mostly because I didn't have all the ingredients. I used real chicken, for one. I didn't have black beans, so used half a can of 'mixed beans'. Didn't have arugula, but added fresh cilantro instead. Also added corn kernals and cumin (because I like it). Only down side is that some of them were a little messy to move without the filling falling out. But good recipe. Loved the mango in it for something different!

The smushed black beans didn't taste that great...definitely needs some salt, and still overpowered the rest of the quesadillas.

This was a great recipie I used homemade flour tortillas and piled it on big it made a great meal for the family and helped me to use up the extra mangos I had. The black beans added bulk and protien that helps with my semi vegatarian diet. For the the end product I put the quesadillas in a low temp ovenon a pizza pan instead of the skillet.

I feel like this recipe wasn't quite a four star recipe but it deserved more than a three star.  It delicious and very filling, however I did not add the veggie strips.  I think maybe two pinches of oregano and two pinches of dried basil would add for more flavor, but I liked the fact that there wasn't to much cheese and using whole wheat tortillas made it a pretty healthy recipe with the beans and all the veggies.

The flavor was really good, and would have been even better if we had a riper mango.  I didn't add the cayenne or the chili pepper because I can't handle the heat lol.  We used pinto beans instead of black beans as well.

This has become a staple in our house. We use frozen precooked chicken bits. Easy, tasty dinner.

Interesting and delicious take on the standard quesadiilla. I recommend dicing the mangos very small as the sweet taste is a nice addition but when you bite into a larger chunk the contrast becomes a bit too severe. The seasoning is spot on.

I made a variation of these one evening for dinner.  Decided to throw in a couple cans of shredded chicken breast and after preparing the ingredients in the skillet I baked the quesadillas in the oven for a healthier alternative.  They were very tasty and I would definitely make them again.  Thanks for sharing

Very good. Black beans were drier than I would have liked. Used fajita chicken mix from meat counter. Also used fresh basil and parsley I had for another recipe. Good stuff.

This is a great recipe with lots of great flavor.  The only change I made was to add chicken instead of the veggie strips.  It worked really well!

This was so super easy to make, and my boyfriend, who is hard to please, raved about it and gave me an A+! Make it, you won't regret it! I served it with salsa and tortilla chips, along with cilantro and sour cream. Yum yum yum!

Fantastically sweet dish, the mango and cayenne pepper go so well together. Used real chicken instead of vegetable chicken, also added a little strawberry for a little tarty taste. Will make again!
