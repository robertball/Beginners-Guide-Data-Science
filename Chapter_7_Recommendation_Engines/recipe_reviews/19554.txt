I am surprised how any times variations of this recipe are on here.  This is a good version though.  I like the addition of the onion.  If you are looking to lighten up, don't worry about leaving the butter out, I never add it and mine is better for it.  The butter makes things too greasy in my opinion.  I also, don't top mine, but that is usually because I forget not for any taste reason.

DARN good! the only thing I did different was use cream of potato soup and left out the corn flakes. My kids ate every last drop! I WILL be making this again! My husband may even marry me again after that dish!

iI tweek this everytime I make it.
Throw in 1/4 c shredded smoked cheese for a little kick. I only use about 2T of butter mixed with some worseshire sauce. I top it with some toasted bread crumbs mixed with salt,pepper, onion powder and parmasan cheese.

I thought I would have loved this more considering the ingredients but it was just so so. Use it as a base and then go from there.

It has already been said this is a variation on the recipe.  I did not use butter in the body of the recipe and I did not use the topping with butter...it was still way to greasy for my liking!

This recipe was really good but the recipe calls for way too much butter. I have a butter puddle in the pan. I recommend only using a couple table spoons of butter in the dish and then a couple for the flakes. I don't understand why the recipe only calls for 1/4 cup of flakes? I used probably a cup or so of flakes and it still didn't cover the whole casserole. Otherwise, this one was good.

I recently took this casserole to a college event at our church and everyone loved it!   Another person even asked me for the recipe.   It is super easy & pretty much no fail.   Great recipe!

This is always a good dish I enjoy at family gatherings.  For someone who enjoys a bit of heat, try using shredded pepper jack and montery jack cheese with a tsp to a tbsp of jalepenos to taste.  My family loved it!

Had to use crushed tortilla chips instead of cereal for the topping.  Took it to a friends family, and they loved it although my family didn't.  My hubby said to much sour cream.

This is a very good recipe that has the same taste as twice baked potatoes. My husband kept remarking how good it was and that he would like me to make it for the guys at work. The only change that I would make is to omit the butter. There was so much extra butter in this recipe that I had to keep soaking the excess up with a paper towel.  It is now on my monthly menu rotation.

We made 1 1/2 times of the recipe. We served it at a Soup kitchen along with the Easy Meatloaf recipe. We made enough for 100 servings.  The clients loved it.

So good! I used onion powder instead of real onion. I also used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken. Everyone at work loved and it asked for the recipe!

This was ok. Definitely don't need 2 sticks of butter. I just used 1 stick and that was even too much. Next time I will use half a stick (1/4 cup) in the casserole and leave the cereal dry on top. Could also cut back on some of the sour cream and it would still taste good. I used a 13x9 casserole dish and baked it for 40min.
