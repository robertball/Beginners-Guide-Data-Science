I made this salad for my husband's lunch omitting the carrot (he doesn't care for carrots) and added a dash of Old Bay seasoning.  He loved it so much, I received a call from him telling me he would gladly have this for lunch any day!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Excellent and fairly quick dish!  I made twice the dressing and followed another reviewers suggestion with additional seasoning.  While I didn't have Old Bay on hand I used a similar creole seasoning and that spiced it up nicely.  I also added chopped, seeded tomatoes.

Great tasting salad! I made this with leftovers in mind so I waited until serving to add the cucumber - worked out perfectly. It's also good with a handful of frozen peas added at the last minute.

I added a lot more lemon, salt and pepper and also used a generous amount of dill. Came out great!

Excellent! I added dill weeds and replaced the regular onion by red onion. I didn't have any cucumber so I added a carrot. Easy and delicious, perfect for lunch!

Easy way to use up a couple of packets of pink salmon that I had on hand!  I didn't have cucumbers - so used green pepper instead - still came out great!  Followed another reviewer's tip of using dill - and I added a touch of buttermilk as well.  Thanks - will make great lunches this week!

Very good recipe. I used to make this but with albacore. I ran across this recipe and it never really crossed my mind to use salmon. I used salmon fillets and cut it up.

A perfect salad! My first time experience with Salmon. I loved the pink color of the salmon, it gave me a new idea! When I added a pinch of salt I used pink Himalayan s√†lt and the flavor was delicious. It is so much better than the white salt.

I made this recipe because it's so flexible. I was short on a few things and got to use up some misc items that were hanging around the fridge. I didn't have lemon juice, so I used olive oil to cut the mayo instead. It did the job just fine. Also, since I didn't have celery, I added a generous handful of frozen peas and cut up three canned artichoke hearts and a small on-the-vine tomato (seeded). I am a real sucker for any kind of pasta salad, and I loved this recipe. Will surely make again.

I'll probably make it again but it needed more mayo and I ended up adding old bay for some flavor.

This is just wonderful!  I did use cheese tortellini because I had it and needed to use it.  I thought it was amazing with that.  I also added some Old Bay and was very generous in the amount of cayenne and black pepper that I used.  Just keep tasting the sauce until it is to you liking.  You can also use any veggies.  I used red onion, broccoli, celery, and orange pepper.  So simple to put together and so delicious!

I loved this recipe because it is very flexible. It can accommodate whatever vegetables you have around. We doubled the sauce, and some of us added Queso Fresco. I would add Feta next time.

It was okay, mine turned out a little dry. Next time I'll try it with a little more mayo and maybe a bit of spice.

I didn't have cucumber on hand so swapped petite peas.  Added some chopped yellow pepper for crunch. Added shredded carrot and chopped tomatoes because they needed to be used up. Two dashes of old bay.  Only thing is I would reduce the amount of onion as it can get very, ah, oniony since they're raw
