this is an excellent recipe that results in a flaky, flavorful crust that is tender, but firm enough to hold together well.  i used this for my boston banana cream pie and it was a perfect complement to the flavor profile. i made only two modifications; i omitted the vegetable oil and i reduced the buttermilk to only 1/4 cup.  this is my new standard pie crust.

Amazing!  Never did I think I could bake a crust as flaky and delicious as one you would get in a restaurant.    I used the crust for a pot pie recipe. I had some left over and made an apple dessert with the rest of the crust.  It all turned out so delicious.  You will never use another crust recipe after trying this one. 
Also, I did this all in my food processor.  So EASY!

I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  I don't think this is the best pie crust but it's a good one.  The oil makes it a little sticky to roll out.  I will eliminate this next time.  Also will cut back on the amount of buttermilk.  If it's not holding together quite enough a little ice water is all you need.  My husband will be the judge tonight.  He usually only likes my recipe.  We'll see.

I am learning how to make home made pie crust. I made it in the past and did not like how it came out. 
I came across this recipe. read the reviews and I will admit I was skeptical about using this recipe, having no experience.
 I put the veg. shortening in the refrigerator to get it cold. 
I started to use the food processor to mix the ingredients. I would not recommend doing this. It became puree on the bottom of the mixer.
 I placed the mixture in a bowl then put it the buttermilk and oil mixing it with a fork as explained in the recipe. 
It was easy to put together.
I placed mine in the refrigerator, wrapped in saran wrap over night. It rolled out perfectly!  
 I pre baked my bottom shell. I made a Blackberry pie. Awesome out come.
 I based my top crust with the buttermilk instead of egg..
 It was light and flaky and got big smiles on the faces of the people I shared it with..
 I would recommend everyone try this recipe.  I give it 5 stars. Thank you for sharing.. And thank you all who sent in your reviews.. 
It helped me make an informed choice, on a pie crust. I am no longer intimidated by making my own. No More store bought crust for me..
I missed out on this for all these years.. Love it!

I have never made my own pie crust and decided to make it for my chicken pot pie. The recipe itself was easy. I used 1/2 cup of butter and no shortening because I didnt have it. My crust turned out so good. It tasted like a homestyle diner. I did like it for the pot pie but I feel like this crust would make a phenominal dessert pie, especially peach or apple! If you are looking for a pie recipe, look no further, this is it!

Not surpising considering the ingredients, the flavor of this crust was very reminiscent of biscuits to me.  It was very tender, but I should have held back a bit of the buttermilk...the dough  was a bit soft and definitely didn't need the whole amount.  I used the food processor, and it came together in a snap.  The flavor and texture are very good, and it's a keeper recipe for me.  It was a great choice for my turkey pot pie.  Next time I'll reverse the butter and shortening amounts.

I made this exactly as written, and it was delicious!  It complemented my strawberry pie very well.  My previous favorite crust used all shortening - I like the combo of shortening and butter in this one.  I followed the submitter's instructions for prebaking, and they were perfect.  I was a little worried that I should have used pie weights, but the crust was fine and didn't shrink.  Thanks for the submission - this might become my new favorite crust recipe!

I have used this recipe about a thousand times and it is hands down the best pie crust. Reasons for this is it so forgiving. I read some of the other reviews saying it was to wet or sticky. I just add a little more flour and im good. And if it starts to dry out a little a put a little more buttermilk...no big. When you roll it out it is easy if you make a little mistake and don't want to start over it easy to just blend the dough back together because it is so moist. I love this recipe and it makes my pies perfect every time. I highly recommend especially for a beginner

The crust was delicious tasting in my apple crumb pie. I made it for a deep dish  single crust. The dough was difficult to work with because it was stickier than the normal crust that I make. I skipped the oil and reduced the buttermilk to 1/4 cup. Also, I did put the ball of dough between sheets of parchment paper and in the freezer for about 10 minutes before rolling it out. It seemed too thick but it baked well and tasted delicious.

First of all, I make a great pie crust and used to sell pies in my catering business. I was looking for buttermilk recipes and saw this recipe and thought "what a weird recipe" and decided to try it for fun.  Even using less buttermilk it was still pretty wet.  Instead of rolling it and putting it in the freezer as directed, First I mixed it and put it in the freezer for about 15 minutes and then rolled it.  It was then not over wet and easy to handle - also thoroughly chilled.  Well, it came out so great - really flaky and tender.  I also rolled it between plastic wrap and a little flour, which is cheaper than buying parchment paper (also easier).
It is really a great recipe and thanks for sharing it.  I will make it my go-to recipe!

I'll admit, when I was rolling out the dough I thought to myself, "I am not making this again". It was very sticky and ripped easily. I used it anyway for the crust for my veggie pot pies only because I didn't want to waste anything or start over. Boy was I surprised with the taste though! This crust is delicious and perfect for pot pies- yes it was a bit difficult to manage but well worth the effort.

This pie crust was super easy and very forgiving. It stuck a little to the parchment, but I will chill it longer next time to take care of that. 

Not to mention it is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! 
Thanks for sharing!

Tastes good, but the dough is sticky. Freezing between the parchment is needed.

Was the best home made pie crust I have ever done.  I made one slight addition, and that was to add plain whole fat yogurt to half of the buttermilk mixture.  A slight change, but texture was amazing.

I was a little hesitant about using buttermilk in a pie crust but it did turn out amazing, made buttermilk pie iii, with this crust(my first pie crust also) super flakey, mine did turn out a little to crumbly. (Took out oil and cooked crust raw with the pie)

Works really well.  Pulsed everything in a food processor until a dough ball formed.  Used only butter.  Chill dough 30 minutes before handling for easier rolling between sheets of wax paper or parchment.

Even though we cut down the amount of buttermilk per a number of other reviews, we found this dough to be much too wet, and difficult to work with. We pressed on and actually baked a pie, but found the crust crumbly and not at all flaky.

I use this crust once a week. It's so simple, and delicious! The shortening makes it flaky, the butter is for flavour, and the oil is to keep it soft and light v Personally, I recommend keeping the oil. I've made this crust without the oil, and it was still good but was harder and less moist.
