Tim's Sausage Stew (on this site) a much better recipe with two changes: Use just 1# turkey or chicken sausage (less fat and salt) and be sure to use low sodium low sodium broth.

This was on ok recipe. I had to leave out the cabbage because the husband doesn't like it. So I added 2 cans of mixed veggies. I think the soup made it a little salty. I do want to try it again but with the cabbage.

My husband finaly ate it after adding a lot of cheese and ranch dressing to it. I just picked the sausage out of it.
