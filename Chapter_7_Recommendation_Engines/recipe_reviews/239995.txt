We made these with Golden Raisins instead of Thompsons.  Goldens are less dry/chewy - just our personal preference.  I would agree with the other reviewer that these cookies are not sweet and definitely scone like, so they favor an accompanying cup of tea or glass of milk.  The coconut + fresh ginger combination is just heavenly!

Like a cross between a scone and a cookie, these are not too sweet, and the lemon and ginger flavor is very nice.

After reading the other reviews, I used 1 cup of brown sugar and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Cookies came out delicious and sweet!

These were exactly to my taste, my husband is very picky about cookies and he liked them very much! For coconut, I used Birds Eye fresh frozen sweetened coconut. I’m thrilled about this recipe, it’s a winner for us. Thank you for the recipe!
