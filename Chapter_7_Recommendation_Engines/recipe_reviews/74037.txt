A savory dish without garlic?!  Oh, the humanity!

I set this precious dish on a bed of wild greens, avocado &  seasonal tomatoes with a whisper of bleu cheese.  An incomparable success!

A glass of good red wine cleared the tongue, readying it for more, more, more!

(added 05/12/07: Fry a sliced pear or two until golden brown after you fry the meat.  Pour the prepared vinegarette over both!)

This is an excellent recipe for lamb. One of the few recipes here I've changed little to none. I see quite a few complaints on the reduction as being either too thin, or that there's too much left over. Make sure you give the sauce time to reduce(reductions are by no means quick), and know that the more surface area to your skillet, the less time it takes to reduce. Also, if you're trying to do this in a non stick pan, that might be the problem. Use good stainless steel as it is a great heat conductor, and also necessary to properly sear the lamb. I also see complaints about it tasting too "vinegary". If you reduce it properly and use high end balsamic vinegar, you should not have this problem. After all, there is no point to CHEAP balsamic vinegar, EVER.

This was my first time making lamb so I was more than a little nervous. I cannot believe how great this was! My husband kept making sounds after biting into it, "Ooh, Ahhh,ummmm....." I would give it ten stars if I could. The lamb was great served on a bed of wild greens and the reduction sauce was perfect drizzled over everything including my rosemary baked potato wedges. It paired well with Nero D'avola's "Romolo Buccellato" (a red wine). An unsung hero of a wine, well worth the $8 we paid for it. Next time I'll try shallots instead of onions and I'll look for a nice warm deep mellow balsamic. I'm exciting about making it again, maybe even making it for a dinner party!

This was AMAZING! Keep in mind that you should use a GOOD quality balsamic in this recipe.  The stuff you buy for $3/bottle is fine for marinades or maybe dressings, but when using basamic as a foundation in a sauce, shoot for upper-end grocery store quality; or even better, swing by a gourmet shop for a high quality vinegar.  A recipe is only as good as the ingredients you use!

Delicious!  I followed this recipe very  closely.  I placed the rub on the chops a few hours before dinner.  Excellent flavor and aroma.  I doubled the sauce (& cooking time) and added just a pinch of flour to it near the end to thicken. Soooo tasty.  One tip for other lamb neophytes... the lamb chops i bought were the size of lollipops.  I didn't realize how small they were until I got home because the butcher wrapped them before I saw them.  They were very tender and tasty, but you would've needed at least twice the number of chops to satisfy.  So, check the size of the chops before you buy them and adjust accordingly.  I will absolutely make this again!

I am attending culinary school and this meal was truly amazing and I have cooked alot of stuff! I did do a few changes after reading a few reviews. We are huge garlic fans in this house so I seared the lamb in fresh garlic. For the reduction, I reduced for about 17 minutes and added about 2 tbls of heavy whipping cream for some added flavor. I finished off with roasting red potatoes drizzled with olive oil, rosemary, fresh basil and thyme, crushed red pepper and pepper in the oven covered for 20 mins and uncovered for 20 at 405 degrees and green beans. This meal gets 10 stars! A sure favorite.

BOY OH BOY! We had this last night. Super fantastic delicious recipe. We followed the recipe exactly with the exception of rubbing the chops with garlic (3 large cloves minced) then rubbed with the mixture. Then seared the chops in the skillet to get some of the marinade in the sauce. Then I finished the chops on the grill. Also doubled the sauce mixture and it took 20-25 min. to cook down, which is a must. I'm not a fan of any kind of vinegar, but this was great. Will make it again and again. Larry

I have to admit that the whole reason I found this recipe was because I had a good bottle of aged balsamic vinegar that I wanted to try.  I did an ingredient search and found this one, and boy am I glad I did.  I took another reviewer's comment about using any cut of meat and used pork tenderloin, because I didn't have any lamb at home.  Boy was this good!  The blend of herbs and the reduction sauce were great!  Of course, because I changed the meat, my cooking times were longer, but everyone wanted more and said how good it tasted!  Thank you soooooo much for the recipe!!!!

When I first read this recipe I wasn't sure what to expect; but I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't too impressed with the steaks I purchased (fatty and poor meat quality), but that isn't the recipes fault. The balsamic vinegar made for an interesting sauce. I used a more expensive 8 year old (aged) balsamic vinegar. It was a bit more spendy but worth it as it made the sauce wonderfully smooth. I highly recommend spending the extra money and getting a higher quality balsamic vinegar for this dish.

Very disappointed the first two times I tried this; altered the recipe a bit and it was delicious!  
Use any cut of lamb (trim excess fat)
Brown meat in skillet with a little onion, garlic and OO.  Remove lamb and add to pressure cooker with tray insert (use about 2 1/2 cups of water). Pressure cook the lamb for 20-23 minutes; turn off, let cool 5-10 minutes naturally then cool pressure cooker in cold water. Remove lamb, set aside and reserve stock/liquid for the reduction sauce! In a ziploc bag measure 2 generous Tbl. Rosemary and crush really well - then add 1 heaping Tbl. Thyme and 1 scant Tbl. Basil - salt and pepper to taste.  Shake the seasonings until well blended. Place the lamb one piece at a time in the ziploc bag and coat evenly with spices - set on a foil lined cookie sheet.  Place lamb in the broiler for 5-7 minutes; remove & set aside. Reduction sauce:  needs to be doubled! I altered the ingredients/amounts for optimal flavor. 1 1/2 T Olive oil, 1/2 cup finely chopped onion, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar (make sure to use real good quality balsamic vinegar; the ingredients should not say 'red wine vinegar'!!), 1 T [unpacked] brown sugar (helps mellow the bold vinegar flavor), 1 1/2 c. lamb stock (reserved from the pressure cooker), 3 T butter


Use the skillet the meat browned in; follow the directions for preparing the sauce.  Reduce the sauce properly!!!  

Place the lamb in the sauce & allow meat to mingle for 5 minutes.

Wow! This dish was amazing, I did everything as said and it came out perfect.  Though I cooked it for about 5 min on each side and it came out prefectly medium rare.  I am only 17 years old with no cooking skills (just started cooking for my family once a week and this was my first dish) and this dish was extremly easy to make!

This could not have been easier to make! It was the first time I'd ever cooked with lamb, but I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.

AMAZING! Made it pretty much just as the recipe describes. The only thing I changes was the thyme - I halved it cause my husband doesn't like the smell of thyme. Also, I used garlic salt instead of regular salt. Oh and now that I scanned the list of ingredients I actually forgot to put in the butter in the end! It was still to die for!!   Served it with oven roasted carrots (brushed with olive oil & sprinkled with paprika) and baked acorn squash (brushed with butter, sprinkled with brown sugar and chopped Turkish apricots). Husband loved it. I was thoroughly impressed. We deemed it one of our best dinners yet!

I was sooo surprised at how delisious this recipe was. I used goat chops instead of the lamb. I didnt have shallots so I used 2parts white onion and 1 part garlic. 

My seven yr old son ate 3!! and wanted more but me and his dad ate the rest. The reductions was sweet and not at all vinigary tasting, definatly need tpo be patient to let it reduce properly. I will be making this regulary!!

Absolutely perfect! Even with my slap-happy way of following a recipe it was still perfect. For the butter, I used homemade. I got that recipe here, you guys should try it:o) I also added the balsamic to the pan before the stock & due to the heat of the pan, it caramelized very quickly & nearly burned. Definitely add the stock first & let everything reduce as the recipe states. The lamb was cooked, (I hate to keep saying this), to perfection. Not only will I make this again, I'm passing out the recipe to everyone I know:o)

This was very good.  Unfortunately, I ran out of good balsamic vinegar and only had the cheap kind.  To counter the strong vinegar taste of the cheaper kind, I added a touch of honey, which balanced the flavors nicely.  Next time, I'll use a better vinegar.

This was a great way to serve chops. Hubby is generally pretty fussy about the way I cook lamb (he likes it fairly plain, with no fuss), but he devoured all I put on his plate, and asked for seconds. I did change one or two things though. I doubled the reduction and cooked it in a pan by itself while I was doing the chops (I ran out of time) First I cooked the shallots with a bit of garlic and some finely diced mushrooms in some butter, then I added the balsamic and stock to reduce. I also thickened it a little more with a touch of cornflour towards the end after I had added the butter. Lovely recipe, thanks for sharing.

5 stars, almost 600 reviews.  That says it all. This is quick, easy and absolutely delicious! Do not hesitate to try this immediately! And, as others have said before, it is very important to let the sauce reduce down into a syrupy heaven! I doubled the sauce ingredients, and it took me about ten minutes or so for the reduction. The reduced sauce didn't LOOK very appetizing (sort of like jet-black, scorched motor oil) but man, the taste was out of this world!

Excellent! I made this tonight for guests and it was a hit. I thought the reduction sauce would be too pungent, but it was perfect. Next time, I'll definitely have to make more sauce...there wasn't enough to go around!

This was so good! BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE! I was searching for a recipe to make my chops stand out and this was WONDERFUL! I didn't have shallots like I thought I did :( so I used onion and it still was wonderful! Everyone loved it! I was told to save this recipe because it's to be used AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN! Thanks much!

I wonder how much they would charge for this in a 3 stars restaurant! Very very good and classy! Since I had fresh rosemary, I didn't use thyme and basil, flavours would have been too strong. I also added a bit of sugar (maybe 1 tbsp) to cut the acidity of vinegar. Thanks for posting!

I loved it! I have never cooked lamb before, never thought about it because it is pricey. I got a deal on it and found this recipe, decided to try it. My boyfriend and I both loved it! I only used two chops, thats all I had, but i did the origioncal amount of sauce, so if i were to make four chops i would def double the sauce. My boyfriend was a little scared because of the thick vinegar smell in the house, and the sauce was clunky. Once he bit into it, he was in love! I Served with steamed carrots, which tasted great with the sauce over it! Also, a green salad. I will make as often as possible!!!

This was the first time I ever tried to cook lamb chops. This dish was fabulous. The taste is top notch, like your eating at a five star restaurant! You must give it a try!

Wonderful flavors! It was very easy and my husband loved it. I used dry minced onion instead of shallots and had to thicken the sauce with 2 tsp. of flour.   Also, you could use this recipe on almost any cut of meat.

I really didn't care for this. I LOVE lamb, eat it at restuarants regularly, and I followed the recipe exactly (doubled the sauce as other reviewers suggested, expecting to love this dish based on the reviews). It turned out horrible (couldn't get the vinegary sauce off the lamb to make it edible). Easily the worst allrecipes recipe that I've ever tried.

I followed the recipe exactly and added some bleu cheese crumbles on top prior to serving. The cheese perfectly accompanied the lamb. It was delicious!

I have prepared this dish twice now, the first time I prepared as directed. I felt though there was just something missing too the tastes, I was wanting more flavor from the vinegar.. The second time, I decided to do something different to find that taste i was looking for. So I seasoned with all the ingredients, including balsamic vinegar. In addition, I added red wine to this. I let it all marinade for 4 plus hours... during cooking time I added a little more vinegar and wine, just before done and after reduction, I added a small amount of flour and water to make the glaze a little thicker... It was divine... It had an amazing red tangy/wine flavor just what I was looking for .. I was entertaining for a friend whom owns a well know restaurant here in Acapulco, and he was so impressed with the flavors he wants to add it to his menu... Thanks for the recipe...

I was bringing dinner to my daughter's house who recently gave birth to her 2nd son.  Since I wanted to spend time with my grandchildren I prepared most of the dinner at my home.  I was making 12 lamb chops so I tripled the receipe and then doubled the sauce.  I made the sauce at home because I knew it would take a lot of time for all that sauce to reduce (cut down a little on the vinegar, added a little sugar and used a tbls of Wondra). I made the mashed potatoes ahead of time also.  When I got to my daughter's house all I had to do was cook the lamb chops, put the already reduced sauce in the lamb chop frying pan to add the taste of the seasonings and cooked it for 5 to 10 minutes more.  I microwaved the potatoes, and cooked some green beans, added dressing to the already made salad and we were sitting down to eat in less than 20 minutes. The sauce was great over the mashed potatoes. A couple of days later, my daughter reheated the left-overs in the microwave and said everything was as delicious the second time around.  My son-in-law said that if we opened a restaurant this dinner would be on the menu.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I really disliked the flavor of rosemary in this recipe. Its also too tangy for me. Don't think I'd make this again.

Very good recipe.  I cooked as directed.  I was a little fearful while the vinegar was simmering - that's all I could smell: Balsamic!  But it all came together wonderfully and had a very mellow flavor when eating it.  I will use this recipe again.

Thank you for a great recipe.  This recipe produced not only wonderful lamb chops, but I also treated some chicken breasts to the same rub, pounded them thin, and cooked them in the same pan after the lamb had browned.  I finished the lamb chops in a 325 degree oven to med rare while I was cooking the chicken breasts.  The balsamic reduction was perfect, and I loved the addition of the butter at the end.  I served this over rice with a simple tomato basil salad on the side.  Beautiful meal, thanks again.

I decided to use this recipe because of the amazing reviews and because Lamb Chops are mt favorite. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone! DELICIOUS, but i also added something else. I drizzled on top Rosemary Aïoli which added the perfect addition. I added more Garlic, lemon, and balsamic vinegar because i wanted it to taste less like mayo.
The Aioli is very easy to make and i would tell everyone to try it before you condemn it! enjoy!

Delicious.  Tangy.  Tender.  Melt-in-your-mouth amazing.  I took advice from other reviewers who suggested using a high end balsamic vinegar and I also doubled the recipe.  This made enough sauce to drizzle over the mashed potatoes I served on the side and allowed for the hungry boys in my house.  It took about 15+ minutes for the sauce to reduce to the proper consistency so be patient.  In the meantime, I kept the chops warm in the oven on low.  They didn't dry out at all.  I also made steamed broccolini for a side dish and served with a lovely Cabernet Sauvignon.  First time making lamb...my new favourite!

Fairly easy recipe but looks and tastes very fancy.  The shallots are a must--if you've used regular onion, you have to try it with shallots.

This is the first time I ever cooked lamb and it came out perfectly.  I used lamb loin chops since it's the most tender of all the sections.  I served it with a side of garlic green beans and mashed sweet potatoes.  Presentation as well as taste made it a gourmet meal!

I have never cooked lamb chops before due to the fact that my husband is Greek and I didn't think I could prepare them as well as the Greeks do.  Fortunately, I decided to give this recipe a try.  It was wonderful!  The balsamic vinegar cooking was a little overwhelming, but the taste was delicious!  My husband was in awe of this recipe! Thanks P. Gray!

This was awesome!  I used onion instead of shallots because it's what I had.  I served the sauce over the chops and cauliflower mash.  I will definitely make this again.

By no fault of this recipe, I have to admit that the lamb chops I got were a little fatty - that said, this recipe was still very, very good!  Did not have any shallots so used 1/4 c onion and 1/2 tsp minced garlic and still found this reduction heavenly!  That by itself is worth the 5 stars :)

Excellent recipe! Did everything according to recipe, but added 2 cloves of crushed garlic to rub mix. Loved the flavor of the lamb! Made Jasmin rice as a side and the family used the "sauce" on the rice as the lamb with the rub had an awesome flavor all on its own. Next time will serve on bed of greens because the Balsamic did not go real well with the rice. Thank you for the recipe PGRAY!

Did not have shallots so finely chopped 1/2 sweet onion and 3 garlic cloves.  Used fresh rosemary as well. Mine reduced nearly too much.  Added a tablespoon of pear infused balsamic vinegar along with my aged balsamic for more fruitiness.  Very good!

Fantastic! I did a simplified version, broiling the lamb in a glass dish (approx. 4 min/side) and then, upon removal, simply adding a bit of balsamic vinegar to the pan while it was still really hot - it cooked down almost immediately and was just right.

Had this last night for dinner along with Roasted Balsamic Vegetables from this site. Fantastic. and the sauce went very well with the veggies also. The only change I made was to coat the chops with the coating early and place in the frig. for four hours to absorb the flavors. Will most certainly be makeing these again. Wife says they are keepers.

Mmm very delicious! This recipe is perfect for when you don't want to get any special ingredients at the supermarket - just make it with all the dried herbs you have in your pantry! I used some balsamic that had some raspberry flavor which added a nice sweetness to the reduction. A higher quality balsamic would definitely taste even better. Super easy, super convenient!

I am Armenian and I am always on the look out for recipes using lamb. I made this for the first time and it came out wonderful. I have just a couple of hints one, be sure to get a really good cut of lamb with less fat. My second hint would be to use a dutch oven, lots of sizzling going on. Enjoy!!

My husband loved this recipe...he continued to "ymmm" the whole time he was eating it. We also used olive oil with garlic but didn't change anything else. We were careful to allow sauce to reduce by a little less than half, it was very thick and taste was wonderful!!! we will definately make this again. This was our first foray into "lamb territory" and we loved it!!  husband is still talking about it...lol!

This was once exceptional recipe.  We had very thick chops, over 2", so upped the cooking time to about 5 minutes per side with the lid on to help it cook.  The chops came out perfectly medium-rare.  The savory reduction sauce paired perfectly and our guest literally picked up the chops to eat every last shred of meat. With new potatoes and a green salad, we felt like we had just stolen a meal from a high end restaurant.

I've been making this for 2 years and it's our favorite home made lamb. I use freshly chopped rosemary and basil with powdered tarragon to make a crusty chop. If you're making  the recipe for more than two servings, increase the sauce accordingly and partially reduce before cooking the chops, then finish off in the pan after cooking the chops. We love to pare with a baked yam and fresh mixed greens.

I love balsamic... this has a gourmet taste and made the house smell incredible.  For the rub, I substituted with Herbes De Provence (which has all the herbs required, plus more) and added a bit of basil to suit my taste.  I know reductions are not meant to be thick like gravy, but it was still too runny after being reduced by half.  Perhaps because the cut of lamb I used was extra fatty and yielded too much fat in the pan... something to keep in mind when buying.  Yet, I got nothing but raves for this dish and will definitely make again.  If you run into the same problem I did, I think adding a bit of flour, no more than a teaspoon, while cooking the shallots would do the trick.

An elderly lady I care for, with a bird-like appetite, asked if I would cook some lambchops for her. Knowing that she rarely asks for anything specific, I was happy to do this but not being a big fan of lamb, I knew you wouldn't let me down when I found this recipe. OMG! What a huge success this was. I loved the simple ease in prep, I loved the aroma, I loved that there was NO garlic, I'm in love with lamb chops and I love you for sharing!!! Can't thank you enough. My patient thinks I'm a gourmet cook. I'll have to let her know my secret. Once again you and your followers have provided an excellent recipe.  Frankly, I can't do without the convenience of Allrecipes and this is just another of the MANY that have graced my table!  Again, many thanks!!

I only had inexpensive basalmic and I didn't feel like going to the store so I used 1/2 vinager and 1/2 red wine.  This mellowed out the tang of the cheap vinager.    *** Ok, bought high quality balsamic and WOW.  This is the way to serve lamb chops.  Thank you.

I served it with Rosemary Mashed Potatoes and Yams with Garlic and Parmesan from this site and grilled asparagus and a nice Chilean red wine. Perfection.

I agree!! Great recipe!! We also followed the recipe "exactly" with a couple exceptions - - used 2 lamb shoulder steaks, minced 'n smashed 4 large cloves of garlic, used 4 tsp Herbs de Provence, pepper, rubbed it all in well on both sides, covered the dish with plastic wrap and into the fridge overnight. Followed the rest of the recipe and like some, doubled the sauce. And yes, it did take about 20-25 min to cook down without adding anything for thickening. Did it all on the stove. One of the suggestions was to splurge and get the best Balsamic you could afford. Saw one at Bristol Farms that's 20yrs old and grabbed it. The extra bucks were worth it! Bob isn't that big on vinegar but tasted it and said it almost was like having a sip of wine, it was so good. This recipe is definitely a keeper and we'll also make it again and again and maybe even try it with beef and/or pork. As one person said, the sauce is like a flavor bomb! Neither of was able to eat it all, it made for another great dinner a couple nights later - - reheats beautifully!!

Made this for Valentine's Day dinner and it was good but maybe not quite to our taste.  We are big lamb lovers, but we agreed after eating this that we prefer our lamb more simply made with just lots of garlic and a little rosemary.  Doubled the sauce and it seemed to need about triple the time to reduce.  Seemed like a lot of work for a sauce that we liked OK but were not crazy about.

This recipe was very good.  Not only was it quick and easy, but quite elegant as well.  I did not have a shallot on hand so I substituted with an onion.  I also added a little minced garlic to the reduction as well.  We will definitely make this recipe again!

I found this quite good, unfortunately the lamb was not so tender. The balsmic reduction was great. Did not have chicken broth so had to use beef broth and added about a 1/4 cup of red wine..turned out very good. -did also add chopped parsley at the end for colour as someone else suggested and about 3 tb of butter. Worked well over wild and brown rice.  Will make again-thanks for the recipe!

I don't normally like lamb but this recipe was excellent!  Next time I make it I will add a bit more butter to richen and thicken the sauce.  Also some choppend parsley at the very end may just add that finishing touch and bit of color!

This is such a great recipe!!!!! I am going to use this for a wine tasting party we are hosting next weekend. It paired beautifully with a Sangiovese. I practically was licking the plate! It was so good. Tomorrow night I am going to try this with beef tenderloin. Until this recipe, I never cared for lamb -- Now I want it every night. Again, this is a great recipe and so simple to prepare.

I made this for Easter dinner to try something different and I have to say, I'm glad I did it. I was a little worried about the reduction sauce at first, because it seemed thin at first. But by letting it cook a little longer, the magic happened.  Happiness on a plate. Will definitely make again.

I bought my lamb chops, on sale, at Costco. They were very thick, beautiful cuts of meat. I really wanted this meal to appeal to my husband's heart via his stomach. I hit a grand slam with this fabulous recipe. And it was incredibly easy. I served it with wonderful baked potatoes,a simple salad of fresh greens and a light lime flavored sparkling water. I'm glad I used a cast iron skillet because I can bring it up to very high heat for searing the meat. Prior to cooking the lamb, I'd seared a pan full of little sweet peppers with a splash of olive oil. I removed the peppers and used the remaining flavored olive oil to brown the onion (shallot). Perfection! However, I did such a great job that I had a pile of dishes to wash in the morning AFTER I slept late and was served a waffle breakfast.

Thank you for a great recipe. Very easy to make, however I must note that it takes skill. I made this with lamb loin chops so my cooking times were different, however it still turned out exceptional.

I've made this twice, and it was delicious both times.  I used fresh herbs (almost doubled) to take advantage of what we had in our garden and allowed the sauce to reduce for quite a long time.  Maybe 15 minutes vs. the 5 as stated in the recipe.  Served to guests with roasted potatoes and green beans.  Deee-lish!

It is a great recipe. I used garlic instead of shallots, finely chopped. I also used Italian herb seasoning. My husband said that it is better than 5 star restaurant and he doesn't want to eat lamb chops from anywhere else. Thumbs up.

Amazingly Delicious!!! Left the butter out of the sauce to save a few calories and didn't miss it. Also, I didn't have shallots on hand so I used green onions I had in the fridge instead.

I love, love, love this dish! 
I actually used an Italian season blend because I didn't have loose basil or thyme. I added extra rosemary and my own salt and pepper. I have this Walnut and Fig Balsamic vinegar it paired really well with the savory sweet potatoes I made to go with the dish. 
I will definitely be making this dish again.. My whole family loved it. Did I mention, this was my first time cooking lamb?? Well.. It was!

I had a leg of lamb and this marinade sounded good as I was cooking for a crowd and had never cooked a leg of lamb before. Did this marinade (subbing lemon juice for zest, adding a stick of butter, and some organic lamb medley herbs I purchased at the groc. store) and let it sit for 15-20 hours with the lamb that had garlic in its skin - and then I cooked it in a roaster oven. Oh my golly gee goodness. I was complimented up one side and down the other by the crowd. I have to admit it was the best lamb I ever had also!! This marinade is the go to marinade for lamb in my house from now on. Thanks so much for sharing!

This is the best recipe ever!  The lamb tastes so good.  Hubby doesn't like lamb and this recipe has won him over.  This is a 5 star restaurant recipe.  I have added a teaspoon of corn starch if it doesn't thicken up.  Scallions are better than onions also.

I really enjoyed this, my 1st meal from "allrecipes.com".  You did great with this, though I added a bit of a rue to this and thickened the reduction (a little).  Not gravy, though thicker reduction.  Something to think about.

Delicious, simple recipe! We used leftover leg of lamb, cut into chop-sized pieces, and loved the sauce, although it took way longer to reduce than the recipe indicated.

Making a balsamic reduction glaze is NOT an easy thing to do. Followed recipe exactly...even got expensive balsamic from italy...took over 30mins to reduce by 1/2 and it was still watery and tasted like vinegar! Chops were very flavorful...too much spice. Lots of work for little reward!

Fabulous and easy to prepare. Followed recipe exactly as written. My husband doesn't really like lamb and he said he loved it. My son thought the reduction would be good on pork chops. Thanks it's a keeper.

I cooked this for dinner tonight, my family LOVED it. my sister (whom does not like lamb) tried it and even she ate it. I didn't have any shallots, so I substituted with some green onion, I also added 1/2 cup dice mushroom, it turned out FANTASTIC. this will defiantly be a repeat dinner

I've loved lamb ever since I tasted it from Texas de Brazil, here in Memphis, and I'm SO happy I found this recipe so that I can make it for myself from now on (although only on special occasions... this is an expensive meal).  CHANGES I MADE: -Used one rack of lamb instead of lamb chops. I ate four chops off the rack and was still hungry afterwards. There wasn't a lot of meat on the rack after you take off the fat (which you MUST do! I accidentally left some on the bottom and had to slice it off after cooking. The lamb doesn't taste right with fat still on it).  -I seared on both sides as the directions noted, for about 3 min each side. Then I put the lamb in the oven (set at 450) for about 10 minutes. I don't like my meat super rare. This left the meat at about medium on the ends to medium-rare in the middle chops. The ends, medium pieces were my favorite slices of the meat.  -I accidentally omitted the basil but added garlic to the herb equation. I thought I had basil at home but low and behold I was out.  -Served on a bed of baby greens, with a side of grilled pears and baked asparagus. Drizzled the balsamic reduction over everything on the plate. The sauce is DEFINITELY what makes this dish! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!

I made this using pork tenderloin instead of lamb chops, and it was excellent.  I seared the pork tenderloin on all sides, then popped it into a 375 degree oven to finish cooking to an internal temperature of about about 145.  This gave me time to make the sauce, which was absolutely wonderful.  After removing the tenderloin from the oven, let it rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing.  I sliced it against the grain, and poured the sauce over top.  Served it with mashed potatoes and a nice salad.  The kids even raved about it!  I will be making this one again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved the flavour of this reduction. My husband not so much. He said that it overpowered the flavour of the lamb. Our guests did not rave over it either.

I made this for me and my boyfriend for dinner yesterday--along with Potatoes Anna and Garlic Sauteed Spinach.  This lamb chop recipe is very easy to execute and produces a very tasty result.    I only did two things differently -- first, I started reducing the balsamic vinegar and chicken broth separately in a small saucepan (before I even seared the lamb or worked on the shallots) as it seemed that it might take longer to reduce the mixture than the recipe indicated.  The second thing--I seared the chops for a little less time (2 1/2 min per side) and then allowed them to rest -- as we like our lamb medium rare.  I otherwise followed the recipe exactly as stated.    I've made lamb dishes at home before -- but had been hesitant in trying lamb chops (as I disliked it when my friends made it --I realize now it's because they overcooked the lamb and did not use any seasoning whatsoever).  This recipe has made me a convert -- Lamb Chops with Balsamic Reduction will be part of the dinner rotation!!!!!  Many thanks PGRAYMENDOZA....

I made this for my wife after she had a long day. Typically, we never have lamb as she really doesn't like it.  This recipe was an eye opener for both of us and she keeps hinting that I make it again.

This was a very delicous and easy recipe.  I used white wine/herb chicken broth mix and barrel-aged balsamic vinegar which is already reduced and sweet.  Mixed with the sauted scallions, it was divine!  Dinner party pleaser with great presentation appeal.  Excellent!

this recipe was fantastic! i'm not usually a fan of lamb, but my husband loves it so i'm always looking for a way to meet in the middle. this was the way to do that! i followed the recipe just as it is, and used a good quality balsamic vinegar for the sauce. the chops i had were thicker than the recipe called for so i had to wing it with the doneness, but luckily they turned out perfectly :) the balsamic really compliments the taste of the lamb well and i took another reviewer's advice and served it over spring salad with a side of rosemary roasted new potatoes. the best thing about it, is that it was quick and easy...but very impressive on the plate!

You can substitute the vinegar with a merlot wine if you wish...read on!  I have made this recipe twice, the first time I followed it exactly and it was excellent...better than any fine dinning that I have ever been too.  I cook with balsamic vinegar often and like many poster here I agree, you MUST use a high quality aged balsamic!!!  If you use the cheep stuff like Star or Pompei brands you will find it to be a very strong vinegar taste.  The second time I made it our dinner guest were not keen on balsamic so I substituted with a good merlot wine instead and it was also very delectible so if you are not fond of balsamic then use merlot.

Love the reduction but the recipe's cooking time leaves the lamb a bit too rare.  We cooked the lamb longer in the same pan we cooked the reduction and then placed the same pan with the lamb in the oven.  Overall worked out great.

WOW!! I made this recipe last night and it was so delicious! I felt like a gourment chef when I tasted it! The chops had amazing flavor and I was shocked that it was so easy to make! I made this for myself just to try it but I will be making this dish for company soon! Very impressive! One suggestion for those who want to add garlic, use powdered garlic and not fresh minced garlic because it will get too overcooked during the browning of the chops.(Speaking from experience!)As recommended, I used a very good aged balsamic. Excellent recipe...thank you so much for sharing!!

This is a keeper..As I'm not a real big vinegar guy I changed the amount of vinegar to 1/4 cup. I used a cheaper cut of lamb..thats all my store carried..but it was still wonderful..Also the left over herb/garlic artisan bread, dipped in the sauce was a meal in itself. I will do this again, and again,and again....

Delicious! I've never cooked lamb chops before. Honestly, mine were incredibly small and it took about 3 chops to make one serving. The reduction was yummy. I wasn't sure I would like it and was sure my husband would not, so I served it on the side, but we both found ourselves dipping the meat into the sauce. Thanks for a keeper!

This recipe is WONDERFUL! I use recipes from this site very often and rarely comment but I just had to share how very much I enjoyed this recipe. The lamb chops where very flavorful and moist. The Balsamic reduction added just the right touch of sweetness. 

Bravo!

Cannot say enough about this recipe. It is now my go to recipe when we have company unexpectedly. I refer using pork tenderloin seasoned the way I like with sage, thyme, kosher salt, and fresh ground pepper. Everything else remains the same. I always double the recipe and it takes quite awhile for the sauce to thicken but you won't be disappointed with the result. Serve with whipped potatoes, steamed vegetables and you will be a star.

this  recipes was outstanding. I had been looking for a new way to fix my lamb chops. My husband said  I cna fix them again. It took a while for me to get him to eat lamb. I used to just  plain broil them. With this sauce , this is it.

This was amazing.  I had to make a few changes to suit the ingredients I had on hand.  I used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic, one orange instead of two and boneless leg of lamb steaks.  Fabulous!  This was part of the Valentine's Day dinner I cooked my husband.  He didn't even miss the sex!

Incredible!  Superb!  Truly a gastronomic treat!  My husband wasn't too keen on the idea of lamb, but after he ate this, he went out and bought more lamb so I could make it again.  This one's a keeper!!!

This sauce dresses up red meat in such a way that you would have thought what you put on your dining room table came from an upscale restaurant with gourmet chefs.  Absolutely brilliant!  I made the recipe with lamb chops the first time and the second time used beef because it was more affordable.  Excellent with both meats!  I imagine it would be scrumptious with buffalo or kangaroo meat as well.

Orig. recipe came out great as listed!
Can't understand why someone w/make this so difficult to do/understand & time consuming as in a recent lenghtly post.

I'm a guy who is not brand new to cooking, but still consider myself a novice.

I *do*, sometimes playaround w/the orig. recipe, but that is at my own risk. Sometimes it better to MY taste, somtimes not, but you gotta like this recipe!

Almost all of the other reviews of this recipe have been helpful. I find the "simple" recipes & reviews to be the best - Quick, easy, & tastful.

Terric recipe.  I skipped the chicken stock with the balsamic reduction and added a little bit more butter.  The sauce was outstanding.  Also, seared each side for 1-2 minutes and finished in the oven on 450 for 12 minutes.

I tried this recipe with pork chops instead of lamb, and it was fabulous!  My entire family loved it.  I did make a little more sauce than the recipe called for, using a little flour and more balsamic vinegar.  This will become a regular dinner for us!

I couldn't wait to try this so I made the sauce alone and served with steaks which I cooked on the grill.  Made the sauce with only the vinegar, broth and a dash of beef stock to make up for the missing meat juices.  I cooked the liquid down until it was really thick and poured it over the steaks and sautéed onions and mushrooms.  It was fantastic, I recognize the flavor from restaurant meals, I never knew that vinegar would be so sweet when it’s cooked down.  I can't wait to try with lamb chops.  Thanks so much.  I will use this sauce often.

Excellent, excellent dish.   Agree that cooking time depends on thickness of chops.   For my taste, two minutes each side was ample for medium-rare (yum).  Also increased chicken broth by approx. 1/2 cup.  All in all, a lovely, lovely recipie.

We loved this recipe.  I used onions instead of shallots, doubled the sauce recipe and added some extra butter to mellow the sauce a little bit.  A definite family favourite that we will make again and again!

A great, simple recipe.  The herb rub was wonderful.  I actually lef the rub on for 3 1/2 hours.  It was perfect.   I judt moved from LA and am rather new in the meat preparation area that does not use a grill and these turned out well!  The sauce is a good compliment. I added about a teaspoon or toe of butter at the end for a richer taste.

Really good, quick and easy.  I deleted the butter to save calories.  Reducing the sauce IS important.  The sauce is good with rice as a side dish.

This is my first time to cook lamb chops and I am so happy! Five bright stars for ease, presentation and deliciousness. Didn't have shallots so I used some minced onion. I was out of the"good" balsamic and the Target brand did taste a bit too vinegary, so I added a bit more butter and just a quarter teaspoon or so of honey. Still didn't enjoy the sauce by itself but it was great on the chops. Thanks!!

Love. That is what my husband said this dish filled his mouth with at first bite. This recipe is by far the BEST recipe I have ever tried since Allrecipes began (and there have been 100s!)  If you want to show your sweetheart what it tastes like to cook with love, this is the recipe to try. It's dreamy in it's simplicity and succulent in taste just as it is written.

I have been making this for years and it is a family favorite.  When I did not have shallots I substituted red onion regular or pearls and still was delicious.  It is definitely a restaurant quality meal that anyone can make at home.

Easy and delicious! My son said it was "decadent". I appreciated the instructions on how long to sear each side in order to achieve a medium-rare consistency; the times were spot-on, and the chops were perfectly done. I did not have shallots, so I sauteed a small mixture of onion and garlic; it still tasted great. Will definitely make again.

This was my first time cooking lamb. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I couldn't resist using my own fresh herbs from my garden. I also purchased a good quality brand of balsamic. I can't wait to serve this for a dinner party...it was THAT good!!!

First time cooking or eating Lamb chops.  Turned out great, I would recommend cooking longer. We doubled the recipe and made more glaze to serve over mashed potatoes as well. Very good, going to try making the balsamic reduction tomorrow for another dish I want to try!

Eh, this was okay. I put more spices than the recipe called for and dusted with Kosher salt, and the chops were still very bland. My advice, but about 3 times the amount of spice you think you will need on the chops. The sauce was okay. The only changes I made was adding mushrooms to the sauce. Next time, I'll think I'll go the Greek route. BUT, I did layer on on bed of greens with green onions sprinkled on top. The presentation was beautiful.

I have never made lamb or mutton etc. before. The only lamb kind of thing I have ever eaten was a hamburger in near the Submarine Base in Scotland many years ago when I was in the Navy.
Alas, I tried this with shoulder chops (about 1") thick and they did all sorts of curling in the skillet. I ended up finishing them under a broiler. Netting around, it seems that the shoulder chop is either grilled, or braised. 
My main question is what kind of lamb chops did the author and/or other people use?
By the way, my spousal unit loves the sauce and wants me to give it another try with the proper cut of lamb.

I sear my chops as described but have to throw in the oven for a quick couple minutes due to the thickness of the chops i usually get.  The reduction is amazing

Fantastic!  This was absolutely super.  I added garlic after the shallots because we are garlic fans.  This was so delicious and easy, I cooked rice as a side and the sauce was great on it too. I will definitely be making this again!

Great recipe! Easier to make than the recipe makes it seems...times do need to be doubled. But needless to say i would make this again. I adding garlic because i put that ____ in everything. I also did not drizzle because my kids dont like "chunks. I put the lamb chops back in the pan "smothered" them then removed. I served with cooked cabbage. What an amazing combo!! Four stars only because it took nearly 2 hours for my entire dinner to be done.

My husband and I took an International assignment and there is very little beef available, mostly lamb so thought I better learn how to prepare lamb chops.  These are so simple and absolutely amazing!  I didn't serve bread with the meal but my husband ask for some to get every last drop of the sauce !! I would defiantly recommend this recipe!

Just made this for a dinner guest last night - cooked the chops for about five minutes on each side to get them to medium temperature. Also added about 3 cloves of garlic to the balsamic reduction and served on a bed of greens with goat cheese and a side of roasted rosemary potatoes. YUM! I would definitely recommend the goat cheese - the warm chop melted it a bit and made it nice and smooth. It complimented the lamb perfectly.

I just found another incredible recipe for lamb! This recipe is so good! My package of chops had 3 in there so I made those and didn't alter the sauce or anything.  I happened to have a tiny bottle of rosemary EVOO, so I decided to use it. I  also had a few different flavored balsamic vinegars to which I thought the pomegranate would go well with the sauce.  I was right!  Amazing flavor and not at all too strong.  I did everything else the same and I am certain that when I make this again(and I will) and I use the regular evoo and balsamic that it will be just as incredible!  The lamb is so moist and cooked to perfection.  I served this with some fresh, roasted asparagus.  Thanks for this recipe!  It is a KEEPER!

Best lamb I've ever cooked and ever had. Says a lot because I'm a lamb fiend! Will try putting it over a bed of arugula garnished with dried cherries next time. I had it with sautéd asparagus and thought the dish was a tad too heavy.The sauce is amazing. Don't cut corners, be sure to reduce the sauce! I apply the four serving recipe to a 1.37 lb rack of lamb (sliced down to individual lollipops about 3/4 ti 1 inch thick). Added 1/2 tsp of salt to the seasoning rub. I cooked the lamb lollipop 2 minutes a side at medium/ med-high heat which yielded perfect medium rare meat. I cannot be happier with this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing!

Our lamb chops were thicker, so took a little more time to cook. I just started the reduction while letting the chops cook longer. Excellent flavor. This recipe is a keeper!

Great on Lamb or Pork. We don't see a lot of Lamb so I have done this with Pork Tenderloins cut into medallions & I serve it with a seasoned wild rice on the side. Really tender with delicious flavor.

I happened to have fresh basil, thyme, and rosemary on hand so I put those fresh herbs, a few cloves of garlic, extra virgin olive oil, and a little dijon mustard into my food processor to make a paste (versus a dry rub).  I slathered the chops with it and let it sit in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes - tasted wonderful!  (Note: if the herb paste starts to burn as you're cooking the chops in your skillet, don't be afraid to finish them in a 350 degree oven.)

I can't believe how delicious the sauce turned out! I used lemon pepper instead of regular pepper, added onion powder, and didn't use the scallops, but other than that I stayed to the recipe, and oh man, was the result delicious. 1/2 tsp of salt was perfect for 5 chops, and 1/3 tsp of lemon pepper. Just sprinkled onion powder on the chops with the rub. Will be making again + trying to adapt to other dishes!

Prepared exactly as written.  Could have reduced further than the 10 minutes I gave it, but still wonderful.  Use a top shelf balsamic vinegar. Served with spanakopita and greek salad.  Excellent.  Dinner party worthy.

Excellent recipe.  Easy and quick.  I didn't have the herbs on hand but instead used an Italian herb seasoning to great effect  Reducing the vinegar/chicken broth mixture is a very important step.  Flavorful beyond expectation!  Huge hit with my diners!

I am always over critical on my own cooking. But when I made this on bone-in lamb chops....it became my absolute favorite dish. I made it with buttered fingerling potatoes. perfect pair. You will probably find yourself licking the plate after you are done. Don't cut corners on this recipe. Make it as is and do not worry about calories/fat/messy/etc...worth it all :)

This was my first time cooking lamb and it came out perfect. The only thing I did different was I used fresh basil, thyme, and rosemary.  Everyone in the house loved it and are anxiously waiting for me to make it again.

This was amazing! It was my first time preparing lamb and it did not disappoint. I didn't make any changes. The lamb was so flavorful and the balsamic reduction is the best I have ever had! I will definitely make this again.

Yum!  This recipe was great.  I used 1/2 pound each lamb blade chops and cooked the meat medium rare and then did the sauce.  A couple of things I did, most important, pull the meat out of the fridge at least two hours before cooking this will allow the meat to come to room temperature and stop sweating.  Dry with paper towels to remove any moisture to help with browning, rub with a thin coat of olive oil this will allow for better browning along with giving the herb/spices something to stick to.  Good flavor, I will definitely make this again.

This was absolutely incredible and earned me delighted smiles from the family. I served over a parsnip puree (roast then puree, not boil). I did make the following changes. Quadrupled herbs to give a tight crust on five small chops from very young lambs. I used green onion because the market was out of shallots and it worked beautifully. I would have doubled the recipe for the reduction had I known how tasty it would be over the puree (divine). I also finished the chops in the oven for a few minutes to set them. Serves well with roasted brussel sprouts and candied carrots with a full bodied red. Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe was amazing.  Be patient when cooking the reduction. It is well worth the effort as the sauce will become thick and rich. The best lamb chops we have every had.  Both my husband and I loved them.

I made this recipe last evening.  Very nice and simple, great tasting!  I did use a rather nicely aged balsamic and I think it made a difference.  Served with some peas and pearl onions with rosemary, and fingerling potatoes topped with some of the leftover herb mix.  Will make this again!

These were so amazing. I seared them for approximately 2 minutes per side only and put in a warm oven. Thoroughly enjoyed them I had 8 chops therefore I doubled the sauce. Turned out great!

Lamb, flavor, recipe - wonderful!  Easy recipe for my first time EVER making lamb (tho I love it)!  I used onion in place of the shallots, still delicious and smells terrific on the stove.  Only criticism:  small chops mean more work to get the meat.  Well worth the effort tho!

Turned out great! Used 2 shoulder chops from the grocery store. Wanted to surprise my boyfriend with something different since we always eat chicken and beef. He LOVED it! Followed the recipe to a tee and it was great. Even though the reduction took a while longer than suggested, the flavors were amazing. Also, I cooked the lamb for about 7-8 minutes on each side because at 3 ins it was still VERY raw on the inside. WIll be making again!

Fantastic!! First time doing a reduction, and the sauce was amazing. I did use 1/3 cup balsamic, 1/3 cup cabernet, and I doubled the amount of chicken stock. It took about 20-25 minutes to reduce.. and I also added 1T sugar to the reduction. It was fabulous!!! Can't wait to make it again on other meats!!!

Unbelievable and SO EASY!  I seared in the pan for about a minute on the fat side and then finished on the grill for a few more minutes and they came out a perfect medium rare.  The reduction had enough flavor from the fat and was really good.  A new favorite and I've never even cooked lamb before!  Paired with the Sweet Spinach Salad, green beans and baken rosemary potato wedges.

Delicious.  Made exactly as written.  The next time I make it I will add a bit more vinegar, and not reduce it as much.  Loved the sauce & we wanted more.  Filed in my favorite's file.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I don't write reviews as often as I should, but I just had to write one for this recipe.  It is very easy, yet has such impressive results.  The balsamic reduction was so yummy and really complimented the lamb well without overpowering it.  I will definitely use this one again.

These were delicious!  I did add a bit of garlic to the oil as it was  heating but I'm sure it's not really necessary.  Served with rice pilaf and a big greek salad - a perfect spring meal!

I don't eat lamb (or beef, or pork, or...), but my guy really enjoyed it.  However, it took a lot longer for me to cook than the recipe said.  I'd say at least 25 minutes for what I'm told was medium well.  Also, the sauce took quite a while to reduce, even in a fairly large cast iron skillet.  I ran the sauce through a strainer before serving - it just seemed like way too many shallots.  I tasted the sauce, though, and I think the shallot provided great flavor.

This was "top shelf"!!!  My chops were over 1" thick, so cooked them a little longer per side (5-7 1/2 min) for medium rare.  I didn't have shallots so used 1 T. minced garlic.  Absolutely marvelous!!

Made this tonight and it was just like the reviewers said--gourmet and restaurant quality. I followed the recipe exactly, except used 1 1/4inch thick chops.  When they were done cooking, and while I made the balsamic reduction, I placed them in the oven at 175 degrees to keep them warm (and probably continue cooking a bit, since they were thicker than called for).  When the balsamic reduction was finished, they were cooked to perfection (medium rare).  I used excellent aged balsamic vinegar that I had brought back from a trip to Modena, Italy and saved for just such an occasion.  It was a worthy recipe for my special balsamic vinegar!  The only complaint from my husband was that I should have used a bigger lamb chop!

This was my first attempt at lamb chops. My parents have lambs and are always trying to give me meat but I have always been intimidated to try it! This recipe motivated me to pull out the meat and try it. It made a delicious dinner for my family. The only bummer was that I didn't realize how little meat was on the lamb chops....It tasted so good, but we each only got a few little bites. I will make more next time for our family. I highly recommend this recipe!

Just made this meal and followed exactly.  I guess I must not be a fan of lamb b/c I didn't think there was much flavor to it without the sauce.  I also think lamb can be so fatty.  I might try with lean pork or chicken instead.  The sauce however was really good.  Very flavorful.  Great over the steamed broccoli we had.  Next time will double the sauce as we were licking our plates for more.

The reduction sauce is worth five stars alone - delicious!  The chops also came out very good.  I only sort of knew what a shallot was, so I used diced onions instead, but next time I will try using shallots.  I also broiled the chops instead of pan-frying them because every time I pan-fry meat, it comes out tough.  We dipped our bread in the leftover sauce - so good.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thank you!

I love this dish. I have made it many times. Sometimes with pork chops just as delicious. Some advise use a good aged balsamic vinegar. Brown chops on both sides. If the sauce is not thick add a pinch of flour. A bottle of red wine, bread and any vegetable works with the sauce. I have tried several.

One of my favorites this time of year.  I didn't have any shallots on hand so i used a tablespoon of white onion (very finley chopped) and 1/2 teasppon of garlic paste.  My wife and children couldn't get enough.  Thank you for such a great recipe.

Doubled the recipe.  Put the browned lamb chops in the oven at 300 degrees for the 20 minutes it took to reduce the balsamic/chicken broth sauce, because my husband prefers his lamb to be medium/medium well.  Fabulous AND tender even though they were closer to medium well!

This is an absolutely OUTSTANDING recipe.  It is the first time we have made lamb chops at home.  It was easy and tasted like something from one of the best restaurants in town.  Very impressive.  A keeper.

Best lamb chops I have ever had….. and I LOVE lamb chops! This recipe is 5 star and definitely restaurant quality. I followed the recipe to a T; however, I used a non stick fry pan so the reduction sauce took about 25 minutes to thicken. Also, instead of shallots I used cocktail onions. I highly recommend using a high end aged balsamic vinegar, mine cost about $15. Awesome recipe and highly recommend!!

DELICIOUS!!!  I am not a fan of vinegar at all, so i was a little leery of this recipe.I figured i would give it a try since it would be something differant.  I used 1 1/2 cups of boiling water to 2 chicken boullion cubes for the broth. I than let it simmer about 10 minutes, added a little butter let it simmer about 1 minute, than i added about 1/4 cup water with enough flour in it to thicken the sauce.  This is now my most favorite dish!!

Excellent! I was out of Rosemary and substituted sweet onion for the shallots, but wow, it didn't make a difference. This was a definite winner. Thanks for a great recipe.

perfect perfect PERFECT! 5 starts all around...so important to boil the reduction until it reduces...so rich & caramalised. Everyone loved it...had to make more for the rest of the chops...goes perfectly with the honey roasted potatoes also on this site. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was a huge hit.  The lamb came out so tasty, and the reduction was spot on.  I didn't add butter to the reduction, and it was fine.  I didn't have shallots, so I substituted with mild onion.

The Balsamic sauce was really delicious ! I waited for the sauce getting reduced by half patiently... for almost 20 minutes and still the sauce was little bit runny,so I ended up adding some flour in the sauce. It was so good with buttered rice.   Yum:)

I made this for a holiday dinner, and my daughter proclaimed it a new family tradition.  I followed the directions very closely and used an aged (expensive) balsamic vinegar.  When it reduced, it became almost a syrup with tiny bits of  herbs and caramelized shallots.  The lamb was good, but the sauce was bursting with flavor.  As my daughter said, "This is restaurant quality".

Delicious!  This is the best lamb recipe I have ever tried.  I only made one small change, I didn't have any shallots so I used some pureed garlic and a yellow onion.

Excellent.  I managed to forget to add the butter at the end but it was still delicious served with mashed potatoes and buttered string beans.  Added a few tsps of white sugar to take the edge off the acidity of the reduction

We thoroughly enjoyed this!  The rub is fantastic and gave real depth of flavor to the chops.  I let the reduction get quite syrupy and then added the juices from the resting chops.  The reduction over mashed potatoes was fabulous! This will be a keeper!

OUTSTANDING.  I eat lamb relatively frequently at several local restaurants, but have never cooked it at home.  I looked over several recipes, and chose thos one because of the number of positive reviews and the stars.    It is WELL WORTH TRYING.  The balsamic reduction is the perfect compliment to lamb.  Made a few minor changes to the recipe:  added garlic to the mixture with the shallots, and added some seasoned salt to the rub.  It was succulent and flavorful and delicious.  One think I will mention is that cooking the meat for the time suggested means the meat is very, ver rare.  I am a "well done" kinda girl, and it took about 15 minutes to get the lamb to the point I could eat it.    OUTSTANDING recipe and would recommend this to everyone.

Oh shoot! This recipe is the bomb! The key is patience, just make sure you allow enough time to let the sauce reduce, especially if you're doubling the recipe like I did. I kept the lamb chops covered with foil in the oven on a really low temp while the sauce reduced for about 20 minutes. Excellent!

This is a great recipe.  I used fresh roseamryand garlic and mixed all of the spices with a few drops of olive oil before rubbing the mixture on the lamb.  As others have stated, sauce must be reduced.  It took closer to 20 minutes to reduce rather than the stated 5 minutes.  This dish will rest on the quality of the balsamic vinegar that you are using.

Very good! Makes a nice but easy elegant dinner which I served with garlic mashed potatoes and a vegetable.  I also added about a tablespoon of suger to the reduction with mellowed the acidity of the vinegar.  The recipe didnt say what to do with the butter so I used it to brown the shallots.

Oh My, SO GOOD!  This is a 5 star recipe for sure.  My daughter said it tasted like a restaurant meal and she was so right.  Be patient with the reduction...you will get there and enjoy the syrupy sweet balsamic with  the shallots!  Thank you for this recipe.  I will be making this again for sure!!

This was our first time to try lamb, and my husband says it's his new favorite meat!  I had regular balsamic, not aged, so it was a bit runny, but it was still delicious!  Will most assuredly try this again!

This was good, but not as good as I thought it would be.  I'll admit I did not have the shallots and substituted garlic. Also, I only had beef broth.  In all fairness, I will have to try it again as posted.  I did, however, add mushrooms and enjoyed the way they caramelized in the balsamic.  I will try again and see if I like it any better.

That was absolutely delicious! The reduction is so sweet and delicious! I didn't even use a top quality Balsamic either! Definetely being saved to my recipe box! My husband was so very impressed! He said,"It couldn't of have been better!" and right after that he said,"I'm taking one of these to work for lunch tomorrow..." Say no more... Thanks a million times over.

Very good! Cooked in skillet for 2 min per side (herbs started to burn) and then baked in toaster oven at 350 for 5 more min while making sauce (med doneness). Would be good recipe with Filet Mignon for those not fans of lamb. I would add some mushrooms to sauce next time.

Thanks for this recipe!  I love it! I made this recipe at least three times and it has been wonderful each time. The med-rare lamb chops are beautiful with the balsamic reduction.  It is so easy and so quick to make! I use fresh rosemary from my garden. This is a must try.

What can I say, other than I have made this recipe several times and it's delicious. I have tweeked the recipe so much over time that I 've had to rewrite it because I had too many notes on the original. Here is the recipe I use today. It hasn't changed much, but it works perfect for me. I find this version is a little less vinegary and a little more flavorful, but that might be just me. Any way here it is.   •8 lamb chops •2 tbsp olive oil •coarse kosher salt •pepper   **Rub** •1 ½ tsp dried rosemary •1 tsp dried thyme •½ tsp dried basil •1 tsp dry mustard  **Sauce** •2 tbsp olive oil •¼ cup minced shallots •¼ cup balsamic vinegar •¾ cup chicken broth •1 tbsp butter  ***Step 1***	Salt and pepper chops to taste. Mix rub ingredients together and rub on chops thoroughly. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 15 to 60 minutes.  ***Step 2***	Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a sauce pan, add shallots and cook for a few minutes until starting to brown. Add balsamic vinegar and stir then add chicken broth.  (*AT THIS POINT START STEP 3*) Carrying on with the sauce you need to cook and stir over medium-high heat until reduced to a nice light syrup consistency. Remove from heat and stir in butter. Pour over lamb chops and serve.  ***Step 3***	Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Quickly brown the lamb chops on both sides (approximately 2 ½ minutes per side), until medium rare. Remove and cover with foil on warmed platter.  **Tips:** •	Trim your meat well before

First time making lamb ever. I thought it was awesome. The only thing is if you have finicky eaters that don't rare meat, cook it a couple minutes longer on each side.

I NEVER eat lamb, but my stepdaughter really wanted it so I made this recipe.  Not only did we all love it, but my husband said he'd never had lamb he actually even liked until this one, and he loved it! Huge hit with the family.

This is the best lamb recipe I have had to date. Definitely worth the time and effort. You have to get high quality balsamic vinegar to make this worth wild, cheap stuff just won't do. My fiance and I made this for our 6 month anniversary and LOVED it. We were both mmm and wowing the dish as we ate it. We paired it with fresh steamed vegetables and topped it all with some green onion as garnish. Sooo delish! Also make sure you give the sauce about 10 minutes to reduce, otherwise it's wayyyy too runny. Will make this again and again.

Wonderful.  I picked this as my first serious undertaking in cooking.  I couldn't have been happier with the results.  Served with Italian bread from scratch and asparagus, also caramelized some pairs from a previous posters suggestion and they would have been the best part if the lamb wasn't so great.

The balsamic glaze is fantastic, I have made it numerous times. The thing is that while it is good on lamb, it is even better on chicken. Still, a fantastic recipe. I will certainly be making it many times in the future.

I have been wanting to make these for the longest time and finally did.  I bought the lamb chops from Costco that are always just beautiful and made these exactly as written.  All I can say is yummmmm!!!!  The sauce was great and the chops were seasoned perfectly. This was very easy and fast to prepare.  Would make a nice dish for company.

Just made this for the third time ... LOVE it because I actually get it on the table in 30 minutes, start to finish.  I heated the oven to 375, seasoned four chops with fresh rosemary, thyme, dried basil, sea salt and fresh ground pepper; started some rice with seasoning for a risotto, started my olive oil heating, chopped some green onion, threw the chops in to brown, prepped some cresent rolls for the oven; turned the chops, trimmed and started some fresh asparagus; transferred the chops to a metal pan and threw in the shallots to brown; added a wonderful old balsamic vinegar and stock and turned up to reduce; slid the chops into the oven at the same time as the rolls (they came out a perfect medium in 10 minutes); set the table and pre-cleaned the kitchen, while periodically stirring the reduction. Then I pulled the chops and returned them to the reduction, flipping a time of two to coat them, prepped the plates with the risotto formed in a ramekin, added the chops and asparagus, drizzled all with the reduction and garnished with rosemary and cracked pepper.  Fine dining for two for about $18 in a half hour ... can't beat that!  Should have taken a pic tho.... grrrrrrrrrr

I bought Lamb Loin Chops. Very tasty, but have to admit expensive. Save for a special occation. $15.99/lb Ours were about 2 inches thick and we don't like undercooked meat. We prefer our food completely deceased (well done) So obviously 3.5 min per side wasn't enough. We finished in the stove at 350 for 5-6 minutes with foil on top to keep it juicy. I eventually raised the temp to 450, because I was cooking something else. Probably had them in there another 2 minutes, maybe. They came out tender and juicy and cooked through. The butcher suggested cooking under the broiler 5 min per side.

I made this for Valentine's day and even impressed myself! It was the first time making lamb chops and searing it on high heat for 3 minutes on each side resulted in a perfect medium rare. I let them stay warm in the oven set at the lowest setting (mine was 170 degrees). I also took another reviewers advice and sauteed up a sliced Bosc pear in the pan after searing the lamb and added the rest of the sauce ingredients (which I doubled) until the pears turned a golden brown. I also reduced the sauce for about half an hour (much longer than the suggested 5 minutes). I served the chops over some mixed spring greens, drizzled the sauce on top and had risotto with parm & peas on the side. Had a nice Malbec to complement the lamb and had the Molten Chocolate Cake from this site as dessert. It was a very elegant, restaurant style dinner at a much more affordable price.

This fantastic recipe is both simple and elegant.  My only adjustment to it was sauteing a couple of cloves of garlic along with the scallions (of course, this is a personal preference).  I will definitely be making this again!

4.5 stars; this was my first stab at making lamb chops and they turned out great.  However, I was surprised at how fatty (and expensive!) these lamb [rib] chops were and would recommend easing up on the olive oil.  I thought the fatty-ness detracted from the flavor a little bit.  I followed another reviewer's advice and cooked the chops in my copper-bottomed stainless pan (as opposed to a non-stick) for 3 mins on each side... and I got a perfectly medium-rare cooked set of chops.  It was very good!  And easy.

Very good base recipe.  Made this per instruction, I think it needs a bit more seasoning.  The amount is not enough for the four chops.  The sauce was great.  Will definately make again, except next time I could either grill or bake the chops with a bit more seasoning, I would not change the sauce.

Wonderful recipe.   EKW0801 comments were right on.  I browned lamb chops quickly on high heat on all sides for 3 mins max and kept warm in oven at low temp.  Used fresh rosemary and thyme only.  The Reduction took much longer than 5 minutes but I had quite a few chops and increased the liquids for the reduction.  The results were cripsy on the outside lambs chops done medium rare that melted in our mouths with a wonderful sweet and tangy glaze.  I had a coupld of chops left but no glaze.   I'll use this glaze again and again.   Thanks for sharing.

I can't stand lamb chops, but my DH loves them.  Keep in mind I hate lamb and not crazy over Rosemary either (and my DH does not like Rosemary either), HOWEVER, the lamb was DELISH and so was the sauce and the herbs.  Everything was so delicious.  I will use this recipe again and again.  I used the leftover sauce on Salmon and it was delicious.  Thank you SOOOOOO much for sharing this recipe with me!!!!  This recipe deserves a 10!

I find it easier to reduce the balsamic vinegar in a separate saucepan with a few ginger(remove ginger once reduce). Seared off the lamb and finish it  off in the oven until desired doneness. In the pan, add shallots and deglazed with white wine then add the balsamic reduction(make sure it isn't syrup looking turn it off once you reduce it by half as it thickens as it cool). Whisk the vinegar and add the stock. Keep cooking the sauce until the liquid coats the back of your spoon then  serve with the lamb and garnish as appropriate.

Oh wow, this is ridiculously good. Be sure not to reduce the balsamic reduction sauce to the point of no liquid (oops!) I'd shoot for either when the sauce reduces by half of 3/4ths.

I would give this ten stars if I could!! The only thing I changed is that I let the lamb marinate in minced garlic for an hour and I didn't have shallots so I used dried minced onion in the reduction. YUM!!

Wow.  I am speechless.  I've never made lamb before so I was a little nervous.  I had 2lbs of those lollipop-sized chops, and I quadrupled the herbs and marinated overnight.  Then I cooked in skillet 3 min each side, put in glass dish and left in oven set on lowest temp.  I doubled the sauce and it did take approx. 20 minutes to reduce (soooo worth it!)  I made it with a nice risotto milanese and garlic green beans.   YUMMMMM!!!!!!

One of my favorite recipes.  Key to this one is the reduction of the sauce and do not overcook the lamb.  I am not a big fan of lamb, but I absolutely love it done this way.  Thank you for the recipe

I have never cooked lamb chops before, so I wanted to try something other than what my mother used to make.  Unlike some others, I followed the recipe exactly and LOVED it!!  So did my husband and my oldest son.  I am going to make it for my mother, and we will definitely have lamb more often.  THANKS!!

V.Easy to make, cant go wrong and taste delish everytime, what more reason do you need for a five star recipe.

I have replaced shallots to onions which tasted nice too.

This recipe turned out great, although I did change some things.  My husband and I like to have rice, and I needed some sauce to serve on it, so I doubled the broth (it took a little longer to reduce, but it was reducing while the rice was cooking.)  It turned out just fine.  I will make this again.

Quick and easy. Fantastic flavor! My gourmet-loving husband is still raving about it. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and cut down a tad on the balsamic vinegar.

I made this for as a special dinner for me and my boyfriend about a year ago. This weekend he began talking about "the best meal he had ever had" and he began describing this recipe and he couldn't remember what resturant he had had it at. I cried out, "that wasn't from a resturant, I made that!" his response was "Really?! That means we can make it again this weekend!" It was the best compliment I had ever recieved and I owe it all to this recipe! I agree that you should use a top-quality balsamic, I got mine at Trader Joes for a pretty resonable price. I served it with some pita and tzatziki sauce, and sauteed spinach. It was a very yummy "greek"night

This is a recipe that turns out very impressive but it very easy. I took the advice of another reviewer and let the lamb absorb the herbs for an hour beforehand. I bought very high quality meat and wish I had bought more of it, it was that good. I also only had onions on hand (we still really thought it tasted great though). 3-3 1/2 minutes on each side was perfect for medium-rare. Thank you for this excellent recipe.

This recipe is awesome, made it last night & my husband loved it as did I. I used veal loin chops because I couldnt find lamb. It was wonderful except I overcooked it (my fault). Only thing I changed was adding garlic.  He wants me to make it again tonite using beef tenderloin instead.  This will definately become a new sauce in our house.

Lamb chops were on sale this week and though I haven't cared much for lamb in the past I decided to give them another try.  Since I am very fond of balsamic vinegar I decided to try this recipe.  These were so excellent I could eat them once a week with no problem.  Very tasty!

Great recipe!  I used fresh herbs fm my garden (no shallots, minced onion instead)added 1 clove of crushed garlic.  My only regret is that I didn't have more lamb chops...will do this recipe again and use pork chops.  It fit the bill quick, easy & delicious!

Delicious.  I made this with chicken instead of lamb and it was fantastic.  I could definitely taste how it would make lamb sublime, too.  Paired it with boiled potatoes and baked beets, and it was heaven.  I used fresh rosemary & thyme.

This is a hit! My daughter and husband love lamb chops and this was a special dinner last night. The sauce had just enough sweet/tartness to bring out the lamb flavor beautifully. I would like to try it on both chicken and pork as others have recommended. Thanks for a teriffic recipe!

Absolutely wonderful.  I rubbed my chops the night before and let them sit overnight for maximum flavor.  I took many people's advice on doubling the sauce for which I am grateful for the suggestion.  Do go splurge on the best bottle of basamic vinegar you can buy!  This recipe is worth every penny!

This was my first attempt making lamb chops, although I've enjoyed them at restaurants. Who needs mint jelly with lamb? I did as others suggested, and doubled the sauce. I was glad I did, it made the recipe. I did rub the lamb chops with a cut lemon half before doing the dry rub, which I put on about 2 hours before cooking.

Whoo Hooo!!!  I've never attempted to make lamb before because I wasn't sure that I liked it.  This recipe made me a believer.  I followed the instructions to the letter with the exception of adding a little extra butter.  The results were fantastic.  The lamb literally melted in my mouth.  I served it on a bed of greens so none of the wonderful sauce was wasted!!  Thanks for this great recipe!!

I would give ten stars if I have the option, as soon as my husband entered in the house, "Ummm..smells like a five star restaurant kitchen." instead of "Hi honey I am home" he enjoyed every bite of it. Definately a keeper, will make it again soon. Thankyou very much!

I made this for my husband's and my first Valentines dinner. It was terrific. Fairly simple and the aroma is mouth watering. I used Pork Chops instead of the lamb and a regular onion as I did not have any shallots. Also I might try it in the oven next time as I found that to get it medium-well made it a bit dry.

I have made this twice and both times it was a hit (first with my in-laws and second with our family ... both my 5 and 7 year old enjoyed it).  I also used fresh herbs for the rub.  I think the sauce really makes the dish.

I love the balsamic sauce!  I didn't have any shallots so I just minced up one small onion and added two cloves of garlic.  The sauce came out wonderful and tasted so good, not too vinegary at all.  The only thing was my lamb chops.  I think I might have gotten a bad cut or something because the meat tasted awful!  It tasted like a barnyard.  My hubby loved the sauce as well and we are going to try it with steaks and I think sauteed mushrooms would go excellent on top.  Thanks for the recipe, I know I will making it again and again, probably never on lamb again though!  Chicken breasts might also be good...

What I rate on is the sauce.. I liked it just fine, and would use it again... But never again with CHOPS!! try a steak or neck of lamb. You will enjoy this sauce much more. Finish with a good bottle of french wine!

Absolutely delicious!!!  This was my first time cooking lamb and I will definitely use this recipe again!!!   The sauce was fabulous over rice.  I substituted onions for the shallots.

I will make it again, with the following significant changes!!  First, double the cook time.  This is not medium rare, this is a walking lamb.  Second, I will be reducing the heat to medium.  Third, the balsamic reduction is very strong, I would cut back on the balsamic vinegar to maybe a 1/4 cup.   It seems this recipe was written for a gas / flame stove top.  If you cook on a glass top or electric the recipe will NOT work as is.

First time with lamb chops and they turned out Great! I wasn't sure about the reduction at first as I thought the vinegar was going to over power it and I did add some extra chicken broth and reduced longer. Not  sure if that helped or it was just because I reduced it longer, but in the end it was an excellent sauce. Highly recommend as is.

For a 1" thick chop I cooked it for 4 minutes on each side for a perfect medium rare.  I also let it sit out and approach room temperature before putting it on the skillet for a more even cook.  Excellent recipe!

Made this recipe as written and I think it was not only delicious it was easy to make. I will make it again with all different kinds of meat. Side dishes were roasted fresh cauliflower, fresh green beans with bacon and onions with a side salad.

Nice dish and used small lamb chops.  The sauce was good but really  came together about 45 minutes after we finished eating.  someone grabbed seconds and commented that the sauce got much better.  I reduced the sauce for about 7 minutes but the extra time standing seemed to blend flavors that much more.  One other recommendation, we served with roasted squash with maple syrup and cranberries.  A nice pairing.

I have nothing else to say, except "delicious ".
I have use this recipe multiple time, and it always great.  I follow the recipe as it written, no changes needed. I served it with halicort vert, mashed potatoes or orzo. Pair it with a good red wine, and you are in for a treat. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Totally impressed my husband with this recipe for dinner! Balsamic reduction was fantastic, I kept licking it off a spoon while I was doing dishes an hour after we had finished dinner. My chops were about an inch thick and were cooked perfectly after 3.5 mins on one side and 3 on the other, plus 15 mins to rest while I made the reduction. I used fresh thyme and rosemary since I had them on hand. Will be making this EVERY time I make lamb from now on, and maybe over blue cheese steak?!

I have been making a balsamic glaze for lamb chops for years but I decided to try another for kicks.  This is sooooo good.  I did not even bring my favourite mint sauce to the table.

All I can say is, "OH MY GOOOOOSH"!!!!!!!!!  I just happened to have all the ingredients in my kitchen, so I thought I'd give it a try.  The key to this recipe is a GOOD quality aged balsamic vinegar.  I let it reduce longer than it said and I was glad I did so the delicious sauce would stick to the lamb chops better. I passed out a little with every bite!  My new favorite recipe.

This is delicious.  I didn't have a shallot, so I used some red onion and garlic.  Word of warning though, it took between 10-15 minutes for my sauce to thicken, so don't go by the 5 minutes in the directions, because you definitely want the sauce to thicken nicely for it to be delicious.

Not sure if you can call this an honest review, 'cause I used chicken breast instead of actual lamb chops, but that could show the versatility of the recipe! :D :D :D I used homemade chicken broth and, after cooking the chicken in the pan a little, I put it in a closed baking pan and put it in the mini convection oven on 350 for about 30 min or so... until it was done. Then I followed the rest of the directions as shown. My wife *loved* it! I cooked it for our candlelight date night, and she was thrilled! :D :D

What a treat to find a lamb recipe that doesn't rely on mint!  We loved this and I prepared it exactly as-is.  I served it with what i had around - steamed broccoli and roasted acorn squash, but I would love to have it over a bed of greens.  I did scrape the herbs off before serving, because I find that eating dried rosemary is like grazing on crabgrass.  The flavor left behind by the spices was divine.

This recipe was wonderful and I prepared it just as written EXCEPT I had to increase it for 6 Chops instead of 4.  I served it with Fingerling potatoes and a broccoli, cauliflower, red & green pepper and carrot veggie mix and bread.  I will be keeping it on rotation for my family.

These were the most delicious lamb chops I've ever eaten! We didn't have a leek on hand, so substituted sweet onions with a smidgen of pressed garlic. Perfect! It felt like we were dining at a five star restaurant, instead of our home! This is so impressive, I won't hesitate to serve this to guests. The directions were so easy to follow, too. We paired with roasted Brussels sprouts and Yukon potatoes with a garlic herb sauce. It was heavenly!

Simple and delicious! I reduced the balsamic vinegar for at least 10 minutes in medium-low heat so it was thick and concentrated and omitted the butter at the end (because I forgot) and the sauce was a hit! My 20-year old and 7-old sons loved it!

This was a great recipe. I didn't have Lamb and shallots so I used Chicken breast and left out the shallots. I didn't have Thyme so I subbed Marjoram. I took others advice and omitted the salt which I am happy I did. Other than those small changes I followed the recipe but did find that I needed more time to reduce the vinegar down. Make sure you leave the spices on long enough to absorb them all. For those who say this has a vinegary taste, it's because you aren't giving the sauce long enough to properly reduce. I already had a higher end vinegar so I don't know if using a cheaper one would really make a difference, maybe maybe not. I was happy with the sauce but I can also see adding some cornstarch to thicken it.

Yes   and I  liked  it    The only thing  I changed  was  after it had reduced   I then put the chops in the sauce and let  them  cook  a bit longer  and they were very good.  Oh  I added some garlic   that's all

Didn't have thyme, but made the recipe with 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, and added a hefty helping of Herbes de Provence.  Got rave reviews.  Had 1" lamb chops instead of the 3/4", and cooked it 4-5 minutes each side.  Turned out medium well.

Yummmmy! Just like going out to an expensive restaurant, but better! My man loved it and is still thanking me : ) my 10yr old loved it, too! I took Qaedon's advice with the greens, tomatoes, and blue cheese...perfect! I'm going to try the same recipe with venison soon. I'm sure it'll be fantastic!

Wow! I didn't change a thing. The key: use a quality balsamic vinegar! This makes a world of difference. I previously made this with a store brand balsamic, and wasn't overly impressed. Just made this again last night with a balsamic from the local oil & vinegar shop-- no comparison! A sweet, smooth, and not bitter sauce. Cook time is perfect for a 1in chop, a nice med-rare (at best). I used my cast iron skillet and had a great crust. The reduction is even better the next day. Served with asparagus and a baked yukon potato.

I made this last night and it is going to be one that I make frequently.  Everyone loved it.  Lamb was not something that I grew up eating, so cooking it made me a little nervous.  This recipe gave me confidence to continue trying new things and get out of the cooking rut that I have been in for far too long.  I paired it with a 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon and felt it complimented it well.

I am only giving this 4 stars because my chops took longer to cook than the time specified in the recipe. They were a bit thicker than 3/4" but still took 10 minutes to get to the rare stage. For the rub, I used herbs de provence as suggested by another reviewer. It was excellent. The use of a high quality aged balsamic vinegar is key to the sauce. My favorite is La Piana, sold by World Market/Cost Plus. I doubled the sauce, as I had 7 chops and it took some time to reduce. I kept the meat warm in the oven while the sauce was reducing. I was hoping as it rested in the warm oven, it would cook a little more. The chops were still med rare at serving time. For a side dish, I made Laura's Lemon Roasted Potatoes from this site using fresh rosemary in place of the dill. This made a lovely dinner, with leftovers for another meal. Thank you.

Used the shoulder cut and came out great. Made the mistake of lidding the first 2 chops and those turned out a bit chewy, but the rest were great. Maybe I reduced my sauce TOO much, but I would make more next time, didn't feel like it was enough. Paired with asparagus and quinoa.

I made it to 'add shallots'.  I realized I didn't have any shallots or onions or anything of that nature!  Then I remembered that I had a bag of frozen mushrooms/garlic/onions precut and frozen that was labeled 'Marsala Mix'.  I added that in place of the shallots and then cooked it down to a consistency that I favored.  

The mix was light on mushrooms, but they added a great dimension to the dish.  It was great, and I will try it as written next time.

I had the dish with wild rice.  The blandness of the rice seemed to do well as a pairing.

This is a really good, easy and quick recipe to do with a solid result. While I didn't find it quite as good as the 5 star after 1000+ reviews would imply, I do think its a very solid recipe for a quick dish and variety of having a lamb dish mixed in the rotation.

First time, I struggled and agree that the quality of balsamic vinegar makes a difference.  The second time I made the dish, it was fabulous.

I love this recipe, its fun, easy and tastes great! I am confused about the reduction. The reduction in the video looks very thin but I get the feeling this should boil gently in the skillet for about 15 minutes and should thicken up a bit as it reduces. Can anyone tell me what the goal is when reducing?  This is a first for me. I tried several brands of balsamic vinegar, so far I like the Traditional from Olive and Co.

We absolutely loved these. They were easy to make - too easy for such great taste! I did not have quite enough balsamic vinegar so I used red wine to make up the difference. My chops were about 1 1/4 inch thick and I cooked them 4 minutes per side - for a perfect medium rare. Served over mashed potatoes. Excellent!

Absolutely perfection.  I doubled the recipe and it did take longer for the reduction but well worth it.  Served on bed of spring greens, avocado and bleu cheese crumbles as suggested.   Melt in your mouth lamb chops!

Made this for my husband and he said it was a definite repeater. 5 and a half out of 5 he said :D

The lamb chops were already pre-marinade in a mint type glaze but lightly. I ground the herb in my mortar and pestle and rubbed them into the chops. 

I served them with home-made spicy wedges and a salad with some mint and parsley leaves and a little chopped chilli. and a balsamic dressing.

I served this for dinner last night. All I can say is I have thrown away all the recipes I had for Lamb chops. This recipe is like no other recipe that we have tried. This tastes like it came from a very high end classy restaurent. The sauce takes a little time but it does thicken up in time. We had a little sauce left over enough for another dinner. It looked a bit thick but I will add a little bit of broth. In or family we serve lamb with mint sauce. I find the best lamb chopes are the ones we buy at Cosco. Lamb chops are expensive but worth it for this fab recipe. We will try this with a leg of lamb. Brown the roast first then bake and baste with a bit of the sauce the last few minutes. Werve the rest of the sauce. I think I would make a double batch of sauce for this Leg of lamb.  Thank you so much for sharing.  Tanya

I have not reviewed a recipe for a very long time, but this one is worthy of an excellent review.  I absolutely loved it.  I changed nothing except to sprinkle a little garlic salt on the chops before browning.  The browning time was not enough for the chops I used to get them to our preferred cooking level of medium.  I ended up putting them under the broiler for a few minutes, but in the future would probably do what another reviewer suggested and brown them for for about 2 minutes to a side, then finish them on the grill.  I used about 1/6 cup of a very high quality balsamic combined with 1/6 cup of a lesser, but still decent quality.  The sauce probably took about 15 minutes to reduce properly, but was so delicious.  I would definitely serve this to guests.  Thank for an excellent recipe.

We love lamb and Balsamic in our house so this seemed like it would be worth a try.  It was delicious!  Followed the recipe to a "T" except for the shallots(I did not have any so I mixed some minced red onion with some minced garlic.)  We will definitely make this again.

I made this for New Year's Day dinner and it was superb! I used fresh rosemary in place of the dried herbs, plus a little fresh garlic. I had some very good currant balsamic vinegar on hand so used that. The reduction was glossy black and we savored every bite! My lamb chops were 2 inches thick so I cooked them a minute longer, we like ours rare. I highly recommend this recipe and will use it again!

This was absolutely delicious.  I rarely cook meat inside the house, preferring to cook it on the grill to cut down on the mess, but this was good enough to be worth the extensive clean up afterwards.

Very good recipe, easy to make. The vinegar reduction is FANTASTIC. Made double the recipe (I had 8 chops) and a lot of the reduction, used it as dressing for salad I had with the lamb, everyone raved about it. Simple to make, tasty, thanks!

I made this for the first time last Christmas and it was the first time I had cooked lamb. Both my husband and I thought it was amazing!  Since then I have tried a few different lamb recipes, so as to not make the same thing all the time...nothing compared.  This is my absolute go to recipe for lamb, for impressing someone and for a special occasion.  Just bought 6 beautiful thick chops and will be making this for Christmas dinner for the two of us.  If you think it tastes too vinegary then you are probably just using a cheap balsamic - use the good stuff for this one!

Just finished dinner and this recipe was AMAZING! I only changed one thing...I added garlic to the reduction and the rub! We will do this recipe again and again. My husband and I were talking at dinner about how we would like to have friends come over and share this entree with them. THANK YOU for this recipe!

OH. MY. GOODNESS.

This was sooooo great! I made this with lamb medallions and we were trying to get all of the meat off of the bone! I added a little garlic powder to the seasonings, and but a pat of butter on the medallions while searing. I used 12 year aged balsalmic which I think made the reduction even better. I served it with rice pilaf and pine nuts and asparagus. Thank you Thank you Thank you for the recipie!!

I made the recipe as written and served with sauteed spinach and baked red potatoes.  It was truly delicious.   

This weekend I will make the balsamic reduction sauce and serve it over steak and add goat cheese as a topping.

This was fabulous! I ended up searing the lamb chops for about 2 mins on each side in the skillet and then finished on indirect heat on the grill. I also threw some red onion, zucchini, and red pepper kabobs on the grill as well.  I didn't have any shallots, so I finely chopped a TBLS of red onion and also a couple of mushrooms I had on hand. To address my concern of the sauce being too vinegary, I used 1 cup of broth instead of 3/4 cup and I thought it came out perfect. Like another suggested,I did add the broth before the vinegar. It took about 15-20 mins to reduce down. The sauce was rich and heavenly and worth the wait. This will be my go-to lamb chop recipe from now on! Thanks so much for submitting.

i made this tonight and it is now my all-time fave lamb chop prep.  So simple!  I've always broiled my chops, but tried this just for fun.  Really do be sure to reduce the sauce to a syrupy consistency; it is not too balsamic (which was my fear).  i have some kale in the fridge and should have paired this lamb with it.

I love this recipe.  The reduction is delicious.  To make it look truly gourmet, I serve over wilted spinach and sprinkle with blue cheese and blackberries.  This is always a hit.

Amazing. Only the second time I have cooked lamb. The first time was a roast, and we did not like it at all. I wasn't planning on trying lamb again anytime soon, but happened upon a lamb farmer at the farmers market. She said chops are easier for people new to lamb. The meat was succulent and this reduction was fabulous. I bought some more lamb chops and will be making this again very soon. I have some pomegranate molasses in my fridge that I may try and add, but really I don't think this recipe could get better! Thanks.

Thank you for a great recipe!  I made this for my husband who is a huge lamb lover and for myself who used to love lamb until pregnancy messed up some of my senses.  This recipe gave the tender lamb chops an amazing flavor while also being incredibly easy to make with most of the ingredients I already had on hand.  I highly recommend this recipe as it aroused both my husband and my taste buds!  You must try it!!!

My first time to make lamb chop. Very tasty and easy. I did use a bit too much salt, but that's easy to correct. Made as directed.

These came out perfectly! Did end up cooking the reduction a bit too long and it came out more like a chutney but it was delicious on top of the chops. Next time I'm doubling the recipe for 4.

Let me start by saying that I absolutely HATE lamb. I have tried it every possible way it could be prepared and have always been disappointed...until now! I am a big time foodie so I'm always trying to find ways to enjoy ALL kinds of food. I more than enjoyed this...I loved it so much that I can't wait to make it again! I made no changes. I prepared it exactly as directed. YUM, YUM, YUM!

Lamb is always a budgetary indulgence, but I found some chops on same and looked for a great recipe to use them in. This dish was absolutely amazing and my wife commented that it was as good, if not better, than the gourmet restaurants. The designated marinade time of 15 minutes is definitely flexible. I let the chops sit in the rub for an hour and a half in the fridge and it came out amazing. And yes, like another member wrote, I had doubled the recipe so the reduction time definitely took longer. The recipe is relatively quick and easy. The greatest time demand is if you choose to use fresh herbs like I did, but perhaps the dish was that much more delectable since I used fresh instead of dried herbs.

It was very tasty. I used onions instead of shallots and cooked it for 4 mins each side. It was a perfect med-rare. I made garlic mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. Good meal. Super easy recipe!

I omitted the butter by accident, so that may have helped temper the vinegar in the sauce. I'll follow more carefully next time. Otherwise, this came out very nicely. Preparing the sauce gives the meat time to rest, which was great.  I served it with sauteed eggplant and couscous.

My husband made this along with maple dill carrots. F'n YUMMM! The rub alone on the chops also works nicely, but reduction sauce - really yummy :)  The carrots sounded nasty, but I must admit, were the bomb. Cooking temperature is crucial - go for Medium - worked best for me not to burn the outside, and still keep a medium rare inside. Cheers:) Eat the sheep!

This is fabulous and easy!  I realized after I started that I didn't even have enough balsamic vinegar.  Here's what I did:  9 lamb chops from Sam's Club, trimmed the fat.  Used onion instead of shallot (none on hand).  Tripled the rub (chops sat for about 1 hour with this) and the sauce.  Only had 1/2 cup of balsamic, urrgghh, so used 1/2 cup of good red wine vinegar.  Reduction took about 25 minutes but I still added a little Wondra at the end.  Placed chops over crispy Petite Gem lettuce (Artisan lettuce from Sam's Club) and poured on the sauce.  My husband and I were in heaven.  This may be even better with balsamic but red wine vingar worked in a pinch for us.

Having never cooked lamb myself, I did not know what to expect... But this was fantastic! Seriously one of the best lamb dinners I've had. My boyfriend loved it too. Served it with garlic mash potatos as carrots, which complemented it nicely. I followed the direction pretty closely, but omitted the dried basil ( don't think it's necessary). Also the lamb took about twice as long to cook as the recipe states and the balsamic reduction took a few minutes longer to cook down as well... I ended up adding a little bit of flour in there to count down the time... It smelled so good I didn't want to wait any longer! 
Definitely try this recipe... You won't be disappointed!

Excellent combination! This was my first experiment with lamb and the results couldn't have been better. I even forgot the butter at the end (because by that time I was rushing to keep from salivating all over the kitchen in my hunger) and it was still superb. Per another commentator's suggestion, I served it over wild greens with cherry tomatoes and pan-seared pears. I will say that in the future, I probably wouldn't cook the pear in the same pan because the shallots got the best of it and gave it an unpleasant onion bite. Also, I see that other reviewers have suggested making more reduction (cooking longer of course) and I think I will take that advice next time. Other than that, I couldn't muster a complaint if I tried.

Delicious.  I omitted Chicken Broth and used some Sweet Wine Wine instead.  I also only had Pomegranate Infused Balsamic Vinegar which made the sauce sweet. A great combination for the herbs.  Everything came together very well. I will definately be trying this again!

I just made this tonight for my husband's father's day dinner. I used bone in lamb chops and I used the recipe exactly as listed, but I made 6 chops ( as the bone in medallions are much smaller than regular). This was AMAZING. Thanks so much for the recipe. I served it with quinoa topped with sauteed mushrooms and fresh green beans. Again.....THANK YOU!!! I will make it again and again.

Very nice dish. I reserve 5 star ratings for out-of-this-world experiences. Not quite there, but extremely easy to prepare and a great outcome. I followed directions precisely. It was a huge success with "foodie"-type friends. I will certainly make again.

Great. Easy. Simple. Everthing your lambl chop  should be.  The reduction sause made it!  I made ten (non-frenched) chops, and the reduction took a while (maybe 15, 20 min) but it made those chops awesome!  First time cooks, don't overcook, I put mine back in the oven for 5 min while the reduction finished cause i had to do the chops in rounds of 5.  amazing!

WOW! One of the very few recipes I didn't need to modify and it was incredible. I used Lamb loin chops that were about 1.5" thick and oh so tender!

This was my first time attempting lamb chops.  I followed the recipe closely, I think I left out the butter by accident but served the chops over spring mix with the reduction drizzled over it all and with a side of extra sauce.  My husband and I both LOVED IT and I'm making it again this weekend for friends coming over (it's been about 6 months since I made it the first time but I didn't forget about it!).  Thank you very much for the recipe.  The flavor is outstanding!

We LOVE this recipe!  I've made it 3 times. My hubby doesn't want lamb chops any other way now.   I do add a little garlic to the spice mix.  Other than that.. follow as directed.  You can NOT go wrong.

Made this for "date night" with the hubby.  We both loved it.  Ended up with thicker chops and had to finish in the oven.  Served on a bed of baby spinach, with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus.  Delicious!!

My family really liked this dish.  My teenaged daughter pronounced it, "Scrumptious and gourmet!"  I chose this recipe because you can make it right away - I did not have time to marinate the meat.   I used onions only because I did not have shallots.  Also, I used the 3 year old bottle of balsamic vinegar I had in the fridge - I found out online that it doesn't go bad.  I made the dish in a big cast iron pan.  Maybe next time I will get the high end balsamic vinegar, but the good old Trader Joe's brand was delicious anyway.

Great recipe! I removed my lamb from the pan as directed, but put it back in the pan with shallots, vinegar, chicken broth and added mint leaves. Covered and Simmered  Mint Leaves made it pop! I had a friend tell me to add Apple Juice instead of chicken broth. Next time I'll do that

Simply delicious! I did have to use yellow sweet onions, due to no shallots, but still AMAZING! I served it with a baked potato and broccoli, and all we wanted was more chops! I did have to use extra seasoning than what was called for to cover both sides, and also I used a mixed seasoning that had garlic salt and onion powder in place of just salt, and I can only imagine that it added just that touch of extra mmmmmmmm! As simple as this recipe is, I have to say, AMAZING! We would eat this 5 times a week if it weren't a risk of getting sick of it!

i used this recipe when i made lamb for the first time. it was delicious and so easy!  i made a few slight changes to the recipe: fresh thyme instead of dried vegetable stock instead of chicken broth and earth balance instead of butter  serve with bread. the leftover sauce and juice from the lamb was great to dip a delicious roll into!

My daughter and hubby gave this meal two thumbs up.  Daughter loved it so much, she requested that I make it at least once a week.  Hubby wants it 3x a week.  Very, very good; restaurant quality for sure!

Yum!  I used this to make lamb loin chops. I was amazed that they were so flavorful after only 15 minutes of marinating. The sauce was very tasty too.  I didn't have enough shallots so I substituted some yellow onion to compensate. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I forgot to use the chicken broth, so the reduction was very thick (oops)....however, the chops were amazing.  My husband said, "We needed to find bigger chops."

This recipe is outstanding. The lamb was the best I've ever tasted. It's very important to use a good balsamic vinegar. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis and the only way I'll be making it from now on. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe. It was awesome.

This was a fine way to make lamb chops.  It needed a lot longer than 3 1/2 minutes for me. I even covered the pan for a while. My hubby liked it better without the sauce, but I liked it with.

I used this recipe for some lamb loin chops. Very similar to the more popular rib chops. It was absolutely fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly. It is a recipe that will become one of my very favorites!! Thanks.

I rarely use rosemary or thyme in recipes due to their flavor, but I really enjoyed this dish.  I love balsamic vinegarette, so I decided to try this recipe....MMMmmm.  I did cook the sauce a little longer b/c it didn't seem to reduce that quickly. I made this with buttered egg noodles & garlic & parmesan baked cauliflower. The sauce was great on all of it!!

Fantastic recipe! Will make again. I made a bed of rice pilaf to serve it on. The only thing I might do next time is to double the sauce and reduce it to the same volume to make the same amount of a thicker sauce. Loved it!

Tasted like lamb from a restaraunt.  Substituted finely chopped onions and garlic for shallots.  The sauce took about 20 minutes to reduce.  Nice that the sauce could be on the side, the kids didn't care for the sauce.

excellent.  I used this recipe the first time I made lamb.  I opted to roast the rack of lamb rather than pan fry, which worked out nicely.  The sauce and rosemary crust were amazing.  Received rave reveiws from my husband and dinner guests.  My husband requested I make the same meal when his parents came to visit.  I served it with Smashed potatoes seasoned with greek seasoning and fresh steamed asparagus.  Fab.

Wonderful recipe.  The sauce is unbelieveably tasty.  Used fresh rosemary and instead of shallots, I used garlic and red onion.  A definite keeper.

All I can say is YUMM!!!! This recipe was fantastic and the lamb chops turned out so good I couldn't believe it! I was out of balsamic vinegar so I made them with white wine vinegar a bit of added sugar, and they turned out perfect. BRAVO!

Very tender and tasty.  I substituted the shallots with red onion and oregano for the thyme.  I also used adobo seasoning and garlic powder on the rub.

We used boneless pork loin chops instead of lamb because I didn't like how the lamb looked (It is Northern Nevada, we're lucky to get decent meat period). It was amazing! The flavors of the herbs really soaked well in to the pork. The best recipe we've found on this site so far.

This was excellent.  I used grass fed lamb and an aged balsamic vinegar and it was absolutely delicious.  I did substitute beef broth because that was all I had which no doubt changed the flavor of the reduction somewhat, but I think it would be great either way.  I followed other reviewers' advice to be patient with the reduction and give it the time it needs to cook down.  Definitely will make it again!

Wonderful recipe. It doesn't need any changes. Just remember to use good balsamic vinegar or it will ruin the dish. I served it with roasted potatoes seasoned with the same herbs mixed with some olive oil.

My favorite Friday night dish! The only thing I did different was that I rubbed the lamb with the seasoning and placed them in the fridge, covered, for two hours! Served them with Red Roasted Potatoes and lil spring mix salad with Carrots, fresh avacado and a "whisper" of freshly grated bleu cheese. ALSO, we bought a $14 bottle of Balsamic Vinegar and gourmet shallots, totally worth it! WE ADDED THIS DISH TO THE FAMILY COOK BOOK! AMAZING... especially if you like Lamb! Easy dish to make

This was my first time making any sort of lamb and it was such a good meal! I used regular onion instead of shallots and added a little sugar to take away from the acidity. Overall, it was very tasty and my husband and I enjoyed it very much. Pretty easy too! I definitely recommend this!

These were amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I doubled it because I had 12 lamb chops I was making.  My WHOLE FAMILY loved this and my husband said it was one of the best meals I had ever made.

Excellent - I've never made a reduction like this and this will now become a standard. I served with an asparagus recipe that also had balsamic vinegar and it went beautifully.

This is SO good! I followed the recipe almost exactly as written. The only thing I did differently was use fresh herbs. I was out of thyme, so I had to omit. The flavor in the reduction really intensified the flavor of the lamb. I served this with roasted asparagus and another recipe from this site - Greek Orzo.

My husband and I felt that this was wayyyy better than going to any resturant! If your a lamb lover like us, then you should try this recipe. You wont regret it. I put the lamb over some field greens. The Balsamic reduction (the balsamic was the cheap stuff, $3) was even great on the greens!

This was very tasty....and I like other reviewers don't really care for lamb(hubby loves)!I only made a few changes:1)I used fresh thyme and basil(had on hand)and 2)I didn't have shallots, so I used white onion.

This is the BEST recipe I have ever made from this site! I made it with fresh herbs but followed everything else to the T!  I put the chops in the oven for just a few minutes at 200 (to keep them warm) while I was finishing the mashed potatoes and steamed green beans!  My BF and I loved this and will def be making this again!!!!

Excellent and surprisingly easy! The grocery store was out of lamb chops, so I made this with filet mignon instead. It was amazing! I highly recommend the filet substitution. I served this with blue cheese mashed potatoes and a side of broccoli and cauliflower. My boyfriend was in heaven!

awesome! Will certainly make again! Used a non-stick pan. Was quick and easy. Served with roast squash, baked potato and green beans, but I think next time I will try rice and cooked spinach or broccoli... the sauce was soooooo amazing!

This recipe was delicious!  I used lamb loin chops, and  I usually grill them, but cooking them on the stove was fabulous.  I did add some garlic, and some red wine to add to the reduction.  Great flavor!

This really was fantastic! I used fresh basil and rosemary (I would have used fresh thyme but all I had was dried) and added fresh minced garlic with the scallions. The reduction was wonderful, as I love balsamic vinegar. I will probably double the sauce next time. The only problem I had was with the temperatures so I think I burned it a little, but my stovetop is rather tempermental and tends to be too hot so that is no fault of the recipe. I served this with homemade garlic mashed potatoes and a tossed salad. Next time there will definately be a good red wine. Yummy!! Thanks so much for sharing.

This is fantastic! Just what I was looking for. Had this dish at a local Houston restaurant for 37.00, this is so very close!! bought lamb chops at Whole Foods, and did double the sauce, just took a bit longer to reduce. Didn't change a thing! Wonderful.

Amazing dish! The only thing I changed was I added some sliced baby portabella mushrooms with the shallots. The balsamic with the mushrooms was incredible! The sauce thickened perfectly. This will definitely become a regular dish for us. This dish is great with wild rice, you can drizzle the balsamic over that as well...YUM!

This was wonderful, quick & easy! The recipe really doesn't need any changes. I did mince a clove of garlic & added it when browning the shallot, but that is a personal preference.  The recipe is fine without it!

I made these for dinner one night, and we all liked them. It was a little different, but the lamb absorbed the flavor of the dried herbs wonderfully for such a short amount of time. The balsamic reduction reminds one of a fancy restaurant dish, and it compliments the lamb nicely. Like the other reviewers said, use a good, high quality vinegar. Your sauce will only be as good as your vinegar!

I'm a person who eats lamb chop because my family likes them. . . this recipe changed my mind! The spices and reduction perfectly compliment the chops.  When you taste this, nothing is over-powering in flavor, it blends so well.  (My kids didn't like the smell of the vinegar cooking either, but soon forgot about when they ate it)

I must admit I bought my chops on sale...and I think they were not a very choice cut. I am new to cooking lamb and not sure how much I like it but my husband really liked this recipe.

This sauce... ooooh this sauce. This lamb recipe with this delectable sauce, over a bed of wild greens with rice on the side. A bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon. What amazing flavors, indeed. Myself and my family absolutely loved it. Thank you!

WOW! Best lamb chops we've tasted (and we have lamb producers in the family!). I did add fresh chopped garlic to the rub and also rubbed the skillet with cut garlic before the saute'step. Excellent!

This was delicious.  The only thing I changed was I rubbed garlic on the chops and on the pan.  I also thinly sliced a few pieces and sauteed with red onion finely chopped and green onion finely chopped. ( I had no shallots)  My husband devoured 4 chops!  (I also pureed sweet potato which worked well with the lamb flavors)  We drank Woodbridge Merlot by Robert Mondavi.  Exceptional meal!Thank You.....

This is a great easy recipe for lamb. I've made this same dish at least 5 times in the last 3 months. To kick it up a notch, I threw a sprig or two of rosemary into the balsamic as it's reducing and it adds a great aroma.

This recipe was excellent!! First time cooking/ever eating lamb chops and it defnately made me a fan, I was a bit concerned that my balsamic wasn't good enough but it made a fantastic sauce! (so i'm assuming it was aged properly) the only issue I ran into was I reduced my sauce a little more than I think I should have, but it was still amazing, I served it with long grain/wild rice and fresh steamed spinach, it was amazing!

First time I ever made Lamb Chops.  This recipe was easy and excellent.  The lamb did take a little longer to cook than 3 min per side.  Will make again.  Would even make for company quick and easy recipe!!!

Wow!!!!!! I was a little hesitant and skeptical about this recipe because something about chicken broth and lamb didn't sound like it would be all that great. However, I was completely wrong and very glad that I was. This was one of the best ways that I've ever had or made lamb chops. The sauce is excellent and compliments the lamb rather than over powering it. Thank you for a great recipe.

Very good combination of flavors. I used the extra balsamic reduction to flavor the green beans and almonds I served with the chops. Also served scalloped potatoes for a complete meal.

Delicious!! Great flavors and fairly easy to make. I will make these again for sure.  One note, however. I made these for a dinner party of 5 people and would NOT do it again for a party situation, given that there's not a lot you can do ahead of time and you end up staying by the stove quite a bit, to monitor the chops as they cook. It wasn't convenient for a party-setting. But, they still turned out very well, so I will just plan to make them for me and my husband next time!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  Made it twice - once with really good vinegar, once (tonight) with the cheap stuff cause that's all I had... it was still amazing!  Served with asparagus sauteed in garlic to make up for the lack of garlic in the recipe  (:

I usually don't like balsamic vinegar, but this recipe changed my mind!  I paired it with a grilled romaine salad and roasted red potatoes.  The balsamic reduction tasted great as a dressing on the grilled romaine salad, too.  This is my new preferred way to cook lamb.  Thanks for the recipe

I do not like lamb.  My husband adores lamb.  This is a recipe that we can both agree on.  I make no changes except to use onions when I have no shallots handy and it comes out marvelous every time.  Thanks!!!

Any recipe with 3 steps will be high on my list of repeat dishes.  Bravo!!  This is an amzing recipe, and SO simple.  I LOVED it.  I wanted to say, I was fearful of it being to sour, so I subbed the Vinegar with Cabernet Sauvignon, and so a red-wine reduction it became.  I never made a red wine reduction before so this was an experiment and it was so delicious and sophisticated.  I will definitely be offering this at my next dinner party.  Great job!  I promise to try it with the Balsamic next time, but I definitely recommend it with the wine.

This was fantastic. I followed the recipe to a T. The seasoning and the recommended cooking time on the lamb were both perfect - it was tender and flavorful. I was nervous about the reduction, but that also came out well. I served it with a greens, tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella and drizzled the reduction over everything. Very tasty, and very easy!

Awesome!  The cooking time suggested is perfect if you like medium rare.  I often overcook lamb chops because they're so small and cook so quickly.  I followed the 3 1/2 min per side and they were so juicy and flavorful.  The sauce was wonderful.  My discerning eater hubby thought they were incredible.

My husband declared this recipe to be "man candy" and raved about the flavorful chops. We had larger than average chops, which took a bit longer to cook. A note about the sauce - I grew a little impatient while waiting for the sauce to reduce and whisked in 1 tsp flour to thicken up a bit. The sauce really makes the flavors of the lamb "pop," but I would suggest drizzling a little of the sauce on to serve and then pour over with a gravy boat for your own taste. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great combination.  The vinegar taste and smell sears off instantly and the resulting sauce (once reduced) tastes nothing like vinegar and complements the lamb beautifully.  I'll be experimenting with balsamic even more now.

This was really good and fairly simple.  The only thing I did differently was I fried the chops for about half the time and them put them on the grill for about a minute each side ... I like the grilled flavor and the crunch it added.

OMG, you have to make this!!!  It was awesome.  The only changes I made were to add mushrooms, use fresh herbs and add the lamb back into the sauce for the last minute or two to warm it back up.  Served with crusty bread and asparagus baked with shallots and parmesan.  Oh, and double sauce.

This is the first ever review that i've put on this website... It's the second time that i've made this lamb and it for sure won't be the last.  
It tastes amazing and yet so simple.  Don't go changing anything at all.  If you're looking for a resturant quality lamb dinner then stop looking.... this recipe is perfect.  Thanks a bunch for posting it!

This was delicious.  A very nice way to accent the natural flavor of the lamb.  It tastes gourmet without being too fussy.  It also uses ingredients readily available in a well stocked kitchen.  Well, except for the lamb.  I only buy that when it has been reduced.  I have champagne taste on a beer budget!  :-)

A great easy recipe!  On my second attempt--I took another reviewers tip and fried a sliced pear after the lamb --than made the sauce with some garlic added -- layered the pears under the lamb chops and spooned the sauce over!  My boyfriend who is so picky kept making the mmmmmm sounds!  Will use again and again.

Absolutely delicious!  Only two minor changes.  I didn't have shallots so used garlic instead.  At the end, I added the lamb chops back into the reduction sauce and cooked for a few more minutes on each side. Really amazing!

My husband enjoyed the lamb chops. He said don't bother next time with the balsamic reduction. I don't eat lamb and tried the sauce, I didn't care for it either, but I didn't have a good aged balsamic vinegar. I went out and bought it and will try it for next time.

I hate lamb and this was so so good. It was way easier than it sounds from the title and my husband loved it too. Very good recipe. Just be carefull w/the shallots...mine burned up really fast because the pan was so hot from the chops. (my fault, not the recipes)Was still very good without the shallots.

This was very good.
The quality of the balsamic you choose really makes a difference as to how the sauce will taste. I used lamb loin chops.
3 minutes on each side and finished them in the oven while I made the sauce.
Very easy and tasty :)

Lamb is my favorite meat, but unfortunately my husband not only won't eat it, but can't stand the smell of it cooking!  So I used pork tender loin chops for this recipe.  Turned out great, meat very tender, and the sauce delicious! Now I just have to get rid of hubby one night, so I can try this with lamb!

This is an awesome recipe.  I doubled everything because I had about 12 chops, but it worked great.  My husband said that this was the best lunch ever.  He was really blown away.  This was a very simple recipe, but yielded a restaurant quality meal.

I was amazed at how flavorful and delicious this dish was!  And so easy!  It's not obvious, but I sat there with my boyfriend grinning: this is the kind of thing you'd spend a fortune on at a five star restaurant.  The only thing was that it took forever to cook the lamb!  Don't know what I did wrong, there.  But it was  totally worth the wait.

I had never cooked a chunk of meat before and this turned out great!  My only changes: vegetable broth instead of chicken, fresh rosemary and thyme instead of dried. Everything else was the same.  I served it with mashed potatoes, cooked carrots, and steamed kale (which was great with the balsamic sauce).  I will definitely make this again.

Oh man!! That was good!!  I served with brown rice and used the extra reduction for soaking in said rice.  Holy explosion of taste.  Thanks.

Made this for dinner tonight.  Fabulous.  I didn't have shallot so I used red onion since I had it on hand.  As the lamb was sitting with the herbs I started reading the reviews...I was getting nervous about only having cheap vinegar on hand.  I took the advice of another reviewer and cut the the amount of balsamic that it called for in half.  I used some left over Port wine that I had in the fridge for the substitution of the other half.  Worked great.  I will be making this recipe again.  The family loved it including my 4 year old daugher.  I won't even go out and buy expensive balsamic now that I know it isn't necessary.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made one change--I left out the butter at the end.  Personal preference.  The glaze was not as thick or rich as it would have been otherwise, but it was still excellent.

Pretty good, the sauce was a bit too thin and tart to do much for me. I got the feeling that this would be a good "base" recipe. I'd definitely recommend adding garlic and increasing the amount of seasonings if you're fond of more flavorful food.

My husband said these were good. (I don't like lamb particularly so didn't have any) However, the amount of balsamic vinegar, chicken broth and butter could be halved.  I reduced it as directed and still threw lots away.

This is my favorite thing to cook. Really easy, and it makes me feel like a gourmet chef! 
I don't have a lot of money, so I always substitude pork chops for the lamb and it works out great. Fabulous flavor, easy to make, and doesn't take a lot of time. Thanks so much for the recipe!

These were very good. I did half this way and half with a creole seasoning my DH likes just in case these didnt come out the way I expected. We ate them all. He says to keep doing this way since he likes both. Use a good balsamic and really let it reduce - it wont taste so vinegar-y like some felt. I am saving this to use again. Thanks!

Hubby has been after me to try lamb again. When he came home from teh store w/ some, I had seen so many wonderful reviews for this recipe that I knew this was the one to try. He soaked them in milk for a couple of hours first to help remove that gamey flavor, then grilled them to MW (I insisted) outside on the grill but made no other changes to the recipe. They were fabulous! We served them as an appetizer, w/ grilled corn & zucchini & grilled lobster tails w/ a glass of pinot grigio. Thansk so much for the recipe PGrayMendoza.

This is a fantastic recipe - a real keeper. I rubbed a freshly cut garlic clove over the chops before putting the herb rub on them, and I let chops sit for an hour as several reviewers suggested. I halved the sauce and there was plenty. Even though I let the sauce cook for the time indicated, it was still runny, so I thickened it with a small amount of cornstarch (mixed first with water before adding to the sauce).

This is the most heavenly dish I have ever made.  My father has 30-60 head of sheep at any given time and I always have lamb chops in my freezer.  I have made this at least 5 times and absolutely L-O-V-E this recipe exactly as printed.

I wouldn't change a thing. Just make sure that you force yourself to keep reducing the sauce until it becomes thick.

I substituted pork chops for lamb chops and very good.  This is fairly easy to make and pleased my most finicky eater.  A nice addition to the usual menu in our house, thanks.

Made it exactly according to recipe and came out unbelievably delicious. My boyfriend raved about it. My father, who's normally stingy on compliments, said it tasted like restaurant food. Best recipe I've tried on allrecipes.com.

This is DELICIOUS!  I used 4 lamb filets, and *quadrupled* the amount of spices to make a nice flavorful crust on each side.  I also poured a little garlic olive oil on each filet after the spices were rubbed in and let that sit for 15 min.  I added about 1 tsp of sugar to the vinegar to cut back a little on its pungent taste.  The sauce takes a little longer than 5 min to reduce (at least 1o min) but it is so WORTH it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Ignoring the fact that our lamb chops were a bit stringy and flvorless, we thought this was pretty good. If I were to make it again, I would simmer the sauce at a lower heat for maybe 5 or 10 mins longer - the balsamic still had a bit of a snap to it, and I think doing this would mellow the flavor a little. Thanks!

We all loved this! We actually have started raising our own lamb and got our first one back a couple of weeks ago.  I found this recipe and it was our first one to try with our lamb.  I used red onions since I didn't have shallots, and sauteed those down with a little butter.  I proceeded as directed and it was deeeelish!  Even the kids liked it!

I'm always looking for new ways to make lamb since we both enjoy it.  Although it wasn't bad, I don't think the flavor rated 5 stars.  I still like my Lamb a la Mouradean recipe with mustard, lemon juice, anchovy paste, garlic, olive oil, and seasonings the best.

This is excellent! Lamb is something that you will love if it is cooked properly. My late Mother used to cook lamb for just the two of us (because no one else in my family cared for it) and I only wish I could have shared this recipe with her.

Tasted very good but much too much taste for Lamb - couldn't taste anything but sauce - which was very good don't get me wrong - but I feel like lamb is wasted in this - would be really good on chicken or steak or portabello mushroom.

This is fantastic! I didn't have lamb chops so I used a leg of lamb and roasted it after searing it in the pan for the reduction.

This is awesome!  I followed an earlier reviewer's suggestion and used Herbs de Provence for the herb mixture and doubled the butter at the end.  What a great way to fix lamb chops.  It is easy enough for a weeknight and gourmet enough for guests.  A real winner.  Thanks, PGray.

We made this dinner for our Passover Seder. What a hit! It both smelled and tasted absolutely delicious. I doubled butter and added garlic to reduction, as suggested.

What can I say this was delicious, very unusual and unique.  I used diced lamb and added garlic to the marinade, after cooking the lamb I added it into the reduced sauce.  Served over my favourite mexican style frid rice this was mouth watering!!!

Must say though, it needs a better name as it doesn't match up to the meal.

My first time cooking lamb chops was pretty nice.  I accidentally put 3/4 cup vinegar instead of 1/3.  Oops.  So, it was a bit runny but the flavor was gorgeous.

The lamb lovers in the family loved it. The sauce was delicious, though reducing always seems to take longer than suggested. I used lamb loin chops, which sat longer than 15min with the dry rub.

Delicious!  I doubled up on the butter, but that is the only change I made.  After preparing the sauce as written, I found it to be a bit too heavy on the vinegar side.  I threw in the additional butter, and it was delicious!  My kids even liked this.  Thanks a bunch!

This one is a keeper! When I was a kid I remember my grandmother making lamb chops for the holidays. I decided to give this recipie a try and I was not disappointed. I have since made it two additional times. The last time I made it I added about a 1/2 cup of chopped carrots (par boiled) and a 1/2 cup of small white beans to the reduction. Then I simply serve the chops with a small amount of veggies and a mixed greens salad for a beautiful gourmet dinner. (BTW: the spice rub is delicious on beef as well).

delicious!!  The vinegar flavor was strong, but I love the salty flavor, so it was wonderful to me.  If you don't like so much vinegar flavor, you can control that by how much of the sauce you pour over the meat. I also used pork chops instead of lamb and it was fantastic.  Great presentation, will use for home and for guests.

I didn't have lamb so I used pork loin chops and it worked perfectly. I didn't reduce the sauce enough so it was runny but the flavour was still great. My boyfriend says that this is one of his new favorites!

Great recipe! Quick, EASY and delicious! Substituted OXO powder for the chicken broth and it was still fabulous. (I'm more of a liquid fan than the cubes but it worked!) It was my first lamb experience at home and will definitely do again!

This recipe was amazing.  I am very wary of lamb recipes - but this turned out great with very little prep.  I had been to an upscale restaurant the week before and had been very disapointed in their lamb chops.  This recipe made up for it!!

The lamb turned out wonderfully tender and very flavorful with the herbs.  The balsamic reduction came out as described but we didn't care for it - it was okay when the chops were dipped in at the end, but I definitely wouldn't use it as a sauce - too overpowering for the flavor of the lamb.  I did save the sauce to try over steamed carrots and found it much more pleasing.

fantastic recipe! I have used this recipe twice and on the second time, I added a little cognac to the sauce and it turned out great. I used onions instead of shallots. I had no problem with the sauce being runny as I added more onions and another tablespoon of butter.

I tried this recipe with some thick lamb chops and they turned out great.  I was a little sketpical about the balsamic but it came out sweet rather than tart.  I will definately use this sauce on other meats.

I didn't change the recipe at all.  My husband and I loved it.  It was better than any lamb we've had in restuarants (and I am a lamb maniac).  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I know there is already a bunch of raves on this one but I have to add one more.  My girls and I did this for my husbands birthday dinner.  We took out 2 pkgs of lamb chops by mistake.  It was a good mistake, we only had 2 little chops left...I think the sauce would work nice with chicken or pork as well.  YUMMMM!!!

I used pork loins since that's what i had.  This is an easy recipe to make and the sauce is very tasty!  I did salt the meat a bit (I really like salt), my husband enjoyed it but I think it might have been a bit "exotic" for my 8 yr old MacDonald's hambuger son.  I'll try it with lamb the next go round!

First time making lamb chops and it came out perfect! I caramelized onions and mushrooms to throw on top and  some asparagus for a side of greens & of course some rice. It was a hit! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! Will definitely be making this again. Sorry, no photos. We gobbled it up too quick to take pictures ;)

This was delicious. didn't make any changes. YOU MUST USE AGED balsamic vinegar. it is milder and sweeter than plain balsamic, and that makes all the difference.

If you want to serve lamb but one or more in your party aren't keen on the "gamey" flavor of it, this is a great recipe as the acidity of the vinegar and sweetness of the wine cut it significantly. The reduction can also be spooned over side dishes like asparagus, green beans or potatoes.
I found this one a little tricky to pull off, with the onions getting burnt and the lamb not cooking evenly, though this could be user error. While reducing the vinegar, be prepared for the pungent steam and make use of your hood fan and/or open windows, but don't worry about the intensity being too much in the end as long as you reduce it adequately. Personally I'd recommend finely chopping the rosemary or subbing in fresh, as it doesn't get cooked long enough to soften much and can be kind of sharp and pointy.

I followed the directions exactly as written and would never change a thing.  The lamb was perfectly done and that balsamic reduction was over the top.  Thank you so much for this great recipe!  It looked so good when it was done we forgot to take a picture!

One of the best lamb recipes I’ve ever made!  Serve it with garlic mashed potatoes and drizzle the balsamic reduction over the potatoes; top with the lamb chops and more sauce. I served this with mint jelly and Lima beans. It’s my husband’s favorite meal.

Reading how reducing the balsamic/chicken broth seemed to be an issue - I decided to start the sauce first. Once it began reducing, I started grilling my chops. It all came to fruition at the same time!! Beautiful chops - awesome onion reduction on top!!

Definitely will make again. Family dinner; all loved it. Only change was to double amount and make a flour slurry to help thicken. Aged, thickened balsamic is necessary!

I added fresh garlic, parsley, & oregano. I used a good quality balsamic vinegar & a very good red wine. My guests couldn’t get enough of it. Every bit
as good any fine restaurant. I was extremely surprised at how good and easy it was to make.
Will absolutely make again and again for sure

Used your basic reduction with herbs de Provence replacing your herbs and didn't have shallots so I replaced with onion powder and chopped garlic.  Otherwise I used your recommendations.  My modified reduction was delicious.

I made it, made a paste out of all the spices and coated the chops, pan fried, and it turned out quite tasty. I made the pan sauce too, but used it to sauté some spinach in, and that turned out well too.

I cut the recipe in half since I only used two lamb chops.  There was plenty of sauce. It was very tasty and I will make it again. I used fresh rosemary sprig in the sauce and cooked it.  Then removed it when it was done.

Tender and flavorful, but excessively sweet. On the assumption the sweetness is from the balsamic vinegar, I'll try again, substituting apple cider vinegar or lemon juice for the balsamic.

Delicious! Make sure you watch how long you cook the lamb because it cooks fast. I used a probably mid-range balsamic and thought it tasted great, YMMV.

Excellent, followed recipe exactly, turned out medium rare and delicious.  As others have reported, don’t rush the reduction.  I turned my oven to warm, covered chops with foil and placed in warm oven while stirring reduction.

It is one of our favorites.  My only change is I triple the reduction sauce and use lots of FRESH basil, rosemary, thyme, makati mushrooms, garlic and shallots or sweet onions .  Sautéing in the drippings before balsamic reduction .  I also so add a teaspoon or two of honey to the reduction.  It is a dish in itself.  The herbs are now a vegetable with the onions, garlic and mushrooms .  We love it.  Lamb never tasted better.

Easy, quick and delicious!  I made this as is, and everyone loved it.  The quality of the balsamic makes a huge difference, so do not skimp on the price, buy a really good aged one, $15 a bottle is not too much for a good one!

Absolutely delicious and quite easy, actually. The balsamic reduction was amazing and turned out perfectly when I let it reduce for a bit longer than 5 minutes. I threw the shallots into the mini-blender and that simplified the preparation. Would have liked fresh rosemary and will use it next time. Cooking time for meat was perfect for medium rare as we like. Definitely planning on making it again!

Followed the recipe using a mid grade balsamic. Delicious meal just be sure to adjust cook time for the type and thickness of the chops you are using.

I loved this lamb recipe.  I'm not usually a big fan of lamb but this was the best I've had.  The only changes I made was to put the dry rub on the lamb an hour before cooking .  I was also concerned about the lamb cooling down while I reduced a double recipe of the sauce.  I browned the chops on each side for about 1 and 1/2 minutes and then put them in the oven at 350 degrees while I reduced the sauce for 10 minutes. When the sauce was reduced the chops were perfectly medium rare.  It was a wonderful meal.  Mashed potatoes and carrots went perfectly with the balsamic reduction.

Absolutely perfect!!! I usually can't rate recipes because I always adjust a lot but I followed this recipe almost exactly (except had 8 lamb chops since they were tiny and used homemade veggie stock instead of chicken broth). I was afraid of the vinegar taste being too overwhelming since I am not a fan of sour tasting food, but it had a touch of sweetness which was amazing! It was our first time making lamb at home. Definitely a must try!

I had some lamb chops that needed to be used and found this recipe. I didn't have shallots so I used half an onion and threw in some mushrooms that were on their last leg. I forgot to halve the sauce because we only had two lamb chops so I used the rest on my veggies and it was really good!

Oh, WOW! We used 2” lamb chips. The herb blend was so tasty, and the balsamic glaze is fantastic! I think I will try it with white balsamic next time, and perhaps 1/4 c. Vs 1/3.
We had ours with pan sauteed brussel sprouts with garlic. It was a Michelin-rated meal to us!
THANK YOU!

I didn’t have shallots so I used chives and tried a maple balsamic. It was fantastic and my family loved it! Will definitely be making this again.

Beautiful! Thank you for sharing! I made this for a dinner for 1. My substitutes were out of necessity because I could not run to the store yet again. 
I made this with red wine vinegar and onion.

The only change I made was that I fried the lamb chops in with the onions & herbs. I made the reduction as outlined. The whole dish was delicious & will def. do it again.

Very good lamb chops! Balsamic is the key for the sauce. Must be a very good quality!
Added sliced mushrooms to shallots. Excellent addition!
Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Followed the recipe to the T.  Fabulous!  The reduction sauce is delicate enough to wonderfully compliment the lamb.  I will make it again for sure.

I made this for a dear friend on Father's Day.  It was the first time I'd ever made lamb chops.  When I read the reviews on the "reduction" sauce, I'll admit, I had no idea what they were talking about lol.  I did take heed to buying a gourmet balsamic vinegar.  The chops turned out excellent and the sauce was the best my friend commented.  I've cooked many special dishes for him but he said this one was the best.  I was flattered and honored.  The reduction sauce turned out well because I kept stirring and let it "reduce".  It wasn't runny at all and definitely no vinegary taste.  (I used lamb loin chops and trimmed the fat)  I served with sauteed spinach, and baked tricolor little potatoes.  Thank you for posting this recipe and to all the reviewers.  I'll definitely make this again!

I let the reduction cook too long so there was less of the sauce that I would have liked.  Other wise this is a good recipe.  Just wish that lamb chops were not so expensive.

I am an passionate, experienced home cook and tonight is the very first time I prepared lamb chops- ever!  I always thought I didn’t like lamb (having tried it years ago).  I was so wrong.  I did not have a shallot in the house so I finely chopped 1/2 of an onion and mixed the onion with 1 teaspoon chopped garlic to replace the shallot. I also added about a teaspoon of Dijon mustard to the sauce and  I used my cast iron skillet to get a good sear. These lamb chops were absolutely delicious.  So easy and Delicious!!  I will definitely make them again and soon.  Thank you for introducing me to lamb chops!

This was my first time fixing any type of lamb, and it was my friend's first time eating it.  He loved it and said he would definitely eat it again.  I agree, it was good.  I did not add the basil, and I used garlic pepper.  We really liked the reduction.  Very good dish and easy to prepare.

The balsamic vinaigrette reduction was soooo good. When I usually make something new, I tweak the recipe a little bit. Not this time. It was perfect just as is!

These were okay but the vinegar was a little overpowering once reduced.

I make this frequently for my husband and he loves it. I tried it tonight with Fig Balsamic and I think it might even made the sauce better. You cannot go wrong with this recipe!

Absolutely Fab! Didn't have any thyme, but did have a little dried mint that I sub'd in that worked great. Served it on a bed of stir fried kale and cabbage with some roasted sweet potatoes on the side.  Really awesome, and will be my go to  for lamb chops.

It was great!  And I think that Sauce would be good on anything- it was good on rice and I'm going to try it on vegetables next.

Hubby & I love it!! but I did use Panera Bread's Balsamic Vinegar as many of the reviewers said a poor Balsamic would sink this recipe.

I don't eat lamb but my spouse does and I'm willing to cook it for him. I found this recipe and read several of the reviews, so I decided to give it a go. From the sounds coming from him, I gather it was rather delicious. I didn't change anything except I didn't have shallots, so I subbed in a few pinches of Epicure 3 onion mix. Served it up with baked baby potatoes and asparagus. I'll be making this again.

WONDERFUL recipe!  I'll be making this again.  It was just as simple to make as it sounds.  I did not add any salt, the chicken broth provided plenty.

This sauce has excellent flavor, and reduced properly, has an excellent consistency.  It works great on chicken as well.  Plan to try it on beef next.

I never cook lamb in my life. My husband is very picky with food. He was worried about how I cook it. It turned out very very good...he loves it so much:)  I also cook small potatoes with Rosemary. It matches perfect!!! Will definitely cook it again.

My husband was skeptcal about this but it has now become a fave in our house.  We double the sauce to have extra for the rice we serve with it. Paired it with Skillet-Braised Brussels Sprouts (found the recipe on this site also). Love it

I made these chops last night and they were delicious. Shame on you, PGRAYMENDOZA, for turning my husband and me into little pigs! So easy to make, and perfect with potatoes and sauteed spinach. There are many  starch/veggie combos I'm sure they'd pair well with, and I will be trying them all, because this recipe was a smash hit that I will be returning to again soon!

I have made this recipe several times exactly as written. The only change I have made is to use fresh herbs when they are available. It has been perfect every time. Excellent recipe for someone who had never cooked lamb chops before.

No way my kids would eat lamb. I tried this with bacon wrapped sirloin filets, and the first bite we let out a collective gasp. It was that good.

Made this for my wife this evening.  She is sometimes iffy on lamb but she absolutely loved these lamb chops.  The sauce makes the dish.  Follow the directions exactly for the perfect sauce to ladle over the pan fried chops.

Made no changes to this recipe and it was perfect! I don’t eat lamb, but I tired a bite of this with the balsamic reduction and it was very tasty. The husband raves about it and says this it a favorite dish. The reduction did take some time, but well worth it! Good thing is you really don’t have to stir constantly like some dishes. I did this all in a cast iron skillet and plated with crispy garlic red potatoes.

Thank you for the tips for getting quality aged balsamic vinegar, steel pan rather than nonstick, and giving the sauce time to actually reduce! Turned out great! I was impressed with the recipe. I used fresh herbs, marinated for about an hour, and it turned out great! Served with bed of fresh spinach and mixed salad greens :)

I use a pear flavored balsamic vinegar and it turned out great. Good technique to use on any meat. 
I cooked 4 minutes a side and it wasn't overly rare but still had some pink and was juicy and tender. 
Used a cast iron and I don't think using a non-stick would give you the same results as you won't have any fond.

This was a hit all the way around. My son and I made this for dinner and my husband actually said and I quote, "you could put this on a menu at any restaurant". Now, to be fair, I did make some changes. I used a cast iron pan and garlic infused olive oil to cook the lamb in. I doubled the sauce and used two cloves of minced garlic in addition to the shallots. Also, I added a couple of tablespoons of cream to the sauce. Just before serving, when adding the butter, I also melted some blue cheese into the sauce. The reduction was amazing. The lamb was cooked perfectly as per the instructions given. When serving, I topped each lamb chop with some crumbled blue cheese and the reduction. On the side I served blue cheese and chive infused mashed potatoes and a nice garden salad. I would absolutely make this again. The reduction is also very versatile and could be used with many different meats. I can't wait to try it with steak next!

Detour from the beaten path and what a splendid detour it was! The recipe comes together splendidly in flavor and the times mentioned for cooking are practically spot on. Lamb turned out medium and the sauce went great not only on the meat but turned the spinach/arugala bed I made into a sort of warm salad. This is a perfect representation of what lamb can be for those that don't eat it often. And its very easy to make without a lot of attention. Set the timer and let that meat sear and just tent with foil when done. You will be thrilled with how tender and flavorful it turns out by just leaving it alone :)

I don't have the words to say how awesome this dish tasted. The only thing I did different was reduced the sauce a little more than half. I served it with garlic and chive mashed potatoes and asparagus. Definitely try this dish. You will love it.

This recipe was perfect. I don't like rare meat so I seared the lamb for 5 minutes per side and it was still tender and juicy. I also added a handful of sliced mushrooms with the shallots. I will definitely be making this again.

excellent recipe.  first time I cooked lamb and it turned out amazing,  used my cast iron frying pan and the sauce reduced down quickly. Served it with roasted potatoes and also roasted mixed vegetables (asparagus red and yellow peppers green beans and red onion), all tossed in olive oil and garlic and baked in oven. I will be making this again for sure!

Made this for Easter this past weekend. It was really good. It was the first time I've cooked lamb chops and will definitely use this recipe again. Very easy recipe.   The only thing I did differently was reduce the balsamic vinegar a bit as my husband is a huge fan of it.  The mistake I made, was I didn't reduce the chicken broth, so the sauce was a bit thin, but still delicious.

Made following the recipe exactly. My chops were thicker than 3/4 inches but "cook to desired temp" is easy. They get a lovely crisp on the outside.  Be careful with the reduction... Mine got away from me and was almost too reduced, but the flavor was rich and amazing. Definitely will cook again and again

Excellent recipe and the balsamic reduction sauce is excellent. Only change I made was I used chopped red onion since I didn't have shallots. Definitely will make again.

I love Lamb and was concerned that the recipe would covered the great taste of these little gems. I was wrong! The herb rub was perfect and the sauce was just the right compliment. My wife was impressed. As always the instant read thermometer is key for me.

This was only my second time making lamb chops.  (The first time doesn't count, they were bought by someone else and were prepackaged with marinade).  Even though I was unable to get the good Balsamic, it still was tasty.  I will definitely do this again with the right Balsamic next time.   One word of caution to folks not familiar with cooking lamb chops, DON'T overcook them.  I might have done mine a bit too long.  They were still good, but could have been more tender.  That may have been the cut though, too.   I served them with pan fried rosemary potatoes and placed the chops on salad greens.  I used the sauce as a dual purpose dressing for the greens as well.  The whole meal was done within an hour, so not bad and the house smelled wonderful!

Well, yes, I did make a major change. I substituted pork loin chops for the lamb. I just happened to have some thick pork on hand and thought it sounded like a fit. The taste was quite good, but the pork turned out a little tough. perhaps a bit over cooked.

I used Fresh rosemary and fresh thyme and added some whole pine nuts. And the flavour and aroma was exotic and welcomed.

I used a Tbl. of flour to the shallots and a little less balsalmic  this allowed the sauce to thicken.
I will certainly make this again it was delicious.

This recipe was excellent and, just as it states, extremely easy! I made it for our Valentines Day dinner  and my hubby LOVED it! I don't eat any red meats so I seared some Scallops and poured the Balsamic reduction on top and it too was aaaamazing!!!! Definitely a dish I will prepare for company or another romantic meal!

Followed directions and it was excellent! ! Will make over & over.  I  used 20 year aged balsamic vinegar. .It reduced and did not take away from lamb flavor..did the rub exactly on chops & they seared perfectly.   Gourmet meal that is so easy & mouth-watering!!  Definitely recommend  highly!!!! Love, love, love!!!

Great!  I followed the recipe exactly, except my lamb chops were thicker so I had to increase the cooking time.  I made it for a birthday dinner with rice pilaf and roasted vegetables.

I really enjoyed this dish, but I like lamb on the grill more.  That being said, it was a nice medley of spices and the sauce is good.   I added crushed fresh garlic to the mix.  As one reviewer suggested, I had a fresh pear, sliced it, and sauteed that in the pan after making the balsamic reduction.  That was a nice compliment to the lamb.

My lamb chops were bigger than 3/4'' and so longer cook time would have been necessary, which I did not do. I followed the recipe for the reduction but it was still a bit too liquidy......i will use less chicken stock next time. The rub is delicious, I had no dried basil and so used fresh - it was very tasty.
I am VERY pleased with this flavourful, easy recipe which this working Mom even made 'on a school night' !!!

I've used this recipe a number of times and it always turns out great!  Sometimes I'll use red wine instead of balsamic or in addition to it. I use heavy cream instead of stock to make it creamy.

Excellent - made it according to the recipe - no changes. Perfect taste and combination of flavors! Thanks for sharing the recipe. After cooking the chops, I let them sit for a few minutes and then added the juices to the sauce while it was reducing. I did add the chops into the reduced sauce for a minute before taking them out and then putting the sauce over the chops before serving. I used a cast iron skillet  and good balsamic vinegar - perfect.

This was excellent. Lamb is my favorite red meat, and is eaten maybe twice a year at the most. With this recipe, it may be more.  Quick and easy for a week night dinner.  The only change I made was to use a high end raspberry balsamic vinegar because I had no other kind.  The reduction was perfect, and the butter gave the sauce a very rich flavor. I used a mortar and pestle to really grind the spices together before rubbing them on the lamb chops.

Really tasty. Did my lamb about 3 mins on first side and 2 on second side and kept warm in tin foil in oven whilst i did the sauce. Ended up with beautiful rare lamb and lovely sauce. Substituted shallot for finely chopped onion as i had some in the house

I made this using extra salt and a bit of water instead of chicken broth (because I realized I didn't have any at the last minute) and used the herbs generously over the meat... much more than the quantities suggested. This turned out delicious and was so easy!

Great flavor and the balsamic is not too over-powering.  Good for a fancy dinner that isn't too involved.  It's a messy dish with the bones and skillet splatter.   I had to cook 3-4 minutes per side on the lamb.

Delicious!  We both really like lamb, but I'm always a bit afraid to cook it because it seems so easy to ruin!  I followed this recipe with the 0NLY substitution being I used green onions because I didn't have any shallots on hand.  Green onions weren't bad, but shallots would have been much better.  As per other reviewers, the key is in the balsamic reduction.  I tasted the sauce early on in the cooking (very strong, vinegar-y) and later at completion--a completely different, rich, mellow taste and texture.  Served with rice with a little of the sauce over the rice--excellent!  We will definitely make this again.

Fantastic! I used unsalted butter for the sauce at the end. My husband and I devoured this as soon as it was out of the pan. I recommend adding some good, fresh carrots and mashed potatoes with this as they were well complimented with the remainder of the sauce. My kids even loved it.

This recipe was perfect as written. It will become my "go to" lamp chop recipe from now on. Easy and fairly foolproof.
I used a high quality balsamic that I buy locally at LeRoux Kitchen in Portland, ME and I think that made for a more luscious, full-bodied sauce.

Very good and fast recipe, tastes great, I placed the chops on mashed potato, I think a little garlic added to the chops would make this a little better.

The sauce is delicious, we agreed it was the best lamb chops we ever had. My chops were one inch thick so had to increase the time an extra 3 minutes per side for medium.

Terrific. The only challenge I had was adjusting the cooking time for chops that were about 1 1/2 inches thick. I doubled it (7 min) but could have gone longer. They were delicious though and I generally don't like lamb. My 2 year old loved them as well. I served them with a green salad and roasted potatoes.

Didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used merlot wine. I also added garlic powder and dry parsley to the seasoning rub.  
I've never made lamb before...and this was excellent!

This receipe turned out delicious! I served this on a bed of sauteed spinach and roasted garlic mashed potatoes. The balsamic reduction complimented the lamb chops nicely and the consistency was perfect. This recipe was easy to prepare and turned out just as good, if not better than something served in a high end restaurant.

First time cooking lamb.  I looked around and settled for this recipe.  Seemed easy enough.  Considered the advice and bought a nice bottle of aged balsamic vinegar and this recipe was exactly what I was going for, very tasty lamb dish.  This one is a keeper for sure.

Simple, hearty and delicious are my words to describe this dish! The reduction complements the lamb perfectly. I simmered the reduction for longer than 5 minutes because I prefer a thicker, syrupy texture.

I used green scallions instead of shallots because our grocery store was out of  shallots. It was fantastic! My 5 year old wouldn't try it (but then she had just eaten at school) but hubby, baby girl, and myself all loved it! 

Will definitely make this again.

This was fantastic. I didn't have shallots on hand so I substituted a big clove of garlic and 1/4 cup of white onion. The balsamic reduction is absolutely delicious and would be good on steak, chicken, tuna, or salmon too. I forgot to add the butter in at the end but I really didn't miss it.

Really great. I wanted to make sure the meat was cooked all the way through as my cuts were about an inch thick so I seared for 3 min on each side at medium high temperature. Then added shallots aged balsamic and chicken broth and baked for 20 min on 350 covered on top rack. Turned out delicious and tender.

I made this last night for my husband and I for supper. We have never had lamb chops before but this was actually pretty good  we enjoyed it, especially the balsamic vinegar gravy. Highly recommend you use good aged balsamic for sure. Fancy enough for company. My husbands only complaint was that chops were small LOL

We all loved it.  We are lamb lovers. We mostly have lamb shanks and roasts. Usually with lots of garlic and well done.  I trusted the positive reviews and made it as written - no garlic and medium done. It was fabulous.   I cooked it in an iron skillet which gave it a nice brown exterior. The recipe is a keeper. I added some summer sweet cherry tomatoes to the sauce after the broth was added. It was very complimentary

Amazing! I followed the recipe as directed. I think one of the keys to getting it right is to use very fine quality balsamic. There is a HUGE difference in both consistency and flavor.

I made this for a special occasion I had with my husband. It was sooo good! I followed the recipe very closely the first time and my husband loved it. We have made it many times since. We have used onions instead of shallots, and I can't tell the difference. We have also not always used lamb chops. We used steak as well and it was still very good!

I doubled the reduction and added an 1/8 tspn of cornstarch to bind it.  Absolutely my new favourite and my family's!  I did use an expensive bottle of balsamic vinegar we got at a specialty shop last summer and I had never found any use for it.  My family does not even like the smell.  They loved this.

I pulverized the spice rub with a mortar and pestle before rubbing on the lamb.  The balsamic reduction worked very well for me and was very tasty.  Good aged balsamic vinegar is important.  It took a while for the sauce to reduce as I had doubled the recipe, and next time I will cook even a little longer.  I think  the sauce could be made to make a special dish out of pork chops, grilled chicken or even beef.

I love this recipe!  I confess I took the shortcut of using a roast rub on the lamb before cooking but only because I didn't have all the ingrediance on hand.  I was able to follow the recipe for the balsamic sauce exactly and it was awesome!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Made this for some friends for a special birthday lunch, it was a huge hit! Due to my friends dairy allergy used coconut oil in sauce and still turned out fantastic. Will make again for sure! I doubled the recipe with no problems..

This was my first time making lamb chops. I really do not care for lamb, But my husband was wanting to try lamb chops. This recipe is not so much for the first time cook. I do not do many reduction sauces and it seemed like it took my sauce forever to reduce (30+ minutes!) I still feel like it could have sit simmering for a few more minutes my sauce was still very "vingerary." I reduced my sauce in a stainlees steel copper band saute pan. MY husband said the dish was good was time consuming though.

We absolutely loved this recipe.  Like other reviewers, I didn't have the aged vinegar so I used the balsamic vinegar I did have.  To reduce the strong vinegar taste, I added 1/4 cup more of the chicken broth and 3 Tbls honey.  The reduction was beautifully done w/in 5 minutes.

Good but more work than I want to put into a meal.  Also  for some reason lamb is not real easy to find within the budget.

Wonderful blend of flavored..easy to make. Don' forget the butter at the end as it really softens the vinegar. Great served with mashed potatoes.

This is delicious.  I've made this on several occasions.  While I have had issues with reducing the balsamic jus, it tasted fantastic anyway.  I didn't even care that there was extra left over because that sauce tastes great on a sandwich the next day!

This is amazing.The sauce alone is worth 5 stars. You can usually get this type sauce at a high end restaurant. Best served with garlic bread and mashed potatoes. I also had mushrooms, red pepper and tomatoes grilled after marinating. The meal is certainly  a keeper.

Amazing! I used for the Balsamic Vinegar 1/2 with regular supermarket balsamic vinegar and 1/2 Balsamic Glaze (also available at many grocery stores). At the end, I sprinkled a dash of dried mint leaves on top of the lamb. A great dish and certainly one to save and make again!

This is a fantastic recipe for both lamb chops and pork chops. When I'm making pork chops, I'll add a couple cloves of garlic, finely chopped, to the shallots.

I LOVED THESE!  So easy to make and so tasty.  Made them exactly as specified in the recipe; but like some others noted, it did take longer to reduce.  My husband also thought they were fantastic.  My chops were a bit thicker so I had to really watch them to make sure they were cooked enough.  I will definitely make these again.

Very easy, very good! Only one comment - the sauce must be reduced for quite a while. 5 min was not nearly enough, I think I reduced for ~20min. I kept tasting it and eventually it tasted right and had the right consistency.
Thanks for a great and easy recipe - this is a keeper!

Very tasty.  Only two issues:  the addition of a bit of minced garlic to the reduction recipe as others have mentioned is of benefit.  In addition, The time and amount of the reduction are off.  On my stove over med-high heat I added two minutes to the five recommended and got the reduction down to just over 1/2 but it was still too runny.  I would say it's better to heat the reduction at med-high for 8-10 minutes and to wait for the reduction to reach about 1/4 to 1/3 of the original volume.  You want it to be the consistency of gravy.

I'll try this again with a thinner reduction.

excellent!!! the only change i made was a pinch of cinnamon in the reduction and i used fresh herbs that i steeped in olive oil and sunflower oil and then rubbed that all over the chops and let them sit a while... everything was organic too.

I have been trying to incorporate more grass fed, antibiotic free meats in our lives and I was a wreck about cooking lamb. This recipe was AWESOME! It was a hit with my entire family-THANK YOU! I didn't have shallots so I used garlic and about a tbls of leeks chopped up. It was fabulous!

Wow!! As others have said, this tasted like it came straight out of the most expensive restaurant you've ever been to.  It is crucial that you use a high-quality, AGED balsamic vinegar.  I think that the people who complained of a "vinegary" taste must have used a low quality one.  Everything else I did exactly the same, except that the herb rub stayed on the lamb a bit longer than 15 mins, but the flavor was just right regardless.  Next time, I'll try increasing the shallots for a more chunky sauce and I would love to try adding some mushrooms in.  Served this with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Beyond heavenly, perfect Valentine's Day meal for us!  Thank you!!

Husband just served this with a rice pilaf and brussel sprouts. OUTSTANDING!!!! Thanks for sharing.  He prepared just as documented with one exception.  He put the rub on the meat and refrigerated for 3 hours.  it was so good, for dessert I scooped up pan drippings and put on a slice of whole wheat bread. Fantastic!!!!

My family absolutely loves these lamb chops!  I follow the recipe exactly except I usually can't find shallots so I use the white part of green onions.  Yummy!

Wonderful, simple dish...quick enough for a weeknight dinner, would also be great for company.  Served this with roasted winter squash, which was great with the pan sauce.

My husband said this was phenomenal, and even my 2 & 4 year old ate it.  I've been a vegetarian for 22 years, am not very good at cooking meat, and even I managed to make it without too much trouble.  Win win!  I did not have shallots, so I used a small amount of red onion and a few shakes of garlic powder.  Oh, and I just realized I never added the salt or pepper.  Seems it was not missed!

Absolutely fabulous! And great for pork chops, too. I do think the meat takes just a bit longer to cook, and I did find that the reduction took longer to reduce than it says. But this is probably my favorite new recipe this year. I CRAVE it!!

I made this just as the recipe calls for, except cooked the lamb chops for 4 1/2 minutes per side instead of 3 1/2 - they came out nice and pink and so tasty!

Excellent as is. Reduced sauce to 1/4 cup and it was delicious. My husband rated this a 5 as well. Used 1" thick loin chops, they took 5 minutes per side and I let them rest for 10 minutes. Done perfectly.

This was the first time I tried to cook lamb and I was pleasantly surprised.  My sauce did not turn out but I think that's because I didn't let it cook long enough.  That being said, it was good enough that I will give it another shot. I made Company Couscous as the side.

I didn't even have to buy the most expensive aged balsamic vinegar.  Just be sure to give it enough time to reduce to a thick sauce.  I will be using this blend of seasonings, along with the sauce for other meats in the future, as well.

This recipe is INCREDIBLE. Since discovering it on this site 2 months ago I have made it every week at my family's request.

The sauce is wonderful, I always make it with Barley and the flavors blend together really well.

Thank you so much!

OMG, this was the best lamb chop recipe I have tried in recent memory. And it was very easy. I used a good quality balsamic and added sliced mushrooms while I braised the chops because I had them. Brilliant. Thanks.

We followed this exactly, except we plated on a bed of spinach leaves.  Our toddlers liked it and the reduction made a great dressing for the spinach.  We'll be making this one again!  Next time we'll do use scallops instead of lamb to change it up.

I made this for my boyfriend and I for a romantic evening and it was perfect. Easy to make and so delicious. I hardly changed anything besides adding a little more herbs. The reduction complements the lamb chops perfectly.

Before this recipe, I had never had lamb chops, and this recipe was wonderful. I make it all of the time and my firends and family love it.

Three to four times a year I made braised lamb shanks that take me ALL DAY.  This is a close second to my time consuming shanks, but so much easier. Very, very tasty and easy.

Very tasty - I didn't have any broth so I substituted with milk.   Used garlic instead of shallots.  Only downfall is that it's very greasy, with the oil.  I will use much less oil next time.

Delicious! Once it was done I layed the lamb chops on a bed of rice and add a side of Asparagus.   Very tasty! Thank you!

This was one of the best recipes I have ever made. It was like butter melting in my mouth. I did make a few changes though. I added a small amount of fresh chopped mint for the rub and for the sauce i used half/half to replace the chicken broth. I will have to say to make a perfect lamb chop the key is the timing for the cooking. If you do each side at 3 minutes it will come out perfect. If it is any longer it will be to tough. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

This is my very first experience cooking, or eating lamb chops, but I really enjoyed it. Being such a newbie, I obviously can't compare the taste to other lamb recipes I've had, but I'll definitely make this again. It's easy and tasty.

A wonderful flavor!  I will make this one again.  I didn't have any "great" Balsamic so I can only imagine how good it will be with a better balsamic.  I made a nice summer veggie risotto to go with the lamb.  Yummmmm

measurements needed adjusting.  to give the sauce enough body, more balsamic was needed.

This was amazing! Only problem I had was that my boyfriend didn't like the smell of the vinegar while I was making the sauce, otherwise, again, amazing! Only change I made was to reduce it even a little more then it was said to. Will definitely make again.

Delicious! Halved the recipe for 2 (not big eaters), but served w/ garlic bread & corn. Used white onions instead of shallots, still great, and used 5 leaves of fresh basil instead of dried. Otherwise, made as directed. First time hubby & I tried lamb, and we liked it a lot. Will make again with addition of garlic rub as other reviewers have suggested.

Made this with 2 cups chix broth, added some corn starch to thicken the rue. Hubby and I ate every last drop. I also added on the bottom of the plate some sliced baked apples. Nice mix of the sweet and vingary combo. Thx for the recipe.

My husband and I love Lamb and this was probably one of the best lambs I have prepared.  I did not like the strong vinegar taste so I added about 3 tablespoons of heavy cream.  It came out absolutely divine.  My husband almost liked his plate.

This was a good recipe, and in particular I appreciated the cooking time suggested for the lamb-- it was perfect!  The glaze was nice, but I would say that unless you serve it over greens like some reviewers said, it is unnecessary.  We had it for Easter and ate the lamb down with just a teaspoon of the sauce each, and it felt a bit shameful after THAT was the part that was the hardest work!  Next time, I'll do it either with no sauce, or serve it over something like greens and use the sauce to its fullest.

I follow this recipe pretty closely, except for the shallots. i also added a little bit of garlic. I left the rub on for about 40 min and It came out fantastic! my bf HATES balsamic vinegar, but he loved it as part of the sauce. Anyways.. YUMMY!

Easy and delicious recipe.  I only used two lamb chops and had just enough balsamic reduction for the two and to drizzle on mixed greens.  I recommend doubling the recipe if you plan to use the four it calls for.

Just made this and I do not see what all the fuss is about.  I usually just eat my lamb chops with nothing on them at all, so I decided to give this recipe a whirl.  It gave the chops a sweeter flavor and that was about it.  The spices on the chops I would definitely do again as it brought out even more flavor, but the sauce I might skip for next time.

Definitely 5 stars for this recipe. I don't cook a lot and when I do, I want something easy and tasty. These chops were both. Incredibly simple to make and delicious!

Although it does not call for garlic.... I did use minced galic in the marinade,  it's just what I do.  Big hit with me and I got a not bad for someone who swears that they hate lamb! 2 thumbs up here...

Wow! My husband made this for us tonight. Although instead of shallots he added the zest of one lemon, and 2 cloves of garlic, and added that to the seasonings, and made it all into a paste with the olive oil. Spread it onto the chops and seared them. Absolutely wonderful, the sauce went well over brown rice also. Will make this a regular for lamb.

Great recipe, easy to make. Although I agree you have to use your best balsamic vinegar. I ended up using a speciality fig balsamic that you can find at many specialty shops. The added flavor was awesome.

Great dish.  New to cooking and my 1st time with lamb. Soaked 4 chops in milk for 15 min. since the Mr. doesn't like "lamby taste."  Used Herbes de Provence, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder, and marinated for 1 hr.  Great flavor. Cooked lamb in reduction for 10 minutes at the end. Will work on getting lamb more tender next time, but a definite keeper and he ate it all up!!

simple and very tasty and the balsamic vinegar doesnt overtake the taste of lamb- i used vegetable broth instead of chicken-dont think it makes a difference.

VERY nice, mild and flavorful.  I wish we'd had more lamb to cook.  It went too fast.  We added garlic which really added a lot of flavor.  Lovely!

I made this for my boyfriend and I for dinner last night.  The sauce really made a difference to the flavor of this lamb.  I had never made lamb before and was nervous about how it would turn out.  I was very surprised at how easy and tasty this receipe was.  Makes a very elegant dinner for two.

This is a difficult recipe to make as my lamb chops splattered oil everywhere and took 4x as long to cook! The reduction tasted yummy but was really watery. My husband LOVED the recipe but I was so tired from making it that it wasn't worth 5 stars to me.

Unbelievably good and easy.  I know a great meat store so I generally cook the chops for longer as they are thicker than the recipe specifies.  A very very good recipe.

Delicious! This is a wonderful option for lamb chops. However, I did have to boil the sauce longer than 5 minutes to reduce by half. Just keep an eye on it.

OH MY LORD, were these chops DELISH... 
I had tried lamb chops some years ago and did not care for them at all. After meeting my husband ( a lamb chop lover ) he convinced me to try them again, so i searched and searched for a recipe that just might be palatable for me. 
I LOVE these lamb chops, the only thing I did differently, was added garlic powder to the seasoning. 
Make sure you use a high quality Balsamic... makes it so much better! Although, i did make these one time and did not realize I was out of Balsamic until after I had already browned the chops so I had to substitute with something, so I used red wine vinegar.. and it wasnt too bad, but not as good as Balsamic. .
Thanks for a terrific recipe!!

My husband(not a lamb lover) Loved this recipe!  We served it with a Pinot Noir wine, fresh asparagus, fresh  corn-on- the cob and cantaloupe.
We will use this recipe again.

Totally Amazing!  Easy, Delicious,First Class.  Trust the recipe.  After you remove the chops, turn up the heat a bit to speed the reduction.  If you have a warmer to hold the meat, that will be helpfull because it did take some time for the sauce to reduce.  I served this with asparagus and a light-cream pasta.  I tasted like something from a fine restraunt.

Due to the length of time to reduce the sauce, the chops continued to cook past medium, while holding, and ended up served medium well.  Prepared in a cast iron skillet.  The taste was great.  Next time will sear in skillet and remove, then prepare sauce.

Delicious! I used fresh herbs instead of dry. I also added freash parsley and oregano, as well as a little fresh garlic to the rub.  I let the rub sit on the lamb for about an hour.  The balsamic reduction takes this dish to next level. I didn't have shallotts so I just used onion. I also dissolved some cornstarch in water and added it to the pan a few minutes before the reduction was done just to thicken it up a bit.  My husband loved this dish.  I can't wait to make it for company.  Thanks!

I didn't get to the "balsamic reduction" because I used this recipe for a meal I left for hubby to cook. I just mixed the dry herbs and left him to rub and grill (his cooking method of choice). He and his sister said the chops turned out soooo good. Rub couldn't have been simpler. I was worried about using dried instead of fresh herbs (I love a fresh rosemary), but I think it turned out well regardless.

It's hard to go wrong with lamb, but this was a great simple recipe that was just delish.  The weather was perfect for grilling today, so I did a quick sear of one side of a rack of lamb in the pan, then I moved it to indirect heat on the grill to finish for that smokey flavor.  Plus I had the pan drippings from the one side sear for the sauce.  I served it with a leek risotto, roasted red peppers and peas.  Delish.

I love lamb chops on the grill-decided to try this recipe...AWESOME!  I followed the recipe and used good vinegar as suggested...delish!  I can't wait to make this when my organic share of shallots comes in later this summer.  Served it with roasted garlic asparagus and salad...a perfect Weekend splurge dinner!

I really liked this recipe, it was easy to prepare and my friends really enjoyed it! In the future I would omit the onions since I didn't care for the texture of them in the reduction. But all around it was a great meal!

Very tasty - good lamb is a must, as is good balsamic vinegar. Adding garlic is an option, but not necessary, even for a garlic-nut like me, since the flavors of the reduction are so delectable. Nice one! Will do again!

Made this for Easter Sunday Dinner for me and my Husband. My Hubby couldn't stop raving about it! This was my first time making lamb chops and it turned out great. I made it with Garlic Asparagus with Lime , and Garlic Mashed Red Potatoes. We had left over potatoes and my Husband just *had* to save the reduction sauce to have over the potatoes. We each had two chops each since it's hard to get any meat off them.

Absolutely delicious, just be careful not to overcook the lamb.  Medium-rare is the best.  I also like to serve it with potatoes au gratin.

Loved the Lamb, Hated the Sauce!
I followed directions exactly, and did as many suggested, using high quality, aged balsamic vinegar. Like others my experience was that it took longer than 5 minutes for the reduction to be where it should be but as it finished it appeared spot-on.
The lamb smelled wonderful while cooking which enticed the hubby. So then there was the husband taste-test. He first tried the chops which he absolutely loved as they were cooked with the spices.  Then the sauce....not so much love there. He said all he could taste was vinegar and scallops and when combined with the chops the flavor was "too busy". He doesn't care much for condiments so if you're cooking for someone who prefers the taste of meat by itself, this may be too much for them.  I'm a vegetarian so I don't know, I just cook the stuff!

I made this with chicken since I'm not a big lamb fan.  It was fantastic!  Next time I won't bother measuring out the spices though ... I'll just shake them on liberally.

Very good! Loved the flavor & the butter really adds to it. This was my 1st time making a reduction sauce & while it took forever :) it was well worth it. The reduction also works well with steaks.

Simply amazing. Better than restaurant quality. The only thing I did different than this recipe was cook the sauce longer than 5 minutes. I maybe cooked it for 10 - 15. It came out perfect. Love this.

Really good flavor, the first time I've ever had balsamic anything so I don't have much to compare it to but I liked it. I will take other revieewers suggestions and soak the lamb before cooking because of the lamby taste (my second time eating lamb) but I could see using the marinade on other meats as well. The meat was a little fatty but thats not the recipes fault:) I just didn't pick the right cut. I will definetly make again and I will probably use other meats as well. P.S. Definetly go with the higher quality balsamic

I made this for my husband the night before he left on a 9-day elk hunt.  It was incredible.  The flavors were like a bouquet on our tongue!  Paired it with yukon gold mashed potatoes and grilled eggplant for a quick and easy gourmet meal.  Thank you!

Excellent recipe. The reduction was a bit strong in the beginning of the cooking process, but mellowed out nicely. Made this with sauce for both lamb and boneless chicken breasts. This one is going straight to the recipe box! Thanks for the winner!

YUMMY!!! I wish I had more lambchops to make more!  I wasn't sure how it would taste because the sauce was so dark and it really didn't look appetizing, but it smelled good and tasted GREAT! This was our first time eating lambchops too!

This recipe was simple and delicious.  I cut the recipe in half and had to add a lot more stock and vinegar to the sauce, but I may have been cooking it on too high a temperature (I am learning!!)  Thanks for the recipe.

I've never reviewed recipes before (sorry I probably should because I use them to decide if I will cook it or not) but I had to chime in on this one.  

It was fantastic.  So flavourful and easy.  Probably one of the best things I've cooked.  I would recommend this to anyone

A-MA-ZING!  I used only two lamb chops and followed the recipe exactly. It took about 10 minutes to reduce the sauce  and it was to die for.  Tastes like such a sophisticated dish but doesn't take too long.  I was scraping the plate for those last juices, yum!

Due to being in the "heart" of S. America, we could not find lamb chops, but replaced with Pork Chops and it still turned out excellent, especially paired with a good Argentine wine!

Excellent sauce! Good lamb is next to impossible to find in our area.  So per other reviewers suggestions, substituted pork tenderloin, sliced into medallions, for the lamb.  Patience is required for a good reduction sauce, but well worth the time.  Otherwise, easy and tasty recipe.

Made this for a dinner party and it was fabulous! Take care to not overcook the lamb, medium rare to medium is perfect. I had extra balsamic reduction, so I filled an ice tray with the remaining sauce & froze it. I used it over chicken breasts and it was amazing!

This is a great easy recipe to make. I made this for my boyfriend and he was quite impressed. It was really easy to make, but it seemed very impressive, like I slaved over the stove all day. The key to this is going the a good butcher shop. Get a nice cut of lamb. Also, I bought an expensive 15 year aged balsamic vinegar and it was well worth it. Also, I just used the Herbs de Provence as the rub, and marinated overnight. I seared the lamb for about 2 minutes on either side, then finished them in the oven for about 10 minutes. Came out to about medium which is how I like my lamb anyways. I served this with roasted asparagus and roasted potatoes with a green salad. My BF said it was better than most restaurants hes been to. This is great to prepare for company as well, since it is easy, yet seems to impressive with the sauce.

The glaze for this recipe was amazing!!!  It was my first try of Lamb Chops and I have to admit I'm not a fan of the meat but the sauce made it too good to pass up.  I will use this recipe again with another meat substitute like pork chops.  Thanks!!

Absolutely delicious! I added a bit of whipping cream to the sauce to make it a bit more creamier. It turned out to be very nice. I didn't use an expensive balsamic vinegar, it only cost me less than 1 pound, bought it from tesco, its called Monari Federzoni. It was still delicious.

I love the sauce! I am not a big fan of lamb but will try this recipe with beef or pork. My lamb lover husband loved this.

This recipe is the best I have found. I always double the recipe and it turns out perfect everytime, even when I forget the butter at the end! My husband wants the weekly!

My family enjoyed this recipie, but I did make a few modifications to the original:

1. I doubled the herbs- the amount called for did not adequately cover 4 lamb chops.

2. I poured olive oil over top of the herbs before letting  the meat marinate. 

3. Instead of cooking the chops in olive oil, I substituted coconut oil because the former is carcinogenic at high temperatures.

4. I followed the advice of another reciewer who suggested adding a pinch of flour to the sauce which makes it a bit thicker.

5. My chops did not come out as tender as I would have liked-- I'm not sure if this was due to how I cooked them or the chops themselves, but next time I will try this recipie in the oven instead of stove top.

Thanks for the recipie! The shallots add a wonderful flavor!

These were good - I don't think that we would write home about them - but would make them again if the taste arises!  (Just a note to others who may be not as cooking savvy like me.... if you double or quadruple the sauce like I did - plan to adjust the reduction time as well.  Didn't quite clue into that until DURING the process!)

Wonderful! I couldn't wait long enough for it to reduce too much, so it was kind of runny...the consistency of au jous, and it still tasted delicious. Served with steamed green beans and artichoke risotto.

doubled the sauce and added a few dashes of magii and it was excellent.  Also, used it again later over some sauteed green beans with bacon.  Yummy!

This was gorgeous! Used slightly more herbs, and let them absorb for slightly longer. But all in all, delicious! Will be making again very soon. Served with roasted peppers and carrots with a drizzle of olive oil, lemon juice and seasoned with salt and pepper. Compliments it perfectly. Thankyou for this awesome recipe! x

This was delicious!  My husband and I both loved it and we're not big lamb fans.  I served it with roasted red, orange peppers and portobello mushrooms.  The sauce is fabulous drizzled on the veggies as well as the chops.  I only had onion - it'll be so much better with shallots, I'm sure.

This was okay.  We hadn't had lamb before & I think the chops we got were too fatty...so that may have added to our dislike.  I probably would try this again only if the chops weren't so fatty.  I think this recipe has potential, but w.o the fatty chops.

This was the first lamb chops dish I've made. For first timers, this was definitely a boost of confidence! I was a little hesitant about the vinegar but it is a must! letting it a reduce and simmer really makes the difference .  The chops were nice and juicy. The combination of the balsamic + shallots + herbs could not have been more perfect. I will definitely be making this again =) Thanks!

This recipe was very easy and my 6 year old loved it.  I used Italian seasoning for the dry rub (Marjoram, Thyme, Rosemary, Sage, Oregano and Basil).  The sauce was wonderful!

This was fabulous.  I had never really cooked lamb before and this was easy but looked to be a complex dish when served. My boyfriend loved it and we have had it a few times since...tonight again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is one of my very favorite recipes because its quick and savory.  I enjoy it so much that I actually crave it after I haven't had it for awhile.  If you like lamb then I highly recommend this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly. The lamb was perfect.I've never cooked lamb before and we all loved this recipe. We served it with scalloped potatoes. We took the sauce and added it to the potatoes as we ate the potatoes. So good!!

This recipe is delicious and easy to make.  I don't even like lamb and I loved it.

Very tasty and very easy to prepare.  The reduction took a little longer than expected and I forgot to add the butter at the end but it still turned out fantastic!

I really enjoyed the sauce with the lamb.  My husband wasn't as crazy about them, so we'll give them 4 instead of 5.  Thanks for the recipe!

The taste was wonderful. My only complaint was that the chops were fatty/chewy. No fault of the recipe.

Cooking time was much longer for me (very thick chops).  Will definitely make again with thinner chops.  Thanks for the posting.

This was my husbands first experience with lamb - he loved it!!  I think I might have not reduced the sauce enough, but it tasted great.  It looks like from the picture that the sauce should be thicker.  We are going to make these again.

This was awesome!! I agree with the other reviews 100% the kids and adults and even the teens begged for 2nds and 3rds. I did add a small amount of brown sugar because I thought it might be to strong for the kids and I served that with ham for the little ones and lamb chops for the rest it was great on both. The reduction does take awhile as I doubles the amounts but it was well worth the wait.
this will definitely be on my menu again!!

very good flavor.  Next time I will marinate the chops for more infused flavor - it sort of felt like every bit of flavor was caked/poured on top, and the meat on the inside was virtually flavorless.  But great to start with and work with - I think I might try it for company!

We made this with pork chops rather than lamb.  The meat and herb rub was really good, but we weren't crazy about the balsamic reduction.... it did thicken up nicely (we used a little bit more butter than called for) but it was nothing special.

My boyfriend loves lamb and he said this was better than the restaurants! I added some garlic salt, as well as shallots to marinate. I also listened to another reviewer and bought a bottle of balsamic vinegar that was aged for 10 years. LOVED IT! Thanks!

Such unique flavors, surpisingly easy to make.  A wonderful dish! One note: I used a pricy, aged Modena Balsamic.  With a lower quality vinegar the sauce may have been overwhelming.

I wouldn't do this again, it is too vinegar-y. It MAY be because I had to muddle with a few things to get the right quantity, which is why I'm giving it the two stars - to allow for my errors.

i liked that the lamb chops were encrusted with herbs (which is why I gave it 2 stars), but the balsamic sauce was way too strong.  I can eat practically anything, but this I could not stomache, very overpowering.
