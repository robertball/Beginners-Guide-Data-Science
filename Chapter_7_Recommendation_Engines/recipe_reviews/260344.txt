This dish was pretty awesome and tasted just like it did on my last visit to Sicily - Basil and garlic are the stars in this dish. 
 I just omitted the cayenne pepper.

Turned out great - I didn’t have any cheese but was tasty without as well and I didn't use the pepper. I sautéed some onion and extra garlic for the tomato sauce. Easy and very good.
