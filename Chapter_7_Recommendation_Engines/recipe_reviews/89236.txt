I'm with "silence" here as I was not about to lose a whole bottle of my precious red wine on mushrooms. I too used a cup of the wine and a cup of the broth. Perfection to say the least! Made this to go with london broil tonight. Thanks a bunch Harry for a great recipe!

The best mushrooms I have ever eaten. Made blue cheese crusted filet mignon and needed 1/2 cup port red, used the rest on these. Turned out wonderful. Easier than I thought. Would suggest doubling the mushroom amount. There are not any left now :-(

I made these tonight, but only cooked them for 30 minutes with about 1/4 cup of wine and 1/4 cup of broth.  They were still awesome, but I don't really see the need for 2 hours and as much ingredient called for for a side dish.  Loved the flavors though.

i used button mushrooms that were halved so that it would resemble the burgundy mushrooms my hubby and i are so fond of. It was excellent! thought it would be too strong for the kids, but my 9yr old went back for seconds. thumbs up from everyone- thanks so much!!

I used this as the side/sauce for beef wrapped in puff pastry - and it truly was delish. I did not use button mushrooms, but instead used Crimini. 
The only things keeping it from a five-star review:
Very similar results can be had with far less wine and time. It's a rare day that I am willing to drop an entire bottle of a decent red into  a side/sauce to serve four.
That said - the flavor and texture are spectacular.
So, for special events - when you have a lot of time, don't mind the expense and want to truly impress - it's worth it.

I decreased the servings and cut back on the wine and broth. To me it tasted like soggy mushrooms that had the color of beets. We could taste the wine but that was about it.

Excellent. I doubled the recipe for 8 people and used 2 cups of wine and 2 cups of beef broth. Served as a side with prime rib.  These were delicious the following day as a toppeing for leftover prime ribe sandwiches.  Well worth the time & wine involved.

I thought these were just okay...I made as directed- although I cooked just under the full two hours, and with a bit less wine.  I don't like when other reviewers change a recipe and then negatively comment on its outcome, so I must say that the 3-star rating is not based on the amount of wine or the cooking time.  It has to do with the onions- maybe I'm just a "mushroom purist," but I didn't care for the addition.  I would make these again, but without the onion.

Excellent with steak.  I increased the serving amount but still reduced the amount of wine and beef broth and they came out awesome.

Definitely will be making again.

I made these last year twice and both times it was great-EVERYONE loved it.  I couldn't believe a whole bottle was good so I used more like 1/2 to 3/4 and it was great-I think a whole bottle would've beed fine. Oh-I used ground thyme the second time-much better.

We just did not enjoy this dish.  There seemed to be a LOT of onion.  I used 2 onions about the size of med-sm apples and removed a about half of them after the saute as there were so many.  The remaining onions I cut into smaller pieces than whole slices' to make it easier to blend in with the mushrooms.   By the time the dish was cooked, the mixture looked a very unappetizing deep red color and tasted quite strong although I used a nice red wine.  Everyone ate some but no one took seconds and no one raved about it either - least of all me.  I would not make this again.

I also used half the wine and broth, doubled the garlic and did the full 90 minutes plus a bit more as guests were late.  We had realy good steaks, and the mushrooms were more popular! Thanks for a great recipe.

I halved this recipe for two with 8oz mushrooms, but 1/2 of everything else.  Because the liquid was 1/2 it cooked down quickly.  Very delicious with our McCormick Montreal seasoning!

These are delicious with steak.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added a lot less wine and they still turned out wonderfully.  These will be a staple with our steak dinners from now on.  Great recipe!

I love mushrooms and was extremely disappointed in this recipe.  I followed others suggestion and used 1 cup wine/1 cup broth. The aroma was amazing, the taste was less than spectacular.  I've made much better from other recipes on this site.

This was delicious!  I make a similar dish increasing the amount of mushrooms to two pounds and using vermouth and beef boullion in place of the red wine and broth.  I usually only use one or two cups of wine and add a little more butter too.  It's a very flexible recipe and is wonderfully delicious no matter how much it's adjusted.  (I am a mushroom freak--can you tell? Yum!)

Delicious.   Use half a bottle on sangria wine instead without the added sugar.  Gives it a more natural sweetness to it.  It’s delicious.  Don’t need as much onion as it says here. Easy fun recipe for steak!

Really good, my wife and I enjoyed to dish over a hamburger steak.  I would agree with other reviews, a full bottle of wine is not needed.  I will certainly make this again with steak.

I really liked this recipe, although I did alter it by adding shallots, using cremini Mushrooms and reducing the amount of wine a bit. The thyme added a very nice flavor. I actually prepared this for a vegetarian meal and everyone really enjoyed them.

Fair recipe, just needs more flavour other than red wine, thinking Marsala wine or other sweet cooking wine would be good.

Don't let the cook time scare you, I made this as a last minute thing, my husband didn't want chicken and he usually over cooks the steaks HAHA so I knew we needed a topping! Because I didn't have the time to reduce the liquid I only added 14.5 oz of my favorite Red wine- so equal parts beef broth and red wine- I brought the mixture to a rolling boil for 15 minutes and then a slow simmered for another 15 minutes. Total cook time after the liquid was added was only 30 minutes...perfection! I WILL ABSOLUTELY be making this again! Next time, when there's more time, I will do the full bottle of wine and full 1 1/2 hours cook time.

While reading through all of the comments, I thought it would be too strong with all that wine. I left all of the directions and ingridients the same, except, I used red cooking wine and only used 14 oz to be equal to the beef broth.  I reduced it for just under an hour and it was the best topper for my steak, I even ate some for a side, the remaining juices are AMAZING!!

These were delicious.  Very rich though so I would reccomend using them as a topping for steak, rather than a side dish.  I made this with lamb chops in balsamic reduction (also from this site) and it turned out beautifully.  Thanks.

I halved the recipe and the taste was just not there for me. This recipe  seems similar to one of my favorites from a neighbor years ago, but not a replicate.  I wanted so much to love this, but kept on having to add more flavor, because it was bland. However, I do recommend trying this and see what you come up with!

I love this recipe!  I didn't have any wine to use so I used Worcestershire Sauce instead.  The mushrooms were still wonderful!  I received many compliments from my family!

This is an awsome recipe. I didn't have any thyme so I used rosemary. I also used 1 cup of wine and 1 cup of broth and it came out restaurant worthy. The flavor is outstanding. This was totally worth the time it took to make it!  Thanks!!

Very good! There are just two of us so I made 1/2 lb. mushrooms. I followed others' advice and used 1 cup wine and 1 cup broth. The rest I followed as written.  I did add a blop of butter to the finished product. My preference. Thank you, Harry! One of the best recipes I have tried on this site!

YUM!!!  I didn't have a ton of time so I took other reviewers advice and used only 1c wine/ 1c broth.  It only took a little longer than the steaks on the grill.  Can't wait to make this one for company!
