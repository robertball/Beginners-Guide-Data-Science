I used orange juice concentrate for more orange flavor. Interesting mocha. I don't think I would use cocoa powder if I made it again, I would use cocoa mix or chocolate syrup.

Well, this did really taste like orange flavored coffee. I just realized this combination of coffee, cocoa, and orange doesn't work for me. It may have worked if it was a little sweeter or had cream in it, I don't know. The tartness of the orange juice just made the coffee a little unpalatable to my taste buds. Others may like this though.
