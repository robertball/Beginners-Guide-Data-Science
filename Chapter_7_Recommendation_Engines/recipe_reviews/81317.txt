I used Idaho baking potatoes, cut in small pieces and put directly into crock pot.  Tossed potatoes with remaining ingredients and added a little olive oil for moisture.  Cooked until tender and the potatoes didn't fall apart.  Will definitely make again.

I used unpeeled baby Yukon Gold potatoes, and just eyeballed the rest of the ingredients. Very simple flavors which went beautifully with our meal of blackened tilapia, roasted asparagus, and chickpea salad. There is nothing here NOT to like!

I really enjoyed this side dish! My husband asks me to make it all the time with fish.  I do put it in the oven at 350 to let the garlic and dill infuse the potatoes.

I boiled the potatoes in generously salted water, rather than steaming them - they were yummy!  The garlic dill butter is also very good over green beans.

I have to go with a 5 star here, I made this recipe with new baby potatoes (a mixture of blues, reds and yellows) and otherwise followed the recipe.  Once made I held them in a warm oven until ready to serve and they were fabulous.  I will be making these over and over. We had them with grilled strip steaks and roasted asparagus and they were the perfect accompaniment.

These are the BEST potatoes I've ever eaten! I had to boil the potatoes because I didn't have a steamer basket, and I used dried dill because I had it on hand.

These were wonderful! I was looking for something to make with all of the fresh dill I had bought this weekend and was thrilled to find this recipe. Because fresh dill is not as potent as dried, I had to add a lot more to flavor the butter. I also added my usual garlic and onion powders and the dish was loved by all. Thank you!

I made this recipe per the directions with 2 quarts of small new potatoes from the farm market.  I had never steamed potatoes before, but they turned out well.  My whole family loved them. I used the left-overs scrambled with eggs and cheese for breakfast.  Yummy!

We felt that the potatoes needed steaming just a bit more. It was an alright side dish. If I make this again, I will add minced onion for a little more flavor.

I slice the raw potatoes, place in a 9" round microwave pan, pour the garlic dill butter over them, tightly cover with plastic wrap (do not vent) and microwave on high for 8 minutes. Fast, easy and yummy.

It's hard to go wrong with new potatoes. I prepared as directed using real butter and fresh dill, and real garlic. The dill added some nice color, and garlic is always good, but the flavor boost was not as big as I would have expected; in other words, not so very different from the same potatoes steamed, buttered, and salted. Hmmm. However, fresh herbs always look like you've gone an extra mile, so that much brings it to the 4 stars.

Good recipe, although instead of fresh garlic you can use garlic powder accoring to your taste. Alot of people mention that they have no steaming pot. If you have a wide flat bowl with a couple holes, all you have to do is put it on top of a fitting bowl. I usually buy dill that come in small bunches and I usually more than the recipe says. The potatoes cook really fast when you steam it so you have to watch your potatoes frequently.

These potatoes are indeed fantastic!  Loads of flavor, easy!

Update:  Best way to make these is the way Paula suggested in the mircowave.  I cubed them small added the ingredients to taste.  Cooked them till done and let them sit to absorb the flavors...delicious and so very easy!!

Loved this recipe!  Not only because everybody loved it, but because it was so easy.  I used fresh minced garlic cloves and a little extra butter.  I will definately be making this one again!

These are delicious!  I didn't have fresh dill so I used 1 tsp. dried dill, and they still turned out great.  I only had fresh garlic, not the minced kind in a jar so I minced two large cloves and one small clove of garlic.  I had to steam the potatoes for about 12 minutes rather than 10.  This recipe is definitely going into the rotation!

Absolutely delicious.  I served this with steak and it was excellent.  The fresh dill gave it a nice fresh flavor.  I wouldn't change anything about this recipe.  I'll be serving this all summer!

My husband starts a new job tomorrow after 6 years in the Army, and we had just come back from a 2-week vacation, so I was looking around to see what I could cook for his lunch.  I saw the red potatoes and found this recipe - which I'm so glad I did!  It's late (around midnight) so I only halved about 5 potatoes and threw them in the steamer.  It did take longer than 10 minutes, probably because they are bigger chunks - I found it to be more like 25 minutes.  I didn't have fresh dill, so I used a dill mix I have from pampered chef (it has garlic, onion, herbs, and spices, as well as the main ingredient - dill).  I still used the 3 tablespoons butter, but I did everything else in my hand and only minced one garlic clove.  I put it in a 350 degree oven afterwards for about 5 minutes, like another reviewer had mentioned, and I love it!!  I made Fettucini Alfredo to go with it, and now I'm just trying to think of what else I can put in his lunch tomorrow!  It's wonderful!

(Here I am, this moment, chomping away on a piece!!)

These potatoes are a really nice alternative to the same boring dishes. The garlic and dill go really well together. It's great for company. My husband loves them. And who doesn't need more garlic in their diet. We can't get enough!

Like Lara C., I love Boston Market's version of Garlic Dill Potatoes and this recipe certainly hits the spot. I used SunLite potatoes (found in Publix grocer) which are lower in carbs. I cubed the potatoes and and boiled them in half water and half broth. Once the potatoes were done, I drained them and let them cool a bit. I then melted the butter and tossed in the salt, dill, garlic and pepper and then tossed in the potatoes. Added a bit more s/p to taste but this recipe is wonderful. Next time I fry some bacon and use some of the dripping to create garlic dill butter. Tonight I am having them with baked bratwurst and caramelized onions. Look forward to making this again.

I actually liked it more as a cold potatoe salad.  I followed the recipe w/ a little extra garlic, refrigerated for a couple hrs, then added light sour cream. Very good!

I rated this by following the recipe exactly.  This could be a five star recipe if tweaked.  I love the fact that the potatoes are steamed.  I'm sure the potatoes retain a lot more vitamins that way, which is always a plus in my book.

Very simple, quick side dish which is delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, but since I don't have a steamer, I simply microwaved the potatoes whole, let them sit a bit to finish, then quartered them.  After adding the butter mixture, I kept them warm at 200 in the oven, which brought out the flavors of the sauce even more.  I would stress that using only fresh dill and fresh garlic are a must in a recipe like this, and I admit I did use about double the dill because we really love it.

These were very good. I added the garlic to the butter before i microwaved to mellow the flavor a little. I did a medium to small dice and needed to steam another few mins as they were still a little too firm for me. Great recipe for using fresh dill or any fresh herbs from the garden. I served them with baked salmon foil packets and zucchini "crab" cakes with homemade applesauce

This recipe is awesome just as written!  I had some fresh dill from my garden and fresh garlic and new red skin potatoes from the market.  I still feel like there is a "party in my mouth"!  Thank you for this recipe!! :)

I really liked this.  I was making a pork roast with a lot of garlic in it, so I left most of the garlic out of the potatoes.  Just a dash of garlic salt.  I think the quality of the butter you use will make the most difference in taste.

This is my families favorite potato dish. However, I boil the potatoes with 5 or 6 chicken boullion cubes also. It gives the potatoes a little more flavor. Then I put the potatoes in a cake pan, sprinkle with the dill and put grated cheese on top! They are way good!

Try melting your butter in a frying pan and adding the garlic and dill. Saute on medium/low heat, being careful not to brown the garlic. This will draw out the flavors in the spices, if you do not have time to put the potatoes in the oven after steaming. Great recipe!

Very good. I boiled some yukon golds for about 20 minutes and added the rest of the ingredients. They were great. Served them with green beans and a filet mignon.  Will make again. Super easy!

Awesome recipe! I used dried dill, 1 tsp, and yukon gold potatoes (cut up and steamed for 12 min) and it turned out wonderful. A definite keeper!

This was SOOO good. Myself, my husband and 12 year old daughter devoured them. I did add half of a sweet yellow onion to the potatoes before steaming and afterward I added some garlic powder and onion powder to the butter mixture... I also upped the amount of fresh dill quite a bit after tasting and it not being enough... added some chopped chives on top as a garnish. I added this to my recipe box and will be making it again. Thanks!

This is an excellent, easy to make side dish.  I used baby Yukon Golds, steamed them until tender and then add them to the butter sauce and let them sit on low for 10 minutes or so to absorb the flavors.  I also squeeze some fresh lemon juice over them to give them a little kick.  They make a flavorful side dish for any fish and pair very well with shrimp scampi.  Thanks for this recipe!  Edited to add:  I come back to this recipe over and over again -- I frequently make this recipe with any meal that would usually be served with a baked potato.  Excellent side dish!

These were pretty good - probably more like 3.5 stars. I cooked mine in the crock pot on low for several hours as I have never had much luck with steaming potatoes, but I will say that even then, the flavor was not very strong. I would imagine that just tossing the potatoes in the dill and butter right before serving would leave a little something missing in the taste department. I will make these again, but always in the crockpot, and I will play with the flavors a bit.

This side dish is easy and delicious. I have never steamed potatoes-always boiled them-and they were great. the butter and dill dressing added a simple touch, but made the dish. It's a keeper.

Good and simple.  Served with Salmon in Lemon Dill Sauce.  It went well with that because the potatoes do not have a ton of flavor on their own.  So easy!  I needed my steamer basket for broccoli too, so I steamed the potatoes first, and while they were steaming, melted the butter in a different saucepan, and added garlic and dill.  Then I added the potatoes to that saucepan, stirred them, and covered it.  I turned off the heat and left them there while I finished making the rest of my meal.

These potatoes have a nice flavor. I used dried dill and am eager to try again with fresh. Will make again.

[Edit] I've since made this recipe two more times with fresh dill, and a slightly higher ratio of butter sauce to potatoes. I've had nothing but rave reviews on both occasions. Excellent dish!

This was simple and very tasty.  When my mom brought home more dill than we knew what to do with, I tried this out first and it was a winner.  Still missing a bit of oomph, maybe just salt and pepper would complete the taste for me.

This was a huge hit with my family, but especially my 3 children! 
I substituted the fresh dill for dry, and I sauteed the garlic in olive oil til crisp, then added butter to pan, along with dill, salt and pepper.
My children would never eat fresh dill or raw garlic, so the couple little changes have made this a recipe that will be replacing the old hum-drum potatoes. Thank you so much for sharing!

Out of necessity, I used garlic powder as opposed to the minced garlic.  I still thought these were delicious.  Paired them with the roast sticky rotisserie chicken from here and had a woderful Sunday dinner.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Really like the simplicity of this recipe.  A little bland, so make sure to season liberally.  But a summer standard for use with my fresh dill.  Great combo.

I loved this recipe to cut time I used canned new potatoes and added dried herbs including chives I didn't have fresh garlic so I added garlic powder.  I probably used a little more of everything then it called for and added a little milk so make it saucy.  It was wonderful!

Simply easy and very yummy.......especially so with the grilled t-bone steak my husband prepared.  So glad that we decided to plant dill in our herb pots this year.  A simple stroll out to the patio and I was ready to go with the last ingredient.  Thank you for sharing your "tater" recipe.

I didn't steam the potatoes, I just boiled them. I also didn't use fresh dill nor minced garlic. I used dried dill and garlic in small peices. They were delicious!

These are so good!  I used real butter (3/4 stick) & about 4 tsps of minced garlic.  Didn't have fresh dill so I used dried (didn't notice the difference).  Loved it, will make again!

These were great. The only change I made was to use extra virgin olive oil instead of butter and added some onion. We also wrapped them in tin foil and cooked them on the grill. Yummy!

This was a great recipe!  My husband and I LOVE Boston Market's variety of these potatoes and eat them frequently.  These don't taste 100% like them, but they are mighty close!  I'll be making these a lot!  Thanks!

Good, but a little too salty for my taste preference. Next time I'll just go a little easier on the spices.

These are also fast and easy if you have a rice cooker. Mine has a basket for steaming vegetables or salmon etc. I just put the amount that I want in the basket and let them steam until they are tender. Then toss with adjusted amount of the butter mixture.

Totally Awesome,the only thing I did different was to use a steaming bag to cook the potatoes in and added the rest of the ingredients after the potatoes were done,no pan to clean just throw away the bag.

Made exactly as recipe says. Definitely needs more dill if you're using fresh and I cooked the potatoes about 15 minutes. If you don't like really strong garlic taste, I would reccommend sauteing the garlic before mixing everything together. Other than that, very tasty and will make again

These turned out pretty good. However, I tried a few things differently the second time. I cut the steaming time down so the potatoes are tender crisp. Then placed them in a baking dish and poured butter/garlic/dill mixture on top. Then bake in the oven 15-20 minutes basting with the butter mixture. They turned out wonderful and not as mushy as they did the first time. Thanks for sharing an easy, basic recipe.

My mother gave me this recipe years ago.  It is basically the same but you cook the potatoes in a little water in the microwave in the casserole you are going to serve them in.  Then you drain and put the butter, garlic, dill sauce over them.  No pans to wash!

This recipe is very straight forward and delicious.  I've never steamed potatoes before and was very impressed with quality and quickness of the result.  I also have to note that my boyfriend thought that they were the best potatoes he's ever had...and he's Irish for heaven's sake.  (FYI-They aren't kidding when they say the Irish LOVE potatoes.)

Let's just say... I didn't get any.  After a long day of cooking, I dozed off on the couch.  When I awoke, the potatoes were gone.  Not even a morsel.  My wife tells me they were good.

This was my first year planting an herb garden.  Now I think I'm spoiled!  I love the fresh dill.  These potatoes are great, so good I have cravings for them. A big hit! I'm taking them to a family reunion next week.

These were absolutely wonderful. I didn't change a single thing about the recipe except for the addition of more garlic. I could eat these with any entree!

These potatoes were the perfect pairing with my chicken piccata.  I was tired of the traditional parsley potatoes so this was a great alternative.  Thanks for the recipe.

These went down a treat at a potluck dinner tonight and smelt really good, but next time I may use more dill as it did not have a lot of flavour, probably becuase I used dried. So I will try these again with fresh dill.

Really good! Picky daughter went for seconds. Added Thai basil as well, just because I had some. I boiled rather than steamed also.

I really wanted the fresh dill to shine, so I doubled the amount and  added a spash of white wine with the melted butter. Then stirred in the potatoes. Great.
July 1 2013 Made again. Fresh garlic is strong in the sauce. I recommend putting it the butter as it is melted. I also still like to double the dill.

Simple and tasty!  I don't have a steamer basket, so I just boiled the potatoes and added 1 tsp. kosher salt to the water.  Since I had small potatoes, I only quartered them, but I think I should have cut them up even smaller.

These potatoes are so fast, so easy and so unbelievably tasty!  I only had dried dill weed, so I used 1 tsp. and they turned out fabulous.  I will try them in the spring when I can get some fresh dill at the farmer's market and I'm sure they will be even better!  A keeper for sure!

Delicious!!  I actually steamed the potatoes in the microwave using a plastic "designed for microwaving" steamer basket/bucket set. I did them for 13 minutes which was a little too long. I think 10 minutes would probably be good.  To save time and dishes, I poured the butter mixture in a Rubbermaid container that all the potatoes would fit it, then added the potatoes. Put the lid on and shook the whole thing around to coat the potatoes. Then, when we were done eating, I just put the lid on the leftovers and stuck it in the fridge.

These potatoes are very easy to make.  I boiled the potatoes but didn't change anything else and they turned out very well.  I served with sole amandine and green beans.  A very good & healthy dinner.

This is a easy, flavorful potato side dish that comes together quickly. My family liked the garlic dill flavor.  I did not have fresh dill this time but will use fresh next time.  I also used a mix of potatoes and it turned out great, would make this again.

This was delish. I also liked the idea of 1/2 cooking them tender crisp then finishing them in the oven so they don't get mushy. Great thinking.A add a bit more dill because I love it so much. Thanks for a fab recipe

I forgot to pick up dill at the store, so I used about a tablespoon of mashed basil paste (the kind that comes in a tube). Delicious!

These were so yummy! Not too heavy on the flavor but just enough to make you want more! I put twice the amount of butter & cooked it in a glass dish in the microwave for 5 minutes after I put the butter mixture on the potatoes. These were great!

I've made this for years, but I microwave it.  I cut new potatoes in chunks.  Add melted butter, garlic seasoning, salt & pepper to taste.  When almost done add dill seasoning.

AWESOME!!!! This recipe was a big hit at a recent recent family get-to-gether. The only thing I changed was to use purple fingerlings, yellow fingerlings and baby red potatoes.  The change in potaotes gave it a buttery flavor and texture and looked beautiful!!

Yummy!  I served these with the Salmon with Lemon Dill Sauce, and they were very complimentary.  The potatoes had enough flavor but not too much that we didn't enjoy the salmon flavors.  I used dried dill instead of fresh and there was plenty of flavor.

LOVED these little guys & was so happy to find this easy recipe!  I used a little less dill just b/c I wasn't sure how strong I would want the dill, but next time will use full amount as these were great & very easy to make!

Delicous.  My family loved this recipe.  I did cut down on the dill due to taste preferences, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Thank you for the recipe.  It will be a new staple in our menu planning.

This was a great side dish.  I steamed the potatoes for 25 minutes, and since I didn't have fresh dill I used the pampered chef mixture of onion, garlic, herbs & dill.  I added the minced garlic also, and thought it might be too much, but my guests thought it was perfect.  Company was a bit late so I had to place in the oven at 200 for about 15 minutes, and it was great.  Would definitely make this again.  It was so easy & barely any prep time.  I didn't have a long complicated recipe so I raided my pantry & didn't have to go shopping for anything!

I'm always looking for a different potato recipe that won't overwhelm the main dish, and this recipe was perfect!  I don't know if the steam method made much difference (bet it did, tho) but we were really impressed, my husband asks for these all the time.

Excellent recipe and so easy and delicious! I recently resurrected my rice cooker that I rarely used. I've been steaming vegetables in it, which I used for these potatoes. I cut my very small red skinned potatoes in half, and it took a little longer than 10 min to steam. I made a small amount and used garlic powder, but I know fresh garlic will be much better. Thanks, and I know I will make this again!

Very easy to make and tasted great. Went well with a pork loin roast. My wife likes roasted potatoes, and I like mashed. This was the perfect compromise.

Pretty simple, straight forward recipe.
My first time steaming potatoes (usually I boil for salads).
I added extra garlic a tablespoon of mayo and tablespoon of whole grain mustard, and black pepper. squeezed some lemon to brighten it up after dressing the potatoes.
Potato came out nice, creamy and moist.

Delicious and easy! Like kerryunr suggested, also placed in the oven at 350 until ready to serve to let flavors diffuse. Only other changes were to boil potatoes since I don’t have a steamer and I added one green onion. My daughter enjoyed with grated Parmesan.

This dish looks very pretty, and it does taste "good", but not great....  I wanted it to have more flavor.  For a quart of red-skinned new potatoes from the farm market, I added 3T of fresh dill, as that's what came in the package from the grocery store, and it added a little to the original recipe..... but there still wasn't a lot of flavor.  I wonder if it would make a difference to use garlic powder instead of minced garlic, as it would blend with the butter better?

Overall, a very good simple potato recipe that is easy to make. I thought they could use a little more salt, but my husband thought the amount of salt was fine. I didn't have fresh dill and substituted for dry (about 1.5 tsp). Otherwise, made the recipe as written. We put them in a baking dish and combined thoroughly with the butter, dill, garlic, salt. Placed in the oven uncovered at 350 until our fresh kielbasa finished browning. I think this helped the potatoes absorb some of the flavors. We will definitely make this recipe again.

Very good! I added green beans to mines and used garlic salt and garlic powder. Will be making again soon.

Yum! I had fingerling potatoes that were just so lovely and wanted a gentle treatment like this so the potatoes would be the star.  Will make again and again - I live in Greece, and amazing dill is always for sale.

We really enjoyed this classic potato dish.  I used fingerling potatoes instead of red potatoes, but, otherwise prepared exactly as the recipe stated.  I did forget to add garlic for my photo, but, added it before we ate it.  This is a great side dish with fish, chicken, beef, or pork.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a different way to make some simple potatoes. So glad I came across this recipe. Not only was it quick and simple to prepare.. It tasted Awesome. I used baby Yellow potatoes.. And had to use dried dill as that's all I had on hand. The garlic was great. Looking forward to making this with fresh dill. Thanks!

My husband and son really liked these tonight!! My hubby is actually not much of a regular potato guy (loves loaded sweet potatoes); but ate these up!
I used the same measurements but changed the potatoes. I used baby red potatoes from the garden, I boiled them for 20 minutes then added the regular ingredients along with  cheddar cheese and bacon. then rolled them in tin foil and put on the grill while I grilled the steaks. AMAZING!!!

I have intended to make this for at least 6 mo.  Made it Thanksgiving Day and it was so fresh tasting and good with baked Turkey Breast, asparagus with
Lemon flavored butter over it.  Used Amanda R. Recipe for cornbread Dressing.  WOW.

Made this recipe today.  I didn't have a steamer basket, but for those who don't know, you can use a metal colander instead and place it inside a large pot.  This recipe came out good, the 15 mins. was not long enough for the potatoes to be soft.  So I cooked them probably around overall 45 mins.  I used fresh dill and garlic to chop up and place in the butter, which tastes delicious!  Overall a good recipe that I will make again!

Served with Pan-Seared Tilapia and steamed kale last night.  Prepared extra butter from this potato recipe and drizzled it on the fish and veggies, too.  Will be fixing this about once a month now!  The first time I served these, it was with leg of lamb and I substituted rosemary for the dill with great results.

A Russian friend introduced me to this recipe many years ago. Love it, but we boil the potatoes and add  more garlic and more butter. The next day it's even better: cut the potatoes into smaller pieces and fry all the goodness in a skillet with a little oil...and extra butter. Even better browned with left over diced corned beef to make a delicious corned beef hash.

Good recipe.  I wanted something different to make in the way of potatoes and I'm glad I chose this recipe.  I added more melted butter and a little more salt.  A hit with my family.

Simple, easy, and elegant.  Great as a stand-alone, but versatile enough to accommodate changes.  I think next time I'll add the seasoning to the butter before melting, so the seasonings really infuse, then pour the sauce over the potatoes and pop under the broiler to intensify the flavor.

i followed the recipe as written and they turned out pretty good. I suggest if you are mincing FRESH garlic to saute or roast it first, as the raw garlic is a bit overpowering. i would also give the whole dish a quick roast in the oven at the end to make it taste better. otherwise, the potatoes are just buttery.

This was good, but not great.  I used dried herbs in place of fresh, b/c that's all I had.

I love all forms of potatoes. This is a very easy delicious recipe. The only thing I changed was use dried dill. The next time I am invited to a picnic or potluck I will be bringing these potatoes.

Excellent, easy side dish.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I used Yukon Gold Potatoes because that is what I had on hand.  I've found the gold potatoes have such a natural, buttery flavor you don't even need the butter.  So next time I'll make it without the butter for an even healthier side.  I ate the leftovers cold today and they were great too!

The only change I made to the recipe was I used new baby potatoes.  This recipe was great on them!  Nice subtle flavour, with baby potatoes I like to enjoy the taste of the potato as well.  Nice quick easy recipe (I have never even thought of steaming potatoes before - worked great!)  I will definetely be making this recipe again, and hubby is happy about that!!

In this dish, simple flavors are best!  I boiled my potatoes in salted water to speed the process, but added the garlic and dill as described in the recipe.  No fancy frills needed - the potatoes were great!

We didn't like this recipe, though the concept was good.  I think you'd really have to love dill to appreciate it.

My potatoes were done too early so I threw them into a foil pan in the oven for about 1/2 an hour.  I think it made them even yummier.

I would say as the recipe was written, the potatoes were fine but not much more.  I will try again following others' advice to cook the potatoes with the flavors instead of just tossing on.  As steamed and then buttered, these didn't taste like much other than...steamed and buttered potatoes.  The dill didn't stand out at all, and I LOVE dill and was really looking forward to it.  Will try again but make it much differently (and probably ramp up the dill ratio).

Very tasty.  I used regular potatoes, steamed as directed, tossed with butter mixture and then put in the oven to keep warm.  Could use a pinch more salt, but otherwise, very good.

So simple!  I boiled the potatoes in salted water, as I read another reviewer had. I also added some fresh flat leaf parsley as I had it on hand.  A new family favorite.

These are so delicious.  I boil them in water with a little salt because I don't have the steamer basket to steam them.

Watch out they're easy to over garlic for all you other garlic fiends out there!

This recipe was grrreat! I put in new white rose, new red and even organic purple potatoes to added extra color for the Christmas table! I couldn't find my steamer so I just boiled the potatoes.  
It was a big hit. I will definitely keep this recipe at the ready. P.S. this is a side dish not a potatoes salad for anyone that is confused.

I followed the recipe exactly. And I didn't care for it. I didn't know from the direction if this was a cold salad or a hot salad. Since it had butter, I served it warm. I had a lot left over so I'm going to pan fry the left overs for lunch. I did love the steamed potato idea -the potatoes were just right after steaming for old fashion potato salad with eggs.I used the bamboo two level steamer which keep them cooking even.

I used regular Idaho potatos, peeled and diced, and threw these in my slow cooker with a little bit of olive oil. Halfway through I decided to add more dill. They came out great!! DH doesn't care much for potatos but he loved these.

These were GREAT!!  Only change I made was using dried dill dip mix (from wildtree herbs) and I omited the salt.  My boyfriend and brother had 3 helpings!  Will be making these again :)
