This is delish stuff. The bitterness of the kale rally goes well with the buffalo sauce.. I used the Red Hot stuff. My only change was leaving out the zucchini because I used them all up in soup accidentally.. so I added a few more carrots and some celery. For non Paleo folks, sweet potato or yam in this would be wonderful
