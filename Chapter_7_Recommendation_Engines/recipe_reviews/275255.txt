If your ribs aren’t tender, I’m afraid the problem may be with your air fryer, or the ribs you used. I didn’t have the problem the other reviewer had.

They were pretty as a picture and taste was spot on. But tender, falling off the bone they were not. Chewy. Followed recipe exactly and kept close watch. I just don't think fast cooking can ever create a tender rib no matter the appliance used. Will do these again but will know what to expect so won't be disappointed.

Probably my fault.  I checked and flipped it.  It tasted good so put sauce and a few more minutes.  It was so dry and overcooked. I also used boneless - any suggestions?

Followed the recipe as written using my air fryer.  Flavor and appearance were as described.  There's no way however the meat is tender cooking at the time and temperature indicated.  I like the rib meat to be fall off the bone tender.  If you like a "chew" to your meat this may work for you.
