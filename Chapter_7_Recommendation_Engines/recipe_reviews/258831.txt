Not sure why the layers were so important to this recipe, as I found it difficult to toss when ready to serve. It was good but I’d cut the bacon and onion in half next time. Next time I’ll toss and refrigerate ahead of time but skip the instruction to put pressure on it. Nicely chilled when served!
