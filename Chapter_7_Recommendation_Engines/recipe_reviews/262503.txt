Delicious, the only thing i did was not use the cheese.I cut the zucchini into circles. tossed them with the oil and sprinkled the rest over. Will make again.
Thank you for the recipe.

I wish I had not sliced it quite as thin as it appeared in the photo, but it was good.

I found this to be too bland for our tastes (and we generally eat bland things).

This is a great side dish when your pressed for time. It's easy. It goes with a variety of main dishes because it has a mild flavor. I like the crunchiness of the bread crumbs and cheese.

This was a big hit! I combined everything together along
with garlic powder. We needed a new zucchini dish and this was perfect.
Thank You!

I really liked how the bread crumbs made the zucchini get nice and crispy in the oven. I love zucchini in general, and it was nice to change it up. The only thing I didnâ€™t like about this recipe
