Sounds really good.  I'll have to make it.  But my comment is about the commentary by Chef John.  I'm sorry but his speaking is just horrible.  He says a couple words at a time, then pauses, says a couple more, pauses, ….    Gave me a headache listening to him.  Recipe sounds good but he's hard to listen to! Anyone else notice?

This is an amazing recipe and so easy to make!  Made it for two parties in the last few weeks and first appetizer to completely disappear with everyone loving it.  Pretty much followed recipe couldn’t find poblano and just use different one jalapeño which made it spicy enough for a mixed crowd.  I used more chorizo than called for but think you can use pretty much what proportions you want and it will turn out.  It is my new go to for ease and taste.   I made it ahead the second time and then just popped in a 350oven with foil on top till it bubbled.

This was a really easy and delicious dip to make. We subbed frozen pepper strips we keep on hand for the fresh bell pepper. Somehow, we forgot the poblano peppers while shopping so had to make due with just the 2 jalapenos for heat. It had a slight kick but was mild enough for our spice-sensitive friend to enjoy. As someone who likes heat, though, I will definitely be including the poblanos next time, along with maybe another jalapeno! Almost too good, though -- we finished the whole thing in one evening.

I made this and it was great.  Just two thoughts
1.   It's not that there is too much Chorizo, its just that there is not enough cheese!  Because once you taste this  you will want MORE!

2.   As I was viewing the video and and as I started preparing the mixture, just before adding the cheese the thought came to me that  adding some Tomato product here and skipping the cheese would result in a fantastic  "Sloppy Jose".  Sorry Chef John, I just had to get that in before you thought  of it!

Made just like the instructions and it was awesome!! I used my homemade chorizo and the taste of everything was great. Thought there would be a little more heat though, considered adding some Sriracha but didn’t want to ruin the taste. Going to try it on scrambled eggs in the morning. Great recipe!!

I'm guessing John measured his cheese by "volume" instead of by "weight".  I added the 12 oz of Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese (by weight) and what looked like a beautiful pan of cooked chorizo and peppers became a big ball of melted cheese with bits of chorizo and peppers.  And my final product looked way cheesier than the one on the web.  

I will try this again, but will cut the Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese in half (measuring by weight).

Great as a dip. Could easily add avocado as a garnish. An absolute do over.

Oh my is this FANTASTIC!!!! Chef John hit a Home Run with this one!!! The only change I made was adding only one poblano pepper because it was a huge pepper! The perfect amount of heat and the cheesiness was on point. This will definitely be replacing the “cheesy salsa dip” for Football Season!
