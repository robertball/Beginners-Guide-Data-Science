The best.Many pineapple upside down cake recipes are too dry so I add all of the pineapple juice. I also use pineapple rings and the marichino cherries. Thank you for this recipe.

The cake was really good with a nice texture but left me a little disapointed.  I have used the Justin Wilson Pineapple Upside-Down Cake and it is just hard to beat that particular recipie.  I added some pecan and almond slivers along with a touch more brown sugar and pineapple juice the next time I made the cake and these items added a little more variety.

Never made a scratch cake in my life.....it came out excellent....it was delicious....no one believed I actually made it...they thought it was a bakery cake...used the recipe exactly...baked 45 minutes...only left stand for 5 minutes and it dripped down the sides and looked great...not dry a bit...used peacans since we just got back from a trip to the Savannah crushed pinapple with the magic bullit and put one canned ring in the middle....eveyone loved it...

I tried this once when I was having guests over, and they absolutely loved it.  And this is coming from one who's usual baking attempts are mostly disasters.  This will be one of my favorites.

I made this with a yellow cake mix, but made the topping as directed.  I did use a pineapple ring in the middle, and omitted the cherries.  It was wonderful, and got rave reviews.  Super easy and fast!

Made this tonight and it was very good!  I followed the recipe exactly aside from not having walnuts or cherries, but the end result was really good!  Will definitely make this one again.

I am totally confused as to what happened here...The original recipe was for 6, I changed it to 12, which means instead of a round pan it has to go in a lasagna type pan. Well everything went okay until it was time to pour the batter over the Pineapples, THERE WASN'T ENOUGH BATTER!!!!!!! I had to rush and doctor it up with a second batter batch. How can this be??  The flavor was good but unfortunately because of the experience I won't make it again.

Loved the recipe!

I doubled the recipe so that it would fit a 9 X 13 inch pan and used pineapple rings instead of crushed pineapple. I omitted the cherries and walnuts because I didn't have any but still turned out great.

Although delicious served as is, I ate mine with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I like the idea of this cake because it used crushed pineapple instead of the rings. Made for better distribution and pineapple in every bite. I only used 2 tablespoons of shortening and then added 1/4 cup applesauce. No cherries. I added pecans but think I would like it better without any nuts. Really moist and good flavor, even with reducing the fat!

I haven't had pineapple upsdie-down cake in years, but today I had such a hankering for it. I read over all the recipes for this cake on this website and chose this one because it sounded easiest to make and I had all the ingredients.  I eliminated the walnuts but otherwise made this exactly as written. The cake part of this was delicious - a hint of pineapple flavor and a light and fluffy texture. The topping was a little too sweet for my taste. If I make this again, I will use only 1/2 the brown sugar.

My grandaughter made this cake for our Christmas dinner and although it was very pretty, it was so dry we could not eat it.  I ended up throwing it away.  I thought she had done something wrong, but apparently others had the same problem. (??)
Sorry, Nannie

I was a little disappointed because the cake got stuck in the pan and fell apart in some areas.  I don't know where I went wrong because I even sprayed the pan with Pam.

Anyhow, everyone loved it and I'll give it a second try.  Thank you.

This is a good cake.  It was just a tiny bit dry, maybe I cooked it too long.  I would make it again but add a little more brown sugar and butter and cook it about 5 minutes less time. I loved the topping.

This cake was a success!! A little tip though, use all of the extra pineapple juice in the can so it doesn't get dry. I'm happy to say my family finished the cake in 15 minutes.

This is an excellent cake.  I didn't use walnuts, and I've made it with and without the cherries.  I've made it with pineapple tidbits, and with crushed, and we liked the crushed version better.  Only change was that I use all of the juice from the can, about 2/3 cup.  So good, and not difficult at all.  Definitely not using a mix in the future.

Oh it is fantastic! I followed the recipe almost exact - i didn't have any cherries and my pineapples were just a 20oz chunked pineapples can. I used almost all of the pineapple juice in the can per other reviewers recommendations. I will make so many times!!!

Great recipe. Would be a 5 if it were a little more moist. Next time I will add more pineapple juice to the mix. The sugar and butter mix makes this cake..so delish!!

I had some leftover canned pineapple tidbits that I was looking to use up. I used the search by ingredient feature with the ingredients I had on hand, and this was the first thing that popped up. Well, I had almost all the ingredients. I never have shortening on hand, so I used oil. The cake itself was super moist(I followed other reviews, and added extra juice), but a little on the sweet side. It's probably my fault because of the extra juice, I'll have to remember to cut back on the sugar to compensate next time. I also added some pumpkin pie spice to the batter, I use it in all my baked goods and it goes really well with the pineapple. The only problem I had with this recipe is it won't come out of the pan! I ran a knife along the sides of the pan, but it just won't budge. I'm not serving it to company, so it's not that big of a deal. It still tastes great! The topping is just not gooey like I usually make. I think an extra TBS or so of butter will help with the sticking. Will definitely make again though! Thank you so much for the pineapple upside-down cake....errrrr....pineapple downside-up cake recipe!

I loved this recipe! Super easy to throw together, and wonderful texture and flavor! I used the rings instead of crushed pineapple, because I prefer the look, but I fill in the "gaps" with pieces of pineapple. This will be my go to recipe for Pineapple Upside Down Cake from now on! Thank You for a great recipe!

This was a great tasting cake.  Husband and guests finished the whole cake!  The only thing that I will do differently next time is to double the cake ingredients The topping was delicious, but there just wasn't enough cake.

Love this recipe. I think the mistake the baker who gave it two stars might have made was not understanding that the batter has to be spread around the pan. Made one for a bake sale and it was gone in 15 minutes. Making one for a friend and my household today. Thank you Emily, if you are the originator!

Quick and Easy. Husband thought it was fantastic, I thought it was pretty good. I added a 1/2 tsp almond extract, which I really like in pineapple cake.

I doubled the recipe and made in a 9X13 inch pan...but when I tried to take it out, some of the topping (bottom with cherries and pineapple) fell apart.  Tastes great, but I think the top is what makes it so interesting, dissapointed.  Otherwise, great recipe.

This cake is very flavorful. I didn't have any cake flour so I had to use regular flour. It was a bit denser than I would have liked. Overall, this is a recipe I will make again. The next time, I will use butter/oil in the batter to make it a little moister.

Mine turned out sort of dry and sort of weird looking.  My sugar burned a little, too.  I used fresh pineapple instead of canned, which might have been my mistake.  However, the cat got into the cake and thought it was delicious.  Since cake isn't good for cats, though, I probably won't make it again.

The pineapple topping part of the recipe is great but the cake part is not that great.  It's not much cake batter either and I tried this recipe without making any changes  and finally decided to find a better cake recipe to go with this recipes pineapple topping.

Loved this cake but the first time I made it, the cake did not taste as good as the top of the cake did and was  dry. So I made it again and added  more butter,tbsp more, and sprinkled the brown sugar under the pineapples as the recipe said and also put 2 tbsp more over the pineapples. And added 1/4 more sugar to mix. Added the rest of the pineapple juice like others had suggested, and even mixed in the extra pineapple as well.I love my cakes sweet and moist!

By far the best Pineapple Upside Down Cake I've ever made (and ate).  I used pineapple rings but will use chunks next time to make it easier to cut and serve.  I also put coconut with the brown sugar because we are coconut lovers.  Fantastic!  Three of us ate it in less than 12 hours.  I had never used cake flour before and wasn't really crazy about it because it didn't sift very easy and I had a mess.  Has anyone else used regular four?

The cake tasted delicious.  However it was a little runny and I'm not sure what I did wrong.  I did spray my pan with pam cooking spray and I used pecans instead of walnuts.

I adore scratch recipes and this one "takes the cake"!  Had to delete the walnuts as I'm allergic and used the pineapple rings.  Used all the juice too as several reviewers suggested.  Hubby ate a whole fourth of the cake last night and declared it was the best he'd ever eaten (and he's eaten a lot of cake in his 60 years!!!).  Thanks!!!

Pretty straight forward recipe. I followed the directions as written here and had a decent end result. I say decent because I frankly thought the cake was too dry and lacked flavor but my boyfriend LOVED it. All in all, I think it's worth making and tweaking until you get it just right.

I doubled the recipe and added more butter and brown sugar. It was good but I think I will replace the pineapple juice for sour cream next time and the cake flour for all purpose flour. It was too tart and too crumbly. I will also poke holes in it as it cools so the juices can get inside. I will re-use this recipe as a base though. Thanks!

Super delicious recipe! I used pineapple chunks instead of crushed pineapples. This will be my go-to recipe anytime I want to make pineapple upside-down cake! Everybody loved the cake....my parents, my aunt and uncle, my sister, and my hubby.

First time, also, I'm not much of a baker. I Did something wrong. I think it was the pan I used. I also think I let it cool to long before flipping the pan.  The taste was very good but it looked awful.

Sooooo good! My mom used to make Pineapple upside down cake all the time when I was a kid and this was just like it! The top was a tiny bit too sweet for me but I went with 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar sugartwin and that's sweeter cup for cup than regular sugar so next time I'd probably reduce the topping to 1/2 cup, 50% sugar, 50%sugar twin.  Either way the cake was delicious, my boyfriend, who had nver had pineapple upside down cake adored it and ate the whole thing in one night (I got one piece at least, but he had half of it gone before we even ate dinner :P) I followed the recipe exactly (except for the top, sugartwin and no walnuts) and didn't find it dry at all. Great recipe, great cake, I'll be sure to make this again :)

I followed Chef John's recipe's method for combining the butter and brown sugar, but everything else was according to this one. I found it a little too sweet, but everyone else loved it!! It came out really pretty too, despite my worries over my very first upside down cake. However, I tend to agree with one of the reviewers who said they'd like more cake - will double the cake part next time, and maybe reduce sugar.... and there definitely will be a whole bunch of next times!

Great recipe! My family really enjoys it. I made it for the first time on the 4th of July.  Now I am making a double layered one for church. I did the bottom layer with crushed pineapple and no cherries.

The flavor was great. But the cake was a bit dry, like others were saying , and even though I added a bit more butter, the topping stuck to the pan when I tried to remove it.  I baked it under 45 minutes, but I think it needs less baking time. 

I will probably try this again, but will see if there's anything that I can do to mitigate the topping sticking.  It was probably the ugliest cake I've made before.

Great!   First, I don't use mixes so those other Upside Down Cake recipes are dead to me.   Next this recipe is perfect and simple.   I substitute unsalted butter for shortening, it reminds me of the cake my mom used to make.    It's a keeper!

I enjoyed this very much as did the family. The shortening in the mix made for a very nice crumb for the cake and the topping was super super yum.

I had a problem getting the cake out of the pan, what a mess! So disappointed but my boyfriend ate the disaster out of a bowl anyway.

This recipe is great the only change I would do next time I make this is to lower the salt to 1/4 tea instead.

I used the mini bundt pan and it came out beautifully. This is the only recipe I use for pineapple upside down cake.

My family really enjoyed this.  I used unsweetened pineapple which was a mistake because it was a little sour. The person who reviewed the recipe on May 20th must have baked the cake too long.  Mine was very moist!  Will make again.
