This was quite REFRESHING!  I did make a few minor substitutions which included using agave in place of honey, plain yogurt instead of vanilla flavored (too much sugar) and  crushed ice to make it really cold.  I did use a frozen banana but did not think it needed to thaw before blending.  I adding 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed.  I tried many smoothies from this site and will put this one in my smoothie rotations!

If you're struggling with eating your fruits everyday, I would strongly suggest checking this smoothie out. It has two super foods in it and contains flax seed meal. Blueberries have some of the greatest antioxidant levels you can find in a fruit and flaxseed is a powerhouse for omega-3s and good souce of fiber. Eating 3 bananas a day has been shown to alleviate symptoms of depression/anxiety because of it's ability to increase your dopamine levels. How awesome it that? I add a little more blueberries and flax seed meal to mine because I like a thicker smoothie. I also use the Silk vanilla soy milk but no honey. Most the time I don't freeze the bananas and that doesn't bother me too much. I would recommend trying to use a good plain yogurt, none of that sugary stuff. If you're a big milk drinker try to find stuff low in calories and saturated fat (like Fage) and vice~versa if you're not a big milk drinker. Another recommendation is to add strawberries or a kiwi into the mix. You don't even really taste the kiwi, but that's another great source of omega-3s and antioxidants. I drink this every morning or as a lunch dessert for myself. Yummy!

This is probably one of the best smoothies I have ever tasted.  Even my husband drank it and he is not a real healthy eater.  I substituted skim milk for the soy milk and added a little extra honey.  Delicious!!

Tasty Smoothie! I use 2 bananas and do not freeze them as I feel the flavor comes out better this way. I also do not use honey due to allergic reaction but this tastes great anyways!! This recipe has been a heaven send on our hot summer nights as a "sweet treat" rather than reaching for the ice cream.  Also instead of blueberries try frozen strawberries.  Just as good!

I really felt this was more a 3.5.  I liked it fairly well but it wasn't great.  I made it again, trying to improve upon my first one.  I didn't use the flax meal either time, because -- well, I don't have it and I don't care.  (I do smoothies for the fruit.)  I also don't have soy milk around.  The first time I used (reconstituted) nonfat dry milk, and Dannon yogurt, but it tasted too much like the yogurt and too little like the vanilla.  (And I don't like plain yogurt.)  So the second time I went with a different brand lowfat vanilla yogurt, and 1% milk.  The banana and blueberries both frozen to make it good and cold.  And because it calls for vanilla soy milk, I also added 1/4 tsp vanilla and a pinch extra honey.  And still thought it was a 3.5.  I tried.  In the end I upped it to the 4 because it's easy - I like my smoothies SMOOTH so I like things that blend up really well.  Oh, and I agree the banana doesn't need thawed.  EDIT:  I've made this 2 more times, separated in time, using full-fat vanilla yogurt, and both times would have called this closer to a 5.  So I'm drawing the conclusion I just don't like the low fat stuff in this.  I've also started using the full-fat version because I see nothing wrong with dairy fat and low/non-fat just has too much other garbage in it and I think is less healthy.

Yummy!! My dad and I had this for breakfast this morning and it was very filling. The changes I made were to use unsweetened soy milk, plain yogurt, and mixed berries. Oh, and I also threw in some spinach. The only thing I would do different next time is to add a little bit extra honey because I couldn't tell it was there. This one will definitely become part of our breakfast routine:) Thanks for sharing!!

I really love this recipe it was very tasty and easy to make.  It was just sweet enough and I didnt need to add any extra sugar or honey.  I used soy milk and I doubled the recipe to make enough for the kids (5 & 7 ) and myself.  It is a great way to make sure they get enough fruit and fiber each day.  I added a teaspoon more of flax and they didnt notice a bit and ask for it every morning :)

Pretty good with soy but I tried coconut soy milk & yum!  Also don't use blueberries with tough skins or this is too pulpy and you get tough skins to chew on.  One thing needs saying about flax seed.  Per my medical nutritionist:  all whole flax seed will not digest in a human gastrointestinal system & what goes in whole pretty much comes out the same whole...meaning you have to use ground flax to receive any nutritional benefit.  Foods with whole flaxseed look healthy & are touted as such but as stated, don't do anything for you nutritionally.

This is heavenly.  I especially love the addition of flax seed and honey.  I will even freeze these and enjoy as a frozen treat.

I made this bc I'm sick and felt like I needed some nutrition.  The only changes I made were to use whole flax seed and blueberry yogurt, since I had those on hand.  This is good and the banana is not overpowering.  I think I prefer a juice-based smoothie instead of dairy-based.

Great! I used wheat germ instead of the flax and put in 2 T. of honey and a tsp. of vanilla since I used unsweetened soy milk and plain yogurt.

One of the best smoothies I have tried.  Very sweet, next time I will reduce the honey a bit.  I did not have flax seed meal, so I used wheat germ instead.  Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe and easy. I substituted the honey with agave nectar because I was out of honey and used almond milk because of my allergy to dairy milk...the recipe is still a winner

YUM!! I did not have soy milk so used 1% milk. Also had no honey so did not add it. It was still good without the honey. I did add a few fresh spinach leaves for an extra healty boost and you could not even taste them!! I also used fresh blueberries and kept my banana frozen. My kids thought it tasted like a milkshake :)

Made this with some kind of mushy blueberries .. and it turned out great. Didn't freeze the banana.  Used regular plain yogurt but added some vanilla.  Also didn't have any flax seed.  Even 8 year old liked it.   I'm going to freeze what is left and eat it as a substitute for ice cream.

I didn't have all of the ingredients for this recipe so I used it as a guide. I added one banana(not frozen), 1 cup blueberries, 1 cup fat free vanilla yogurt, 1/2c 1% milk, 1 tsp splenda and a handful of ice. It was so delicious that my kids asked for seconds.

Loved this recipe!! Made a few changes because I try to avoid flavored fat free yogurt, because it usually has artificial sweeteners and flavors. INSTEAD I used organic non-fat greek yogurt, just a half cup instead of a cup because then the consistency gets too thick. And for that vanilla flavor added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. DELICIOUS!

Very refreshing! I modified it in the following way: did not thaw banana, substituted agave nectar for honey, added 6 baby carrots, 3 cauliflower florets, 2 cherry tomatoes, 1 scoop vanilla protein powder (optional), and 2/3 C water. Ends up around 550 calories and is delicious! Can't taste the veggies at all :-)

Yummy!  I used a fresh banana and plain Greek yogurt with the Silk light Vanilla.  Thick and very filling!  Don't bother with the sweetened yogurt, you won't miss it, and greek yogurt has more protein.

Yummy!  This tasted so wonderful.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and it is so delicious.  I am going to make another one tomorrow a.m. but am going to use frozen peaches in lieu of some of the blueberries (because I have a peach to use up), otherwise I would make the blueberry.  Wonderful!

I made this smoothie today, and it was absolutely delicious. I added baby spinach just to incorporate vegetables, and you cannot even taste it. This is a keeper... Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't have honey and without it all I could taste was the yogurt.  I would probably reduce the amount of yogurt.

Yummy! A few changes... We used 2% milk and plain fat-free yogurt. I increased the amount of honey to one tablespoon, measured one tablespoon of flax seeds then ground them and a full cup of blueberries. Banana doesn't need to be thawed. This has a nice consistency with a blast of blueberry flavour. My hubby-to-be didn't like the addition of flax, but I did; it's something you could leave out or replace with something else based on your personal preference. This makes a great base for other fruits or fruit blends. We do like our smoothies thick though.

This smoothie tasted great. To make it healthier, I used nonfat plain yogurt and it was still plenty sweet.

Yum! I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but it was delish! Used 2 fresh overripe bananas, more frozen blue berries and a little more of everything, since I was making it for 3 people. I also had no flax so I used a couple tbsp of almond butter. So good! Thanks for sharing!

As a breast cancer survivor I need my blueberries!  I used 2% milk instead of soy. I will try almond milk next time. I didn't use a frozen banana, just a fresh one sliced.  I used a cup of crushed ice, used flax seed,organic honey,organic frozen blueberries, Greek vanilla yogurt. Yummy my new go to recipe.  I will try spinach in it next time to make it more healthy!

Even my little girl who typically doesn't like smoothies loves this! So creamy, so tasty. I didn't have flax, so I added some slivered almonds, didn't have vanilla yogurt, so used plain yogurt and added 1 tsp. vanilla. I also added a pinch of nutmeg. Yum!

OMG!!!!  Delicious!  I have tried a lot of smoothie recipes lately because I am trying to be healthier and have it for breakfast everyday and this is by far the tastiest!  It almost tastes like a dessert and not something healthy.  I used the frozen wild boreal blueberries from Trader Joe's.  Not sure if the blueberries you choose make a difference but I highly recommend using these.  :)

I thought this had a good flavor. I didn't realize until I started making it how much yogurt it had though. I am not normally a fan of smoothies with a lot of yogurt. I did make some changes, based on what I had in the house. I had unsweetened almond milk instead of soy vanilla, so I added a couple of drops of vanilla extract. I didn't have flax seed, and used an equal amount of quick oats. My banana wasn't frozen, so I added 2 ice cubes to make it cold. I realized I only had half the vanilla yogurt so I subbed the other half with plain non fat yogurt. I think that was a good subtitute, because I find vanilla yogurt to be too sweet anyway. ty

Excellent smoothie.  I used a ripe fresh banana, and had to add an extra 1/3 cup frozen blueberries to tone down the banana flavor a bit. I prefer milk-based smoothies (instead of juice), and this is one of my new favorites!

Excellent smoothie with all sorts of good stuff in it.  I used regular milk (don't keep soy milk in the house) and vanilla greek nonfat yogurt.  I didn't freeze the banana and I don't think that detracted from the recipe. This smoothie has the perfect amount of sweetness for my tastes and is just so easy to put together.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good. It has a nice, subtle taste and nothing was too overpowering. Everything blended together perfectly and it's awesome to go. I didn't t add any honey because none was needed. This drink will become part of my breakfast in the mornings.

Yummm! It is a mild smoothie, but it isn't all that filling. We found, at first, that the banana was way overpowering for the blueberry taste that we wanted. We upped the blueberries to 1 1/2 cups and it still wasn't enough. Next time we will try 2 cups! This also makes the smoothie a lot thicker. We also found omitting the honey did not change the flavour, therefore we omited it to reduce the calories from this particular ingredient. In addition, I upped the flax to 2 tsp in order to add more of a traditional benefit - its only 1 tsp per person still. Very nice. Thanks for the recipe.

I'm not a big smoothie maker but I really liked the health benefits of this one.  It was very tasty.  I made it just like the recipe said and I didn't think it was too sweet at all.  My five year old liked it, and my seven year old didn't.  But I will make it again for myself as it's very healthy and very, very filling!

I felt so guilty drinking this until I remember that I didn't have to!  It is a wonderful refreshing drink and it was very filling as well.  The only thing I did different was use flax seed oil instead of the meal because that is what I had on hand.  Great way to get the flax in to my son.  Can't wait to try it with other berries.

Meh.  This was good; it's hard to go wrong with fruit blended with yogurt.  But it was kind of forgettable.  I think vanilla yogurt is too subtle.  I prefer throwing frozen fruit in with berry or peach yogurt and some milk, the smoothie has more flavor that way.

Very refreshing! I used plain yogurt and plain soy milk and added about 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, and I used agave nectar instead of the honey.  Mine came out super thick, so I added a bit more soy milk.  I think I would have liked to add another type of berry - strawberry, raspberry, etc  - for more flavor, but this was still quite good!

this is super awesome! i basically followed the recipe but used light original silk and FF yogurt, then added a tsp of vanilla extract for flavor. this gives you everything but added sugar and saves some calories. no need to thaw banana.

Very good. I added more blueberries, about a half cup, and used whole milk. We all liked it.

Just made this for breakfast.  It's good.  I like the flax, which I often add to smoothies anyway.  I don't use soy milk, so I just used regular 1%.  Also since my fruit was not frozen I threw in about 3 ice cubes.  Lastly I used a full Tbsp of honey because I like it.  Very nice way to start the day!

I made this as attempt to get something healthy in my 4 year daughter. She isnt a big eater. She drank every drop and then wanted more. So this has now become staple in our home. My husband and I also drink this. We have also tried other fruits and it always turns out good. Thanks!

I too prefer plain to vanilla yogurt( I always have it in my fridge) but if you're using it, switch the quantities of yogurt and milk. Go with 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup yogurt, add a ts of honey. I used pretty much a cup of blueberries, and a regular banana with 1/2 cup ice. I like my smoothies with lots of ice. I didn't have flax so omitted that. Next time though, so the blueberry flavor shines, I'll try it with no banana, more blueberried, and maybe like a TB of yogurt just to thicken it up. Plain yogurt always tends to dominate in smoothies.

I had to alter the recipe a lot. I didn't have vanilla soy milk, so I used organic 1% milk. Opposed to the vanilla fat-free yogurt, I used 99% fat-free french vanilla yogurt. This may be a better choice on everyones part. Next, I don't exactly know what a flax seed meal is, however I had cinnamon raison flax seeds so I used that instead. Now, to the part of honey, I used as much as directed, yet the drink tastes too much like honey. I dont like honey that much, and this smoothie is a blueberry smoothie, not a honey smoothie. So I'd definetly cut down on that. I didn't freeze the blueberries, nor did I have frozen blueberries, so I just put the regular blueberries as-is. The drink may have not tasted as it should've, on my part because of the ingredients, but I dont care much if the drink is healthy or not so I did add more fat to it. But fatty drinks do taste GOOD (better than nonfat), and I can't say that about this drink. I added whipped cream on top with left over blueberries, so I'd definetly recommend that if you're still going for health reasons.

This was yummy. The honey really rounds out all of the flavors nicely, and I like that there's a bunch of flax in here. Flax and blueberries and soy...could it be any healthier?

Healthy, delicious and refreshing! I used plain yogurt, halving  the amount. I had to add more soy milk to get the blender going. I also used agave nectar in place of the honey and added 1/2 scoop of vanilla whey protein powder. As a reviewer suggested, coconut soy milk sounds like a good option. Thank you - will make again!

I've never made any kind of 'healthy' smoothie before so this was a first for me. I substituted the banana for some fresh strawberries and soy milk for skim. I'm not even a fan of blueberries and I have to say this smoothie was delicious. I would absolutely recommend this recipe. It's simple, easy, and tastes great.

Good, but extremely thick.  Saved half for the next day and thinned it with some fruit juice.  Didn't have any flax seed.   Put everything in the blender and blended--didn't thaw the banana or think to read the instructions.  Don't think it made a difference.

Very nice smoothie, I made a couple of changes (lactose)
Used almond milk and lactose free vanilla yogurt. I also added  a scoop of lactose free vanilla protein powder, keeps me full longer.
Thank you for the recipe.

This was AMAZING I did a few minor changes... I didn’t have vanilla soy milk so I added 3 % regular milk and vanilla I added a couple of ice coupes cause I loveee cold smoothies. I didn’t use frozen banana just a regular one and I used a little more blueberry than called for and I didn’t have honey so I added a little bit of sugar. SO GOOD! This is a keeper! I also added almonds cause I dont have flax

I used nonfat plain Greek yogurt and (Silk) almond milk. Greek yogurt has more protein and less lactose.  Didnt use the honey but did add a Stevia packet and vanilla.  A great alternative for breakfast with a lot of nutrition. My husband likes it too

I had never had or made a smoothie before.  I'm trying to make some healthful changes in my life, and this smoothie is an easy -- and delicious -- addition.

It is full of ingredients that are good for you, and it is delicious.  I used plain nonfat yogurt instead of vanilla yogurt

Looking forward to the summer months when the markets are selling fresh, seasonal fruit again.  I plan to throw some strawberries in.

The first time I made this exactly as written and it was very tasty.  The only change I made the second time was to add about 3/4 cup of crushed ice to make it nice and cold.  I will definitely make this again using the crushed ice but leaving everything else as is.

Very good. I made only minor changes -- I used skim milk, vanilla Greek yogurt, vanilla-flavored whey protein instead of the flax seed, and omitted the honey because I knew the blueberries and banana would make it sweet enough. Extremely tasty!

Use strawberry yogurt & 1% milk because it was what I had on hand. Increased flax meal to 1 tablespoonful & omitted honey because of the sugar in the yogurt. I may decrease the amount of yogurt and add some crushed ice next time just to suite my personal taste.

This is YUMMY! I used light strawberry yogurt instead of vanilla and 1% milk instead of soy, and fresh blueberries instead of frozen since that's what I had. I followed quantities and directions otherwise and this is very good!! It's very thick, so WHEN I make it again I'll probably use a little less yogurt or a little more milk to thin it just a tad (could be because my blueberries were fresh/not frozen?) In any event, the flavor was great!! :)

Love it!  What a great tasting way to get more fruit into your diet.  I love the combination of vanilla, blueberries and banana.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 a banana instead of a whole one. Delicious!

Delicious! I didn't have soy milk, so used regular 1% milk, and I skipped the flax seed. My husband, 2 year old and I slurped it down!

I substituted the soy milk for fat-free milk and I didn't have any flax seed meal....but my boys didn't stop saying yum after I made it!  Thanks for a healthy idea for a dessert.

I used all fresh fruit also adding raspberries small box and 1 matured mango. I omitted yogurt and blended everything together with ice cubes to cool it. It turned out very nice and refreshing.

very good - a few changes but i think recipe is tasty as it is -  1) froze yogurt in an ice cube tray and used 3 cubes rather, 2) added 5 regular ice cubes to the mixture as well, 3) used 1/3 cup of thinly sliced organic, thawed banana, 1/3 cup of fresh organic strawberries and 1/3 cup of frozen blueberries/blackberries. tastes just like the jamba juice bright eyed and blueberry smoothie (although i would use a little less ice next time to avoid watering down flavor).

Great recipe.  I used regular milk and plain yogurt and added a couple of drops of vanilla extract.  It cut the tang of the yogurt just enough.  My banana wasn't frozen, but the blueberries were.  I thought it was cold enough.    Thanks for sharing.

I'm not the biggest fruit eater and bananas just gross me out but I can get them down if they're in a smoothie. I used juice in lieu of the milk and skipped the honey as I felt it was sweet enough. Very good and thank you for a delicious breakfast!

I thought this smoothie was a bit yogurty so next time I may change the milk/yogurt ratio. I used plain yogurt but then had to add sugar to sweeten it a bit. I didn't freeze my banana and the smoothie wasn't cold enough so I added 6 ice cubes and that worked well. All in all, I liked this smoothie and I plan to make it again!

Thia was great, ok I did change a few bits, my berries where frozen, not the banana, I also used plain yogurt and I ended up not adding the honey as I felt it was sweet enough anyway. This one I will use again and again. Thank you

I really liked this recipe.  I was a bit worried because flax seed meal and soy milk sounded like it might not contribute a lot of great taste.  But,  I am delighted to say that this healthy recipe also tastes great!  Thank you for sharing!

Awesome. I used frozen mango instead of banana and almond milk instead of soy. It didn't need the honey at all. Very enjoyable smoothie without all the seeds from berries.
