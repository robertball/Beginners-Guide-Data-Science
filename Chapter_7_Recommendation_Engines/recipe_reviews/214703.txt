Don't waste really good cob corn for this recipe!  I would not plan on serving this warm, as the shredded cheese will just melt into little blobs throughout the pasta - it did for ours.  *IF* you do make this and plan to serve it as a cold salad, *DO* cool the pasta well first.  Second, if you serve it as a cold salad, it definitely needs some kind of dressing.  Lime juice flavor cooks away when it was heated.  I'd save the lime juice to make some kind of dressing with it.  Although we attempted to eat this and enjoy it with grilled chicken as a "warm salad," it wasn't really enjoyable.  I ended up adding the leftovers to chicken tortilla soup, which was much, much better.  It sounded like a good idea, but just didn't work.  It just needs too much doctoring.

I thought this was a great summer salad.  I served it cold.  The pasta does tend to soak up the lime juice overnight but if you serve it the same day it is not a problem.  I took it to a birthday party.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  To add color use tri-color rotini.

Made this rescipe as is.  I served this cold and it needed something to bind it with the pasta, a dressing of some type.  I would either use more corn or less pasta.  The corn seemed lost among the pasta.  Some chopped tomatoes would be a good addition.

Lime almost overpowers the dish. Still very tasty but might want to cut down the Lime Juice & Zest
