I'm always looking for healthier versions of my favorite foods so I was hoping these would become a new favorite. Unfortunately they missed the mark. First off there are way too many breadcrumbs giving an overpowering bread-y flavor. The general guideline is usually 1/2 cup breadcrumbs per pound of meat but I wanted to follow the recipe as written. This is also missing a basic ingredient - salt - making these rather bland. I'd also recommend doubling the garlic and onion powder to help boost the flavor. I checked these after 18 minutes and they were already done so I recommend starting to check around 15 minutes. I served these with a tomato sauce over pasta. Not sure I would make them again unless I made some changes. I loved how quickly they came together though and the ease of baking them.
