Fantastic recipe! I followed it as written, and it yielded a perfectly cooked and seasoned risotto. I added quite a fair amount of salt and pepper to bring out the flavor. Also, the squash and beans add some starchiness to the dish that makes this meal a bit heartier and perhaps more suited to cool weather compared to other risottos. I will make this again!

Hubby and guests really liked it, but I thought it was a tad too bland. Next time, I'll probably double the seasonings and up the tomato and parm a bit. Next time, I'll also bake the squash then remove skins and mash because its easier than peeling.

Very good risotto. I will definitely make it again. I made a few modifications. I added in 1/2 tsp instead of a full tsp. That was plenty. I think the full amount would have been overwhelming to me. I also didn't add the fresh parsley because I didn't have any on hand, so I just used a tbsp of dry and that worked fine (for adding color). My family doesn't like Parmesan, so I left that out. It was good without it, but I think it was better when I added some on top of my portion!

Pretty darn good!  I skipped the tomato because I wasn't feeling it and added garlic instead.  The only downside was the ingredient listing for the squash...they come in all sizes and I wasn't sure if a large squash would overpower the dish/small squash not provide enough flavor; it'd have been helpful if the squash amount was listed in ounces.  My husband and I both quite enjoyed this!

Its a lot of work.  But it was good.  Also it makes a lot of it. I cut it in half and it still made a lot.

I followed the cooking directions but subbed a lot of ingredients I needed to use/had on hand: Israeli couscous for rice, yellow/zucchini squash, cooked lentil beans and left out the tomato. Yummy, yummy, yummy!  Takes some patience and the ability to watch closely (next time I'd try to time it so at least one of my kids is sleeping) but it didn't seem to take as long as previous risotto recipes both my husband and I have tried.
