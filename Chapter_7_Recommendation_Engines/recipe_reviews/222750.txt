FANTASTIC!!! This has to be one of the best pasta salads that I have made, but I do advise to start w/ just one packet of dried Italian dressing mix and go from there (one was all I used and it was perfect for us). I also used one packet to make the dressing that was used in the salad. I grated my parmesan fresh (maybe used a little more than called for, lol), and I think that made a HUGE difference, so definitely do that. I had no fresh mozz. on hand, so I used block and that was fine, but I can't wait to try it w/ the fresh. Hubby commented several times on how much he liked this, so that's saying something. I will def be making this often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Loved it!  This pasta salad was a HUGE hit with my guys.  I know it is because it had meat in it!  I used 1 cup of store brought Italian salad dressing.  I did omit the olives, as we don’t care for them.  I started with 1 – 7oz. pkg. of dry Italian dressing, and it added enough flavor for us, so I did omit the other 2 packages.  This is a salad that improves in flavor the longer it has a chance to meld.  It lasted great for a few days to pack in lunches.  That is big in this house, as we have 3 people who pack almost every day.  This will be a “used often” recipe to have for summer cookouts.

I substituted green Manzanillo olives with pimiento from Spain for black olives, and sliced them in half. The basic salad mixture was very bland, so I added a small amount of salt, pepper, dried oregano and basil and mixed them in. Bingo... the salad came alive as I knew it would.

Great start up pasta salad recipe however I made some changes.  Instead of italian dressing I found an avocado dressing at the store that I used instead.  I did not add the dry italian dressing, thought it would make it too salty.  It was fabulous!!  I also omitted black olives and used Salad Supreme seasoning from McCormick's that gave it a little extra flavor.  I meant to add cucumber but forgot to buy at store but that would make a great addition to this salad.  Kids loved it!!!

Everyone enjoyed this recipe. The amount of salami can be reduced without affecting flavor. Also you can add your own touches for variety like adding cherry tomatoes.

I took this salad to a church meal.  It was very easy to make, and everyone at church liked it!  I chopped the peppers a little smaller, but no other differences.  I’ll be making this again!

This was a hit at my table, but I have to say, it was a too spicy for me. I'm terrible with spice so I'll definitely use either less or no Italian dressing mix. I'll cut back on the onion either since that too was a bit much. Maybe it's because I used a large red onion instead of a smaller one, but there was too much. I'm a bland person, I know. This salad just packed too much of a punch for me personally. Mom and brother loved it though!

This is the first time I've made pasta salad. I used this as a base to get an idea of amounts and ran with it. Some ingredients I didn't either have or the kids don't like, so I adapted. Husband loved it and says it'll be a request from now on.

Love how simple and delicious this recipe is - perfect for parties!  After looking at other reviews though, I decided to go with just 1 packet instead of the 3 called for, and upped the amount of Italian dressing as well (an additional 1/2 cup).  I used pepperoni instead (personal preference) and added a cup of zucchini.  Tomato would be a great addition as well.  With a few personalized tweaks, I'm super happy!

A delicious summer-time meal or any -time-of- year side dish. My 10 ten year old son requests this salad. I didn't have the mozzarella cheese balls on hand so improvised using sliced mozzarella cheese sticks. Yummy! Love this recipe!

We really liked this quick and easy pasta salad.  I had to improvise by using shredded mozzarella and only used the dressing, not the dry mix and it was still fantastic!  Thanks for sharing, Trish!

This pasta salad was fantastic!  I made it for a family gathering and it was a big hit! I followed the directions except for the amount of Italian seasoning packets, I only used one as some  of the other reviewers recommended. I will make it again.

Fantastic salad.  I also only used only one pkg of the dry italian seasoning mix and the flavors were perfect.  The Italian salami is iportant as it has more oil in it and moistened the salad.  Made evening before and refrigerated overnight to mix flavors.  Just stirred after it reached room temperature the next day.  It was a huge hit at our July 4th picnic.  My new go to pasta salad.

This is the best recipe for pasta salad ever! 
I make this for every event I go to and I always get tons of compliments.  The thing that makes this recipe so good is the dry Italian seasoning, it makes all the difference. I start with 2 packs and only add the 3rd if I feel like it needs it. I do add more veggies, like cherry tomatoes, broccoli and cucumber. And I think this is the reason why 3 packs of Italian seasoning works for me because I'm adding more to the salad.
Also.. I have also made it vegetarian and its still just as good.

A few tips.... After pasta is cooked, run cold water over it and then add a little olive oil. Also, try topping it off with McCormick Salad Supreme Seasoning. (you wont be sorry you did.)

Very good and simple salad.  Been making this for years.  I do omit the dry Italian dressing.  Don't feel it's needed.

It calls for way too many dressing packets. It would be fine with none, but is much too strong with three.

Delicious! You may need to add and stir in a spot more  of the salad dressing after refrigerating for a day or so.

Made it for friends- and whole family just loved it! The salami and fresh mozzarella added so much flavor- yum. I followed others advice and used only one packet of dry dressing mix

Fantastic! I had not seen a recipie using the dry mix in addition to the salad dressing. I’m putting that trick in the toolbox! Definitely kicked up the flavor factor!

1lb pasta. 1lb salami. 12oz. Moz balls. 1/2 sweet onion. 1/4 yellow pepper. 1 pkg dry dressing mix. 16oz. bottle Italian dressing. Made this for a family reunion and didn’t take any home. I would have given this 5 stars but I don’t consider this recipe quick!!

I don't especially like green or red peppers, so instead used a 3 oz pkg of sun-dried tomatoes with basil.  I couldn't find mozzarella balls so just cut up a block. Also only used  envelope of Italian dressing mix. It is DELICIOUS, definitely a keeper and will be making this many more times!

I used all the ingredients as mentioned with the exception of the following:  I omitted the dry italian dressing mix.  And in lieu of the one cup of italian dressing, I used equal amounts of bottled italian salad dressing and bottled creamy caesar salad dressing. I'm sure I used more than 1 cup total and likely used about 1 cup of each.  I must have used more veggies than called for because it make a lot and by using only one cup of salad dressing, it was too dry.  I took this to a pot luck dinner and everyone liked it.

Thought I'd use this quick recipe, and I think the one envelope of dry dressing was plenty. Added chopped canned artichokes too. Able to prep all of this the night before, only adding Italian dressing the next day. (I made this for a group of 16, using two boxes of pasta but I think it was too much.)

Made it the first time as instructions but with 1 packet of the Italian Dressing (due to comments from others who made it).  Turned out great!  Second time, not so much.  I think I let the pasta cook too long and the ingredients got lost in the process because the pasta was too swollen (lol).  Will try again and only cook the pasta for 12 minutes or less.

This salad is so flavorful.  I only use one package of dry Italian dressing mix and it adds great depth to the liquid dressing.  I even use this with gluten free pasta for my hubby.

Loved this pasta salad! It was a hit at the party for sure! Like others, I only used 1 pack of Italian dressing as it was all I had on hand but worked out perfectly! I also substituted 1/2 lb. pepperoni for salami and chunk mozzarella for fresh. This recipe is a keeper!

Pretty good recipe. Definitely does not need Italian seaming packet. The dressing is enough although I did add salt and pepper to taste. I also added a jar of sundries tomatos in oil, so I omitted the red bell pepper. I still used the green bell pepper.  Very hearty pasta  I would use this as a main dish for a quick meal.

This is the best pasta salad I've made.  It's so versatile you can change it up to your own taste.  The secret ingredient is the "packet" of Italian dressing. I also used one packet as others suggested and Olive Garden Italian Dressing.  No added salt was needed.  I added mozzarella cheese sticks cut into bite size pieces some blanched baby carrots and grape tomatoes for color and variety.  Everyone enjoyed it and this will be my go to pasta salad from now on.

This recipe was fantastic.  I had to take a dish to a Church meeting and everyone absolutely loved it.  My husband and I did not get to indulge in any of it that day.  I made a batch for us the next evening and we understood why I got so many compliments.  It was easy, inexpensive and tasted great.

Great pasta salad! I agree that 1 package of dry salad dressing is enough.

Used just 2 dressing packets, 3 was too  strong. Added sliced mushrooms & asparagus tips plus replaced the salami with pepperoni . Delish and easy. Thanks Trish.

Great recipe for a go-to Italian pasta salad. We had to add more dressing after it sat for a night.

I made my pasta only with olives and cherry tomatoes. I sprinkled romano/parmesan cheese on top and it came out delicious!

Made this up for my family visiting after long commute. They ate it all up. Served with a loaf of Italian bread. Nothing left. A real treat after eating on the road.

I made this for an Italian potluck at work today.  I got many compliments.  The one thing I would def do differently is the olives.  it calls for 6 oz. I used 2oz can of black and about 3oz kalamata olives (b/c I read a review that said she used those), and it was WAY too many olives and very salty.  I also used 1 package of the Italian dry dressing which was sufficient.  I used pepperoni since I like that better than salami.  Next time I will use only 2oz of black olives or even omit them entirely.  Overall this recipe is one of the best I've ever tried and 2 of my compliments were from fantastic cooks.

This is so good! I used zesty Italian dressing and just 1 packet of the dry Italian dressing mix. There's so much you could do to this to make it your own.

Very good!  The multi-colored rotini comes in a 16 oz size.  1 pkg of the dry italian dressing is plenty.  12 to 14 oz of both the salami and the mozzarella is plenty.  I didn't dice the meat, I cut into more of a chopped size.  I used packaged, whole milk mozzarella, instead of the balls (very soft and creamy).  I used Olive Garden Italian dressing and made this the night before.  The next day I needed to add about a cup more of the dressing.  It was the hit of the party that night and I will definitely make this again!

This is a delicious pasta salad. I used pepperoni instead of salami and I cut up mozzarella instead of using fresh mozzarella balls. The cheese doesn't get soggy that way. One packet of Italian seasoning is plenty, I actually used half a packet and it was great. Easy recipe and one to keep.

I  made this without the bell peppers and only used 1 packet of dry Italian dressing. I added extra Italian salad dressing and extra parm and cherry tomatoes. The combination of the fresh mozza, hard Italian salami, and sweet cherry tomatoes is divine. It was DELICIOUS and oh, so easy!

Very good pasta salad! I omitted the peppers because we aren't fans and used mini pepperoni instead of the salami because it was quicker. I also only used only 1 packet of the dried Italian dressing. Will make again!

Followed the recipe exactly.  It turned out great!  Next time I will add some cherry tomatoes and cut back on the salami to lower the fat content.  Either way, this is a keeper and we will make it again.

First time making pasta salad. Love the recipe! A good-sized batch, that will save me money, with left-overs. Perfect for work lunches, etc. Easy to modify, and play with how heavy or light you wanna go with the veggies, and meat. Very good!!!

Our daughter made this for a huge family get together to celebrate our  Grandson's first birthday. She had 30 family members and friends attending so she tripled the recipe.. WOW! It simply was one of the best pasta salads we have tried; her tripled recipe batch disappeared almost instantly with almost everyone going back for seconds. We have, now, made it for our empty nester household and, as my wife says, simply keep a batch on hand for lunch, dinner and anytime snacking.  Good stuff!  Thank you!

I made this as a side dish for an international dinner club we host weekly and it was a hit! I used calamata olives instead of black. Used capers (small kind), and added mustard powder to the balsamic vinagrette.  I used sliced deli salami cut into small strips.  EXCELLENT!

Great but one packet was really flavorful so I didn't add anymore. Also I felt like it needed Cherry tomatoes to bring it together so I added that.

I made this recipe without the peppers, onion, and black olives and it was quite delicious!  One thing to note -- this is actually a HUGE amount of pasta salad so the recipe as is will be great for big gatherings, but should perhaps be halved at least if you're making it just to have around the house to munch on.  Otherwise, the flavors here are fantastic.

I use this recipe often... I just don't measure and sometimes swap things in and out based on what i have... The one change that i routinely make is that i only use 1 pkg of dry italian dressing.  I love the flavors, but 3 is too much for us.  Today when i made it, i added cannelli beans, black olives, and boiled egg to the regular ingredients and omitted salami.  Also, to save cash, i buy a large blob of fresh mozzarella instead of the little balls.  It's half the price and easy to cut into chunks.  You just cant go wrong on this recipe...

DH gave this a rare "5 stars" but I'm giving it 4 stars just because I think it could use about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups of Italian dressing since the pasta tends to soak up the dressing. All in all a very good pasta salad and a great make ahead dinner and one that could easily be added to ... next time I'll add some grape tomatoes as well.

My family really liked this.  Like a lot of reviewers I only used one packet of Italian seasoning and that combined with salad dressing was very flavorful. The tri-colored pasta and all the additions made it look very appealing and also taste great!

I made this for a family birthday party and everyone seemed to like it.  I made a few changes, but only due to not having the ingredients.  I used mini pepperoni instead of the Italian sausage, I only used 1 package of the dry Italian dressing (per other reviews) and I did not have shredded parmesan cheese.  I don't think any of this altered the taste of the pasta.  My husband said it is a "keeper".
