I made two small changes--I only used one pint of grape tomatoes and I used fresh spinach leaves instead of romaine lettuce leaves. For a quick throw-together pasta salad, this turned out very nicely. It paired great with barbeque rubbed pork/chicken. Next time, I'd like to try this with tofu shirataki pasta and see how it turns out. This way I could enjoy this with my family and not worry so much about carb counts.

Good!!! Pasta salads like this are great because they are so forgiving; you can adjust them every which way and it'll still work out just fine! I skipped the onion, added crushed red pepper flakes, added cucumber, used fresh basil, and used garlic power instead of fresh because I can't handle raw garlic. I also ended up adding a little Italian dressing to add some zing. Thanks :)

This is fantastic with "Balsamic Salad dressing" by Alice Coates (a virtually fat and calorie free tomato juice based dressing) also on this site. I made this with whole wheat pasta and left out the olive oil to make it fit my diet plan. I did not expect to love it so much!

This is good stuff and her dad is right put whatever you want in this. I didn't have fresh tomatoes or mushrooms so I used canned (drained and rinsed) used green onions and added some green olives that needed to be used. I totally forgot about the lettuce at the end but was good without it. Very forgiving, very cheap, and very easy. Def keeper.
