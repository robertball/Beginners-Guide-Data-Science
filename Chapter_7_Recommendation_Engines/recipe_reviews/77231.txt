Ok, I skipped the "swanky" punch bowl and scaled this recipe down, made it in a pitcher and did a trial run for my husband and I to see if this was worthy for Christmas dinner. It doesn't make the cut but it wasn't bad. I chilled all ingredients first (a must when making punch) and thought it tasted too much like pineapple juice. I also added vodka to each individual glass, that way you can control how much liquor you get and make the drinkers and non drinkers happy. Also, that way you don't have to make sure the kids stay out of it! It was refreshing, I may make again but if I do I'm scaling WAY back on the pineapple juice. Also added just a touch of grenadine to make it pretty.

This punch is utterly amazing-- not too sweet, but not too boozy either.  Even tastes better the next day, which is why it has come to be known as "breakfast punch" 'round these parts.

I used this recipe to take to the office Christmas party. It was a hit! It is easy to make and taste's delicious. Use an expensive Vodka and you'll never know what hit you!

Everyone at our gathering loved this punch, I used gingerale instead of the lemon lime soda, and I made the ice out of some of the pineapple juice.  The punch was gone in an hour

This is a great "retro" punch. I used pink grapefruit since It was for a girls night and it was a hit. I did add a bit more vodka too...watch out, it can be dangerous! ;)
