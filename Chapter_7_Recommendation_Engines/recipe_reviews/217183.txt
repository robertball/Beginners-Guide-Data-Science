This is absolutely phenomenal. Best pork roast I've ever had or made! 

A few notes - I used fresh squeezed orange juice, about 1/4 cup chicken broth instead of bouillon, dried cherries instead of raisins, and skipped the starch. It probably came out a bit more "broth-y" than the original recipe intends, but it was still fantastic! Also, another reviewer mentioned it was too salty for their taste - my husband and I did not notice the salt at all, but perhaps using chicken broth instead of bouillon mitigated the salt content.

We tried this dish today. I wanted to love it. It has a lot of flavors that I adore. However, my husband and I agree that the recipe came out far too salty. Furthermore, the balance between the fruit taste and the curry was not properly balanced. If we try this again, I will definitely add more raisins and possibly more apple. I would also remove the salt from the ingredient list.

I was looking for a recipe that had all the ingredients in the house and this one fit the bill.  I was a little hesitant about 3 Tablespoons of Curry - but no worries this was awesome.  I didn't have potato starch so I used a litttle bit of cornstarch mixed with cold water but didn't thicken the sauce until the meat was done.  I served this with Jasmine rice and steamed green beans.  Hubby says that this is "Meat and Potato" guy approved.  I will be making this again, for sure.  As a side note I used a 4 quart slow cooker and there was more than enough room maybe even a little bit big for this recipe.

I would give this a 5 star but as the recipe is, (Very good) it is still missing a little pazzaz. So I have made this 3 times now and have decided with a little tweaking of the original recipe it could get a 5 star from me. 
This is what I think helps but everyone has a different prefernce, so see what you think:
I doubled all the ingredients and only added 1/2 pound more pork. I added 1/2 of a can of chunked Pineapple and the Pineapple juice in the can I mixed with the Orange Juice. I didn't add the water with potatoe starch because I prefer it more soupy and think the juices seep into the pork better when it is thinner liquid.
I also am using dried cranberries as well as the raisins. The cranberries actually have better flavor and is more complimentary to the recipe. I also used sweetened coconut flakes instead of unsweetened. This is the only Paleo recipe I could find on this site and I was thrilled! Thank  you!

I was surprised how well this turned out and will make again.
Reading the reviews I was worried there wouldn't be enough flavor so I added a little more cinn. extra apple and doubled the curry and added about 1/2 tsp of garam masala, and 2 whole cloves and 2 bay leaves and tangerine juice because its what i had. After cooking 4 hours I  plucked an orange from my tree and added a tsp of the zest. I did not add coconut but planned to add coconut milk if it needed it, but it didn't in my opinion.  I just used pork chops what was on sale at the store,and cut them up. Very tender sweet and spicy-really delicious- economical- healthy and EASY. Can make sauce thick by adding cornstarch and cold water together at end of cooking but I liked it soupy.

I must first confess... I inadvertently tweaked this recipe quite a bit, although I don't think I changed the taste much. I only have a bunch of cuties on hand, so I peeled them, and just threw them in the pot (and mashed them up in the pot), didn't have an apple, so used applesauce instead. Didn't have raisins so used dates and didn't like coconut, so omitted them. Didn't have a slow cooker, so just cooked them in a pot for slightly under an hour. Last thing, added frozen broccoli in towards the end of the cooking time. I actually enjoy the taste (without the coconut) very much and the orange pulp made the potato starch redundant. Such an easy but yummy meal to make!! Would be doing this often from now on!

I tried, and I really wanted to like it. Very bland, imo.  Could have used some pineapple (fresh) perhaps, or something else. It's edible, but I wouldnt make it again, sorry.

After reading other reviews, I also tweaked the recipe a bit.  I recommend adding craisins and/or replacing the raisins.  I used both, but the craisins added another layer of flavor that it needed.  It was not too spicey, the pork was very moist.  I also left out potato starch.  It was great over brown rice.

This is not an authentic paleo recipe.  You cannot use fruit juice or potato starch.  I juiced an orange and used coconut flour for gravy thickening.  The taste was good, I would definitely double or triple the ginger and cinnamon for added flavor.  Probably add a sprig or two of thyme for an extra layer of flavor.  This is a pretty good base recipe to add.  Paleo recipes long for flavour and we have so many options.

I'm going to try this in my pressure cooker.  Instead of 6 hours, it will take little more than 6 minutes, but still have that all day taste.  Served over rice...ooh, my mouth is watering and my stomach is growling!

Fabulous flavor! Reminded me of an exotic Moroccan or Indian dish. I didn't have potato starch, so I substituted corn starch, which worked fine. And I added a mixture of dried cranberries, golden raisins, cherries and blueberries instead of the raisins and it added an unexpected and welcomed flavor! Served over brown/wild rice mixture, which was a great compliment. Done in 5 hrs (2 on high, 3 on low). Highly recommend!

It needs some tweaking. I didn't add the salt, but found it to be bland in the end so I added before serving to balance the tart apple. I also added another tablespoon of curry (i used red curry paste)at the end as well, I may add more. I used tapioca to thicken during cooking - other slow cooker recipes use that. I had raisens and currants. I may try adding sweet potato vs. tapioca to thicken, sweetness may balance the apple.

I followed someone's comment and used chicken broth rather than the bullion granules. It was a delicious meal and a big hit. I'll definitely make this dish again. I served it with jasmine rice. This dinner would go well with a sweet desert or white wine

Just starting Paleo. If everything tastes this good I may have found a solution to my carb addiction.
I changed apples to canned madarin oranges as well as cornstarch instead of potato starch. It was great.

I made this recipe as is minus the raisins since I did not have any but I don't think the raisins would have made that much of a difference of any.  It smelled great while it was in the crock pot cooking.  The finished flavor was bland though.

This was great. I didn't change a thing while preparing it. However, a half an hour before serving it,  I mixed in pre-baked potato halves. It was a wonderful addition.  My personal thought was that it was a tad too salty for which my husband disagreed. So, on my plate I mixed in a dollop of sour cream to offset the salt. That worked well.

Amazing!  I too used chicken broth instead of boullion and it was not too salty.  Placed over egg noodles, will definitely be making over and over again.  Good recipe for full time working mom, you can prep everything in the crock pot the night before and just put it on low in the morning!

Outstanding - the flavors were terrific and sauce was amazing.  I should have let the pork cook a bit more to become a bit more tender.

I really liked this recipe but would change one thing. Exchange the coconut milk for flakes we liked the flavor better. The flakes where tough. My picky family loved it!

Me and my boyfriend loved this dish. I followed another reviewer and added some chunk pineapple and juice. Served over Basmati rice from World Market. I will make again because the mix of flavors was so good BUT I would prefer a little kick from a pinch of cayenne next time. Still gets 5 stars smelled so good while cooking. :)

I made this following the recipe almost exactly.  I ended up with more pork than it called for but that wasn't a problem.  It is full of flavor from the spices and the apples and raisins and the meat was very tender.  The coconut looks a little strange though and I'm not sure that 1/4 cups adds all that much to the finished dish.  Will probably omit it the next time around.  Served it with quinoa and sweet peas.  Would also be good with plain boiled potatoes or even a baked sweet potato.  Perfect for cooler autumn days.

This is amazing! I only made a few changes according to what I had on hand... Apple Juice for the orange, Onion Soup Mix for the chicken bouillon, left out the raisins and salt and waited until it was all cooked to strain the juice and add the water and Corn Starch mixture to make the gravy. Served it w/Rice flavored w/Goya Adobo, Green Peas w/Onion and Dill, and Peppered Italian Green Beans. The pork is very moist and tender and flavorful. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

There's no potato starch allowed on my paleo diet, and it certainly wouldn't be served with white rice.  Otherwise, YUMMY, although I added a little spice to it.  Great tastes.

Best pork loin recipe.  Everyone including the kids loved this dinner.   I followed the suggestion of a reviewer to double the spices in the recipe, add sm. can chunk pineapple with the juice and cranberries as they have more flavor.

OMG I've been doing paleo for a while and this is my favorite recipe yet!  I used fresh squeeze OJ AND arrowroot flour instead of potato.  I also added butternut squash and went heavy w the spices for added flavor!  This ones a keeper!

The men loved it. The women thought it was good, and one added Teryaki. I added hot sauce to mine. I liked the curry flavor. I also replaced the orange juice with apple sauce and it made the base nice and thick. I don't think everyone was a fan of curry, but if you are this is the recipe for you! As I mentioned, the men loved it as it was a little spicy. You've got to want a spicy curry flavor if you make this. If you do want that, you will love this. I liked it a lot.

Yum!  Subbed chicken stock for the bullion so didn't need the water or starch and pork was super tender fall apart awesomeness after 9 hrs on low (set before I left for work).  Also didn't have ginger so threw in some smoked paprika and it gave it a nice kick and tons of flavor.  Such a nice change from BBQ pulled pork!

The meat was tender, but we felt like the curry was just overpowering.  I won't be making this again.  If you love curry, though, you'll love this.

Make three times the amount of sauce. It is that good. Reduce salt by 1/2 when using bullion . Add another Tbsp of curry for zing. I used green apples and craisins. Excellent over rice with broccoli.

Great slow cooker recipe for paleo eaters out there.  I also doubled up on all the spices and I might have gone overboard.  I was so afraid from the reviews it would not be flavorful enough.  I overdid it and it was super flavorful!  Next time I'll add more pork and not quite double the spices.

Made this recipe as Imaged1 reviewed ( Double ingredients with half pound extra pork, no starch) and it was out of this world!  I used salt free bouillon, which may help for any who don't want lots of salt.  I will make this again and again!  Thanks for this one!!

Not sure if it was me and if I took too many reviewer suggestions, but ugh! This SO didn't work! The leftovers went to waste and that almost never happens!

I am starting my Paleo diet today so I figured I would give this recipe a try.  I am not huge on fruits being added to my main course meals so I omit the apples & the raisins. Instead of potato starch (which is a no no to paleo) I used Arrowroot powder & I seard the meat prior to adding the rest of the ingridients.  Not only did this dish have my home smelling delicious but this was by far one of my favorite Pork Loin recipes.  Thanks for sharing ThisChris

I never really liked curry, but this is one of the best things to come out of my crock pot in a long time.  I followed the recipe exactly and found this to be a wonderful melange of flavors with pork cubes that were fork-tender, but held together nicely.  I served it over white rice and added some naan for a "company-worthy" meal.

Sorry, but didn't care for it.  But in it's defense, I'm not much on curry dishes--but it suunded SOOOOO good I had to give it a try.  Oh well.....
