This was a very good, simple recipe, perfect for fall baking.  I think if some people are experiencing problems with this not turning out firmer it could be the type of apple they are using. Granny Smith are known to keep their shape when cooked or baked, whereas a macintosh or cortland are going to cook down quite a bit. It all depends what kind of apple you prefer to work with. We like the macintosh here so I don't mind if the bars don't come out as firm, the flavor we enjoy is there. Give it a try, but keep in mind the type of apple you use will most likely affect the outcome.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this recipe. Got lots of compliments when I took it to work. I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 stoneware bar pan. I also, completely by accident, substituted the baking soda with baking powder which made them more bar-like and very chewy (which is great because I'm not a big fan of cake-like textures).

This is one of those recipes that deserves 10 stars because there's no need to change anything for reasons other than personal taste, and it does exactly what it says it will do.  My personal tastes do not like walnuts, so I sub'd half oats-half finely chopped pecans.  And I threw in a dash of nutmeg.  Just to dress it up a little, I made Luscious Buttercream Frosting (Submitted by: Land O'Lakes, Inc.) from this website and served it along side so people could use their desired amount.  Admittedly, I was concerned the frosting would be too rich for such a rustic bar, but they both balanced each other out, giving an absolutely delicious dessert that everyone raved about!

Great recipe! These aren't like other fruit bars (like lemon). They don't have a crust like others.  They are more like an apple muffin cut into bar shape. But very easy to customize to your own tastes.  I used 3 VERY large granny smith apples, chopped. (I like lots of fruit in my pies and bars!!!) I added a little more flour to supplement for the extra apples. I kept the 8x8 inch pan and sprinkled brown sugar on top, baked just over an hour. Kept them in the fridge, I love them cold.  Next time I want to make caramel sauce to go on top.

I'm sure it's my fault if others made this dish successfully, but I knew before I put it in the baking dish that the consistency wasn't right.  Sure enough, when it was done baking, it would not hold together like a "bar" should.  The taste was good, but we had to eat it with a spoon!

My boyfriend and I went to an apple orchard and I was struggling to come up with something to do with the abundance of apples.   This recipe was delicious and hassle free.  It made the whole house smell amazing.  It's a lot like apple bread as opposed to a bar.  Huge hit with co-workers!

I just baked these and they turned out very tasty. They are more like a bread or a very cakey cookie. I used oatmeal instead of nuts and it turned out delicious. The only thing I'd change is maybe adding more apples next time.

This is a delicious alternative to apple crisp.I served it in pie wedges with a dollop of vanilla ice cream and a bit of caramel sauce.  I used some of the other suggestions and used 1/2cup of oats and 1/2 cup of walnuts and added a bit of lemon zest.  I left my apples pretty chunky to see if I could get more apple taste based on others reviews. I had to cook mine about 50 minutes but that might just be my oven and so it was a bit brown on top which I disguised with some powdered sugar.  I was very pleased with the result.

I took the advice of another reader and used 1/2 c. of white surgar and 1/4 c. brown sugar.  Also added 1/4 c. butterscotch chips.  Used 1 1/4 c. flour and 1/2 c of oats. I added 1/2 t. of vanilla and used baking powder instead of soda to make a firmer bar.  They taste like apple crisp. Yum.

The consistency was good and moist. The top was too crumbly. I doubled the recipe and didn't change anything except for adding a pinch of salt and an extra cup of granny smith apples...I was already skeptical of the baking soda because it changes the taste of fruit and vegetables, Should have stuck to my instinct.... The apples held their shape very well and one would think wow nice! lots of apples BUT -Still we couldn't taste any of the amazing fresh apples we had added, and the apple aroma and flavor was seriously lacking. I think the amount of cinnamon is overpowering and adding baking powder instead of the baking soda would have kept the flavor...If making apple bars again I would try another recipe.

This was so easy and delicious! I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13" pan and baked for about 45 minutes. I didn't add nuts b/c of an allergy and added some oats.

I made these for a work function, everyone loved them. I made a double batch and substitued half of the butter with applesauce and then sprinkled oatmeal on top. They turned out very moist and very tasty! We are nut free at work so I couldn't add the nuts but they are fine without them.

I didn't have baking soda so used baking powder instead, used a little less sugar (3/4 cup) since I don't like things overly sweet, and also threw in some raisins and a little bit of milk to make it easier to spread out the batter.  I think they're great!  It only took 30 minutes for them to bake.  They didn't rise, so this recipe is like a bar (think lemon bars).  Doubling the recipe in an 8 X 8 pan would make it thicker, more like an apple cake.  It doesn't really make 16 bars, unless you like them very small.  I cut it into thirds for a total of 9 bars.  Using a type of apple that's sour is a good suggestion.

This was solidly ok. It really need some cinnamon and nutmeg...or maybe I needed different apples, but kinda tastless overall. Of course, when served warm wtih vanilla ice cream, no one complained about the flat flavor of the cake.

Had a bag of Macintosh apples in the fridge which were starting to get soft so I decided to make something other than apple crisp (because for some reason I can't for the life of me make an apple crisp that doesn't turn into a soup!). Was a spur of the moment thing, didn't have any butter in fridge nor any apple sauce so used peach sauce that my 1 year old daughter usually has as a snack. And I added some oats as Macintosh apples don't hold their own very well..  Followed the rest of the recipe to a T. Turned out great!!! Perfect with tea. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the great alternative to apple crisp!!

Sorry, but this was dry, dry, dry!  I used 1/3 more apple than what the recipe called for and still, it turned out more like a coffee cake rather than the moist "bar" I was hoping for.

Very good and simple recipe!  I used "Pie Blend" apples and had no issues with the recipe not turning out.  Next time I would add a little bit of nutmeg and salt to increase the flavor slightly.  Otherwise very good!

This was delicious and so easy! But definitely turned out to be more of a cake than bars. I drizzled caramel syrup and dusted powdered sugar on top of mine after baking.

Very good! I didn't have any walnuts so we substituted pecans. I had a lone envelope of low sugar apple, cinnamon oatmeal that I poured on top and patted with butter before I put it in the oven.  We really enjoyed this, thank you!

These turned out phenomenal! It was a hit with the family, and very easy to make. No criticism from me here; I'll be making these again in the near future!

LOVE these! I received a large bag of apples that were "2nd's", bruised, etc.
I peeled and chopped the usable parts and made these bars. They were SO easy that I made 4 small pans for Pastor Apreciation Month. I also made myself a diabetic-friendly version using Splenda and whole wheat flour and they were fabulous as well. Not only do these taste great and have a wonderful texture, but the small number of ingredients (and the fact hat all ingredients are pantry staples)will make these a must have in my recipe binder!

Ok... I usually laugh at people that substitute everything in a recipe... but I did a lot of substitutions... I used whole wheat flour, canola oil instead of butter, half of the walnuts for dried cranberries, I used egg beaters and cooking splenda... probably at least half the calories. They were dry when I made them last night... but this morning they are moist and tasty.

These were excellent! They WERE dense and moist and wonderful.  I did use 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar because I like the flavor of brown sugar.  We will make these often.  Thank you!

My first time trying this recipe, so I made it almost exactly as written and it was delicious. I did substitute pecans for the walnuts only because that's what I had on hand. It was a little bit "crumbly", but wondering if it was because my pecans were chopped very fine. I would definitely make it again.

Splendidly wonderful! I had 3 apples on hand which I wanted to use to bake/make something when I happened on this recipe .. (although I used only 2 of the apples to make this!). These bars are absolutely mouth-wateringly delish! I didn't add chopped walnuts 'coz I didn't have any on hand ... and used 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of the 1 cup white sugar. I still found these rather sweet ... but everyone else in the family found them perfect! Next time, I want to try this with walnuts, less sugar and with the 'Luscious Buttercream Frosting (Submitted by: Land O'Lakes, Inc.) from this website' that another reviewer (Sharon8799) mentioned worked well with these bars! Thanx for sharing S. Powell, these bars are going to go down the generations in my family! :D
P.S: My bars were done within 30 minutes ... so do keep an eye on yours to prevent them from burning.

Yummy:) these don't last very long in my house. I'm allergic to nuts, so instead of walnuts, I used about a 1/2C. quick cook oats and about 1/2C. raisins. I also like it with brown sugar crumbled on top.

This was really good, like a very moist apple cake. Added about 1/2 cup more apples and used half brown and half white sugar, and a pinch of cloves and nutmeg!

Soooo good!! I doubled the batch and baked in 9x13. I added oatmeal and pecans and 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. It went so quick that I had to make a 2nd batch for everyone who didn't get to try it the first time.

I substituted baking powder for the baking soda as another reviewer suggested. I made them in mini muffin tins and put a light cinnamon-roll style glaze on them. Huge Hit!!! Moist and delightful- everyone in my Sunday school class enjoyed them!

This was so easy and delicious! I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13" pan and baked for about 45 minutes. I omitted the nuts and substituted oats; next time I think I would add the recommended amount of nuts as well as the oats.

Great flavor, but mine really sank in the middle due to altitude.  I'd try them again, but I'd have to play with the amounts of sugar/flour/baking soda.  Much more like a cake than a bar.

These bars are wonderful and made the kitchen smell incredible while baking. I don't have a decent 8x8 pan to bake in, so I changed the serving size to 24 and baked it in a 9x9 square pan for the same 40 minutes. Baked perfectly, moist and a little sugary crunch to the top. I have a feeling it will be even better after a couple days.

I don't know what the lower ratings did wrong, but mine came out perfect.  All I did was substitute oats in place of walnuts, and it held together well, cooked at the exact time, and were VERY MOIST!  I think next time I will food processer the apples to make them even smaller.  My 2 year old LOVED these.  EASY, QUICK & GOOD!

I just made this tonight (Halloween) and it turned out beautifully.  I am a long-time baker - and my husband said, It was the best recipe I've made in a long time.  I did double the recipe & baked it in a 9 x 13 pan.  I used one stick of butter and a half cup of canola oil; half white sugar & half brown; I added raisins for some of the nuts and 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg & sprinkled the cut up apples with fresh lemon.  I left the peel on the apples - used Fuji - and it turned out moist with a crunchy topping.  This is a winner - will make it again - a wonderful autumn and holiday dessert.  Thank you for submitting it.

These were definitely not what I would call a bar, it was an apple cake.  But man, was it easy and delicious.  Even though I usually try to base my reviews off of the recipe exactly as written, these came out so good I just had to write a little something.  Here were my few changes: doubled the apples, added a tsp of vanilla, and substituted cinnamon apple sauce for the butter.  I really loved the consistancy and moistness of this cake!  It reminded me of a prune cake my mother used to make, so I might try it again using prunes next time.  Thank you!

Great recipe for utilizing quickly ripening apples.  I opted for a healthier version:  used whole wheat flour, twice the apples, half the butter, and instead of 1 c sugar I used 1/4 c organic sugar + 1/4 c raw honey.  Also added 1/2 t cloves.  Can't even tell it's a healthier version!

This is very very good. My husband loves it. We have been on an apple kick lately and he said this is the best apple recipe so far. I did half white sugar and half brown, and added more apples and a dash of vanilla. But other than that, I didnt change anything. Comes out like a cake rather than a bar but my husband said hes glad it did! Really good cold!

Oh my goodness, this is absolutely to DIE for good. I used some random cheap apple that was going to go bad on me, and instead of greasing/flouring I used baking spray on my dish, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly, and this is SO good. It reminds me of the apple cake my mom used to make but lost the recipe for! I'm already imagining raisins, peanut butter, coconut, pears, lots and lots of variations :) Thank you for posting this recipe!

Mm these were all right. Not the best. I was disappointed that they didn't look like the bar in the picture, which looks really delicious. As other reviewers have pointed out, these are extremely cakey, and even with an added dash of nutmeg and a bit of maple syrup, they still would've been bland if not for the apples. I even added an extra bit of cinnamon, but they still weren't all that flavourful. They were moist, but held together well, and I used two cups of apples. I didn't finely chop them since I wanted to be able to clearly taste the apple, since it's my favourite fruit... Oh well. They still taste good, just not great.

This is probably the easiest desert I have ever made an it is absolutely delicious. I love that the ingredients are things that I almost always have on hand. It's cold and snowy out today and I wanted to make my family a treat but I did not want to head out in the snow to go to the grocery store. I stumbled across this recipe and am I glad I did. I followed it to a "T" and was rewarded with a yummy warm desert for very little effort. Served it with whipped cream...my hubby and six-year old both had two helpings...5 stars!!!!

Much more apples are needed. I used about 3 cups of apples. I also caramelized the apples before I added them to the badder, which gave the appled much more flavor. I used about 2 TBLSp butter to caramelize and about 1/4 cup brown sugar and the cinnamon called for in the recipe. Then, I used applesause instead of the butter in the recipe and no sugar. I also used instant maple oat packs because that's what I had on hand. I also smashed a banana into it that was very very ripe and had to be used. I came out amazing!!! moist, not too sweet, full of apple.

I love the bars!  I do some catering and my clients always love them.  The only changes I made were to toast the nuts before adding them to the batter, and I mix a little cream, cinnamon and powder sugar together to make a glaze that I drizzle over the bars.

I found these FAR too sweet. I added extra apples, and chopped them coarsely instead for some chunky appley goodness. I also substituted some of the walnuts with raisins, yum! A little too moist, but the bar held together well. Smells heavenly too!

These were very good!  Everyone loved them.  They were moist and chewy, but not runny or gooey like other people complained of.  i honestly don't see how you could have had a problem if you followed the recipe.  

I took others suggestions and used half brown sugar, half white sugar.  I doubled the recipe, using 2 cups of apple chunks (instead of smaller slices) and 1/4 cup of sliced almonds (didn't have any walnuts or pecans on hand).  they turned out delicious!

DELICIOUS!!!! everyone  (especially me!) loved them! they are very moist - exactly what I was looking for. I was concerned that the Granny Smith apple would be too tart, but it was perfect. I also added 1/2 cup of oats.

This would be great served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and some type of sauce - like a pecan carmel sauce or something. although just by itself is fanastic!!! definiely a keeper. thank you!

I also doubled the recipe and made a 9x13" pan.  I thought these were a little too sweet.  Most recipes for baked goods include at least a small amount of salt, and I wonder if that would have cut the sweetness a bit.  I don't think I would make these again and will search for a different apple recipe.

I made these to bring to work and they were a success!  I doubled the recipe using a 9x13 pan, I made with 1c white sugar & 1c brown sugar.  I used Macintosh & Granny Smith apples and used 1c of raisins instead of walnuts.  Once you get the apples peeled, everything else is so fast & easy!  Thanks!!

This recipe is fantastic. It is so very easy and quite delicious. I read the other reviews and disagree with the problem of "doneness." First, use the correct type of apple. I have used two different types with no problems. I doubled the recipe and baked in a buttered 9x13 baking dish for 40 - 45 minutes, let cool, then cut into bars. Both times I have made this, it has come out wonderfully. My family loves them, my neighbors love them. This recipe is a winner and will stay in my recipe box. Thank you!

I drizzled a little caramel sauce over batter before baking but other wise stuck to the recipe exactly. My oven required approximately 10 more minutes cooking time. Big hit in my house....delicious and easy!!

I used the caramel sauce (with rum) as a topper and the two of them together were AMAZING and a huge hit! I made the following modifications: halved the sugar (a common modification I make to all baking recipes which makes them better in my opinion - plus had a plenty-sweet caramel sauce topping), added cinnamon and a dash of clove. My boyfriend had thirds!

This was very easy to make and quite tasty too. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and still found it to be very pleasant. I didn't add walnuts, for spices I used for cinnamon and nutmeg. Will definitely keep this one in my recipe box. I'm sure my colleagues will enjoy these bars very much when I share it with them too.

Made it four times this Fall, twice it was doubled and it came out perfectly delicious as written. Not sure why folks are having trouble with the consistency. I've used Granny Smith, Golden Delicious, Ambrosia, and ... not sure what the last kind of apples were ... always delicious! Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

I'm wondering now if I can make it with Peaches .... hmmm ...

Very good.  More cake like, which we liked.  Good flavor and easy to make.  I will use this recipe often.  My husband is not fond of strong cinnamon flavor, so I did reduce the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon and they were perfect for us.

My family and I loved the apple bars.   The boys are not fans of nuts.  So I left the walnuts out.  But topped it with caramel sauce.

These are okay. They taste pretty good, but they don't even compare to the Apple Squares on this site. I can tell they are a modification of that recipe.

Perfect Recipe. I added 1 TBS ground Flax seed for extra health benefits! I think it was more of a coffee cake than just a bar recipe. It was wonderful. Thanks for the Recipe!

Flavor is fantastic, but bars didn't come out so solid, hence less stars. Maybe I should've cooked longer? But wouldn't that have sacraficed moistness? I took some suggestions and decreased sugar by 1/2 the amount & substituted brown sugar for the rest. Also, I added raisins and oats.

As an 8 inch square pan is to small for my family I made 1 1/2 of this recipe.  I used two eggs and a little extra flour.  This was cooked in a 9x13 pan and was just right. Good recipe.  My family liked it.

Very good. It is more like a cake not like a bar at all. I didnt see the finely chopped apples. You have to cut them fine or your cake will break apart. I read some reviews first and I did add a little vanilla and more apples. All in all I would make this again.

Delish. Just a few changes. Used half white and half brown sugar, used apple sauce instead of butter and added 1/4 tsp more cinnamon.  Sooo good!  Thanks a million!!

We really enjoyed these bars! - added a bit more apple (1/4 c.) and used fresh Cortland apples since those were on hand. I used about 1 tsp. cinnamon and also 2 tsp. of apple pie spice. I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13" pan. My husband can't eat nuts, so 1/2 cup of dark raisins were used to add another flavor. We were very pleased with them, ate them with a fork like a cake, but certainly these apple bars had enough body to eat like a snack - by hand. This recipe is a keeper for us. Thanks S. Powell for the recipe!

These have become a favorite - both around our home and to have for others. They're so easy, delicious and such a pleasant surprise to guests. I haven't met anyone that doesn't like them.

Popular hit at my house.  Used Granny Smith and Gala Apples.  Increased the apples to 3 cups.  Moist cake that only had a small amount left.

These turned out great!  I will definitely make these again.  I used Granny Smith apples as others suggested.  I let the bars cool and didn't have any trouble with them falling apart.

I didn't have any walnuts or pecans on hand so I decided to add crushed Cinnamon Life cereal right before baking.  It was AMAZING!  The cereal added much needed texture and crunch plus an extra kick of cinnamon. Try it!

This turned out very good.  I added some quick cook oats & vanilla extract before I added the apples & nuts.  And cooked it just a couple of minutes longer then the suggested.  My hubby loved them & wants me to get vanilla ice cream to go w/them next time I make them.

This was good, but a little bland and sweet.  I used 3/4 nuts and 1 1/2 c. apples.  Next time I will add some nutmeg and use 3/4 c. sugar using brown sugar for more flavor.

Super recipe.  I added nutmeg, coconut and applesauce which made it very moist.  It turned out more like a light and fluffy cake.  Also drizzled melted butter, honey and coconut into small holes I made on the top of the cake.  The family loved it.

I was really disappointed.  Even after greasing and flouring the pan, it stuck to the bottom and TOTALLY  fell apart.  The taste isn't bad, just a little bland.  I don't like nuts so I omitted the walnuts and added a brown sugar crumb topping, I was still expecting it to be better.

My dad liked them, my mom, not at all, everyone else, somewhat. They said that it was too moist, which could be my fault, cuz I added extra apples. They're not bad, but I don't think I'll make them again.

I made this recipe for a festival at my college and it was loved by all! Everyone was raving for it, and would come to my stand saying "I am supposed to try the apple bars".  It was great! Totally a hit.  I followed the  recipe almost exactly (I made it vegan) and it took a little longer to bake then the 40 minutes called for.

This is one of my most favorite recipes off this site.  I make often because I always have these ingredients on hand.  They are great as a weeknight dessert as you can make them while suppers cooking and as a dessert to take to a shower or potluck.  They taste awesome served warm with vanilla icecream!

Made these today and they turned out pretty well.  A little on the moist side, but not overly so.  Will be making these again :)

Whoever is not getting a solid bar out of this recipe must just be .  I made them and they turned out wonderfully!  I bake all of the time and friends tell me its the best thing i have ever made!  If they turn out too soft, you should let them cool longer before trying to put them onto the cooling rack

These are just perfect! I followed one reviewer’s mistake and on purpose switched the baking soda for baking powder since we like chewy bars. Also left out the walnuts and added 1/2 rolled oats. They hold together well and are moist and chewy, not cake like, and not too sweet. Kids and adults can’t stop eating these!

I made this for dessert for a couples game night with my friends and it was a hit. I only made a few changes, 1/2 cup of sugar and I used pecans and Gala Apple's. Its also delicious warm with vanilla ice cream. Bake it a little longer to get it crisp or use a cookie sheet instead of pan.

I have tried this recipe several times for different occasions, and people loved it, especially those who aren't sweet tooth! Adding raisins make the taste and texture better. Using 1/2 cup apple sauce instead of butter works well. I've added oats once, but I guess it was too much and it turned to be crumbling. If I try with oats again, I'd add only 1/4 or 1/3 cup. Thank you for sharing such a pretty healthy and super easy recipe!

Didn't have any Granny Smith apples but did have Braeburn and won't use them again.  Extremely moist almost soggy in fact . Followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed with the results but feel it was the apples that is the problem.

I loved these apple bars.  I followed the recipe except I used a heaping cup  of finely diced apple and added a bit of vanilla.  I also iced with a thin layer of frosting.  I know I will make this recipe again and again.

I made this recipe using Granny Smith apples because they're my favorite. I also cut him up a little bit bigger chunk that I'm really teeny one I wanted chunks in it then I added some five spice to the recipe instead of only just cinnamon it came out great.

This is like a cake, not a cookie.  Turned out pretty good. After reading many reviews, I made some changes. I added about 1-1/2 c. finely chopped apple (MacIntosh).  Instead of 1/2 c. butter, I used 1/4 c. and 1/4 c. applesauce. Instead of 1 c. white sugar, I used 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar. I added a couple of tablespoons of quick-cooking oats, a dash of salt, a small splash of vanilla. I also added a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cloves. I omitted the walnuts and added a couple handfuls of raisins. I sprinkled some brown sugar on top before baking.  Baked for 30 minutes. Drizzled with a glaze made of powdered sugar, cinnamon and milk.  (Yeah, I know, I pretty much made a different recipe!)

delicious recipe after I made some of the recommended suggestions.  I used baking powder versus baking soda, and I doubled the amount of apples.  I also added a pinch of nutmeg.  Lots of flavor, but more of a cake than a bar.  Will make again!

AMAZING! I am amazed by these apple bars. Well actually, its more cakey than bar cookie...Maybe thats just me, I've never had luck with these. But wow! This somehow, tastes ALOT like carrot cake. Go figure! No carrots! I didn't have walnuts so I substituted 1/2 cup of oats and 1/2 of raisins. For apples, Macintosh. To top it off, buttercream frosting with carrot shavings to decorate!

This recipe is amazing! My only problem was that the bars came out more cake-like than dense bars. They tasted amazing though! I substituted the walnuts for pecans and my husband and I ate them with butter pecan ice cream.

I am an experienced baker; I followed this recipe carefully and was not pleased at all with the results. The consistancy is not muffin-like or cake-like, in all honesty they tasted greasy and burnt. I am still looking for a recipe for apple bars that is moist and delicious

I loved these bars. I did substitute the butter with a half cup of olive oil for baking, and used a little less than two thirds cup suger, and upped the chopped apples to one and a half cups.  So easy and so very good. I will make them again, thats for sure. Thanks for the recipe.

These were easy and very good.  I doubled the recipe as others suggested and used a 9x13 pan and was glad I did!

These are really good & easy to make.  I doubled the recipe & it was gone within a day!  Would use more apples next time.  Texture reminds me more of apple muffins- without the mess of making muffins!  Will definately make these again & again.  They were loved by kids & adults.

Awesome. I used 2 cups of apples diced, kept everything else the same. SO yummy! My very picky three year old loves this "cake" - and she's eating her fruit! Can't wait to try it warm with ice cream. A definate favorite.

Ditto with what many others have said.  Used macoun apples but I think Granny Smith would have been better.  Used 1/2 brown sugar, and double the apples - good suggestions.  Again, more of a cake than a bar, but held it's shape when cut into squares.  Best thing about this recipe?  Simple, easy.  My 4-y.o. helped me make it.

Great recipe. Will put more apple pieces in  the batter next time though. I didn't have any nuts on hand, so I added caramel toffee pieces to give it a little crunch. There are a lot of different variations and substitutes!

This recipe is great.  I followed it exact but with a little extra cinnamon and no nuts dont like nuts.  It was quick easy and not to mention delicious.  I put a glaze on it.  I just took powdered sugar and some milk and drizzled it over the top.  It calmed my sweet graving.  I give it 5 stars

These were more cake like than dense bars as expected.  They were very delicious though.  Very light, fluffy with the right amount of taste.  I doubled the recipe, and used 1 c. brown sugar, 1/2 c. white sugar.

I thought I'd done something wrong when I put the batter in the pan to cook because the consistency seemed weird, but they came out great!  Easy use of on hand ingredients.

I just made these for the first time and I loved them. My family couldn't stop saying how good they were. I even brought some to work and everyone loved them! The only thing I did different was to take out the walnuts and add raisens instead. This is a very good recipe and I will make it again!

I have to agree with another member who said that the bar wouldn't hold together. I thought maybe I did not cook it long enough. But either way, it was absolutely delicious. I did add a dash of nutmeg. Thanks for the recipe!

Lovely. Basically an apple cake. I read all of the reviews before making it, so I felt safe putting in more apples than called for (I used one Rhode Island Greening and one MAcoun for about 2 cups apple) and leaving out about 1/4 cup sugar so they wouldn't be too sweet. Baked them in an 11" pan (couldn't find an 8") and they came out delicious. Note the serving size - in an 8" pan that 186 calories is only a 2" square! Plan your diet accordingly! LOL

Works well with Fuji apples (since they are the most widespread variety here in the Philippines- and cheap too) smelled terrific, I'll be serving this for Christmas!

Very easy to make.  Added 2 cups of apples instead of the nuts and it turned out very moist.  Kind of crumbly - you have to eat with a fork but still delicious.

Excellent!  This is a great apple recipe.  The only thing I changed was the apples.  I used macintosh and instead of finely chopping then I cut them into nice sized chunks.  It was awesome.  My husband loved it.  I will be making this one a lot!  By the taste you would never know how easy they are to make!

These were a HIT!  I used some honeycrisp apples that I picked up at the orchard and instead of the ground cinnamon, I threw in some Hershey's cinnamon chips.  Great results.  Thanks much!

I gave the kid friendly rating a 4 instead of a 5 as I found that my teens and inlaws liked the bars the best. I took them to a get together and some one topped them with some whipped cream.
Yum.
