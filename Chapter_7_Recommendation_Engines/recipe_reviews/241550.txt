Came together quick. I pan fried the chicken and combined quick frozen thighs and breasts and seasoned them. (I like more seasoning for the chicken) I added garlic powder to the soups/mayo mix.  400 degrees was too high for my oven - did 400 for 25 min, then deceased to 350 for 10 min - came out steaming and tasty!
