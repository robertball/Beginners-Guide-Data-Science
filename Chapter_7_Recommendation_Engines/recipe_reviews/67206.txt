Very good, but I did change it a little.  I forgot to put the honey on there (will definitely do that next time), but added cinnamon, ground vanilla, and brown sugar.  I also just cut them in half and put a pat of butter in the hole of each pear.  Served with homemade vanilla bean whipped cream!  Delish!

OK loved this... I made my own lil creation.  I did the pear like it stated melted 2 sticks of butter 1/2 cup of brown sugar and lil bit of white and a lil bit of real vanilla heated it up in the microwave.  I used 12 pears I picked from the orchard yesterday each pear got 2 big spoon fills over each.  put in the oven at 350 for 1/2 hr.  Basted each with it's own sauce then mixed some fresh raspberries with some water and sugar in the blender and each got 2 spoon fills back in the oven for 30-45 min.  OMG, this was such a hit the whole apartment was like what's that and everyone wanted some, but my biggest person to please is my 13 yr old child.  HE LOVED IT ate 3 big pears, once it was cut up....

This is tasty, but I altered it substantially.  I combined honey, white wine, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon and a black tea bag and cooked until wine reduced.  The added flavor of black tea gives a nice herbal quality to the dish.

Everyone thought this was tasty. I used bartlett pears. There is no need to melt the butter in advance. I cut the pears in half and cored them and stuck the butter and brown sugar in the hole, drizzled honey all over and liberally sprinkled both ginger and cinnamon. I cooked it covered for an hour and thought it turned out perfectly. Very juicy and the house smelled like honey during the cooking. MMMmmmm....:-)

My boyfriend and I enjoyed the pears, but I felt the recipe was lacking. The pears were still crunchy after an hour and the specified amount of honey and butter didn't give enough syrup to continue basting it through the cooking. The flavor was nice, but nothing too intense. The sauce that was left was REALLY good over ice cream and I'm going to try to make some kind of ginger, cinnamon syrup for ice cream in the future. I may make this again because it tasted pretty good, but only if I happen to have a few pears laying around. I wouldn't go out of my way to make this.

I know it wasn't intended as a dessert but that's how we had it and it was great.  My changes were to use fresh ginger because that's what we use in our house and I sprinkled some raw cashews on for a bit of crunch.  The pears melted in our mouths for a sweet, yet light finish.  Thanks!

This was very good and as it said very elegant.  My family would have turned up their noses at the lavender flowers, so I left them off.  I couldn't find the pears it called for so I just regular ones.

Yum, I loved this!  I love pears, and I've wanted to try this forever.  I finally made it tonight, but I didn't make four pears--only 2, bc bf just doesn't share my same love for pears.  He likes them, but isn't as enthusiastic.  I had a little trouble coring the pear from the bottom--I broke the first one by trying to cut up too far, but on the second one I had better luck.  I just cut in a circle and removed the core with my fingers.  Anyway, I didn't bother melting the butter either, and added more honey (didn't really measure, just poured on).  I added cinnamon as well.  Baked perfectly in an hour. The syrup is definitely delicious, and the pears were delicious with it.  Bf and I shared a pear so we'll have the other one tomorrow.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  I don't know what else to say!  These are a flavorful dessert that looks very elegant and could definitely be gourmet looking!  I took the advice of another reviewer and added a little brown sugar, splenda and vanilla to the butter and honey mixture.  I cooked this for 30 minutes and then added a raspberry topping like the same reviewer.  Use raspberries, a little water and splenda, blend them together and cook another 30-45 minutes.  I am intending to invite over my in-laws and serve this for dessert.  A new and easy favorite that I will definitely put into a regular rotation!  Thanks!

I thought it was absolutely delicious. it didn't taste too sweet and I felt a little better about having it for dessert rather than a piece of cake. It was the dessert to my cornish game hen and it did not dissappoint. My husband thinks I am a professional chef when I bust out the recipes from this site. Thank you :)

I sliced the pears and arranged them in a circle in a pie plate, then put a whole one in the center. It turned out very pretty! I prefer margarine over butter for a milder taste, and I just mix the ginger into the liquid for ease. Very tasty!

Very good and easy to make.  I don't know why the intro says it's not a dessert because it's not a side; too sweet.

This was "lick the plate" good!  I made 7 pears.  I nuked 1 stick of butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 t vanilla and cinnamon..   Then, spooned it over the pears and baked at 350 for 1/2 hour.  Then spooned liquid over pears again and put under the broiler for about 10 mins or until a little charing  starts to form.

Serve warm or at room temperature.

A simple dessert that doesn't draw too much attention to itself. Not bursting with flavor, but mild, sweet, and buttery, which paired well with French Vanilla ice cream. We served the pears whole, not arrayed as in the photo. Our guests especially commented on the richness of the butter, which came through at least as much as the sweetness of the fruit and honey. One guest is considering it for their Thanksgiving table, which we took as a sign of success. Next time, I might add just a little cinnamon.

Absolutely LOVED this. After coring from the bottom I filled each pear with butter. I didn't have ginger so I sprinkled cinnamon on at the end. Easy, delicious and beautiful.

Turned out great but substituted ginger with amaretto liquor. After 50 minutes, removed foil and drizzled honey and a little white sugar. Then broiled for 5 minutes. Delicious!!

More lavender gives it an interesting and exotic flavor.  I made it twice in two days.  For a bit of taste difference to go with turkey, I added some walnuts and blue cheese the last five minutes of cooking.  I cut a pear half into slices for each serving with the sauce spooned over it.

I didn't do much measuring with this. Pealed, pitted and halved the pears. Put a little spoonful of honey, tab of butter, and sprinkles of ginger and cinnamon on each half. Baked at 375 for an hour. Pears were light, sweet and delicious. We had them with a small scoop of gelato. I could see a less sweet cream being a great compliment, or an airy pastry. Super tasty, super easy. Probably will make a pear crisp with this too.

My pears were a little soft, so it was difficult to make them stand up. The second time I just cut the pears into differently sized pieces and cooked it that way. I found it much easier and just as delicious!

Very good- easy to make - I didn't have much juices to baste with so maybe next time I would use more butter and honey- love how the ginger tasted on it- Not too sweet and was very good!  I made this as a side to quiche.
