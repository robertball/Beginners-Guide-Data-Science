We really enjoyed this; it was easy to make as well with common ingredients. I used the Italian Dressing Mix recipe by Debby from this site. I only had shredded mozzerella on hand, so that is what I used. I would suggest using sliced, but the shredded worked in a pinch, it just wasn't as "thick" as I would have liked it. Thanks Darla for a new chicken recipe that I will definitely make again (perhaps on the grill come summertime)!

I make a similar recipe but with spinach and everyone loves it.  I marinate the chicken in robust italian dressing.  Fry in pan, then put the roasted red peppers, cooked spinach, and moz cheese on top.  Cover in pan until cheese melts.  Quick and delicious!

I'm giving this recipe five stars because I think it would be heavenly if not for my mistake.  Make sure you get roasted red peppers in water NOT in brine.  Way to salty and vinegary for my taste when combined with the Italian dressing.

Thanks for a great recipe, Darla!  My husband and I both enjoyed it very much.  It was simple and fun to make.  For the marinade, I used bottled Kraft Zesty Italian Dressing.  It worked so well that I plan to use it again next time because of the intense flavor.  I wish I could give your recipe more stars, as it truly was delicious and easy to prepare.  

Again, thanks a bunch!

Good quick recipe. It also works without marinating the chicken if you use thin sliced chicken breasts and monterrey jack, colby or cheddar cheese.

I make a similar recipe I made up myself. I do not use dressing. I pan fry chicken tenders in olive oil with Cavender's greek seasoning on them in a cast iron skillet. When done I add one jar of roasted red peppers (in water), half a package of grape tomatoes cut in half and  mozzarella cheese all over the top. Place cast iron skillet in the broiler and broil until all is cooked through and cheese is golden brown. Awesome.

I used 6 chicken breast halfs but kept the rest of the proportions the same. Used shredded mozarella because that is what I had. Very flavorful. I put the reduced sauce on the side for people to spoon on top if they wanted. Some liked it with extra sauce, some without.

This was a very easy dish to make. I used thin sliced chicken breast because that was what I had on hand. I used the home made dressing recipe mentioned in one of the reviews. I seared the chicken pieces in an iron skillet and then broiled them in the skillet. Next time I will plan ahead and marinate the chicken a little longer.

Followed the directions but it had a very vinegary taste to it.  Maybe it was the dressing (paul newman's italian) I used but it really wasn't very good.
