We love pearl/Israeli couscous, this is absolutely delicious, and I wouldn't change a thing.  I had some chicken broth in the fridge, so I replaced part of the water with the broth.  For me, the fresh mango and the chopped peanuts really brought this alive.  Thanks rinabeana for a winner recipe.

This recipe is a keeper.  It has a flavorful fruity taste and gives you the fulfillment of a starch.  If you're tired of always making rice and potatoes, this is a great variation.  I served it  with salmon, and it was perfect.  I didn't have a mango so I used a nectarine instead.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.

This  was not a big hit with family.  Flavors were okay but not worth making again.

I have made this several times. I absolutely love this, my friends and family do too! It's also great served warm.

I did not know if couscous was pre cooked so I put 1&1/2 cups dry couscous into this recipe and very dry. I added more water than the 2 1/2 cups. It then became mushy.

This is not your grandma's fruit salad! Not only is this delicious, it's got surprise value since no one I know expects much flavor from 'fruit salad' beyond what a pile of melons and pineapples can deliver.  The pearl couscous adds a wonderful mouth-feel--so much so we're keeping it on-hand in our pantry from now on!
