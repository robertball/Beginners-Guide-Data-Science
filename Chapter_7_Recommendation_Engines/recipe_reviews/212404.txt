I made this after I purchased a package of soft tofu and needed only half. It was quick and easy to make and tasted really decent. I used 1/4 cup of Splenda with 1/4 cup white sugar, so it is not true to the original recipe or completely vegan. I also used only the cocoa powder.   I would make this again!
