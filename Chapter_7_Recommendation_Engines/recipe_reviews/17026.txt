This recipe was just ok.  It took so long to make and made such a mess of my kitchen... and my family didn't like it as much as my original recipe.

I would recommend using more than one meat -- add ground beef and/or veal.  It makes a wonderful difference.  Shiitake mushrooms are okay in a fix, but dried Polish mushrooms cannot be paralleled.  If you can't find them at an import store, you can buy them on-line.

This is a time-consuming dish so you want it to be worth it. It tastes much, much better if you mix pork with ground veal, beef, or both.

The Polish name for these cabbage rolls, "golabki," means "pigeons" (because they resemble a pigeon breast). As a kid I had qualms about eating them because of this :) Now they're just delicious.

I suggest looking on youtube for tutorials on how to roll the cabbage (works best if you cut a triangle into the base of the leaf, so it's more pliable).
Smacznego!

loved it! my first experience with cabbage rolls, I used 1 large head of cabbage,and 1 1/2 lbs of pork, dried minced onion because I don't like how fresh onions crunch, ( I'm one of those people) tomato soup with my tomato paste for the sauce as I had drain all the water from the cabbage in my confusion and had very little to work with, and portabello mushrooms because that's what I had. I guess I altered it quite a bit. My husband and I ate it for 3 days and have craved it since Will be trying to duplicate it tonight. it is a lot of work and messy though! would give five stars but it needs more meat.

So glad I found this recipe. My mom always made traditional Polish meals but I never got her recipes. It tastes just like hers and everyone I've made it for loves it!
