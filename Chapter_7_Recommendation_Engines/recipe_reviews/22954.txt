I added salt and pepper and really liked this recipe. It's simple, but there was something about it that just appealed to me.

I baked for 45mins until tender on a cookie sheet with water @370F cut side down. Scooped it out in a bowl then added 3tblsp. butter and 3 tblsp of brown sugar mixed it well and served warm with chicken. Everyone loved it.

I am on the South Beach diet, so instead of molasses, I used sugar free maple syrup.  I was a bit more liberal with the butter and the syrup.  I also brushed the exposed cut edges of the squash with melted butter before baking.  My squash took 1 hour 10 minutes and came out perfect!  Yummy!

Neither my girlfriend nor I cared for this; we think the texture and flavor of  butternut squash would suit this recipe better.

This dish was okay, but needs a little something more. I've had a similar dish in a restaurant that added chunks of goat cheese for a little tang and variation in texture. I think that may make this a little better and more interesting.

This was great! My squash too longer to cook due to its size, about 1 1/2 hours. But the flavor was great. I would do this recipe again. My husband loved it. It's a keeper.

My boyfriend insisted there had to be a spaghetti squash recipe with maple syrup in it, and this one came the closest.  So we used maple syrup instead of molasses, and it was wonderful!  It was my first experience with spaghetti squash, and thanks to this recipe, it will not be the last.

We ususally cook small squashes and I was looking for something to zing it up but found the molasses tasted too stong in this recipe even the cinnamon came off with a bit of a bite.  If I was to ever try this again I might try the cook it first then add the flavors starting with a switch to Brown sugar and cut down of cinnamon.

Fantastic! I am 100% Italian and never tried this before. Better than any pasta dish I have ever made. My boyfriend and I feel completely in love with this dish and I can think of one hundred different ways to prepare it...new staple to my favorite meals! We were so amazed and it tasted so great first time, we totally forgot to take a picture!  Nect time...

Very nice flavor.  I substituted raw sugar for the molasses.  Even my picky eaters finished this without complaint.

I did not care for this recipe. I couldn't figure out how the molasses and butter was supposed to soak into the entire squash, the measurements are way too strong, and it just tasted salty. I won't make this again.

I did this in my InstaPot and it’s the only way I’ll ever make it in the future! Clean the outside of the squash, place whole into InstaPot and steam for 30 minutes on high pressure. Cut in half, remove seeds, and shred with fork. You can serve it with any sauce. I chose butter garlic sauce and roasted some veggies to accompany it. It was fantastic and done in under an hour!

It was great! I used olive oil instead of butter while cooking & then when I scrapped it out of the shell and it make spaghetti noodles, I pour a chicken & gravy sauce over it and it was wonderful. The leftover squash I ate with a little olive oil and Parmesan cheese. I am adding this to our family menus moving forward!

Ooh did not care for this recipe at all.  The smell was yummy but the taste was just not for me.
