Great recipe!  In Japan we call this yakisoba.  :)  Great idea to use ramen noodles.  I added some chicken to the dish -- saut√©ed the chicken strips first, then added onions, peppers, and finally tofu before adding the ramen noodles.  Also, tripled the recipe.  The mix of the two sauces makes a yakisoba sauce.  :)  Great job and thanks for sharing!

This was an easy lunch. I made sure to saute my tofu until it had color. I also added a little bit of sauce to the tofu before I added the noodles to give the tofu some extra flavor. I think overall this dish was a little too sweet for me - I might cut it with soy sauce or find a different brand of sauce to use that isn't so sweet next time.

It was really nice for lunch. I seasoned the tofu and fried it in the pan before slicing it. I fried it for about five minutes and then mixed it with the pepper and onion. The sauces makes it a little bit too sweet but still very enjoyable.
