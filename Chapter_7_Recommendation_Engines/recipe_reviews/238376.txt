We enjoyed making this recipe for my daughter's class instead of cupcakes.  Was a big hit with all of them as the platter came back empty! The candy filling are endless!

WHAT A FUN IDEA!!  I made regular Rice Krispie treats and then shaped them like sushi and added Swedish fish on top with Fruit by the Foot for the "seaweed."  Also made another variety with red hot cinnamon candies to look like the fish egg ones!!  Thanks for the inspiration!!

Fun to make and so good.  A nice change from regular crispy rice squares.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It's one I'll make again.
