This was very nice. I was just looking for a recipe to use up some dried cilantro. I haven't used marinades too much, and I'm not particularly a steak person, but I gave this a try. I used 3 New York strip steaks for this. They marinated for 3 or 4 hours before I grilled the first one. (I left the others sitting in the marinade for the next two days as I had the other steaks.) If it matters to others, it's worth mentioning that this is a bit thick for a marinade, and not too liquid. The flavor was a nice surprise (I've been disappointed by weak marinades before.) I just may make this again soon!

This recipe should read "Coriander - dried flakes" which is the same as Cilantro. You can buy the flakes in spice jars or bulk typically. Happy BBQ'ing!!

I’ve used this recipe exactly as written about a dozen times.  It couldn’t be easier and the results are amazing. I’ve used it for hanger steak, which comes out delicious and very inexpensive ($1.77 a pound) London broil for extraordinary  results.  It’s a bit hot from the pepper flakes so if you don’t want it too spicy, reduce it to 1 tablespoon teaspoon or even one half teaspoon.

This smelled so good while it was cooking! Our mouths were watering and it did not disappoint! I used ground coriander seed because that is what I had on hand. Our sirloin turned out very tender and the flavor permeated through the steak.

I halved the pepper flakes, and everybody seems to love it.  Anytime we have people over now they request this recipe!
