This is a good dish which can be made with many variations.  For those that are wondering, Ranch Style Brand Beans are made by a company called ConAgra.  They are pinto beans with a very light spicy sauce added to them.

I have made something like this for years and years. I brown the ground beef then add a can of Campbells Tomato soup (its the best flavor      1 tsp. oragano,1/2 tsp. basil, 2 bay leaves,     1/8 tsp. pepper and 1/2 tsp. salt. Cook for about five minutes to thicken a bit then add veggie of choice I like the beans,but my recipe was peas or carrots, and sometimes corn. I serve it over mashed potatoes and sometimes rice.

Quick, easy, inexpensive and delicious! My four favorite words for dinner. My nephew and his buddy stopped by just about dinner time the other night. OH NO, I'm thinking...two really healthy appetites! Instead of wondering if I had enough food for everyone, I just thawed 2# of ground beef in the microwave and finished this meal on the stove. I added a tablespoon and a half of Taco Seasoning from this site to kick it up a notch. Both guys loved it, and the best part, I knew they didn't go away hungry. Very Quick, Very Easy, and Very Delicious.Thanks Hallie!

I served this over corn bread. This made alot for my family of three. We had leftovers, that were even better the next day.  My two year old son even liked it!  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

This was a pretty good recipe, but it needed a little added to it to make it better.  I sauted the beef with some garlic and onion.  I added 1 can of tomato paste to give it a base and then seasoned it with adobo seasoning, more garlic(can never have too much right!), and chili powder.  Then I added cheddar cheese on top.

This was very quick and inexpensive but was a little bland.  It's almost like a chili but without the seasoning.  A packet of chili mix or even tomato sauce would really make it better.

I think this recipe made as-is would be horrifically boring, so I added taco seasoning (using Taco Seasoning I recipe on this site) to the beef after I drained the grease. I used 2 cans of ranch beans, so I'm not sure how many cups that was, but it seemed right. We ate this over mashed potatoes, but I think it would have been better over cornbread. My husband thought it was much more tasty with a drop of sour cream on top. Next time, I think I would make this using chili beans in sauce instead of the ranch beans because you really can't get any easier than this for a quick dinner.

This is a quick, hearty and tasty dish.  I love it because you can mix and match ingredients, depending on what you have on hand.  I added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning when browning the ground beef, and sprinkled shredded cheddar on top when serving.

Super easy! I rated this four stars because I found it a tad bland as written, but a few added touches dials this up to a 5-star dish.

I sautee fresh onion and garlic before browning my meat, then deglaze the pan with a mix of water and worcestershire sauce to scrape up the yum bits. I season the meat with salt and pepper before dumping in the corn and beans. Fresh corn right off the cob in season is a nice touch. Garlic powder, more worcestershire to taste, and a bit of cayenne if you like it spicier kicks this up nicely. I serve over rice as suggested. This will go in the rotation for no-fuss nights. Thanks for sharing!

We enjoyed this. I did add some ketchup and taco seasoning as well as cooked the meat with diced onion.  I served over waffle fries and will probably make it again. Nothing fancy, but quick and hearty.

This was so good! I added peas, carrots, and green beans and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. After browning and draining the meat, I added a can of tomato soup and some seasonings. Turned out great, everyone scarfed it down!

I made this because of lack of "better" meals to throw together on grocery day, and it's become a family favorite. My 3 year old gobbles it up. (If you don't want to spend $1.50 on a can of ranch beans, pinto beans are half the price and just as good in this recipe with a little sprinkle of taco type seasonings.)

This was so good but a made a few adjustments...While I browned my meat I added half an onion and some powdered garlic and seasoned salt. Then I added a can of roasted chopped tomatoes (undrained) with the corn and beans. Boy was this a good blend of sweet and tang with the beef and the crunch of the corn. I'll make this again.

The recipe by itself is pretty bland, but after adding some chili powder, garlic powder, and salt and pepper it just popped. I served over corn bread and even my picky 7 year old ate it all.

I used the cowboy hash and put it inside of dough to make something similar to a bierock. I used a pizza crust recipe for a crunchy bread layer, which turned out REALLY well. I seasoned the meat with garlic salt, pepper, chili powder and then added diced tomatoes with jalapenos. I tried to add some cheese but you wouldn't be able to tell by the taste so next time I'll probably just leave it out.

This was great. I tweaked it and doubled it, so I used 2 lbs of ground beef, 1 can of Ranch Beans, 1 can of Black Beans, 2 cans of Sweet Corn and 2 cans of diced or stewed tomatoes. I added 1 tablespoon each of chili powder and cumin, some ground up garlic, salt and onion powder. Served it over rice and it was a big hit.

Super fast to cook; ready in 30mins or so. I added an onion, a can of green chilies, and a packet of low sodium taco seasoning. Will definitely keep this one in recipe rotation since it's a good, quick meal.

My family LOVES this recipe and I am giving this 4 stars only because I made several changes to accomodate our family's taste.  I add in a small onion and a clove of garlic to the ground beef when cooking.  I also add in an 15 oz can of tomato sauce as well as some cumin and also some cilantro. Finally, I replace one of the cans of ranch-style beans with a can of black beans.  We serve this over rice as suggested. Such an easy meal that can be made ahead of time and reheats well.

I'm really sorry to do this but this was just awful.  My family and I took one bite, looked at each other, spit it out and went out to eat.  It was just REALLY bad and I followed the recipe exactly.

I tried this recipe on a day when I found my whole freezer had defrosted and the only meat I had left to use was ground beef!  It was very easy to make and my whole family enjoyed it.  I used chili beans and 1/2 a pack of taco seasoning, as suggested by some others and served it over corn muffins.  It's especially good with American or cheddar cheese melted on top.

This is a wonderful recipe that is inexpensive, quick and makes a very tasty meal.  What I really like about this recipe is that I almost always have the ingredients listed in my freezer and pantry.  We added the taco seasoning others mentioned along with some added onions, garlic and Tony Chachere's seasoning.  I will also add some cilantro and cumin next time and perhaps put some cheese out in case anyone wants to sprinkle some on. Thanks Hallie!

Super easy, super quick - easy to modify based upon what you already have in your fridge/pantry. My family, all boys who EAT, loved it.  The little guy actually ate two bowls, served over whole wheat rotini and wanted some for breakfast the next day!

This dish does seem a little bland.  I didn't have any beans so I put in tomato soup as suggested by other people.  I also added corn and peas, basil, italian seasonings, salt, pepper, and seasoning salt and still felt in needed some more pazzaz.  I served it over boiled potatoes, it was tasty and simple, just in need of more flavor.

Cheap and easy, and the leftovers were good to heat up for lunch the next day.  I used Knorrs chicken rice to mix in with it and I used kidney beans instead of ranch style beans.

I only gave this three stars because it's just "okay" and a bit bland without some modifications. I added in some tomato sauce and 2 Tbsp of Taco Seasoning to spice it up.  That seemed to do the trick. The kids liked it! They called it "soup," beacause I put in the juice from the canned corn.

I took my cues from other reviews and added garlic & cumin while browning the beef. I also decided to add cut up tenderized strip steak instead of ground beef, and a bit of tomato sauce. Like others have said, a good base but alone it leaves something to be desired.

This is a good hash BASE, but I would not desire to eat this as is for very long. My personal recommendation is to add some burrito seasoning, throw in some bacon, and finally, some potatoes. Wrap all of that up in a tortilla and thow some hot sauce on there. Shizzam!

This was an quick cheap meal. We had it over rice. My husband and son liked it. I gave it a 4 because there's really nothing special about it... but we all need these kind of meals sometimes to pull out of the hat!

I had some left over ground beef and was wondering what I could do with it. This was a great recipe. I added some tomatoe sauce and a little bit of water for a chili consistency. I can think of so many ways to use this with a little bit of tweaking. I served it over french fries topped with American cheese for an out of the ordinary treat. I think next time i'll put it on hot dogs when i'm craving junk food.

I really enjoyed this a lot! I was impressed with how easy/quick it was and how it made a LOT! I also think it tasted great! The 3 kids I served it to only picked at it though, they didn't love it. I added half a pkg. of taco seasoning when I browned the beef. Then the 2 cans of corn and 2 cans of chili beans.  I served it all over rice, and sprinkled it with shredded cheddar. Lots of leftovers for ME! :)

What a wonderful base to add too! I only had a few minutes to make enough to feed both my parents and my boyfriend. I needed something fast and filling. I browned the beef and then added the taco seasoning per suggestion. I also added some seasoned cream style corn and drained black beans. I then uncovered a can of diced tomatoes that had garlic and onion added. I allowed it to simmer for about 10 minute and then added about a half a can of tomato sauce to make it a bit juicier..I brought to a light boil and allowed it to simmer for about 3 minutes. I served over rice and it was a hit!! Thanks Hallie!!

Thank you thank you thank you Hallie for this recipe! This recipe was a Godsend for me when it was the day before payday and I had lots of essential cooking items missing from my kitchen i.e. milk, butter, eggs etc. I enjoyed the taste although I can't say the same for my kids. It was definately an easy meal to make with spare groceries.

as is i agree with others a bit bland,  I added chili powder tons of garlic powder, parsley a pinch of summer savory,some oregano paprika then with 1 lb of burger browned in seasonings I added a can of rinsed, drained black beans a can of texas style ranch beans, and a can of stewed tomatoes and a can of mexicorn.  I cooked it for 30 mins or so and let it set awhile while I made brown rice.  I loved it!  excellent!

I was given this same recipe (minus the oil, which is completely unnecessary) several years ago during a snowboarding trip.  Now, anytime I'm in need for a SUPER quick, super easy, super CHEAP meal (especially during vacation!), I throw this on the stove (or even the campfire)!  It's yummy!

This wasn't bad by any means-- it was very filling and easy to assemble.  However, I found it a bit tasteless.  I even added some taco mix to the recipe and it still was pretty bland.  I'll probably try this again soon.

VERY EASY! VERY CHEAP! ACTUALLY GOOD! I have to say, I had my doubts.  My dad loves these beans, so I made it for him, but everyone liked it.  We served it over sticky rice.

Wonderful! I wasn't sure what "ranch beans" were so I subsituted chili beans.  It was wonderful and very filling! Makes a huge dish!

I served it over buscuits and was loved by all

Good, cheap fast and plenty of food for a crowd. Excellent for college students! Also added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning with a little garlic.

This certainly is quick and easy.  I have never heard of ranch-style beans,so I used red beans in chili sauce instead.  I added the tomato sauce and some chili powder and it turned out fairly well.  My 20-month-old loved it.  Her dad and I both said we would give it another shot, with more spice added.

This was very quick and easy and was a hit with the whole family (except my picky 2 year old). I did add 1/2 packet of taco seasoning and some tomato sauce as suggested by some other reviewers.  Also, I had to use a can of drained black beans rather than the "ranch-style beans" that the recipe calls for.  Being from New England, there is no "ranch-style beans" in the grocery stores (what are they, anyway?)! I also had to add a bit of water to achieve the desired consistency.  Overall, a good quick recipe for when you're in a pinch for something hearty to feed the troops.

Extremely easy to prepare!  And the whole family loved it!  I'm a post-op gastric bypass patient, and even I enjoyed a tiny amount of this great dish!

My husband liked this. I served it with Jalepeno mashed potatoes. I also added a package of Lipton's Onion Soup Mix. Add a salad and it's an easy and complete meal.

Awesome recipe and very easy to add your own ingredients. I found that adding more corn and an onion then serving it over Frittos made it fantastic but next time I might get the Jalepeno Ranch Style beans instead of the regular.

very quick.  I halved the amount of corn, added a can of v-8, black beans, pinto beans, garlic, and onion.  Also good with smoked paprika and extra chili powder.  Serve over tortilla chips with cheese and sour cream.
