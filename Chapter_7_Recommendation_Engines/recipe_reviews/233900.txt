The taste was great, however next time I will make sure the coleslaw is really finely cut and that it is mixed and the tortillas are crisped before I cook the fish and cube it.  By the time I got the other stuff prepared, the fish was not very warm or crispy like it was when I took it off the stove and cut it up!

Tastes great. We added red wine vinegar and extra sugar to spice up the yogurt cole slaw.  We also added diced avocado and diced tomatoes to the tacos. Yummy.

Made these for Pinterest Faceless Frenzy November '13. We enjoyed them.  I baked the fish rather than frying. I used taco seasoning 1 recipe from this site. Only other change was to use finely sliced cabbage rather than coleslaw mix and I left out the sugar. These were tasty:) thx irvinetustin!

I loved the recipe. Only four stars because of pre fab tortillas. My only negative is why does everyone use those pre-fab tortillas? want to punch this up? Fry your own corn tortillas or use soft warm flour tortillas.Just be sure to have tortillas ready to fill before you fry fish or if baking fry while fish is in the oven. Those pre- fabs are disgusting! I Know the tortillas take time to do yourself and it is a bit tricky but with a little practice you can do it.
The fresher the tortilla the easier to handle. So if you don`t have a tortilla deli near you , when selecting corn tortillas try for the package that the tortilla will "flop" when held upright. Older ones are stiff. So worth the extra effort.

Coleslaw mix  is chopped cabbage & carrots you can buy, it's in the fruit/veggie aisle around the bagged salad mixes. Hope that helps and good luck!

I hadn't tried this using yogurt for the sauce and I have to say I like it much better!  It's healthier than sour cream that I've used in the past.  LOVE THIS - and so do my children!

I really enjoyed this. I do think it took me more than 15 mins prep time though. I agree with the earlier poster who suggested cooking the fish last. I also suggest filling the taco as it's being eaten, not in advance (put one together, eat, then put the next together) to avoid having them get mushy. We also liked it better putting the coleslaw mix in first, then the fish and tomatoes- it was more flavorful that way. Thanks!

This was actually surpriSingly good. The only thing I changed was I baked the tilaPia and I only had greek plain yogurt. My husband enjoyed it as well, would definitely make it again.

Very fresh and tasty. Will definitely make again. Make the coleslaw and season the fish way before since both just get better as the flavors  meld. I chose a hot and spicy taco seasoning with a generous shake of Old Bay added on the fish. I used Cod since I don't eat Tilapia. I added just a little sesame oil to the oil for additional flavor. Tomatoes had just a bit of  basil and garlic added. I like using soft flour tortillas flash warmed right on the gas range before assembly.

Its OK had to fix it and I made it so much better baking my fish instead of frying, using salmon and Ling cod instead of tilapia yuck,
used sour cream and added horseradish hot sauce and more lime along with old bay much better.

First time we ever had fish tacos in this house.  Made recipes exactly as stated.  Quite tasty.  My 12 year old wouldn't touch the coleslaw topping, so he just ate the fish and tomatoes in the taco shells.  We thought this recipe was tasty, healthy, and kind of "special".  Try it!

Delicious!  I did use non-fat yogurt, and added a couple shakes of red-wine vinegar and a little extra sugar to the slaw.  Some chopped tomatoes on top are great as well.  I also cut the tilapia into chunks before cooking to ensure all surfaces were coated with the taco seasoning.  Will try baking next time, as others have suggested.

The fish was kind of bland & I sprinkled it with garlic salt & the taco seasoning.  The creamy coleslaw was a nice twist.  I think I may marinate the fish next time.

Sooooo good! I don't like the Baja kind, so really happy with this. Also, I was able to freeze this (sauce separate from fish, add tomatoes later). Great freezer meal!

Amazing taste!! We didn't have yogurt, so we substituted sour cream. The lime, cilantro, and jalapeno mixed with the cabbage was very fresh and just like the fish tacos we had in Maui. I might add just a touch more jalapeno next time as we like slightly more heat. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow night!!

I made this with both chicken and fish. The chicken seemed to pick up the flavor a bit better than the fish. Fish is very good too! Cilantro lime sauce wasn’t my favorite this time. I used Greek yogurt to make it healthier and it was just too tangy. I tried adjusting it with other ingredients and just couldn’t get it to balance. Made before with sour cream and it was delicious.

Quick and easy dinner enjoyed by 3 adults. Used fajita seasoning in place of taco seasoning since that is what I had on hand. Any white fish will work well. We had cod fish on hand instead of tilapia and made it healthier by broiling instead of pan frying.

I used part of this recipe and another from this site, Fiery Fish Tacos with Crunchy Corn Salsa. I made two toppings. I did season the fish with taco seasoning  before searing in a iron skillet from this recipe, and I had some left over slaw, (my recipe calls for sugar and is sweet) I added chopped cilantro and lime juice to. I made the roasted corn from the other recipe, but mixed with bell pepper when roasting, then mixed in some diced red onion. chopped cilantro, and lime juice. I mixed a little of the slaw topping and the roasted corn topping with the fish. You do want to have your toppings ready for when you pull your fish, for you want to assemble quickly.

really good recipe.  We like spicy at my house so I added rotel tomatoes when cooking the fish (I used fresh tuna) with onions, garlic, slap ya mama seasoning, and pabalon pepper.  The coleslaw I added cumin and chopped up some pabalon pepper.  Very tasty!

Prepared exactly  as directed, family liked them. The title says "spicy" they were not spicy at all, next time I'll add a little more spice, sauce was a bit bland, kids were adding additional jalapeño and Frank's Red Hot sauce to accent the flavor. Super easy recipe!

I'm a fish lover but I don't care for tilapia so I used Mahi Mahi. I made these for my son who just came back from Okinawa - he's in the Marines. He loves fish tacos. After making these he came up with a little different recipe which he made for me. I had to admit his recipe was better. Thanks IrvineTustin.

I've enjoyed fish tacos in restaurants and this recipe came very close.  I had to use sole instead of tilapia because that's what I had.  I used soft tortillas & brocolli slaw because of preference.  However, the point of the recipe is the sauce for the slaw and that is what made these tacos so good. My son added some salsa but it wasn't needed in my opinion. I will make again.

This was delicious!  I took the advice of others and cooked the fish last to keep it crispy and added avocado at the end. The jalapeño gave a good amount of spice and we found Cholula hot sauce also was a nice addition to kick up the spiciness a bit without overpowering the other flavors. Will definitely make these again!!

Made as written, love the taco seasoning on the fish!
Sauce was just ok, I will play around with it next time to jazz it up a bit.  A keeper recipe!

I thought this was just OK. My friend liked it, but it didn't have the WOW factor. I followed the recipe to a T, but the coleslaw mixture seemed bland.

The slaw sauce could use a further kick. I added cumin and additional lime juice. I also used blackened seasoning in addition to the taco seasoning. We will definitely make again.

Loved it! Next time I will try the stand up tacos and the fajitas. It was very hard to place the fish and mixture into the traditional taco.

I pan fried the fish with creole seasoning. I used Greek yogurt which made the cole slaw too tangy. I'll try regular yogurt next time. Anyways it was great! Plan to make again.

simple, good tasting, and nutritious.  I followed recipe as it was given.  The only addition I would add is a little salt.  I was very happy with the plain yogurt base for the slaw.  I used Greek plain yogurt.

We did not care for this recipe. Something was definitely off-putting in the taste.

Wow I was so looking forward to a really great recipe based on reviews, but my husband and I were very disappointed.  This was easy, that's how it earned 1 point.  I wish I had used cabbage instead of lettuce as some reviewers suggested, using lettuce does not work well.  Also it is very bland, it needs more spice.  We tried to spice it up with Salsa Verde, but even that didn't help much.

Cut up my own purple cabbage, because I all ready had some. Used Mahi Mahi , and grilled it. Cut back on the taco seasoning by half.  It was excellent!

Allrecipes.com sent me this recipe, so I decided to try it for the family. It is delicious. I did not have any yogurt, so I substituted a mix of two big tablespoons of sour cream and one smaller one of mayo. Other than that I stuck to the recipe as written. The tacos tasted remarkably like the award winning Tacos at Flip Flops Restaurant which was featured on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives.

I didn't have yogurt or sour cream so I used mayo, thin sliced cabbage and let it set for some time, longer the better. The taco seasoning I used didn't have salt so I added Clasico seasoning which has salt and lime, and baked fish. soft tortillas and cheese...yum

I fixed this tonight and thought it was great for a summer evening dinner.  I don't like jalapenos, so added a little tiny bit of the taco seasoning to the cole slaw; that was a bad idea, so I tried to fix with a spoonful of mayo.  Seemed to help.  Set it all out with chopped fresh tomatoes.  Will do this again and make the dressing more like the posted recipe.  Well, I might tinker a bit, hard to stop myself playing around with a good base recipe.  Thanks for posting!
