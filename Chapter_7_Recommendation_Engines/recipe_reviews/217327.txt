My pre-baked pizza crusts were the small 8" thin crust variety, comes in a package of 4. Mixed cream cheese, ranch dressing and diced pickled jalapeno since I didn't have fresh. Instead of the bacon bits, I used pepperoni and didn't do the buttered bread crumbs at all.  I made up 2 of the pizza crusts and have more than enough of the mixture for the other 2 at another time.  We loved it!  Jalapeno poppers are my DH's favorite snack food, next to pizza and now you've gone and combined the two!  Accept my sincere thanks!!!!

The filling was great but the topping destroyed it for us. Recommend using crumbled Ritz Crackers instead of the breadcrumbs.

This was good, and hubby LOVED it! I used 'New York Italian Pizza Dough' from here for the crust and made a 14-inch pizza. I used diced jarred jalapenos (did not measure amount used) and also added on some cheddar that I had left. I did not use all the breadcrumbs called for, but more of just a sprinkling. This was fun for  something different, and I would make it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Fantastic!!! Admittedly, I did skip the butter/bread crumb topping because it just didn't sound appealing. Made a batch of Quick and Easy Pizza Crust from this site for the crust. Cut it into squares and served as an appetizer. Everybody loved it; it was gone very quickly! It really is yummy and I'll make it again soon. Thanks :)

This was so good.  My family really enjoyed it.  I used 2 pre cooked flat breads and it was just perfect!! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This would have been stellar had we not gotten the hottest jalapeno I've ever eaten. I LOVE hot things. Eat it all the time. Use jalapenos cut up as a salad topping. However, this pepper had tears running down my face, my nose running, drooling... it was not a good look. But the pizza would have been great had we gotten normal peppers instead of the freak of nature ones we seemed to purchase!

Nice! We had to kick it up a notch and add jalapeno powder because the fully seeded and diced peppers didn't have enough. I used the ranch spice mix recipe from this site, and enjoyed it quite a bit - will definitely make this again!

I made this for my husband because he loves poppers. He loved this!  The only difference is that I used homemade pizza dough (which I precooked for about 10 minutes).  He wouldn't change anything about the reciepe, so I won't either.

This was a very unique and tasty pizza.  The jalape√±os sure had some heat to them!  I also used 1/2 Mexican blend cheese and 1/2 cheddar cheese, just because it was what I had in the fridge.  I'd probably skip the breadcrumb mixture on top the next time I make this.  My husband wasn't a big fan of it, and neither was I, to be honest.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, CookinBug

This is such a great idea for a pizza!  I love making new different ideas for pizzas and this one was great!  The flavor was delicious!  The only thing I changed was only to use 1/3 of the ranch package to the cream cheese and it was plenty strong enough to give the pizza the ranch flavor.  I also made my own dough for the crust and decided to put it on the grill.  I wasn't for sure if I'd like the bread crumb topping, but it sure brought the pizza all together.  Thanks for this great recipe!  I will for sure make again, and will try it sometime making into appetizer squares.

The topping on this pizza is great.  The crust I used was not.  Crust aside - we really enjoyed this pizza and I will be making it again using a different bottom.  I think this would be very good with a homemade crust in a 13 x 9 pan and cut in squares as an appetizer.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Love this one !! We did not use the bread crumbs.  I'm not sure if I will or not next time. I'm thinking that panko would be a good addition if I do, Maybe the addition of a some crumbled cooked breakfast sausage would also be good.

I really loved this!!! I left out the bacon (i'm a vegetarian) and I left out the crumb topping (didn't have any bread crumbs), but other than that I stuck to the recipe.  This would make a great snack for a small get-together. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I added pepperoni to the toppings. This was a big hit for everyone but me. I was really disappointed with this pizza and thought it was dry and heavy. However, everyone else really enjoyed it so maybe it was just me. I probably won't make it again though.

This recipe is awesome! I love pizza and jalapeno poppers and the combination of the two is genius! However I only gave it three stars because its too much cream cheese and not enough bacon bits. I pre-cooked my own my pizza crust from a pizza dough recipe here called Pizza DoughIII by Phyllis. I cant use any other pizza dough or pre-cooked crust eva! Next time I will use four oz of cream cheese vs eight and maybe dbl up the bacon bits. The off brand is half the price of Hormel so it wouldnt cost anymore anyways. Also I used panko bread crumbs instead of seasoned bread crumbs because I didnt want to buy more bread crumbs since I already had some just sitting on a shelf. It probably gave it more crunch anyway and i love crunch. We will be making this again!

Amazing. Just like a jalape√±o popper except it‚Äôs pizza. The ranch really gives this flavor. I used a thin layer of the cream cheese so it wasn‚Äôt too gluey. I used four jalape√±os & added sausage because it‚Äôs how I make poppers. I cooked bacon & chopped it up. I did not use the crumb topping. The jalape√±os were still crunchy. If you want them more tender try parboiling them first.

Absolutely incredible pizza!  I made it just as the recipe suggested, except I cooked it in a Big Green Egg for that brick oven taste.  The best pizza I've ever tasted, bar none.
