This is by far the easiest recipe for this drink I have come across! I am a bartender, and have tried many different versions of this recipe, and this is the one I will stick to!
I would like to add one thing that I do not believe was mentioned in the directions. If you are bottling this for shooters, I suggest straining the finished product...I do so using a NEW pair of womens hose, this makes for a lot less sediments and your finished product is a lot less cloudy!
Also This is a great idea for Holiday gifts, we make up a batch of this,(with this recipe you will get about 10 bottles) put on homeade lables and finish with with a red bow tied around the neck of the bottle and pass them out to friends....they love it!

I made this lastnight for my husband's birthday party and everyone loved it!  I served it warm (kept it hot in the crock pot.) It was perfect on a cold Michigan November night and made the whole house smell incredible.  Instead of Everclear, I used Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum and exchanged 1/2 the white sugar with brown sugar. Great Recipe!

This is the best recipe I've come across for apple pie. We chill it and serve it as shooters at all our parties... everyone was pleased. The tastiest and most tolerable way to drink grain alcohol (everclear)!

I now prefer 2 cups of sugar instead of the 3 cups I've listed in the recipe.  There is plenty of sugar in the both the cider and juice.  Also, I buy my juice and cider in 1/2 gallon jugs.  I split the Everclear into the 4 jugs equally, then pour in the cooled mixture.

I have had this drink and think it tastes great.  Although, when I found the recipe, I also found out that Everclear (grain alcohol) is illegal in my state.  Is there any other options to use

This was really yummy. I followed the recipe exactly and tried it both warm and cold (I prefer it warm), very good! I'm going to try adding some different spices in with the cinnamon next time. I had a bunch left over after our party, so the next day I mixed it half and half with Vernor's Ginger Ale and OMG it was awesome.

I have been making "Apple Pie" for 7years now. I have tried many different versions and this recipe is good, however it is excellent if you do half white sugar and half brown sugar. Also throw in some whole cloves with the cinnamon sticks.I re-use my alcohol bottles.I just rinse them in hot water.I don't throw the cinnamon sticks away, I put one in each bottle.If you make another fresh batch then throw the cinnamon sticks away,otherwise you will get a moldy-musty taste.You can make "Apple Pie Ala mode" by adding 1 cup of Vanilla Vodka, I prefer "Absolute" Vanilla Vodka.The other thing that is not mentioned is you should let it sit for at least 2 weeks, the longer the smoother it will be.store in dark closet.

Made this for a super bowl party and everyone that tried it loved it. Made half the mixture without the alcohol so the kids could have some and it tasted just as good.

Very good for the Halloween Party. Beware, someone at my party couldn't taste the alcohol so they thought it was a nonalcoholic drink.

EXCELLENT!  The hit of the party.  I did reduce the sugar to 2 cups and used Captain Morgan spiced rum in place of Everclear.   I served in shot glasses and topped with whipped cream and sprinkled cinnamon on top.

Great for tailgating, floating (great way to make friends on the river), and Buffett concerts. Always have to leave some vigin for friends having babies. My variation is to use half light brown sugar/ half white sugar and a little vanilla.

This is a great recipe.  It is best if you use cane sugar and the McCormick cinnamon sticks work the best for some reason.  I let the juice, cider,sugar, and cinnamon sticks simmer for a bout 3 hours.  It's quite tasty!

Just made this for a Halloween party & everyone loved it!!  Couldn't get Everclear as it isn't sold in Washington but instead I used 100 proof Stoli Vodka.  I cut the juice & sugar in half & used an entire bottle of (750 mil) of the vodka & it was perfect.  Even those who don't like strong drinks didn't think it was too strong.

I love this,  however it is too sweet. I make it with 1 1/4 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar.  It allows the apple cider flavor to be prominent instead of the sweetness.  Amazing!

My in-laws have made this for years.  They make it in the late fall and put it on the porch to cool.  I have some in the fridge right now.  I might have to go and have some.  They can get it in one of the bars where they live in the Upper Pennisula of Michigan.

This was fantastic.  I made half a recipe for my daughter's wedding and it went so fast everyone kept asking for more.  Everyone wants the recipe too.  Fantastic and very easy!  Thanks for a great recipe.  My daughter says they're going to make some for Christmas gifts this year.

UPDATE:  I have since made this about 4 times, a full batch each time.  Everyone still talks about it and how good it was that has had it.  It's a staple in my liquor cabinet.  I don't change a thing in the recipe.  Substituting anything but everclear will give a different taste.  Like someone said, be warned, you don't know there is any alcohol in this and it will hit you like a truck.   
Thanks Dan for a great recipe.

We've been making this stuff for years.  We follow the same ingredients except we only use 1 cup of sugar and it is always sweet enough for us.   I recommend experimenting with the lesser amount and adding more as needed. Also, once we strain the mixture and divide into the separate bottles, we add a few extra cinnamon sticks to the final product.  The extra sticks really boost the cinnamon flavor as it blends over time, plus it looks nice when giving as gifts.  This is a standard for the holidays around our house and for all festive gatherings.  It honestly tastes like you are drinking apple pie.

Delicious!  It tasted like warm apple pie. I used ground cinnamon instead of the  cinnamon sticks.  Didn't have grain alcohol so I used vanilla vodka instead. It was a big hit.

HELLOOOO tipsy!! THis drink is awesome. I made a batch for my Thanksgiving and it was gone! I used one gallon of apple juice and 3 smaller contatiners of apple cider so I had a little more than 2 gallons of apple juice/cider. I also added a healthy splash of orange juice and some nutmeg, allspice, and whole cloves. A great recipe! I plan on bottling this for Christmas and giving it as a gift! Thanks for the recipe. Nice amount of booze for a party for about 30 bucks!

I took this to my office'sChristmas party last year. It's May and we're planning a summer party and people are going crazy asking me to bring this. It was the biggest hit at the party apparently. Too sweet for my taste, but, I'm the odd man out on this.

This stuff is fabulous. I had 12 pint mason jars, so I put about half of the mix in that & dispersed the Everclear. I gave them out as gifts to friends at a tailgate recently. I still had another gallon sans alcohol that I will safe for a later date. I made my mom a pint jar this weekend & instead of adding Everclear I tried Spiced Rum. This will be a regular winter drink for us!

I've made this recipe in the past and it's way too much sugar.  You can cut it down to 2 (or even less) cups, easily.  I also added a few dashes of pumpkin pie spice while boiling.  (Because, why not? )

this recipe is amazing.  captain Morgan spiced rum goes perfect with it.  use half the sugar it calls for and the other half use Brown sugar (blends the taste a lot better).  also serve it while it's hot (as it cools it loses the warm Apple pie feel)

I made it "virgin" so the kids could have some.  I added some caramel flavored vodka instead of ever clear for the adults.  The only other change I made was I halved the recipe.  I am taking a thermos full tomorrow when we go ice skating.

Excellent recipe, quick and easy.  I made a couple minor changes (local Hy-Vee was out of Everclear) and used Tuaca instead.  Since Tuaca is sweet I skipped the sugar which was a good thing as the sugar would have made it really sweet.  Also Tuaca is quite less in Alcohol - so I would added double and it turned out awesome.  Depending on your sweet tooth I would add what is called for, try it, add more until the sweetness is where you like it.

This is awesome. Tastes good hot, cold, and even room temp. Makes a huge batch - definately need a huge pot or even two of them. I used 150 proof everclear and only put in half the bottle. Served as cocktails and felt they were plenty strong.

I switched half the white sugar for brown, mainly because I ran out of white. And I used some cheap whiskey I had in the freezer... It turned out a lot better than I had even expected, great recipe

Just the recipe I was looking for! I halved everything and my batch made a gallon which I poured into the empty gallon container from the apple cider. I left the alcohol on the side because people are skeptical of Everclear (with good reason).  Doing this allowed people to see and control how much they were drinking. It also made the drink kid friendly. I also recommend adding caramel vodka for additional flavoring (or for less alcohol content).

I make this almost every year.  A few suggestions; first always chill the mixture before putting in the alchohol to prevent it from evaporating.  Second, this isn't a drink to make the day that you want to drink it; its best made at least a week in advance. Refill the jugs with it, and drop 3 cinnamon sticks in each and let sit in your fridge and shake it every couple of days. It will remove any taste of alcohol at all. I try to make mine 30 days ahead of time and it tastes perfect.

Followed the recommendations and used half white sugar and half brown. Added some cloves for that extra kick. Used 100 proof captain Morgan rum instead of the grain alcohol. Amazing!

Great but I cut the total sugar in half and did half brown sugar and it's a little less sweet and better balanced IMO.

I made two batches  at the same time. One just as the recipe instructed and the other one I altered according to some of the other suggestions from the reviews. In the altered recipe I used the cider and apple juice as directed. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar, about 1 TBSP of whole cloves, a little bit of ground nutmeg, and in place of the liquor I added 1 cup of homemade moonshine and 2 cups of  Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum.  The altered recipe was by far better. I liked the taste of the spiced rum better. I also added 1 fresh cinnamon stick to each jug.  I will definitely make the second version again.

This is a wonderful fall or winter sipper, heck I will sip it all year long. Becareful it can sneak up on you if you are drinking it and not sipping. It is a hit at our fall bonfires.

Easy! I did cut the sugar to  just brown sugar, added cloves and a couple of very finely chopped serrano peppers. Made as suggested and it is great! We do prefer this on the rocks - doesn't get that cold here in SoCal. :)

It was a little too sweet for my taste.  When I make it again, I think I'll cut that in half.  
Was forced to use 80 proof alcohol, as there was nothing stronger at the local liquor stores. Might double the quantity used for this reason. 
Otherwise, a very easy recipe. Quite tasty! An excellent base to build on.

Wow! Can't even taste the alcohol! Made this last night, let the mixture cool and added the alcohol tonight. Of course, I had to try it. The only adjustment I made was to swap out brown sugar for half of the total sugar and added 2tbsp of vanilla. I'm making this for Thanksgiving and took the advice of another reviewer to let it sit for a few weeks. Can't wait to see how that improves the flavor! I divided it into 4 containers and now I'm trying out adding some other ingredients. Tasted great with no added ingredients, but I agree there is a bit too much sugar. Maybe next time (and there WILL be a next time) I will cut the sugar in half.  In one of the 4 containers I added 1.5 cups of spiced rum... Still couldn't taste the alcohol and it cut the sweet a little. Then I tried adding a splash of butterscotch schnapps (to my cup with the spiced rum, not the whole container) yummy! I bet it would be good with cinnamon schnapps or fireball and/or vanilla or whipped vodka. This stuff is dangerous. Also, I've only tried it cool/room temp so far and it's still that good. Make this, you won't be disappointed.

If you are going to serve this warm, be careful especially if you use grain alcohol so you do not to evaporate the alcohol off.  It must cool completely before you add the grain alcohol.  Keep it covered when warming, and do not let it get close to boiling.  We use this every year at Halloween and everybody always wants it warm.

I had this recipe before finding it here. Three notes from my prior experiences.
1. Use a big turkey pot, which is double the size of a standard pot.
2. The quality of cinnamon sticks will have a big impact on the taste in the end.
3. We always by the 1.5 liter bottle of everclear. This allows for different strength jars. Use 1 liter for heavier drinkers, 750mL for medium, and 500mL for lite drinkers. 
Excellent recipe to give out as a thanks or hold onto for a long winter.

This was quite good! I had to use spiced rum because grain alcohol is illegal in PA or some such nonsense (I don't really know for sure, but that's what my fiance said). Anyway, I kept it warm in the crock pot and it was a huge hit for our first cool-weather football gathering in our new house! Go Steelers!

Love, love & love this!  It is a staple in our house and usually serve it chilled.  You cannot buy everclear here either, but you can buy it online and have it shipped to your house.  We usually buy a case and make a huge batch of Apple Pie and another of Lemoncello

I read someone say to let this sit in a closet for about two weeks my question is will the cider or apple juice ingredients go bad not being refrigerated?
