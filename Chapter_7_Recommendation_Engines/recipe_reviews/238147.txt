We loved this for our dinner tonight, and there will definitely be a next time because this was wonderful.  The only thing I did different was to use oregano rather than thyme and to go short on the cayenne.  Also I didn't process the spices together once I had them mixed up because I really prefer them without grinding.  I used a whole cut-up kosher chicken from Trader Joe's, and this was wonderful.  I made a mistake by not putting some of the seasoning under the skin, too, but I will do that next time also because we don't eat the skin--it just adds a little more flavoring to the chicken.  My hubby thanks you, too!  Thanks, Semigourmet!  EDIT:  I have used this rub in several ways.  I've coated boneless skinless chicken breasts with mayo, coated it with the rub, and stovetopped it with olive oil and butter for a quick dinner when time is of the essence!  Tonight I made my first whole chicken.  I used a half a stick of melted butter with a bunch of the rub.  I spooned some under the skin and in the cavity of the chicken and put the rest on top.  I roasted it for about 1:15 minutes at 350 when I used my Thermapen to test it.  It only needed a few more minutes to get to 160 degrees so it could rest and get the temperature to 165!  It is yummy!  Next time I will just use two tablespoons of butter to add to the rub.  Thanks, Semigourmet!  You have no idea how many times we've used this!

Holy Smokes....this is delicious! The flavor reminds me of the traditional rotisserie chicken you get at the store, but with so much more flavor and way better. I am so happy I found this this rub recipe. I wanted to roast a couple chickens that we had raised and butchered, and you really don't want to mess up a chicken you didn't just go to the store to buy...this did not disappoint. I'll mix up a large batch to keep on hand.

Delicious! So far I have tried this twice. The first time I doubled the recipe. I rubbed it on a whole chicken and let it sit for 8 hours in a ziplock, then cooked in the slow-cooker on high for 3 hours and finished it off to crisp up in the oven. I had to use ground celery seed instead of celery flakes. The second time (using the original portion size), I made it with the dehydrated celery flakes, allowing 4 chicken thighs to sit in the rub only 3 hours in an oven-proof bag, then baked in the oven (in the bag) and the taste was so much better even with less marinating time. The celery flakes give a crisper, fresher flavour. Both times we left out the salt. Thank you semigourmet for sharing your recipe.

This is a great rub.   I had to do a couple of tweaks.  Since I am restricted on salt did not add the salt also did not have celery flakes so I used 1/2 tbsp. of celery seed which ground up perfectly in the small blender.  I used this mixture on a boneless pork shoulder roast which I roistered on the BBQ.   DS#2 had been outside and came to me said that dinner smelled wonderful and he could not wait for it to be ready.  The pork was full of great flavour and very moist.  Will be making again.  Thank you Semigourmet for this wonderful rub.

Terrific rub, was great for the BarBecue too. Used it on boneless chicken breast, held up good on the grill. Only change I made was celery seed instead of flakes and didn't process in a grinder, just mixed in a bowl and rubbed it on. I'm going to make a jar up of this rub, so I don't have to mix it each time. Thanks Semigourmet, you always have such good recipes.

Dee-light-ful!  I made the recipe as stated with one exception:  I didn't have dried rosemary, so I placed fresh rosemary sprigs under the breast skin and inside the cavity.  I rubbed two chickens with olive oil, sprinkled on the rub, and threw a fresh lemon half into each cavity, along with the rosemary.  Roasted the chickens for 2 hours at 375.  The skin is  crispy and richly colored, and the meat has a great flavor.  There is easily enough left for two more chickens.  Thanks for posting your idea, Semigourmet!

Very good rub!!  I love how it doesn't have any sugar in it. I rubbed it into 5 enormous bone in breasts and grilled them.  They were super juicy. I agree with the other reviewer who said  this tastes just like rotisserie. Well done semi!!! I didn't have celery flakes so I had to sub celery salt. I didn't add the kosher salt.

This is an outstanding rub!  I mixed everything together, rubbed it on boneless chicken breast and let it sit for an hour.  My husband grilled it and we both really enjoyed it.  It makes the chicken moist and flavorful, I will make this again.

5 stars are simply not Enough for this Great Grub Rub! 10 + ***** Semi Gourmet, you are Fabulous! I LOVE This rub!! LOL I of course didn't have cayenne pepper so I used up the rest of my chipotle powder, added the smoked paprika. I used a leftover spice jar and tossed it all together. I wasn't sure if I was gonna be able to find the celery flakes but was tickled when I indeed find it @ the market. I hope you will forgive me on taking liberty of your rub and using it on something other than chicken. I could not help myself! LOL THANK YOU Semigourmet !!! DELICIOUS::)

Roasted one of our home-grown chickens with this rub last night. It was almost unbearably delicious. The flavors were vibrant and addictive and the baby potatoes that I roasted alongside the bird AND the gravy I made with the drippings were fantastic as well. Changes: Didn't have celery flakes. Only let the bird sit with the rub on it for an hour or so. stuffed cavity with garlic and onions. Roasted in my usual way (breast down, 500 for 15, 450 for 15, 425 for 30, let rest for ~15 minutes before serving)

I am hooked on this. The flavour is terrific. I have used it a few times now on chicken breasts. I have tried barbecuing them as well as roasting the chicken breasts. Each time the chicken comes out juicy and tasty and I have even used this the next day with cold leftover chicken to make the most amazing chicken salad. I used this the other night on potato wedges in the oven. That will be a regular around here because I love potatoes and the seasoning is just right for that. Thank you for a keeper.

Very very good.   This was one of the rare times that Stacy didn't reach for the BBQ sauce for her chicken and the rub gets the credit.   She does love her BBQ sauce.  I did have to make a couple of substitutions but nothing what I would consider recipe changing.   Mostly it was ground seasonings for dried.   I did sub celery seeds for leaves, but I think that was a fair substitution as well.   I seasoned my chicken several hours before I cooked them.   I then pan fried and finished in the oven and it turned out perfect.   I can't wait to throw this on some chicken on the grill.   I think this would make a nice seasoning mix for a meatloaf too.   Thanks SemiG!

Delicious, used on thighs and legs and roasted them.  Just what I like!!  Thanks so much for the recipe.  Oh, only thing I didn't have celery flakes so I used celery salt and didn't add the kosher salt.  Otherwise, followed the recipe and it was terrific!!

I have made this rub on several occasions over the past year and I love it. I have used it on chicken pieces and whole chickens. On two occasions I used it on potato wedges and diced potatoes. I put a little olive oil on the wedges and sprinkle on the rub then baked it and in the case of the diced potatoes I fried the potatoes in a bit of olive oil. My brother and bf loved it. I usually make two batches and store it in a sealed jar. Highly recommended. K

I have used this rub several times now.  It is delicious!  Once, after roasting the chicken, I used the chicken remains to make soup.  The resulting broth was exceptional.  The next time I made chicken soup - this time without roasting a chicken first - I used several tablespoons of this spice mix to flavor the soup.  The results were delicious!  Thank you for a great rub recipe and soup base!!

Definitely the best chicken rub I ever used. I did use celery seeds 'cause here i can't find celery flakes, cutting down the quantity to a quarter as the seeds are stronger. It's a keeper and I like to have it on hand whenever I have a piece of chicken to cook. My family loves it, even my mother-in-law, whose tastes really hard, loves it! I did try both on grill and in the oven, in many ways. The chicken always come up delicious! Thanks from Italy.

Awesome seasoning!  I keep a sealed plastic Rubbermaid container in my spice cabinet to use.  Itâ€™s great on roasted chickens, chicken pieces, and bundt pan chicken.  I like the fact that I can use less salt than called for, and more of other things if I want!

Excellent, flavorful rub! I used it for grilled chicken ... I rubbed my bone in, skin on chicken pieces with Olive Oil and sprinkled generously with the rub then left it sit in the fridge for about 2 hours before grilling. The only change I made was to use 2 tsp. of salt simply because we don't use much salt and therefore when we do a little goes a long way. DH stated "this is 'd@#' good chicken!" and he rarely makes that statement and had a thigh, drumstick, and breast and he never eats that much! Thanks Semigourmet for sharing! I will absolutely use this recipe for rub again.

Holy Cow--this is good! Perhaps I should have said "Holy Chicken!" I tripled the recipe to keep extra on hand. I had a whole 5lb, mostly  frozen chicken. I covered the bird thoroughly with this rub in its frozen state, wrapped in plastic wrap, and let it thaw for 24+ hours in the refrigerator. I didn't plan to cook it in the slow cooker but that's what I ended up doing. Since I like the skin crispy, I moved the cooked chicken to the oven and broiled it for about 10 minutes, flipped it over and broiled the other side until it was crispy. Yum, yum, yum. Excellent! Thank you Semigourmet!

We eat a great deal of chicken so I'm always looking for new ways to serve it.  This rub is a very welcome addition to my repertoire.  Couldn't find celery flakes, so I too used ground celery seed and I had no cayenne so I used passilla powder, which added an earthy note.  I will continue to search out celery flakes (or make my own) and then make a jarful to keep on hand.  Thanks, Semigourmet!

this was so yummy on drumsticks.. i subbed 1 tsp poultry seasoning for the thyme and sage .. used celery seed in place of celery flakes.. and left everything else the same.. i felt like it needed more salt but maybe i needed to go a little heavier on the shaker.. ty for the recipe.. ~~UPDATE: this time we used this on a whole chicken that we beer canned on the grill and added some pecan wood for a bit of smoke.. i subbed table salt for kosher salt and bf made sure to heavily coat the skin with the rub.. we were in love with this chicken.. thank you again for the recipe!

My family thoroughly enjoyed this rub on the chicken.  It has just enough zip! I plan to make a container of this rub so I always have it on hand. Canâ€™t wait to try it on the grill!

I made this my chicken turned out so moist and absolutly delicious, It makes a lot so I stored the rest in a clean glass jar and will use it everytime I bake  chicken . I rubbed it on a 3 lb chicken inside and out and a little under the skin covered it in the roasting pan with alum foil and let it sit in the fridge for 8 hours then took off the foil and baked my chicken like I always do. Incredible!

This a very good recipe. We used it on a whole chicken. We rubbed it all over with lard then rubbed it all over including the inside with the rub I Donâ€™t believe we will change it at all.

Best rub ever! Will never again use a different rub on roasted chicken. The chicken comes out tender and flavorful. I didnâ€™t bother to grind the ingredients, but I donâ€™t think it made a difference. Thanks for this one...what a gift!

Great rub. Used it on a roast turkey and was fantastic. Put the rub on and inside the turkey and let sit for about 8 hours in the fridge. Wouldn't change a thing. Good job.

I didn't follow this recipe exactly because I was missing a handful of ingredients. I didn't have celery flakes, so I used 2 tsp celery salt instead, omitted the regular salt, didn't have paprika, the thyme, or the sage (need to go shopping!), and didn't use the cayenne because most times black pepper is "spicy" for my kids. I did add 2 tsp oregano. Mixed this with 2 tbsp melted butter and smeared/plastered this all over the whole chicken. I even managed to get most of the skin up and smeared some under the skin as well as in the cavity. Roasted it for 1 hour 50, turned out ah-mazing! Took the drippings from it, put it in a small sauce pan, added 2 tsp cornstarch, made a gravy. We loved it!

I love how creative you can be with this recipe.  You can literally change things up, omit or add ingredients. Use fresh or dry ingredients. I used a combination of both. I used fresh onions & celery & added olive oil. Placed all the ingredients in a food processor. I also chopped an apple guava (peeled & removed the seeds) & added it to the mixture. It balanced all the flavors & added that extra kick! Again, I love how creative you can be with all these flavors! Thanks for sharing!

I make my own rubs & marinades, this recipe is absolutely delicious. 
I had no celery flake so substituted with a Cajun seasoning also added a TSP of aromat.
Thank You for sharing

This is the best homemade chicken rub! We're heat wimps so I left out the cayenne. I tossed some cut up chicken pieces in a bowl with cubed potatoes and carrot chunks in some olive oil and sprinkled in some of the rub, tossed it all on a baking sheet and roasted about 45 minutes. Yum! So delicious! Such a perfect combination of spices that's not just for chicken.

This was wonderful! I mixed it as is and ground it in my mortar & pestal. I mixed 2 tablespoons of the rub with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and liberally brushed it on all sides of 5 boneless , skinless chicken breasts. Then I laid them carefully on a bed of cut up celery, onions and garlic in a shallow roasting dish with no additional liquid. I baked them for 40 minutes at 350 and broiled them on low for a few minutes to slightly brown the tops. It turned out moist and tasty. I served it with baked potatoes and asparagus. My family gobbled it all up! I would love to hear other ideas to use this rub and how to cook with it.

I made this with no changes and guests loved it. I cooked the chicken with another dish at 400 degrees for approx. 25 minutes and the chicken was very moist - used bone-in chicken breasts with skin on.

Very good.  I spread it under the skin and it flavored the meat nicely.  I also put a quartered onion inside the cavity of the chicken.  I used smoked paprika in place of regular paprika and omitted the salt since my father is on a low-sodium diet.  We added salt to taste after roasting the chicken.  Thanks for a great spice blend for our roasted chickens!

This is one fabulous rub!!!! I didn't have celery flakes so I used a mixture of celery seed and a vegetable spice. I also mixed up the herbs a bit  subbing the rosemary and sage with basil and parsley. The final result was excellent. I sprinkled it on chicken piece and roasted at 375 for a little over an hour. Super flavorful!

Just made this last night. Made a few modifications based on what I had on hand. Still was delicious. Didn't have onion powder or celery powder. Husband really liked the flavor. Looking forward to making it with all ingredients. Oh! Used smoky paprika since again, that is what I had. Added a nice smoky flavor. Used it on a whole chicken, and put rub under skin as well as all over.  DELICIOUS!!!

First try I used chicken thighs with skin on them in slow cooker which caused a slight bit too much watery texture resulting in somewhat of 2 rating. Tasted good but then I opted for a second try today using skinless breasts on bbq, very low temp at around 300 degrees for about 7-8 minutes each side to get it a tinge dry. Came out 10 times better. I'm gonna use these for lunches at work but I'd like to make a version with a bit less pepper to cook for the family. I love them a lot and want my son to try it but he needs it a bit muted. Gonna serve with rice and black beans.

Roasted Chicken Rub Haiku: "Did a whole chicken, Two-fifty for four hours. Stuffed an onion too." I used Semigourmet's rub on a whole chicken that I'd stuffed w/ an onion, wrapped it tightly in plastic wrap, and let it rest in the fridge for 24 hrs. b4 baking it a 250 for a little more than an hour. (On a rack set over a pan to catch the dribble.) Not sure if Semigourmet still frequents AR due to the site's new format, but I hope she knows that we LOVED her rub recipe and can't wait to use it again!

i was talking to a friend of mine and we were discussing what we were going to make for dinner. i told her i found a rub for roasted chicken that i wanted to try, cuz there was a lot of "buzz" about it and wanted to see what the "buzz" was all about. she seemed interested as well so i emailed it to her. she also tried it that day. we both LOVE this recipe!!!! in my haste to get it all over and under the skin of my chicken, i did not put it threw the grinder. it still tastes GREAT! what i have left over, i will grind so that i can compare, but i don't see how it can get any better!!!! Thank you semi for sharing!

This is the best chicken rub that I have ever made! We made this using a whole chicken, and then cooked it in the crockpot for about four hours on low. Tastes so much like a rotisserie chicken that one might buy at a store - so good! Just a little spicy, but tastes great. All of my boys liked it, plus my husband and I. This will definitely be made again at our house, and I will be reluctant now to try any other rubs because I don't know how they would compare. Thank you for the recipe, Semigourmet!

I made no changes to recipe. This rub really does make your chicken taste like Roast Chicken! It's surprising !

This is great.  I love roast chicken, and am always looking for good additions -- and this is a definite keeper.  I did not have celery flakes, so I used celery salt instead of the flakes and sea salt, otherwise I followed the recipe.  Just excellent - am now making chicken stock from the bones and skin, which will make a fantastic soup.  Thank you!!!

Delicious as is, I used this evening on the grill with boneless and skinless breasts as well as drumsticks.  This mixture is a keeper.

Good stuff! I still don't get the taste of celery. I used celery seed and hot smoked paprika. I made without salt. sprinkler salt on the chicken, or any meat 1/2 tsp kosher salt overnight, more or less to your taste. No salt rubs can be used on your wet or dry brined meats, already salted.

Perfect. I left the cayenne pepper out because my family doesn't like the heat and it was very similar to the seasoning that Coles and Woolworths use on their rotisserie chickens.

The rub is really delicious. The only thing I added was a little olive oil to the chicken before I baked it, but it did not change the flavor. I would most definitely try again, but with just a little less cayenne

I didn't have celery flakes so I used celery seeds instead and didn't grind it either but it came out delicious anyway. I used the beer in a can method on a whole chicken with a light coat of olive oil and a generous amount of the rub. Cooked in a 350Â° oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Should have took a picture. It was a beauty.

Tasty! I used celery seed instead of flakes ( 1/2 tablespoon) and used sea salt (1/2 tablespoon). I loved how it was the right amount of spice to still not make this a spicy dish and keep it kid friendly. Next time I will find celery flakes, make a larger batch for more than one use... And not grind it up so fine.. As I think it would look nicer rustic :)

Best chicken spice rub ever! I can't believe I had all the spices needed on hand...oh the chicken I could have been serving all this time.
