I tried this recipe with the canned  green jackfruit from Trader Joe's because I had heard about jackfruit and wanted to try it for myself. This dish is tasty and not too spicy. The jackfruit consistency reminded me of artichokes. I am not vegan or vegetarian so I ended up mixing it with leftover beef taco meat to stretch it and that was really good!
