I followed the recipe except for just making half of it. Boy, am I glad I didn't make the whole reipe. The batter was very thick almost like a pie dough. It did not rise very much producing a very thin cookie bar-like, crumbly and dense 'brownie. The flavor was just ok. Not a recipe I would make again.
