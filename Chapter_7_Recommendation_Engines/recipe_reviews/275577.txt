I love coffee and I love gelato, so this is a perfect drink for anyone who wants to elevate their after dinner coffee. You canâ€™t miss with the combination of these two favorites.

I appreciate recipes which are in their purest form and this recipe is no exception. I am a coffee lover, and already had the gelato. Perfect pick me up!
