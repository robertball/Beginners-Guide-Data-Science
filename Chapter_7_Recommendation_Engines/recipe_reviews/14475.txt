We modified this a bit by adding dried cranberries and blueberries 
to the other dried fruit while stewing.  Then we mixed the whole batch into 
a regular fruit salad (canned chunky fruit in natural juices plus fresh apples, 
oranges, & bananas).  It was easy, fabulous and delicious, and even the little 
kids loved it; for the first time in 10 years people came back for seconds on the
fruit salad at Thanksgiving!

I asked my sister to fix this for our Thanksgiving dinner.  I enjoyed the mixture of the fresh and dry fruit.  It might be nice to add some dried cranberries for a little touch of tart.

I took a lot of effort at doing exactly what the recipe said. The amount of liquid was too much. Can't say , the recipe tastes bad but it didn't turn out as expected.

Very tasty! I used it as a side dish with a pork roast and it was wonderful. The only thing that I did differently was, I did add a few dried pears that I had left over from a Christmas Swiss  bread recipe, which complemented the rest of the fruit.  Will definitely make again.
