This recipe is easy and delicious! My husband loved this.  It was a great alternative to regular lasagna.  I pretty much followed the recipe.  I used some mozarella that I had in the fridge and added parmesan to each layer of mozarella. I also used real crab instead of imitation. I will definitely add this to the rotation.

The taste of this Lasagna was amazing!! My boyfriend loved it.. It was very simple to make the most time consuming part was preparing all the seafood. I did use more seafood than what the recipe call ed for, I wanted to make it chunky.

This was a huge hit with the family.  I would've added onion and add a little more garlic.  I also added some cajun spice, which gave it a little more flavor.

I can't wait to make this again!

My family loved this recipe. I goobered but it all worked out in the end. 1st, sent hubby to get lasagna noodles, he came back with the no boil ones....So I had to figure out how to accomendate the recipe for that. I know, that you need sauce on the bottom of the pan or the noodles will get hard and crusty. So I used a 3rd jar for that reason, just to sauce the bottom. I also goobered with the ricotta and used a 32 ounce container, but it didn't make much difference on that part. Other then needing an additional egg. The part on Step 3, I divided the layers with noodles in between the ricotta and the Alfredo mixture, It didn't state to, but I did. So there was extra noodles in my dish. However, the Alfredo mixture was as stated with the 2 jars. The opened jar I used to sauce the bottom, I used to sauce the very top before adding the cheese. It was delish. My husband was very questionable about trying it, gave him a small portion and he went back for 2nds and said it was really really good. I totally tried to make this to a T. But when you got curve balls coming at ya, you have to go with the flow...I don't think I went to far off base. But the noodles were perfect. From what family said and my girls and hubby enjoyed thoroughly. My son....I didn't except to eat it, so I made him a special plate of spagetti.

A recipe delight for seafood luvers, and deserves more than 5 stars. Used the ingredients as written but added ½ cup of sliced jalapenos and 1-1/2 tablespoons of “Creole Seasoning Blend by Joslyn” (on this site) to the Alfredo mixture. To avoid a runny sauce from the excess water in scallops and, to a lesser extent, shrimp, I sauteed these quickly for about 2 minutes at high heat, and then drained them before proceeding w/ the Alfredo mixture directions. All of the layered ingredients over topped a 9 x 13 x 3 (deep) inch baking dish (no boil over even though a sheet of foil was placed under the dish). You may want to use a deeper dish, if available, or a second smaller one for the overage. Concerning the “32 ounces Classico® Creamy Alfredo Sauce”, I found this product in a 15 ounce size, and went w/ 2 bottles. This will go in the Yummy, Make Again folder.

This was delicious!  I made it for my family and they loved it.  It was very simple to make.  It was very rich, so don't eat too much at a time.  I used Bertolli sauce because I couldn't find the right Classico sauce.
