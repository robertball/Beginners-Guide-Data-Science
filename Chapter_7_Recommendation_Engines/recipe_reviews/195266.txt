I made this vegetarian by using TVP instead of the ground beef.  It turned out delicious, and even the picky eaters in the family ate theirs.  It was much less work than stuffed peppers, too.  It's good with some shredded cheese on top and also works well with quinoa in place of the rice.  Easy, tasty, highly adaptable recipe!

Hubby loved, it was easy, and it wasn't too bad for you... what more could you ask?  I used 3 green peppers and 1lb of sweet Italian sausage instead of the ground beef.  I also don't have any instant rice on hand, so I used a cup and a half of cooked rice (and didn't add the water.)  Add all that and the pasta sauce in a pan and it's good grub!

This was great, a nice quick hot meal that everyone loved.  I addded onions, soy sauce and garlic salt for a little more flavor.  We will make this again.

This was very good but I changed a bit.  I used lean ground meat. I also used brown rice and precooked it. The veggies I used were green pepper, red pepper, and sweet onion and cooked them with the meat. I also used Prego sauce, the roasted parmesan and herb.  I mixed it all together with garlic salt, onion powder, minced onion, garlic salt and pepper.  Seeing that everything was precooked, I only let it cook covered for about 10 minutes. It was delicious!! I hope this helps someone!!  Enjoy!

This was a hit with both of us. Reading some of the other reviews, I added onion, Italian seasoning, Worcestershire sauce and garlic, just to boost the flavor quotient a bit. We both had seconds and found it very satisfying. I used store brand marinara sauce, and discovered after supper that I had used instant brown rice instead of white rice. No matter; it was fine.

This dish is quick & easy. My 13 & 8 yr old daughters have even mastered it. There are may nights of running for sports & this recipe has become a family favorite for those nights.
