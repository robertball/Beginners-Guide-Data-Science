This is a quick and simple recipe that can easily be complimented with other spices to fit your taste. Soaking in milk may sound strange but it gets rid of the ammonia taste that sharks sometimes have so do not pass up this step!

I have made this recipe twice.  Both times, I soaked the shark filet in milk for at least 10 minutes..then, I have drained, patted dry and baked with squeezed lemon juice and pepper.  It is fast and tasty.

For those questioning the use of milk, I didn't use it, I just washed the steaks under cool running water for a few minutes, and then squeezed lime juice over them. And if you don't get a good cut of Shark, forget it. It will be horrible. Look for Thresher shark. Sometimes the butcher doesn't even know what he has.

*EDIT******I'm going to update my review and mention ammonia smelling fish. If your fish smells like ammonia.....it's time to buy your fish in a different place. FRESH fish of any kind should NOT have a horrible smell of ammonia. When in doubt, throw it out.

I will be trying this tonight, but just wanted to clarify that the milk is to remove any fishy odor and/or taste.

I also have brushed butter on the fillets after turning them once and added lemon pepper seasoning, or it's really good with Cajun Seasoning in place of the salt and pepper.. And yes the marinating in milk is to cut down on any fishy taste. Marinate any wild game meat in milk if you suspect there will be a wild/gamey taste.

Just to clarify any and all misunderstandings about soaking shark in Milk. Shark meat has a strong ammonia type smell when harvested. Soaking in milk will remove that smell and taste. The way I prefer to do it is soak it 24 hours in vitamin D milk refrigerated, drain off then dispose. Then re-soak in low fat milk before cooking or freeze it in low fat  milk for a later date.

This was very good and very simple.  I was skeptical about the milk at first, but it worked out well.  My family enjoyed it.

Milk isn't really needed - cut the small black 'eye' out of the shark steak (same with swordfish) and all the fishy taste goes in the garbage, not into the meat!

It's a great basic recipe, can never go wrong with this when you've got shark! Allow me to clear some misconceptions about it. The Milk is there to help rid the meat of any fishy smell / ammonia that may be in the meat. This smell is something you get from Shark Meat that was NOT properly prepared by the fishermen. The Urea in the shark's blood break down into ammonia when the shark dies. So it is to VERY important to bleed the shark immediately after it was caught and pack it with ice to slow this process. The other thing with sharks is you want to make sure you're shark is between 2ft-4ft, any larger and the mercury levels will be quite high and the meat will have a stronger taste. At this length they're pretty mild, have the texture of tender steak and the flavor similar to fresh mahi mahi. We occasionally catch one of the few non-regulated species of sharks along the east coast. They're fantastic, even the non fish eaters enjoy it because its nothing like the frozen stuff in the markets.

Very delicious but also very spicy if you don't scrape off some of the seasoning before eating!

Ok so for those who are wondering what the milk is for. Its because marine life  (Im no marine specialist) urinate through their skin. That's why ALL of your shark will taste or smell like ammonia. Milk nutralizes the ammonia in the fish allowing u to season it as u please & can enjoy the meal. I used a light sprinkle of garlic salt as well served with asparagus on the side over steamed rice.

Recipe may be good. But I may just not care for shark. My bf and I both couldn't eat it. Very dry and strange flavor.

Very easy reciepe to follow. I was told to soak the shark steaks in butter milk instead of regular milk; not sure if that really matters. Shark is an acquired taste in my opinion. You either love it or hate it. Thanks for a great and simple reciepe!
