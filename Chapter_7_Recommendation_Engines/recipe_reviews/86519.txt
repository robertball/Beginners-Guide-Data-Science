Being a vegetarian, I'm always looking for new ideas and I really enjoyed this rice dish.  The only changes I made were to use brown rice, frozen spinach and balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  The next time I make it, I'm going to add a can of black beans and use it as a main dish.

This was really good. I used a blend of long-grain and brown rice and added mushrooms. I also used frozen spinach, which I thoroughly drained and sauteed for a few minutes on it's own (this step may be what the previous reviewer was missing - you sometimes have to cook frozen spinach a little more to get the "freezery" taste out of it). I served this on a platter and put the cheese down the middle of the dish (my kids can be picky about parm). All in in all, it was really good - I recommend using different rices for texture and flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

This is amazing.  I used Minnesota wild rice (60 min. instead of instant), and mixed balsamic and white wine vinegar wit a little lemon juice for the dressing.  For season salt I used Mrs. Dash.  The flavors complement one another beautifully.  We'll be having this regularly, and I'll double the recipe next time!

I have to review this as they changed some of the ingredients on me.  I use italian dressing, not vinagrette (although I am going to try greek too as that might be an interesting flavour as well with some feta cheese) and I use Mrs. Dash original as the seasoning salt.  And yes fresh spinach is better, as it is less watery.  I also like it with mushrooms, thanks for the idea! :o)

Mmmmm, mm!  Hubs and I have both decided we really, really like rice side dishes like this with lots of added vegetables.  They’re pretty, they’re delicious, and they’re good for you.  I particularly liked the addition of the fresh spinach in this one.  I prepared this with regular, long grain rice (I don’t use instant) and eliminated the vinaigrette. I loved the Parmesan in mine, but in consideration of Parmesan Hating Hubs, I left it out of his portion so he wouldn’t whine.  (He said it tasted good and it didn't stink) This, and some steamed broccoli, was just the right side dish alongside “Mushroom Melt Stuffed Chicken,” also from this site.

Very colorful, excellent dish.  I used whole grain white & wild rice not instant rice so cooking time was significantly increased. Will definitely make again.

I needed a simple side dish to use up some fresh spinach and bell peppers and this was perfect.  I used my regular long grain white rice and didn't add the vinaigrette dressing tasted fine without it.

This was a great meal and was devoured at my house!  I added a can of black beans and substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil.  Also, instead of adding vinaigrette, I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne (to avoid the calories).  Note: the fresh spinach added a lot of water as it cooked down so I drained it before adding the rice and cheese.

Maybe it's caused I used frozen spinach, but this was weird.  And I love all the veggies and cheese that is in it.  Just maybe not together.  It was very sticky and bland. To me it tasted weird

Gave this a go. Halved the recipe. Used regular rice, not instant. Used minced garlic rather than garlic salt. Used balsamic vinegar. Added another 50% spinach. I'd make it again, but I'd double the spinach next time  and try something Italian-ish rather than the balsamic. It didn't "wow" and it took a while to shop all the veggies.

This was really good, though I will decrease the amount of Parmesan next time. It was too rich for me. Aside from that, it was fantastic!

I just made this with some parmesan breaded tilapia and it was great! I used followed the recipe very close except I used brown rice and I used frozen spinach like some of the other reviewers. Using brown rice makes this a very healthy side dish and paired with fish you have an excellent and nutritious meal. My roommates both liked it a lot too!

Nice, light side dish. I doubled the spinach like one reviewer suggested, and I skipped the salad dressing and cheese. Even without those ingredients, the taste was fresh and bright.

This recipe make a very attractive side dish with all the different colored peppers and spinach.  Tasted good too!   I made a few changes to this.  I am not a fan of vinaigrette so i just drizzled a little olive oil over the top.  I also reduced the amount of salt since hubby has to limit that.  I really liked this.

We used this as a main dish and were very suprised at how much flavor it had.  Just a few changes.  We used Basmati rice, increased the oinion and used fresh garlic.  I will definetly be adding this to my "keeper" list.

Loved it! Tasted like a healthy fried rice.  I didn't have any orange or yellow bell peppers or any vinaigrette, but it tasted great without it.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was wonderful and a tremendous hit with everyone that had it.  I used frozen spinach but dethawed it the night before and then squeezed the water out by placing the spinach in a clean kitchen towel.  I will continue making this dish.  It's a winner!

Really enjoyed this recipe. Always looking for good meatless alternatives, and with black eans added, this recipe makes a wonderful meal.  The flavors are great together. With all of the colors, it also makes a pretty plate.  We eat with our eyes first! Will make again and again.

Hubby just went vegan. Followed this recipe exactly and added a can of black beans, diced avocado and green onion.  Used Trader Joe's Balsamic Vinaigrette.  He LOVED it! (Left off the cheese for him)

I agree with the reviewer who described the results as bland and weird. I didn't think my final result was anything special, and after the first bite, didn't think it would be worth making again. HOWEVER, if I did, I'd do a couple things differently. I'd use a wild long-grain rice for more flavor, and I'd also use fresh imported Parmesan cheese. I used cheese from the bottle, but imported cheese can have a pleasantly sharp bite that changes the whole flavor of the dish.

When I made a meal, I served this with skillet-cooked chicken breast that was seasoned with sea salt and cracked black pepper and cooked in olive oil. Since the rice has a lot going on, I kept the chicken simple and that worked well.

What a pleasant surprise!  The idea of vinaigrette & parmesan cheese mixed in with hot veggie and rice sounded like a very "strange idea" to me.  But, this actually turned out really tasty.  I used just one cup of uncooked brown rice to start with and bumped up on the veggie (i.e., more spinach, onions & 3 whole peppers).  This is an easy, nutritious and delicious side dish to make! It is even really awesome for toddlers!  My 17 month daughter loved it! Enjoy.

Wonderful recipe. For the viniegrette I used raspberry, about 3/4 cup. Before following the rest of the recipe I chopped 2 chicken breasts and stir fried them in  my wok with 1/2 Tablespoon sesame oil, 1/2 Tablespoon sesame seed, and 1/2 Tablespoon garlic powder. About 10 minutes. Set aside. I followed the recipe from this point stir frying vegetables. I added the chicken, garlic salt, and seasoned salt with onion and bellpepper before adding the spinach. I used about twice as much spinach as called for as it really cooks down and it came fresh from our garden. Once spinach cooked down I worked the rice in, removed from heat, then added the viniegrette and parmesan cheese. We liked the added chicken to make it a one dish meal and the sesame flavor giving it an extra oriental flair. Next time we want to try it without the sesame oil to compare and see which we like better.

Delicious! I’ve been making this for years now and am only docking a star for saltiness. My preference is to sub garlic powder (or fresh garlic) for the garlic salt and reduce the seasoned salt to 2 tsp. If I want an all-in-one dinner, I dice a chicken breast or two slightly larger than the peppers and add to the skillet with the veggies at the beginning. It finishes cooking at about the same time when diced small like that. I’ve never added the vinaigrette and don’t feel like it’s missing anything without it. Leftovers are great cold!

I used a box of long grain and wild rice mix and prepared according to the package, but otherwise followed the recipe.  This had very good flavor and texture

Bright, colorful, healthy and very tasty! What else could you want!? Once you get past the chopping...Whew!, this is an easy dish to but together. It went very well with Parmesan Crusted Tilapia from Allrecipes, which is a regular in our meal rotation. Will definitely be making this again and again.
