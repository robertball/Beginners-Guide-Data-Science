Simply perfect butter cookies. Lovely, delicate both in flavor and texture.  Four ingredients - that's it! The dough is very sticky, and for this reason, I find it easiest to use a scoop to form them. I rolled them in large crystal demerara sugar before baking for sparkle. I have found that by increasing the oven temperature to 350 degrees, the texture becomes a little crispier. These have a sable texture, similar to shortbread. This should come as no surprise. It's only logical, given the high proportion of fat (otherwise known as a "short" dough.) Also I add a few shakes of salt, since I use only unsalted butter. The salt lends depth to the buttery flavor.  I bake them for 13 minutes, and the edges come out attractively browned this way. Handle carefully to avoid breakage. The next time I intend to replace half the flour with rice flour, which should increase the crispiness. Additionally, adding a couple of tablespoons of flour could render the dough less sticky, plus decrease how fragile they bake up.

My cookies didn't spread and turn out crisp either, but they are very good...they melt in your mouth! I will make these again.

My results did not match what the description on the recipe said...I was expecting a crispy, buttery, not overly sweet cookie.  What I got was a very light cookie that is more shortbread than a butter wafer.  I probably won't make this recipe again, but I don't doubt that the cookies will still be enjoyed.
