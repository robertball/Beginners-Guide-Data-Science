These were really good.  I made six small patties out of this.  I didn't use sherry, but thought that the taste was stil  excellent.  I did dip each of my patties in flour on both sides before putting them into the frying pan.  Finally, after I added my flour and beef broth to the onions, I added 1.5 cups of milk and let it come to a boil.  Then I mixed 2T of flour with 1/2 cup of milk and slowly poured it into the broth mix.  Once it was thickened, I returned the "steaks" to the gravy mixture.  They tasted wonderful like this!

I'm always so nervous trying dishes without reviews!  But I just thought this sounded good.  And it IS good, so that was a relief.  I didn't have sherry, but I looked up a substitution chart and it said I could use orange juice or pineapple juice.  But I didn't have those either!  So I looked up aNOTHER chart and it told me I could use vanilla extract!  So I did (one tsp for the one tbsp sherry).  And the gravy just smelled so good.  And thickened up wonderfully.  All in all, a great, easy dish.  Just serve over rice!  :)

After we travel, Hubs and I crave an old-fashioned, comfort food dinner. I was on a plane at 37,000 ft. when I came across this recipe and couldn’t wait to get home to make it. I agree with Lisa completely, that this is reminiscent of an old-fashioned TV dinner, those with the aluminum trays, designed before the advent of microwave ovens. When I was a young girl, I remember a rare treat was to accompany Mom to the grocery store and choose a TV dinner. My favorite was Salisbury steak with mashed potatoes and corn (the deluxe version included a really awful brownie). This is what we craved, and this is what I attempted to recreate tonight with this recipe. In other words, I had no illusions that it would taste like anything else, and I was not disappointed. In keeping with that memory, I used cornstarch rather than flour for the gravy, as I remember those TV dinners having a translucent gravy. I cooked the heck out of the onions, until they were nearly caramelized - sweet, soft and so good. I cooked them separately, removed them from the pan, then fried up the hamburger patties. I tried making 8 of them as the recipe directed, but that was just too skimpy for me, so I made 6. I seasoned them following the recipe exactly – I wanted these simple, the kind of meal I recall growing up – nothing fancy, just delicious and satisfying. Since I served this with mashed potatoes (and corn of course!) I doubled the gravy (with no salt) and was pleased I did. We cleaned our plates.

This doesn't apply to this recipe specifically, but I am sick and tired of reading bad reviews from people who haven't even tried the recipe.  Every cook tweaks a recipe a bit, but to give it a bad review?  Too much time on their hands.  Let's see some of THEIR recipes!

this recipe is excellent as is.  Please, people....review the recipe as it is, and rate it as it is!!  Adding or changing the ingredients alters the recipe, and therefore is not a true rating of the original recipe.

We loved this recipe, thanks! I used French Onion soup instead of the beef broth, and would highly recommend using ground Angus for the beef. The flavor is wonderful, thanks!

Good recipe, but using fresh herbs and spices really helps...fresh grated garlic, minced onions or grated onion, fresh cracked pepper etc. really makes a big difference...a little chopped parsley also adds something.

These were great! I decided to follow another user's directions and add a splash of red wine vinegar (in place of the sherry that I didn't have) and it pretty much ruined the gravy beyond belief. Don't use vinegar! I luckily had an instant brown gravy mix that I whipped up last minute. Thank God you have to remove the meat or else it would have been ruined too! The way I saved it was great and I ate it on top of white rice.

Thanks, Anne, for a wonderful recipe.  It is definitely a keeper.  As others have suggested, do double the gravy. My husband did the cooking outside in an electric skillet.  Couldn't have been better!

Added couple cloves fresh garlic & half box of fresh mushrooms--threw them in food processor with the onion so they would mix with the meat better. Instead of beef broth used half a large container of mushroom broth and small container of french onion soup(not dry mix) to make the gravy. Then added rest of mushrooms and a sliced onion, put the lid on and let the whole thing simmer. Adding some sour cream to gravy just before serving with noodles makes is good too.

I buy the mushroom broth and the French onion soup at the health food store or in health food section of grocery. Most of my family are addicted to mushrooms so the broth is used in everything but dessert.

5 stars all the way!  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  Didn't have onion or garlic powders, so I used the real stuff :)  My husband didn't expect to like it (his words!) from the recipe pic, but went back for seconds and said he would like this on a regular basis!  My kids tore it up :)

This is one of the best recipes I've made off this site! It was so good that really no changes were needed to make it family pleasing. The meat was perfectly seasoned and tender, and it was really easy to make. The only changes I made were to fry the patties in nonstick cooking spray instead of all the oil (the meat was greasy enough that this worked really well!) and I also skipped the sherry, only because I never keep that in my house. Every single person in my family liked this dish, and that is saying a lot!!!! They were even requesting that I make it again this week...which I might do! I served these over noodles, and it was a cheap, tasty, family-friendly meal that I will make again and again. Thanks so much for sharing...this is a winner!!!

This popped up yesterday as the Recipe of the Day as I pulled up the site in the hopes of looking for a new turkey cutlet recipe...needless to say I made this instead! Soo happy I did! This recipe is a great way to use chop meat in a not so boring way and the ingredients are things we all have in our pantry, pretty much. The only 2 substitutions I made were soy sauce for the worcestershire and marsala cooking wine for the sherry as I did not have those 2 in the house. I did double the gravy mixture...doubled the flour, beef broth, and marsala to make more of the gravy as I knew my family would want to smother the rice with it. Always love extra gravy and it tasted fabulous so I was sooo happy I doubled it. This is def a keeper for my house! Nice way to make something different with chop meat, had the feel of salisbury steaks, deeeeelishh!!

Excellent!! The gravy this produces (which I doubled) is good enough to eat alone in a bowl! I couldn't stop sneaking spoonfulls of this gravy! The only thing I will add is that even though I tripled the amt. of everything for the gravy (ie, 3 cups of broth) it was still a bit thick. I made a note to quadruple the broth next time, to thin it out just a bit.

I served this over oven-roasted potatoes, and it was just divine.

Also, as a note, I did not have beef broth, so I made homemade broth w/ ONION SOUP MIX, which makes a lovely, savory broth w/ onion flavor! I highly recommend this route...it adds even more delicious flavor! Try it..I think you will be delighted with the taste it produces!

Thank you, and am planning on making this for visiting relatives in a couple of weeks, as it has now become one of my all-time favorite recipes!

This is a very good recipe. As with all of the recipes from this site, I make it as written; that way I rate the recipe submitted...not the one I made and have to take responsibility for the outcome! I was out of ground chuck so I used ground Buffalo. The low fat content of the meat and deep flavor worked very nice with the gravy. Served it with mashed potato's and green beans.

If you change or tweak a recipe then don't rate it! How can you be critical of a dish that you took liberties with? I will leave a review if I followed the recipe explicitly and it came out ho-hum...then and only then will I review it. Most of these recipes are a great starting place for a great meal to suit your personal tastes, however, the end result is your personal grade and not the submission's.

Ok i wanted to give this a 4.5 stars but the taste was worth the extra .5!!! AMAZING TASTE! 
I made the recipe exactly as called for except I did not use the sherry (didnt have any on hand). 
The only reason I wanted to give a 4.5 star was because the gravy was very little, not enough to cover the patties and rice. BUT now that I think about it, I didnt substitute anything for the sherry so thats probaby why..
 The little less than 1 lb of ground beef (.90 to be exact) made 8 small patties, which were perfect size for us. More like a little bigger than a slider.
Served over white rice....
This is comfort food at its finest!

Why bother reviewing a recipe if you change it to a totally different recipe? Pointless to give a bad review on a recipe you screwed up yourself by not following the directions. o.O My family really enjoyed this recipe and I have made it several times since I found it. Goes great with homemade mashed potatoes and buttery rolls!

This was delicious!  I made it exactly as written except that I used chopped shallots in place of the onion powder and chopped fresh garlic instead the garlic powder.  I also quadrupled the gravy (because it's as good as everyone says!) using two cups of beef broth and two cups of Progresso French Onion soup.  Fantastic!  If you don't make more gravy you'll wish you did.  I also used very lean 7% fat ground beef and it came out moist and juicy.  I browned the hamburgers in olive oil cooking spray rather than vegetable oil.  You don't need to cook the hamburgers through because they will finish cooking while simmering in the gravy and be very moist despite using lower fat meat.  Served with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes by Kathleen Burton and Sugar Snap Peas by CJCOLLINS.  A fantastic meal!

I would give it more stars, but i made a few changes and it didnt turn out so well.  HA HA.....So im really not too sure as to how good it could be.  Just dont do what i did.  All i had on hand was italian flavored bread crumbs. And i used sweet onions.The gravy then had no savory rich flavor, it was a sweet after taste.  And the only thing that i really didnt like about the recipe was the season salt.  Im just not fond of it.  Kinda of an artifical taste to me.  Other than that, Decent.

Just like the good old-fashioned comfort food you remember from childhood! I've made this recipe many times now, as it's a family favorite (and will be dinner tonight too). I agree 100% with the suggestion to double, or even triple the gravy so you get enough to smother your mashed potatoes (and your veggie of choice). I add a little extra worchestershire in place of sherry, which I generally don't have on hand. I use a combo of chicken/beef broth, thus eliminating the extra seasoned salt. I'm also more generous with the garlic/onion powders. I thinly slice two small onions, which seems to be the perfect amount for us. Try as I might, I can never get 8 patties, so I always make 6. Served with mashed potatoes and corn, this is easily one of my favorite AR recipes. Easy, yummy, and quick...the perfect combo!

Comfort food at it's best!  Reminded me of a dish you would expect in the "olden days."  This was very flavorful.  The only thing I changed was that I didn't add the sherry (only because I didn't have any).  I added Worcestershire sauce to the beef broth instead of the sherry.  I'll probably keep doing it this way because I always have Worcestershire sauce and never have sherry.  I served this with hot, buttered egg noodles and green beans.  Super easy to make...great weeknight recipe!

I've been making this recipe for years but called it Salisbury Steak, served w/mashed potatoes and a veggie or salad.  It's a keeper.  I wouldn't change one thing! Yummy!

Hamburger steak with gravy is a classic Cajun dish here in South Louisiana (really). I use ground round or even chopped sirloin, mix the ingredients into the meat, and let the patties sit in the fridge for about an hour before cooking. The flavors mix very nicely and the meat firms up and doesn't fall apart in the skillet. I usually add sliced mushrooms, and also sometimes a few tablespoons of tomato sauce, depending on what's left over in the fridge. I don't use sherry, but I cook with red wine in practically everything -- Cabernet Sauvignon or Marsala -- which works great. And I use diced fresh garlic because I can't abide garlic powder.

COMFORT FOOD TIP: Make extra gravy; reheat it and eat it over a couple slices of French or Italian bread, especially late at night with a bottle of beer!

It was a rainy day here today, so I was really looking for some comfort food.  I came across this recipe and saw all the rave reviews so I figured I would try it.  I added minced onion, and parsley to the meat mixture and made into 4 patties instead of 8.  I doubled the broth omiting the sherry and added italian seasoning and mushrooms to it.  The cooking time was accurate, however the taste was very bland.  The meat was very "meaty" tasting to say the least, and the gravy wasn't that impressive.  It tasted like a tv dinner.  We really didn't care for this, and I will be on the search for a better recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

Great Recipe. I used lean ground beef and used Italian Bread crumbs and they came out wonderful. Since I used lean beef I added two Tablespoons of Butter to make the gravy. I omited the Sherry and used two cups of beef broth for extra gravy. My Husband loved this recipe. Will make again.

Excellent! A very hearty and satisfying dish when coupled with mashed potatoes to put that thick savory gravy on. The only change I made to this superb recipe was to double it and I'm glad I did.  My whole family loved it and requested we have it again soon.  I'm emailing this one on to my friends and putting it in the front of my recipe box.

Made this exactly like the recipe and it was outstanding. Hubby couldn't stop eating. I served it with mashers and succotash, just like the Salisbury steak at Cheesecake Factory! I agree with others that it wouldn't hurt to double the gravy. Very tasty!

yummmm soo good! i used butter instead of oil, about 2 tbsp. made 6 burgers. I made the beef broth with a beef boullion cube and hot water. I also mixed the flour with cold milk (about 1/2 cup) and added it after I added the broth. really REALLY GOOD!

wow! what can I say? this was the best recipe I ever used for hamburger steaks. I have made it twice so far and the last time I served it with fries seasoned with oregano and parmesan cheese (greek way)...and put the brown gravy over the fries (cajun way)...so yummy.. a KEEPER!!!! I used more onions than suggested and i also used 2 pounds of ground sirloin so I doubled everything and still made about 7 to 8 of them

This recipe is amazing. It's my husband's favorite dish that I make and he requests it all the time. Also,  I've made this recipe for several people and they always love it. Many of them said they've never liked hamburger steaks before. I like to keep this recipe close to the original because it's that good. The only thing i change is that I add mushrooms and double the gravy so we can put it on mashed potatoes. Definitely give this recipe a try!

Reminds me of my childhood when my Mom would make Salibury steak.  I purchased hamburger steak patties, so I didn't use the egg or bread crumbs.  I fryed the patties,removed them and fryed the onions, added rest of the ingredients to make gravy added patties to gravy and spooned gravy over meat, covered and baked in a 300 oven for about 45 minutes.  Very tasty, will make again!

Everyone in my home ate this and liked it.  That is nothing short of amazing in my houseold, since generally at least one person dosen't like something.  (wouldn't it be great to please everyone, all the time?  ehhhhhhh........)  I believe I didn't make my "steaks"  thin enough, after cooking they became sorta rounded.  Very yummy!

Yummy. I made minimum changes, mostly out of necessity. But mostly I made it as is, and it was a satisfying meal.   I dredged the patties in flour before frying them. I didn't have seasoned salt, so I used plain salt in the meat and omitted it in the gravy. No sherry, so I tried the hint of replacing with homemade vanilla extract. I doubled the gravy (but didn't double the extract).

I've made this on a couple of occasions and I love it, especially when chilly fall days set in. I've made it as is with great results, I've doubled it with no issues and I've tweeked it to my particular tastes and each time it comes out great! 

In my most recent version, I changed up the spices a bit and included some smoked paprika and a teeny bit of chili powder and thyme. I also added about a tablespoon of my favorite hot sauce in with the eggs and beat them to mix it all together before adding it to the meat mixture. 

Rather than adding the onions with the meat to cook, I dice them and add them to the drippings with 8oz. of chopped mushrooms and 1-2 tablespoons of butter. Instead of sherry, I used Madiera wine. Increase the flour by 50% and after adding the broth and wine, I add 1/2-3/4 cups of milk. The little bit of extra richness is wonderful.

This makes the juciest burgers and the gravy was great even the next day.The only thing I saw that it was not salty enough had to add salt at table. I did try by adding mushrooms but I won't do that again, it was not as good and don't slice the onions so thin they tend to cook away.But is is probably the first Hamburger Steak recipe I have gotten that the meat was not tough and tasteless.
Try it you will like it. The red wine is next to be added.

This was great!  The gravy is really the best part.  I doubled it, and I still want to make more....it would be good on a lot of things.  I think the quality of your ground beef is probably important here.  I didn't have cooking sherry or onions so I left those out, and I used regular salt because I don't like seasoned salt.  This is a recipe you can mess with to your liking and still have the same basic great thing.  I boiled some potatoes in beef broth to go with it.  Even my picky husband said this tasted like something you would get at a really good restaurant!

This was a great easy recipe. I mixed 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 ground beef.  My onion gravy was a little heavy in onions!  So next time I'll cut the onions back,  but other wise I'll be making this again!!

Very good!  I doubled the gravy ingredients and added a can of French onion soup and golden mushroom soup.  I also sautéed the onions with a few mushrooms after the meat then added all back to the pot with the gravy.  I might add extra seasoning next time - maybe a Montreal steak seasoning or some steak sauce.

Good recipe.  Great with some upgrades.  Burgers need more spice.  Mayber some garlic?  I needed to add more flour to make gravy thicker.  Definately double the gravy and I would suggest using hamburger with more than 10% fat for thicker gravy.

This is my go to hamburger steak recipe.  I made it the first time with cooking sherry, but it's not something I keep in my pantry, so I just omit it now.  Sometimes I also replace the seasoned salt in the patties with Tony Chachere's original creole seasoning. I love that this recipe is flexible and easily modified!  I will continue to use it!

I agree with Reviewer Flo, it is not helpful when people rate the recipe with all of their "changes".  I made the recipe as it is written and my husband and I enjoyed it very much.  The next time I make this I will double the gravy especially because we had mashed potatoes as a side with it.  Other than that, it was a good easy quick meal and I already had most of the ingredients on hand...only had to buy the beef and broth :)

I sure loved this meal!  My inlaws own a dairy farm, so we get unlimited amounts of ground beef and are always looking for new ways to serve it.  These steaks were moist and very flavorful.  I didn't have beef broth, so i used chicken and it was yummy.  Served with taters and veggys it was a perfect Sunday meal.  My hubby thought they were real packaged steaks (we have some at the farm that kind of look like these...but aren't that good.)

Really nice hamburger steak.  I found this recipe when scouring my pantry for ingredients for dinner.  I didn't have breadcrumbs or an egg, so I substituted equal amounts of dry oats and mayo.  Worked beautifully.  My picky children loved it.  I'll try it again with the actual ingredients, and I'm sure it will be equally delicious.  Thanks for a great go-to recipe.

This was delicious!! I made it as written and was impressed with how tasty this dish is. The secret is in the seasoned salt so don't substitute it out. I did use seasoned breadcrumbs and made 4 flat patties. It's not the prettiest dish but it is one of the better ones I have made on this site as written. It tasted like a really good salisbury steak ... the meat was soft and flavorful and the onion gravy was just enough (I did use low sodium beef broth). Served with mashed potatoes and veggies ... I will make this again without a doubt. Thanks Anne Marie, I found a keeper today!

These were so easy to make and delicious. Reminded me of the TV dinner salisbury steaks we had as kids. I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce so I sub'd vinegar and extra garlic salt. Great weeknight meal.

My only change was I left out the sherry and added sliced fresh mushrooms.  My LOVED this!  Any time I make an AR recipe and he cleans his plate and asks for 2nds, you get 5 stars.

I've been looking for a "Salisbury Steak" recipe for years and this fits the bill perfectly.  I doubled the gravy  part of the recipe so I had plenty to smothered my mashed potatoes with it. The recipe as written makes one cup of gravy and that isn't nearly enough for all that meat.   Yummy is all I can say!!!!!  Thanks so much for sharing!

A cool, rainy day ruined our menu plan of grilled burgers so I gave this recipe a try.  It was delicious.  I thought I would have leftovers, but there wasn't a scrap left.  I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans.  The only change I made was using homemade chicken stock as I had a lot in my freezer.  You would never know, it was wonderful!

What a great recipe!!  The only thing I did different was I added lipton onion soup with the beef instead of the other listed spices.  Added great flavor,  My whole family (including my picky 5 year old) LOVED it!

Made this last night and we all loved it!  I'm not too good at making gravy but just followed the directions and it really turned out well!  I pretty much followed the recipe as written except I didn't have seasoned salt so just added in some garlic powder, and used a LOT of onions in the gravy as we love onions!  I will definitely make this again.

Really good! Because of dietary issues I used half ground turkey and half sausage instead of beef but it turned out just fine. I didn't have sherry so red wine was substituted and I wish I had made double the gravy to drown mashed potatoes, but that will be the next time. Thanks for the recipe - we'll have it again soon!

The recipe was excellent; I don't personally care for the texture of the ground beef cooked this way.  The flavors were terrific.  I might try adapting this with cubed steak or other cut of beef.

My kids really liked this one.  I followed the recipe for the meat patties but made some pretty big changes on the gravy.  I just couldn't get myself to use hamburger grease as the base for my gravy so here is what I did.  I cooked the patties on a stovetop griddle and then removed to some foil to keep warm.  Then I cooked my onions in another pan in a bit of olive oil, sprinkling with some seasoning salt, then removed to keep warm.  For the gravy I heated together 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, about 1/2 cup beef broth, about 1/2 cup milk, and the sherry.  I placed the patties in a large serving dish, topped with the onions and then poured the gravy over the top.  It was great!  Don't over season the meat.  The amounts shown are plenty.

This really went over well for Sunday dinner.  I followed the recipe to a T except for I didn't have any sherry (and we don't like it anyway) so I subbed in Maggi seasoning.  I also cooked the onions after I cooked the patties.  Next time I will follow the others advice and double the gravy as it is delicious.  Thank you for a great old-fashioned, homestyle recipe, we definitely will be using this one often.  PS. Hubby said patties would be good on their own as homemade hamburgers as well.

I made this for dinner last night and thought it was great. The burgers were perfectly seasoned. I doubled the gravy and left out the sherry. The only thing I would do different next time would be to saute the onions after removing the patties, instead of all at once.

Need to double the gravy recipe.  Needs more vegetable oil.  I reduced the salt mixed with  meat to 1/4 tsp.  The gravy is exceedingly salty--I reduced the amount of salt for the gravy to 1/8 tsp and it was still too salty. I suppose that was from the sodium in the Worcestershire sauce and broth.  I will not try this recipe again and will go back to using my Salisbury Steak recipe.

Great recipe!  I was in a hamburger rut and needed a new and different recipe and this is it... such a cozy homestyle type of meal that doesn't take long to make and really makes a pound of hamburger go pretty far.  The gravy was delicious!  I took the advice of some reviewers and doubled it - I wish I had tripled or quadrupled it though, this gravy was so tasty over mashed potatoes!  The only ingredient I left out was the sherry - we're just not fans, and I can't believe it could've tasted any better with it.  This meat mixture I'm pretty sure would make great meatballs too for spaghetti... just a great combination of seasonings.  Loved it!

This was awesome!!  My husband even liked it and he hates cooked onions.  I am with Naples on a few things.  1. The patties were small as 8, 6 would have been better.  2. Cooking the onions separate is a MUST but I did them after the meat in order to get the flavor and the bits.  3. I did use flour this time but I will use corn starch next time.  And there will most definitely be a next time.  I also didnt have any sherry so I use more Worcestershire sauce instead.  This is definitely going to be in my favorite recipes rotation.  Thanks Anne

This recipe turned out awesome and the gravy was delicious. I used two pounds of ground beef, used onion flakes, added a can of french onion soup, fresh mushrooms and white wine.  Will make this dish again.

I made this last night.  My hubby went back for seconds.  I made it with the review suggestions of others who fried the patty first, removed and then fried the onions.  I added mushrooms at this point too.  Dust with flour and scrape pan, add the onion soup broth, add the 1 1/2 cup of milk, bring to boil and add another 1/2 cup of milk with 2 T flour.  It made a lot of very good gravy.  I also used the suggestion of making the patty, dip in flour and refrigerate for an hour.  I think that did help them to stick together.  It was a good meal.  I will make it again.  Thanks for the helpful suggestions.

This was absolutely wonderful. It was also really easy!! I really loved the gravy. The only thing I did different was I added about 2 cloves minced garlic to the onions. Next time I will use more onions though. Thanks for the recipe!!

Really good comfort food that I remember eating when I was a kid.  I used extra lean beef, so this ended up being quite healthy.  I served it with sauteed kale and sweet potatoes.  I will make this again whenever I want a blast from the past!

I have to admit that I increase my sauce proportions with more beef bouillon and sherry, but otherwise I keep it the same. My daughter never tires of this dish!

I LOVE these hamburger steaks. Cook em with double gravy, mashed potatoes, and corn and it's just like my favorite tv dinner, only homemade and a million times better!

I made this for my dad (I don't like hamburger steak) and he said "make sure you hang on to that recipe". So I guess this is a keeper!

Easy and good. I didn't change a thing. I would make this again, but I might change a few things, like add mushrooms and maybe a little onion in the patties...It's definatly a start to a great recipe.

Everyone liked it.  My three youngest, pickiest eaters loved it.  I had to substitute chicken broth for the beef broth since it was all I had.

Delicious! Such a homestyle meal, tasted like something my grandma would make. I only made 6 patties instead of 8. I cooked up about a cup of bowtie pasta and stirred it into the gravy at the end. Turned out great.

I think this is a very good recipe, but was a tad bland for our taste.  I had to increase the seasonings and added some sliced mushrooms.  However, I will keep this in my repertoire because it's easy, inexpensive, and uses ingredients usually on hand. I put the patties in the fridge for about 30 minutes to help them hold together during cooking--didn't have any problems with breakage. Thanks for sharing!

I gave this recipe 5 stars even though I did make a couple minor changes. I made my own fresh bread crumbs & didn't use the sherry or seasoned salt in the gravy. I did however make the patties as written. I also doubled the flour & broth for more gravy. It was a hit with my son, so this one's a keeper!

Can you say "comfort food" at its finest?  I initially made this thinking it was something my husband would enjoy, but I enjoyed it every bit as much as him.  Followed the recipe and served it with mashed potatoes.  Next time I may double the sauce.  Yum!

Wow! We LOVE this and will never buy packaged or jarred gravy again...you can sub a little red wine vinegar for the sherry and added fresh mushrooms as it simmered. I've also prepared this gravy using the spices with the leftover juice from a crockpot pot roast, which we have twice a month.

I substituted A1 Bold Steak Sauce for the Worchestershire Sauce as I did not have it on hand.  I doubled the gravy fixins and added a small can of sliced mushrooms-personal preference.  MOIST AND DELICIOUS.  This recipe can be prepared early in the day, but prior to serving you will have to add a little water to the gravy to get the consistency you want.  Hamburger patties remained moist and flavorful.

pretty close to the way gram ma  made this no sherry was used to expensive. Mashed potatoes is what we all ways had. This Dish was made back years ago because it cheap and filling. Of course Hamburger back then was .39 cents a Lb. sometimes less.

YUM, comfort food at it's best.  My boyfriend said it was definetly restaurant quality.  I added sliced fresh mushrooms along with the onions... I will use more onions next time as well.  For the gravy, I used  CONCENTRATED beef broth, but I used a full cup of it.  I think that's what made my gravy sooo savory and tasty. Also, I added a dash of red wine instead of the sherry, and also a dash of milk to make it a little creamy.   This is definetly a very very quick and easy recipie that is delicious!

This was perfect on a cold, dreary, rainy day!  Real comfort food! I used dried minced onion instead of onion powder.  I also added a few shakes of A1 to the sauce because my husband is an A1 fan.  I made the gravy as directed with the addition of some sliced baby portobellos.  I will definitely be making this again.

We did not care for this. This is partly my fault because I listened to another reviewer and I used vanilla extract as a substitute for cooking sherry. Disgusting. For the actual hamburgers all of the ingredients made my hamburgers way to wet. It was a huge disappointment in my house. Sorry for the negative review.

Similar to "Salisbury Steak" frozen meal. The sherry & Worcestershire add an important flavor. Doubled the gravy to serve with mashed potatoes.

Very very tasty!  I didn't have beef broth so I used lipton's beef onion soup mix and water and used crushed ritz crackers rather then bread crumbs.  I also omitted the seasoning salt in the gravy and replaced it with worcerstershire sauce. It turned out perfect and tender.  Best of all, the kids loved it and they are not fans of onions.  ;)

Really simple and tasty recipe.  I followed the ingredient list exactly with the exception of using fresh onions and garlic rather than dried.  I really think the grated onion made the steaks nice and moist while providing loads of flavor.  I think the sherry was a nice touch. YUM!

I was sick with a sinus infection and fever when I attempted to make this.I thought I had everything I needed, but found out too late 
i didn't. I hate when people review a recipe they didn't follow, but today I am one of them, just bevcause it worked out so well. I didn't try it but dh and my kids loved it! first i used italian bread crumbs all I had on hand. was out of beef broth but had 2 packets of brown gravy which i didn't use the flour called for because gravy thickens. didn't have cooking sherry but used a dry white wine. also since i doubled the recipe after browning the patties in oil I put them in a 9x13 pan finished the gravy in the skillet poured it over the patties and baked 350 for 30 min. made 13 patties after feeding dh , 2 teenage boys, and 2 kids I only have 2 patties and a little gravy left. served over mashed potatoes.

What a great excuse for shopping in your pantry! When I stopped eating red meat about 10 years ago, I started looking for ground beef recipes I could substitute with ground turkey and not miss the flavor. This is one of them. Of course I made a few changes to the recipe: substituted 1 lb ground turkey for beef, exchanged 1 can beef broth for chicken broth, added 1 14.5 oz can of tomato sauce, added about a teaspoon of lemon pepper seasoning to the sauce, and omitted sherry because I didn't have any. Everything else, I left the same. I loved it! If I were to change anything else, it would be to find a good meatball recipe and use that instead of this one only because I like a stronger seasoned meat. Other than that, this is a keeper!... And I didn't even have to leave my house for the ingredients.

This is a gret recipe I've made several times.  Don't need to change a thing about it.  I never have Sherry, so I leave it out or sub something that is recommended in it's place.  Serve w/ mashed potaotes and corn (just like picture).  Very very good and inexpensive.

Wow!  Thanks Anne!  This was fabulous!!  The meat was so tasty, and the gravy was the best!!  Per other reviewers, I doubled the gravy using 1 can of condensed french onion soup along with one cup of beef broth.  And this is a forgiving dish because I had measured the flour incorrectly and had more that was called for, so to thin it down a bit I used a little more beef broth, a little milk, and Kitchen Bouquet to re-darken the color.  And I was too impatient to let the meat patties simmer in the gravy for 15 minutes, and this was still an outstanding dish!!  Served with mashed potatos and buttered peas.  Yum!!  Thanks again!!

This recipe is the bomb!!  Don't change a thing with any of the ingredients...I hate when people rate a recipe after they put their on customized version on it!  I served this with mashed potatoes and my husband said, ""This is so delicious"....I replied, "It's the like eating back in the 60's , isn't it?"!  He agreed....believe me, this is old time, and we loved it!!!  Comfort food at it's best....thanks!!

So easy and very tasty...  Though it was a little too salty for my taste.  I doubled the gravy recipe and served over egg noodles.  Will definitly add this to my menu again.

Excellent.  I tried this recipe and really like it.  I forgot to add the Sherry, but it was still great.  I served it over hash browns with a side of cooked veggies.  Great!

Followed the recipe as it was written except that I left out the sherry.  The only thing I would do differently next time is double batch the gravy.  Really yummy.

As a really good "comfort meal" you can't beat this.  We had a cold dreary, rainy, early fall day and I made this for dinner with some mashed potatoes, green beans, and Eggplant Bruschetta from this site.  Everyone practically licked their plates.  Even my three year old grandson, who is very skeptical of everything said "I like this meat!"  A keeper recipe for sure.  I did double the gravy because who doesn't want extra gravy on mashed potatoes!

This is such an quick, easy and delicious recipe you can make in no time. I substituted gluten free all purpose flour because my husband has celiac's disease. I also added a small can of portobello mushrooms. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved it!!

Comfort food at it's easiest! Everyone in my family enjoyed this... even a picky 7-year old. From start to finish, including peeling & boiling potatoes to mash, this dinner was done in less than 30 minutes. Loved that I didn't have to make a last-minute trip to the store as all the ingredients were already in my pantry. I always wondered how my mom put together a yummy dinner when I couldn't see "anything" to eat in the fridge...  this recipe is how. Definitely a keeper. Thank you for sharing!

The quality of your meat can either make or break this recipe. I've tried it with a high quality ground beef from an Amish meat market and enjoyed it and also tried it with grocery store ground beef and it was just ok. I like to use beef stock as opposed to broth for a deeper flavor and do look for lower sodium. Although I would love to try this with onion, my husband won't eat them so I substitute mushrooms. This makes is a good easy meal and will stay in my recipe box.

This was really good. Super easy to put together. I left out the cooking sherry since I never have that. Added a little bit of Worcestshire sauce into the gravy and dredged the patties in flour before I cooked them. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good. Will make again.  Made some changes according to what I had on hand.  Didn't use sherry, used crushed cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  I chopped up the onions instead of slicing and added fresh sliced mushrooms.

I followed the directions to a T and it was alright.  Nothing to write home about.  I didn't have sherry so I used some Port.  Otherwise, followed exactly.  Served over steamed rice.

This was soooo delicious! I made the recipe just as described but doubled the gravy. Served with rice and steamed green beans. My extremely picky teenager licked his plate clean and he NEVER does that! Husband loved it, too! Will definitely add this our list of family favorites. Yum!

I made this for dinner when it was the Recipe of the Day - yummy.  Easy and did not take long to get it on the table.  My husband loved (!!!) it.  I doubled the ingredients for the gravy as so many other reviewers have done.  I served it with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables.  Thanks Anne Marie!

My son is totally in love with this recipe. Asks for it almost every week. That is a huge compliment from a kid who usually complains no matter what I put in front of him. Thanks

This was to die for! I made a slight alteration that tasted GREAT I used powdered french onion soup and mixed it into the meat! It tasted GREAT a very picky 6yr old ate 3 helpings of it and did not mind the mushrooms and onions.also my wife LOVED IT. The powdered french onion soup in mixed in the meat gave it a great flavor and it wasn't to salty or anything.

Just made this tonight for an early dinner and it was fantastic. I doubled the gravy because we like a lot of it to go on mashed potatoes, but otherwise I didn't change a thing. It tastes a lot like my homemade baked steak, at a fraction of the price. A new favorite in my recipe box!

Very Good!!  I used to make something like this but used onion mix package and a package of brown gravy.  This is way better and no MSG in any of it which is why I was searching for a different recipe. My family LOVES this and says its the best hamburger steak I have ever made.   I didn't change anything only doubled it which I would recommend if you do double on the gravy still only stick to the 1/2 teaspoon of season salt because it will make it a little to salty!  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I had forgotten how good this traditional diner dish is. I used a beef bouillon and add'l hot water to make more gravy for the mashed potatoes. Thanks for the memory of eating downtown  at the counter of the Cheffnette many years ago.

Very tasty, needed more gravy so followed the advice of another and added milk and flour. Made a very creamy gravy.

These were really tasty and easy to make.  I wish I had read the reviews first and had doubled the sauce though, because it definitely needs more sauce!

i'm a southern girl living in yankeeland, so i found this recipe in my search for a taste of home and it really hit the nail on the head. just fantastic, the gravy was so scrumptious, i was licking the spoon i used to stir it! I seasoned the patties with grill seasoning before browning them, and omitted the sherry because i didn't have any on hand, and they were still just amazing. I also used a combo of EVOO and butter instead of vegetable oil since the gravy used a roux as the base. this was so wonderful, exactly what we were looking for!

This is definitely a keeper!  My husband absolutely loved this recipe. The gravy is delicious.  I didn't have any cooking Sherry though so I substituted Cream Sherry and it really gave the gravy a nice flavor. I over cooked the hamburger steaks so they were a little dry, but that was MY fault. Next time I make them, which will probably be next week, I will not cook them as long and I think I will not use as lean of a hamburger meat. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I followed exactly but left out the seasoned salt.  DO NOT skip the cooking sherry, it only costs a couple dollars and is located by all the vinegars in the grocery store.  Oh, and I made 4 patties out of this because I didn't think my pan could fit 8.  Will make again and again!

SO HAPPY I FOUND THIS RECIPE! I'm surprised to learn this is a southern dish as it's a common dish served in local Hawaiian restaurants (served over white short grain rice). This is my favorite dish to order so it makes me even more excited that it came out SO GOOD ("SO ONO" in Hawaii)! It's on par with some of the best I've tasted! I made it for family dinner and everyone loved it. They were surprised I made everything from scratch, even the gravy, and said that it tasted better than the ones they've had in restaurants. I'm giving it 4 stars because I did take the advice of the other reviewers and don't think it would have been as good had I not. I almost doubled the gravy recipe (I ran out of beef broth - 1 can makes approx 1.5 cups) and I think it was just perfect! I also added a touch of milk to thicken, cooked the onions in the drippings separately AFTER the hamburger was moved to a plate and added mushrooms to the onions. Even though I used 3/4 of a medium onion, and 1/2 of a basket of sliced fresh mushrooms - I feel I could have added even more. I added about 1/4 tsp salt since others described it as a little bland. It came out PERFECT and I will definitely add this to my regular rotation. This was easy to make even though the ingredients list looked long and possibly complicated. It really isn't! Don't get intimidated by that - try it! Thank you Mrs. Trader!

this was great! i cooked it for the first time and it was delicious! i did not use the sherry in the recipe, and i did like others said and doubled the gravy recipe, and trust me, you should because it's amazing and personally i don't think it would have been enough gravy for the steaks and the rice had i not doubled the gravy recipe. the steaks were tender juicy and flavorful!  the only thing i would recommend is adding a little more seasoning to the gravy mix (to your taste; i'm from the south and we really like our foods seasoned well so i added extra) but this definitely is a keeper!! thanks!

Delicious!  We had this for a Saturday lunch and I served it with some fries.  My husband is a meat and potatoes kind of guy and this was perfect.  Didn't add the sherry because we didn't have it on hand, but it was still delicious!

This was superb!  I re-arranged the recipe to fit what I had on hand:  I used de-frosted frozen hamburger patties (4 is one pound,) and like another user suggested, I used onion soup mix instead of beef broth since it was all I had (1/4 cup of mix with 1 cup water in the microwave for 4 minutes.)  Next time I make them, I'll add a little more worcestershire sauce for a little more zip.  My husband LOVED them, there were no left-overs.  He's asking me to make up 2 batches of these so he can heat them up for lunch and dinner when I'm not home!  HIGHLY recommended!

This is an excellent recipe as is.  It is improved by doubling onions and gravy and using "real" dry sherry.  I plan to use this recipe for meatballs in the future and make a quick sauce of chili sauce and cranberry sauce and into the crockpot it goes!!

Next time I'll double the recipe and up the size of the meat patties.  I might also try using ground sirloin.
Thank YOU!  My family is very happy!

Very quick and easy - my 7 year-old even helped.  I doubled the amount of gravy (used 2 cups beef broth, more sherry, and more flour), but otherwise the recipe was dead on.  A great weeknight dinner served with rice!

I never made such yumminess! so today my the first time using this app and decided to make this dish..didn't have enough ground beef, so I decided to add ground turkey to it. I'm very good at recreating dishes..always used Pinterest, not this time, but oh man this recipe is so easy. my hubby loves it, I made 12 hamburger stake patties and it is delicious! I would recommend to anyone, even for the first time chefs. I'll make this again and next time it will be for a family.

Really good. Flavorful gravy, tender patties. I was reluctant to use a lot of onion but next time I will add more. Didn't have sherry.Not a big  fan of Worcestershire sauce, but I was really surprised how much it added to the dish. I added to the gravy too. Will definitely make this again and again. Easy peasy!

All recipes are a start to your personal preference. I read the reviews for suggestions, tips and to see how others added or subtracted items.  That is the reason there are a million cookbooks out there.

If you were restricted to just reviewing the recipe as is, you wouldn't  have too many reviews. We are all in this food world together and thankfully help each other.

Oh yeah.  I'm a meat and potatoes guy, so this was right up my alley.  Made it as directed, but made six patties instead of eight.  I used the specified 1 cup of beef broth, but found I needed to add some more to make the gravy.  I added even more onion. 
 My wife had seconds, which is unusual.    This recipe is a keeper.

I liked this--I like a lot of seasoning and this could definitely use a more generous portion of them.  But I liked this and it was easy to make.  I didn't use sherry as I had none on hand.  I made this for myself and a friend, and saved some for my mother.  She likes hamburger steak and gravy and likes it  rare.  The pound of hamburger made 4 patties.  Splitting it eight ways would be like making meatballs!  The gravy didn't come out too thick or thin.  It was good!

She was right, I had everything on hand! DBF loved it, went back for seconds, I thought it was ok. I doubled the gravy portion. The "steak" was a little bland so next time I'll add a little more seasoning. I served with white rice and honey glazed carrots.

I make my own bread crumbs by toasting bread or buns a little browner than usual, gives it a better taste, and I use wild grind meat such as venison or elk.  Lastly, I use beef bouillon granules to make my own beef broth.  It is a huge hit in my home.  As to all the whiners saying "only rate the recipe" and "don't change anything".....the "spice of life" is the very changes we make instead of being a Stepford Wife.....  Thanks to all who offered changes and other ideas, so as to allow those of us who want ideas from all to be able to share in your ideas!!!!

Just made this for dinner because I was looking for a simple meal that I had all the ingredients for.  YUM!  I tweaked it just a little by cooking the patties first, then the onions after with some fresh mushrooms before making the gravy.  I used about 1-1/2 cups of beef broth because I didn't have any sherry and it was fine.  Served with simple boiled cabbage.  Delicious!  This is going into the regular rotation.

I made the basic recipe and added sour cream to give it a rich creamy sauce.  Then I used a culinary broth which includes a nonalcoholic sherry.  This gave it a nice flavor.  Plus I added mushrooms to the gravy.  I was happy with this version of the recipe.

I added mushrooms with the onion. I also added an egg as a binder for the meat mixture. I have made this many times, with and with out the wine. The wine adds a deep rich flavor just from the sweetness. Serve with a green salad and potato's. Awesome dinner.

I loved this recipe! It's not fancy but it tastes so good. I made it almost exactly to the recipe, with two very minor changes. I didn't have any sherry, so I just left it out. Also, my meat was pretty lean so I didn't feel that there was enough fat left in the pan to make the gravy, so I added a tablespoon of butter before adding the flour so that there would be a good roux. If you are using fattier meat you may not need to do this. I wasn't serving potatoes or rice, but if I were, I'd double the gravy amount (pretty easy if you just add some butter). This is the kind of recipe where the leftovers need to be put away right away before I overeat!

This was an amazing recipe! Even my very picky 7 yr old loved it! It was also very simple to follow and put together. I didn't have any bread crumbs, so i crushed up half a package of saltines instead. I also did not have any cooking sherry, so I just left that out. I took another's suggestion to double up the gravy however, and am very glad I did! All in all, this made a fantastic dinner and I will be adding it in to our monthly rotation.

Quick and good. Made this recipe in under 20 minutes (including prep time)! I had gravy left over so I saved it and made the steaks again a few days later. This one is fool proof and a go to for a quick fix!

This was delicious! I follow this recipe exactly except I substituted orange juice for cooking sherry because that's what I had. (I can't imagine that this would alter the taste that much.) I made extra gravy to go over rice as others suggested. My boys really liked it so it will be added to the recipe rotation.

Great recipe, love the flavor especially with the Worcestershire.  Will be highly recommending this one in the future and will be using it often for a change in just plain burgers or meatloaf.  Also, next time I'll try frying it as chicken fried steak with a white gravy.

I made this recipe as it is here so I rated for how it was before changing the recipe. The meat was bland and the gravy had no flavor. I love the idea of the recipe but to make the gravy taste good I had to add garlic, salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Unfortunately I did not realize the meat was going to be so bland or I would have added something like garlic and oregano. I will probably try it with these modifications. I put it over rice and I am impartial to rice or potatoes.

Good comfort food!  I had to substitute red wine for the sherry, as I didn't have any on hand.  My husband thought it was just okay, but I liked it.  Gravy would taste great on mashed potatoes or egg noodles.  Next time, I'll add mushrooms.  For all those that add nasty canned soups to the sauce - leave it alone!  I couldn't believe how many reviews I read said they added some soup to it for thickening.  Double the broth/sherry/onion mixture if you need extra sauce, and if you must, mix cornstarch with cold broth before adding to the pan, but don't use canned soups!!!  The gravy is perfect on it's own!

I love this recipe!  I doubled the gravy and the only thing I did different was subsitute the cooking sherry for 1/2 apple cider vinegar 1/2 water to equal the measurement of sherry. Oh, and I added a little black pepper to the gravy.  I put mashed potatoes and green beans with it.  What a great comfort dinner.  My family loved it and said it was definite keeper!

After it was all said and done, it was okay. While the flavor of the meat was fine and so was the gravy, I didn't like putting the sliced onions pan at the same time as the meat(onions got to done well before the meat did & ended up turning black, even on medium heat),  and the batch was very oily. The last step of the directions were simple enough, but I had soo much oil in the pan from the meat and the added oil from the ingredients list...that it was way to much. I should have gone with my gut instinct and removed much of the oil 1st, however the directions didn't state to whether to remove or drain excess or and reserve a few tablespoons(which really should be the case). But as it set up, I 2nd guessed myself and followed through with adding the patties back to the gravy and simmering for 15 minutes, that was a huge mistake because there was soo much oil that separated from the gravy and pooled on top of the whole dish, that really was not appealing at the least. Skimming the oil off was a challenge and it resulted with over 1/4 cup of oil excess. Please take the advice to use either very lean lean meat and/or drain most of your oil out of the pan after cooking the meat, so not to have a very oily gravy in the end.

Flavor was ok... Meat was mushy. To be expected I suppose but it did remind me of mystery meat from my high school cafeteria. Flavor was ok... Not too bad for a quick meal.

Definitely comfort food !!  I got six burgers from this.  Used cornstarch instead of flour and doubled the gravy recipe using homemade beef broth as recommended by some reviewers.    Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  A wonderful, easy to make weekday dinner that we all enjoyed.  Thanks, Anne Marie Sweden for sharing.

Anne Marie Sweden - This recipe is the bomb, at least in our house it is!!

My kids love the meat, but prefer to not eat the gravy stuff. Eh, but so what they are only kids and their taste buds will catch up in time! That leaves more for my wife and I to enjoy. :-) We just love it and have it about once every week and a half or so.

On out first time or two we followed the recipe exactly and it is/was fabulous. We then had a time when we went camping in a camper and had no sherry on hand :-( so we tried vanilla extract as a replacement and it is now how we do these.

Don't get me wrong, the way with the Sherry is super, but we have found that the higher level of vanilla notes the extract imparts just hits our palettes a bit nicer; IT IS ONLY personal taste.

We cannot fault this recipe one bit as it is WONDERFUL in its original form and we would gladly eat it either way - the original recipe - or the modified recipe.

This is the way to enjoy beef, gravy and onions......HANDS DOWN!!

Way To Go - Anne Marie Sweden!!

Delicious!  I did double the gravy by adding a little more flour and a can of french onion soup that I had on hand, but other than that, made it exactly as is, and it was amazing.  So much better than using cream of mushroom/golden mushroom soup like I used to.

Great recipe as is.  No need for any changes.

@Shaylene.  You should have tried it as posted and then made your own changes on the next try.  Sorry yours didn't turn out well, but give it another try, doing it the posters way, I think you will change your mind.

This was really good, I doubled the sauce  and used real garlic.  I didn't have sherry so I used a bit of kitchen bouqet and  served it over Chef John's Perfect Mashed Potatoes.  Yum!  would definately make this again.

This worked out - it was fast and I had everything on hand. My husband thought it was a little salty, so I'll probably use less seasoning salt next time. The gravy with onions made this a hit. UPDATE: This time I used Greek Spice instead of seasoning salt - it was good and eaten quickly.

My family really enjoyed this dish. I didn't have any sherry, so I omitted it. I also cooked the beef patties first, took them out, and then cooked the onions. We served this with mashed potatoes and a salad. Great dish for a busy weekday.

I am defintely keeping this recipe on hand.  While it wasn't something I would serve at a 5 star restaraunt we really enjoyed it.  Very comforting and home cooked feeling to it.  Plus it is very easy with me having most of the ingredients always on hand.  I will defintely make this again.

I made this almost to the T, but forgot to put the Sherry in last minute. I'm sure it would have been good with it.  Husband raved about it and said we can do it again.  I used the remaining beef broth from the can and put it in the potatoes instead of milk and butter to save on the calories. It made a wonderful meal.

Funny thing when I got home last night...My husband requested this recipe...I added a little twist to it and poured an 1/2 of teaspoon of "liguid smoke" to the hamburger mix (I know this is not a kitchen staple but trust me it is a good seasoning to invest in. That grilled smokey taste took this recipe to a whole new level.....Fabulous!

This was a great recipe. I made it exactly as shown. I'm giving it four stars because it didn't make as much gravy as I thought it would have... by looking at other reviewer's pictures. I would try to double the ingredients for the gravy next time.

This dish is fantastic! My hubby and kids loved it. The only thing that I changed was the cooking sherry  since I do not have one. I replaced it with the red wine vinegar, as suggested by the other reviewers. And I added brown gravy for the brown gravy mix. Thank you Anne for my family's new keeper!

I was craving this dish and this recipe hit the spot. I did sub fresh onion and garlic as per another users review.

You are going to have left over onion from making the sauce so why not take an extra minute and mince some of it up in the Cuisinart. Makes a big difference!

This was easy and delicious.  I didn't have any Worcestershire to my dismay, but I deglazed the skillet with a couple splashes of red wine and also added mushrooms. My (former chef) boyfriend, whom I never quite measure up to in the cooking department, said he'd eat it again in a heartbeat.

Excellent - the whole family loved it.  I had 4 for dinner and 1 lb of gr beef, so I made 4 patties and doubled the gravy as suggested.  I will make this again in the future. Hubby asked if I used 1/2 gr pork because it was so flavorful.

Made this recipe last night with no changes to the original recipe.  I liked the recipe a lot, but it tasted to me like a Salisbury Steak T.V. dinner (which I like as well).  I can't say it's one of my favorites, but it was tasty and I will make again.  However, I would double the gravy amounts if you like a lot of gravy.  There was barely enough gravy to cover the meat, and none left over for the sides.  Also, I think next time I will add another cup of onions.  I think that will add even a little more flavor too.

I made this last night to the recipe except I didn't use the seasoned salt since my husband has high blood pressure (used 1/2 teaspoon Cajun seasoning) and for the same reason I did't use garlic or onion salt, used garlic and onion powder.  Oh, and I also used actualy sherry not cooking sherry - don't believe in cooking with anything I can't drink.  I made 4 burgers instead of 8 since we both like bigger burgers.   My husband and I both thought it was terrific. I made mashed potatoes to go with it and when I make it again I'll double broth so there is more of the wonderful gravy.  The burgers were very tasty, not dry at all as I think someone complained of and I'll probably have the leftover ones just as burgers on a bun.  I think the burger mix would also make a decent meatloaf and I might try that sometime.

Great recipe.  Used 96% lean ground beef and that left too little drippings in the bottom of the pan. Will use something with a little higher fat content next time.  No leftovers with a family of 4!

This was very delicious. I also added cooked mushrooms and and cooked spinach to the meat and served it with green beans instead of corn.
It was great and my husband and son loved it.

It turned out excellent!  my sons usually like the frozen salisbury steak t.v. dinners, lots of junk in that. this is much better.  Use ground turkey or chicken and less oil, tastes great plus half the fat.

I'm not a big fan of Hamburger Steak so I can't rate this one high.. My Girlfriend liked it.. I also added mushrooms to the gravy.

This was ok, but not spectacular.  It was easy, but a little time consuming for what it was - you mix, form, pat, fry, set aside, add, heat, return, simmer - it's just a lot of steps for an average taste.  I might make it again if I was in the mood for something salty or had some beef I needed to use, but it won't be in my rotation of things I cook.

This was okay, but not what I expected given such high ratings.  The meat was good, but tasted exactly like a mild meatloaf.  Gravy was outstanding and I enjoyed that, but should have been doubled for the amount of meat.  I think with more gravy, we would have enjoyed more.  Not bad by any means, but not great either.  I believe next time I'll simply make a meatloaf and then serve this gravy on the side.  Much less work.  Thank you for recipe, though.

Very good, even though, being in a hurry, I accidently left out the egg and put in twice as much seasoned salt in the patties as recipe stated.  Thanks, will make again!

This was so good!!  I added onions, green pepper, & garlic that I had put in my food processor. Also added dried parsley & omitted the garlic & onion powder since I used fresh & forgot to use the sherry. Used 1/2 seasoned bread crumbs & 1/2 panko.  More Worcestershire sauce than called for.  For the gravy I used beef au jus mix that I got from the deli when I purchased roast beef--it was perfect.  I also transferred to a casserole dish & baked covered for 15 min. at 450 instead of letting them simmer on the stove top.  They were so tender & delicious.  Served with french fries & corn.  Everyone enjoyed them-a miracle in this house;)  Thanks so much!

HOLY MOLY this was delicious! can't beat this recipe! i ofcourse added 'my touch' so when i pulsed the bread crumbs, i added 2 cloves of garlic to it and left out the garlic powder, i used a whole can of beef broth.  This was exactly how i remembered my parents cooking this when i was a child, and must have hit a few memories with my husband aswell.  He loved it and then said this one is definatly worthy of making it into the "keep" cookbook:) thank you! Oh, and this recipe was super easy! i had this, homemade mashed potatoes, fresh steamed carrots, corn and parker house rolls all on the table in about 1 hour:)

I've made this recipe several times and it's always a hit.  I divide the beef into 4 equal patties and double the gravy to serve over egg noodles or mashed potatoes.  It's very flavorful and tender, and extremely easy to make.

Tastier than the traditional "soup" recipes. Next time I will make extra gravy as suggested, and I didn't have sherry on hand, substituted with white wine and a dash of red wine vinegar. Tasty!

Revised: I made the recipe as follows with exception of using oatmeal instead of plain bread crumbs as I didn't have.  I also used o.j. instead of sherry for same reason. This recipe is worth giving a try. I served with mash pot & corn but had to double the gravy. A good comfort food on a cold night. Thanks for sharing recipe!
Original review: Recipe wasnt exactly what I was searching for but slightly modified it based on what I was looking for & couldn't find.  The original recipe is worth trying though, as I didn't make major changes.  It was a good comfort food meal.  I didn't add the flour or sherry (didn't have).  I sauteed fresh mushrooms per personal preference with the onion.  Also, added a can of cream of mushroom soup (because I wanted to use mushrooms) to the beef broth, which is why I didn't use flour.  I also only had italian seasoned bread crumbs so I used those but would encourage you not to do the same. Otherwise, I followed recipe.  It was good.  The meat had a flavor I enjoyed but I wished I had had plain bread crumbs to use instead, as recipe called for.

This was very good.  I did double the gravy as suggested by others.  Even though the sherry (I never use cooking wine) was sitting right in front of my face, I forgot to add it!  No wonder I thought the gravy needed something!!  LOL!!  I’ll make this again and make sure to add the sherry as directed.

This turned out very good. I worked at a diner once, that supposedly served this, and all they did was fry a hamburger with onions. This is so much better! I doubled the recipe because I had 2lbs of hamburger and used lean ground beef. Because I doubled the recipe I had to cook in two batches and used probably double the vegetable oil listed by accident, but it was fine. I shaped the patties with a 3 oz mini burger mold and got 12 patties I made into ovals like the restaurants. I realized I was short one egg and used a spoon of Dukes lite mayo to help it bind, because it had eggs, and it worked fine. I never have cooking sherry, so I used a red wine I have in the house. For the broth I used beef paste and made up some broth to taste, so it wasn't too salty. I served it with regular white rice from my rice cooker. I will definitely make this again.

This was really good. I didn't have everything it called for. Instead of the Sherry- I had Marsala wine and for bread crumbs I used Panko and crushed Baked Lays potato chips. I served it with egg noodles and mashed potato's to give a choice. My family really liked it.

This was an excellent recipe.  I followed the directions as stated, but didn't have Sherry, so I omitted that ingredient and it still tasted good.  The only thing that I would do differently next time is to double or maybe even triple the gravy.

I loved this and so did my hubby. Gave it 4 stars b/c it makes very little gravy.  It only made 5 very small patties. We ate 2 a piece.Next time I will double the meat part of the recipe and triple the gravy so I have two nights worth to save me a day of cooking.

This was pretty good. I a little more spice than called for and about a tablespoon of garlic to the onions becaus ei cook everything with garlic. I did not double the sauce which i will do next time because it thickens fast. Great recipe and will use again

This was extremely well received in our house. Our three year old even asked for a second helping. I added some minced garlic and sliced mushrooms while sauteing the onions and also added a splash of worcestershire sauce to the gravy. I served it over roasted garlic mashed potatoes with green beans on the side.

I added a few tablespoons of Franks Hot Sauce to the hamburger mixture because my boys LOVE it. They thought the recipe was pretty good, although I skipped the onion. 
I just used a package of brown gravy mix instead of making my own gravy. Shhh don't tell! :)

Wow! This is my new favorite recipe!!! I only left the cooking sherry out (and added 1 tbls extra of beef broth to make up for leaving the sherry out), but otherwise I made it to the T and it was sooooo good!!! I cannot wait to make it again!!! Thank you!

This was great winter-alternative to hamburgers on the grill.  I tried the vanilla extract substitution for the sherry and it actually does do ok.  Only thing I'd say is that it needed more liquid as it simmered, easily another 1/2 c.

This was delicious! I didn't have sherry so I substituted marsala and it worked fine. Instead of onion I used the frozen seasoning mix (chopped onion, red and green pepper) found with the frozen veggies in the grocery store. I put mushrooms in with the gravy at the end. I served it with salad and homemade mashed potatoes. My husband and son gobbled it up!

I accidentally added the Seasoned Salt to the meat rather than the gravy and neither my husband nor I could tell the difference.  We both like this recipe very much, and I will make it often -- but I will double the gravy from now on.

Very good recipe overall.  I doubled the gravy as everyone suggested and instead of sherry (which I didn't have) I tried using a little A-1 Sauce and it gave it a true steak taste.  This was enjoyed by my whole family served with mashed potatoes and corn.  Delicious!

Was a little nervous at the part where you mix in the flour to start the gravy portion. Still learning how to cook. But it ended up absolutely delicious. I will use more onions next time though. Boyfriend & his 11yr old got seconds!

Make sure you drain some of the grease or at least add more flour to make extra gravy.  This was good but way too greasy.  The meat is great though.

Not too impressed with this one.  I think next time I will add a can of tomatos or some green pepper.  It just needed something more.  I also didn't care for the worchestshire in it.

Oh, Anne Marie, these were absolutely delicious!!! It's amazing how something so simple can be so good. :) The best part is that your recipe calls for inexpensive ingredients that I (or any well-stocked kitchen) generally have on hand. All I had to purchase was a pound of beef (For obvious reasons, I don't keep meat "on hand."). My fiance and I really enjoy the frikadelle at a nearby German restaurant, Schnitzelplatz. Being German myself, I am familiar with this dish. Frikadelle are basically a meat patty, similar to these, made of minced beef, chopped onions, breadcrumbs, milk, s&p to taste and an egg to bind. The patties are flattened and most commonly fried in pork fat, but can also be fried in butter or vegetable oil. Frikadelle are traditionally served with red cabbage or (sweet) Bavarian kraut and either boiled potatoes or home fries. I served my hamburger "steaks" with spatzle, Bavarian kraut and brown bread. My fiance and I were licking our plates clean lol! My only change for next time (there WILL be many repeats!) will be to double the sauce. We both like to cover our spatzle with it... yum, yum! There just wasn't enough to slather our patties AND spatzle with! Other than that, this recipe is perfect as is. My fiance even commented that these are better than Schnitzelplatz's! Whatever this is to you, thanks for sharing your idea, Ms. Sweden. :-)

I was disappointed in the gravy.  I found it bland and required fussing from me to salvage.  Will not make again.

Very good, my southern husband loved it. I started with cooking just the onions so they would caramelize (which seems to take awhile).  I replaced sherry with oj and added a container of mushrooms.  I mixed the dry ingredients together (bread crumbs, garlic, onion, salt and pepper) first before adding others to the meat. It is easier to make the onions and mushrooms in a separate pan than the meat. I made four very thin patties instead of eight so it wasn't so small. The  recipe gravy needs cornstarch to thicken or I use a gravy packet if I'm in a rush.

I made this last night and it was wonderful!! I followed the directions exactly and everything tasted great.  SIDE NOTE - If you want extra gravy, then double the recipe. I made mashed potatos & there wasn't near enough gravy for the meat AND the potatos. Just sayin!  Excellent recipe! Thanks!

My family LOVES this recipe.  I'm feeding 3 picky kids and a husband who is even worse.  The only changes in this recipe is I use orange juice instead of the sherry and I use olive oil with a pat of butter instead of vegetable oil.  It's so hard to find a recipe that everyone in my house likes.  This one definitely takes care of that.  Thank you for sharing the recipe, Anne Marie!  This is family favorite.

Comfort food at its best!  Use about 1.5 lbs beef though and shape them into loaves, otherwise you will not have enough they are so good.  I feel the sherry is most important as it give an usua great taste.  Over garlic mashed, hart to beat!  Thanks

I made a double batch of this for my family, and we all loved it! I used red wine in place of cooking sherry, as many others did, and I would probably leave out adding the seasoned salt to the final gravy mixture next time, though, but over all, wonderful! I completed our meal with homemade mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, whole green beans, and a can of Grands! buttermilk biscuits.

We thought this was very satisfying. It's a dish I know as a form of "Salisbury steak", and it's pretty foolproof if you use ingredients you already like, really. I used dry chicken bouillon wherever it called for seasoned salt because it's what I like. I used sake for the cooking sherry because sake (rice wine) is often treated interchangeably with sherry in recipes, and I never have cooking sherry (but always have sake!). It's not a necessary ingredient if you haven't got any to work with, though. I served this with roasted fingerling potatoes on the side, but growing up I ate it on rice or over egg noodles. Thanks for the recipe, I'm sure I'll make it again :-) EDIT: In reading through the "lowest ratings" I'd like to point out that the gravy is only going to taste as good as your broth does. So if the broth is gross, the gravy will be too. As for bland burgers, perhaps some of you are misunderstanding seasoned salt -- it's not Accent or Mrs. Dash; it's a blend of real salt and herbs sold under a variety of names. If you use Accent or Mrs. Dash in this recipe and aren't used to it, you will definitely get an unimpressive result because of the lack of salt in your meat. Hope that's helpful to future cooks!

We really liked this, but all agreed that it needs more gravy for so much meat. Next time I'll use a whole can of beef broth and another 2 T. flour and a splash more wine (used Chardonnay, as I never have or use cooking sherry). Good recipe though -I was looking for something to do with ground beef other than a casserole and this was a good choice.

5 stars all the way. Wonderful flavor. Make more gravy by using whole can beef broth. Just add a tad more flour. Next time I will make patties larger instead of more little ones, and serve with mashed potatoes and the gravy. Thanks for this one!

I really loved this recipe as is.  The only thing I did that was a little different was letting the hamburger steaks simmer in the gravy for almost an hour.  I kept an eye on it and stirred it so it wouldn't stick.  It was sooo tender.  My 6 year-old loved it.  It's definately a keeper.

I was going to put my version of this on the site but wanted to check and see if there were hamburger steak recipes like mine before hand.Glad I did,llo.I love this recipe,on mine I dont make like a meatloaf with the eggs and all though.I was in a hurry the day I did this ,and mixed Lipton onion soup mix,and worcestershire sauce,and 2 packs of brown gravy mix.I then cut an onion up in it, and let it simmer for about 30 min.I sprinkle a little flour in it also to make gravy thicker.My family loves this meal and they are picky!I also do not use the wine.I have to say I LOVE THIS SITE!!!I am soo glad I found it!

Thank you for the recipe!  I did add more seasonings b/c my family loves bold flavor.  I tripled this recipe since lean ground beef was on sale this week and put the rest in the freezer for lunches and another meal.  Next time will add mushrooms to the gravy.  It even beat out my husband's fave choice of the same at a local diner.  Delicious served over brown rice.

This was way beyond my expectations.  I added a little red wine before it was done to loosen up the gravy, but it may have been to thick by my using a bit too much flour.  I was just looking for something easy and quick to make and aside from my husband's snickers about it just being "meatballs", he was thrilled and has asked I make it again in the future.

this is a great recipe for trying to kick up the week night dinner.  I scaled it for 2. Shake it up.  don't make burger patties.  shape them to be a bit oblong like a steak. more special. douse the patties with worchestersire before browning  for a good glaze.  started the onions in oil, but sprinkled with some sugar to help that carmelization happen. and added a tablesppon of butter for our 2 servings.  added a bit more oil for the patties, let them get good and brown,  for flavor in gravy.  Didn't feel the gravy stuff was enough and added more flour to the roux of onions and more beef broth. and sherry.  Red wine would have been good too . But i alwasy have sherry. Served it with noodles. i considered the addition of sour cream for the gravy, but there were plenty of good flavors there already. For the 2 of us, it was more meal, got a great lunch!

This was totally awesome, even my grandson who has Autism (you can count the foods that he eats on 2 hands) ate it and asked for more. I followed the recipe exactly except for the sherry ( I did not have any). Will make this again and again, definitely a keeper.

This was a great, easy recipe. The result is actually like salisbury steak - great comfort food. We didn't have any beef broth on hand, so we used a can of Campbell's French Onion soup, which is made with beef broth. It worked perfectly. We also didn't use the sherry.   So good!

TASTY! This is what I consider Salisbury Steak, and I have finally found a good recipe! It says to roll into 8 balls and mash, I was only able to make four patties that were about the same size as the one pictured. I used extra lean ground beef (accidently) and there was barely any gravy...which was disappointing because I made mashed potatoes! Even still, I just can't imagine the gravy going very far so I recommend making a packing gravy (onion or beef) and adding it to what is already there. Other than that, no complaints!

Tasty and extremely simple.  I do not have seasoned salt, so I used regular.  Also added a little oregano & a can of sliced mushrooms to the onion/gravy mixture.  My husband loved this!  Served with rosemary roasted potatoes & lima beans mixed with corn.  Yum.

So easy to make! The gravy was absolutely delicious! Next time I will probably double the gravy because it was so good!

I didn't have beef broth so I used a packet of Lipton "beefy onion" soup mix and mixed it with about a cup of water.  I followed some of the other reviewer's suggestions and dipped the burgers in a flour, salt, and pepper mixture before browning them.  I also added a can of mushrooms to my gravy, just because I really like the added flavor.  Used leftovers on toast the next day and it was fantastic!  Love the recipes that can carry over into the next day if you make too much!  Thanks!

Very good recipe. I did my own thing with the spices and left the sherry out since I didn't have any. The burgers release a lot of fat in the drippings after frying so I drained most of it off before making the gravy. I served this over homemade mashed potatoes.

I liked the idea of this but as hamburger steaks au jus. I made the hamburger steaks as is, only doubled it and used fresh bread crumbs. I also added an envelope of onion soup mix instead of onion powder. I cooked the onions in the drippings and served them on the hamburger steaks in hoagie rolls and used the gravy as au jus, sans cornstarch. Very good as an au jus. I served it with No Fuss Potato Salad and sliced fresh tomatoes. The whole family ate well and were happy. ;) The elements of the recipe are all there, it was just served differently.

I believe that this is the best hamburger steak recipe that I have ever eaten. I was at a relly super restaurant some time ago and the hamburger steak there was good but not as good as this one.

This was so, so good!  Followed recipe except I doubled the gravy per another reviewer's suggestion & I had a red bell pepper I needed to use, so I added it in with the onion.  It's been requested that I make this again soon!  Thanks.

We enjoyed this very much, followed the recipe except poured just a bit of broth into the pan to deglaze removing the 'bits' from the bottom of the pan because I was using a cast iron pan and don't like to use 'metal' with it.  Next time I will add mushrooms, a little minced garlic, and double the gravy as many others suggested.

I don't care for hamburger steak, but I made this for my husband and my parents and they all raved about it. I did make some changes. I sauted the onions then removed them from the pan. Then I browned the hamburger patties in the pan, then transferred them to the oven till they were almost done. I tripled the gravy (didn't use the sherry) and added the onions back to the pan, then put the patties, which were almost done, back in the gravy and simmered on very low heat for about 10 minutes.

I doubled the sauce using 4TBS flour, 3C beef broth (made from bouillon) and left out the sherry. Also, I didn’t have onion powder, so I just minced some of the onion that I was using for the gravy and threw that in the meat mixture. I  made 4 large oval shaped patties, and served this with the corn and mashed potatoes. Hubby said, “Tasty as tasty can be!” We'll be having this again. And soon!

Instant family favorite!!!!  My picky eaters both cleaned their plates.  I followed the other reviews and doubled the gravy and it was perfect for mashed potatoes.  I also used crackers instead of bread crumbs.

Excellent recipe!  This was made for my husbands birthday party and he really loved this recipe (and he doesn't often gush about recipes!).  Everyone else really loved it, too.  The only thing I did different was to add 8oz. sliced mushrooms when you add the onions.--Very yummy!

I think this is an excellent alternative to hamburgers or rather, just something new to do with ground beef! I loved it. Per other reviewers I substituted 1 tablespoon cooking sherry with 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. The first time I made this I did not double the gravy and there ended up just not being enough. I also didn't serve it over anything. Second time I doubled the gravy (it may seem like a lot of flour but trust me you need all of it!), and served it over rice and it was heavenly! The extra gravy tasted wonderful with the rice. Adding this to my book! Thanks.

Very good recipe... I didn't have any sherry, so I used pineapple juice instead... I also did not have any onions, so I sprinkled the steaks with french fried onions after they were done cooking... awesome!!! Even my extremely picky daughter ate it! I will be making these again!

Sounded so promising... But, the husband pegged it:  "It's just tiny hockey puck sized meatloaves with a sauce over it."  We ate 'em, but only because there was some uber-fabulous cake that we couldn't eat until dinner was finished (house rule). Sauce had a weird after taste, couldn't quite put my finger on what that was from.  (Maybe store brand broth?)

This is so good.  I've made it several times but have not yet rated it.  I always double the onions and gravy.  When I told hubby I was making it again tonight, he said, "Oh, yes!"  We like it with extra wide egg noodles.

Delicious, quick and easy.  The ingredients are staples in our kitchen.  Hubby loves it, will use leftover meet and gravy to make a stronganoff...maybe just add some dill and sour cream and serve over buttered egg noodles. Thanks Anne and to my friend Vicky Lynn for sharing this recipe with me.  !  ~ Kari, Springfield, VA

It was very tasty. I did not have any sherry, and it was still good. I served it with buttered brown rice and green beans. I used ground sirloin. It made three large patties or four smaller ones with one pound of sirloin.

I made this for supper and it turned out delicious.  I doubled the onions and gravy since I made mashed potatoes with it.  I also added a little sour cream and milk to the gravy to make it creamier and added a little pepperjack cheese to melt on top of the burgers.  YUM!  I will definately be making this again!

I really like this recipe. I've made it twice. I didn't have any cooking sherry so I used about 1/4 cup of dry red wine. I also added a 4 oz. can of sliced mushrooms and I used about 1 1/2 cups of beef broth (to make more gravy). I served this with mashed potatoes and green beans. This gravy is excellent over the potatoes.

I made this recipe because I needed something to make with ground beef.  I agree with the person who said "A hamburger with gravy...simple as that."  Not too much to it.  It was fine and I may make it again but it definitely is not a 5 star recipe!

A delicious, easy dinner... I doubled the gravy by using 1 beef boullion cube in 2c. of boiling water. I didn't double the flour because the gravy was thickening up nicely without it. Also, I didn't salt the gravy as it tasted salty enough. I tried a hint from another reviewer who used 1 tsp. vanilla in place of the sherry and it was really a nice flavor in the sauce. I thought it sounded kind of strange but it was a delicious addition. Thanks for a recipe that I'll make again and again!

A definite keeper! I did double the gravy as suggusted by other reviewers.  I replaced the garlic powder with minced fresh garlic and I also omitted the seasoned salt in favor of salt and black pepper. This was really tasty and was gobbled down by everyone-  From adult to toddler.

Ok, I had a few "issues" with this recipe, but probably my fault and/or preferences.  For ONE, it was a wee bit greasy/fatty for me, personally (with not draining the meat for gravy and all).  I added LOTS more of spices/herbs and seasonings (i.e.,  garlic pepper, A-1, Essence, Parsley, Fresh Basil and Oregano, etc.) due to previous reviews and I'm glad I did :)  The MEAT turned out GREAT, but my "gravy" was not so great... a lil greasy (probably my fault).  ALSO, my patties turned out WAY TOO SMALL!!? My 5 yr old luved it and it's still on the stove for hubby to try (owns a restaurant and actually serves something VERY SIMILAR, (sooo, we'll see how it "sits")...I made mashed potatoes with it and even had a lil bite myself and it tasted and SMELLED  WONDERFUL!!  NEXT TIME (I will be making this again), I will double the patties...and work on the gravy part of it...oh, also, I added fresh mushrooms and a few strips of green bell too to the gravy part too (just had on hand and needed to use)...so far, pretty darn YUMMY!!  Something DIFFERENT for hamburger! ~ Thank you :)

We loved this!  Served over mashed potatoes, it's about as comforting as you can get.  I did double the gravy, as per other reviews and added more onions.  Not quite healthy, but on a gloomy day, it will sure make your tummy happy!  Thanks for sharing a great tasting, quick recipe!

That was really great, I doubled the gravy, might triple it next time.  I served it with Mashed potatoes, corn, green beans and it was a filling dinner.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Yummm! I can't believe only 99 people have tried this yet. I would give it 10 stars if I could. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect and tasty! I will use this again and again. Would be great with rice. You will need to double the gravy though. This was very easy to make and tastes great. I'm not that big a fan of meat, but even I went back for seconds. I served with Fried okra. Thanks!!!!

Very good. I didn't have sherry either so I increased the broth a little. I used another reviewers advise & added butter as i also use very lean meat. Next time I will make a little more gravy. Very good on rice. My picky hubby really enjoyed this as well.

My family loved this.  I did not have the sherry or worchestershire sauce but I had kitchen bouquet and a few other things in the cupboard that I threw in- real easy to play with this and it still comes out great.  Also no beef broth but used lipton beefy onion soup packet.

Have been making hamburger steaks for over 50 years, but never used egg and bread crumbs or wine.  Knew it would taste just like meatloaf.  Have varied between onion and mushroom gravy served with boiled Yukon gold potatoes with butter. One of our favorite easy suppers.

This was delicious!  Numerous steps, but I prepped everything ahead of time, so it was easy and quick. Hubby loves meatloaf, so I was pretty sure he would love this, and he did. Made exactly like the recipe, except added sliced fresh mushrooms along with the onions (was so good...would recommend), didnt have sherry, so used white zin. Served with mashed potatoes and fresh organic green string beans. Yummy! Will def make again!

I tried to send a review and it flew off the page before I was finisned!!  The reason the sauce was too thick is that it called for 2 TBS flour and 1 cup liquid.  The standard measurement for gravy is 1 TBS Flour to 1 cup liquid so that was definitely too much flour.  I always look . up standard measurements before listening to a recipe, although I am 87 and been cooking for 70 years :-)

I actually made this recipe exactly how the recipe called. That seems to be in an usual option among all recipe users. I found this meal very good. I served it with potatoes and corn. Although I could’ve used more gravy, and next time I might add more broth. But the exact recipe turned out great

Excellent recipe for a classic family favorite!  Glad I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the gravy ingredients.   Not only did it provide added viciousness, but it meant I didn't have half a can of beef broth left.

Great recipe,this will be a new favorite!! 
I didn't have the Sherry on hand so I used red wine instead but used the amount asked.i also used half a white and half a red onion because I only had that on hand ..I noticed that the recipe although had a great taste was still lacking flavor so I used about half a tablespoon of beef boulion and omg the flavor was on point !!!! Great for a hearty dinner!!!

This went over pretty well here. Made 6 patties and used the gravy over mashed potatoes. Didn’t use cooking sherry as I had none. Good comfort food.

These were amazing! I didnt have sherry so I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire for added flavor to the gravy 
I definitely reccomend making if you get the chance because you wont be disappointed.

My wife and I agreed that these were the best hamburger steaks we've ever had. Even our 9 year old picky eater loved them. This will be a staple in our house.

Good recipe, although I would never make gravy with hamburger drippings. I cooked the patties then after removing them drained the grease, added butter, then cooked the onions and followed the recipe from there. A bit bland so I added a touch of vegetable base for a seasoned saltiness.

I didn’t have all the spices so I used real garlic, no onion powder, but it tasted wonderful. My husband said it was the best gravy I have ever made. I will make it again.

These came out really tender and tasted great! I used half beef and half deer sausage because I needed to use them up. With the onion, I added chopped mushrooms that were needing something to do. I had to throw in some chopped bacon for added fat to make up for the lean meat and I also just used milk for the broth but added Better Than Beef Bouillon and a bit of butter for richness. The sherry was on point! I will definitely do this again!

This was very good and very simple to make.  We thought it tasted very similar to salisbury steak.  I would say maybe double the gravy portion of the recipe if you are wanting more gravy to serve over mashed potatoes.  Delicious and a keeper!

This recipe was amazing!! I added sautéed mushrooms to the mix. I also sautéed my onions with my mushrooms before adding them to the gravy mixture. I didn’t have any sherry on hand so I added a tad bit more beef broth and a tablespoon of orange juice. Definitely something I will make again!!

This was good, and I am definitely going to add it to my “standbys.”  I, like many of the reviewers, didn’t have cooking sherry on hand, so I used a T. of Marsala.  Other than that, I made no changes to the recipe.  Many reviewers noted that the recipe didn’t make enough gravy, so I doubled that, and it was just right.

I was surprised to see I did not rate this recipe.  Not that it needs another rating.  It really does not need any changes unless you want more gravy.  When my hubby finds out this is on the menu  he is always happy, just make some mashed taters and corn on the cob and he's in seventh heaven.  I double the gravy using 3 tablespoons of flour and 2 cups of beef broth.  For 1 lb of ground chuck I make 4 burgers.

Made this for dinner tonight, didn't have the sherry and forgot to add the Worcester, it was still very good. Made extra gravy to serve over the mashed potatoes, and also served green beans. I got a scrumpdillyicious from the hubby. Next time I will add the two items I missed tonight. Definitely a keeper.

I ended up doubling the recipe because I didn't feel like their would be enough meat to go around.  I was pleased that I did because it was all consumed by the four of us.  Suggestion would be to add a little more spice/salt to the gravy

I followed the recipe exactly.  I am a vegetarian and had meat-eating guests for dinner.  My guests raved about this and came back for seconds.  It looked and smelled wonderful.  My guests told me the meat was tender and flavorful.  They were so pleased that I am making this for another dinner tomorrow night.

I didn't have sherry, so I used red wine instead.  I was a little skeptical with addition of egg and breadcrumbs... thought it would taste like meatloaf. Boy was I wrong!!  It came out great!!!  Quite flavorful!.  Also, I cut recipe in half as I am single, but hey...  Leftovers!!!  Served with noodles (didn't have potatoes) and peas.

My husband is a hunter so we always have venison in the freezer. It’s a good way to switch up a venison recipe and it was a huge hit! You can easily feed this to someone who doesn’t like venison and they won’t know the difference. The gravy was awesome over mashed potatoes.

This was very easy to make (best kind)!  I didn't have sherry, but couldn't taste anything missing. Very delish, made with mashed potatoes & corn.  Wished I'd had more of the gravy, will increase that next time!

Seriously good comfort food! Absolutely great! No changes. Just drain some of the grease off prior to the flour.  Lightens the 'belly' feel a bit after eating.  Good stuff.

This is so great!  I used to love TV dinners of this as a kid.over the years I’ve tried other recipes but they never came close. This is it!  Instead of the broth I used mushroom soup (not. Cream of mushroom) just Golden Mushroom,  and a dry packet of Onion soup mix. I doubled the recipe so I added 1 1/2 Cuo of water to thin the gravy some.  I also sautéed my onions with my added mushrooms. Delicious!  One more thing, I followed another reviewer and lightly floured my patties before browning. This is a huge difference from past recipes that I think made the difference in the meal not tasting like burgers with gravy over the top. Yum yum!

very good recipe.  I didnt have any alcohol, so I had to omit that, but otherwise I followed to a tee, and it came out delish!  Nice change from boring meatloaf, when you're on a strict budget..ty

It is a really easy and delicious dish. Super classic, sauce can get thick but  honestly I'm a fan of a little more sauce so I just add a bit more of everything to it any way. Dish served on top of sour cream and chive mashed potatoes is my favorite way to consume. Also good if you want to add mushrooms in the gravy. I put them in the pan with a bit more oil after taking out the meat and onion and than add gravy ingredients.

Excellent. Very easy to make. I have never bought cooking sherry before, but it was easy to find at our basic no-frills grocery store. It was only $3.99 and I’m sure the bottle will get used up soon because this is definitely worth making again. I did double the ingredients for the gravy and I’m very glad that I did because we did not have any leftover. My husband said it definitely reminded him of childhood. I also made mashed potatoes, green beans and fresh corn on the cob. Perfect southern dish!!  Y’all should try it!

This is my 3rd recipe cooked from Allrecipes and HOLY COW, these are good. I cooked mine a little more than called for without realizing it and also stuck with the smaller 8 patties. The gravy goes really well with the steaks and the overall meal was delightful. There were NO LEFTOVERS. This is a winner for sure. Followed the recipe exactly other than covering and letting simmer since I'd overdone the steaks in the first phase. Overall a great meal I plan on fixing when I need good, home-cooked meal.

I will make this again and again. It was a big hit with the family. 

I used grass-fed beef and added 1tsp seasoned salt to the gravy, and it turned out terrific. 

The gravy is a bit sparse, so I strongly recommend doubling it.

Always looking for a new recipe on using ground beef.  I followed the changes that the most helpful review (flouring the patties and adding milk to make the gravy).  It turned out really good and will be making it again.

We really enjoyed this recipe. It was filling served with mashed potatoes. We did triple the gravy recipe to ensure we had enough for the gravy. Next time we will add mushrooms for even more flavor.

I didn't use the onion & garlic powders , flour or sherry. Instead I used 1 tsp of dry mustard, 1 tbs of ketchup. I added mushrooms to the gravy (which I wasn't sure if  my cast-iron skillet would hold the mushrooms and onions and 6 steaks) . I  used a corn starch slurry to make the gravy and added ketchup to the gravy. It had a nice little tang to it. I was pressed for time so I made fakey mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach to go along with it. Everything turned out fine. I will indeed add this to the arsenal.

Made this tonight for dinner. Plates were cleaned! I did make a few changes, either for dietary reasons, or because I didn't have the item. 

Instead of worchestire, I used A-1. No beef broth or sherry, so I just used water and corn starch to make the gravy smooth. Added more garlic powder and seasoned salt while mixing it up. 

With even the 7 yr old loving it, I will be making this again!

Definitely double the gravy. I used red wine vinegar instead of sherry because that’s what I had, and added about a teaspoon of Worcestershire to the gravy. Turned it great, just like my moms :) my 5 yo and 1 yo liked as much as my husband. Winner for us!

Not a fan of this recipe. Made it as written. The meat didn’t have a good flavor but rather tasted kind of bland, considering all of the ingredients. The sauce wasn’t that good either. Just blah. I was actually surprised that it had such good reviews. My family weren’t fans of this recipe either. Wont be making this again .

SO SO good! I made it exactly as the recipe called for, only tripling it instead since I have 4 hungry boys & a husband to feed. They all agreed that it is now one of their most favorite dishes that I make. This is true comfort food!

Absolutely loved this recipe. Made it exactly as it is written and was not disappointed. Very easy to make and you don't have to buy a bunch of expensive ingredients.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for, minus the sherry. It was delicious.  I will make this again.

Only thing I changed was to substitute red wine vinegar for the sherry. It was okay but next time I will ramp up the seasonings as we found it rather bland.

This is a dish I remember my Mom fixing as far back as the '50s. It's always been one of our favorite meals. She always served it over toast which I sometimes do too or with mashed potatoes. One thing she did differently, which I think improves it, is to reserve part of the ground meat before making the patties & brown that to add in with the gravy. It makes one fine meal!

I made this tonight for dinner and it turned out really good. I did not have any sherry, but other than omitting that I made it exactly as written, but had to use more beef broth as the gravy was thickening too much. . It's just my husband and me so we'll be having the rest in a few days or freeze for later on. Very good meal.. Much thanks

Was looking for something that wasn't Italian and needed to fix it fast. This was the perfect choice. Impressed my husband with how quickly I could throw a meal together : ) 
Didn't have onion powder so chopped up some of the onion for the pattie mix, also threw in some baby bella mushrooms. Moist and yummy. Served with mash potatoes and brussel sprouts for a hearty meal.

I followed the recipe pretty much, only omitted the sherry because I didn't have it.  It was delicious!  
Changes: 
I did follow another reviewer's tip of rolling it in potato starch (they did flour but I'm gluten free) and it gave it a nice crust. AND I doubled the gravy and I am so glad because there almost wasn't enough left!  (We like to sop with bread.) And as admitted above, no sherry.

Things I might change going forward:  Watch the time that I cook them, add another egg to amp up the moistness factor as ours crumbled a bit more than I'd like.  Also, I formed 6 balls (instead of the suggested 8 from the recipe) and they weren't very big.  I'd probably make 4 good sized ones.  Or just straight up double the recipe and freeze the uncooked patties for a quick meal....that's an idea!

The only ingredient I did not have on hand was the sherry . This was a very good recipe ! Three Kids and two grown men  gobbled everything up. Lots of compliments . We had this with fresh mash potatoes  and gravy with a side salad. Perfect for a winter meal after a hard day of playing in the snow!!

Very tasty hamburger meal that we made tonight with mashed potatoes and green beans. Made as specified MINUS the cooking sherry, and used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil. We loved this hamburger recipe it did taste like salisbury steak! I did forget to add my onions to the hamburger cooking so I just cooked the onions with the flour, drippings and broth, cooked those an extra 4minutes then added the cooked patties to simmer. Still turned out tasty!

Delicious!  
I hate when people make changes THEN go on to give a low rating based upon their changes.  LOL. It's just silly.  Recipe is great as it.  Made it twice.  2nd time around made a few personal adjustments: 
1. Double the gravy for topping the mashed potatoes (or egg noodles, rice, etc.). You will be so glad you did!
2. I added fresh mushrooms; 8 oz.
3. I sauteed the onions and mushrooms with a little olive oil, prior to Frying the burgers, and I sat them aside while frying several batches of burgers. Once the burgers were fried and removed, I added the sauteed onions and mushrooms back into the pan with the burger Grease for only a minute before adding the flour.
Great recipe!  Was a big hit with everyone (and I have a VERY picky 6 year old who normally has this weird aversion to beef; especially given his surroundings/family members. lol).

(Note to self: Triple this recipe for a 2-night meal for your 4 beef eaters)

I made these exactly like the recipe states except I added fresh minced garlic because my family loves garlic and didn't add sherry because I don't like it. They turned out perfect and were really easy to make, everyone loved this meal. I served with mashed potatoes and beef gravy  and a side of mixed veggies. Thanks for the great recipe, I'll definitely make this again.

I made this for my mom and dad for Father's Day meal because anything with gravy is at the top of his list. I made it exactly by the recipe. The only thing I did different was to caramelize the onions separately and keep them separate in another dish because of my picky children. It turned out wonderful. Exactly what I was hoping for. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

I made this almost exactly as is.  I did caramelize the onions in a separate pan then added them to the pan after the patties were cooked to make the gravy.   I used the sherry to deglaze the pan then I made extra gravy.  I served with sour cream and chive mashed potatoes and sweet corn.  The whole family loved it.

I made the recipe for myself and my 5 year old Granddaughter. We loved it!! The only thing that was different is I did not have any Sherry. Other than that everything was made the same. Next time I will use Sherry or red wine. If you have kids they will love this!!

Love this recipe!! I made it exactly as possible, didn't have garlic powder so added minced garlic still yummy!!
Wanted to try something other than hamburgers or meatloaf and this recipe did the trick.
The gravy was so awesome, first time I cook with cooking sherry.
I made it with sweet potato fries, very good combo.
My tummy is happy :)

Loved it, added mushrooms with the onions after browning the meat patties. I put them in a 325 oven while making the gravy and poured it over the patties and baked for 30 min. Turned out fantabulous!

We used ground deer meat because that is what we had. We also omitted the Sherry. Excellent and easy. My only suggestion is you may want to double the sauce portion of the recipe if you like a lot of sauce. The sauce makes enough but just barely.

This has become a staple in our home and one of my husband's favorite meals. I have made it many times and have made a few minor changes along the way. I double the gravy, except the seasoned salt - I leave that at 1/2tsp. I cook the "steaks" on the first side and flip before adding the onion. This way they brown evenly on both sides instead of steaming on the onions. I just cook the onions a little after removing the steaks to soften them. I use one large onion, which is about double what it calls for.  Otherwise - we love it as is!!

I make this "as is"all the time and it's absolutely delicious! A lot of people are leaving out the sherry though and missing out on the depth it adds to the gravy! :D I never change a thing! Serve with mashed potatoes, veggies, and a roll to soak up the extra gravy with!

I did not add wine because I drank it while making the recipe.  Overall I added mushrooms and some extra broth to get lots of gravy.  Will make again with or without the wine.

I made this recipe on 08/02/2015. And, I agree with one of the previous reviewers that it isn't fair to rate a recipe based on your changes. So, I made this recipe as instructed. The only change I made was to double the sauce ingredients, because I wanted enough to put on top of mashed potatoes. This was delicious! I felt like the cooking sherry was a wonderful addition and added great flavor. Because I had to cook two batches of "steaks," next time I would add the onions to the second batch so that they don't overcook. Can't wait to make this again.

Yum! The only thing I did differently was to omit the Worcestershire sauce, because I didn't have any. This was a good, easy meal that satisfied and comforted. Made me feel like I was eating something my grandma would have made in the 1960s.

I've been making this recipe for a while now and it is amazing. It's so good I have to double it in order to get any for myself lol. I also quadruple the gravy so we have plenty for the mashed potatoes. Serve this with mashed potatoes, yeast rolls, and a green veggie like Lima beans/asparagus and you will have one very happy family.

I cannot tell you how many times my husband asks for this recipe. Ever since I started making it back in November 2014, he asks for it at least once every two weeks (or more). Even the leftovers he loves and he hates leftover! This is a great recipe.

made exactly as written. it was okay nothing I'd be excited to make again for myself anytime soon, but hubby enjoyed it and said future kids would enjoy this. would Def suggest people make twice the amt of onions and contents of the " gravy" in the recipe bc it does get pretty low once u simmer for that last 15 min.

The best Salisbury steak on here! I love that it doesn't use any canned or boxed soups and gravy. I used a cornstarch slurry instead of flour, and doubled the recipe. I didn't have the cooking sherry, but I used a couple drops of soy sauce just to add the browning flavor, so I left out the salt and just used garlic and pepper in the gravy for seasoning. This reminds me of the old tv dinners we had as kids, so I served them in retro divider plates with mashed potatoes and corn. My kids loved it!

Made as written, served with mashed potatoes. The gravy is yummy so if you have enough broth you should double the recipe. Very good for a day when soft foods were necessary.

We love this recipe!  After I brown the patties I put them in the slow cooker, then proceed with everything else. I do add in a packet of brown gravy mix and some fresh mushroom with the broth, let it all thicken up and then pour it over the patties.  A few hours on low and dinner is set!  The last time I made this I had some leftover mashed potatoes that I turned into potato pancakes, served the burger on the pancake with the gravy, onion, and mushrooms, DELICIOUS!!

Aside from the cooking sherry, I make this recipe exactly as written.  I use Worcestershire instead of sherry (I keep forgetting to pick some up at the store).  But it still taste amazing.  I have a big family, so I always double the recipe.  Its a big hit, one of the families favorite dinners.

I really liked this recipe after cooking tonight and will cook again!! Cooked in my cast iron pot that I think really helped it all coke together.  I did do not follow recipe exactly.  First off I did not use the sherry.  I did increase  the spice/heat by using hot & spicy bread crumbs, also used hot slap ya mama seasoning for the salt portion, and of course a little cayenne red pepper as well.  Had the exact heat I like and wanted in the recipe and also helped the onions and gravy taste better.

Good.  We liked it.  Nothing too special.  I doubled the broth to make more gravy, but it still was not enough gravy.  The flavor of the gravy, however, was very good.

This recipe is spot on, just like my grandmother made, trouble is I did not like it then nor do I now.  I did make this for my 80 something parents and they about lost their minds, can't remember when they enjoyed a meal so much. I followed the recipe exactly as written; no changing this or that. They requested I make it for their friends next week only this time I should cook the vegetables right.  So, if you want to do something nice for your mom and dad make this meal and remember to turn those vegetables into mush.

First time making this. I didn't have any sherry, so I tried the vanilla tip I saw posted earlier... 1tspn of vanilla instead of 1tbspn sherry. It was delicious! Everyone enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again!

Made this almost exactly as directed but used ground turkey in place of beef. Served with red skinned mashed potatoes and corn, made for a tastier version of the frozen tv dinner. Will definitely make again, also a good substitute for a meatloaf & gravy craving :)

Absolutely love this recipe.  The only changes I make is that I double the gravy.  It is the ONLY "real" dinner my 5 year old will eat without any complaints.  In fact we had to start doubling the recipe itself after a couple of "THERE'S NO MORE MEAT?!?!" meltdowns.   So simple too.

Loved this recipe! I didn't have cooking sherry, so I used white cooking wine and I doubled the gravy and served it with mashed potatoes. It was very good. Definitely making this one again.

Great recipe! I used Johnsonville Italian Sausage in the place of hamburger which gave this recipe a nice bangers and mash like flavor. I also used chicken broth instead of beef (due to allergy) and rice flour instead of all purpose to make it gluten free. I skipped the sherry all together like some other reviewers and did not miss it.

Super fantastic. My family destroyed every last bite. I served with smashed potatoes and brown sugar & buttered sliced carrots. Got it on the table in an hour. Worth the effort.

It was good.  Probably would have been better workout the vegetable oil.  The gravy was a little greasy.  Next time I'll leave that out.  The hamburger had enough grease in it alone.

Too salty for my liking. Next time I will omit the Worcestershire sauce and the salt, it over powers the other ingredients. It's like eating Chinese food and adding too much soy sauce, all u taste is the salty flavor.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was excellent.  It is a great weeknight meal.  My picky husband and kids loved it! I did do one thing...I doubled the broth and flour to have more gravy.

The taste was good but there was not enough pepper in the recipe. All you taste is the salt in the meat and in the gravy. Need to add more pepper to both parts. Otherwise it was great. The meat was tender and the gravy smooth with sheen.

I doubled this, I don't think 1 lb will make 8 patties.  I made about 6 (LARGE) with 2 lbs.  and I doubled everything else.  it was wonderful.  we will make it again for sure.

I absolutely adore these and so does the hubby! We have made them twice now since discovering the recipe about a week ago. I don't have cooking sherry so I've omitted that thus far :) the first time I added some vanilla extract instead and the 2nd time I didn't. It was good both ways! I use green onions, the entire bundle including the white parts instead of a regular onion and we love it this way. The 2nd time I made it I added half a lb of hamburger more and half of each ingredient more so that we got more patties. I found it makes 8 if you do that, as we like our patties to be of a good size :) The sauce comes out perfect!! Adding pics as well :)

I really like this recipe! The one thing I did change is that I added the flour after the broth and the sherry...it made it easier to get up the onions and bits off the bottom and prevented the flour from clumping. Very easy to make, I made one batch for my father and the other for me and my husband.

This is fabulous--not in a sophisticated way, but in a down-home, comfort food way.  I followed the recipe, but doubled the gravy so there would be plenty for the mashed potatoes I made to go with it.  The family loved it.  Next time, I think I will add mushrooms as well.  Thank you for submitting such a wonderful recipe for others to enjoy!

Found this recipe yesterday and made it for dinner today.  My husband was VERY pleased with it.  Our daughter didn't really like the meat, but she's weird about ground beef.  She liked the gravy (without onions) over her mashed potatoes.  I've been looking for a Salisbury Steak recipe because my husband likes it so much, but they always seem to call for a can of soup, jar of gravy, or some sort of powdered mix.  I avoid those things when possible, so I was thrilled to find this recipe.  We try to do reduced sodium, so I used less salt in the meat.  While cooking I realized I didn't have beef broth, so I used reduced sodium chicken broth.  I skipped the season salt in the gravy and added a little beef "Better than Bouillon."  Everything was good.  I will increase the gravy next time, for the mashed potatoes.  ~~Thanks for the recipe!

This was AWESOME!!!! I have been searching for years for a recipe like this, I have tried many. When my husband saw what I was making he looked like I handed down a death sentence! After dinner he asked me to save the leftovers!!!!  I did use fresh garlic and onion (threw cloves of garlic and chunks of onion in the mini-chopper before adding to the burger). I also used Worcestershire in place of the cooking sherry (never did like cooking sherry- LOVE the real thing though:) as suggested by others. Thank you so much Anne Marie

Made this recipe as written other than substituting olive oil for the vegetable oil.  It was OK, but nothing special.  Once I took the hamburger patties out and added the flour, found the gravy to be way too thick.  Used additional beef broth to try to dilute it.  Again, the final result was OK, but I won't be making it again.

Excellent! And so easy! A versatile recipe that will easily adjust to whatever is on hand. Didn't have seasoned salt so used Penzy's Northwoods blend; let the beef mixture (1.25 lbs.) sit for a couple of hours in the fridge; gravy was a little thick so added 1/2 cup more broth. Hubby loved it!

So delicious! I follow the recipe exactly minus the sherry as I never have it on hand (and I usually add in mushrooms). Still tastes great. This recipe is the perfect last minute meal as the ingredients are basically always available.

I made this recipe as written except thankfully I took the advice of another reviewer and doubled the gravy. This is a hearty, flavorful and delicious dinner. It is what we call in my family, " a do-over".

4.5 Stars: This is a good hamburger steak and gravy recipe.  I do not use the sherry or onions, and my family prefers a packet of brown gravy mix to be made as well.

This worked great with ground venison.  We cook a lot of wild game. Since I used ground venison in the recipe, I prepared meat, used a little extra Worcestershire, then let it sit in refrigerator for about 4 hours to let Worcestershire soak in. I did not use sherry.  It was excellent!  After removing meat from skillet, there is no fat (a big bonus with venison), so I had to add vegetable oil to skillet in order to make gravy.  We will use this recipe again and again.

Very good and so easy to make. I made up the patties the night before so all I had to do when I got home was fry them up and make the gravy. :) I followed the recipe as stated.

Wow!  Best hamburger steak ever.  I added sauteed mushrooms and replaced the sherry (don't care for it) with 1 teaspoon of worchestershire in the gravy.  So good!

This is a nice dish but could have used a little more seasoning for us.  I didn’t have any sherry so I added a little red wine and it worked out very well.

Very good recipe.  My picky eater actually requested seconds.  The only modification made to the original recipe was to omit the sherry.  I missed the part about adding the onions to the oil with the hamburger patties so I just cooked them after I finished browning the patties.  I also browned the flour for a darker color and richer flavor.  All in all, this was a wonderful recipe that hit the spot and didn't call for a lot of prep or fuss.  Will be working this into the rotation.  Thank you so much for sharing.
**********************************************************************Made this again tonight and I doubled the gravy ingredients, omitted the sherry and it was just ok.  I think the problem was the fact that I used ground chuck from Wal-Mart instead of from a local grocer that butchers their meat.  I highly recommend that you use a good quality ground chuck or ground round if using Walmart meat.  The end result tonight was a lot greasier than the times I have made it before.  I won't change my rating because I do think it is worthy of my 4 stars originally rated.  Also, remember, the recipe calls for garlic and onion POWDER, not garlic salt or onion salt.

Thanks for sharing this recipe! It tasted so delicious, but was deceptively easy to make. I didn't make any changes except for omitting the sherry since I didn't have any. Served with white rice and mixed veggies - great way to use ground beef. Will go into our regular rotation.

This wasn't something my parents ever fed me growing up, I only just learned I like this Salisbury steak kind of meal when I had it recently at the cafeteria at work. I was really excited to try this recipe, it sounded great. It also smelled fantastic while it was cooking. That smell didn't completely translate into the taste though. It was ok, but not *great*. I agree with one review I read that said the patties tasted very 'meaty'. I realize that's a silly thing to say about a hunk of meat, but I can't think of another way to describe it. I think it was actually the taste of the drippings in the gravy though. I think I would have preferred to drain most of the drippings and add some butter to the pan to finish cooking the onions and make the gravy; it could maybe just be that I'm used to buying extra lean ground beef and bought  lean this time. I also would have liked more onion; I didn't really realize how little there was in the pan until I went to serve. They cooked down quite a bit. My gravy was also lumpy but that's really no one's fault but my own. I put too much flour I think, maybe I shouldn't have quite doubled that when I doubled the gravy. I didn't have sherry so I used a splash of red wine in the gravy and that was good. Thanks for the recipe, I was happy to try it and I enjoyed the meal, but I think I'll try a different recipe the next time I want this meal.

I may not have put enough seasonings into mine but this tasted like meatloaf with a less salty gravy. The patties were also flimsy, but that could have been because I had my fiancé shape them ;). The gravy was not as robust as I would have liked it to be so maybe adding a beef bouillon cube would have done the trick.

I needed something quick and easy for dinner that used ground beef.  I doubled this recipe for our family of seven and was pleasantly surprised that not a single member of the family complained (I actually had three teenage boys fighting over the last piece of meat!)  I added a little bit of oatmeal because I didn't have enough bread crumbs, and I also don't have any cooking sherry, so that was omitted.  Thanks for an awesome, easy recipe!

Very tasty!  It's my go-to 'comfort food' on a cold winter night.  I use the Knorr Homestyle Beef gel cubes with 1 1/2 cups of water and 1/4 cup of flour to make the gravy - yummy!

It was good. I followed the recipe for the patties almost exactly. Besides the seasoned salt I used one packet of ham bouillon. After frying the beef, I removed them from the pan, saved the drippings to fry the onion in, then strained, added two packets of beef bouillon, and cornstarch till desired consistency, re added the meat, and served over mashed potatoes.

Great mid-week comfort food! Due to so many reviews showing lack of flavor, I just added a little dry mustard & nutmeg to meat mixture. Did make extra gravy. Delicious!

Delicious! I followed this almost exactly, except I used soft bread crumbs and vermouth rather that sherry (its what I had on hand). The steak is flavorful and the gravy adds a nice depth. Thanks!

Super Yummy!! I made one substitution and one addition.  I also doubled the gravy and made 1 1/2 meat patties (made 7).  It was a day where I had to run out to do an errand late afternoon so I cooked the onions slowly in olive oil and threw in 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms that I had near the end (the addition).  I made the patties while this cooked and put them in the fridge while I let the onion mix cool and ran out.  I then took the onions out of the pan, browned the patties, took them out and rhen deglazed the pan with white wine (the substitution-no sherry).  I think red wine would work, too. I put the onion mix back in and followed the gravy instructions.  I returned the patties as directed.  I served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  The gravy was DELICIOUS.  Hubby said very little during dinner-he was eating up!

This was excellent.  My sweetheart is hard to please and he loved it.  Followed the other reviewers tips..used French's mush/onion gravy mix, added a can of cream of mushroom.  Used beef broth instead of water in the onion/mush gravy mix, used very little ketchup and a bit of au us powdered gravy mix.

I made this for dinner tonight, and we all loved it. It was easy, and very tasty. I omitted the sherry from the gravy, simply because I had none on hand. 
The other modification I made was to increase the gravy recipe by half. Next time, I may even double it. We like plenty of gravy to go with the mashed potatoes. 
This recipe will definitely go into my rotation of meals cooked on a regular basis!

Way to salty for my taste, and the gravy... Yuck. Otherwise an ok recipe.. Personally wouldn't add any salt to the meat because already the Worcestershire sauce and onion AND garlic powder are salty enough.  I had  to use the gravy I had left over from my chicken the night before, because ew, something about skillet gravy.

Easy, tasty, yummy. If you are expecting something gourmet, you probably won't like this recipe, but if you're looking for simple comfort food that you probably ate growing up, you'll like this. I would suggest doubling or even tripling the gravy and serving with mashed potatoes and peas. :) That's what I did tonight, and we cleaned our plates. Can't wait to enjoy leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

My hubby and I just made this, only changing two things...  1) added mushrooms after "steaks" were done browning, and sauteed for a few minutes more til tender, and 2) added a splash of orange juice instead of sherry (none in house).
Towards the end, I needed to add more flour...  I use a gravy flour for things like this, so maybe it wasn't thickening as much as normal flour, but I must have added about 3-4 tablespoon total, which got it to the right consistency but made it a little floury-tasting.
And, this makes 4 regular-sized "steaks", not 8; which was just enough for hubby and I..  he had three, I had one.  We had to cook them ALOT longer than 4 minutes on each side..  we flipped and cooked them the same amount of time about 4 times.
The gravy is missing something.  I am thinking about trying the "Bordelaise Sauce with Mushrooms" that is on this site next time, and see if it fits what I am wanting:)

Very good. I did the recipe exactly as is, and I think the gravy came out too thick. I would add a little more stock to it, maybe another 1/4c to start.

I have to agree with Flo....why does anyone give a review for this if they are changing it?   Doesn't make sense. I didn't see one poster using the recipe as written.  Must say its a great recipe.

Followed this recipe exactly, and it was absolutely delicious! My boyfriend, our friends, and my father thought it was great! I served it with mashed new potatoes and butterbeans. I did not even double the gravy (like many people recommended) and I had enough to put on each persons mashed potatoes. I did make 6 patties instead of 8. I also used a Vidalia onion (the sweetness of the Vidalia enhanced the flavor). You have got to try this recipe, there's no way you'll be disappointed!

I have been making hamburger steak for years, and its good, but I did not know how bland mine was until I tried this recipe.  OMG, this is so delicious!! I was kind of afraid to use sherry, never had used it before..but the worse thing is never make it again. I also have very picky kids.  They all said it was a definite keeper.  I tripled the gravy like others said.  The gravy is so awesome, and my patties are always a bit dry and tough, these patties are melt in your mouth moist.  Thank you for the awesome recipe, and for opening my eyes to sherry..

Added thin sliced and sautéed mushrooms.

Still love this recipe. So easy and tasty. Love the flavors all together and perfect with mashed potatoes and garlic cheddar biscuits. I had some burgers already pattied out this time I made it so I just mixed all the seasonings together and spread it on the outside. Flavor wasn't as strong but still tasty. Just some good comfort food.

Very easy and delicious.  Next time I will make more gravy.  I substituted white wine for the  sherry because I didn't have it and for 1 Tblsp I thought I could either add water or swap it out.  I didn't notice any difference.

I thought this was pretty good and will put it in a bi-monthly rotation. The only change I'll make is increasing the seasoned salt to 1 teaspoon in the hamburger mix as it was a little bland.

The whole crew gave three cheers for this recipe.  

I did make one mistake.  Because I made a large amount, I cooked the burgers first, then the onions.  The onions loosened up all the yummy stuff that was to have gone into the gravy.  So if you need to do the onions separate, cook the onions first then the burgers.  Then you'll have all the bits for your gravy.

Very good...everyone liked it. I will make more gravy next time though...not quite enough. Cornstarch works well....I stirred it into the broth before adding it it to the pan. That and gluten free bread crumbs made it perfect for those with dietary restrictions.

Made it exactly like the recipe said and did not try and change anything which is the reason I am rating this.  I liked it and the whole family enjoyed it and went back for more.  The only modification I did was double it and glad I did cause it was a hit.

Very good and easy.  I did make more gravy than the recipe called for. for With my wife's health problems I have to puree her food and the gravy helps with the process. Also had mushrooms that needed to be used up so I added them.

This was pretty good.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except for the gravy, I double the measurements because I wanted more gravy.  I'm not good with figuring out measurements and I guess four tablespoons of flour when doubling was too much because it made the gravy too thick, and since I was out of broth, I just added more water.  Also, I shouldn't have doubled the salt for the broth, because it made it too salty. Otherwise, it still came out good and I can see the potential if I had followed the recipe the way it said.  I served this with mashed potato, macaroni, green-beans and corn, and a slice of buttered bread.  Plates were left clean, so that's a good thing :)

This was exactly like the old tv dinners! It is a very simple but tasty meal. I found the gravy to thick so added much more broth than it called for. I also don't have sherry so I took someone's suggestion and used orange juice. Worked out fine. Will make this again for sure!

I made these last night and my husband LOVED them! The gravy was a little too oily but I added a can of french onion soup and some more flour and it turned out amazing! He asked for seconds! I am not a cook by any means, so when he asks for more it was certainly good! Great job on the recipe!

I made this exactly like the recipe and it was outstanding!  My husband said "my only input is don't change a thing.  It was perfect."  So there ya go!  It was for two people but if I was making for any more I would double the gravy but for two it was just the right amount.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

Love this awesome recipe and I gave it two thumbs up.  I did adjust the recipe a bit by adding 1 teaspoon soy sauce to the ground beef mixture and adding 1 pint of sliced mushrooms in between browning the patties.  For beef broth, I used one can instead of 1 cup and for the bread crumbs, I used Italian bread crumbs instead. I serve this dish with jasmine rice...SO YUM.  Thanks Anne Marie for sharing this very easy and very delicious recipe~

I loved this recipie, I am a young cook, 16. I cook for my family on saturdays and this makes a great dinner. Its cheap, and easy. I used leaner beef/ ground turkey, for less fat content.

Delish! It definitely was necessary to double the gravy along with the onions--and I added mushrooms which really made it nice.  Also, I used Marsala wine instead of Sherry, not as sweet and gives it a terrific flavor.  Great served with pasta. My husband loved it... This is a keeper!

I just finished making and eating this dish, and it is my new favorite comfort food!  So easy, so yummy, I had everything on hand (except the sherry - just omitted it).  Served over mashed potatoes with green beans.  Really good!

This was a surprising hit with my family. I would prefer to spice up the burgers a bit. The quantities are enough for two hungry eaters.

Comfort food!  I'd never really used seasoning salt before I tried this recipe.  The gravy is wonderful.  I serve it with egg noodles.

Soooo good! I doubled the recipe and also added sliced baby bella mushrooms while making the gravy. Delicious! Had extra gravy for mashed potatoes. After I browned the patties, I removed and made the gravy as instructed....once that was done, I spooned some over the patties that were in a baking dish, covered with foil and baked at 300 for about 20-30 minutes. Tender and juicy.....total comfort food!

I thought this was salty and i like salt. Next time, I will not add the salt and use low sodium broth. Also, with my family, I will double the gravy for the potatoes or rice. We are gravy lovers. Otherwise, I will make this again.

What makes this so good is the gravy. Even though I had to substitute sherry for vanilla (lesser quantity). The meat was tender and very tasty. And everyone was asking for more gravy.

I've never been able to cook a hamburger on the stovetop without drying it out. This recipe worked for me. I made 4 bugers, next time I will add more broth and onion. I may try the onion soup as someone else suggested. Nice change, and will likely make again.

My family loved this. Made as written, since I used lean ground beef there was not oil left to add the flour to so I had to add 2 T butter. Next time will double the amount of gravy.

Left out the sherry as I never have it and this was delicious over brown rice. Hubby kept telling me all the things the gravy would be good over (noodles, potatoes, openface) lots of ideas from one tasty meal. I doubled the gravy (except for flour) did not add seasoned salt (figured enough in pattys, im more of a add more at the table if needed) and simmered the steaks until hub got home (30+/- min) thanks for sharing, looooved this.

This is an awesome recipe.  I use ground turkey and I've also used chiken broth and white wine instead of beef broth and sherry sometimes.  I also adjust the seasons to my own amount.  We love gravy, so I normally double the gravy recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe, especially the mixture of spices in the hamburger patty. I used Italian bread crumbs and added in mushrooms to the gravy.

My husband and I loved these.  They were simple to make, but tasted great!  I got 6 patties out of this recipe.  I pretty much followed it to a T, except that I doubled the gravy, which I thought was wonderful.  I also fried the onion first, then the patties, and I added cornstarch to the beef broth and thickened it that way.  Then I added the onion and patties and let them simmer.  I used reduced sodium beef broth and it was not salty at all, which is great because I don't like food too salty - I'd rather add as I go along.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for sharing :)

Only thing I added was mushrooms.  I did decide at the last minute to use a jar of premade gravy due to unexpected last minute time constraints.  Still very yummy.  I'll probably try the gravy from the recipe next time but even if I don't, this one's a keeper.

My husband and I love, love this recipe!!! We eat Gluten Free, so I had to modify a couple of things...I changed the 1/4 cup of bread crumbs to 1/8 cup of corn flake crumbs and the 2 Tblsp flour to corn starch. I whisk the corn starch in to the beef broth prior to adding to skillet. Works perfectly every time! Thanks for such an easy and tasty recipe!

Not bad. Will omit the cooking sherry next time. I am not a fan of the pungent flavor.  Next time will mix onion soup mix with the hamburger and some garlic, then maybe add some sliced mushrooms with the gravy. But is is a good base recipe, but for us was lacking something.

i'm giving this 2 stars because the patties were good.  I did not care for the gravy (i doubled it like everyone said).  i followed it exactly and then doctored it up.  it still was not great.

I am rather inclined to agree with FLO 3/2/10.  The first time that I try a recipe I follow it.  As I am cooking for one person I reduce the quantities of edibles to suit and the liquid parts by 1/2 or 1/4.  But I stick to the recipe.  Well almost....I always used garlic and not powder.  Actually it is no different (except for the sherry) than what I have been making for years.

We really liked this dish.  For the meat portion, I more "eyeballed" the amounts except for the Worcestershire sauce.  I was able to make 4 good sized meat patties.  Mixed this early and let the flavors meld for several hours.  I did omit the sherry.  Added some mushrooms when the onions were translucent. (Prior to adding the beef broth.)  Served with thin sliced pan cooked potatoes and some french style green beans.

I love this as my base recipe. I add bell peppers, onions and garlic to the meat to add more flavor. But this is really good.

Definitely one of the best ways to make ground beef look "posh"! :) nice flavor-both the burger and the gravy. Will be made again for sure! I doubled the recipe and made only 9 patties out of 2lbs of the meat. Love the ton of gravy! Thank you for a delightful recipe!

This was an amazing recipe! I needed to throw together something in a pinch with the ground beef I had and  I had everything on hand for this! Though I dont care for worcester sauce so I added the same amout of bbq sauce and it was delicious! My fiance and his friends are EVERYTHING and raved about it. I will defiantly be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great change from regular hamburgers!  The only thing I did differently was I added some garlic in with the onions and hamburger for some extra flavor.  I also prepped the burgers ahead of time and then all I had to do was cook them which saved time.  Great recipe - thanks!

This was good. But i had to add cream of mushrooms soup to save the gravy. Although i left out a few things like the sherry and onions and i used chicken broth instead of beef because it's what i had. Once everything was cooked the gravy started to seperate frrom the oil i used to cook the steaks so i may do something different next time. But overall it turned out very tasty! I served with roasted potatoes and cream of corn.

Yummy! It's like Salisbury Steak only way better tasting. I thought this recipe was fantastic. When I made it I used a little extra garlic, because I love me some garlic, but I'm sure it would have tasted just as good with what the recipe originally called for. This recipe is great and easy to make.

Delicious!! Definitely double the gravy to smother on mashed potatoes! I used red wine instead of sherry and added mushrooms with the onions. My steaks did take longer than 4 minutes on each side, but that may have been because I used a cast iron skillet.

Thanks for a yummy recipe! My son asks for this all the time which is a huge compliment!

I made this Gluten Free by substituting corn starch (1 Tbsp. corn starch for 2 Tbsp. of flour) and Cornflakes for the bread crumbs (eyeballed it), making sure that I used GF seasonings, my hubby and daughter LOVED this! Served with boxed mashed potatoes, so I doubled the gravy and added corn. This is a great dish!

Needed a last minute dinner idea and this was in the weekly email.  It went over great!  It had a yummy taste and it smelled heavenly cooking.  I invited a friend over from an impromptu dinner last minute and she loved it.  Her and hubby requested it again a few days later.  Great dish!

Fixed this last night and I really enjoyed the flavor of the sauce. i recommend sifting the flour to avoid clumps in the sauce. I forgot to sift and mine was lumpy.

Excellent hearty meal.  I used extra lean ground beef and Italian bread crumbs and formed into four patties rather than eight.  Also left out the sherry since I didn't have any.  Doubled the flour and broth so we had plenty of gravy.  I simmered for a couple of hours which really allowed the flavors to meld.  The meat melted in our mouths.  Will definitely make again.

Very good!  Loved that these are ingredients that I have on hand (with the exception of the sherry, still came out good). I did make extra gravy and served it over white rice.  Yum, hubby liked it too!  Thanks for this easy and tasty recipe!

LOVE this recipe. But a double batch of gravy is a MUST!! I didn't have any cooking sherry, so just went without and it was still awesome. I sauteed the onions first and set them aside, then browned the patties and set them aside to make the gravy. I think I made my patties too thick since I just made six; I'll plump them up more next time. Husband says to put this one on the list! Thanks for a wonderful, comfort food recipe~NOTE to self: additional salt to gravy is not necessary.

I have a picky eater in the house that requests this sometimes!  We all love it...so yummy!  I personally use more broth and sometimes add mushrooms.  I put 4 patties per frying pan, so I use 2 frying pans which is why I use 2 cans of broth.  One for each pan.    Great recipe!

wow very very good reminded everyone of a good tasting salsbury steak (rare to find)... a nice change of pase to just hamburgers.... i used four cups of broth and thickened it with flour before adding it... it turned out to be just the right amount of gravy... also i seasoned it with a little extra seasoning salt and some black pepper... very good

Good, not great.  I would have given it 3 stars but my husband said 5.  Very tasty but dry.  I will double the gravy to use over mashed potatoes, and will try a fattier meat next time.  (I used sirloin).  Thank you

My husband LOVED this!  Super easy to do, and I already had all the ingredients on hand so it was truly a no-fuss meal.  I started making it at 6, and at 6:53 I am laying on the couch STUFFED and writing this review!  We served them with mashed potatoes, and because of that the only thing I would change for next time is to double the onions and gravy as we positioned the meat on top and poured the sauce over everything.  Thank you for posting this!

Didn't have the season salt, but it turned out pretty good.  Nothing too exciting, but definitely a good back up for when we want to switch it up.

This recipe is delicious!! You can use ground turkey as well if you need to stay away from red meat and it is still delicious!! I added fresh mushrooms to the onions and gravy and that is also yummy! Also, try making the meat into meatballs instead of patties and doubling the gravy and eating over rice, pasta, or mashed potatoes!! VERY tasty!! Kind of like a swedish meatball.

I gave the original recipe as published here 3 stars.  With some modifications, it becomes a 4-5 star recipe.  

I added 2 eggs instead of one to the meat and included some diced dehydrated onion and shredded Parmesan cheese as well.  I formed 6 patties and dredged them in flour that I added seasoning salt and steak seasoning to.  Once they were fried up, I used the extra dredging flour in the gravy mix.  I added a Tablespoon of butter and some French's toasted onions (the kind used in that wonderful Thanksgiving green bean casserole).  Once this formed a roux, I added one can of French onion soup mix and one can of beef broth.  I didn't have sherry, so I used a white table wine...worked fine.  I served this with mashed potatoes and a pear Gorgonzola salad.  My husband INHALED his dinner, and my son went back for seconds.  VERY good.  I will make it again.

I've made this several times since learning about the recipe. It's a great way to liven up ordinary hamburger meat. I didn't have sherry, and so, I got out the brandy, some of which made it into the recipe.

I love love loved this recipe :) This is the first time I'm leaving a review on a recipe and I have tried many a recipe on this site. I did take other reviewers suggestions only because I didn't have every ingredient on hand, but they were only minor changes. This recipe is good to go the way it is. Thanks!!

Made this for the first time tonight and it was easy and quick. The flavor was excellent. I didn't have any sherry in the house but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. I can only imagine how much better it will taste with that added. A definite keeper in our house and I'm adding sherry to shopping list!

Great recipe!  I had to be slightly creative with the spices, because I didn't have onion powder or garlic powder, so I used Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb spice (1 tsp) instead.  The gravy tasted really good on top and it makes enough for leftovers.  Will definitely be making this again.

This was just OK to me.  I have been making a similar version of my own with a pinch of this and a pinch of that for years and I thought it would be nice to try an actual recipe.  For my family we needed more gravy and a lot more flavor and we like it better with sauteed mushrooms.

This receipe was great. Very reminiscent of my childhood. I would have given it 5 stars except I had to double the gravy so there was enough. I served this with rosemary mashed potatos and it was YUMMO. We practically licked our plates!

Good comfort food! I didn't have any sherry, and I added a can of mushrooms, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. (OK, I admit that I don't really measure on savory recipes.) I do agree that trying to stretch 1 pound of ground beef to 8 patties is too much, but the 5 I made were good.

I have made this recipe many times and it is my go to recipe for hamburger steak.  It is 5 stars without any changes.  I do make a variation with French Onion Soup as one reviewer suggested and it is also 5 stars.  My only word of caution is to skip the season salt or any kind of salt if you use French Onion soup, because it already has enough salt to begin with.  I have also found that any dry red wine will work if you don't have sherry, but definitely don't skip on using wine.

Doubled the gravy - made it as written - rave reviews from the troops!  Only made 6 patties, btw.  When they ask you to send it for lunch and make it again, you KNOW you have a winner!

Good, but nothing special.  Really just mini meatloafs.  The Sherry did add a nice taste.

Wonderful!  Easy to make - but do double the beef broth and onions to make enough gravy.  Yummy!

Really good!  I made an 8 oz. steak for me and two patties for my wife.  Grilled instead of fried. Made gravy out of a bottle and added red wine and garlic. Cooked frozen steak fries...smothered all in gravy. So easy.....so good!

Everyone in my family enjoyed this however I felt that it had too much garlic and onion powder. Next time I make it I think I will cut down on those particular ingredients.

Have been making this for my bf and the family since last year! He LOVES it so much, he swears he can have it every day and never get tired of it! I add button mushrooms to the recipe and have to double the servings since he does make a meal on these bad boys when I do make it!

I followed this recipe to the 't'. I found it to be just ok. It definitely needs more seasoning. I think next time I will add fresh garlic and maybe some spice. It just needed more. A great starter recipe though and very easy and fast. Thanks!

We really enjoyed this.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I think that a recipe only deserves a 5-star rating if it is perfect "as is".  One thing we would change is to double the gravy.  By the time we simmered it for 15 minutes, there was hardly any left.  Great flavor and we will definitely make it again.

Super easy to make! I didn't have worcestershire sauce so I replaced it with low sodium soy sauce! I also added a can of drained mushrooms. Tasty and no complaints at dinner makes it a 5 star at our house!

This is a true comfort dish I remember eating  as a child growing up (tv dinner that you microwaved or heated up in the oven). I used ground chuck since its what I had on hand and followed recipe to a "T". I read what other reviewers suggested and I did cut back on the salt content. I also seasoned and mixed the ingredients into the meat one hour before I formed them into patties and cooked them in a skillet. I decided to cook the onions down until it was carmelized, then I cooked the hamburgers. I made 6 patties instead of 8 patties. Once I removed the hamburgers I put theonions back in along with a one garlic clove, minced. I cooked this up a bit before adding the beef stock and cooking sherry. Then I used cornstarch to thicken up the gravy and I put the 6 hamburgers patties back in to simmer with the gravy.  when I plated this up, I scooped up the gravy with onions and poured it all over the hamburger and mashed potatoes.  I made "red garlic mashed potatoes," from this website and served this along with corn. what a meal!!! I watched as my family gobbled this down all in less than 5 minutes..I tell you, it was gone right before my eyes. As for the rating, if I could give this more stars I would. Awesome comfort meal and it will be a repeat meal.

Easy to make and tastes great. Sometimes I cheat and use a packaged gravy if I do not have beef broth on hand but I still use the sherry and the rest of the ingredients.

I made this tonight for my husband and we both loved it.  This recipe is a keeper.  The hamburger steaks were flavorful and tender and the gravy with the sauteed onions was perfect (I did not use sherry).  I served it with mashed potatoes (made w/cream cheese) and corn.  Comfort food at its best (and a very inexpensive meal).

Hubby & both looked at each other after the first bite & said "tv dinner". That's exactly what it tasted like to us....foil pan tv dinners(remember those?!). The gravy is salty. I did double the recipe & doubled the gravy on top of that but still didn't end up w/much. Glad I tried it but won't be making again. Thanks!

This deserves five stars just for the gravy. I didn't have sherry but it was still great. I added a little milk to my gravy just to stretch it a little. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good.  My whole family enjoyed it and I love that it is so easy.  I gave 4/5 stars because I thought it was a bit salty and there wasn't enough gravy.  Next time I will modify the season salt and probably triple the gravy.  I got 5 medium steak burgers out of a lb. of meat.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!  I didn't have sherry on hand, so I skipped that ingredient.  So perfect and flavorful - this can be prepped in advance and kept in the fridge.  Then when you come home from work, just cook everything.  So delicious - I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus.

My husband is very hard to please when it comes to dinner. He said this was very good and would like to have it again. Coming from him that is a HUGE compliment. Five stars!

Really liked this, especially the sauce. Next time, I will add a little more garlic to taste and possibly more cooking sherry (that added a great flavor!!!)

One word "FANTASTIC"!

This was relatively easy to make and tasted excellent.  I made it for company and everyone loved it.  The only problem is there were no leftovers.  I think next time I will add mushrooms to the gravy.  Thank you for sharing.

Yum!  I followed almost everything to the T, but I didn't have cooking sherry or onion powder(so I used a heaping teaspoon of dried minced onions instead).  This is great.  I'll be making "steaks" and freezing them for when baby2 arrives in June.  That way I can skip the patty-making step. :0)

I didn't change a single thing in the recipe - it was very good. I will have to use some reduced-sodium ingredients for our dietary needs in the future, but we really enjoyed the taste!!!

I made this for 3 people tonight and doubled the recipe so there would be leftovers!  Glad I did because we all loved it and are glad to have it again later this week!  This is a comfort food dish, and super yummy!  The patties are like little meatloaf patties with a delicious onion gravy... my friend said it tasted like french onion soup gravy!

wonderful recipe!  Doubled  the ingredients since I cook for 7 people. Rave reviews from all.

Update: I made this again after numerous request making a few changes. With the price of ground beef I used ground turkey instead. I used low sodium beef broth which worked out great since I could adjust the amount of salt to taste. Since the patties are simmered in a beef gravy there was really no difference in taste from a beef patty. Great way to cut the fat and the cost! I will be making this again but I think I might try it in a chicken gravy next time. Hope this helps!

Hey this is a keeper, I didn't have any sherry and I didn't attempt to substitute, so my meal was minus the sherry and I did dip my patties in flour before frying, I  had to add a little more salt but the end result was great.  Thanks!

Served with mashed potatoes ...total comfort food...the boys & husband liked it.  Me, not so much.  But, it was easy to put together & usually would have all these ingredients on hand.  Next time I will reduce the salt...I thought it was a bit too salty.

This recipe is Delicious. I made this last night for my family of 6 and we all decided this was a definite keeper. I did leave out a few ingredients - some of the seasoning because I used seasoned bread crumbs and the Sherry because I don't keep any in the house. I doubled the meat portion and tripled the gravy portion because we served this with Mashed Potatoes and corn. I posted a link on my face book informing everyone how great this recipe was.  I will also say that I have a child with texture issues when he eats and he always wants steak but cannot eat it - so this was a GREAT compromise for him - it says steak and he can eat it :) Thank You

With the single exception of the cooking sherry (which I didn't have and subbed a splash of red wine), I followed the recipe as written.  It was one of those "Wow" moments when DH walked through the door and asked "What smells so good"? We loved it. I especially liked the 4 servings; one for me, 2 for DH and he took the 4th with a veggie for his lunch the next day.  Will definitely do this again and posibly try it with onion soup.  Great recipe!

Very Good.  I doubled the gravy and used more flour.  This was a little too salty for my taste so next time I think I will leave out the seasoning salt at the end.

Very moist and tasty. I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the bread crumbs on a couple of the burgers for the low-carbers in the house. I also used the wine I had on hand instead of sherry. Everyone in the family loved them.

First- I doubled the recipe so maybe it was my fault but I found this to be very bland.  Meat was tasty but gravy tasted like something out of a jar.  It was edible but just not quite what i was looking for.

Love it.  Great, inexpensive comfort food.  This will be a regular meal for us.  I doubled the meat and onions so we could have leftovers and quadrupled the gravy - and served with mashed potatos.  Even then, the amount of gravy wasn't sufficient for leftovers so the next night I added a can of french onion soup and couple tablespoons more of the sherry and it was still awesome.

The best Hamburger Steak ever. So easy and so delicious.  The only thing different is that I didn't have any Sherry so I used a white wine....so delicious, but be careful in adding wine, could be too strong....Thnk you Anne Marie

This was so good!  I followed the directions, more or less, but did double the beef broth and the seasonings in the broth.  Careful with the salt if you can't find sodium-reduced broth.  What really made the whole thing come together was the tablespoon or so of tomato paste (I use the stuff in a tube) that I added to the gravy.  It gave depth of flavor and richness of color.   I'm surprised at how much gravy this needed, but it's so good you'll want extra for potatoes or noodles.

this was pretty good. after simmering for 15 minutes all the sauce ended up stuck to the pan and the gravy wasnt enough to put over mashed potatos.  i just added a bit more flour and milk to make more gravy.

Yummy.  Thanks this suggestion.  I also appreciated the substitution for cooking sherry from one of the reviews. (vanilla)  I would have never guessed that! Everything worked just right.

Used italian bread crumbs, ommited the sherry since I didn't have any. I liked this recipe but found the gravy to be salty...So probably won't add the seasoning salt to the gravy next time.

Excellent alternative to shepherd's pie or meatloaf. Added mushrooms and left out sherry (didn't have any on hand). Served over mashed potatoes. Family all loved it, even the one's that don't normally like gravy LOVED the flavour of this one! Thanks for a new weekly staple!

Kind of like tomato-less meatloaf in patty form. Pretty darn good! Might be a little heavy on the onions depending on your taste. Thanks for sharing! The hubby liked it.

This scored well for ease, preparation and having all the ingredients on hand.... the gravy was awesome... but the flavor of the meat was lacking.  I did use 1.5# 93/7 beef... so the lack of fat might have been the factor as I adjusted all the seasonings/additions to scale.  I used panko (Japanese bread crumbs) which I don't think caused the problem... if I make this again, I would try fresh bread crumbs and a little milk.  Again, I'm not sure what the problem was for me...we ate it up, though! :)

I followed the recipe to the T, just because it sounded good, it was!  The only thing I did was I thought 8 patties were too small so I only made 6.  Even enough gravy to flavor a pile of mashed potatoes.  Absolutely delicious the way it is intended!  I wouldn't change a thing unless I was missing an ingredient.

I agree with another reviewer that this is Salisbury Steak and a great comfort food. I usually always add more liquid in order to have more gravy because that is what my family likes. I also appreciate all the reviewers that add their own experiences to the review.

I cut the meat ingredients in half, except I used a whole egg. I formed two patties and had to be careful when when putting into the skillet and frying because the meat was on the squishy side. I also had to keep a close eye on it while simmering, and had to add more liquid to keep the gravy from drying up. I used 2 beef bouillon cubes in a cup of boiling water in place of the beef broth and it turned out well. Everything was tasty and delicious. I will be making this again.

This is every bit as good as they say it is.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is there was very little gravy.  Next time I'll double or triple the gravy.  Also I served this over Quinoa which in my opinion is good by itself.

JUST finished eating this, and it was better than expected. I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I didn't have any cooking sherry. I did double the beef broth like others suggested, but other than that I changed nothing.  I made the 8 patties as recommended, and my kids (ages 3 and almost 2) each ate a whole one! This is monumental, since I've been having a hard time getting them to eat much of any kind of meat latley. This was so yummy with mashed potatoes, and there was enough gravy left over to put on the potatoes too. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe! I will make this again and again.

I thought this was great!  The meat turned out very moist and tender and the gravy was quite tasty over baked potatoes.  I added a can of mushrooms in with the onions and let them cook for a few minutes before adding the flour, and substituted burgandy cooking wine for the sherry, as that's what I had on hand.  Next time I'll stir in some milk or sour cream to the gravy just to see how it turns out.

Hamburger is my "go to" meat when I want something quick and easy to fix.  This was a tasty, quick dinner that I will make again.  Due to the other reviews I doubled the gravy.  I didn't have any sherry so I substituted red wine vinegar.  I don't know if that threw off the flavor but it certainly didn't ruin it.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was so delicious.  This is definitely a keeper!!!  After reading the reviews, which a majority were not too helpful, even though they gave it 4 stars, because something was substituted or taken out or they changed it in some way or another and then most stated that it didn't come out very well.  I learned from my mother-in-law, that if you change a recipe simply because you don't have the right ingredient, you are not making her recipe the way she wrote it as intended.  This recipe is definitely highly recommended!!!  I hope you guys that changed it and didn't like it, try it again, Anne Marie's way, I think you will love it!

My entire family enjoyed this dish.  The meat was flavorful and tender and the gravy was also good.  I usually make 4 patties out of a pound of meat but I found the 8 smaller patties to cook quicker, they were more tender and it was easier for us to control our portions.

I thought these were yummy and easy.  I doubled the gravy as others did, which is perfect.  After adding the meat back to the gravy I wouldn't recommend letting it go another 15 minutes that made the gravy too thick.  Served with red potatoes.  Good Stuff :)

As is, this recipe was simple and satisfying, but could benefit from a few changes, i.e. fresh herbs, onion soup, a little more gravy.  Still, for a quick and easy weeknight meal that will appeal to kids and adults alike, this one is a winner.

I would give this five, but it is a little salty.  Next time I make this I won't put the season salt in the gravy.  We all liked the flavor.  Hubby ate the rest of my daughter's and mine.  I didn't use the Sherry, didn't have any and didn't want to buy it for just one recipe. Thanks for a keeper.

It was good but at the same time lacked something.  Im not sure what though.  I did add extra onions because the finace is an onion fan.

YUMMY!  I made this when I realized I was out of ketchup and couldn't make meatloaf.  This is so good!  The recipe is perfect as is - just double the gravy if you like to put it over your potatoes as well.

I have made this recipe several times.  I use lean beef and am probably heavy handed with the seasoning.  The only change I make is to add sliced mushrooms.  A great comfort food served over mashed potatoes.

I have made this recipe, just as it is, several times now & it is quick & easy to prepare.  We call it comfort food.  Great for those cold Manitoba nights.  My husband loves the gravy so I always make extra.

This was a hit, even with my children!  I fried the hamburgers and made the gravy (doubled it) and then put it all in the crock pot on "warm" while we were at church.  It turned out perfectly!  I will definitely make this again!

THIS WAS OK. TO ME IT TASTED LIKE A HAMBURGER PATTY WITH GRAVY ON IT. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE LIKE A SALISBURY STEAK, BUT IT WASNT. MY HUSBAND BARELY ATE HIS DINNER AND REFUSED TO TAKE THE LEFTOVERS FOR LUNCH THE NEXT DAY. I THINK THIS RECIPE HAS POTENTIAL, HOWEVER I DONT THINK I WILL BE TRYING IT AGAIN. THANKS FOR SHARING =  )

My family really liked this, I mixed up my patties the day before.I did not use an egg, I don't like adding it to my meat, I used a 1/4c. water instead & that worked great. Thanks for the great recipe! :)

My husband is nuts about these; he claims they are even better the next day! I followed the recipe for the steaks, but I just used 2 packets of brown gravy mix.

This recipe was pretty tasty....a nice comfort food.  I added some fresh garlic and dried onions to the meat, and I grilled my hamburger "steaks", and then caramelized the onions along with some mushrooms and made my own gravy from beef stock and cornstarch.  Smothered the "steaks" with the onion mushroom gravy and served with mashed potatoes.

Overall this was good, served over mashed potato.  Quick and very budget friendly.  More like a 3.5 but I'll give it a 4.  The taste of the steaks were really yummy.  The gravy however was VERY, VERY bland.  I never have sherry to hand so I left it out.  Not a great thing to do.  I did add some fresh roasmary and a few cloves of garlic while I browned the meat and onions for some flavour.  Might work well with some red wine...next time I'll try.

We first made this over rice and it was ok, then we made it over mashed potatoes and it was FABULOUS!  My kids devoured it and it's now a favorite at our house.  I add an extra tablespoon of flour and dump the whole can of beef broth in so there is more gravy.  Easy recipe that tastes great.

Good, cheap, easy and I always have these ingredients on hand.  I omitted the Sherry because I couldn't get the bottle open which is probably just as well since it's at least 7  years old.  Next time I'll probably add more broth and maybe some milk but it's still great as written.

So very very good! This was a family pleaser for sure, I agree about making double gravy and I also added fresh sliced mushrooms! They added a little something to the gravy! All in all an easy and scrumptious entree!

I have an unusual "problem" - my husband will eat anything (except Lasagna - go figure), which isn't exactly a testament to my cooking skills.  He rarely comments on anything I cook, however after 2 bites of this, he actually said "this is really GOOD".  I'll be making this again!!

This probably doesn't need any additional accolades but we love this recipe.  It is one of our favorite meals.

I suggest doubling the gravy, however, if you are having this with mashed potatoes.  The straight recipe amount was never enought for us.

I really liked this, if you like onions you can't go wrong with this recipe.  I served this over rice.  I wish I could have this all of the time, but my husband pulled faces since he's an anti-onionite.

A very good meal. It was something different that my husband and I actually enjoyed. I didn't use onions because we aren't big fans, but it tasted fine without them. the meat was very tender and the gravy was excellent. The dog even enjoyed the leftovers.

Excellent! I doubled the sauce using 4TBS flour, 3C beef broth (made from bouillon) and left out the sherry.  Such a simple and quick meal with a lot of taste.  Will be added to my regular cooking rotation.  Served with the classic sides of green beans and homemade mashed potatoes.

This was great! Cheap, easy, and I had all the ingredients in the pantry. Served this with Roasted Garlic Cauliflower and Oven Roasted Red Potatoes (both Allrecipes), and doubled gravy per reviewer suggestions. Would it be politically incorrect to call this dish a Man Pleaser? I liked it, sure, but hubbie, brother and dad were drooooling: meat, potatoes, onions, gravy, what's not to like?!?

I've been making this for several years now - at least once or twice a month. It has become a true family favorite. Initially, I made it as given but over time have adapted it to suit our tastes. I leave out most of the seasonings for the meat - making mini meatloaves with bread crumb, eggs, salt and pepper.  I believe if you use good meat (beef, pork, turkey or any combo), the flavor will shine through. And I really punch up the flavors in the gravy. Like most, I always make more gravy.  Life is better with good gravy. :)  After removing the meat, I brown some chopped onion and garlic in the grease, then add the flour.  I allow the flour to brown just a bit before adding the broth (low sodium or homemade).  I also omit the sherry and add a bit of red wine instead. I add a couple drops of Worcestershire sauce, a tablespoon or so of tomato paste and beef base.  I taste for seasonings and add salt and pepper as necessary.  Finally I finish it off with some cream and some fresh parsley. We like to serve this over rice.  A very easy weeknight meal.  Again - a family favorite.

Comfort food at its best! My husband and I both love this dish. The burgers are tasty and juicy; the gravy is fabulous with rice. Prep time was a bit longer for me, but worth every minute. Can't recommend this dish enough. Thank you so much!

As far as ground beef and onions go, this was great.  Way easy to make.  Inexpensive, And all my kids like it... I did as other reviewers suggested and doubled the onions and gravy.  Great! Thanks!

This is a very tasty recipe. My 22 month old will eat two whole patties. Didn't have enough plain bread crumbs so I used half seasoned and it gave it a great flavor. Will make it again.

Will now follow advice from the reviews about making extra gravy.Luckily I only cook for two, but my boyfriend really likes gravy, I would have to make 3times what was there just to satisfy him!! Other than that, it was great!!

Great! Just double or triple the gravy. Oh, and I didn't have any sherry either, but it was still wonderful!

Yummy comfort food. The hamburgers were moist and the gravy was really nice. We had it over mashed potatoes with some veggies.
Fattening meal, but worth it once in a while, especially on a cold night.

My family loves this recipe, especially my teenage daughter.  Fine with me, because it's quick and easy, and I usually have all the ingredients on hand all the time except the sherry-which I just leave out.  I serve it over rice with a green vegetable on the side.

Delicious! Diner food at its best! I doubled the gravy and added 8oz sliced portabellas.I served with mashed potatos but next time I'll have it with fries as someone else suggested. The gravy would be killer over french fries.

This turned out very good, quick to make, and a nice variation for using that same old "pound of hamburg". I added about a 1/2 tsp of dry mustard. While I served it with baked potatos, I imagine it would be excellent with mashed potatoes as well because of the gravy.  Thanks for sharing!

This is my husbands favorite type of meal, but I do not make things very often that have a pan gravy because I do not like the greasy taste that it usually has.  Much to my surprise, this was not greasy at all.  My kids and husband loved it, and I even enjoyed it.  This is definately a keeper!  Thanks.

I made this recipe last night, and it was fabulous!  My husband loved it and took it for lunch today.  This is such a simple, fast recipe yet cooks up to be real homestyle comfort food.  This is going to be a favorite in my household for many years to come!

My husband and I both loved this. It's one of those meals that my mom used to make that I had forgotten about. I didn't use the sherry or beef broth, but just made a traditional southern-style brown gravy using milk and flour. Yum!

Anna, these are wonderful! A welcome hearty meal on a cold fall night!  My Dad and Husband are meat and potatoes guys, so I fixed these using ground sirloin.  I also sauteed some fresh sliced mushrooms along with the onions and they really made the dish special.  I doubled the amount of gravy and it was almost not enough with the taters too!  I got raves and will share this recipe with others.  These might be really good with ground turkey as well, but oh... they were delicious.  I served them with Sweet Dinner Rolls found here on Allrecipes and I steamed some carrots and sauteed them in butter, brown sugar and cinnamon!  Delish!

Fabulous, comfort food to the max!  You have to double the gravy,it's so good!  I used ground turkey for health reasons, a little bit of liquid smoke, and a drained can of red jalapenos to the burgers cause we love spicy. Husband gave it 6 stars and he's super picky.

This would probably have been wonderful, but we didn't have sherry on hand, and another reviewer said that you could subsitute 1 tsp of vanilla for 1 tbsp of sherry, and that was a big mistake for us, since the meat came out tasting sweet, which was not good. Next time I will follow the recipe exactly with the sherry. Would have been pretty tasty otherwise!

This was EXCELLENT!! I never thought that I could make gravy like this. I used the whole can of broth and that made enough gravy. I did have to add a little flour at the end to thicken it because of the extra broth. Don't skip the sherry, that's what makes the flavor. The smell was so good that I had to run to the store to buy some mushrooms to put in it so I wouldn't miss out. Served with mashed potatoes Great recipe!!!

Great recipe - will make this again but with one small change.  I would reduce the amount of flour to 1 Tablespoon instead of 2 Tablespoons as I prefer a thinner gravy.

So tasty!  Next time I'll double the recipe.  My husband ate my kids' leftovers right off their plates after they were finished!

Other than omitting the seasoning salt, I followed the base recipe.  I did double to "gravy" as others recommended.
I highly recommend doing so...as well as making this simple, quick dinner.  
We liked it a lot.  Great over rice or mashed potatoes.

After reading the rave reviews, I couldn't WAIT to make this.  I must say though, I was disappointed, as it was just so-so, not what I had anticipated (could be my fault for building it up so much in my mind).  I did double the gravy (a must!) and the gravy was very tasty, the hamburger just seemed rather bland.
Thanks for sharing though.

Very yummy! I added A1 steak sauce to the meat mixture. As per other reviews, I also doubled the gravy and used vanilla instead of sherry.  Excellent recipe, thank you!

I usually make this a different way with a cream gravy instead of a stock gravy.  This turned out nicely.  I adjusted the recipe for 2lbs of hamburger and still doubled the gravy as others suggested.  Definitely double the gravy.  I also added extra worcestershire sauce to the meat, fresh mushrooms with the onions (which i sauteed after browning the meat), and no salt to the gravy.  I used an electric skillet which worked really well on about 250 degrees for simmering the meat once you readd it to the pan.  Kids loved it which counts more than anything in my book!!!

We enjoyed this recipe.  I subsituted chicken broth for the beef broth and cooking sherry and double the ingredients for the gravy.  It turned out great. I made the patties ahead and just put them in the fridge to save me time when I started to make dinner.   I served it w/mashed potatoes.  My family asked me to make it again!!!  Thanks!!!

I'll never use the packaged brown gravy again after these! I never made this "from scratch" before I always used brown gravy and french onion soup mix. These were sooooo much better! My hubby gave this  5 stars. I did double the gravy as per other reviews and glad I did, so there was plenty for mashed potatoes too. I only had 1 can of beef broth but used a beef bouillion cube and water, came out great.

delicious! my husband and evn my picky toddler loved it! I followed everyone's advice and doubled the sauce. I think it's important not to leave out the sherry, it's what makes the sauce so outstanding! I threw in a little extra of all the seasonings as well. YUUUUUM!

My family voted this a keeper.  I followed others suggestion and doubled the gravy.  I used a little less flour and the gravy was just right.  It was definitely a great way to make hamburger taste super and wasn't difficult to make.

It was good...my kids liked it too and thats always good when they eat what is prepared.  I followed the recipe exactly except the gravy was too thick so I added the rest of the 14.5 oz can of beef broth at the end and it was great and had lots of gravy.  I cooked my patties a lot longer than 4 minute in the beginning because I like my hamburger very well done.  It turned out fine.

This was a great recipe.  I did have to add just a little more oil to make the gravy, but I also used the leanest ground meat I could find.  Other than that, everything else was perfect.  I served this with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  This is the best recipe I've tried from this site.  Thanks for sharing.

I used 2 pounds of ground beef and doubled up on the ingredients so I could have bigger patties and leftovers that I could vacuum seal.  Eight patties for 1# of ground beef seemed impossible to me unless they were very small.  I did add mushrooms for my husband but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Next time I will leave out the oil because I felt it was not necessary.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and parmesan asparagus from this site.  Thanks for a nice meal

This was AWESOME!  I had a pound of hamburger sitting out and had NO idea what I was going to do with it until I came across this recipe.  I surprised my hubby with it and he loved it!  I didn't have any onion powder, but it was still great.  I used Tony Chachere's seasoning in place of salt to kick it up a little, but it was not spicy at all for anyone who doesn't like spicy.  Otherwise, I did everything exactly according to the recipe.  I am definitely making this one again!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could...  Thank you, Anne!! :-)

I wanted to say "Thank You" for sharing this recipe. Its was easy to prepare, fast, and it tasted great. The only thing I changed was leaving out the wine as I had none on hand, and adding fresh whole ground black pepper and fresh minced garlic. Great recipe!

Very good but very greasy. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have sherry so I used more stock. I think next time to cut down on the grease I will cook the patties almost all the way, drain some of the grease then add the onions and go from there. The meat was nicely flavored and I really liked this dish except for the grease. Will make again.

Oh boy this was wonderful comfort food. My husband and I loved this. Next time I will use leaner beef, I had a little too much grease in my gravy. Plus next time I will definitely make more gravy, I didnt have enough. Plus I made 4 patties shaped like hamburgers, they tasted awesome! I will make this again! Thank you for sharing!!

Excellent recipe.  If your hamburger turns out greasy, I don't think it's any fault of the recipe, rather you bought cheap hamburger.

I made this almost according to directions - but using vegan alternatives and it was fantastic!  I doubled the gravy per previous reviews (subbing olive oil for "meat drippings") and just doused everything with it, so STILL there was none left over!

These were very good...my husband and son had seconds and asked me to make them again tomorrow night! A very hearty meat dish...I paired mine with some rice and some cooked baby carrots. I would recommend doubling the gravy, and also adding sauteed mushrooms to the gravy. A keeper!

This was very good, but the flavor didn't blow me away.  I would almost suggest adding more of the seasonings to both the meat and gravy.  Also, this is not "steak" at all.  It's more like skillet meatloaf patties.  This was quick and easy to make, and my husband absolutely loved it, so that earns it four stars from me.

Mmmm we really liked this dish - it's the ultimate in comfort food.  I will definitely make this again, but I think there are a few things that I will change.  My husband and I both like our hamburgers to be "just meat", so I think next time I will omit the egg and bread crumbs from the meat mixture.  As well, I will absolutely increase the onions - probably double the amount, we didn't find that there were nearly enough.  Lastly, I think I will try this dish without the cooking sherry.  I have never used sherry before, and I found it gave the gravy a slightly strange flavor that gravy shouldn't have.  It wasn't horrible, just a slight background flavor that I didn't particularly care for.  All in all, a good recipe that will very likely be put on the regular rotation in our house.

Thought this was great! My husband did too.  I just fried them in pan with cooking spray so didn't use any vegetable oil.  Used twice the amount of seasonings. I am sure I will make this one a lot.

Excellent!  I doubled the entire recipe to start (and added a can of mushrooms) - it was a good thing - I have no leftovers!  It's a keeper!  Thanks, Anne!

Yummy!  Omitted the bread crumbs, otherwise made as recipe reads.  Served with cauliflower mashed potatoes and green beans.

I make this all rhe time. It was something my mother made when we were in school.  Instead of the onion powder I finely chop a luttle onion  and sometimes add some diced tomatoes to my hamburger meat or a little bit of spaghetti sauce.  This is also good served with white or brown rice or very crispy french fries. My children liked to dunk them in the gravy.

Used 1 1/2 lb. of meat so I added an extra 50% more spices.  Also doubled the gravy.  The gravy was awesome and went really well with mashed potatoes.  Next time I will use extra lean ground beef to cut down on the fat.

This recipe was great. Simple and yet very satisfying. To make the gravy, I used a packaged brown gravy mix as the base and added flavor with the sherry, bay leaf and thyme. Very easy and tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this dish last night after reading all the reviews and my husband and I thought it was just okay.  The gravy was really good with the sherry in it, but the meat was boring (I thought with the spices in the meat, it would have more flavor). So I don't know if I would ever make it again.

Excellent hamburger steak!!  Easy and quick to mix up and it was delicious.  I used more of the seasonings to add to the flavor of the ground beef.  I served it with the Brown Rice recipe that I found also on this site, along with some green peas.  I was a hit at my dinner table.  I only had a few remanents of the gravy left when I got ready to wash dishes. I will be making this again.

I'm rating this 5 stars because it was pretty tasty and it was easy and fast to make. I didn't have garlic powder or onion powder so I just used 1/2 tsp of garlic salt and gave an extra sprinkle of some "ono hawaiian season salt" that I had in the beef mixture. You could probably add any type of salt for extra flavor. I also ended up using an entire can of beef broth as I like a lot of gravy. In addition, I used seasoned bread crumbs and instead of browning in oil, I just sprayed the pan with Pam. It came out just as tasty and you can add more salt to the gravy if you desire. Next time I might add a can of mushrooms, too. Thanks Anne. Will definitely make it again!

This is a good recipe. I used Laura's x-lean gr. beef . I made 3 larger patties since that is what I needed.Since the beef was so lean,I added a little extra oil before adding the flour because I had very little in the way of pan drippings. I also used a whole can of beef broth and no sherry. Extra gravy will  made next time...We had it with mashed potatoes and peas.My husband and daughter enjoyed it!!!!

I didn't have sherry or worcestershire sauce, so used some leftover riesling and did without the other - it had a very nice flavor.

This was really good. We made it as is, with the exception of the sherry because we never have sherry in the house. We found the gravy was a bit salty (probably from the broth) and there was just slightly too much garlic for our liking, but we will tweak it next time. We will definitely be making it again!

Will make this again and again.  I do agree using fresh herbs and spices is the way to go.  As leftovers, doesn't taste like 'leftovers.'  Excellent stick-to-your-ribs.  I serve with cauliflower, or steamed cabbage, swiss chard, steamed carrots with butter and cinnamon.  We're watching carb load.

I made this exactly like the recipe said and used angus beef. Evidently the great reviews are from people that have never tasted southern cooking! It was very bland and plain tasting. That might be what northerners like but it don’t fly here in the south. Very disappointed!!!!!

What a versatile recipe. I had burger patties that I had frozen, but I wanted something other than burgers on a bun. I thawed them and used them but seasoned them up by sprinkling each side with the seasonings in the recipe. In an iron skillet, I sauteed the onion with some sliced mushrooms, seasoning them also. I removed the veggies and then cooked the patties until they were medium. I removed them from the pan and made the gravy except I used 2 TB flour for every 1 Cup of broth. This made the perfect gravy consistency and eliminates the need to simmer until it thickens enough. I added the Worcestershire to my broth (since I my patties had already been formed) before adding it to the pan. Once the gravy came together, I added back in the pan the sauteed onions and mushrooms, then the patties. I let it all simmer for about 5 minutes. We ate it with mashed potatoes and steamed cauliflower. My husband absolutely loved this! I ate one patty and he ate the other 3.  I also tripled the gravy ingredients. It  made just perfectly enough for smothering the patties and topping the mashed potatoes. This one is a great way to fancy up burger patties!

I added some chicken seasoning 1/2 packet to the hamburgers. I also substituted  1/2 packet of dry onion soup instead of onion and garlic powder, added 1/4 teaspoon of fresh garlic and instead of McCormick seasonall, I used  Simply Organic  all purpose seasoning  into the simmered onions, gravy and hamburgers.  It's very good, and well seasoned.
This recipe will be made a lot in the future. It  was  quite yummy!!  I also doubled the gravy, and glad I did.

I make this meat dish  often.  It is exactly as I was taught from home.  My family of 6 loves it,  It is always on my list of things to cook.  The onions are what make it wonderful.  I always removed the onions from the portion for my children (it is a veggie)
Thanks for reminding us of a old family favorite..

I made this for dinner with mashed potatoes. You’d have thought I served filet mignon. This will be dinner a couple times a month. Burger was flavorful and the gravy was awesome.

Will make it again.  Luckily I had all the ingredients on hand.  It was delicious!  i did cheat a little and made the bulk of the gravy with a prepackaged gravy mix, but let it simmer in the pan that I cooked the hamburgers in.  They were great!  Served gravy over mashed potatoes!  Yummy!

Except for the sherry (which I didn't have), I made this recipe just as it is written and it was a HUGE success with my family!  I cook for 3 generations.  The real test came with my 11 year old grandson who kept coming into the kitchen because it smelled so good.  Upon tasting it, he said, "I'm going to dream of this dinner!" and we deemed this recipe a new favorite, with a "new" name:  Davis' Dream Dinner!!

I don’t use cooking sherry, so of course that was omitted. What I did do was double the gravy as I love my gravy. It’s a quick easy meal for me to make as I have health issues and tire easy. It tastes delicious and it’s not yet another TV dinner type of meal. I’m thinking of trying it with chicken breasts, of course using chicken broth. sounds yummy. I’m about to make it for the 3rd time tonight and I only found this recipe about a month ago. Allrecipes is one of my go to places as they are recipes for real people that can be done even when fighting health challenges. Keep up the great work.

Really enjoyed this, very tasty! Would make it again! Doubled the gravy recipe and it was just the right amount. Made 6 patties and they were a very good size. Did not use sherry or Worcestershire as did not have any.

It really helps if you get a wee tad cautiously generous with the seasoned salt--especially while mixing/forming the ground beef into patties...with maybe a whisper more black pepper in there also. I pan-fried my thin patties for just over 2 minutes each side, just before they were getting that "blackened" look to them ( remember--these patties will be cooking in the gravy for 15 minutes ). And yes--TRIPLE the gravy mix, it's THAT good ( just be sure to add the ingredient amounts correctly!!  ).  This makes a nice come home from work meal after a long workday during cold winter months.

I made this precisely how it says and measured every ingredient except I didn’t have season salt so I used a steak seasoning also I only had a dry sherry so used that. While I was cooking hubby said that the patties weren’t flavored enough (I thought they were perfect he loves a lot of flavor) so I made sure I added enough steak seasoning to the gravy then he said it was perfect.

So easy and delicious!  Only changes I made was to make 6 patties instead of 8 and doubled the onions.  This is definitely going to be one of my new "on-hand" recipes.  I served it with the 'Best Instant Pot Scalloped Potatoes' from this site and green beans.

This was an easy dish to make and tasted great!  I also added a few green peppers to the mix, got my ingredients mixed up a little but it was still wonderful.  Hamburger can be a little tough when it is grilled or just plain fried in a pan but this was markedly tender tasting and so flavorful.

Very easy and fast!! I added mor flour, onions, and broth because we love onion gravy. Personally I served it with herbed rice and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Yummy!

Omg! This was soooooo good! I made it last night and it was Amazing. I read the previous comments about it being too salty and took notes. I only used 2/3 packet of onion soup. And instead of the cream of mushroom or cream of chicken, I used I jar of Heinz brown gravy mixed with the au jus packet and water for the gravy. Not at all salty. So delicious.  I will definitely be making this again. Restaurant quality for sure.

so good!  Wonderful flavor. All 4 kids and husband loved it too.  I didnt have sherry so left it out. I would recommend doubling the gravy to make sure there's enough for mashed potatoes too.

Just had this for dinner and my family loved it.  My two kids really wolfed it down!  I had more control and was able to stop myself after two patties.  The gravy and the patties together were perfect on a bed of rice.

Delicious! My husband and I loved it. I made no changes to the ingredients but I doubled the gravy as many suggested and my package of beef was more than a pound. My mom never made gravy so at 61 years of age I made it for the first time. I love eating it, but never successfully made any. My husband isn’t a gravy guy so more for me! Served it with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. Will ,

Recipe is great as is, i saw many people made this without the Sherry. I highly suggest using it for a whole other depth of flavor. I did do 6 patties the only change i would make is to double the sauce!!!

This recipe was very tasty!  The only changes I made was that I added fresh chopped garlic, and I doubled the gravy recipe. We love gravy over rice. I’m impressed at how easy it was to make and how wonderful it tasted. My family loved it.

This was awesome. Served over brown rice and mixed vegetables. I should have made more gravy like some other reviewers did. I didn’t have an egg, so instead of knocking on my neighbors door, I googled what you can use instead of an egg. I ended up going with a vinegar and baking soda substitute. You couldn’t even tell the difference! The patties stayed together well and everything. Thanks for the recipe!

Great main dish!  Easy prep.   Doubled the recipe for a larger party and it came out fine.  Increased the amount onions in the gravy and presented it at the table in the pan.  Mashed potatoes and corn completed the meal.  Awesome comfort food receipe.

I used the cover with flour method for the meat paddy’s before frying them!  Great call out as it makes the meat not tough on outside.  I also didn’t use sherry but used Worcestershire instead when called for.  I used extra flour to gravy!  The result was amazing and seemed like I slaved for hours.  Very quick home cooked meal with sass!

The only change I made was that I used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain bread crumbs, because that was what I had on hand, and omitted the sherry (recovering alcoholic). I took other reviewers advice and doubled the gravy since  it was being served over jasmine rice. I liked the flavor, they would even make tasty meatballs. I will definitely make again.

Delicious! Love that everything is in the pantry already. Doubled the gravy of course...used ACV since I didnt have sherry which gave it a great tang. Definitely in the rotation.

Made the gravy a little to thick, 100% my fault, but other than that it was delicious.  Defiantly will make it again.

I made it Sunday for dinner. A lot of times I also read the reviews and make changes I think will improve the dish but not this time, I didn’t change a thing and the recipe as is was delicious.

Made as written...simple, easy, and tasty.  Next time I will try it with fresh herbs to see if it's worth the extra time (I'm guessing it will be).

I will make it again. It was fairly simple and tasty .I live in a gluten free house, so I had to substitute the bread crumbs and flour with gluten-free alternatives. The bread crumbs did fine, but the flour definitely doesn't work as a binding agent for the gravy. Will experiment some more next time.

Came out really good but not enough gravy for potatoes or rice. Next time I am going to double up the beef stock and onions and increase the flour as needed.

The gravy was great, however, the hamburger itself could have used a little bit more flavor. Goes great with mashed potatoes and peas.

It was good but I didn't care for the texture of the meat.  Gravy was really good but I would double or triple if serving gravy with each patty.  I like the idea of just making the gravy to go with mashed potatoes.

We really enjoyed this, instead of Worcester sauce I used steak sauce and omitted the sherry, everything else was strictly by the recipe. Next time I think I'll sautee  those onions first and then brown the patties, adding the onions again while making the gravy because there just didn't seem to be enough room in the pan while browning the meat patties. The gravy was too thick but only because I didn't add as much beef broth as I should have. It is very yummy though, truly a keeper in my family.

Made it almost exactly as described, the only ingredient I added was some sliced white mushrooms which I sautéd in butter in a separate pan, drained and added to the sauce before serving.

Really good!  Next time I will double the gravy and chop onions rather than slice them.  I didn't have enough 'brown' in the pan as shown in the video perhaps because I used a non-stick pan or my meat was low fat.  I will definitely make this again.

I found that the gravy and meat really needed more spices.  It was rather bland.  I made the recipe exactly as  it was written.  I will do it again but with quite a few changes.

Super simple only change was that I didn't have any cooking Sherry. Not sure if it may have made any difference.

I used chopped onion instead of sliced. The gravy was thicker than the picture shows and I forgot to add the salt to the gravy. The hamburgers were delicious.

Loved it, But I did modify it, It's "Hamburger Steak with Mushrooms and Gravy".  Also to keep from over cooking the hamburger I increased the initial heat to sear in the juices the reduce the heat to medium and cut the time to 3 minutes per side and simmered for 10 minutes.  One tip, premix the flour into cool beef broth to avoid lumps.

I made the burger patties using 96% lean ground beef with finely chopped mushrooms mixed in, to cut calories. I also added sliced  mushrooms with the onions in the skillet. No other changes.  It was delicious! Will definitely have this again!

The only different thing I did was add two strips of bacon crossed on the patty top and bottom  before cooking .. other than that I did exactly the recipe as written.. I did make 4 patties though as I thought 8 was to skimpy.. I'm only cooking for my daughter and 2 teen grand kids so 4 was perfect.. granddaughter doesn't like onions but it worked out anyway.. should have doubled the gravy-- there wasn't really enough to go over the rice and corn bread I served, next time I'll know better..

Yikes, I  drained the fat from the beef.  Then used olive oil for the rest!  3 stars for not draining the hamburger fat or calling for 80/20 or 90/10 ground beef!  Not looking for healthy,  just not tasting greasy on my tongue.

I used a can of Progresso onion soup for the gravy & a small can of mushrooms, thicken the way you wish or as the recipe. I love shortcuts & it usually comes out the same. I am 78 yrs young, but I'm learning new things all the time. Cooking & baking are my therapy.

I made it exactly as written.  It was surprisingly easy and flavorful!  I definitely will make this again for my husband and I instead of always doing a meatloaf and heating up the oven . I used electric skillet since we live in Arizona and on those days of 110+ degrees it was a nice change from barbecue.  I do need more practice on the gravy part but maybe my skillet was too hot so flour made lumps.

This was awesome. Very good. I used a tbsp of corn starch instead of the flour to cut down on carbs. I made four patties instead of eight and this was the perfect serving size. And it worked out well on my low carb diet. A keeper!

I loved it!  I didn't have Sherry on hand.  But, it still turned out really good.  It's just a simple, filling meal.  I didn't make 8 little patties.  I made 4 so the portion was larger.  No real bells and whistles.  Leftovers were even better.  I would definitely make this again.

Didn’t have any ground meat so I used tenderized eye of round. I sprinkled them with all the seasonings and omitted the bread crumbs. Followed the recipe after that. Prepared dirty rice as my side. Perfection!!!

Didn’t have seasoned salt or onion on hand. Substituted fresh chopped onion for dried minced onion and garlic. Used Weber Gourmet Burger seasoning instead of seasoned salt. Served with roasted asparagus and sweet potatoes. We loved it.

I must say that this recipe was very delicious! I did not have sherry so I used Marsala cooking wine.  I doubled the Worcestershire for an extra boost of flavor.  Amazing!!!

This was very easy to make and very flavorful.  I would probably cut the salt in the gravy.  I might have added a little too much.  Other than that, it was a hit.  I have a picky crowd that I cook dinner for and they enjoyed it!

I have made this recipe around 10 times in the last year. Family really loves it. The ONLY thing I change is dividing the meat mixture into four balls and shape them into thick rectangles. Takes a little longer browning on each side, and simmering at end but we like have thicker steaks.

Followed recipe exactly and loved it! I put mashed potatoes underneath and wished I had more gravy. I was worried the meat might be more like meatloaf which I do not like but it was more like a seasoned hamburger. I loved the flavor and will definitely make again.

Really good.  I used a pound and a half of burger and made five ounce patties.  If I want two ounces of burger I'll stop at the Golden Arches!

Also , I increased the gravy recipe by half.  Should have doubled it, but had enough left for lunch tomorrow as there are two steaks left and some mashed potatoes.

I doubled the pepper, but most of it was needed due to the additional hamburger.  I also used Pepperidge Farms seasoned stuffing just because it was in the pantry and aging.

I make my own game sausage, and so I was able to use theat seasoning instead of a less zingy salt.

DW and I enjoy onions but agreed that I'll omit the onion powder next time.  But for the heavy oniony flavor this would have been a five star review.

Made per recipe and overall a good, simple and fast recipe but next time I'll definitely double the amount of gravy and add a bit more spices per personal preference.

Oh, my! This recipe is awesome. I didn't have sherry either so used Worchestire sauce instead and doubled the gravy. This is so good and so easy!! Good work night dinner. Next time, I'll add more onions and fresh mushrooms. So good!

Loved this recipe. Added mushrooms,little more garlic(Italian) and served over garlic mashed potatoes! One note. Use salt free broth or cut back on the added salt. I used Cajun seasoning salt. Will make many times again!

Very good!  Out of necessity, I had to make a couple of small changes.  I didn't have any seasoning salt or sherry, so I substituted table salt and dry Marsala.  I took the advice in other reviews and doubled the gravy and added mushrooms.  It turned out well, and I will definitely make it again.

I made quite a few changes lol. I don’t like Worcestershire sauce, so I didn’t use it. I don’t like bread in my meat, and I didn’t have ground meat so I’m used steak. I didn’t have beef stock so I made my own using beef bouillon. Other than totally changing the recipe. I enjoyed it lol

Definitely make it again. Husband’s vote. Did make it into 6 patties instead of 8. Otherwise followed recipe as written. Since we are cutting back on carbs, no mashed potatoes but if there were would double the gravy.

This  was nicely seasoned.  (I almost always use less salt than suggested in any recipe.)  I like that you make the gravy rather than pouring in canned soup, as was in some other recipes I read.  I usually bake or broil meats and only make gravy for holidays, but once in a while you want some old fashioned comfort food.  My husband liked it.  Served with succotash and rice.

I followed the recipe all but had to substitute Marsala for the Sherry as I was out and I did 4 larger patties. Hubby loved the seasoning. The gravy was very easy to do and more than enough for all the patties. I would make this again. I would probably add more onion as my hubby said he'd have liked to have a bit more.

Delicious recipe. I left out the egg and breadcrumbs, used the seasoned salt recipe also found on this website, and served it with *egg noodles* (highly recommend this as the starch). The gravy is good and no processed ingredients.

My family loved this simple, easy to make recipe. I followed the recipe  and it looked and tasted as good as the picture shown. Although, I did add mushrooms while the patties were in simmer mode and it just added to the flavor.

I didn't have onion powder, so, chopped up 1/2 med onion very fine,  substituted soy sauce for the Worcestershire sauce, used a brown gravy mix.  instead of making mash potatoes for a side, I make some baking powder biscuits to put it on and drench with the onions and gravy. so delish!  be ready to serve 2nds!

Absolutely amazing recipe! I have made this a couple of times and it’s always a hit! This time I decided to use Campbell’s beefy mushroom soup instead of beef broth.  I personally prefer the gravy made this way, but the recipe as written is delicious!

PERFECT ! I added mushrooms and Fresh garlic (in place of the powder) simply  because we love them. Made some egg noodles and green beans . Double the gravy ingredients..you won’t be sorry ! Wonderful comfort food supper.

These are very good I have made them several times now and  they are a family favorite. To make it work for my gluten sensitivity I use corn starch and water mixture to thicken gravy in place of flour and use Gluten free bread crumbs in the hamburger. This time I also added 1 tsp liquid smoke to the meat to give it a slight grill flavor. Very good recipe.

The whole family enjoyed this.  I personally felt that it had to much of the sherry and would probably use a little less next time,  but everyone else liked it.  I made it as written but did double the gravy ingredients per others suggestions.

I made this for old times sake. Ground sirloin was on sale at the store. I loved it, kids did not. They wouldn't eat the gravy which is the best part! Dipped their hamburger steaks in catsup . Oh well, I liked it alot. Served with rice. The onion gravy was delish! I'll save the recipe just for the gravy it was that good! The hamburger steaks were very good too. Plan to make again.

This was shockingly good with no changes with the exception  of dividing the meat mixture into four larger patties. Next time I will double the gravy ingredients so that we can have enough to use over mashed potatoes.

Pretty solid comfort food recipe, I had actually never had this before but it was pretty decent and easy to make.  The best part was that the ingredients are all things you will usually have on hand.  I doubled the gravy based on the suggestions posted, and cooked the onions after the meat also from the suggestions.  I had a handful of mushrooms aging out in my fridge so I tossed those in too.  Only change I would suggest is double the salt and add a lot more black pepper to both the meat mixture and the gravy.

Quick and easy! I doubled the recipe and made the patties on the Foreman grill and then made the gravy and let the patties simmer in it. Served with rice and French style green beans. My kind of comfort food!

This was really good! Much more flavorful than I thought it would be. I made six patties and doubled the gravy as others suggested. I didn’t use any sherry when I made it but it tasted great without it. Definitely a keeper! Served with mashed potatoes and corn! Can’t go wrong there!

I made this recipe as written, and I can't say that I would have made it again.  I used very lean, organic beef, which made the beef  dry, and we just didn't care for it.    Well, there was quite a bit left over, and I just couldn't throw it out so I froze it.  Tonight, I thawed and cooked the leftovers in the microwave for 6 minutes on 60 percent power.  The result was a moist, flavorful dinner.  I will make this ahead and freeze both portions to use for future meals.  Now I am really glad that I didn't throw it away.

My husband made these and it was absolutely delicious. No complaints - it probably helps that he used grass-fed beef. Mmmmm

Very good. Even my picky 9 year old liked it! I do have to say that if you use 1 lb meat and make it into 8 patties they would be VERY small!! I doubled the recipe making 8 patties (1/4 lb ea). I didn’t use the sherry since I didn’t have any and honestly don’t know if I would’ve liked it any better. I think the recipe as written made a very thick gravy so I thinned it out by adding additional beef broth and season salt till it reached the consistency I like to use in my mashed potatoes.

I did double the meat  part and quadrupled the gravy portion. Which was perfect for the large family we had. It was very very good . Everyone loved it and asked to have it again.

I can't give this a 5 because I used pre-made burgers.  But I  can give the gravy a big 4. It was excellent and so easy to make.  You must use sherry if you have it, what a great taste.  I had some fresh mushrooms that had to be used up, so I added those too.  I'm sure you could use this gravy on chicken and/or pork. This is a keeper.

While making this, I made a mistake. I poured the beef broth into my meat, resulting in wet, breakable patties. I added the patties (mush, actually) into my pan and turned up the heat and covered. I didn't add the onions and, instead, caramelized them in another pan. After removing my decent patties, I added my caramelized onions to the pan. Now, having little broth, I added more sherry than the recipe required, water and some Worcestershire sauce to make the gravy. Preparing myself for a terrible dinner, I was pleasantly surprised. I'll definitely try this again and follow the directions. I think I'll use Swiss steaks. Edit 3/5/19: I made this again following the recipe with Swiss steaks instead. I think the hamburger with caramelized onions has better flavor.

I made the recipe as written, for some reason I did not get enough drippings to make enough gravy for the 6 patties I got from one pound of meat. I always use 80/20. Flavor was there, next time I will make tweaks for our families preference.

This I made a couple easy changes to and it worked out really well. I cooked the sliced onions with the beef added a little flour to soak up the drippings and cook the flour a minute then added 2 cups of water and then put in a dry packet of mushroom  gravy and whisked it up and put in a little more Worcestershire to taste. Very yummy  I loved it and will make again.

Perfect...taste was wonderful and reminded me of an old time meal for comfort food. Only made six patties. Added the whole can of beef broth to make more gravy for the mashed potatoes. Other than that, followed exactly. Will be making again.

The recipe was very good. I doubled the recipe and added sliced mushrooms. Garlic and garlic powder. I also doubled the onions. I added some milk with flour also to the gravy. But only add a TBSP flour to 1/2 milk. Turned out well. My son Said it was a twist on Swedish meatballs.

So easy: kind of a cross between meatloaf and hamburgers. My husband loved it. Added instant mashed potatoes and green beans, so even though I didn't feel like cooking I served a full meal in less than 40 minutes.

Very easy to make! I should have made more of the gravy as it didn’t seem like it made as much. The ingredients were all on hand. Family love it!

This is very good. I also really enjoy making the Salisbury steak recipe from this site.  I believe it's from Kelly Berenger -- and there's some other good ones too.

If you love Salisbury steak you’ll love this one! It’s the best recipe for hamburger that I’ve made.  My daughter loves it to! Goes great with mashed potatoes or plain white rice. Try it! You won’t be sorry ??

Good recipe.  i made a few adjustments.  I salt & pepper in the meat, added some chopped garlic.  next time i would add some sliced onions and put it over mashed potatoes rather then pasta.

I would describe this as a Salisbury steak recipe.  As described, it's quick and easy.  I had to go out and get bread crumbs, seasoned salt, and beef broth.  I confess I should have had these on hand.

Easy to make, and even good microwaved after being in the refrigerator a couple days.   I think it goes better with mashed potatoes than rice because of the gravy.

Great recipe to have for a quick change that doesn't require a lot of thought.

Delish!  I added the whole can of beef broth (10 3/4 oz instead of 8 oz as recipe states), just a bit more flour and a little milk.  All to make a bit more gravy.  Hubby loved it.  "Steaks" were so tender!

I've made this twice now and here's my modifications...
1. Use Italian seasoned bread crumbs
2. Forgo the garlic and onion powder for fresh grated garlic and onion, the grated onion will add a lot of extra moisture so you may need to add more bread crumbs
3. We really like Worcestershire so I use about 2tbs instead of 1tsp
4. I also lovelovelove onions so I slice mine into wider petals.
Both times I've made this I used McCormick powdered brown gravy mix because I didn't have the from scratch gravy ingredients on hand and it comes out fine, coat the onions and scraped up bits with the powder then stir in water gradually and cook until it comes to a boil and then simmer for 1 min and follow the rest of the recipes instructions! We eat ours with white rice. ??

It was really excellent I will be making this more, I didn’t use sherry and I didn’t have any Worcestershire sauce but I have a carton of French onion soup and I use some for the meat mixture and didn’t worry about the Worcestershire sauce or sherry, It was Really Very Good and I Steamed some yellow potatoes for the gravy and oh Man was that ever good..????

Well, I didn’t have the cooking sherry so maybe that made the difference, but we weren’t that crazy about this dish. I would maybe try it again with a few changes.

Used sea salt and paprika instead of season salt.  I would omit salt with the broth since broth is salty enough in this case.

Great.  Only change was used beef broth instead of sherry.  I would not use sweet onions - it was not the flavor needed, regular onions will work best.

Great recipe!  I doubled the gravy so the rice could be smothered.   The gravy is so much better than the packaged; doesn't have all that salt.  Thank you for submitting.

I did make one change, sub red wine for the sherry, b/c I did not have sherry. It turned out fine. I especially liked the gravy. I would make it again, next time with sherry just to see.

No offense, but although this was easy to make, it tasted like diner food; soppy, no complexity and good with a mound of mashed potatoes. If this is what you're looking for, this is it.

I followed the recipe exactly though I doubled it so we could have leftovers on hand. The taste was really yummy. Great comfort food. I served it with roasted brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. Excellent Americana comfort food.

I gotta say, this is  delicious. It’s pretty easy to make and the final result is awesome. The beef patty was super tender and juicy. The gravy had a great flavor. My kids even liked it. We served this with mashed potatoes and my picky daughter said it was tasty when you mix the potatoes and meat together. I will definitely be making this again soon. I may even try it as a burger: patty, onions, gravy, and potatoes on a bun.

very tasty.  Only thing I changed was add a half cup extra beef broth because I love gravy  and didn't feel there was enough.  Served with rice and buttered corn. I will make this again when my mother comes to visit soon!

Good; my husband liked it.  I thought it needed just a bit more flavor in the gravy; I had to cut back on the seasoned salt because of the sodium.  Any suggestions how to "spice it up" a bit?

This  recipe sounded so good so I tried it.  After reading several of the reviews, I did make extra gravy.  Not sure exactly what it was, but it did not taste good at all.  I had intended to share with my neighbor, but after tasting it, I chose not to.  I am not sure if I will make this again.

I made it twice exactly as the recipe said. It's so good that the second time I doubled the batch.  This is something you don't want to mess with.

Made this (almost) as directed. Didn;t have sherry and I added mushrooms to the gravy. Served over mashed potatoes with fresh green beans and cold beets. Will definitely make often  Thanks for the recipe.

Maybe needs onion inside the burger rather than onion powder.  The gravy also needs something extra, maybe some spice. But really good.

The hamburger patties were pretty good but the gravy wasn’t my favorite. The sherry gave it a weird flavor. I’ve used a similar recipe with balsamic which was much better.

I doubled the recipe and followed it as written.  It not only looked delicious, but  tasted wonderful.
Since I am only cooking for myself, I was able to freeze the left over patties,  gravy and onions and have enough for 3 more meals.  Will definitely make this again when I have guests.  I served this with mashed potatoes, green beans and zucchini noodles.  My friend and I both had seconds.

This is a wonderful recipe! I didn’t have any cooking sherry so I used Sauvignon Blanc instead. AND, when I added the wine I didn’t feel 4 tablespoons was not nearly enough! So, I added about 1/2 cup!??  That was WAY too much... stupid me. At that point I had to double the rest of the gravy ingredients to make more gravy, which turned out to be a happy mistake. The Sau Blanc was perfect and this will be a regular meal at our house.

Great taste.  If you're feeding more than 3 people, you should at least double the recipe.  Only changes I made was using red wine instead of sherry and panko bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs.  Other than that, I left things the same.  I did end up making extra gravy using a packet of mushroom gravy mix (leaving it on the side) and it was so much saltier than the recipe's gravy.  Nothing better than homemade gravy where you control the ingredients; especially salt!  This recipe is a keeper.

Will make again for sure.  I purchased hamburger steaks already made at the store, used 2 large onions, chopped a couple garlic cloves and added a red pepper as well.  I had a jar of brown gravy so instead of making the gravy (which never turns out for me) I opened the jar of brown gravy.  Served it with mashed potatoes (already made in the grocery section) and a salad.  Yum for sure!!  Left overs went into the freezer for my husbands work lunches to be microwaved at a later date.   No photo, we ate it too fast!!

This is a “keeper”! I used a finely chopped garlic clove in place of garlic powder but that was the only substitution. Next time I might try a little fresh rosemary in the meat mix.

I don't usually include my changes when I review a recipe but felt a need to this time as this is an excellent base recipe. Diced onion, minced fresh garlic, and a heaping handful of Tenuta's Italian Seasoning added to the hamburger meat really brought the flavor up. Due to gluten free needs, I used corn starch instead of flour to make the gravy. A healthy dose of seasoning salt at the end was perfect. I also made it ahead of time in the IP and then kept it warm until dinner. It is delicious!

Much like a dish my mother made on winter days when we came home from school at lunch time. She always used left over mashed potatoes and didn't make patties, just sauteed the ground beef, added spices and made pan gravy. Also didn't add an egg or bread crumbs. I tried this as written and prefer the simplicity of Mom's dish.

EIGHT patties from ONE pound of ground beef?  Make it two pounds and six patties and you'll have a reasonable meal.  Actually, this IS one of my favorite meals when served with rice and green beans.  Gotta have some cornbread as well.

This is one of our favorites. Don’t skip the sherry in the sauce. It really adds great flavor. I slice the onions a bit thicker than I normally do for other recipes and I don’t add them to the pan until after I flip the steaks. I found that they get too dark if they go in at the beginning. I also use half and half butter and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. The gravy is so good. I serve this with mashed potatoes and roasted string beans or salad.

This was a fabulous recipe. My husband and kids loved it. I doubled the beef broth and sherry so there was more gravy. I also added a dash of Worcestershire and sliced mushrooms when I put the beef back in to simmer.  Excellent!

This turned out surprisingly good, given the minimal ingredients. I sauteed the onions firs and included fresh mushrooms, removed all that and then sauteed the beef patties. When I was done with the beef patties, I wasn't sure what to do with all the grease (there was probably more than 1/3 cup). Seemed really unhealthy, so I drained most of it and added in a little butter (I like butter in gravy, really elevates the flavor). While the gravy was cooking down, I didn't like the color of it (grayish brown), so I ended up putting in 1/2 packet of brown gravy mix. I think if I would have just let the gravy cook down, it would have been good without the gravy mix, and the color would have improved. Next time I will not use the gravy mix. I think this recipe is really good just the way it is written, and my husband (who is very picky) said it was really good. I think it would be helpful, though, to include some language in the recipe that either indicates you are to keep all the grease for gravy, drain it all, etc.

This was a big hit with the family.  My kids can be picky eaters, but I was craving a good old Sunday dinner like my mom used to make.  With the instant mashed potatoes and frozen green beans it was a piece of cake to make a complete meal.  I didn’t have sherry but the flavor came out just fine.  The hamburger was nice and tender.  Be sure to use a pan that doesn’t have a non-stick surface because you’ll want to scrape up all the goodness into the gravy.  Enjoy!

These are freaking incredible. The only change I made was 2/3 cup old fashioned oats instead of 1/4 breadcrumbs because I rarely use breadcrumbs for dieting reasons (oats is a better complex carb). My husband and I were expecting something like banquet TV dinners, these are nothing of the sort! I like to add mushrooms as well and it makes a tasty beefy mushroom gravy! We have it over rice or with mashed potatoes, gravy on egg noodles as a side would be tasty too!

Wowed wow wow!!! I made this for my husband and 5 year old son, and we devoured EVERY BITE! I followed the recipe exactly as written, with only one exception-doubling the gravy recipe. I love slathering my food in gravy, so if that’s you too, I definitely recommend making a double batch! This was an easy-peasy recipe with fantastic results that’s great for a weeknight!

Easy and simple. Made it just as the recipe said, but in the future (and there will be a future) I'm considering adding a bit of thyme. A quick and tasty dinner for a week night.

I did make some changes - when I made this before, my family loved it and the portion was too small! So I doubled the amount of meat and ingredients (proportionately) and we'll have enough for leftovers! Delicious. Comfort food. Great with mashed taters or rice!

Followed directions and all enjoyed the meal. We'll make it again using fresh garlic etc as another reviewer suggested. Maybe add more onions as they carmelized nicely and a few more couldn't hurt.  add shrooms next time too. Good recipe....thanks

My husband liked it because of the onion gravy.  I thought it was OK but not outstanding!

I'll make it again.  It was yummy.  It was a little salty for our taste,  but we limit our salt intake because of health reasons.  So,  next time,  less seasoning salt,  and it will be great.

Grocery shopping for this was easy. My local Smiths stocked all of the ingredients. Taking another go at this recipe only costs a pound of ground beef. The cooking process was likewise easy. The taste department is where I'm on the fence. For all the spices and seasoning they have you add to this dish, I didn't taste much of it. Will be making again soon, and experimenting with the spices.

If you like spicy and different flavors than the traditional “gravy & hamburger” steak meal.. I used pre-made hamburger patties stuffed with jalapeño & peperjack cheese and followed the directions and it was really good!

I made this tonight for dinner, but I didn't have the sherry, so I added some white wine that I had on hand. I also had to use saltine crackers because I didn't have bread crumbs.  My family just loved it!!!  I can't wait to get some bread crumbs and sherry,  so I can make it that way too!!!  Thanks for sharing!

I give this five stars because it was delish my hubby loved it I’ve made this in the past but never added wortershire sauce because I was afraid it would be to salty. The only change I made was I used three packets of brown gravy and added sherry to it to give more flavor it was perfect. Thanks for sharing ??

Only changes I made was a sweet onion and gravy packet instead of making a homemade style gravy.  Also, I just shaped the meat into 4 patties instead of 8 small patties. It was really good I will make this again.

For what it was - super simple comfort food - it was great.  Didn't make my own gravy- used a mushroom gravy packet and water on the pan drippings and juices and stirred the onions back into it.  Lovely flavour and texture and satisfied my family - best part was dinner was done in 30 mins total with mashed potatoes and green beans and salad on the side.

Added a few extra seasonings to the gravy, and used bison in place of ground beef, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It was very delicious! My husband and I both agreed that we should at least double the recipe next time, as we both could have eaten more.

I follow a mostly Paleo diet, limiting flour.  I used chickpea crumbs in place of bread crumbs, doubles the liquid and added a cop of mushrooms for more gravy.  This is an awesome quick meal with not a lot of ingredients.

I just made this for supper. I am not much of a cook but this went together easy. I read several comments and only made 6 patties that were a little thicker. I used lean beef so I didn’t have much to make the gravy in the pan. Next time, I will at least double the gravy. It was very tasty. I served them with mashed potatoes. I will be making it again.

Very beefy. Didn't change a thing, except I made 6 burgers instead of eight. Next time would double or triple the gravy, would be perfect with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Brings back memories. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

The hamburger patty was yummy.  It was flavorful, easy and fast.  The onions were good until I mixed in the gravy.  I think if I was to ever do this again I would do everything except the gravy.  The gravy just didn't taste good.

Prep was manageable. Cooking times were accurate. The sauce didn’t quite turn out like the video. Mine turned bitter - might have overdone the reduction. Looked ok until I left it in the skillet and it became more like a paste.

So this turned out very good as written, reminded me of Salisbury Steak without the long crock pot time. The only problem is this meal repeated on us hours after eating it.

This was something different to do with a pound of hamburger. It was good, I doubled the gravy as everyone suggests. In my house, you can’t have too much gravy! Not something I’d want too often but not bad now and then.

Just an old fashioned recipe and it doesn't disappoint. I've made it with vegetable powders and with fresh. Yes, the fresh is better but powders are quicker. Personal preference and time determine which are used. I also added 1/2 teaspoon each of basil and a blend called Old World. (I won't mention the brand name.) They added extra flavor.

My mouth waters just looking at this recipe -I've made it 3 times now and apparently that isn't enough (according to my son & husband) It's savory comfort food and this recipe is fantastic - add your own herbs if you wish and spices but this is fool proof - FOOL PROOF!  Highly recommended.

The burger was okay, kind of  like meat loaf. The gravy needs lots of help. Made according to recipe but doubled the gravy as Iike lots of gravy with my mashed potatoes.  You could  leave out the Sherry.  Next day reheated and added some beef better-then-bullion which made it much better. Won't make again.

This was a good "smothered" burger base recipe for me. I made 4 large patties with a pound of hamburger. I don't see how you could make 8 unless they were meatball sized. I also doubled the beef broth and flour so I could make more gravy. Again, I didn't think one cup was near enough. I also added a lot more spices. I served with basmati rice.

I always try to make a recipe as it is written; however, I have dietary restrictions so in this recipe I had to omit the onions, onion powder and garlic powder.  I did use garlic infused oil to fry the patties in and used cajun seasonings when it called for seasoned salt (because I didn't have any on hand).  I thought these were pretty good and the gravy was excellent!

My mother bless her heart always made hamburger steaks with no flavor. Several years ago, I was looking for a delicious flavorful hamburger steak recipe when I stumbled across this. I’ve been cooking these once a month ever since. Whenever I have hamburger meat, eggs, and bread crumbs, this is what’s for dinner! It’s my partners favorite meal I make even though it’s really simple. The seasoning  makes it Pop, and they are juicy and rich. The people stating you need to add herbs are being pretentious. I promise, these  are delicious! The only thing I do different is use cognac instead of sherry, and add garlic for about 2 minutes before making the gravy roux. JUST. MAKE. THESE. They are delicious stick to your bones American goodness.

I followed the recipe exactly as it called except for the sherry and gravy. I didn’t have sherry, but I had a mushroom gravy packet in my pantry so I made it with mushroom gravy instead. The meat was moist and texture was great!

I did sub soy sauce for the Worcestershire sauce, I really don't like that. The result was delicious and I will make it again!!. I am thinking it would be good for the next church pot luck if I make a triple batch!

This was really good.  Comfort food.  I  ate one serving and put the rest in the refrigerator and tomorrow I will be able to skim off fat and feel a bit better about the fat content.  I ate it over a red potato.  Since I did not have seasoned salt, I added a bit more garlic powder and some cayenne.  Also, I used corn starch  due to the gluten issue (I have Celiac) but then recalled it does have bread crumbs.  Oh well.  As I said, it was really good.

Simple, easy, and all five members of my family loved it.  The gravy is perfect!  I eliminated to sliced onions because like most kids, that would have really turned off my younger ones.  I served with pre-made mashed potatoes and frozen peas on a busy night.  Great comfort food!

I have made this several times now.  This time I doubled the recipe for the patties (12) and tripled the gravy.   I just mixed the bullion (3 tsp), flour and seasoned salt in a little bowl before adding it to the grease, with 3 cups water.  I didn't use the sherry or oil and I poured off half the grease.  Added the onions after the flour mixture was stirred in.  I will definitely be making this many more times.

Awesome recipe! I switched up the recipe a bit by adding a pound of ground beef and a pound of ground turkey, some dry onion dip seasoning I had leftover, and mushrooms to the gravy.  Super delicious!

I love this recipe and I make it often! I didn't have seasoned salt so I just used kosher, I also didn't have sherry. One time I used some chicken broth instead of beef because that's what I had on hand and it worked out great!

My whole family enjoyed this, but I agree with the top negative reviewer that it could use some tarting up with fresh herbs.

I made this recipe exactly as written & it was fabulous. I’ve made many Salisbury steak recipes & this was by far the best. Now all I have to do is make sure I put this recipe somewhere safe so I can find it again. :)

I thought this was a very good meal but hubby said he liked others better. Still, he had seconds! I made it as stated and thought it had a lot of flavor. I did double the gravy and am glad I did. I served it with mashed potatoes and corn. I will make it again but not as often as I'd like it because of hubby's preferences. I do think it is a wonderful meal for children. Great comfort food.

It tasted really good. I made it with lean beef. I needed to add grease to make more sauce in the mixture.

Due to my rebellious nature, I rarely follow a recipe exactly. This recipe "idea" was a BIG hit, however! Thank you for it!  I'll certainly make it again...probably with a variation. Ha!

I used ground chuck, which was very lean.  Also, I changed the flour amount to 4 T. and the beef broth to 2 cups (or one can) to make more gravy.  For those who like mushrooms, that would also be an option.  This is definitely a dish I will make again in the future.

I've made this a few times because we really love this recipe.  It's simple and tastes great.  I've never made it with the sherry because that's something I just didn't have in my cupboard the first time I made it and it tastes great without it.

I tweaked the recipe a bit. Instead of using oil I used butter, I replaced flour with 2 tbls. brown gravy mix. (Bulk buy) did not use Sherry.    My hubby scarfed it down. Loved it.

My husband was talking about having this dish as a kid.  Of course, I thought I'd never find a recipe.  But, this is exactly what he was talking about.  We've made it many times.  Served over a pile of mashed potatoes...  you could almost forget it's hamburger meat!  Simple and good.

This recipe is quite good!  I followed the recipe to a T except I added.Mrs Dash seasoning in place of the seasoned salt (didn't have any on hand).  Everything came out very good except my gravy didn't turn out as good as expected.  I'd doubled the gravy  recipe but it didn't have as much flavor as I'd hoped.   I had to add a package of powdered brown gravy to get the "meatiness" that I was looking for.  Definitely liked the steaks as prepared and will keep working at perfecting this recipe.

I made this dish this evening. We recently purchased a Breville Food Processor and I was looking for something to do with ground beef in the processor.  I simply combined appropriate ingredients in the processor with 1 lb of already ground beef.  Used the Pulse button about 10x and it was thoroughly mixed. I made 5 patties... six would have been better.  The rest of the directions were a breeze.  Thank you!!

This is great. I’ve made it twice already. I used 85% beef so I have a good amount of fat for the gravy. I added mushrooms both times. The first time with portabella and it was amazing! Gives the gravy extra flavor! Tastes perfect on top of mashed potatoes!

Have made this several times and loved it every time. Since we have young kids and full-time jobs, I always make a double batch and freeze some patties for those nights when you need something good and fast. Serve over rice and it's a yummy, filling, and inexpensive dinner. Serve over a risotto (from scratch or packaged) for fancier fare.

I followed the recipe exactly written but I doubled the gravy, extra for the mashed potatoes, and it turned out great. My husband loved it! I will make it again.

Husband and mom loved it; me, too.  Served it with French cut green beans and egg noodles.  Don't cook with alcohol, so I skipped the sherry. Probably increased the salt a bit.  I would definitely make this again, very good.  Thank you for sharing a quick and easy recipe that was so tasty.

I used dried minced onion instead of onion powder and increased the Worcestershire sauce by 1 Tblsp. Fantastic recipe and I will be making this regularly.

I followed the recipe to the T, however, the next time I make this I will season the ground beef just a tad. The salt and pepper is not bad, but I would like more seasoning.

This recipe is wonderful and a keeper. The only thing I did different was I added fresh sliced mushrooms in with the onions. The sauce thickened up perfectly. Beautiful blend of flavors, and the seasoned salt kept that flavor balanced as the recipe called for flour to be sprinkled over the vegetables before sautéing.

WOW is an understatement. I stuck to the recipe and this stuff is awesome. Definitely adding it to the favorites. The kind of meal you make if you have company. Of course mashed potatoes, corn, and buttermilk biscuits complement this main dish superbly.

I was tired of the same old ground beef recipes so decided to give this a go and it was a huge hit!  Husband and son killed it. Said it reminded him of his mother's meatloaf and gravy from when he was a kid.  Just good hearty comfort food.

Excellent recipe! Substituted ground Pronghorn Antelope for the beef. Would suggest upping the gravy portions a little as I personally prefer my smothered steak with lots of gravy.

This was amazingly delicious! I doubled the recipe and tripled the gravy. Not enough gravy for us with potatoes.  Gravy was too salty for me. I got 5 very thick patties out of the recipe. We will definitely be making this once a week!!

I didn't take a pic, but I should have. This recipe is so delicious... I woke up the next morning craving hamburger steak. I put the patties between bread and made hot hamburgers. My wife asked me how I made the patties so fluffy. you NEED to make this. A definate home run.

Very good - I've been looking for something similar to a frozen Salisbury Steak dinner, but without all the pre-packaged ingredients like soup mix and flavor packets. This comes very close. Maybe a bit too salty, otherwise 5 stars. I'll do a bit less salty spices next time.

This is really good.  I didn't even have sherry or onion powder and it was still super flavorful. Quick and easy. Will definately keep in my repertoire.

A bit saltier than I would feed my family most likely because I did not add the sherry. Otherwise ALL 3 toddlers loved and ate it all.

Perfect “meat and potatoes” recipe. I make this at least once a month. I double the beef broth because one cup thickens to paste. I omit the sherry since I don’t have any and it’s only a small amount anyways. We serve this over mashed potatoes or rice.

I am not a born cook and I'm still working on it; that's why I use Allrecipes. I used this recipe and made only one change; no sherry....just because I had none on hand. It turned out really great; simple, flavorful, really hit the spot. I'm giving it four stars only because I altered it; otherwise five.

Great recipe!  Nice and easy but tasty.I did take the advice from a reviewer and added 1.5 cup milk to the broth along with her .5 cup flour & milk thickening . Nice to have a little more gravy.

This was pretty good, but a little  overwhelming  on onion flavor. I doubled the gravy which was a good choice. Next time I shall substitute  mushrooms for  onions . All in all the family enjoyed it . My wife called it comfort food. My youngest daughter and I put it over noodles.  My oldest daughter and wife did mashed  potatoes.

4 stars for the recipe, a definite 10 for when you make it your  own!  It's a great base recipe to personalize and certainly good when followed, but  the fresh ingredients pay off ten fold.   So fine chop some garlic and onions for the beef mix. What the heck is seasoning salt?  -regular salt works fine.   No sherry, so red cooking wine took it's place.  Doubled the gravy and added fresh mushroom. I didn't have beef broth but 1 bullion dissolved in water works well. A few shakes of  Maggi Seasoning in the gravy, why not?   WOWA.  It was a good thing I was sitting down because my knees would have buckled! My husband was making "yum" sounds between each bite with an occasional "oh, man." Success!

The only thing I changed was used low sodium beef broth, and replaced the season salt with Mrs Dash. It was excellent - the true test was my husband did not notice it was low sodium fare. I served mine with noodles and a mixed greens salad.

Turned out well. As I didn't have cooking sherry on hand, I substituted with 1/2 T apple cider vinegar + 1/2 T water. The next time I prepare this, I'll double the gravy ingredients except for the flour. I believe the 2 T should be fine as the gravy turned out quite thick.

Whole family loved this.  I was looking for something other than meatballs or tacos to make with ground beef - definitely so put this in the rotation!  Like others I doubled the gravy and it was a good thing. Really needed it for the mashed potatoes. Yum!

A new family favorite. I did not have Sherry on hand and found out that I can use apple cider vinegar in lieu of it.

I used grass fed beef and crush pork rinds instead of bread crumbs as well as only about one teaspoon cornstarch for double the amont of stock. I had my own homemade bone stock. I changed the seasoning and used orange juice instead of sherry. My version is gluten free and keto friendly. This recipe is very adaptable and can be tweaked to suit almost everyone.

Wonderful! My husband raved about this. It will become a regular at our house. I made two subtle changes. I added dried onion to the meat mixture and I caramelized the onions in the oil before frying the meat, removed the onions, cooked the meat, removed the meat and made the gravy, then added back the onions to the gravy, added back the meat and smothered it with the gravy and onions. It was quite the hit!! Thank  you!

I made this dish and it is delicious. I substituted orange juice for the cooking Sherry and it was very good.  I will definitely make this many many times.  Great weeknight meal, quick to prepare and pretty much everything you already have on hand. Definately will be a regular in our menu rotation.

This is a very good dish. I will make it again. Next time, I will leave out the second addition of the seasoned salt. The gravy is great on mashed potatoes. I will double the gravy/onion recipe.

This was easy way to dress up hamburger! I added mushrooms to the gravy & also doubled the gravy. My other half loved it! Yum

This is one of those comfort food dishes, it's quick and easy and very tasty. I followed the recipe to the letter and loved the flavor. Served it over mashed potatoes and a side of green beans.

Didn't have any wine or cooking sherry on hand for the gravy, so I used bourbon instead. Amazing!

Great recipe for when you're hankering for comfort food.
Like some others,I did not have sherry,so I used a little red wine and browning sauce. The gravy was fantastic!
Took the advice of some other comments and doubled the gravy. I did sauté mushrooms,but that's just my personal preference. 
Thanks for the recipe and the helpful comments about making more gravy.

2nd time making it.  Awesome meal, just a few mods...  I did not have onion powder on hand, and I doubled the flower and broth, no sherry either.  Plenty of gravy this time around for your potatoes!!!

Easy and delicious! I use ground angus for the beef, and if I make potatoes with this I double the amount of gravy. Sometimes if I have some sour cream or heavy cream I'll add a little bit of that into the gravy at the end- now that's comfort food!

This has become a family favorite! Only alteration was substituting cooking sherry with pineapple juice, for I don't keep sherry. Gravy is delicious, recommend doubling the gravy recipe for your tators! ;)

This was one of those challenge recipes I gave my husband to make and it was awesome. We did go with dredging the burgers in flour for extra crunch and of course mushrooms, now this is very happily one of our regulars.

Would be five stars but the instructions could be more specific.  Should use a strong flavored onion, like a purple one, and not whatever I used which was too sweet. Should use more flour to thicken the gravy if you're using a very lean ground beef like 93%. For dumb dumbs like myself, it would have been helpful if they described how flat I should have smooshed the rolled ground beef to form patties.  Gravy should def be doubled too.  The concept is great though.

Made this recipe as written. Very good, thick rich gravy.  I will be adding this to my dinner rotation. Quick and easy to make and usually have all the ingredients on hand so will be able to pull this off in a pinch. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy as toast. A nice meal. Next time I too might try using fresh ingredients in place of some of the dry spices. also  I need more practice at meat shaping.

It was pretty good. Easy to make. I didn't have any sherry, so I didn't use it. I doubled the gravy ingredients and added a can of mushrooms. It made 8 small patties which was good for the kids.  I served it with mashed potatoes, corn and biscuits. Kids loved it.

My husband Barbecued the hamburger steak so I modified the onion gravy. I sauteed the onions then added a pkg of Knorrs Hunter Sauce mix and slowly incorporated the sherry as indicated in the original recipe.
Served with mashed potatoes and green peas; this meal was a great success. I will be making it again.

I made it according to the directions... which is rare for me.  I thought it was great.  I doubled the recipe  and 8 of us wiped it out.  The gravy was good and I sliced the onions long so that my picky child could easily eat around them.

Meat was good. The gravy had an awful aftertaste. I recommend just using flour, drippings, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder browned then add hot water slowly while whisking, until you get the amount and texture you'd like.

We really liked these  The only thing I did different was I browned  on one side about five minutes, turn  and then added one large onion, cooked for four to five  minutes and removed the steaks. On the side I mixed 1 TBS of argo cornstarch with a little of the broth before I added the cornstarch,I  added the broth slowly  to the onions Then added the cornstarch to the pan.When it started to get thick I returned the steaks back to the pan.Covered . Next time i would make more gravy

I found the patties were too firm and not moist or tender.  I liked the added flavour of the cooking sherry in the gravy.  If I make it again, I will add ingredients to make the meat more tender.

Yes I added a Tbs  of ketchup to the gravy. On the whole it was delicious. I don't know why I have never made this before.  Will definitely be making this dish again!

I fibbed a little. I didn't technically make THIS recipe (but will soon; want the gravy!). But as I looked at the ingredients, I realized it's nearly identical to my meatloaf recipe (which everyone says is the best) and to a lesser degree, my husband's concoction for hamburger patties on the grill. Meatloaf calls for 2 lbs. ground beef, 2 eggs and 2 cups fresh bread crumbs and 1 tbs Worcestershire sauce. Does the cooking Sherry make much difference? Haven't ever used it.  I agree with one reviewer, that adding a dry package of onion or onion/mushroom soup mix really perks them up. We use the soup mix for both, and either a small, well drained can or fresh mushrooms.  Can't wait to make it cause I already know it will be delicious!!

My husband and I really liked this. I made few changes. I added some finely chopped (in food processor) mushrooms to the meat, and doubled the gravy as suggested by other reviewers. I also added some dry onion soup mix (1/2 a packet) to the gravy. We served it with mashed potatoes and seasoned broccoli. Will make again, very good.

The possibilities with this recipe is endless.  Either prepared as is or with a few tweaks.  I don't think you can go wrong!  The sherry helps adult it up and pairs well with the Worcestershire.   Watch the fat to flour ratio when making the roux.  You may need to add a little fat or take some out depending upon the fat content of your ground beef.  You can dress this up or dress it down depending upon your needs or situation (end of the month stretch the budget or using ground round or sirloin for the taste)  Fresh herbs are always best, but we don't always have them on hand.  Dried is just as good,  Didn't mention it, but you can also serve on noodles, rice, with potatoes, on toast, etc.   The chopped green part of scallions would be a nice garnish.

Comfort food!
I followed recipe as close as I could but had to sub crushed saltines for breadcrumbs and mushrooms for onions. I added a few shakes of worchestershire (sp?) sauce in the gravy, served with brown rice and mixed veggies. I loved it and my hubs said it was tasty. I would definitely make this again and try it with egg noodles or mashed potatoes.

I just made this and it was fabulous. I was looking for something new to do with my ground meat and this was rated as one of the most popular. I served it with cream potatoes, with extra gravy.  Both my husband and my picky sixteen-year-old daughter loved it too.

My boyfriend said dinner was "pretty tasty" when I made this and that's his equivalent of 2 thumbs up so I'll definitely be making it again!  I added mushrooms, made a packet of mushroom gravy, and served it over buttered broad egg noodles...  Awesome!  :)

This is my second time making this I use ground turkey but everything else I use step by step. My family loves it. Even my very picky and finicky 16 year old son. I double the recipe for left overs. I'm am very grateful I can add this to my rotation of meals.

I followed the recipe exactly and my family of five enjoyed it as is.  It's quick and simple for a weeknight dinner.  Next time, I'll double the gravy and make mashed potatoes as a side.  Heard a lot of "taste like meatloaf" comments but I found it tastier than meatloaf.

Was perusing for last minute dinner ideas and this sounded pretty good (it helped that I didn't have to make a trip to the store). I used an entire onion b/c I often find there is never enough for me. Cooked them for about 5 min first to soften & then added the patties. 1 lb of meat mixture yielded 5 nicely sized patties. The time it took for the patties to brown well on both sides allowed the onions to really cook down and caramelize. And since I also love gravy, I also doubled the beef broth using Better Than Bullion (be sure to omit the second dose of salt). Put the patties back in to reheat and served on top of mashed potatoes. SO. GOOD. My husband really liked it and said he didn't realize Salisbury steak could be made outside of a frozen dinner. This one's a keeper!

I did not make any changes.  My picky daughter ate one whole patty and my husband went back for thirds.  We will definitely be making again.  Thanks!

Very good meal. I made four patties instead of eight just to fit the skillet, I would have eaten two or three patties  anyway.  I did serve with mashed potatoes and wish there was more gravy. Next time I'll use fresh spices and make more gravy.  This recipe hasn't seen the last of me.

Hamburger patties were a little bland and didn't have much taste, but the gravy on top was very good!

I used sirloin for my patties; when they were done there was no oil in the pan to make a gravy slurry. 

I doubled the amount of the gravy by using a whole can (14.5 oz) of beef broth & doubling amount of flour & sake (sub for sherry).

The gravy was delicious but the patties very bland. Followed recipe exactly for seasoning the meat. I topped it with an over easy egg & side of kim chee to make a loco moco.  But still couldn't get past blandness of patty so won't make again.

Made this recipe when my grandchildren were visiting.  The hamburgers were very tasty and there was plenty of gravy to put over the side of noodles.  My husband loved it and the kids cleaned off their plates.  Will be making this for them again.

A big hit! Made a couple of small changes: 
-For a little extra zing added 2 teaspoons dry mustard to the burger mix,
-Lightly  dipped the pre-cooked burgers in flour before frying,
-Doubled the beef broth for more gravy. 
Delish!

Followed the recipe as written except for deleting sherry, which I don't care for.  The first time, there wasn't enough gravy. Used 3 cups of beef broth the second time. Now  it's one of my favorites!

This is delicious. I did have to substitute the beef broth with chicken broth. My pantry was empty of beef broth and cooking sherry. Besides that, I followed the recipe. Served over homemade mashed potatoes. Yum!

I made it exactly as written and it was delicious.  The texture is excellent on the patties and the process to make them was simple and quick.  For my own tastes, I will probably make it spicier with more pepper and other seasonings next time, and I also like to mix fresh onions into the patties, but the recipe is great as written.  Thanks for sharing!

My dad wanted hamburger steak to Valentine's Day, it is one of his fav dishes. To be honest I always hated it and when he would make it for dinner growing up I would take my plate to my room and not eat it. Then I found this recipe and I loved t!!! He raved about it and even ate the leftovers which is rare. I give this recipe 10 stars. I call it a fancy hamburger steak!

I made this tonight for dinner & it was great.  Even my husband like it...that is a plus in it self.  Simple recipe.
The only changes I made was I added fresh thin slice mushrooms to the gravy & also I added a pad of butter in the end to the  gravy.  Did not have seasoned salt so I improvised on it.
This is an easy go to recipe.  I did cut the hamburg in half as it was only my husband & I .  It gave me 2 large & 1 smaller burger.  More than enough for us.
It will be my new go to recipe & I will pass it on to others.
Thank You All recipe again....another winner!!!!!

Reminds me of a recipe from the old yellow Betty Crocker recipe box my Mama used to have sitting on our kitchen counter.  Doesn't get any better than this with rolls and mash potatoes.  Made it just like the recipe except for ground beef used Venison. Fabulous and so easy.

Made for George down in Florida.  Doubled the gravy, added some chopped parsley to the meat.  It was very good.  But did take a little longer to cook the meat than they said, although that may have been because I made 5 patties instead of 8 so they may have been a little bit thicker.

I don't do the bread crumbs personally as I'm gluten free, so I don't add those or the egg, but otherwise it's a delicious recipe. I really crave this dish and look forward to it, and it makes great leftovers. Also I eat it with simple mashed potatoes, and sometimes add mushrooms into the recipe.

Very good hearty basic meal. Added mashed potatoes and corn. Used more onions as we LOVE onions. And subbed a beef bullion cube since I didn't have beef broth. The only thing I changed was simply due to ease. I cooked the patties first. Then removed them and cooked the onions in the bit of grease from burgers. I know I know. I shouldn't. But it was delish!  I would def make again. Would recommend

We raise our own sheep, so I made this recipe with lamb burger. Otherwise, I made this recipe as printed with no changes. This turned out perfect and was very delicious. I did double the gravy since we like to sop it up with biscuits. The meat was tender and very tasty. We will make again.

Excellent, used a few suggestions, but most important double it, because it was such a hit. Make extra sauce too, if you want it over anything. This time we used Quinoa.

It turned out great. Maybe add fresh button mushrooms to the gravy next time?  Used white wine since I was out of sherry. I bet sherry would take it over the top.   Used my Christmas cast iron!  Also used fresh bread crumbs, the recipe did not specify and I am out of dry.

My whole family loved this recipe. I loved that is was very quick and easy to make for when I don't have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen. I followed the recipe with no changes and it was great just as is. I served it with mashed potatoes, green beans, and rolls.

I made this recipe as is. It came out great. The patties were so soft and the gravy was so tasty. It was very easy and made ground beef such a joy to eat. My family loved it. My husband hinted at having a sunny side up egg with it next time around. I actually added that egg for a plate of leftovers for my youngest and she gobbled it right up. It was like a loco moco. This recipe is a keeper and I will definitely be making again and again!

Super simple and easy preparation.  Delicious.  Double up on the sauce component if you are serving with potoatoes, it gets soaked up pretty fast.

This recipe is wonderful!!! My family loved it! I followed the recipe except for a few additions, and a substitution. I substituded the sherry with red wine because I didn't have sherry. I also used Lipton's beefy onion, and beefy mushroom, along with some beef bouillon. I added canned mushrooms. I also added more of the spices . We like it spicy! I doubled the recipe because my family eats a lot!  I will say to anyone who reads this review,  that the breadcrumbs are very important. They hold the patty together, and help to retain moisture.  I've made a similar dish for years, but I never used the breadcrumbs and egg. The hamburger was tough no matter how long it simmered in the gravy. So like a meatloaf, don't forget the breadcrumbs and egg. I served this dish over white rice with a side of green beans. Fabulous! Thank you so much for this recipe. I will definitely use this recipe for years to come.

Instead of making 3 small patties, I made 3 bigger ones which turned out much better.  Next time might serve it on pasta.

Great, easy, simple ingredients and easily altered.  I made a double batch. The first batch of patties I fried without onions, and second batch I fried with the onions.  I felt the second batch with the onions didn't brown very well.  Next time I wouldn't put the onions with the patties.

We really loved this recipe!  I had to spoon out some of the grease produced by the hamburger, and used a little Liquid Smoke since I didn't have any Worcestershire Sauce.  Great flavor!  Yes, I will make this again.

This turned out sooo good. Wonderful for making for myself and my sweetheart at the end of a long working day -- very quick and relatively easy. I paired it thick-cut red skillet potatoes fried up with a little of the beef broth and some rosemary.  I am personally not a huge fan of beef-centered dishes, so I'm definitely hoping to try a spin on this with sausage patties.

Tasty version of meatloaf with gravy.  I substituted oatmeal for the bread crumbs and omitted the sherry.  If only using one pound of hamburger, your 8 patties would have been small. I made into 4 quarter pounders which required additional cooking time.

I made it using two pounds of ground beef and followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out fine. A good weekday meal and a nice change from  just hamburgers.

I made this to go with leftover mashed potatoes. It was excellent, ala Swanson TV dinners, only better. (Only got them when my parents went out. It was babysitter food.) The only thing I will do differently in the future is to reduce the salt in the gravy. It was a tad salty for my taste. Overall - a very tasty comfort meal. Thanks for posting it!

I was looking for a meal idea I thought my six year would eat and came across this. I forgot to get beef broth while at the store, and all I had on hand was chicken broth, so I searched online for a substitute and found that I could mix soy sauce with water. It was the closest I could get. I did double the recipe and got seven thick patties. I cooked the onions first, by themselves, so they could carmelize and then put them aside in a bowl so the patties could cook in the pan. I then removed the patties, put the onions back in and continued as the recipe directed. I made green beans as a side. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal tonight and will make this again.

My Husband loves it he said they taste amazing. I didn't have cooking sherry on hand so next time I will try to have it. I didn't have beef broth so I put one beef buillion cube in one cup of hot water for that. Very good flavor even with the substitions/lack of sherry.

Super easy but kind of salty.  I used Better then Bouillon to make the beef broth and I may have  made it too strong.  Hubby enjoyed it and did not find it too salty and requested we try it again.

This was very good. The only change I made was to reduce the amount of added salt by about half and substituted garlic crouton crumbs for the dry bread cubes.

The only change I made was because I did not have cooking sherry. I did happen to have a boxed wine  Cabernet, so I substituted it. Great, easy, flavorful dish. I love hamburger steak and this really measured up! Thank you for the recipe. I will definitely make again.

Great recipe.  Easy to make.  I used Tony Chachere's as my ''Seasoned Salt'' and added a little bit of Liquid Smoke to the meat. I used 92/8 hamburger meat .  I will definitely make this again.

This was incredible! All five of us at the table agreed we wanted seconds, though we ultimately decided to save the leftovers for another day. We followed the recipe with only two exceptions - in lieu of cooking sherry, we added a splash of red wine, and instead of breadcrumbs we used panko (dairy free). 

I also want to share that this is an easy, quick and delicious recipe for folks who can't handle all the creamy soups and cheese found in other recipes. So flavorful - I'm glad we doubled the entire thing! Now we can enjoy it again later this week. (Served with rice and two veggies - fantastic!)

I am only giving the recipe 4 stars because I did make a couple changes; I substituted mushrooms for the onion and I didn't use the sherry. With those two changes I found the end result to be very pleasing. I will definitely be making the recipe (with my changes)  again and I will possibly try it with the onion and the sherry sometime. I am confident that the recipe as is, though I didn't follow exactly, will taste delicious.

These little patties are delicious.  They are well-seasoned and tender.  I doubled the gravy, and I'm glad I did, so we could have gravy on the patties AND gravy on mashed potatoes, as well.  This was a hit according to the menfolk, too.  I think DS wants to try to make it, himself!  I would be very happy to sit at his table, when he does.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really solid recipe. I didn't use sherry, had no beef broth & grated some garlic & onion into the meat (20% chuck). I added a lot more worcestershire & subbed chicken broth for the beef. I found the recipe gravy base was  bland so I added Trader Joe's Everyday Seasoning and their fresh ground pepper mix. Lots of kosher salt (I don't care for season salt) and really doubled down on the garlic/onion powder. Lastly, I did the steaks 1st (w/olive oil & a touch of butter). I only browned them making sure I pulled them while still very rare. The 15 minutes in the gravy cooks them through but they're moist & tender inside. Make sure you don't forget to pour the juices from the resting steaks into the gravy (adds more beef flavor). We had simple steamed  buttered potatoes w/chives & also sweet corn nibblets on the side. So yummy!!! This recipe is sooo flexible to make adjustments & do your own thing. I want to add a little Dijon to the gravy next time & perhaps just a bit of horseradish to the meat mix (I really have a palate for rather heavily seasoned but balanced flavors). Try this recipe.

We really liked it! I didn't have any onions so I used half  can of French onion soup I put it in the pan in the beginning when I browned the burgers then used it in the gravy. I also doubled the gravy , doubled the flour, broth,and sherry . If I had not doubled the gravy there would not have been e enough to cover potatoes! I will make again

I did change it...but only for my family tastes. I made double the recipe but included half pound sausage and 1.5 pound hamburger. Didn't have cooking  sherry and used chinese cooking wine...very similar.  Everyone liked it. Easy to cook...I had everything (except the sherry).

Great recipe!!! My husband and I loved it! The only thing I would recommend is to not have it summer for 15 min. 15 is wayyy to long and the gravy starts to get clumpy. I would say let it simmer for 5-10. I would definitely make it again!

AMAZING!!! Made this for a picky crowd & there was nothing left! They loved it! I followed the recipe exactly except did not add onions. Doubled the gravy & served with homemade mashed potatoes. Mmmm delish!

This was super easy to make! I barely changed anything (just added a little bit of garlic powder to the gravy because I add garlic powder to everything). My kids gobbled it up and were sad that there were no seconds on gravy! Next time I may make a bigger batch of the gravy because everyone loved it so much.

I rated it a 4 because I dressed it up with just a little more flavor than called for. But my family loved it like a 5! And I have 4 kids and a hubby that NEVER agree. The amazing thing about this recipe is that it bends to adjustments VERY well and still makes a great dish!

I had to adjust/sub because of what I had on hand and couldn't run out to the store. I did not have garlic powder on hand so I only used minced garlic, and I had no sherry. I used garlic and herb flavored bread crumbs. I used 1 Tablespoon of Worcestershire. I used no parsley. I used a beef Knorr homestyle stock tub with 1 &1/4 cups of water in place of beef broth. I only cooked the patties about 3 minutes a side since they would be cooking more in the pan with the gravy, and only cooked in the gravy about 10 minutes.
I served with roasted garlic yellow potatoes. 

My family has asked for this to go into our weekly rotation!

My husband is a stick in the mud when it comes to change.  He's always wanted his "hamburger steak" plain-jane, just a slab of hamburger fried.  I decided to try this recipe and see his reaction.  I followed it to "t" and put it over rice.  To my surprise, he oooo-ed and awww-ed over it as he ate it.  It was truly DE-LISH, and I thank the poster!!  It's simple and outstanding!!

Excellent as is!!! I don't feel the need to change a thing in this delicious recipe. I've made it twice and the second time I did try another reviewer's suggestion to try onion soup mix and it too was very good.

tastes more like salsbary steak. I did not have any sherry to put in it and I also didn't use the beef broth but this was a successful hit in my house of 3 girls ranging 5-12 and my hubby!

I gave this recipe a 4 star rating because there's just not enough gravy for my family.  It was a small amount, just barely covering the patties and I really wanted more for my mashed potatoes.  The taste was excellent though, even after I forgot the second 1/2 tsp of seasoned salt.  I'll definitely be making this one again, just doubling the flour and broth to meet our gravy needs.

Great Recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  I changed only one thing flouring the outside of the hamburger patty to give it a crispy crust like I remember growing up.   I thought the sherry in the gravy gave it a great taste.  Delicious.

Gravy makes the dish, and this is very easy to make.  I did not have the sherry so I just skipped it.  This is really very good.  Made it last week and my husband already asking me to make it again.

Love, love, loved this recipe!!The only change was that I used chicken broth (what I had on hand). My boys (husband and teenage son) devoured it! I will make this often. I made the patties up a week in advance and put them in the freezer. I defrosted them overnight and whipped up a delicious and tasty meal in a few minutes. #easy#delicious#fantastic

Delicious! The only thing I did different was use Worcestershire Sauce instead of sherry in the gravy and that was only because I didn't have any sherry. I will probably omit the seasoned salt in the gravy next time because it was a bit too salty for me and there is plenty of salt in the beef broth but that is just my personal taste preference. Great, easy recipe and the whole family loved it!

We will make this again.  I didn't use the sherry and the gravy was a little sweet.  Next time I will make sure to use the sherry to see if that helps or maybe the sweetness was from my onions.

This recipe' is absolutely delicious!  My husband and I both loved it -- wouldn't change anything, except to double the gravy (for mashed potatoes).  He loves gravy so doubling it would work well for us.  Easy to make - ingredients were readily available - prep was easy -- and overall cooking time was only 15 minutes (after prep).  I highly recommend this dish to anyone who enjoys comfort food and old-fashioned goodness.

This is delicious! I leave out the cooking sherry and I only make 4-5 patties and let them simmer a little longer with the onions. I use ground chuck for beef too..My husband thinks I'm the best cook ever now!

I made the recipe exactly as stated. I thought it was good not great. It was easy to prepare. The gravy is not bad. It was an okay dish, I just didn't love it. I was hoping it would be more like salsbury steak but it just wasn't quite there.

I made this recipe the first time only because I had all the ingredients  (except the sherry), but it sounded average to me. It turned out to be excellent. It had a rich flavor that dressed up the dish. My husband loved it, too!

I followed the directions to a tee to make this recipe. My husband and son liked it but I thought it was too salty. My son actually took the cold patties and gravy to school for lunch the next day and requested I make it again soon.

No changes made, followed to the "T" and it was "DELICIOUS".  Family loved it and will be served again in the near future.  Thank you.

Other then the fact I chose the wrong hamburger (hamburger steak was very tough even after simmering on low)  this recipe turned out great! Hearty and wholesome meal for my family to enjoy, I truly loved making my gravy from scratch.

I am tired of making plain old hamburgers for my family.  I needed to find something different.  I used this more as base recipe.  Rather than make 8 small patties I made 4 quarter pound patties.  I also added mushrooms to the pan with the onion.  Right at the end of cooking gravy, I also added a healthy dollop of sour cream.  Served everything over mashed potatoes and was a hit.

My husband and sons were in no pain when I served these tonight!  And neither was I.  I made very few changes to the recipe, except to increase the meat and other ingredients to one and a half times the amount in order to accommodate the 3 guys.  The one pound of ground beef indicated would never make it in our house--LOL!!  I served this entree with my ever-popular Yukon gold mashed potatoes and wonderful thick sliced heirloom tomatoes.  YUM!

Followed recipe exactly as written, and wouldn't change a thing. Perfect over homemade mashed potatoes to help finish off the fantastic gravy this makes. This will become an often made dish in my house.

Great throwback dish that will make you wonder why you don't  make it more often.  Recommend you start with grass fed beef hamburger.  I used marsala wine for a flavor boost.

Followed directions except substituted a tsp. OJ for Sherry.  And I browned the onions after I browned the hamburgers.  Tastes like the Salisbury Steak TV dinner!  I served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  My husband and college-age son both really liked it, too.

Even though I messed up on one thing I still love this recipe. Someone wrote that you could use one teaspoon of vanilla to replace the sherry. My husband and I thought this didn't work. I am going to buy some cooking sherry and try this again. Also, I made four burgers and next time will make six. The four burgers were too much.

Love this recipe!  I always add extra broth so that there is extra gravy to spread on top, and also like to add sautéed mushrooms to the mix as well.

I'm not big on red meat, frying, or gravy but. ....WOW! I wanted to do something a little more down home country because I'm always putting my husband through my "fancy" dishes and this was absolutely amazing! I cooked it again 2 days later for my son and his wife and they were in love! The only thing I did differently was mix the meat with all the ingredients and let it sit for about an hour and the meat turned out so tender and flavorful, melt in your mouth!

Did not even know this was possible. Essentially felt like a meatball recipe but I'm inexperienced so I don't know. I subsituted elk burger, I'm a hunter and like the leaner meat. I have to agree with the critical review at the top, fresher ingredients made a huge difference. I added a little fresh green onion, garlic, minced onions, and mushrooms to the existing ingredients and it was awesome. I'm a sucker for meat and potatoes and just put some of that gravy over garlic mashed. Amazing meal. Going to have to add this to my weekday dinner arsenal!!!! Thanks a million!!!

Great recipe, tender and tasty.  Made it exactly as written except doubled gravy ingredients to have extra for some home made mashed potatoes.  Also added 1 tbsp gravy master to gravy to give it richer color.  Used 85/15 chop meat and plain bread crumbs.

I have made this many times and it is one of my "go-to" recipes. My entire family loves it and my son and daughter-in-law asked for the recipe and they also make this great dish. I always use high quality ground meet wither ground sirloin or extra lean ground beef.

This is a great recipe and definitely a new favorite dish of mine. I didn't change anything on the recipe (as I don't feel it is fair to rate something you have modified) the sauce on this has such a great flavor. Also I like this recipe because it doesn't take long so if you are looking for a quick dinner idea this is one to make.

We're eating this now! When my husband saw 'hamburger patties' cooking, he didn't look enthused, to say the least. But ince dinner was served...whole other story! Didn't change anything except Inused salt as I don't use seasoned salt. Will definitely make it again! Ha!  He's asking if there's more!

This was great. The only change I made was to double the gravy so there would be enough for the mashed potatoes I served it with. Make sure to double the flour as well as the broth and sherry, otherwise the gravy will just be too thin. Excellent, easy recipe.

I didn't have the Sherry but it was still amazing! My mom watched and kept saying it was just like the kind she used to make.....then she had a bite and said this version was far better! The meat wasn't dry, the onions were perfect and the gravy was delish! ??

Good but a bit bland.  After a few minor enhancements I would give this 4 stars:
- added a splash of worcestershire to the gravy
- added 1 tsp whole grain mustard to gravy
- added a few slrigs of fresh thyme

Made as directed. Delish! After I made the gravy, I poured it into the blender, onions and all. Excellent consistency. Poured over patties and finished cooking.

I wasn't a huge fan, but my kids and husband really liked it. I think maybe I will mis some pork in with it next time to add a little more moisture and complexity to the meat.

I found this recipe on a night when I didn't feel like going to the store. Unfortunately I didn't have any beef broth for the gravy, so instead I used chicken broth with a splash of red wine, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. The color of the gravy was a little light, but it tasted phenomenal. Will definitely make again, and maybe add some mushrooms in with the onion.

This was quite good an very easy to make. I didn't have beef broth, but I did have Progresso Onion soup, which is in a beef broth, so I used that. Quick and good. I made it with potatoes, but I think next time I'll serve it with rice or noodles to sop up the yummy sauce.

Just like Mom used to make! I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only change I made is I used a heaping teaspoonful of  Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of the salt, pepper and garlic powder, as it has all of those in it anyway. Oh, and instead of cooking sherry I use real sherry. Folks, if you've ever tasted cooking sherry (or cooking wine for that matter) you'd never use it again. If you won't drink it, don't cook with it. If you don't have sherry, use a splash of wine (either red or white) or just leave it out. I'm definitely doubling the gravy next time though.

I made this for my 83 year old Dad. He served in Germany and this reminded him of a dish he ate there.

This was insanely good. The best hamburger steaks I've ever made by far. Only thing I changed was using Worcestershire in the gravy since I didn't have any cooking sherry.

This recipe was excellent just as written. HOWEVER, I appreciate the reviewers who changed things and let me know how that worked out too, it's helpful for when I don't have an ingredient or know that my family's preferences might suggest omitting something. And reviews with substitutions are great also! I like to know that I won't ruin a dish by doing something, or that I will.

Great and easy weekday dinner.  Only change was to double the beef broth to thin the gravy down a bit. Will definitely make again.

Had an odd taste to it, I thought. I just did not care for the gravy at all, and the hamburger patties definitely needed something to kick them up.I won't make this again.

I followed this recipe to the letter and it was awesome!  Instead of serving them over rice, I served them over homemade fries.  I also made a tossed salad which brought the whole meal together quite nicely. This was a very tasty and filling meal and my hubby asked when I would be making it again.  Thanks, Anne Marie for sharing this recipe.   I will indeed be making this again...and again.

Easy and delicious. Did not have beef broth so I substituted 1 cup water w/1 chicken bouillon cube and 1 tbsp reduced sodium soy sauce. You'd never know the difference!

I over cook the HB steaks a little, but it was still outstanding. I didn't have any cooking wine, but it turned out wonderful. Even the wife said I will be making it again.

WOW! This is amazing!!!!!!! I followed the directions exactly except doubled the gravy -- believe me, you will want it! The gravy is unreal and the combination of the meat and seasonings is spot on. Not hard to make either, just watch the meat and gravy so it's done to your liking.

I followed directions exactly as written.  I would have given this recipe five stars except for the fact that I found it a bit too salty.  I will definitely make it again but with a little less salt.

Delicious. I wouldn't change a thing but you could double the gravy for mashed potatoes. My teenage boys gobbled it up. I have been looking for a similar recipie for quite some time. Thank you so much for sharing.

Really good, made as suggested. I ate 5 of them in one sitting. I did try putting a slice of cheese on a few of them (greasy diner hamburger steak with gravy, onions + cheese is awesome) but did not return them to the skillet to simmer with the gravy. The simmer stage makes all the difference - if you fry the patties for the suggested time, they might be a little pink still in the center, the simmer stage will finish cooking them through and the flavor will be 10x better.

I did try to go pretty much by the recipe but I was cooking for my client and She is on a low sodium diet. So I kind of lumped the seasonings together by using 1 teaspoon of McCormicks Nature's Seasonings. I didn't use any seasoned salt in the gravy either I used 1/2 teaspoon of Mrs. Dash original and 1/2 teaspoon Mrs.Dash garlic blend. The broth had enough salt in it as I used one bouillon cube to make it. Oh! and to jazz up the meat I added Shitake mushrooms and shallot inside the patties. Delicious!!!

Great. I added 2 dried Thai peppers to give it a little kick. I added them after I had removed the burgers and just before making the gravy. Even if I had not added this it would have been great.

I liked this recipe very much i used to do a similiar one for my steak but  i disnt have sherry so i added vanilla extract it was great however Frying the onion with the beef caused some of the onion  to burn so maybe its better to fry the beef then the onion after you Remove the patties

Very good recipe. I was in such a rush that I really didn't measure much. I used all the ingredients in the recipe except the seasoned salt (because I don't have that on hand.) I used a little too much Worschestire sauce, so my patties were a bit mushy. I also diced my onion instead of slicing thinly. The recipe itself was very flavorful. My picky 12 year old absolutely loved her meal. I served it with rice. I will definitely make this again.  I will just use less onions and Worchestire sauce next time!! Very delicious flavor!!

Made recipe as stated (what a concept!!!!) and even my picky eaters loved it.  It was tender enough the toddlers could eat it without problems, always a plus. My soon-in-law asked if I was trying to bribe him?!  LOL!   I doubled the gravy to have enough to put on mashed potatoes.  Comfort food as well as quick and easy!  Added to my food rotation!

I was really pleased with how this turned out!  The only changes I made were really minor.  I opted not to use the sherry and the gravy thickened a little too much for me so I added about a half a cup more broth.  That's it!  It's great just the way it is.

I made as is with three small exceptions: instead of frying the patties and onions together I fried the patties first, then the onions; and I didn't add the second 1/2 tsp of seasoning salt or the onion powder (I didn't have any). The meat was juicy, the gravy tasty and just the right consistency. Delicious!!!. I will be making it frequently.

Doubled the recipe for 4 adults and had 8 patties...1 leftover.  Delicious! Only change was on the 2nd cup of liquid (since I doubled the recipe), I used onion soup mix instead of beef broth. I think mushrooms would be a nice addition also.

Very good! I didn't have sherry and it still came out very delicious. My whole family loved it, no leftovers.

Very very good!  I did as other reviewers suggested and quadrupled the gravy...and I am glad I did.  Makes for great leftovers!  I followed recipe with 2 minor changes...omitted the Sherry as I didn't have any and used 1/2 canned french onion soup and 1/2 beef broth (since I quadrupled it, that is 2 cups of each).  Perfection!

I absolutely love this. Extremely flavorful.  With  kids boys and a husband all that love it also. Didn't make any changes. Thank you for this recipe. Only change is I make extra gravy for my rice or mashed potatoes and sometimes add mushrooms.

Definitely a keeper and I agree with other comments to make extra sauce. Only thing I switched up was adding sauted mushrooms  to the pan when putting patties back into sauce. I served with mashed potatoes. Delish!

This was really good and flavorful. Hubby and I both liked  it.  I didn't have sherry, so I used a little Kitchen Bouquet.  Also made 4 regular patties instead of 8. Otherwise prepared as written.  We ate it over white rice since I had some leftover in the fridge. Look forward to leftovers!

Left out the sliced onions, only because my 96 year old father has become sensitive to them.  Quick & easy, comfort food.   Will definitely make again.

I thought this was really good.  I made as written except I added minced mushrooms to the patties instead of bread crumbs and did not add season salt to the gravy.  It was plenty salty with just the beef broth.

My husband and I loved it. I wasn't sure what to expect, as some reviewers said it was a lot like a TV dinner. That's not the vibe I got, but it was definitely a comfort type food. I didn't have sherry and I'm not sure what flavor it adds, so I subbed Worcester instead. I doubled the beef broth and am glad I did,  or it would have been on the dryer side (however, the meat was juicy. Don't think it wasn't)

Made this as directed in the recipe - no changes - for dinner, to accompany oven fries and a side of mixed veggies, and my fussy child said it was the best meal ever and asked for seconds.  'Nuff said!

Great "comfort food" dish!  Made this last night and husband and I both loved it! Followed recipe except used beef broth and added a few cloves of garlic. Served over cauliflower mashed potatoes with oven roasted broccoli .  May try adding mushrooms next time!

There is one change that I suggest for everyone. Triple the gravy. The flavor is great but there is just to little to go around.

Wow!  This is fabulous and a perfect example of comfort food.  Relatively easy and quick to make, hearty and fulfilling... my family loved it.  You can keep the patties as meatballs and they cook through just as well- it depends on your families' tastes.  I did leave out the sherry because of personal preference, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  What a great surprise- many thanks to the creator!

This is a really good recipe as written. I used 80% gr. beef and made 3 patties, browned and simmered them a little longer because of the thickness and they turned out delicious.

Yummy!!! I did make a couple changes, but only because I thought I had everything that I needed, but didn't.  I ended up using chicken broth instead of beef, and, vanilla extract instead of sherry. It still came out delicious! I can't wait to try it with the proper ingredients!

This was so good! I made it last night and the whole family enjoyed. (Even my six year old, except she wouldn't eat the onions.)It reminded me of having meatloaf, but without having to heat up the oven and wait an hour for it to cook!!
Will definitely make again, next time I'm thinking of adding some mushrooms along with the onions.

I made this as-is. Pretty good. Kids seemed to like it okay. Husband thought it was edible, but bland. (That's not saying much though, he's the pickiest eater EVER.) I thought the flavor was pretty good. I might make again.

I made it exactly as the recipe states and it was a big hit! I'm not a fan of the recipe with all the variations being rated.  Pleas rate the recipe posted, not all the changes you've made. It had a great taste and was very easy to make.  Had with some little potatoes and drizzled the gravy over them...perfection!

Excellent comfort food!  YUM is all I can say!  (Made EXACTLY as written!)  The sherry adds a richness to the gravy for the perfect finishing touch.

Absolutely delicious.  I watched the video and was surprised to note that the hamburger steaks were individually made.  I also cooked down a can of mushrooms and applied them to the onion gravy .  Thank  you am anxious to serve this again!

Double or triple the gravy and use regular sherry, not cooking sherry as it adds unnecessary salt to the gravy.  I made into four larger patties and cook longer.  Also used crushed garlic instead of garlic powder.

I used to make this a LOT when I had five kids and a husband to feed, but even then, I made quarter pound patties.  This is a wonderful week-night dinner with mashed potatoes and veggies of your choice.  Thanks for the reminder...I'll mix up a batch of this and stash three patties in the freezer.

I agree with markeader. The fault lies with allrecipes. As much as I like the site I have to disagree with there rating policy. Have a separate revised column for people who want to submit altered recipes. Then we can judge there revisions!!!!

We've made this many times and this last time was the best because of a couple mistakes! 2 T of red cooking wine not sherry and accidentally used a chicken bouillon cube since I didn't have beef broth. When I realized it I threw in a beef bouillon into the gravy.

I followed the recipe and liked it. I just think it needed extra flavor. Perhaps more spices. I will try it again though. I served mine over rice.

It is amazing. I doubled the onions and the gravy. I did add a little bit of crushed pepper seeds and gravy master. Best gravy I've ever made. Will definitely make again.

Very simple! The only change (I think)  I made was I wasn't sure if salt is the same thing as seasoning salt (beginner cook here) so I used regular table salt. Otherwise I followed to a T!

I have tried many Salisbury Steak recipes but this one is the best by far, the gravy & onions make it a notch above the rest.  Excellent recipe, just like the classic TV dinner taste only better. I have made the original recipe several times and enjoyed it greatly but found that using corn starch & caramelizing onions separately improves the thickness & flavour.

This was a great recipe! The only tweak I made was I added a beef bullion cube with the broth and sherry. I didn't have rice OR potatoes so we ate it over noodles. It has already been requested in double batches!

This was an excellent use of hamburger.  My husband and myself were stuck repeating the same old burger recipes.  we were both impressed with this lovely flavor.  I use a lot of recipes from this site, and I like to prepare them first time just as written.  I am preparing this again tonight NO changes.

1 year old won't eat it, but daddy& I LOVED it! Made just a few minor changes: I used a cheese grater thing for my onion (I read it on 1 of the other comments) & used the smallest side so it was like mush. I used the mush instead of onion powder& sliced onion. I didn't have beef broth, so instead of wine& everything, I just made "brown gravy" in the pan I cooked the burger things in. I dipped the burgers in flour like someone else suggested as welwell (before cooking). I was basically scrounging around for dinner tonight& this was fantastic! (Even though I had to kinda adjust some stuff). Made baked potatoes to go with it.

Lovely recipe. I stuck to exact measurements of ingredients as written, but had no beef broth.  So I made 1 cup of beefy onion soup mix and used that as broth. We like the flavor of food with spicing as enhancement of that flavor, and this recipe did not disappoint.  The gravy was delish!  We accompanied this entree with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies.  The response from the Hubs is all I needed to add it to our list of favs.

A very good recipe! I am one to usually make a recipe my own by changing a few things but this one looked yummy just ad is, so I followed it to a T, and it is wonderful! I doubled the gravy in order to serve it over egg noodles and it was a hit!

Very good! Recommend doubling the broth and sherry. The flour mixture just ate up most of the liquid. When we doubled it it was perfectly saucy. We also tried a batch with ground turkey, with chicken broth instead of beef and really liked that as well!

I made only one change: I substituted drinking sherry for the cooking sherry. Cooking sherry is loaded with salt. The alcohol in the drinking sherry cooks off anyway and leaves the flavor.

I will definitely make this again. I made the recipe as is. The gravy was amazing. The family gave it 3 1/2 stars for taste and I bumped it up to 4 because it was easy to make.The meat could use more seasoning so next time I will use fresh spices/ingredients not dried, ground or powdered.

Ok. If you make this exactly as stated, it is a 3.5/4 star at best. IF you tweak it as follows...it's 5 stars! 

Double flour, and broth. Omit sherry. Then (important) at the gravy simmer stage add 1/4 envelope of Lipton onion soup mix.  THIS is the flavor/spice addition that this recipe desperately needed. Was actually better over rice than potato imo. Add an over easy egg and it's loco moco. Yum!!!!!

We loved this! The only problem was that the medium high heat burnt our onions before we even got the burgers in to reheat in the gravy. May just include the onions in the patties next time.

Great, but needed to double the recipe to make 8 good sized burger patties.  No way our family of four would've been satisfied with the 8 patties from the one pound of beef.  Thank you and God bless for the recipe.

It was simple and easy. Turned out great. The gravy was awesome as well. Gravy is not my strong suit!

This was a hit for my family. I didn't have bread crumbs so I crushed up some crackers and that worked great. Gravy was a little greasy. Would remove some of grease before making gravy next time. But, overall it was delicious.

I have made variations of this recipes multiple times. I prefer using finely diced onions in the patties instead of onion powder. Soy sauce can be substituted for the Worcestershire. I also like to coat the patties in a light mix of Semolina and Adobo. I really like the onions in the gravy - makes a nice texture.

If you are having mashed potatoes with this and would like to pour some gravy over them, double up on the gravy!

Made a nice dinner with the kids. Used Chef Prudhomme's for seasoning salt. I'd imagine you could use whatever you have on hand.

I used a split of ground turkey, ground chicken and lean ground beef.  My son, 5, loved it and he is super picky!  My parents loved it as well as husband.  We regularly use this as the base of our meatloaf now!

I use my own homemade seasoning, a little spicier than anything. I used ground sirloin and mixed with extra seasoning and black pepper, blackened in a large skillet, then added onion slices. Added a little water until burgers were cooked through. Mixed flour and water together and added to skillet with heat turned up, stirred in more seasoning, allowed it to thicken, turned down heat, covered for additional 10-15 mins. Stirred one more time to mix juices and drippings browned sauce. Served with mashed potatoes and a veggie.

Very good! My husband loved it! Omitted the cooking sherry since I did not have on hand and didn't really miss it. Doubled the gravy as other reviewers recommended and was glad I did. Served with mashed redskin potatoes and a veggie for a perfect cool weather meal!

I clipped this recipe 8 months ago and just got around to making it tonight. Sure wish I had made it a long time ago, it was delicious! My husband and both my kids loved it. I followed it recipe to a T (as I always do when making something new) and it was fabulous. I served it with mashed potatoes and peas and carrots and it was awesome!

Excellent recipe and a real family pleaser for my three guys! With hearty appetites I knew I had to double the recipe, and besides not having sherry (and being unwilling to go buy some for just a couple of tablespoons), I can't say it was missed. The recipe for the meat makes it well seasoned and flavorful, and doubling up on the gravy was a good choice. I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans on the side. The only thing I'll do next time is probably triple the gravy for my guys.  I added mushrooms to the gravy only because we love them. I also used a higher grade of beef, ground sirloin, because I was worried about how much grease would release with a higher fat content. It seemed to work out perfectly. This will be in the regular rounds of our weeknight dinners. Easy and quick to make. Thanks so much!

My husband liked it. I will be making it again. The only change I made was I doubled the gravy , I added a little heavy cream to it and also fresh mushrooms. I only put 1 tablespoon of Sherry because it is very over powering, 1 Tbl spoon was just enough !

This recipe makes the best tasting gravy!  I usually have difficulty with getting the gravy to a good consistency of any beef dish but this one is very easy to make.  I have been using this recipes for a few years now.  Hubby and the kids all love this recipe.  I usually add a little more of the ingredients that make up the gravy.

Loved this recipe when I made it before. Also love the fact that I have almost all of the ingredients in my kitchen already. As a matter of fact, I'll be making it again tonight.

This is by far the best Salisbury Steak recipe I've come across. My boyfriend loved it. I've even made this with ground turkey and it still came out great! I definitely agree with reviewers recommending fresh onions/garlic/herbs. But otherwise this recipe is an A+! 

Pair these steaks with a nice whipped mash potatoes, or egg noodles.  Yummy!!

Had to make some quick to make brown gravy to have enough to simmer the hamburger patties for the last 15 minutes, but it was still an excellent meal.

My wife and me really enjoyed this fast, simple, and cheap meal. we added mushrooms and cream to the gravy. Normally I'm not know on the line for having salty food. I know I dont over do it but this dish really needed a bit more salt then called for. besides that it was a success!

I used 90% lean grass fed beef. So I added a tablespoon of butter. 1 cup of beef stock is hardly anything and 1 Tablespoon of sherry, why even bother? I used real sherry. I wanted a lot of liquid to serve over rice.

I did enjoy it however my husband and I both found it to be on the salty side. Next time I will probably half the amount of seasonings. 

Otherwise it was easy and simple to make, hopefully next time less salty

Followed the recipe as written and it turned out great. Next time, I will definitely make more gravy and double the batch because the kids (11 and 13) both wanted double seconds.... Served with baked potatoes.

This was very tasty....definitely will make again.  Only thing I changed was I added sliced mushrooms in with the onions and I doubled the ingredients for the gravy.  The egg keeps the meat moist.  Next time when I'm not in such a rush, I may add more fresh ingredients like minced garlic and fresh herbs.  I used Marsala wine because that's what I had on hand.  Adds a unique taste to the gravy.  Very good!

I love hamburger steak and my current recipe just wasn't getting it anymore and my gravy was too dark for my boyfriend, so I tried this one! I loved it, but the only thing I did was add the whole can of beef broth because I love gravy and one cup just wasn't enough. I think I might omit the egg too, just because it made the patties too slimy for me. I didn't use the sherry either.

I tried this recipe and tweaked it a bit, I used 1 1/2 cups of beef broth and 1/2 a package of onion soup mix, the other half I added to the hamburger mix and omitted all the seasonings.  I also, used 1/8 cup of flour in the gravy mix. It turned out great, my boys took seconds!!  Definitely making it again.

A few minor adjustments... I replaced the garlic powder with 1 minced garlic clove. Form into only 4 patties (8 patties would've been the size of meatballs,seriously). Double all of the gravy ingredients (use salt and pepper instead of seasoning salt). Add 8 oz. sliced portobello mushrooms with the onions. 5 stars!

This was absolutely delicious!! You might consider adding just a little more salt to the beef. I especially loved the gravy!! If you like a lot gravy you'll need to make more to cover your patties completely. I'll be making this again for sure!! Thanks for sharing!!

I have a family of 5 all boys! This came out amazing although I did a little tweaks which I think improved the flavor by far! Instead of garlic powder I used hidden valley ranch seasoning, used 2tbl white Zinfandel instead of sherry & waited to cook the onions after the patties were done. I as well added sliced mushrooms with them when I cooked the gravy. Instead of mashed potatoes I used white rice & seasoned the water with chicken bouillon. I promise u these little tweaks were a huge improvement on the original recipe!!! Hope u all enjoy

I did change this up a bit I use1 pack onion soup mix with 2 cups of water instead of beef broth and then just strained the onions out so I didn't have to many onions I like the fresh onions better. Panko bread crumbs work better than regular. I've tried with both and I think it doesn't dry the meat out and instead of cooking sherry I use vanilla extract it's great flavoring to it. I make this all the time, we love it.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it just as it was written except I doubled it, used some red wine because I didn't have any cooking sherry, and I added some sliced portobello mushrooms with the onions.  The gravy was a little thick so I thinned it out with some water.  My husband wanted to give it 4.5 stars, the kids loved it too.

Delicious!! I too substituted the gravy here with French onion soup. I forgot to add the eggs but this was still super yummy. I mixed the steaks as directed, fired in oil until browned on both sides, put them in a baking pan, covered them with the soup, added some lightly fried diced onion, and baked for 30 minutes (until 165 temp) and they were a BIG HIT!

I made this because it is a nostalgic meal for me. the gravy was too thick.  would have been better with good seasoned beef and onions.

I made this for my family this weekend.  I'm not much of a cook but the recipe is easy to follow and the video makes it foolproof.  They loved it,  raved about it, and some asked for the recipe.

We loved this. It wasn't too hard either. The best part was getting to use my food processor. The onions were sliced in literally seconds. Which made me just giggle with silly excitement. My husband had his and then went back to "make sure there wasn't anything to have to clean up later." Clean plates and clean pans here :)

This was a really good recipe! The first time i made it, felt it was a little bland so I added mushrooms and added a couple of splashes of Worcestershire sauce to the gravy and it was perfect

This is a great recipe! Very simple and very delicious! It is definitely a keeper! Just a note: I found that eight patties would have been very small. I made four good size patties out of the 1 pound of beef. All in all a wonderful recipe!

I had some issues with this recipe, but I freely admit that those were my fault. I had to use chicken broth instead of beef broth, and whatever I did caused the gravy to colagulate and turn out grainy and tasteless, so I just whipped up a packet of brown gravy from the store to serve with the patties. I also used cornbread stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs, and the patties were delicious! My boyfriend was really impressed!

We thought this was quite good. Next time however, I plan to use minced onion and garlic, along with other herbs, to enhance the flavor.

This was really good. i lightly breaded them with panko so i could freeze them without them sticking together. I also dropped the flour and made a reduction gravy using red wine and cognac in place of sherry. That was a bit salty for my taste since the flavor was intensified but really good nonetheless.

This recipe came out awesome!  It was very well written, easy to follow, and was quick to make.   Two thumbs up from the husband, too!  Oh, I did make it into just four patties instead of 8, but that was the only change I made.

I made this when looking for a good, old-fashioned comfort food recipe. It was delicious made exactly as it's printed except I omitted the sherry as I didn't have any on hand. My brother-in-law is the main cook for my sister's family, and he's a very good chef. I made this while staying with them a few weeks ago. The whole time his mouth was watering and he said he hoped it tasted as good as it smelled. It did, and he has added it to his favorite recipes.

Followed the recipe with two exceptions -- omitted the second 1/2tsp of season salt (glad I did) and doubled the gravy.  I had some trouble 'scraping the bits' (aka making the fond) with the onions, flour and then gravy in the pan.  Think next time I'll deglaze with the sherry and/or broth as that tends to work much better for me and the pan I was using, then thicken the gravy after that step.  I really liked the addition of sherry, added a nice flavor.  Might try Italian bread crumbs next time.  Staple ingredients, fairly easy, and came out very good.  Will definitely make this again.

Followed the meat portion of the recipe and the patties were tougher/dryer than I like. Next time I will add A1 to the meat mixture. For the gravy I used one onion sautéed to beginning to carmelize.  Instead of beef broth I used 1can of French onion soup and a splas of red wine and water with flour.  The gravy was good.  For a quicker version, use bubba burgers sauteed in A1 along with the onion gravy.

This was great!   Someone said something about it tasting like a box dinner which is not true.   Maybe the meat they had wasn't great.   I used wheat flour and my husband ate this quickly!  Loved it and will be making it again.   Thank you for the recipe.  :-)

Instead of cooking sherry, I used about 2 T. of apple juice. I sliced a whole onion very thin, probably had over a cup. I made 4 hamburger sized patties. Otherwise followed the recipe and it was very good. Served it with mashed potatoes, made is a classic comfort food dish. I'm excited for the left overs.

This was  delicious! definitely making this again. It was packed full of flavor. My alterations: oatmeal instead of bread crumbs, 4 cloves of fresh garlic instead of powder, Jamaican pickapeppa sauce instead of worcestershire, peanut oil instead of vegetable oil.

Delicious!  The only thing I would change is to use 80% ground beef, because with 85%, we had very little meat drippings left for the gravy.

Delicious and easy!  This was a huge hit! It was easy to make and was perfect served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  I was a little skeptical, because it sounded a lot like meatloaf (and I hate meatloaf!) but I thought I would try it anyways.  This will become a staple!

Hamburger Steak with Onions and Gravy Haiku: "Didn't change a thing. Comforting and tasty meal. But it looked ugly." I chose to ignore all the reviews' suggestions and tweaks and just made it as written; oh wait, this doesn't count, but I made 5 patties instead of 8 out of my 1 lb beef b/c 8 seemed too tiny. We thought it was really good, but there wasn't enough gravy for 3 of us to lube both our "steaks" as well as our potatoes. If I make this again, I'd increase the ingredients to make more sauce.

I loved this recipe .. I just made it for lunch and my parents loved it
But I made 3 adjustments , I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so I searched online for substitution and I found out I can use soy sauce , so I used it .. And I didn't have  sherry and all its substitutions are alcoholic but we don't drink alcohol so I did the whole recipe without it .. Also I used beef stock instead if broth 
However , the recipe turned out really good
Thank you very much

Great basic comfort food and so much quicker than meatloaf. Agree with  others who recommend using fresh garlic and grated onion. Will probably tweak it a bit next time but there WILL be a next time.

Made this recipe last night and loved it! It was raining outside and I'm sick with a cold so I wasn't about to go out to the grocery store for anything. Did a search by ingredients. All I had to work with was some ground beef and I did have some onions. Found this recipe and I had all the ingredients except the cooking sherry. I used red wine vinegar like another reviewer suggested. This recipe will definitely be on our favorites list! When I first cut into the "steak" with my fork, I thought maybe it wasn't done because it cut so easily. But it was done and it just about melted in my mouth. So good. The gravy had a great flavor and our house smelled awesome! I will say that there's no way you can get eight patties from a pound of ground beef. Those would be meatballs. LOL I did four. There's just two of us so we get to have it for dinner again tonight! :)

I always use a recipe as it calls first then if there are ideas my family would love I add it next time if the meal was a hit. This soooo was a hit!!!!! None left at all I may need to make this again really soon. Was thinking I could even add shredded veggies into the beef so I can sneak some in on them lol

This was a great recipe. I didn't have beef broth or sherry wine so I used chicken broth and marsala cooking wine instead - even my 3 year old ate it all up! I did follow suggestions by others and doubled the gravy ingredients (flour and water) and I still could have used more gravy...I will make this again!

Terrific, I'll definitely make this again. The changes that I made are related to my diet. I left out the seasoned salt & Worcestershire. I didn't have the sherry and I used unsalted beef broth. Even with my changes the remaining flavors were delicious together. I also added a few sliced fresh mushrooms to the gravy.

Very easy recipe.  Flavorful way of changing up ground meat.  We didn't have the season salt, but no worries, fresh ground sea salt with low sodium Worcestershire sauce didn't take away from anything.  We will definitely make this again and again.

Had to substitute red wine vinegar for the sherry as I didn't have any. Very good,my only complaint is that there wasn't much gravy. Next time I make this I will double the gravy ingredients.

My family loved this! I followed the recipe as is. I did double the gravy (beef broth and flour) and that was a good decision. All of my boys gobbled it down!! I served it over rice as suggested!

This recipe was exactly what I was expecting. My husband and I both loved the flavors. We poured the excess gravy over our homemade mashed potatoes and were in heaven. If this meal was easier to cook I would probably make it weekly! 

I always use red wine because I don't have cooking sherry. It's excellent. I also sauté sliced mushrooms along with everything. My daughter that doesn't like onions and mushrooms devoured her entire plate.

I followed the instructions to the letter, and my husband who rarely eats beef LOVED IT! So much so that he scraped the plate...LOL...I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and butter rolls. I improvised for more flavor by using two packets of brown gravy. All-in-all, it was great!

I made this recipe last week for my family of four and my father. I followed the direction exactly and it turned out GREAT! Everyone loved it and my mother had the leftovers the next day and agreed that it is excellent. This is the best recipe I have found in a while! I am making it again tonight per my husbands request :)

The food came out pretty good! I would agree on the sentiment that the sherry really does not make a difference. Also you will need more broth then 1 cup. I recommend 2 cups and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. I would also go with another comment in terms of using fresh ingredients and instead of seasoning.

I was pleasantly surprised.  With exception of the sherry, I followed the recipe as written.  I don't like the flavour of sherry and I found the gravy to be fine without it. I thought that the flavours were good, not to bland as some others have suggested.
This recipe can be easily tweaked or adjusted to suit one's taste if necessary.

I have made this exactly as written before and it is amazing. But usually I use this recipe as a base and change it up a little.  I use rice crumbs instead of bread crumbs, olive oil instead of veggie oil, and i add mushrooms. Mmmmm, perfection.

I made ours out of ground turkey to save on fat, but our "salisturkey" steaks were pretty good. The gravy didn't work because the meat was so lean (why we use turkey in the first place) but these had a great flavor. Adding to my list to make again. :)

4 stars with changes. You need to double the sauce, and the cooking time is a bit long. I think you are at risk of making the patties too hard if you cook them that long.

Yum yum yum!!  I made a few modifications - no onion salt just b/c I did not have any (but since the patties were fried with fresh onion I felt that was ok), fresh pressed garlic instead of garlic salt, and I added fresh mushrooms to the sauce.  SO good!!  My husband and I both loved it.  Super easy to make and very very tasty, perfect comfort food for a nice fall/winter evening.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I had beef bouillon cubes and water instead of beef broth and I added water as my sauce turned out a little thick. I served it over mashed potatoes. This turned out amazing!!  This was a huge winner for our family.  My husband and kids both loved it, as did I.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

So far, tastes really good. Beef is tender juicy and goes great with gravy. I was expecting the gravy to be a bit thicker... I might try with less broth or more flour next time.

Easy comfort food. Next time I would use more hamburger, 1.5-2 lbs for a family of four and double the gravy. We didn't have sherry but it was still great. I plan to make this again and again.

Fabulously delicious recipe! I made it exactly as written, except I didn't have cooking sherry. Still came out great! Great down - home country style meal, just what my husband loves! Went perfect with homemade mashed potatoes too...No need to make gravy on the side! :)

I have been trying different recipes for Salisbury Steak, and this one takes it. My family loved it. The only thing I did different was I doubled the beef broth because I did not have sherry. Next time I make this I will double the sauce since we like to put it over mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make this again.

Pretty good recipe but nothing outstanding.  I followed the recipe exactly.  After adding the beef broth & sherry, I realized I should have definitely doubled the gravy.  I wound up adding another half cup of beef broth & the gravy was still thick enough.  So I think you could easily add another full cup & not add more flour.  I didn't feel like the gravy had enough depth to it, so I added a dash of Kitchen Bouquet (careful, just a little will do & too much will ruin your dish).  Added the beef back to the gravy & simmered.  The patties were fork tender, practically falling apart.  A very good dish, but not out of this world.  I think comparing it to an old fashioned TV dinner is selling it a bit short.  It's better than that.  I'll definitely make it again.

Delicious! I've been making this for years & haven't done a review on it until now. Followed the recipe, except I have never used sherry in it, instead I just use pineapple juice. I leave out the black pepper because a family member didn't want it in there. I make my own seasoned salt from a copycat recipe from another site. I also use this recipe as a very flavorful and hardy local hawaii meal called "loco moco" just make put a sunny side egg on top patty and serve it over rice. Delicious!

This was edible but wasn't a huge hit w the kids. If I did it again I would definitely chop the onion rather than slice it to make it more appealing to the kids.

My husband liked it. I found it a bit too salty. I probably would withhold the seasoning salt from the gravy because the broth is already salty on its own. Of course it probably depends on the brand you buy. The prep reminds me of Swedish meatballs. The recipe is super easy to make. I think I will try it again without the salt and see how it comes out.

It was ok, wasn't bad, had a "meatloaf" taste to it we thought. But we did think the spices were a little bland and will try doubling them next time, personal taste we know. Also might ditch the sherry and double the broth. It's a good starter to put our own take on. Thanks for sharing.

I'm just getting started cooking in my old age and really not very good at it so when I first cook something from a recipe I follow it to the letter if possible.  I did that with this and it was great, my bride agreed it was great.  I did have to substitute crushed crackers for the bread crumbs (didn't have any) but we loved it just the same.  Need to figure out how to make more gravy with it for the rice...Great recipe, thanks for sharing....

Followed the recipe for meat mixture to the letter. Doubled the gravy recipe per reviewer recommendations. once I started to deglaze pan with beef stock I added sliced mushrooms. Great recipe. I've never had Hamburger with onions from scratch, always from a t.v. dinner. This was simple and delicious. Will double the meat ingredients and triple the gravy next time. Thanks for this recipe.

Pretty good! It's definitely an easy meal. The only thing was that I didn't see the second 1/2 tsp of seasoned salt on the list of ingredients so I think I added too much by eyeballing it, it was a little too salty. We'll have to see how it turns out next time I make it according to the recipe.

But overall pretty good and I'd definitely make it again.

My entire family, including picky 5 year old, loved this recipe.  I didn't have any sherry, so I left it out.  My can of beef both was 10.5 ounces so I used the entire can and just reduced the gravy down a few minutes.

I didn't prepare the recipe exactly as written.  I didn't have any cooking sherry so I just left it out.  I misread the tsp of salt for a Tbsp so I reduced the Worcestershire sauce which fortunately didn't negatively affect the outcome.  I mixed the ground beef with turkey and added a splash of liquid smoke just because I like the flavor.  Everything else I followed verbatim.  I will definitely make this again!  It turned out terrific and my family really enjoyed it.

loved it.   I didn't have sherry and omitted the season salt - it really didnt need any more flavor or salt - but otherwise I followed the recipe.  I did make more gravy - I could use a ton more gravy. I served it with mashed potatoes.

This a great recipe but I instead of ground beef, I used ground turkey, chopped garlic, and tad more worcestershire.  I highly recommend the ground turkey for a healthier and lighter meal.

I baked this instead of cooking in a skillet, and also didn't have all of the gravy ingredients, so cheated with a packet of brown gravy. Made the patties as directed and put in 9x13" Pyrex in 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.  Sautéed onion (and added mushrooms) in skillet, mixed gravy with that in skillet, spooned onto patties, then put back in the oven for 15 more minutes.  Relatively quick and easy this way, and no fail on the gravy!  I did add a splash of red wine vinegar to gravy.  Mmmmmmm  mmmmmmmmmm good!!!

This is comfort food at it's best. We throughly enjoyed this and will make it again and again. I made very few adjustments. I used fresh garlic instead of the powder, added a little dried parsley to both the burger and the gravy and added used some thinly sliced mushrooms because they needed to be used.. Oh, and I doubled the gravy. Thank you so very, very much Anne Marie. Top notch recipe.

My family and I LOVED this recipe. I made the recipe as is, with the exception of using cube steaks instead of hamburger pattys. Because of this, the cooking time was longer (approx 30 minutes) in order for the steak to get tender. Received raved reviews from everyone. Yummy!!

I've made this recipe twice. But I've always altered it to what I had available. There's really no screwing it up unless you can't cook and have no sense of smell or taste. You just go by taste and smell.

Made this with a little more than a cup of onions, made more gravy, and substituted vanilla for sherry. Soooooooo good!

I loved this recipe.  I changed very little.  I didn't have seasoned salt or cooking sherry, so I used regular salt and simply omitted the sherry.  I made four larger patties instead of 8 small ones.  

The only complaint I had is I wish there was more gravy, so text time I may add an extra cup of broth and a bit more flour?  The taste was just right and comforting.  I served it with mashed potatoes.

This was very quick and easy!  The whole family enjoyed it. I used a bit of reserved bacon fat to give some smokey flavor when I cooked the onions. I will be making this again.

Made this recipe as stated except two things, left out salt due to salt restriction and used Marsala wine because that's what I had. To me the burgers were more like meatloaf. I prefer to taste a little more beef when eating this way. I will make again however not using the bread crumbs and eggs. Gave 3 stars because it was just. "ok" for my taste.

This was so simple and so delicious my hubby finished his plate before i got 2 bites in.  I have never seen him eat like that.  I didn't have sherry so I used red cooking wine.  I am only giving 4 stars because it could use just a tad more seasoning but it will be in our weekly rotation.

My wife and I loved this! It definitely tastes like Salisbury steak. The only change I made was to add chopped onion to the meat mixture, and used flavored breadcrumbs. I can tell the actual recipe would be good, too. I only had a dollop of ketchup left but honestly the recipe probably doesn't need any. I did have the same problem with the patties not holding together very well, and there could have been more gravy. Will make again!

Tried this recipe tonight. Family liked it, but I think it needs something more, I need not use the cooking Sherry. Thinking I may try adding mushrooms to this recipe next time.

I used chicken broth instead of beef. Added milk to it as well. Very bland so added some cumin, cayenne and more onion powder. Was very good, but will add fresh minced garlic next time to both gravy and meat.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated, except that I doubled everything.  The meat came out a bit bland for my taste, but that can easily be improved next time by adding more or different spices.  The gravy came out perfect, and I am TERRIBLE at making gravy!  Will definitely need to double-double the gravy next time.  Perfect with mashed potatoes and peas.  The whole family loved it!

When you rate, cook it as is. I gave four stars because I was missing the sherry and did not substitute. Besides this change to the recipe, this was very good. The gravy was delicious. Made this with mashed potatoes and green beans. My husband has requested this multiple times since I first made it.

Great recipe.  I went straight by the hamburger steak recipe and it was perfect.  I did a little tweaking with the gravy.  I replaced the onions with mushrooms (didn't have onions on hand).  The gravy was too thick and didn't have enough flavor so I added an extra 1/2 cup of beef broth, big tbsp. of margarine, extra sherry, salt, pepper.  It was delicious!  I wish I had doubled up on the gravy as others suggested so I could have extra for my mashed potatoes.

RECIPE IS PERFECT AS IS BUT..... for our preference, I tripled the recipe for my big eatin family, quadrupled the gravy as we love. Added fresh garlic and sliced mushrooms to the onion mixture, fresh chopped parsley and more spices such as oregano to the meat mixture. Use only cornstarch for gravy..no lumps and taste much better. Use less - 1tbs. Of cornstarch to 2tbs. Of flour! (DO NOT SKIP the Sherry, it is A MUST and I always use more as I add it to the onion mixture (I use REAL SHERRY.. YUM). Made this three times and the third I didn't have enough beef broth so I did add a can of golden mushroom soup (which I hate doing) but I have to say it was REALLY GOOD! Served with mashed potatoes (ANOTHER MUST) and fresh spinach. MY FAMILY LOVES THIS RECIPE, Thank you so much!

This was delicious, the only change I made the second time around was that I made a double batch. My family loved it and ate every bite.

Great recipe from my childhood. Like recipes with wine, we omitted the sherry as we don't keep it on hand. It was still perfect. Tasted just like my mom used to make!

I made this tonight. My husband and I loved it. The only slight change I made was that I popped my patties into the oven to cook through because I get paranoid. Not a necessity, just made me feel better about it. Hubby said it was even better as leftovers (which didnt even survive the night) after it had been sitting in the gravy for a couple of hours. Will absolutely be making this again.

I thought this was great; tasted like really good Salisbury steak. I took out the meat and onion when I made the gravy. I used a whole can of broth, an added a couple of extra forks  of flour. I forgot to use sherry and prob won't use it in future just cause it was so good without it.

Good but could be tastier.  Next time I would double the onion powder and worcestershire and use real garlic instead powder.

Deliciously satisfying and easy to make, even for a novice like me. I made 6 patties (rather than 8), omitted the sherry and onion powder (because I didn't have any of either), and served the meal over white rice. As others have suggested, I would definitely recommend doubling the gravy. Also, I might try adding mushrooms the next time I make this as it would further enhance an already tasty dish.

Just made these tonight, and I thought they were great; very tasty! I'll definitely make these again. I used about a cup of fresh bread crumbs since I didn't have any dry crumbs, and I didn't have any sherry. Also, I drained some of the hamburger grease off, so I added just a little water at the end because my gravy was a bit thick.

This recipe was very tasty and my family enjoyed it. As recommended by previous reviews I doubled the gravy, but otherwise followed it to a "t". I served this with mashed potatoes and would recommend tripling the gravy if you choose to do the same. The flavor of this earned 5 stars but because you need to double/triple the gravy, thereby modifying the original recipe, I gave it 4 stars.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it didn't turn out. The hamburger steaks had good flavor, but were still raw in the middle (I tried the outside edges, which were cooked). The gravy didn't thicken, and didn't mix well, either. So, I threw it out and made regular brown gravy. I give it 3 stars due to the good flavor of the hamburger. Won't be making this again!

Excellent, excellent recipe!  I used a little too much oil, which turned out all right because it made extra gravy.  The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because although the gravy was excellent and the steaks were nice and tender, they were a little bland.  A little extra Worcestershire would probably fix that.  All in all, a great recipe!

I used panko breadcrumbs and used 1/2 cup. Added ground mustard. The oil was too much for my 80/20 beef. I wouldn't use it in the future Unless I had 96/4.

I add a whole can of broth and another teaspoon of flour with the 2 tablespoons, salt, pepper & garlic to the pan for the gravy. Just to make more & to give it more flavor! This is a keeper though, no doubt!

This is a wonderful recipe! I follow it to a T and couldn't be happier. The kiddos even like it and it makes the kitchen smell wonderful. I use a ground venison/pork mixture since I have venison readily available and it comes out great!

UPDATE: we like it so much AS IS, that I now double the meat mixture and triple the gravy to have some left over to go over rice or mashed potatoes. No need for changes with this recipe. Thanks for submitting.

This was more like a meatloaf texture. Not the way we typically eat it in Texas. Also be careful with the salt. Gravy was a bit salty. I added Worcestershire sauce to it to give it more flavor. Not bad just not what I expected.

Good comfort food!  I used French onion soup and a little beef broth with flour for the gravy. Yum!

This was really good. Even our 3 year old liked it minus the onions. Lo
I would cut thegarlic back as we found it over whelming the flavor of the patties. This is a keeper with that modification.  Tammy

Super yummy, and the perfect treat for a cold day! Made a couple of minor changes...I mixed the meat with the seasoning and bread crumbs a couple of hours ahead of time and let the mixture sit in the fridge so the flavours couple develop more. Also added some minced garlic, smoked paprika and a couple drops of hot sauce to the mix. I always make sure to cook a tiny bit of the hamburger mixture and taste it ahead of time to make sure the seasoning is right.... I highly recommend doing so, then you can make sure it's perfectly seasoned and adjust as needed before you go and cook the whole batch of meat. 

I browned the patties and then removed them from the pan, and then cooked the onions until they were very well browned. It gave the gravy  a very rich onion flavour. Didn't have any cooking sherry so I just left that out. Added a couple dashes of Worcestershire to the gravy, and needed a bit of extra beef broth as it was a little thick for my liking. Served it with garlic rice and roasted veggies. It was delicious!

Great!  I will never use another hamburger steak recipe.   I like to serve this  with mashed potatoes, green bean casserole, and hot buttery rolls.  Makes for a wonderful warm filling meal on a cold winter night.

Made this last night following the recipe exactly. It was easy. Meat was tender, gravy flavorful and I've saved it to make it again. *Tip: we don't keep Lowrys on hand so I found a recipe for seasoned salt online and made it in seconds. I added a little extra seasoning "to taste" while making the gravy- we just prefer stronger flavors but the recipe "as is" is great!

This was amazing! My picky 3 year old ate it and asked for seconds! In lieu of seasoned salt or cooking sherry (I didn't have any) I threw in a dash of paprika and some Nature's Seasoning.Everything else I did exactly as written. I had to make something quick and tasty, and this exceeded my expectations! =)

This was Superb!  I knew I wanted to double the amount of gravy, so I just used a whole can of beef stock.  I didn't change anything else and we loved it!  So easy and almost no mess... great on the clean up:)

My family loves these.  The only item I don't add is the sherry just because I never have it on hand!  I buy beef in bulk and always freeze a bunch of these.  They're soooo good.

My husband says babe, why don't you try hamburger steak tonight. Ok, let me find a recipe, so I stumbled upon this jewel.  These were delicious!!! I did not have all ingredients so I made substitutions. No egg, I used 3 tbsp. of mayo, No Worcestershire, I used 1 tsp. of Heinz 57.  No Sherry, I used white cooking wine.  No onion or garlic powder, I used 1 tbsp. Cavender's Greek seasoning.  This was the most flavorful ground beef I've ever tasted! Very moist and juicy. Only thing I would do differently is doubling up on the gravy because we love lots of that stuff, LOL...kids gobbled this up and asked for seconds.  Definitely a recipe that we will make regularly for years to come.

Very easy and the whole family liked it.  I browned the onions after the meat (no room in my skillet).  I doubled the gravy and just used a splash of vinegar instead of the sherry.  It was great served with mashed potatoes.

My family went bonkers over this meal! I served it mashed potatoes the first time and rice the second time. We didn't have any leftovers and that in itself is amazing!

Great recipe!  My whole family loved it.  I made some garlic mashed potatoes with it and put some of the gravy over them.  Wonderful!  As others have said, the gravy is delicious so I took their advice and tripled the gravy!  Glad I did as it is all gone!

This was easy, and tasty. I wasn't sure how it was going to come out, but it was wonderful with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob.  I followed the recipe to a "tee" as I try to do with all new recipes and it was very good. I made my patties earlier in the day and let them refrigerate until I was ready for supper.  Thanks for the recipe.

I doubled all the ingredients so I could make 8 nice sized patties and a sufficient amount of gravy. For the seasoning I used Montreal Steak Seasoning (adding it as the recipe states and sprinkling it to the tops of the patties). I also added about 1/8 tsp of cayenne to the mixture hoping for a little kick but it was unnoticeable so next time I'll add more.  I lightly dusted the patties with flour before adding them to the hot oil which gave them a nice flavorful crust. I skipped adding the onions until after the patties had browned and were removed to the plate. I just felt like it would be better that way. GRAVY: I should have paid attn to how much additional grease the patties made in comparison to how much flour I added. I started off with the 2 tbsp called for but figured since I doubled the rest of the ingredients I should add 2 addt'l tbsps. It still looked thin so I ended up adding 8 tbsp to the flour trying to get it to thicken up. Little did I know as soon as I added the broth it sucked all the flour and oil up and it was a thick mess. I was able to save it by adding almost 2 cans of beef broth but that's a note to self. My DH and son both took one bite and said it was delicious and they are brutually honest with my cooking. BTW, I didn't have sherry so that was omitted. It wasn't missed.

I doubled this recipe by adding a lb of ground turkey.  My husband isn't big on onion so we omitted the sliced onion.  However I did add a bit of minced dried onion to the burger.  Didn't have the sherry so made it w/o & tripled the gravy.  Very good and well liked

YUM! I only made substitutions because of what i had on hand! I used fresh garlic for the patties and omitted the egg. I didn't have onions so i threw some green bell pepper in the oil for flavor as the patties cooked. I usually use the cream of mushroom soup hamburger steak, this was my first time making my own gravy and WOW! Thanks so much for the recipe! I didn't even have beef broth so i made 1 cup of water mixed with a couple tablespoons of soy sauce & seasoned salt for the broth and it still turned out to make amazing gravy! Definitely making again!

This recipe is soooo good and so easy. I changed a couple things but kept it mostly the same. I had some italian bread crumbs that was mixed with parmesan cheese that needed to be use so I added that instead of just the bread crumbs(1/4 c.). I also didn't have any sherry so I left that out and I used elk burger. The hubby loved it too. Definite keeper.

Yummmm, we make this once a month. So easy and filling, true comfort food the only thing I recommend doing is making more of the gravy, must add it to the mashed potatoes.

There are six of us, so I used a little over three pounds of beef chuck.  Everyone thought it was great!  I did not measure any of the ingredients, simply because I am fairly good at eyeballing things.  I know that I added more than what was called for, because we like flavor.  I was out of fresh onions, so I had to eliminate that ingredient.  I also did not put the Worcestershire sauce in it.  Do not much care for it.  I also did not put any sherry in the gravy and did not add any extra salt to the gravy.  All in all, it was a great recipe and will definitely cook this again, with all of my little alterations.  :)

The only thing I did differently, aside from doubling the gravy, is substituting the sherry.  I didn't have any on hand, so I used white cooking wine.  It was delicious.  Next time I will try it with the sherry and probably triple the gravy!  So delicious.  This is a keeper!

A nice easy recipe for hamburger steak n' gravy! I made it exactly as written except my w. sauce was low salt, and I used red cooking wine since that is what I had. Worried about the salt content but it was just right I thought. Next time I will double the gravy as others mentioned and we are gravy dippers. Served with rice and will try mashed potatoes and noodles another time. Thanks for the keeper!

I made it tonight and thought that it was very good. The only thing I changed was I added a smidge of ketchu and took the onions out before I added the patties back in. DH hates the texture of onions but likes the flavor. Family really liked it. Thanks for posting! =} With the personal tweak, it was a 5 star recipe!!

I made this tonight and my husband and I thought it was very good. I followed the directions exactly except that I left out the cooking Sherry since I did not have any.  It was very good without it.  As indicated on other reviews, I could not get 8 patties out of 1 pound of beef so I ended up with only 6 patties.  I decided to double the gravy and I'm glad I did!  The only change I would make next time is to sauté the onions with some fresh mushrooms until soft and caramelized before frying the patties.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe. Made it on a whim for me and my toddler's dinner since the husband works late. Made it with garlic potatoes and broccoli. Tasted excellent, toddler devoured, and kept well for husband so he could eat it when he got home. Full of flavor, thanks I will make again.

made this for our dinner last night and it was a great treat.  i added fresh finely chopped parsley, half a finely chopped onion, finely chopped green pepper, and fresh garlic to the meat.  still used the recommended seasonings, which resulted in a very flavorful burger. i did double the ingredients for the gravy, and also added fresh garlic and fresh sliced shrooms with the onion.  didnt have any sherry so just omitted it, and added a shake of worstershire instead.  served with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob.  this was a fantastic comfort meal which reminded me of somthing my mom would make.  loved it.

If I could give a 4.5 I would.  I added mushrooms with the onion.  I did not have cooking sherry on hand so I omitted it all together.  I also opted not to use the additional season salt for the gravy as I don't think it needed it. The flavor for this recipe is spot on.  I don't know when I had better.  That being said, I am from the South and we love to have extra gravy for our taters or biscuits that you might serve along with this. I had to triple the amount of beef broth and flour to have enough gravy.  I will definitely be making this again!

These were so good.  The onions make the patties really sweet and the gravy on top is a clutch move. I notice the the recipe is formatted for four servings, but makes eight patties.  I think they would be equally good if they were four servings of four patties, but that's just me.

On the real, I don't care for rice or gravy so I made this for my  family. This was great, and I wouldn't give a 5 star rating  if I wouldn't eat it again by  choice. I am  thinking  next  time I  will add mushrooms  to  the gravy just for me. But we really  liked this!!!

This was a good meal.  I did substitute ground chicken for the hamburger and the family didn't even notice.  I didn't have sherry so I used marsala cooking wine and it still tasted great.  I wish I had doubled the gravy ingredients because there wasn't enough!  :)  Will definitely be making this again.

I want to give the recipe as it stands 5 stars but I couldn't it make it that way. It went a bit wrong for me when I started making the meat mixture..and I realized I didn't have any eggs left. I read somewhere for meatloaf mixtures that tomato paste can act as a binder sub so I tried that as I had half a can saved from the night before. It may have enhanced the taste but I don't think it did much as a binder. The only thing I will do differently next time is that I will add the broth before the flout when I make the gravy because I ended up with big flour clumps and it didn't thicken properly. I ended up adding a can of golden mushroom soup to thicken and give a nicer consistency. It was still delicious even in spite of those two hiccups and my guy loved it. Oh and I tripled the gravy as I read reviews and seemed like a great idea.

This was excellent!! I made very little changes. I added mushrooms with the onions. and I subbed 3/4 cup of red wine for the small amount of sherry. I was also using double the amount of meat, so I added a total of 1 1/2 cups broth. I left out the seasoned salt. Everyone loved this dish! Simmering the meat in the gravy makes it so tender! Excellent with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts.

I was looking for something different to do with my ground beef, and this one is a winner.  Thanks for the great recipe. Really nice combo of flavors.  Only thing I didn't have on hand was the sherry.  My hubs LOVED it also & said it was so much more flavorful than "plain old salisbury steak."  And yes next time I will double or triple the gravy. We served it with grean beans and some boiled potatoes.  Yummy!

This recipe was delicious!! I followed it to the T (but did make 6 instead of 8 patties) but otherwise everything as written.  It was very flavorful and the gravy yummy!  Hubby said to add to the rotation! lol! Definitely will make again!

When my husband saw this cooking on the stove he exclaimed "Comfort Food!!"  I made the pattie portion of the recipe as written, but doubled the gravy and used home made beef broth that had just a hint of smoke flavor. Ate it with mashed potatoes and steamed green beans.  It made 4 average size patties.  We had the left overs for lunch today since we are snowed in with 13 inches!  Happy plates all around both meals.  Thanks for sharing - it's DELISH!

The only thing I ever leave out is the sherry simply because I never have it on hand. Everything else I do as it is in the recipe and I can never get enough of it. This recipe is almost as easy as hamburger helper but waayyyy tastier :) - Thanks for an awesome recipe that really doesn't need any tweeking!

We made one change: used beef consomme instead of beef broth, for a bit thicker gravy. Was only able to make 4 decent size patties, not 8 like recipe said. Very good flavor and so easy!

This was simple and easy comfort food...served with mashed potatoes. I ended up using a can of french onion soup  (non-condensed)and a can of beef broth as I doubled the gravy and have a cold so I had no interest in cutting loads of onions... it really turned out great- plenty of flavor. I did put some onions in the ground beef and seasoned as I normally would for a hamburger... just really simple and delicious! Thank you for submitting this!

Very good.  I didn't have beef broth in the pantry, so used Lipton beefy onion soup mix.  I also let everything simmer about an hour.  We both really liked this moist hamburger steak.  The meat was perfectly seasoned for us.  Great easy recipe.  Thanks

Whole family flipped over this recipe.  Doubled it and had leftovers for the next day.  We ate it with boiled new potatoes and steamed peas and it was terrific... the gravy's what really puts it over the top!  Didn't have sherry, so I added a splash of red wine and it was SUPERB.  Delicious and budget-friendly.  Definitely a keeper!

I tried this for the first time last night, and it was a big hit with my family.  I served it with a side of white rice, but it was suggested that it'd be even better if I served it with mashed potatoes.  I followed the advice of others, and did triple the gravy, and was glad I did!  I've been asked to make this dish again.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly - we are GF -- so no bread crumbs or wheat flour was used. I did use a GF flour in the gravy. Not fond of pepper so omitted that. Used water instead of broth. Added a few dashes of steak sauce. Added onion powder, garlic powder and season salt per recipe. Very good over baked potatoes!

I have never made a hamburger steak this good! I needed to make it gluten free, so I substituted flaxseed for the breadcrumbs. Also, I didn't have any sherry, but I drizzled a little kitchen bouquet into the gravy for a little depth of flavor. My entire family loved this one-even the picky kids.

I have made this recipe before and it gets better every time I make it. That is because I change a few things alone the way. I don't recommend cooking the onions with the burgers, I suggest cooking them in the hamburger grease after. I then add the flour making a rue. I use red wine instead of sherry (I don't like sherry). Oh most important, prior to forming the patties, but your bowl, seasoning everything that is going in the burger in the refrigerator until you are ready to use. DON'T OVER MIX.

My husband and I enjoyed this. It would definitely be best with mashed potatoes (be sure to double your gravy!) I followed the recipe exactly and had a little trouble with the gravy. I used very lean hamburger and didn't have enough drippings. I ended up adding a few tablespoons of butter to start my gravy. It still came out nicely but I may omit the sherry next time. I didn't care too much for that flavor. Overall it was good and satisfying. I would make this again.

This is delicious.  The sherry makes it.  I used really good ground sirloin steaks, and it was excellent.  Served on freash buns for sandwhiches.  Thank you.

I was totally surprised with this recipe. My husband declared it a "keeper" and it was so very easy to prepare! A perfect recipe to make after a busy day at work with ingredients on hand. Didn't change a thing and will make it again very soon.

Very good, both my boys loved it!  As suggested double the gravy. Also I dont know how they made 8 patties with 1 lb of burger, I was able to make 6 "burger sized" patties, 8 would have resulted in very small and paper thin patties.

One of my favorite dishes to make with hamburger.  I love this during the winter, comfort home cooked food at its best.  I don't use the sherry, it turns out fine without it and I double the amount of the gravy I make so I can serve it over homemade mashed potatoes.  My husband and kids just love this one, they are always super excited to get this for dinner!  Thanks Anne Marie, it is a recipe I will use over and over again!

I will use this again.   I did add finely minced fresh green peppers ,onions,carrots (about 3 TBSP each) to the beef mixture just for some extra veggie power and to moisten the hamburger steaks.  I did double the gravy and the slight sweetness with the sherry is perfect.  After putting all back into the pan and cooking on low for ~30 mins it was truly delicious.

I made this for my ULTRA picky and gluten free kids, and it was a huge hit!  My only modification was a gluten free flour, gluten free Worcestershire sauce, and I replaced the Veg oil with Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  I served it over white rice. The kids and husband demanded seconds and is now on our rotation of meals.

Yummy recipe!  We all enjoyed it!  Although, I think I want to omit the sherry next time and maybe use seasoned pepper instead of seasoned salt to get a more savory flavor.  Just a thought :)

Great comfort food! Nicely seasoned. I didn't have sherry so subbed Worcestershire sauce and it worked out fine. Yes, double the gravy if you are serving mashed potatoes.

Good dish--filling and satisfying. I used gravy mix as well as the flour--and it was still a little under-flavored. I added onion powder, garlic powder, and Kitchen Bouquet to the gravy.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful!  I didn't have cooking sherry and read that vanilla extract was a suitable substitute, so I used that.  I also had two pounds of beef, so I doubled the gravy and made four large "steaks" (and cooked it longer).  It was delicious!  I'll be making this again.

Very nice.  I added mushrooms to the sauce.  I also added a tablespoon of sour cream at the end.  Adds a nice creamy texture to the gravy.  Can't wait to make this again.

This was an ok "base" recipe, however I found it to be bland. I did add basil and oregano to it and added addition spices to the gravy after tasting it. But it does whip up quick!!! Thanks for posting

These were good but not near enough gravy.  I only cooked 3 patties and wasn't enough even for  3.  Will make again, and double the gravy part.

I tried this recipe last night and overall I was satisfied. I used the Italian breadcrumbs (because that was the only kind I had) and it was really good. The ONLY problem that I had with this recipe is that there was not enough gravy. I expected the steaks to be somewhat "smothered" but the amount of gravy this recipe made was only just enough to cover the steaks.

This was excellent and perfectly flavoured! I took one of the reviewers suggestions and used ground angus. The patties were delish! Since the meat was fresh, I made a few extras and tossed them in the freezer.

I haven't tried this particular recipe,but I have one equally as good and less time consuming...Instead of all the ingredients mentioned, take McCormick's dried brown gravy mix and McCormick's dried onion mix from the local grocery store prepare per the instructions..Cook the hamburger steaks before adding gravy..Simmer in the brown & onion gravy mix for 30 minutes--just as good and in way less time & effort...

I do a very similar Salisbury Steak, add the minced onion to the burger mixture & make milk gravy instead of brown. Serve with mashed potatoes & garlic green beans & the guys are licking the empty skillet clean!

We've been making this for years. It's an old family favorite/standby. when we can't think of what to eat it's "Hamburgers mashed potatoes and peas" but our old version was with everything instant except the beef. Even my dad and my ex husband can make it.

Was a Great recipe. Only change was a lack of cooking sherry. I used Mirn instead and it was very good. Just a slight sweetness to it. My husband loved it and said all it needed was a little cracked pepper. Thanks for another wonderful recipe to add to out rotation.

This was delish!  I omitted the cooking sherry because I didnt have it and it turned out great.  Quickly becoming a favorite at our house. I made a hash brown casserole instead of rice.  Very tasty!

Wonderful dish, my whole family enjoyed.  Only thing I did different was put fresh garlic into the patties.  I do want to add my sauce was not very thick, but that was more then likely my cooking.

YUMMY!!  This is a fantastic recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, the only exception being I used regular salt where it called for "seasoning salt".  VERY TASTY.  The gravy comes out so good.  If it tells you anything, my picky 2-year-old who normally dislikes the texture of hamburger patties and my husband who normally doesn't like this sort of recipe both gobbled it up and asked for seconds.  This one is definitely going into the meal rotation.

Super easy weeknight meal!  Since I am trying to lower my fat intake, I omitted the egg and used 93/7 beef.  With the lack of egg, I was worried that it wouldn't stick together or be tough, but it was fine.  I can't believe I've never made a hamburger steak before!  Great with mashed potatoes and a veggie.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight, and didn't change a single thing - (oh, dang - I did double the gravy, but everything else was the same) and it was WONDERFUL.  I can't believe this is a pound of hamburger meat.  I used 90/10 beef, and it was the perfect amount of fat in our opinion.  Seasoning was perfect - all 4 of us loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe!  Next time want to add mushrooms!

This is a real winner!  I made only one addition, mushrooms, at the end.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I could not believe how much my husband enjoyed it.  I will be making this one for years to come.  Thanks again.

The texture of the meat is similar to that of meatloaf.  Not a fan.  The gravy had a good flavor.

Made this for supper last night and we all loved it. I did double the gravy and didn't use the onion, sherry or the second 1/2 t seasoned salt but it is definitely going in my recipe files for future use.

Enjoyed every bite!  It was fast and easier then I thought it would be.  I added my own seasonings to it instead of the salt and the sherry. McCormick GrillMates (Less Sodium) Spicy seasoning.  I would recommend this dish for people that need something to do with the left over ground beef.   My husband enjoyed it from the first bite!

We loved these.  It made 6 patties. I didn't have cooking sherry so that was omitted.  I also quadrupled ingredients for the gravy.  We love gravy.  I did add a can of cream of mushroom soup to the gravy.  I almost always add it to my gravy.  It makes it creamier and adds to the flavor.

My mom used to make this all the time with wide egg noodles and if she wanted to make it quick, she would just use a jar of Heinz gravy. So simple, but I loved it. Ahhh, the 70's.

The only thing I hold against this recipe is to not cook the onions right away. Other than that, the hamburger steaks were good. Both my kids ate all of their servings but they did not like the sauce. Maybe too rustic in flavor for their palate but I thought it was tasty.

This was pretty darn good. I left off the Sherry because I didn't have any, but added worcheshire to the sauce.  I found that there wasn't enough oil to make a good sauce so I had to add some after pulling the meat out. Would probably double the sauce next time. Would be great with mushrooms too!

I made this for dinner last night, and this was excellent!!! The only changes I made were…… I substituted the listed seasonings for a half a pack of Lipton Recipe Secrets “Beefy Onion” seasoning, which gave the ground beef a lot of flavor; and so the gravy would not be bland, I seasoned the gravy with Seasons All salt, pepper, garlic power and onion power. My husband and daughter love it and they suggested to add mushrooms the next time I make.  We ate it with egg noodles; but the next time around I think I am going to try it with brown rice.

I made this for dinner tonight...the only change I made was chicken broth for the cooking sherry (only because I didn't have the sherry)...I wouldn't change a thing!!!  It is FABULOUS as is!  My husband LOVED it, and my 2yo daughter ate it up too.  And she doesn't normally eat ground beef!  Fantastic recipe!!!

This was excellent!! My ten year old keeps asking me when I'm making it again. I left out the sherry but only because I didn't have any and it was still terrific. This will be a new stand by in our house. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!! :)

Delicious!!! Didn't have the onion, garlic or seasoned salt, so used Italian Seasoning instead.  Served with mashed potatoes and new carrots.  Going to be a favourite.

After eating summer salads for days, my family was ready for some meat and potatoes and this was perfect! I added mushrooms to the gravy but other than that I followed instructions. My husband raved!

I am not a fan of gravy but this was good!  What's better is I already had most of the ingredients on hand.  I didn't have beef broth but had chicken broth so used that.  I also didn't have any more worcestershire sauce so I used A1 steak sauce instead (both per the food substitution chart).  I used the Panko breadcrumbs I had on hand which really held the patties together well.  Next time and, yes, there will be a next time, I will add very finely chopped onion to the meat mixture ... or ... maybe some minced garlic.

followed recipe exactly with the only modification on the gravy & used entire can of broth as other members suggested for more gravy.  Very nice, easy to prepare.  Will use this again.

Easy comfort food meal that the kids really enjoy. I've made this several times, but had forgotten about it until my kids reminded me!  I always double the gravy, and make 4-6 patties instead of 8.  We usually serve it with garlic mashed potatoes and a green veggie.

Fabulous comfort food. Like other, I doubled the sauce, used onion soup instead of beef broth, and wine instead of sherry. The extra gravy was the perfect accompaniment to mashed potatoes.Served along with broccoli, this made for a picture-prefect, and palate-perfect meal.

These were very good - not a single complaint from the family.  I used a splash of red wine, since I didn't have sherry.  I made the mixture up into patties earlier in the day so dinner time was a snap.  I served it with mashed potatoes, and it made a nice, comforting meal on a rainy day.

This was just ok in my book. The kids wondered why they were getting a hamburger patty on pasta and no bun. I didn't feel like i had enough sauce. I would atleast double it next time.

This is fantastic!!  I left out the sherry as I am not a fan.  Also, I added mushrooms to the gravy.  Besides the sliced onions,  I also diced some onions and mixed in with the ground beef which added flavor.

This recipe is perfect as is, I did not change a thing! The next time I may just leave out the salt because it wasn't really needed anyways what with all the herbs and spices and whatnot. I'm going to make this again for lunch and can't wait to eat!

This was great. I fried up some mushrooms and very thin onions until done then added the meat patties and cooked everything all together.  I used turkey gravy instead of the beef broth and sherry. I made mashed potatoes and layered it all. Mash potatoes then the patty with onions and mushrooms then poured the gravy ove the top! It was really beautiful and very Tasty~ Yummo!

Very tasty! Made the following revisions: Used 1.5 lbs ground beef, 2 small eggs, doubled the seasoned salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and Worcestershire, and used 1 can French onion soup in addition to the beef broth to make the gravy.  Recommend adding a splash of red wine to the meat & onion while it cooks, as well as to the gravy while it simmers.  Adds a delicious sweet flavor to the dish.  Serve with mashed potatoes for an easily prepared, filling dinner.

Used a few member's suggestions, adding milk & subbing vanilla for sherry.  Not sure if the vanilla did anything lol but it didnt ruin the taste!  Also making mashed taters, thinking this may become a staple in our house...the harshest food critics (my toddlers) love it!

This was so good!  I made it as directed and my family raved over it; definite keeper.  Last night I tried it out with boneless, thick-cut pork chops and it was just as good if not better.  Added white wine to sauce and it just made all the flavors pop.  Try it!

My whole family loved this including my picky 7 year old.  The only things I changed was to leave out the onion powder, use powdered beef bouillon instead of beef broth, and leave out the sherry.  Great recipe!!!

I fixed this dish last night.  It was very tasty.  The only thing I did different was to add more beef broth.  Also next time I would add alot more onions.  I also added mushrooms and that enhanced the flavor.

So good. I followed the recipe and it turned out wonderful. Had to add a little more liquid as gravy was still a bit thick with just 1 cup of liquid.  My kids loved it. Especially my one son who does not like onions!!! He couldn't even tell there were any!  Served over mashed potatoes. Was a big hit!

Loved this recipe! Doubled the recipe then made it two days in a row.  So simple! The 2nd day I did double the gravy, there isn't enough of it. Also added mushrooms and used the vanilla suggested since I don't have sherry.

This was excellent, a very nice comfort food.  Instead of garlic powder I used fresh garlic 2 cloves.  I also threw in a portobello mushroom and some green peppers into the gravy, so good.    For the gravy I used a powder mix from Sam's club and made four cups worth cause our family loves a lot of gravy.  Made it in the pan the burgers had cooked in.     Served it over Basmati rice made with chicken stock.

The best comfort food ever!!!!  I made the gravy as stated the first time but used my own method the second time and it turned out much better.  Even taking that into consideration it is still a five star as published.

This is a great quick receipe.  The only thing that I would (am) change, is there isn't enough of the gravy.  I didn't add the cooking sherry and it still came out great.

Recipe was easy to follow - wasn't real thrilled with the gravy - felt it lost a depth of flavor - might have been easier to open a jar of brown gravy to go with it.

Another great recipe! I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious. I didnt have any sherry, onion powder,garlic powder or beef base so I subbed greek seasoning and chicken base and it turned out very tasty. Next time I make it I will get the sherry etc and see if it is even better

This rating would be 3.5 if I could. It was reletivly easy to make. I don't like a greasy taste, which this had (hence the less than 4 score). I did have all the ingredients (minus the sherry). I used orange juice in place of sherry. The flavor was great. My son didn't like it, but my Husband enjoyed it enough to give it a personal score of 4! This is a great easy weeknight dinner. Thanks!

I liked this recipe, and so did my four-year old...which was a little odd, because he's the pickiest of picky.  My 3 year old didn't like it at all and I couldn't blame him on that one: we both thought the large amount of pepper was "too spicy"--I would half it next time.  I also did not have sherry on hand, but the gravy tasted great without it.  Perhaps next time I'll use more ingredients to get more gravy, since there wasn't much to go over the rice.  One reviewer said they used vanilla?  Maybe it's just because I haven't tried it, but that seems a bit overboard and yuck.  Who knows though, they might have stumbled on a culinary revelation.

My family really thought these were a hit!! The kids loved them too. I also made some adjustment to the recipe. I made 8 med size patties out of 1lb & a 1/2 of beef. I used pineapple juice instead of sherry and it worked for us.  Finally, after I added my flour and beef broth to the onions, I added 1 cup of milk and let it come to a boil. Then I mixed 2T of flour with 1/2 cup of milk in a little dish and slowly poured it into the broth mix. I served this onion gravy over french fries & had the patties on buns. We also put fries with the patties on a bun & topped it with the onion gravy.....This is delish!!

Excellent recipe, we had no sherry, so added a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of cream of celery, absolutelely delicious. Second time around we used ground venison and a couple of sausage patties added to it, fantastic, thanx for sharing this recipe, it will be a staple in our house.

The family raved!    I added mushrooms after I took out the patties and cooked them a few minutes with the onions before sprinkling with flour.  Didn't use sherry (didn't have any) so I used a little more broth.  Followed other reviews and added some milk (maybe 3/4c) slowly and heating through just before returning the patties.  Will make it again!

I just made this tonight. The only thing I did differently was add a splash of white wine vinegar (ONLY A SPLASH!) and a little bit of vanilla, since I didn't have sherry. I also added a little bit (maybe 1-2 tbs) of heavy whipping cream. And it's FANTASTIC! I really love the flavor. Thanks for sharing!

this is definatley easy, tasty and great if you are in the mood for some good comfort food on a cold night.  I doubled the sauce so we would have more to serve with.  I served over mashed potatoes. I make this every couple weeks.

I thought this was pretty good, but it needed something.  I did end up making more gravy than was called for, I added one can of Campbell's French Onion soup in place of some of the beef broth.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  It definitely needed more salt, and some pepper.  I still felt something was missing.  Next time I will try adding some fresh garlic to the onions and meat, and maybe some oregano to the meat mixture.  Still all in all, pretty good served over rice.  I will make it again.

I needed something quick and easy to make my kids for dinner...this recipe hit the mark. I served it with white rice and steamed broccoli simmered in the left-over beef broth. Thumbs-up from all three on this recipe;definitely a keeper.

Pretty easy to make and quite tasty.  Unfortunately, similar to others, I did not have sherry so made it without.  Followed the recipe except added more beef broth as the gravy was too thick with only 1 cup and used regular salt since I did not have seasoned salt.  Other than that, it was very good and I would make it again.

I thought these had good flavor and were easy to make, my husband thought they were good, but a bit salty.  I didn't realize I was out of sherry so I changed the gravy and used a can of cream of mushroom soup and some water instead and that was good.  I let the gravy cook with the meat for about 15 minutes on low to just get the flavors blended. I think the saltiness my husband tasted came from that soup. Next time I would go strictly by the recipe or use low sodium soup.  Otherwise, a good fast recipe for those days when you're just looking for comfort food. Served with mashed potatoes and corn.

Great recipe!  I didn't have sherry but it tasted great without it.  Other than that, I didn't change anything about the recipe.  Some things I did to help make it easier was to just take an onion and cut it into thin slices using a mandolin and threw them on the skillet with some olive oil while I formed the steak servings.  Served this with some baked potatoes and it was wonderful.  Bon appetite!

Awesome! I added an egg to the mix and formed into patties stuffed with tiny bits of onion, cooked ham, and shredded cheese.  Stuffed hamburger steaks and some Mac & cheese on the side, my kids had to race their father to fight for seconds, lol.

This was AWESOME!!!  My son and I LOVED it, and we are both very picky.  My husband thought it was a little bland, but what does he know.  I did use turckey instead of hamburger because of health reasons.  I also used chopped onion in the patties because I did not have onion powder.

This was GREAT! I couldn't get over how easy and flavorful this recipe was. I also didn't have any sherry and was fine. I might double the gravy next time just to have more to put over the mashed potatos. I will most definitely be making this again!!

This turned out really well. Skipped the onions and added more onion powder,instead of vegetable oil I sprayed the pan with pam; I drained all of the grease out of the pan and mixed a little of the beef broth with the flour, got that bubbling and then added rest of the broth. I also skipped the sherry (I didn't have any). It was still a great and easy recipe.

Made this dish on a whim and I am so glad I did. I omitted the sherry, added fresh sage to the meat mixture and doubled the broth. It was fantastic. Served with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes. My husband and 7 year old were very happy.

This was a HUGE hit in my house.  The guys never had anything like this and we're sure what it was but LOVED it.  I followed the recipe, but subed 1 tsp vanilla for the sherry.  I also doubled the flour and broth to make more gravy. YUM!

My husband and kids loved it! I added a few more spices then the recipe called for. I thought the gravy was a bit boring so I tossed in a can of brown gravy a the end to save it.

I would give it a 5 for the idea alone but I changed quite a few things so I honestly don't know what it would have tasted like as written. I added minced fresh onion, garlic, and rosemary to the meat instead of the dried herbs and used regular salt instead of seasoned salt. I also added mushrooms and fresh garlic, rosemary, and thyme to the gravy and doubled the amount of broth, sherry, and flour. I took another reader's advice and dredged the meat in flour before browning alone. I sauteed the mushrooms and onions after taking the browned meat out of the pan. Great idea! I'll be making my adjusted version again I'm sure. My boyfriend will insist! :)

More like a 3 1/2 as written for me. If you just love the taste of meat (like my hubby) you will probably like this as is. It just had a very basic meat taste to me and I like my stuff with more flavor so the second time I made this I added to the patties: 1/4 onion minced, 1 or 2 tablespoons A1 bold and spicy sauce, maybe 1/3 packet mushroom and onion gravy packet and salt and pepper to taste. I always cook a little tiny bit before cooking them all to make sure seasonings are perfect.  I doubled the gravy and added about another 1/3 package of the onion and mushroom gravy packet once my gravy had thickened up and before I put the patties back in.  I also added a bit garlic powder to the gravy. 5 stars and even my husband said it was delicious. Served over Mashed Potatoes.

I had my favorite 9 year old help me prepare these, and they were pretty good :)  I substituted vanilla for the sherry, and followed the recipe exactly.

Excellent! I am not the greatest cook, and I tend to mess up even the simplest recipes. But this one turned out great. I was out of sherry, and as another reviewer suggested, I added a little vanilla. I was worried about it, but it turned out lovely. Even my VERY picky husband enjoyed it. This one is going in my recipe box. Thank you!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE, I have made it several times. I skipped the sherry and beef broth, and doubled the onion. The gravy is delicious and I used milk and flour and tony chachere's gravy powder for the gravy. It's delicious!

We buy ground meat all the time, and were looking for a new way to prepare it. This was the way to go, for sure! It was very easy and very forgiving.  We used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and cooking wine instead of cooking sherry and we served it with yam, biscuits, and asparagus. It took very little time to prepare, and the whole family loved it (especially my boyfriend who was like a fly the entire time I was making it)  We all loved this recipe and have added it to our ground meat rotation!

This was tasty!  The gravy was very forgiving as I was distracted and let it simmer way too long, didn't burn a bit!  I liked the hint of sweetness that the sherry added.  Overall a nice filling comfort food.  I did double the gravy, but since I made mac-n-cheese instead of mashed potatoes (booooo) it wasn't necessary.  Next time that gravy is going over some taters!  Thanks for the great supper!

A nice, simple to make meal.  I followed as directed, only using pineapple juice as a substitue for the sherry, only because I didn't have any sherry and couldn't justify buying a bottle for 2 tablespoons worth.  Make sure you use a large skillet to fit all 8 patties.  I will definitely make this again but I will scale back on the amount of sliced onions, maybe 1/2 - 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup to suit my taste buds.

Good recipe for minimal ingredients and a low cost!  I doubled the onions/gravy and I'm glad I did!  I went easy on the salt in the gravy so people could add more to taste if they wanted.  We ate it with a baked potato and salad.  The only thing I didn't like was that it had a very strong aroma that was in my house all day but I'll still make it again!

I didn't change anything when I made this and it came out nice.  My mother and grandmother loved it. I wasn't as crazy about it as them, but I think its just about personal taste. I will be making it again though. Its a nice comforting meal on a cold night.

Made this with ground turkey, extra onion, and mushrooms.  Left out the beef broth and used the juice from sauteed mushrooms that I saved from other recipes in the freezer and a little extra sherry.  Absolutely incredible.  Will most assuredly be making this again soon.

This was very good. I doubled the gravy part so we would have plenty for mashed potatoes. A keeper for sure.

I didn't have any sherry OR onions, but this recipe turned out wonderfully.  I used french onion soup mix instead, and it came out nicely.  I'm sure with fresh onions, it would be even better.  Very easy recipe!

This was good but not great. Was quite easy though. One of my family loved it, the rest said we could do without it again.

Sooo good! My husband's new favorite dish. He's asked to have it every week now. I left out the sherry, but everything else was perfect. Yummy--and I don't even like ground beef! Thank you!!

i give it two stars because it is easy... but it tastes easy (i thought it was yucky) and only one of my kids would eat it with bribery... the other decided it wasn't worth it.

This was really good, I pretty much followed the recipe exactly but did use white wine instead of sherry & added bell peppers with my onions... it was very easy and everyone loved it.

Second time making this and it was even better than before! Don't know what I did to make it better, but it was! It was hard flipping the patties w/all the onions and the whole pan was full of grease but the end result was ALL worth it!

Average at best. I was in search of some comfort food on this wet & yucky fall day & I chose this dish b/c of the high ratings. The meat was so bland & the gravy was a little salty.

awesome...homestyle Southerm cookin! I've made this twice adn the most important thing you need to do is....use seasoned bread crumbs!!! The first time I made this it was spectacular...the 2nd was not and it was the bread crumbs. we used Italian ...but there are others, just don't use plain. Also...mushrooms are a bonus! Onions and mushrooms just go together very well, esp over hamburger steak. Men love this...well mine did. I loved it and my husband asks me to me it once a week.

Pretty good, listened to other reviewers tho, and doubled the gravy, (I'm glad I did) I also added some fresh garlic.  Would have given it five stars if I didn't have to alter it, even my picky eaters loved it.

It was good, a bit on the salty side...but it could have been because we used a boullion cube & water for beef broth.
Probably will make again, but try with less seasoning salt & with low sodium beef broth.

This had to be the best hamburger steak that I have ever eaten. Even the gravy (which I doubled) was delicious and I usually can't make good gravy.  My guests raved about it too. Hubby wanted to make it again the next night!

This was really good. I made it last night and didn't have enough beef broth so I used vegetable broth and the gravy was amazing! I have REALLY picky kids so that is the only reason this didn't get 5 stars! My husband even said it was "pretty" good and normally he says nothing so for him to comment means it must be good! Thank you!

My husband and I loved this recipe, but the kids did not. That is why it only got 4 stars. I doubled the gravy like everyone else suggested and served it over mashed potatoes. I added mushrooms to the gravy as well per the request of my husband. I will make this again when the kids have dinner plans somewhere else.

I was a bit worried about this, after reading some of the negative reviews, but it turned out well.  It had a nice flavor to it.  I do not think it is anything I would add to our weekly rotation, but it is a nice alternative.

Delicious!  A big hit with everyone in my family!  I added peas and accidentally added WAY too much sherry.  It needed some salt, too.  I served over rice and my husband made a sandwich out of it!  Will definitely make again and again!!  Nice and easy and Cheap!!

My husband thought this was fantastic. I followed the recipe, however, I used olive oil since we prefer it. I did use two cups of beef broth for the gravy, and two tablespoons of flour gave it perfect consistency. I added garlic powder to the gravy, salt and pepper to taste. Mashed potatoes is a must for this dish.

We really enjoyed this recipe. The only thing I would do differently would be to add the onions when the meat is nearly cooked. The gravy was fantastic with the sherry added. Thanks for this recipe.

I was surprised at how tasty this turned out. Not the prettiest meal on the plate, but really good, & the sherry gave it a little sweet flavor which was very nice. I added 1T of butter to the onions before adding the flour and I added about 1C of cooked peas at the end w/the beef, & served  over  rice.

EXCELLENT! I will definately make these again. I used the premade hamburgers from Wal-Mart meat section (fresh not frozen) and then just sprinkled the garlic salt, onion powder, and pepper on them, also drizzled on the worchestershire sauce.  I did double the gravy and it was great, served with mashed potatoes and fried okra. Quick and easy also!

I didn't have any sherry for this recipe, but I didn't feel like I was missing anything not having it in there.  Very yummy!  I also added a whole can of beef broth and used ground turkey instead of beef and it was very good.

Delicious! Everyone loved it. I made only two changed. I used crushed saltine crackers in place of the bread crumbs and I used A1 instead of worcestershire. I will definetly make this again.

This meal was a huge hit with my whole family. I have 4 children who are generally picky eaters and they even loved it. I will definitely make this again.

This was just ok for me.  The gravy definitely needs doubled as others have expressed, and it was a little on the bland side for my family.  We will try the method again though and pump up the spice.

Comfort food!  It tastes alot like country style steak, really easy.  I doubled the gravy and made mashed potatoes instead of rice.  Yummy!

This was very yummy. I definitely agree with the other reviews... make extra gravy. I added some fresh sliced mushrooms with the onions, sauteed it a bit to soften before adding the patties. I did what many others did & served it with mashed potatoes. There was this slightly strange taste I can't quite figure out. I think next time I'm going to try using seasoned bread crumbs for extra flavor. It's comfort food!

This was tasty. not this best meal ever but an easy comfort food. I made onion roasted new potatoes to go with it. I think it would be better over mashed potatoes, will double the gravy next time.

Very good! My husband and I both liked it a lot. I did not have sherry, so I used white wine. I doubled the gravy as others recommended & it was plenty for mashed potatoes too!

Was expecting something better than what we got. Followed recipe exactly. First of all, not near enough of the gravy, would double or even triple. Served over noodles and didn't have enough gravy. Noodles were very dry because of that. Secondly, flavor was very bland, not sure what to add, but for all of the ingredients and the work was quite dissappointed in this recipe.

This was very good, but not amazing.  I doubled the gravy and onions (as recommended by the other reviews) and added some mushrooms.  I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes to the meat since my fiance loves them.  I thought the dish turned out wonderful, and he loved it.  It was an interesting change for hamburger meat.  The four stars is because I thought it was just very good, not spectacular.

Fantastic, hearty, and delicious!  Came together very quickly for a busy weekday meal.  I doubled the gravy and used vanilla in place of the sherry...tasty.  Will make this regularly.

I have never made hamburger steak this good and I have been cooking for twenty years!!! I didn't quite get the hang of the gravy so it went down the disposal, but the patties were AWESOME. I will hang on to this and cook it again!

I have made this recipe about 6 or 7 times now....I love it. I do add more flour and more beef broth for extra gravy. Other than that it doesn't need any changes. Always a hit!!!

Very good and simple to make! Very tender!I doubled the gravy as suggested by others and also added a can of mushrooms and added a lil extra of the seasonings. I used kaiser rolls and made sandwhiches with mashed potatoes on the side to have with the additional gravy.

Another one of those recipes that you seem to have all the ingredients for lying around the house.  Very easy and tasty, I doubled the gravy like most people did, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.

Over all this was a good recipe. I doubled the gravy as others suggested. I also cooked the onions after I was finished cooking the hamburger patties. One person mentioned in their review that they subbed red wine for sherry. That didn't go over very well with my family. The gravy had a strong taste of wine to it. I will make this again and just omit the sherry all together.

This is a very good recipe.  It's always a hit with my husband and boys.  Also, it is delicious as leftovers.  Satisfying comfort food, especially when served with mashed potatoes that you can smother w/ the gravy.  Simple to make, easy to modify with ingredients and spices you have on hand.  Although I never add the worsteschire (husband doesn't like) or the sherry (never have it on hand), I don't think the flavor is compromised at all by the omission of those 2 ingredients.  Recommend this recipe for a hearty, belly warming dinner.

This was really delicious. Quick, easy, and open to substitutions based on what I had in the house (ie. garlic instead of garlic powder, flavoured bread crumbs, onion salt - use less salt, vanilla instead of sherry, beef broth liquid added to water , more beef - 1.27 lbs - then called for, cooked half of the prepared balls 3/6 for the amount of gravy asked for...perfect). Yummy and tender and moist.  So easy!

I used very lean ground beef and doubled the gravy.  It was yummy, cheap, and reasonably easy to prepare.  I'm saving this one.

This was okay, but I also didn't have beef broth, so I used French Onion soup instead.  Great on Mashed potatoes!

I actually really liked these.  The hamburger steaks were delicious but the gravy was a little salty.

This was so good. I doubled the onion and gravy because I love onions. I served this with mashed potatoes and steamed green beans and dinner rolls.

I followed this recipe exactly according to directions and after reading the great reviews it had gotten was really disappointed in the results.  My husband and I found it just OK nothing special about it. Won't be making again.

This was tasty.  I used cooking sake instead of cooking sherry.  I didn't read enough reviews before making it, and I wish I had known to double the gravy.  Actually I had the same problem as a previous reviewer, who wrote that the gravy all disappeared during the 15 minutes of simmering at the end.  More oil leached from the patties, so I ended up with an oil slick with onions and some patches of gravy.  Maybe cooking on a gas stove made a difference?  Anyway next time I'll definitely double the gravy, and reduce the simmer at the end to maybe 5 minutes.

This is a very good recipe - great comfort food! I followed the recipe as printed, with two exceptions; I left out the sherry (didn't have any), and I substituted finely ground cracker crumbs for the bread crumbs. Both the meat and the gravy were, in my opinion anyway, perfectly seasoned. In fact, it is one of the few dishes I didn't add salt and pepper to once it reached the table! I rated it four stars instead of five because although quite good, I don't consider it outstanding, which is my criteria for a 5 star dish. But I will definitely make this again; thanks for the recipe!

Yummy! Quick, inexpensive, and easy. I used one whole onion sliced and added a jar of mushrooms. I would also double the gravy so there will be plenty for over rice, mashed potaoes, or egg noodles.

A great recipe.  We've eaten a variation of this for years and we like onions so I always use 2 large and also double the gravy.  Is great on rice of mashed potatoes. Thanks Anne.

I am a big comfort food fan and this hit the spot.  Everyone cleaned their plates.  I served it with rice and steamed green beans.    Even my 2 year old ate rice with the gravy.

This wasn't such a hit at our house.  I served this with egg noodles and biscuits.  Not to be harsh, but to me this dish is like a glorified Hamburger Helper.  Of course, it tasted better because it was homemade.  Plus I liked the flavor and ingredients in the ground beef opposed to just plain ground beef in HH.  I did although drain most of the fat because there's just too much in ground beef not to.  Please don't let my experience scare you off though.  My family is just spoiled because I cook from scratch almost every night.  Plus, a lot of people seem to like this recipe a lot.

Initially, I thought this dish would taste boring. Not only was it relatively simple to prepare, but the seasoning brought out the meat's flavor.
I found the gravy so good that I kept going back for more. I served it with roasted potatoes and green peas. Thanks Anne, this will definitely be served again!

When I was making this, I thought that I should only make 2 patties, as it was only for the two of us.  Instead, I made 4, then realised it called for 8.  8 patties out of 1# of burger is not a burger STREAK, it's a MickyD 15cent burger.  Even with only 4, the meat was a little dry.  The onions and gravy were favorful, otherwise it would have been 2 stars.
I might make this again, but if I do, I will only make 2 STEAKS.

This recipe was excellent! My roommate and I went back for seconds. I've never made this kind of meal and it is a keeper! Took other's advice and doubled the gravy and onions. I was concerned about the mess and leftover grease in the gravy, so I took the extra time and grilled my patties on my G. Foreman grill. Will make this meal on a monthly basis. Great on the budget!

The meat turned out fine. However, big mistake in wording where it says to return patties to the gravy, cover, and simmer for another 15 minutes. We did this and the result was no gravy - wasting all the work to creat it in the first place. We determined that continual stirring is needed to maintain gravy - something which wasn'r made clear. Therefore, we rate this recipe with 2 stars as written.

The only thing that could improve this recipe would be to add some sliced Portabellas, which I will definitely do next time I make it. My non-meat eating 11 year old asked for thirds! EXCELLENT!!

Good recipe!  I used 1.5 lb ground beef and just added a tiny bit of milk.  Used water and beef boulion instead of beef broth.  There wasn't enough gravy, so I added a can of chicken gravy (didn't have any beef).  Added mushrooms and ate it with rice.   =)

This is very tasty. I tweaked it a bit because I like my onions a little crunchy - I cooked the hamburger first, then add the onion to the oil in the pan, followed by the flour. Did not change anything else. Worth 5 stars.

Made this last night. A Keeper!!  Would suggest increasing the gravy, it was wonderful.  Next time I will make double and freeze half (we are only 2 people) in boilable freezer bags, so when I am pressed for time, pull out and enjoy!! Add mushrooms if you like, but we loved it just the way the receipe reads.

This was an excellent use of items I had on hand!  I didn't have any beef broth so I used chicken and a little bit of brown gravy.  Nice easy recipe.

My mom used to make a very similar dish, so this is the perfect comfort food. The only thing I did differently was to use more onions and double the gravy. Yum!

Good comfort food!  Took another reviewer's suggestion and used milk instead of beef broth in the gravy.  Very good, but would likely be just as good with the broth.  If you want enough gravy for potatos, etc., definitely double it.  It really thickens up.

This recipe was delightful.  It was really delicious.  The gravy was the best part!  I would suggest if you are making this meal for more than two people...make more gravy!  If their are only two of you, you should have enough gravy.  My fiance and I were the only two eating this meal... and we both thought it was absolutely delish!  We also tried Ultimante Twiced Baked Potatoes from this site... and everyone should try those as well!!!  They were soooo yummy!!!

I just fried the burgers til almost done then added 2 cans of brown gravy along with the sauteed onions.  No loss of flavor.  Didnt need the sherry.  Mushrooms are always a plus.  Awesome, fast meal with mashed potatos and corn.

I haven't made hamburger steaks for the longest time and was glad to see this as a reminder for something different to prepare.  I never used sherry with ground chuck but it certainly worked!  Be sure to double the sauce.  GOOD.

Reminds me of mom.  She used to make this for us and we loved it.  She always served it with french fries smothered in the gravy.  And that's how I served it last night.  Crispy oven fries with a rich gravy...yummmm.  Only 4 stars because mom's is still better.

Absolutely loved this version of Hamburg Steak. I think the key is the gravy - I doubled the amount - the flavor was GREAT! Served up with white rice is a unique change from the standard fries or mash. Highly recommended! Tried it again 3 yrs later - still a 5*. The sherry adds that special touch. best Hamburg steak I've ever had!

Very good.  Did double the gravy using onion soup.  Even my daughter who is avery picky eater enjoyed this and had seconds. Served with rice.  Will definitely make again and maybe add a little more spice.

This was pretty good, however I did double the gravy as others suggested & doubled the spices.  Although it was good, it still seemed to be missing something.  I will probably make it again but make some more adjustments.

I made this 2 days ago and it was pretty good.  I used onion soup and beef broth as my liquid and one big onion, and didn't find to salty.  I tripled the recipe, as we like leftovers & made 14 big sized patties.  The sherry did add more flavour.  The onion were the best part though.  Will be making again, but probably not so much as it was a little more time consuming.

This recipe is like home cooking.  Have always loved hamburger steak with onions and gravy. I like my onions a little more firm so there's a good bite of onion with my burger.  You brought a smile to my face, Anne.  Thank you.

I really liked this recipe, and so did my husband. My kids, however didn't care for it, I don't know why. It reminded me of a salisbury steak, but with onions. I'll probably make it again, but next time I'll give the kids theirs with no onion. I served mine with Brocolli and cheese sauce.

Yummy!  I double the gravy, though, so I have enough for a side of mashed potatoes.  One of my husband's favorite meals!

This was a great recipe. I really enjoyed it. I added more beef broth and flour to make more gravy. Meat had a great flavor to it. I also let it simmer in the gravy. Although it was good with the cherry wine, I will try without the wine but with mushrooms next time to see how it taste. I cooked the Day Before Mashed Potatoes recipe on this site with it and it was fantastic.

The "steaks" had a good flavor after simmering in the gravy (which I doubled)but not sure about the sherry.

Tasted pretty good. It was nice to have something new to the menu.  I left out the sherry, but I did everything else the same.  I will make again.

This was really good and so easy!  I did double the gravy and added some worchestire sauce to give it more flavor.  I also doubled the onion and garlic powder and left out the sherry.  Very tasty!

My family really liked this recipe...I doubled the gravy like others suggested. Next time I'll lower the amount of breadcrumbs or leave them out entirely....but that's just 'cause I'm picky, nobody else minded them.  I served the meal along with the sauteed green beans recipe put on this site by Lizard,  will definately make both again.

Besides adding garlic, I followed the recipe exactly.  The "sauce" came out runny, and the meat was greasy.

This recipe is the definition of Comfort Food. The hamburger steak was tender and full of flavor. Have made this several times with garlic mashed potatoes...buttered noodles and once with rice. It doesn't get any better.

Wow - I was really expecting this to be great!  The hamburger patties were good.  I made as described but added a bit of cumin for some extra flavor.  The gravy was SO bland.  I doubled it and added extra sherry because I love to cook with it, but it just had no flavor.  Needs a lot more of something.  Will not make again.

This was a big hit at our house!  I more than doubled the gravy and because I didn't have any beef broth on hand, I used a combination of water, onion soup mix and chicken broth -- the sherry really makes this gravy.  I also cooked the hamburgers first, alone, and then added the onions to the pan once the burgers were done and cooked them for about 15 minutes before starting the gravy.  A very easy week-night recipe!

This was a really a delicious recipe! 
I made a few modifications due to lack of ingredients. :)
I use crackers instead of bread crumbs, and a beef bullion cube in a cup of water instead of regular beef broth, and I didn't have cooking sherry or seasoning salt ( I just used regular salt). I went ahead and doubled the gravy and it really was wonderful! 
I liked the fact that even with all my modifications, it still tasted good. 
Even my picky 2 1/2 year old liked it!!! :D

This recipe is always a hit at our house and I love it because I can suppliment ingredients considering what I have in the house.  I didn't have Worcestershire sause tonight and used A 1 sause instead and it was just as good.  I also substitute cooking sherry for water.  A great new way to use ground beef.

I made this and really liked it, instead of the beef broth and sherry I used 1 1/2 cups of water instead and seasoned to taste. I wanted to make a little more gravy, 1 cup just didn't cut it.  The Hamburger steak was juicy and moist and had a really good flavor, not to salty.  My 8 yr old son loved this even though it had onions in it.  Will definitely put this in the rotation.

We really liked this recipe. I used ground sirloin, only an egg white and half a tablespoon of olive oil to fry them to cut back on fat. I also didn't have any onion powder but I doubled the onion so no big deal. I will make this again it's easy and a great way to make hamburger!

I think this was really good. I had a little more than a pound of 85% lean ground beef, so I added an extra egg to the mixture to make it moister. I followed the recipe and used a little more of each spice, a large onion & even a little more sherry & everyone enjoyed it! I will definately make it again.

I'll make this again. I served it with mashed potatoes, boiled carrots and boiled parsnip. I am not sure that it needs the sherry given the sweetness of the onion.

We didn't care for this.  It was very much like Salisbury steak, which I don't care for either.  I would rather just made the meat into burgers.

After I read the reviews I thought this sounded like a great way to use ground beef in a different way.  We liked it okay.  My girls wouldn't eat it after just one taste.  My husband ate it because he was really hungry.  Same for me....  I thought it tasted like meat loaf made into balls.  The gravy was also just ok.

Just to echo what everyone else said, I impressed myself with this meal. Mostly because I didn't think I could make the gravy, but it was great. Served over rice and steamed vegetables.

This is a keeper!  Sherry gave it the most punch.  Had to add more beef broth and would have liked a little more gravy as I'm left with hamburgers, rice and not much gravy for leftovers.
