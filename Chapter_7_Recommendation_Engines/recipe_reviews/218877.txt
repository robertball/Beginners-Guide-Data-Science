Not shabby at all. Just started making sushi & added this to my short-grain rice while cooking and it turned out nicely.

Great recipe! I halved it because I am not having a big sushi party anytime soon :) Love the flavor -- it will work great for chirashi sushi, which is basically a bowl of sushi rice with all kinds of sushi and ingredients scattered over, like a deconstructed sushi roll :) To add this to the rice...cook short grain rice (best in a rice cooker), and spread it out in a large flat bowl or plate. Pour the vinegar over the rice while making "cutting" motions through the rice. After it's all poured over, fan as you carefully fold the rice over itself to mix the vinegar throughout.

Just perfect.  A fisherman friend brought us two huge tuna steaks today, so naturally had to make sushi!  I was out of sushi vinegar, so did a quick Google check and came upon this recipe.  I only made a quarter of the recipeâ€¦I'd never use up as much as this makes!  thought it had a great balance of sweetness and acidity.  I put it in a squirt bottle and dispense a little at a time into the rice while fluffing it around in a big bowl to cool it off.  I just keep adding a little more till it starts holding together really well.  I used Mahatma's jasmine rice and it turned out just as good as our favorite sushi restaurant!
