I'm giving this 4 stars because the original recipe does need a little help. First of all, the orange juice and zest contain nowhere near enough flavor to make this cheesecake taste orange-y at all. I suggest using a teaspoon or two of orange extract as well. I added all the orange flavors to the white batter only. I reserved the two cups for the chocolate before I added them, so the chocolate and orange would contrast nicely. The crust is great. Be sure you let your cream cheese and eggs sit out until they are at room temp, or you'll over beat the batter trying to get the lumps out. Over beating leads to all kinds of cheesecake problems! Anyway, lined my springform pan with foil and baked my cheesecake in a water bath. I had no structural or textural problems except for a few bubbles from slightly over beating. After it was done (60 min), I turned off the oven and let it cool for an hour inside. Then I took it out and let it cool completely on a wire rack. I chilled the cake overnight. I removed the hoop and bottom of the pan (tricky), and scored the top of the cake into 12 even portions. Garnished it with whipped cream from a pastry bag with a large star tip, chocolate filigree, and orange twists. I also served it with the Marmalade Drizzle from the Orange Pudding Cakes with Marmalade Drizzle recipe from this site as a sauce. It was a perfect addition to this cheesecake.

This is a very tasty, easy recipe.  I made it with Grand Marnier instead of the orange juice and the cake had a lovely light flavor.  It's more of a creamy cheesecake, and it's very dense.  My only complaint is that the graham cracker crust was too crumbly.  When I was marbling my two batters the crust was pulled away from the pan and into the cake. When it was done baking and chilling the crust stayed mostly together, but I think it was just fused to the cake.  Next time I think I'll make a chocolate cookie crust and use a darker chocolate in the cake (the semi-sweet didn't prove to be quite chocolatey enough).  Thanks very much for sharing this recipe.

Oh my goodness was this good the only change I made was to use 4 teaspoons orange concentrate instead of 2 tablespoons of orange juice, because I really like the taste of orange and chocolate.  I also melted the chocolate in the microwave. Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe

This is my goto recipe for cheesecake. It is dense and creamy. Also very versatile; I've substituted the chocolate and orange with both blueberry and strawberry puree. It makes a very pretty dessert garnished with the fresh fruit and always satisfies. Also can be frozen and enjoyed later. I always put the springform pan on top of a muffin pan filled with water when baking and it helps prevent cracks. Thanks for sharing. This dessert always wins rave reviews from friends and family members.

Excellent.  I added 2T orange juice plus an additional 1 teaspoon of orange extract.  This was perfect for me.  Next time, I will reduce the amount of sugar in the crust.

I made this wonderful recipe for my orange adoring husband for his birthday this past weekend. He along with our guest raved over this chessecake. I followed the advice of the other posts, using 2TBSP of orange juice and 1 teaspn of Orange Extract. The cake had a lovely orange flavor (not at all overpowering) with a nice accent of chocolate. I would highly recommend trying this one!

This cheesecake was wonderful! Dense and creamy and amazing. Like other reviewers, I decided to up the orange flavor. I didn't have orange extract or orange juice concentrate, so I measured out about 1/3c. orange juice and cooked it down until reduced by half.  I also used the orange zest of about one whole medium orange (~2-3 teaspoons).  Baked the cheesecake in a hot water bath for exactly one hour then turned the oven off and let it cool inside for another hour. Cooled on a wire rack for a good while (had to fend of some tempted family members at this point, haha) and then chilled overnight.  I served this on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and everyone LOVED it!!

I should have read the reviews because the orange juice & zest alone wasn't orangey enough - but still, a great cheesecake recipe.  Everyone loved it!  :)  I'll be making it again, with a little more orange flavor.

This was very good. I liked the texture of the cheesecake, it was creamy and dense and not crumbly, melded well in the mouth. I did wish it had more orange flavor. I had even added extra zest and it was still too mild. The chocolate overpowered the orange. Next time I would reduce the amount of chocolate batter, but use a darker chocolate. Would also maybe add the orange extract as well. Was happy with the crust.

A great base-recipe!  I made this for my husband's birthday and used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and low-fat cream cheese for the filling.  As others mentioned, the orange-flavor wasn't quite strong enough for our tastes, so in addition to the 2 tbs. or orange juice, I added 2 tsp. of orange extract.  I also upped the orange zest from 1/2 tsp. to grated peel from a whole medium orange.  The only other change I made was to replace 1/4 cup of the sugar in the filling with stevia.  The finishined product tasted *exactly* like a Terry's Chocolate Orange, which was what I was hoping for.  Thank you so much for the great recipe!  I have a feeling this cake is going to become a birthday tradition in our house.

It was very good.  It would have lacked orange flavor had I not read reviews and added 1 T of orange zest and 2 t of orange extract.  I added 1 t to both the white and chocolate batter.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I will be only adding it to the white batter so I can have a pure chocolate taste in the swirl.

This was pretty good. I did think it needed some extra orange flavor so I used OJ concentrate instead of juice. Also put in 1 tsp orange extract and extra zest.

LOVED by all at my Family Christmas Party. Garnished with Blueberries to contrast with the orange flavour. Would do a higher ratio of chocolate to cheesecake mixture, but I don't think I followed the recipe to a T the first time on that front.  Needs more orange flavour! Will definitely make again!!

This recipe was great and so easy.  I did make a few changes and found they worked out for me.  Firstly I cut the sugar by half and it was certainly sweet enough. I made the crust using 1 and 1/4 cups each of digestive cookie and chocolate cookie crumbs.  Also I increased the orange juice (I juiced fresh oranges) to 5 tbls which gave it a nice orange flavour.  As mentioned by another reviewer I reserved the 2 cups of batter for the chocolate before adding the orange juice and zest which made the orange batter much more orange flavoured.  I melted the chocolate in the microwave heating and then stirring it a few seconds at a time until it was completely melted.  I baked it with the pan sitting on a muffin tin filled with water as was suggested by someone else to avoid cracking.  I decorated it with fresh strawberries and a dollop of cool whip at the end of each slice.  It was perfect for my husband's birthday cake!  I will definitely make it again.

This cheesecake recipe is awesome.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it absolutely needs more orange flavour to contrast with the chocolate.  Other than that it's a great recipe.  I followed what other said by mixing less chocolate mixture but next time I will follow the directions as written as the chocolate becomes too heavy to swirl into the white mixture if you mix less.   No cracking on the top of the cheesecake and not at all dry.

I brought this to a work related potluck, and WOW!  Did people love it!  After reading other reviews, I used orange extract instead of juice, probably between 1 and 2 tablespoons.  I also doubled up on the orange zest.  I did a mix of semi-sweet chocolate and milk chocolate chips, about 3/4 cup total, maybe more.    I need to keep a gluten free kitchen at home so I made a crust with gluten free chocolate chip cookies instead of graham crackers.  2 cups cookie crumbs 5 tablespoons butter and 3 tbsp of sugar.  No one could tell is was gluten free.  I received so many compliments on it.  It is truly decadent and delicious!!

Loved this cheesecake! It tasted like a those chocolate oranges that you "whack and unwrap". So good! I used fresh orange juice from the orange that I zested and it turned out perfect!

This is a really unique cheesecake. It tastes like a Terry's chocolate orange! I did add the orange extract as another user suggested, and added a bit more zest as well. I tried my hardest to avoid getting air whipped into the batter, and even tried to shake the bubbles out before it went into the oven and I still ended up with a huge crack running right down the middle. I used sweetened whipped cream with about 1/2 tsp orange extract to cover the top. Everyone liked it, but it was a bit to rich and unusual to keep them coming back for more.

I was skeptical on the orange chocolate combo because I usually prefer more berry flavors, but this turned out excellent!We used 2 table spoons of fresh squeezed orange juice and added coco to the crust. We also cooked the cheesecake in the waterbath like suggested and it came out smooth and creamy without cracks. We topped with the chocolate shavings and candied oranges. If I make it again, the only thing I would change is that I would take only separate 1 cup or 1 1/2 cups to mix with the chocolate because there seemed to be a lot more of the chocolate than the plain. And that way the chocolate swirls would be even more chocolaty!

AMAZING! I have made it twice now and it's superb each time. I put in a little more orange than called for - about 2 tablespoons orange juice concentrate, and 1 tsp orange extract. YUM!!

I enjoyed this cheesecake. Chocolate and orange taste is a very good combination. I didnt have orange juice so I increased amount of orange candied zest and added orange extract. I added that only to the white mixture. I made crust from chocolate sandwich cookies, it was great. The problem I had was leaking some liquid out of spring form, and burning in the oven. So I would recommend to wrap it in foil and bake it in water bath. So I did that after 30 min when I found out it was leaking. I should have follow Tough Cookie's advise. :) Next time...

I made this dessert for a post-Christmas dinner for the in-laws. This was an extreme hit for my family and me! I did use contreau instead of the orange juice and up-ed the orange zest to a full teaspoon. This added a VERY nice orange flavor without it being too overpowering for us. I also didn't crush the graham crackers too fine. I did leave some "bits-n-pieces" and it seemed to help with the texture (I'm not a huge fan of crusts period). I also liked the flavor of the crust; light and not cinnamon-y like some cheesecake crusts. I did have trouble using a thin knife to separate the cake from the pan edges once it came out of the oven. I don't think you'll have to do this step; you may end up "de-facing" it like I did. It seemed like once it cooled, it pulled away the edges quite nicely anyway. It did crack but I don't mind cracked cheesecake. The crack gives it more character ;o) All in all a FANTABULOUS recipe!

This was really yummy! I made some changes based on the reviews: 2 tablespoons orange juice, 2 teaspoons orange extract, and the zest of one orange. Also, I used dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet- it gave it a more european flavor. Overall, a really good cake!

Absolutely delicious, with a few tiny alterations. I used chocolate cookie crumbs instead of graham crackers, an replaced the orange juice with 4 tsp. orange extract. It made a solid, weighty cheesecake with a very thick texture and a pleasant flavor.

I made this for my father, who loves orange and chocolate together, but isn't a big fan of cheesecake. Unfortunately this wasn't good enough to sway his opinion. I added orange extract to the vanilla cheesecake part which kept the chocolate swirls that much more chocalty. I think I'd rather have an all chocolate cheesecake next time.

Very easy,  I added 2 tsp orange extract.  I cut the amount of chocolate batter in half.  I liked the ratio in my cheesecake, but there was a slight problem.  I kept semi choclate amount teh same so it was a very thick consistency.  It did NOT mix well with the thinner white batter.  It was very hard to marble.  Overall a great cheesecake.  I didn't like the crust though.  It was lacking something for me...

I had never baked a cheesecake before but this is simple enough for me. Orange and chocolate are just the BEST combinations. Sometimes I add fruit (like fresh blueberries) in the bottom and that adds more sour taste.
This is GREAT!

A good cheesecake, but not a very strong orange flavor.  I used 2+ T. of OJ concentrate rather than just the juice, and I could still barely taste the orange.  Nice texture and flavor, though (just not too orange-y).  Maybe you could try orange extract?

This is now my favorite go-to recipe at the holidays!  I zest an entire orange, and use frozen concentrate orange juice to make it VERY orangy for a good contrast with the chocolate.

This was beautiful to look at and tasted very good. My only slight criticism is there wasn't much orange taste, I used orange liqueur. So I think I would up the amount next time. Everybody loved it though. Thanks

Delicious!  I made this for my family for Thanksgiving and it turned out nicely.  I added 1 tsp. orange extract as another reviewer suggested and the orange taste was subtle, but definitely there.  Everyone loved it, even the kids.

This is a WONDERFUL tasting and looking cheesecake!!! I love the idea of orange/chocolate and the orange doesn't overpower the cake as I thought it would have. It's a wonderful combo! Thank you, I'll be making this one again.

I love the flavor of this cheesecake. The orange flavoring is just different enough to make you want came back for another taste.

Very good.  I would add a little more orange flavoring, but otherwise it was excellent.  Easy to make.  Very good, rich chocolate flavor.  Would definitely make again.

This is terrific! I love the combo of orange and chocolate. Following other recommendations, I did use OJ concentrate for more orange flavor. Will definitely make this again. I'm thinking that this could also be  terrific with a chocolate crumb crust.

Of all the recipes I have made from this site, this one has the most beautiful pictures of the finished product.  (I used them for inspiration!). Everyone thought this cake was delicious.  I only did two things differently.  1.  I used Oreos for the crust.  2.  I freshly squeezed my  oranges, then boiled the juice until it was reduced by roughly half.  I used the concentrated orange juice both in the cake and in the orange frosting I made.  My cake tasted very orangy.
