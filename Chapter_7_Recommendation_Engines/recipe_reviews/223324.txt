Very good, easy and quick. We make our own taco seasoning and it is just perfect with the tilapia. Was surprised by how tasty the simple slaw mix is on the taco! We have added this recipe to our dinner rotation and will serve it when the in-laws visit.

I usedthis recipe as a base.  Substituted rockfish for tilapia and cooked on the grill.

Really good recipe.  I changed it by using lemon instead of lime.  I know a Mexican faux-pas but I don't really care for lime. I substitute plain non-fat yogurt for the mayonaise.

Wow, that was good. I didn't substitute anything, but did add some chopped jalape√±o to the slaw. I also used homemade taco seasoning instead of store bought. I would definitely make this again.

This was good, simple to make and quick.  Next time, I might use a little less mayo, but probably all I would change.  Nice to have a stress free recipe.

It was okay. I doubled everything for a family of 4, except the taco packet. We each were able to have 3 tacos and my teenage son had 5. I used 1 taco seasoning packet and still had some left in the envelope. Next time I will add either green onion or red onion. It is missing a little something, but the family liked it.

This recipe is so easy and very good! The only thing I did differently was I used Bass fish as my husband had caught several of them. We will definitely be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe as written with the exception of using homemade taco seasoning instead of the store bought. The recipe was easy to make and very tasty. I will definitely make these again.

I  marinated the fish overnight. It was really  good. Very simple and easy.  I also used sway fish because that is what I had in the fridge. I will definitely   do it again.

I liked it. Think it needs more taco seasoning. It's worth a try.

It was simple to make, quick and delicious!  They turned out better than any restaurant fish tacos I had tried.  I used non-dairy cheese due to lactose intolerance but didn't change anything else. Simpler to make and quicker than you would think. Both my husband and my father loved them so I was glad I doubled the recipe.
