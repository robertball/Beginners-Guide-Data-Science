I made this for Easter dinner this year and it was yummie. I used regular carrots and just cut them to about the size of mini carrots. They worked just as well. Great new way to prepair carrots. Definately will use again in the future.

This was pretty good - I think there was a little too much butter tho.

Well, I'm never fixing plain carrots again, I'll tell you that much. Just finished dinner and paired these with Tangy Grilled Pork Tenderloin from this site, and oh my goodness, what a meal. Served with oven roasted potatoes and onions, and it was honestly one of the best meals we've ever had at home or out. I followed this exactly as written, and used a bag of really teeny baby carrots (you know--now our grocery has baby carrots, and then REALLY tiny baby carrots). Didn't change a darn thing from the recipe and they were perfectly delicious. Sprinkled just a tad bit of thyme over them as a little garnish, and they were simply awesome. THANKS for a great recipe.

I made these to go with my dad's birthday dinner.  Everyone liked them. I used whole grain Dijon mustard. This gave a little more texture to the carrots.

Jack, Jen, and I had this and really liked it. The first time, I used regular carrots and sliced into coins. The second time, I used baby carrots and sliced them in half. Also on the second prep, it was just Jack and I, so I halved the recipe and it came out great.

This was awesome!  I used regular carrots and added broccoli and steamed instead of boiled.  I only had honey dijon mustard so I cut the brown sugar in half.   I doubled the glaze because I thought I would need it.  I had more than enough and my pork chops tasted great dipped in it.  Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a different way to fix carrots, and this fit the bill. I didn't have ground ginger, so I used fresh grated instead. That was the only  change.

i followed the recipe as written. We found it to be a little bland. We couldn't taste any ginger or dijon. If I make this again, I will definitely add more of these ingredients.

I'm a fan of mustard, but I found the mustard/carrot combo odd.

This recipe was very easy to make. I minced whole ginger and added some kale, but it still had good flavor. Sweet, but not too sweet. I'll definitely be making this dish again.

Good without being too sweet. Went well with the Basa Fillets I cooked.
