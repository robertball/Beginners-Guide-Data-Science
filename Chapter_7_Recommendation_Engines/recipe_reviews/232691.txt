The only thing I did not have was a jelly roll pan. I used an 11" by 7" glass pan. It worked perfectly. My kids LOVE this recipe. I had a similar one and lost it. This is now stored in my Allrecipes box. Thanks for sharing. ??

VERY good! Simple to make. I LOVE cheesecake in any form, so I really enjoyed these, as did the rest of the family. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Normally I'm a good baker, so I'm not sure what I did wrong on this. The cream cheese mixture flowed above and below the cookies so it didn't look like a "sandwich" like the picture. They were also really gooey. But people ate them right up so the flavor was good.

These are  insane!!!  So amazingly delish. I bought 2 packs the cookies that were already cut- the kind in a flat pack.  I placed one pack in the bottom of an 11X7 glass pan. I only used one brick of cheese because I thought mine would be smaller.  I'll use 2 next time.  I flattened out the cookies for the top and tried to be perfect, but I wasn't. The brownies came out great. Had to bake 10 more minutes because of the thicker brownie.
