These are lumpia's are very good, but in my family we call them Shanghai lumpia.  Regular lumpia to me are a little easier to make.  In my family we used ground beef and cook it before rolling it.  While the beef is cooking add your seasonings depending on what you like, we add garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  When the meat is cooked add frozen mixed vegetables (or fresh veggies what ever you prefer)and whatever else you'd like.  Just cook long enough to let the water and oil on the bottom cook away.  We add teriyaki sauce for more flavor and then let cool.  If you try to roll right away the wrappers will break.  Once you've rolled the lumpia you can either freeze them for another day or cook 'em in oil until golden brown.  Remember the meat inside is already cooked so all you have to do is brown them.  Also with the wrapper, a lot of people have said they've had a hard time with wrappers breaking, my suggestion is to use the square lumpia wrappers because they tend to be a little thicker than the round once.  You also don't have to wait until the wrapper is completely defrosted, as long as you can work with it you can start rolling right away.  I also use a beaten egg to try to keep the seam closed

My Filipina co-worker and her mother in law taught me how to make this, and it has become a party favorite.  The easiness level depends on your deftness with the wrappers, but don't let it sway you away from trying this.  They omit the beef and green pepper, and add celery and water chestnuts for crunchiness.  To help the filling stick together, they add oyster sauce, which really gives it a great flavor.  It is served with a spicy sweet and sour sauce that I am trying to get the recipe for, but your favorite from the store will due.  I have never heard of or seen the banana ketchup, but I will be asking!

Very good, but not the way I remember them.  I  could have done without the carrots, maybe less bell pepper too.  May I suggest frying them in a shallow layer of oil instead of fully immersing them, to keep the inside ingredients from getting overly oily.  

I found banana ketchup labeled "banana sauce" in a Philipino grocery store.  For those who have not tasted it, it's basically a sweet & sour & hot (or mild) mix of banana and cayenne pepper.  It looks just like ketchup but it has no actual ketchup in it.  It tastes better than you would think on lumpias.  My son and I liked it so much we tried it on everything else we could think of, just to taste.

In my family, we use chopped green onions instead of regular onion.  It also helps to mix the meat with an egg or two (1 egg per pound of meat), and then seal all the edges with egg as you fold it.  We use the round lumpia wrappers, cut them in half, spoon a heaping teaspoon of meat mixture on top near the cut edge, and thin it out in a line about the length of your index finger.  Then you you wet the cut edge with egg and fold it over the meat mixture.  Wet the two sides with egg and alternately fold them over the meat mixture.  Then wet the remaining edge with egg and roll towards it, sealing it smooth with your finger.  Trust me, you now have a heavy-duty eggroll!

This recipe was pretty good; however, I added some basic spices, such as salt, pepper, and garlic powder. The key is to keep the lumpia thin, about as big around as your finger. I also added a few more vegetables, such as green onions and water chestnuts.

I cooked my beef and pork before I added the veggies. I also added about 1 tbl. of soy and one egg to the meat and veggie mix. The square wrappers work the best. Make sure to seal them well with water.

Heavenly!!!!  These were the best I've ever tasted.  I used egg roll wrappers as I had a hard time finding lumpia wrappers.  Thank you for the recipe.

If you can't find lumpia wrappers, you can substitute with spring roll wrappers.  They work well.  Also, banana ketchup can be found at most asian markets.  I also make lumpia with ground pork and chopped salad shrimp.

Last night we followed this recipe to the T, what we ended up with was bland and burnt food that was not cooked in the middle and we had to microwave to get it cooked. Reason why was because 2 tbsp of filling is WAY too much and it also needs some seasonings added. 
Today with the leftover meat I added freshly ground pepper and Worcestershire sauce to taste and browned the meat and vegetables. Then I only put 1 tbsp filling into the wrapper and used less oil to cook them in, they came out the right size and cooked through and much better tasting.

Jen, you forgot the important parts of this recipe such as soy sauce, salt & pepper, garlic powder or granulated, and egg yolks (u need the egg whites to seal the lumpias .  It's actually good if you chop the leaves of the celery finely and put into the mix also.  But before you start wrapping, cook a teaspoon of the mix in a pan to make sure the seasonings are right.

I haven't tried the recipe yet, but I will.  It sounds very similar to the one my friend makes for me.  We do however, have banana katsup at the Asian supermarket here.  Lumpia is best with banana katsup(in my humble opinion).  I would suggest asking for it at your local Asian supermarket.

i have grown up eating lumpia my whole life. i grew up in California and had a lot of Fillipino influences around me. we have a variety of sauces we use in my family. plum sauce is what i grew up with and still crave it every once and a while to this day. we also get a sweet chili sauce. you can find this in asian markets. its bright orange with little red flakes in the sauce. thats my familys favorite. my mom makes a sauce that is MY favorite with 1 cup white vinegar (or you can use rice vinegar for a more mild taste) 1 tablespoon minced garlic and black pepper. sounds odd but its just amazing! my boyfriend likes sweet and sour sauce on his (he prefers the ones that are more red than orange). i hope that helps with your dipping needs!!

I like to use all pork and sometimes add chopped cooked shrimp at the end. I also like to season the mixture with salt, pepper, garlic powder and a bit of soy sauce. Shredded cabbage is good in this as well as chopped scallions. To dip, I like to make a sauce of equal parts brown sugar and water boiled down with a bit of cornstarch to thicken and then seasoned with garlic powder and red pepper flakes.

We didn't find this that time consuming, with two people rolling. No need to cook the meat ahead of time. We used a sweet chili sauce for dipping and will definitely make these again! Wonderful!

I love these and they are my boyfriends favorite food! His mother taught me how to make them and her recipe is similar except she leaves out the green pepper and adds about 1/2 tbsp each of granulated garlic and ground black pepper to the meat mixture. I'm not sure if lumpia wrappers are the same as egg roll wrappers but the egg roll wrappers are what we use. We use only a little more then 1 tbsp of the meat mixture on each wrapper. I find the thinner you make the layer of meat, the better it tastes. As soon as they come out of the frying pan we sprinkle them with salt on both sides. They taste sooooo good that you don't even need any dipping sauce. These are great served with chicken adobo, pancit, and Jasmine rice.

One of my favorites!!  My mom is Filipino and over the years taught me how to make Lumpia.  It has become a hit with all my friends and my fiance and his family. 
We generally use pork only in ours and instead of bell pepper, we use a couple of celery stalks and add some green onion as well.  
You can chop everything (individually) in a food processor. Helps the time go faster.   They are great to freeze and cook later when that craving hits you!!

My wife used egg roll wrappers and shaped them like egg rolls, and they were excellent. We froze the left overs and thawed the out a couple of months later- still excellent.

My family lived in the philippines when I was little,and we would have this every Sunday for dinner!It was served with fried rice and apple sauce.We changed it some when we got back to the states though.I use just ground chuck,potatoes,green beans,onion,and carrots.All chopped real small,and make sure you put the potatoes in the meat mixture first.I also use lumpia rolls,I like the square ones as well they are easier to unwrap.After reading this I think I will try some soy sauce in it .My family loves this,we even do it for Chrismas or Thanksgiving dinner at times!It brings back great memories,thanks for having it on the site!

My boyfriend is Filipino and decided to try his hand at lumpia.  He followed this recipe for the most part...he used shrimp and pulled chicken to the vegetable mix and we got lumpia wrappers from the grocery store.  The lumpia was awesome and I all ready have requests from friends for him to make more.  Thanks!

This was delicious. Very time consuming to make though. Make sure to follow their directions in making them no bigger around then your thumb (unless you have monster thumbs then you'll want them smaller), otherwise they burn before they are completely cooked through.

Very good, just need seasonings!! I used soy sauce and salt and pepper. Also, banana ketchup or sweet chili sauce is excellent with this and can be found in any oriental market or specially ordered. Similar to my Thai eggrolls, just less ingredients.

This was very good.  I only used ground beef, as I didn't have any ground pork at home.   As another reviewer suggested, I sauteed my ingredients beforehand and drained off the excess fat before stuffing the wrappers.   I wound up using egg roll wrappers as well.  I added some oyster, hoisin, and soy sauces to taste, in addition to cracked black pepper.  Will make again, next time hoping to have some ground pork on hand to add.  We served with duck sauce on the side for dipping.

I will make again but I will omit the green peppers.  Do cook the meat before rolling that way you only need small amount of oil the brown the lumpia .  I also chopped up bean sprouts very small, & instead of chopping carrots shred them.

I changed the recipe and came up with a winner! Do not use bell pepper! Makes egg rolls taste bitter. I take two bags of bean sprouts, four green onions, chopped, shred two carrots, add one cup shredded cheddar cheese, 1 1/2 pounds ground hamburger, 2 Tbsp. soy sauce. Pepper to taste. I use egg roll wrapper that you can find at any store. Brown hamburger, drain all oil. Add all other ingredients and cook on low for five minutes. Drain all mixture in collander. Add shredded cheese. Mix. Roll in egg roll wrapper. Deep fry until golden brown. Serve with sweet and sour sauce. Winner!

I love lumpia. You will only find banana ketchup at the Asian markets that specialize in Filipino foods only.

Love this.. I have made before and usually end up using a little bit of soy sauce when cooking the pork for a little added flavor.  It was a bit hit with my spicy pineapple dipping sauce!
