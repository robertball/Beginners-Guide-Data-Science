Very Tasty! We only had boneless chicken breasts, which I cut up & put  them & the potatoes in the pot at the same time. This really cut done cooking time.

this was very good.  i had everything on hand to make.  i substituted sweet potatoes for the white potatoes.  it smelled wonderful while cooking.  i cooked in the crockpot and added the peppers the last hour of cooking.  with all of the spices used it really did give the chicken a lot of flavor.  after plating it was discovered that by shredding the chicken really did soak up a lot of the liquid.  i could see using this recipe and method to make chicken for tacos or the like.  thanks for the recipe Tasty and Aunt Dora!
