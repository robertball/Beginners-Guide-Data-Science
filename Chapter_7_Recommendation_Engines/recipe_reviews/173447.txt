As I write this review this recipe has a disappointing 3-1/2 star overall rating, yet it only has two reviews, both with 5-star ratings!  Not sure why that is, but I hope the addition of my 5-star rating and review helps at least somewhat to set the record straight. I prepared this recipe fairly closely, however, I substituted black olives for the green (it's what I had on hand and I liked that idea better anyway) and I only used the dressing (with white wine vinegar) to taste - to use the entire amount called for would have been far too much for us. No problem tho' - the dressing is good, so we'll enjoy it on a tossed salad another night.  I also left out the tomatoes as I don't care for what happens to them in salads after refrigeration. If I was to use them, however, I would add them just before serving. This bean salad rivals those you'd find in a gourmet deli, but certainly at a fraction of the cost you'd expect to pay for it there.  Lots of flavors, textures and color interest. A near ideal combination of ingredients.

This is a great recipe. I'm on Phase 1 of the south beach diet and this salad was perfect. It gets better and better the longer it sits.

I omitted the cucumber and red pepper because I didn't have them on hand.  I also used sun dried tomatoes and black olives instead of the fresh and green and the salad was still delicious.   The mustard dressing really livens up the beans and compliments the other ingredients.

I followed this receipe exactly except for substituting balsamic vinegar because I couldn't find the other. It is MOST EXCELLENT!  This is a great salad even if you are not vegetarian.  Ladies, this is the one for your red-meat-loving husband! Mine loved it, though he did say it would be better with less beans.

This is a great make ahead salad.  In making it ahead I did leave the tomatoes and cucumber until right before serving.  I used kalamata olives, Heavenly Marzano tomatoes they are larger than grape tomatoes but smaller than plum (no seeding), 1 large clove of garlic through a press instead of powder, I also did a little larger chop on the peppers, celery, and cucumbers.  I served this at the beach with grilled pork tenderloins, and asparagus.
Leftovers the next day I added a can of Italian can tuna in oil, just as fabulous as a light lunch.

Perfect for dinner on a hot summer day. Refreshing and full of goodness. I will make this often. I did make a few changes based on ingredients I did not have: black olives instead of green olives, red wine vinegar instead of sherry vinegar, red onion instead of green onion. I don't think the recipe suffered from my substitutions.

Love it. Perfect for vegetarians. Omitted cucumbers and added tomatoes at the end. Also added crumbled feta. For the dressing I just did white wine vinegar, olive oil, mustard, salt, pepper.

Easy on the oil and use any wine vinegar. Fresh garlic is always better than garlic powder.  We don't like it really greasy.  I add a can of fine Italian Tuna,drained. (Yes, packed in oil and a little expensive, but worth the difference.) Antipasto!

I had to alter the recipe a bit to accommodate for the fact that I didn't have a cucumber or roasted red peppers.  I used fresh off the vine snap peas and fresh red peppers.  I loved the marriage of flavors.  My herbs were fresh from the garden.   I loved the vinaigrette.  The salad had a nice combination of textures, colors, and robust flavors.  Love this and won't hesitate to make it again.

Loved this recipe! Great flavors and very satisfying. Used it with my vegetarian relatives and they loved it. Makes ALOT though. I doubled it for 18 people as a side dish and we still had 6-8 servings left so one batch probably serves 10-12 as a side.

Made this yesterday following some reviewers suggestions,  and it was incredible.   I did fresh red bell pepper,  black olives, white wine vinegar, and did half chick peas. I doubled the dijon because I love it, halved the olive oil and left out the tomatoes. Added feta which really made the salad. Quick and easy, to the top of my potluck list it goes! Even better the second day.

This recipe is just about perfect for my tastes.  It's got a great balance of flavors, and it sort of seems like it's got an Italian flavor but I'm hard pressed to define it--maybe the green olives or artichokes?  Maybe the seasonings?  It all blends together to be just delicious, and I can't wait to make it again.  Oh...and I couldn't get fresh thyme, so I used about a really fat teaspoon of dried and it was just fine.  I do think using the fresh rosemary made an important difference, though.

This salad just kept getting better and better! We ate on it for 3 days, not wasting a bite. We were sad when it was gone, but I will be making it again soon!

This is a very versatile salad and you provides a great basis for your favorite flavor profile. I left out the green onions and substituted orange bell pepper for the roasted red peppers because of personal preference.  Thank you for a great recipe!  Nice to get in fiber and veggies all in one meal!

I followed this recipe fairly closely, making some substitutions based on what I had (e.g. dried spices, kalamata olives, red wine vinegar, no green onions, 1/2 the olive oil). It was very tasty! Will definitely make it again.

I gave this 4 stars because I used what I had on hand.  I added another 15 oz can of red kidney beans because I took the salad to an Easter dinner.  I also added yellow roasted peppers, black olives, kept the dices tomatoes in a side dish and used  organic white wine vinegar.  Made it the day before.  Tasted delish. There was just a little left in the bowl.  Thanks for sharing.

I was disappointed with this. I think there are just too many ingredients along with too much dressing. I had lots of liquid at the bottom of the bowl. Also it was not as attractive as the picture. Something needs to be omitted or less dressing used.
