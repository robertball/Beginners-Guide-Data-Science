I subbed Swiss cheese for the provolone, but otherwise I kept the ingredients the same.  I would suggest that you do not do as I did and think that a little more would be better.   The ingredients are strong-flavored, and so a little goes a long way.  This was good, and it helped to extend a dinner of leftovers tonight.  I appreciate the recipe!  Thanks!  EDIT 12/26/18:  I have changed my mind about this.  I would keep the ingredients just as written.  When I made the whole batch and served it to company, we all agreed that it is delicious as written!  Please give it a try!
