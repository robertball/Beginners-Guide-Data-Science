This is one of my favorite recipes to serve during football season. I usually do half Velveeta, half sharp cheddar. I will serve it with homemade lime-chili tortilla chips and the bottle of Frank's Hot Sauce. NOTE: Use homemade taco seasoning if you can. It's better than the pre-packaged stuff by a mile. I found Bill Echols is the best from this site.

DELICIOUS!!!! Made this for our weekly "dip night", and we totally tore it up! I didn't use the optional chopped jalapenos because my 2 year old was eating this as well. Oh, and I did use the mild rotel instead of the regular to cut a little heat (again, for the little guy). I also added the beans in with the rest of the ingredients instead of waiting until the end and they cooked up fine with no mushiness or breakage. This dip is a new favorite in my house! Thanks for posting. :)

This is just awesome. I had purchased the ingredients to make this for a picnic this weekend and planned on a double batch. Picnic was rained out but I really wanted to try the recipe. Had not bought the jalapenos because kids and wimpy adults were in on the original plan. Any other time we a re big on thos little peppers.  I did up the amount of black beans just a bit because we love them and visually it looked more balanced color and texture wise. Did put the beans in at the beginning too. Will use this recipe again for sure with some fresh peppers and probably regular onion chopped coarse versus the little green ones. Probably will also try it with other meat options although chicken is my fav. I think it would be great as a filling for a wrapped in tortillas baked enchilada style dish but would then probably cut back on the  Velveeta style cheese so it is a bit firmer. The recipe as is, IS the bomb for a dip.    My husband and I are in heaven with a huge batch of this dip all to ourselves!

AMAZING. I found this recipe searching for a quick slowcooker dip to make. I have a 3qt slow-cooker (I think) and it filled it up to the top! (I bought 2lb of chicken breast but only used half, then the next day I put in the remainder of the ckn in it to eat in tacos).
 ____I modded recipe slightly here is what I did:________

 cooked 2lb chicken in skillet then shredded it.___
 added that+ 2 packages of mexican velveeta,___
 1 can diced tomatoes w chiles,___
 1 can refried beans,___
 1 can mexican beans,___
 Bill Echol's Taco Seasoning I (from this site),___
 1/3 c sour cream.___________     

 I put it all in slow cooker on high for about an hour and a half to make sure it was hot, it was DELICIOUS. Not spicy at all it was perfect. Thank you for this recipe!!!!!_________

    edit: I made this again with my "epic slow cooker mexican chicken" recipe instead of plain chicken and it was unreal. unreeeeaaaaal! ****edit*** I made this again, but used 2 cans of chili instead of mexican beans& refried beans, and it tasted just as good if not better! ****update 4/2/12*** Made this AGAIN, this time around was the BEST yet: used big brick of velveeta queso blanco, 1 can hot chili, 1 can mild chili, 1 can diced tomatoes, bill echols taco seasoning recipe, some of my mex ckn, sour cream. In the words of the Miz: aweeesommmeeee

Took this dip to a party last night and everyone raved about it. I tried to use light ingredients where I could (cheese, sour cream) to lighten up the calorie/fat load. Instead of jalapenos, I used a hotter variety of taco seasoning and the Original RoTel and it was perfect for what I was looking for spice-wise. My dip only took about 45 minutes to get hot in my Crockpot.  This is my new go-to recipe for anytime I need to bring a dish to anything.

This is really good.  The only things I did differently were to marinate the chicken in a chipotle lime marinade for a few hours, and I subbed refried beans for the black beans.  I only did this because my husband doesn't care for black beans, and the only change I think it made was instead of whole beans in the dip I ended up with a creamier, thick concoction.  I would definitely make this again; it's a good twist on the nachos I usually make.

I doubled this, using one can mild Rotel, one hot, and ground beef instead of chicken. Also added spicy Velveeta (the entire block), Chipotle Taco seasoning, saut√©ed red onions instead of green, can of Green Chiles instead of Jalapeno and a very large can of black beans.

I made sure the tomatoes and black beans were drained very well.  I also added a block of cream cheese.  I think that really made the dish - it was nice and creamy and didn't have that overly Velveeta taste.  I didn't have any runniness issues.  I also used two cans of chicken.  It was very good but I am sure it would be even better if you bought and shredded a rotisserie chicken (which I will do next time if I have time).  I made it for a work function so I only added one seeded and diced jalapeno.  I served black olives, diced jalapenos, sour cream with diced green onions and parsely, and hot sauces on the side.  The black olives and diced jalapenos were particularly popular.  It was a huge hit and I got a lot of compliments.  I cooked for 1 1/2 hours on high and 1/2 on low.  The last 1/2 hour I was stirring about every 10 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious! I used 2 large cans of chicken to save time and didn't add any jalapenos. I think the jalapenos would add great flavor but my family cannot tolerate the heat!

I love this recipe so much, it was a big hit for all. However I would add somethings to it, like olives which you would just garnish the dish with, and sour cream with chives. Besides that the dip was amazing! LOVE IT!!!!!

Amazing! I added some olives and that is it! It needed no changes I am just an avid olive lover! Tonight it served as dinner served over chips much cheaper than going out and eating nachos at my favorite restuarant! Tomorrow, since we have leftovers, it is getting wrapped up in tortillas and covered with enchilada sauce and cheese then baked! Couldn't have found a better recipe! Cheap, easy, fast, and multipurpose!

This is perfect as written, I am sure, but I made a few changes for my personal preference. I think this is a perfect base recipe! The only changes I made were to add black olives, used about 1/2 of the velveeta and added 8 oz cream cheese and some shredded cheddar. I dumped everything into the crockpot at the same time and turned it on high for about an hour. I saved some juice from the tomatoes in case it gets too thick later. Wonderful!!! My search has ended for the perfect nacho dip!

Very good!  I didn't add the jalapenos because of the kids, but I think this would be out of this world with a little extra "heat"!  This is so easy and tastes great!  It was a little thin (maybe because I used 2% cheese), so I added some shredded cheddar.  Serve with corn chips or tortillas.  YUM!

I would rather use real cheese and fresh ingredients instead of processed foods. Turned out to be very good.

This is soooo addicting!  I follow the general recipe, but always double it, because it doesn't last long!  I add 8 oz. container for double batch. Sometimes I buy the broasted whole chickens, and pull the meat off the bone, and use instead of cooking chicken.  If I do cook the chicken, I simple boil 4 boneless, skinless breasts in water, add a little salt, pepper and garlic powder, then shred when cooked and throw in the crockpot. I also use a whole can of black beans for a double batch.  I usually use one can of the mild Rotel, and one of the spicy variety.  I skip the jalapeno pepper all together.  I think I may have added black olives to this one time, also.  I also thin with a couple splashes of milk or 1/2 and 1/2 coffee creamer.   I am going to quadruple the batch next month for our neighborhood get-together.   My family asks for this on a regular basis, and so will yours!  Your friends will be asking for the recipe, as well.  Very, very tastey!!!

I used left over turkey and the kids loved it. A little spicy for the husband but he said he would eat it again. I recommend this for an easy dinner instead of eating out!

This recipe is worthy of 10 stars!  I brought it to a girls' night out and it was a huge hit with the ladies.  I can only imagine how much the men would love it, too.  I only used 1/2 cup of the black beans.  It had a little "zing" to it, but not too much.  I kept it warm in my 2 qt. crockpot - - that was the perfect size.  Served it with tortilla scoops.  YUM YUM!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Nandabear.

Wow.. Holy cow. this is awesome.  Warning, I halfed the velveta cheese and made everything else exactly as advertised and it was perfect. I think the whole block would have been too much cheese and not enough of the spices, chicken, tomatoes or black beans.  We used the leftovers to dress up some bean burritos the next day and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.   I'd give it >5 stars if I could.  Not sure if I'd liked it as much with twice the cheese, it probably would have been a bit too heavy.

This is DEFINITELY a five star recipe based on ease of preparation, especially if you keep cooked chicken breast on hand like I do.  I buy family packs of boneless skinless breasts when they go on sale and pop them in the crockpot when I get home from shopping.  When the chicken is done, I shred it and freeze it in separate freezer bags (about 2 breasts per bag).  This recipe could not be simpler.  I did substitute low fat cream cheese and about 1 cup shredded cheddar for the velveeta  because it's what I keep on hand.  I also used a can of HOT Rotel tomatoes and omitted the jalapenos.  This was good served the same day but even BETTER reheated the next day. Will definitely make again.

This is one of my favorite chicken dips! I usually double everything, I put in 1lb velveeta queso,1/2lb regular velveeta. I use mild rotel and add some of my favorite chili powder Buena vida. I use the half the packet. This chili powder may be hard to find. Jungle jims always has it, marsh as well. Everyone always asks for the recipe when  I make this dip.If held in the crockpot for a longer period of time i usally have to thin with milk because soo much chesse. But that's what makes it soo great! Thank you brightlightz for this great dip!!!!

Awesome! I put my frozen chicken breasts in the crockpot with some chicken broth and the Rotel and let them cook; when they were done, I shredded and drained the mixture, then added everything else to the crockpot and heated it on low.  I used fajita seasoning and I didn't have green onion, but I added some chopped olives.  I had no problem with it being too thick; in fact, mine was a little thin so I added some shredded cheddar trying to thicken it up.  I topped my serving with chunky salsa and it's a great Saturday night dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

This dip is fantastic!  I made if for a party and it was gone in no time.  As a matter of fact, I am stopping at the store today to pick up the ingredients to make it this weekend.  For those worried about it getting too spicy with the jalapeno, take out the seeds and ribs and it takes the heat away and leave a nice fresh flavor.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!

Sooo Delicious!  I made this for Bunco night and it was the first to go.   Has just a bit of kick, but not too much.  My 3 & 2 year olds even liked it!  I also gave the recipe to my sister for a bridal shower and she was 1st place for best recipe!  Thank you for the yummy slow cooker appetizer!

This was very good. I only found Rotel Tomatoes in a 10 oz. can so that's what I used.  I used 1/2 lb. Velveeta 2% and 1/2 lb. Sharp Cheddar as another review suggested and I used the entire can of Black Beans rinsed and drained.  Another reviewer suggested to save the drained tomato juice to thin out a little if needed and I did use some of it.  My husband said "It's a keeper".  We used it as a meal with salad so it served 4 rather than 12.  I will make this again.  I think it would also be good with either sausage or ground meat.

I absolutely love this dip!!! I think the shredded chicken really makes it. I have made the full recipe and it was devoured by 5 people. But sometimes when I am craving it I will just make a smaller version and melt it in the microwave. I don't use the black beans or taco seasoning and if I don't have sour cream I just use a little milk to make it more liquidy. I do add a block of cream cheese to make it extra cheesy.

Just use the microwave and believe it or not, canned chicken. SO GOOD. We heated corn tortillas and ate it with them. Could not stop eating.

This was very good, but not quite WOW. I used salsa instead of diced tomatoes because my family always likes it better. I also added shredded cheddar, extra chicken and black beans. Will probably make again, but will try to umph it up a bit. Thanks!

Yummy! Only mini changes was to use pre-cooked fresh chicken strips (like Perdue cut-ups), that I chopped up, and 2% velveeta cheese and low fat sour cream. Stayed nice and warm in the crockpot. Served with tortilla chips. I personally loved the black beans in this recipe. Thanks for a quick, easy, crockpot appy!

Quick and easy!  I made this today as a trial run for the upcoming holiday appetizers.  After I tried a sample, I decided to just pour a big scoop of it over a plate of nacho chips  and call it dinner.  Good stuff!   Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I was looking for a way to use some leftover cooked chicken and decided to use this recipe as a main dish by using it as a burrito filling.  I honestly was not expecting to love this as much as I did.  The rest of my family loved it, as well.  It has great flavor and is quite filling.  It is also good with tortilla chips as a dip.  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful, versatile recipe, brightlightz!

Just great! Everyone loved it at the Super Bowl Party I was hosting! Instead of the mixed tomatoes with green chili peppers, I just used a can of diced tomatoes, drained along with some pickled jalapenos, chopped. I also had some left over rotisserie chicken which I chopped up. I used a whole can of black beans and dumped them in with everything else like others have done. I did not put in the sour cream as my little crock pot was already over flowing with the ingredients! But it tasted just fine without it and possibly better after topping some chips with the nacho dip, fresh salsa, slices of pickled jalapenos, sour cream and green onions! YUM!

This dip is off the hook! Used 2 cans of chicken instead of the breasts, taco seasoning mix I from AR, no jalapenos, it was spicy enough. Mixed it all together, threw in the microwave to melt. Couldn't have been easier. Excellent taste, it would also be good rolled up in a tortilla! Thanks brightlightz!

Excellent! Even the kids like it. My simple alterations: put cooked chicken through my chopper to make the pieces smaller; use half pound of Velveeta and use cheddar or hot pepper cheese in place of the other half pound (really, I just guess - just dump some in!); and, last time I made it I forgot to add the sour cream and we didn't even notice! It's delicious and so easy to make. I cook chicken breast tenderloins in the crock pot (since they are small they cook faster), then let them cool slightly and run them through the chopper and throw them back in the crock pot. Dump in all the other ingredients and in about 30 minutes or so, your dip is ready for the big football game! Enjoy

addictive dip! made it for nacho Tuesdays. not sure why it needs to be cooked in slow cooker, I cooked on stove top, turned out nicely melted and quicker!

didn't add the peppers and beans- as my kids don't care for 'em. instead of green onions, added some cilantro instead for freshness. 

it does make a lot of dip, next time I would halve the recipe, but a keeper recipe.

Yummy! I made this for dinner last night. We just made chicken nachos and topped them with sour cream and it was oh so good. Will make again. If was going to make it as a dip for a party I would double it. We had no leftovers between 3 of us.

This was a delicious recipe.  I added a few more jalepenos because hubby likes spicy dishes. I did not have black beans so I substituted a can of sweet corn. The spicyness of the jalepenos and the sweetness of the corn blended nicely! Definately will make this one again and again.

I made this for my potluck at work and it was the first dish to be emptied out! I did use the homemade taco seasoning by Bill Echols that someone else mentioned. Everyone raved about it and I will be making again. I'm sure it's fine if you don't tweak it, but I did add about 8-9 more cubes of cheese than called for....other than that, PERFECTO!

This was a hit at a recent get together.  I made it - without having made it (or tasted it) before!  I was hoping that all of the reviews were right... and they were!  This was absolutely delicious and was the first thing gone that evening!  Everyone was eating it up - and going back for seconds!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I did not include the jalapeno pepper - and there was plenty of kick.  I made it as an appetizer for the party - but tonight I'm making it as dinner for my family!  Excellent.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would!  You can't go wrong making this recipe - and it's so easy since you just throw it all into a crockpot and let it warm up!

Great recipe. The family loved it, even my daughter who usually doesn't like "Mexican" dishes. Upped the taco seasoning to 2 T. , used fat free cream cheese instead of sour cream, also seasoned black beans (whole can) and half the Velveeta. Omitted the green onion and jalapeno. Used as a filling for soft flour tortillas. Topped them w/ salsa and baked at 400 for 10 min. Added some cheese on top and baked for 10 more minutes. Was AWESOME! Trying it next time w/ shredded chicken. Thanks brightlightz.

I know that this is not your typical Queso even though they may share some of the same ingredients.  I made the recipe almost as written.  I did not have any green onions on hand so that was left out.  I followed another reviewer suggestion and made my own taco seasoning, "Bill Echols" Taco Seasoning mix" from this site.  I boiled the chicken breasts with seasoned salt, garlic powder, a little black pepper.  It was moist and added even more flavor.  Would definitely keep this one since it is so easy to make and great to share with others.  Perfect for potlucks too.  I cooked it at medium instead of high and kept it warm for people to just serve into their plates.  I didn't have a problem with it being runny as some did.  Delicious!

It's a great recipe, my family loved it but I think you can make it on the stove top quicker than the crock pot.

This is really tasty!  I doubled the recipe and skipped the jalapenos (tried to make it crowd-easy).  I used a package of Just Chicken from Trader Joe's, used half Velveeta and half grated sharp Cheddar cheese, two cans of black beans, and Taco Seasoning I from this site.  I warmed it on the stove, thinned it with a little milk (next time I'll not drain all the juice from the RoTel), and dumped it in my fire-orange vintage crockpot to take to the school where my daughter teaches for Snack Day.  I hope they like it as much as we did!  Thanks, brightlightz!

Great.  I like to put the shredded chicken in last to avoid being mushy.  It is fabulous with steamed broccoli and baked potato as leftover after the party!

Everyone in my family had never had Texas-queso before, and loved it! We used rotisserie chicken and pulled it with a fork to create shreds. I gave my mom and aunt a hard time for buying a "cheat" of already cooked chicken.. and it ended up tasting better with the rotisserie chicken! Highly recommend this short cut! Also added more sour cream for more creaminess and a touch of sharp cheddar from the taco mixes we had. Loved it!

This recipe was terrific. I was asked to bring a warm appetizer to a family gathering but we have always brought the same ten dishes or so to potlucks. This was the only new thing there and it was literally raved about. Each person wanted the recipe which made me laugh because I envisioned our next gathering being ten crockpots full of this stuff.

I used queso blanco velveeta, kept everything else the same but did add the black beans in the beginning.  Everyone loved this including picky husband and son.  Will definately be making this again, I am craving it all ready.

This dip is AWESOME! Even my picky 4 year old daughter had seconds! To make my life easier, I started by cooking my chicken breast, onion & can of tomatoes in the crockpot on high for 3 hours, then shredded the chicken. Next I added cheese (I'm not a fan of Velveeta, so I used 8oz each of cheddar & colby jack blocks), Bush's Black Bean Fiesta (I didn't drain it) instead of regular black beans, and the other ingredients, and cooked on high for an hour. YUM! This is a new favorite for our family!

This is really yummy!  I like that it has chicken instead of ground beef in it.  If you're lazy like I am you can use the breasts from a store-cooked rotisserie chicken & make it even easier!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely love this stuff. I have made it every week now for over a month. Only thing I do different is omit the black beans. I can honestly make a meal out of this, can't get enough. This dip with a bag of Fritos scoops and all is good;)

I love this. It's one of the few things I make that people love. Great w hamburger or chicken or just vegetarian.  I like pinto beans or both black n pinto. I suggest Rotel over other brands and half velveeta with shredded cheese. Be careful if you use a cheap crock pot that cooks too high. The cheese and sour cream will come out funky. Works best for me in a quality crock pot on low for longer so all the yumminess can join forces!

I tried this, followed the recipe exactly, but mine turned our too runny...wouldn't stay on the Fritos Scoops...I think I'd try just melting the cheese in Microwave and folding in other ingredients.
taste was good, but too soupy!

This was a hit.  Instead of using a crockpot I put it in a 350 oven stirring occasionally until cheese melted.  Everyone loved it and I didn't even use the jalape√±os.  But I think I will the next time to kick it up a notch.

Delicious recipe.  Will definitely make again, especially to take somewhere.  Used half sharp cheddar cheese and some extra taco seasoning and black beans.  Didn't use jalapenos but did add Frank's hot sauce and some habanero sauce to taste.  My family loved it!

This was a winner!!  I made this for a superbowl party and everyone loved it.  I did take the recommendations from some of the othes reviews buy adding half a block of cream cheese and half a package of shreaded sharp cheddar cheese.  I also used ground turkey instead of the chicken.  Can't wait to make this again.

This was really good! I made a few minor changes [canned chicken, and then canned cheddar cheese soup because I don't like velveeta], and it came out great! My only issue was that I wasn't sure how much chicken to use, weight-wise, so I don't think I used enough. I also would have liked it to be more tomato-y, so I think I would use two cans next time. Other than that, it was really good! Served it with fritos scoops :]

This is great using crab instead of chicken, skip the beans and use cream cheese instead of sour cream.  I haven't tried the taco seasoning, which sounds like it would be good, and would suggest some red pepper instead if you wanted to try something else.

Yummy! I used regular Rotel and Medium taco seasoning, and it came out with a zing but not too hot. I did not use jalapenos. I cooked the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and chicken broth in the crock pot all day, then came home and shredded them. I drained off the broth before adding the chicken and other ingredients. I HATE green onions, so instead I used half a small yellow onion, and sauteed it before adding. I added the whole can of beans instead of 1 cup. I think next time I might try using half processed cheese, and half sharp cheddar, as suggested by another reviewer.

Made this with leftover roasted turkey and left out the jalapenos. Needed to add the reserved liquid from the Ro-Tel. Very tasty. Thank you for the recipe.

Sooooooooo good!  Was short on Velveta & filled in with montery jack.  Great hot, warm, or room temp.  Recipe as written was perfect for us.  Taste--need more heat?  Add whatever to heat it up to your taste buds.  Major winner--and very addictive.

We made this dip with a couple slight variations. We added some paprika and chili powder. It turned out awesome! This is a super easy and delicious dip! A big crowd pleaser.

Outrageous is right!  This was the hit of our Superbowl party.  I put more chicken and could have used the entire can of black beans. If I have a larger crowd than 6, I will definitely double the recipe.

I made this for our new years eve appetizer buffet. Was definitely too spicy for the kids but hubby and I enjoyed this a lot. I used one large can of canned chicken to be simpler but otherwise kept the recipe the same.  Thanks!

Made this appetizer for our crock pot themed gourmet group dinner.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  My granddaughter loved the leftovers and requested I make it at Thanksgiving. Very good and easy.

This is the best dip I have ever had!  Make sure you cook it long enough and all your velveeta is cooked.  Who wants big clumps of cold velveeta cheese?

YUMMY! I make a dip very similar to this and was surprised how much this one tasted like mine (with a few different ingredients). The guys were eating it up VERY quickly! Very tasty! I put the beans in with everything else and didn't have a problem with them getting mushy or breaking! We used the leftovers and made nachos the next day. Will def be on the dip rotation list :)

This dip is incredible!!  The only alteration I made was to add creole seasoning - for that extra kick!  I made this for our New Year's party & again for a Cinco De Mayo party & it was the most popular dip at both events!!  I leave it in the slow cooker on warm & it stays warm all evening!  It's even amazing reheated!  Thanks SO much for this recipe!!  I will definitely make it again & again!

I love this dip!  This does not have that over-powering, too-rich "cheese" taste that many of the queso recipes w/velvetta seem to have.  I also chose to not drain the can of tomatoes/chilis.  As far as my guests' opinions, one guest had down-loaded the recipe before they even left the party.  Thank you for a very delicious and jazzed up recipe!

If you're considering making this dip, stop thinking about it and DO IT! It's awesome. I made this dip for our New Year's Eve party, and it was my first use of my new slow cooker. I doubled the recipe, but used 3 chicken breast halves. I kept seeing people sneaking over to the slow cooker and taking more. It was even tasty the next day, and my hungry boys talked about it for days after. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this for My inlaws+ family for my daughters 7th birthday. Served it with taco chips for dipping, and cooked in my crockpot for 4hrs. It was fantastic! Great accompanyment to the "Cheddar Beef Enchiladas" and the "Absolute Mexican Cornbread", both from this site. Everyone raved!

People were flipping out over this dip. Not quite sure why it had to be made in a crock pot. One jalopeno barely made a dent, maybe 3 would be appropriate.

Yum!  I'd definitely use a little more jalapeno to spice it up next time but it was very good.  Not nearly as good as leftovers however so make what you need.

Both my husband and I really liked this dip. I did not give it 5 stars simply because I didn't follow the recipe to a T.  I forgot to drain the tomatoes but IMO  that didn't make this dip unworthy of a good rating. Next time I will opt for using some of the liquid and purchasing the canned tomatoes with a bit more spices though.  I happen to have numerous bags of shredded cheese on hand because of a sale so I chose to use a mexican blend one instead of the Velveeta.  Worked just fine.  I chose to heat mine in the oven because I'm not crazy about crock pot heated dips.  Will be making this again.

I cringed when I bought VelveetaProcessed Cheese Food! However, the rest of the recipe looked pretty good, so I went ahead. Everyone liked it, so I'll make it again, although I may try using some grated cheddar cheese for part of  the Velveeta.

I added cumin to give it a little more of a Mexican flavor and some chopped chiles to give it a little spice.

This is a very tasty dip. I made it exactly by the recipe. I thought that it was a little too thick so the next time I make it I will add more Rotel tomatoes.

This was a fabulous, crowd pleasing dip.  I followed the directions with a few changes taken from other reviewers.  I added a block of cream cheese, changed the green onions for regular as my hubby doesn't tolerate green ones very well, added some extra diced jarred Jalapenos and omitted the black beans.  I also boiled the chicken in some chicken broth with cumin and chili powder for some extra flavor.   I highly recommend this dip :)

It was a hit! Hope to try it again soon. Definitely liked the suggestion of half block cheese and half cheddar cheese. I also incorporated 4 oz cream cheese.

I have made this recipe 5 times now. It is easy and my family and friends have really enjoyed it. I usually follow the recipe as stated and it has turned out great each time. Rotel also has  diced tomatoes with lime juice and cilantro that can offer up a flavor change for those who like cilantro.

It was good.  The kids liked it but honestly if I was going to eat all the fat calories,  I might as well just have the beef too.  I probably won't make this with chicken again but will definitely try it with beef.

Made this for hubby's work for Cinco de Mayo.  Everyone loved it.  I did add a lot more jalepenos because we like things spicy.  I also added corn, because, well, corn!

This was a nice change from the beef queso dip I usually make. Didn't have to really modify at all, other than I left out the jalape√±os, bc we don't care for a lot of heat. Would make again. Thank you!

I didn't have black beans like I thought. So I used 1/4 cup of kidney beans(will add more next time). Everyone really liked this in my family. I did not add the peppers. I think the peppers would have added too much spice for my family. Next time I will use less velveeta cheese. It was just a tid bit thick for my liking. Overall I like this dip. I served it with blue corn tortilla chips. This was our dinner for the night and it turned out good. Everyone was happy in the end.

I thought this was a little too velveta tasting & too thick. I'll try it again & cut back the velveta & supplement with cheddar &/or jalape√±o jack. I think I will also try it adding an additional can of Rotel, drained, saving the liquid to thin the dip. I think the onions in the Rotel are enough without adding extra.

I have made this literally 100 times! It is always a HUGE hit and it is easy to have the ingredients on hand.  I have used both rotisserie chicken and canned chicken and it is great either way! I am not allowed to show up at a party without this awesome dip!!!

Awesome dip!  Made it for an office party and been printing out the recipe for everyone!  I doubled the recipe and added some white cheese dip that I got at my local mexican restaurant.  I omitted the jalapeno's and bought a rotisserie chicken at the walmart deli.  YUM!

The dip as a hit with my relatives so much so that they requested a replay.  Although I try to go completely by the recipe the first time I try something, time only allowed me to use a convection oven to prepare this.  Fortunately, the dish was not affected.  There was just enough heat and spices to appeal to even the most delicate tastes.  I'll be making this again.

Easy winner dinner for my family! I didn't change a thing in this cheesy nacho chicken dish but I did hold the japelenas om te side because they are not my fav. Though it's called a dip, it seemed meal worthy to me so I made it for dinner. The versatility of this crock pot meal is what caught my attention when I read the recipe and it worked out as I intended...which doesn't always happen.  My husband and I each put the nacho 'dip' onto a salad with crushed tortilla chips- yum! My teens chose differently, one wrapped it in soft tortillas with lettuce and shredded cheddar and the other ate it atop a plate full of crispy tortillas chips with a dollup of sour cream on top. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it is now printed and added to my dinner arsenal.

this dip is great. i have made it for numerous crowds and it is always a big hit. I find that making it with the meat from a rotisserie chicken works best and I usually add a can of corn to give it a little extra girth.

I made this as a pinch dinner. Two chicken breasts seasoned with a tablespoon of taco seasoning and cooked in slow cooker added some kick. I was out of sour cream so subbed a mixture of yogurt and mayo with a splash of lemon juice. Then discovered I was also out of black beans so subbed a can of Navy instead. My two teenage boys were nice enough to leave about a cup of it so I could try  it also. Even though I had to sub a few ingredients it turned out awesome which speaks to the diversity of this recipe.

This is an excellent dish! I also added the black beans toward the end of the cooking time, just to warm them through. The second time I made this, I chopped a yellow onion, cooked it 5 minutes in the microwave, then added it to the dish right at the beginning of the cooking time.

Made this for a family gathering and everyone loved it so much, that I'm making it again today for everyone. I like a little spice so the jalape√±o ‚Äôs are necessary this time. Also added a bit more cheese so it wasn't so thick. More for pouring over the nacho chips.

Delicious...my kids devoured it. It's very forgiving if you don't have exactly the right ingredients. I subbed cream cheese for sour cream.  Also used canned chicken instead of fresh.

So good and easy! Couldn't stop eating it. Followed recipe exactly except: left out pepper and onions, and cooked on low on the stove... for about 15 minutes, until the cheese melted. If you cook on the stove, just watch the pot and stir often ...  even at a low temperature, the mixture gets bubbly and wants to stick to the bottom of the pan.

This was great...really great!!! I read some of the reviews and halved the velveeta and used sharp cheddar and cream cheese. Perfect!!! Will make this regularly.

I'd probably rate this a 3.5 for personal tastes - I guess I'm just not a huge Velveeta fan (too sweet).  If I make this again, I'll probably do as some others suggested and cut the Velveeta in half with regular sharp cheddar.  My daughter would love this tho :)  Thanks so much for recipe.

I made this dip for a football party and it was a hit! I boiled the chicken breast before I added them to the crockpot. I also added about a cup of grated cheddar cheese to thicken it up a bit. It was so good and there was no left overs. Next time, I will double the recipe.

What a great twist on the standard processed cheese dip! Since there were no special instructions for cooking the chicken, I boiled it for 20 minutes in chicken stock and the remainder of the taco seasoning from the package.

this recipe is delish!  i omitted the black beans, and used the white queso velveeta. i'd like to try it next time with the beans, and substitute the chicken for hamburger, for something different. also, the 2nd time i made it i didn't have sour cream, and it was still devoured. this is my new go to rotel recipe!

I changed it a bit. As I don't really care for jalapeno peppers, I used the chipolte taco seasoning blend which gave it a smokey flavor. Instead of the black beans, I used Black Bean and Corn Salsa that can be purchased @ Walmart (their brand). And when I baked my chicken breasts, I rubbed in some of the chipolte taco seasoning mix first.

It was good, as expected. My party goers would have preferred to skip the chicken, so next time I would probably just make it as a cheese dip. Or they suggested ground beef. They just though the shredded chicken was too chewy with the dip.

Really good as is. Tried it for the first time and kept to the recipe with the exception of dicing the Jalapenos (kept them whole) and I added a little bit of "Frank's" hot sauce. My Mother (of all people, Mrs. Diet herself) inhaled it. I think next time, I'll use a little less chicken. It's a great dip to reheat over and over again - if you have any left!!

We've made this many, many times and everyone always loves it - we use the Perdue Shortcuts Southwest Chicken Breasts (one package, cut up a little bit more then how they come), jalapeno Velveeta and the hot taco seasoning. It's definitely spicey but no one has ever complained that it was too spicey!

Yummy and fantastic!  I shredded rotisserie chicken along with the velveeta, RO*TEL Habanero, 2 jalapeno peppers diced, 1/2 cup green onion and 2 tbls of hot taco seasoning (we like food with a good kick) then thew it all in a pot (the crockpot was in use already).  Once the cheese melted, I mixed everything together really well and added the black beans.  The husband couldn't stop eating it (we used Tostitos "scoops" chips).  This is a really fun recipe perfect for any occasion.  If you make it hot like I did, you may need some extra tissues for the watery eyes! haha

Num! This went over really well at our work Super Bowl potluck! The sour cream cuts the richness and saltiness of the Velveeta nicely. I was too lazy and used 2 large cans of canned chicken breast - worked perfectly! I didn't have the onions or jalapenos but the RoTel is far and away plenty spicy for me. A great recipe to tinker with, too! Thank you.

I love this dip!  It's delicious as written and also easy to adapt to your tastes.  I took this to a July 4th party and it was soooooo good.  I loved it so much, I have made it several times since.  I have used the Mexican Velveeta (which is my favorite) and the 2% Velveeta (which seems to be thinner in consistency).  Every time I've made it, it receives rave reviews, even the kids like it.  This is definitely part of my meal rotation now!!

Very tasty treat! I would cut down the time in the crock pot though...mine got too hot and even after turning off was still hot enough to serve after 1 1/2 hours at rest. Yikes!

Took this to my monthly crop and it was a hit!  I did add a little more sour cream and a tiny bit of chicken broth.  Next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I'll leave the broth out.  Delicious!

Awesome as is, but our new favorite version was bore only out of missing ingred. Sub 1/2 of the veveeta for a brick of cream cheese. We love this as nachos or wrapped in flour tortilla, pour enchilada sauce on top and bake for 20min.  Great recipe that will be used over and over again.

Yum! Easy to make, too. This should be your game-day staple. I'm going to try it at this fall's tailgate. You can easily alter the spiciness to accommodate your group.

I stumbled across this recipe in 2009. I was looking for a dip recipe for a super bowl party......glad I did. Everyone loved this recipe. Well I have been searching allrecipes for this dip and I could never find it because I did not save it in my recipe box and did not know the name. I could only remember the Ro*tel tomatoes, shredded chicken, taco seasoning mix, and velveeta cheese.  It has taken me 22 months to locate it and I made sure I saved it this time. This is a delicious recipe. You can really eat by all by yourself with no help from anyone. It is just that good.

I thought this recipe was great, but not as a dip. I made it up but then I layered it between some crushed flavored tortilla chips (Doritos) and baked until the cheese melted. I baked at 375. This made it feel like a meal for me and my family.

Made this dip for my husband's UFC guys night.Only put in 1 shredded half chicken breast seasoned with chipotle sauce and that was plenty meaty for us also there is no rotel in Canada that I know of ,so I replaced it with canned diced tomatoes.Also did only 11 oz of velveeta and 5 oz of old cheddar other then that I kept the recipe the same. Everyone enjoyed it. Cooked it on high for an hour and 1 hour on low. Served it with tostitos scoops.

A friend of mine brought this dip to a super bowl party I had and it was a huge hit. I made this using a store bought cooked rotisserie chicken I got in the deli (one that is hot and ready to buy). I took the meat off and chopped it up to make things easier. It turned out great! I took the dip to a party last night and received rave reviews! This dip is one I will make time and time again.

This was very good, we ate it as a side dish with some Scoops chips.  I'm not a fan of Velveeta's taste though...I need to find a milder cheese to make this perfect.

So, so yummy! I loved it. It reminded me of a wonderful dip my aunt would make. I used a whole can of black beans and a whole packet of taco seasoning. I also left out the chicken. Um, however I did try cooking it on high for an hour or too, but it began to burn so I switched back down to low and still had to stir it often. Make sure to use plenty of jalapenos. =)

Definitely a hit with the whole family- the only change I made was to put the jalpenos on the side. Without those, it was pretty tame, heat-wise.

I didn't drain the Rotel and I used diced white onion since I had no green ones. Delish! Very nice change from the standard queso.

Delicious dip.  Was a huge hit this New Year's Eve.  I made the following changes: omitted the black beans, used 2% Velveeta, light sour cream, used one 13 oz can of chicken breast in place of cooked and shredded chicken breast, and I added a package of light sour cream.  This is my new favorite warm dip!

Good and addicting!   I followed others' advice and made the taco seasoning mix from Bill Echols on this site.  Since that mix is a bit spicy, this dip was a bit spicy but it has a really good flavor.   I started eating it before I remembered to add the black beans at the end but  it was still very good!

This is absolute must have dip for any occasion! I made this dip on Saturday for a party we had, and there was nothing left of it in no time! Still had leftovers of lots of other things but this dip! It is so good that you can't stop eating it! I will safely say that it has taken the place of my faithful queso dip and it is now my favorite!

I took this to my office party last night and almost everyone has asked for the recipe. The only thing I changed was to add more jalapenos!  Thanks for a great recipe that is easy to make and very delicious!!

This is very similar to the ground beef version I've made for years.  I love the addition of black beans and chicken. I did use homemade taco seasoning; it tasted so much better. Great for game day snacking. Warm, hearty, and comforting.

This stuff is really freaking tasty! I made it as the directions say, minus onions cause I hate me some onions, and it was quite the hit. We used the leftovers for taco night and just slapped some of this on our softshells with the other ingredients. So good!!!

Yummy halved the recipe and Used rotisserie chicken. Didn‚Äôt have Rotel so I used  1 C of diced cherry tomato‚Äôs and salsa. I added cumin, rouge pimento and garlic salt to add some flavor. I‚Äôll make it again.

This came together very easily and was an amazing dip.  I left off the beans, as my family isn't much for eating beans.  I also used homemade taco seasoning recipe from Bill Echols at this site.  I used this dip for a tailgate party, and it did tend to get thick as it sat thru the game, so I suggest making it and using it up within the hour.

This was a great dip for the games boiled the chicken breast with approx 2 cups of chicken broth and the taco seasoning. Then I shredded it and added chicken and broth to the dip. It was a little then so I also added 1/2 package of cream cheese. It was delicious!

Great recipe but was bland to me. I used a mini crockpot so I halved all of the ingredients. I added canned corn and crushed red peppers to it. It added sweetness and a great kick without being too hot. (Which is great for kids). I didn‚Äôt use Velveeta instead I used cream cheese and Mexican blend cheese. The flavors didn‚Äôt pop the way I wanted it to so I added just a pinch of sea salt.  I did use two table spoons of milk to make it a scoopable consistency. Overall, this is so delicious! Just add/ substitute what you would like to make it even better.

It was a big hit. Much more hearty than the standard quest. I made it for my bible study group here in San Antonio, where Mexican food rules supreme.Didn‚Äôt use green onions, as my husband won‚Äôt get within a mile of any kind of onion, so I threw in a can of drained corn just because I wanted to. Will definitely make again .

I usually like to make the recipe as is and then make changes if needed, but this recipe was so good I didn't make any changes! I was wanting something different than the normal cheese dip. I will make again. Very very good!

This was awesome!  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand.  I drained a large can of chicken and shredded it.  I also used a jar of my favorite queso.  Not being a fan of  jalape√±o or raw onion, I skipped these, but added some Frank's Hot sauce.   I refrigerated this mixture overnight. The Next day I heated until bubbly in the micro and served over warm tortilla strips in a large festive dish.  I garnished with dollops of sour cream,  sliced tri color mini peppers and black olives.  It was a huge hit.  Next time I will add some corn and fresh chopped tomato as well.  You can easily adapt with ingredients you prefer.

This is a really nice alternative to the traditional RoTel dip. The addition of taco seasoning adds bonus flavor. Really tasty. I made the chicken breasts from frozen in my Instant Pot, saving a ton of time. A very quick and hearty dip!

I forgot to drain the Rotel so added an extra 8oz of Velveeta and it was great!  Those who like it spicier added salsa or jalape√±os and everyone was happy.

Great base recipe for a dip! If you do anything initially, definitely add at least a half cup of milk to thin it out.

Made this for game night and got rave reviews. The little that was left the next day fell prey to my niece and nephew. I was in a time crunch and used canned, shredded chicken breast. You don't know me or what my day was like so just mind your business.

I make this dip all the time but with a number of additions. First, I bake chicken tenders with Mexican seasoning (McCormick) sprinkled on them.  Bake, cool and cut into bite size pieces.  I increased black beans to one can (rinsed) black beans.  One generous cup salsa, and pepper jack cheese. I small bag frozen corn.  Cook in a slow cooker for two hours. This dip has become my signature dip.  Everyone loves it and I am always asked to bring this dip to parties, events, etc.  It is delicious!

Love this recipe. Turned out so delicious. Used it as filling in a tortilla and as a dip with chips. I don‚Äôt eat Velveeta so I used half queso fresco and half Colby jack. The queso fresco doesn‚Äôt melt well so next time I will use cream cheese. It‚Äôs good as leftovers the next day too.

Loved this! I did not follow exact measurements. I used (2) 10oz cans of Rotel and (1) full can of black beans. I also took a shortcut and used (2) large cans of chicken. I skipped the jalapenos.

Coworker brought this in and we enjoyed it, but would suggest the recipe specify CANNED black beans.  I made the assumption to use canned, but she did not and spent a lot of extra time picking (most of the) hard, dried, black beans out of the dip, wondering why they hadn't cooked.  Prepared with canned beans left in this would have been even better.

Made this, but doubled it.  It was not as thick as I was expecting.   Realized I put less than double the cheese ! It served well in a bowl.   Use less cheese and you have a chili recipe!  I did put in cayenne pepper because I thought it needed more heat.  I am sure using the right amount of cheese will be  the best dip.  I plan to use the recipe again!

I crammed this into a small slow cooker and of course cut way back on the serving size as I was only making this for two people.  Without the beans yet, I thought there was no way this was going to cook within two hours nor have room to add the beans but it worked out great.  It all settled down and mixed nicely and was also still enough for about 10 people.  Very good party dish.

Like many of you, I didn't want to use processed cheese.  I opted instead to replace it with a package of Tillamook Sauce Starter- ConQueso.  (It's in the cheese aisle!) 

Because of that, I eliminated the jalapenos- as this has quite a kick.  Because the starter is made with milk, I replaced the sour cream with cream cheese, and I added two cups of grated sharp cheddar cheese.  
In addition, I added some sliced olives.  
This is an absolutely delicious dip this way- and although I didn't ever use the Velveeta, I loved it the way I prepared it.

This had fabulous flavor.  I didn't have a whole block of Velveeta, so I added a brick of cream cheese to compensate.  I also added some chopped deli style jalapeno slices instead of fresh ones.  I like the 'tamed' ones, they have the jalapeno flavor without all the heat.  I also added some corn and a small can of chopped green chiles.

I didn‚Äôt make any huge changes. The only changes I made were seasoning the chicken breast and using Monterrey and Colby cheese instead. For leftovers I used Doritos for chips which gave it an extra kick.

Was great - I didn't use as much chicken as the recipe called for - I should have.  Maybe even a little extra next time.  Also, used some black beans with seasoning and corn in them.  Great.

These nachos are surprisingly good.  I used a shredded Mexican cheese blend instead of the processed cheese.  I also seasoned my chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and cumin.  That said, I tasted the dip before adding the chicken and it was still amazing.  I guess I also had to add about 1/3 cup milk to thin it out some.  I made mine on low heat on the stove instead of in a crockpot.  It worked just fine and did not take nearly as long.

I wouldn't change a thing.  Well, I did add a bit of mozzarella, but that's because I am a cheeseaholic. This is a great dip.  We used it as a complete dinner with tortilla chips.

Subbed the velveeta for 8 oz cream cheese and 8 oz cheddar cheese. Maybe put in a bit more cheese next time. Also did 2 cans black beans. Turned out really great for our housewarming party and I'm looking forward to using the leftovers in burritos like another reviewer suggested.

Awesome appetizer! I made mine with canned chicken (2 large cans) but followed the rest of the recipe as is. I thought it might not be thick enough, but I transferred it to a dish and by the time we were ready to dig in, it had thickened up to the perfect consistency. It disappeared VERY quickly!

I made this with boiled chicken breasts cut into bite size pieces and added an extra can of rotel tomatoes & jalapenos with the ingredients and our first bite was just ok but as we ate it with a few more chips it became addicting and was very tasty! We will definitely make it again as it is one of our favorites now. It's very meaty and can be eaten as a meal if you like nachos.

Made this for a party.  Huge hit.  Used it for topping tortilla chips and putting in wraps.  Half Velveeta cheese and half shredded mexican style cheese.  Cooked on medium in crock pot for an hour and a half until cheese melted then left it on warm for several hours while the party went on.  Mostly gone by the end, but left overs were great the next day too.

We really enjoyed this and since we had some leftover, we put it into tortillas with rice and made nacho enchiladas.  Delicious.

Even without the boneless chicken breast, this was by far the best dip I've ever made! I'm not a cook but watching my family gobble this up made me feel like one!

This was delicious! Even my picky eater loved it! I cooked the chicken breasts in the crockpot first, then shredded them and added the other ingredients. I put in the whole can of beans and added frozen corn. Loved it!

I made this for a Super Bowl party and Holy Deliciousness!!!  I doubled the recipe and added 2 boxes of cream cheese to make it a little creamier, I also added 2 small cans of drained sliced black olives.  I bought an already cooked Rotisserie Chicken from Costco and shredded the meat off of it, I also made my own taco seasoning and served the jalapeno slices on the slide.  SO freaking good!

I just made this tonight. I liked it but wasn‚Äôt wow‚Äôd by it. I used regular chicken breasts that I cooked in the oven and shredded but I think next time I would use chicken from a rotisserie chicken (from the store). I just like that meat much better. My chicken was a little tough and kinda bothered me. I‚Äôm weird like that with my meats. But overall, it was good. Everyone enjoyed it. I would recommend making.

This was a big hit at our monthly game night.  I used 2 pounds of velveeta with jalape√±os, 2 cans of rotel and a packet of taco seasoning.  Left out the green onions.  Everything else per recipe.  Delish!!!!!

Based on the reviews, I was expecting this to me much better.  I served it at a game night and everyone agreed it was missing something but we couldn't decide what.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as I was expecting.

We all enjoyed it. Very tasty with the chicken. I used a chicken breast and a can of chicken. The canned chicken is easier to use in that I didn‚Äôt have to shred it. 

We will definitely be making it again for the holidays.

It was real good, I didn't want to use Velveeta due to the high processed  cheese so I just used cheddar. Plus I didn't use the Jalapenos either.
To me the dip tasted pretty bland.

I think corn and olives would be good in here and maybe mushroom?

Made this dip with a few additions. I added about 2/3 cup of chicken broth to the chicken and taco packet mixture before adding the rest of the ingredients. It helped with breaking down the cheese and getting the taco seasoning well mixed. I also added a can of whole kernel sweet corn at the same time that I added the black beans for some added flavor. Another tip is to spray slow cooker with nonstick spray for easier clean up. Great recipe

This was so wonderful! I am not a huge fan of Velveeta so instead of using a whole pound I used a half pound and a small bag  (2 cups?) of shredded Mexican cheese blend. Maybe because of this change it seemed pretty thick, so I added in the rest of the sour cream I had and made it a little creamier. So I used a total of 1 cup of sour cream. Really great dip! Thanks!

Fyi: if you don't have Velveeta on hand, use a jar of queso dip. Just as good and less salty. Love this recipe and so did my family and friends .

So, I didn't actually taste this. I made it for my boyfriends 50th birthday party that I threw, I doubled it, but left out black beans (family choice). I brought it out in the crock pot, thinking I could try it later.... no such luck!! All gone and great reviews from all of our guests! So my review is based on guests thoughts (and recipe requests)!! ;-)

Will definitely make again.  Accidentally grabbed chopped black olives but my son said they were perfect in it. And did add 1/2 block cram cheese and a holf bag of frozen corn.  Yummy!

When you go to grab your crock pot and it's washed and back in your bag, you know you did good.   I doubled the recipe since I could really only find a 2# brick of Velveeta.   Good thing I did.    I used 2.5# of chicken breast boiled and shredded.  The only thing I changed was an accidental omission.  As I was eating an insane amount of this dip, shamelessly shoveling it in my mouth, I was simultaneously recounting the ingredients to the first fan who requested the recipe.  That's when I realized I forgot to add the taco seasoning.   I'm making it next time doing the same.   I hate cumin, so no need to add the taco seasoning.  It's so good I ate more when I got home (always save some for yourself at home), using carrot sticks to scoop it up.   Also I did as others said and added the black beans at the beginning or else I surely would have forgotten those, too.   And they're definitely a great part of the recipe.

I used rotisserie chicken and added a can of corn then cooked this on the stove for a quick meal. It was great! I'll be making this again.

Excellent!  I made the recipe as directed.  I used rotisserie chicken (easy peezy).  Next time, I will add a little more fresh minced jalape√±os for a little more of a kick.

This is wonderful in a crock pot with an assortment of dipping choices.  I found using half  the Velveeta and subbing in cotija or queso fresco or even a smoked cheddar is a great addition.  We also like to add corn for a bit more crunch and comfort food feel.  I get many requests for this dish at parties.  It's a great one to play with various substitutions to change it up.

I made this for a party last night and it was a huge hit! The only changes I made were to add a half a block of cream cheese (about four ounces) and I certainly needed milk to thin it out. I used one fresh jalapeno and used the hot Rotel. It had a little kick but wasn't too bad for anyone to handle. Will definitely be making this one again!

I've made this a number  of times now. Each time I made it just as the recipe lists. Great recipe!!  I'll make it again for sure. Great for parties. I've also made it on the stove if you need to make it quicker than then in the slow cooker it turned out great on the stove as well. Done in 20 minutes over medium heat

Oh my gosh!  Is there a SIX STAR RATING?  This is soooo good!  My husband loved it too.  I am an older cook who rarely uses "shortcut" recipes, but I am so glad I found this one.  I initially made a half recipe and we ate it up in no time flat!  I did not have chicken, so I used 3/4 lb ground beef + 1/4 lb breakfast sausage, browned.  I used RoTel's HOT diced tomatoes, which were actually almost too hot for me, but hubby loved them (I toned mine down with extra sour cream).  This recipe is a keeper and I have made it TWICE since the first time!  YUM!

This is good, but not really our thing. Maybe a good dip for a party if you're tired of the traditional rotel dip, or need to use up some chicken.

After following the recipe and tasting I added some hot sauce which helped dampen the taste of the mayo.  The mayo richness, however still dominated too much for me.  I found a recipe that used no mayo which I like more.  Mostly recipes from Allrecipes.com are fabulous, so I see this as a glitch or just personal preference.

This was amazing!!!  I made it for a food day at work and had 4 people ask me for the recipe!!  The only thing I did differently was add a block of cream cheese and left out the jalepenos since not everybdy likes spicy food.  I kept it in my mini crock pot on warm and it was perfect.  This one is a keeper :)

Made this for superbowl 2017. I made it very similar to recipe- I added beans at beginning and I added about a cup or corn (it was in fridge and needed to put it in something). I used regular velveeta and 1/2 can jalapeno  (2oz). It was delicious, I made it into burritos with the leftovers- I added rice and some extra black beans. I will definitely make it again.

This was very  good! I did use cream cheese, sour cream, and a blended Mexican shredded  cheese. Trying to quit using process  foods like the cheese suggested. Thanks Sarah Jo for suggesting the Taco Seasoning recipe, it was great. I'll definitely make this more and also try different meats.

Common ingredients and easy to make.  A different spin on a nacho dip with the chicken.  I think next time, I would increase the amount of taco seasoning and add a few more ingredients...black olives, green peppers, and more chicken.

I doubled this recipe using about 3 1/2 lbs chicken breasts, 1/2 c. onion sauteed until translucent,  one recipe of Taco Seasoning I from this site (mixed into shredded chicken before adding the rest of the ingredients), one 2 lb Mexican Velveeta, 2/3 c. sour cream, 1 can drained and rinsed black beans, and one can (drained not rinsed) hot chili beans.  It was a little bland at first, but the longer it heated, the spices came out.  Very good.  Even better was when I put it in soft shell burrito shells.  I sprayed a 9x13 glass pan, and put some of the chicken mixture in each soft shell and rolled it up.  Sprayed the top of the burrito shells with cooking spray and baked at 350 degrees for 15-20 min.  Amazing!!!

This was good. I went with the roll in tortillas option and made enchiladas with it. I didn't cook anything first and just let it cook in the oven. I did use thighs instead of breast as that is what I had on hand, and I threw a bit of crumbled chorizo in it too. Nice solid meal. UPDATE: this does not make good leftovers if rolled in tortillas. The dip is too liquidy and I ended up with soggy tortillas - gross. Next time ill only make what I need.

Made for a football game party.  First time I made it.  Didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used 2 cans of chicken (drained and shredded).  I also used Velvetta Queso cheese which was based on other suggestions.   I also omitted the jalape√±o just this time.  I prepared in a crock pot (using a Reynolds Crock Pot bag for easy cleaning) and left on warm for the party (about 6 hours).   All the women asked for the recipe.  Very easy to make!  A winner!

This was tasty, it was eaten, but it wasn't my favorite. It was thick. I forgot to save some of the tomato juice for thinning, as some reviewers suggested, so if I make it again I will definitely do that. Nice to make something different, but I have a queso recipe (Torchy's copycat) that I prefer to this. Love to try new recipes though! Thanks for the recipe.

Definitely a keeper!  Loved this recipe and so did the entire household!  No changes really needed to improve but may change it up next time by adding sausage instead of chicken and leaving out the beans.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

I used Queso Blanco Velveeta, Original Rotel, no beans, and saut√©ed yellow onion with chicken. Turned out very good. Will definitely make again!

Delish. Omitted the jalape√±os, but followed recipe in every other way. Amount of chicken & beans can be varied based on what you've got handy. Family LOVED it!

We love this recipe!  If you like a warmer cheese dip, we have added chopped chili's to this recipe and it adds great flavor and a little heat.  It's great for a game night and can also be great for dinner!

This is delicious and very hearty - we actually had it for our meal with French bread and corn chip scoops.  It was very thick so I ended up adding 8 oz.  of Monterey jack cheese and probably about 3/4 cup sour cream total. I also added 20 oz. of Rotel  and a small can of sliced black olives. I also made it in a pot on top of the stove on low and it turned out perfectly.  I will absolutely make this again.

Loved it and the toddlers ate it up. Substituted 1/2 cream cheese with the velveeta. Next time, more spice and maybe more onion.

Made it and doubled the recipe, it was too salty. I think it was because I did 2T of taco seasoning and should have done a no salt taco seasoning due to the saltiness of the cheese. I used the leftovers though to make the seven layer taco dip to delute the saltiness and that worked to not have to throw it away and waste money.

I'm not a fan of Velveeta, but decided to try this anyway. If you like Velveeta, you'll probably love it. I think next time I make it I'll try making it with part real cheese of some sort. I did throw cilantro in the mix and we loved the additional flavor. Used rotisserie chicken for ease.

Made this for bunko and everyone loved it!  I did not use Velveeta, but instead went with a block of cheddar cheese that I cut into chunks.  It melted just fine.  I did not add the jalape√±o pepper and wish I had because the dip didn't have the "punch" I thought it would have.  Still great, though, and will definitely make again.

My husband and I loved this.  We didn't add the beans because we didn't have any, but was amazing!  We are served over tortilla chips (messy nachos).  I plan on heating leftovers in a wrap tomorrow for lunch.  Should be just as good!

This was incredibly amazing with very minor tweaks! The only things I changed were I cut the amount of chicken in half and I added the black beans in the beginning. This certainly didn't disappoint, I can't wait to make it again soon!

I omitted the black beans and used chickpeas as I thought it looked better aesthetically and it was amazing!

This is one of the best dips I have ever eaten. It is so good you could eat it for lunch. It is so simple to make. I did omit the onion because my daughter in law does not care for them.

Amazing! I did change it a little based on other recipes. I put in 1/2 pound velveeta and 1/2 shredded mixed cheddar cheese instead of all velveeta. I didn't have ROTEL, so i put half a can of tomatoes and half a can of green chiles. I put about 1 tablespoon of canned jalepenos. i didn't have green onion so i just used a chopped sweet onion. Then I wrapped them up in tortillas, put them in a foiled & greased pan. poured green enchilada sauce on top and sprinkled cheese on them, covered it with foil, and cooked it for 40 minutes at 350 degrees. IT WAS DELICIOUS. I had the jumbo tortillas, so it made 5 enchiladas, and with one jumbo enchilada as a serving it was about 4 servings (leaving one enchilada for buffer).

I took this to work for a potluck and by the end of the day there wasn't a drop left and everyone was saying how much they liked it.  I wasn't crazy about the texture and it seemed too thick after following the directions so I another pound of cheese, 1/2 cup milk, and doubled the jalapeno and taco seasoning.

This dip is a huge hit with my family and friends!! I marinade 1-2 sliced chicken breasts in Kraft Zesty Lime Dressing overnight. I place the chicken in the crockpot and add about a half pack of chicken taco seasoning and let it cook on low for a few hours. I drain the juice off and shred the chicken. Then I add the rest of the ingredients as the recipe calls for with a few minor tweaks. I use the queso block of cheese instead of plain velveeta. I have substituted regular black beans with the ones that contain jalape√±os for some extra spice! I serve with On The Border Tortilla Chips and the pot is gone bye bye!!! Yum!!!!

Oh yum!  This was absolutely delicious!  This recipe was delicious alone served as a dip or used as a main dish to a nacho salad.  I pretty much went by the recipe but added a few additional ingredients based on our tastes.  I subtracted from the processed cheese by about 4 oz. and replaced it with some cream cheese.  Also I thought this needed some garlic, so I added in 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I loved the addition of black beans in this and I like to pair black beans with corn.  So I added in about a cup of corn as well.  I didn't have time to put in the crockpot.  So I slowly melted this on the stovetop.  Delicious!  I loved the kick that this had with the taco seasoning and jalapenos.  I used this in a big nacho salad layered with tortilla chips, refried beans, the chicken cheese sauce, more shredded cheese, lettuce, tomato, sour cream, salsa, and cilantro.  So good!  Thank you for the recipe!

Great recipe. I made this tonight for my brother in laws 50th birthday. Very easy to put together and it was a hit. Personally I feel this would go well with tortillas on taco night. I served this with tortilla chips for the party. The only change I made was putting the beans in at the beginning as I preferred for the beans to soak in the flavor of the seasonings earlier in the cooking process. I will definitely make this again.

Amazingly easy and delicious. My only change was to substitute half of the cheese with cheddar, and one time I substituted boneless thigh meat for breast meat. Friends and relatives love it. I use Echols taco seasoning, as suggested by some other cooks. It has become my favorite for other dishes, too.

One major change needs to be made to this recipe. It needs to be doubled, at least! You won't mind having leftovers. Seriously this stuff is well... Outrageous! I've made this several times and it never goes to waste. And it's even better the next day! The only thing I changed was using pinto beans because my boyfriend doesn't like black beans but other than that it's perfect as written!

this dip is amazing. I will be honest, it doesnt look pretty, but the taste is phenomenal. I cheated and used a 12oz can of shredded chicken, and since we arent into spice we left out the jalapenos.  YUMMY

This is a tried and true favorite for our family gatherings.  I pair it  with a Rachel Ray turkey chili recipe and the dip  makes for the perfect appetizer or side by side go to.  Why?  Both recipes are in the crockpot.  Found a smaller vintage crock for the dip and it works beautifully.  The best part-leftovers!!!!!!!

I made this for my potluck, had to double the recipe of course, but they killed it. I made a big crock-pot of it and it was gone by the time the meeting was over, which was about an hour long! Only thing I changed was the beans because I don't like them, and I know a lot of people I work with don't either.

This was so tasty! I used pickled jalapenos from the jar, added a can of southwestern corn and a little extra sour cream. I also replaced the fresh green onion with minced onion since the hubby is not a fan of fresh onion. Big hit at Super Bowl and making it again for a game night.

So easy and delicious!!  Why didn't I think of this!  I was looking for a chicken slow-cooker meal to put in so it would be ready after church.  This recipe was a great choice b/c it's easy and versatile.  I did not follow the recipe exactly, but it still came out delicious.  I used chicken breast fillets, uncooked.  I used canned cheese from Australia, which is similar to Velveeta, but a but drier (and it's real cheese).  I also used chicken stock, regular canned tomatoes, added canned corn, and some Mexican spices and salsa.  I topped with chopped green onions and cilantro.  Served with corn chips.
So good.  Will make again!

This was fantastic! I subbed black olives for black beans (husband doesn't like) and used 2 breasts from a rotisserie chicken.  I used Velveeta queso blanco instead of the original. Yes, please! Will put in the rotation for appetizers at parties and our weekly Family Friday meal.  You will love this!

Doubled it, used Velveeta queso .  Great as a dip the first night, then used it for burrito filling the next night. May put it over nachos next time.

Great dip recipe!  I made last weekend over Super Bowl weekend and it turned out great!  I only had 1/2 amount of Velveeta and a cube of spicy jalape√±o queso cheese, it worked out great!  I totally forgot sour cream, but no one missed it.   I also skipped green onions for personal preference.  My own adds to recipe, an additional can of chopped green chilies and a small can of sweet corn.  For those it was a little too spicy for, they just added a dollop of sour cream on the side.  Very addicting and we will make again!

This was good. If it heated with lid on to long it went very watery. 
The family all agreed they preferred the good old can of chili with Velveeta better.  Lucky me! Less work.

I followed the recipe---it was too thick, had to thin with a little chicken broth.  Don't know if it was the taco seasoning or what, but we aren't fans.

OMG!! This was a huge hit and went way too quick gone before half time with only 15 people.  I would suggest doubling up. I also added fire roasted green peppers.

I made this for a party and it was a HUGE hit.  My adjustments were as follows - I did not add the jalapenos and I doubled the rotel.  I literally put all of the ingredients in the crockpot - unstirred(sp?) and in about 2 hours stirred it.  After tasting, I added more sour cream - it was a little too salty (might have been the home made taco seasoning) and then added the black beans.  Had to print out the recipe for all!

Made this for a family Christmas party yesterday. It was a hit! Added a little more taco seasoning to give it a little extra punch and it was awesome! Made it with American Cheese and it was nicely and cheesy. Bought a 1 lb package of unwrapped slices and just cut the block into cubes. This is a keeper!

Terrific recipe, it was a big hit at a party I took it to recently. I ended up doubling the batch still using only 2 chicken breasts. Also forgot to add the taco seasoning and it still tasted great, so to me that's optional. Used the entire jalapeno pepper and served with Hint of Lime Doritos. Yum!

I added the beans as a layer after half the  cheese and can of tomatoes and jalape√±os .     I mixed the taco seasoning with the sour cream and spread that on the shredded chicken last layer was the remaining cheese and green  onions.  Let that cook on low for an hour before stirring. It came out absolutely wonderful. I was looking for an alternative to the chicken wing dip that we love  - this is it.

Wonderful recipe! You can use your imagination to modify recipe to what your family/friends enjoy. I have done both followed the recipe exactly and then adjusted by adding a little more of this or a little less of that! Go LSU!!!!

This was outrageous! Kids couldn't get enough of it and my husband stuffed himself. Tasted too good so it can't possibly be healthy but great recipe nonetheless. I made it as directed but substituted half the chicken for some leftover chicken fajitas filling I'd made from a few nights before.

We loved this! We do not like black beans, so I used pinto. I would add lime, cilantro and more jalape√±o  the next time I make it. We really enjoy it, but want more zing and kick the next time.

Made this dip last night for a get together.  I followed the recipe as is and my husband and I both loved it.  I personally think next time I will add more black beans and possible some corn.

I made 1/2 of the recipe and served it with tortilla chips.  I'm not a huge fan of processed cheese, used Mexican Velvetta, but I made it for my husband and he liked it.

I used 1/2 velveeta and 1/2 sharp cheddar. Don't drain your tomato juice so it's not so thick. Great recipe!

Took this for a potluck at work and people were scraping the crock pot.  Be sure to chop the onion very fine.  I cooked the onion with the chicken and got really good flavor from it.  
UPDATE: Made it once without beans and it was good, too.

This was wonderful!! Fantastic for company. Next time I will use both jalapenos, I was afraid to overpower it. I bought some already shredded fajita style chicken and threw it in there. Only thing is that I put at least another half lb of cheese in, made it super gooey! It was a big hit and heated up great for leftovers.

This is great football food. As other reviewers suggested, I supplemented some of the cheese with real cheddar- otherwise, it tastes too processed. I'd also throw some extra diced green chilies in there. Yum!

Instead of Velveeta I used 2 cups of shredded pepper jack cheese. Also added about a half a cup of spicy salsa and instead of putting in the slow cooker I just put it on the stove and simmered it for about an hour and a half. Made the dip a day ahead and stored in fridge . About an hour before serving I let it come to room temp then scooped into a large bread bowl. Put in pre-heated 400 degree oven for about 20 min

Fantastic!  Always the bowel is left clean when I bring it to a work party.  So easy and delicious.  Will not let you down.  Instead of jalape√±o peppers I add cayenne pepper to the desired level of heat.  Enjoy!
Can also used ground turkey.

I made this yesterday. I did about 1/2 velveeta and added 1block of cream cheese and shredded Mexican cheese blend. I cooked the chicken breasts with a little of the taco seasoning (used low sodium blend). Since I added extra cheese, I added a 3rd shredded chicken breast and about 1/2 cup of medium salsa. I brought it to a work meeting and it was a hit.
I'm planning in using the leftover tonight - either just over rice or adding more chicken and baking in dough.

I loved this! Took it to class for dinner and everyone there loved it. Brought the left overs home and my husband devoured it. I am not a spicy food lover. I did not realize I bought spicy Ro-tel tomatoes which are quite spicy. Next time I will try the mild kind. Every time I make this dish, someone is asking for the recipe. I always add a can of black beans which adds fiber. Make sure you rinse them or your dip will be an odd color. I have made this with chicken, turkey and ground beef, the chicken is my favorite. Nice chicken dish.

I liked the taste of this, but not for nachos.  My husband didn't like it at all.  I think it might be good in a quesadilla or burrito.  Would have liked it better without the chicken.

So good! Took this to a Christmas party with some tortilla chips. It traveled well in my small crock pot and I just plugged it in when we got there. People spooned it into small bowls that I brought or just spooned it directly on their chips for nachos!

I made this last night for a poker party and it was a huge hit. I made it more or less exactly as the recipe stated (I didn't really measure the green onions out, etc) and the flavor was great. It's close to some of the other Velveeta/Rotel dips I've had, but the chicken, black beans, and some of the seasonings just made it different enough to be interesting.
The only problem I ran into with it was that it was really runny and didn't thicken up. I've never seen that in a Velveeta dip before. Maybe I didn't get the peppers, beans, or Rotel drained well enough. I might try adding in a small amount of refried beans next time as well, just to act as a thickening agent.

I've made this twice already and have gotten great reviews.  Each time I've been asked for the recipe. It's a dish that disappears quickly!

I love this recipe! I cheated and used some canned ingredients, but it turned out wonderful and was completely gone before half-time!

This was really good, I forgot to drain the tomatoes and it was a little watery, but I just added shredded cheese.  Yummy

This was pretty good, however, had I used the entire block of Velveeta (as the recipe calls for), my rating wouldn't have been as generous. It would've been entirely too salty...and this is coming from someone who adds salt to salad and pizza! I only used 8 oz Velveeta and added an eyeballed amount of shredded sharp cheddar. I also used 4 oz reduced-fat cream cheese. In addition, I used 1lb boneless, skinless thighs and homemade taco seasoning (more than the recipe stated to compensate for the added chicken). Since I didn't have green onions, I sauteed a small white onion and added that to the mix. Since my 3 year-old was eating this too, I left out the jalapenos, and because my husband doesn't care for black beans, I subbed pintos instead. Overall, this was a filling dip on its own, served with Tostitos scoops. Next time I make it, I'll make a spicier, adult version and would use medium-hot roasted chiles in place of jalapenos.

Very good! I also used it as an enchilada filling for tortillas and enchilada sauce. Used 8 oz of Velveeta and 4 oz of cheddar cheese. Forgot to buy the jalepenos and it was still good.

This was delicious, made it exactly as recipe stated.  I used it in tortillas and dipping.  This was so good I ate almost the whole pot myself, this was not a good idea!

What a great dip. The only modification I made was to skip the green onion (didn't have one) and the jalapeno pepper. I'm not a spicy food lover and the chilis in the diced tomato cans gave the dip plenty of kick for me. My guests loved it, too. And it was just as good reheated for the next few days.

excellent taste.  didnt add the jalapenos cos the kids were eating with us, and it was still too spicy for them.  used half velveeta and half sharp cheddar cheese.  for the taco seasoning mix, i used taco seasoning I by bill echols from this site (minus the hot pepper flakes).  this is great with the black beans.  we actually ate it as a meal  :)

This was the most amazing dip!  I made a double batch to take to a cookout and there was none left!  The only thing I didn't do was add the jalapeno because I forgot to buy it but it was perfect just the way it was.

This is the first time I've made nacho dip with chicken and I really liked it. It tasted very similar to my other recipes, which is spicier from the sausage. I would probably still make that one first, but this one seems good for those chicken lovers, and I also liked the addition of the black beans and jalapenos. I am a person who generally likes to make things from scratch and never from jars, frozen, etc.  However, it was so tedious tearing the chicken, and I felt that the taste could've been achieved exactly the same with pre-shredded chicken.  I will do this next time.  Very good recipe; will use again.

This dip was an excellent variation from the traditional Rotel!  The only thing I changed was to leave out the black beans just for personal preference.  I put everything together the night before, heated in the microwave (stirring every 2 or 3 minutes), then transferred to the slow cooker to keep it warm for serving.  Definitely recommended!

MAKE IN THE MICROWAVE!  I made mine with canned white chicken breast, and salsa instead of canned tomatoes.  The black beans gave it a nice texture...really excellent.  I usually don't like such fattening things, but for a sports weekend- perfect!!!

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday.  Sad that my Colts lost but the dip was a big WINNER!!    I used canned chicken and it was great.  Next time I think I will add a can of No Bean Chili.  There will be lots of this dip in our future!

SO many compliments at a Superbowl Party!  I only used ONE large chicken breast half purchased from the meat case, not the little frozen breasts from a bag.  I also added a small can of black olives and added the beans at the beginning as others had suggested. Cooked on high 1/2 hour, stirred up, and cooked on high another 1/2 hour and it was done!

This was a huge hit with the super bowl crowd. It will become a regular part of all the parties I throw from now on. I followed the recipe exactly except I pre-seasond the chicken before cooking with chili powder, cumin, onion powder and salt and pepper. I browned it in a tablespoon of oil before shredding, delicious.

Yummy!  I did 1/2 velveeta, 1/2 block of lofat cream cheese, & some shredded mexi cheese blend.  Wish I'd tried it before Christmas, because with the Rotel and green onions, it looks very festive!  I agree w/the reviewer who mentioned it would be great as an enchilada filler.  It's just darn good - period!

This recipe was very good, but a bit spicy with the jalapenos.  I think it would also taste very good with ground beef to replace the chicken.

this was SOOOO good!!! it was a little runny but i think that's because i didn't drain the tomatoes all the way. besides that i was very impressed. i didn't use jalapenos because my husband hates spicy, so i just doubled on the chile peppers to give it a little zing without the heat.

This is really delish, I make it for football and holiday party's and it is always a hit. I don't always add the beans it is good either way.

This was a excellent dip that you just can't stop eating.I made for my girlfriends and 17yrs old son who is very picky. Everyone loved it, loved it some much that my son ask me to make again the next day. I did we were left with small bowl that was good cold. will keep for sure.
