I'm afraid I wasn't true to the Lawry's brand name, instead making my own garlic salt & pepper, but this was a tasty addition to our salad tonight nonetheless. This was also super easy to do. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't feel like cutting up my chicken so I kept it whole. I also added 1 tsp. seasoned salt to the recipe. When the chicken was done, I took the pan drippings and made gravy with it. Everything was very good! I'll definitely  make this one again!

I really liked this.  I did not have the exact seasonings, but I had very similar items.  One big change I made was to pour the marinade out before baking it.  The chicken was very tender.  Almost forgot, I added worcestershire
