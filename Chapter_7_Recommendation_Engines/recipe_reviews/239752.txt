Loved this..only change I made was to add a slice of cheese to the bread and then adding the egg mixture on top.  Delicious and I'll definitely made this again!

What? How can you call it creole without "seasoning"?   At minimum Tabasco is the missing ingredient.

Always looking for tasty ways to add a little more vegetables with my breakfast I decided to give this a try. I was tempted to add a little salt and pepper to this expecting it to be a little bland but the capers added the perfect amount of saltiness to this dish. The capers along with the vegetables gave these eggs the perfect balance of flavors. I opted to eat the eggs without the toast...just a personal preference. Thanks for the tasty meal that would be good any time of day.

Itâ€™s a good breakfast. The only thing I changed was I added a slice of provolone cheese on the top to hold the eggs onto the toast. I liked it.

I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed, and added some salt while sauteeing vegetables. Turned out great.

I think I may have gone wrong with crushed tomatoes. I actually bought a can of crushed tomatoes. Obviously that wasn't right according to the picture. The finished product was tasted good but no visual appeal. I still try again with fresh diced tomatoes like picture.  I also added salt,  pepper, & cayenne. How can you say creole without some seasoning.
