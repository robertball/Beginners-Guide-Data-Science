A huge hit with kids and adults!.  Took the advice of previous reviews and cut the butter to 1/3 cup and added a pinch of salt to the crust mixture. Baked first and then after adding the marshmallows and chocolate chips put it under low broil for a few minutes, watching it the whole time and removed when the marshmallows turned to a golden brown.  Super easy, quick dessert enjoyed by all!!

I made these with homemade graham crackers and I didn't make a crust at all. I just took the squares, put on the marshmallows and the chocolate chips, put them in the toaster an broil for 8 mins,m and they came out perfect and delicious!

I made these today with my 3.5 year old son. It was simple & delish.... I only used 1/3 cup of butter, put a whole sleeve of graham crackers in the food processor & used Pam cooking spray in my pan instead of the foil. Also for the last 2.5 minutes I put it under the broiler but, Everything else I did the same including the cooling times & had absolutely no issues at all. I will definitely make these again!

Really easy, really good!!!... I only used 1/3 of a cup of butter as I read the other reviews said the bars were very buttery, it worked great. I mixed the chocolate, half of semi-sweet and the other half was milk chocolate because that was what I had in hand. I ended up using the broiler to melt and toast the marshmallow and chocolate. We enjoyed them!!!

These are rich and really taste like s'mores. I used milk chocolate chips which kept them true to the campfire classic, but they are very sweet.  I don't mind it because that's what you expect from a good s'more.  Just have a glass of milk handy, and cut in small squares.  Mine also didn't brown at the normal temp - I was using my convection/toaster oven so I set it to toast to get the brown on the mallows and that did the trick.  

And a note if it's helpful to anyone - 9 graham cracker sheets was the right amount for me, not squares.  I always get confused about which a recipe means.  This took a full sleeve of graham crackers for the crust.  I pulsed up the crust in the food processor and microwaved the butter to melt it, and it took no time at all.  The only thing I might change next time is I would try dark chocolate chips and maybe a light sprinkle of sea salt, and I'd reduce the butter slightly. I don't think it needs quite as much as it takes.

These are rich! However, for a dessert I don't think that can be a valid complaint. If I made them again.. I would maybe add more marshmallows and less chocolate chips. Yes.. the bottom is buttery, so I might try a little less. I wouldn't want them sticking to the foil. I tried baking them longer at the end, but still didn't brown. I used broiler at the end like other reviews before myself. A great bar that I would make again!

These were ok  for what they are.  The crust could have some improvement on flavor and texture.  Baking time is off for the top to brown.  I ended up broiling until marshmallows were golden.

These are super easy and super sweet.  I used semisweet chips.  Maybe next time I will decrease the brown sugar by 1/2.

These are quite buttery. I had some trouble getting the marshmallows to brown so I switched to using the broiler. Next time I'd use the broiler for all of step 5.
