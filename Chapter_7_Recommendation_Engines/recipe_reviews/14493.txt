Not very good.  I agree with another review that the tomatoes don't go well at all with this.  Also, the ingredients need to marinate before skewering, just not enough flavor.  
If you're looking for a good pineapple/mushroom skewer meal, try the Chicken and Bacon Shish Kabobs

it's good. but instead of threading the bacon separately, i just wrapped the shrimp with it then skewered it.. i also changed the cherry tomatoes with onion wedges.. it goes better with the sweet and sour sauce..

You might want to pan fry the bacon slightly before putting it on the skewer.

I made a double batch and this took me forever to make up the kabobs.  I did it the night before which was very nice.  I pre cooked the bacon....it would have been mushy otherwise.  This was an ok recipe but a lot of time is needed to throw this together.

I made two batches of shrimp, one as your recipe said and another due to the shrimp burned before the bacon and tomatoes were done. The second batch I fried the bacon slightly, didn't use tomatoes, and grilled on medium heat and it turned out great.

Very tasty. The ingredients all blend really well together and this was a great and easy shrimp recipe that seems like it takes a lot more effort than it does.

This is an excellent recipe that I have used for years when entertaining. I do use precooked bacon that I buy at Costco for perfect results. If you use raw, it takes too long to cook the bacon while the other ingredients become overcooked. Try this, your guests will gobble it up!

4 1/2 stars. It is easy, but peeling and deveining the shrimp is time consuming. I did try it with onion slices but they need to cook a LOT longer so I should have started that earlier. In fact it's better to have the vegetables on separate skewers because they take way longer and you don't want the shrimp tough. I didn't have bacon. I cut pineapple rings because that is what I had. I would try this again and tweak it a bit.

I cooked this exactly how the recipe said to and it turned out great.  The only thing is that the recipe needs more mushrooms.  I ran out of caps before I ran out of the other vegitables.

This taste great!! Although it was not what I expected, it still came out good. I only made the sauce potion of this recipe, because I do not care for the vegetables. Thank you very much!!

I went the cast iron pan route. I added a little green onion, TJ's Island Soyaki and cornstarch for thickening. OK, I added a little fresh parsley and toasted sesame seeds to the finished product. My bed was grits with a splash of milk and a dash of butter. I was starving when the meal was finished, so all that was left to take a picture of is the shrimp, veg & sauce.

didn't like the tomatoes on the grill,and the bacon had a hard time cooking, i agree need to cook bacon separately.
