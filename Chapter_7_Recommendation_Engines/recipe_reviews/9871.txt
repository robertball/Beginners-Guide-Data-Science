Maybe I did something wrong. The caramel sauce I used (made for ice cream) seemed overly sweet. There seemed to be too many pecans also, but that is just my preference. The worst problem was that after a day the ritz crackers took up moisture from the caramel sauce (which never hardened and was always gooey), so they were no longer nice and crisp. My friend made these a few years ago and I thought they were great. She must have used different ingredients!

These cookies taste great...but I had to make a few revisions. The carametl never seemed to set all the way and when I tried to use the tongs to dip the crackers in the chocolate, it was a big mess! Instead, what I did was just spoon the chocolate over the caramel on the top. I think it worked out perfect that way because then the chocolate hardened over the caramel. No more messy caramel! I think it was a lot easier and less messy than using tongs! Everyone loved these!

These cookies definitely grew on me.  I halved the recipe & it made about 25 cookies.  I didn't like how long it took to make these.  And, I tried to be very careful to not make a mess.  They are very tasty though, with the salt from the crackers & the pecans mixed with the sweet choclate & caramel---yum!  I'll probably make these only when I want something kind of special, for a party, good finger food--but kind of sticky around the edges.

I am part of a cookie exchange each Christmas season and I made these in 1999.
They were a huge success!

This recipe is easy and the cookie is great.  Has just enough saltiness as to not be too sweet.  Instead of using tongs to dip the cookies, I just picked them up as they were cook enough to handle.  Drizziling a little bit over the top would help with the "stickiness" of the pecan carmel.  But, all in all they were a huge success and will remain on my favorite list.
