I made this last night and was very disappointed, unfortunately. The sugar ruined the whole dish in my (and my family's) opinion. In fact, my sister and I sampled the potatoes before I added any ingredients (just the boiled potatoes, to which I added salt) and we thought they were delicious. Once I added the rest of the ingredients I regretted it. I would make them again with 2X the liquid, using milk instead of half and half, and not quite so much butter and omit the sugar completely. Gotta give props to the rest of your dinner menu, though. I made the meatloaf and green beans - they were a hit! I think I will adopt the meatloaf recipe as my own. I hate meatloaf (unfortunately I'm the only one in my family) and this one was devoured by everyone including me! The Peach cobbler didn't turn out - but then again, baking has never been my fort√®.

Oh my gosh! these were amazing!  The best mashed potatoes i have ever had.  I just made a few changes because some things i didn't have. I did not use any sugar because I am not big on sweet. While boiling I used 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1 tsp of garlic salt.  I also added a pinch of salt and pinch of ground pepper.  Then when i was mashing  the potatoes i added 2 tsp of garlic salt, 1 tsp of garlic powder, and 1 tsp of the steak seasonings. Then to make it pretty I added a few shakes of parsley.   I made gravy with these and they didn't even need it at all!  If you like your potatoes very flavorful this is the way to go. My picky roommates DEVOURED them.  Thanks for the awesome idea :)

To make it a little easire, i crush several cloves of garlic and add to the cooking water with the potatoes..when done, drain and mash all together...the garlic will be tender & sweet and it's all right there...Also, I heat the butter and cream some before adding to the mashed potatoes.

I love these potatoes!  Only changes...I omit the sugar add 2 tsp garlic to the potatoes/cooking water, and then also GENTLY warm my half and half with 2 additional tsp minced garlic before adding it to the potato mixture. This is one of those recipes I make over and over again!

I love garlic and these were delish! I forgot to dice the potatoes before cooking (didn't matter in the end), I also added all of the crushed garlic to the boiling water to make it easier to mash with the potatoes. I didn't add the sugar but did add a bit of salt and used milk instead of the cream. No need for gravy for these spuds!

Absolutely awesome. Made the recipe exactly as stated, except I used heavy cream instead of half and half, and I omitted the sugar. Phenomenal!

I have tried several recipes for mashed potatoes from this site and they all came out kind of bland.  These are PHENOMENAL!! I followed the advice of another reviewer and added 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder and 1/8 tsp of black pepper to the water when the potatoes were boiling.  While  mashing the potatoes, I added 2tsp garlic powder, 2 tsp onion powder, 2tsp steak seasoning and 1/2 tsp parsley.  Oh, yeah, left out the sugar, and mashed the potatoes with a fork instead because my husband and I like them kind of chunky.  I also left the skins on.

Since I saw the reviews that said this was a little sweet I reduced the sugar by half.  I also added more garlic.  We really liked this.  I don't think this will be our "all the time" recipe, but it is good for a change.  Thanks for the post.

Excellent.  Measured butter and seasonings to taste and eliminated the (unnecessay and distracting) sugar altogether. Just used a hand masher rather than an electric mixer.  Adding more ingredients and using more gadgets doesn't necessarily make it better, as evidenced in this case. Really delicious mashed potatoes; a fine contribution to my "Homemade TV Dinner," along with "Hamburger Steak with Onions and Gravy," recipes also from this site.

These are the best homemade mashed potatoes I've ever had. Served these during Christmas dinner and people could not stop with the seconds, thirds, fourths! Changes I made are adding 2 smashed cloves of garlic in the boiling water and then mashing it with the potatoes afterward, using milk instead of half and half, omitting the sugar, adding 1 teaspoon of steak seasoning, and 1 teaspoon of garlic powder. I also kept the skins on, and just mashed it for a chunky mash. Delicious, restaurant like mashed potatoes!

Wish I would've read the reviews before I made these.  The sugar ruins the recipe.  I think they would've been great if I had left it out.  Also had to add more cream.

I made these last night when I cooked for my boyfriend's parents for the first time. Left out the sugar and made sure to add garlic to the potato water. They were wonderful. His mother went back for seconds -- she doesn't do that with her own potatoes!!

It was my first time making these. There was two of us-I used 6 red potatoes (we like leftovers), cut them in half, boiled them until tender w/a fork. I also put 3 cut-up garlic cloves, salt and pepper in the water. I drained them then used the potato masher to mash them before using the mixer. In the bowl I put in butter, skim milk, 2 tsp garlic salt, 1 tsp garlic powder, pepper, and  1tsp montreal steak seasoning. I mixed together until finished. Next time I'll use only 1 tsp garlic salt as it was a little salty. I never tried using the sugar since reading the reviews. I'll for sure make this again.

Love these taters!! Followed the recipe with the exception of the steak seasoning and garlic powder. I did boil the potatoes with 3 cloves of garlic. I also added black pepper at the end. These will accompany so many things on our table.  We really liked the sugar sweetened flavor. 
Mashed potato heaven :)

The only thing I am complaining about in this recipe is the raw garlic.  I don't mind raw garlic I just didn't care  for it in potatoes.  My younger kid wouldn't eat them after one bite, but that was understandable.  Anyway, great potatoes other than that!

Very good, did not add the sugar or the garlic powder but added extra garlic cloves to the water.  Also only used 1/4 of butter, and skim milk instead of half and half.  I would make these again.

I used a hand masher. I omitted the sugar. I only had 5/6 potatoes so I used half the butter and half the cream that is suggested here. My daughter who has never liked mashed potatoes, ate these right up! I think these will become a regular dish here!

I have been making mashed potatoes all my life for a large German family. These are the best ever!! Just like salt can bring out the flavor in a recipe, sugar does the same here. Be careful to stick to the measurements and you can't go wrong.

I don't understand why folks are reviewing this recipe so highly after omitting the sugar. The sugar is the reason I am rating this poorly, as I did in fact make it as written. The steak seasoning flavor was non existent in my dish, and the garlic/sugar mixed like oil and water. There was no flavor fusion here, just different flavors trying to out do each other. Sadly, this was an epic fail for me.

These were very good!!  I left out the sugar, as other reviewers mentioned doing.  To cut down the calories, I also cut the butter in half and omitted the half-and-half, and used 1/2 cup of plain fat-free yogurt instead (next time I might use 3/4-1 cup of yogurt).  The tangyness of the yogurt worked really well with the garlic in the potatoes.  With these changes, I think these will be my go-to mashed potatoes from now on.  I also didn't have any steak seasoning, so I left that out.

The sugar was just too much. It's not that hard to make simple garlic mashed, but when I saw this recipe and the ratings I assumed it was extra good. The sugar made it way too sweet. Find another recipe or omit the sugar.

dont add sugar..totally unnecessary..everything else great..left potatoes whole..throw garlic in AFTER boiling potatoes just before mashing. steak  seasoning is just about taste. I liked without. try with or without..leave potatoes chunky=rustic..everyone loved them,,1/2 & 1/2 is all about richness..good without... excellent with but hard to tell if added or not

Very Good! If you like your mashed potatoes sweeter, use all the sugar, but only use half if your not a fan of sweet potatoes.:)

Skipped the sugar. Added salt, Parmesan cheese and onion powder and halved the butter. Sooo good. The steak seasoning was a great addition. Will make again and again I am sure!

Used milk and butter, left out the sugar. I didn't think the sugar would add anything postive to the dish.  Used Lawrys instead of steak seasoning as I didn't want chunks of seasoning in the potatoes.  Pretty good.

2 things I learned with this recipe: adding crushed garlic to the boiling water of the potatoes really infuses the flavor perfectly! The other thing I learned is that sugar should never touch mashed potatoes.

I cut out the steak seasoning (because I didn't have it) and the sugar (following the advice of other reviewers). I also used evaporated milk instead of half and half, and it turned out fine. I also used 3 good sized garlic cloves and chopped them up. Put one of the chopped garlic cloves to boil with the potatoes and used  the other two chopped cloves with the mashed potatoes. And since I needed the beaters for beating whipped cream, I mashed my potatoes in a food processor. It stayed a little lumpy, just the way I like it.

Only rated a 4 because I modified the recipe. I omitted the sugar completely and used milk instead of cream because that is what I had on hand. It was DELICIOUS!! The boyfriend loved them and I served them along with "The Best Meatloaf" recipe from this site. It was a fantastic dinner and made for great leftovers! Will definitely make both again.

I know that I really should have read the reviews and I usually do - but the sugar just killed it for me and most of my family but I must admit that a couple of the kids liked them. Personal taste preference applies here.

I made this recipe without reading the reviews. Which I should have. Most reviewers are saying do not add the sugar. Man, were they right. I will make them again, this time sans sugar. Great taste overall but without the sugar and more salt, maybe even a tad more garlic/garlic powder they will get 5 stars!!!

Great recipe, but since we don't enjoy anything sweet with a meal, didn't even consider adding the sugar.  The potatoes were absolutely great without it!  I did however, add a bit more garlic.

Great recipe. I used the heavy cream and left out the sugar, as I found several reviews omiting the sugar.  After doing so, I would agree and will continue to omit the sugar.  It really isnt necessary.

Loved this recipe. I must say, however, I would skip the sugar. In my opinion, as well as the rest of my family, it was better without. The sugar makes the potatoes too sweet. I made this for Christmas dinner last year, and ended up having to make another batch because no one liked the batch with sugar in it.

I thought these potatoes were very good!  As noted by others, I did not add the sugar (seems unnatural and unnecessary!)  I did add 4 cloves of garlic into the pot while cooking the potatoes.  I topped off the serving dish with fresh parsley and the potatoes tasted and looked wonderful!

Really great potatoes and easy, no need for gravy.  I used whole milk instead of cream cause that's what I had and no sugar.

awesome....taste just like the restaurant kind. I left out the sugar, but that was because sugar and mashed potatoes just don't go.  You have to use real butter....makes all the diference.

We made these potatoes with a chicken dish. Thought they would have been a nice side if you were grilling! Good dish, though!

I was really excited to try this recipe and thrilled that so many people had saved it. I'm sure it would have been good, but adding the sugar totally ruined it! I had to save it by adding extra steak seasoning, and still it just tasted really weird. I'm not quite sure why the sugar was added.

This is great!  I didn't add the sugar based on others' reviews and my own preference.  These are the best-- and boiling the potatoes with the garlic is the difference maker.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good, and will make again with some modifications.  I will skip the sugar, and add some salt.  I doubled the garlic because I didn't feel like it was garlicky enough.  Also used milk in place of half and half, and used a little more than 1/4 cup to get the right consistency.

This recipe goes over well here at my house! Everyone loves the potatoes! I used minced garlic once but the kids kept finding it in the potatoes so I now I just put a few slightly chopped pieces of garlic into the water while boiling then remove before I mash them. I season with freshly ground pepper and garlic salt.

I did not like this recipe at all.  I used half of the butter recommended in the recipe and used milk in place of the cream and omitted the sugar as mentioned by others.  Mine turned out very thin and almost sticky.  The flavor was lacking as well.  I'll stick to my baked whipped & mashed potatoes that always seem to be a hit.

These had a nice flavor. I didn't add garlic to potato water, just pressed about 2 teaspoons worth before mashing. Only added about half (a little less than half) the amount of sugar. Added salt. Will be making these again. The flavor is going to vary somewhat, I think,  depending on which brand of steak seasoning you use (I used Famous Dave's).

I'm only giving 3 stars because if you add the sugar it will ruin the dish. There's no need to add 1/2 cup of butter either. I used 1/4 cup and added extra garlic powder. It was a good base recipe. If you don't have half & half you can just use warm milk. It will work just as well. Delicious served with Ina Gardens engagement chicken. It's a must try!

Boiling the garlic with the potatoes was the secret and had seen this on the food show.  These were so creamy and delicious! Gravy Not Necessary : ) We love garlic, so we replaced the garlic powder with (2) roasted cloves and did not add sugar. This will definitely be a side-dish for Thanksgiving!!

I only gave 4 stars because I feel like the sugar measurement is off.  These are very good, but only require 1 tsp sugar.  I also never measure my half and half exactly, just splash in enough until the mixture is creamy.

I cut the root end off a head of garlic, drizzle with olive oil and salt and pepper. Roast in a 320 degree oven for a half hour. Then I squeeze the garlic out of the husks mash good with a fork and add to potatoes with butter salt and pepper and sour cream. That is all you need to know about potatoes. No Sugar

If you leave out the sugar these mashed potatoes will definitely become the best you‚Äôve ever had.  Next time I‚Äôll add more butter & half-and-half to make them a little (more) creamier.

YUM!!!  We loved these potatoes...the only thing we didn't do was add a lot of sugar.  I added a pinchful and I also added a little more cream to make it creamier!  Our family enjoyed it thoroughly!

Easy to make and a nice twist on mashed potatoes. However, I found it a little too sweet. I'll make this recipe again, but I'm definitely going to cut down on the amount of sugar used.

Wow - first reviewer of this recipe so I will try to be kind!  It was really sweet - sort of weird with the garlic...my family politely said it was good, but never reached for seconds.  Oh well, maybe some will find a sweet red mashed potatoes tasty - enjoy!!!!

These were so easy and quick to throw together. My entire family of picky eaters loved it. I didn't put sugar in, it has a slight natural sweetness on it's own. I definitely recommend these to anyone!

Great fluffy garlic mashed potatoes. My only disagreement was with the sugar. Maybe a little more garlic with salt and pepper and NO sugar. Other than that, this is a good recipe.

These were very flavorful and easy to prepare.  I have become lazy and was buying the pre prepared garlic mashed - but I think I 'll go back to these as they are a better consistency and taste.

Due to the suggestions in comments, I left out the sugar and also used milk instead of half and half (well, almond milk since I dont buy regular milk) and this was a beautiful tasting side dish.  I quartered the potatoes, but it only took an extra 10 minutes to cook.

Great recipe which I will definitely remake.  Did not add the sugar.  I increased the half and half.  Didn't have enough flavor, so added some garlic salt, regular salt, and pepper to taste.  Didn't use a mixer.  Next time I will try milk instead, along with other changes.  Really easy to prepare and directions are well written.  Thank you very much!

I do like this recipe the way it is, but I leave out the steak seasoning and sugar (daughter w/diabetes). The first time I had mashed red potatoes was at Xaviers at the Four Points Sheraton. They leave part of the peels in, in small sizes and I loved it. So I scrub the spuds with a pot-like scrubber and leave even more of the peels in minus any dark spots. I've never switched back to Russets since. Sometimes, I'll grate some cheese on top and briefly put it under the broiler. This works just as well with golden potatoes. Go with what you like.

I didn't add sugar, as I believe I had made this recipe before and it completely ruined it, gross. But I made it again and it was really plain! Hmm I would say add sour cream and maybe let some cheddar cheese melt in it for extra flavor? Also add A LOT of salt it was really bland, I also recommend adding lots of garlic power to it as well. On top of all that maybe saute the garlic before adding it into the potatoes. Not sure how some things on here get so many 5 star ratings ?

I agree with others to put the garlic in the water as well as the in the potatoes.  My family and I weren't too crazy about the sugar in the potatoes, so I think I'll leave that out next time.

They're good-- but like nearly every other review, leave out the sugar!  I added some (sorry, I'm not an exact cook-- a couple dollops?) cream cheese which achieved extra creaminess and added a bit of the "sweet" that the original cook was going for with the sugar.  Also, definitely (gently) heat your butter and cream (and cream cheese if you're adding it) before adding to the potatoes.  Extra smashed garlic cloves in the cream and butter while heating also adds a little oomph of sweet, delicious garlic flavor. (I always like a little extra garlic).  Otherwise, good base recipe.

I used a bit less butter and also subbed the cream for almond milk.  I, too, boiled the crushed garlic cloves in the water, just easier. These were really good, kid and hubby approved.

These got rave reviews at Christmas from everyone--didn't have enough to make sure everyone had as much as they wanted! These were really, really good. I used minced garlic from a jar instead of crushed, but that's the only change I made.

This was the first time I made mashed potatoes that I really really liked!!!  I didn't want to use powder garlic - so while the potatoes were cooking I did up a simple garlic butter w/ a few tbsp of butter and about 2 tbsp of minced garlic, cooked on med low in a small pot.  After it had cooked the garlic a little bit I added my seasonings - a little bit of the sugar that the recipe called for and my substituted italian seasonings (instead of the steak seasoning).  I put the garlic butter in the potatoes at the same time as the rest of my butter.  Didn't have half n half, so I used heavy whipping cream instead.  Absolutely fantastic and cannot wait to make again!

I am trying to figure what I did wrong when making these potatoes, when everyone else on this site seemed to love them!  I made them exactly according to the recipe, except that I omitted the sugar.  I will say that the half cup, i.e., entire stick of butter, made them taste greasy and heavy.  They basically tasted like heavy, greasy, garlicky potato paste.  I also couldn't taste the steak seasoning -- should have added more, and I had to add a lot of salt to balance out the garlic.  I made them for Easter and it was sort of embarassing because no one in my family seemed to like them either.  :(

This is a great recipe. I did make a few changes: used milk instead of cream, cut the butter down a little bit, and omitted the sugar. I think it's key to avoid overcooking the cubed red potatoes, so they don't end up too watery/mushy. Also use a good steak seasoning that's not too overpowering. I use Emeril's all natural steak rub, and get better flavor results with that then my Penzey's chicago-style steak seasoning. I also don't bother using a blender at the end, since I like to keep the texture of the red potato skin intact. This is a really good place to start if you want to make restaurant style creamy garlic mashed potatoes.

The other reviews are right don't add the sugar! Otherwise these are absolutely amazing and simple to make! I made them for my husband who is a homestyle mashed potatoes type of guy and he prefers these ones over regular mashed potatoes now! We make these at least twice a month!

I debated about 3 or 4 stars.  Everyone commented how good they were, however, I was not satisfied.  The sugar should have been left out.  It was just too sweet for me.

Thanks to the reviews I DID NOT add sugar. Instead of using half and half I used heavy cream for a more creamy taste and was even easier when whipping it all together. Also, I did not add the crushed garlic since personally I thought the powder garlic was just enough. Overall, was very tasty!!

These were really good! I was out of garlic powder, so I just crushed a large clove with the flat of a knife and boiled it with the potatoes, then whipped it all together. My BF and I wondered about adding the sugar, but were both very pleasantly surprised! I will definitely make this again.

I made these for our early Thanksgiving yesterday, and I was disappointed.  Nobody commented on them, and they always commented on my own recipe.  I don't know what I did wrong, but too much garlic flavor and just didn't taste like good southern home cooking.

Phenomenal! This is the best mashed potato dish I have ever had. I love the sweetness that the sugar and cream give to the potatoes. This is especially great w/ a spicy dish such as the "Chipotle Crusted Pork Tenderloin". Top it off w/ a nice cold stout or porter and you have my last meal request. My family absolutely love this dish and we keep this always ready for parties and potlucks.

DO NOT ADD SUGAR!!!  This is a great recipe, but if you add the sugar, you'll be very disappointed.

Delicious!  My husband told me these were the best mashed potatoes I've ever made.  I left out the sugar and garlic powder as I just didn't think they were needed.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it will become a staple in my home!

Great recipe. I used 1/2 the amount of butter called for and did not have steak seasoning so I added a little Lawry seasoning salt. No sugar is needed. Will be making my potatoes this way alot, flavorful.

I added extra garlic and steak seasoning, plus some leftover chives. The potatoes were yummy but not my favorite. My boyfriend insisted on a 4 but he's a potato lover. :)

I can cook pretty much anything with much success. For whatever reason I never had luck with Mashed Potatoes that didn' come in a box......until this recipe.....I LOVE IT and it came out perfect. I have come up with other things to add to kick it up a bit. This was very easy and you can never go wrong when garlic is involved. The one thing I did not use was the sugar.

I cooked this for Thanksgiving and it came out great. kudos to whoever suggested cooking the garlic pieces with the potatoes so they would mash up easier. Also I wanted a slightly crisper coating and better appearance so I spooned these into a foil pan, brushed lightly with a little melted butter and put under the broiler for maybe 5 minutes. Delicious!

For me, the original recipe required a few modifications to be flavored: salt and 1/4 teaspoon more of garlic powder.   Even without using a machine, the creamy consistency came out well. I did it by hand, and it wasn't too chunky to be flavorless or too creamy as to lose the heartiness that I believe mashed potatoes should have.  Good recipe overall, but it needs the salt!

This was different and I am glad I tried them but we did not like the addition of sugar.  I seldom peel potatoes of any kind so didn't with this recipe.  We had quite a bit left over and I didn't want it all to go to waste so the next evening I added a bit of sour cream, green onions and shredded sharp cheddar cheese; formed into patties, coated with panko bread crumbs and pan fried them.  Obviously less sugar taste and turned out pretty good and I was proud to not have wasted.

Very yummy! My family and I made a giant batch so I had to add the half and half and steak seasoning according to texture and taste. I garnished this with rosemary, paprika and black pepper. It's delish! Can't wait to pair it up with the turkey!!!!!

You don't need any gravy with these spuds!!! I made them for a preschool Thanksgiving potluck, so I added 1 teaspoon of crushed garlic to the cooking water, omitted the sugar (they are delicious enough without) and PRESTO!  A big hit!

The unique thing about this recipe is that you boil the potatoes with the garlic. I don't really stick to the recipe much as I don't measure but season to taste. However the five stars is just for giving me the amazing tip about boiling with the garlic. That one instruction has changed the way I make potatoes forever.

As written I can only rate this a 4 - absolutely no sugar (at least for us). I do not peel  red potatoes and add at least twice as much garlic.   At first I thought the sugar quantity was a typo, but after reading other reviews apparently not.    Love the rest of the flavorings.

These were pretty decent mashed potatoes.  I quadrupled the garlic. (I just can't help myself!)  And, I doubled the recipe for left overs -- mashed potatoes freeze quite well (and the frozen left overs can be used to make mashed potato based casseroles, fried mashed potato patties, etc.).

So delicious that I finished it the night of! However, that's no problem because it's so simple to make. I substituted half and half with buttermilk and it worked very well still.

Liked this a lot. It has a grilled/smokey taste to it, but probably because of the steak seasoning I used. I only tweaked a couple things. I didn't use sugar, and I added a bit more steak seasoning and half and half. That's it. So easy, amd it turned out great!

These are AMAZING! I didn't have garlic powder or steak seasoning, so I just used garlic salt, the minced garlic, half and half, and butter. These were SO good. I will be making them again.... tomorrow!

Great recipe!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and omitted the sugar.  This was a really easy recipe.  I also halved the butter (mostly so I wouldn't feel too bad about eating so much!)  Added a little more garlic.  Very good!

Perfect recipe.  Very flavorful.  I would have never thought of adding steak seasoning or sugar!  Hubby loved it so much he had thirds.  Will be making again.

I'm not sure why but I just didn't like the flavor of these potatoes.  The garlic was just overwhelming and took away from everything else on the plate.  Normally I LOVE garlic!  I took them for Thanksgiving and they were not a hit.  I ended up throwing the leftovers out.  Sorry for the poor review.

Served this at Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  Made ahead and warmed potatoes in a crock pot about an hour before serving.  Delicious.  Will be a favorite way to serve mashed potatoes from now on.

This was a good recipe, my other half would give it a 5 star but it was a little on the sweet side for me, maybe next time not as much sugar. He seemed to love it.

Addictive is the word. These are great. Love them. The changes I did was omit the sugar and used milk instead. I also added some black pepper.

Really yummy mashed potatoes.  I added 2 tsp minced garlic from the jar and some salt to the boiling potatoes, used a bit less butter (it has to be real butter though!) and did half milk/half cream.  I followed the rest of the recipe for the most part.  Definitely a keeper for our family.

Very good recipe! I used a little less sugar and it tasted fine. I also substituted butter with margarine and I used soy milk instead of half and half because I'm lactose intolerant. It's quite tasty! :) I'll make these again for sure because they were so very easy to make.

It was VERY good.  I made it last night with macaroni and cheese and fried chicken.  I would, however, skip the sugar.  I did not like the little taste of sweetness in it.  I would stay exactly with the recipe, but lose the sugar.

I make this recipe all the time... and our family loves it! I make this in the food processor, which results in a lovely, creamy mashed potato!   I too omit the sugar as well as the steak sauce, and I add minced onion & extra garlic.  It's an awesome side dish to most meats... esp. steak!!  Delicious!

These are the best. I did NOT add the sugar and used Mrs. Dash seasoning instead of steak seasoning and garlic salt instead of powder (1/2 tsp each. Everything else was the same--delicious.

Csn I just say that these are absolutely phenomenal in taste, and so darn easy to make?  They make me never want to have to use the instant potatoes again.  The steak seasoning really helped give these potatoes extra kick.  Loved it!!!

A good basic recipe for garlic mashed potatoes.  I used half the butter and it was fine.  We had these with grilled steaks, creamed spinach, and watermelon.

Oh so good!  I used jarred minced garlic, and followed recipe exactly using milk instead of cream.  SOOO good.. I used with crab stuffed filet mignon and the sauce from that recipe over the potatoes was heavenly.  I can't wait to try with real roasted garlic and a handful of fresh parmesan cheese.

perfect measurements...i usually have trouble with the amount of potatoes vs. milk and whatnot...used less butter though and more garlic.  I cubed the potatoes before boiling, which I think is the best tip I've heard...turned out awesome, with a tiny bit of texture.  YUMMY!!!

Really good potatoes.  Didn't have Steak seasoning, so I used Season Salt.  I also boiled a whole clove of garlic with the potatoes and mashed it up with them.  Omitted the sugar, as suggested.

This recipe is pretty quick and simple. However, I found that it could have used a little more garlic and some salt. My hisband gave it 2 thumbs up.

These were really good mashed potatoes, not the best I've ever had but definitely good enough to make again. I only used about half the butter called for, and I also didn't have any fresh garlic so I left that out. I also didn't use an electric mixer, but they still turned out really creamy.

Very good.  I omitted the sugar and added another 1/4 c of reg milk because I found it to stiff.  I guess it depends on the size of your potatoes huh?

I just made these Mashed Potatoes and they were a hit with my family and the best that I have ever made.  The seasonings were perfect but I could use a little more garlic in them next time.

If you're serving these potatoes with something salty, add the sugar, and it makes a nice change for the palate... otherwise delete the sugar.  Either way, you'll have a hit on your hands.

These were pretty good, i did modify just a bit.  i used much more garlic (always) than called for and used a bit more seasoning.  I make homemade mashed potatoes a lot and find my version is much much better using Yukon Gold potatoes which are so sweet mashed, and use garlic, mashed with evap. milk butter, salt and then add some shredded cheese and even bacon pieces when I have the time to fry it up.  they taste like a loaded baked potatoe.  then again, they aren't called garlic mashed potatoes either so I guess it depends on the taste you're seeking when choosing a mashed potatoe recipe.

These were absolutely, hands-down, with a doubt the BEST mashed potatoes I have ever tasted.  My family went crazy over this recipe and we were all literally 'fighting' to see who would get the leftovers!  LOL  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I'm now passing it on to my outside family members to try also.  Shawnah, you weren't kidding when you said these were addictive!  Wow!  I don't know that I ever want mashed potatoes any other way now!    =:o)

I used russet potatoes since that was all I had and added 1/2 cup of sour cream to it and did not add the sugar. I also used milk instead of half and half and thoroughly salted the water for boiling. Delicious! Doesn‚Äôt even need gravy

These were good but the recipe is confusing compared to the numerous reviews I read.  Many talked about the Romano cheese, yet there was no Romano cheese in the recipe.  Kind of feeling like this recipe had been changed since first published.  Did not add the sugar as suggested by many.

I've never made mashed potatoes from scratch before this recipe and I was NOT disappointed. This is nice and easy to make along side your main course and the red potatoes give is such a nice flavor and texture. I add more garlic than is needed after following the recipe first, but I am a sucker for garlic. I recommend this highly.

I've never made mashed potatoes before.  Especially with red potatoes.  IT was good.  IT didn't seem to sweet to me.  I personally would cut this recipe in half next time because it was too much for my family of four.  Hence they are not mashed potato fans.

I always follow a recipe exactly as written when I make it for the first time.  That being said, this dish was absolutely delicious and everyone enjoyed the dish.   This recipe was a ‚Äú10‚Äù in my family.  Everyone simply enjoyed this dish and a lucky few were able to get ‚Äúseconds.‚Äù  Which means the next time I make it I will double the ingredients.  This dish will definitely be in the monthly family rotation of meals in the future.

I made this dish last night and I was very happy with the result. My girlfriend, who doesn't even like mashed potatoes, actually really enjoyed it as well. In fairness, I left out the sugar just because I thought it seemed unnecessary. I also ended up adding quite a bit more salt to taste and I didn't really taste much of the steak seasoning.  Based on the other reviews I've seen I'm very happy I avoided the sugar as many said it ruined the dish for them. I'll definitely be adding this to my rotation of side dishes.

These were good but I did modify the recipe to taste. I added salt and pepper. Surprised the recipe didn't already call for some. I also added more half and half to make them creamier.  I followed another users advice and added the smashed garlic to boil with the potatoes and then smashed it all together after draining. I left off the sugar after reading previous reviews. Much better after the modifications.

Very good and pretty simple to make actually. I will probably use this recipe again for the next time I make mashed potatoes, but will add more garlic and or garlic powder, as well as some black pepper.

It was very tasty! I did add a little salt and more half and half than what it calls in the recipe because it was a little dry. I will definitely make it again.

These were very good and I would make again for the base recipe (potatoes, butter, half/half). I prefer Garlic Mashed Potatoes Secret personally and prefer to leave the garlic and onion powder out just due to personal preference. Don't get me wrong though, we are still going to devour these! They are delicious, just not my favorite. Oh yeah...do NOT add sugar. At all. I only added 1/8 tsp so it was ok, but based on that outcome, I'll never do that again.

Did not use sugar.  Did not use salt, which I should have.  Could use milk instead of half and half or add some milk in addition to the half and half.  (They were too thick.)

Very good!   I mixed red potatoes and Yukon Gold.  I used whole milk in place of half and half.   Omitted the steak seasoning and added extra pepper, garlic powder and some dried parsley.

Followed other reviews and did not add sugar. Instead of half and half, I used heavy whipping cream. Added a little extra steak seasoning. Garnished with green onion & bacon pieces.

My go to for mashed potatoes and my family loves them! Only recommendation is do NOT add the sugar. Also I've used 2% and even skim milk and you still get that creamy texture without the heaviness of cream or half n half.

I reduced the amount of sugar added,
vary the amount of half-half depending on the consistency  I want, 
and added about 1 tbsp of mayo to give it a little bit of tang.

Followed the recipe - they were ascrumpdelicious! Made Potato Cakes with leftovers a few days later which were awesome too! Will be making these again & again. My hubby is quite a picky eater & he loved them. Of course we had pan fried T- Bones too. YUM!

Excellent!!! We used whole milk in place of half and half, and only used 1 tbs of sugar. My wife and I agreed, these mashed potatoes are just as good as the kind that was served at our wedding--and believe me those were amazing.

Pretty awesome and creamiest I ever made.

My modifications were the following.
-Steamed redskin potatoes for ~50 minutes
-remove sugar
-substitute light coconut milk for half and half
-remove steak seasoning
-add 1/4 tsp onion powder
-added a small handful of oregano/rosemary/thyme from my garden removed stems 
-added a large pinch of salt
-added an extra tsp of garlic
-put everything in my ninja

in the future i will probably try to cut butter in half and add more light coconut milk.

Wish i would have read the reviews before I added the sugar. It's not terrible but it is definitely sweeter than I prefer for mashed potatoes.

I was hesitant  about adding white sugar so I only put in 1 tablespoon and it still ruined the dish. Do not add sugar. I wish I had read the reviews before making it because other than the sugar, it was easy to make & would have been an ok recipe.

Leave the sugar out! Loved the idea of steak seasoning and I will use that again, maybe more. I used half the sugar and it was still too much. I also used heavy cream because that's what I had, can't go wrong with heavy cream.  I also didn't have garlic powder. Tasted plenty garlic without it. Great idea but adjust to your taste.

I wasn't sure if the steak seasoning should be dry - like Montreal Steak (which is what I used) or something liquid like A1.  I also used garlic salt & powder as some suggested and I thought it would have been fine without the garlic salt.  I didn't use sugar.

I omitted the sugar entirely.  Just doesn't sound like it belongs in mashed potatoes.  After that I added roughly a half cup of grated parmesan cheese.  Aside from those minor changes everything else was the same.  Came out great.  Even my son (who doesn't like potato skins) had seconds!

I just made these last night, and we loved them! Just be smart about what you add from the ingredients list. I didn't like the sound of adding sugar and steak seasoning, so I just didn't add them. Instead I added salt, pepper, shredded cheese, etc. If you follow the basic recipe, you'll get GREAT, flavorful, and easy mashed potatoes. Just add what you want from there on :)

Mine turned out with a decent flavor, but very thin for mashed potatoes. Not sure why. I almost considered making a soup out of these because they were so runny. The texture wasn't appetizing, but at least they tasted okay.

I did not add sugar, but I roasted a head of garlic (cut off the top, drizzle with olive oil and bake for 1 hour) and added the roasted garlic to the recipe.  I keep kosher, so I used almond milk.  The house full of company is still raving about them!

I put all the garlic in the water with the potatoes, and the garlic taste was still plenty strong.  I used whole milk, and I ended up adding a little more milk, butter, and steak seasoning(which I made myself from a recipe I found online). Easy enough.  No need to use electric mixer in my opinion. But I definitely let the potatoes boil longer than 10 because the rest of my meal was not ready yet, which made it easier to hand whisk the potatoes. Just left a few chunks in there.  I will never peel or use another kind of potato again!

AMAZING!! This was absolutely one of the best dishes I‚Äôve ever made. I changed some things based on what I had on hand and our personal tastes. I used chicken broth instead of water to boil the potatoes, not sure if that made a difference or not but I had some leftover that I refused to throw away. I also omitted the sugar and just added whatever amount of the seasonings I wanted. I used Montreal Steak, Montreal Chicken and pepper. I also used heavy whipping cream with a tiny bit of milk and subbed part of the regular butter for a Saut√© Express seasoned butter cube (they‚Äôre great with just about anything). I have never made GREAT mashed potatoes and these were better than any I‚Äôve ever had in a restaurant or even homemade. Thank you so much for the great recipe!

These potatoes come out nice and fluffy and have the right bit of garlic taste. I recommend that you peel the skin off of the red skin potatoes before you boil them.and I also recommend cooking the potatoes just a bit loner than 10 minutes (I went as long as 20 minutes for 8 potatoes). Doing so will allow your mashed potatoes to be even "fluffier" than normal (more whipped).

Liked it without the sugar, 1/4 cup butter, almond milk instead of half and half. I didn't have a steak seasoning so I used an equal amount of dashi (Japanese soup base powder).

This recipe would be 4 stars without sugar.  I should have read the reviews before I made this because no one likes the sugar in these.  All the other flavors made this a very flavorful recipe.

Very tasty. I added a Tablespoon or two of sour cream to make it creamy.

I thought this would have been much better without any sugar.  AND I just read the reviews about omitting sugar....just goes to show you what happens when you don't READ!

These are a family favorite!  Even my grandson, who is the most finicky eater ever (and I mean that) loves these mashed potatoes, skin and all!  They are a go-to recipe when I have company, and the bowl is usually empty even though I always make enough for leftovers for my husband!  And, by the way, I follow the recipe just as it is!

When I cook a recipe I like to follow the recipe exactly for the first time, I think this is really the only true way to rate a recipe.  With this recipe I followed it exactly, and I read all the reviews about not adding the sugar and I agree not to add the sugar, but I am glad I followed it.  The sugar added a whole different taste and it wasn't a bad taste it was just different.  I will also say the potatoes were a little dry.  I always ask my 8 year old son for a second opinion but on this one I have opt him out he doesn't like mashed potatoes.

I did not add the last 3 ingredients.  I added salt and pepper to taste. I minced my fresh garlic.  Came out super creamy and delicious.

Delicious and easy! Only thing I did differently was omit the sugar, only used garlic powder, and I used 2% milk. I think the key to this recipe is the steak seasoning. I used a very good quality that was made locally in Chicago, I probably used close to a teaspoon. It was so delicious!

I don't know WHY you would add sugar to this recipe. I omitted it and was glad. Also reduced the amount of butter by 25% and used fat free greek yogurt instead of half and half. Turned out just as magnificently delicious. 
TIP: The second time I made this recipe (Same changes as before), I doubled it, and also made a batch of this web site's Roasted Swiss Chard with Feta (except I used freshly grated parmesan instead of feta), and I mixed the two recipes together in a big bowl. Now my potatoes also have the delicious, chewy chard and sweet onions! Try it!

This has been made twice in two weeks for my family and will be made again. I do agree with the other reviewers as far as the sugar goes, I would omit it and I like extra garlic in my potatoes as well. Delicious and will be made again!

The potatoes came out very creamy, but they were bland.  I omitted the sugar as almost every review had suggested it, but it still didn't have much of a garlic flavor to it.  After trying the initial product, I added a more garlic powder to the mix (just in case I was the only one thinking it needed more garlic) and my family said you couldn't really taste the garlic either.  Definitely would need to change the seasoning level to have this again.

I left out the sugar.  Use a potato masher or ricer or food mill, whatever you have, and you'll also get a little exercise!

Do NOT add sugar!! Totally unnecessary and would have been SO much better without it. Since I couldn't undo it, I added cayenne and crushed red pepper and turned them into sweet and spicy mashed potatoes, which worked to improve the recipe greatly. I will make these again, but with a few changes!

These were absoloutely delicious!  I did NOT add any sugar.  I doubled the recipe because I was making them for about 12 people.  I made them ahead of time and let them stay warm in the crockpot. The steak seasoning is the secret ingredient!!  (I used Monterey seasoning)

Great mashed potatoes!  I only gave this 4 stars because I omitted the sugar as suggested by other reviewers.  Also, because my potatoes were soft enough, once I mashed them and mixed in all the ingredients with a fork, I didn't at all use an electric mixer because they had the perfect texture.

Delicious.  I've made it with and without the sugar and prefer without.  I have a question though, can these be made ahead of time for a dinner party and then re-heated, or would that ruin them?

I followed the recipe almost completely, as I swapped in fresh chopped garlic per another reviewer.  I also skipped using the mixer as simply mashing made the potatoes smooth enough.  The occasional flash of red was a nice variation to the usual mashed potatoes, and they were a perfect compliment to the Honey Glazed Pork recipe on this site.

Not sure what happened to my original review, but I'll attempt another one. Instead of diced, I chunked my potatoes, which resulted in a longer boiling time. It worked out well since I was busy with other things on Thanksgiving Day. I admit, I used this recipe loosely as a guide, adding seasonings to taste rather than following the recipe measurements. I omitted the sugar per other reviewers and added chives for color. Easy, tasty, and rustic, these potatoes were a treat for garlic lovers, and made for a fantastic accompaniment to the Thanksgiving Day turkey.

Absolutely fabulous !!!!   Our dinner guests could not get enough of them.
Two things I did differently:  added the garlic after draining the potatoes instead of into the water and I omitted the sugar.
Thank you Shawnah for a wonderful recipe.

I loved these and ate so much my stomach was aching! I didn't have crushed garlic so I just sprinkled a little bit of garlic powder in while the potatoes boiled and I liked the subtle taste, I didn't add any extra to the mashed potatoes. Also used milk because it was all I had on hand and I only added 1Tbsp of sugar. I liked the added sugar, you couldn't really pick out the extra sweetness, it made it more like the potatoes themselves were sweet.

My family LOVED these mashed potatoes. My mother is off-the-boat Irish and my dad pretty much does not change his ways once he likes something...but he adored these. Slight variations based on other reviews, did not add sugar or steak seasoning.

this was an easy recipe, but i needed to add quite a bit of garlic salt to give it more flavor.  We did not have any steak seasoning, but maybe that would have made a difference.

Took out the sugar and substituted milk for half and half. Also, I added chives. Still came out a little bland for my taste, I think next time I'll try adding some sour cream to the mix.

Yummy!! I left out the sugar, seemed weird to add it to mashed potatoes. The steak seasoning and boiling the garlic with the potatoes gave it very nice flavor. I used milk in place of the half and half.

These were good.  I listened to other reviews and just added 1 teaspoon of sugar - it was still too sweet for my taste.  My husband said he liked them a lot (and did not say they were too sweet) and he had several helpings, but when I asked if they were his favorite he said they were not as creamy as he would would like.

Thanks for the recommendations not to use the sugar - I thought that seemed odd. These were delish and I loved the addition of Montreal Steak Seasoning.

These were the best mashed potatoes I have had!! 5 stars ++++. After reading other reviewers comments I decided to leave out the sugar altogether. I never did use sugar in my mashed potatoes. Did not think I would miss anyways. They boiled up nicely and mashing it with a fork was not at all difficult. These came out fluffy, creamy, full of flavor. I could taste the garlic, creaminess and I loved the bits of skin. I also served this with hamburger steak with onions and gravy. This is a winner and a nice break from rice.

If I hadn't put the sugar in the potatoes, they may have been excellent.  The sugar made them VERY sweet.

I added the sugar in, since that's the actual recipe! It tasted pretty good, a'' sweet cream taste'' to it. After I tasted it that way, I added extra garlic and salt as a personal preference.

Made these tonight. My mashed potatoes are usually kind of bland. These were delicious! I only used 1 tsp of sugar and omited the crushed garlic, but used the garlic powder. And didn't have steak seasoning. But I can't image them being any better! Be sure to salt the potatoes when cooking. I didn't use electric mixer either, used a fork so they were kind of lumpy.  Yum..Will make again.

This is an easy basic recipe to have in your collection. I made it without the sugar and it was fine without it. I love the creaminess of the potatoes and the garlic flavor together. This is a nice side to any dish. Leftovers are awesome the next day too!

Just made these and they are delicious, and I have a house full of picky eaters! Next time I'll go with 1 tablespoon instead of 2. For those of you not sure about adding the sugar, it's a neat way to try something new.  I paired it with oh so good pork chops I found on here.  The sweetness of both compliment each other so well.  Just make sure to prepare enough for seconds.  The two together were such a nice change from the everyday dinner.

Amazing! DO NOT ADD SUGAR! It is completely unnecessary and why add more sugar to your diet when you don't need to? These are awesome and my whole family loves them. Update 12/2011: Made them again and this time halved the butter and used whole milk instead of half n' half to try and cut down on the fat a bit. Still just as good!

These potatoes are fabulous ONLY if you cut the sugar waaaay down which is why I gave it 4 stars. The first time I made them as the recipe called, I was really disappointed. The second time, I only added sugar a teaspoon full at a time. I think I wound up using only three teaspoons, and that time it was perfect!!!!

I really liked where this recipe was going but I agree... WAY too much sugar!  I will try it again but use 1 TEASPOON next time because it was too sweet.  I also like the suggestion of heating the half and half mixture prior to adding it.

I followed this exactly except for the sugar- that just sounded weird, and judging by the other reviews who ruined their potatoes- I'm glad I skipped the sugar!! However, I followed the recipe and added a little more garlic than it says, and they were wonderful!! My husband kept eating them, and even my 1 year old LOVED them! They were soooo creamy!! Yum- this one's a keeper!

These are really good and remind of Applebee's.  I did omit the sugar (it just seemed odd and excessive) and used about 1 tsp more garlic.  Delicious!

Don't add the sugar.  Aside from that though I get so many compliments on this recipe when I make them.  These are truly the best garlic mashed I have ever tasted.  I end up just eyeing the mashed though when it comes to the half and half until it is to the consistancy that I like and just keep tase testing.  Friends, family, and co-workers are always wanting more.

Delicious.  I probably used a little more or less of all of the ingredients as listed, but didn't really make any significant changes.  The family loves these potatoes.

Not bad.  There was too much butter and too much milk for my potatoes, and I couldn't taste the garlic much (next time I'd add more!) but they were easy and quick and this is a recipe that can be easily tweaked.  Thanks for the recipe!

These potatoes were OK but my husband noticed the sugar immediately and found them too sweet and the garlic taste was a bit too bitter for my daughter.  Maybe another attempt playing around with the proportions...

I just threw my old mashed potatoes recipe away, this one is the best.  Easy to make and taste great!  I do add in a little more steak sauce then it says just because I like that bold flavor it brings to the potatoes!  ENJOY

After reading some suggestions, I doubled the steak seasoning and halved the sugar.  These turned out just "okay".  I have had better mashed potatoes so these probably won't be in the regular rotation.

This recipe was great, but next time I'll use a little less sugar and I also added a tad bit more steak seasoning and salt.  Otherwise great tasting, easy recipe.

I made these for our Thanksgiving Dinner. Even though I had to substitute  evaporated milk for the 1/2 & 1/2 it was outstanding! Was also very good re-heated for last nights supper!

I made these for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them. They were quick and easy to make. I left out the sugar. I wonder if they ment to add the sugar to the water when they cook. I soak pealed carrets in sugar water when they have no flaver and it makes them sweeter.

i suggest waiting until the end to try out the sugar. i put half of what the recipe called for. i also thought they were a little bland, so i added some salt and more garlic. everyone has their own taste! in the end, the sugar added a nice extra flavor but i am glad i didnt add more. the texture was creamy. will make again!

I loved these potatoes.  It made it so I did not have to make gravy.  Mine tuned out a little dry for me so next time I think that I will add a little more half and half to make them a bit more creamy.

I was so afraid of adding the sugar after reading all these reviews, but I was feeling all wild and crazy, so I tasted it without, with half the amount and with the full two tbs. I personally liked it best with the 2 tbs. It was a nice mix of sweet (but not too much so) & savory. It's really just a matter of preference, so I'd say just do it to taste. Also, I used evaporated milk instead of half-and-half just because I had an already opened can. I'll be making these a lot more often.

Gave 3 stars because the sugar makes them too sweet.   But use milk instead of cream, add more garlic and skip the sugar and the recipe is 5 stars all the way!

I usually make this recipe but in a different way,simpler,and healthier. just boil the potatoes, and mashed it with a spoon then add some sour lemon liquid, crushed garlic,salt& cumin. Mix all of them together very good and shape them in a plate and put olive oil on top. Try it and tell me.

The first time I made this it was too much garlic for us so as I read more reviews I cooked all the raw garlic with the potatoes and it was much better.  Overall we enjoy these very much and I seem to be making them weekly.

Based on the previous reviews, I did not add the sugar. Also, as I had no garlic power or steak seasoning I didn't add those either.  However,  as I had never worked with red potatoes, it was a nice spin. Served with Chicken Caccitore.

I added only 1 tablespoon of sugar and that made it sweet enough! This could use a little more garlic powder also. Overall it was really good and did well with the ribeyes I made.

So yummy!  I wanted something other than "plain" potatoes to go with ham for Easter dinner & this was it.  I used small creamer potatoes and left out steak seasoning (didn't have any).  I put all of the garlic in the potatoes while cooking as I don't care for raw garlic.  Easy and delicious.

I am going to try this recipe tomorrow evening with Beef Wellington. One of the methods I always do when making mashed potatoes is to save the drained cooking water and once potatoes are mashed,adding the liquid back in along with enough WARMED milk or cream to the desired consistency. The water is full or flavour and nutrients! I'm assuming that the potatoes are left unpeeled?? I'm also taking the general consensus advice by eliminating the sugar!!

Fantastic potatoes!  Left out the sugar as recommended, used Smart Balance instead of regular butter and added a pinch of salt. Note: It took close to 20 mins for my potatoes to boil.

we made these potatoes to go with halibut that was seasoned with dill and lemon ginger green beans.  it was a great combination!  we did NOT add the sugar or the steak seasoning.  red potatoes have a natural sweetness and do not need sugar.  we also added a quarter tsp of black pepper and a quarter tsp of white pepper.  delicious!

These were okay. Would have been MUCH better without the sugar. Way too sweet. And I only used about 1 Tbs. I'm not sure what the purpose of the sugar is? Anyways, with some modifications and omit the sugar, they would probably be really good.

It was good, not great and I added fresh roasted garlic.  I was afraid of the steak spice and used less, so it was a little bland.

Decent mashed taters, yo!  I left out the sugar, and instead of garlic powder i just used extra fresh garlic, all of which I boiled with the potatoes.  Didn't bother using the mixer, just boiled them long enough to hand mix.  I recommend trying herbs en provence instead of the steak seasoning.

These were awesome.  I made them for Thanksgiving and they were devoured.  I didn't put in the sugar or the steak seasoning.  Also instead of half and half I used plain yogurt.  They were so good.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. These potatoes were bland and flavorless. Even adding additional butter, salt and sour cream, I couldn't even save these. Not enough garlic, or salt, or butter is called for in this recipe. These did not turn out too good at all. Just not enough flavor for me, and definitely not the type of potatoes I was looking for. Can't even think of any modifications to make this recipe more useful. Won't be attempting this one again.

My husband and I loved this. We served it at Christmas dinner and some of our guests thought that it had too much garlic in it but it was good for our tastes.

Like other reviews I did not add the sugar. Also, I didn't have steak seasoning on hand so I used various other spices (pepper, salt, oregano and onion powder). They came out really tasty!

Very strong Garlic!! Make it for those of you who love the stuff. Everyone ate it, though. I'd pull away most of the garlic, myself...but it was very good.

These potatoes are wonderful!  I omitted the sugar, as was suggested by many other reviews, except for a little sprinkle.  I added a little extra garlic during the boil, it was terrific :)

Thanks; this was great! I used Montreal steak seasoning. I did omit the sugar after reading the reviews, and for 1/2 bag of baby reds, I used 1 1/2 sticks butter.  They turned out exactly like the delicious ones in restaurants!

This was a good base for mashed potatoes but I didn't make them exactly the same way. I used milk instead of half and half, and used white and red potatoes to get more fluff and less skin from the mixture. Finally, I put whole garlic when boiling the potatoes (BTW, I peeled the white but didn't peel the skin off of the red) and used Lawry's garlic salt and fresh grated onion (about 2 tablespoons) when mixing up the last bit of it. Hope some of my changes help someone else out. Oh, finally, I DID NOT add sugar.

I really like this recipe.  The sugar is an unexpected ingredient for mash potatoes, but the sweet touch works really well with the savory garlic.  This is my go-to recipe for mashed potatoes now!

I loved this recipe....it is now the only way I do mashed potatoes. The only thing I modified was the amount of garlic, we used significantly more, and a hint of pepper. But, the best recipe ever!

I did not like these potatoes.  I left out the sugar like some of the other reviews suggested, but I thought they just tasted like butter and needed something else.  If I made them again I would reduce the amount of butter and add onions, salt and more steak seasoning.  I made them for a dinner party and others agreed.

This is a good base recipe and was VERY easy to follow, but it lacked flavor for me. Granted, I did not have the steak seasoning, but I don't think that alone would have fixed the blandness. I think next time I will use broth instead of water and play with some other spices and add more garlic at the end.

But for my first time EVER making mashed potatoes from scratch, this recipe was perfect!

These potatoes were really good.  I had to add some mayo as I always add some to mine.  It was a really good side dish to the Worcestershire Pork chops and sauce.  Yumm!  Thanks!

These are VERY good.  I rated them 4 stars because they really needed additional salt in my husband's (he's my taste tester).  I agreed with him also.  I also added more steak seasoning.  On the upside they were wonderfully garlicky which we loved!  I would make these again with a few small changes and I would leave the skin on almost all the potatoes.

Mm, not bad. I made these without the sugar because of previous reviewers, and I used milk instead of cream. I think next time I'll add three total tsp of garlic, and one tsp of steak seasoning. They were a little bland for me tonight. I'll make them again though. ^^

These were very yummy!!  I did omit the steak seasoning and sugar. I roasted garlic in the over at 375 degrees for about 30-40 min and added that in place of the garlic powder.   I also used some fresh ground pepper.  I only left about half of the skin on the potatoes, so it wasn't overwhelming.  They were super yummy!

Really great recipe.  I made these for a recent dinner party with stuffed cabbage and they were a hit.  Everyone thought I made too much food but I didn't have any leftovers when dinner ended!  I was leary of your warnings about the sugar so I think I compromised and used 1/2 the sugar.  Thank you for the recipe and advice.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe for my 1st time attempt at "mashed potatoes". I left out the sugar completely, but should have added more salt. Overall a good recipe and I look forward to making it again!

My husband and I loved this recipe! These potatoes were the best I had ever made or ate for that matter. They are sure to become a weekly tradition around my house!

my only recommendation is that it needed salt, other than that it was delish.

Awesome side dish!

Very tasty and smooth! The fat content is somewhat high, but a good splurge for the Holidays!

Yummy! Definately a keeper. I omitted the sugar at the advice of some of the other reviewers, and I didn't miss it at all. I also substituted regular milk for the cream because I didn't have any, and that was fine (although I will stick to the recipe for that part next time if I can).

Holy Smokes!  These were a hit! Read the reviews & mixed some russet potatoes and they were the best!  For a "first timer" to make mashed potatoes...hat's off to me!  Thanks sooo much for sharing this recipe!

If I could give thsese potatoes 6 stars, I would!  It was perfectly flavored.  The Romana cheese added a kick to it.  It turned out super creamy and the chunks of potato skins were a nice complement to the smooth texture.  Definitely the favorite dish served during Thanksgiving!

Yummy!! I added a little salt as this recipe was a little bland, but, that's all it needed. Perfect! I'll be making these again, and again, and again.

Nice and creamy but as written I thought they were a little bland.  Ended up having to doctor them up to our taste.

It was good, but I personally don't think it was creamy enough for me. But, I will make it again. My husband thought they were the best potatoes in the world.

Very yummy! Made twice- the first time I didn't put enough cheese and the amount of oregano it called for was way too strong! The second time, they were delicious- I was generous on the cheese and put only a pinch of oregano. I also added milk to make more creamy. Everyone loved them, but they are very high in calories!
