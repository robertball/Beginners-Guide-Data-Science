Very tasty. Just the perfect lime taste.  I particular like my rice white so next time I am going to use half chicken broth and half water.

Will make again!!! It was simple to put together and tasty. I used every day white rice because it's what I had and didn't compromise the recipe.

This was great!  I made it to jazz up our usual taco night.  Due to weeknight rush, I skipped the corn and green onion but I'm sure that would be even better.  It was still good without it!

I made this recipe and it was so easy and delicious. I read the other reviews so I knew I could sub for the rice I had on hand. I used Rice Select Royal Blend. It has Texmati white, brown, wild and red rice. It was yummy. I also added the entire can of corn cause what the world was I gonna do with the rest of it? Hahaha. I plan to double or triple the recipe next time. It was that good!

Very simple and FULL of flavor. Can be easily tailored to your own taste, but very good as it is. Has a nice clean taste that will compliment any Latin dish.

I made this to go with Taco pie, it was delicious!! I didn't have any corn on hand but made no changes to recipe. I served black beans over it, everyone loved it. But it has enough flavor to stand alone! This will be my go to for rice with any Mexican dish I make! Thx!

This is a nice change from regular rice or potatoes. I made it with Grilled Teriyaki Shrimp and Pineapple Skewers. What a nice summer dinner! I would reduce the cooking time from 15 min to 12 or 13 min, depending on your stove. Will make it again!

This is an excellent recipe! Thank you for posting this! I made this with the Black Bean Tacos on this site. Great for a side dish or as the base for a rice bowl which I did with the leftovers. The only thing I did differently was that I didn’t add the corn. It was only because I forgot to add it. It doesn’t need it but it will probably be even better with it. This is going in my regular rotation!

So Delicious! I used white rice, 1/2 tsp of salt(fear of over-salting), and probably slightly less cilantro because I did not measure it; I just grabbed a bunch. I did need 1 3/4 C liquid and about 17 mins to steam the rice, but that's just me! Next time I will probably add beans of some sort just to compliment.

Tasty, but I think I would add more corn and perhaps some black beans to make it more substantial.

Very good. I just don't use basmati rice.

I loved this recipe! I did not change it but I served it as a rice bowl topped with thin sliced sirloin marinated in lime juice and cumin sauteed and placed atop the rice. I garnished with some other veggies. This could be done with chicken or shrimp.

Perfect! I only added half the cilantro/lime zest and it was perfect for the kids; you can always add more if you want on your own.
