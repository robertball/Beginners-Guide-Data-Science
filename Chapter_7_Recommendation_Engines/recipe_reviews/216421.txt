This Recipe is great! I added a bit of oranje juice since  I did not have enough zest and it is wonderful. Have made this a number of times,and it is rediculous  to buy the canned stuff when this is so easy and much better tasting.

This turned out tasty but it was definitely NOT as much as it advertised! I wanted 12 servings and the recipe servings was far too small. If you're making this for a group definitely triple the amount!

It seems rediculous to spend so much time on this. All you have to do is dissolve the sugars in the liquid, bring it to a boil, toss the cranberries in, simmer them for another 10-15 minutes until most of them have popped, cool and refrigerate. I've never heard of anyone cooking cranberries for 3 hours.

It was perfect!

Though I did not need to cook it any longer than the 3 hours covered.  Once I took the lid off, to begin the 45 minutes without the lid, I realized it was already the consistency it needed to be.

But it was great!  Didn't change a thing other than the cooking time. ;)

This recipe was so good we made it twice before Thanksgiving.  In addition to the ingredients we included the zest one orange to the mix.  Delicious!

Wonderful!  So easy to make.  Everyone just loved it, honestly!  You can use fresh or frozen cranberries.  I have used both and both are tasty.  I garnished mine with fresh orange zest.

I never liked cranberry sauce, I think mostly because I hated the way it came out of the can. This recipe was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. I will never buy canned again! This tastes wonderful and smells delightful! This a a favorite!

I loved the idea of making cranberry sauce in the slow cooker. I altered it a bit because of what I had on hand. I used 3 small oranges peeled and cut up because I had no juice. I also added 3 pears that needed to be used, 1 apple (unpeeled), 1 (20 oz.) can crushed pineapple, 1/3 c. water, 1 1/3 c. white sugar, 1 bag (12 oz.) fresh cranberries. Cooked 3 hours on high w/ lid on then removed to thicken a bit. Everyone loved it:)

Well, family thought it was too sweet, but I absolutely loved it, which is weird because I'm the one that usually is sensitive to sweets. I think they were just used to their recipe which is, well, not as good as this in my opinion.

Silly.  Much too mushy.  No advantage over stove top sauce.  Sorry I wasted all those cranberries and sugar.

After 40 years of stovetop cranberry sauce, we made this one this year. Best ever, and for the first time, there wasn't a drop left. We did have about a half bag of leftover berries from another dish that went into this one, without adjusting the other ingredients. I don't know how much difference it made, I just know it was the best ever.

The thing is it only takes about 10 min. to cook a pot of cranberries....and then set it aside to cool.  I just don't see this as very practical, as instead of a dirty crock pot to deal with, I just have one pan to wash and then pour the sauce into my serving dish, chill, and forget about it until serving time.  sorry!

I tripled the recipe and cooked it for about one hour longer than called for.  Alot of the cranberries had not yet popped, even with the longer cooking time.  I popped them with a wooden spoon, but  the sauce did not jell, even after refrigerating it overnight.  In order to serve it at the right consistency, I had to add gelatin to the sauce.

I am NOT a fan of canned cranberry sauce, so whenI saw this recipe using fresh cranberries AND it as a crockpot re opening, I couldn't resist trying it.  SO easy and SO good!  It's been a staple a our Thanksgiving and Christmas feasts for three years running now.

This was really good!  Made it for Thanksgiving this year.  Was worried it wouldn't thicken up, but it worked great.  Next time I think I will omit the cinnamon.  You could really taste the orange juice.  I will always use the crock pot for my cranberry sauce now.  Thank you for sharing.

Loved, loved, loved it! I will always make this sauce in the slow cooker. You just put the ingredients in and you don't have to worry about it. And I'm all for less pots on the stove top! I didn't change a thing and the sauce came out perfect for our Thanksgiving meal. All our guests raved about it BUT you will have to double the recipe if you are serving more than 6 people. I don't think there is really enough for 12 servings.

My husband and I loved this cranberry sauce.  I made it for a dinner party we were having which included 6 people.  This amount was just right for 6 people.  Also had to add a bit more sugar.  Will definitely be making again.

We make this exactly as listed.  This cooks whiles the turkey is in the oven and tastes delicious.  This is the kids contribution to dinner as it is easy for them to make.  We usually double the batch and that feeds 14.  The kids have also made anextra batch to give jars to their teachers at Christmas.

Fabulous recipe. Very easy. Only left my recipe on high for 2 hours, 45 minutes. Then let the hot sauce cool in a Tupperware for 2 hours, which makes the sauce jell nicely. Easy and quick recipe.

Made this recipe this weekend for thanksgiving. I found the consistency of the cranberry sauce not to my liking. I think I will stick to making cranberry sauce over the stove.

Had never even tried cranberry sauce before - probably because my family always served the canned kind.  This was fabulous!  Delicious on top of the turkey and would probably be excellent over pork as well.

Very good flavor. After 3 hours on high, I could see that it was going to be runny. I had to cook it down a bit on the stove for a thicker consistency and then it firmed up a bit more in fridge.

I doubled the ingredients for 20 people.  Perfect amount.  I was out of orange juice so I used blueberry lemonade juice from simply orange and it gave it a sweet tart flavor.  Everyone loved it.

Horrible. I made a triple batch so I could can it for future use. Cooked 7 hours, never thickened. Had cranberry soup. Back to the stove for me.

I made this today for Thanksgiving. It was easy and using the crockpot freed up my stove for other things .My guests enjoyed it. I found it to be a little too tart so when I make it next time I may up the sugar by 1/4 cup.

Nothing like out of the can and a little more sweeter than I expected. Very easy to make and I suggest a cup of OJ and no water. I would make this again.

I hand squeezed the orange juice and combined it with 1/4 cup pineapple juice and 1/4 water. I decided to cook this up in a pan to get it nice and hot and then added it to my slow cooker to insure it would be done at the same time as the turkey. Slow cooked it for 3 hours. It tasted SO GOOD!

great for making room on the stove on Thanksgiving. I  swapped out the orange juice for more water for a low acid sauce, and ended up with a little extra liquid because I didn't cook it long enough, but I just scooped it out with a slotted spoon and it was fine, whole family enjoyed it, even the ones who refuse to eat the canned stuff.

After cooking time was completed, the sauce was still watery even though I added cornstarch. The color was more like tawny port wine, and the sauce was a little bitter. Think I'll stick to cooking my sauce on the stove top according to the directions on the package.

This was a life saver for me, as we were in the middle of a major kitchen remodel and I didn't have a cook top.
It was really easy and good. although next time I would omit the cinnamon (both my husband and I agreed on that). Thanks for the great and easy recipe!

I made the recipe just as written and it was fabulous.  Reminded me of when my Grandmother cooked cranberry sauce.  I will probably double the recipe next year as it didn't make enough for the big group I had.  I was wondering if you could run it through a food processor for those people who don't like the lumpiness and like the "jelly" version.

Delicious!!!!1  Followed recipe exactly.  Next time I'll double or triple because it didn't make too much.  Good warm or chilled.  This would be great with Monte Cristo Sandwich.  Thanks, great recipe.

I had never made cranberry sauce before, but wanted to try one, with the madness of getting Thanksgiving dinner done, I thought this sounded simple and easy.  It was the bomb!  Everyone loved it, even the family members who said they didn't like cranberry sauce.  Definitely a keeper!

I've made this recipe for our last 2 Thanksgiving dinners.  But both times I just cooked it on top of the stove, as I was more interested in trying the additional ingredients - instead of using just water and white sugar. I brought it all to a simmer and cooked until thickened.  Everyone loved it!
