This is the same exact recipe as the Libby's pumpkin pie on the back of the can, with the exception of the spice. Personally, I find the spice proportions in pumpkin pie spice not quite right, therefore I never use it. This recipe would have been 5 stars in my opinion if the spices were 2 tsp cinnamon 1tsp ground ginger and 1/4 tsp of ground cloves. I highly recommend this for a fabulous pumpkin pie. This is a great basic recipe as far as texture goes. Also, the pie shell should go in the oven frozen, or at the very least very very cold. Don't leave it sitting out in the pie pan while you prepare the filling.

A whipped cream topping made this a great dessert last Thanksgiving. Great pumpkin taste.

This is a wonderful pie recipe, with or without the pumpkin pie spice or added individually.  Have been making this recipe for MANY years, however, I do make my own piecrust.  It is better and less expensive. Happy Holiday!  Mary

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving last year and everyone gobbled it up. I just placed the pie in the oven for this year, and am so thankful it is such a simple yet delicious recipe! I am an inexperienced baker but even I can make a wonderful homemade pie for the Holiday's by following this recipe! I hope your family enjoys it as much as mine does!

I use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground ginger, and 1/4 tsp ground cloves for spice, and add 1 Tbsp rum. Because I don't like my pie so sweet, I cut the amount of sugar in half, and I find the pie still sweet enough. I use a homemade crust instead of the store-bought one.
This time, I added a broiled marshmallow topping, and the pie was award-worthy. Just pile mini marshmallows on the cold pie to cover the top, then broil (approx 5-6 inches below broiler rods) for 1 minute, until marshmallows are lightly browned. Turn off broiler and let pie sit in oven until marshmallows have softened, about 3 minutes.

This is so much better than store bought pie.  First of all, the Pillsbury crusts are really flaky.  Secondly, the natural pumpkin flavor comes through nicely.  If you don't like your pie very spicy, you can cut back on the amount of pumpkin pie spice that you use.  I only used about 3/4 tsp for mine.  Also, I left out the salt.  I never add salt to pudding type pies, because I have high blood pressure.  You won't miss it, believe me. It's very creamy.  Make two: it disappears quickly!
