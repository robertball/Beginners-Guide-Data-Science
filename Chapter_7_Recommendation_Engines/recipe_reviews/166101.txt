This is a nice and simple recipe for a quick weekneight dinner. I used a little more balsamic vineger than the recipe called for though. It helped to balance out the sweetness. This is a great recipe, thanks!

4.5 stars actually.  This recipe was quick to prepare and turned out well.  Instead of apricot preserves, I used apricot "simply fruit" which may have been a little less sweet...it had the right amount of sweetness in the end.  I also used canned apricots instead of dried which were juicier and may have made a little more sauce than originally intended.  I added just a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce and served it with orzo pilaf and broccoli.  Make sure to serve this with rice or pasta to go along with all of the sauce.

I didn't have dried apricots but I did have 3 fresh peaches on hand. I also used fresh sage. It's a keeper! Balsamic and fruit are a great combo.

We thought this was very good and will do it again in the future.  Next time I make it I'm going to add some fresh chopped garlic to the mix shortly after the onions start cooking to give it another layer of flavor.  I will also use boneless, skinless thigh fillets instead of breast meat because we just like them better.  I made a half recipe for two people and it was really good.

We love this! I made it for supper this evening with rice and steamed broccoli. My husband had seconds. As one reviewer mentioned, it's a wonderful blend of sweet and savory. While it simmers, you can prep quick side dishes so everything is ready at the same time. Great weeknight entree. This is definitely a keeper for us. Thanks for sharing!

Really enjoyed the mix of flavors in this recipe. We had canned apricots and grilled chicken that needed to be used, and this worked great. I substituted the canned apricots for dried and used their juice (no sugar added kind) with a bullion cube instead of the chicken broth. 
Definitely will make again

This was not a winner in my household.  My husband thought it was too sweet - even after I added the dijon as suggested.  I don't think we'll make it again.

Enjoyed this recipe - served over couscous.  I wanted a thicker sauce so I added a little corn starch slurry to it in the end and it thickened right up.  It felt a little heavy on the thyme flavor, but I suspect that is because I used dried instead of fresh thyme (reduced to 1 tsp.).  Next time I will probably cut back on the thyme a little more if using dried.  Overall, unique, easy recipe with an interesting mix of flavors.

I know, I know, I didn’t make this exactly as written, but I got as close as I could.  I used canned chopped peaches and peach preserves.  And I cut back on the preserves a bit because I didn’t want it to be too sweet.  My version was quite good, as I’m sure it would have been using the apricots.  Since my peaches didn’t need to soften, I put them in last just to warm them through, setting some aside for garnish, along with a garnish of fresh thyme instead of the parsley.  I served this over Brazilian White Rice, also from this site.  We both enjoyed this dinner!

i am starting to think that the nice folks here on allrecipes just have lower food standards than i do... this is the most recent of many so-called 5star recipes i have tried, and it is really nothing special. i'm not gonna throw away the left overs, but maybe add some sriracha to try to counteract the sweetness. i would only recommend this if you already have all ingredients on hand; don't make a special trip to the store.

This went over well at our house and it's simple to make for a weeknight meal. The consensus is that it is too sweet. Will try again next time with only half the preserves and maybe toss in a handful of raisins or cranberries.

Excellent dish, especially considering the first time I made it we had friends over for an impromptu dinner party (I had already started making it when they called inviting us out, so we just invited them over instead), so I just had to cross my fingers that it would turn out ok! Lots of flavor and very straightforward to make. Only differences from how it is written were that I had chicken thigh fillets and the preserves were apricot, peach and passionfruit "fruit spread" so might have had less sugar. I used about 1tsp dried thyme instead of the fresh. We served it with jasmine rice and our friends made "Texas Caviar" as the appetizer. Bliss in the mouth!

I really loved the flavor of this dish but think I will use less apricots next time. The preserves gave it enough of the flavor, in my opinion.

I really liked this. I didn't find it to be too sweet at all. I made it exactly as written other than cutting all of the apricots in two so they would stretch further. It only took about 30 minutes to make, so it's a great meal for the middle of the workweek.

Wow! This was SO easy and fast. The flavor combination is incredible. It has a sweet/tangy combo similar to an asian flavor but all it's own. No substitutions in ingredients but my chicken tenderloins were a touch frozen so they came out incredibly moist, almost like I meant to do that!

I modified this recipe, adding about 1 Tablespoon Dijon with the balsamic, a clove of minced garlic with the onion, 1/2 cup of apricot preserves, and 1 can canned apricot halves, drained and quartered.  This came together pretty quickly, and I think I'll serve it again soon!

family loved this of course I tweaked it a little based off other reviews and my families taste but it was a hit and easy to make this will be a repeat in our book! Love the mustard adding during the chicken browning and we added red pepper flakes to give it kick and have even left out the chunks of fruit all together an just use the preserves especially if you use apricot and pineapple preserves its sweet enough and spicey with the red pepper flakes and dont forget to add extra balsamic and chicken broth so you have plenty of the sauce for left overs

I made this dish for my husband who is very picky--- he loves complex flavors.  This dish was very easy to make.  I did two things differently-- I added more fresh apricots, all sliced in halves.  In order to cut down on the sweetness I used only a very large dollop of preserves as opposed to a full cup and I added 5 cloves, the cloves chopped in large pieces.  I also let the liquid reduce to an almost glaze-like finish.  Was fab!  Over rice pilaf, served w/ French cut green beans and this was a hit.

This did not turn out very well for me. It had a bit of a funky flavor, perhaps I did not allow the vinegar to cook long enough?

Delicious!!! After reading reviews - the only change I made was to add one tablespoon of dijon mustard to take away the overly sweet comments.  It was perfect.  Great recipe.

Easy to make and yummy flavor, but I agree with other reviewers; it is much too sweet so apricot preserves in half (at least) and I also think half as many dried apricots would have been plenty.  I also brined the chicken for an hour in the fridge before cooking, to keep it moist.

This was very tasty!  I went way off track so it's hard to really review but all the flavors were wonderful together!  I didn't use the apricot preserves because I didn't have any so I used 1 cup applesauce with a T of strawberry preserves.  I sprinkled some cayenne over the chicken along with salt/pepper for heat.   I don't know why but the texture of my meat was not great; it had a texture of boiled meat, like there wasn't enough oil in the sauce.  Although I did brown it first in evoo.  Wish I knew why that happens with breast meat sometimes.  Maybe with thighs that wouldn't have happened. My hubby and I would most definately eat this again but it was not something the boys even wanted to try!..

This was absolutely AWESOME! I let it boil a little longer after all the ingredients were in so that it would thicken. We had this with yams and curried cauliflower. Would also be good with rice. Excellent and easy!

We had this for dinner tonight.  It was certainly easy.  I cut the recipe in half and the two of us ate it all.  I served it with pasta since it had the good sauce which I'd had to use "spreadable" apricot jam rather than preserves.  I doubt that makes much difference.

I really enjoyed this dish.  I do however tend to like sweet and salty/savory together.  It was really easy to make and had a great blend of flavor.  It reminded me of a dish I had at a delicious morrocan restaurant.  If you don't like sweet sauces however, this probably isn't the dish for you.

Fantastic! I just made this for a dinner party and got rave reviews. The only change I may have made would be to maybe marinate the chicken in some of the vinegar and maybe some evoo and thyme before cooking so it could really pick up the flavors. The sauce was great, but I felt the chicken was little bland.

This was very nice.  Too sweet the first time I followed the recipe exactly.  Now I cut the preserves down to 1/4 cup and increase the balsamic.  I doubled the onion and used dry thyme.  The chicken was so tender!

The chicken came out nice and tender but the dish itself was very watery -- to much juice. Too many apricots, too. The dried apricots and the preserves makes this dish VERY sweet. Would not make again.

This was great and I would definitely make it again. The flavor is very, very rich, so it is best with mild sides, like plain rice.  It was a little watery, which is my only real negative.  Everyone at dinner enjoyed it a lot.

With a few tweaks, this recipe came out great! To reduce the sweetness of the original recipe, I added a little dijon mustard into the balsamic vinegar and upped the amount of vinegar to 1/3 cup. I also reduced the amount of jam to 1/2 cup. Yummy!

This is a great, easy recipe that my family loves. It reminds me of sweet and sour pork/chicken/etc...I don't usually have fresh thyme so I leave it out and it still tastes wonderful. I also cut up all of the apricots so that there is a more even distribution of them throughout the dish.

I gave this recipe a 4 stars due to it needed some thing, it was a bit sweet for my liking so next time I will cut back on preserves and spice it up with a little ginger. I'm sure that the ginger will be good in it. Thanks, Happy Cooking.

Pretty good as written, but I left out the optional onions. I'm glad, because they had no business in this recipe. Needed a little something, so the second time I added some cayenne pepper, used skinless bone-in chicken, and baked in the oven @ 350, basting occasionally. Cover with foil to keep the sauce from burning. My hubby likes to buy different kinds of balsamic vinegar, so I used some that had figs in it. That was awesome.

Vrey good recipe. The balsamic vinegar gives it tang, while the apricots give it sweetness. Served over rice or pasta, this dish will please the whole family.

Hubby thought this was pretty good, even went back for thirds. I did use peaches instead of apricots because that is what I had on hand. Next time I will try it with the apricots, I'm sure that will be even better.

This was good.  The apricot was a nice flavor.  I added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce up a little before serving.  Coating the chicken in it before cooking would work well too.

This was easy to make and quite tasty. My picky husband even loved it. I had to tell him to try it with a bite of apricot and chicken together and he looked at me like I was crazy, but he tried it and said he'll be eating the leftovers for lunch :)...He doesn't usually like leftovers. I made wild rice and sting beans to go with it. Mmmm.

The family LOVED this and it couldn't have been any easier!  I used cornstarch in a little bit of water to thicken the sauce and I added 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar and 1 teaspoon dried thyme. A definite keeper!

This recipe was not very good in my humble opinion.  I thought it was too sweet even though I cut the jam in half and used jam for diabetics (no added sugar).  I also felt something was missing from the recipe.  The chicken cut into pieces was also a bit much.  I think if the chicken breasts were left whole, browned, and then braised in the sauce, it might be better both flavor and presentation-wise.  I wonder if it would be better with added sliced carrots and/or red bell pepper, while cutting down on the amount of dried apricots.  I also wonder if adding some cumin, cayenne, and maybe a small amount of cinnamon might give the sauce a warmer, more complex profile to balance the sweetness.

Love this and so does the boyfriend, so its a win for us! I do add an extra splash of balsalmic, but make it as written otherwise. Served over rice with the sauce is heavenly. Definitely a quick, straightforward staple.

Complete yes!  I did reduce the apricot jam to about 1/3 of a cup and I wouldn't have wanted it sweeter than that.  I loved the taste and texture of the dried apricots and they really added something to the dish.  There was probably too much chicken broth because it was still swimming in sauce, so maybe I'd only use 1/2 cup next time.  It would still cook the chicken but be less "soupy".

I made the recipe as written but used sugar free apricot preserves and  a tbsp of dried thyme instead of fresh thyme.  The reviews suggested thickening the broth so I decided to add 4 fresh carrots cut in chunks and I prepared a package of black beans and rice which I added to the chicken to create a complete meal.  Outstanding flavors!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I  made  this  recipe  with  too many  changes  due to  what  I  had  on hand  and being  too lazy  to  go  to  the  grocery  store.  What I  will  say is that, although  I  used  orange  marmalade  instead  of  apricot preserves which  completely  changed  the  flavor, next time  I  make  this  recipe  the proper  way, I will  eliminate  the  preserves. Despite  my  use of a  different  fruit preserve, I  believe  that  the  dish was too sweet  and  overpowered  the  taste  of  the  balsamic  vinegar.

I reviewed the recipe and comments and made some alterations as I usually do, everything worked well. Added garlic flakes and cayen pepper flakes. Used Turkish semi-dried apricots and a can of apricot halves. Added black olives to complement the sweetness (worked really good). I think original recipe might be too sweet or bland without changes. Rice and flatbread are recommended.

We loved this dish with adjustments suggested by others. I added more balsamic vinegar, only half a cup of apricot preserves and a couple of  canned Jalapeño pepper wheels for heat. We loved it this way and can't wait till we have it again.

To reduce the sugar, I used fresh peaches and pureed them as a substitute for the jam. Added a couple of cloves of garlic as well. Recipe claims 8 servings, however 6 gave me about cup's worth. Added a side of steamed broccoli to make a low calorie meal. Pretty tasty.  I'll make it again.

Delicious! Easy!  I serve it over rice with green beans and a baked potato.  Would have been really good with a salad too instead of green beans. added a scoop more of the apricot preserves.  I will definitely make it again!

This was excellent! I followed other reviews and cut the preserve in half. Glad I did (only because I am not big on sweetness), I used fresh sage as I had no thyme on hand. And right before serving, I added a bit of flour and water to thicken sauce just a little. I think this recipe really calls for your own personal touch. People that like sweetness could add more preserve or even add a touch of balsamic reduction for those that dont. Great recipe!

Great recipe, added more balsamic than instructed, because I love balsamic!  The apricots were a bit too sweet so I may try to use fresh ones next time.  Other than that it was really nice.

There was some potential, but the recipe calls for far too much apricot preserve and too much thyme. Very sweet, the thyme was very over powering.  If you mess with the recipe a little, this could be a decent meal.

I accidentally used orange marmalade! I skipped the apricots at that point and added fresh garlic and salt because it was REALLY sweet. It came it amazing still but I will make again with apricot. i think it will be a bit less sweet

I made this recipe this evening and it was delish. Served it with the large pearl couscous. I did not have dried apricots so I used fresh ones instead and no preserves. In addition to the balsamic vinegar, added some  fig vinegar for a bit more fruity flavor. I also finished it with a 1/4 cup of heavy cream added at the end.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used thighs instead of breasts, and I left out the apricot preserves, thyme and parsely.  It was excellent!  I think it would've been way too sweet with the preserves.  Will definitely make it again.

Very good and rich.  I used Ikea's lingonberry jam instead of apricot preserves because that's what I had on hand.  Even though it was good, I'm not entirely sure I would make it again.  Can't quite pinpoint why...

This was good.  It did not have quite enough apricot flavor for me, but I am totally willing to try it again.
