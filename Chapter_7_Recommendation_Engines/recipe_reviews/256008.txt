This is a good recipe. If you like  crispy veggies, you will enjoy this. If you prefer them a bit softer, saut√© them before adding the eggs and milk. My eggs were small so, I used three instead of two without changing any other ingredients. These were even better once topped with hot sauce and avocado then stuffed inside a tortilla. Don't think these are just for breakfast; they make a great dinner too!

I liked it. I didn't have jalapeno pepper nor onion powder, and I even was out of black pepper. So I wasn't blown away, not sure if it was due to lack of ingredients, or due to the cumin. I would give it a second try.
