This is one of the best gingersnaps I have ever made! Easy, classic and delicious. These would be the perfect addition to anyone's holiday cookie tray!  But they are wonderful any time of the year too! I definitely will make these again. Thanks for sharing such a yummy recipe!

I only made one change--I used 1/4 cup butter in place of part of the shortening. Everything else was exactly the same. Baked at 350*, these were done at eight and a half minutes. I loved how this dough needed NO refrigeration. They baked up beautifully and look just like something you'd buy from a bakery. While the cookies were baking, I flashed back to when my grandmother would bake me gingersnaps and bring them to me at work because she knew they were my favorite. Delicious cookie with wonderful memories. Very happy with this recipe.

These cookies were AMAZING. The ginger flavor was perfect as was the texture. The bottom was almost caramelized but not super hard and the top was soft and chewy. I am going to have a hard time giving these away for the holidays. They are a major winner!

My hubby loves gingersnap cookies and my daughter and I had SO much fun making these! Unlike a lot of gingersnap cookies these are firm w/o being hard as a rock! Awesome recipe and since the batch we made this past weekend is nearly gone already, we'll probably be making them again soon :)

This really is a perfect ginger snap, better than on made by an expensive restaurant. Put two together with vanilla ice cream between and it is perfection!
