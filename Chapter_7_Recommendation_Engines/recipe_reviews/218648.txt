Like Lori, I came on here looking for Balela salad after trying it at Trader Joe's.   I agree that this is far better, although theirs was good enough to inspire me to find a recipe!

I'm not normally an ingredient snob, but this recipe demands the best ingredients possible.   Grape tomatoes generally have more flavor than typical store bought tomatoes, so that is not an area I would skimp on by using diced tomatoes (or egad! canned!).  It takes a few extra minutes to half those grape tomatoes, but well worth it, in my view. 

Use the best olive oil you can find.  I might roll my eyes at that suggestion in another recipe, but for this one, your choice of oil is going to make a difference.  Trader Joe's California olive oil was my choice for this.  It has a strong, fresh, peppery flavor that complements the other ingredients perfectly.  

I suggest you make it exactly as written before changing anything.   The feta cheese suggestion sounds tempting, but this recipe is so well balanced I would hesitate to modify anything.  Perhaps offer it on the side?

This is a great and quick recipe with lots of flavor. When I make it again, I will use red onions for more pop in flavor. I added an additional tablespoon of lemon juice and feta cheese this time around. Yum!

Yum! This dish was fantastic. The flavors tasted so fresh and blended with each other perfectly. I used all fresh veggies and herbs from my garden and it was so easy and fast to throw together.

Like some others, I tried this recipe after having Trader Joe's Balela Salad. This recipe is not exactly the same (Trader Joe's uses sumac spice) but is very tasty and I will make it again. I made this without the jalapeno and was happy with the result.

This salad was delicious.  Next time I will add a little more lemon juice and finely chopped tomatoes (or even a can of diced tomatoes) instead of halving grape tomatoes.

Absolutely delicious! Don't change a thing and remember that this just isn't a salad where you can substitute canned tomatoes or dried herbs and get the same flavor, fresh is the only way to go here on the veggies and herbs. Thanks for sharing this one!

Perfect as is! I hold the tomatoes out until I am ready to eat the salad.  That way it lasts longer in the refrigerator.

I loved the ease of this recipe! I think I would use another white bean next time, and only one can of garbanzo. I am eating this for lunch this week. Would be great wth feta cheese.

This is fantastic! I used less mint than was called for (only because I didn't have enough), did an extra tblsp of lemon juice and used a serrano pepper instead of a jalape√±o because I like the flavor of serranos better. I think next time I will add another serrano but overall this is a great dish, fast, easy, and delicious.

I recently took this to a potluck picnic at a winery.  It was gone quickly, everyone loved it.  I skipped the onion as I am not a fan of raw onion, and it wasn't missed.  I substituted a serrano chile pepper as my jalepeno was very mild, and I did serve feta on the side as an option as Kevin suggested. The feta was a nice complement.  I did like having it on the side as I think it could have gotten a bit liquified if it was in the salad all day.  I also used fresh herbs and spices and good olive oil. It was a huge hit, everyone asked for the recipe.  This is easy to pull together and a crowd pleaser.

What a fabulous salad. So refreshing.  I didn't have any garbanzos so I used white beans.  They were a good substitute.  So easy to make and such a zingy flavour.  100%.

Freshly eaten, this is probably a 5 star salad in flavor.  Eaten a day or two later and it tastes pretty poor.

So easy to make! I live on this stuff. I use just a tablespoon of oil to lighten it up. I sometimes throw a few olives in.

This is better than the Balela Salad I bought at Trader Joe's! I did not include jalapeno (none on hand) but I used plenty of fresh ground pepper. I also think this salad is even better on the second day. I'll definitely make again!

I cannot stop eating this!! First came across this salad via Trader Joe's. While theirs is good...I think this one is better. Heard someone mention that TJ's has sumac in it...I think the fresh lemon is a comparable flavor without having to have something new in my cupboard. Perfect compliment to a summery dinner, but equally delicious on its own. Glad this makes a decent sized batch!!

I came looking for this recipe after tasting a sample (and ultimately purchasing some) at Trader Joe's. I love the summery freshness of this salad and it's even better the next day after the flavors have a chance to meld. You definitely want to use fresh, not dried, parsley and mint. I liked the combination of the apple cider vinegar and lemon juice for the vinaigrette; however, I added a little liquid stevia (stevia is very concentrated so use cautiously) to balance the tartness. You could also use sugar or honey if you're not diabetic. As a matter of personal preference I didn't use or miss the jalapeno pepper. I also substituted Campari tomatoes (but wouldn't used canned) instead of grape and about a teaspoon of the refrigerated garlic paste instead of garlic cloves because that's what I had on hand. I saw where some substituted another bean for the garbanzo but I think the texture of the garbanzo adds a lot to this recipe. Last of all I added about 4 oz. of feta cheese. THIS IS SO GOOD!! For a truly Mediterranean meal I've even happily eaten it for breakfast or brunch with sardines or leftover fish! It's light but very satisfying and palate pleasing.

Delicious! I peeled my garbanzo beans, not , sure if that makes a difference or not...i just recently started to explore cooking Mediterranean foods. I also halved the recipe and left the seeds out of my jalapeno! I love the tangy flavor, might add some cumin next time that i saw in another recipe!

I really enjoyed this. The only changes I made was that I used a red onion (what I had on hand) and 1/2 of a jalapeno pepper.  Next time I think I will use the whole pepper, it wasn't overly hot.  I did not bother to blend the oil, lemon juice, etc, just poured it over and mixed.  One of the beauties of this is it can lend itself to add ons such as chicken, turkey, place it on a bed of greens, etc.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I got quite excited about the ingredients and made it well enough in advance so the flavours would have time to mingle. I tossed it again before we ate  and all I can say is lacklustre. I don't know how you can go wrong with the directions. Even the next day it still was lacking. Not one to waste food, my husband wouldn't help me finish it off the next day! Lol!

I have made this salad several times following the recipe as written.  It is a hit with my family and I will be making it many more times.  It is really good on top a regular garden salad. Plus, it is very pretty!

This was excellent !! Followed basic recipe with the following small changes:  used red onion, orange pepper for color, doubled the dressing and added small amount of Saracha for just a tiny kick.  Brought this to a potluck and knew it would sit out so finding something w/o mayo was a plus. Made it early in the day so flavors would blend, turning it over occasionally so all the beans could soak up the dressing. Will definitely be a keeper

This was good but seemed to be missing something. That or the bean to tomato-herb combo was off - too many beans? I think adding more herbs like basil or cilantro would make it better and doubling the garlic and maybe just a pinch of sugar.

This Salad is good. I added The spice sumac to it. Next time I make it I am only going to add one can of black beans. Also increased the garlic to 3 cloves instead of 1

I substituted the mint for cilantro since I‚Äôm not very fond of mint. Still tastes just as fresh with a nice kick of flavor. It‚Äôs my first time every making/eating this before and i will definitely be making this again!

Originally found this salad at Trader Joes and loved it.  This one is easy to make and is actually better.  Added 1 can quartered artichoke hearts in water, drained and then chopped.  Chopped the jalape√±o and added directly to salad as well.  Missed the part where you are supposed to blend it with the evoo, acv and lemon juice.  Will try it again with the blended dressing and see if that helps to bring out the jalape√±o flavor.  This is a nutritious and flavorful salad.  Excellent for meal by itself or for a side with your choice of protein.  Great for potlucks too.

Like many others, I found this when looking for a copycat recipe for the stuff from Trader Joe's my husband liked so much. He says this is better! Followed the recipe exactly and couldn't be more pleased.

This is delicious!  I made it exactly as written except I did not add onions because my daughter has a sensitivity to them.  It is so tasty!!  I may add some other beans next time and I love the idea of some feta too.

This is a keeper for sure!

I have had this ear-marked for some time now.   Opted to make it today knowing I didn't have fresh mint on hand. I used dried mint.   The changes I made: I reduced the amount of vinegar as I am not a lover of a strong vinegar taste and I salted the bean mixture; instead of  the dressing mixture.   Changes I will make in the future:  I will use red onion instead of yellow onion, definitely fresh mint, and I will probably added either black olives or kalamata olives.   Other reviews suggested avocado, corn, feta, etc....all good options as well.  A keeper in my kitchen!

I made it today.  My beans were cooked in my Instant Pot. I didn‚Äôt have Garbonzo beans, so I used white beans instead. This was a very simple  and healthy. My kids loved it! I‚Äôll be packing it in their lunch tomorrow.

This salad is delicious.  I really enjoyed the dressing. Made this for lunch for the week. I kept the components separate in the fridge and put together the night before. Did not add dressing (2tbsp) until right before eating. After the first day, I did add quinoa to it so it would be more filling. This will definitely be part of our regular lunch rotation.

I decided to halve this recipe as I have never made anything with mint, and there‚Äôs only two of us. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. My husband really enjoyed it as he‚Äôs been to Morocco, but for me I thought it might be missing an ingredient. It wAs still refreshing to have with grilled chicken.

I love this!  Sometimes I just put the chopped garlic and jalape√±o directly into the dish without blending it.  This tastes better after marinating in the fridge a few hours or overnight, but eat at room temperature.

Delicious and satisfying!  Make sure to use fresh not dried herbs and fresh not canned tomatoes.  I added a red bell pepper that i had sitting around and needed to be used.  Gave it a nice punch of color!  I also added a teaspoon of Sumac spice which is usually present in Mediterranean food.

My husband and I love this salad! He is very sensitive to anything spicy so the first time I made it, I left out the jalape√±o and added a couple drops of hot sauce. It was good but lacked pizzazz. The second time I used chili infused olive oil in place of plain olive oil. It gave it the kick it needed but was not overtly spicy. Hubby was fine with it. I also added feta cheese. That just put it over the top!

Note that, at 1:2, the  RATIO of oil to acid (lemon + vinegar) is the OPPOSITE of standard.  I ignored this at my peril and wound up compensating with a little more oil and two large avocados, diced.  As for other changes, I added two peppers and a cuke, substituted scallions for onion.  I will make this again, however with a MUCH MORE CONVENTIONALLY BALANCED  dressing.

Refreshing, unique and flavorful.  I thought it had too much lemon but my husband thought it was just the right amount.  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding an additional half of a jalapeno for some additional kick.  It took longer than I anticipated to make.

Very easy to make! Topped it with shrimp for extra protein too.  May try basil instead of the mint next time too!  Could even see switching the onion to red onion.  I made of the dressing for marinade for the shrimp and any other salads I make this week!

Very lovely, fresh tasting salad. I made this for a potluck and not a scrap was left. Enjoyed by all. I did leave out the jalapeno.

Wonderful summer supper! Made it as is! Later times added kalamata olives and feta cheese also good. This definitely goes into the rotation!

Loved this recipe and so did my coworkers. It was especially helpful for those who are vegetarian and/or allergic to gluten because they often get forgotten when it comes to potlucks. I added maybe a 1/4 tsp of ground ginger, turmeric and cinnamon to the dressing. I don't know why--it just tasted right to do so. Thank you!

Wouldn't change a thing.  Lots of flavor, some of the juice sinks to bottom, so I dumped salad into another bowl after a few hrs to get the juice to the rest of the beans.  
I made half the recipe, and still was a big bowl full.
The jalapeno didn't make it spicy, added great flavor.
 So good.  Loved it.

This was delicious!  I made it for a church dinner and there was none left!  The only change I made was adding one extra tablespoon of lemon juice.  This goes into my "fix again" file.

Great recipe!  I did add twice the garlic as well as garlic salt in place of regular salt.  Also - I used a little bit of cayenne pepper instead of regular pepper.  Super tasty!

So nice with the fresh parsley, mint and tomatoes. I made it both with and without the jalapeno, and it works either way though I prefer it with.

This was really good. Right after I made this, I was like how did this get 5 stars, the dressing was so overpowering? BUT after it sat in my refrigerator overnight and even the 2nd day it was oh I need to go get more ingredients and make this again. Even my son liked it on day 2. Thank you for sharing!

I made this salad for a large social gathering and anyone who tried it enjoyed it thoroughly! It was simple to prepare! I highly recommend this salad for warm outdoor events and those who like salads without meat.

I thought this turned out almost exactly like the Trader Joes variety.   I cooked the chickpeas first instead of using canned.  Next time I would double the dressing.

Loved it ! Healthy, has a little kick to it ! Will definitely do it again ! Keep it in the refrigerator at least a half an hour to allow the flavours to blend ! Great side dish, or just good on its own !

Very good! Added cucumbers and some sliced feta. Didn't have any mint, so I substituted with dill and chives.

I made a version of this for a 4th of July party and it got eaten up pretty fast. It was a pretty mixture, and I hanged it by adding an extra T of vinegar, 2 chopped stalks of celery (that I would have subbed for a cucumber if I had it, but it needed a crunch) I would use a red onion instead of white next time. I also used a half of a tomato cut up with the seeds removed because I don't like cherry tomatoes.

Pretty good- I did add Greek yogurt to the dressings that was a great success. Also the jalape√±o I used was REALLY spicy so I added a chopped up apple to the salad to help sweeten it a bit and it was a great addition!
