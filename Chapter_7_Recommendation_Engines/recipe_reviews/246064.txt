My family really enjoyed this recipe.  We didn't have any french-fried onions on hand; I think they will be a nice addition next time!  I sauteed some  yellow onion along with the other veggies.  
I find the carrots and celery take longer to cook to my preferences so I start with cooking them first.  After a few minutes, I added the chopped onion (used in place of french-fried onions).  For the final minute, I added the red pepper, which I had  almost minced.   
I forgot that I was supposed to add the seasonings to the rice and instead added it to the sauteed veggies and then stirred in the rice.  This worked well too.  It was an excellent flavor.

This extremely versatile rice dish is colorful and packed with flavor. As the submitter said, you can change it up for Mexican, Indian or other cuisines that you could imagine. I tried it with cumin and it worked well. I served this with crushed red pepper on the side for those that wanted a little heat. Thank you Patty.

Great recipe, great flavor. Only change I made was use olive oil. Oh and a great way to sneak more veggies in. I did mine a relative small dice.

This is a great way to dress up rice - the celery and fried onions give it a nice crunch. I didn't have red pepper or grapeseed oil, but I did throw in a splash of chicken broth and some seasoned salt. Yum!

Really easy to make and delicious. The crispy onions are a nice touch and add extra texture. I didn't change a thing.

This was so easy and the perfect side dish for my fresh salmon cakes.  I used a medley of yellow, orange, & red mini peppers along with the carrots and celery and added a few green onions.   The crunch of the fried onions gave great contrast in texture to the rice.  It was even better with a few shakes of cholula once plated.  Thanks for the recipe!
