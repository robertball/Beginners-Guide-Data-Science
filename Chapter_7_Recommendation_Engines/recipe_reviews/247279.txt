I made two different meatloaf's in the smoker yesterday with this being one of them. The meatloaf itself in this one was by far the better one however I found the sauce lacking compared to the other one. On that note, I recommend replacing the ketchup with hot sauce and then adding some red pepper flakes to boot.
