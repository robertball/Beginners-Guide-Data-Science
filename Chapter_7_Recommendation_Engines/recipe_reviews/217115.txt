This is a great recipe. I didn't have orange juice so used the juice from the pineapple, added enough water to make the amount of liquid required and it turned out fine.

It's a fun recipe and the batter was nice and light. I used fresh pineapple but my pieces were a bit too large, I'll have to be careful next time.

I mashed the banana - chopped the pecan really fine - the family loved it!

I used my own homemade whole wheat pancake mix which meant I had to add a little more orange juice (quarter cup) to compensate for the extra liquid-sucking power that is whole wheat flour. To prevent overmixing, I folded the banana, pecans and coconut into the dry mix and wisked together the wet ingredients in a seperate bowl and just gently combined the dry into the wet. We thought this pancake recipe was GREAT--we loved it. NO leftovers. Great way to use random overripe bananas.

I made a gluten free pancake mix, and used sunflower seeds instead of pecans.  We loved these moist, tropical flavored pancakes!

These were pretty good. We all agreed that the OJ taste was a little overwhelming. Next time I might try to do half OJ half water or something like that to cut down on the bitter/acidic OJ.

The pancakes are nice and a good change from your typical pancakes, but I did feel that changes are needed. The OJ taste overpowers the other flavors, so I would dilute the OJ (1/2 OJ and 1/2 water as another reviewer suggested). Also, I didn't get much coconut flavor and I added the full 1/4 cup as called for--maybe I'll try using sweetened coconut flakes or coconut extract next time as I was really hoping to get nice coconut flavor. As written, three stars is appropriate but the above changes would certainly put these pancakes into my family's rotation of weekend treats. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Served with whipped topping and garnished with toasted coconut. Perfect for breakfast on the patio.

I made these for my kids, who are pancake fanatics, and they were a total bust. They hated the orange juice and they all said they tasted too much banana. I'm sorry. I really wanted to like this one!
