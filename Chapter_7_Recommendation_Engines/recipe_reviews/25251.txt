Excellent recipe - the celery and onion added even more flavor than I thought they would (although I did make the recipe the night before and reheated it the next day while the turkey was resting, so that could account for the extra flavor throughout).  The leftovers made superb potato cakes.

I found this recipe looking for something to do with celery hearts. Very good vegetarian meal. I just ate a bigass heap of this with some corn on the cob. The gravy is delicious and creamy, and the celery and onions give the taters a great flavor. I added some garlic and pepper to the gravy. Zang!

This was a really tasty recipe and a great change from the ordinary mashed potatoes.  I served it with grilled pork chops (using my secret of marinating the chops in chinese oyster sauce for several hours) and my husband is still talking about it!!!  Thanx!!!

Wow is all I can say. I was looking for a different mashed potato recipe. Tonight I wanted to make meatballs so I decided to change the cream gravy slightly by using beef broth instead of chicken. I made the potatoes and then warmed the meatballs in the cream gravy. My 4 children loved the dinner and said, "you should make this every night!" So, so good!

I didn't get the celery sauteed enough, so it was still a little crunchy in the potatoes, but even still, my kids who don't like mashed potatoes OR gravy, loved this and couldn't stop eating it!

I'm a mashed potato purist -- meaning I don't like stuff like sour cream or cheese mixed in :) -- but the celery changed changed up the dish without covering up the potato taste. I'll definitely make it this way from now on!

I only used to gravy recipe and really liked it. I added a bit more flour as we like a little thicker gravy. Served over mashed potatoes and chicken fried chicken. Also had fresh sweet corn..so good. This gravy reminds me a lot of KFC's gravy. Yum!

This is absolutely delicious. I like to add some garlic and a little more celery and celery salt than called for to the potatoes. The gravy is just lovely - suprising how such a  flavorable gravy can be made so simply.

I made this for my boyfriend last night and he told me I was the BEST cook EVER!! 
I served it with oven-baked chicken tenders and the match was PERFECT!!
I loved cooking this recipe as it was super easy and quick to prepare!!

It's okay. It didn't taste as different from regular mashed potatoes as I was expecting.
