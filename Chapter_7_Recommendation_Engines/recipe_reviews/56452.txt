My children weren't ecstatic about this, though I liked it well enough. You have to be careful with the chicken breast because if it overcooks it is dry regardless of how much liquid you cook with it. Making it again I would pound the breasts, salt, pepper and flour them and then cook them over high heat for a few minutes per side until done. Then I'd remove them from the heat and use the rest of the ingredients to make a sauce for topping the breasts.  Cooking the breasts in the sauce was tricky:  trying to get the apples cooked as well as the raisins and apricots soft without overcooking the chicken was more than I want to hassle with. But then I am pretty picky about overcooking chicken.

I made this with the duck sauce recipe on this site and it was delicious.  The chicken was very tender!!

It's a very sweet recipe, and i hoped it to be a bit more spicy.
Other then that, it's very delicious.
I made it with chunks of chicken breast instead of hole ones

Very interesting recipe. I added banana(one sliced up), coconut(about a 1/4th cup), & sugar(about 1/4th cup). I mixed the sauce ingredients separately before adding to the chicken. I pounded the breasts, but only used 3, the 1.5 lbs package. Cut those in half after cooking which took about 30 minutes. I also used butter instead of oil. Very moist. Only thing i will do differently next time is egg and flour the chicken to give it a nice coating. Great with rice, put some coconut on the rice too.   I only rated this 4/5 because of the adjustments. I did not like the sauce before making the adjustments.

I followed the recipe but my fiance and I did not like the flavor at all.  Unfortunately this resulted in ordering take out.

Due to time constraints I wasn't able to make my own duck sauce but I found some at the grocery store already made instead.  I added extra sauce and fruit and served it over steamed vegetables and brown rice.  Even my friend's 2 year old liked it!!

Definitely different, but pretty good.
