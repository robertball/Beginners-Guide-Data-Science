This shortcake to me was a HUGE disappointment. I generally prefer strawberry shortcake that is on a more biscuit-y bread, but this shortcake was dry, and lacked any flavor. The topping was good, but it's hard to miss on that because it's pretty standard. I am giving this only one star because I think the bread of the shortcake really makes or breaks it, and this seriously broke it! I wonâ€™t be making this again.

I loved this recipe!  I followed it to the letter, except my berries were so sweet that I skipped mixing them with sugar.  Super easy and it looks very classy and elegant.  I will definitely make this again!

Love it! Perfect sweetness in the shortcake portion. I opted to skip the extra sugar to coat the strawberries since the berries we had were very sweet as is. After it was all assembled though, I did sprinkle the berries on the top with less than a tblsp of sugar. Everyone loved this and it makes a very pretty presentation!

Very easy and delicious.  It was nice not to roll dough.  The only problem was that it didn't seem to rise enough to cut in half, so I just did it in one piece.  I used cream cheese instead of sour cream though, and I'm not sure if that affected it.  I will definitely make it again though.

The vanilla cream was really good but the shortcake tasted like a big biscuit.  It wasn't bad just not cake like which is what I wanted.  Next time I'll use a pound cake with the vanilla cream filling from this recipe.

This was great! I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and we loved it. The shortcake part isn't too sweet (I'd probably add a tiny bit more sugar to that next time) but it balanced out nicely with the rest of the ingredients. I'll definitely make it again!

I make the shortcake portion of this recipe (and have to remind myself everytime to only use 1/2 cup milk!) I've always made shortcake "biscuits" like my mom; when I stumbled on this recipe and gave it a shot, WOW! It's my go-to recipe now. Easy, and I love the inclusion of sour cream. I sprinkle granulated sugar on top of the cake before baking. Though not a traditional "shape" for shortcake in my family, the taste is gaining acceptance. I serve wedges of shortcake with slightly mashed and sweetened berries and a touch of whipped cream. No pudding for us -- that's a bit too far out of my comfort zone. *Grin*

this was very good. Served it at Easter dinner and everyone loved it.  The only thing I would do differently is use more vanilla pudding to make it a little more flavorful and moist.

A big hit with the family!  I enjoy a biscuit strawberry shortcake more then the pound cake type, and this fits the bill!

This is sensational.  I changed from instant vanilla pudding t regular and do not make into a cake.  Instead I put together on demand ti keep the biscuit from getting soggy.  The topping is more like a vanilla sauce and tastes awesome.  everyone in my family liked this version better than the stiffer vanilla filling.

This was exactly the kind of recipe I was looking for.  Easy to make but super tasty!  I cooked the cake in two loaf pans because I couldn't find my round pans.  It turned out perfect and was easy to just slice up.  I also chopped up my strawberries instead of doing slices and before putting the top layer of cake down I put a layer to coolwhip on the bottom of the top layer to keep the layers together better.  I hope you enjoy this recipe as I know this will be added to my recipe book and made many more times.

My family LOVES this recipe!  We really like the flavor that pudding adds.  Traditional shortcake is usually dry and, in my opinion, kind of bland; but this delicious!
