Good recipe for people on an extremely tight budget.  I was surprised by the taste.  I thought ramen flavor packet would make it unbearably salty, but it came out fine.  Instead of vegetable oil and snap peas, I used olive oil and regular frozen peas.  I also added cheddar cheese and olives and left out the red onions since I didnâ€™t have any.

This was good, but I must have cooked too much pasta because I didn't have enough sauce.  My salad was a little drier than I prefer.  I will make again though, just reduce the pasta some.  Since you need the Ramen sauce pack to make the sauce I can't really double it easily.

Turned out great! I doubled this recipe for a picnic.  I added a little seasme oil and some seasme seeds.  I also used the packaged shredded brocolli blend because the store was out of carrots. I also used the frozen peas because I had them on hand.

While this was a definitely a tasty dish, I would have preferred the dressing to have been more substantial.  It was very mild and just slightly sweet.  Next time I would try adding a thicker asian-type dressing, or try to doctor up the original dressing with some spices.

The recipe ingredient list calls for "ramen noodles," no particular flavor, so I bought "chicken."  I did not realize until I read step 3  that it was supposed to be "Oriental," so I adapted the dressing with what I had on hand.  I cut back a little on the vegetable oil and added a bit of both sesame and chili oils, as well as some Thai garlic chili paste.  The dressing ended up tasting wonderful with just a little pop of heat from the chili paste and chili oil.  The rotini I had on hand was multi-color and to brighten it even more, I added a little bit of sliced red bell pepper, peeled & seeded cucumber chunks, and squeezed some fresh lime juice over it.  The one thing I wasn't crazy about was the dry ramen noodles.  I think I would prefer chopped peanuts, but that just could be a personal taste preference.  Overall, a very nice pasta salad with good presentation.  Thanks, Lori, for sharing with us.

I made this for a potluck and it turned out fairly well, but I thought the dressing was missing something, but not sure what. Perhaps a bit of vinegar? Mine turned out a bit dry too because I think I had too much pasta. I used prepackaged carrot slaw instead of having to slice the carrots too. Overall, pretty good, but needs some more tweaking.

This is a flavorful pasta salad that is great for pot lucks, and when you want something light and quick.  I added some sesame seed oil to the recipe the second time I made this and I loved the addition.  I also used small shell pasta, and fresh peas, so this recipe is very versatile.

This was not as flavorful as I expected.  I have been making the coleslaw with ramen noodle dressing for years and expected this to have that flavor.  I plan to make that recipe's dressing, but use the pasta, sugar peas and carrots of this recipe in the future.
