Excellent dish.  Taste even better if a bottle of wine is consumed during preparation.

This dish is a standard in our household.  We love it with steamed broccoli, and perhaps garlic mashed potatoes.  Another reviewer is confused over the term "scallopini", which refers to the thin slices of meat used in the picatta recipe.  Once you have dredged the scallopini in seasoned flour, dip it in an egg/Parmesan cheese wash before turning it into your hot skillet.  Just brown the scallopini, don't fully cook, as you can return it for one last cook/ warm up at the end (careful not to overcook the chicken!).  If you do not have fresh chicken stock for Demi-glacing the pan, use any liquid canned chicken broth.  Reduce the broth with the lemon juice, butter, olive oil, garlic, and white wine to concentrate the flavors.  Add some fresh thyme and fresh chopped parsley to taste now (no stems).  When ready, return your scallopinis to the skillet for a final warm-up and add capers to taste.  I like lots.  Try this recipe with veal or sliced beef tenderloin also

Excellent recipe - it was delicious.  I didn't have white wine so I used chicken broth and increased the amount for sauce.  No glaze either but chopped portabella mushrooms worked well

Loved it! Didn't have mushrooms but they'd have been welcome!  I didn't think it needed lemon juice or the demi-glace.  I'll definitely be making this again! Thanks!

This dish is not new to me at all, and I have always loved it. But I've always used chicken broth wih the wine and lemon juice, never demi-glace. The demi-glace made it even better - richer, with a more full-bodied flavor.  An excellent,  solid 5-star recipe. I would just caution against cooking the chicken for 6-8 minutes on each side.  A few minutes on each side, just until the chicken turns opaque, is all this needs. Even a minute or two of overcooking can easily take this from moist and tender to tough and dry.

Fixed this tonight and loved it!!  Could not find chicken flavored demi-glace so substituted this for chicken broth.  Wonderful!  Sliced green olives would be good in place of the capers.  I will try this next time.  My favorite Italian restaurant serves a similar dish they call Chicken picata. I served this over a small portion of spaghetti.  Two large chicken breast sliced as stated and pounded is enough for four servings if you are a light eater.

I love these ingredients.  I also add artichoke hearts.  Yumm!  I also increase the ingredients for the sauce so that there's plenty for the rice.  I use chicken tenderloins, the perfect size and shape.

I make this fairly often and usually edit the steps to speed things up. I melt the shortening (butter really does taste best...) then sautee about a tsp. of minced garlic (in the jar). I don't slice open the chicken breasts: I use a rolling pin to pound the breasts between saran wrap until flattened uniformly. Dredge them in flour seasonsed w/s&p, sauteed them until golden brown, and keep warm in the oven while I sautee (canned or fresh) mushrooms, a bit of lemon juice, white wine if I have it (stock or water w/chicken bullion granuales also works), and usually a bit of flour mixed into the liquid before adding to the pan. Add capers last, then return meat to pan to meld flavors. I usually make double the sauce and serve w/either some kind of rice or some kind of pasta. Love the flavors!

Made this last night - this is a keeper.  Did not make any changes to recipe. Recipe was so simple, but elegant enough for guests or a romantic dinner.  I served it with rice pilaf and broiled asparagus drizzled with olive oil, S&P, and roasted minced garlic.  Found the demi-glace at Williams Sonoma.  pinot grigio wine was great with it.

I didn't have a problem with this. I used chicken bouillon paste (Better Than Bouillon, brand name). I think if you just pound the breasts without the surgery is fine. The recipe is good.

Made without capers & used a chicken "base" (couldn't find demi-glace).  So, so good, easy yet elegant! I'll keep looking for a demi-glace & maybe sub greek olives for capers (hubs won't eat capers but loves greek olives). Any other suggestions for a good substitute for capers?

Get out the pounder! You can also make scallopini (which simply means pancake) by putting the raw meat in a plastic bag and pounding it flat (or nearly flat).

EXCELLENT! I had to make a big quanity for my large family. We all LOVED it! The only thing different that I did was added onion with the garlic, cream & basil with the final sauce. I topped it all off with fresh grated parm. cheese.

About ten years ago I had a friend fresh out of culinary school who made this same dish and I never forgot it.  I cut thin tenders instead of butterflying the breast and added shallots in with the mushrooms.  Served with buttered bowties and my own lemon-pepper zucchini.  To those who thought the caper oil tainted the flavor of the sauce, rinse the capers before adding them to mellow things out a bit.

This one got rave reviews at my table! I can't eat garlic, so I nixed that and used a mix of regular olive oil and butter. I noticed that one other review used EVOO, but I don't ever heat EVOO. Don't like the flavor. I used chicken TENDERS sprinkled with a tiny bit of water and pounded between pIieces of wax paper, cut them in half so they were about three inches wide, dredged in Wondra flour, salt and pepper, then arranged them in the hot oil/butter. Quickly browned (2 minutes each side), then removed to a 2" deep casserole. We love mushrooms, so I increased to 8 oz. and browned them with salt and pepper. I spread the mushrooms over the chicken pieces. I did not have demi-glace, and when I went to my cupboard, I realized I did not have chicken stock. Panic! All I had was organic beef broth! My other choice was water, so I used about 1/2 cup of the beef broth, then white wine and the juice of one lemon. I poured the liquid over the chicken/mushroom and sealed with tin foil. At 350, I cooked for an additional 30 minutes, opened the foil and added the capers. Turned the oven off, but left the casserole in the oven while sauteeing leftover spaghetti in olive oil. Served the pasta on the side and had plenty of sauce to drizzle over both. This was delicious and that little bit of beef broth did not harm it in the least. Chicken was tender. My husband "yummed" all through dinner!

Outstandingly good. Didn't have any chicken glace, and didn't notice the absence. Instead, I used a little over 1/3 C white cooking wine; omitted salt in the recipe, and it all turned out great! Oh, and used 8 oz of mushrooms, not 4 oz. We ate every single one, too! Great recipe!

This was delicious.  I was stumped how to make the demi-glace from chicken broth, but gave it a try based on the recipe description.  Here is what I did: I simmered one can of chicken broth until it reduced by at least half.  I used the remaining flour after dredging the chicken and added water to make a batter-like consistency.  I probably only used about 1-2 Tbsp added to the reduced broth, heating over low to combine it until smooth & no lumps.  It was really wonderful, I will make this again for the in-laws!

This was fabulous!  It was delicious and I would make it for company.  It seemed good restaurant quality.  I could not find the chicken demiglace anywhere.  I could find beef and veal demiglace but not chicken.  Because it was getting late and I was not about to hit another store, I ended up substituting with chicken stock and a little flour.

I loved this. The flavor of the sauce was amazing. I even ate the mushrooms and I don't like mushrooms. I used extra capers because I love the flavor.  Couldn't find Demi-glacé but I used concentrated chicken stock and it worked just as well. I've made it twice so far and came out great both times.

This was incredible.  Changed a few things:  added onion, used mostly olive oil with just a little butter (the butter really adds to the flavor though), used homemade chicken broth with a bouillon cube in place of the demi glace because we didn't have any.  Served with a mashed cauliflower recipe that I found on another site, which was an excellent accompaniment to soak up the delicious sauce. Thanks!

I followed the directions with the exception of using chicken-flavored Better Than Bouillon instead of the demi-glace, as mentioned in some of the other reviews.  It was fantastic!  A huge hit with the kids, too.  We'll definitely be making this again.

If you follow the recipe, the butter burns, the garlic burns, and the sauce turns out to be an acrid watery mess! I have to admit that this is the only recipe provided by Allrecipes.com I have ever been disappointed with.

I had no idea what "chicken flavored demi-glace" was and couldn't find it at a large grocery store, so used chicken stock.  As mentioned before,  olive oil is much better than butter and more appropriate for this recipe.  Loved the capers, but cut back on the lemon juice.  Good recipe,  thanks.

This is very good, however I found it to be a little too salty.  I did not add any salt while cooking, and I used low-sodium chicken broth to make the demi-glace.  Could be that I used canned mushrooms, instead of fresh.  Otherwise, very good!

My family loved it! I used chicken broth instead of white wine (just a personal preference) and it turned out great. Very quick and easy too.

Delicious! I used EVOO and just a little butter, but otherwise followed the recipe, and it was easy and turned out great. I'd definitley make this one for company.

Have made this numerous times for something special.  It takes an extra bit of work but is well worth it.  I always called it Chicken Picata.  Never used mushrooms but might add them next time.  We have this over pasta.

I really really enjoyed this dish.  I followed the recipe as instructed.  I will definitely make this dish again.  I did not find the dish too salty but I skipped adding salt & pepper on the last step.  Next time I make this I will double the mushrooms and the juice  I served this with rice pilaf and asparagus.  I am sure we'll have this dish monthly in our house.
Update: 5/15/17: Had it for leftovers and it was even better!  Next time I will make sure to make a bigger batch.

This is an excellent recipe. I did have to do a slight substitution. In place of the Demi glacé  I used chicken soup base and cut it back to 1 tablespoon and added it to a 1/2 cup water. I let it reduce down with the other ingredients and it came out great.

Very good recipe, but it takes a bit more effort and time.  Husband really liked it.  I've made it twice.  Only complaint is not enough sauce so I increased liquid ingredients the second time.

This was very good I also used pork one time, I did not use wine once was still good and also added a couple of steps for fun. I did the flour, egg wash then seasoned panko bread crumbs before I fried in just a tad of butter and olive oil

Delicious! I didn't have the demi-glaze on hand, so I used some left over homemade chicken broth that I kicked up a notch with some chicken bouillon granules. Hubs said this one is a "do again". Served this over angel hair pasta . . . buonissimo!

Loved this recipe!  Didn't have the demi-glace so I used chicken bouillon but after reading some of the reviews I'll be looking for it.  This will be my new favorite chicken recipe!  Can't wait to try it again for company.  Thanks for sharing.

I have made this several times.  My husband absolutely loves this!  You can find the demi glacé at Amazon.  It comes in a tub and lasts forever when kept in refrig.  The brand is called More Than Gourmet.  They also have a chicken stock in a tub and this is all I use now.  It is absolutely delicious.  Can't go wrong with either one of them.

Fantastic and so much easier than I thought it would be! I didn't have time to reduce broth for demi glace, so I used veggie Better Than Bouillion, a round teaspoon worked well. I sliced the breasts into bite sized pieces, the way they serve it at Macaroni Grill, so that I didn't have to pound it. Next time I will add artichoke hearts and use less flour, as I threw out half of it.

Meh, not much to write home about on this one.  The sauce was just okay and there wasn't much of it.  If I ever made it again I would add some chicken broth to it, but I'll probably just look for a better recipe.

Awesome recipe! Thank you Strangecacti!!

Only deviation on my part...used Kerry Gold Garlic & Herb butter vs. pressed garlic and butter. And used Better than Bouillon since I didn't have demi-glace.

Never tried this technique for cooking chicken I love it. The trick is to not flip it too much or the coating falls off. Learned that one the hard way.

This is the first time I used a demi-glace and went to the store especially to get it but the sauce was sooooooo salty it could not be eaten (and I love salty food).  I didn't use the sauce and all I had left to use was a can of chicken broth and some lemon juice which I added to the mushroom and capers but that was good.  The chicken was nice and tender but I guess you have to use that demi-glace very sparingly and definitely not 2 tabelspoons! I will try it again and adjust the demi-glace.

Good recipe.  My children, ages 13 and7, along with my husband enjoyed the meal.  I served with a side of pasta.  My husband even enjoyed the left over chicken (and it is rare that he likes anything but pizza leftover).

LOVED LOVED LOVED this.  After browning Chicken pieces, Simmered in white wine and a touch if sherry for aver an hour. Covered. Prior to serving uncovered and reduced sauce.  Added capers. Placed chicken on top of platter of whole wheat spaghetti that was left over and then, when sauce reduced, poured over chicken and then served.  May be the BEST chicken Ive EVER had.  My husband loved it and I definitely will make for guests!!!!!

I used Better Than Boullion in place of Demi-glacé. It was fantastic! My family couldn’t stop raving.

YUM. Simple gourmet. If you don’t like capers, just tweak the lemon juice volume.

Delicious. Made it twice in one week! Used chicken broth instead of Demi-glacé. Need to double the sauce next time. This is a keeper.

way too much butter in this recipe lol, but loved it.. substituted some olive oil instead. Mixed garlic powder into the flour. Used chicken broth and corn starch. I guess my chicken was too thick because I was just about ready to pull it off and checked the temperature and ended up pulling the chicken out of the sauce and cooking it for about 3 minutes on med/high to get it cooked through. But everyone loved it. Placed it on a bed of rice but next time think a bed of angel hair pasta would be nice. Complimented with Caesar Salad.

Very good and easy. Will def make again.  I will leave out the lemon juice as I thought it over powered it.  I could not find the chicken deglaze so I used balsamic vinegar glaze instead.  I did not have white wine so I used chicken broth in it's place.  I doubled the sauce ingred( except the balsamic) as it did look like enough sauce and glad I did.  I also wanted it a little thicker so I used a little cornstarch to thicken it.  I used chicken cutlets and cooked 5 min on each side, then let simmer on low in sauce for 30 more min. My guests loved it.

Wow! This was good! I added fresh spinach at the end ( borrowed from another recipe) and it was fantastic! I didn't have any capers, which I do love, but didn’t miss them! Also added some thyme, didn’t have fresh, but it was still just as good!

I loved the recipe! It tasted yummy! The only change I made was  exchanging Chicken Broth for chicken-flavored demi-glace. I absolutely loved mixing the pressed garlic into the soften butter, it gave out a beautiful aroma!

Very good - thank you! If you are not sure what demi-glace is and don't want to fool around making it, Knorr makes Stock  concentrate, sold in a pack of 4 little cups.

This was very good and quick to put together. However, I used chicken tenders, so I skipped the whole filleting and pounding thin portion, although the thinner cut would probably have been even more delicious. I used "Better Than Bullion" beef flavor- 2 T hot water and 1/2t bullion for the demi-glaze.

This is a wonderful recipe!!!!  It tasted just like the one I get at Macaroni Grill!  It was work but I think next time I make it it will go much quicker!  I could not find the Demi-glace locally so I ordered it on Amazon.  Well worth the effort!!!  The whole family loved it!!!

The chicken demi-glace from Williams-Sonoma is easy to get and worth it.  I made this for a friend and I.  I never like what I've cooked and my friend only rarely eats meat.  We BOTH LOVED this dish.

I started out doubling recipe. We are a family of 5, plus 2 leftovers lunch. It was very easy to add ingredients because there wasn't a lot for this tasty dish. I used chicken broth. It worked fine.My Family loved it. My son said the mushrooms were bursting with flavor. This is our new favorite. Will be making when we have company also. Our side, was salad with Italian bread.  Whoops, there was no leftovers for lunch.

It doesn't quite like the scallopini I've had at italian restaurants, but it's not bad either. I didn't have the demi-glace but took the advice of the other users and used chicken stock instead. Some things I plan on changing for next time, instead of coating the chicken with flour just once, I plan on dipping it in an egg wash and flouring it again. Just butterflying the chicken was still too thick, for one of the chicken breast, I actually cut it into 3 layers and it was just the right thickness (after the pounding). I added more butter between the chicken and the mushroom (added more mushroom as well). I didn't add any salt to the cooked chicken (didn't understand the point). I will make it again as it was pretty easy and the chicken was very moist.

I didn't have demi glace.  I made one using chicken broth, buttter and corn starch.  I added the chicken back into the skillet, turned off heat and covered to allow flavors to develop with the chick.  I will make it again!

My first attempt was 100% successful.  Delicious!!  I did not have any glaze, used chicken broth instead.  I doubled the gravy as I was serving mash potatoes, perfection!

Saved this one to my file! Very good. I used chicken pieces, and no capers since my children don't like them. Going to be making it again soon.

Deliscious I used turkey that I sliced thin. Added a teaspoon of "Better than bullion"instead of the Demi-glaze. Used about 2T of butter and olive oil. A pound of mushrooms...they are the best part

I made this tonight using chicken tenders and chicken broth.  I thickened the sauce a little with corn starch.  What an easy and delicious meal!  This was a nice presentation on a plate with pasta and fresh green beans.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I followed the recipe as written and will look for a new one.  You can't brown the chicken in butter; the butter will burn.  You need to use oil and save the butter for the mushrooms.  There was very little sauce and it screamed LEMON when I tasted it.  Demi-glacé is not normally used in Chicken Scallopini and impossible to find in the grocery store.  It's been many years since I had to throw away a dish I just made but this was not edible.

This is awesome. I didn't have any demi-glace, so I reduced two cups of homemade chicken stock down to a half cup. In total I doubled the sauce ingredients, but next time I will triple the sauce, as my family wanted to drown everything in it.

Made this for dinner tonight...used Almond Flour in place of all purpose flower. Added 3 cloves of garlic, thyme & pinch of pepper to 1.5 cups of organic chicken stock, reduced to 1/4 cup...took off heat, added one tbs butter...delicious  demi glaze. Mixed one tablespoon butter with one tablespoon of coconut oil for sautéing chicken....didn't have parsley....finished the dish with freshly grated parm chz.  Served over zucchini noodles. It was off the hook good and low carb. Highly recommend.

Let me startby saying I had to chg the recipe only to accommodate what I had on hand!!  Otherwise I would love to try as written.  I used chicken stock instead of white wine and I didn't have a demi-glave but other than that as written.
Both my husband and I loved it definitely a keeper and will make again soon

Just made this for the first time. It was Great! This dish goes best with some Garlic Red Skin mashed potatoes. I recommend cooking the sauce separately from the chicken and then putting in the chicken after its finished cooking.

This recipe has become a staple for me. I use chicken cutlets, which saves me a bit of time, and I have a very tasty dinner prepared quickly. I serve it over angel hair pasta, which complements the dish well.

This was delicious!  I made a few changes so that it would have more even flavor. I did an egg wash after the flour then straight to the pan.  I chopped a few tomatoes to add when you add the mushrooms.  I also topped it with feta and provolone, YUM!  Thank you for the recipe!

Great -EASY - recipe!  I think the key here is the chicken broth!  I've made other scaloppini and piccata and they are always too heavy in butter or lemon.  This had the perfect balance.  I didn't quite use as much butter so there wasn't as much sauce but still good.  Best part- left over wine to drink!!!

WONDERFUL! I added a bit of garlic in step 2 and then added artichokes and baby spinach leaves into the sauce and skipped the demi-glace. I used a sauvignon blanc which worked beautifully with the flavor. Amazingly good! And my wife loved it for her birthday meal.

This recipe was good, but I did a bit of tweaking that worked well for all that ate it. I marinated the flattened chicken breasts with fresh garlic paste, old bay seasoning, pepper & seasoning salt. I then fried the chicken dredged in flour and kept aside in a pan. I fried a small onion-cut finely, mushrooms, capers, red pepper cut finely,chicken broth,lemon juice,parsley & white wine to make a sauce. I then poured the sauce over the chicken and served it with mashed potato & squash vegetable.

This was a really tasty dish!  I followed the recipe fairly closely, except had to make a "fake" demi-glace by reducing a can of chicken broth by half, then thickening with corn starch.  I used probably 3/4 cup of that in the gravy/sauce.  I used red wine instead of white because that's what I had, and it was good.  Next time I might do something to put more of a crust on the chicken.  Those were my only changes/suggestions.  Now that I've done it once, I know I can do it for company--and I will.  It was pretty straight forward, a great meal for the effort.

Excellent recipe! I'm an amateur cook, and followed everything to the letter. I might prefer a TAD less lemon juice, but that's just me. It was still incredibly flavorful and complex. If this was served to me at a restaurant, I'd be coming back for more. I have very simple tastes, and served it over mashed potatoes, along with sauteed Italian broccoli. This is DEF a keeper. Thank you!

Really like this one.  Whipped up a quick pseudo-demi glace by making a simple rue with 2 tbs butter & 2 tbs fluor then adding 1 tsp of chicken base dissolved in 2 tbs white whine. Will definitely make again!

Love it. Made it with a roux from pan scappings- could not figure out the demi glace! I added artichoke hearts to the mushrooms.

really good, I used chicken broth instead of wine and omitted the glaze and it was still amazing.
