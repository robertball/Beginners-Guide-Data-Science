This was rather decent. As the 1st review said, that the recipe wouldn't thicken..is correct. But I got it to. My chicken was pre-seasoned, so I didn't add the thyme(but I would have if it was plain-just noting that for others). My chicken was also 8oz a piece...so note to self...I will only use 3 because they were so huge, I had a lot of meat in mine.  I also used fresh minced parsley verses dried, baby bella mushrooms as well. So when it came to the step with adding mushrooms, corn starch and water, I turned the slow cooker up to high for at least 30 minutes and notice it was thickening but still liquidy. So I made a quick change when it came to the half and half. I used heavy whipping cream in it's place and ended putting all the parmesan in it at the cooking point for the step that requires mixing the noodles, half & half and Parmesan. I also used Ronzoni Garden Vegetable noodles verses plain noodles(for color & taste & no 8oz pkg of noodles were sold in my store so I used the 12oz size) It still was liquidy but not much. But as I mixed it all together in the crock..all my family wasn't home when dinner was "I thought" was ready and had to sit another 30 minutes in the crock until they arrived...by then. It was nice and thick. No runniness what so ever. I topped each plate with a little extra parm mixed with a little bread crumbs. And my hubby and children went back for 2nds and said how wonderful it was. I will make again with my modifications and use less chicken.

Made a few changes and it came out delicious...it was a little soupy at 1st but I just kept adding flour til it thickened I added the noodles into the crockpot after they cooked then turned off the crockpot n let it sit for 15 min. After that it wasn't soupy at all! I also added garlic it was wonderful. I'll be tripling the recipe for a party.

Loved this dish!  Tweaked it a bit as follows: Used 3 very large chicken breasts, used a pinot grigio, added garlic powder at end (will add fresh garlic in the beginning next time), due to time I did high for 1 hour, low for 2, and back to high when adding cornstarch and mushrooms.  Added 1 extra teaspoon of cornstarch and left on high for another hour before adding spinach fettuccini (12 oz bag).  The chicken broke up and was so tender!  The flavor was wonderful!

I may remake this but only after serious changes. I found it to be extremely soupy - even after the 3 Tbsp of cornstarch, I'm not a novice cook by any means either. I ended up needing to add another Tbsp of cornstarch and it still was rather soupy. I used baby bella mushrooms which gave it more depth and used Gallo Family Pinot Grigio - I was a bit shocked at the amount of parsley flakes and reduced it to 2 tsp. I finished cooking this in the oven - to allow the parmesan to form a topping. I think that *if* there is a next time, that I'll reduce both the chicken broth & white wine. I like the concept of this recipe but it needs improvement.

I have made this meal a couple of times. It turns out delicious. My husband does not like any type of cream sauce but he will go for seconds on this. We also add veggies other than the mushrooms & onions, like 1 green and red pepper and possibly some asparagus. I also doubled the white wine, broth and half and half for more juices, ends up coming out very creamy in the end and you always have enough juices to make sure it is not dry. If you get sick of the chicken, possibly try shrimp instead it is very good either way. Delicious recipe from the start! :) Very pleased!

The recipe shows 4 hours 20 minutes but in the body of the recipes it shows 5.  So since I was short on time.  I did as one other did and cooked on high for 1 hour, low for 2 and then back on high for the 20 minutes.  I let the noodles, cheese and 1/2 & 1/2 cook longer then the recipe called and it got nice and thick for me.  It was good but it tasted like there was something missing so I will probably add some other spices to get the taste i'm looking for.  Will probably make again.

Definitely needs to be thickened more, my kids called it soup. I also think it needs more seasoning. It was a little bland. I thought it was okay but my family didn't like it.

Turned out dry, However, that may have been my fault.. it might have been more juicy if I hadn't had to serve dinner a bit late and keep it warm in the slow cooker too long.

My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this recipe!!!  Based on the reviews, and him accidentally changing the time, it turned out perfect!  Here is what I changed.  First, I cooked it for 4 hours on low, then added the mushrooms, and I also added a bag of frozen peas.  I cooked it on high for another 2 hours.  To thicken it more, I added an extra tbsp of cornstarch, and some Wondra.  As far as the pasta, I didn't feel like saving 4oz of my 12oz box, so just cooked the whole box, added it to the crockpot, and it was FANTASTIC!  I will definitely make it again very soon!  I used pinot grigio for the white wine.

Unfortunately, this lacked flavor. We could only eat it after we added salt, pepper and garlic.

We loved it, there was only a small amount of liquid remaining before I thickened it with cornstarch, added Â½ c. half and half and lots of parmesan cheese!  The aroma was great, and the leftovers were relish too! ( I did add thin slices of red and green pepper per another's review).

I made this exactly as the recipe called for, and it turned out terrific!  My boyfriend told me to definitely keep this recipe in the rotation.  He called it "a winner"!  I am going to do this recipe again and use Tuna instead to see how that turns out!

I thought this was VERY bland. I added garlic and Italian seasonings and at the end still needed to add garlic salt and pepper and it was okay. As others mentioned it didn't thicken and I had to keep adding cornstarch. Very disappointed with the recipe. I was really looking forward to this.

The chicken, after cooking on low in crockpot for 5 hours, was tough.  I either wouldn't cook it that long or bake it in the oven.  Like other reviews I had to add several rounds of cornstarch/water because the sauce was so runny.  And this recipe needs way more flavor.  To sum it up: As written not great.  With modifications it has potential but then it wouldn't be the same recipe.

Read some of the reviews and frankly adding different ingredients like shrimp and other vegetables does not make chicken tetrazzini.  I did not experience thin sauce following the recipe.  I agree with those that would add garlic (granulated or garlic salt in place of the salt X 1-1 1/2 teaspoons), would also use heavy cream (more expensive but well worth the richness in flavor) as recommended by some.  The wine is essential to a true chicken tetrazzini.  Overall, only rated this a four because you save no prep time and oven baked chicken tetrazzini cooks much faster although you can do other things in the four to five hour low cooking time.

Kids LOVED it!
I made the recipe as shown, except I didn't use any white wine.  I did add 1/8 cup heavy whipping cream after reading a few reviews. It is nice and thick, and my kids loved it!!

This is so easy and very tasty. The only change I made was heavy cream instead of half and half and thighs instead of breasts(they're cheaper and more moist if you don't mind dark meat).
