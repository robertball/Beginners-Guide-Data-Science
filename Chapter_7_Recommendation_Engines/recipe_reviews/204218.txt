After someone suggested this to me as a good white trash appetizer, I thought this was a money idea. I went out and bought a "good" brand of that cheap white sandwich bread and quickly put together the filling for my "cups". I used one of the big cans of chicken that I bought in a four pack at Costco, red pepper instead of green and added a little fresh ground pepper. This needed just a bit more mayo, not much. I don't know about healthy but these are darn tasty. Like a crispy hot chicken sandwich. Great munchie food. I think next time I might add some chopped celery to offset the almonds and maybe try some dill and garlic instead of ginger. Fun!
