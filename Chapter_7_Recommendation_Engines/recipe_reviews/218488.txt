I love it!  After years in Turkey and Germany, I've also been looking for that elusive doner kebab.  This recipe is the closest I've been able to get to it.
Disregard the previous review...the reviewer obviously isn't cultured enough.

Very very tastey! I've had many many donar or as the Greeks say, gyros, and it's hard to find a great donar in Canada but I'll be making this over and over again. Our western kebabs are what the first comment describes but that's not the Turkish recipes. I also add tomato, red onion slices, and lettuce with the meat in the pita. Thanks RACHEY for this recipe!

This is delicious! We spent a few years in Germany and the Doner kebab was our favorite. Since then we have been looking for it in the states. This is definitely pretty dang close. We've made it at least once a month since finding this recipe.

I promise to take a photo next time, because they turned out pretty as well as delicious. Everyone loved these, and that includes a picky-about-trying-new-stuff kid. I sliced the flank steak when it was still partially frozen so I coulld get it very thin (~1/8" slice), and dried with paper towels right before broiling to get a nice sear. The tzatziki sauce was very good as well. This is a simple meal and results may vary if the ingredients are not high quality. I used Kronoz brand pitas from the regular grocery store and they were very good. I did change one thing, which is I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. You can do this with every recipe so long as it is not going to be cooked. Sour cream is not likely to separate the way yogurt can when heated.

So, so good. Took me right back to Europe! The only changes I made were to use Greek Yogurt instead of sour cream, and I added a garnish of diced tomato, red onion, and cucumber.

Loved these delicious sandwiches!  I prepared the marinade/rub as directed with just one large onion.  The chicken was so flavorful and delicious.  Hubs prepared on the grill. This is a great recipe for tzatziki sauce too, I prepared as written and added a little onion and garlic powders, too.  Definitely make ahead to let those flavors meld.  Really enjoyed trying your recipe, RACHEY638!

Having been stationed in Germany for two years, I knew I was going to make a döner near as good as they do back there. But I was quite surprised as to how delicious this was. Made it for myself and a friend and he absolutely loved it and can't wait for me to make it again! Very very delicious! (We filled the pita bread and then nuked it in the microwave for about 15 seconds just to melt the cheese a bit and it honestly was a game changer!

I tried this recipe to break away from the usual and we're absolutely thrilled with it. The flavour of the meat was divine. Pretty easy, too! I hesitated before throwing out the marinade, added a bit more olive oil, then put it in a pot and boiled it for a good 15 or 20 minutes to make it safe to eat, then added about a tsp of sugar and cooked until the onions caramelized. I smeared this on the pita before adding the other ingredients. Wow, just wow. The tzatziki sauce was yummy too, except I only had dried dill weed so I used 1/3 of the amount called for.  I will use smaller pitas next time, I think the ones I had were just a bit too big. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made my own sauces, but the meat marinade was really good!

Thank you so much  for this recipe! After relentlessly searching the web, its the closest I could find and still be able to cook it in my own kitchen. Used shredded cabbage and lettuce to make mine. But it's really the seasoning that helps make it just the way I remember it.

So good! I was too lazy to broil my meat, I just dumped it and the marinade in a skillet and cooked it in the stove. I put it on pita with the tzatziki, pepperoncinis, tomato, lettuce, and goat cheese. Amazing

This recipe turned out great. The marinade gave the beef such good flavor, and the process of cooking under the broiler did a great job of crisping the edges of meat just like you’d get from a real döner vendor. The garlic sauce was also terrific and would be good with other meats and vegetables. We served this on warm flatbread with red cabbage, sliced cucumber, lettuce, tomato, onions, and banana peppers. I do suggest a sprinkle of sumac when serving. This spice gives it a little citrusy flavor and they used it as a topping at our favorite shop in Kaiserslautern. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Was good.  Served it with a shredded zuchini pancake and nut-free bakalava for dessert!  Went over very well.
