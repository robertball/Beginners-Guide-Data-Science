Delicious! I followed the recipe, but stuffed the omelet  with the veggies instead of combining them with the eggs (oh, and I used more mushrooms than called for~YUM!). Really great combo of flavors..I will be making this again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is very easy and delicious! I forgot that I could use olive oil so I used vegetable oil. Still, it was very good eggs for dinner alongside with fresh bread from the bakery. This recipe makes me decide that from now on, I will make sure that I have mushrooms in the fridge to be able to whip this up anytime! This was by far the lightest but most satisfying and simple dinner I have had in ages!

I have made a version of this for many years. I do scramble some breakfast sausage in with the onions and mushrooms, and also add a little sour cream to the eggs. Really ups the flavor.
