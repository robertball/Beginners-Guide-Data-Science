I've made this several times with PERFECT results every time.  Something I have learned over the years making candy...you are wasting your time (and ingredients)making candy when it's humid or raining...the candy will NOT set up.    Also, I cook these to 240 because they continue to cook while you are stirring in the nuts.  These are perfectly buttery, soft, and absolutely the right texture for pralines!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are the best pralines I've tasted.  They remind me of the pralines made by Lamme's Candies of Austin, Texas.

This recipe is scrupdillyishus!!! So easy too! Just follow the directions.  I rate this five stars plus!!! P.S. don't take the final cooking over 242 degrees, it will get too hard.

Excellent recipe!  You'll need an accurate candy thermometer. People who've given this a low rating for not setting up, check your thermometer! The reviewer who said to be careful not to boil higher than 242 is right as they'll get too firm. I've made this recipe dozens of times and these are delicious! It is time consuming but so worth it.  You can come very close to Lamme's pralines if you use mostly dark Karo and brown sugar.  I wrap them in cellophane and put them in my candy boxes for Christmas gifts---the hard part is keeping my husband and sons from eating them first!

This recipe came out very well for me.  It reminds me of a local treat here in Austin,  Lammes "Texas Chewie" Praline, except it's a little lighter in color.

Also, I used a silicone mat to set the pralines on and it worked great.

If you haven't ever worked with sugar before, be ready to stir for a while to get it up to temperature - it's not a quick thing - but it's worth it! :)

I'm not sure why, since I double checked the recipe amounts, but the pralines never hardened.  I had a tray of soupy pecans on my hands.  I salvaged it by spooning the pecans onto graham crackers and drizzling them with chocolate.  They tasted great - just not sure why they didn't harden.

I have made these pralines many times. The secret is to monitor the temperature of your sugar slurry closely. The only alterations I have ever made is using one cup of dark corn syrup and one cup of light corn syrup to get a deeper caramel flavor and darker color. I have also roasted my pecans and like the results.  If you use a small cookie scoop (approximately 1.2 ounces) you will get close to 70 pralines. The only other suggestion is to make sure that your candy thermometer is accurate; it's a must. I lightly spray parchment paper  with non stick for  good results in removing candies once they have set up. I will try and post a pic. Good luck!

Perfect... I have been looking for a chewy recipe for years. Very similar to the one found in Candy Making for Dummies. I spooned them into miniature silicone muffin cups and they came out great.  Created more of a thick patty versus spread out.

Great recipe. Next time I might try dark corn syrup instead to give them a darker color. They turned out great and tasted even better.

I made this recipe as written.  It turned out wonderful.  After adding the cream and butter it did not look as if it would mix but as it heated up it mixed well.  It took at least 35 minutes to heat back up to the 242 degrees.  It turned out  smooth , creamy and golden.  I made a big mistake and used wax paper to drop it on.  I tried to pull one off and it was a terrible mess.  I put them outside for about 10 minutes           ( which was 8 degrees ) and they got solid enough to pull off, actually making wrapping them easier.  Very simple to make and I would make them again.  Thanks...

The ingredients in this are correct, but it will take MUCH more time than is posted and you cannot rush it.  Also, it makes MUCH more than 2 sheets of aluminum foil on 2 pans will hold...prepare 4.  And make sure it is a LARGE sauce pan...the mixture will expand as it bubbles and cooks down somewhat.  I agree with one of the other reviewers...240 is the proper temperature, not higher as it continues to cook and will go beyond the caramel stage.  But don't attempt this without a candy thermometer or you will either have rock hard pralines or runny ones.  They do taste remarkably like Lamme's Pralines!

These are delicious caramel pralines.  I used less pecans and cooked them at a lower temp.  Other than that I topped them with melted Guittard Milk chocolate to add calories.  HA!  They were a big hit and a fun change from the regular New Orleans Pralines that I make. All in all a fun recipe.  (You can use parchment paper to cool them on and halve the recipe.)

I make these whenever I am homesick for Austin, Texas. They are very close to Lamme's, a hometown tradition...
The recipe is great, all except for one thing...they don't last long enough! We find ourselves fighting over them.

Though these taste delicious there is something wrong with the timing. Also, I didn't know if I was supposed to stir the sugar and corn syrup when first put in the pan or to just let it get to boiling point. I let it sit. then after adding the rest of the ingredients, it took an hour of stirring or more, actually it took about an hour and a half of stirring to get it to 242 on candy thermomiter. I'm surprised if they do come out. I tasted some on the spoon and it was really goood. I was very disappointed about how runny they were. Not sure I'll go to all this trouble again.

Just what I was looking for. A CHEWY praline. I made half the recipe as it makes a lot. Made this twice now and both times was very good. The 2nd time I put the butter in with the sugars initially and came out with a darker praline (caramel color). Took temp. up to 245 degrees the 1st time. Took off heat and let it cool to about 230 and then slowly added the whip cream (did this because I accidently put butter in too early and figured you put it in later to cool down the mixture for the whipping cream). Anyway, returned to heat, and cooked to 242 degrees. Removed from the heat. Let it cool in the pan about 10 min. stirring occasionally and it thickens so doesn't spread out so much when placed on pan. Be sure and use parchment paper, makes it so easy to remove. Makes the most buttery, chewy caramel type praline. Excellent flavor!

I have made these twice now. Once in December and now again in August. Made them exactly as written and they have turned out beautifully both times. I understand that it is dry here in Wyoming so maybe that has helped. We love Texas Chewies and these are a close substitute!

I used a regular eating spoon to drop these onto buttered wax paper and made 75 which changes the calories to about 192 each candy. I can't keep these in the house. The kids eat them up fast! *love* this recipe! Not grainy, nice smooth chewy and easy enough for a beginner. Takes an hour though not 30 min!

My dad wanted me to make this for him.  He received the recipe from a client.  The taste is GREAT.  Not too sweet.  Love the butter.  It did not get 5 stars because it was a bit runny.  I think that the next time I make it, I will add some cornstarch or flour to thicken it just a bit.

Didn't not set up. They stayed really sticky. It was a total waste of pecans and my time. If I would have known they wouldn't firm up, I would have made a sauce instead.

Excellent Pralines... As a little insurance policy, I always heat my caramels, pralines & toffee about 7 to 10 degrees hotter than recommended.  Turned out fab !

Soooo much better than the New Orleans style pralines. Don't let your mixture above 242.  It only took me  45 mins start to finish. You don't need to spray parchment paper if you use that. Also, I used unsalted butter so I added about a teaspoon of salt during second boiling. Awesome!

OK, so this recipe is AH-mazing! (I did sub haf the sugar for brown sugar though as I found on another site)Two things though - #1 make sure your thermometer is accurate. I slightly overcooked mine which made them wonderfully chewy but hard to spoon out ;) #2 I think this recipe could easily be good with about 25% less pecans, which is helpful to the budget. And more chewy goo is a win-win in my opinion. BTW, I made a quarter batch and they turned out great.

Wonderful recipe and I agree with others.  If they didn't set, check your thermometer.  The only thing that I did that was not in the directions:  once my syrup reached the correct temperature I removed it from the heat and continued to stir it until I was sure they were firm enough to avoid a flat thin praline.  Then I added those expensive pecans and they set up perfectly.  Much better than this picture shows.

I did like these. They weren't as terribly sweet as hard pralines usually are. However, they're somewhat hard to eat--they get stuck in your teeth!

I followed this recipe exactly and ended up with an expensive mess.  I live in WI so I know it wasn't an altitude thing.  Don't know what went wrong as I did everything the recipe said and ended up with a sheet of sticky carmely pecans that may have been suitable for ice cream topping but that's about it.  There has to be a better recipe out there.

I went exactly by the recepie and it wouldn't set up! Tasted ok but i had to go with another recepie to get it right. It would probably make a good topping for ice cream lol.

This recipe deserves a 5, but the directions as given make them wayyyy too firm for my liking.  They were excellent when heated to "soft ball" or just below on my themometer.  238 degrees was the magic number for me.  They got firm enuff while maintaining a glorious chewy caramel texture.  I ended up making a few batches b/c my husband kept sneaking and eating them!!!  

B/c the recipe calls for soooo much butter I didn't dare use cooking spray, parchment lined baking sheets worked just fine.  I'm thinking maybe one less stick would be sufficient, but hey if you're going to do it, u might as well do it! ;)  I'll be using this recipe for years to come!!

good recipe. I have never made chewy pralines so it was different.  The only problem I had was the aluminum foil.  Even with it being greased, they still stuck it.  It was a nightmare peeling them off but after $20 in pecans, they were coming off.  LOL. Once I peeled them off and laid them on parchment paper, they were fine.  If I had to do over, I would use parchment paper from the start.   The other thing I would note is that it didn't say how long it should take to set so I was panicking trying to hurry and get it on the foil before it set, but it takes about 10 to 15 minutes so no need to rush like I did. My husband kept saying they were too soft but I think that is the point, hence "chewy" pralines.  Overall, I think they turned out the way they were supposed to.  I will see if my daughter's class liked them.

Just made another batch to take to work!  I usually get about 4 dozen out of the recipe as written, so have a couple more cookie sheets handy and ready to use.  
I made a batch with unsalted cashews, very tasty and a whole new dimension of flavor.  Then one with economical walnut halves, still wonderful!

1Pound of butter was to much. I use butter from Finland. A very
heavy fat content and very yellow, like the butter in the USA
use  to be, before adding more water was more profitable.
As far as the  serving amount . This recipe makes a boat load
just look at the ingredient  amounts. Follow the cooking temps
exactly ,and they  come out perfect.
Other then that great recipe Wendi661.   Thank you.

This is a perfect chewy Texas praline!  Follow the directions exactly for them to turn out correctly.  I have made them several times already.  If you are wanting a hard crystallized praline  you need to keep looking.
