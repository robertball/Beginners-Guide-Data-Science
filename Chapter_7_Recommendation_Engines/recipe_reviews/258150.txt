This has actually been a recipe my mother and grandmother passed to me.  We make it for all holidays and even put fresh corn in the freezer so it always tastes the best!  Now, my daughter makes it for her family, too.

Very tasty and simple.  Much lower in fat than other similar recipes.  I only added a very small amount of butter on top right before a I served it.  I will definitely make again!

Followed the recipe but I did not care for it. It was more like baked eggs or an omelette. Not what I was expecting.
