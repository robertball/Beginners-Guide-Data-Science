This is the third time i've made this and I love it.  I discovered if I make the filling first and put it in the fridge for a while while preping my other items, it becomes firmer and SO much easier and neater to stuff the shells.

Restaurant quality!  Believe it or not, I was able to reduce the fat, and it still came out delicious.  I bought lowfat ricotta cheese, used only 3/4 cup mozzarella + 1/2 cup parmesan in the filling (added 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp pepper, and would do that again), and left off the cheese in the sauce, just sprinkling a bit of parmesan after baking so it looked pretty.  It made two 13x9x2 pans, and I wish I had used 2 jars of sauce instead of 1.  The sauce dried out after baking, so next time, I will cover with aluminum foil first, and remove it the last 10 minutes or so.  Thanks so much for the recipe - will definitely be making it again!

My family loves this recipe!  My 3 year old eats shell after shell!! We're not a mushroom family, so I leave those out.  I scoop the filling into a big ziploc bag, close the top up, make a small cut in one of the bottom corners and squeeze into the shells - no mess!  I also divide this recipe into two 9x13 pans.  We eat one and the other goes into the freezer for later.  Freezes really well!

I will give these three stars because the recipe is a good place to start.  Prepared as stated in the recipe, this is enough for two trays of shells.  This recipe needed more than a little tweaking though.  I made the following changes.  1 tsp. of salt instead of two.  4 oz. of parmesan total (two in the filling and two in the sauce).  I substituted Italian Seasoning for the parsley.  I added about a half tsp. of garlic powder to the filling too.  I skipped the mushrooms and added Italian sausage to the sauce instead.  You will need two jars of sauce PER TRAY of shells or they will be dry.  Prepared with the changes specified, my fiancé said he could “eat himself into the hospital he’d eat so many of these shells if he could.”  Sounds like a good review to me!

This recipe was more like your real italian stuffed shells that you buy in the italian deli than any of the others, (and my family has been in the business for years)so thumbs up for that! There was a few things I changed and they were perfect! I did not add eggs and I only put 1/2 tsp salt. I added alittle more ricotta to taste to get it not as much so cheesy as I wanted it more creamy. That is the secret to any stuffed shell recipe! I used a regular homemade italian tomato sauce. I did not use mushrooms! And I didnt alter this dish to look like a deep dish piiza as it states. It is a time consuming recipe , but if you like it homemade it is worth the effort!

Hubby isn't fond of "meatless" dinners, so I browned about 1/2 lb of ground beef and added it to the pasta sauce before pouring it over the shells.  I also left out the mushrooms and only used about 1/2 tsp of salt.  We really enjoyed this very filling dinner!

CUT THE SALT IN HALF!!! The recipe is amazing, but it's way too salty. Silly me, I forgot to read the reviews before making mine and it was way too salty. It is however an excellent recipe. I used Classico italian sausage spaghetti sauce and added mushrooms. It was amazing. I'd also definitely double the sauce. I halved my recipe and I almost needed more than one jar. I can't imagine one jar being enough for the whole recipe. Flavor is EXCELLENT!!!

This recipe was great. My husband has tried a few different recipes, and they were all horrible. This one was pretty easy to make. Just takes a little bit of prep. time. I read some of the other reviews before I tried it, and decided that people thought that there might be too much salt, so I cut the salt in half. I think that was borderline too salty still, si I reccommend that the salt be 1 tsp. instead of 4 tsp. Thanks for a great recipe! The family loved it!

Great stuffed shell recipe! I have made these at least a dozen times already, I forgot to review. Every time I serve these, I get rave reviews, everyone really loves the addition of the mushrooms. These are pretty quick to put together being jar sauce is used, which is great. After I boil the shells, I rinse them in cold water(prevents them from sticking to each other) and let drain very well. In the meantime, I mix up the filling and then put it into a large ziploc bag, snip off a corner and pipe into the shells. Doing this really saves time and there's less mess, and they really look nice and neat. I usually use fresh parsely, but that's the only change I make. Thanks for sharing this simple, wonderful recipe :)

This is a variation of a recipe I previously made. This recipe is even better. The cheese filling is tasty and creamy. I only used a half teaspoon of salt. I think the 2 tsp. is a typo. I did need a larger pan than the 9 x 13. This recipe was a big hit for Christmas this year. Thanks Renee!!

Easy recipe and DELICIOUS.  I followed the recipe with the recommendations of others to only use 1 tsp of salt.  I also piped the filling into the shells using a plastic bag - such a time saver and worked perfectly!  The recipe makes more tan a 9X13 pan can hold.  My suggestion, after you fill the 9X13, place the rest on a baking sheet (no sauce, just shell & filling) and freeze.  Once frozen, pop them into a freezer bag so when you need them next you can choose the quantity you want to bake.  I'd put them frozen into sauce with cheese and bake.  Easy to make once, and easy to make for a 2nd dinner. (I had about 15 left to freeze after filling my 9X13 - and that was just making a single batch).

These were very good!  I did add extra mozerella on top for the last few minutes of baking, garlic salt instead of regular salt and parsley, added basil and I did a meat sauce to pour over.  Also, I used 2 whole jars of marinara sauce--1 would not have been enough!

Only one thing wrong here.  DON'T leave the shells dry while you are getting the rest ready.  Leave them in water.  If you leave them dry, by the time you are ready to fill the shells they are all stuck together and tear when you are trying to get them apart.

This was really really good.  I wanted something with a bit more substance so I actually browned 1lb of ground beef and 1lb ground sausage both seasoned with italian seasoning and added that to the sauce to cook up for a while.  I spooned that on the shells while they cooked for a nice meaty meal.  Also one tip, if you put some of the plain pasta sauce in the bottom of the baking dish before adding the shells it works better that spray to keep them from sticking and keeps them moist.

OMG is this good!! I just had 4 big shells, and I could keep on eating!!  This is what I used, one 15 oz part skim ricotta, one bag shredded mozz, no parm bc i didnt have it, one egg, italian seasoning, salt pepper and half a box of frozen spinach. I mixed it up let it sit in the fridge while the noodles boiled which I didnt cook fr the full 10 mins, more like 8 mins. I used one big jar of Prego mushroom sauce, and half the mozz sprinkled on top. I baked cvered for half hour, and uncovered for 15 mins. DELISH!!!

Very good and fun to make.  I had to use canneloni because I couldn't find shells anywhere and I used the "express" type so I could fill them while they were rigid.  Like some others I added a little garlic powder, onion flakes, oregano and basil to the ricotta mixture.  I used the zip lock bag with a hole cut in one corner method;  it was really easy and not messy at all.  I doubled the sauce and added about 1/2 cup of water to the jars of sauce to get enough liquid to cook the pasta.  Next time i think i will add hot italian sausage to the sauce and maybe use homemade sauce but this was great.  thanks very much for posting this.  It was my first experience with stuffing pasta.

AMAZING! I took out the mushrooms (I'm not a big mushroom fan) and it came out perfectly! My mom and could not stop eating these. I noticed that when the pan was in the oven some of the sauce spilled over so I placed a cookie sheet underneath the pan and it caught all of the sauce. I recommend this recipe to everyone.

I don't like ricotta so I substituted LF cottage cheese. I cut the recipe in half except for the pasta sauce per other reviewers suggestions. This was delicious!

LOVE these. I've made them many times!!! Did not use as much salt, and used Italian sausage in the sauce mixture ( we don't care for meatless meals) I as other reviews put the mixture in the fridge for a few, it's easier to stuff. Highly recommend!

Made this for a large gathering everyone brought a meatless dish.  Left out the mushrooms but, added 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg, 8 oz cream cheese and 8 oz sharp cheddar.  It turned out great.

With some very minor modifications, my mother declared it "Better than lasagne!" and my Dude said "Delicious! You've got to make this again." I used fresh parsley, omitted the eggs, salt and pepper. In place of canned mushrooms and jarred sauce, I used my own variation of Chef John's Tomato Sauce. I boiled the shells, then let them cool while I prepped the cheese mixture. The cooled shells were very easy to stuff. I spread a little tomato sauce in my baking dish, added the stuffed shells and spooned more sauce over it all. I didn't add cheese to the sauce, but sprinkled the extra parmesan and mozzarella over the top of the sauced shells. I covered it with foil and baked for 45 minutes, then removed the foil and broiled for another 5. What a winner! This was so easy to put together, I really see no need to make lasagne ever again.

This was really good as is. As stated in other reviews, there is too much to fill just 1 13x9 dish but I don't think I'd have had enough to fill another. I didn't change anything except doubled the sauce to pour over the top. While it was good, if I were to nitpick (and it seems I'm going to) I think next time, personal preference would have me adding some ground beef to the sauce, and leaving the cheese out of the sauce. I would prefer to melt the extra mozzarella and parm over the top of the sauce, rather than mixing it in. Mixing it in seemed to alter the texture of the sauce in a way that just wasn't my favorite. I'd also have preferred the ricotta mixture to be smoother, but the texture was a bit grainy. I can only speculate as to why that was but my best guess is that it was too much parmesan cheese.

Delicious!  I took out the mushrooms and added some ground turkey for some meat.  Other than that, I pretty much followed the recipe.  Would love to try this recipe next time with homemade sauce!!

Im into quick and easy meals and this one certainly fit the bill :)  I've never stuffed shells before so I took the advice of others and used a gallon size zip lock.  I put everything in the baggie and mixed it in there to cut down on the clean up time :)  I used 1 tsp of salt and added 1 TBS Italian seasoning.  I sauteed fresh mushrooms and fresh spinach in a little garlic and butter.  Stuffed my shells (took 1 9x13 plus 1 1/2 that size), then spread the mushrooms and spinach over the top. Next, again to save on clean up, I didn't mix the cheese in with the sauce, instead I sprinkled a bit over the shells, mushrooms and spinach then spooned the sauce over the top (I used a 45oz jar of Prego Traditional).  I took what cheese I had left and sprinkled it on top of that.  They are now baking and I can't wait for my family to try it! I know they will love em!!!  Thank you!

I'm a 1st time stuffed pasta shell maker. I thought this would be boring but it was very, very good. Liked the consistency of the filling making this recipe exactly. Prepared everything ahead of time: cooked the pasta aldente, put on paper towels in a tray, and put in frig; made the sauce (I did add a small amount of raw Italian sausage in bubbling sauce), let it cool, put in frig. Blended the eggs and cheeses ahead of time and put in frig. An hour before dinner I assembed it all, and baked as directed. It was fun and delicious.

Very good and simple to make.  I put the filling in a ziplock bag and cut off a corner.  Then pipe in the filling much quicker and not as messy.

Great recipe! I did personalize it a bit. Since there is so much cheese in this recipe, I decided to add just a pinch of salt, so that it wouldn't turn out too salty. In the ricotta mixture, I also added some onion powder, garlic powder, and oregano to spice things up. I also browned a pound of extra lean ground beef, threw some fennel seeds and garlic powder in the skillet, then added this to the mixture... I know this is very un-traditional, but the flavor that came out was amazing! I usually make my own sauce, but since I was short on time, I bought two large jars of Prego Mushroom and garlic sauce, and I must say that after all of the cheese was added (followed the recipe exact for the cheese addition to the sauce), it came out so nice! I added a layer of sauce to the pan before adding the shells... it really helps keeps the shells soft and makes them easier to serve. Popped it in the oven for 50 minutes and came out delicious!

Made this the other night and it became the unanimous number 2 favorite recipe among my roommates. I cut it in half because I was just using up the rest of box of shells. There were 20 shells and it mostly filled up 1 9x13 dish. Added some fresh chopped spinach to the filling mix, omitted salt and covered with homemade meat and mushroom sauce and cheese. Also followed some comments advice and covered with foil for about 40 minutes then cooked additional 15-20 uncovered. There were no leftovers.

Halved the recipe. Used a 300 gram tub of ricotta because that's the size I had. Left out the mushrooms. Added spinach, oregano, basil, nutmeg, garlic and onion powder to the cheese mixture. They were good but the filling I wanted to be more cheesy and creamy.

This recipe is great! Honestly I tried it with meat because my hubby prefers his pasta dishes that way, but then we made it again and strickly followed the recipe and it was worth 5 stars. In my opinion the meat overshadowed the other flavors of the dish. I have also tried it with both cottage cheese and ricotta, and my one tip is that if using cottage cheese make sure to only use one egg. The egg gives it a runnier consistency and when you are already using cottage cheese you have the extra fluid present already. I hope all of you other Italian cookers enjoy making your own shells!

This dish was sensationally good! I followed another's directions and made a few changes: halved the amount of mozzarella, swapped out full-fat ricotta for skim ricotta, made sure to refrigerate the cheese mixture before stuffing the shells, and covered the dish with aluminum foil while baking. They turned out cheesy and delicious!

These were the best stuffed shells I ever had! Since I was only making them for 4 I cut the recipe in half. If you like your shells with meat, just brown a half pound (or more if you're not halfing the recipe) of ground round and add to the cheese before filling the shells (you may need some extra shells since it makes more filling). I also used mushroom pasta sauce. A really great recipe - we all loved them! Will definitely make again! Thanks!

This was very good, first time I made stuffed shells. 6 year old enjoyed, as did my fiance. I used 2 jars of sauce, and feel it definitely needs it. I poured some into the bottom of the pan before I put the shells in. No mushrooms (cause of the 6 y/o). Very easy and tasty. Next time I'll make with homemade sauce, that would probably knock it out of the park!

This is good for vegetarians and non vegetarians alike. Tasty, filling, and easy! I used 1/2 of a box of jumbo shells cooked for 8 minutes or al dente, 1 egg, 15 oz reduced fat ricotta, 1/2 lb fat free mozzarella total, 4oz grated parm but I think it would still be good w/out the parm, 1tsp salt which was a big mistake as this does not need additional salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1jar classico tomato basil, and 8 oz fresh mushrooms chopped. Also, I added freshly chopped baby spinach, 3 cloves of chopped garlic, 



     again fresh and a generous dash of nutmeg to the filling. Nutmeg and spinach dance well together :) one more thing i did was add  one 15oz can of petite diced tomatoes and fresh basil to the sauce part.
The  fat free mozz worked great melting nicely. I covered the 9x13 casserole with aluminum foil and baked for about 35 
min give or take.

Yum! I was a little worried because I had never made stuffed shells before, but this recipe was great! It fed three of us twice with enough leftovers to send to work with my husband for his lunch today! This will definitely become a regular in our house! The only change was that I didn't add the mushrooms; no reason, I just didn't want them (and yes, I like them lol) and I followed a suggestion to cover them with foil until the last 10 minutes. Then I added the rest of the cheese and broiled it until brown. Next time I will add more sauce, but that's the only change I'd make. Thanks for a keeper!

These were not good.  Waaaaay to much ricotta cheese that gave it a very grainy texture.  Maybe next time I would substitute half of the ricotta for cream cheese or something to make it creamier.  Although I don't think I'll be making these again anytime soon.

Eliminate the salt- it's not necessary b/c the sauce has salt in it. Definitely use 2 jars of sauce, and definitely put the cheese mixture into a lg. ziploc & pipe it into the shells. Put some spinach leaves into the food processor & then added them to the cheese- yum!

This was fantastic!  First time preparing stuffed shells so I spent some time reading the reviews... cooked the shells apr. 8 mins and then rinsed in cold water.  Prepared the cheese mixture the night before and put in in the refrigerator in a Ziploc bag.  Snipped the corner of the bag and they were a breeze to fill.  Doubled the sauce, added 1/2 pound of sweet Italian sausage to the sauce.  I also replaced 1/2 of the ricotta with small curd cottage cheese.  I took these to a family reunion and they were a big hit.  Even some of the pickiest eaters enjoyed them.  Will most certainly make these again.  Oh, and the only salt I used was cooking the pasta.  Delicious!!

Wow This was good. My first attempt at stuffed shells a few years ago was not pretty, so I haven't tried again until I came across this recipie. This worked wonderfully. I cooked the shells  10 minutes in boiling (salted) water and rinsed them in cold water afterward and they were easy to handle without tearing them up. For the cheese Stuffing I added a teaspoon of dried Oregano and a teaspoon of Italian Spice just because we like those. The ONLY salt I used was in the water for the shells. I left out the mushrooms because nobody here likes them. I browned a pound of Sweet Italian Sausage because we like meat in Sauces and I had it on hand. I then poured one jar of Classico Garlic and Onion Sauce in the pan with the sausage and let it cool while I stuffed the Shells. I used a ziplock bag with the corner cut off to fill the Shells. I wasn't sure how much filling to put in the shells, so i decided to put enough in to fill the shell, but still let the shell overlap a little at the top. That seemed like the right amount. I did put some tomato sauce on the bottom of the  pan so the shells didn't stick. Then I spooned the Sauce with the sausage over the stuffed shells and added another jar of the Classico over that, and topped with Mozerella. I cooked 45 minutes covered with foil( but I don't think covering is necessary) and another 10 without foil. It came out fantastic! I will make this often. No need to add salt at all. Thank you for a great recipie!

I would like to add more greens to this dish.  Anyone have any luck adding spinach?  If so, do I just add the fresh spinach to the sauce when I pour it over?  Is 60 minutes too long for the spinach?

Any advice is most welcomed.

These were really great, and really easy. I read the reviews before hand and decided to just follow the recipe exactly. Next time I'll minimize the salt like some others have suggested. I think my biggest problem was using Kraft parmesan cheese instead of fresh grated, but that's all I had on hand. I baked for 50 mins, but I might decrease that to 40 next time as well (some of the shells were a little dry even though they were totally covered in sauce). I served it with homemade garlic bread.

I read all the reviews and considered some changes to this dish yesterday. Wowzers! Definitely, definitely... used two jars, 1/2 tsp of salt, replaced the mushrooms with italian sausage, and utilized two 13x9 dish pans because this recipe will need two; not just one. Next time I will add some mushrooms with the italian sausage -- I didn't the first time only because I was afraid I would mess this up (lol); shame on me. Nonetheless, great taste to the tongue! My boyfriend's stomach was certainly satisfied :-)

Needs lots of sauce, cover until the last 10 minutes, add sauteed garlic & onion to the ricotta cheese with the parsley, basil & oregano, snip zip lock bag which makes it easier to fill shells.

Very very good !!!  My wife told me these were the best stuffed shells she's ever had and I have to agree !! All around good and easy recipe. I enjoyed making it. Definitely use less than the two teaspoons of salt though. Used diced green pepper instead of mushroom and added ground beef. Loved it !!!

Good recipe. Extremely cheesy. I will add a little more sauce next time because the leftovers were really dry the next day.

These were great. I prepared the filling and boiled the shells in the morning before work and left them in the fridge separately. When I got home that evening, i stuffed the shells and baked them, and the presentation was beautiful. Letting the filling sit made it alot easier to fill the shells that were completely cooled. Thanks for the  recipe!

Just perfect.  So simple and basic, yet so delicious!!!  I topped with mozzarella towards the end and threw a little italian seasoning into the filling mixture.  Update:  I halved the recipe but then added  1 lb of mild italian sausage (hubby couldn't comprehend a meal without meat in it)...  delish!

We took these as our Thanksgiving dish this year and it was a big hit!!! It was so easy and fun to make. Me and my Husband had a blast stuffing the shells. I took all the other's advice and left out the salt. Next time I will add more sauce just to make it more moist. Also I just love to have extra sauce to spoon over the shells. A+++++ Recipe and I will defenitaly be making this dish again!!!!

These were great! I usually make a Spinach Cheese Stuffed Shell but I felt like something different this evening. The addition of mushrooms was perfect. I'll be making these again! Thanks!

My husband and I loved this recipe! He couldn't stop eating. The only thing I would change is I would reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp. Other than that we loved it. Next time we're going to add some Italian sausage or beef to the ricotta mixture, and we're going to cut the recipe in half because this recipe makes 2 9x13 and that's a lot for just us.

I made this recipe this evening. It was a little more involved than I'd bargained for but well worth the effort. I did tweak it a bit. I added ground beef to the sauce. And I bought the biggest container of sauce that Prego makes since in many of the reviews the sauce was believed to be insufficient. I probably added four to six ounces of cottage cheese to the ricotta along with Italian Seasoning and garlic. I also cut the salt to half a teaspoon due to many of the reviews, but I believe I will increase it to three quarters to perhaps an entire teaspoon next time. I also did not mix the cheeses with the sauce, that just seemed a little odd to me. I sprinkled the remaining cheese over both pans (and yes, it did indeed make two) covered them for forty-five minutes and then uncovered for fifteen minutes. One thing I did that wasn't mentioned in the instructions is that I let the dish rest for fifteen minutes before serving. The cheese isn't so runny once it cools just a tad.

I added 1/2 pound of ground beef to the sauce. I did not mix the cheeses in with the sauce. I covered the top with moz and parm. Must have measured something wrong. Ended up with two pans. Quickly added another jar of sauce on top of second pan and covered with cheese. Great meal! I'm not a cook. Thanks!

Very tasty!  The only problem I had was that there was way too much filling left over, and I even over-stuffed the shells!  But, I'll definitely make it again, and maybe make lasagna roll-ups with the left over filling.

Tastes Amazing! It was easy as boiling water! I wing the seasons with other that I had in the kitchen. Be careful with the stuffing b/c when I saw the large amount, compared to the shells I had (20 serv) I was all that is not going to fix. So I ended up putting to much stuffing in half the shells and the other half either had little or no stuffing in them. But it you do it right. IT WILL ALL BE GOOD!!!

Great recipe! Super easy to make- I put the filling in a large ziploc bag and cut a slit in the corner and piped the filling into the shells. 

Next time I will cut the salt in half, cut the cheese topping in half, and add a bit of garlic and basil, but overall its a great recipe.

AMAZING!  This was the first time I made stuffed shells.  They were awesome.  So easy.  I look forward to freezing some and using this as a go to for a fast meal.  So good we loved it and would not change a thing.

I made this one evening during the holidays because we had a few vegetarians in the crowd and it was a real crowd pleaser.  Easily made, easily doubled.  Along with a salad, toasted garlic bread and a good wine, it was a real hit.  Thanks, Renee!

Delicious!   I did make a few changes, however: 1.  I halved the recipe, but used a full 24 oz jar of sauce.  It was a little too much sauce, but I prefer it that way rather than too dry. 2.  Used fresh parsley (about 3 Tbsp for half recipe) 3.  I sauteed the mushrooms before mixing them with the sauce to get them to release some of their moisture.  I didn't want the sauce to get too watery. 4.  Spread a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of the baking dish to prevent the shells from sticking.

Since it was my first time making stuffed shells, I followed this recipe exactly, and it was not only simple to do, but the results were also REALLY good. This recipe makes over 30 shells, so I made two trays, froze one and heated the other. (It is the perfect dish to defrost and heat up for a quick meal.) And for assembly, I followed the advice of another reviewer and placed the cheese mixture in a large zip-lock bag, sealed it, and cut a hole in one bottom corner to act as a shell filler. This method was quick and a lot less messy than trying to spoon the mixture into each shell. My only modification for next time would be to use 2 jars of sauce - personal preference, though. Thank you for the simple, inexpensive, and delicious recipe!

Everyone LOVED these! I'm such a dolt, whenever I made shells in the past I used to cook the shells as if I was eating them at that moment, which made it A LOT harder to fill. I followed this recipe and cooked them AL DENTE. PERFECT. I also used a ziplock bag with a cut in the corner to fill the shells. So much easier! Putting cheese into the sauce made it so GOOD. I cannot tell you how awesome this came out! I will make this every time I make shells in the future!

Yum yum yum!  When I get that from my pick hubby, I know it's  a keeper!  It was fairly easy and fun might I add to make.  I let me toddler help me with some parts of this.  I did follow other reviewers advice and chilled the filling before filling the shells. It was chilled in the fridge all day since I did the prep work in the morning, so by 5pm all I had to do was fill the shells and pop 'em in the oven.  You might want to double the sauce though if you're like my family.  The sauce seemed to just bake all around the pan and of course on the shells, but not enough to drizzle on each shell that's being served. I ended up opening another jar for that purpose.  Overall great recipe, a keeper and very yummy.  I wonder if that tofu concept (llike tofu lasagna) will work on these shells too hmm?  Anyone try that yet?  Thanks again!

Everyone loved this recipe. It was super quick and easy. I used a 12oz box of jumbo shells and still had a cup and a half left of the cheese mixture. I nixed the mushrooms and added oregano and garlic powder instead. Was great the next day reheated. Awesome recipe, will DEFINITELY be making this one again.

Awesome recipe.  I'm not a fan of mushrooms, so I just left those out.  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder to the cheese mix to give it just a hint of garlic.  I served it with sauteed mix vegetables (green beans, carrots, broccoli, yellow squash) and some roasted garlic bread from the store.  I could have eaten this dish all night long!

I was very unimpressed with this dish.  I did not read the reviews until after I made it and really kicked myself.  It was so salty I couldn't eat it.  I took one bite and spit it out.  My husband didn't even like it and he likes everything.  My son wouldn't touch it either.  I followed everything exactly the way it was written.  Maybe if it was made without salt it would be better, but I'll keep searching for a new recipe.

Wow, I don't think I've ever used the word "awful" in a review, but this truly is, for so many reasons. Yes, I agree it's too salty to eat, as other reviewers have said (I, too, spit out the first bite). But second, there are no Italian spices (not even garlic), so it's completely bland otherwise (isn't this supposed to be Italian?). Last but not least, there's way too much cheese (the mushrooms are undetectable). So, you end up with a big macaroni and cheese dish that's too salty to eat anyway. My poor husband was trying to help out by finding a recipe and making it by himself. Unfortunately, this was the one he found.

I modified this recipe considerably and then cooked it in a crockpot. I fried burger with onions, added spices-Italian/turmeric/parmesean cheese,(others commented that this recipe had way too much salt so I omitted it and substituted other spices and left out the eggs) spaghetti sauce and one half cube of crème cheese. After cooking the shells in the pampered chef large saucepan in the microwave, I stuffed the shells, then put them in the crockpot on a layer of spaghetti sauce. Then I topped the shells with spaghetti sauce and grated sharp cheese. This cooked for 2 hours on high, during the last 30 minutes I grated more cheese on top. This turned out wonderful and cooked without heating up my kitchen on this 102 degree hot summer day!!!

I made a few changes to this to suit myself and my boyfriend as we are admittedly very picky eaters -- I nixed the mushrooms and the parsley and replaced half of the ricotta with a pound of Italian sausage (cooked and drained) and seasoned it with Johnny's brand Garlic Spread which is more or less a combination of garlic powder, salt, and Italian spices.  Very different from the original recipe, but also very delicious.  Just our take on what is an awesome base recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I used double the mushrooms and just sauteed some garlic in about 3 tbs of olive oil with some red pepper flakes. Instead of using a jar of sauce, I mixed the garlicky, red peppery olive in a bowl with a 28 oz can of crushed tomatos. This recipe is so delicious!! Will definitely be making again.

Best stuffed shell recipe ever! I also browned some ground beef, onion,and  garlic to add to the canned sauce. I only had American Swiss cheese but it turned out great. I always use cottage cheese instead of the expensive stuff. I followed the suggestion of piping the cottage cheese mixture into the shells from a zip lock bag, very quick and not at all messy. My Husband says "Finally, my kind of dinner!" We had the leftovers for lunch and dinner again tonight. This will not last in the fridge. Thanks for the great recipe!

When I made this I doubled the recipe and the store we were shopping at had a 48oz ricotta and we didn't want to spend a ton more money to get to the amount we needed so we used 16oz of cottage cheese and it was fantastic. I like using a mix of cottage and ricotta in these and a manicotti recipe that we have. I'd recommend trying with 24oz ricotta and 8oz cottage. I also added some oregano, garlic, chopped onion, and a little basil (all dried).

I have made this recipe several times because my family loves it! Very tasty and easy to make. I think the amount of salt is both for the pasta water and the filling, either way it's too much for just the filling. The only change I make is that I add spinach and add the remaining parmesan and mozzarella to the top of the dish instead of inside the sauce. I layer it like this-pasta shells, 1/3 of sauce, fresh spinach, remaining sauce and then the mozz and parm. Thank you Renee for a great recipe!

Very good recipe for basic stuffed shells.  The only change I made was to add some spinach to the filling.  This recipe made enough to fill another small tray which I put in the freezer for another night.  I thought they came out just as good as restaurant or frozen stuffed shells, and I got to control the ingredients.  My family gobbled it up!

I can't believe I didn't review these yet! I've made them multiple times and they are delicious. I took a tip from another reviewer and put the filling in a Ziplock back and squeezed the filling through it. (Thanks for the idea!) I have some in my fridge right now. I think I'll go get some more... :)

We really liked this - easy and filling.  I usually try to read the reviews ahead of time but did not with this recipe - I wish I had.  Many people have said to decrease the amount of salt and I will definitely cut the salt in half next time, otherwise really good.

This took a while to put together - but if you prepare ahead of time it isn't bad. I cook my pasta a few hours ahead of time then let it cool. I'll 'rejuvenate' it with some water when its time to assemble. 
I made my sauce ahead of time as well and added some finely crumbled hamburger and sausage. 

Not bad! I'll make it again when I don't feel like dealing with the hassle of lasagna.

Really needed some spices and flavoring added to the cheese and sauce. Also, I didn't use any mushrooms. A good reference for time and measurements, but I added a lot of flavors and made something quite different and delicious.

I stuffed the cheese mixture into manicotti shells...which was very very time consuming and messy.  I piped the mixture using a ziploc bag.  Also, used homemade pasta sauce.  Five stars because the mixture was easy to put together and tasted great!

I was amazed at how well these turned out. I thought they were going to be okay, but in my opinion they turned out way better then okay!!! To me they were restaurant quality! the only change I would make is less salt. I used 1 1/4 teaspoons and it was still a bit too salty for my taste, but everyone else loved them!

I usually add something to recipes to make it my own but this time I followed the recipe to a T.  These are so good.  My 2 1/2 year old asked for seconds.  We're a family of 3 and we had plenty for leftovers, which I love because these are so good.

I saw this as the recipe of the day and had to try it.  It was very good!  I really, really like the Taco Stuffed Shells on this site, but this is a good recipe if you have a hankering for a traditional stuffed shell.

Very very good.  I added some frozen spinach to the cheese mixture along with garlic powder and oregano.  I also took someone else's advice about putting the cheese mixture in a zip loc bag and cutting the bottom for an easier cheese to shell process.  Oh, I think I also cut the salt in half too.
But very very good.

This was so good and makes a ton. The only changes I made were to use fresh parsley and I didn't use the mushrooms just don't like them. Per another reviewers suggestion I put foil over the baking dishes and took it off for the last ten minutes of baking. It really needs 2 jars of sauce for the amount of shells that it makes.

Good base recipe. I added meat... I added 1/2 pound hamburger and 1/2 pound ground sausage. I also added fresh baby spinach leaves to the meat with garlic and onion and then added that mixture to the cheese and egg mixture.. I stuffed the shells and baked for about 45 minutes. I used a sauce from a ddifferent recipe I found. It was a Tomato Basil sauce. Not spagetti sauce. The tomato basil sauce worked well. As for cheese, I used a 5 cheese Italian blend and a bag of Mozzerella. I added that to the ricotta and I also put it on top. We love cheese! :) Good base recipe.

Excellent...I put the mixture into a large baggie and cut the tip off one corner to pipe the cheese into each shell.  It's a time saver.  Same recipe I make, minus the mushrooms.  I don't combine the sauce and mozzerella on top, I just top with sauce and top with mozzerella. Just a delicious and classic recipe.

I wanted it to be good, but I thought it was too dry.  I like more sauce on my stuffed shells.  Next time I make this, I will not mix the sauce with the cheese and will just cover the shells.  I liked the filling in the shells, but I couldn't get past how dry it was.

Great recipe! I had some leftover ricotta cheese to use up and found this recipe. I cut it in half because that was all the ricotta I had. It still made plenty for two adults and two kids. This is so easy and tasty I don't think I will ever buy the frozen ones again. I took some of the tips from others and cut the salt in half. I also used a baggie with a corner cut off to put the cheese into the shell, it worked great!

If you don't cover the shells completely with sauce, they will get really dry.  Also, make sure not to overstuff the shells.  Does not taste good with too much ricotta.

This recipe was very good, but I feel it was missing something. I think next time it might be helpful to add some seasonings to the cheese mixture. Possibly some italian seasoning or oregano or fresh basil. Also, it does fill two 9X13 dishes so I, like other reviewers, froze half. I made one other change, I cubed (very small) the mozzarella cheese instead of grating it. I find once it is melted, the consistency is better. If you try this, and use the ziploc bag technique to pipe the filling into the shells, be sure enough to cut a whole big enough to squeeze out the cubes. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is my favorite stuffed shell recipe to date.  I did not add mushrooms, and I only had enough shredded parmesan for the filling (5 oz).  I doubled the sauce.  I also used a 1 gallon zip lock bag with the corner nipped, and it made the job a lot easier.  I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes to the cheese mixture.  The girls track team devoured the shells and some even asked for doggie bags.  My husband and other guests also really enjoyed this recipe.  I might use Parmigiano-Reggiano in place of parmesan next time to kick it up a notch.

Very yummy and easy to make.  I liked the idea of pipeing the filling into the shell using a ziplock - worked great.  Next time I'll add chopped brocoli or spinach for some greens.  Both our kids loved it.

This recipe was good but too salty. I will definitely make it again but I will cut the salt in half.

I envisioned this to have more of a ricotta taste, which I would have preferred.  All of my dinner guests raved about the shells and I was asked for the recipe by co-workers who I pawned my leftovers off on.

Reduce the salt in half or just leave it out & its perfect. My husband is still eating and stuffed. He's now only eating it for "taste". I added fresh spinach that I steamed and patted dry along with 3 cloves of garlic. Very, Very good. Thank you!

Quick and Easy...perfect dish for meatless Monday. Cut the salt amount back to 1 tsp. Definitely helps to use a ziplock bag to stuff the shells.

I made this last night and my family Loved it. I did the cheese mix as was. I added a mix of beef and turkey to the sauce for a meatier taste. I did pipe cheese mix thru a Zip bag and that made it so mush easier.

We loved this recipe! My 5 year old daughter had a blast mixing the cheese & stuffing the shells. I went with the recommendations for less salt, more sauce, & to add garlic. We also added Italian seasoning to the cheese mixture. We baked at 350 for 40 minutes then 20 minutes on 400. We will make this again!

As a mom of 5, it is impossible to please everyone. I have to feed 8 people on a budget and this is perfect. I have made it lots of times except I add 1 lb ground beef. Everyone LOVES stuffed shell night and the kids get to help. Delicious and a great way to get everyone to take part in dinner prep. My kids are 10,8,5,3 and 1 and it is super easy to find fun jobs for everyone! They love helping with this recipe but love eating it even more! Perfect for a big family!!!!

I havent tried this yet but used this as a base. I have cooked stuffed shells before and just needed a guidline, as my mom memory of 5 kids sets in.... I can tell you that not everyone likes mushrooms. An alternative would/could be sausage, hamburger, broccoli etc and spinach can even go into the mix for a nice boost in nutrition without taking from the taste, and no one will every knnow!! Italian season is better. You always add some sort of garlic to an Italian dish. And shells are always baked covered, or they will be dry. Sauce should go into pan first, then place stuffed shells. I add my ground meats then mozzarella to hold meats into place. Then drizzle top with sauce and put extra filling sides. That is much to much salt and parm. Im not sure how much i use as i normally do my mozzarella by eye and about a cup of parm into mix. 5 eggs makes me think this will be runny. I always use 2.

My family loved the shells, but it was missing something. The next time I made them I used bagged shreds, Mozz/Provolone, Munster, Whole milk Ricotta 2 lb, Philly cream cheese, brick and parm, 8oz of each, to this I added Italian Seasonings, basil, garlic powder, fresh cracked pepper, 1 tsp of salt, and added 2 eggs after I mixed and tasted.  I made 60 lg. shells filled about 1 1/2 tsp of filling. Takes 3-4 jars of sauce,(Italian Bread for the extra sauce, tasty after the shells cook) butter your pans, cover bottom with sauce add shells and cover with the remaining sauce, 350 for 30-45 minutes. I made these for a picnic and now anywhere we go this is what I'm asked to bring.. If you love cheese try this recipe.

This was DELICIOUS! I halved the recipe since I only needed enough to feed myself and my husband. I did, however, use 1 whole jar of pasta sauce. I also didn't have any grated parm on hand, but it still turned out great! Oh and I added about 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp all-purpose seasoning, and 1 tsp onion powder to the sauce/mozz mixture. Very good! :)

This is the first time I've ever made stuffed shells so I was very happy when they turned out absolutely wonderful even with my own changes to the recipe. I read over the reviews and decided to half the recipe because I did not need so much for only two people! I used a large jar of Classico Tomato Basil sauce but upon adding the mushrooms I felt like it was going to be too little from the start. So I added in a roma tomato, half of a white onion, fresh parsley, a can of tomato paste, garlic powder and some oregano. I'm not a fan of dealing with slippery noodles and having to spend a ton of time fighting to get a stuffing in them so I baked them raw at 325 degrees for an hour. Turned out just fine! Oh, and for the stuffing I eliminated the egg and added spinach. Thanks for sharing!! :)

This recipe probably has really good flavor, but made as is, the overwhelming salt taste covers it up. We're struggling to finish off the dish. Next time (and it's worth making again), I'll only put in 1/2 tsp salt.

I thought this was just "okay."  I cut it in half, but still used the full jar of marinara sauce, and it was still a little dry and bland.  Unless you really want stuffed shells, I would recommend doing this as a lasagne using no-bake lasagne -- it would be much easier and faster than cooking the shells and stuffing them.

This was delicious!  I did follow the advice of a lot of people and added a little spinach, garlic, oregano and basil to the cheese filling. Also added another 1/2 jar of sauce to the bottom of the pans.
I split the dish into 2 8x8's so I could freeze one for another meal.

Love these. I always use 2 jars of pasta sauce and add sauteed chopped spinach and mushrooms. I usually cut the cheese a little bit and sprinkle on top rather than mixing it in with the sauce. Delish! Freezes very well. Just cook it halfway and then freeze, thaw in fridge overnight and bake for 30-40 minutes at 350.

Followed this recipe exactly, except I used my own pasta sauce, and 4 oz can sliced mushrooms. It came out very good, my family and I loved it. We didn't find it too salty as others claim. I put the ricotta cheese/egg mixture in the fridge before stuffing the shells like someone suggested, since I had never tried to stuff shells before, and found it very easy to stuff them. Only had a hard time fitting all the shells into one 9x13 pan, but I think this is a really good, easy recipe and serves as yummy leftovers too. Will definitely be making this again.

I added spinach instead of mushrooms, and half the amount of mozzerella. Would be good with meat sauce. Also added onions to the sauce and used one and 1/2 cans of sauce instead of one

I love this recipe, I've used it many times.. My sauce always includes one pound of ground beef, 93% lean as well as one pound of Italian mild sausage... I love how there is plenty of filling for all the shells with this recipe.. Just plan to walk after dinner, it's filling !

my only quarrel is that if you're going to the trouble of stuffing your own shells, there's no reason to use gravy (sauce) out of a jar. that said, this is an amazing recipe, the closest i've found to nonna's. and i think the mushrooms are a nice touch. kudos!

Great!!  I added 1/2 pound browned Italian sausage to the sauce for an extra kick.  Also, we have a family of three so as I stuffed the shells I split the recipe in two smaller baking dishes and put the second one in the freezer for later.  Perfect.

This is a great recipe, but I don't like it with mushrooms. I also added cooked italian sausage and nutmeg to the filling and used cottage cheese instead of ricotta.

I used manicotti shells for this dish and filled them with the cheese mixture.  I also added ground beef to the pasta sauce to make it a complete meal.  It turned out to be very good and filling.  I didn't add the mushrooms, as I didn't have any, but they would have been quite good too.  Would definitely make again.

Great recipe.  I cut way back on the salt, used low-fat ricotta, added fresh basil and oregano to filling. Used lean hot italian turkey sausage in the sauce along with the mushrooms.  Didn't use the additional cheese in the sauce, just sprinkled some parmesan over the top.  Definately needs double the amount of sauce.  Delicious and easy.

I've made this a few times now. I usually skip the extra cheese on top of the shells to keep the fat content down, it really isn't missed.

This turned out fantastic!  I added a few extra spices to the ricotta mixture but other than that I followed the recipe and it was AMAZING.  My dinner guest ate at least 10 shells!

I made it without meat - it was delicious. I stuffed 13 shells, which seemed way too much, but my boyfriend ate 5 of them in 1 sitting! Yummy.

I loved this dish. It was really easy and taste great. I made one big change thou, I added ground chuck and Italian sausage to the sauce. Gotta have my meat.  I also added fresh basil and garlic. DELISH! I am planning a dinner party and this will be one of the main dishes.

This is an awesome dish. It is easy to make and is a good dish if you need to prep the night before and throw in the oven the next day. I get compliments every time I make it. After making it several times I make two alterations: add a teaspoon or a clove of minced garlic and I only use 8 ounces of mozzerela cheese b/c I think it has plenty of cheese in it. I put 1/2 in the mixture and sprinle the rest on top. I've made it with and without mushrooms - tastes great both ways.

This was a super tasty dish.  I used Prego mushroom flavor since I had it and didn’t have any mushrooms on hand.  It was delish. I will use 2 jars of sauce next time instead of the one that the recipe called for.   I also added ½ pound of hamburger to the sauce per other reviewers because we are a meat eating family.  I think I might try ground turkey the next time to make it a little lighter.  I added Ms Dash Italian flavor and salt and pepper to the shell filling to taste. I also covered it with foil for the first half of the cooking so the cheeses wouldn’t cook too fast. My husband loved it; he thought the shells were like mini lasagnas. Even my 18 month old approved. Going into the regular meal rotations for sure.   Definitely worth the effort.

Excellent!  I added a little Italian seasoning to the cheese mixture and I used 1 teaspoon garlic salt in place of the salt.  Instead of adding the rest of the cheese to the speg. sauce I baked 20 min. then took it out and put parm. cheese then the motz. and baked for 35-40 min. more.  I also used 2 jars of speg. sauce.  This was sooo good!!

I really liked this recipe. I also used half of the salt and only a cup of mozzarella in the ricotta. I didn't mix the cheese with the sauce I used foil on top for the first 40 mintes and then added another cup of mozzarella and the parmesan on top. I used two jars of marinara and it made two pans.  I went back for seconds and had no leftovers from the first pan. The other pan is in the freezer. I will be making this again for sure and probably by request!

great filling.  Shells had tendency to tear, and some stuck together - probably need to cook fewer at a time, or get a larger cooker.

Very good recipe!  I combined this recipe with Rachel Ray's stuffed shells recipe on the food network site.  I use 32oz part-skim ricotta, and add 1.5 cup grated asiago in the mixture.  Instead of jar sauce, I saute onions and garlic in olive oil (2 turns of olive oil) and add 28 oz crushed tomatoes.  Then add 2 tbsp of oregano and basil (you can also chop about 8 leaves of fresh basil) to the sauce and simmer.  Spread some sauce on the bottom of the dish, put the stuffed shells in the dish and pour the sauce over.  Cover with 8oz of shredded mozzarella cheese and bake for 50-60 min.

This was a great dish. I did make some changes to suit our preferences though. I addes a package of frozen chopped spinach (thawed and drained well) to the filling. I also combined 1 1/2 cups of beshemel sauce (3 tbsp. butter melted over med-low , 3 tbsp. flour added and brought to bubbly for 1 minute, add 1 cup half and half, 1/2 cup milk, stirring constantly, bring to just about a boil) with 2 cups of pasta sauce, instead of the 28 oz of plain pasta sauce. I combined the "new" sauce with the mushrooms, which I sauted in a little butter for a couple of minutes, and omitted the parmesan and mozzarella in the sauce, as the beshemel made it plenty creamy. I baked it for 40 minutesd covered, then pulled the foil off and added the 8 oz of shredded mozzarella. I then baked for 15 more minutes. Super good!

This was easy and great! Of course I made a few changes: I only used(1) 8 oz bag of shredded Mozzrella for the mixture and it was plenty, I can't imagine using two bags. I added italian seasoning instead of parsley and found that one jar of sauce worked fine for a 9x13 inch pan. They weren't swimming in sauce, but I like it like that. Also, I sprayed the bottom of another 9x11 pan and put the rest of the filled shells in there and popped it in the freezer. After they all froze individually I put them into a freezer bag and now we have an easy dinner for another night! Thanks!

I have to agree with one of the reviewers this dish is restaurant quality. Even using fat free ricotta and 2% muzzarella this dish still tasted rich and delicious. I sauted my mushrooms with fresh garlic before adding my homemade tomato sauce and cheeses, used fresh parsley instead of dried. And to avoid being dried I baked 45 minutes covered with foil and 10 minutes uncovered. This is a keeper. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I usually stuff my shells with a cheese mixture and spinach.  I thought I would try this basic cheese recipe and it was really good.  I actually preferred it to the spinach stuffed shells.  I served this along side chicken parmesan and a green salad.  I thought they were actually evan better reheated the next day.

I enjoyed the flavor of this recipe, although I feel it was a little light on the sauce. Mine was a bit dry. I think I will increase the amount of sauce next time. I was able to freeze these to use again though. They hold up well.

THE BASIC RECIPE IS GREAT, but...
make your own sauce(make it in large batches and freeze it for recipes like this) the stuff in the jar is  (yuk) impossible to use

I was really disappointed with this recipe. This calls for 2 tsp. of salt,  way too much! Although, I followed the recipe, my family could not eat too much because of the sodium content and the salty taste. I would not recommend mixing the other half of mozzarella to the spaghetti sauce. I spent alot of time and money and would definetely suggest only 1/2 tsp salt and top with sauce and then cheese.

Excellent!  I didn't use mushrooms but added some dried oregano to the cheese mix.  I also used 2 jars of sauce, as another user had suggested, and used a pan larger than 9x13.  I didn't add any salt, it comes out salty enough.  I used Bertoli brand tomato and basil spaghetti sauce.  Will definitly make this again!!

This was delicious! I made it basically as written except for adding some extra sauce. One family member thought these were the best stuffed shells he had ever had.

I have also made these many times, but only use about 1/4 tsp of salt and add about 1 tsp of garlic POWDER (not garlic salt) to the cheese mixture with some italian seasoning, about 1 1/2 tsp. I also add 1 lb. ground chuck and half chopped onion to the sauce to make a meat sauce to cover them.   Mine turn out fabulous every time and I'm often asked to make them!

This was awesome - we just had this for Christmas dinner along with some other Italian dishes, breadsticks and cesar salad.  It received rave reviews.  It made two pans full.  Only change was no mushrooms.  I baked one pan for dinner, and all that was left was a little sauce in one end of the pan.  I cookied for almost an hour because I made it yesterday and refrigerated overnight so I didn't have to do any work today.

This was good, but not great.  I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the salt in half.  Figure you can always add more to taste, but you can't take it out later!  Also did the ziploc trick and it worked like a charm!  But I really thought the meal was bland, not enough flavor.  So next time I think I'll have to add more spices, even though I did add basil and oregano...

Skip the salt and this would be an awesome dish.  However, as is it came out much too salty for our tastes.  A day to sit, and a lot of extra sauce poured over the top of it helped a bit, but it was still very salty.

I made this for my husband and a friend of ours last night and they both said it was stupendous. I didn't have any parmesan cheese so I substitutes mild cheddar and added oregano, italian seasoning and basil. Definitely cover with aluminum foil for the first 40 minutes of baking and then remove...it turned out perfectly! I'm sure I will make this again very soon at my husband's request!

This was a great recipe. I followed other's advice and used a ziploc bag with a cut in the corner to pipe the filling into the shells. We are not mushroom fans, so I topped it with ground sirloin instead. My husband loved it!

This was good. I followed the recipe as written but in place of mushrooms, I added chicken sausage. Worked out very well and my husband loved it. I halved the recipe and it still made plenty of leftovers, which will be perfect for lunch. Great recipe -- will use this again.

This recipe is delicious. Everyone loved it. I added garlic powder to the mix and ground meat with olive oil and chopped garlic to the sauce. For sure it is 5 stars.

This is a good recipe to build on and personalize.  I would love to give it five stars, but I feel that I have had to make several adjustments.  I use this a reference for a basic suffed shells recipe.  My boyfriend and I weren't too wild about the sauce and we also add garlic powder and a pinch of oregano to the filling each time we make it.  As one reviewer noted, this recipe produces enough shells for two baking dishes.

Very good the first night, but leftovers seemed extremely salty.  I will cut down on the salt next time.  Otherwise, a very good / easy recipe.

Awesome.  I used an idea from another stuffed shell recipe and put Hamburg in the bottom of the shell underneath the cheese.  This is a great recipe, will defiantly make again.

These were fantastic!! Besides them being a little too salty on my part, they were good. My husband had just gotten home from work and was trying to tell me something while I was trying to keep count of how much salt I had put in and I guess I miscounted. Oh well. I just love Italian food and will definately make these again.

Added 1/2 lb Italian sausage and 1/2 lb ground beef to sauce as my boys are meat lovers. Also used half ricotta and 1/2 large curd cottage cheese.  Omitted Mushrooms but imagine it would be fantastic with them....family won't eat them!  My sons favorite recipe!! Plus I can get two nights dinner out of one recipe so BONUS

I made this for the first time the other day and it is really good and easy to make! I did follow the suggestion on some other reviews and cut the salt in half. I also followed someone's suggestion and added 2 jars of sauce instead of one and ground meat to the sauce. This recipe came out perfect with these 2 adjustments! I will definitely be making this again.

Perfect! The only thing I did different was pour spaghetti sauce over the stuffed shells, then sprinkle the mozzarella and then the parm. No need to put spaghetti sauce on the bottom of the pan. In my opinion, it was a little too salty. Next time, I will only use 1 tsp of salt instead of 2. It yielded a tray and a half. So, I only cooked the amount I was going to cook that night and put the rest of the uncooked shells in the fridge for tomorrow's dinner. This way, it would be fresh tasting as oppose to reheating left-overs. Also, I pre-heated the oven AFTER I started filling the shells. They were ready in 30 minutes. Thanks!

I grabbed this recipe for the cheese mix, lost my own copy a few years back. I add chopped fresh spinach  in the place of parsley.  I also increase the mozzarella cheese and use parmesan and reggiano mixed. So it was a four cheese  blend. Was a fantastic hit with the homemade lasagna sauce we made the day before.

I made a few of the changes that were suggested by many others for this recipe.  I cut the salt in half, used 2 jars of sauce instead of 1 and used Italian Seasoning instead of parsley   The tip I loved most was to put the cheese mixture into a zip lock bag, cut the corner out and squeeze the mixture into the shells.  So easy to prepare that way!  The family loved it and I will make this again.

This recipe feeds a lot of people so I cut it down to half for our family of three. I left out the egg but otherwise followed the recipe. My picky husband who tends to eat very healthy loved this and ate the leftovers for lunch the following day! You may want to cover while baking to keep the shells from drying out, mainly the corners that haven't been covered by sauce.

Delish! I didn't have enough ricotta, so I added in some sour cream and additional mozzarella. The filling was a bit thinner than I expected, but it cooked up to perfection!

My husband makes this every year around the holidays for a family get-together and gets rave reviews! Every time!
We don't put any mushrooms in ours, personal preverance... and also use just 1 egg. It seems to get runny if you use 2. 
Mix the ingredients and let sit overnight in fridge, so the flavors can mix. DELICIOUS! We have made this for 3-4 years now. Use it for stuffed shells and lasagna as well.

I made this recipe exactly how they said to make it and it ended up really good! The only thing I changed to this recipe is by using 2 jars of spaghetti sauce instead of 1. I really wanted the shells to be covered in sauce and 1 jar didn't cover it all. I also layered my baking dish with the sauce itself as well. I recommend putting the cheese sauce into a ziplock big and cut the very corner and squeeze it out! Make your kids do that part, it'll be fun! In the end it came out wonderful. Def. will make it again!! Thank you!

I cut the salt in half as others suggested and added 2 teaspoons of Italian herbs to the cheese mixture. My hubby and I don't like as much filling in the shells so we cut that in half and all the shells fit in one pan that way. Also, another reviewer suggested covering the pan with tin foil so the sauce doesn't dry out on the noodles and that worked like a charm. Great recipe, thank you!

Loved this! I added chopped basil to the filling and a pinch of nutmeg. I also found it very easy to fill a Ziploc bag with the filling snip off a corner and pipe filling into shells. Great recipe for a week night meal!

This is the easiest, tastiest shells and cheese recipe yet! Easy to make ahead of time and then refridgerate or freeze until ready to use. I added a little cream cheese and some thawed frozen spinach to the cheese mix and it was the best!!! This is a meal that even the pickiest eaters in your family will like.

i tried this and it was definitely a hit i added italian sausage to the filling instead of the sauce and it was pretty good next time i will add more sauce. one jar isn't enough i should of read the comments before attempting seems like everyone had that same issue. as well as cut the salt in half too. this recipe is definitely a saver. the shells are a lot easier to  fill if you put the filling in a ziplock bag and cut the corner off and use like a pastry bag

Very good recipe and I found it to be easy. I cut the recipe in half because just myself and my daughter would be eating the shells. I only omitted the mushrooms I used everything else. It is sooo good. Also, I put the filling in a Ziploc bag made a small cut at the end of the bag and filled the shells. It was so easy. My daughter is a vegetarian she loved it.

I added chicken and spinach to the ricotta mixture. I boiled the chicken hen shredded with a fork and put a box of frozen organic spinach (thawed & drained) in the mixture and my family loved it! I also added more seasons to taste.

My whole family really loved this recipe.  I used 1 pound of  pasta instead of 12 oz. and should have stuck to the recipe.  I think each shell could have had more cheese in it.  I did not use mushrooms because my children hate mushrooms.  I did however add spinach to the cheese mixture and they all loved them with spinach. It is a well-written recipe.  I did cut back on the salt.  Cheese is salty enough without two tsp. of salt in it.  I also added two cloves of garlic, finely minced and chilled the cheese mixture in the fridge for a while before filling the shells.  This is easily made early in the day, refrigerated and baked for dinner when needed.     

This could also be used with a sausage and ground beef sauce and it is an  easier than lasagna dish without the work of lasagna.

Excellent stuffed pasta recipe. I covered mine with a meat sauce (1/2 hb, 1/2 half sausage) and it's definitely in the rotation by request.

Predominantly easy... the shells are easier to stuff with the bag method, I just suck at it. LOL I kinda had a rhythm going towards the end, though. Whether you use the spoon or bag, this is definitely a great recipe!! If you wanted, maybe add a pinch of nutmeg. Definitely a winner in my house!! My ricotta disliking daughter even gave me a compliment!!

My family absolutely loved this!  I added a bit more ricotta, fresh parsley and Italian sausage and left out the mushrooms.  I also made my own marinara only because I prefer mine to store bought.  This is a keeper and on the list of fav's for the husband and kids.

Followed recipe exactly, but definitely needed more sauce. Luckily I had half a jar in the fridge to add. I also copied another reviewers suggestion and (after filling my casserole dish) I put the extra stuffed shells on a cookie sheet in the freezer before putting them in a plastic bag so I can pull them out individually later.
I do think next time I'll put a bit more filling in each shell since this time I wanted to be sure it lasted for all the shells and I ended up having a lot of leftover. But otherwise, delicious!

The flavor was amazing, and I'll definitely be making it again, though I think I'll take another reviewer's advice and layer the mozzarella instead of mixing it with the sauce.

The recipe above is a great guide, so 4 stars. The thing I hate about finding recipes is that converting tham to milliliters and grams at the store is a hassle and it never works out to an easy one or two containers of something, so for all my fellow math-impaired chefs here's my easy-to-buy 'fake it': 
1 package President's Choice jumbo pasta shells ( 250g)/
Stuffing:
2 eggs/
1 container of President's Choice ricotta (454g)/
Half a bag of Kraft shredded mozzarella - the kind you find in the refrigerated section with the brick cheeses/
Half a bag of Kraft seasoned feta (but use whatever you'd like here)/
A handful of shredded parmesan/
Add 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder to stuffing mix/
CUT SALT IN HALF - use only 1 teaspoon/
Omit black pepper if you used the seasoned feta/
Topping:
One jar plain tomato pasta sauce (700mL)/
Other half of mozza and feta cheeses/
A handful of parmesan/
Otherwise follow the directions as written and enjoy!/
P. S.: Won't make 10 servings, but would feed a family of four for one night, or a bachelor/bachelorette for a few days.

I thought this recipe was very good and my husband loved it. But I made the mistake of using a creamy marinara sauce and that made the dish too creamy. Next time I will just use a regular marinara. I added ground beef to the sauce and frozen spinach to the filling to add more protein and veggies to this meal. I also cut the salt in half, used twice the sauce and baked it covered until the last 10 mins. All good recommendations!

This is my 3rd time making them-delish. This time I added sliced mushrooms on top-then some cheese. I already make my own crockpot full of sauce,I only added 1/2 teas of salt,since the sauce already had it ,and cheese has salt in it too.We eat them for 2 days and I freeze a batch,it makes that much.Yummm...

Oh my ...this was just...delicious. I omitted the shrooms only because my family doesn't like but even so. I will be sharing this recipe and making it again. And again. Way to go. And so simple.

Everything about this recipe is very good, except the sauce was way too thick. I ended up doubling the pasta sauce and it way still thick. I think next time I will only add the mozzarella, and only on top.  This is a very filling recipe. I lasted three meals. If you are serving only 4 people then I recommend cutting this in half.

Makes a ton, but we enjoyed these a lot! Froze a pan. Used leftover marinara sauce with beef and peas. Somebody suggested using a bag to pipe the cheese filling into the shells. Bad idea. The cheese was so thick it wouldn't come out of the bag and I felt like my hand was going to break. Gave up and spooned it in. Surprisingly easier!

What a Great, Easy dish.I omitted (the salt) and mushrooms also as I am the only one who enjoys the taste of mushrooms. I used fresh   Parsley instead of dried. I also added minced garlic and diced white onion along with cooked Italian sausage to my marinara sauce. I admit I did not add the cheese to the sauce I baked my dish and with the last 15 min. remaining, I added my cheese to the top. It was delicious and the presentation looked great. I am actually doubling the recipe and making this for my husbands family this weekend. So much easier and less steps than home made Lasagna. Bon a petite !

I made this recipe but added hamburger meat and sauteed 1 med onion,mushrooms,1 green pepper in white wine and olive oil in a pan while the hamburger was cooking. I added it to the sauce. Also put extra sauce on side. Loved it! A must try!

Awesome and easier than you would think.  I did add a sauted onion, 1/2 pound Italian Sausage and 1/2 pound hamburger to the sauce.  I also added a 10oz pack of spinach to the filling.  I also cut the salt in half like others suggested.  I also made the filling first and placed it back in the fridge so that it would firm up.

I made this recipe with a few adjustments.  I halved the recipe and am glad I did, because it still made an ENTIRE 9 by 13 tray of stuffed shells!  I did NOT half the sauce amount or it would have been too dry.  To my jarred sauce I added 1 lb of seasoned, browned ground beef, 1 small can of sliced black olives, a can of diced tomates, and a can of sliced mushrooms (all drained!).  I also pepped up the sauce with garlic, salt, pepper, italian seasoning,a dash of cayenne, and about a tbsp of white sugar.  (We like our food well seasoned.)  I followed the directions for the filling.  The only change I made was to use 4 cheese mexian blend instead of mozzerella because it was all I had on hand.  I put a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of the baking dish, then I did the layer of stuffed shells and topped the shells with the remaining sauce.  I sprinkled the top of it with parmesean cheese and chose not to mix any cheeses with the sauce so the delicate flavor of the ricotta filling and the yummy sauce stand out.  I abked covered until the last 10 or 15 minutes.  YUMMY!  Next time I may add some spinach to the ricotta mixture to get more veggies and nutrition into the dish.

I used the recipe as a base and followed most of the directions. The only change was a bit more ricotta and I added Cheddar to it because I didn't have enough mozzarella. I also used parley and a little paprika into the mix with some fresh chopped basil. As a sauce I didn't use mushrooms. Instead I used chorizo with onions, basil, garlic, and sauce and sauteed it together before pouring over the shells and baking 50 minutes covered and the last ten minutes uncovered. Everyone in the house loved it!!! So easy!

HEY PEEPS, for those of you who used the salt amount in this recipe, it probably belonged in the pasta cooking water. Using the jarred sauce would make adding any more salt unnecessary!
Great meal for a crowd. Add some good Italian Chianti and a salad and you're solid!

Delicious! I also halved the salt (and the entire recipe). I used low-fat ricotta and Newman's Own marinara sauce. I also added about two cloves of garlic to the sauce mix.

Delicious. We made these without the eggs and mushrooms and cut the salt in half. We added some dried basil and did not put any cheese on top, only the sauce. These made enough for 2 meals so we froze half of them for another dinner.

This was really good and pretty quick and easy. I made the cheese mixture ahead of time and then just stuffed the shells whenever I was ready to eat them. The stuffing is really good. I even keep some on hand to use in other recipes.

This recipe is a WINNER!!  Even my picky eater went back for seconds.  I halved the recipe and omitted the mushrooms.  I did reduce the amt of salt to half.  This is definitely being added to our monthly rotation!  Thank you for such an awesome meal!!

This is a family favorite! I omit the salt because I find it to be too salty and I omit the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them. Otherwise, this recipe is perfect!

It calls for similar ingredients to manicotti that I usually make. Jumbo shells are much easier to stuff, especially I could stuff the first batch while the second one was cooked. Shells were easier to serve as well. The adjustments I made included, using 1 egg instead of 2, adding some cooked diced onions with shredded zucchini and minced garlic in the stuffing, as well as adding leftover ground beef as the topping because I didn't have mushrooms at that time. I lightly cooked beef in olive oil with some fennel seeds and Italian seasoning to mimic Italian sausage flavor. At the end, the amount of ingredients only allowed me to stuff 25 shells, but it was enough to fill a 9x13 glassware. In addition, I only used about 16 oz of pasta sauce. The remaining of the sauce served on the side for whoever wanted more sauce in the plate.

Good stuffed shell recipe. Would be good with home made sauce but the jar stuff works when time is a factor. I liked these even better the next day.

These were very good.  I would leave out the mushrooms the next time or maybe cook them before adding them to the sauce.  I didn't care for the taste of the mushrooms in this recipe.

When I went to the grocery store, I realized that I had written down the ingredients of the recipe, but not the quantity of the items, AND, I bought cottage cheese by mistake, instead of ricotta. Making so many mistakes, I was very concerned about how it would turn out, but decided to try it anyway. It still turned out phenomenal! Everyone loved the shells, so I made it the following week (the correct way), and was a hit again. Thanks for the fail-proof recipe!

Unlike the submitter, we actually prefer cottage cheese over ricotta, so that is what I used.  Kids and I don't care for mushrooms, so I omitted those.  This recipe wasn't much trouble, and the kids gobbled it down.  Thanks!

This was my first time making stuffed shells.  They were delicious!  I didn't have the amount of mozzarella or Parmesan called for (less than half) and it was not missed at all.  I had a great sauce (Newman's Own Roasted Tomato and Garlic) and just dusted the tops with cheese for looks. I only spooned the sauce "as is" over the stuffed shells. As others have mentioned, one jar of sauce is not enough. I also added about 8 oz. thawed frozen spinach to the ricotta mixture and it was great.  My 5 year old twins who don't like spinach ate several of these.  Because of this recipe, I am looking forward to making these again.

I used ingredients as listed, minus the mushrooms, plus a little minced garlic in the pasta sauce. I made the stuffing first and refrigerated as someone else recommended. This did seem to make the shells easier to stuff. Cooking time was perfect, and so was dinner (and lunch the next day).

These stuffed shells are delicious! I followed recipe to a T the first time and very slightly changed it the next few times. I used 3 cartons of Ricotta cheese, left out the eggs, added some garlic the the filling and used 1 large and 1 small jar of Prego original. PERFECT! Center was creamier and had the perfect amount of sauce. I've made it plain, with Italian sausage and with seasoned, crumbled hamburger - All GREAT!
Thanks for the yummy dish!

This recipe was ok, but I've had better. I only used a 15 oz container of ricotta cheese and even that seemed like a bit much.

Family loved it.. Never made stuffed shells before but now I don't think I could go back to frozen shells ever again lol.  Very flavorful even for omitting the salt which my husband can't have.

I stuffed half with skim ricotta and half with low fat cottage.  Both were great.  I also only used half a pound low moisture mozzarella and 4 ounces parmesean, like others suggested.  My husband loved it.  I added a bit of sauteed spinach to some.  Would definitely make again.

This was GREAT. I made mine minus the mushrooms and parsley as the children don't care for either. Other than that, this was a great dish that everyone wanted seconds of. Will be making again and again.

I really didn't like this.  Neither did my husband.  But our 18-month old loved it.  Too much Parmesan!  I won't make this again but I will look for a different stuffed shell recipe.  I'd like one with meat in it so my son can get a better rounded meal.

Four out of five stars because I changed the recipe a little. I omited the mushroom and egg. Only used 1/2 tsp salt and to make it more creamy I added more rocitta cheese.

This recipe was pretty good. I read the various negative reviews about it being too salty so I listened to the advice of the good reviews saying to cut the salt in half. I actually used garlic salt in place of the salt but I used only 1 teaspoon of it. I was surprised how many shells it produced. I doubled the recipe because I was planning on making enough for 15-20 people for my son's cub scout group and I managed to make 3 - 9x13 pans worth with about half a box of shells left and about 2 cups of the ricotta cheese left over. The kids liked it and so did the adults so I will be making this in the future.

My family loved this!  My toddler doesn't like a lot of meat so I baked 2 chicken breasts and put it in the food processor and then added it to the stuffing mix.  I also sauteed fresh spinach with garlic and added it as well.  This was so great and easy. Makes enough to have a dinner for four and then freeze or share another dinner for four!  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband is still raving over this recipe - he NEVER eats leftovers and actually asked for these for his lunch the next day. I wanted to use up some ground beef that I had, so I swapped the mushrooms for meat sauce and instead sauteed the mushrooms with some chopped onions and garlic and added it to my ricotta stuffing for the shells. I loaded the filling into a zip lock bag and snipped the corner to make filling the shells easier. I did divide this recipe in half since it is only two of us, but kept the sauce amount the same since I hate it when pasta is "dry."

I just didn't love this recipe!  My husband did though, so maybe its just me. I think next time I will do without so much parmesan in the shells and not mix the topping ingredients together. maybe layer the pasta sauce and mushrooms and mozzarella. I will keep trying other recipes like this one until I find one I love!

This was a wonderful recipe!  I followed another reviewer's tips and made a lighter version, with low fat ingredient and less cheese.  To the cheese mixture I added a bag of steamed baby spinach, but I should have chopped it up first--my fault for being lazy.  I also used a no salt substitute for health reasons.  All in all, this one was on the money!

Very easy to make, didn't take very long to prep.  Made WAY TO MUCH.  Had plenty of left overs even after 4 adults ate it.  I want to try a homemade sauce next time.  I used ragu and it was a little bland.  I served it with froozen garlic bread.

This recipe was excellent and EASY! I cut the salt to 1 teaspsoon, as suggested by many others, used fresh parsley instead of dried, and left out the mushrooms because my family doesn't care for them.  It was soooooo good!

Perfection! I used another reviewer's suggestion and place the cheese mixture into a Ziplock bag and chilled it while I cooked the shells. It made it a lot easier to fill them later. I don't mix the sauce and leftover cheese. I just pour the sauce over the shells, sprinkle the cheese, and bake! Absolutely delicious. I have gotten compliments from everyone I have made this for. Thanks!

Love It! I didn't make as much as the recipe since I didn't have that much cheese so it made about half of this recipe and it still made a lot. We had leftovers for three days which made lunch for me fantastic! I'm even thinking about making this to have in the refrigerator just for lunches. I really love this recipe, it's so flavorful!

I will definitely be making this again...and again...and again! My husband is a meat lover so I added ground hamburger to the sauce which turned out well. I also used half the amount of all the cheese and still had plenty to stuffing for the shells. Sooooo yummy!

This recipe is delicious.  I added some chopped green onions to the cheese mixture, and it was a wonderful addition.  I used Cremini mushrooms and a garden blend spaghetti sauce.  SO GOOD!  Definitely a keeper...and I'm going to try the cheese mixture in a lasagna.

This was great.  It took longer than I expected, but was well worth the extra time.  I only made half the filling since I only had 16 oz. ricotta cheese and I added 1 lb. of hamburger to the sauce since my husband and son aren't too big on meatless meals.  Everyone loved it and the leftovers didn't last long.

These shells turned out fantastic. I did follow other users suggestions and added an extra jar of sauce and think I still could have added an additional jar. The tast was great and they weren't too complicated to make. I will definately keep this in my recipe box.

I halved this recipe since I'm usually only cooking for myself. I cooked them 4 shells at a time in my toaster oven. Even with a halved recipe it made about 25 shells. It worked perfectly. I used sauce that I made from a recipe on this site, and just put the extra mozzarella and parm. cheese on top instead of mixing it in with the sauce. I also did not use the mushrooms called for in the recipe. It's very delicious. I might make a few more changes next time... I will put more sauce on the top, probably add some kind of garlic powder to the filling mixture, and cover the shells for part of the baking. All in all this is an awesome recipe, and was very easy.   edited to add: I made some for my family and they loved these. I did add some garlic powder into the cheese stuffing mixture and I cooked them covered for 40 minutes (this was in a 9x9 pan, about 13 shells) and then uncovered and cooked for 13 min longer.

These were really good. I made mine with low fat ricotta cheese and did not need to use any of the eggs. I cut the salt in 1/2 per other recommendations and added garlic powder. I baked mine covered for 35 minutes and then uncovered for 10 minutes. I used a large jar of Prego Sauce with a little xtra lean meat. This was my first attempt and definitely a keeper. My husband and 1-year-old son both liked them.

This was absolutely phenomenal, thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us.  My husband totally loved it.  I made a few changes.  I used 2 jars of Ragu Spaghetti sauce.  To the cheese mixture I added mushrooms, chopped green & red peppers, chopped spinach, spicy spaghetti seasoning, diced onion and a wee bit of garlic (the kind in the jar). I made the sauce as directed.  I put sauce on the bottom of the baking dish, added extra mozzarella to the top of the sauce covered shells and baked it covered with aluminum foil until the last 10 minutes.  OMG ... this is a keepr!

These were amazing! If I could've ate the whole pan I would have.  I followed other suggestion and reduced the salt. I also added spinach and mushrooms in the ricotta mixture.  I can't wait till there's more room in my tummy to eat more.

This was pretty good.  I took it to dinner at a friend's house and they really liked it.  Next time I think I will double the sauce-- a little too dry for me.  I also used 1 tsp. salt and was plenty.

We liked this recipe, but would have liked it more with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pepper rather what the recipe called for.
The salt overpowered the cheese for us.  Also, I needed two jars of sauce and could have used even more.  I will definitely make it again though.  Thanks for sharing it.

These were good and very easy to make. I did add nutmeg and asiago cheese to the mixture. I took the cheese mixture and put it in a freezer bag and cut the corner off...made it much easier to fill the shells!

Delicious! I've been making stuffed shells for years, and my husband immediately said "This tastes so sophisticated, like a restaurant dish." I added 1 tsp. each of basil and Italian seasoning, and cut the hard cheese nearly in half. Beware that mixing the cheese into the sauce keeps it soft rather than crispy.

Boyfriend LOVES this recipe and it freezes well so you can make a lot and eat it next time.  Great recipe for those who cook for themselves or for a small family.

Left out the mushrooms, and added spinach. Also used about 2 jars worth of sauce and unbaked manicotti (because it meant a lot less stuffing). Stuffed the noodles, assembled the dish and added some water then let it sit in the fridge at least 8 hours then cooked as directed. Came out great and had extra to freeze.

I was very pleasently suprised with this recipe. The filling was very good, and flavorful!I would not change a thing! However, I did use 2 jars of sauce instead of one,(althogh it was still a bit dry for our tastes), and left out the cheese in the sauce. I sprinkled both parm. and mozz. on top at the end. I took another readers advice and covered with foil until the last 10 mins.-I think that was very impt. I did also leave out the mushrooms. All in all, this recipe was wonderful, and we will be making it again- just with more sauce next time! Thanks so much!

I made this on a cold Saturday night and it warmed and filled us up. I made enough to freeze and have another time. When I unfroze and cooked them they came out great. Very easy freezer pleaser meal. I left out the mushrooms since we dont like them. Will make again.

This was a big hit in my house!  I tweaked it a bit by adding seasoned ground beef to it.  I also cut back on the salt and added some garlic powder.  I will definitely make this again!

These shells were very good. I made them for a Christmas party and everyone liked them. I used part skim cheese for everything and did not add cheese to the sauce. Next time I will add different veg's and a few more mushrooms.

This was good. I put the filling mixture in a ziploc bag and cut the tip (like a pastry filler) and that cut down on the mess. For my sauce, I included ground turkey breast so that the meal was a little heartier. I also cut back on the cheese so that it would be healthier. I baked it covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for the rest.

It was good.  I followed the recipe except for the amount of parmesan cheese which I thought was excessive.  I couldn't find the jumbo shells so I used manicotti.  The family enjoyed and I will probably make again.

Very easy! We chopped up a bag of fresh spinach and added it to the cheese mixture. We also added some Oregano and fresh garlic. There were no leftovers. This will be a keeper!

Great recipe!  Easy to make.  I added ground beef to my pasta sauce.  I used a pastry bag w/o the tip to stuff the shells easily.  My only change next time is to use another 1/2 jar of sauce, but I like my saucy.

Always a hit..made it 3 times now.  Usually omit the egg actually b/c of lack of ingredients and they still come out great.  I cover casserole dish up with aluminum foil before baking and when I take it off it always looks so good - bubbly with cheese and sauce, and that right there sells it for my eaters.

Good recipe!  Perfect with a little tweaking.  I added italian sausage to my cheese mixture.  About 4 links and more was requested.  From reading the reviews prior I was careful with the salt.  Only adding 1/2 tsp of garlic salt and 1/2 of regular.  It needed more after all.  Next time I will try 1 1/2 tsp.  I did not add the cheese to the sauce and thought it was great.  It's a very rich recipe anyway.  Next time I will cover my shells with sauce as directed.  I took the shells to a potluck and left with an empty pan before everyone showed up.  Yummy!

This was absolutely delicious.  I sweeten my sauce so it was excellant with a sweet sauce.  I would also make it with 2 jar of sauce.  1 jar was not enough.  My husband LOVED it also.  It will definetly be made again!

there is a similar recipe on the box of shells that calls for 1/2 teasp of salt. So I used just 1 teasp instead of 2, it tasted just right. Great Meal.

I accidentally bought a 15 oz. container of Ricotta cheese instead of a 32 oz. container, so I added extra parmesan.  It still turned out ok, but it's a lot of shells for just a 9x13 baking dish.  Next time I would use two separate dishes (or halve the recipe) and use extra pasta sauce on top- the were a little bit dry (but that could have been b/c of not enough ricotta..)

Great hearty Italian Dish. My husband loves it and asks for it all the time. I used homemade sauce, and added some italian seasoning to the ricotta cheese. I didn't think it was salty at all. It even keeps well for leftovers. Great Recipe!!!!!

Great stuff! I made a few changes - no salt, added browned ground beef to the sauce to make it even heartier, didn't add cheese to the sauce - just sprikled on the top the last 5 minutes or so. This is a great dinner - definately a keeper.

I only had half the ricotta I needed so I supplemented with cottage cheese and it got a little runny because of it, but it tasted fine.  Also, next time I would cut back on the salt, maybe even leave it out because I felt the dish was salty enough with the different cheeses.

This recipe is great!  I, like many others, chose to cut down 
on the salt.  I sauteed the mushrooms first in a little olive 
oil. I like the idea of adding the cheeses to the pasta sauce
rather than just dumping them on top-great idea.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

I was unable to find jumbo pasta shells.  I went to three grocery stores and A.J.'s Fine Foods, but no luck, so I used Rigatoni noodles instead.  It was very time consuming stuffing these noodles, but that has no bearing on my four star rating.  I omitted the salt into the cheese mixture and the mushrooms since we don't like mushrooms.  I only gave it four stars because I wasn't overly impressed by the taste of the final outcome.  It was a good, filling dinner, but I would definitely simmer the sauce first for at least a half an hour before cooking or make homemade sauce next time.

Awesome Recipe. First one ive made off of this website, and it was for my boyfriends birthday dinner (he picked it out). I cook quite a bit but never really anything special. I was so suprised at how easy this recipe was, it was really fun to make, just stir up the ingrediants, put it all together and let it bake for an hour. 
The only things i changed in this recipe was using fresh mozzerela cheese, instead of shreaded, and i replaced all of the parmasean cheese with more fresh mozzerela, and then i doubled the amount of sauce to put over the top and added tomatoe bits in there. Last modification was adding minced garlic into the shell stuffing. Turned out fabulous in my oppinion, and everyone at home thought it was great. I love this site!

These are the best shells we ever had!  I used the Quick Pasta Sauce from allrecipies by Liarose. Mixed with the cheese, it was wonderful with this. This is a 5 star plus recipe.

Yummy!  I browned 1 lb of ground beef and added that to the cheese mixture that I stuffed the shells with.  I also added a little bit of sauce to the bottom of the dish before adding the shells.  It keeps them from sticking.  I actually got 2 dishes of shells out of this, so I froze one for later.  We thought that these were even better leftover.  The flavor devolopes more.  Will definately add to my menu rotation.

Would have been better with less salt.  The recipe did not account for the saltiness of the cheese.  Overall though it was good.

This recipe was delicious! I halved the salt following the advice of previous reviewers. I didn't use an entire box of shells, instead I used about 17. I stuffed each shell with about 2-3 tablesoons. I will definitely be using this recipe again. Thanks Renee!

Very good recipe. I also only used 1t salt. That was sufficient. I used a pastry bag with a large star tip to stuff the shells - that made it so easy. There were a few broken shells in the box so I just addred them before the sause. I made it the day before and only baked for 45 min. Thanks Renee!!!

This recipe is great!  I scaled the recipe to make more servings because I made it for Christmas dinner.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing that I did differently was poured the sauce over the shells then sprinkled the mozzerella and parm cheeses over it.

I added Impossible Meat (Vegetarian) to the sauce to make a “meat” sauce. My boyfriend and I are no label/mostly vegetarian. & This recipe was absolutely delicious! Will definitely be making it again. Recipe also makes a ton of food. There’s probably 12 servings out of this. So, leftovers for daysssss.

Used only 1 tsp. salt and fresh parsley. Needed a 10x14 dish since you're using a full box of shells but there were still a few that couldn't fit in. Added a little sauce on the bottom before placing shells in, but felt a half cup of water would keep it from getting dry while cooking. Used a large jar of Prego sauce. Did Not top with mushrooms.

This recipe is delicious and makes the perfect amount of filling for shells. But the filling does come out very salty, I would recommend using half the amount of salt.

Too salty! Next time I’ll use 1/2 tsp. I added half pound ground beef to the spaghetti sauce. Makes more than a 9x13 pan. Definitely needs more spaghetti sauce. I think more Parsley would be better too.

I made this as a veggie option for our son and daughter in law at Christmas and they loved it! Everyone else did, too. I have a slightly different recipe I’ve used; but this was also a good recipe. I wish I could get the hang of using a piping tube, but spooning in the cheese works just as well.

We made a slight twist to the recipe by using smaller shells.  A little labor intensive stuffing the shells, but for an appetizer, it worked out great!  We also added some ground beef to the mixture.  We would definitely make this again!

My husband really liked this recipe. Easy to make, very cheesy and tasty though I omitted the mushrooms in the sauce. Though it was good I prefer a saucier stuffed shell so next time I'll be adjusting and increasing the sauce and adding some without the cheese to the bottom of the pan. All in all a decent recipe.

These came out wonderful. However I did not use the mushrooms that was the only change I made. I also froze some  I just took a couple out to try. And there Wonderful as well.
 I also use the Rios pasta sauce.   It is excellent can’t beat it. I am very Italian I usually make my own but I have served and cutting corners lately and using jarred.  Delicious
Thank you as usual all recipes.com.

Will definitely make again. I used double the amount of Ragu sauce and added a pound of ground Italian sausage. We don’t like mushrooms. Some found the dish to be a bit salty, but we chalked it up to the Ragu and I’ll just not add the 2 teaspoons of salt next time. Hubs doesn’t like straight ricotta, so I did half ricotta, half whole milk cottage cheese. The 12 oz of pasta shells is about 35 stuffed shells; I packed my shells and had about 5 left over. I think it will make 2 9x13 pans, especially with the meat sauce. This is a hearty and very forgiving recipe.

I used the basic recipe for the shells but instead of the marinara sauce, I topped the shells with frozen shrimp scampi.  YUMMY!

I omitted the mushrooms and all of the salt.   And I used my own homemade bolognese sauce.   I doubled the filling recipe, and made 2 and a half pans (the disposable foil lasagna pans).   I brought 2 to a party, and froze the half pan for my family.     Rave reviews!

I love this recipe because it can be switched up to whatever you want to eat. I switched up the recipe a lot. I used taco blend cheese, ground beef, ricotta cheese, eggs, and pasta sauce.

This was great. I used some of the suggestions  - used pizza herbs instead of parsley, used 1 tsp of garlic salt in place of 2 tsp regular salt. Added 4 oz cut up cream cheese to the stuffing.

I made these for the family and we all liked it. My brother, who doesn't even normally eat stuffed shells, had two servings the first day and then three the next day. There was plenty of shells for our familyand they were definitely eaten. I always add a little bit of oregano and basil to pasta dishes too.

Sooo good.  I took the advice of other posters and cut the salt in half, and I am glad I did.  I added Italian seasoning to the ricotta, but other than that I made it as written and it was a hit!

two trays gone! A hit.... I only put 1/4 t salt, that was plenty. Decreased the parmasean to 8 ounces. I used the Mozzarella that has the cream cheese in it for easy melting, 2 bags. Will definitely make this again. I wish I made 3 trays

Would definitely make again. Maybe with less filling then the recipe calls for. Made way too much for two people. But that could have been my fault for not reading the servings size.

I had about 1/3 of the ricotta mixture left over after I stuffed the shells and I didn’t skimp at all. Also I don’t recommend mixing the cheese in the sauce. It works better just putting it on top after the sauce. I also sautéed mushrooms and left them on the side for my husband as I don’t really care care for them.

I omitted the mushrooms but that's just a personal preference.

I used all dairy substitutes  as I'm lactose intolerant. 
The only thing I will change it not putting mozzarella in the sauce over top because it makes the sauce too thick. 

It makes so many shells. Yum!

I made this last night for dinner and I loved it.  I've never made stuffed shells before and this was a new experience for me. I cut the recipe in half and I was still able to make about 24 stuffed shells which is pretty much a lot for an adult and two children. I ate about 4 stuffed shells and was full! My husband opted out because he does not like cheese all that much. Although on the brighter side my kids loved it and they're very picky with food.  Would recommend this recipe to try.

it was okay, kind of bland for me. The stuffing needed more salt, garlic, basil. maybe a basil pesto would have been better.

I made this for family who came over last weekend because my cousin is a vegetarian.  Everyone (6 people) came back for seconds and I think would have had thirds if I had anything left over.  My   cousin mentioned to me twice in the following few days how great dinner was.  I am making it again tonight for my parents.  A great recipe.  I used a little parsley but I also added oregano.  In my opinion dried parsley is tasteless and my husband and I prefer the flavor of oregano.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly

This was a decent recipe but I was a little fooled by the reviews! It was extremely salty with only using 1 tsp. I don't think ANY extra salt is needed!

Made exactly as directed. Good but you definitely need at least 2 containers of marinara. I only had one and it was not enough. I would make this again but would consider adding more seasoning to the cheese mix, plus more sauce.

I made only half, which just enough for my family of five.  However, I ran out of filling for my 15th shell...  I stuffed it with shredded mozzarella cheese and chopped pastrami :)  Everyone agreed that this dish was outstanding, and that I should consider adding some pastrami every once in a while!! (left mushrooms out, just plain sauce which is how we like it)

Me and my family loved it! Although I did make some very small changes; just with amounts of cheese, seasoning (I'm use to taste, taste, taste and I don't measure). Also to take what I've got and "make it work".  I will accompany it with a protein (like meatballs) next time, but...this is a good recipe, IMHO ? Especially as a base. It is enough for two dishes, I saved filling for lasagna that I'll make in next two days. 
This with a fresh salad...a winner for us. ?

The only change I added was some mild Italian sausage to the mix and it was DE-licious........ I will make again and again..
I tend to put a spin on it each time until I perfect it to my taste buds.. But I will say, The recipe as it was, was spot on for flavor.
Thank You Renee

Delicious! Halved the recipe, served with Bruschetta chicken, salad & bread. Fed 7 and had leftovers. Huge hit, will definitely be added to rotation.

Really liked this- used 16 oz of  conchiglioni. Halved the filling recipe and used about one and a half jars of marinara. I also did not add cheese to the sauce but probably would add italian sausage or ground beef in the future. You can tailor this to your liking which is the great thing. I put it the filling in a ziploc, piped it and squeezed it into the shells which seemed to work well. I froze about a third of it and baked the rest in a large aluminum pan at 375 for a half hour. My daughter and husband LOVED it!

I'll make this again. I used it only a jumping off point, as I didn't add salt or pepper (I really don't know why people add salt & pepper to food), nor mushrooms, and I used an Italian cheese blend from Aldi. It sure was good though!

Overall this was a good recipe. Made it as described and it was enough to make two 9x9 square pans - one to eat and one to freeze for later.  They turned out fine but just seemed to be missing *something.* Next time I will maybe add 1/2 tsp each of garlic and onion powder to give it a little more flavor.

Delicious!  I followed the advice of others..1 tsp of garlic salt instead of just salt, no mushrooms, no eggs,  use ziplock back for filling.  Perfection!

Great quick dish without meat! I used marinara sauce instead of pasta sauce to not take away from the ricotta and spinach.

I made this recipe pretty much as is except I cut down the salt a bit, added Italian seasoning and doubled the sauce.  I had a full house for Christmas and everyone loved it - from the 2 year old grandson to my husband.  There were no leftovers!  I will definitely make this again.

These were fun (and really therapeutic to prepare).  Cooking for 30 people one night I made several pans, so I was able to experiment with various sauces and both cottage and ricotta cheeses.  I’m not a cottage cheese fan at all (actually grossed out by it cold), but it was just as good as the ricotta if not better.  Definitely tried the ziplock bag method and this worked out beautifully.  My main advice would be to stuff each shell with generous portions of the cheese mixture; the ones I didn’t fill as much turned out a bit dry and over-cooked.  I’ll make this again.

This was very good.  All my family loved it.  I did reduce salt to 1 tsp per other reviewers, and I subbed dried Italian seasoning for the dried parsley.  I reduced the grated parmesan to 1/4 c. in the ricotta mixture, and did not add mozzarella and parmesan to sauce.  Instead, I put shells together, topped with mozzarella cheese, sauce, and then sprinkled parmesan on top before baking.

Very good! A bit heavy, but good nonetheless. Next time will add more tomato sauce since it was just a touch drier than I would have preferred.

I never made stuffed shells before I thought it would be too hard but this was easy and it tasted really good. I omitted adding salt into the mixture because I think it would have been too salty and I am glad I did. I will probably add some garlic and oregano with the parsley next time. Other than that, it was easy and good. I am glad to have added another recipe to my weekly meal planning. :)

Good recipe except waaay tooo salty.  2 tsp is too much. Next time I'll do 1/2 or 1 tsp max. I also sauteed the mushrooms to give more flavor.

Yes, it was okay.  You need to add a sprinkle of nutmeg into your cheese.  Trust me on this.

Excellent shells! A few additions though: spinach, ground turkey, Italian seasoning, rustic cut sauce + an additional can of plain sauce, minced garlic. I use every recipe on this site as a base and then add my own touches based on intuition and pallate. Thank you for the share!

This was great as written-I didn’t change a thing! I did it all in 1 9x13 pan as directed, kept foil on the top for 45 minutes then cooked for 10 more minutes without and it was perfect. I had a very happy husband and picky child -I will definitely make this again!

This is a really easy and simple recipe to make.  Although you will need extra sauce once it is done, and also some garlic salt enhances the flavor. Will recommend this to anyone and next time I will be adding hamburger.

I only had 15 ounce of ricotta cheese so I used 2 cups of cottage cheese. Add granulated garlic and onion pepper roughly table of each.   Everyone loved it. I made my own sauce with puree tomatoes and add garlic, salt, pepper and basil, onion pepper.

A little too 'salt forward' - with two teaspoons of salt plus all the cheese, was a little much for my taste.  I will make again but will drop the two teaspoons to one.

Made this tonight. It made 2 trays worth. I made my own sauce with ground beef and mushrooms. I used a 32 oz container of ricotta and pretty much eyeballs the amounts of park and mozzarella. I don't put cheese in my sauce. I did sprinkle parm  when baking. Covered it. Ten minutes before finishing l added mozzarella. Was a big hit. Definitely will do again.

The only change I made is I added spinach. This came out delicious! You have to cover the pan with aluminum foil for the shells not to dry out. And uncover for the last 10 minutes.  I served with Italian sausage. This one’s a keeper! I will definitely make this again.

Made a couple of changes to the sauce. Onions, garlic, celery, shitake mushrooms, red pepper flakes, brown sugar and the usual suspects of powdered / granulated spices. I will probably make it again although stuffing the shells is a pain.

I made a few changes.  I put cheese mixture in a large zip lock freezer bag and cut corner after refrigerating for a half hour and stuffed shells.  I also added garlic and Italian sausage with Italian seasoning to mix.  Also added spinach to mixture.  Use 3times the sauce and I added a can of diced tomatoes Italian in flavor.  Yummy!  Oh and cover with foil until last 10 and then remove and add cheese

This was a great base for a stuffed shell recipe. My husband and I are not fans of mushrooms, and so I swapped it out with some Italian sausage. Tasted just like lasagna, and made a big enough portion to share with my mom-in-law, and have enough for my husband and I to each have dinner and lunch.

I have been trying to collect recipes for things I make without a recipe. This was a good starting point.  I did find it to be a little heavy on the Parmesan.  I had some shredded Parmesan that I wanted to use up instead of the grated, so that may have been the difference.  The filling was not as creamy as my normal no recipe shells.

I personally like spinach in my shells, though the rest of my family does not.  When I make this again I will mix the filling, then take 1/4 of the mixture and add 10 oz frozen spinach and the browned filling from 2  sausage links. That will approximate the recipe "Cheesy Stuffed Shells" submitted by Kimber on this site.

Wow, these were good!  I didn’t add mushrooms, because I’m not a fan.  Doubled the sauce and didn’t put any salt in.  I also didn’t mix the cheese in with the sauce I layered it on top!  I will certainly make again!  These were tdf!  Looking forward to having my lunch tomorrow already!

Not the worst thing I’ve ever eaten, but to me it wasn’t good. I hate to give bad ratings on a recipe, because everyone has different taste, but I really regret that I spent so much time making this. It’s very mediocre and bland IMO. Kind of like a cheap pasta dish you’d get at Pizza Hut. Way too much shredded cheese, too.

This recipe is so salty! I was a little concerned when I saw how much salt so I only put 1.5 tsp, I wish I would have just done 1 and reduced some on the parm. It turned out okay, like it was edible but I’m shocked this recipe has so many good reviews.

This dish was fantastic. It makes a lot and is very rich. Not something I plan to make often but will make again.
Used a larger baking dish. Piped filling into shells using a ziploc bag which still caused a mess.

I made it as the recipe said except half the salt and a pinch of garlic salt in its place.  Excellent results ! An instant favorite.

This is good but not my favorite. The filling is too loose for my liking and yes, it was cooked long enough. and Im not really a fan of adding eggs to the ricotta but decided to try this because of the reviews. I’ve been making manicotti for decades and I actually already have a “shell” recipe but wanted to try this one. I followed the recipe exactly and It’s not bad, just not my favorite. Too much pepper, if I ever fixed it again I would scale it back to half the amount and omit at least one egg if not both. I would use fresh parsley instead of dried, it’s much more flavorful and I don’t think I would use the mushrooms either (and we are HUGE mushroom fans in our house) either that or I would use half the amount of mushrooms.

Great recipe. We don’t like mushrooms so I omitted them but I found the amount of salt to be perfect. It seems others thought it was too much salt but not us. I also added a bunch of garlic powder and made it kind of like a lasagna. One level of shells followed by one level of mozzarella and so on. Delicious!!!

This was really good. Only change made was the addition of  garlic to the filling, 2 jars of sauce, and leaving out the mushrooms.  Surprisingly easy too!  Everyone loved it.

Very yummy! Followed the recipe almost to a T. I just added more Italian spices, along with garlic and onions powders. Just to taste. I also make my own spaghetti sauce, so I just used that. :) I topped with slices of fresh mozzarella instead of incorporating it into the sauce. I will make this again!

It was very good except it came out too salty. The parmesan cheese is already salty plus the salted water to boil the shells. I only put 1 teaspoon of salt (directions said 2) and it still came out salty. I recommend using less than a teaspoon or maybe nothing at all for the stuffing. The parmesan is salty enough. You can always add salt after if not enough. I also used Victoria's tomato and basil sauce which tastes amazing. The sauce got salty after adding the other half of the parmesan cheese. Either don't add the other half of the parmesan to the sauce or add less. The sauce was the salty part not the filling. If it wasn't for the saltiness I would have rated this recipe a 5 star.

This was awesome.   My daughter doesn't like mushrooms so left it out.   A bit more sauce is needed.   But I liked it anyway.  Absolutely enough for 5 people.  Served with garlic bread. Had enough left over  to make another 9x9 pan to put in freezer.

This is my first time rating and reviewing a recipe, but it was so good I had to do it.  I do hate when people modify a recipe and then give it rave reviews, but I had no choice.  What I did  since I had bought ricotta cheese, but not enough, was I added 8 oz of cream cheese to the ricotta.  Actually using the cream cheese made it easier to fill the shells.  It made it creamy and gave the filling more substance.  Other than that except for not using a whole lot of parmesan as I think mine was too old being kind of a darker brown, I did use Italian seasoning and left out the salt and pepper those were the only modifications and it turned out fantastic.  So I only gave it four stars since I had made those few changes.  I think I would keep making it like this, as with just ricotta I think it would be too difficult fill the shells with that mixture.

Really good. Made a few changes. cut parsley to about 1.5 tsp, salt to 1 tsp and about 1/2 tsp black pepper. I used Classica Cabernet marinara. I also sauteed some spinach, garlic and crumbled sausage in olive oil and added it to the cheese mixture. Put the cheese mixture  in a plastic bag and piped it into the shells. Boys loved it

I used this recipe to guied my own chicken stuffed shells and it was great! I halved the recipe, heated up some leftover shredded chicken (about a cup and a half) with some sauce in a pan, and layered the chicken under the ricotta mixture. And no mushrooms for us!

The only thing I changed about the recipe was the salt content. After reading the reviews, I cut it in half. I thought the salt was good that way, but my husband thought it needed more salt. We liked this recipe. It was a little time consuming, but I made two. One for today and one for the freezer. I'm not a mushroom fan, but I liked them in here. This is a good recipe!

The ricotta cheese mix is FANTASTIC!! I use it for other recipes as well.  I could eat it with a spoon :) I cover for the first 30 min to stop it from drying out and leave out the mushrooms.

I made this and it turned out very very good, but that was because I made some modifications. When I tasted the filling I could tell it was lacking in flavor (it did seem very salty as others said but that ended up cooking out, thank goodness). I added some Italian herbs and spices. I also added a 1/2 pound of Italian Sausage to the filling and my Dad (who's Italian) raved about it. I will definitely make this recipe again with the modifications I made. I gave it a 3 because the original recipe  was lacking flavor like I said, but it is an excellent start! It made two large pans of shells so I used 2 jars of 24 oz Classico Parmesan and Romano sauce. I also added a little bit of water to the bottom of the pan so it wouldn't get dried out, I find it helps with pasta since the pasta tends to soak up the moisture. ;)

This recipe was delicious. I added a clove of garlic and my trademark dry Sherry to the bought sauce. Also added a little hot sauce. What I can't figure out is how to get all those jumbo shells in a 9x13 pan. I didn't want to make two layers. I froze the other half of the stuffed shells sans sauce for later use. So it worked out well for the two of us. I also think I will go back to cottage cheese, large curd.

This is a great recipe.  It takes a little bit of work to stuff the shells but the end result is well worth it.  I brown ground Italian sausage and stuff it in the shells prior to adding the ricotta mixture. I think it's because I add the sausage that I end up with a lot of extra ricotta cheese mixture and sometimes extra sausage as well.  When this happens, I spread the excess over top of the shells before pouring on the pasta sauce. I've made this multiple times and my husband really loves it. Serve it with Texas toast.

I cut back on the salt, recommended by reviews (there's salt in the cheese). I just tried the finished dish, and it still seemed slightly salty to me. The next time, I'd do 1/4 tsp or none at all.  I used homemade marinara sauce, added garlic powder to the cheese mixture and did not use mushrooms. I piped the cheese into the shells using a baggie with a snipped off corner. That made a messy job fairly easy.  I made a half version, lining a 13x9 pan with foil and spread about a cup of the sauce on the bottom. The next time, I would spray the foil first with cooking spray (slightly sticking). I didn't add the cheese to the sauce; just sprinkled it over the top. To prevent the sauce from drying out (as I read in a review), I covered the pan with foil, removing for the last 10 min. Delicious and something I would definitely make again! Thank you for the recipe.

Made this & added cooked Italian sausage. Cottage cheese blended in food processor is a nice replacement for Ricotta, if needed.

I only wish I had read the reviews beforehand.   I usually do, but for some reason  I decided to forgo it this time.  While it definitely had the potential to be truly delicious, it was way too salty!  2 teaspoons is definitely way too much salt!  I plan on making it again seeing the the rest of the dish was cheesy, creamy goodness,  but I'll definitely be cutting way back on the salt.

Excellent recipe by cutting the salt to 1/2 to 1 tsp max. A few tips - cook shells for 8-9 minutes instead of the 10 recommended on box. Immediately run cold water over them in a colander, using your hands to make sure they're separated from each other and not curled in on themselves. I make sure my ricotta mix is all ready to go to prevent shells from drying, which will make them sticky and rip. As others have stated, put ricotta mix in a ziploc bag and snip corner to pipe filling into shells. You'll be amazed how quick and mess free it is. I cook mine for 45 minutes covered and then 10-15 uncovered. Enjoy!

I love stuffed shells, but a simple variation to this is to use lasagna instead of shells.  Cook the lasagna a little al dente, rinse, drain and set aside.  My changes to the ricotta filling - it always tastes better with fresh herbs  (I use parsley and basil, chopped finely) instead of dried. I omit a teaspoon of salt and add a teaspoon of garlic powder, and omit the mushrooms only because nobody in my family likes them.  I also mix in a half cup of italian bread crumbs. Add an egg  or 1/4 cup more ricotta if you need more moisture. Pour a thin layer of sauce over the bottom of your baking pan.  Spread the lasagna with a thick layer of the ricotta cheese stuffing, and roll it up.  (If I want to make a meaty dish, I cook 1-1 1/2 lbs of beef on the stove and add marinara sauce and parmesan cheese and mix it well. After I spread the lasagna with the ricotta mixture, I add a layer of the beef mixture and roll them up). Place the roll ups in the baking dish, I can usually get 4 in each row, to make about 16 total in a 9X12 dish.  Spread the remaining ricotta mix over the tops of the roll ups.  Cover with tomato sauce and mozzarella and sprinkles of fresh parmesan before cooking. Delicious!

Very good, and pretty easy, too.  I omitted the mushrooms as I prefer to sauté them separately, and just didn't have time for that.  The filling made a ton!  It generously filled all the shells and there was quite a bit left over.   I used fresh parsley, and when the shells came out of the oven, I topped them off with a chiffonade of fresh basil. The leftovers heated up nicely the next day.  Made my own marinara, Lidia Bastianich's recipe.  Almost as easy as opening a jar, and tastes so much better!

Awesome recipe.  Just as I was expecting.  Sure, it could be built on from here, but there is really no lack in what is in this recipe right now.  There was enough shells to go for two pans, so be prepared for that.  Luckily, I already had two pans at the same size.  I cut the salt in half and that was enough.

I diced the mushrooms and sautéed them in olive oil before adding to the sauce. I doubled the amount of sauce and put some on the bottom of the pan before placing stuffed shells in. I used soft fresh mozzarella instead of shredded. I put diced mozzarella in the ricotta filling and put cheese slices on top. I did not mix the cheese in with the sauce. Thanks for the recipe:)

This is a wonderful recipe.  I do not like cottage cheese in my shells so this was exactly what I was looking for. Only changes: I use homemade sauce,  I add a package of frozen chopped spinach to the filling (defrosted and well drained of water) and I omit the mushrooms. All of the above are just my personal preferences.  The recipe is still great exactly as written.

Love this recipe!! I put into 2 8x8 tins and freeze one for later. I dont include mushrooms and add some italian sausage. I add italian seasoning, basil and oregano to the sauce. I bake for 45 mins covered (make sure to spray the tinfoil with non-stick spray) then 15 mins uncovered.

This recipe is AMAZING!! My family couldnt get enough! My boyfriend is 100% Italian and said they were probably the best stuffed shells he has ever had! I will absolutely be making this again and will most likely continue to make this often in my household. I follow this recipe to a T and followed the side note of adding in mushrooms to the sauce, I wouldnt change a thing! because it is perfect! An absolute MUST-TRY for all cooks!

This recipe had great flavor and the family loved it! I did add meat bc we r meat lovers. I added a pound of lean ground beef and half a pound of ground Italian sausage to the sauce and cheese mix that you pour on top. Glad I made this, will definitely make it again!

Every single one of my kids loved it (4 of them) that NEVER happens. I added a lot of garlic cuz we love garlic but it was amazing. I added sweet Italian sausage into the ricotta mix and took out the mushrooms. We're not a huge fan but man it was a good choice.

I have made this recipe many times and we love it.  I usually use a 32 ounce jar of sauce (Rao or Victoria brand) instead of the 28 ounce size in the recipe.   Delicious!

Seriously amazing. I added 10 oz of frozen chopped spinach (squeezed the water out), skipped the mushrooms this time around because I didn't have any. I used a whole jar of sauce on the bottom of the pan, placed the filled shells open-side down, then used another jar of sauce on top. Then I spread the rest of my shredded cheese all over the top and popped it in the oven covered in foil. Removed foil for last 10 minutes to brown the cheese.

This recipe makes enough filling for 1 whole box plus another 3 or 4 shells (and I over-stuff mine!).  A 13×9 pan holds just over half the box of shells. I filled the remaining shells anyway, and popped them in the freezer on a cookie sheet for about an hour so they wouldn't stick together, then transferred them to a Tupperware container to save freezer space. These freeze and reheat super well!!

Very tasty.  I divided the recipe & added pepperoni to one half for the meat lovers in my family.  I reduced the salt to 1/2 of what is recommended, though.

Probably 3 stars as written, but 5 stars with just a few tweaks.  As other reviewers have noted, I did a ricotta/cottage cheese mix...added a package of frozen spinach and a package of Jimmy Dean hot sausage that I browned...used the food processor and the "ziploc piping bag" method, and it got rave reviews from all that tasted it.

I love this recipe! The only changes id make is that my husband doesn't like mushrooms so we pulled those out.  He also requested that we add Italian sausage and olives. I used a jar of Prego,I think it was 24 oz so I'd defiantly use more sauce. And yes I'm going N to make two pans this time, last time I had to layer the shells

Covering with foil in the oven is a must for me, otherwise the cheese on top is just a brown crust of cheeseless flavor. Otherwise, the simplicity of the recipe is a knockout for me and my wife. We make this often (minus the mushrooms, cause bleh!)
Recipe is even better when you make your own sauce, which is also easy. Find a recipe on allrecipes that uses red wine in the sauce and reserve some wine for dinner. Also, put the filling in a gallon size zip lock bag, seal, and clip a corner off for easy filling. Snip the corner to about the size of a nickel, then just pipe the filling into the pasta, way easier than spooning; save that for bed after dinner.

I've made this so many times now, my almost 2 year old and Husband absolutely love this recipe! I leave the mushrooms out but do everything else the same and it's always amazing! Prepping is so easy also which is a big bonus in my opinion.

I like to use fresh parsley and add browned beef to the sauce.   This is a wonderful make ahead and freeze meal.  Can put cheese in a plastic bag, nip the corner and pipe into the shells to speed up prep.

I made this and halved the recipe since it was for my three kids and me.  I didn't use the mushrooms because I didn't happen to have any,  but added some fresh spinach to the mix.  It turned out very tasty and we all enjoyed it.

Fun recipe to make. I found it easier to fill the shells after refrigerating the cheese mixture for an hour or two. Only change I made was to use fresh basil instead of parsley. Great recipe for large family dinners or parties.

I made it exactly as the recipe said and the bottom of my pasta shells burned pretty bad making most of it hard to eat. It also wasn't as flavorful as some other recipes I've eaten. Maybe needs more spices.

It's very good.  Too much salt though, and I didn't like mixing the sauce with the cheeses to put on top, I would rather dump the sauce on first then sprinkle the cheeses on.

We love stuffed shells and they are very easy to make. These are very cheesy, but they turn out great. I didn't have the fresh mushrooms on hand, but I don't think that this dish was missing anything without it.

Made this tonight and everyone loved it!  I added a pound of  beef.  Instead of just Parmesan, I used a blend of Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago.  And instead of "jar" spaghetti sauce, I used the Fresh Tomato Marinara Sauce recipe (also on this site).  Instead of mixing the reserved cheese with the sauce, I added it on top.

One thing I noticed is that  this made a lot. I think I wound up with quite a bit more than I needed for the stuffing and wound up filling 2 of my dishes (I might have one smaller than 9x13).

Either way, this was fun to make and definitely a hit.  Would definitely do this again!

This turned out great!!! Absolutely delicious! I read some of the reviews before making and only used half of the recommended salt. Also I chose to exclude the mushrooms and did not put in the full amount of motzerella cheese as it seemed to be a bit too much. Also I would add a bit more sauce for additional flavor

Awesome. Didn't make any changes and it was just fantastic.  Everyone loved it so much at Thanksgiving, I had to make it again today. Thanks for sharing!

I cut the salt in half as recommend by other comments, used Italian seasonings in place of the parsley and added cheeses on top. It was a huge hit!

This was amazingly good. The first time I didn't have mushrooms so I added hamburger meat to the spaghetti sauce and it was wonderful. The second time I made it exactly like the recipe and it was equally as good.

I made this for the first time today and it turned out very well. I did discover the need to add more than one jar of sauce. I also added some green onions to the cheese mixture to give it some added flavor! Great recipe, my family really enjoyed it!

Only gave 4 stars because I did not make it exactly as the recipe states.  I used half the salt as others recommended and had to use additional sauce. Other than those very minor changes a wonderful recipe!

This is an excellent recipe. I have made it several times and it freezes great! I just threw it in the oven frozen and baked an extra 20 minutes. We have swapped the mushrooms for spinach and really like that.

I love this recipe of stuffed shells, and so does my husband! I'm sure it would taste amazing as is, but for a bit more flavor and spice I like to add a pound of cooked ground hot Italian sausage to the ricotta mixture. So good!

Amazing.  I doubled this recipe, including the cheese filling (family of 6).  It was a huge hit.  I did not use Parmesan cheese, but added extra mozzarella instead.  Will make again soon, didn't last that long in my house at all.  Teenage daughter even brought them to school for lunch!

Love this recipe...mushrooms were great in it.  We made our own sauce from diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, lots of garlic and some Italain seasonings. This is gonna be a regular at our house.

Cooked and drained mild Italian-seasoned ground pork or ground beef (or a half-and-half combo of the two meats) adds flavor to this meal and makes it a bit heftier but the pasta and cheese is quite filling on its own. Will make again and again but always with meat and additional Italian seasoning.

We made this recipe as is and all of my kids liked it. It was salty and at the end we decided that if we make it again we will add some meat. It didn't seem like there was enough sauce so I might be adding a little more of that as well next time. Overall though it was a simple recipe and it came out good. We will probably be making this again in the future.

My family enjoyed this recipe and I followed many suggestions. One, if you use Italian Seasonings that contain salt, do not use any salt. Second, prepare the cheese ahead of time. Third, use a jar and a half, one is not enough and two I think is too many. Lastly, my family missed meat in this dish and requested sweet Italian sausage to be included. I am going to try it again and rate it after I have cut out the salt, less sauce, plus sausage.

This is the best stuffed shell recipe I have made thus far. My husband loves this dish and it is anything but bland. Since mushrooms are used in the recipe, I also used mushroom preggo sauce and it really did the trick. I would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a flavorful stuffed shell.

I decided to use cottage cheese in place of ricotta as I had some on hand and cottage cheese is often used in place of the more expensive ricotta.  I only had a 24-oz carton of cottage cheese so I reduced the other ingredients accordingly.  I also did not cook the shells ahead of time.  I gently filled the "raw" shells with a teaspoon.  For the shells that were too tightly curled to fill, I put them in an 8 X 8 pan (as my 11 X 7 pan was filled already with the stuffed shells) and spooned the filling over them.  I spooned the sauce (I had homemade sauce) over both pans, covered tightly with aluminum foil and baked for 90 minutes.  The shells cooked in the steam. I think the salt could be cut in half or even eliminated. I think it's strange to mix the cheeses with the sauce.  I think it would have been better to spoon the sauce over the shells and then sprinkle the cheese on top.  

The taste was OK-it was kind of bland.  I am surprised the recipe doesn't call for oregano or some other spices/herbs commonly used in Italian dishes.  This recipe didn't "wow" me so I'll keep searching.

Awesome recipe! Only made minor modifications, half the salt, half the black pepper per our preference.  Only had 15 oz of ricotta so added 4 oz of laughing cow to make up some of the difference. Used 1-8 oz bag of shredded 4 cheese Italian and 1-8 oz bag of sharp cheddar. Only used ~6 oz of Parmesan. Amazing!

Tried this on a cold, Sunday winters night and loved it! It is definitely more cheesy than saucey but amazing! Sometimes I don't like a lot of sauce and this to me is a true cheese stuffed shell. I also added more mushrooms and added artichokes to the sauce on top. Excellent!

Delicious! Even a hit with my ultra-picky 4 year old. Made this a few nights ago for dinner and it was so well liked by my family that I made another batch and stuck it in the freezer  for an easy meal  for a future "Lazy Mommy" night.

These turned out great! I did make some modifications: I left out the mushrooms (though I bet they would be good), added a package of frozen spinach, and used a mix of ricotta and cottage cheese. I also crumbled in a package of tofu in with the egg and cheese mix, which worked well.

Great Recipe!! Though I added a lot less salt and only used a tiny bit of salt when boiling the pasta. The first time I made it, it was way to salty. You can always add more salt after when it is on the plate.

Great recipe - I halve the recipe, use a 9x13 pan, and 2 jars of sauce. I also add in garlic pepper, salt, and Italian seasoning to the ricotta mixture. Delicious!

Soooo good, definitely a keeper. I prepared it the night before (w/o baking) and just covered it and put it in the fridge. When I got home the next day, just threw it in the oven for 50 minutes and came out perfect.

Awesome recipe. This was my first time making stuffed shells and I think I did a pretty darn good job! The only thing that I did different was using less salt (1 teaspoon) and I added garlic and onion powder to the filling which made it taste wonderful. Next time, I'm not going to add the mozzarella cheese to the sauce mixture. It made a very thick "sauce" if that's what you can call it. It was hard to entirely cover the shells. Next time I will just mix the Parmesan cheese and sauce then sprinkle mozzarella on the final product. Also, I used a 11x15 pan and still couldn't fit all of the shells in it. I ran out of filling before all of the shells were filled but this was my fault since I stuffed them alot :) I'm just saying that you will most likely need a bigger pan than a 9x13.

I thought it was a great start...used 2 jars of Rao's Marinara Sauce though.  Only 1 teaspoon of salt, no mushrooms, added 1 lb ground beef to sauce.  I also used 2 pans!  Great flavor!

Tonight I made this for my husband and two little girls, ages 3 and 2. Everyone LOVED it. We had it as a part of our "Meatless Monday" on my meal plan. I wouldn't say it was super cheesy like other reviews had mentioned, but that also could have been because I changed it up a little. I made my own pasta sauce with a leftover pasta sauce I had in the freezer that was basically, tomato sauce, sauteed onion, diced tomatoes, spices, ect. Your basic homemade pasta sauce. I also added spinach to my ricotta cheese mixture before stuffing the shells and I did add the mushrooms to the pasta sauce. I then poured my CHUNKY pasta sauce over the shells and then topped that with the 2nd half of the Parmesan and mozzarella. I will be putting this in my kitchen's recipe book :)

Very good! Whole family loved it! Only had enough ingredients to make half the filling but it was enough. Used quite a bit less salt. Didn't use as much parmesan as called for. Doubled the sauce. Added a little basil, oregano, and garlic powder to filling. Covered with foil for 45 min. Uncovered for last 10 min. Put mozzarella on top instead of in sauce for last 10 min of baking. Used all the called for noodles but other reviews said to make two trays. We didn't bother. There's enough for lunches and leftovers, though. Probably could have frozen some it. We will be making this a regular dish!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out to be a little too salty.  Next time I don't think I'll add salt at all, and I'll use marinara instead of spaghetti sauce.  Otherwise, it was delicious.

Delicious! I made this as a side dish to my panko chicken and my husband (and I) thought it was really really tasty! I made the recipe as shown, except I used fresh parsley instead of dried and I used shitake mushrooms. For the sauce, I used Mario Batali's Cherry tomato marinara. Yum!  I didn't measure the salt or the pepper and probably didn't use two teaspoons of salt.  Our green vegetable were frozen green beans with almonds.  It was a really delicious combination.  We will be having this again!

Made these tonight. Pleased. Would've liked to have known how much to stuff inside each shell. I ended up with a few shells and no stuffing. I'd recommend, thanks to hindsight, about a heaping teaspoon - actual teaspoon, not measuring spoon. Boiled the shells al dente as described. Rinsed with cold water to stuff. Ricotta only came in 30 oz. container. Used not quite half the mozzarella and freshly grated Parmesan, but did not top with the other half.. went light.. just enough to add cheese to the entire top after covering with sauce. Like another reviewer, I didn't want to overshadow the creaminess of the stuffing. I also halved the salt and pepper. Like yet another reviewer, my husband does not like meatless dishes, so I added 1# of ground sirloin, browned and drained, to 1 jar of Prego... only 24 oz., and 1 can of diced tomatoes. I let that all go for a hard simmer about 30 minutes while dealing with the pasta, so the meat would break down, etc. A nice sauce, just not marinara. We also skipped the mushrooms. I think they'd be nicer with a straight marinara. I'd like to mention that I used a LARGE Corningware 9x13++ lasagna dish, and had I had stuffing for all of the shells, they would not have fit. Use your largest possible 9x13, or anything bigger. I held it to 45 minutes.. 35 with foil on, last 10 with foil off, and it was fine, delicious and pretty, but definitely a mild flavor. I'd play with the sauce in the future, maybe spice it up. Good recipe though, thanks.

This was an excellent recipe. I cut it in half as there's only two of us and it was perfect.  I only added some ground beef to the sauce as my husband isn't real fond of meatless dinners.  Will make this again for sure.

good, but unfortunately not satisfying.  Needed something.  Added some garlic and spinach to the filling and that tasted great.  It really wasn't devoured that quickly in our household. might make again because it was easy.

Far too salty with two teaspoons of salt!And I did read  the first few reviews available and no one mentioned this possible typo... Trying to add more plain ricotta and trying a few other tricks to see if we can salvage it.

Made this last night...pretty good.  I have not used ricotta in years and to be honest it tastes just like cottage cheese to me.  I will make again and tweak the seasoning, seemed like something was missing to me.

Too much cheese in this recipe.  The Parmesan cheese dominated the whole dish.  I also don't prefer all that cheese added to the sauce.  I am sensitive to dairy and cheese but I eat plenty of it, and this dish really bothered my stomach.  To each their own.  If you have good, strong insides, you may be okay.  I had to scrape away a lot of the cheese I could even taste or feel the shells.

My husband and I loved these!  I put frozen spinach (cooked in micro & squeezed out the liquid) & 1-2T of fresh basil in the food processor and added it to the ricotta cheese mixture.  I always try to add veggies in wherever I can.  I didn't have any mushrooms, but next time I will be sure to add the mushrooms.  Unfortunatley, 4 year old didn't enjoy this and she's a good eater.  She ate it but didn't love it.  Maybe it was the spinach I added??

Loved this recipe!  I didn't have dried parsley on hand so I used a mixture of basil and italian seasoning.  Also, I added ground sausage to the filling so that the recipe had some meat.  It was delicious!

Made a few adjustments according to other reviews.  Cut the salt to 1/2 tsp, which was plenty.  My husband who loves salt, thought it was great without it.  Also used about twice as much sauce as it called for.  Came out great

As prepared, I was a little underwhelmed. I didn't realize how much cheese went into this recipe til I added the 1/2 lb of mozzarella to the pasta sauce. Next time, I will halve the amount of cheese in the sauce and double the amount of sauce. Otherwise, the shells and stuffing were delicious!

Excellent!  Several of the reviews were very helpful.  I used my own sauce, and covered the dish with foil until the last 15 minutes, at which time I put slices of fresh mozzerella on top.  People who said it was too dry were mostly folks who left out the mushrooms- they add moisture to the recipe, and I kept them in.  I did not put cheese in the sauce, but did add 1/2 lb sweet Italian sausage meat.  Also, putting the ricotta mixture in the fridge for an hour or so did make it easier to work with.  Good recipes, good reviews, this is why I always come back to Allrecipes.com!

This recipe was great! I made this for my boyfriend and I and had plenty of leftovers and will be making this again for my mom. We're meat lovers in this house so instead of a 32 once container of ricotta I got a 15 ounce.

I browned some ground beef, 1/3 onion (feel free to add more if your onion fans like us), and salt, pepper, garlic salt to taste and put it aside. 

When I did the ricotta mixture I used 15 ounces of ricotta, and 15 ounces of ground beef into this mixture. 

Then I added the rest of the ground beef to the sauce and poured it over the shells as stated. 

and I removed the mushrooms since I'm not a huge fan. Saved some mozzarella and parmesan cheese and sprinkled it over the shells at the very end for a nice layer of cheese.  Yum!

These were good shells. The sauce was good and blended with the cheese well. But, felt like it was missing something??? Any suggestions?

very good recipe.  I will make again.  The only thing I did differently is added hamburger to the pasta sauce because my family thinks you have to have meat in your meal.

Fantastic!  The shells are hard to find here, but we found them at WalMart. I halved the cheese mixture, which stuffed 12 shells.  I even let them sit in the fridge stuffed (but not with sauce) a day before cooking.

My husband said this is a 10. I can't taste anything because I'm sick but he raved about it. I did add a pinch of nutmeg, 1/2 a tsp. of crushed red pepper, 1 T. fresh basil and a minced garlic clove to the ricotta mixture. I also used fresh parsley because I have a ton of it in my herb garden.

I added one pound of ground italian sausage (cooked through, of course) to the ricotta mixture.  My husband & son loved them!  It adds some heartiness to the mix.

Made these for dinner tonight, and they were great. I was skeptical because the recipe didn't call for meat (and I didn't have any ground beef unfrozen) but my husband ended up loving them!

The only suggestions/recommendations I have is to definitely add more sauce..1 jar is NOT enough (makes them too dry). I would add at least a half a jar more. Also, the cook time seemed way too long. I put ours in for 45 minutes and they definitely would have been done after about 30-35 it seems. Other than that, excellent, budget friendly and easy recipe!

This is the best recipe I have ever made. I used a little more mozzerella on top than it called for because I'm a cheese fiend. This recipe definitely makes enough for two 9 x 13 pans but it's worth it. LOVE it!!!

Excellent! I followed the advice of another cook and chilled the mixture before spooning into the shells. I, too, would recommend cutting the salt in half. I used a big jar of Classico sauce. Delicious! I froze half of this recipe for later. Can't wait to eat it again!

I split the recipe in half and still ended up with enough filling for over 20 shells. I added spinach, Italian spices, and sauteed mushrooms, but it turned out tasting rather bland. I thought it would have more flavor. It probably needs sausage or some other meat.

My  husband loved this.  I added spinach into the ricotta mixture and also some dried basil and oregano too, I also did a 16oz tofu/16oz ricotta mix instead of all 32 being ricotta because we're vegetarians and wanted to add some more protein and I like to keep our dairy intake somewhat lower.  It kind of muted the cheese flavor but still tasted pretty good!

It is pretty good for just cheese. I think it would be better with some spinach or meat in it. It is kind of dry, too - with only 1 jar of sauce. I would like this recipe with more sauce and a bit more texture in the shell stuffing.

This is a regular in my house. It tastes great and is sure to impress. The only thing I have modified is cutting the salt in half and I leave the cheeses out of the sauce but still use the half portions in the filling. Yum!

This dish was so good! I made it for some guests and they kept going back for more! Its very easy to make, just a little time consuming. The only differences I made, was I went with low fat mozzarella and low fat ricotta. I used two cans of sauce because one would not have been enough. Also, my husband is a meat guy, so I bought some hot italian sasuages and grilled them, then shredded them and mixed them in with the mixture. Soooooo good. Loved it!

I read many of the reviews prior to making this and thought it would be awesome!  However, I found it to be waaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy too salty to the point I wouldn't even eat it.  My husband found it edible but I won't be making this one again.  Still in shock that no none else found it too salty.  I double checked and I did use the correct amount of salt.

This was very good, but I tweaked the reipe a bit. I sauted the mushrooms in garlic and olive oil and added it to the Ricotta mixture. I also added ground pork sausage to the ricotta mixture. However, I ended up with a lot of extra filling; I think that the amount of ricotta used could be decreased. I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty! It was quite a hit with my family. I’m gonna second everyone who said to use two jars of pasta sauce--it made the dish very dense, but ended up being an appropriate amount. Also, do be careful how you stuff the shells: make sure the shells are al dente (a little bit stiff and chewy) so that they don’t fall apart when you try to stuff them. And don’t stuff them overfull. I thought I’d have leftover ricotta mixture, so I stuffed them to within an inch of their lives. I ended up with four shells left over with no cheese to stuff them with. Oops.

Very very good. The whole family loved it, even my husband who is usually not a fan of meatless dinners. It is time consuming, but worth it.

This is an awesome recipe! I left off the mushrooms but still turned out great.  Very fast prep too.  This would be a great freezer recipe too.

Family loved it! Will make again, you only need half of the recipe for the whole box of shells.  I made half and still had  quite a bit of ricotta left over.

I made this for company this weekend and it was a big hit with everyone, even my 3 year old daughter! I used a 46 oz. jar of pasta sauce instead of 32 oz. after reading some other reviews. Loved the addition of mushrooms & the flavor it gave the dish. Definitely will be making this one again & again!

This was very delicious!  Because I have to, I used gluten free shells, and it still was delicious.  I made the recipe as posted, but I only added 1 tsp. salt, and added one 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes, and a clove of minced garlic to flavor and extend the tomato sauce instead of cracking open another jar of marinara sauce.  I used a spinach florentine marinara, and it was delicious.

This was pretty good!  I did everything just as the recipe calls for except the mushrooms as my family does not like them.  The one and only complaint was that there was to much parmesan in the mixture on top.  Next time I will probably half the second amount of Parm and then it would taste fine.  Will make again!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

great reipe but i added my own touches. left out mushrooms i love them but my family does not. i used 3 jars of sauce because i made meatballs. i did not put the cheese in the sauce i added to the top the last 10 minutes of baking. i also did not use salt but california style garlic instead. My hubby and kids loved it. ty for this.... i hate recipes that call for cottage cheese. yuk, This was perfect.

This is a great recipe (minus the salt). I took the tip from other reviews on using a plastic bag to fill the shell much like icing a cake - what a time and mess saver.  I also covered the shells with a meat sauce - outstanding.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good!  I didn't have ricotta, so I used cottage cheese put through the processor.  I omitted the eggs and used 1/2 t. salt (from another reviewer).  I used 1t. Italian seasoning ( in place of parsley)and I had a little (maybe 2T. - 1/4c) of fat free sour cream left over from another meal, so I threw that in. I was not intending on changing the recipe that much, I just did not have all the ingredients on hand (poor planning on my part).  The result was wonderful and I will make this again in the future!

I love this recipe ! I cut out the salt and pepper and instead used Grinders Italian Seasoning ( it has sea salt, pepper, Rosemary, red pepper ) I did not cover my shells when I put them in the oven and they dried out so they really need that cover when going into the oven. I will make this over and over again.

Excellent stuffed shells recipe.  We use our own sauce and I am yet to try it with the mushrooms, other than that followed the directions to a T and they've come out perfect everytime.  We love having this for dinner with a nice salad.

These were awesome! My mother even liked them and told me to put them on my "best dishes" list.  She generally doesn't like anything "fancy," which she thinks stuffed shells are. I impressed myself with this dish and will probably make it often.  Loaded with delicious! :-D

I have been making this recipe since 2007 and I always get compliments on it when I make it for other people. Even my sister, who does not like ricotta, absolutely loves these shells. My grandmother asked me for this recipe tonight so she can take to church on Sunday. And my 10-year old nephew, who is a picky eater, gobbles these up like they are candy.  This recipe is a sure hit!

great starter recipe.  I added garlic powder and onion powder to the cheese mixture as suggested by another reviewer.  I also added more sauce.  all the shelled didn't fit in one 9 x 13 pan though.  which is fine if you want to freeze a smaller pan for later.  thanks for the recipe.

It was tasty, but I expected more because of the effort I had to put in. This tasted just like my lasagna, but took twice as long to make. I used a jar and a half of sauce, one jar isn't enough. I also used just one egg, and basil instead of parsley.

I would deinitely suggest to cook and sautay the mushrooms first, before mixing it in with the pasta sauce. The mushrooms were still quite firm after baking it in the oven. Other than that, the dish was great!

I used low fat cheeses to make it a little more healthier and added wilted fresh spinach along with fresh parsley.  I used a homemade tomatoe sauce and skipped the cheese in the sauce.  Instead, I sprinkled a bit of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on the shells before baking.  This recipe got rave reviews from the boys!

Yum! Yum! Yum! Yum! Yum!  I first found this recipe on the back of the shells box… then one time... it wasn't there.  I am so happy to find it here.  These shells are simple and delicious!  They also make spectacular leftovers!  You really can't miss.

I altered the recipe a bit by adding a pound of ground turkey and more sauce. It was good but a bit salty for my taste so next time I wouldn't put the salt in.

DELICIOUS! I added 16oz of frozen spinach to the cheese mix. Used a 12oz box of shells and had about a cup of filling left, so may cut down on the filling recipe a little bit next time. But these froze well and made quick and AMAZING dinners on work nights :-)

Wonderful!  My whole family loved it. I cut back on everything by 1/2 except for the mozarella cheese, otherwise it makes a huge amount.  I added spinach and did not add any salt (the cheeses have enough salt).  Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend on Valentine's Day. I skipped the salt based on other reviews and I added 10 oz. spinach into the cheese mixture to give it a little something extra. It came out great and his whole family loved it! I'll definitely be making this again.

really awesome when you omit the mushrooms and add in some lump crabmeat. never made it as is, so i don't know how that would taste...other than the fact that it is most likely fantastic.

This is sooo good!  I've made it a couple of times already and we always over eat it's so good.  The last time I ended up having to add a little extra sauce cause I also added ground beef to the sauce mixture.  Definitely will do that again cause it was DEEEEEEEE-LICIOUS!!!

I made these last night and was kind of disappointed. They weren't bad just bland. Instead of parmesan cheese I used a 6 cheese mix, left out the salt as others advised and added garlic and onion powder.
I think next time I'll add some osrt of meat, either hamburg or sausage, maybe that will give some extra flavor.

The husband and kids loved them, I made 2 pans one with mushrooms and one without.

I used this recipe for Manocitti instead of shells, the prep time was really long, look me almost an hour and a half to get them from cooked and filled and in the oven. also used 2 8x8 inch pans instead of one 13x9. they tasted awsome though, definetly will make again!

This recipe was very tasty. The cheese mixture was fabulous. The only thing I would change is maybe making the pasta sauce a bit thinner, mine was very thick.

This tasted great!  I added more sauce and parmesan while omitting the salt altogether (per other reviewers' suggestions).  Next time I will try adding some spinach and garlic to the ricotta mixture.

hmm, not what I was expecting I guess. The filling was very bland. I'll have to create a new filling and try it again.

Tasted good, but WAY to much salt!  It would have been 5 stars if it wasn't for the salt.  Perhaps it was a typo?  Next time I will do 1 teaspoon only.  It seemed like too much to me when I saw it and it was!

My opinion?  WAY too much salt, way too much  parmesan - need another egg AND you may want to forgo the mozzarella too!!

The cheese filling is a perfect and very tasty combination.   I added about a teaspoon of fresh basil that comes in a jar.  Instead of jarred sauce, I used my own homemade leftover spaghetti sauce.  Delicious!

The only downside to this dish to me was it was a little too saucy. That is easily remedied when prepared in the future. Quite tasty and great for leftovers.

I made this recipe with only a 16 oz jar of ricotta and only half the requested amount of sauce (not purposely).  I was a little worried that It wouldn't come out good due to this, but it was still delicious.  Will definately make again, wonderful recipe.

Delicious recipe. I also cut out the salt and didn't cheese the sauce. The only thing I'll remedy in future batches is to fill those shells to overflowing. My own fault. Thanks very much!!!

Excellent.  I made a mistake the mistake of overly filling each one, which made them too cheesey for the shell.  This left me short to fill about 10 of them.  I couldn't re-distribute the filling because I made them in batches and poured the sauce on the top. Bad decision.  The recipe is excellent as is (cutting out most of the salt as suggested), but the next time, I will try one reviewer's suggestion to place a little browned hamburg (or Italian sausage!) on the bottom of each shell and top with the cheeses.  This really is easy and a great party do-ahead that everyone will love.  A definite keeper in the category.  Thanks.

As written, I have to rate this recipe a 4.  However, I have to say that this was one of the best new recipes I've tried in a LONG time with some of the changes I made.  I think the salt content to the cheese mixture is way too high, so I halved the amount.  I also made my own marinara sauce because I could tell this dish deserved that extra touch.  Lastly, I halved the amount of cheese to the sauce mixture because I feared it would make the sauce way too thick.  It was awesome!!!

This recipe doesn't need added salt; there's enough salt in the cheese and sauce. I didn't use mushrooms, and made my own sauce. The filling turned out nice and fluffy and my family and I enjoyed this dish.

Great recipe!  I halved the recipe and still made 16 shells, which fed four adults.  Used a decorating tube without tip to fill and it was soooo easy.  Minor modifications:  decreased salt to half-teaspoon as others suggested; used double the sliced mushrooms for a half recipe just to use them up; container of ricotta was only 15 oz, but parmesan was 5 oz, so I figured it all evened out.  I've already committed this one to my recipe box.

Turned out well. My husband loved it, but it was a little to rich for my daughter and myself.
