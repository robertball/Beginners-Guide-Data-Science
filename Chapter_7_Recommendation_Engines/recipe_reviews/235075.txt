I added a huge chopped carrot, and let it simmer a couple of hours, but followed the recipe otherwise.  I can't handle much spiciness at all, and this was just right (I used no more than a pinch of cayenne).

Nice soup. I pureed it and didn't need any flour.Increased the spices for my own preferences.

Flavorful soup! Like another reviewer, I added a carrot. I also threw in a bouillon cube along with vegetable broth, I pureed some of the soup and used coconut milk instead of evaporated milk. I omitted the flour hoping that pureeing would make it thick enough, but I think I must have added too much water. The soup is still flavorful and the texture is fine,  just not thick. I'll make this again. The coconut gives it depth! Thanks for sharing!

I added 1 carrot .  Omitted flour.  Added 3/4 cup coconut cream instead of milk. And left out the curry and cayenne. Soooooo yummy!

This soup is quickly becoming a favorite. I make it exactly as the recipe says. It's a great way to get in some winter veggies, even my 2-year-old likes it!

I've made it now a couple of times. I'm sure the recipe as is would be great too. For me I'm not eating white potatoes or milk, so I left those out. I also added some carrots and spinach. It was still very flavorful and thick as I put it thru my Vitamix.

I'm not vegetarian, but I wanted to make something different.  The soup came out wonderful!  I made just two changes:  I was out of yellow onions, but I always keep chopped scallions in my freezer, and I used about a 1/3 cup of that.  As for the vegetable broth, my favorite is using Knorr's Vegetarian Vegetable Bouillons--they may not be low-sodium, but they impart lots of flavor without having to using additional salt.  I put mine in my food processor to get the consistency I wanted.   I served it with some sesame seeded Italian bread and butter...filling meal.  I would eat this year-round.

This was good and easy! I used two small leeks, a while head if broccoli, and two regular white potatoes. I used an immersion blender at the end to just leave a few scattered veggies bobbing in the soup. The house smelled great!( I also skipped the yeast.)
