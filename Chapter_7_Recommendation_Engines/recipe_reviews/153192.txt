This was fast and easy for when you are short on time and you could easily add any of your favorite pizza toppings. I think some fresh herbs would really jazz up the sauce.

This was really tasty and is great not just for people with limited space but also when cooking just for two, it cuts down on the cost of hydro. I had to cook my potato longer than the time specified, and I also re-arranged them in the microwave halfway through cooking to avoid "hard spots". (I do this anytime I cook them this way). Very tasty lunch for the kids, would be good with some cooked sausage or bacon on top too.
