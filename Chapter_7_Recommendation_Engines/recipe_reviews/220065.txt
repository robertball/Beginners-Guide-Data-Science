This was my review when it was still a personal recipe: I really appreciated this recipe because we wanted a cool treat today but we're quite low on money. My grandma made something like this for us kids when we were small so it was nice to remember her and talk about her a little while we made this recipe. My eldest son helped me make these and we accidentally made a little slip and added a little more than a quarter teaspoon of vanilla extract but it didn't affect the outcome of the pop. We all enjoyed these this afternoon, the kids especially. I thought they were quite sweet but my kids and husband thought they were perfect as is. I'd like to try this for myself as a diet recipe, perhaps using a diet cream soda and eliminating the extra sugar OR using honey as a substitute for the sugar. As is, huge hit with the fam!

I need more stars !!!  These were outstanding and so easy.  I made first batch using cream soda, second batch using root beer.  Both were terrific. Can't wait to try orange crush, red pop, grape soda and..............

I had the honor of making/reviewing this recipe before it was published (Congrats!), and have made it MANYT times since... Here's what I had to say: AWESOME! These tasted even better than I had hoped they would! I went in search of small plastic cups, to no avail, so I just used my popsicle mold and I poured the leftover mixture into an ice cube tray. I made these the night before to allow them to freeze solid. I had an easier time getting them out of the ice cube tray than the popsicle mold (no fault of the recipe, I've always had trouble with this mold). No matter, they were still wonderful with just the right balance of sweetness and flavor. Gabe and I just got finished 'taste testing' them, lol, and we both declared these delicious! Thanks, SHORECOOK, for such a wonderfully refreshing treat, that will be made over and over many times! :)

This turned out even better than anticipated. I added a touch more vanilla and used slightly more cream soda than water for more intense flavor, and it was wonderful. Incidentally, while waiting on them to solidify in the freezer I discovered that about 3/4 of the way through, they make an excellent vanilla slush. I think next time, I might try to pour the mixture into goblets, then freeze for less time in order to make slushies out of them. Either way, these are awesome. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I reviewed this recipe first on June 25, 2010 when it was a personal recipe.  My review went as follows:
YUMMY!!!!!! I just served these to 6 girls that aren't afraid to give their opinions... All I heard was "this is yummy", "do you think that your mom has more?", "can I have another when I'm done this one?". Well needless to say, they were a huge hit!!!

I made this delightful frozen snack using locally brewed "Creme Soda" which is light brown; hence the brownish colored pops.  The bottled soda pop  is 12oz so I adjusted the recipe quantities accordingly: 12oz soda, 1c. water, 1/4c. sugar (I used Splenda granular) and 1/8+ tsp. vanilla.   I made 4 popscicles and 1 tray of pop cubes.  The pops taste wonderful and refreshing.  I plan to make a second batch using orange soda and orange extract since my DS loves orange soda.  Thank you SHORECOOK for the fun recipe!

These separated in the mold...rock hard plain ice center with most of the flavor at the top and bottom.

I tried it again by simmering the soda in a heavy bottom pot until it reduced by 1/3. Added 1/2 cup sugar while it was reducing. Cooled the syrup. Added 1tsp Vanilla extract. Stirred, froze. They never got rock hard....much more like a store bought popsicle.

Wow that's good! I was literally just eating one of these delicious pops and accidentally hit the Done button before I got a chance to write my review! I wanted to try this recipe because of all the awesome reviews, so I followed the recipe exactly and these were AMAZING! Will definitely be trying variations in flavors but this is an absolute keeper and I intended to make them regularly during the summer for a cool treat. Thanks for the recipe!!

Oh yum. Typing with one hand as I eat this... I think I would up the cream soda next time in place of some of the water. Deeeeee-ricious!
