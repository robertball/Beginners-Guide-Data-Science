I made 1 serving of this as I was just making for myself. I used frozen berries and decided to omit the ice cubes because of this. It's winter here.. So didn't want anything freezing cold to start my day. I don't drink juices so used a couple dollops of plain Greek yogurt instead. Added some almonds to garnish as well. Will definitely make again.. This would make a make summer breakfast.
