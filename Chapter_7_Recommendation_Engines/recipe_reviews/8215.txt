This cake tastes great and really is so easy to put together but the directions says to bake in 30 minutes.  It was a good thing I was looking out for the cake because it only took 20 minutes to bake.

A tasty, moist cake. I followed one reviewer's suggestion and boiled the prunes in prune juice, then strained them and added more juice to make up the 1 cup. My other changes to the recipe were: cutting the sugar by half (you won't miss it)and adding a few tablespoons of cocoa powder. I omitted the clove, nutmeg and allspice for this one. The chocolate prune combination turned out very yummy without being too rich or sweet.

This was a really beautiful cake and was raved about by everyone who tasted it.I cooked it in a 10inch round tin and it took longer than specified (nearly double the time).It has great keeping qualities and stays beautifully moist.

I have made this once so far, following the review that suggested subbing 2 tablespoons cocoa for the nutmeg,  etc, stewing the prunes in the prune juice, and halving the sugar.  This came out delicious.  I topped with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site, but would be fine plain.  I was expecting a pumpkin or banana bread type texture but it yields a moist and fluffy cake which calls for topping.  This recipe is great for using up prune juice because a whole bottle is hard to finish!

I had some prune juice I didn't know what to do with and came across this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except for I substituted two bananas for the cup of prunes (I didn't have any actual prunes on hand). I also added some chocolate chips. It turned out delicious!!!

this was delicious and light. too sweet for me though. next time i'll cut the sugar by 1/4 cup and see. i made this with gluten free flours, a straight 1:1 substitution and it's perfect. i boiled the prunes in prune juice, and then topped up what was left to make the 1 cup. nice recipe.

I love this cake with coffee glaze. even my fincky 11 yr old ate it... w/o complaint. She didn't believe me that it was prunes... The recipe is great as is.. but 2nd time around I made the following changes: reduce the salt to 3/4 tsp., exchanged shortening for butter, and I boiled 1 c. prunes w/ 1 c. water and pureed it... omitting the prune juice as I didn't have any. I added 1 container of baby food prunes. I'm going to try to make a lower fat/calorie version today!

I have searched for this recipe for years. My mother used to make it at the holidays and this appears to be exactly it. The only thing I did different was frost it with cream cheese frosting, very moist and tasty cake.

Delicious!  But do cut the sugar by half, since the prunes are very sweet already.

I made this today and asked my family what they thought some of the ingedients were. No one guessed prunes! 
I appreciate being able to make smaller portions and It's nice that the website offers the conversion for recipes...my math is lousy. I am a new member and just love this place!

This yields a flavorful and moist cake.  For the cooked prunes, I removed the pits and chopped up a cup of prunes, packed fairly tightly.  I then added about 3/4 cup of prune juice and cooked them until it became a thickened mash.  I followed the reviewers below and substituted the nutmeg, allspice, and clove with 1 rounded teaspoon of cocoa powder.  I used a bundt pan (picture above) and the cake was done in 30 minutes.  Also, per the reviews below, I used 3/4c sugar.  This made the cake perfectly matched for the a glaze.  I recomend this festive creation!

Made exactly as described, except no nuts, and in a tube pan.  Turned out perfectly tasty and moist.  My toddler really liked it.

Love this cake its super yummy! 
Only used 1/2 cup of sugar & was still sweet, moist & delicious!
I don't see why people are so fussy about eating prunes, its only a dried plum! LOL One taste of this cake I'm sure they'll change their minds :)

Looking for a way to use up some prunes and half a bottle of prune juice, I came across this recipe.  I made this, not expecting to like it.  Prunes are not a favorite of mine, but I didn't want to waste them.  I made this deliciously moist spice cake and didn't tell anyone what the ingredients were.  When the recipes states; 1 cup prunes, cooked and chopped, I cooked them in 1 cup of the prune juice for about 15 minutes at medium heat.  The liquid had cooked out and the prunes were nice and soft.  I then continued with the recipe.  I poured this in a bundt pan and baked for 30 minutes.  I let rest in the pan for 5 minutes; then flipped the pan.  I took half a cake into school to have people try it.  EVERYONE loved it and could not believe it when I told them what the 2 ingredients were.  I would make this again, but not tell people what type of cake it was until after they ate it.  The word "prunes" is a turn-off to a lot of people, including myself.  I frosted this with 'Maple Butter Frosting' another AR recipe.  This is a keeper; just remember to keep the ingredients to yourself until after everyone tries it.

The taste is popular with my whole family and reminds me of old fashioned molasses cookies because of the spices.

Great way to use leftover prune juice!  I used 1/2 cup butter instead of shortening and 1 cup "baby food" prunes instead of cooked prunes.

The second time I made it, I baked in mini-muffin tins and baked for 10 to 12 minutes for a perfect kid-friendly snack-size cake.

Interesting! It was moist and a little sweet.  I only made this to please my grandmother who requested it.  But the family liked it!

Excellent recipe, I did not expect it to be so moist! I halved the sugar as well, and used brown sugar and whole wheat flour. I also used butter instead of shortening. It turned out terrific in about 37-38 mins in my oven. Thank you for a wonderful fall spiced cake recipe!

I like butter too much, this recipe called for shortening. Although it is nice and soft it just misses the yumminess of butter.

Like many others, I made this only because I had some leftover prune juice. But now it's in my recipe box. It tastes like a spice cake--not overly sweet but it definitely hits the sweet spot! Like another reviewer, I added mashed bananas instead of the prunes. (I had those leftover in the freezer as well!) Oh yeah--and I left out the nuts because I didn't have any. Otherwise, no changes. Absolutely fabulous!

My great aunt use to make this cake for us every Christmas. She would make it in a in a Bundt pan and would drizzle with a cream cheese frosting.  Great tasting cake.
