This is, hands down, one of the best burgers that I have tried from this site and definitely worthy of more than 5 stars! Aside from scaling the recipe down for 2 burgers, adding some salt to the pico and a little garlic powder to the guacamole, I kept the recipe the same. Served these on toasted buns. All of the flavors blended perfectly...DELICIOUS! I will be making these often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Loved these. Fantastic flavor, and I was doubtful initially because the recipe didn't call for any "seasonings" beyond the pico and guacamole, really. I think a lot of the great flavor was because I used bison meat (seriously, it's so much yummier than your standard ground beef and healthier too!) but it was mostly just a great recipe. And by the time I mixed in all the onions and so on into my meat, I had enough to make about twice the patties (2oz meat per patty), which was awesome - I could have two burgers for the guilt of one! :) Thank you for the recipe; these burgers were delicious!

Easily one of the best burgers I've had with slight changes. I grilled the burgers on the BBQ, added garlic salt to taste in the guacamole and used lightly toasted sandwich thins. Great recipe. Thank you DonnaB.

A nice change from plain hamburgers. Next time I think we will just add sliced pepperjack on the burgers.
