Blueberries and lemon really go well together. I like to top my loaf with a glaze made by mixing 1 tb lemon juice and 2 tb sugar. I brush it on the hot loaf and return it to the oven for 5 minutes.

Quick, wonderful recipe! I had added another 1/2 cup of blueberries that I didn't want to go to waste, and it was too much.  Made the bread too chock full of blueberries - it was almost blue, and a little too heavy.  GREAT taste though - will definitely make it again (just won't add more than a cup of blueberries!).  Thanks for the recipe!

While the bread is delicious, the blueberries still sank to the bottom of the pan and the loaf stuck to the bottom of the pan.  My husband and I used forks to eat the bread that stuck to the pan!  Next time I'll try more flour on the berries and I will grease and line the pan with greased wax paper.

I had a ton of blackcap raspberries, so I substituted them for the blueberries.  Since I was making two loaves, I made 'buttermilk' using lemon (1 tbl. lemon juice to one cup milk) and an additonal tsp. of grated lemon zest to add to the lemon flavor.  Also added vanilla extract.  Here's a helpful hint to eliminate the berries falling to the bottom of the loaf:  spread a small amount of batter in bottom of pan before mixing in the frozen berries.  Then with a very gentle hand, mix the berries into the remaining batter, then spread in pan.  It seemed to help a lot.  Also topped with lemon glaze (is it obvious we like lemon ... a lot?)

I made this recipe with my oldest son. I didn't bother flouring the blueberries, we just tossed them in when we added the flour. We did make these a little different than the recipe asks--we combined all the wet ingredients, then the dry with the blueberries folded in with the flour. It was just easier that way. We got 12 smallish muffins out of one recipe. My son wanted to make them a little prettier so he sprinkled a quarter teaspoon of sugar over each muffin mound before baking. These turned out well but lacking in blueberries. I think next time we make this recipe we'll double the blueberries.

This bread was quick and tasted good. It could have used a little more flavour so I made a lemon glaze and drizzled it over top of the bread and helped it out with the little bit of sweetness I was looking for.

Love this recipe -- the loaf came out picture perfect, moist, and delicious. I even altered the recipe (didn't happen to have butter or milk at the time) and used vegetable oil and water, and it still turned out great. Best of all, the blueberries were evenly dispersed through the loaf. Thanks for this keeper!

This bread is okay, but nothing spectacular. I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh, but still did the whole rolling berries in flour thing. I really wish I hadn't, because all the berries sank down to the bottom of the loaf, which looked awful and caused the bread to stick to the pan. I've never floured the berries before, and they never sink to the bottom, so I'd say that that tip is no good, at least for me. The flavor and texture of this bread were pretty good, but nothing spectacular. Thanks for sharing the recipe, but I won't be making this again.

Very very good!  I followed the recipe just as written and the result was fantastic.  I made a simple glaze by mixing some powdered sugar with milk and then squeezed the juice from 1/2 of the lemon that I zested into it.  Poured this over the top after it sat out of oven for about 10 minutes.  So fresh, not too sweet, perfect!

This bread was really good. I was skeptical about only using lemon zest (i LOVE lemon) but it was plenty! Yummy and will make again during blueberry season!

I just made this recipe yesterday, didn't change a thing, and today everyone is raving over it. I'm not sure exactly how much lemon I used, but I zested 3 small lemons and the amount seemed perfect to my taste. I'll be making this often! Thanks for the great recipe!

Yummy> I didn't have a fresh lemon so I used lemon concentrate instead if the lemon peel. I only used 3/4 sugar and added a lemon glze on top (lemon juice and powdered sugar.) I used one egg and two egg whites. I melted about three tablespoons of butter, and then added low fat sour cream to make up the 1/3 cup butter called for. Also used half whole wheat and half white flour.  My kids and husband really liked it.

I love lemon loaf, but I found this recipe not as "lemony" as I like (i like a strong lemon flavour). None-the-less, it's moist and blueberries are always good. To sweeten this recipe and give it a stronger lemon flavour I made a Lemon glaze from 1/4 cup icing sugar and the juice of half a lemon. Thanks for the recipe. =)

Yum, yum! I tweaked this recipe quite a bit.. used lemon meringue parfait fat free yogurt instead of melted margarine. Had the usual quick bread texture, I think it was almost the same as adding butter in; maybe just not as crumbly. (even better... makes it easier to cut and eat.) Omitted lemon zest and used 1/2 tsp lemon extract instead. Also, I didnt even use blueberries- they're not in season over here, and I just wanted a nice lemon bread. Plus, I sprinkled sliced almonds on top just before baking. They ended up getting slightly toasted, which helped bring out their flavour. So easy to remove from pan too. It looked so beautiful, golden yellow- a wonderful recipe, I fell in love with it, I'm making it again!

I made this as a dessert, and it turned out wonderfully.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I made a lemon-butter icing which I brushed on right after the bread came out of the oven.  This made the top crispy and sweet.  This bread was a huge hit, and I have been asked by my family to make it again.

Pretty tasty, especially considering how quick and easy the recipe was.  I ended up having to bake for 65-70 minutes, but then again I have a wonky oven.  My one suggestion is to make a glaze, as I made one and it added to the bread considerably.  I mixed confectioner's sugar with milk until I got a good consistency and squeezed in 1/4 of a fresh lemon.  Highly recommended.

WOW. This is fantastic (although a bit more like cake than bread). The taste and texture are perfect, with the lemon helping to subdue the sweetness a bit.  Rather than a breakfast item, I'll probably make as for a snack cake or dessert bread, but make it I will!

Fantastic.  I grated the lemon over the bowl for extra lemon flavor--making sure to catch seeds...it turned out wonderful and got great reviews.  Also made another loaf with blueberries and raspberries...used frozen both times-which I highly recommend to keep the nice lemony color.

Hello!  Made this yesterday after reading lots of reviews.  Like so many people said, my blueberries sank like a ship too, even after a healthy dose of shaking in flour.  I did use a tiny amount of Lemon Extract since I had some in the cabinet.  Hubby happy.  MY  mistake was overdoing the glaze I made....poked lots of holes to let it really get in the bread & I overdid it! So it was soggy but wouldn't have been.  Think I will try again maybe chopping blueberries up into smaller pieces & then tossing in flour for even dispersal????  THanks!

This was a lovely, delicious quick bread. The hint of lemon was perfect with the blueberries. A soft cake texture. Yummy stuff !

i thought this was a good recipe.i didn't have a lemon so i used lemon juice in place of rind..and i added 1/2 tes vanilla.i use 1 1/2 cup blueberries.it was too many 1 cup is definitly enough..i had more berries then cake..i did use 1 tab sugar 1/2 tab lemon juice.for a glaze on top 4min before bread was done ..it turned out good.will make the recipe again..only reason i give this a 4 star,is i find loaf too small..i would either use smaller pan or double the recipe..

This bread was fantastic!!  I used blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries--all wild, and I made the glaze that another reviewer suggested.  A friend told me that he would "buy this bread by the loaf".  I'm baking 2 more loaves right now!!

Make sure you really dredge your berries so they don't sink.  I ended up using 1 1/2 tablespoons on the berries and the second time around, turned out perfect!

Yummy, dense quick bread. It had a lot of lemon flavor since I added extra lemon zest and a teaspoon or two of lemon juice to the recipe as well. to make it easier for me I melted the butter and that worked out fine too since I did not have time to wait for the butter to soften. We will make this again!

This is a great base recipe. I tweaked it a bit to my tastes: increased the flour to 1 3/4 cup, used white whole wheat flour, decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and substituted buttermilk for the milk as well as added 1/2 tsp of baking soda to react with the buttermilk (this is enhanced if you let the batter sit for about 10 minutes). This makes a nice, thick yet fluffy batter into which you can gently fold the blueberries. I nearly doubled the blueberries with no sinking problems. I added the glaze on top .

This was great!  I followed the recipe exactly & it was perfect!  Used frozen blueberries & they ended up evenly throughout the whole bread.  This makes a moist bread and that is not too sweet.  Great recipe!

I would give it a 5, but I had the same problem as others. I tried the hint of layering some of the batter, then adding the blueberry/batter, and even flouring the berries did not keep it all from sinking to the bottom. The taste however is very good. I added a light glaze of lemon juice and confectioner's sugar for a little extra sweet. My loaf was also a little short, but my loaf pan is large, so that could account for that. Can't wait to try some in the morning with coffee. Tastes good, just wish the blueberries hadn't sunk.

Made this recipe with minor changes and it came out great. I added a a tsp of lemon extract and a 1/2 tsp vanilla to the milk. I also glazed the top with a butter lemon confectioners sugar mixture as it was cooling. Otherwise no changes, the fresh blueberries didnt sink, although the loaf isn't very "deep" it might be a full loaf at 1.5 recipe.

Sorry- this bread was just okay.  I did substitute cranberries for blueberries, which was great, however, the actual bread part was heavier than I had expected, didnt seem to rise well, and somehow, although heavy, not incredibly moist.  The berries were tasty, but the bread was bland and needed more flavor.  The only part that was good was the top part, where all the glaze and berries were. And speaking of the glaze, it is far more than needed.  You could easily get by with half the glaze.  Maybe it would have been better if I used blueberries as called for, but I don't think that was the problem. I won't likely use this recipe again.

My husband and son in law and husband really enjoyed it, but I think I would use a smaller loaf pan next time, I added an extra egg but I always do. I don't usually eat what I bake so can't give a personal comment.

Very good and moist.  I used frozen blueberries so I skipped step 1.  I used a food processor for the remainder and before adding the blueberries I poured some batter into the loaf pan to prevent the berries from settling to the bottom.  This recipe is a keeper.

I love this recipe! I did not have lemon zest so used 2 TBSP lemon juice. I also added some pureed calamondin I had on hand, about 3 TBSP.  The result was delicious! I made two loaves and froze one to take to my mom's.  This one is definitely a keeper!

The taste was rather bland, the berries sank to the bottom, causing the loaf to stick to the bottom and the cake crumbled apart. I definitely will not make this one again.

Excellent! Very moist. Didn't have blueberries so I used raspberries, didn't flour them, came out amazing. Was a true hit with friends and family. I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and added a lemon glaze to the top of the cake. Would definitely recommend.

The bread was quick and was overall ok, but it was sort of bland and needed to be a bit sweeter. If I make this again I would add more lemon (not enough lemon flavor - maybe lemon juice from the lemon I zested) and maybe a bit more sugar.

Well if it wasn't for my own error in not spraying my pan enough, this would have been perfect.  I'm still eating it in broken up crumbles though.

I found this recipe delicious! It was moist and tasted great. I added a glaze to it though. But, overall the bread was to die for.

Nice texture with a light lemon taste.  The lemon glaze is essential and adds a nice lemony finish.  Next time I think I will add some lemon extract as another reviewer suggested, as the bottom layer, put in to prevent the blueberries from sinking, didn't have very much flavour to it.

This is the best blueberry bread I have *ever* had.  Instead of 2 tsp lemon zest I added 1 tablespoon lemon zest and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice b/c I really like how the lemon and blueberry flavors compliment each other.  Delicious!

Very yummy.  I used the zest of two whole lemons, since we like it very lemony.  It took an extra 15-20 minutes before it was done.  Just like a giant delicious muffin.  Oh, and no problems with berries sinking.

This was excellent.  I used a little more blueberries and lemon zest and a little lemon juice.  It was gone quick at my house.

This was just the light airy cake I was looking for.  The only trouble I had was the cooking time but it worked out in the end.  I didn't have a zester so I left the lemon out.  I also did as one reviewer suggested and put some of the mix (w/o blueberries) in the pan first then added the blueberries in the remaining mix and poured that in.

I made this recipe today for my husband to take to work tomorrow. Although it was very easy to make, the loaf turned out rather flat; it was only about 2 inches thick! I will not make this recipe again.

Flavor was a little bland and my blueberries sank even after coating them, which made for a terrible presentation, maybe frozen work better than fresh???

I used a brownie pan and wheat flour. They came out great like nice little blueberry bars. I used frozen berries didn't have any problems with them berries sinking.

Even though I dredged my blueberries with flour, they all sank to the bottom and the loaf stuck to the pan in places.  I thought the bread was very good, and even without a glaze it was very lemony.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe! However, my blueberries didn't disperse evenly, they were all at the bottom of the bread. The bread was very moist though. Next time I will add the lemon and the glaze to the top for a little more flavor.

I chose this recipe because it is less fattening, etc.  Boy, was I surprised how good the taste is!  I only changed 2 things.  I added 1 Tbsp. instead of 2 tsp. lemon zest, and I added an icing to the top.  It was 2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice mixed into 1/4 c. sugar.  Yum!

This recipe is just OK.  Not very lemony even though I added more lemon than the recipe calls for. Also, the blueberries sank to the bottom of the pan and my badder was not thin.  This is one I won't make again.
