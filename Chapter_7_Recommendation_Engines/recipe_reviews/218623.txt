This dessert is in-CRE-DI-BLE! We loved every bit of it. We were on vacation in a small town and found this recipe and had to try it. The grocery did not carry toffee baking bits, so we substituted a 12 oz bag of miniture Heath bars. We crushed them in the chopper (the whole bag)and used it instead. FABulous recipe!

Mm mmmm good! Admittedly I didn't have any toffee bits (which I think would be amazing!), so I put some coconut in with the pecans and served it warm. So good! Soft and a little gooey on the bottom and slightly crunchy on the top.  I will definitely be picking up some toffee bits for next time.
   Update! I made these with toffee pieces and wow, were the good. I took them to a little homemade ice cream gathering so they were paired with vanilla ice cream and they disappeared. Iâ€™m glad I as smart enough to hold a few back just for us!

Made these for a Seniors' Tea. Super easy & delicious! Kept some for ourselves! Used French Vanilla cake mix since it was all I had. It worked just fine.

Very Yummy.  I'm not sure about the cooking times.  I cooked the crust for 11 minutes, but in the end I felt it should have been cooked longer.  I will probably add more pecans next time and maybe more toffee.

5 stars because this was really yummy and SUPER easy to make.  I made this for a church function on short notice with whatever I had on hand and it turned out well.  I used french vanilla cake mix in place of yellow and omitted the vanilla in the filling because it was now in the crust.  I also had 2/3 bag of toffee chips and 1/3 bag of chocolate coated toffee chips on hand, so I used a combination.  I baked the crust for 10-11 minutes and the filling for 27 minutes.  It is a tad sweet (just cut into smaller bars), but oh so ooey gooey at the same time! Will definitely make again.
