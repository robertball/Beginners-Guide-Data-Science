As the submitter of this recipe, I have some comments.  I tried to make it tonight following the recipe but I realize that I probably put double the spices on the chicken.  I just sprinkle a healthy dose of curry, and then follow with about twice as much garam masala.  If the sauce gets too low and we're having rice, I add another 1/2 cup wine and the rest of the can of broth (a little more than half).  You can also buy one of the little bottles of wine and use that in the recipe instead of measuring.  They are a little over 1/2 cp.  Finally, at the end of cooking, I remove the chicken and bring the sauce to a hard boil for about 5 minutes until it is reduced.  I don't know why that instruction didn't make it into the published version.  Others have commented that they like it spicier and by all means bring out your spicy curry and red pepper if thats what you want.  But I posted this recipe as something that children will eat while still keeping their more adventurous parents happy.  I hope you all continue to enjoy this recipe.  Its great features are that is quick, cheap, and has few ingredients.  Enjoy!

This is a great, cheap recipe that is easy to make.  I only gave it four stars because I did have to alter it a bit.  First, I used Madras curry powder.  As I have 5 different jars of curry powder in my pantry, I felt I was taking a risk on this but chose well I think.  Second, I used regular chicken broth instead of the low sodium and it still did not have enough salt.  Simply add salt for more flavor.  I spiced it up with a half teaspoon of extra spicy indian chili powder.  This gave it a much needed kick.  I also added a bit of flour mixed with water to thicken the gravy up some.  Pour it over short grain brown rice and its awesome.  Enough for four meals given a side.  I'm definitely adding this one to my standard recipe list.

This is one of the best (and easiest to make!) curries I have ever had.  Like others, I added more spices, as well as cayenne pepper to taste, as we like it hot! For the last 10 minutes of simmering I took the cover off the pan and allowed the broth/wine/vinegar mixture to reduce to a creamy glaze, which I served over the chicken. We paired this with a cool salad to offset the heat for a delicious low-carb dinner!

This is one of those great recipes; few ingredients, simple and quick with a surprisingly tasty result.  I probably used a lot more curry than called for, but we like things a little spicier.  I added some green beans the last few minutes and I could see a number of vegetables options that would work with this.  Over jasmine rice, it was enjoyed by all.  Thanks for this great simple recipe!

Really good recipe, I substituted balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar (since I didn't have any) and it was still really great, easy and pretty quick!

I added chili powder b/c we like our food on the spicier side.  My husband offered a 10/10 rating, which is really good b/c he eats a lot of different recipes that I make.  We really liked this dish and it's nice b/c it has so few ingredients.

Made this for dinner last night, and even my husband loved it.  Followed the recipe pretty closely.  Full flavor without a lot of sodium.

I feel a little bad about rating this chicken so poorly but I am being sincere here. It was SOOO bad that I could not eat it. I'm not a picky eater, I love garam masala and curry and everything else in the dish. It just didn't work for me at all. I ended up having to make something else.

Super easy recipe. Cooking times are perfect. As recommended, I increased seasonings on chicken and all liquids by 50%. I would recommend salt and pepper and maybe I will try a little chilli powder next time to add a bit more flavor. The flavor is not over powering as written so the kids did not create any resistance.  Yummy recipe-thank you Klevear!!

Great simple recipe I will add to my list of foreign dishes. If you like these spices this is pretty hard to mess up. Frankly I used freshie instead of wine and added waaaaay more spices and just loved it. So simple and tastey. I made lots more sauce as you can see in my photo #2 as we have a big family that like rice and sauce. Thanks for this. Excellent!

I used only 4 thighs and the full recipe for the sauce.  The trick is to turn the heat up at the end of the cooking time and reduce the liquid until it is the consistency of bbq sauce.  Sauce is full of flavour this way.  I also added just a few grains of salt to help bring out the flavor but would not bother next time as reducing the liquid is enough.

I gave this dish 5 stars because it was simple, delicious and quite healthy.  So many curry recipes list 20 ingredients and steps but this was super easy and so tasty.  Before using a recipe I find here I always read the reviews to see about any adjustments.  I sauteed a few of cloves of garlic with the onion about 1/2 way through because I add garlic to everything.  I also seasoned the chicken with salt and cayenne pepper.  To thicken the sauce I combined some of the sauce in a bowl with a couple of teaspoons of flour then added it back to the pan.  Lastly I added about 2 cups of frozen peas to the pan.  I served it over quinoa to make a complete, high protein meal.  I will make this again and again.

LOVED this!  SO easy and it made the house smell great too.  Had a little trouble finding the garam masala in my local supermarket but did a little research and made my own spice blend (cumin, cinnamon, crumbled bay leaf, cayenne and some others) and it was great.

The level of spice was good, as the recipe was written, but as my husband said, "the sauce is a little thin".  I ended up adding some cream to the sauce after cooking (and tasting) and then it was delicious.  I think milk or coconut milk would work well.  Of course, any addition of a creamy type liquid will add fat and calories.  This recipe does seem very low fat as written, so it really is a trade off for flavor. If you are looking to save fat/calories this recipe would be an excellent choice.

My H is not a big fan of curry but he liked this so well he wanted leftovers for lunch the next day...when I went to get them we both realized he had helped himself to seconds the previous night and there wasn't any left.  I followed the recipe and the comments in KLEVEAR 's follow up review...increasing the seasoning and reducing the juices.  Served it over long grain white rice.  Also had never heard of Garam Masala but found a recipe for it here on allrecipes and it turned out beautifully

Since this recipe was so well reviewed, I made it verbatim to start. It was good but a little bland, so I doctored it some in the last few minutes of cooking. I found it benefited from 1) adding a hefty dose of salt 2) adding 2-3 tbsp white sugar and 3) using 1 tbsp of cornstarch mixed with some hot broth in the last few minutes to thicken it. With these changes, it was fabulous. Also, I followed the suggestion of the chef and used double the seasoning (2 tbsp garam masala and 1 tsp curry powder). All in all, very few changes were made to make our family happy. A darn fine, cheap and easy recipe.

This was a quick and easy recipe.  My husband and son loved it.  I did more than double the amount of garam masala and curry powder the recipe calls for.  Will definitely make this again.

The recipe is very good but I must say that it is NOT Mid-eastern.  Curry and garam masala are tipically Indian spices. And India is in Asia, not in the Middle East...

Excellent recipe. I did season the thighs with salt and pepper along with the curry and garam masala. I used hot curry powder. After the 20 mins, I removed the thighs and covered with foil to keep warm. Then put the heat on high and added 1/3 cup heavy cream and reduced to a thick sauce. Then melted in a tablespoon of butter. Delicious! This recipe probably would also work well with pounded chicken breasts. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This is a fast, easy  and delicious meal. I've made a few different curry chicken dishes that required more ingredients and took longer to prepare. I'll still make them again, but I think this one is going to become my favorite. It's a recipe that I can remember without having a long list of ingredients and steps to follow. I just happened to have red wine on hand and was very surprised wth the results.

I used  a large amount (more than the recipe stated) of garam masala and extra spicy curry powder, but it still lacked flavor and was rather boring.

I made this recipe and it was great as made according to the original directions, but it really need some tweaking. When I made this the second time around, I modified the recipe first, by doubling the sauce (cause we love sauce in my family!) and thickened it up by adding 2 1/2-3 Tbs flour. I also added about a tablespoon of cumin, a dash of coriander, and parsley flakes to taste.

The flavor was great. If you like it hotter I would use hot curry. I used chicken breast meat cut up instead of thighs. The sauce was very liquidity. I would thicken next time if that is the type of sauce you like. I would add vegetables to this dish for a one pan meal. I would add naan next time to eat up the sauce. I served over brown basmati rice.

What a great recipe to make! Easy, a mild subtle flavor that was just delicious! I will probably add a
little more curry powder and garam marsala and salt the next time but it was delicious as it was. It was a nice change from really spicy Indian food.

Wonderful recipe! I usually make all my chicken recipes with chicken breasts, but decided to try this as posted. YUM! I followed the recipe exactly except I really didn't measure the spices, just sort of loaded them on :) Served with a wild rice/brown rice packaged mix and broccoli on the side. Oh, and it's fast! And inexpensive! What's not to love?

I will definitely make this again. It was easy and quick to make. I doubled the liquid for the sauce, as I was making Jasmine rice to accompany it. The only other think I did was to add 1 tsp of turmeric - gave it a nice color! Husband liked it too. Tomorrow my adult kids will come - bet it will be even better!

Really good, easy weeknight dish. I used bone in but skinless thighs. As other reviewers posted, it could benefit from some salt when served.  I served it with some Israeli couscous, naan and green beans. Will definitely make this again.

I made this with a few changes right off the bat--I added garlic in with the carmelizing onions, and used an equal amount of marsala and curry powder. I also sauteed some green beans to add some veggie element, but next time I would add them about five minutes before simmering time is over, rather than at the beginning when they get soggy. I think next time I'm going to cut the amount of marsala and add some spicier curry powder--for me, marsala can be a bit too sweet and cloying if not cut with something sharper. It's a great base for a recipe, though, and has a lot of room for creativity in the future.

Hubby called this one "a keeper".  Not the prettiest dish but definitely yummy.  As always, I adjusted the spices to taste.  Served with Algerian Carrots.

I agree with other reviewers about spice level...however, I wouldn't rate the recipe poorly on that as I know it's catering to families and spice can be a big issue. I rate on the concept of the dish & then my additions...I loved it. Yes, I added more curry, garam masala, chili pepper flakes and some garlic with the onions. I loved the flavour and the smell in my house. I loved it over rice. I did add some milk to thicken..didn't work to well BUT it was still great. Thanks for a great recipe to work from! DELICIOUS.

Good tasting way to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Any wine will do(I used dry vermouth) and as to quantities of curries, I used three kinds for a total of 2 Tbls. for 6 large thighs. You might consider chopping up some cilantro (which is the plant that produces coriander seeds, a primary ingredient in all curries) to sprinkle over the top just before serving. It adds nice touch. Serve over your favorite starch. I like couscous.

I guess I must not be a fan of Mid-Eastern food? This was VERY spicy and the smell is quite overpowering, 2 days later and my house still has a lingering stench from this. I used chicken breasts, my family prefers white meat. They did come out quite juicy. But, they were extremely spicy!!

Made as directed...Yummy...except I think my curry is a bit on the "old" side, as I added extra but really didn't taste it...Hubby said I could make this again! Served with a side of basmati brown rice and zucchini.

Loved it!  I gave it a 5 taking into consideration how easy it is to make with just a few ingredients.  My two guys loved it.  I may have added more spices than recommended because I don't measure, but it didn't overwhelm the dish.  This will go into my rotation!

I would give this 10 stars but my family gave it mixed reviews. I used Balsamic vinegar because I didn't have red wine vinegar.  I do not think it needs any salt. Definitely take the lid off the pan during the last few minutes to let the sauce thicken.  I served this with plain rice and scooped some sauce on the rice.  Yum.

This was a really nice change for chicken. I read other reviews and agree that the only things needed would be a thicker sauce and salt! Very tasty and easy as well as easy to adjust if you wanted low fat low calorie dish. 
I prefer to have some fat in my dish as it really makes all the difference in flavors.  I added salt and butter as well butgot a thicker sauce by adding corn startch to chicken broth before adding it into the pan with wine and red wine vinigar..I tbink it helped but could have added a little more. I was heavy on the rub to both sides of the chicken meat then lightly floured the thighs on both sides before dropping them in the oil! Was great will make again.TY!

This recipe was awesome!  The only thing I did differently was use bone in, skin on chicken thighs (because that's what I had on hand) and I salt and peppered the thighs along with the garam masala/curry powder.  I served these with roasted cauliflower and carrots with thyme.  My husband and I rarely eat the same thing twice because we like to experiment a lot but we both agreed that this is going to be a regular in our house.  So easy and so tasty!

To my shock when I started the recipe, I realized I was out of curry powder, and I thought "Oh no!" but I used a square of S&B Golden Curry sauce mix to the sauce and it was perfect. The chicken was super tender, very yummy! I also used double the red wine and chicken broth and probably 3x the spices, so I had extra sauce. I added green beans because I like veggies and served it with jasmine rice.

Pretty good!  I added garlic to the onions + used equal curry & garam masala then added cayenne + garlic salt as some reviewers said it needed a little something.  It was good but still could've used a little something (can't quite name it).  I only cooked it for 10 minutes once I added the wine & broth though, would have been overcooked if it went for 20.  I still can't put my finger on what it could use to bring just the right flavor out but overall it was quite good, chicken was tender and I wouldn't pass it up.  Thanks for sharing!

Not a favorite of ours.  With all those flavors, it still was kind of bland somehow....

Simple but very tasty!  I added some sliced roasted red peppers; otherwise prepared as directed, allowing more generous curry and garam masala as the author suggested in her own comments. Thanks for a great recipe; got rave reviews from my fiancee!

This was excellent.  I took the advice of the author of this recipe and added more garam masala and curry powder.  I thought it would be too spicy; but NO.  Just right!  Thanks for the recipe.  Simple and delicious.

One of the easiest recipes to make as well as very affordable.  I have two 15 year old boys and a teen girl and I can make a big large meal that they all LOVE!  I switch the curry for tandori spice as the kids dont always like the spice curry.  Tastes amazing both ways.  The chicken is so soft and juicy.  Thank you for this wonderful dish!

I made this recipe with everything minus the wine as my husband doesnt care for wine braised meats, recipe was just ok, had to really amp up the spices as the recipe did not call for enough. Also this recipe badly needs salt! Juices were just ok but were very thin so had hubby make into a gravy, will make again but with changes such as adding more salt, maybe even brining the chicken pieces.

This was excellent.  I added garlic to the onions and a bit more curry and garam masala.  It turned out to be flavorful and tender.  A keeper!

This was great!  I did it exactly as posted.  When I was educated. the distinctions were: Near East, Middle East, and Far East. I have heard that when the British moved a military unit with Middle East in its name from India to Jordan (then the Near East), the unit's name was kept, and gradually the term Near East, faded.  This left Middle East being used for a very large area.

This turned out great.  I read the review by the person who submitted the recipe and just sprinkled on the curry and the garam masala.  Our 3 year old loved it also.  Next time would use a bit of a spicy curry blend to add a bit of kick.  Made saffron rice and some naan bread to accompany it.

My family loved this!  This replaces the chicken curry recipe I've made for years.  I didn’t have chicken thighs – I used diced chicken breasts instead.  Replaced red wine with apple juice, I added a little less than twice the spices (as suggested in the reviews), and near the end of the simmering added 1-2 Tbl flour to thicken the sauce, and 1-2 Tbl. cream (although it tasted great without).  Served it over jasmine rice with green beans on the side – delicious!

This was an excellant quick and easy dinner.  So often you spend so much on the ingredients that it works out to be a fortune.  I too like so many others added way more spices than the recipe called for.  It was so good over rice and I really enjoyed it.  Next time will make a thicker sauce.  Great Recipe.....

Really, really good. I don't use curry powder, I much prefer the flavor of curry paste.  I used about a teaspoon and a half of Patak's Madras paste. Since you can't get a good sear on chicken if it's coated with curry paste, I just added salt and pepper to the chicken and browned it, and then I removed the chicken from the pan and I added the curry paste to the sauteed onions. I added a clove of smashed garlic before braising (Honestly, what isn't better with a garlic clove!) Before serving I added fresh cracked black pepper and served with crusty bread. I loved this recipe, so did my husband, and it makes a truly beautiful sauce. This is a company dish for sure.

Made this with bone-in chicken thighs - just changed the simmer time from 20m to 40m, and it was perfect. Also, I heeded the previous reviews that the spices needed to be increased, so I doubled the spices (and the red wine for more sauce), and added granulated garlic, salt, pepper, and a little cayenne for a kick. I actually made it a little too spicy for me, but my husband loved it! Great recipe - very easy to make and love the flavor. Will certainly make again.

I couldn't believe there was no salt in the recipe, so of course I salted. It was hot, but not spicy; even with the salt it lacked flavor. 

If you followed the directions for cooking, it would have been over-done and dry. I did reduce the sauce per one of the reviewer's suggestion. But still, not a keeper. Disappointed in this one.

Good base recipe. Doubled the liquids and spices and added cayenne and 2 heads garlic. Used full sodium broth then added some salt as it is bland without. Used 2.5lbs chicken thighs and left them whole after trimming excess fat (not a fan of white meat).

Delightful! I used skin-on, bone-in thighs and a bit of salt at table was needed. Excellent flavor and a good way to introduce eastern taste to western palates. I'll definitely be making this again.

MY husband declared that this chicken  is delicious, and I agree.  I prepared this recipe because it does not require breading or fats, and the required spices lend sensational flavor on both the thighs and the broth.   I plan to make this again.

I made this according to the recipe, except doubling the ingredients, due to curry being a family favorite dish! Also, I season the meat with salt 30 minutes before cooking, and have realized over the years that if you make a curry dish a day ahead, it gives the aromatic seasonings time to really move through the dish! Super yummy!

I have made this recipe several times. I don’t always have red wine available so I used a can of tomato sauce (small one) and always up the spices. It works and is great for a different and easy chicken recipe! Thanks!

This was good. I did double the amount of spice, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. A spicy kick with some hot pepper would have been a good addition, which I will probably try next time. My family was pleased with the dish, and I will probably make it again. It was very easy.

I really liked this recipe.  I feel it would have tasted better with more authentic curry, but I only had the McCormick brand.  I think I’ll cut up the thighs next time and pay more attention so I don’t overly Brown the onions ??

This was soooo good! We made it according to recipe, with the exception of doubling the Garam Masala, Curry, and adding a little salt. Plate licking good. I served it with steamed broccoli and jasmine rice (cooked in Better than Chicken - broth). My daughter doesn't love Indian-type foods but she helped cooked this and also found it quite delicious. This is definitely going to be added to my favorites!

This was great!  Like others I used about 2 Tbsp. each of the curry powder and garam masala and added about 1/2 tsp. of hot chili powder.  Which didn't make it hot  at all.  A super flavorful dish.  I used bone-in thighs.  I removed the thighs and to thicken and still remain low-carb I used about a teaspoon of Xanthan Gum during the reduction part.  I served it with potato salad made from cauliflower.  The creaminess of the salad paired fabulously with the intensely flavorful chicken.  This is a keeper for sure!

Followed the recipe excel didn’t have Garam Masala.  Substituted cumin and allspice at 4-1.  Also doubled spices per author suggestion.  It was simple and good, not great.  Will make again.

My wife and I really enjoyed this one. Made it as described, but did use about twice the curry and masala.  Also as per recommendation, I cooked it the last 10 mins without the lid to thicken the sauce. Will definitely make it again! Thanks.

pretty outstanding. didn’t measure any of the dry ingredients. 6 skinless chicken thighs sprinkled (then rubbed in): salt n pepper, curry powder, garamasala, chili powder. other directions followed...including boiling down the liquid until it’s the consistency of thin syrup.

Yum!
I used drumsticks, because that is what I had on hand.  I was liberal with the spices, and added a little red pepper;  I thickened the sauce with some plain yogurt.  I served it with jasmine rice.  It was a hit with my 12 year old, and even my 10 year old ate some!

Made this in the crock pot. You don't need as much liquid, but we liked the extra over the rice. I needed a little bit of sweet to mine, so I added raisins to my bowl but the rest of the family ate it as it was. I would add a little salt as well.

I have made this many times.   My husband I love it!.  We like more sauce so I tweak that and also thicken it up with a little  corn starch,  This is a go to recipe for me when I just need something fast that I know we like.

My whole family enjoyed this chicken dish.  

Be sure to read the author’s follow-up comments in the review section.  After the chicken was cooked, I removed the thighs from the pan and turned up the heat to get the sauce to thicken.  It wasn’t cooking down fast enough for me, so I mixed together 1 Tbsp cornstarch with 2 Tbsp cold water.  Added that to the sauce and cooked for a minute.  That’s did the trick.

I made this dish today and it was so very tasty! I didn't have onions on hand so I used onion powder with the other spices.  Didn't have red wine vinegar either but balsamic vinegar worked well. I used some suggestions from other people and added some cayenne pepper and garlic powder and salt. The flavors are not what I'm used to and were a welcome change to the boring same old stuff. Thank you KLEVEAR for sharing your recipe with us!

Not much flavor, very bland.  I added salt to bring out flavor which helped.  Most Indian food I have been asked has a much stronger flavor profile.   Maybe children would like it more?

As recommended by all, I doubled the spices and added salt and pepper.  I also boiled down the sauce for about 2-3 minutes.  It was fantastic!   I served it with mixed grains (quinoa, red rice & brown rice) and it was excellent.  A keeper, for sure.

Overall, the whole family liked it.  I thought the flavors could have been a bit stronger, even after increasing the masala and using a spicy curry powder.  I was also a bit disappointed the sauce didn't thicken at all.  I will make again with some modifications to the spice mixture and reducing the sauce more.

This is surprisingly mild given all the spices in it. Another reviewer mentioned how thin the sauce was, and I agreed, so I added a half can of coconut milk halfway through the simmer.  I served it over Basmati rice with peas, which went perfectly. My 7 and 9 year old boys devoured it.

This has made it on to our biweekly meal rotation! I doubled the spices as recommended by some. This is a direct quote from my fourteen year old son: "Mom, this is RESTAURANT FOOD!"

This recipe is definitely lacking something!!!  I read the other reviews and added garlic, extra spices, raw sugar.  Still lacking.  I then added a different brand of curry powder, a little more chicken base and some cayenne pepper.  It is finally palatable!  Guess I must be used to more authentic middle eastern cooking having resided in the region for many years!  A little disappointing to say the least!

Definitely had an Indian flavor.  I was looking for flavor without a flour gravy -- and this worked for me.  I had to find a recipe for garam Marsala, which was pretty easy to find online.  The finished dish could have been a little spicier for my taste -- and I'm generally a "medium" spicy individual, but possibly there's more than one heat level for the main spice.  I'm not sure I'd offer this to kids, unless they are open to new tastes..

this recipe is amazing. A great curry for sure.
I doubled the spice amount and added a few red pepper flakes. at the very end sprinkled some flour in to thicken the liquid to a sauce. everyone loved it.

I cooked this recipe as it was written.  Next time I would add more curry or curry paste.  I added some Wondra to thicken up the sauce.  It was good.

This dish was really good. I did not have any garam masala so I went on line goggled substitute for the spice and everything it listed I had. I also added some garlic powder. I had whole chicken thighs, so I had to debone and skin them. Then I cut into bite size pieces. Since I did that it did not take as long to cook. A keeper.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I rated it only 4 as we made some changes (these changes made it a 5 for us) - I added Crimini Mushrooms along with the onions. I also used more spice than what was called for.  After the chicken was cooked through I removed the chicken/mushrooms/onion from the liquid and put them in a dish in the oven on really low to keep them warm.  I then turned up the heat on the liquid in the pan to cook it down to a nice thick sauce to pour over the chicken mixture.  Next time I might try adding a little corn starch to thicken the sauce quicker.  To make the meal gluten-free I added low sodium/gluten-free/free-range chicken broth.  Asparagus goes well with this meal as well as a nice fresh salad.

I thought it was amazingly good for being low fat.  I would salt my chicken next time before adding rub.

Ok, but nothing fabulous...I found it rather bland. If I try it again, I'll add more spices for sure!
