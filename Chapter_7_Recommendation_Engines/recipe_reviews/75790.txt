I made this recipe with a few changes. I added Rotel tomatoes instead of regular canned tomatoes.  I also added oregano, garlic, and bay leaves. It was delicious. Thanks for sharing this good recipe.

This is a delightful recipe that I will certainly make again. At first I didn’t understand the use of the bacon but, as you enjoy the meal, your palette surely will! I recommend making it “as is” the fist time. It’s got just the right amount of spice. Thank you, Principal Cole!

Did this recipe like written except my sis can't stand heat so i omitted the cayene and added tsp minced garlic. Also, Since I had shrimp shells, I cooked them to make a shrimp broth, I substituted 1/4 cup chicken stock for shrimp. For those of you that felt it was bland, I would guess you used can chicken stock. I had made my chicken stock the day before and it (as well as the dish) had great flavor. Even though I stopped after I put in the bacon and second batch of stock, took the pot to my sister's (10min away), then added the shrimp and heated through till they were cooked, it still came out great. Thanks for a keeper oh, and the bacon does make it but so does homeade chicken/shrimp stock :-)

I make a lot of recipes from AR. Every few months or so I come across a recipe that really wows me and goes into my list of favorites. This is one of those recipes! The sauce is so amazing. Perfect with rice and some french bread to sop up the rest. I prefer to always cook my rice in the rice cooker. For the shrimp/sauce mixture only use 1.5 cups of broth if not adding rice. You can then thicken the sauce if needed with corn startch.  Also, I'm so glad I had my hubs run to the store for bacon. I don't really like nutmeg but 1/4tsp. taste just fine in this. Delicious!

This recipe was excellent. Great Flavor. I did however make a few adjustments only because I didn't have the exact ingridients on hand. I used Rice-a-Roni Long Grain Wild Rice with 1/2 cup of brown Rice(I din't have enough regular brwn rice) I also used a can of Rotel instead of reg. Diced tomatoes. I also added fresh mushrooms and garlic with the onions! Great Flavor, everyone loved it and it wasn't too spicy for the kids! Thanks for a keeper!

Very good and very easy to make.  I cut down on the nutmeg just a tad and doubled the cayenne (we like it spicy) and it was perfect.  Also, my rice had absorbed all of the liquid and had begun to stick after about 15-17 minutes.

This was so tasty!  My only problem with the recipe is that the rice overcooked.  Most white rice is done at 20 minutes.  Here are some changes I had to make due to what I had.  No broth, just water, added 1/4 can tomato sauce 2 whole chopped tomatoes, hot sauce, dash of garlic powder, and Old Bay seasoning!.. It was spicy but delicious!.. I will try to figure out the rice problem because I want to make it again.

Now, it can be a bit spicy, so I usually start with half of the cayenne called for and go from there.  I also use an extra half pound of shrimp.

Was not impressed with this recipe. After reading other's reviews, I had the impression that this dish was not very spicy, but it was was too spicy for us. Also, even though the recipe didn't say to rinse the rice, I always do, and it still came out gummy and sticky.  We ended up picking the shrimp out of the rice and eating them. I will not be making this one again.

Made almost exactly to the recipe my husband and I loved this recipe... the only thing I did different is that I used a pre-cooked blend of brown rice and quinoa. Yummy, a keeper for us for sure.

Love this recipe! I make it all the time. I don't change a thing, except use less shrimp to save a few cents and it's still great!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was very good. I did add oregano, garlic and a bay leaf as suggested by one of the reviews but also used the ingredients listed in the recipe. I also used Rotel tomatoes. Mine did not look like the picture above , my rice reminded me of brown rice. Next time I may cook my rice separate and serve on the side with the shrimp mixture.  I also used smoked thick sliced bacon which adds such a good flavor. I will make this again for sure.

OMG!! one of the best recipes ever!!!  

This is a very simple but very flavorfull recipe!  I usually dont like to change the origional recipe, but I saw one of the reviews and they used Rotel instead of regular diced tomatoes, well I love Rotel so I used them and one other change was that I didnt have any regular bacon, but I did have some Hungarian bacon!  Let me tell You! If You can find some, get it!  It adds a sweetness to the recipe that is awesome!  My wife found it a bit HOT because of the Cayenne, but I thought it was perfect!  Great Recipe!!

Okay, so I changed up a lot of things and it came out GREAT.  My wife doesn't like REAL spicey so I left out the cayenne pepper.  However, I added about a 1/4 cup of yellow pepper and a 1/4 cup of orange pepper which I ran through a food processor.  My 'heat' spice was Tony Chacheres (which may be a bit local) and I used it sparingly.  In the end, with 10 minutes to go, I added a 1/4 cup of frozen broccoli flowerettes which I thawed and trimmed the stems off and threw in both for taste and color.  I will be fixing this dish again.

I agree with fellow reviewers this dish was very salty
I tried the recipe because I thought shrimp and bacon how could you go wrong? The combo is not a good one.

I felt this was too salty, due to the bacon. If I ever use it again, I'll use bacon bits instead.

My husband and I were very disappointed with this recipe. I made it for Super Bowl supper but it wasn't at all what I had expected. There is some spice, maybe the nutmeg(?) that gave it a bitter flavor. I should have stayed with what I usually fix.We really prefer the New Orleans or Charleston style shrimp dishes. This seemed very ordinary.

this is one of my most favorite recipes. It's so easy. I use bell peppers in almost everything. Definitely add them if they need to get used up. I always use mild Rotel when making this dish, and then just a *pinch* of cayenne pepper, trust me. It will be spicy enough. Last time I made this I added cilantro and chopped fresh mushrooms. So yummy & easy.

I used chicken instead of shrimp, since my family hates seafood (they're a little weird) and I added more lemon juice to taste.  The bacon flavor really makes this dish different and delicious.   I'll be making this one again.  I thought it was a nice change from other chicken and rice dishes

This recipe was excellent as is, however it could have other things added to it.  I found it to be quick and easy and was also easy to cut in half  as there are only two in my family.

I just made this recipe for dinner with friends and it turned out wonderfully!  Rave reviews.  Will make this again and again!  The only comment is that, because of previous reviews, I cut the cayenne pepper in half.  I would have been that much better if I had left it.  With the full amount, it would have been just as hot as the medium salsa we get.  Fantastic dish!

I omitted the heat and subbed lime juice for lemon and A1 for the Worcestershire sauce. It still tasted awesome and this is a new favorite for my family!

I did not use the cayenne pepper because I have small children to feed. This was very good and the whole family ate it. I used prawns that still had the shell on and then took the shell off right before eating.

This recipe is fun with a kick of spicy. Not only was it easy to make but it took very little time to prep and cook. Just awesome.

I made this extra spicey by using hot diced tomatoes. I liked this, but thought I would love it.

It was ok. But to be honest, I don't like the shrimp and bacon combo as the bacon drowns the flavour of the shrimp. Wasn't for me but was ok.

I served this last night, and it was pretty good, if a little bland. Perhaps the addition of chopped red pepper or more cayenne would liven it up.

Hubby loved it. I would like a little more cayenne pepper. Easy to make!

I made it as stated but left out the nutmeg because I am allergic to it.  I added some chopped green pepper.  My family enjoyed it.  I would make it again.

Really liked this.  A bit salty for my taste but that is easy to remedy. It was a bit on the liquidy side but don't care. I made it in my cast iron pan and it stuck a little, but that's fine because it means little tasty brown bits. I didn't have canned diced tomatoes so I used some frozen Romas from my garden this past summer.  Really enjoyed it. I had to use up some frozen shrimp I had to went recipe hunting. Next time- I'll cut back on the bacon a bit to taste the shrimp better and cut the smokey taste some. And will experiment with additions. Thank you for the recipe!

I found as another mentioned, that the cook method makes the rice too mushy by the end so I will reduce the cooking  time or try a different type rice.  I used  Ro-Tel diced tomatoes with green chilies and left out the Cayenne pepper.  Put in one lg. Bay leaf and two minced garlic cloves.  Husband ate a lot!

Very good recipe reminds me of a gumbo just not as spicy. Make it about once a month.

My whole family really enjoyed this dish. I only made two changes: 1) I didn't have any Cayenne pepper, so I sprinkled in some crushed red pepper flakes and 2) I always use minute rice in my cooking, so I made it seperate in the microwave, then added it to the pot when the recipe calls for the other rice. It turned out great! No sticky rice. My family wants me to make this again, so it is a keeper. Thanks for sharing. :0)
