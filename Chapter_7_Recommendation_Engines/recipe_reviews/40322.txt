These are super cute.  I found that if you make a little hole in the bottom of the caps, you can fill them with chocolate for an extra little surprise.
For super realistic mushrooms, paint the bottom of the cap with chocolate, add the stem, then use a toothpick to make the 'gills' going out from around the base.
Everyone thought these were real mushrooms.

I didn't find these took much time at all! There aren't a lot of ingredients to assemble and when you beat on high it only takes a few minutes to get a good meringue, and the piping was really easy too...I don't have a pastry bag so i just cut a corner out a zip-lock and used that, and it worked fine. The only real comment I have is that this recipe makes a lot of merigue. I guess you could make the mushrooms a lot bigger than life sized, but i'd say you could probably halve it and still get 36.

definitely a fun recipe - not the easiest but a fun challenge. This is not a recipe for a humid day-the meringue is sticky and never dries out. ***Don't use a silicone mat, use parchment. They stick bad enough that you will damage them prying them off.

These mushrooms are absolutely magical. They look so real, my husband was convinced I'd gone to the farmer's market without him! The only changes I made to the recipe were in the assembly. After removing the caps from the oven, I used a pastry brush to lightly smear the cocoa powder, going for a 'wild mushroom' look. After they had cooled, I sliced the pointed tips off of the stem pieces to make them flat. One at a time, I painted melted dark chocolate on the bottoms of the caps with a small craft brush, then pressed the cut end of the stem piece into the center. As each one was finished, I placed them cap side down in empty egg cartons so they wouldn't topple over. I left them to dry for a few hours, then sealed them in an airtight container. These were perfect on our Buche de Noel, but I can't wait until next Christmas to make these again. I think they'll be great for Easter, too. Thank you so much, Holly!

Being a young adult, I hadn't heard of these small confections before. So I just had to include them into my holiday cookie gift assortments. Although many people had seen them before, my age group were just floored! A definate treat to leave an impression. The chocolate cofentioners---  I wasn't sure what EXACTLLY is was, so I used Cocoa powder, tasted great ( almost like really marshmallowy hot chocolate!)

I also dyed some coconut green, mixed into some corn syrup and dipped the stem bottoms in there for some added realness. For some fantasy-- we made some colored corn syrup and painted little spots to resemble Wonderland mushrooms.

Oh, and many thanks to foodaholic for the great professional-looking photos!

Thanks to everyone's comments! I like the idea of using colored corn syrup to paint polka dots and make 'fantasy' mushrooms; also to make the 'gills'. 

So sorry about the confusion of chocolate to use. The brand I used to use was Wilton Candy Melts. Now I like to use Giardhelli (sp?) dark semisweet chips, melted.

Note - I tried tonight, to make these with the pasteurized egg whites you buy in cartons? They did not whip to the same stiffness as natural whites, though the volume seemed about the same. Maybe a little less. They are in the oven now...I will report back on any major differences. But I am thinking one should stay with the natural, separate-them-yourself egg whites.
*I'm back! the only difference I found between the whites from carton and natural whites - was that the stems from the carton whites did not quite keep their shape as well during baking. I tried to make them tall and they didn't quite stay tall. But still fine. I've tried some new final touches too - before the chocolate hardens, on some I sprinkle the tiny colored balls to look like 'spores'...also on some I sprinkle finely chopped candy canes...and on the tops of large mushrooms, I put a couple dabs of melted chocolate, then 'paste' on 3 tiny nonpariels ("snowcaps" candies".

These were the definite show-stealer at my New Year's Party. I was SO impressed with both how easy they were, and how realistic they looked! If you're like me (and the baker at my local supermarket) thinking, "What the heck is chocolate confectioner's coating?", then don't panic. I melted 6 or 7 Hershey kisses and they did the trick perfectly. I've heard meringue can be tricky, so I made sure to slowly sprinkle the sugar one tbsp at a time, and beat it lots and lots and lots, and it worked. Thanks to hungry girl for the zip-lock bag tip. I'll be making these for years and years to come. Thanks Holly!!

These candy mushrooms are awesome.  I like to serve mine in a basket.  I also dust mine with cinnamon instead of cocoa...gives it a nice taste.  These do take a lot of time but are well worth it

These were wonderful!  Not only are they gorgeous, but they're tasty, too.  I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup; I don't like my meringue to be very sweet.  I'm odd, though.  The rest of my family prefers a sweeter meringue.

SO incredibly cute!  Add the sugar slowly, & get those egg white peaks well fluffed! The recipe makes a lot but don't halve it first time if you need practice with piping. Don't try to reshape, it won't work. Odd shapes are cute! Ok to put them close together on the pan as they don't expand in the oven. Use parchment paper. They will come off a pan otherwise, but not as easily.  Sift the powdered chocolate on caps AND stems halfway through, then use a brush to smear the powder around when you take them out. Looks so real!! Beware they won't harden up until they come out of the oven. Don't take them off the pan until they have completely cooled as they will stick. When putting together, start with the "ugliest" ones for practice. Hold cap gently and twist your finger or a butter knife to make a hole in it for the stem to go into. Use dark or bittersweet chocolate and coat the whole bottom of the cap (like the gills would look). The meringue is very sweet, but the bittersweet chocolate totally balances it out! Don't worry about getting a little chocolate on the caps, as it just looks like dirt. When done, dip the broken pieces in the remaining chocolate for your own little treat. :) Store in fridge when done (I had them in my fridge for 3 days...uncovered, and they were great) which keeps them from getting sticky. These take a little bit of time, but are well worth it, and fun! I can't believe how real they look when they're done. Have fun! Thank you Holly!

Fantastic and fun.  Personally I don't think this took much more work than most fancy cookies, but time (waiting) yes!  I used microwave melted semi-sweet chocolate chips to connect tops to bottoms.  Placing your freshly connected caps and stems upside down in empty egg cartons is a great way to allow you to keep moving.  Put the carton in the fridge or freezer for a few minutes and your ready to setup some more.  I rotated 2x18 egg cartons and never had to wait.  The biggest challenge is creating good stems that are straight enough to support the shroom standing!  For my first attempt I was only batting about 40% but next time I'll do better.  Good luck!

This is my first review ever but I felt the need to write one after this recipe won me the most creative cookie award at a Christmas cookie exchange.  One thing that I did a little differently was to use a Martha Stewart suggestion to heat the sugar and 1/2 cup water over low heat until the sugar dissolves and then bring to a boil cooking until the mixture reaches 248 degrees.(hard-ball stage) on a candy thermometer.  That way I didn’t have any problems getting the sugar to dissolve when I added it to the egg whites.  I also found that I had to turn the oven off after two hours and just let the meringue sit in the oven for hours (one batch I left overnight) until it was hard (which could have been because it was raining when I made the meringue).  I also waited until after they were cooked to add the cocoa.  I just used my finger to smudge the cocoa over the top and stems.  I used canned chocolate frosting to coat the underside of the top and to connect the stem to the top.  Everyone raved about them at the cookie exchange!  Don’t be scared . .  I never made meringue before and it was really easy.

These were amazing! As other reviewers have said this is foolproof - I was missing an attatchment for my piping bag so ended up snipping a hole in a freezer bag to pipe my mushrooms. Despite the meringues looking VERY rustic prior to assembling the final result was totally realistic! I rolled the mushrooms in cocoa rather than dusting and just blew off the excess. My brother in law wouldnt touch them at first stating ' I hate mushrooms'. Took a few minutes of convincing before he examined them enough to realise they were meringue. Used them to border my 3-year olds birthday cake, went down a treat. I subbed the same amount of white vinegar for the cream of tartar as had none in my cupboard.

Rave reviews from a cookie party. They're a little tricky to figure out in the beginning, but once you crush about five by accident, the other 100 or so turn out AMAZING. I've made several batches since my first try, all with high praise from friends.

Super easy and fun! I made several of these for yule log cakes I made.  Everyone thought they were real mushrooms! I used melted chocolate to fuse the caps to the stems.  I also dotted some chocolate spots to the caps.

Fantastic recipe!  My sister and I made these for our Christmas dinner and it was a hit! They looked so real that people thought we were serving uncooked shrooms straight from the container.  I ended up throwing my first batch away because I had over beat the egg whites before adding the cream of tarter. The egg whites did not peak and did not hold it's shape.  Follow the directions carefully!  My family doesn't like super sweet desserts and this was definitely on the extreme end of the sweetness scale.  Next time I'll reduce the sugar by at least 1/4 of a cup, if not half.    Overall, easy and fun to make. :)

I have made the mushrooms and they look so real and do make the best gift!  Last Christmas I used this recipe and added icing food coloring gel to it to make tiny Christmas trees and adorned them with colored sugar sprinkles to decorate.  I am using this recipe again this year.  Thank You for this post it has become a staple in my kitchen.

I'm sorry, but even when I went over the tops of the caps with a wet finger my mushrooms turned out horribly uneven. I even started them without the tips on top! I even watched the Martha Stewart episode on making meringue mushrooms! Any suggestions? I thought this was going to be a fairly easy task but it turned into a horrible mess.

This is a great and easy treat! I made them last night for the first time and was thrilled to find out how easy the are. I have never worked with meringue before or piped anything from a bag(large zip-lock works great) and my mushrooms looked like the real thing. HINT: about meringue, I left my mushrooms on top of the stove and planned to bag them up in the morning. When I returned the next day they were very very sticky due to the humidity in my kitchen. I am scrambling right now to try to dry them out by setting them close to our wood stove, hair dryer and cook stove(I made several batches). And on top of all that it started raining tody!!! (BIG NO-NO FOR MERINGUE)  Thank goodness our cookie exchange isn't until Tuesday, so I still have some time to make more if necessary. Sure am glad this recipe is soooo easy!   P.S. Just checked on my mushrooms.....oven at 150 degrees worked perfect.....hair dryer did not :0}

Super fun and super creative! A little time consuming but worth it. For any coffee lovers: I switched the vanilla extract for coffee extract and used expresso powder instead of cocoa and they were a HUGE hit. I'll definitely be making these again!

Not only are they tasty, they are so cute!! I made these & people went crazy. They look very hard to make, but after a couple you get the hang of it. I would also recommend cooking the stems on a sep. cookie sheet from the tops, they may cook at different times. Enjoy this great recipe.

Unbelievable!  They look so much like the real thing, it's scary!  My advice is to make 30% more stems than caps, because some of mine flopped over.  Thanks for the coolest recipe ever!

They are super cute and look real. My favorite spritz cookie recipe calls for egg yolks only, so I always have a bunch of egg whites to use up.  I use the scrapings of a vanilla bean for flavoring and they came out tasting like a toasted marshmallow, really really good. A nice dark chocolate painted all on the bottom of the cap will give it a good textural foil to the light airy meringue and looks realistic.  I used a premium brand bittersweet chips because the chocolate will be a star flavor player.  Craft stores now sell little paper mache baskets that resemble the mushroom baskets. Makes a very cute gift for my gluten free friends!

WOW!!!
these turned out awesome.
just to be said, 1 hour was not enough so after 1 hour I turned off the oven and left those there for another 2 hours with the oven door closed. just unbelievably awesome. this is of course a keeper.

I've been making these for years for my young cousins who have a severe gluten intolerance. These were the only "cookies" they could have, and they're so much fun to make.  Best thing about them is the less careful you are, the more realistic they look!

I had a bunch of leftover egg whites from making eggnog and decided to try these meringues.  I used a ziplock back and cut the corner off to pipe out the stems and caps.  This worked quite well but some of my stems ended up being too short and fat.  I found that the mushrooms looked more realistic when I dipped my finger in cocoa and smudged it on after baking the mushrooms rather than sprinkling it on beforehand.  Overall, these were pretty easy to make but quite time consuming.  I live in Florida so we really don't have any non-humid days even in December.  These set up pretty well considering. A few were still kind of chewy in the center but they were crispy on the outside.  A tasty sugary treat that looks really impressive! Edited: I am changing my 4 star rating to a 5 because of how much every liked these at our party tonight.  Every mushroom got eaten and no one could believe I made them.

Perfect recipe! I have made them a dozen times at least. I bring them to xmas parties and mail them to old friends (they ship well and store for weeks in ziplocks). If you take care in your presentation and serve them mid-summer, people may ask you how sure you are these are not poisonous mushrooms :).

If your first batch of meringue is not stiff enough for making stems - don't despair - just use it all to make caps. Then make a second batch on a drier day, leaving out vanilla and being extra-careful to make the perfect stiff meringue for stems.

I found that my hand mixer with two beaters is much better at making a stiff meringue than when I use the single whisk attachment. A cookie decorating bag with the tip removed works really well for making stems, but a larger/stiffer ziplock will do in a pinch.

I usually don't measure the volume of eggs, and just use 3 large whites for this recipe. It still works if you leave out the salt and cream of tartar, but perhaps the eggs whip better with these ingredients. Doubling the recipe does not quite double your yield, because so much depends on the amount of air you manage to incorporate.

I did everything wrong and these came out AMAZING!!! I live in Oregon, so needless to say, it was humid. I also didn't have a pastry bag, so I used a ziploc with a small cut in a corner to squeeze out my shrooms. They came out PERFECTLY! I was blown away. They fooled two guests into thinking they were real, raw mushrooms. I placed them in a cardboard fruit basket from the farm.  The only changes I made are that I doubled the vanilla (on accident, but it was a good accident) and I froze them when they were done to prevent the humidity from destroying them. It worked!

I did a slightly different version, dying half of the meringue with food coloring, then I hollowed out the caps a bit like another person suggested and used white chocolate to "glue" the stems in place and make white dots. So mine were more Mario Bros style of mushrooms. Great decorations for cupcakes if you make them mini-sized!

I had my doubts about this, but WOW!! This was fun and really rewarding! The first batch was a little goofy but I got better and better with each batch I made. I gave away a ton of them for Christmas and received rave reviews! I will definitely make these again =)

This is so easy and so fun! I just made them today with my younger sister (something we could actually bond over!) and we had a blast. We mixed a little food colouring with light corn syrup to paint Alyce in Wonderland polka dots onto the mushrooms instead of making them look real. We also added a chocolate base to make sure they stood up since some of the stalks fell over while baking. It really didn't take much chocolate to connect everything together perfectly, or much piping skill to get workable stalks and caps for the mushrooms. They looked great, tasted great, and were a blast to make. 
Oh - and as a tip, I wasn't sure what a "half cup" of egg whites would turn out to be since I was going egg by egg - it's three egg whites. (Which is perfect for when I make the "cracked sugar cookies I"  that calls for three egg yolks!)

I was so happy to find this recipe.  A childhood friend's mother used to make these and I thought it was an Icelandic treat, because that is where she was from.  I have been trying to get the recipe from her.  I had never worked with Meringue before so it was tough.  I used the zip lock bag as a pastry bag, but that didn't work so well.  The stems did not turn out at all, and I yielded only 12 mushroom "caps"  I did sample the stems with the confectioners chocolate and the flavor was good.

Oh, I looooove these!  So cute and original!  I will plan to bring these to a cookie exchange this year - finally something different yet tasty!  I made recipe as directed and they were great, though my stems were a bit small - probably needed to whip them until they were a bit thicker.  They still turned out adorable!  Thanks!

This was so much fun.  The project took a long time, but I loved every minute of it.  All of my approx. 25 medium size mushrooms turned out GREAT!  Thanks for the recipe and thank you everyone whose comments and photos helped me make these on my first try - with so much success. I've wanted to make these for 20 years.  Now I know I can and I plan to keep making them every year.   One tip for decorating that I learned on my own: I painted the underside with the same chocolate I used to glue the stem to the top.  Then, after a few minutes, when the chocolate was partially set up, I used a toothpick to scratch stripes that looked like the underside of a mushroom.  They turned out so realistic, family members were fooled at first.  Time consuming but fun!!  Oh, and these are delicious as well.

These were perfect! If you let the stems sit on the baking sheet a few minutes before baking, they become a little stiffer and you can shape them with your finger.  Unfortunately, it wasn't humid the day I made them, but it was the next day. They became soft and almost squishy, but I put them in the freezer and they came out fine. Will be making this recipe for other cake decorations as well. Better to make these the day you need them. The longer they sit out, the softer they become. Very tasty and realistic...Simple recipe and easy to do!

I had never made or even eaten meringues before, but I made these for my godson. He loved them and so did I. I didn't make the mushroom shape though, just used a large star tip and swirled them. Dusted with cocoa and they were delish!

It's going to take some practice to get the shapes right, but then again, I've never really worked with meringue, or a piping bag. I loved them, they were too sweet, borderline on burning the back of my throat. I'm going to cut back the sugar by 1/2 C next time. The second time I made them I tried mixing the cocoa powder in the meringue instead of dusting, it's definitely *not* recommended. All in all, awesome.

So, So awesome! I made these as part of our annual holiday food baskets and they were a HUGE hit.  My fiance, who never cooks, made these with me.  I also used them to decorate a Buche de Noel for Christmas Eve.  These are a keeper and will be part of our baskets every year from here on out.

I think it definitely takes a couple mushroom caps to get your technique down. I'm sure someone already wrote about this but... I read somewhere that you can fix the peak that is sometimes left behind by using a MOIST (not wet) finger. At first I was trying to use light strokes to smooth the peak....after experimenting I came to the conclusion that using a moist finger to very gently pat down the peak and tail worked perfect. They came out so awesome! Totally worth the time.

I loved it! I thought they were the cutest things. I myself don't prefer mushrooms but in this form I'll eat them anytime. Instead of the chocolate confectioners thing(since I had no idea what that was) I just melted down chocolate chips. I made Buche de Noel for my French Christmas Fête and I saw all the pictures with mushrooms on it. So I did that also. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these mushrooms to adorn the Buche de Noel I made at Christmas.  I halved the recipe, which made MORE than enough.  Super easy, as long as you have minimal experience with a pastry bag.  They looked (and tasted!) great.  My one tip is to use a wet fingertip to smooth the mushroom caps if you end up with a bump.

These are AWESOME!!! I would give them a higher rating if I could. They were so easy to make, despite that I have only made meringue once or twice in my life. I didn't find it time-consuming at all - the prep was simple, and the long part was the bake time which requires no active work. The mushrooms look great, and as a plus, they are absolutely delicious...I had to make myself stop snacking on them so I could use them for my buche de noel. :) 

Thank you so much for this excellent recipe.

Really very easy to make, but people are very impressed.  They store very well in an air tight container.

Easy to make but when decorating a Yule log do it last minute since the moisture in the icing will affect the stems of the mushrooms. Everyone loved them and one guest thought they were real mushrooms.

Super cute!  I made these yesterday for today's Buche de Noel.  They are so realistic looking.  I followed another's suggestions and brushed the cocoa after they had cooled to make them look even more real.  For the chocolate "glue", I just melted chocolate chips in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time stirring after each 30 seconds.  I halved the recipe and got 15 regular to large sized mushrooms.

These are my go-to to take for holiday gifts, pot lucks, baking with grandkids, etc. Simple ingredients, easy to make (no humidity in my part of the country) and tasty. Occasionally change flavor to match season or holiday... peppermint, almond, or cinnamon for example.

Great meringue recipe (even if you do not want to make the mushroom shapes), but the mushrooms are so cute, and no more work than a regular meringue cookie. What I learned: recipe doubles easily, makes a lot, use room temp egg whites, beat with whisk attach., and add the tartar and sugar etc. as written (make sure the eggs are beaten a bit and foamy before adding other ingr, as orig recipe states). Sprinkled cocoa on top while wet on some and others piped w/ large star tip and sprinkled w/ green sparkly sanding sugar. TRY THIS!

these are super cute but pretty time consuming - I would consider these more of a decoration than something you'd be dying to eat - in the end - a lot of work for something not so tasty, but SUPER cute!

So much fun to make!  My 12 year old daughter had so much fun with this recipe!  They really turned out looking like real mushrooms.  Friends and family were amazed they were edible and that my daughter did most of the work!

Wonderful! I was amazed at how simple (of coarse tasty) these were, and how great they looked! My first attempt at a meringue was a success. A friend of the family (whom owned their own very successful bakery) said they were definately quality, which made me feel really good considering she does not give false compliments. My son loves them as well!

These "mushrooms" are sure to impress everyone, and they're really much easier to make than seems possible!  The recipe has everything- great presentation, good taste and texture, and it's low in fat!  I made these for a wedding shower, and everyone loved them.

This is a terrific meringue recipe. I found it very easy, it made loads of mushrooms and I had some left over for pretty meringue stars. The assembled mushrooms are adorable. I used my stand mixer with the whisk attachment and I had meringue in no time at all. I'll definitely make these again.

These turned out so cool!! My husband made them to go with a Yule log for Christmas Eve. Mind you he doesn't really cook or bake at all and these taste and look awesome!  He just melted chocolate chips rather than chocolate confectioners coating, we weren't really sure  what that was.

I made these for Easter and everyone raved about them. My intention was to substitute almond extract for the vanilla, but in my haste I grabbed the peppermint. Thankfully I only put in 1/2 teaspoon. It was a happy accident. It complimented the chocolate nicely. I did flub these a little, and they still turned out relatively well. I waited to add the tartar, salt, and extract until I the eggwhites where already making soft peaks. I think this affected the stiffness/ ability of the meringue to hold it's shape well. I also was a little concerned that when I took these out of the oven, the inside was still soft. However, after letting them sit and cool on the cookie sheet they hardened and turned out to be just right. Thanks for a great recipe, I will be making these again!

These are fantastic!  This recipe is incredibly easy, it did take a little bit of time to assemble the mushrooms but it was fun.  And the end result is well worth it.   I made a test run of these and took them to work so my co-workers could try them (they love being guinea pigs!)  Everyone raved about them and couldn't believe that they were not real mushrooms.  Several people asked for the recipe.    I had a few minor problems while baking these, which was on my end.  I was able to pipe the caps, but when trying to pipe the stems the meringue was really runny and wouldn't hold its shape.  I was able to easily remedy this by putting it back into the bowl and whisking it until it was really fluffy.  Also, at an hour and at 225 degrees my meringues turned really brown.  I think next time I will lower the temp to 200 degrees and bake slightly longer.  I think I might also cut back on the sugar because they are really sweet as is.  I did one thing differently and used white chocolate as well.  After applying melted semi-sweet chocolate to the caps, I let it set for a few minutes then applied a layer of melted white chocolate. Then I made the "gills" with a  tooth pick.  I will definitely be making this recipe again, putting this in my Christmas favorites file!

This is a really cool recipe. I didn't find them to be much work at all. The only part that really requires any actual effort is the assembly, and that was more fun than work. The serving amount is pretty variable. If you make them small you're going to get significantly more than 36, if you make them bigger you'll probably get less.   This is also a make-it-ahead recipe in my opinion. The day you make it the meringue will have a chalk-like consistency. It still tastes fine, I just personally didn't like the texture. I tossed all of the mushrooms into a tupperware container and the next day they were much better. Less chalky, more melt-in-your-mouth.

I'm still going to give this 5* (but I pretty much screwed it up!)...Okay, I wanted to try a new meringue recipe, and this one sounded good. (Also, I didn't actually make mushrooms, just wanted to make a basic meringue cookie using this recipe). I followed the recipe exactly, except used lemon extract, BIG MISTAKE! The mixture was nice and foamy right up until I added the extract. I later learned that lemon extract is oily, hence 'flattening' the egg whites. My batter ended up flat & runny, but I went ahead and made flat 'discs' on the parchment & baked as directed. I was concerned that it would continue to run, but it didn't- it still kept its shape (see picture). So, I was thinking...maybe I could have placed metal cookie cutters on the parchment & poured in the batter to let it fill the shape? Anyhow...stick w/ VANILLA extract ONLY!! And, of course- I live in Florida & it's June (so it's hot), so that could have effected it...who knows. But I must say that those mushrooms ARE cute...so 5 stars for cuteness!! :)

Prepared exactly as noted, except I didn't have baking chocolate. I melted unsweet chocolate and chocolate chips & that worked fine. I also watched a video on YouTube to see exactly how to make the correct shapes. Very helpful for my first go round with mushroom making. Turned out so cute --- tons of compliments!

Turned out great! We made them to put on our Buche de Noel and the class thought they were real mushrooms at first. A few things I wanted to mention:

-We are high altitude here, and had to beat the  out of the mix.

-Be sure you bake them long enough/ don't make them too large, or they will be gooey.

-We microwaved the chocolate fifteen seconds at a time, stirring between so it wouldn't separate.

-If you leave off the dusting of cocoa powder, you can put on tiny (so they solidify without running) dots of light corn syrup mixed with red food dye for something different.

Ok, I made these today except I just made the actual meringue part of the recipe so I didn't make them into mushrooms. This was the first time that I have ever made meringues and these turned out great and were very easy to make. I'm sorry I didnt do the full recipe, but since it was my first time doing meringue I wanted to use a recipe that was 5 stars and I thought Id start with the basics. I will try the full recipe soon though. Thanks.

So cute, and not very hard I might add.  I live in Panama where the humidity is something like 90% and they still turned out.

I will admit these were a little confusing to make, only beacause I wasnt sure if I was piping the stems right. I dusted with cinnamon and used melted white chocolate as my 'glue'
Only change i would make is maybe adding chocolate chips next time as i dont like a 'bare' menigue
Presentation was verry creative!

These were so much fun! I only needed enough to garnish a yule log (Chocolate Decadance Yule Log from this site,) but they were so good and so REALISTIC I finished using all the meringue mixture and brought the rest to work today. (Boy, were my co-workers impressed!)

These are soo easy to make, very few ingredients. Really not that messy at all, just have to be organized. Turned out great, everybody thought they were so cute and very delicious too! I did cut down on the sugar though; I only added 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup. Really good though! I made half as mushrooms, and the other half, I added some chocolate chips to the batter, and dropped spoonfuls onto tray, and made them as meringue cookies.

so easy to make, and the look so nice.  I couldn't find my large regular tip so I cut a hole in a ziploc bag.  only issue was it didn't pipe out round so I dipped my fingers in water and you can fix/shape them.  if your having trouble piping the stems you can pipe them flat on the pan and when they are baked u can trim the end flat so it can stand up.  make a couple extra caps so you can have some test pieces to check for doneness.   they should release from the pan after the initial 1 - 1.5 cook time.  if they are not as done in the middle as you want,  turn the oven off and crack the door open and leave trays in oven. 

these are awesome decorations,  the texture was good and interesting, they were just to sweet for me.

easy peasy lemon squeezy..... this is such an easy recipe,  if you mess it up, it really is your own fault.  Follow the directions and practice, they turn out perfectly.  Also, if you use parchment or a silpat it's easy to remove the mushroom pieces.

Great recipe, and worth the time. I always use meringue mushrooms at Thanksgiving and Christmas! 

If you're in a pinch and don't have the time to make them, go to www.enchantedbakeshop.com. You can get a pack for cakes. I haven't seen anyone else selling them.

I have used many meringue recipes over the years but this will the only one from now on! I decided on this recipe because I wanted to do something fun with some leftover egg whites. The recipe came together perfectly and the mushrooms look great! They were a big hit with everyone at Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks so much for sharing!

I was very nervous about making these mushrooms.  The meringue is delicious and they were much easier to make than I expected.  I watched a video on YouTube also - this alleviated some of my reluctance.

I made these last Christmas to go with a chocolate Yule Log. They were a lot easier than I thought they'd be. I guess I did a good job making them because the grown kids took one look and asked if those were real mushrooms. They looked and tasted great!  The only down side to them is humidity. They have to be stored in a dry place at room temperature.  My yule log was a big hit in appearance and taste. Will be doing this again, I'm sure, and I will probably also do a couple of pumpkin yule logs (yum!) with cream cheese icing and these meringue mushrooms.

5 stars for presentation. 3 stars for taste. I made these to decorate the Buche de Noel I'm making later this week so I'm not too concerned with the taste. Maybe less vanilla extract next time. Also, I was not able to pipe the stems and I do not suggest not piping the stems. My mushrooms were short but still very cute.

SO GOOD!  And much easier than I thought they would be!  I made these for our Christmas yule log cake but ended up making them 3 times as they just kept disappearing off my kitchen counter they are delicious!  They look so real that I actually put a real mushroom on the plate with them and my husband almost ate it.  (I only stopped him because he was handing it to our toddler son who probably wouldnt appreciate the practical joke.)  Seriously though everyone thought they were real mushrooms on the cake!  Thank you for making me look so talented.

I used this recipe to adorn a Yule Log (there's a picture among the uploaded photos) and it turned out great! I actually quartered the recipe since my Yule Log wasn't very big, so I only used 1/8 cup egg whites (which was a single egg white). Although it took a bit longer to turn to meringue consistency than it does when there's multiple eggs, it still worked fine! I ended up making a meringue caterpillar as well.   The meringue is easy to work with (I used the Ziploc bag method, for easy cleanup afterward) and they tasted yummy. I tried painting some with food coloring (not mixed with anything else) and others with food coloring mixed with corn syrup; I prefer the unmixed food coloring because with the corn syrup + coloring, the dots never dry out and remain sticky to the touch.  I will definitely keep this recipe and use it again!

Two thumbs up!  Fun to make with kids, look very cool, and pretty yummy too.  I didn't have any confectioners coating on hand, so I used hazelnut spread (ie Nutella) and piped the tops with plenty of it so that they almost had a filling.  If you want to use the leftover egg yolks, I highly recommend the Amazingly Good Eggnog recipe on this site!

This recipe is great!  Easy to make and they look exactly like mushrooms!    I made three times in two days.  One thing I found out is that you for sure need exactly 1/2 cup of egg whites.  The second time I made them it looked like I had close to 1/2 cup egg whites with 3 extra large egg whites.  The meringue never got to the stiff peak stage.  4 extra large egg whites is perfect!    I also baked them for 1 hour and 15 minutes.      They look very difficult, but they are really quite easy to make.    A real hit!

Love this meringue cookie recipe!! I didn't make them the shape of mushroom, instead I make it into bones for Halloween. I dusted them with matcha/green tea powder and cocoa powder, they turned out amazing!! Just the right amount of sweetness and it just melts in your mouth. My oven temperature was not very steady, so I baked them for about 30 minutes at ~300 F, they still turned out perfect.. Thanks for the great recipe :)

Turned out perfect! Everyone thought they were real mushrooms and thought they were delicious. I have not done much decorating and piping for awhile, used a zip lock bag with a hole cut out and although my stems looked rather pitiful on the cookie sheet there was enough for lots of practice and when I assembled them they turned out better looking then I had hoped!

The mushrooms were a hit for my Yule log cake at Christmas.  Everyone loved them and was fooled into thinking they were real.  I cut down the sugar a bit as another person mentioned--a quarter less.  Some still said they were very sweet, so I can imagine the full sugar amount would be a bit much.  For those who are lactose intolerant or going low calorie for dessert, it's a great recipe and sure to please.  I will use a pastry bag or a better ziplock bag.  They came out uneven, but still realistic.  Most people didn't seem to mind.  I will definitely do it again!

I found these to be great.  They took longer than the 1 hour to bake through but looked and tasted great.  I made these for a Super Bowl Party in 2012 and got lots of compliments.  I used a micro plane and flattened the tops of the stem, then I "glued" the cap on with the use of chocolate.

I really enjoyed these.  I've never made meringue cookies before, and was a little skeptical.  The hardest part was putting them together.  And it wasn't hard - just time consuming.  I used white chocolate to glue them together as that's all I had on hand.  I will definitely be making them again!  I like being able to make different sizes, sprinkled with cinnamon, or crushed candycane - there's so many variations in the reviews, they can be customized for any occasion!  Thank you!!

these were great... i made this in my unairconditioned apartment in Hawaii, and i definitely needed to cook them longer than an hour for them to be dry (at a lower temp, too), but otherwise i had no problems. since i'm no artist, my 'shrooms were pretty ugly, but were a big hit nonetheless! will make again, they were delicious and light.

I love making these. They can be a bit time consuming but definitely worth it. My family requests that I make these all the time, and when I do, they are gone quick! They are super cute and really tasty. This is the perfect recipe.

These little mushrooms are awesome! They are time consuming but not that hard to make. I did have some trouble with the meringue setting but in the end, I improvised. When the meringue would not stay up for the stems I piped 2 long flat pieces for each stem and baked them like normal. Then after the baking I glued the 2 long pieces together with chocolate to form a 3-d stem. However, the stem was rounded on the bottom and they would not stand so I dipped the bottoms in chocolate to form a base and chilled them. Once the bases were set I followed the steps as before and attached the stems to the caps. They were worth it since they were a HUGE hit at my Alice in Wonderland party!

The meringue mushrooms are in the oven as we speak. And it was really easy to make. Though I had some problems with the amount of eggs and sugar since we don't use the cup measurement here. They were a lot of fun to make but it takes some time before you have found the best way to make the stems. (It was the first time I used the pastrybag so it also could just be me :) ) I can't wait of them to be finish and taste them!

I have made these several times over the past few years and always loved them.  This year I added them to a Halloween cookie tray but made them into small toadstools and larger ghosts.  Everyone really loved them.  Of course, it took a lot more time making them small button mushroom size but it was worth it.

This is such a simple recipe, and even though it takes time to complete, it isn't complicated. Since I first made it 3 years ago, I am no longer allowed at Christmas, or Thanksgiving now too, unless I bring these mushrooms.  Even at Summer BBq's, my family is now insisting that I bring them.  They are wonderful.

The cooking time for this recipe is way off. 1 hour at 225 leaves you with a chewy center (raw eggwhite) It takes 2 hours for the cookies to have the crisp dry texture they are meant to have.

These are a delicious treat! Great for gifting in produce baskets or to adorn a woodland cake.

It stayed in the exact shape I piped it, no settling or growing, even after I shaped some with a wet finger.

Also I used white chocolate just stick the caps and stems together, as white gills were mostly what I saw on Google images.

Thanks for the great recipe and idea! I'll definitely be making them again.

Sprinkling the cocoa on before you bake them was the key to realism. They looked so real, my dad refused to try one even after I told him they were candy! Used them on a buche de noel.

Cute idea & they looked great. They looked better than I thought they would once I put the stems and tops together after they were baked.  I thought they were too sweet, though. I'd cut back on the sugar next time.

very pretty. They taste okay. For the time it takes to make them, I'd rather make something tastier.
