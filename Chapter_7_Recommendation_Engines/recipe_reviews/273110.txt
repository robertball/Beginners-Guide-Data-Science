One of the best cakes I've ever made! Rave reviews from everyone. This cake is perfect for a dish that needs to be prepared a day in advance as a time saver. Definitely cook the cake 28-30 minutes so it is completely done- you will be pouring a lot of liquid on it right after it comes out of the oven! Also, I found that letting it sit on the countertop for 4 hours after pouring on the liquids allows it to cool completely, absorb the liquids & firm back up. After the 4 hours, I ice it with the whipped topping and coconut. Store in the fridge until it's gone...which will be in one day!!

My family loved this cake.  It did not stay around very long.
