I used to have this for dessert at a restaurant in Glouscester, MA many years ago. It was great then and I love it now with this recipe. They always topped it with a dollop of whipped cream and I did too!

I loved this recipe! My mom used to make it when I was little and she often would eat most of it herself. Now I remember why! the custard is very creamy and the grains add a nice distinguishing texture. I made it with raisins and also added cinnamon to the top instead of stirring it throughout. The custard was so fine it didn't need any embellishment.

1 hour is definately too long when you bake custard that long it tightens all the protiens and comes out watery next time i will start testing for doneness at about 35 to 40 minutes

This recipe is amazing!! Other ones you have to cook it all on the stovetop before baking; this one you just combine the ingredients and bake. Mine didn't need the entire hour it was ready in 45 minutes. Add plenty of nutmeg and enjoy this wonderful old-fashioned treat.

Was the restaurant in Gloucester Amelia's? That's where I first had this. This version has more grapenuts next time I'd put in half the amount. I doubled the recipe and served it with whipped cream delicious!

I was looking for a grapenut pudding from my childhood. Although this one was close it just didn't have the same taste. Had I not tasted my Mom's this one might have earned a 5 star rating.

Being from Connecticut of English heritage and growing up on a dairy farm this was one of our favorite goodies Mom made. My husband used this recipe (okay I picked it out) because I needed something delicious after knee replacement surgery and requested this. It was like Mom wrapping her arms around me. Just perfection!! It did take 1 hr and 5 min to bake to perfection.
