The potatoes get done faster if you cut them small and broil in the oven for 5-10 min rather than cook in pan on stove (they get crisper).  then you can just add the crab mixture right into the pan you have roasted the potatoes in (we used glass baking pan).

Very tasty. I added a little more Old Bay than called for. This would be good with fried eggs for breakfast. The only reason that I'm not giving it 5 stars is that there seems to be something missing, which my husband and I couldn't identify. But we enjoyed it nonetheless.

Quick and easy, but crab makes for a more expensive shopping list, and the dish as a whole just isn't flavorful / colorful enough to warrant it.

Made a version of this with shredded potatoes that went pretty well.  Also shredded the onions.  Other then that I kept it mostly the same. Quite yummy!

It’s pretty good!! I’m going to try adding green peppers next time I make it and since we don’t have Old Bay I just used a no-salt seasoning with some cayenne pepper. Canned potatoes work really good for this recipe. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I too added a little more Old Bay than the recipe called for but other than that I made as written. My taters were beautiful , brown, and crisp all up to the time I added the crab/onion/ketchup mix and then they turned into soggy mush. Nature of hash I suppose. This tasted great but if you are looking to serve to guests I recommend plating the potatoes and then drizzling the rest over the potatoes. That way you are keeping all of the flavor but there is more eye appeal to your dish. And, lets just face it..we eat with our eyes.
