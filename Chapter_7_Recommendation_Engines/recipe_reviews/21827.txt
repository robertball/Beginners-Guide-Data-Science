Simple, quick and delicious! I love acorn squash and my Mom always used to make it this way. I'm so glad I found this recipe. This is a fall and winter classic and what's great is it takes virtually no time at all! If you want to spice things up add a little cinnamon or nutmeg.

This recipe not only takes care of the job in about 1/3 the time it takes in a conventional oven, but also frees up the oven! Wish I would have thought to cook it this way YEARS ago. I think the last time I made acorn squash in the oven WAS the last time I'll make acorn squash in the oven! Also, I used one large squash and the cooking time and amounts of brown sugar and butter were perfect. Thanks, Corinne, for sharing Nana's recipe!

I make this recipe almost the same way except I bake in the oven at 350 degrees.  My kids didn't like squash so I called this California sweet potato and they loved it. I baked in the oven at 350 degrees.  I crunch up a large piece of aluminum foil, then nest the acorn squash in the aluminum foil so they don't tip over.  Bake for about 1 hr.  Another variation I've heard is to use maple syrup with the butter instead of the brown sugar.  Anyway you make it, it is delicious.

This is a dish you can make when you decide at the last minute that you want squash. The microwave does it in half the time of a regular oven. Very easy and tasty recipe. I used a small squash so only put one tablespoon each of brown sugar and butter. The taste was perfect. Will make this again. Thanks for the recipe

My fiance and I loved this recipe!  My small squash did not take quite 15 minutes to cook in the microwave, and during broiling I added a little maple syrup and bourbon.  It was wonderful.

You can see that fall is right around the corner here in Pennsylvania, with the abundance of squash at the local farmers market. I love acorn squash, but it takes to long to cook, the conventional way. You can't get any EASIER than this recipe. Just be careful on the cook time. If your squash are small, use the minimum amount of time, so as not to over cook. Thank you Corinne for a quick and delicious recipe. AUTUMN HARVEST KEEPER.

This was so easy and I really loved the micro/broil method to cut time. I think my squash were small (softball size) so I could have used far less butter. I ended up dumping out the excess and they were great! I also drizzled the edges of the squash halfway through broiling with the melting butter/sugar. My husband made more than one comment during dinner as to how good the squash was. Very nice lightly sweet side dish to break up a savory dinner. Great first time squash experience!

Yummy!  Even my husband who doesn't like any kind of squash raved over this! He said it was the best squash dish that he'd ever had. Using the microwave made the squash soft and moist. Thanks for the wonderfully sweet and satisfying recipe!

This was a great recipe! Just as good as cooking it in the oven. I added some honey, cinnamon, and freshly ground nutmeg to each squash just before broiling. It turned out great!

We found it took longer than 20 minutes to microwave.  Good idea to pierce skin.  We also always add cinnamon (or cinnamon sugar to cover both).

I love acorn squash and this is exactly how my mom used to fix it.  The only addition was the sprinkle of salt and pepper.  Keeping it simple, that is what this recipe does.

Thank you, so much, for this recipe.  No matter what you like on your squash the method is perfect when you have no time for the oven.  And, this method produced the best result I can recall, even with oven baking. If you cut the squash crosswise, you'll get a pretty scalloped edge for presentation, if you're serving each half squash in its skin.

What a great quick way to use acorn squash.  Microwaving the squash made this a breeze, and once moosh up the glorious buttery sugary goop into the flesh of the squash, oh my my!  Big hit at my house :)

I usually do this in the oven, but I started too late and tried the microwave-way for the first time.  So very easy and came out just great!  I used honey, not brown sugar as a personal preference, and gave a twist each of fresh cracked sea salt and pepper.  A favorite fall comfort food, now made easier!

Ohhhh my. This is better than I could have imagined! It might be the size of the squash we had (I guess I didn't realize) but it was a tad sweet (ok, really sweet, but isn't that what makes it good?) but I made sure to use salted butter and lots of pepper and it was amazing. Husband had never had it and kept saying "I think I found a new favorite food!" Thanks for the recipe, this one is a definite keeper!

Fast, easy, delicious!  Will probably cut back a bit on the butter and brown sugar next time - not because it wasn't good - but just because it would probably be just as good with less (and I don't need the extra calories!)  I had to force myself to stop eating it!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was sooo easy!  I usually have to wait to make acorn squash for an evening when I have extra time to let it bake.  Well no more.  Followed recipe but added 1t of maple syrup to the kid's halves with the butter and sugar.  Tasted great and everyone ate it up.

The best!! Perfect in the fall as a side dish along red meat, although we cut back a little bit on the brown sugar or else the inside part of the squash gets too sweet.

I hadn't ever had acorn squash before and furthermore, I'd never cooked squash before I tried this.  It was ridiculously easy and very tasty.  It is a bit like sweet potatoes, but lighter in texture, which I liked.  I definitely think this is a winner.

Have made this twice so far.  Just a fast and easy way to make Fall squash.  Added cinnamon during broiling time.  After scooping, mashed with a potato masher - worked great.  This will be the ONLY recipe I use for squash.  Thanks!

This is a wonderful, quick way to make acorn squash and unlike the conventional way, I think the squash came out softer.  I will definately use this recipe again.

SUPER easy to make, tasted fantastic. For the record, squash is not one of my fave veggies either.  Definitely would recommend to others.

Quick and easy, broiling in toaster oven frees up oven for main course.   Loved maple syrup and butter, will try brown sugar and butter next time.

Good recipe. Great to know how to make the squash in the microwave. Really cuts down on the time. Next time I will probably not use as much butter, but overall great.

This was excellent! I made a few changes... Put some walnuts and raisins in the cavity before I broiled it. The toasted walnuts made it a little crunchy. I also added some cinnamon and omitted the pepper.

I have no doubt that this recipe is fantastic with all the butter and brown sugar but I used 1.5 teaspoons butter and 1 tablespoon brown sugar and it was great.

Had never put acorn squash in the microwave before, though I do it every time with spaghetti squash.  Worked out perfectly!  I don't put sugar on mine, but the rest of the family likes the brown sugar with some cinnamon.  The texture came out perfect!  Will cook acorn squash this way all the time now!

This was good by I cut back on the butter because it was 2 greasy. Then I mixed it like mash potato's and put it back in the accorn squash shell before I served it. It was a hit with all the kids and adults.

big improvement timewise!  Makes making just one squash very easy and quick, You don't have to plan an hour and half in advance. Personally I prefer to just melt the butter in the microwave along with the brown sugar and spoon it into the squash. Seems easier than messing with the broiler!!!

Super easy, super tasty!!!  Note:  Size DOES matter, I used a small squash so I needed far less butter and brown sugar.  Adjust the recipe to fit the size of your squash.  Also, I didn't use pepper - just salt.  Next time around I may add a dash of maple syrup for even more sweet flavor... Excellent recipe all around.

This is just like my father used to make!  He used to steam the squash, though, in the oven.  The microwave is much more convenient.  It's hard to believe something with such simple ingredients and preparation can be so good, but it is.  Depending upon the size of the squash, it can easily serve 4.  We serve it with lamb shanks and sauerkraut or pork tenderloin and cabbage and apples.  Great fall fare!

This dish is better than eating an unadorned acorn squash, but not much.  It was extremely easy, though, which adds a star or so, in my estimation.  Maybe a little kick (cumin or cayenne... chili powder?) would help this dish.

This is the way to do it.  I've always baked the cut squash in the oven for over an hour, and even then you can't be sure the squash is soft all the way through.  Microwaving first to steam it until thoroughly tender is a great idea -- it saves all that oven energy, and it's so much faster.  Thanks for sharing this!

Easy to make and so delicious! As per another poster, I added a splash of bourbon and used maple syrup instead of brown sugar. Yummy. It's a keeper.

Perfect and easy! I used 1 T butter and 1 T brown sugar in each half which was plenty of me. Made it another time and added 1 T pure maple syrup which was delicious also. So good and easy. Even my 11 y.o ate it.

Needs no salt or pepper! I added a tsp or so of maple syrup to add some flavor :) though it is great on it's own.  Some may enjoy a little nutmeg or cinnamon also. I love how much faster it is to cook in the microwave than totally in the oven.

Delicious! I love acorn squash and this was fantastic! I did cut back the butter and brown sugar, though. I feel the full amount would have been too sweet. Also drizzled a bit of maple syrup over the top, then broiled quickly to crisp things up.

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding a dash of cinnamon.  This is a great quick way to make acorn squash. I cooked a medium size squash for 15 min in the microwave and it was perfect.  

I'm so glad I found this method of cooking it. With the hot summer heat around the corner I can still enjoy squash without turning on the oven .

This was a quick and easy recipe to include in my Christmas Eve menu.  The squash was very tender and tasted wonderful after adding the brown sugar/butter combination.  Broiling it gave the squash a beautiful brown glaze.

This was just like my mom used to make and so easy!  She added raisins and pecans.  I didn't have any pecans but I did add the raisins.  Talk about delicious!  I would have never thought to add salt and pepper but it paired perfectly with the butter and brown sugar.

Honestly, this was the first time I had ever made acorn squash but it won't be the last. I cooked the whole squash 8 min in the microwave then cut it in half, scooped out the guts and added the butter and brown sugar - I also sprinkled in a bit so cayenne pepper for a little kick. A few minutes under the broiler and it was crunchy perfection!

Always looking for easy recipes, and this is a good one.  I made it according to instructions, and it was very good, but I am not sure I even needed to use the broiler.  The butter had mostly melted before I got to that  point.  I thought maybe I had over-salted it, but I actually had to add a bit more after it was cooked.  I think a touch of nutmeg might be good in this, too, but it's also food as is.

Delicious! The microwave suggestion cuts down on cooking time by almost half from when I used to make squash in the oven.

This microwave method for squash is really great. This is exactly the way I've made acorn squash many times. I like to add some cinnamon to the brown sugar too.  I don't usually bother with the broiling-- I just put back into the microwave to melt the butter. I have discovered that you can also cook a squash in the microwave without cutting it.  Just wash and pierce the skin of the squash and put it right into the microwave. Carefully cut the squash in half and the seeds are easily scraped out.  I usually do this when the squash is kind of small. If it's a large one, it concerns me that the squash won't cook all the way evenly.

Delicious, but probably a bit too much brown sugar and butter.  Could have halved those two ingredients and would have still tasted great.

This is a great way to do acorn squash quick! It tastes great and is ready in about 30 minutes. I cut a flat portion off of the bottom of the squash so that it is more stable while in the pan. My family (especially my kids) loves it.

This was my first time making acorn squash, and it couldn't have been any easier or tasted better!  My squash was pretty small so I used half of the butter and half of the brown sugar. We'll be making this a lot now! Thank you!

first time I my husband and I ever had acorn squash.  We decided to grow it in the garden and I have to say this recipe was amazing.  We both loved it and he doesn't normally like sqaush so that says something.

Love Acorn squaw!!! This makes the whole thing EASY...but I do something a little different- into each half (after turning over) I add a small container of  cinnamon applesauce with a little brown sugar added and dot each with small pieces of butter. YUM- my man LOVES it and saves his for dessert!!!! You can add a drizzle of maple syrup into squash before the applesauce for extra flavor.

A simple recipe that's really tasty. First time I've made acorn squash... very good.  My family is not big on lots of butter and sweetness, so I used just about 1T butter and 2T brown sugar... VERY GOOD! It's a "keeper"!  :-)  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe! It's so much faster than baking in the oven and still tastes great. I put a little bit more brown sugar into mine and put them in the microwave for 9 minutes on high. I only gave it 4 stars because my boyfriend is convinced baking tastes better (I can't tell the difference).
