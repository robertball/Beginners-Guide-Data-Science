We enjoyed this soup more the next day than when I first made it.  My butternut squash wasn't very big so I didn't end up using all the broth.  The recipe calls for basil, while I like basil, I think sage would have been a better choice.  Using a hand held immersion blender makes short work of blending the soup in the pot.

It was good.  I would make it again if I found myself having 1/2 of a butternut squash with no plans.  I did cut back the broth a bit (about 5/6) used vegetable stock thus keeping it vegetarian but did add about a tablespoon of butter towards the end when I added the milk.  I also added a tbsp. flour to some of the hot soup in a mixing cup and added that back to the soup with the milk.  Brought it to a boil and then scaled back the heat and the texture was great.

This recipe is so easy. Although, I did add some minor changes, like adding creamed cheese for s twist. The soup was delish!

Not sure if I would make it again, as the quantity of stock was way too much........... would cut in half without a doubt!!!  Added lots of herbs at the end because it was rather bland. After "doctoring", was enjoyed by all !
