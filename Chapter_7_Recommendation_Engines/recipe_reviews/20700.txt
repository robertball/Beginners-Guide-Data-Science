Great flavor - very well received.  I borrowed an idea from a different recipe and used a container of crescent roll doll on the bottom of a 9x12 pan.  Made for easy serving, since the egg didn't stick to the bottom of the pan.  You could definitely get creative with this recipe (changing meats, veggies, cheese, etc).

This was a easy and delicious recipe.  I used egg beaters, low fat ricotta, skim milk, turkey sausage and low fat cheddar.  I cooked it for about 50 minutes and it turned out wonderful.  I would make this again.

I made this for supper last night.  It is wonderful!  I modified the recipe some though.  I browned the meat, added some onions and let them cook a bit.  Then added fresh broccoli, (I used the food processor to cut both veggies, easy!) after the meat mixture cooled a bit, along with the cheese.  I didn't have ricotta cheese, so I used sour cream and mozzerella instead.  Skipped the milk.  I didn't have a tomato and that's too bad, would have been even better.  My boyfriend thinks mushrooms would be a good addition too.

I am always on the hunt for good brunch casseroles.  Not only was this good, but it was very simple to make.  Try this with fresh steamed asparagus as a broccoli substitute, very tasty!  Serves well with a sweet bread and fresh fruit salad.

I made this as a Christmas morning brunch for friends who had us sleep over on Christmas Eve; I made as much in advance as possible, bagged the cooked broccoli and cheese separately and lightened up the cholesterol considerably by using only 2 whole eggs and 8 more egg whites.  I used a jalapeno cheddar and fresh broccoli, steamed and drained ahead of time.  I cooked the sausage and put it in my covered casserole dish and then added the remaining ingredients that I had prepared in baggies in layers on Christmas morning. A definite keeper, tasty, interesting and all gone!

I changed this recipe around because I don't like broccoli. I added spinach, onions, mushrooms, bacon, more cheese, more tomatoes, and garlic. I loved this!! I will definitely make it again.

Loved this recipe...so did everyone else. The only discrepancy was that it took much longer than 45 minutes to cook...closer to an hour and a half. Worth the wait!

Served this at my Easter brunch and was pretty satisfied.  I wanted to put it into a 9x13, so used 12 eggs and a bit more milk. Even though we always drink skim, I use whole milk in a recipe like this because skim makes for a watery dish.  I also used fresh steamed broccoli, sauted half an onion and half a red pepper and added them.  I think you could be creative with the cheeses you use, too.

Made it almost exactly by the recipe except used fresh broccoli and twice the amount of sausage.  I found this to be tasteless and more trouble than it was worth.
Leftovers were smothered in salsa in an effort to not be wasteful.  It didn't help.  I find this impossible to choke down.  Absolutely tasteless.  Even worse, the more you chew, the more it grows.  I gave up and threw it in the trash.

This was a definite hit with my husband and house guests.  Since tomatoes are not in season, I used slices of red, yellow, and orange bell pepper on top.  Beautiful presentation!  It did take over an hour to bake, so be sure to plan accordingly.

I thought this recipe was really good.  I substituted egg beaters for the eggs and did have to cook it an extra 10 minutes in the oven for the center to be cooked.  I also substituted thinly sliced deli turkey for the sausage.  It was great and my family enjoyed it.  I will definitely make it again but more ahead of when I want to serve, as it does take a looooong time to cook.

What I liked about this most is no bread in this dish.  I didn't have broccoli so substituted mushrooms...delicious.

Yum!  This turned out much better than I thought it might, I made it for dinner tonight.  I DID make a couple of changes based on what I had.  I used leftover baked ham instead of sausage, a full 16 oz bag of broccoli, 10 eggs and didn't have a tomato so that was left out.  I have a convection option on my oven so I cooked for about 30 minutes regularly and then another 30ish on Speed Bake.  I already can't wait to make it again and the kids asked for the leftovers for breakfast.  Thanks!

I made this casserole at a bridal shower and it was a great success.  Everyone liked the flavors and wanted the recipe.  I did use garlic salt and fresh ground pepper instead.  I also used a fresh garden tomatoe diced and spread over the top and increased the cheese to 2 cups.  It was great...husband wants me to make more!

I made this for my dad on father's day yesterday.  Everyone seemed to enjoy this, including myself!  It was very simple to prepare; I prepared it the night before, refrigerated it overnight and popped it into the oven the next morning.  I followed the recipe as written, except for that I sprinkled green onion on the top over the tomatoes.  The next time I make this, I will be adding sauteed onions and mushrooms to the broccoli/sausage mixture, as well as a little more sausage.  I would like more tomatoes on the top, so either I will add more slices or dice a few romas and put them on there instead.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Wonderul casserole if made with lightly steamed fresh vegetables,e.g.,blanched fresh broccoli.  I substituted well-drained ground pork for the sausage and used a combo of Roma tomatoes and blanched red, green and yellow sweet peppers.  Yes, it does take an hour+ to bake.  I'll made this definitely over the Yuletide.  Thank you fellow "all-recipers" for the suggestions - most useful.

I would have given this 5 stars but my boyfriend and roommate only thought this to be so-so. I used a little less cheese and ommitted the tomatoes. In their place, I sauted some onions and fresh sliced mushrooms (approx 1/3 cup worth total) and mixed it in with the broccoli before spreading over the sausage. I did have to bake it longer as others stated (almost an hour) for it to be baked through but for the record, I LOVED IT. Good combination and since it doesn't make alot, I will make again for my daughter and I to enjoy. Thanks Linda K.

We served breakfast at a dinner party and this dish was hit. Since my husband is vegetarian, I left out the meat, added extra cheese and an extra tomato.  He loved it!  Thanks for sharing

This is a yummy casserole.  My retreat sisters request this every year and there is never leftovers!  I make it meatless and leave out the sausage otherwise, I make it just as the recipe is written.

I would definitely do things a little differently. I didn't have sausage so I just used ground pork cooked with onion and garlic. Sausage would have DEFINITELY been better. Next time I'll use half the broccoli and add spinach. I'd also use drained diced tomatoes and cottage cheese instead of ricotta. It'd give it more flavor. And extra cheese!!!! It is a good base recipe. Lots of different ideas can flow from this one. Bacon next time???

This is not a 5 star recipe as written. I made it once as written (omitting tomato) and thought it had potential, so I tried again. I'm closer to having something that makes me go "Sweet, it's broccoli casserole night" instead of "I wish I hadn't bought all that broccoli.." So here is what I did that I will do again: I cooked bacon, removed it, left the drippings in the pan. I cooked fresh broccoli, onions, and a celery stalk in the bacon grease until the onions were browning. I also cooked diced jalapenos in that mixture--I used 3 rings, I'm going to up it to 6 next time and hope for the best. NEXT time I'm going to also add 1/2c. salsa or picante sauce or pico de gallo (whatever I have) into the vegetable mixture that goes on the bottom layer. I also added diced Black Forest ham. In the cheese layer, I won't change a thing except to add a healthy dose of minced garlic, and maybe some Old Bay. Also I will double the black pepper next time. Eggs demand black pepper!

I made this for a New Years Brunch.  What a hit.  I used 1 lb of sausage and used fresh broccoli that I blanched and drained.  I also made it the night before and took it out the next morning and brought it to room temperature prior to cooking.  Great recipe and easy to made.

Really tasty, but it needs more kick.  I added roasted garlic and onion to the second batch and it was much better! The ricotta cheese makes it so light and fluffy..  I really enjoyed it and will make it again! Thanks!

Really delicious! The only thing is that it took way longer to cook...like 2 hours. It was worth the wait. Also, I added onion, garlic powder, and parsley flakes.

I added peas and sliced up some sausage which was delicious! But it kind of sticked at the bottom before the middle was cooked, I guess I'll lower the temperature next time!

This turned out surprisingly tasty and pretty. And this despite the compromises. I used brocolli, onions and mushrooms instead of pork, and used just 6 eggs. Though it needed about 65 minutes in the oven. Definitely making it again.

This was outstanding. I followed the recipe exactly, though I did spray the casserole dish with a little non stick cooking spray before hand. Next time, I may add some onions and some peppers. Delicious!

I made this a few months ago, late on a friday evening to have for breakfast saturday morning.  My husband and I loved it.  It was easy to make and came out perfect.  I used low fat sausage in the round plastic package and it tasted great.  I also added some extra cheese in with the eggs.. This is one of those great casseroles to have in your arsenal for company or for just any occasion that you want a delicious breakfast :)

I used a carton of "Egg Beaters" to cut down "some" of the fat and used 16oz of pork sausage.  I also added more cheddar cheese then the recipe called for.  There were only 3 of us at dinner and we ate the entire pan!

Great recipe! Instead of the roma tomatoes I decorated the top with red, yellow, orange, & green pepper rings. Also, used spicy sausage and mexican cheese instead of cheddar. Had a nice mixed greens salad on the side for a tasty dinner but would also fix for breakfast or brunch. (I halved the recipe with no problems)

I used Italian sausage and topped it with six red bell pepper rings. It not only tasted great but made a wonderful presentation with a pepper ring on each serving. I did blanch the broccoli by pouring boiling water over it in a collander. Really yummy!

Great texture and nice to look at!  I served this for my husband and parents.  I added canned mushrooms and some diced onion.  I used light ricotta, light pork sausage, and reduced fat cheese.  It came out perfect!  I did have to cook it about 15 minutes longer, but I used a 9 x 13 dish.  This is a definate keeper!  Delicious!

We liked this recipe a lot.  We made it with some substitutions that we thought might make the dish more tasty.  We used chopped red and yellow bell peppers instead of brocolli, and used vegetarian sausages because my husband and I do not eat meat.  We served it to guests for brunch along with a caesar salad, some delicious warm crusty bread, fruit and a nice bottle of champagne and got rave reviews.  It was very easy to do as well!

I omitted the sausage from the recipe and added extra tomatos. It was great and really easy to make. The only problem I had was that it took a full hour in the oven to be firm in the center. My friends were stuck waiting eagerly at the table. They said it was worth the wait. I will be making this again

THis was really good.
Used Jimmy Dean light sausage and 10 eggs (I took out 5 of the egg yolks). I also used light ricotta cheese. I also used about 1 1/2 tsp. hot pepper sauce when browning the sausage to spice it up. I did not use light cheddar cheese - it usually doesn't subsitute well in recipes.
Will be making this again soon.

I really made this recipe my own, with your help though! Was looking for a bfast recipe when I stumbled upon this! So here is what I did:
-broccoli, salt
Sub ricotta for cottage cheese & mottzerella
+bacon, spinach, onion, mushrooms, & also shredded zucchini for first layer (subbing hashbrowns)

I added everything in layers then topped it off with this mix: pepper, spinach, milk, cottage cheese, motz, & egg 

I used your ratios and it turned out so great!

I prepared this yesterday to have for breakfast this morning. Instead I took it out of frig last night & made it for dinner. My husband who is a meat & potatoes guy ate 1/2 the pan, left himself a piece for breakfast this morning & before going to bed, said babe thanks for the great dinner. I changed it a little though. Sauteed 1/2 large spanish onion & added pre cooked sliced turkey sausage links till a little brown. Added just a touch of red pepper flakes. Instead of tomatoes, I added a drained can of mild rotel to the egg & ricotta(skim milk) mixture before pouring it on top of the sausage mixture. Other than these changes, I followed the recipe just as it is. Last night I took it out of the frig & let it sit at room temp while the oven pre heated. I followed the 30 mins covered then 15 mins uncovered. Let sit for 10 minutes & it came out perfect for us. But I used a larger 13 X 9 baking dish. I like my food hot so I put a piece in the micro for a minute & it was still perfect, so was my nuked piece I just had for breakfast. Not rubbery at all. My husband ate his cold. This is going to be a weekly meal. I think it's the ricotta that makes this so different than the usual egg casseroles. Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

Really good, added some spices.  The only bad thing is that it is one of those foods that smell when they are cold or heating up.  Leftovers taste great, smell bad.

I agree that it needs a little spicing up, but I like the basic recipe and versatility of being able to change up the veggies.  I used asparagus, soy milk, and no meat because I'm vegetarian and it still turned out well.  I would like to try the crescent roll bottom though!

Good but can definitely use some extra spices.  I followed the recipe exactly except I replaced the pork sausage with chicken sausage and added some mushrooms.  I would make this again, but I would definitely spice it up a bit.

Really good, but definitely needs more time in the oven-mine took 15-20 minutes longer to bake than the recipe called for.  I also added more broccoli to the mix.  Served this to ladies for lunch who really liked it.

I made this for New Year's Day breakfast.  We had company overnight so it was a nice different meal to make.  I, however, added a small can of sliced mushrooms, half an onion and only 1/2 cup of ricotta cheese.  I also added two more eggs.  Everyone enjoyed it; I will probably make it again but on a smaller scale.

This was awesome. Didn't have pork saus. on hand so i cut up 1.5 turkey-cheddar brats into little half moons. Used fat free cheddar and cottage cheese instead of ricotta.
It did take closer to an hour, but was well worth the wait. I imagine you can put whatever ingredients you like in this (mushrooms, green peppers, etc).

We love breakfast casseroles and this will be a wonderful new addition to our collection!!  It's a great way to get some extra veggies into your day also.  I used only a 1/2 cup of ricotta and put the tomatoes on before the extra cheese - then baked it uncovered for about 30 minutes.  I will try adding onions and mushrooms next time and maybe some different meats or cheeses, too!!

Wonderful.  My boyfriend thought it was just the best.  I used 16 0z of sage flavored sausage and put a bottom crust of crescent rolls in the pan.  Next time, I will add more cheese to the filling and top it off with some green onion and feta cheese.  I think it will be quite tasty.  Thanks.

This was a very easy recipe to follow. The dish was good, but not great. It was a bit bland. It needed an extra kick to it. Next time I will try adding some bell peppers,onions, mushrooms and using at least one cup of jalepeno cheese for the kick.

Good- I used 12 oz of low fat sausage. Maybe 2 Roma tomatoes would look better on top. Great low carb, low cal dish! We used it as an entree'.

This is very delicious and it looks as good as it tastes!  I didn't have a 7 x 11 pan so used a 8x8.  It took longer to bake than stated but could have been because of the pan change.

This recipe is so delicious!!!  My family has already requested it for Christmas morning.  I made some changes to the recipe to suit my family's taste.  Instead of tomatoes I sprinkled paprika on top to give it some color.  Also I sprinkled chopped chives on top before serving.  Overall this casserole looked gorgeous and tasted even better.

I did have to make some changes because of what I had on hand: only used 4 eggs, used colby jack instead of cheddar, and didn't cover with foil. Even with the smaller amount of eggs, I had to cook for about an hour and even increased to 375 the last 15 minutes. It looked great coming out of the oven, and I thought it was pretty good. The hubby said it was okay.

I made this for a family brunch and everyone liked it.  I baked it in a 3 qt round casserole and it kind of puffed up, making for a very nice presentation.  I had to increase the baking time to about 50 minutes in a 350 oven.  Next time I will add chopped onion and minced garlic and maybe some crushed red pepper.  I think it needs a little extra flavor.  Overall, a good recipe that one can vary with nice results.

What a tasty casserole.  I increased the recipe by adding an extra egg, more sausage and more cheese so I could use a larger dish.  Unfortunately, the leftovers weren't as tasty so I'll only plan on cooking what we can eat at the first sitting.  Very good.

I served this at a family brunch and it was loved by all.  I modified the recipe by using fresh broccoli and by adding slices of thin sliced white bread on the bottom to form a crust. The ricotta made for a nice texture.

Loved it!
I did have to make some changes but very minor I think.
I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta (mine had gone bad). I used 10 egg whites and 2 whole eggs (for my hubby who's dieting). I added some red pepper flakes to the sausage and ground red pepper to the eggs. I kinda got worried about it being bland based on other reviews. 
It was lovely, not too spicy at all. My husband ate the whole pan in  2 hours lol!

Excellent base recipe for a versatile brunch casserole. I sautéed onions and red peppers first. Then added them to the Broccoli mix. I used cottage cheese instead of Ricotta as well as 1 tsp of Tabasco in the egg mix. As for cheese. For any recipe that requires cheddar cheese, I use extra sharp cheddar. It tastes so much better. I omitted the sausage as my husband is a vegetarian. I finished the top with green onions and tomatoes. Baked for 60 min. Turned out delicious.

I made this last week just as the recipe is written.  My husband and I loved it.  I am looking for recipe's that are a bit healthier than we normally eat and that my husband will still eat... always a challenge!  But this was delicious and I am making it again tonight ;)

I do believe this recipe is adaptable to suit different tastes as well, substituting different vegetables, meat, soup, etc... enjoy!

This is a very delicious recipe. I used a 12 oz bag of chopped fresh broccoli in place of frozen.   I added chopped onion, and chopped red bell pepper.  It did require a bit longer cooking time in my oven.  We would definitely make this recipe again.

I made this as is and it turned out so well. Had to watch it closely and was afraid the center wouldn't cook without the edges burning, but it worked out great.  Next time I will do it with half egg whites, less sausage and up the veggie content to make it healthier for us. Great recipe though, thanks!

I loved it! Made it without tomatoes (not a fan) and turned out delicious. I don’t really like egg based casseroles but this was awesome.

Used fresh broccoli  (blanched) and chopped precooked sausage patties because it was on hand. Easy recipe. Liked by all for Easter brunch. Served with Cesar salad, baked ham and fresh fruit.

Inflated the amounts of all ingredients except the number of eggs, included onions and mushrooms sautéed in scant amount of sausage  fat.  Cooked dish  for much longer than recipe said, and 8 hearty eaters licked their plates. Perfect.

Love this recipe, and followed it with only minor changes due to taste and what I had on hand. Fresh broccoli, partially cooked in water; bacon instead of sausage (1 lb. rather than 1/2), cut into pieces before adding to mix; chopped onions pre-cooked with the bacon; a little fresh grated parmesan sprinkled on top before baking; 13x9" baking dish instead of smaller pan I don't happen to have. 

This cooked more quickly due to larger baking dish, had a beautiful color presentation, and is delicious left over as well. Will definitely make this again and again!

This is delicious, however I followed what another reviewer did and substituted mozzarella cheese and sour cream and left out the ricotta, milk, & cheddar.  Also sprinkled parmigiana cheese on top.  My son and I both enjoyed it.  I'll make it again but will plan ahead and have ricotta on hand.

Delicious! I substituted sour cream for the ricotta, added a couple extra eggs, used a 16 oz bag of broccoli and doubled the sausage. I mixed everything together instead of dividing it out. I used 4 roma tomatoes and sliced those to layer across the top. Then I sprinkled shredded mozzarella across the top. It was fantastic.

I've made this recipe many times since I first saw it on Allrecipes back in 2006.  It has been a hit with my family every Christmas day for breakfast.  I sometimes add diced ham and bacon.  You can experiment with lots of tasty veggies and meats also.  Brought it to work for a holiday brunch and got lots of raves from my coworkers.  Many wanted the recipe so of course  I did share with them.  Great recipe LK.  Again, thanks for sharing!

This will now be my go-to recipe for brunches! So delicious, perfectly moist but not soggy, lots of flavor, so easy. I used sour cream instead of ricotta, garlic salt, and I omitted the tomatoes. Baked 35 min covered and probably another 25 to 30 uncovered. Tip: I just put the broccoli in frozen!

This is a great basic recipe that you may add all sorts of goodness to.  Gluten free.  AND, the best part is that you can put it together ahead of time (like the night before), and bake it when you need it!

Delicious! I didnt have sausage on hand, but instead used cubed ham, which I knew would go great with the broccoli and cheese. I also did not have ricotta, so I used feta cheese. It was awesome. My husband, who isnt big on eggs, loved it and asked me to make it again for him to take to work. This recipe is very versatile, and you can make to your liking using all types of ingredients. We are doing low carb, so this was a hit. Thanks for sharing!

I made some adjustments out of necessity, but it turned out awesome! I used 2 eggs and the equivalent of 6 egg whites, skim milk, some mushrooms, steamed broccoli, and turkey bacon (only 4 strips) instead of sausage. Also, I only had 1c cheddar, so used gruyere for the rest. I do think I cooked it a little longer than the recipe called for. It was a super easy dish and goes a long way, even though everyone had seconds and my husband has been picking at it in between meals. I'm not a giant "egg" person, but have to say, this was a GREAT dish and the whole family loved it (down to my 23 month old). Definitely give it a try and don't be afraid to mix it up!!

followed others suggestions-used crescent rolls as a crust, added tomatoes and used asparagus instead of broccoli.  I also used egg beaters instead of eggs and turkey sausage.  Everyone said "this is a keeper!!"  It did take a bit longer to cook and set up.  But well worth the wait!!

Really good way to use up some broccoli. I added onions, mushrooms and peppers in with the sausage and sauteed it. I used fresh broccoli and should have sauteed it as well. Overall good taste and easy to make.

I made this with and without the sausage. BOTH WERE AWESOME. The changes I made in the recipe were, fresh par-steamed brocolli, coursely cut black olives. I added 1/3 C fresh parmesan. 2 cloves minced garlic. I used ground sea salt. I tossed cut up roma's in a hefty T of Johnny's Garlic Spread seasoning, added about 8 dashes of Tobasco sauce and few hefty dashes of Mrs. Dash seasoning. THIS WAS A HUGE HIT with our Christmas morning brunch. I would make it again. LOVED IT. Freezes well.

I wasn't blown away by this.  It was quite tasty and the kids and I are glad we tried it.  Probably won't make again.  Nothing wrong with it ... just not a keeper.  Oh, and I wouldn't add the extra salt.

I was so excited about this recipe, but was not impressed in the end... spent 3 days choking down leftovers after haivng a dinner party of 20! I added extra tomatoes on top and expanded the recipe slightly to fill a 9x13, but there really wasn't much flavor, and the ricotta cheese gave it a grainy texture. If I were to make it again I would use cottage cheese instead of ricotta, leave out the sausage as that flavor didn't compliment the broccoli and tomato, and maybe add more veggies and savory spices.

I sprayed the pan with PAM so none of the egg would stick, and added a little onion & garlic powder for flavor (personal preference).

This is a great basic recipe to use for a breakfast casserole... the flavor wasn't to die for, but it was filling and endless combinations are possible. I used eggbeaters and fat free cottage cheese in place of the ricotta... only used half the cheese and that was plenty.

Sorry.  This recipe was edible, but I will not make it again.  There are to many brunch casseroles that we like better.

I also added a crust made from refrig. croissants, and sauteed mushrooms.  Skipped the tomatoes on top since some in my family don't like tomatoes. Great - thanks!

I'm giving this a four only because I tweaked the recipe slightly. This was fantastic!  I used chicken chorizo instead of pork sausage, added an extra half cup of cheese and an onion and it was delicious. I increased the recipe by 50% and it took about 75 minutes to cook. It presents beautifully and I received many compliments. Just finished up the leftovers for lunch, so I can confirm that it reheats well.

I made this recipe for a breakfast pot luck and it was a hit!  I used 16 oz of sausage, fresh broccoli, and covered the top in tomatoes.  Everyone wanted the recipe!  This casserole is GREAT!

Very, very good! Like others suggested, I cooked about 5 minutes longer than listed. This is one of those dangerous recipes that you'll eat too much of. YUM!

This was just OK... I believe this recipe could use a lot more flavor- it was very bland. I guess I just think this recipe lacks so much that I wouldn't waste my money to make it again

A tasty recipe for when you want something different to eat.  I just made this for dinner because I didn't know what I wanted and it turned out great.  I didn't use the ricotta cheese (didn't have any.  Next time I will add a bell pepper for some extra flavor, but even without, it tastes yummy!

Excellent dish--served 2 for 8 people. All gone,
gone and many compliments received.  I did add extra egg,onions,and mushrooms. I also used Oriental stir fry veggies to one of them. This is a must keeper. Served it with fresh fruit, salad and biscuits, sausage links, bacon, and muffins. So glad I found this receipe,passed it on.
Thanks again

My family thought that it was really good, but I thought that it was just OK.  I should have cooked it longer because is was really runny and that grossed me out.  I think that I would have liked it better if it was cooked all the way through.

This was very simple to make.  I made it for my in-laws on Christmas morning and got rave reviews from everyone.  I substituted ham for the sausage.
