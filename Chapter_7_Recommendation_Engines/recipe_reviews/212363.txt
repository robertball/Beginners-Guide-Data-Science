As written, the ingredients are good, but with the addition of chopped fresh tomatoes, diced onions, ground turmeric, and a few handfuls of diced zucchini it becomes spectacular!  Also, I like to cook my spices (including curry leaves) in the hot oil first, then add the onion, chilis, garlic, and ginger, cook a bit,  then add the tomatoes and zucchini and cook until the oil begins to separate. Toss in the moong beans, the water/broth, bring to a boil and then simmer until the beans are soft. Add in the spinach and some lemon juice and cook until spinach is wilted, a minute or so. Garnish with chopped cilantro. Delish!

I made something similar after talking to my indian friend. I used serrano peppers instead of chile and I couln't find the curry leaves and didn't want the asafoetida. But very good and will make again my way. I served it over basmati rice and ghee.

This was very good and my first time ever eating lentils. I added some diced tomato, onion, and garlic. We ate it over rice. My husband brought out some Ritz crackers and it was really really good on crackers. Might be something I even make for a appitizer.

The spinach really makes these otherwise dull beans extraordinary.  The spices are well balanced but who doesn't want more curry leaves?  And when she says a "pinch" of hing/asafoetida, she means it.  We found out the hard way.

We like to eat this over rice with the Simple Whole Roasted Chicken 
By: INDRIANI on this site. 

I used a handful of frozen spinach and panch phoron (Bengali 5 spice mix) instead of the individual spices. Didnt use the ginger, curry leaves, nor red chile (it was plenty hot using the green chili). I used mustard oil instead of ghee, since we like the taste. I suggest to adjust water to the thickness desired (prior to adding the whole tempered spices). Also for us a half recipe is more than enough.

I added onions, garlic and tomatoes. Also added lemon juice at the end and some cilantro.
Made a scrumptious meal with flat bread.
