This dish is outstanding! I had some leftover grilled chicken and some garbanzo beans, so I added those.  I used extra sharp cheddar and asiago cheese, and did not add butter to the bread crumbs. This dish can be modified anyway you like it, with meat, other veggies, whatever. Totally recommend this dish!

I made this recipe as a stand-in for the traditional mushroom soup / mayo recipe because I wanted to halve the recipe and didn't want a half-can of mushroom soup left over.  I am not typically a cook who likes to use canned soups, but for this casserole, I'll go back to my regular recipe.  This recipe was OK but lacked flavor of my regular casserole and I followed these instructions and ingredients to a T except for halving the ingredients.  The left-overs did not improve flavors and in fact it was worse the next day. The bechemel which normally makes a great cheese sauce turned glutinous resulting in a very poor texture...particularly for the leftovers.

loved this recipe. I added  a  pound of fresh asparagus  to  2  cups of  frozen broccoli  {I had these 2  on hand.] Since I used half the amount of veggies, I cut the milk in half also. I always thicken with corn starch , I  used that instead of flour. Just add and stir about 1/2 cup corn starch into  a cup of cold milk and gradually add this to heated milk, then add to pan  of  browned veggies as directed... gradually , and continually stirring.
 We love garlic so , I used garlic salt for regular salt and I used fresh parmesan to mix with the cheddar. I also added to the amount of cheese. What can I say...we love cheese, next time I'll cut back on the cheese.

I made a keto-friendly version substituting 2 parts heavy cream and 1 part kefir for the milk, konjac root powder for the flour, and bacon bits for the bread crumbs. It was amazing!

Was totally pleased by this recipe. I only tweaked it lightly...used Orange Bell Pepper instead of Red (because that's what I had), Panko bread crumbs vs what was mentioned and only used Cheddar & Parmesan cheese. Its so light and creamy. Could turn this into a complete dinner by adding chicken.

I added about a cup of leftover pork from andys-spicy-green-chili-pork and the juices that were with it to make it a complete meal. We loved it. Reheated the leftovers in the oven a couple of days later, and we found it even tastier. I'd probably add chicken next time since I'm more likely to have that on hand.

I love this recipe but made some changes out of necessity.  I didn't have any peppers, so I doubled the mushrooms. I used whole wheat flour and added toasted pecans and cooked rice.  Spice it up with Tobasco or Sriracha.  Yum!

I was somewhat skeptical making this but followed the instructions completely. After adding the milk I smelled it and well it smelled like milk and a hint of the veggies. The finished baking product was as expected. My honey who eats enough for 3 people at night ate all of 2 bites. This I think could be a great recipe but it needs a lot of work on the spices. Iâ€™m gonna keep looking but thank you for sharing.

I added 1/8 t. garlic powder and only needed to bake for 25 minutes.  Next time I will add another 1/4 c. milk (1-3/4 c) as I felt it could have used it. I was amazed at how much water I got out of the broccoli with the paper towels.   This would also be good to add a little cooked ground turkey or chicken.
