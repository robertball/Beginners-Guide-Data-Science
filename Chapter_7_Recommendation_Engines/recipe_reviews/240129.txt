This was delicious--next time I will cook the ground beef separately--pain in the rear to drain--didn't have tomato sauce so I used enchilada sauce--will definitely make again

Good flavor and texture. I might add half the mixture next time, then the tortillas and cheese, instead of just covering the bottom of the pan. To up the nutrition factors, I did add one very small sweet potato (diced),  one cup of frozen corn, one can of petite diced tomatoes (not drained), and one can of  black beans, rinsed and drained.  I know that sounds like a lot, but worked for me.

Loved this recipe! My husband raved about this dish. It was easy to make and even better the next day. I too cooked the hamburger first drained it set aside then added it back to the sautéed onions and garlic. (No peppers for me). So much easier.

I cut back on the cheese but it was still really good. I didn’t have tomato sauce so I watered down some tomato paste.

I left out the hot spices because my kiddo doesn't like anything even vaguely spicy. It was still really tasty.

I added olives tomatoes and green onions once it came out of the oven and it was awesome.
