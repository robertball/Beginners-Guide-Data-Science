Although soy sauce and tamari [tuh-MAHR-ee] are both made from fermented soybeans, Japanese tamari is thicker, darker, and richer than its counterpart. Think of it as the kinder, gentler (and less salty) soy sauce. It has a more complex, smooth flavor compared to the sometimes harsh, overwhelming bite of a salty soy sauce.

We did use soy sauce as we were unable to find the tamari here. Too salty and too spicy.

I didn't have tamari sauce nor was I going to run out and buy some. I used soy sauce instead. Nevertheless these were good although next time I will add about a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne to add another dimension.

AMAZING! These are so delicious! I used reduced sodium soy sauce and only a teaspoon (for health reasons), but if you like your seeds salty then you probably want to use the full amount recommended. They are not hot spicy, just flavorful. These are a new favorite.

On a quest to get more pumpkin seeds into DH's diet, we tried several. This was our favorite. Did use Tamari. We loved it. I might make a change somewhere down the road, (maybe a little more heat), just my style to play with a recipe - but this is excellent just the way it is.
