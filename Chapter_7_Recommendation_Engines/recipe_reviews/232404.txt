I'm not a fan of spicy so I changed from habanero to jalapeno but I'm not sure I put enough in since hubs and I didn't think it was spicy at all. I also used my bread machine for this which ground up the cheese and peppers which I knew would happen but I thought it might be okay. This recipe though does seem to need the pieces of pepper rosemary and cheese in it so I'll add it at the fruit and nut beep next time or use the KA mixer. I think I'll also double the jalapeno so we can taste it. I baked in the oven but at 350 for 40 minutes. Since I modified it not the submitter's fault that it turned out different than intended and this turned out really well even with the modifications so it's a good bread just maybe needs more modifications to work with what we'd prefer here. Thanks for the recipe!

I prepared it as written and it turned out great! Next time though I will double the habaneros and rosemary to make the flavors more pronounced.

Very good bread recipe.  I doubled the Habanero, cheddar & rosemary. It is awesome eaten alone or toasted and it makes a yummy grilled cheese too. You can make it another way....
I added all dry ingredients to my mixer,  and added the yeast to the water that was at 110° - 115° mixed it all together and let rise per the directions.

Absolutely enjoyed this bread when I made the first time per the recipe. Absolutely LOVED this bread the second time with double the habenero (5oz precut) and cheddar! It's a keeper!
