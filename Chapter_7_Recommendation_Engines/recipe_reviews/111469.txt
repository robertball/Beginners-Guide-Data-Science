Just way too much cinnamon taste for me... (or my family) Good base, but the cinnamon over-powered everything else.

Best Bresslin' Pasta Casserole Haiku: "Cinnamon no-no. I'm convinced it was 'teaspoons.' Otherwise would fail." So I made this as written, except there's no chance that it was supposed to call for that much cinnamon, so I reduced it to 1/2 tsp., and honestly, was OK w/ it. I did; however, find myself irritated w/ the spaghetti noodle inclusion and would've preferred all elbows instead. Fairly tasty casserole, but probably not one that I'd make again.

I would recommend leaving out the cinnamon. We liked it other than that. Our family likes spicy food, I do reccomend adding some chili powder, crushed red peppers, or anything with a kick to it.
