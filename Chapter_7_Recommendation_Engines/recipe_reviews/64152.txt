We all loved this recipe. Since I have never seen pasteurized egg in the grocery store, I mixed 2 eggs with 1/2 cup of the icing sugar and cooked it over the stove until very hot, then added it to the other hard sauce ingredients. It all turned out great - definitely a keeper!

The pudding (cake) is superb and would rate 5 stars but the icing or hard sauce could do better without the eggs.  In any event the sauce is not as good as traditional hard sauce and I give it 3 stars.

1.29.17  Followed the cake portion of this recipe to the letter, baked in an 8x8 pan, and ended up with an awesome cake.  Super tender and moist, and the blueberries just pop with every bite.  The amount of the hard sauce seemed excessive to me, since I knew that we simply would be drizzling it on the top, so I cut the sauce amounts in half, used Egg Beaters® for the pasteurized egg,s cutting back just a bit on that, and even reduced the amount of the confectioners’ sugar a little.  Ended up with a very, very good dessert which I wouldn’t hesitate to serve to company.

I was expecting more of a pudding than a cake but, it was a very moist good tasting cake. The hard sauce was more like frosting and too sweet. Good, but didn't meet my expectations.
