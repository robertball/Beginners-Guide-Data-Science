I know nothing of Paleo diet, but for a healthy alternative for myself...amazing. I honestly can tell you, this never made it to the frig to siffen for frosting. The pudding like consistancy I found to be quite pleasing as well as the nip of bitterness from the cocoa...I love it when I can use avocados in another way and put a twist on something. And this is absolutely wonderful. For myself, I used a honey alternative, to cut down the sugar but with the same taste as honey. Hands down, if I want something sweet late night, I'm going for this. It was soo simple and easy to make as well as the overall thickness, smoothness and the easy of throwing a few ingredients in a little food processor. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!! And if you like a little nip of bitter chocolate, you will love this. It wasn't overly powerful and it wasn't milky sweet, to me, it was simply just right.

This was interesting. I had seen it under the new recipes today, with other healthy recipes and decided to try it. It was like a thick slightly sticky pudding in texture and kind of tasted like bittersweet chocolate. This is definitely not sweet like one would think of frosting made with butter and powdered sugar. If I was on the paleo diet, I would be satisfied with this on yellow cupcake. Assuming, there is some type of paleo version of a cupcake. I made 1/2 recipe, to try it, and got about little over a 1/2 cup.

I think this is such a neat way to make frosting while using healthier fats. When I made the recipe as is, there was a bit of bitter aftertaste that was just too strong for our tastes (plus I was trying to get this by 12 seven year olds for a birthday party and it did not pass my son's initial taste test). SO I added some powdered sugar until the bitterness was covered and voila! The cupcakes with this frosting were the hit of the party (we also had regular cupcakes with buttercream frosting available). The extra powdered sugar does not make this frosting extra healthier by any means but it was definitely very good. Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my goodness this is AMAZING! I only had dark cocoa powder and pure vanilla (not extract) so those are the only substitutes, if you could call it that, that I made to this recipe. I don't think I'll EVER make chocolate frosting any other way again. I LOVED THIS! And so did all of my Crossfit friends this morning!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe - I'll never have to feel guilty about 'cheating' again.

In my search for a chocolate frosting with better fats than butter and cream cheese, I found this!  It is excellent!  It tastes, looks, and feels very much like chocolate pudding at first.  Once it has been in the fridge for a day or so, it get's closer to the "frosting" consistency.

One thing going for it.  It is very nice, creamy, smooth... but, I don't care for the taste.  I think if I was to ever try this again, I'd use bananas in place of the avocado.  Also, butter or crisco in place of the coconut oil.  A 14 oz. jar cost over $12.00, a 16 oz pkg of butter is from $2.00 to $4.00, and you would get a little flavor in there too.  I like to cook more for flavor than looks, I won't make this one again.

This recipe is phenomenal!  I just made it for my dad who hasn't had cake in probably five years.  He was thrilled!  It's easy to make, tastes delicious (it has a nice dark chocolatey flavor), and it totally passed the kids' palate test!

Pleasantly surprising! This is a smooth, creamy, rich frosting that doesn't overpower with sweetness. Definitely not a super-sweet frosting that would appeal to younger tastes, this is an adult-friendly frosting and goes great with a dark chocolate cake. This frosting stays moist and is great for dry cakes (like many gluten-free cakes). I highly recommend trying this.

Absolutely decadent! I added two packs of stevia because I thought it was a bit bitter at first, but this is amazing. It's great alone or on cake as frosting!

I found this recipe looking for a healthy alternative frosting, just knowing that I wouldn't find one. I seriously had my doubts about it but decided what the heck, the worse thing that could happen is that I'd toss it and say that I'd tried. Well, much to my surprise, it is AMAZING! I didn't want to lick the spoon, I was kind of scared to, thinking it would just taste like avocado. Well, I don't taste any of it, just the sweet goodness of chocolate! It was all I could do to stop myself from eating the whole batch!

I made half a batch, used Maple Syrup in place of the honey, added a heaping tsp of espresso powder. I used frozen avocado halves (bought at Costco), let them come to room temperature & they worked perfect. Other than that I followed the recipe as written.

I am very picky and this definitely passed my taste test! I have a chocolate cake cooling and will add this frosting, top it with unsweetened coconut & chopped cashew & almonds! I can hardly stand the wait!!! 

Thanks for the recipe! Any of you who have doubts, try it! You may be pleasantly surprised as I was!

Wonderful regardless of whether or not you are on the paleo diet. I was looking for a frosting recipe that didn't include shortening (gross) or butter (lactose intolerant). I followed the recipe exactly and am quite pleased.

After I made 1 adjustment of adding 2 dropperfuls of vanilla stevia this frosting was PERFECT and delicious!!!!  Can't believe how good it is.  Love the consistency.  I just can't believe it's avocados.  So, so good.

This recipe as stated is a little bitter, however I just needed it be vegan, not paleo, so I added some powdered sugar and it was AMAZING! Truly rocked my world! Used it on vanilla vegan cupcakes and topped with coconut. Yum. Yum. Yum. I'm giving it 4 stars only because I did want to add sugar to it.

Made this for dessert to get rid of some avocados that were on their way out. Family absolutely loved it, but because it's so rich as a pudding we could only eat a few spoonfuls. We all loved the coconut flavor, but agreed it was a little too chocolatey, so when I make it again I will back off the cocoa a little bit. Will definitely make it again though!

This recipe is great!  I was going crazy with boredom on a raw food cleanse, and this saved me :o).  I would thin it with some unsweetened vanilla almond milk, sprinkle with cashews, and dip apple slices in it.  Delish!! I finished the cleanse months ago, but still love making this recipe.

I made this for a birthday cake for my 2 year old granddaughter with dairy allergies. I added powdered sugar to it as suggested by another reviewer to thicken it for spreading and to improve the taste. I didn’t like it but the other guests thought it was good and my granddaughter loved it. If I make it again I will use 1 avacado and 1 banana as suggested by another reviewer.

This turned out so good! only change I made was to use canola oil instead of coconut oil because my husband is allergic to coconut. I used this to top chocolate zucchini cupcakes (from recipe also on this site) and we both loved it! He isn't even usually one for "healthified"  food, but gave it his approval. Will definitely make again!

I didn't make any changes. My daughter who has celiacs absolutely loved it (maybe a little too much)! Me and my husband also enjoyed it! It's my new go to frosting for anything I bake that warrants frosting!

This is a must for anyone on Paleo! So rich and creamy, and well worth the time. I used an immersion blender and it worked just fine.

Amazingly delicious for a non-vegan. And so easy. Here are my changes: I substituted agave nectar for the honey, added 1/4 cup of powdered sugar, and decreased salt to 1/4 teaspoon to make it even more palatable for a large crowd. Try this recipe!

I really liked this but as is this was not sweet enough. 
The consistency was good but having made a half batch it was not blending well and had to keep scraping the sides to get it to combine. I ended up adding about 2 tablespoons more honey, 2 tablespoons maple syrup and a little package of stevia. I also loosened it up with about a quarter cup of cashew milk.  The result was a hit with my two young children, landing somewhere between icing and pudding.   One ate it with a spoon, the other asked for it in an ice cream cone and I dipped pretzels in it.  Next time I will try adding a frozen banana before the extra sweetners.

After reading all the great reviews I was so excited to try this for a paleo treat.  I followed the recipe exactly, but we couldn't even eat it.  It had a good consistency and LOOKED wonderful, but had a weird taste and even worse aftertaste.

Yes this recipe is good and to my surprise I could not taste the avocados however it should say to use really ripe avocados because I did not and my frosting came out lumpy no matter how how many times I pulsed it in food processor.I will try this one again though!

I can't even describe how delicious this is!  By itself, you can taste the avocado, but it is not overpowering and still delicious - a great, healthy dessert.  Used as a frosting, it tastes just like regular frosting and is AMAZING.  I topped the Amazing Chocolate Quinoa Cake and the Gluten Free Chickpea Cupcakes with this frosting (both from this site) and couldn't stop eating.  I'm going to try making a big batch and freezing for later, since avocados and gauc freeze so well.  I don't feel guilty giving my 2 yr old "frosting" for breakfast with this recipe!

I made this frosting for a wacky cake (even though the wacky cake is not a Paleo recipe) and thought it was very good. It's not real sweet like other frostings but the texture was great. When eating with cake you hardly notice the difference, at least my DH did not.
