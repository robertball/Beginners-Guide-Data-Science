Holy Moses, this is soooo good! I thought the lime and ginger sounded tasty, so I gave it a whirl. It is as easy as it looked!
I added half a red onion, chopped,  to the mixture. I also used half and half instead(its all I had). I garnished it with cilantro.
So full of flavor that I didn't need to add salt!
YUM!

This is a great and simple soup. It's easy to make, and tastes delicious. The ginger is just the right amount so it makes it very flavorful, but it isn't overpowering.   I added a little extra water (about 1 cup) just to cover the potatoes (I probably had more than the called for amount). Its a great smooth texture and not too thick. Really good, especially if you love sweet potatoes!

This recipe was very good. I thought it was going to be very bland on the other hand it was very good. I advise not to use a whole lime for the recipe but other than that it was awsome with some crusty bread!

This soup was delicious. The ginger and lime gave it a surprising kick.  Add only as much milk as to your taste, then add some cracked black pepper.

This was awful, what a waste of ingredients.  The lime and ginger taste were overpowering, especially the lime.

It was very simple and very tasty. The only complaint I heard was that it looked like baby food.  I'm sure that could be fixed with better presentation.  A little garnish would help.   Also, it wasn't really clear in the directions if I should blend the potatoes and lime alone or with the stock.  I used just enough water to cover the potatoes.  I was worried it would be to runny with all the stock but it was perfect.    I still added a little milk at the end.   Please make it more clear next time for dummies like me.    Thanks.

I thought this recipe really lacked flavor.  I tried to spice it up by using pepper, nutmeg and cinnamon.   Didn't work.  I wouldn't bother with this one again.

This is a great soup. Very simple and tasty. I would add a little bit of spice though, if you don't it can come out a little bland. Spice it to your taste! Great on rainy days :)

I have never given a recipe a bad review, but this one was quite disappointing.  The only upside is that it's very easy to make.  The taste is very bland, and the texture as well as the appearance resemble baby food.  I tried adding extra chicken stock, salt and pepper, and it still tastes like liquified sweet potatoes.  Unless you absolutely LOVE plain old sweet potatoes, I would steer clear of this recipe.

At first I really liked this dish. I used chicken stock and slightly less milk. My boyfriend didn't finish his bowl because it was "too lime-y" I thought it was great, but the next day when I attempted to have it for lunch, the acidity made it taste too sour and taste rancid. I like how simple it is, but next time I will find another way to use up the leftover sweet potatoes. If you are going to make this dish, make sure your family likes sweet potatoes and make sure you don't have any leftovers.

I cut the recipe down, used veggie stock. Added canned milk and squirted lime on it in the bowl. This is really good.

This is a very good base soup to start with.  I added a whole white potato, finely mined 1/2 onion, celery and carrots  along with the sweet potatoes because I like it.  I won't give a recipe a low score after I made changes.  I don't think that's fair.

So simple and so good! Made a half batch and included an onion, and substituted mushroom stock cube (that's what was on hand) and oat milk. And ACV for lime juice. So, so tasty!

My mom made a similar soup while I was visiting and liked it so much I wanted to make some later.  This recipe is pretty close to it.  I add sour cream and nutmeg as a garnish.  Very good!

Used 3 Medium sized sweet potatoes and half of a large lime then used half a tablespoon of powdered ginger and it was absolutely amazing and hard to stop eating! I garnished with cilantro and sprinkled a dry seasoned powdered shaker cheese on top and it was heavenly. Perfect in every way!

First, I added 3 peeled, hopped pink lady apples along with the potatoes and ginger in step 1. The sweetness really balances out the ginger and it's delicious.

Second, I seasoned it while it was boiling with fresh ground black pepper and a pinch of sea salt.

Third, I used a pint of heavy whipping cream instead of milk in step 2. This gave it the "heft" of a hearty adult soup rather than the runniness of baby food.

Also, be sure not to overblend it with the blender or food processor. I left some chunks in mine and it eats way heartier than a soupy soup. In step 1 you might have to boil it uncovered for longer than 30 minutes in order for the liquid to boil off and to let the potatoes and apples really absorb the flavors. I let mine boil for about 90 minutes, until the liquid covered only about half of the potatoes. Then I put it in the blender.

Just some thoughts on how to improve the recipe, because I really like it!

I would give my version a 4.5, but half stars aren't allowed. Also, next time I make this I might use more apples, or maybe mix in some apple cider during the boiling process.

Really nice! I wanted to keep the soup as natural as possible so just used water instead of stock and, as I'm not overly fond of ginger, I only used a dessert spoon rather than the suggested tablespoon. I added a little salt and pepper too. No lime as I didn't have any. After the potatoes had been boiling for around 25 mins I strained them, keeping the liquid, and then mashed them. Then, I added the liquid in stages alternating with milk until I got the desired consistency. Really yummy and just the right amount of spice for me! Would certainly make again.
