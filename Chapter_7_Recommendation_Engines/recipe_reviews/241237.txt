These were good but there seems to be something missing. I used the juice of 1 lime, Tapatio instead of habanero sauce, a lot more Worcesrershire and a few dashes of Maggi Sauce. Instead of making the rimming spice blend I used Tajin.

To start, you will need spicy Clamato juice. Then use key limes, salt and pepper. Then add worcesterchire sauce and tapatio or tabasco. Whatever you may prefer. Then add Tajin. Mix them all up and put some lime around the rim with Tajin instead of salt. Add cubes and whatever Mexican beer you prefer and wallah! Let me know what you guys think and good luck.

Clamato us a must in any michelada. Ice is not necessary, just make sure everything is cold. This can easily be adapted to suit your taste.
