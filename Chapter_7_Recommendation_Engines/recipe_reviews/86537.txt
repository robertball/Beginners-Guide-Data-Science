I went to Allrecipes to find a coleslaw recipe without vinegar. This one sounded perfect. I just made it and it is sitting in the fridge as I write this. 
As usual, I changed it a little. First, it was too mayonaissey (I don't think that's a word), so I used 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream. I also eliminated the celery seed and green onions as I just wanted a simple, sweet coleslaw. This is a great recipe. Thanks for sharing Lynne

Good Recipe - but WAY to much celery seed.  I cut it back to 1 teaspoon.  Otherwise good.

I LOVE this recipe.  My husband and I are huge fans of honey, and we've been using it in place of refined sugar as much as possible.  The honey in this recipe gives it that little something extra that makes it better than any other coleslaw I've ever had.  I needed to use up half of a bag of coleslaw mix I had left over from another recipe, so I used the ingredients I had on hand to make the recipe.  I used red wine vinegar, and didn't add the celery seed or onion just because I didn't have them.

I made this recipe up following it exactly, except I didn't have a coleslaw mix, so I used cabbage which I chopped, carrots, radishes, and raab. For the raab, don't use the tough stems.
We found it was almost too sweet for our tastes, so will use less honey next time. The 1 Tablespoon of celery seed was fine. It didn't overpower the dish. Also used green onions as stated in recipe. I served this atop halibut cheeks that had been baked in a little olive oil, with the juice of one Meyer's lemon, with salt and pepper. Then I put the fish and slaw in between warmed hamburger buns for fish sandwiches. Delicious! We had enough to just serve the rest of the salad along side.

I like the mix of mayo and honey.  I also cut way back on the celery seed, and had to add a tablespoon or so of sugar to further cut the mayo taste and add to the sweetness.  I will make it again

4 Tbl of celery seeds is way too much! I only used 1 tsp. Also it's a bit heavy on the mayo. Just add in what you need. I only used a little over a cup total. I felt it was lacking on the ZIP so I added in 2 Tbl. apple cider vinegar and 1/2 c. of well drained crushed pineapple. After the adjustments...this slaw went great w/ my rootbeer bbq pork sliders ;)

Excellent coleslaw recipe. The green onions and honey both add a good flavor. I'm on a diet so I used half the dressing recipe and it was enough. I also used light mayonnaise.

Very good recipe love using the honey in place of sugar I used some dehydrated onion. Put right into the dressing worked great. I don't always have green onion on hand. Thanks for the recipe. I did back of on the amount of honey so it would not be too sweet.

Delicious! I realized as I was making the sauce for this slaw that there was no vinegar or acid and was tempted to add some....but did not as I was curious to try as is....it didnt need it! This was an amazing slaw that was creamy and slightly sweet and kept people coming back for more. I used a lil over a cup of low fat mayo, reduced the honey to 1/4c and decreased the celery seed way down to maybe a lil over 1/2tblspn. I also really like the addition of the green onions in this slaw. Made this the day before serving and served with Amazing Simple Pulled Pork Sandwiches by IRISHGINA74....and fantastic combo. Thanks!

I love honey but quantity given is too much.  I also used 1/4 cup plain yoghurt,well blended together with a fork.  Red vinegar is a nice touch.  There are as many recipes for slaw as there are for potato salad!

Very simple and easy to make. I LOVE coleslaw and this is very tasty! I too adjusted the amount of celery seed to 1 1/2 teaspoons and added 2 teaspoons of sugar. I might cut back on the amount of onions next time to 1/2 of a bunch. I am serving it with our spare ribs at dinner tonight. I like to let salads sit and rest in the fridge to enhance the blended flavors.

We enjoyed this very much.  I added a bit less mayo and added some shredded carrots for some color and it was yummy. Will make again for sure! Thanks for the recipe.

I love this coleslaw! I tried it because it does not have vinegar in it- since my husband doenst like vinegar in things. It was quick and easy... and very refreshing- it was great with hamburgers on the grill. I also served it with pulled pork sandwiches!

I think that this recipe is just ok.  I did like the mayo and honey flavor better than just the sugary flavor of regular coleslaws but this recipe was very sweet and needed less honey.  I did have to add vinegar to cut the sweet flavor a bit and that helped.

This was ok. Out of several slaws I made on evening for a fish fry this was by far the least favorite all around. Like I said it was just ok for a slaw that was a bit different from the usual slaws you get at restaurants. There was plenty left over and we were able to ship it home with one of our single guy friends.

Great recipe!  We aren't mayo eaters in this house, so substituted Miracle Whip.  Still had a great flavor with a little zip.  Loved that this recipe calls for honey instead of a ton of white sugar!  Didn't care for the onions in the slaw, but it could've been because mine we a little strong.  Next time I'll leave them out!  Overall a terrific recipe that I will use again!

I used this dressing recipe and added about 1/4 cup of vinegar after I tasted it, since the dressing seemed a tad bland.  Vinegar added the zip it needed, but this was good on its own too.  I let it sit in the fridge about 1 hour before supper and it was very tasty!  I used chinese cabbage, grated carrot, broccoli, and white onion chopped fine.

The beauty of this recipe is the speed with which it can be thrown together.  My store-bought bottled cole slaw dressing was outdated, so I needed a quick dressing to go with the shredded cole slaw mix I bought.  This recipe filled that role perfectly.  We ate it warm and did not have green onions on hand.  With those additions called for in the recipe, it would--no doubt--have been even better.

Just made this.  Omitted celery seed and onion since I didn't have them.  My husband loves slaw but not a big fan of mayo so we'll see what he says.  As for me I loved it.

This recipe is great! I am usually not a big fan of coleslaw, but my dad asked me to make some. Everyone loved this and keep asking me to make more.
