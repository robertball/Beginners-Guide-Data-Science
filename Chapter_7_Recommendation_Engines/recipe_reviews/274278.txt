These turned out great and were a nice change. I stuck the patties in the freezer for 30 minutes prior to grilling to firm them up. The only change I made is that I used canned pineapple rings instead of fresh because I was too lazy to cut up a fresh one. Canned worked fine too. Do plan on more breadcrumb than the recipe calls for. I started with 1/4 cup but had to keep adding. If I had to guess, I'd say I used about 1/2 cup. Overall great recipe and one that is sure to please on your next cookout.
