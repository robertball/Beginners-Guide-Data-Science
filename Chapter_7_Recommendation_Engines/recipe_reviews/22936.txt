I like this recipie, but made a few changes as suggested by others...  Instead of microwaving and then boiling, I cut in half, scooped out seeds and baked in oven halved side down until soft.  Blended in a blender to make smooth puree.  Used a 1/2 C Splenda, added 1tsp Cinnamon and 1/2tsp Nutmeg.  For a topping I used 1/4C brown sugar, 1/8C butter and 2C Honey Bunches of Oats cereal (as suggested by another to use cornflakes, I used what I had on hand and loved the result).  Will definately make again.

I love butternut squash and this is a great recipe to get started with.  I've made this recipe many times and have made many modifications.  First of all, I like to roast the squash rather than boiling it.  I just cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, and roast it at 375 for 45 min-1 hour.  It is easier to just scoop out the cooked sqaush than peel the skin off the little chunks.  This does take longer, but in my opinion, it is much easier.  I also add cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger which adds a nice flavor.  The last thing that I change is that instead of the suggested topping, I use chopped pecans.

I am a newlywed and havne't done much cooking.  I have prepared this for Thanksgiving ahead of time. I have never cooked butternut squash before so I didn't know that after you cook the squash that you are supposed to scoop the inside out of the "rind".  I found that out after I mashed it up and it was still hard.  I spent a good hour trying to pick the rind out of the mashed squash.  It would be helpful if the reicpe mentioned that step for new cooks!

Big success! This is the first time I've ever cooked any kind of squash. I took other reviewers advice and roasted it cut in half, meat side down. The skin peeled right off. I made the recipe "as is" with the exception of adding a little cinnamon, ginger, and oops, I had it out, but I forgot to add the brown sugar to the topping. Didn't matter though, Everyone raved over it! I read the reviews and I'm so glad I didn't cut back on the sugar. I don't think I would have liked it so much without the full amount of sugar. It's like a pumpkin type of dessert or a Thanksgiving side dish but I served it on a normal weeknight and it was excellent! I definitely suggest that you try the recipe before cutting back unless you need to watch your sugar intake or for personal preferences. Thanks for a delicious recipe! UPDATE- I used the brown sugar in the topping this time and it was way too sweet. I'll make it again w/o the brown sugar in the topping like the first time.

With a few tweaks, this was great!  I split the butternut squash in two, scooped out the seeds, rubbed 1 tablespoon of butter on the insides and placed it cut side down on a cookie sheet.  I baked it at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes until it easily pierced with a knife.  Then I scooped out the orange flesh (toss the skin) and mashed it with 1 1/2 cups of skim milk.  I mixed it together with only 3 tablespoons of butter and all the other ingredients ( I added the beaten eggs last so they wouldn't cook in the mixing bowl.)  I skipped the topping (it was yummy enough already).

A splicing of many of the review-based mods caused this first attempt to use butternut squash a huge success.  I cut in half, scooped out seeds and baked in oven halved side down at 375 for 45 min-1 hour. Used a 1/2 C sugar, added 1tsp Cinnamon and 1/2tsp Nutmeg. Used an 8x8 pan.  For a topping I used 1/4C brown sugar, 1/8C butter and 2C Honey Bunches of Oats cereal.

Great recipe!  I have already made it twice in the last 48 hours because my husband and I are eating it all!  My husband was a professional chef and he proclaimed it fabulous.  He was really impressed.  It tastes even better cold.  I just used brown sugar and butter for the topping and it carmalizes and is wonderful.

This recipe is one of my family's favorites!!! I also add 1 cup chopped pecans to the topping. I was thrilled to find that this year Costco sells butternut squash (already removed from the rind and cubed) in their produce dept.  This cuts the prep time way down.

I don't understand what all the fuss is about.   WAY too sweet for my tastes and I used about 1/2 the sugar that this recipe called for.  If you like yams with little marshmellows at thanksgiving you will like this recipe, I however found it lacking.  It badly needed a savory element.  I ended up drowning in in goat cheese at the table but I would not make this again.  There are too many other good ways to prepare butternut that allow the flavor to stand alone without drowning it in sugar.

This recipe is good, but a bit on the sweet side for me. The second time I made it I cut the sugar in half and used orange extract instead of vanilla...what an interesting flavorful dish THAT was! Highly recommend the orange extract.

I made this recipe with 3/4 cup white sugar and around 1.25-1.33 cup milk per suggestions on the site. Used about 2/3 of a 12 ounce box of Nilla wafers and the topping was as thick as the souffle. This was very sweet, the topping overpowered the squash souffle.  Even the souffle without the topping was very sweet.  I think maybe making it in a 8X8 pan instead of 9X13 would make the souffle a little thicker and more appealing (in the 9X13 pan, the souffle was pretty thin).  That being said, I think, with a little tweaking, this could really be very good.

This IS a delicious recipe and a great alternative for Sweet Potato Casserole.  I slightly tweaked this based on other reviewer's suggestions as follows:  I cut the Squash in half, scooped out the seeds and placed the two halves, cut side down, on a baking sheet.  I baked in a 350 degree oven for 45" (Test for doneness - squash should be soft, but not mushy.) I peeled the squash and cut into cubes & blended them into a puree.  I cut the sugar to a scant 3/4 cup & cut the milk to 3/4 cup.  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon & 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  This will give you a pudding-like texture.  I baked this until it was set in a buttered oval baking dish for approx. 45".)  Instead of the 9 x 13 dish, I used a buttered large oval baking dish (Definitely smaller than the 9 x 13 that this recipe recommends.) For the topping, I used 3/4 stick of butter and added chopped pecans into the cookie crumb/brown sugar mixture.  It was absolutely delicious and I look forward to making this again and again.

Oh my golly!!  This was FABULOUS!!!  I followed the directions on the butternut squash for cooking it, as well as previous reviewers.  I sliced the squash length wise, placed cut side down on a jelly roll pan and baked for approx 45 min.  (it does take longer, but it is easier, and I was able to prepare my other dish while this was baking so it worked out nicely)  Anyway, after it baked, I flipped the squash over and let it set for a little bit so it would cool a bit, and then I removed the skin.  (it was very easy)  I kind of thought that the topping would taste fine with out the vanilla waffers so I just used brown sugar and some butter to make a crumble topping.  It was so good, and it was the very first thing gone!!!  I love when that happens!!!  Everyone was raving about the butternut squash casserole and it is now a requirement that I make it every year from here on out!  Fine with me, b/c ALL of the ingredients (besides the squash itself) are all ingredients that I have on hand at all times.  So it's not only inexpensive, it's actually convenient!  My husband was very against me making this b/c he wanted something he knew he'd love... He took one bite, got out of his seat to come and find me to tell me how AWESOME this was and he couldn't believe he liked it so much... so that says a lot right there!  He loved it enough to stop eating to come and tell me that!  Thank you so much for sharing... this is such a wonderful dish that is a little out of the ordinary!

I've used crushed ginger snaps instead of the vanilla wafers and I like the results much better.  Also the other suggestion to bake instead of boil the squash gives a 'nuttier' layer of flavor.

I had a small (1 lb) butternut squash that I baked in the oven so it would have the most flavor.  As the mixture looked kind of liquidy, I poured it into 7 sprayed custard cups, omitted the topping, and just sprinkled cinnamon on top.  Used 1/2 cup sugar only.  Baked at 350 degrees for 40 mins.  They were delish!  Tasted best warm.  Just tried it again today using carrots (1 cup mashed) instead of butternut squash, sprinkling nutmeg on top instead of cinnamon - these were great, too!  The first time I used the electric mixer, second time the blender and it was more smooth.

Four stars since I managed to get my "picky & fussy" grand-daughter to eat this; however, I found it to be on the sweet side for my liking.  Tip:  To reserve nutrients from squash, microwave cubes of squash in a covered bowl with a smidgeon of water -- also better flavor.

I was looking for a recipe that resembled Kenny Rogers Roasters butternut squash casserole & this one is oh so close & oh so yummy! I think I will cut down the brown sugar next time but it was great! Thank you so much!

Tried this on 2/24/12.  Did make some modifications but only for convenience.  Don't think it affected the results.  Following another reviewer's (Tricky835) lead, I cut the squash in half, removed the seeds and baked it (cut side down) until it was soft.  Used a potato masher instead of a blender and everything came out just great!  Also, I added the cinnamon, nutmeg to the cooked squash. THE surprise of the event was the scrumptiousness of the topping.  This will become a regular in our household.

Tried this exactly as written.  Here are the changes I will make next time: Leave the squash at 3 cups, and use 1/4 all the other ingredients.  Bake the squash for 1 hour, scoop out and mash.  I also added 1 tsp each of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger.  This is very good, but don't think it needs to be that sweet.

OMG...this was delicious. I cut the squash into two lenthwise, removed the seeds and baked in the oven at 350 until tender (about 45 minutes)It is then very easy to scoop out the squash into a bowl.
My butternut squash was large but only made a little over 2 cups cooked squash. I changed the recipes by only adding 2 eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup fat free evap. milk(richer than plain milk)a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. After baking for 45 minutes per recipe, I sprinkled top with brown sugar and chopped pecans. I feel the cookies would have made it way too much like a dessert.
It was perfect. Will be a keeper. Great with ham or turkey.

This is so good. I made this last year and I have just been craving it lately, so I had to just make it again. I follow the recipe exactly except to add the honey bunches of o's cereal. Mostly because in other recipes I have had with wafers they tend to get soggy. Very, very good though. We love it here!

This was so good.  I made this for Thanksgiving Dinner and it was a big hit.  Per the advice of others, I cut down on the sugar by half.  For the topping, I chose not to use the cookies because I didn't want it to taste like a dessert.  I substituted oats combined with chopped pecans, cinnamon and a little flour.  Again, I cut way down on the sugar by half.  I mixed it all with melted butter until crumbly and topped the casserole.

AMAZING!!!  This will be a huge success at this years family Christmas Supper, and I'm sure a new tradion has been created!!  I did as others suggested: cut squash in half then removed the seeds and baked in oven until soft, pureed the scooped out squash and the remaining ingredients in the blender, used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ginger, I didn't put the sweet topping on it I was inspired by the member who used pecans instead - I used almond slices (left over from making Chocolate Almond Bark!).  I doubled the recipe and put in a larger glass baking dish - lowering my oven temp to 380 degrees.

There's a reader suggested to cut the squash in half, scoope the seeds, bake it with flat side down and mash it. That was I did. Perfect.

Then I tried the squash, and it was sweet in nature so I used only 1/4C sugar. If one has sweet tooth, then adjust it accordingly.

I forgot to put the milk and did the rest as directed. TURNED OUT JUST GREAT!

Topping: I eliminated the sugar totally as the wafers already contain some sugar and wafers is already sweet. 

This is the first time I ever made butternut squash.

This was a big hit on Thanksgiving.  We liked it better than the usual sweet potato souffle.  I used 3 pounds of squash and 5 eggs in the filling and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon with the other topping ingredients.  The filling was very thin, but baked up just like a custard.  It really could be served as dessert with whipped cream and pecans.

I thought this recipe was a bit too sweet. It really could have substituted as a dessert! If I was going to make it again, I'd cut some of the sugar out.
The crumb topping was delish! I found it easier to cut the squash in half, roast it cut side down in the oven, then scoop out the insides & mash!

Have made this multiple times and is now a favorite with my family and friends. I too made a few changes - butter instead of margarine, baked instead of boiled squash and Ritz crackers for topping (gives a nice salty/sweet flavor)!

Hubby says this is like pie filling and kids think we're having dessert for dinner! Need I say more? I used 1/2 C sugar, added 1tsp Cinnamon and 1/2tsp Nutmeg for less sweetness, yet still sweet. For the topping, I used what cereal we had on hand: 1 1/2C Cheerios and Raisin Bran (w/o raisins) mixed with  1/4C brown sugar & 1/8C butter.

So delicious! I was skeptical to try this at first - this was also my first time baking with squash. It tastes very similar to sweet potato. I followed the recipe exactly & it came out even better than expected. This is definitely more of a dessert dish, it is very sweet. The only thing I would do differently next time is try to do layers. A layer of squash on bottom, middle layer of brown sugar/cookie mix, another layer of squash & then a top layer of sugar/cookie mix.

I would definitely add spices to this recipe.  I thought it was bland.  Maybe a little nutmeg or/and cinnomon.

Used 1/2 C. brown sugar, 3/4 cup milk, and 2 eggs.  Skipped the topping.  Thanks for the starting point - would have been too sweet for me with a full cup of sugar.

My family went CRAZY for this!  I'd read the reviews, and followed a lot of the recommended mods - baked the squash, and added 1 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. nutmeg, and 1 t. ginger.  For the topping I used corn flakes rather than the cookies.  We weren't crazy about the topping, as the corn flakes got a bit soggy and chewy.    We'll try a different topping component next time, but "next time" will definitely be SOON!  Such a delicious way to feed everyone some nutritious food...

This is lovely. If you're unsure what to make with butternut squash, make this. I made the modifications of using less sugar all around and using honey bunches of oats instead of the wafers (I didn't have any on hand). It's delicious!  Next time I'm going to experiment with maple sugar or honey instead of the brown sugar and adding more spices to this...like cinnamon or nutmeg.

Was really good.. but i did alter the original recipe.  I wanted to make it as a side dish and instinctively knew that 1 cup of sugar would make it more like a dessert.  That being said I used 1/4 cup of sugar (i used sugar in the raw) and only 1 cup of milk (i used unsweetened vanilla almond milk).  This cut back on calories and fat.  I did not have margarine so i did use butter and I used basic graham crackers 1/4 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of brown sugar for the topping.  The end result was more like a custard and worked well as a side dish.  It was still sweet, just not overpowering sweet.   My kids GOBBLED IT UP!!  A testimony to the squash.

My family and I love this. My son begs me to make it. I cheat and use two packages of frozen, pureed butternut squash. I also cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup, which actually makes it taste better. And I add 1 tsp cinnamon to both the squash mixture and topping. I do think the recipe should be updated to reflect that a box of Vanilla Wafers has been downsized and is now 12 ounces instead of 16 ounces. I use a food scale to measure out 8 ounces (then I throw in a few extra cookies because I like to eat some topping before I put it on the squash!!)
I, too, love to eat this cold the next day. The topping stays crunchy that way.

Whoa! I wish I had found this recipe sooner. It was absolutely delicious. I did, however, make a few changes as did other reviewers. I baked the squash instead of microwaving it (375 degrees for 50 mins until soft). My squash was only 1.5 pounds (on the smaller side as butternut squashes go) so I used only 1/3 cup sugar, 1 cup milk, 1t ORANGE (not vanilla) extract, 1.5T flour, 2 eggs, 3T butter (not marg). Plus, I was tired and lazy so I completely omitted the crust. It came out beautifully. My goodness, this thing was delicious! The only thing I can't imagine doing with this is using the amount of sugar called for in the recipe. It seems to me that would be waaaay to sweet unless you just had a completely ginormous squash. Kudos to you Valerie for this recipe!

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving dinner!  I used three 12-oz packages of frozen squash (microwaved 'til thawed), added an extra tablespoon or so of flour since it was a little watery, and cooked about 15 minutes longer than instructed to make sure it wouldn't be soupy. I didn't have vanilla wafers, so I used 1/3 box of graham crackers, crushed, and also added some chopped pecans to the topping.  It tasted like a cross between pumpkin pie and pecan pie.  So yummy!

Since I first posted this recipe, several grocery stores in my area have begun carrying frozen pureed butternut squash.  It works wonderfully and makes this dish a breeze to throw together.  I use two boxes (close to 2 cups total)and you can't tell it isn't fresh squash.  Thanks for all the great comments!  Valerie

Very good recipe. It almost tasted like a custard but with a hint of squash. I thought it was way too sweet to cook with dinner though. I will make it next time with half the sugar. Or make it as a dessert and serve it cold.

This was excellant! Big hit on Thanksgiving.It reminds me of a sweet potatoe recipe I make. I must say that it does not state how much squash to use since butternut can be very large. I started out with about 4or 5 cups,added all the other ingredients plus 1 tsp cinnamon and it was very watery.Had to add more squash and 1 more egg & 1 tsp. more of flour. Was like pumpkin pie consistency.Baked up great. I would say to cut back on the milk. It thickens as it bakes. This is yummy!!

With the cool Fall weather approaching, I found myself in the mood for a nice chilly weather side dish. I hopped online and came across this recipe. After reading the reviews, I decided to try this, cutting both the sugar amounts down to 3/4 cup instead of a full cup. I also baked the casserole in an 8x8 pan. This was wonderful! I think I used slightly less than the called for vanilla wafers, but the topping came out perfectly sweet and a bit chewy, almost like toffee. The squash part did not seem squashy at all, having a light, fluffy custard texture. The flavor was just the right balance of sweet and savory. The kids thought this was just custard and had no idea there was squash in it! My husband enjoyed it as well. Definitely a keeper and a bring-along recipe for the approaching Holidays. Thanks!

You must try this butternut squash casserole- it turned out SO scrumptious! I followed the advice of reviewers who said to add some spices, and it turned out like a butternut squash crisp or pie, because when I ate it cold just now, it tasted like one of the best pumpkin pies I've ever had.  DEFINITELY would work as a dessert, served cold, or Thanksgiving-type side dish, served hot.  And it's that delicious crunchy/chewy topping that makes it better than a pie crust!  

Here's how I made it:

Cut the squash in half lengthwise & remove seeds.  Place the halves face down in a baking dish and bake at 375 degrees for 45 min. to 1 hour.  Remove and scoop out flesh with a large spoon- rind should peel off easily.  In a large bowl, mash squash with a potato masher until really smooth, and remove any stringy squash pieces that you may see.  Add the remaining casserole filling ingredients. Also, add:

1  tsp. cinnamon
1/2  tsp. nutmeg
1/2  tsp. allspice

Stir mixture by hand, until smooth, before pouring into the baking dish. Don't bake yet! 

For the topping, use a little more than 3/4 cup, rather than 1 cup of brown sugar, so it's not overly sweet.  Sprinkle the topping evenly over the casserole before baking the whole thing for 45 minutes.  The topping will get dark brown on points, but it won't overcook.  Enjoy!

Four stars as written.  Five stars with these changes: Decrease sugar to 3/4 cup, use 1 quart (4 c.) of canned squash, and skip the topping.  UPDATE, this topping works well: 1 1/2 c. chopped pecan, 1/3 c. flour, 1 T brown sugar, 2 T cold butter.

Excellent.  My husband was afraid to try it, but one taste and he was going back for seconds.  I made one change, instead of this topping I used one from another recipe.  I put new topping on and baked at 350 degree for about 45 - 50 minutes or until firm.  Topping - 1/2 cup melted butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 cup coconut, 1 cup toasted almond slivers.

This dish is like a little piece of heaven. We dont really have dessert during the holidays because everyone wants this instead. people will come back for thirds for sure!! I started using this recipe a few years ago. I am thankful i came across it. I had to search and search after my friend made something similar and refused to share her secret!  I have made some changes to it like adding extra flour, extra vanilla, and extra vanilla wafers. I acrually crush more wafers  really fine and add them into the squash mix. And i load it/layer it with extra wafer topping. Anyways it is a huge hit with my family and friends. Time consuming but the end result makes it worth while for sure!  I even have some friends who pay me during the holidays to make large batches of it for their family dinners. :)

We usually do a candied sweet potato casserole at Christmas but I happened to have a butternut squash handy, so I made this recipe. Everyone liked that it was something different, not quite as sweet as the sweet potato... the contrast of the sugar and the squash was really nice. I didn't have vanilla wafers so I ground up some Christmas cookies. :) This is a keeper!

This was easy to make, and everyone loved it.  It was a great addition to our Thanksgiving dinner. Putting it in the microwave for about 4 to 5 minutes first made it much easier to peel.

I also made a few changes to this. I roasted the squash then scooped it out and put it in the blender with some condensed milk to make it mushy. I only used two egg and cocount flour to make it gluten free. I also added cinnamon to the recipe and didn't put a topping on it. My family loved it they didn't even know it was squash. :)

Agree with all the others... less sugar needed.
I did 3/4 c white but should have done 1/2.  also added 2 tsp cinnamon (only needed 1 likely) and 1 tsp nutmeg.  Didn't have any ginger but see how that would have been nice.  
Topping turned out great: did 1/2 c brown sugar, 5 tbsp butter melted, 5 large graham crackers crumbled, ~1/3 c oats, ~1/3 c crushed pecan halves.  Didn't even need the full final 15 min cooking (watch it closely was done at around 8 min).  If you use whole milk watch the cooking time for the first 45 because it will likely be less.
Definately more dessert like but we ate it as a side along with some simple chicken so it wasn't too overpowering to the overall meal.
Not sure I'll make it again... if I want something this sweet I'll just do sweet potatoes.  Was nice something different tho!

Incredible!   My hubby and kids (who are NOT squash fans) inhaled it and begged me to make again.  I didn't even put on the topping.   Will definitely use again.  Yummy, yummy, yummy!

Delicious with a few tweaks!  As suggested by others, I added nutmeg and cinnamon.  I also used 1 c evap milk, and 1/2 c regular milk.  Topping was crushed vanilla cookies and butter.  Would make a great Thanksgiving or fall dish, and is almost like dessert!

Superb in every way! More of a dessert casserole, much like pumpkin pie. I made a few changes which worked well. I agree with others' recommendation to roast the halves instead of cubing/boiling them. A lot of work cutting it up and removing all the rind before cooking. Also it takes much more than 1 butternut squash to produce 3 cups of squash meat. I needed 3 large squash. Also I used about 4 tbsp flour, helped set the mixture firmly when baking. Brown about 10-15 mins, watch carefully. Use extreme caution handling casserole when removing from oven! Mixture will be boiling like lava, it can seriously burn you if you are not very cautious.

Oh my sooooo sweet - even if I were serving it as a dessert!  I even skipped the vanilla wafers.  The texture was perfect, but no one could even eat more than two bites, even the kids.  Next time I will cut the sugar in half and use double the squash, and try more of a strusel topping - maybe with nuts

This tastes almost exactly like pumpkin pie, if you modify it like others have suggested with the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I halved the sugar in both the dish and the topping and it was still way too sweet for us, but if you have a sweet tooth, you will love it!

Thanks for this great recipe! I had two very small butternut squashes so I cut back a bit on some ingredients, used an 8x8 pan, and used chopped pecans mixed with brown sugar as a topping. Baked for only about 20 min. and it was set. Cooled it off and tasted it, delicious!!!

I love this recipe.  I've got a squash at home ready for making it this weekend.  I soften the squash by cutting it in half, seeding, and baking for 45 minutes at 375.  I only use a 1/2 cup of sugar, and I use ground up graham crackers coated in melted butter for a topping.  So tasty!

I followed the recipe and although I was worried about the runniness of the casserole, it set up nicely and tasted great. However, next time I think I'll use a little less sugar or leave off the topping, it was a bit too sweet for my taste. Also, the recipe calls for 3 cups of mashed squash so you'll need more than the 1 squash listed in the ingredients. Otherwise, a tasty and innovative way to use up those summer squash

This is really delicious.  Definitely like dessert.  I have made several times.  I always bake the squash.  Also I put the topping ingredients in the food processor and it carmelizes nicely, makes it a little like a creme brulee topping if you broil for a couple of minutes.  Also, mix eggs first and let squash cool to avoid have cooked eggs streaming thru custard center.   I find butter to be slightly more delicious.  Fabulous! Pleases even my impossible to please Aunt!  Thank you for wonderful  family recipe!

This recipe was great.  My husband said that if I had put it in a fancy dish, it would have been just like something at Ruth's Chris (a really fancy steak place). I didn't use the cookies in the topping, but used all the other ingredients the same. I used a combination of baking in the oven and the microwave to cook the squash until tender.  It was a bit of work to get the rind off the squash, but it was worth it!.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for posting.

I have to say FANTASTIC! This dish was so good paired with a pork tenderloin. I like others, had to improvise, instead of vanilla wafers (I didn't have on hand) I used 1 cup of frosted flakes with half the brown sugar and melted butter. I also used a little smaller casserole dish as suggested by other reviews. My guests and husband were so impressed. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

I was hoping to find a recipe similar to something I had at a restaurant before. This was so, so close! I served this for some friends at Christmas time and it was a huge hit! Tasted fabulous! I also BAKED my squash instead of microwaving. The only thing I would change about this recipe is the topping. The restaurant version I had was a cake consistency, and this was more crunchy -- still delicious, though. Otherwise, this would be a perfect 5-Star rating from me. Preference aside, this is a fantastic recipe as-is.

I did not enjoy this at all--I thought it was way too sweet (much more like a dessert than a side dish), and I didn't think the squash taste blended well with the other, more custard-like flavors of the rest of the ingredients. I might make this again, omitting the topping, sugar and vanilla and adding cheese or breadcrumbs instead for a savory casserole.

This was the hit of Thanksgiving 2007 for my family.  Using folks' suggestions below, I reduced the amount of sugar by 1/2.  Also, I'm not convinced about the need for Vanilla wafer cookies, next time I try this I think I will try graham crackers or even bread crumbs instead.  But overall this is a wonderful surprise addition to a Thanksgiving feast!

A great addition to any meal. Very easy to make and the leftovers taste great cold. Baking the squash instead of using the microwave seems to work better and has a better taste. Takes about 45min - 1 hr at 350. I used the spray butter to cover the cut side about 1/2 way through.

After cooking this for the past three years, I have found that using frozen squash really cuts down on the work and tends to give a richer flavor.  I have also this past time, because I did not have regular milk on hand substitute evaporated milk in equal amount and have to say I like it even more!  Always gets rave reviews, but mine looks nothing like the picture shown (actually better)

I find it amusing that people see a whole cup of sugar, brown sugar, and nilla wafers and are shocked that this recipe is sweet. Hello! 
This reminds me of my grandmother's sweet potato dish that we eat with our thanksgiving dinner. You CAN have a sweeter dish with a regular dinner, just like we eat congealed salads and other dessert type sides. I'm from the south so that may explain the confusion among some of the reviewers

This sounds good.....but there is no need to bake the squash.....scoop out the seeds after halving. place flat side down in glass pan deep enough to add 1/4 cup water to. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave 15-20 min on high depending on squash size. It comes out very nice and soft. Cool and scoop out.

I used a spaghetti squash instead of a butternut squash. I microwaved it for about 8 to 10 minutes, seeded, peeled and cubed and placed it in boiling water until a fork could easily pierce the cubes. I also used half the amount of white sugar it called for. Also, for the topping i used 2 cups of corn flakes, 1/4 melted margarine and 1/2 cup brown sugar. This makes it less sweet but still with enough topping. Overall - it was great and will make it again!

Everyone absolutely loved this, including 4 children who all said, "Yuck!" when I told them we were having squash casserole.  It was very sweet, though, so next time I will cut the amount of topping in half - it didn't need much of it.

This recipes is awesome!  My SIL who is very, very picky even loves it (she would eat if every day if I would make it every day for her)!  I did change it a bit as I have to triple it.  I put the squash in the microwave & cut it up.  Then I put it in the mixer w/ all the ingredients to get it really blended well (it's almost a soup), then add to a cooking sprayed 9x13 glass pan.  I also don't put the topping on and just stir it when it comes out of the oven.  It's very "soupy" when it goes in and comes out thicker w/ a great texture.

I loved this. My whole family loved this. I modified the recipe to include the ritz cracker topping rather than the cookies. If you like egg custard, you'll love this.

This was great! Everyone seemed to enjoy it!!  Made a large 9x13 casserole and I used about one and a half large butternut squash. I followed other reader's suggestions and used 1/2 the sugar and I used ritz crackers instead of vanilla wafers. The casserole does thicken and "set" when you bake it. I thought this was perfect and I would definitely make it again!!!

This was really good.  I used splenda instead of sugar, cut down the amount to 3/4 cup and it was still very sweet.  I might even cut down to 1/2 cup next time.  Topping sounded too sweet so I made my own topping using 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup softened butter, 1 T flour and 1/2 cup almonds.  Yummy.  Will make this one again - good holiday side.

I took this dish to a potluck because of the reviews this recipe received, and because it can be made so inexpensively.

I did not change a thing, because I like to keep the recipe as given the first time.

The dish was well received.  A man went around asking who brought the dish so he could learn how to make it.

I appreciate the reviews of those who changed the recipe, as well.  I would like to try other variations, such as using butter crackers and less sugar.

It's a great recipe as it is though.

Wow, this is sweet. If you like sweet stuff, then this is the one for you. I peronally used 1/2- 3/4 the amoung of sugar in the recipe, and still found it a bit much. It is more like a dessert than anything.

My family has already requested that I add this dish to the menu for every Holiday meal.  The vanilla wafer crust was Heavenly.  I appreciate the opportunity to serve a less common vegetable in a way even picky eaters would enjoy.  Thank you for the excellent recipe that will become a new family tradition with us!

This was WAY TOO SWEET for my family's taste.  I love butternut squash, but this dish may well have been made with almost anything, since all you taste is sugar (and Nilla wafers!).  No one in my home ate it, and I just threw the casserole out.  YUCK!

I made this for my Easter dish, the family went crazy for it. I have 4 requests for it. Only thing was that i have to cut back the sugar it was a little too sweet. Cut back on milk a little bit so it's thicker.I doubled it also for a larger group and it worked out great!!!

Wow! This dish was a hit even after I shared that it was squash! I agree it was a little too sweet, almost a dessert dish and for some reason mine was very watery, will bake squash next time as I normally do!

Omg. This is fabulous. At first, i thought that there was too much butter in the topping,  because it was like mush, instead of crumbly.

Oh my goodness this is delicious!!!!  And a very forgiving recipe.  I made this because I was making roasted butternut squash for two and had too much squash.  Since it was more like 3/4s of a squash I used less milk (1 cup), less eggs (2), and to reduce the calorie count only 1/3 cup sugar and about  1 1/2 tbs butter.  For the topping pecans and just a sprinkle of brown sugar.  It tastes like creme brûlée

I hope people know enough to skin the squash as it was not mentioned in the recipe. I agree the topping would be too sweet. I would sub white sugar for brown and add to taste.

this is so simple to make. and so very good . Everyone who says they don't like squash , will really like this . It is also easy to change it up  abit to your own taste or to just make it a little different. Don't tell anyone what it is until after they have  a taste .  I have never had a complant.

Delicious recipe.  I reduced the white and brown sugar, and for the topping used real butter, organic honey graham crackers, 3/4 cup of rolled oats, and added 1/2 cup of pecans.  Next time I make this I'm going to reduce the sugar even more and maybe add a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon.

This tasted more like a dessert than a side dish!  I didn't even use the topping, it was good enough as is.  I also used about 3/4 cup of sugar, it was definitely sweet enough.

This is a great recipe but I used a lot less sugar.  I reduced the sugar in the squash mixture to 2 tablespoons and I used only vanilla wafers and butter for the topping.  It still was a very sweet and rich dish.

My family loves this recipe!!!   I cut both the white and brown sugar by half and used Ritz crackers instead of the vanilla wafers to help cut down the sweetness.    I love the custard-like texture and it is great hot or cold!

Awesome recipe!  Although I baked instead of boiling in the beginning I followed the rest of recipe exactly and served it at a BBQ we had and everyone loved it......even the ones who said they never eat squash!!
Just another note, everywhere we are invited for dinner they want me to bring this casserole!!

This recipe was very good. Not suitable as a main dish but as a side dish and probably closer to dessert. Almost had the consistency of bread pudding (a little more thickening would get it there) which was very nice.  I would make this again.

I love this casserole, I've made it at least 5 times. The recipe as-is is a great dessert, but to use it as a side dish I reduced the sugar in the actual dish to 1/4 cup and I used crushed up Fiber One cereal in the topping instead of the cookies. I reduced both the sugar and the butter in the topping. I think it's too thin in the 13x9 pan so I use an 8x8 dish and it's perfect.

I wish I could rate this more than 5 stars! My family LOVED it. It was my first time using butternut squash, but won't be my last. I only substituted the margarine with butter and glad I did. I used an 8x8 pan which yielded a much thicker custard. On other suggestions, as well as my 11 year old, I will try some cinnamon and nutmeg next time (which will be really soon).

This was an excellent recipe. I also baked it in a smaller dish, for the recalculated version, and it was great! Its had a sweet taste and yet it was a veggie! Great for the kids. I shared it with a few ladies from my church who also enjoyed it. I will defenitly make it again, probably a Thanksgiving dish.

I cut the sugars both in the dish and to go on top and it was much better the second time around.  I also used a smaller casserole dish and it didn't seem as dry and gave it more of a squash feel than a dessert.

I baked my squash first, the "skin' peeled right off and the squash carmelized on the baking sheet, bringing out the natural sweetness. Instead of milk I used a half cup of orange juice and cut the sugar to a quarter cup, then blended very well before adding the rest of the ingredients. For the topping I used oat flake cereal, crushed almonds and dried cranberries, using only half the brown sugar called for. Still very sweet, so I may cut down on the sugars even further this weekend for the family holiday get together. It is a wonderful pot luck dish as it is delicious piping hot, yet for the late arriving guests it's still tasty even though it has cooled down.

I've made this for an annual cub scout banquet, and people remember it and ask me if I've brought it again.  My family loves it.

This was too sweet for us, I even reduced the amount of sugar.  I'd suggest not having the crust on top.  It tastes similar to pumpkin pie.  I would make it again.

WOW! I had two small butternut sqaush so I used those and added two large acorn squash but kept everything else the same. It came out delicious!! The topping was very watery without the wafers but it still came out delicious! As my husband said "a definite repeater!".

This is the best squash recipe ever!!  I was a little worried that it wouldn't come out right because some reviews said it was too sweet or they didn't like the topping.  I ditched the topping and just love the casserole!  It's better than expected!!

This was a really good side but it bordered on "dessert" for us.  I might cut down on the sweetness next time to create a better end result.

I hate butternut squash!  That being said, when a neighbor gave us one, I decided trying to make something with it for my husband, who does like squash.  I made this recipe, cut the sugar in half, and we both loved it.  I'll definitely make it again.

YUMMY!  I did not have vanilla wafers, so I used finely crushed Ritz crackers and it still turned out amazing.  I like it even better chilled.  I keep a spoon in the dish and every time I walk by the fridge, I scoop out a bite!! Delicious!

I made this recipe for the first time and I followed other reviewers' advice and cut the sugar in half (both the brown and the white); I definitely think this is the way to go.  I also cut the butter in half as well so as to reduce the fat content.  Adding 1 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. nutmeg and 1/2 t. ginger gave the casserole a very succulent flavor!  The only thing I will do differently next time is cut the amount of vanilla waffers in half so that the sweetness of the crust doesn't detract from the flavor of the squash mixture.  Additionally, I'll also let the casserole cool and then doublestack it when serving so it looks similar to the recipe picture!

Used a butternut squash from my garden and brought the casserole to Thanksgiving dinner potluck.  It was a VERY popular dish (made me look good in front of the  in-laws)!

I've been making Valerie's recipe for the past 3 years. After the first year, it's been demanded that I bring this to Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners and usually any other banquet in between. I cut the sugars and margarines in half, and I've even used vegan ingredients (fake eggs, soy milk) with the same success. Thanks, Valerie, for sharing this new holiday standard.

This is similar to a recipe I have.  It calls for coconut flavoring which adds a nice flavor.  I reduce the amout of sugar to about 1/4 cup.  With the brown sugar and vanilla wafers in the topping it is sweet enough.  I get requests to make this every year from family for Thanksgiving dinner.

We really enjoyed this.  I lightened it up a bit with skim milk instead of whole, Egg Beaters instead of eggs, and Splenda instead of sugar.  I also added a tsp of cinnamon and sprinkled a little more on top before baking.  Delish!!

Way too sweet! WOuld probably pass as a very good dessert. Next time, I will do as others suggested and cut the sugars. In fact, I would skip the brown sugar/Nilla waffer topping, and just sprinkle with some nutmeg or cinnimon.

So delicious!  Per previous recommendations I cut both the white and brown sugar in half and it was still very sweet.  I also cut the butter in the topping to 1/4 cup to reduce the fat.  I will definitely be making this again...thanks!

Had this great recipe for Christmas dinner, everyone who tried it seemed really pleased.  I didn't have cornflakes on hand (and the stores were closed) so I used Smart Start cereal, and thought it was great. I also cut down on the brown sugar as previously recommended. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was FANTASTIC!  It is one of my top 5 all time favorite recipes.  This will definitely be a regular dish at every holiday dinner.  My only suggestion would be to reduce the sugar in the squash (not the topping) by 1/4.

I found this much too sweet for my taste.  I would cut the white and brown sugars in half, and use cornflakes instead of vanilla wafers.  I usually have a sweet tooth, but maybe my new "healthy" lifestyle has made me adverse to so much sugar:)

This was a hit. I made this dish (without the topping because I was running short of time) as one of the side dishes this past Thanksgiving. Some of the guests told me that it was the best holiday meal they'd ever eaten and this dish received rave reviews.

This is fantastic recipe for those that don't like squash.  We are not big squash eaters, but everyone loved it!  I also cut the sugar back to 1/2 c. sugar.  I used soy milk with vanilla in place of the regular milk.  It was very good!

This was good, but I thought the topping was too sweet. I followed some of the other reviews and cut down on the sugar in the squash, but I left the topping as is. Next time I will probably not use vanilla wafers for the topping, but try something else like crackers.

Very sweet, nice and creamy...very custard-like.  I ended up with too much topping but for most people, you cant have too much.  I didnt have vanilla wafers on hand, so I used graham crackers.  No complaints there.  But how can this be considered anything other than dessert?  You're foolin' yourself otherwise.  Its truly no different than pumpkin pie in that sense.  I guess my squash was bigger than most cuz 2-3 min in microwave didnt even put a dent in it.  Hard to peel, tho, if you dont use microwave until soft (more like 10 min for mine).  I would recommend it.

I like plain butternut squash and soup and was not sure if I would like this sweet and fluffy alternative.  But it is fantastic and definitely a guest-pleasing dish.

I meant to add this to my review....after nuking the squash for 3 minutes, I found it was much easier to just peel it with a potato peeler rather than trying to "scoop out".  You also get more from it!  Thanks again!!

Absolutely wonderful recipe. I made this for Thanksgiving instead of the usual sweet potato casserole. Some folks ate it for dessert instead of the pie!

Finally got my husband and kids to eat squash -- hurray!  Next time, will probably cut back on sugar in crumb topping.

Delicious casserole! I used many of the other reviewers' suggestions. Two squash yielded about 4 cups and so I increased the eggs to 4. I used only 1 cup of evaporated milk and only 1/2 cup of white sugar, and 3 Tablespoons of flour. To give it some spice I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of ginger and1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. For the topping I crushed 5 graham crackers and mixed them with 5 Tablespoons of melted butter, 1cup of chopped pecans, and1/2 cup brown sugar. Cooked in an enamel 9x9 dish for 45 minutes at 380 degrees and then 10 more minutes with the topping.

This recipe is awesome.I loved it and have made it several times. I substituted Truvia for the white sugar and it was just delicious. I've shared the recipe with three of my friends. I will be making it again next week.

This recipe is amazing! My family has been using this recipe for the past few years and it  has quickly become the most requested holiday dish! There's NEVER any leftovers!  We make this exactly as written but you can always tweak the seasoning to your taste. I definitely recommed trying  the topping as well, it is awesome! This dish is like the best parts of a sweet potato casserole and a custard combined!

The first time I made this, we were looking for something new. We had some Winter squash in the house and we were tired of using the same old squash recipes. I originally made it using Harlequin and Gem squashes because that's what I had, and it worked fine.

There is so much sugar in this recipe (I reduce it by just a little) that we eat it as a dessert. It is a super alternative to pumpkin pie, especially if you don't feel like dealing with a crust. Both have custard-like consistencies.

My Variations:

Like others, I pre-baked the squash instead of boiling. I find the ultimate flavour is richer if the squash is baked.

I added cinnamon and allspice to the custard mixture. Yummy!

For the topping, instead of vanilla wafers, I mix together whole oats; mixed dried fruit (or just raisins or currents); cinnamon; and sliced almonds with the brown sugar and butter. This makes a sweet, crunchy topping after baking.

This is a fabulous recipe that one can adjust to suit one's family. It has become a standard recipe in our household. Thank you!

"yum, Grandma, thank you".  This took me back to a 'comfort zone' that was three decades ago for me.  My family loved it too.  So I guess I'll continue growing Butternut Squash" again next year. Times are hard but the Kitchen can bring comfort to this season.  I didn't have vanilla wafers so I substituded crushed Cherios instead.  Heart healthy, right?  It''s a blend between a vegetarian side-dish and/or a farmer's sweet tooth in-between chores.  A definitate *Historic Do Again.  ??

I've made this a few times, without the topping and we absolutely love it. This evening I had some old animal crackers I was going to throw out so I used those instead of nilla wafers for the topping and it was great. We still prefer it without the topping, but it was a successful experiment. I added a 1/2 tsp of ground ginger, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. It's a great way to sneak squash into my husband's diet. I love squash, but he's selective about his veggies. I think this would be an amazing Thanksgiving side dish.

I had to modify this to make it gluten-free by using GF flour and omitting the cookies on top.  I used a combo of crushed GF pretzels with a bit of flour mixed in instead of the cookies.  I also reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup.  Next time I will simply do nut topping like I put on sweet potato casserole.

This was a little on the sweet side for my tastes, but that obviously is a personal issue. If I make it again, I would be tempted to add some pumpkin pie spice to the squash. The topping was yummy, and I used Low Fat 'Nilla Wafers - didn't even know that such things existed!

I have made this several times during this holiday season.  I did make a few changes, instead of the cup of white sugar I used 1/2c brown sugar and 1/4c white sugar, added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  For the topping I did not have vanilla wafers so substituted with crushed Cheerios. Our entire family loves this even some of the grandchildren who don't like vegetables.

Was way too sweet!  I removed and discarded the cookie/brown sugar topping after it was baked and scooped the custard like squash into a container.  Now THAT, without the topping, was delicious!!!  Will make this again, BUT with no topping!

Thanks to several other reviews, I also cut the sugar (2/3 cup) and added cinnamon and nutmeg. Also roasted the squash beforehand instead of boiling. Used a graham cracker crumb/brown sugar/margarine mix for the topping and it turned out delicious! Next time will try reducing the milk slightly...which will probably be very soon.

I have twin toddlers, and anything I can do to get veggies in them is a plus!  Sugar and butter considerations are set aside in an effort to just get them to eat veggies.  They both love this stuff, and I'm happy they're getting all the goodness of butternut squash.

This is my favorite way to have butternut squash. My husband says this should be a dessert instead of a side dish. I use real butter instead of margarine, but leave the rest the same. I've also made this with buttercup squash and it is just as good.

First time at bat with a butternut squash. Gotta say I was a little nervous, being the big hard mellon looking thing. My thoughts were eased when the aroma of the baking squash smacked me upside my head. Everybody lined up for 2nds on this one. I didn't do either topping to cut the cals. and didn't want it looking like a sweet potato casserole. Later!

I didn't care for this receipe... I thought there was way too much liquid.  I didn't add all of it to the squash yet it still came out to this weird eggy texture.  Also way to sweet for me.

definently take advice of using half the sugar the recipe called for!!!! it is sweet with even 1/2 c sugar. I used splenda brown sugar blend for topping with plain graham crackers. Added cinnamon & nutmeg. Dinner guests thought it was delicious & it was a hit with these modifications. I really would not use 1 cup sugar. I also used frozen boxed squash that was already precooked & mashed (used 3 boxes). so much easier than making your own squash.

It was good, but too sweet for a side dish.  Next time, I may use less sugar, put the squash mixture in a deeper dish, and cut the amount of topping in half. Makes a great dessert "as-is".

Wanted something a little different for Thanksgiving so took a chance and tried this. It was the biggest hit. Even my adult children, who never eat squash tried it and came back for seconds.  Grandkids 4 & 1 1/2 loved it. This will definitely be be a dish I will cook over and over.

this is the best squash dish i've ever had! my six year old son can't get enough and he dislikes roasted squash even with brown sugar. i made it 'as is' and my whole family loved it. it is sweet but we didn't think it was overly so.

Loved this! I used the mods with ginger and cinnamon and baked the squash before mashing - this made it so easy! The skin practically peeled itself off! Also used lemon animal crackers as the crushed topping...the citrus taste is a good compliment! Will be using this for Thanksgiving!

This was fantastic!  I did two things differently: first, since I had previously peeled, cubed, and frozen my squash from the summertime, I thawed it out and roasted the cubes until soft.  Second, I substituted pecans for the vanilla wafers in the topping.  It was fabulous and I can't wait to make this at Thanksgiving!  One word of warning - this recipe requires the oven temp at 425 and I made with a roast chicken which was cooked at 325.  I should have made this ahead of time and then just warmed it up before serving, but I didn't think that far ahead, so I ended up cooking at 325 then raising the temp at the end (causing the chicken to spatter everywhere!).  Just try to plan ahead and think about what else might be cooking in your oven at the same time.  Despite that jockeying around in my oven, everything still came out perfect!

This was amazing! I didn't have nilla wafers, but I did have corn pops for the kids and I crushed those in the food processor and followed the directions as follows.  It was like a dessert. EVERYONE loved this. I think I'll add this to my Thanksgiving menu :)

This is a delicious recipe. I made a couple of minor changes, due to lack of ingredients and didn't want to go to the store, but didn't hurt it a bit. I used Splenda instead of sugar. I liked the idea of cereal for the topping, and I used a Raisin Bran Crunch/ Grapenuts mix -- definitely crunchy, but very good. The raisins made a nice addition, and I may add some to the recipe. I haven't cooked anything in a long time, and this was a great recipe to try.

It was a good idea but didn't pull through in the end. The texture was off and it was much too sweet. I think maybe my squash was smaller than the "1 butternut squash" called.

Very easy and delicious recipe. Instead of the vanilla wafer topping, I used crushed graham crackers with the melted margarine and skipped the brown sugar - it's very sweet already.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas! Everyone loves it’s delicious flavor and custard like texture. I do cheat a little with the squash as I buy it fresh but already cut into cubes. I make a recipe and a half as everyone likes seconds and bake it in a 15 by 10 inch glass dish. Everyone I have given this recipe to that has made it loves it and you will too!

This was really good however the brown sugar/ butter glaze that I used for the top made the texture like soggy cornbread. I didn't add the 1c of white sugar but instead used about 1/4c of brown sugar, the flavor was impeccable! I think that I used to much butter for the glaze as it wasn't crumbly but more like caramel. Next time I won't even use the glaze but will try some marshmallows instead! I did double it and it filled a 9x13. It looked like a yummy pan of cornbread when it was done!

This is a delicious recipe. I used a small squash that made about 1 cup cooked mashed. I used 1/3 the amounts of the other ingredients and honey graham crackers instead of vanilla wafers (grandkids ate the cookies). The family thought I had given them dessert with dinner!  We WILL be adding this to the Thanksgiving menu.

I recalculated the ingredient amounts based on what I had on hand, 1/4 of a large butternut squash, and I also put the ingredients in a smaller glass pan, an about 8x5 one.  Even though the pan was smaller, I still baked for 40min.  Reminds me of pumpkin pie but without a crust.  It is like a better, baked, dessert version of this squash by itself; you can taste the difference with the egg and milk added.  I liked this and might make it again.

So good, the topping reminds me of pecan pie.  Made exactly as recipe said, but cut squash, took out seeds and baked then scooped out and mashed.  I used all the ingredients as listed and it was perfect!!

Delicious!  I didn't have a lot of time so just sliced the squash in half and microwaved it until it was soft enough to scoop out of the shell.  Also didn't have the vanilla wafers so I tried putting some corn flakes in it (we use these with our sweet potato casserole).  I think it would have been better to have just used the butter and brown sugar.  And yes, it was sweet, but my family likes sweet!

The best dish at the party. Bake in 8x8 or it is only one inch deep. You must cut the sugar in half ,and only make half of the topping called for. Everyone wanted to know who brought the squash casserole.

This recipe was very good and I got alot of compliments.  Although I found it to be a little sweet.  I used only 1/2 cup of the white sugar and 1/2 cup of the brown sugar and that was plenty.  I also used only 1/4 cup butter for the topping.
I used crushed Ritz crackers instead of the vanilla wafers.  I will make this again, but may add even less sugar.

This was fantastic! Even better than my sweet potato casserole. I used canned butternut squash and cut the amount of sugar in half, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Really, really yummy! Especially the topping. Can't wait to make again!

I used to have a version of this recipe, but lost it.  I was glad to have found something similar to jog my memory on how to make it.  This is my family's favorite Thanksgiving dish and my husband always has me make it at least one other time a year.  I boil instead of microwave, use brown sugar instead of white, heavy cream instead of milk and butter instead of margarine.  Yes,it is more fattening, but oh, so delicious!!!  I also added pecans to the topping!

Great Taste!  I skipped the topping and next time I'll whip the squash before baking to give it a creamier texture.  I don't have a microwave right now so I baked the squash the way others had.

I didn't use the crackers as toping, just topped with margarine and brown sugar. This recipe has endless possibilities. Serve with a berry sauce, serve with berry sauce and ice cream or soy ice cream. I used soy milk instead of whole milk. The topping can be created with lightly roast almonds, brown sugar and margarine. Endless possibilities.

I had never made squash before so I was a little skeptical, but this was amazing!  I baked the squash before hand for 45min and used ritz crackers on top.  Also used half the sugar.  Definately worth the time it takes!

I just tried this recipe and changed a few things to my taste and it was WONDERFUL! Love it! I used butter instead of magarine. I added about a tablespoon of molasses and about a quarter teaspoon each of ginger, cinnamon and allspice. I used Cracklin' Oat Bran Cereal instead of Vanilla Wafers because that is what I happened to have here and I reduced the brown sugar to a half cup because I felt there was enough sugar in the cereal. Oh- I also increased the flour to about a half cup to make it a little fluffier and a little less like custard because I am not a big custard fan. It turned out great. I'm making this next Thanksgiving for sure!

Great recipe. Easy to make. I always use 1/2 the amount of sugar. For the topping, I use graham cracker crumbs instead of the wafers. Always get compliments and asked for the recipe.

This was my first time making squash in any form...I don't like squash.   However, this was a hit among my Thanksgiving guests.   My mother (of course! LOL) thought it was too sweet...but still good.  I did not try it, but it did smell yummy.  I do wish there was a better way to make cutting and "skinning" the squash.   I had to cook it in the microwave over and over...

This is a family favorite.  You would never know it has squash.  My family is not crazy about squash.  I cut the sugar back to 1/2 c. & added 2 tsp cinnamon.  I did not put the topping on.  I also baked it at 375.

Despite the fact that I almost sliced my fingertip off while peeling the squash, the final result was perfect!  Since this was the first time I've ever cooked a butternut squash, I was a little confused about preparing the squash, the recipe didn't say that you needed to peel the squash, which you do - and that was the hardest part of making this dish since the skin is so thick.  Maybe next time I'll bake it. I used graham crackers instead of vanilla wafers and cut down on the butter and brown sugar for the "crust".  It was still quite sweet but very good.

My family loved it even though they don't always like butternut squash. I microwaved the squash a few minutes, cut it in half and then continued to microwave it on lower power until it was soft enough to scoop out. I cut both the white and brown sugar in half like suggested. I also used pecans, cinnamon and crushed animal crackers on top in place of vanilla wafers. It was very good. A great way to use up all that squash from the garden.

Yummy, this is the first time I ever made butternut squash!  I prepared the squash by cutting it in half length and width wise (for a quicker cook time), removed the seedy/fibery centre and baked it flat side down for 375-400F till it is soft (varies based on size of squash - mine took around 45 min) - easy to scoop out soft squash and mush with a fork when cooked. Like others I halved the sugar and I also substitued half of the margerine/butter for applesauce.  For the toping, I used Quaker Oat Squares - Maple and Brown Sugar (crushed)instead of the vanilla wafers.  The maple flavour goes well with the squash.  Definitely will make again, friends were asking me for the recipe! Note: Topping goes soft by Day 3 - if i wasn't saving it for somebody to try, I wouldn't have found this out!

Oh My Gosh . . . Incredible!!  My boys (11 & 7) have claimed this to be their favorite veggie.  The only change is that I used cinnamon grahams to make the topping and I scoop the squash out of the skin.  Great recipe!!!

A little sweet even after cutting down on the sugar.  But it was a hit at dinner.  I didn't have any vanilla wafers so I used granola.  It was very good too.

Very sweet, younger kids love it, but I found the older folks around the table thought it was too much like dessert.
Definately a way to get the little ones to eat thier veggies.

WOW!!  The Nilla topping made the difference!  I was told by all that this is the OFFICIAL holiday squash dish forever now.  Rave reviews, 6 stars if I could give it.

I'm a sucker for sweet squash so I used butter instead of margerine and cream instead of milk.  I also went crazy with the nilla wafers....It was a hit with the family and friends.  Highly recommended!!

We all really like this dish.  It does taste a lot like sweet potato, but it was a very nice way to enjoy squash,  AND it was easy

This recipe is WONDERFUL!! It is easy to make. My daughter begs for it year round! For a smaller casserole, we make it in a nilla wafer pie crust and top with just a little wafers and YUM!! Excellent! It is sweet, but we like that! We have had it for dessert!

Wow! Wow! This was great. Light and fluffy and so yummy and sweet. The vanilla wafers give it such a great flavor. The topping was thick and I wasn't able to spread it. So, I just plopped it on top, let it melt in the oven and spread it all over the top after it had melted enough to be spread easily. Myself and my family loved this one!

Very good for a change.  It was time consuming.  I halfed all the sugar and didn't add the butter with the topping.  And it still came out VERY sweet.

This dish was ok.  My husband really liked it, but I thought the topping was a bit much -- too sweet & really takes away any of the squash taste. Seems more like a dessert than a casserole.  I didn't have 3 cups of squash either, my squash only made 2 mashed cups. I'll probably make it again since my husband really like it.

I made some revisions based on previous reviews, like cutting the sugar, and I found it to be perfect. It complemented the turkey really well.

I never had butternut squash before, let alone a casserole. But GOLLY! this was incredible! My boyfriend went for seconds, and thirds, and forths. And my grandma, a hard person to please, even liked it. Thank you so much for sharing this with us =)

Oh my goodness!  If squash grows in heaven  it will taste like this.  My company skipped dessert and went back for seconds and thirds of this.  I didn't even have all the cookies required for the top but it was still divine.  This will be a holiday favorite. Thanks!

The recipe made a wonderful casserole but it was much too sweet.  I would cut down the sugar in the recipe by at least half.

I only made half of the recipe, because I have picky eating children.  I made it with baked ham, and stewed tomatoes for dinner, but hubby ate it all up as soon as it was made.  He loved it.  Terrific.

Delicious!  I  used butter instead of margarine and instead of three whole eggs, I used 2 eggs plus two whites.  Instead of vanilla wafer crumbs, I used leftover cake crumbs.  The casserole looks beautiful and tastes wonderful.

This was excellent!!! I used egg whites instead of whole eggs and reduced fat butter from a tub to try to cut down on the fat and it still cooked up wonderfuly. I might cut down on the sugar the next time because it was a little too sweet... but then again sweet is good! I would recommend this to everyone I know. THANK YOU!!

Sooo smooth, buttery, and loooovely.  And so satisfying. I also added some mashed sweet potatoes to the butternut mixture. Definitely is as dessert--my friend said he now prefers it over cheesecake! That rich and good!

Delightful!  I cut both the white and brown sugar back to 3/4c and it's definitely sweet enough.  I was out of vanilla wafers so I used graham crackers instead.  Really good!

for the topping, I used crushed spice cookies (speculous) and butter (omit the extra sugar).  even my "less than thrilled to be eating squash" family loved it.

This is sooo good! It’s almost like dessert! Fantastic flavor! It reminds me of sweet potato casserole. Don’t change a thing.

My family loves this casserole. I use the instapot to cook the butternut squash high pressure 13mins then natural release. Easily scoops off when done. Putting it all in my vitamin makes the casserole nice and smooth too. We love this dish.

I love this recipe. I cut the sugar in half, both in the squash and the topping. For the topping, I cut the Nilla Wafers down by a third to a half and replace with rolled oats, crushed walnuts or pecans, and about a quarter stick extra butter. I also follow other's suggestion to partly microwave the squash, and then cut in half, remove seeds, and bake cut side down on a baking sheets until soft, peeling off the skin. I also add 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Last, I like the recipe a bit thicker, so I add about an extra tbsp or two to render the squash thicker. I prefer the denser texture.

This is amazing. Everyone was amazed that it was butternut squash . They thought it was sweet potato.  The only thing i did different was i baked the squash at 400 cut in half for appox 50 min, then scooped it out. Will definitely be making again

I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit.  It tasted like a dessert instead of a vegetable.  Everyone was raving about it.  The most delicious thing I ever ate.

We get a similar casserole at a local recipe. I roasted the butternut squash whole first, but think next time I will microwave, peel, dice then roast. I didn't find it too sweet like some of the other's commented, but I did mix half Nilla Wafers and half Ritz crackers along with the recommended brown sugar and that may have cut some of the sugar. I'm going to try adding some celery and onions next time to add another deminsion.

This casserole was absolutely amazing the first time and every time after that. I've used it with sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving and will again for 2018. I recommend this sweet, smooth and crunchy flavorful dish.

Excellent recipe for Butternut Squash but I think it's more of a souffle than a casserole.  My husband is a very picky eater and he loved it.  Due to necessity I only made one little change, I didn't have vanilla wafers so I used Keebler Club Crackers instead.  Great recipe, thanks so much for sharing.

This turned out amazing! Everyone loved it! I copied the other reviewers and I microwaved squash first for about 2 minutes so I could cut it easier because I’m a wimp, then I baked it for about 35 min at 350 with cut side down. Scooped out all the seeds then spooned remaining squash in bowl and mashed with masher and added the other ingredients. It said to put back in at 425 but I noticed it browning a little on the sides so I baked at 350 for the last 10 minutes.

I will definitely make this again.  My only changes were that I cooked the whole squash in a large crockpot on high.  I reduced the brown sugar by half and then added a good sprinkle of cinnamon to the topping.  It went over well at our family reunion where there was lots of competition with other good and tasty foods.

More dessert than side dish, but great for the sweet tooth.  I used Rita crackers, not having Vanilla Wafers and was great!
In making a mistake on the topping by putting on before baking, I skimmed off what I could (soupy)and kept in separate bowl and stirred in what I couldn't.  Cooked squash mix 35 min. then added the "soupy" topping  and cooked 15 min. more.
Top was crusty, almost like creme' brulle'  and  tastes super good!

Really easy to make! Tastes fantastic because it's not too sweet, but just set enough. I didn't even use all the made topping...I used just over half. I'll definitely be using this recipe many more times.

I 1st made this for book club. Based on many notes, I reduced the white sugar by half.  I still felt the final product was too sweet. Next  time I make it, I will reduce the white sugar to 1/4 cup to see how that works. The topping was delicious and crisp, but again I could have used 1/2 the brown sugar as it was super sugary.  This recipe can be a winner! So velvety and good! The book club ladies all wanted the recipe.
UPDATE: I made this again for the Bunco ladies  and reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cups and did a more savory cracker/panko crust (with 2 tbp brown sugar) instead of the sweet vanilla cracker crust. It was a BIGGER WINNER. So many more asked to the recipe.  
UPDATE 2: I've now made this 5-6 times, each time adjusting the sugar lower in the squash mix. I personally love it more as a savory dish as opposed to a SWEET SUGARY dessert-like dish.  I'm making this twice this week... once for a party this weekend  and again for Thanksgiving. I'll will use 1/4 cup white sugar, instead of 1 cup. I will do a more savory topping with cracker/butter/panko + 2 tbp brown sugar. This is really is a great recipe. You just need to adjust it to your personal liking/disliking for sugar.

As other reviewer's suggested, I roasted the squash in the oven instead of microwaving it. I replaced the vanilla wafers with Honey Bunches of Oats cereal and cut back on the sugar since the cereal is so sweet. My nephew hates most vegetables, but devoured this at Thanksgiving dinner and then asked for seconds. Great recipe.

I discovered this recipe a few years ago on Allrecipes.  Since that time, I have made it for every major holiday and a few not so major.  My in laws love this casserole.  They would eat this when they would eat nothing else.  My father in law adored it.  Near the end, getting him to eat anything was difficult, but if I put this on his plate, he would eat all I put on.  I am making a very large batch of it today, 8 butternut squash, for his  Celebration of Life.  It will be one of many of his favorite dishes that we have prepared.  It is very sweet.  It is over the top delicious, creamy, and filled with calories.  Everyone who has tried it loves it, and my entire family has at this point.  Don't hesitate to try it.  The elderly seem especially fond of this, and that is valuable when they no longer want to eat anything.  I have made very few changes to this recipe.  I microwave the butternut squash for a few minutes, peel them,  scoop out the seeds, chunk them up and boil them.  The only real change I have made is to run the cooked and drained squash through the food processor. 
 It makes for a very smooth and custard-like consistency. 
 Thank you for such a precious recipe!

I halved the sugar and used ground up cookies (that were too dry to eat as cookies, but make a great topping for all sorts of other things) for the topping.  We loved it...even the kids!

Great one! Few ingredients- simple to prepare - easy! This one results in a nice fluffy/custard type texture and doesn't hide the squash. Have made this many, many times over the course of a few years now...but a gluten free version... and I omit the topping. It's really delicious as written, but I now use Buckwheat or a GF rice flour based blend and it turns out perfect. I'm also now cutting the sugar back to half a cup and never really measure the squash...just oven cook a big one and peel it. I throw it all in my casserole dish, beat it right in the dish and then put it in the oven - less dishes!

I love this recipe with some small changes. I used Ritz crackers instead of vanilla wafers. The wafers makes it too sweet but the crackers add a little salty bite with the same crunch.

Love the recipe with one minor change.  Instead of the vanilla wafers, I used ginger snaps.  The family loved it.  Will be making again.

I added so cinnamon and allspice to this and used butter instead of margarine.  I used ginger snaps instead of vanilla wafers.  It was great but it was not so much a vegetable dish as a dessert.

I did use  butter crackers instead of vanilla wafers, but I'm sure it is wonderful with the wafers, too.
It was plenty sweet with the crackers, and still divine!
The hardest part of this recipe is getting the squash seeded and peeled! It is worth the effort though, will make again and again!

My son made this as his first dish and we gave him rave reviews. This was so goooood! In fact it was the best squash casserole I ever ate. I did subsitiute the milk for heavy cream, which made the consistency thicker, which I loved. I would recommend that you not use too much sugar though cause it could be a bit overly sweetened as a result. We made it the full way, and it was out of this world!!

Awesome - a family favorite.  I do cute the topping in 1/2 and use the low-fat vanilla wafers to cut the sweetness.

Made it for potluck. A few people seem to like it, and it doesn't taste bad. It's just a bit sweet and taste more like dessert than an entree.

This was sooo delicious! A Thanksgiving hit! I will most certainly make this again! Thanks very much for the recipe! 

One thing my family did change was we added  brown sugar instead of white sugar to give it more flavor, we also added pecans to the topping to make it a little better, and we baked the butternut squash instead of microwaving it. 

Good luck!

I liked everything about this recipe except the sugar.  I did reduce it , however, next time I'll only put a total of a 1/2 cup.  If you don't like sugar, the recipe doesn't need it at all.  I did put marshmallows on top since I didn't have the cookies.

It came out great!  The only change I made was replaced margarine with applesauce to make it healthier.  I used another member's suggestion to put Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds on top.  I will definitely add more nuts on top next time (pecans might be good).

Didn't bother microwaving the squash, just cut peeled, seeded, cubed and boiled it. Recipe calls for one squash and 2 cups of sugar which is where I went wrong, ended up as a cobbler and less of a vegetable casserole.

My family loved this recipe. It will be added to my list of favorites. I did cut the sugar in half and I added a tesp. Of cinnamon. I also changed the topping using 1 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup melted butter and chopped pecans. I put topping on dish the last 10 mins. And broiled the topping for last 2 mins. I also made this recipe up the night before and put in fridge. I wasn't sure how it would cook, but it was great!!!!

Oh my goodness..this was so delicious!!! Everybody loved it!! I made the recipe as listed but also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg...tastes very similar to sweet potatoes.. I cooked the topping for 8 min so it wouldn't get too brown...Will make again for sure!

After reading other reviews, I reduced the sugar to 1/3c. in the squash and the topping but still way too sweet. I used ritz crackers in the topping. The texture was great but next time I will try without the sugar in the topping. I did add 1/4 tsp ginger and cinammon, but couldn't really taste them through the sugar.

I added nutmeg and cinnamon and baked it in an 8x8 dish. For some reason 425 for 45 minutes was either way too high of a temp or too long of a cooking time...the inside of the casserole itself still tastes amazing but the top and bottom/sides were burnt!!!! Next time I make this I'll reduce the temp and/or cooking time. I also made the topping with pecans instead of vanilla wafers.

Happened to be going to a fall party last night, the day after having my wisdom teeth removed.  I figured I had better take something that would be tasty AND soft so I could actually eat it!  This was a great recipe and the first thing to go at the party but I had a to rate it a 4, given the changes I made.  I used a very large squash, roasted whole in the oven.  Cutting up a squash is a pain in the butt and it was just not necessary in this case.  Scooped out the squash and kept the rest of the recipe the same EXCEPT cut the sugar to one-half cup brown, no white.  It would have been way to sweet with that much sugar.  No streusel topping necessary.

I made this for a hayride party last night and had many requests for the recipe.  I made some alterations only because I did not have all the ingredients on hand and it was delicious..
Instead of vanilla waffers, I used quick cooking oatmeal. Splenda brown sugar and real butter. Also have free roaming chickens so the eggs are always richer. What a hit this was. My butternut squash was home grown so I have enough to make more. Thanks allrecipes for this wonderful fall recipe.

This was wonderful.  I roasted the squash to bring out the sweetness. Doubled the squash with only 1/4 cup white sugar.  Did brown sugar, butter, oats and a little flour for the topping.  This was plenty sweet without the extra sugar

Based on some of the comments, I roasted, and used pecans and vanilla wafers, and nutmeg and cinnamon. This is definitely a winner.

This was a really good place to start. I agree with other reviewers, microwaving then boiling is redundant so I have switched to roasting my squash. Roasting preserves more nutrients and flavor. I added several shakes of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, Ginger, and ground cloves to punch things up a bit. I cut the white sugar down to one quarter of a cup because of the whole cup of brown sugar in the topping, and I actually like the taste of the squash without making it overly sweet. For the topping I substitute about a cup and a quarter of rolled oats( Sometimes I throw in a handfull of crushed pecans too!)

It was a good side dish but was little sweet for me, next time I may cut down on the amount of sugar I add.  I could eat very much of it because it seemed way to sweet.  But it cooked really nicely and had a good consistency.

This is heavenly!I made it with the ones left over from freezing. So easy cooking in the micro first then steaming instead of boiling. I changed a couple things,brown sugar instead of white,gave it a little caramel flavor, half and half instead of milk and cinnamon grahams instead of wafers. It was rich but not too much,not too sweet. You could taste the squash at the end of the bite.Watched anthony Zimmern so much I like to describe each bite!!! I know we will be planting much more butternut next year and thank goodness it freezes so nicely. I can't imagine what the reviewer did to dislike it so much,please try it again with these tweeks.

I make this when we have guests for dinner and everyone loves it and asks for the recipe.  Since living in TZ for 3 years our diet now includes only fresh food made from scratch which means we don't get a lot of sugar from processed foods.  So, I cut the sugar in half, use pumpkin when I cannot get butternut squash, and I eliminate the topping all together because we don't get anything like vanilla wafers here-but I don't mind eliminating that processed food anyway, and the extra calories from the sugar and butter.

This is the only way my kids will eat butternut squash, and they love it! I only put on a 1/4 of the topping, and bake the squash in the oven instead of microwaving it. Other than that I make it as written. Made it for Christmas and Easter, was a big hit even though my family traditionally has sweet potatoes.

We loved this recipe!  For the first time ever my daughter asked me if I could make more.  We are a gluten free family so I modified the recipe by using a gluten-free flour blend in place of the flour and cinnamon chex in place of the vanilla wafers.  Will definitely make again!

I loved this recipe! I did add cinnamon and nutmeg to the squash and omitted the cookies in the topping. They are unnecessary really. This isn't something we can eat on a regular basis due to its ingredients but an awesome recipe for a special occasion!

I made this for Thanksgiving (with a few tweaks) and everyone loved it.  I baked the butternut squash, sliced in half with the rind side up, as some other reviewers suggested. I just couldn't bring myself to add a whole cup of sugar, so after mixing all the other ingredients, I tasted it and decided to add 2 tablespoons and that was plenty.  I didn't have vanilla cookies or wafers or any of the other suggestions for the topping.  So, I used oatmeal instead and it tasted great.  Will definitely be making this again.

I did not do the topping and my squash measured only 2C (not 3)so I adjusted the other ingredients.  I ended up reheating it for the next day and OMG it was almost like a desert.  It tasted like a custard and my son's girlfriend said it reminded her of creme brulee.  This is definitely one I will repeat!!!

I was looking for an alternative to my regular roasted butternut squash and I was very pleased by this alternative.  I also cut the sugar down to 1/3 of a cup to avoid the added calories and avoid a dessert taste, since I was serving it with a savory chicken recipe.  I didn't have the vanilla wafers, so I substituted Honey Bunches of oats and since they are fairly sweet, cut the brown sugar to 1/3 cup as well.  The vote was a unanimous Delicious!!I'm thinking of making this in place of my regular Thanksgiving sweet potato casserole.
Thanks for the great recipe!!

This casserole was fantastic with the honey bunches of oats/butter/brown sugar topping just because it sounded like a better finish.  I will be making this at the autumn family gathering I will be planning sometime.

Can't believe I'd never tried butternut squash before (ever!) but they were half price in the supermarket, and I was intrigued. This was the RIGHT recipe to test my curiosity! YUM YUM YUM! I didn't add the topping (had no wafers or anything similar) but it was sweet enough. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as described except baked the squash first, as others suggested. My family thought it was delicious, but what wouldn't be with this much butter and sugar in it? The topping could have been less sweet. The squash itself wasn't too sweet...it had a custard taste, not much else...not pumpkin or sweet potato-like, as I would have thought. I would make this again, but next time I'll try reducing some of the sugar or just expect it to be dessert rather than a side.

This dish tasted good, but the squash was stringy. I'll make it again, but next time I'll sieve the squash to remove strings. I left out the flour to make it more custard-like.

This casserole turns out much better when you double the amount of squash and roast them in the oven first.

I changed the sugar to 3/4 cup and added a 5 ounce package of chopped pecans to the topping. I will make this again and again! I roasted the squash as recommended but an FYI, to peel raw squash, I cut it in half and use my veggie peeler THEN cube it. So much easier!

This was good! Noone was really blown away by it, but we eat a lot of squash in this family so I guess I shouldn't have expected everyone to be amazed that they actually liked squash. My mother hated the topping. She thought the wafers made it taste strange, but noone else complained and the leftovers vanished pretty quickly!

I didn't have vanilla wafers so I used crushed Wheaties. I thought the topping was a bit too crunchy but my husband loved it. 

To prepare the squash, I cut the squash in half, removed seeds and salted each cavity. I baked the squash in the oven in 2 tablespoons melted butter at 375 for 45 minutes. Then I peeled and pureed the squash in the blender.

This is a really great recipe, but cut the sugar!  I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown (for the topping) and it was still very sweet.  I don't think a full cup of both is necessary.  A very good dish, and I plan on making it again for thanksgiving.  Thanks!

Huge hit at my table. My husband doesent like squash at all but he loves this dish. I would suggest not using so much sugar though, if not its more like a dessert. I will be making this a thanksgiving recipe to use every year.

I made this as a dessert using leftover kabocha squash.  I subbed 2 eggs, 3/4 c. of vanilla yogurt, 1/2 c. maple syrup, 2 Tbs melted soy margarine and 3 Tbs flour and added currents, cinnamon, nutmeg and ground ginger for the stated ingredients. When it was almost done, I topped it with crushed graham crackers, cinnamon and pecans and put it back for 5 minutes. I served it hot with vanilla ice cream. My teen really raved about it.

Everyone in my family LOVED this!  I used reduced fat nilla wafers & 2% milk to cut down on the calories/fat etc.  Also, next time I will cut the white sugar down to 1/2 c.  Very, very good & sooo easy to make.

changes I made:
I didn't make the glaze, it was very sweep already.
Used 2/3 cup splenda instead of sugar and 4 egg whites instead of 3 whole eggs.
If I would have put the glaze on this, I really would serve it for dessert.

Super yummy, but you HAVE to cut the sugar in half.  Also, it's easier to scoop the squash after you have cut it in half and baked it, cut side down for 1/2 hour to 45 minutes or till the inside is soft.

Absolutely delicious, but had a few problems with the recipe.  Microwaved it twice as long and still was never really soft, but I was still able to cut up.  After I boiled, mashed, and mixed it with the other stuff, the skin was still noticable and tough, so I strained it. IN the future I'll peel it before I boil it. I also didn't add the topping, and only cooked it for about 30 min.  I've never had squash before, this will be the only way I'll fix it in the future.

This was very good.  It was rather difficult to peel and cube the squash.  I cut the milk to 1 cup and used 2 eggs. I did not have vanilla wafers,so substituted 1/2 cup chopped pecans, 1/3 cup margarine and 1/3 cup brown sugar for topping.  The entire family liked it!

OH MY GOSH! Someone should have warned me this was desert. Sinfully tasty and sweet. I'm giving four stars because even though I am a major sweet tooth, this proved too sweet for me. I recommend cutting the sugar content a bit but otherwise TASTY!

This is absolutely delicious!  My family (including my 17 year old son who has Classic Teenage Tastebuds) loves this Casserole.  Getting the texture just right is a bit tricky, so I had to add a smide more flour, but overall very easy to make and a pleasure to eat!

MMMM, tasty!  I had to microwave for about five minutes, and then I cut in half and then into smaller chunks, after I scooped out the seeds, for easier peeling of the rind.  Followed the advice of other cooks and cut the sugar in half.  Also used Ritz instead of cookies and it came out perfect!  It's also good cold with some whipped topping.

Like everyone says, cut the sugar!! I made it as is and we couldn't eat it becuase it was WAY too sweet.  It tasted like pumpkin pie filling.  I also agree with the other reviewer who stated that the pineapple should be drained. However, the pinapple adds a nice flavour.

What leftovers?  My attempt at this was a little disappointing.  BUT,I think it's because I didn't drain the squash well enough.  I didn't use 2 cups of sugar either - it was more like a dessert than a veggie - and you know adults, we can have dessert first cuz we can!!!  Will definately make this again.  Liv-n-learn...    ;)

I loved the taste of this but the texture wasnt what I was looking for.  Maybe I should have baked it much longer, plus I did as others suggested and omitted the topping, that probably has something to do with it.  Will try to make again.

Absolutely a 5 star rating on this recipe.  Thank you Valerie for submitting this delicious dish.  I made it last night and served it along with grilled salmon steaks, garlic mashed potatoes and cole slaw.  My husband won't go near squash of any kind with a ten foot pole.  I put about a 1/4 cup of it on his plate and said please, just taste it.  I fully expected that he would be scraping his helping into the trash.  Was I surprised!  I asked if he liked it and he didn't hesitate at all in saying "Yes".  He couldn't stop eating it and went back for more!!!  He thought it was wonderful.  I will make this again.  It will be a great addition to holiday meals.

Loved it!  Didn't even bother to make the topping.  It was perfect.  Just less sugar than is called for, the squash is soooo sweet!

This is now a requirement at all family holidays.  Even the picky children eat every bite!  We sometimes make two casseroles just to make sure everyone gets some, and the leftovers are wonderful with leftover turkey.

Fantastic. I cut the sugar per other reviews and actually got my husband and friends who were scared of squash to not only eat it, but go back for seconds.

I served this at Thanksgiving and no paid attention to anything else.  Everyone wanted the recipe and there was not a drop left in the dish.  The best thing I ever made.  From the youngest to the oldest it was the hit of the dinner - especially with the men!

It was good, but a bit bland (all I could taste was sweetness).  I would have liked it more if it has more texture (something for me to chew).  It reminded me of baby food.

I made this for Thanksgiving and I thought it was pretty good,  Actually, I cant wait to make it again with two slight changes.  First, a little less sugar in it and secondly I might just do away with the whole topping all together or at least use very little of it.  I really liked the taste of it though! Just found it too sweet as is.

This recipe is awesome!  I took it to a potluck at work, and I had everyone asking for the recipe!  It's the best Squash Casserole I have ever tried!  I definately recommend this to anyone, even those who don't particularly care for squash!

I loved this recipe!  It's hard to believe a squash can be so good.  What a great way to get kids (and husbands) to eat squash!  The three changes I made were to use 3/4 c. white sugar instead of 1 cup, I added a sprinkle of cinnamon, and I used Honey Bunches of Oats with almonds instead of the vanilla wafers (like another reviewer, that's what I had). Some of the topping was a little chewy or soggy the next day (I think I might have preferred the wafers), but still D-E-licious. I'll have to try the vanilla wafers next time, because I will be making this again (and again, and again...)

I made this for a company potluck and it was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was sweet, but just right.  I've been asked for the recipe 4 times already and the potluck was a few hours ago.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner because I wanted something different...I found it to be very tasty but very SWEET, as other reviewers have mentioned.  Would definitely make again, perhaps with Ritz crackers instead of the vanilla wafers.

Very good recipe! The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that I think the topping makes it a little too sweet. I would have to modify the recipe for my diabetic mother who LOVED this! (I ate leftovers for breakfast! LOL)

I loved this, but definitely agree that it should be called a dessert.  Next time I will reduce the topping by 1/2 and put it only around the edges; as is it's way too overpowering and sweet.  Overall a great recipe!

This dish has a great flavor, just a little too sweet for my tastes.  I will be making it again, I think I'll just cut the amount of the topping I add in half, because that is what I found to be so sweet.  The casserole itself was wonderful, wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks!

I made this dish for a pot-luck and everyone ate it up!  I'm definitely making this again!

Yummm. Fantastic for Holiday Meals or for anytime meals.
I add 1/3 cup chopped walnuts (or pecans) and
8oz can drained crushed pineapple to the ingredients listed.
We don't like it... WE LOVE IT!

Excellent recipe!!  I made this for home and then for Thanksgiving dinner, and received rave reviews from all!  Like many suggested, I cut the sugar in half and also substituted unsalted crackers for the vanilla wafers.  This made it a side dish that is still sweet, but not too sweet that it seemed like a dessert.  It's very very tasty - a lot like sweet potato casserole.

I found this to be an extremely successful recipe, but cut back on sugar to let more of the natural flavor through. I didn't think all the vanilla cookie topping was necessary, either. At times, I could have sworn I was eating pumpkin. This is a great recipe which I will make over and over again. Thank you, Ms. Moore!
