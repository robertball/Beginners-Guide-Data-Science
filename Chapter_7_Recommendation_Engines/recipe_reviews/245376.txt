This was delicious! It is very creamy - the consistency of mayonnaise. I had to use lime and rice wine vinegar but the sesame oil gave it a deeper flavor. I had it on a baked potato and look forward to using it in place of mayonnaise in various applications.

This was delicious . I'd definitely make it again but would increase the lemon juice. It was very thick.i also added fresh cilantro.

As good as it sounds. Cool and creamy and a nice smooth flavour. I only used one clove of garlic though. I also added some cayenne pepper powder. It is quite thick. If you want a runnier dressing, I suggest mixing up 50% more of the liquid ingredients and adding it in little-by-little until you get the consistency desired. It all depends on the size of your avocado I think. Definitely a keeper for salads or as a dip.
