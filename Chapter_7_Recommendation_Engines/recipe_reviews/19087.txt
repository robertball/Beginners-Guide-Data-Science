This was disappointing. The cake part had very little flavor.  The frosting only had a very faint flavor, and that flavor was chocolate - no coffee flavor came through.  I won't make this again.  (The only positive thing I can say is that there was ample frosting; I had some left over even after I generously frosted the cake.)

I only made the frosting, but it was easy and delicious. I used about 1/2 of the coffee-water mixture and it had a very distinct mocha flavor. Will definitely make again.

The cake was tasty and moist and stayed moist for a week after I made it. I would make it again. I did not make the frosting although.

I was looking at this recipe & read the reviews.  If theres not enough of a coffee flavor, substitute the water in the recipe with coffee.  Thats what I'm going to try.  Happy baking :)

Delicious! I used espresso that I made myself instead of the called for instant coffee. Next time I will use more espresso and less cocoa powder, but it still turned out wonderful. Everyone loved it and it was really easy to make!

The cake was VERY quick to make since you only need to add cappuccino coffee powder, eggs, and oil to a white cake mix.  The frosting was more complicated since you have to alternate cocoa, powdered sugar, and milk-quite messy.  Also, it tasted greasy, like a Pepperidge Farm cake.  I would like to find an easier and tastier frosting.

I made this for my high school Culinary Arts class.  My chef LOVED it.  It was super easy to follow and make.  I didn't change anything to the recipe.  It was perfect all on its own.

Next time I will follow directions on the cake mix--using whole eggs,full amount of oil and maybe adding only a tablespoon of water if needed. And for the frosting I will use butter rather than shortening and perhaps cut back on the milk and use more coffee.

It doesn't really taste like cappuccino, but it's really yummy anyway.  My family, friends, and I really like it.!
