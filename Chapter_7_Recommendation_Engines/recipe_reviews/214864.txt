The flavour itself was rather good and the Soju and lemon went really with well with the onions. However, I found that it didn't yield as much sauce as I would have expected. Definitely worth a shot and very filling.

Really enjoyed this recipe! The onions were the highlight of the dish and as mentioned before the flavors go really well together. I upped the amount of Soju, onion, and lemon juice to make sure there was plenty to go around.  My boyfriend is half Korean so there is always a bottle of Soju sitting around. Glad to finally have a great use for it!
