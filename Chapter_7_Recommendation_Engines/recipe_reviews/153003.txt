I thought this was just ok.  Tasted too much like cough syrup.  I was looking for shot recipes for a party I am hosting next week.  I don't think is is what I am looking for.

This is actually a pretty tasty shot - similar to Liquid Cocaine (half Jager, half Goldschlager), but with a cooler afterbite (rather than a hotter one from the cinnamon)...

It only gets 4 stars though - as the above mentioned shot is far superior.

I didn't like it at all, but someone else who is a jager fan loved it, so we met in the middle for a rating.
