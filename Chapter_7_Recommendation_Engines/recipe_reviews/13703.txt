My husband and I really liked this casserole.  My 3 year old ate it too.  I used canned black beans and skipped all the long soaking and cooking times.  It worked well.

Not bad just bland.  I wouldn't add the carrots or celery until the baking time. We ended up using this as a filler for our halibut tacos.  Too time consuming. I won't make this again.

The flavor was great, however, I had to double the salt for my taste. I would reccomend not adding the celery, onions and carrots until just before gettting ready to bake. I only waited until it had simmered 1 hour and they were mush.

This is a fantastic meal in one and the taste is amazing.  I have made this several times and my husband who is a "junk food" eater actually started requesting it.  Its heart healthy and diet friendly and has lots of fiber, with a dollop of light sour cream its a fantastic breakfast for us to switch up from oatmeal or egg whites and potatoes obrien.

Good - but needed some jazzin up.  I used rinsed can black beans and kept vegetables crisp- added cheese and sour cream and it was great.  Used this as a dip also.

I made these on the stove top. They were ok, but really boring. I suppose we are just used to black beans with jalapeno, lime juice, cilantro, cumin etc. Would make again but only with these adjustments. Thanks anyway.

This dish tasted even better when reheated rather then just out of the oven.  I enjoyed it but my hubby did not care for it to much.  It packs well for the lunchbox.

I will make this again like others I used canned beans rinsed and drained. I had made a spicy rice and pork chop so the blandness of this dish worked well with my dinner however the next time more seasonings will be added.

This smelled WONDERFUL. We really were expecting it to taste as good. I had added salt before baking, but even with that, it was still very bland.  I followed the recipe very closely. My boys and I decided it's edible, but we won't be making this again.
