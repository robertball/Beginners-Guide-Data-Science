Superb texture and flavor! The tang imparted by the
yogurt is the perfect foil for the spices. I've made
this twice now. As written, it needed a bit of
tweaking. So this time, which was far more successful
than when I followed the recipe verbatim, I added 1/2
tsp baking powder to lighten it, 1-1/2 tsp cinnamon,
1/2 tsp freshly ground nutmeg, 1 tsp allspice, 3/4 tsp
ground cloves, 1/4 tsp mace, as flavor was a bit pale
the first time. Baked it in a greased and floured
bundt pan for one hour at 350. Also, I
agree with previous poster not to "beat for 2 minutes"
after adding the flour. This will encourage excessive
gluten development, which will result in a tough
product. All the beating should be in the creaming
process, with the sugar/butter/egg mixture. After
that, once dry ingredients have been added, only a
minimum of gentle mixing (on the lowest speed) is
necessary, only to incorporate the dry ingredients
fully. If you follow these steps, your pound cake will
be dense yet tender, with a crumb that's moist yet
fully baked. The aroma as it bakes is delightful, and
the cake is irresistible. Finished with a glaze made
from 1Tb soft butter, 1-1/2 cup powdered sugar, and 1
Tb milk drizzled on the warm cake. No trouble removing
from the generously greased and floured pan, when done
15 minutes after removal from the oven. A recipe to be
handed down to following generations in your family -
it's that good!

Geat recipe!!!! I subbed 1 cup sugar for splenda, applesauce for the butter, and egge beaers for the eggs.  I bumped up the leavening to 1 tsp each of baking powder and backing soda.  I also increased the level of spices.  
To add a fruity fall flavor, I sliced 5 small tart apples and mixed them with a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and brown sugar.  I heavily lined the bottom of two loaf pans with the apples and poured the batter on top.  This turned out amazing!!!!!!!  Bake for 45-50 min and then let sit in the oven while it cools to prevent the cake from falling.
This tastes great alone, or served warm with whipped cream or light vanilla ice cream, what a great low fat treat!

Super easy!  No sifting dry ingredients and then making a well, etc.... Just mix and bake!  I baked it in a bundt pan for 55 minutes.  Like most pound cakes, it's better the  next day.  Moist, great spicy flavor, but not overpowering!
Thanks for sharing the recipe!! Perfect autumn cake!

OMG..  This is sooo good! I made it in a bundt pan so it would have a pretty shape to it, I needed to bake it about 50 minutes total. This cake needs nothing, you can eat it as is. I will definetly make this again!!

This is a fabulous recipe!  Very moist, very flavorful, very easy and it makes the whole house smell terrific.  My advice: DON'T try it in a bundt pan as it ends up "falling" after it comes out of the oven, giving it poor presentation value!  Follow the recipe and use a 9x13. Finally, if you want to avoid producing too much gluten in the flour (a tough/chewy end product) beat the sugar/eggs/butter on high for 3-5 minutes then add the remaining ingredients and mix only until blended.

I made this as a bundt cake. It was great but I wish I had not taken the advice of another reviewer and added 3/4 tsp cloves. The cloves were a bit overpowering and it was just too much spice. I think adding a vanilla glaze made it even better.

Wonderful tasting cake. Great with whipped cream!I made it a low fat low sugar version to make it a little more healthy. I used reduced fat margarine, 1.5 cups splenda and .5 cup sugar, and fat free vanilla yogurt. My family didn't even know I altered it.

I have a phobia for cakes that are overly sweet, so everytime I get a recipe, I always reduce the amount of sugar. At first I didn't want to tamper with this recipe since it was getting such good reviews, but my phobia won over and I reduced the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I did what another member suggested and did not beat in the dry ingredients. This may have resulted in the lightness and fluffiness of my cake. I baked it for about 35 minutes, and ate almost 1/4 of it right after I took it out of the oven. It was absolutely delicious! Moist and not to sweet. Maybe next time I'll try adding more sugar and more spices (only because I'm a spice person, the recipe is indeed very good as is). I'm waiting for it to cool right now and I'm going to have some friends taste it this evening. Hopefully they would like it as much as I liked it. Thank you Georgie for such a great recipe!

This is so quick and easy!  I cut the recipe in half and made it a loaf.  For a glaze, I used sugar, butter, milk and triple sec - a nice compliment to the spice!  Thanks for a simple, delicious recipe.

Made this for Christmas dinner. Big hit. I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain. Goes great with egg nog and a little bit of spiced rum.

A very nice moist cake.  I used 1-1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. splenda.  Also used 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. applesauce.  I baked it in a bundt pan for 45 min. at 350.  I will make this again.

I didn't have any butter so I used 1 cup oil and because some reviewers had said it was a bit dry I added 1/4 cup apple sauce.  Baked for 45 mins and it was perfect. Just the right amount of spice and nice and moist.  Thanks, I will make it again

SO delicious!  I follwed previous reviewer by adding more yogurt, less butter.  Added heaping amounts of spices and it is delicious.

I read some other reviewers comments & made some changes. 
1) Replaced sugar with Truvia 
2) Replaced the butter with 1/4 cup olive oil & 3/4 cup applesauce.
3) Doubled the cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves
4) Did not use salt or allspice. 
5) Used VANILLA greek yogurt
6) I added 1/2 tsp baking powder as someone else suggested to make it less dense. 
Tastes great & is sugar and butter-free!

dense and moist with a light crispy crust!  seems to be a pretty forgiving recipe too as i did not use exact measurements.  i subbed in more yogurt instead of all the butter as directed below. i also decreased the sugar.  and after mixing everything, the batter seemed a bit too dry so i added an extra egg.  i used a bundt pan and the cooking time was def way longer than 35 minutes -- closer to 50 as others have posted.  even with all these adjustments and my rather slapdash method, it turned out wonderfully.  will def make again, but will prob cut out more sugar and use a cream cheese glaze.  yum!

My yogurt was about to expire so I thought I'd give this cake a try.  I made a few changes:  I didn't have butter but I had some left over applesauce... so instead of 1c butter I used 1/2c apple sauce and 1/2c oil.    I accidentally doubled the baking soda.     And I did not have allspice.  I left the other spice amounts the same.  I didn't have the right size pan so I baked it in two round cake pans (same temperature/same time).  It turned out wonderfully!  I've marked this as a favourite and I'll definitely be baking it again.

I turned this into an apple cake which really was wonderful.  I had a problem with the cooking time, the cake had to be cooked much longer as it was still raw in the middle.

This didn't have the texture that pound cakes usually have (in my experience), but it was moist and delicious.  I'll be making it again, I'm sure.  I combined the
 spice suggestions posted in some other reviews and used 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. allspice, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 3/4 tsp. cloves, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. baking soda, 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, and 1/8 tsp. cardamom.  It only took 35 minutes to be perfectly baked in my 9x13 pan and I had no trouble turning it out onto a baking sheet after letting it cool.

Additionally, I served this dusted with powdered sugar and then I spooned a simple lemon sauce over the top.   For the lemon sauce, melt 1/2 c. butter or margarine in the microwave. Whisk in 1 c. granulated sugar, 1 tsp. grated lemon peel, and 1/3 c. fresh lemon juice (for me, the juice of 2 lemons).  Add 1 egg and whisk again until blended.  Microwave on medium-high (70%) for 4 minutes, stirring at the halfway point.  It will thicken up a bit.  Serve warm.

I served it to my husband and a friend and they loved it.

This is an easy recipe that produces a lovely, moist and tender cake.  Easy to assemble means cleanup is easy and the results couldn't be better.  I baked this in a bundt pan, first time following the recipe exactly.   Great cake!  Needed nothing as far as frosting - not even a dusting of confections sugar.  Second time, substituted 1/2 C brown sugar for 1/2 C of the white sugar, and put a streusel layer in the middle.  Used greek yogurt each time and got wonderful results.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Made this for my mom's birthday cake at her request- she likes spice cake. This was a real hit with the family. I thought it needed vanilla ice cream to go with, as it was drier than I prefer (not that it wasn't moist at all, I'm admittedly finicky as far as cake goes). This cake smelled lovely baking!

It is not too often that I give a recipe such a low rating. I followed this recipe to the T and found it to have such a strange texture and a strange taste. My husband thought that it tasted like one of those cakes that you pour milk over. There was one overwhelming spice flavor in this cake, not too sure but I think it was the cloves since they tend to be a strong spice. Will not make this again.

Followed directions exactly. The cake has a wonderful flavor! The only drawback is that it is not really pretty- the cake falls just a bit (made in a 9 X 13 dish). But it is not ugly.

Followed the recipe verbatim except: Substituted half of the butter with yogurt as per the directions on another website: "When a recipe calls for butter, replace half the butter with half as much yogurt. For instance, instead of 1 cup butter, use 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup yogurt." So I used 1/2c butter and 1/4 c extra yogurt, it turned out wonderfully! Dense and moist. Used 2TB pumpkin seasoning because it was on hand, but it could've used 3 or even 4 if you like strong flavoring. Also used 2 or 3 TB lemon extract and squeezed 1/2 one fresh lemon in to the wet ingredients.   I've heard that corn starch (2TB per egg, maybe 4TB dissolved in one egg) or banana (1 small or medium banana) can substitute for eggs, next time I made this I'd probably try that and cut some calories.

This was a very tasty pound cake. I left it plain and added almond extract in addition to the vanilla. I also baked it in a 15" round pan. I had to cook it an additional 20 minutes on lower heat, but it turned out great. Very delicious.

Excellent cake.  I was looking for recipes that use plain yogurt since I had 1 1/2 lbs left-over!  I've very glad I found this recipe.  I will make it over and over again.  The confectioners sugar as a topping was just the perfect complement to moist, delicious breakfast treat.

My 9-year old daughter made this as surprise (I handled the oven).  It's her first cake and it is FABULOUS.  We had to make several changes, we used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce (we were out of butter) and we used a cake pan (no bundt - still baked for 30 minutes).  The math and chemistry of baking are so educational and then to have such a fabulous, moist result.  My daughter used the drizzle described in the most useful review BUT other than these adjustments noted, followed the recipe exactly.  New family staple.

This was delicious.  I made it in the 9x13 pan with a few changes.  I used 1 cup white and 3/4 cup brown sugar and I used 280 grams self raising cake (sponge) flour instead of the plain flour, baking soda, and salt.  I made a toffee/maple glaze for the top and we served it with double cream on the side.  Everyone loved it.

I really don't taste the yogurt.  It's very sweet to me.  It is rich and moist.  I sifted some powdered sugar on top.  This is great in the morning with a cup of coffee.

VERY good and easy cake to make!  I cut down the butter to 13 TBLS, added in 2 extra TBLS of yogurt, and used half brown sugar.  And due to my laziness I also didn't use a hand mixer, but just stirred everything together really well and baked it in a bundt pan for 55 minutes.  A very yummy cake that isn't too dense and very moist, thanks for the recipe!

Excellent cake!! Very moist & flavorful. Great for the fall season, even tho I made it in June:) Perfect to have w/coffee! I didn't have allspice so, at the suggestion on the recipe exchange here, I subbed 1/2 tsp more cinnamon, 1/4 tsp more ground cloves & 1/4 tsp more nutmeg. It was delish!

This was very good. I chose this recipe because I wanted to use up some yogurt, so I made this for breakfast. I replaced some of the white sugar with brown, added extra cinnamon and vanilla. the cake still wasn't spicy enough for me, so next time i'll add even more spice. i also added more than 1 cup of yogurt (i used about 1 1/2 cups, because the batter was very thick, and also i wanted to use up all the yogurt!) - the extra yogurt made it really nice and tangy and gave it a soft texture. i baked this in a bundt pan for 50 minutes. it probably could have done with a few more minutes, which i will allow next time, but i took it out because the top started to brown. next time i will cover with foil and bake longer. the texture was soft and squidgy, which is just the kind i like in coffee cakes - although i thick baking longer will be a bit better. this is a good recipe, but not 'amazing' - i think it needs some berries added to it, or streusel topping to make it really outstanding. i'm going to try the leftovers heated up, with some honey and vanilla ice cream on top!

This was an excellent cake!  Reminded me of something my grandmother would have made for us in the autumn.  The whole house smelled yummy while the cake was baking.  Mmmm.  Used vanilla yogurt instead of plain, dusted the finished cake with 10x and served it with freshly whipped cream and a dash of grated nutmeg.  Great!

I thought this was great! I was sceptical at first because it didn't seem that interesting but I wanted to use up some plain yogurt. It turned out bery moist and flavorfull. I sustituted half of the sugar with brown sugar and used powdered ginger instead of cloves.

This was a GREAT cake and I know I'm going to use it for tea breads all the time since it doesn't really have a cake consistency.  It's really firm and moist, but my 1 complaint is that you can taste the yoghurt in it.  Some people like that, though.

My family loves fresh fruit so I added 3 ripe peaches and it was great.  The spices really complimented the peaches. I also baked the cake in a bundt pan for about 1 hour and it cooked perfectly! Thanks for the recipe.

I loved the simplicity! Made this twice, and the recipe adapts to substitutions easily! The first time, I added pears and blueberries to the top (simmered with brown sugar briefly first), followed the rest exactly, baked for an extra 10 min in two loaf pans... Gooey fruity and spicy! The second time, used lime flavoured yogurt, lemon extract instead of vanilla, skipped the spices, added a few spoons of unsweetened flaked coconut, with coconut sprinkled on top... Tropical poundcake! Omg can't wait to experiment more. Always keep (freeze) your expired yogurt/sour cream for recipes like this! I freeze one loaf and we eat the other.

This cake came out fantastic and moist!  I beat the sugar and butter for quite some time and then added each egg, beating well, then vanilla and the yogurt.  I beat this mixture for a couple minutes then added the dry ingredients and mixed just enough to incorporate. I added a 1/2 teaspoon baking powder as others suggested.  Baked in a Bundt pan, took almost an hour.  Perfect!  This cake was so moist, I may try it without the spices or just as a cinnamon cake.  Excellent!

This was delicious - very moist and flavorful. I followed the recommendations of a reviewer and used 1/2 t baking powder, 1/2 t baking soda, 1/2 t nutmeg, 3/4 t cloves, 1 t allspice, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and a bit of salt. Tonight we are going to eat it with strawberries and whip cream.

Excellent flavor and texture! My only changes were minor: I didn't add the additional cloves out of personal preference, and I was out of Allspice so I made my own. I used 1 tsp. of this mixture in place of regular allspice: 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. cloves, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp. black pepper. The pepper is important! Gives just a hint of bite to the spice mixture. 

This is a new favorite!

I made this cake and after 45 minutes it was finally done but sunken in the middle.I've never had a cake sink before.Although the reviews you posted are good I think there's something wrong with the recipe.It also was really crumbly and didn't hold together like a cake should.could it have been the yogurt I used? and I never heard of a 9x13 cake being done in 30-35 min.Mine wasn't moist at all

Have made this twice now.  The recipe, as written, is fairly decent.  We all thought it was a bit too bland, heavy, and very sweet.  The second time, it was great.  Instead of butter, I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/4 cup yogurt.  Used only 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I also increased all of the spices a tad.  Instead of buttering and flouring the pans (I used 2 loaf pans), I buttered and then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.

Used up the last of my plain yogurt! Followed the tips from baricat, minus the mace. Had a test piece and was delish.

My whole family loved this, even my pickiest niece!  I made as is, except for adding a little more of the dry spices to give it a little more flavor.

Really,really good....One of the best cakes I've made and So easy! I did reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and it was still really sweet but very tasty and super moist. I will definitely make this again, and again and again.....YUM!

I loved the whole yogurt idea, but was disappointed.  It was a spice cake and not a POUND cake.  My hubbie ate it to be nice.  My search for a healthier pound cake continues.

Moist and delicious. I would rate this 5 stars, were it not for the fact that the recipe's servings seem off...I scaled the recipe to 2/3 (16 servings, using 2 eggs, etc.), and poured the batter into 2 loaf pans. However, they turned out rather small and would've been better in one pan. So I cut the cake into cubes and served them in dessert glasses with loosely whipped cream, toasted chopped walnuts, and a pinch of pumpkin pie spice.

This was my first attempt at a pound cake and I absolutely loved how it turned out. It made the house smell wonderful and I had several people ask me for the recipe. I did reduce the sugar and increase the spices as suggested by others.

Yum, yum, yum!!! Excellent cake! I prepared just as instructed, and decided to add a drizzle of cream cheese icing to the top. Amazing! Husband went crazy, I make cakes all of the time and he announced that this is one of his new favorites. Only thing...I had to bake for alot longer than 35 minutes, probably around 50 minutes instead. No matter, this is a keeper and I can't wait to make this for an upcoming family reunion!

I love this recipe!!!  I have made it three times already.  The first time I just sprinkled powdered sugar over it.  The cake has such a delicious flavor, so it's good enough like that. But then I took the suggestion in a few reviews and tried it with cream cheese frosting.  Yum!  It really brings out the flavor of the spices!  I didn't change anything in the recipe except I made it in a 9x13 pan instead of a bundt pan.  Oh, and I did overbake it slightly the first time, as the edges were just a little too brown for my taste (but that's my oven for ya).  Anyway, it's a great cake for any occasion!  I just really enjoy spice cakes, so I don't need an excuse such as a holiday to make it!  Enjoy!  Thanks, Georgie!

Yummy!  I used what I had on had which was fat free vanilla yogurt and I substituted the sugar for Splenda and the eggs with egg beaters.  Made as a bundt cake and just adjusted the times accordingly with my oven.  The spices really come through.  (See Photo)  Great with a cup of coffee.  Thanks Georgie

This cake was delicious. I used a bundt pan so I had to let it bake for an additional 10 minutes.  I was a little nervous about the cake coming out of the pan in one piece.  I followed the directions on greasing and flouring the pan as well as letting it sit for 15 minutes and the cake came out beautifully.  There is so much flavor in the cake, I didn't want to mask it with a frosting, so I just dusted it with powdered sugar.  I brought it into work today and my coworkers loved it!

Delicious! Fragrant, moist & delicious with tea!! It turned out really well, but I needed to bake it for about an hour until it was cooked on the inside well enough. I had a slightly smaller pan (8x11.5 I think) I dont know if that made a difference. Anyone know if this recipe can be used to make muffins too?

EDIT: It DOES make wonderful muffins! I've done this several times since posting my review.

This is a wonderful easy spice cake.  I would add nuts next time.  I make 2 8X8 cakes.  I also added a little rum to the mix and also the confection iceing I drizzle overtop.  This is a keeper!!!!

Yummy! I made this today, just for my husband and I, and it is delicious. (It was great for using up some leftover yogurt). Similar to "pumpkin bread" taste, but without the pumpkin. It's very nice and light taste, and stands alone pretty well- didn't even bother with the powdered sugar on top. Pretty easy to make, too, and not that much cleanup. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe.  It's spicy, moist, and smells like heaven as it's baking.  Georgie's right, you don't need to ice this cake, but if you're wanting something special, a not-too-sweet cream cheese icing is wonderful!  When in a pinch, I've substituted 1 Tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice for ALL of the other spices called for, and it works out well.  This has become one of my family's favorites.  Thanks, Georgie!

Wow!!!  This was incredible!  So moist, and very easy to make.  Fat-free yogurt works fine.  I made it as a Bundt cake, and baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  Very true that no frosting is necessary.  Mine didn't rise all that much, so after reading other 'from scratch' cake recipes, most all of them called for more baking soda.  I increased it to 1 tsp. the next time, but still no difference.  The next time I added 1/2 tsp. baking powder, but the cake was a little fluffy instead of dense like a pound cake.  Just leave everything as it is!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for July 4th and it was a big hit.  Very moist!  I am an icing junkie and look for any excuse to ice anything, but this cake needed no icing at all.  Didn't even last 24 hours in my house.  I will definitely make this again.  I also baked it in a bundt pan for about 60 minutes and it came out beautifully.  Pretty presentatation.

Even though my cakes/s fell flat as a pancake, I'm simply have to give this a 5* rating - it tastes THAT good.  Made exactly as directed except for baking in two loaf pans.  They were finished in 45" and I left in oven with door open as someone suggested to keep from falling, but obviously that didn't work.  Quite frankly, I don't care.  Those people who said these had no flavor are crazy.  I'm just going to stack my two little loafs with a filling of strawberries and whipped cream and guzzle it up :)  Will definately make again and thanks so much for recipe!

Amazing! I stuck to the ingredients exactly as listed. I used a bundt pan and the batter only filled it halfway. It took about 45 min to cook in the bundt. No need for glaze/frosting or even powdered sugar. It was fantastic on its own. I am excited to try this recipe in mini loaf pans to give out as holiday gifts!

UPDATE:  I accidentally bought the strawberry yogurt the last time I made it.  You MUST try.  Doesn't give it a strawberry flavor, but accentuates the other spice flavors!   AWESOME!!!!  If I could get this 100 stars - I would.  However, my stars are only limited to 5 at the most. :( Brought some to work and they all loved it!!  This cake needs NO frosting or glaze at all or it will take away from the amazing product that it is! Thank you for posting a great recipe!  Definitely a keeper!  NOT dry AT ALL, in fast very moist! Make sure to use the regular yogurt, not the light.  

I have NEVER had a recipe that is so requested by everyone who tries it. The person who said it was dry obviously overcooked or overmixed it.  I baked it in the Nordic mini bundt fancy cake non-stick pan (the one with 6 cavities) and they came out perfect!!   It made 12 of them.  But does not do well in the regular size fancy cake pans.

I can't even tell you how many times I have made this. :)

Also, when stored correctly, this is still just as moist several days after.  Any cake that is left out for any length of period without any sort of protection will dry out.

New update, but really no change, I just wanted to make sure that everyone knows that this is the BEST cake out there!  lol  This is my go to recipe for ANY occasion where I need an awesome, unique, great dessert! :)

Followed several different suggestions - added the 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1 cup honey vanilla greek yogurt, 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce, 3/4 tsp baking powder. Made in two loaf pans - cooked one with sliced spiced apples on bottom and powdered sugar on top. The other I used a simple light homemade cream cheese frosting with a 1/4 tsp allspice. Cooking time was exactly 35 min. Brought to work and they were gone within 15 minutes.

I'm not a big fan of pound cake, but this recipe was great. Not too sweet, just enough spice. The cake needs no icing or frosting. Although a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side adds a lot. I did make three changes though. I left out the cloves, didn't think they were necessary, I didn't have any yogurt on hand so I subbed with sour cream, and I only used 2 cups of flour.

I definitely will not make this again. It was very funny tasting. It must have been the yogurt, because I've made many spice cakes before usually with apples, but this one was not edible to me nor my husband. Although the texture was fine for a pound cake, I just didn't care for the taste.

Really good recipe.  I had some plain yogurt to use up and this recipe worked out great.  I didn't have any cloves so I left them out.  Tasted great and will definitely make again!

This cake was exceptional. It was really moist and delicious. I even had two pieces in one sitting! Can't remember the last time I did that. I topped it with walnuts, whipped cream, and a drizzle of caramel sauce. It was fantastic!

I have tried and experimented with "Spice Cakes" throughout the years and this one is my absolute favorite!  It's just perfect.  I found that I had to bake it about 5 minutes longer (may have been my oven) and I tend to use Egg Beaters instead of eggs and it's still just great.   I definitely give this one a 5-star rating!

Yummy.  This cake was sooo moist.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I changed was that I doubled all the spices.  Cakes are never spicy enough for me so it seemed like a good idea.  It was perfect!  I'll make this again for sure.  Thanks for the recipe.

Cake tasted really good but was stuck SOLID to silicone bakeware (3 different items) that I have never had to grease before.  I have a different cake in the oven now to take to work tomorrow.  Might make a trifle out of the pieces.

I have tried this recipe twice and it is definitely too dense. I don't know if it is too much butter or too much yogurt but there is definately too much of something in this pound cake. I have given up on this recipe and I am on the look out for a lighter pound cake.

This was superb!  I followed the suggestions from a fellow reviewer: 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 mace, 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I heavily floured and greased the pan and baked it for 45 min.  It was peeeerfect!  I drizzled some icing on it (2 tbsp milk, 1 tbsp margarine, 1 cup icing sugar).  This was a great recipe!  This was my first time making a pound cake.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe!  Thanks!

This was a big hit. I made a couple of changes. I used equivalent cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. I used non fat vanilla yogurt. I baked it in mini-bundt pans and a 6 fluted cake pan. It did not take as long to bake--between 25-30 min. I used confectioner's sugar to top it as suggested.The taste was exquisite. Very light fine texture with the perfect amount of spice. Some of the other reviewers had to bake longer than suggested. I baked less, and I'm not sure if it was the small pans, the cake flour or a combination of both--but I had no problems with it getting cooked.

It's been 4 years since I submitted this recipe--my how time goes by--well I just wanted to say that originally I did use a bundt pan but it would take so very long to bake so I thought that it would be better to suggest using a 9 x 13 pan. The five star rating is for all the wonderful people and their very kind and generous reviews. Also I sometimes drizzle a sugar glaze over the cake or use vanilla or cream cheese frosting too. My family still insists that I make this cake for the holidays. Enjoy!  ALSO, please make sure you use a full 1 cup (8 ounces) of the yogurt as the yogurt they sell today is only 6 oz and less yogurt will cause a dryer cake.

Love this cake!  I made it in two loaf pans and cooked it for 45 minutes on 325F.  The only problem I had was that it 'fell' after I took it out of the oven.  Next time, I'll turn the oven off after 45 minutes and leave the loaves in the oven until it is cool (they were a little under cooked, despite the fact that my toothpick check was clean).

Great recipe!

Just made this a few hours ago- it's still warm! I used 1 cup brown sugar/1 cup white sugar. The batter was so thick that I was frightened I'd ruined it. It turned out so beautiful! It cooked for 50 minutes in a bundt pan (in Oregon), tastes like pumpkin bread (basically), and the texture is soft, moist and it MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH! I'll definitely be making this again!

I should have reviewed this cake long ago.  I have been making it for some time now, it is a favorite in this house.  Three out of four kids request this cake as their "you can have anything you want" birthday cake.  That says alot!!  Easy, moist, and a crowd pleaser...perfect...thank you!

This cake didn't turn out as dense as a store-bought pound cake as I had hoped it would.  But it was very good nonetheless.  Kept well as I baked it on Sat for Sunday morning church.  Very moist and good spice flavor.  I used orange yogurt hoping that might add a twist, but it didn't make a difference that I could notice.  Perfect with a cup of coffee.  Definitely easy to make and since it makes so much it's perfect for large groups.  I think someone called it "AWESOME".  :o)  Will definitely make again.

This cake is wonderful!  I did cook it (1 hour) in a tube pan as someone suggested (1 hour) and dusted it with confectioner's sugar as someone else suggested.  It is a pretty cake, nice flavor, nice crumb, and just spicy enough.

If I'd never had pound cake in my life then perhaps you could fool me into believing that this is pound cake. This isn't pound cake, nor is it tasty, even after doubling the spices. No thank you.

Really good. I did add a bit more of the spices.   Very light and moist and wonderfully slightly cheery outer crust. Wish I had made whipped cream but I would have eaten it all as my family doesn’t care for it. The cake is just delicious. The secret is after creaming sugar  and butter for around 2 min at Med speed, mix remaining on lowest speed and only until incorporated. Do not over mix. Excellent recipe. Thank you!

I have made this cake every year for the past 3 years for husband's February birthday and we love it! I make in round cake pans for layered cake and use plain greek yogurt. Also frost with a spiced cream cheese frosting.

The cake is delicious. I took the advice of previous reviews (Thanx!). I used 1/2 c of reduced fat butter, 1/2 c applesauce  and 1 cup non fat Greek vanilla yogurt. Used the rest of the measurements from recipe. Also added bits of apple, cinnamon, brown sugar and pecans mixture to the bottom of bundt pan and top.
Next time I'll try making the cake with Splenda.

I wish I had read the reviews before making. I followed the directions to a T, and got a very tasty cake,  it the texture was all wrong, especially for pound cake. I will make it again using one reviewer's suggested changes (particularly adding baking powder in addition to the baking soda. I also agree that the heavy beating should be done with the wet ingredients, then turning the dry ingredients into the wet mixture. My friends are looking forward to the new improved version. I'll also be beefing up the spices.

I followed the recipe, but added a tad more cinnamon and allspice. Used vanilla Greek yoghurt. Made it in a bundt pan and total baking time was approximately one hour. Moist and delicious.

I added fresh minced ginger and peeled and diced apples to this recipe and it turned out great. Next time I make it, I'll probably bump up the amounts of spices just a bit but, this was a really nice cake made in a 9x13 pan.

I cut the sugar by  quarter and topped it with chopped pecans. I was out of allspice so used ginger in its place. It was still VERY sweet and delicious! Served with whipped cream.

I made this in a Pampered Chef stone bunt pan and I will definitely make it again. However, one must bake it for 1 hour (or until toothpick comes out clean). I served it at a summer dinner party  with the Green Grape Salad from this site and it was a hit.

I made this into two 8 x 8 pans. It turned out just rather ugly. It was dark and took a lot longer than I expected to cook through. But… I was so surprised when we tasted it. Amazing! I used Nancy's plain yogurt and fresh nutmeg. Like another reviewer, I made a glaze and then topped with some candied walnuts. But that was really just make it look better. The cake itself, has a lovely crumb and a very sophisticated flavor. Highly recommend. Next time I will try it in a bun and hopefully that will improve the finished look.

Georgie, what a yummy cake - thanks for sharing the recipe. I did however alter it according to my taste: reduced to 1.5 cups of Sugar (was still a bit too sweet then, will try 1&1/4 c next time); added 1 tsp Baking Powder; added 1/4 tsp ground elachi (cardomom). The cake does get a bit dry, even when stored in an airtight container, if eaten after the day you make it but yummy nonetheless, with tea.

This cake was wonderful - with my slight changes.  I used 2 containers (5.3 oz. each) of fruit-flavored Greek yogurt because that is what I had; this made just a tad more than 1 cup, but the fruit would account for that extra so I used all of it, and did NOT thin it at all.  I also followed a previous review and added 1/2 tsp. baking powder to lighten the texture a little.  By using the conventional method to mix the batter, it turned out with a velvety texture, and the flavor was great.  (Conventional mixing means:  cream butter & sugar till fluffy, then beat in eggs one at a time; add vanilla.  Sift together flour, spices, salt, baking soda and baking powder; add to batter alternately with yogurt, beating only until blended.)  I baked the cake in a bundt pan that has a dark non-stick surface, so I always reduce the baking temp by 25 degrees, and I always grease & flour the pan to be sure the cake will come out in one piece.  It took about 60 minutes to bake, tested  with a toothpick to be sure it was done.  Let the cake rest in the pan for 15 minutes (so the structure sets), then turn out onto cake platter to finish cooling.  And I don't always let it cool completely before cutting a slice to sample!!

I like to cut recipes in half often and I did with this one, using only one egg and pumpkin flavored yogurt.  Baked in an 8x8 pan.  Turned out great, very moist. May have to jack up the spices a bit with plain yogurt, when seasonal pumpkin is not available.

I have made this cake for 40 years.  Occasionally, I'll substitute lemon yogurt and lemon extract for the yogurt and vanilla respectively.  This is a great cake to experiment with different flavors.  It is always moist!

This cake is superb with a few changes. I used strawberry banana yogurt with fruit pieces instead of plain yogurt.  I added 1/2 tsp mace and 1/2 tsp cardamon.  I added 1 tsp lemon flavor and 1 tsp pear essence.  I used 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder.  I creamed the sugar and butter than added the eggs one by one and mixed well.  I added the dry ingredients alternately with the yogurt ending with the yogurt.  The batter was too thick and I added a little bit more yogurt.  The result; a light, fluffly like a cloud cake and cupcakes!This recipe is a keeper!!!

I like this recipe.  I didn't have plain yogurt, so I used a 6oz. cup on Chobani strawberry yogurt and added about 1/4 cup milk.  I went light on the spices and baked it in a bundt pan. It turned out moist with just a hint of the strawberry flavor.  I will make this cake again.

A tasty, light and easy to make spiced cake - I followed the recipe only reducing the sugar by half and baking in a bunt pan.

This is a lovely cake. Rich, moist, fluffy, soft, delicious. I followed the recipe precisely but I added 1 cup chopped walnuts for a little crunch and it was divine. It is so irresistable right out of the oven. The crust has a nice crisp to it. Don't ruin that lovely crust with a glaze! A light dusting of powder sugar is all it really needs. Definitely a keeper.

Well, I made this delicious cake and it was a hit at my dinner the other night.  I baked it in a bundt pan and added sugar glaze to finish.

Very easy to make.  Does need lots more time if you bake in a bundt pan rather than the recommended 9 x 13.  A teensy bit on the dry side but got rave reviews from the ladies in my sorority.

Just made this cake and am eating it warm. I did sift some powdered sugar over the top when I took it out of the oven. It's moist and just the right amount of spices. I did reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup. Would make this one again.

This cake is so wonderful.  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  And it got better the day after.  (Made an especially yummy breakfast!)  My only complaint is that the center of the cake was much denser than the rest of the cake, and looked darker.  But it was cooked through and it still tasted good.  I will definitely make this again.

Just made this and it's good!   I had no allspice or ground clove so I made it without those spices.  It came out moist and tasty!  It is almost to sweet for my taste thats why I only gave it 4 stars!

YUM! i used 2 sticks of light buter and took others' advice about watching spice amounts and beating time -- after flour is added, careful on the beating. also, used egg beaters and vanilla yogurt instead of plain yogurt (omit the vanilla extract) baked in a bundt pan, 45-50 mins @ 350 . . . a really simple-to-make cake that is soooo addictive!

I added 1/2 tsp baking powder to lighten it, 1-1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp freshly ground nutmeg, 1 tsp allspice, 3/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/4 tsp mace. Baked it in a greased and floured bundt pan for one hour at 350. Also, I agree with previous poster not to "beat for 2 minutes" after adding the flour. I didn't glaze (although you could) - I just dusted lightly with powdered sugar.  A wonderful fall recipe!

A really wonderful flavour. I followed it to a tee(highly unusual for me as I like to alter everything!)It did stick to my 'fancy' bundt pan, it has many ridges..so next time I will be sure to grease and flour much better.

Made by the recipe except added a touch more cinnamon and nutmeg.  I baked in two 9-inch square pans and it still turned out great - a bit thin so next time I'll use 8-inch pans.  Definitely no icing needed!

My guests seemed to like this, but I would give it only 3 stars.  I added extra spice like people suggested, but I think it could have used even more.  The consistency and moisture were really good, however.

I love itt..i'm a beginner baker, and usually when i bake cakes it turns out kind of heavy and sticky, but this turn out quite fluffy and light! Does anyone have any ideas about adding other ingredients?? cause i want to bake other cakes but have the exact texture like this one... oh and mine is still a little bit sticky on the top..it's done, but when your finger touches it, it's kind of sticky..any idea why this happens, or is it natural?

My cake fell in the middle! :( But I blame myself for opening the oven early in the baking to check on it.  Never-the-less, this is a very tasty, moist cake.  It is lighter than a traditional pound cake and delicately spiced.  Those who like their cakes very spicy may wish to increase the amount of spices slightly. After trying it plain (which was delicious!) I brushed on a lemon glaze made with 1 cup powdered sugar and 3 TBS lemon juice.  I will definitely try this cake again.

This was very tasty.  Be sure to give the butter plenty of time to soften.  My bundt cake turned out like an oversized donut, however.  I left it in the oven (as another reviewer suggested) while the oven cooled but it didn't help.  I'd make this again but probably not in the bundt pan.  Also, I made the glaze (1T butter, 1T whole milk, 1 1/2 C powdered sugar) suggested by another reviewer and that turned out very nicely.

Wonderful flavor!  It's a nicely delicate spiced cake.  I added 1/8 tsp of cardamom to the rest but that's all I added.  I usually prefer to rate the recipe exactly as it is given here, otherwise I'm rating MY version of the recipe instead, but since this was such a small addition, it wouldn't change it significantly.  And this is a GREAT cake!  Light, tasty and not at all bland.  The only problem I had was that it still stuck in spite of a heavy greasing and flouring of the pan.  So it remains a sheet cake from now on, that's all!  It's still WAY worth making.  It's a simple one to make so go ahead and try this one.  I think you'll love it too.

We absolutely loved this! It was moist and had the taste of a pumpkin pie. I used margarine instead of butter and 1 1/4tsp of pumpkin pie spice in place of both the cloves and allspice. I had to bake it for 45 minutes because it was still gooey at 35. I didn't frost it because it really didn't need any but I bet a cream cheese icing would be fantastic.

I thought...this one has to be a winner, with five stars and positive reviews.  Wrong!  The only change I made was to make this recipe in loaf pans.  The cake tested done after an hour but was raw and heavy inside.  The flavor was good, and the exterior nice and brown, but the interior was raw.  I've always used loaf pans and 9x13 pans interchangeably, so I blame the recipe.

This was very good.  Moist, holds it's shape when sliced, and the yogurt adds a nice creamy note.  I served it with strawberries and whipped cream, and it was a hit.  I will definitely make this again!

I've just finished making this cake.  The whole house smells wonderful:) I made it in a bundt pan and baked it 50min.  Somehow I expected a bigger cake....maybe I did something wrong. Doesn't matter though the taste is wonderful.

What a lovely cake.  Great texture and flavor.  I used unsalted butter, whole milk yogurt, reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and was out of cloves so added cardamon in its place.  I baked this cake in a tube pan for 60 min.  My family loved it.

I absolutely love spice cake and make one for my birthday every year. This year I chose this recipe because of the amount of spices it uses. I was not disappointed! It was the best I have ever made. I did substitute buttermilk for the yogurt and I frosted it with a cream cheese frosting. Next time I'm going to try the Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting just to "kick it up another notch".
