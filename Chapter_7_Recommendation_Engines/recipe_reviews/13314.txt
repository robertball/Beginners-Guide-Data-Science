This is a great recipe! Adding and substituting did not mess up the recipe. I used 1 can of creamed corn, and 1 regular corn and it worked. I sauted red bell pepper with the onion for color and flavor and it was wonderful. I also added basil, and a little garlic. I will use this recipe again-- Thanks for sharing!

I really enjoyed this chowder.  I added some crumbled bacon to sprinkle on top.
It was a really crowd pleaser!

Fantastic! I added a potato (diced) and bay leaf along with a little hot sauce. Very hearty soup - would make a great recipe when you have your vegetarian friends over and don't know what to cook for them. Imagine having this soup waiting for you in the crockpot when you finish shoveling out from underneath the latest snow storm.

Very tasty and what I really like is that this recipe used ingredients that I already had on hand.  It didn't last long.  My son ate all of it in less than 24 hours.  This recipe is a keeper.

Oh, this was so delicious! I added potatoes as suggested by others, but probably would have liked it just as well without them. This chowder was filling and oh so yummy. I'll definitely make it again!

This came out great even though I used skim milk and chedder instead of preccessed cheese. It probably would have been even yummier with whole milk. I doubled the reciepe and added a couple large potatoes cut up pretty small. I was worried the potatoes would add to the cooking time, but overall the whole thing took about an hour..not bad! Next time I would do whole milk and mabey a little seasoning. (The chedder DOES seperate, but I didnt want my soup to taste like velveta)

This chowder is wonderful!  And so easy to make.  It is a hearty soup.  I used 2 cups of milk and 2 cups of light cream to make it a little richer.  That is the only change I made to this recipe.  I would proudly serve this to friends and family.

This chowder was good; however, it was a bit thin. I used 1 can of creamed corn and 1 can of whole kernel corn. I also used more cheese for a sharper taste. It was very good!

A very nice basic chowder.  I wanted one that didn't include potatoes and this was quick and easy and hit the spot.  I followed the directions exactly.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I added a lot- carrots, green peppers, potatoes, chicken and bacon- and used cheddar cheese. Yum! It was delicious. Smooth, thick, with a yummy flavor.

Loved it. I followed advice, used bay leaf, potato, hot sauce, and it was amazing. I would add more cheese next time and try a sharper cheddar.

What a great soup for a chilly November day.  I took the advice of others and put in some sliced potatoes, crumbled bacon, and cheddar cheese instead of processed. Delicious!  I will be making this again very soon.

This is so delicious! I used 2-12oz cans of fat free evaporated milk & 1 cup water since that was what I had on hand & added cubed potatoes.  It was so creamy and easy to make! I can't wait to make it again! Brought it to a pot luck and everyone loved it!

This was a great recipe with a great flavor as is.  My personal preferences make me want to add lots of "stuff" to it like some chicken and maybe some veggies to make it more of a chicken corn chowder because I like my soups more chunky.  But, my 7 year old has been obsessed with Chip & Dale lately and if you have seen the episode where they make Cheese Chowder then you know why she requested me find a Cheese Chowder recipe to try out.  She loved it and said "10 stars mom!".

This is a family favorite in my house and probably the best recipe I have found on allrecipies in the past 7 years! I add garlic and 1/2 of a red bell pepper to the butter saute. Another change is to use sharp cheddar in place of American cheese.

I used fresh corn (about 6-7 ears) and also added 4 oz cream cheese. So yummy and easy to make. We have made this many times. I use a stick blender at the end to puree everything except for some of the corn which I add after pureeing.

i mistakenly opened a can of creamed corn instead of corn kernels so i searched for a recipe which uses creamed corn that required simple preparation. this i reduced the recipe yield to half since i only had 1 can of creamed corn. turned out very good. i'd probably reduce the flour next time since mine turned out a little too thick but flavors-wise it's good. 

i reheated some today and it became thicker. so i thought of topping it with some sour cream and using it as a nacho dip. very good too!

This soup didn't have very much flavor at all but was edible.

I love this chowder.  My whole family liked even though they are pretty picky.  I did not add salt or pepper but I did add potatoes.

I loved this! I followed the other reviewers advice and sauted onion and red bell pepper together to add. I only had lowfat milk and didnt have enough, so I subbed about 1 cup with lowfat plain greek yogurt to thicken a little.

I followed others suggestions and added potatoes and peppers, a bay leaf and sprinkled with bacon, it still tasted like cans of creamed corn.

I added three slices of bacon and five diced up baby red potatos (pre cooked). Doubled the onion and used two cups of cheese. I'm sure I reversed the salt and pepper, I didn't measure either. But heavy pepper and little salt. The flavor was amazing the the texture was perfect.

Can’t beat how fast this goes together! Added some additional seasoning , green pepper, and frozen corn. Only had a cup and a half of milk in the house and it was perfect amount of soup for my husband and self.

Turned out great. I made similar additions as other users. Added 1tsp minced garlic and sauted with the onions. Also added approx a dozen baby potatoes diced and an extra 2 cups of milk to compensate for potatoes. Up'd the cheese to 2 cups and let it all cook for an hour, stirring frequently. Left sitting covered on the burner while the burner cooled, enough heat to finish cooking taters without it burning or sticking and was perfectly warm to eat nearly 2hrs later. Definitely make again!

I live in rural West Africa, so just substituted my husband's garden corn for the canned creamed corn, and edam cheese for American cheese. It was a hit with everyone at the table! (One of my guests is allergic to potatoes, so I came to allrecipes to find an appropriate recipe. So grateful you can indicate which ingredients you do not want included!)

I added 2 cans of reg corn as well as 2 small cans of green chili's to add some flavor. I added a little cayenne to give it some heat. Was an enjoyable recipe. I make it very often. Affordable and filling.

I made this using dried minced onion and added a seasoning blend of garlic, pepper and onion powder. It is really good and is a hit with my family.  I also used fresh corn the I cut off the cob and chopped up, no canned stuff here :)

Used everything in the recipe (except the creamed corn since I didn't have any on hand). I also added 2 potatoes that I microwaved, a can cream of celery soup, 2 chicken bouillon cubes, a few sprinkles of crushed red peppers and a splash of pepper vinegar to taste. Will definitely make this again! ;)

Not bad but it could use more salt and some black pepper in addition to the white pepper. Consider adding some bacon as well.

I tried this recipe and the soup was delicious. I wish the recipe was a bit more specific in terms of cooking temperatures. I used cheddar cheese instead of american. I look forward to experimenting a little with some spices to give the soup a bit more flavor.

This recipe was so easy and delicious! I did modify the seasoning by using salt and black pepper to taste, garlic powder and a little bit of cayenne. I even got permission from my boyfriend to make this again, and he isn't as wild about corn chowder as I am.

This recipe is easy and delicious! I recommend only using 2 cups of milk instead of 4. Also, I used one can of creamed corn and then one can of fiesta mix corn. It added a little spice and color. I also added a little chili powder and cayenne pepper.

This was a good chowder, although it needed a little boost...I added garlic to the onions. I used 1 can of creamed corn and fresh corn from one ear. I also added potato and red bell pepper. It tasted even better as left-overs!
