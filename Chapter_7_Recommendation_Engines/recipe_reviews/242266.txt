I cooked my bacon separately since I am picking about bacon. Such a basic recipe you can add anything you desire. I added green onions and served with homemade salsa, sliced avocados.  My whole family enjoyed the meal and I have two picky eaters.

Some reviews indicated it was a bit bland so I used breakfast sausage instead of bacon and a nacho cheese sauce along with half of the cheddar.  guests asked for the recipe!

I used this recipe to start me out and made some changes. I used vegetarian sausage patties (which I browned first) instead of bacon and I mixed two packets of country gravy mix (omitting the salt and pepper) into the eggs. It cooked up very nicely in the recommended hour and the flavor was wonderful!

I made this at the Fire Station and the guys loved it!!! I made two trays of it. It took 50 min to be perfectly done... One tray I put yellow onion and green chilies and the other I followed the recipe. We topped it with Ranch and salsa, and it was amazing!

Made some changes mostly due to serving size, which turned out to be 4 very large portions.  Also just used everything I had in the fridge and pantry.

Used 8 eggs instead of 12.  Mixed 6 eggs with about 1/3 cup heavy cream, salt, pepper, garlic powder, 1tsp of thai chili sauce, and about 1.5 cups of fine shredded Mexican cheese blend.  

Cut up 1/2 pound bacon in 1" chunks, sautéed about 10 minutes, cooked but not crispy at all.  Threw in some jalapeños, scallion, roasted peppers, spinach, on top of bacon and sautéed another 5 minutes.  

Sprayed an 8" round casserole, dumped in the tater tots on the bottom.  Combined the egg mixture with the meat and veggies and poured on top.  Whisked up 2 more eggs and poured on top.  

Baked about 55 minutes, just until the egg didn't run when I put a fork in the center.  Tasted great, definitely not bland.

This was so easy and delish! I made it on Christmas morning. I cooked and diced the bacon the night before, then threw it all together in five minutes. (I didn't know if I could make the whole thing ahead, given that the potatoes are frozen.) I used Crispy Crowns instead of Tater Tots and omitted the milk (by accident), but it was excellent!

Not happy with the taste of the potatoes.  I think this would be good with fresh sauted potatoes replacing the over-processed tater tots.

I've made something like this for years.  However I cook 1lb of pork or turkey sausage (instead of bacon) then pour in 1 can of cheddar cheese and mix those 2 together, then spread on top of the tater tots, pour the egg/milk mixture on top of that, it is delicious!!!!

Hubby and kids liked this more than I did.  I think the addition of onions or green chilies would be good.  They smothered theirs with ketchup, I used salsa to perk it up a bit.  It is easy to toss together and cuts well.  I imagine it would re-warm well for a on the go breakfast.

Easy to make and was a hit. I made it for a family brunch and there wasn’t any leftovers.  I plan on making for Christmas Day too.  Side note: why do people write “reviews “ where they really just are writing a new recipe?  If you want to submit your own recipes then please do so. Stick to reviewing the actual recipe!

Great recipe. Added a few spices - onion powder, garlic powder, cajun seasoning and two extra large eggs (14 total). Very good. Fed 14 and everyone loved it.

My 4 star rating is based on the recipe as written.  Made it, enjoyed it.  Very good!  But...after seeing all the other tweaks.  I'd like to report I made it the THIRD time with a can of cream of cheese soup mixed in with with 1 lb. of breakfast sausage with chopped onion and put THAT in the bottom of the pan.  Then, pre-cooked crowns NOT tots with cajun seasoning on them.   Put some cheddar over sausage mixture, then put the cajun-crowns over THAT.  Melted 1/2 stick of butter with garlic powder and hot sauce and poured it over the crowns.  Added 1 1/2 tspns of dry mustard to the eggs, salt & pepper and 3/4 cup milk.  Tossed some cheese in the eggs.  Poured that over top of crowns.  Put some sliced green onions on top and baked.  Pulled the casserole out at 45 minutes and put the remaining cheese over the top.  Put back in the oven for 4-5 minutes to melt the cheese.  Delicious!

I have made this many times, usually for dinner. We love it every time! I’ve even added mushrooms and spinach. I use almond milk and a dairy free cheese because of food allergies. Big family hit!

Did as the recipe called for and we all loved it. Made it for  Xmas breakfast. I used too small of a pan and it took longer to cook  but, still tasted great. Will definitely make it again.

I stayed with the original recipe.  It was quick and tasty.  It didn't totally blow me away, but will keep in in my file because it was easy and seemed to please everyone.

I used pre cooked sausage as well as bacon, I also cooked the tater tots first, and added green onion, as well as onion powder and garlic powder. It turned out fabulous. My boyfriend  loves it and requested I make more for him to take for breakfast at work.

I followed the directions and used the ingredients exactly as written. In fact I took it out of the oven at 45mins. It was dry and just lacking in something. I won’t be making it again.

I made this yesterday for a gathering and received good reviews. I didn't watch the video and made the bacon in the oven and didn't tear it up into small pieces. I will do that next time. It was not suggested to spray the pan first with no-stick spray and I will definitely do that next time The pan is still soaking! Someone suggested serving sour cream on the side as you do for potato pancakes as the dish reminded her of that. Something to keep in mind.

I think this is my favorite breakfast casserole.  I use to serve it with cinnamon rolls when my son was young and had friends  stay overnight.  They would always gobble it right up.

I added some garlic powder, onion flakes and red pepper flakes.  I will probably add more next time as it needed more flavor.  I also lost the flavor of the bacon and wonder if crumpling some up in the egg and/or putting it on top would help bring back some of that flavor.  Also, I cooked it uncovered and the cheese was crispy, almost to the point of being hard.  I might try covering it while cooking it and then taking the cover off for the last five minutes so the cheese is less hard.  It is definitely worth trying again.

My wife makes this every other week for breakfast. Often we use precooked and crumbled breakfast sausage. We make it in the slow cooker, ours has a "keep warm" feature. She puts it in right before bed for 2 1/2 hours on low, the rest of the cooking happens before she wakes in the morning. She loves having a warm breakfast to wake up to, and saves the rest for the rest of the week.

This is a good basic recipe.   We do not care for chilies, peppers, tomatoes, hot sauce, etc. . . Almost all recipes call for today.  My casserole came out beautiful at 50 minutes.  Before cooking the bacon, I cut each bacon strip into fourths.  I had no difficulty when it was served with whole strips of bacon being pulled out because you couldn't cut through the bacon.  Every bite had bacon.  I read some reviews that stated the casserole was a little dry.  After layering the tater tots over the bacon, I poured one stick of melted butter over the tater tots (extra flavor and calories). I used 3/4 cup of milk.  I put some cheese over the tater tot layer.  I saved the rest of the cheese (i used 3 cups instead of 2 cups), to put over the casserole the last 5 minutes to melt it without making the cheese hard but bubbly.  Lastly I used 1 teaspoon of cumin in the egg mixture.  I did not add salt or pepper.  The bacon, butter, and cheese had enough salt.  Family loved it so will definately make again!

I added a half of a onion (chopped)and a bit of chopped red pepper as well as a touch of dry mustard. I think it may have been a bit bland without these additions.

I had leftover ham, so I diced it, added some onions and used pepper jack cheese. I made about 6 servings. Still took an hour to cook. I’ll make it again!

Really good. I used sausage (links, cooked and cut up) and ham instead of the bacon. 14 eggs, and cooked for only 45 min before it was done. very tasty.

This recipe was so easy and so delicious and we had a little bit of everything on hand and cooked the bacon the night before so Christmas day was easy. And this was EASY!! 

No need to tweak this at all and it was so flavorful as is. I changed the serving size to 3 servings as my husband has a big appetite and used 4 eggs. The cooking time you'll have to pay attention to, I cooked this for 35-40 minutes (either is good) at 350 degrees. 

This was a hit perfect for just my husband and I and listed under my favorites for in the future for breakfast or even for Christmas mornings in the future

The flavor was great, but there was a bit too much liquid on the bottom. Needs something to absorb it maybe use thawed tator tots or fresh potatoes. I used breakfast sausage instead of bacon and added some cheese to the egg mixture. Along with some paprika and dry mustard. It was fluffy and melty with a salty spice from the sausage. Yum!

It was good, but a little boring.  Needs a little more spice for my liking.  I'm gonna try replacing the bacon with pork sausage and see if that adds a little more flavor.

This was a super easy recipe that came together quickly. I added onions to my casserole and used the OreIda Crowns. I think the onions made a good addition. It was very good leftover as well and a good breakfast to take to work.

It was a very easy recipe.  I used the recipe as a pattern.  I used sausage instead of bacon, added a small diced onion and some mild green chili peppers.  I used packaged sharp cheddar cheese, but the cheese was dry.  From now on I will freshly grate the cheddar...it's not that difficult.  We served it for our annual priests golf tournament.  They loved it.

Worked out great, I did cook the bacon first also.  Next time I will mix some of the cheddar cheese into the egg mixture!

This was good for a basic recipe, but was dry and needed more/different seasoning or vegetables added.

I made this breakfast casserole this morning and it is delicious.  I was hoping to make it the day before and bake when I woke, but I could not find any other casseroles using potatoes that were prepared in advance.  This dish is easy and delicious!

This was great.  Really simple and easy.  I made it for dinner and everyone loved it. The casserole is massive.  Instead of 8 servings, we got 16.  It reheats well though, so that's no problem.

Delicious and very simple to make.  I topped this with dill pickle relish and ketchup.  The family loved it.
