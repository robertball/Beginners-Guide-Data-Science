This recipe has remarkable potential!  I made it exactly as indicated, but the mayonnaise was overwhelming and the yogurt was lost in the mixture.  I will make it again w/ some tweaks.

Five stars for the grilled squash.  We loved it, without the sauce.  
The sauce is not great.  I decided to switch the amounts of yogurt and mayonnaise and it was much better.  Did not add taco sauce but added Asian chili sauce.  Very light and tangy.  We put it on grilled chicken marinated in a yogurt & lemon sauce.  Very good.

I really enjoyed the end result. However, when I first made the sauce and taste tested it, all I tasted was mayo. I added a lot more taco sauce and paprika, and a little more yogurt. I also added some tabasco for a little extra kick.
