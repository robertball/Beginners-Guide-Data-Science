It was way too vinegary and way too sweet almost losing any flavor the bacon may give this.  I would not make it again.

I was leary of the relish, but I followed the recipe accordingly. I'm not sure I understand the reason for baking this dish. After baking it as directed, it never browned. When we ate it, it reminded me of a bean salad but it was too tart for us. It had a very good taste, just too much vinegar. If I make this again, I will cut back on the amount of vinegar and sugar too. Instead of baking it, I will refrigerate it and let it sit for a few hours until chilled before I serve it, or wait until the next day. :)
