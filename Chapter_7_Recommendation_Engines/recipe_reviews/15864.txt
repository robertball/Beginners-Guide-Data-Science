Really tasty! I added dried currants as I didn't have quite enough golden raisins. I think next time I'd soak them in a shallow dish, rather than a bowl, for better soaking. I added more Whiskey per the suggestions. Nice! I forgot to top with powdered sugar, oops! That would have helped with presentation. I poked holes in the cake with a toothpick prior to drizzling with the glaze (which I made with half the recommended sugar). That helped with moistness. The cake goes nicely with a bit of whipped cream, and tastes great the next day too, for breakfast.

I LOVE this cake.  Every St. Patrick's day my husband anticipates the corned beef, etc.; this cake is my reward for making that vile stuff for him.  As to the cake, I make it exactly as written.  Having made this several years, I have noticed that there is a significant taste difference depending on the quality of whiskey used.  This year I used Redbreast pot distilled whiskey (aged 12 years), and it was out of this world (albeit a bit pricey - if you like whiskey, though, it's absolutely worth it).

Made this cake yesterday and was not impressed.  The batter wa as thick as cookie dough and it was a very dry cake.  Had to bake longer because it was so thick.  I had thought of using a bigger pan when I was preparing this, but after making it, I have just decided not to make again.

Just made this cake, smells amazing! It was easy to prepare aswell. I was worried about the cookie dough texture until I folded in the egg whites which made the batter smooth. I won't be doing the glaze this time as I need to transport it to work!

What a great cake, I glazed it with  a butter/water/jameson's whiskey and sugar mix.  I let the fruit mix sit overnight in a tea/lemon /whiskey mix

This turned out to be a cookie recipe and not a cake. Also, it was gooey, so I cooked it for 60 minutes, still too gooey, then put it back in for another 15 minutes and it came out a little dry.
