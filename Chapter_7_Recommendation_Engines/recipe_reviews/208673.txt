This was quite good. It made it to my box. I cut the fish a little smaller than suggested so that my taco was easier to hold. I also added a little bit of mexican seasonings to the flour mixture just for flavor. I completly skipped the poppy dressing and used salsa on top only because we are mexican and thats how we eat everything!

This sounds so delicious, but I didn't want to have so many calories in just one taco... so I followed the recipe except I grilled the fish instead of frying and I subbed 1/2 cup of salsa for the dressing. I also used an extremely small amount of salt, just to season the fish before grilling (along with pepper). I The avocados drenched in lime were so good, and really made the whole meal. Thanks for a great base recipe!

Very easy recipe and very good!   I used cod fish.  I had green cabbage and that worked just fine.  Instead of the poppy seed dressing, my hubby used Dorothy Lynch dressing and I used Chipolte Mayo.

I grilled the fish instead of frying it and used the Honey Poppy Seed Dressing from this website.  Delicious!

I used a cole-slaw mix in place of the red cabbage.  These were good - the avocados gave it a different twist. We used cod for our fish.  We had margaritas to go with them.

This is delicious, I added salsa to ours too and it gave it that extra zip that may have been missing without it. I also forgot to buy red cabbage so had to use leaf lettuce instead and the lettuce worked really well.

So I just got done making this and it turned out pretty good. I used pollock and it was the first time I have ever eaten a fish taco. It's also the first time I've ever eaten any type of fish besides catfish. Needs a little work but definitely a keeper. Thank you!

this was yummy but could have had some more interesting flavours. I would make the proportions bigger, 6 serves for 5 people worked for me. The avacado and the fish really went well together and i think it was a yummy meal.

So good. Loved the lime taste in the aacados.. Don't skimp on cilantro, it adds a nice touch. I didn't use red cabbage, used a cole slaw mix with green and red mixed and also carrots..tasted great...

Very easy to make. I made a few changes with what I had in the fridge. I added some fresh chopped tomatoes to the avacodos and some Tonys seasoning. I seasoned the fish with Tonys before putting it in flour. I didnt have any cabbage on had, so I cut up some fresh lettuce. Tasted great. Will be adding this into my monthly rotation.

Excellent fish tacos - easy to make and everyone liked them. Will definitely make again. I added some mango & chopped cilantro to the avocado & lime juice for a nice salsa.

This came out excellent.  My husband LOVED it!  I wrapped a soft taco around a hard taco and layered salsa in between and it worked very well.  We will definitely be making this again.

Im only giving this a 4* because my hubby did not like it.  My son and I liked them.  I did saute my cod in butter on the stove with no flour and used tony's seasoning.  I liked the sweet of the slaw with the spice of the fish.  My hubby says not to make again but if I do I will put fresh jalapinos on them...yum!

Very easy, I liked the cabbage and avacados but the fish could have used more seasoning I think.  Will probably use the cabbage/poppyseed dressing mix again on fish tacos but with a more flavorful fish recipe.

Don 't be put off by the red cabbage.  I'm not much on cabbage but it was a great compliment to the fish and avocado!  We took the spin-off suggestion of using Mahi-Mahi and paired it with slow-cooker "refried" beans.  Added a little salsa and instead of taco shells, we pan fried some whole wheat tortillas.  Simply fantastic!

This super fast, super simple recipe was really delicious! Followed the directions and turned out wonderful.  I used Mahi Mahi which i would venture to say is the best firm fish for this dish! Just amazing! I would suggest letting the cabbage sit with the poppyseed dressing for a while (make that first) so that it softens it up and add a bit of lime juice to that mix and/or while the fish is cooking!  Thank you so much for this WONDERFUL recipe!

WOW this was a great recipe!  Very simple and flavorful.  I grilled cod with a little lemon olive oil and lime juice.  Will definitely make this again.

SO EASY AND YUMMY.  used cod (1 1/2 pounds made about 8 large soft tacos, 2 avacados was the perfect amount.  1/3 cup dressing was too much - you could use 1/2 to save on calories- brianna's is THE BEST.  this time I fried like stated but next time I will definitely grill or bake.  the flavors went so nicely together-didn't even need any sides-although I made with the cool cucumber salsa from this site. thank you!

SECOND TIME-used cod agian.  1 pound good for me and husband with a tiny bit leftover.  need to measure flour/salt ratio exactly because that's part of what we liked last time.  used evoo but i still think the exact recipe was better (used veg oil last time).

These were very easy to make and good as made to the recipe.  I will make them again and spice them up just a bit by adding some seasoning to the flour.  My favorite part was the avocados with the lime.  I served these with rice and Coronas to make me feel like I was back in Mexico!!
