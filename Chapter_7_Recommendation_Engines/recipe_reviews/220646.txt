What a fun way to use Rutabaga! I love the dressing, very very fresh tasting. I added some dried cranberries for color and a bit of a zing.

Interestingly enough, this was delicious. I needed something to use up the GIANT rutabaga I bought to make soup and coincidentally had just bought some nutritional yeast. This was a great find! I was very skeptical when I made it, but it's good! I think it's best cold for lunches. I took the suggestions others made and added raisins, some parsely and a few carrot shreds.

This recipe is surprisingly tasty!  The dressing is full of flavor.  I added some fresh, chopped parsley for color as I agree with one of the other reviewers, without it, it just doesn't look that appetizing.

Very, very good! And, a great way to use that one last rutabaga from our CSA share. Substituted (sorry) ground pine nuts for the nutritional yeast because I didn't have any (heck, I never even heard of it!) which added a nice creamy element to the dressing. I also used tri-color couscous and added some shredded carrots for color because otherwise the dish is not very appealing. :)

I hadn't ever used rutabaga and had never even heard of nutritional yeast, so I tried this. It was OK, but just didn't float my boat. I tried it warm and I also tried it cold after the flavors had melded. Just "OK".
