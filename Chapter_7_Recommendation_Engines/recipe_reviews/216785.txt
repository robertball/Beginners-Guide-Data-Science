Very nice. I used regular yeast and desolved it in the warm water with a little sugar. A little grated lemon rind ads a nice flavor to the dough. If the apples are very sweet I would use less sugar for the filling. Mine turned out a bit too sweet. Also leave the apples a little on the crispy side. Next time I would add some chopped almonds. The glaze is fantastic  and an absolute must. I hope I have some left over for tomorrow morning because my husband is sampling again and again.

I thought this turned out excellently!  I was a bit scared because I didn't see it rising much, but then I'm pretty new to breadmaking and I take it this type of pastry isn't intended to have the dramatic rising effect of most bread.  The term "doubled in size" baffles me, however as every bread recipe uses this measure and it apparently means vastly different things to different breads.  

But it was excellent.  The filling was DELICIOUS!  Definitely a keeper.

This was an easy recipe to make, and so yummy!! I did not make the glaze, but did the following instead. I mixed two tablespoons of milk with a teaspoon of vanilla flavor and a table spoon of warm honey, and brushed it on top for the golden brown coloring. I also added walnuts to the filling and a few on top for presentation. Definitely a keeper!!

I can't believe how few ratings there are on this recipe. I love it. Love, love it. This is going to be my go to recipe for sweet bread. 
I do think that the baking temp/time is a little bit off and recommend baking a little bit longer at a lower temperature (depending on your oven).

This is delicious.  Followed to the tee except for the glaze.  I adjusted milk to 1/2 a cup to make and brush it over the dough after baking.  Creates a shiny, flavorful glaze without the heavy icing taste, which isn't a flaw of this recipe but personal taste.  Beautiful presentation.  Rave reviews.  Will make this often!

This is an easy delicious way to get danish.  I've made it with apple filling and cheese filling both were delicious.  My next filling for this dough is going to be raspberry.

AWESOME! I've never made a Danish before but omg the flavor is so good. I added raisins but that is the only change I made, and that browned butter glaze is so right for this recipe. I don't think mine came out looking as beautiful as it should have but I will keep trying.

Good recipe! Filling is EXACTLY like the apple dessert in a tv dinner or like McDonald's apple pie...delicious! Be careful to not knead the dough too much, making it too tough not tender. The glaze is awesome! Barely brown the butter, its perfect! I used vanilla almond milk in place of regular milk, upping the "nutty" flavor even more...wow!

My family loved this Danish.  The recipe was easy to make, although it was pretty time consuming, there is a lot of down time while you are waiting for the dough to raise throughout the recipe, this wasn't a set back though, I used the down time to do other things.  It turned out great and my family absolutely loved it.  One little note, I doubled the apple filling in mine only because I had 5 cups of chopped apples I needed to use up.

I made this without the glaze, in attempt to decrease the sugar content, and it was basically an apple stromboli.  Either make the glaze or look for a crust that is more pastry-ish.

So far, so good.  I posted a pic of mine as it was in the final rising.  Looks nice and puffy so far, I'm well pleased with this recipe.  I'll post a final pic when it comes out of the oven and after I've had a piece.  I cleaned up the little filling remaining the saucepan after I filled the dough - it was yummy.  Can't wait for the final danish!
OK - finished the danish - posted 2 more pics (cut and uncut danish).  It was absolutely delicious!  I had baked it in the evening and frosted it in the morning.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is heat the danish slightly if I make it the night before - that way the whole thing will be nice and warm.  This is a definite must-make!

So yummy!!!! I added chopped pecans to the filling and a little nutmeg and cinnamon to the dough and omitted the brown sugar from the dough. I live at high altitude so I also turned my oven up to 400 degrees and didn't need to cover it with foil, but I did check it at 10 minutes to see if I needed to. Definitely worth making again and again!!!!

This is the first time I'm inclined to comment on any recipe I've tried and with good reason; this was great! Used rolled oats in the filling instead of flour cause I like to sneak in some healthy stuff for the family. It's almost gone. Loved the dough. Used cinnimon sugar instead of the glaze, will try it next time though.

YUM! My husband was wanting something sweet on a whim, and I've had this recipe saved for a long time so I decided to finally make it. Very glad I did, it was just perfect. The only little change I made was to add a full teaspoon of cinnamon, because we really love the flavor. Other than that, this was spot on. Highly recommend.

It was delicious.  A huge hit in our household.  Next time we are going to make into turnover shapes and try to freeze a couple to see if they will freeze well. We also might play around with other fillings.  Will definitely be making this again. :)

This was really good. I basically followed the recipe with a few minor changes. I used some extra yeast (closer to 2 t.) because my yeast was old, and also because of the old yeast, I extended the rise times. I sprinkled raisins over the apple filling before sealing it up. The browned butter glaze was really good--the browning really did add to the flavor. Just make sure you watch the browning butter carefully so it doesn't burn. If I make this again, I will leave it in another five or 10 minutes longer--I think it's a bit undercooked at 20, and you don't need to add the foil on top. One other change I would make is to reduce the salt, probably to a 1/2 teaspoon. I like salty, but the dough was a little too salty.

Few things need to be add up. First, when preparing the filling, stir constantly because the sugar will burn. Then, it take more then an hour to prepare. They forgot the 15 min after you punch the dough and the 30-40 min after the dough is braided. Plus the time you wait for your oven to reach its temperature even if you do it in advance, we're talking here over 2 hours! Roll the dough bigger then 13x8. Maybe 13x13 as the filling will overflow and it won't stay as a nice braid. Or reduce the quantity of apples to 2 cups instead. Pros: the filling is fantastically good!

It’s not a true Danish, but this apple braid turned out very nice. For a cook who is terrified of yeast, this dough was easy to make, rose properly, and the finished bread had a nice texture and a good sweet flavor.  The golden brown color of the finished braid was beautiful — I added an egg wash prior to baking to give the finished product a little shine. The filling was tasty and developed a nice caramel sauce for the apples as it cooked. I didn’t have nutmeg, so I put in a pinch of allspice instead. After making this, I’m encouraged to try more bread and pastry baking!

I've been making this recipe for years, and don't know why I haven't reviewed it before now! The brown sugar bread dough is AMAZING... I've modified this recipe to make apple cinnamon buns drizzled with the same browned butter glaze and they're perfect every time!

Excellent! I couldn't find mascarpone so used Philadelphia cream cheese. I added 1/2 tbsp of cinnamon, but otherwise followed recipe. It turned out great with leftovers for breakfast.

I loved this recipe. It turned out beautifully. I left the nutmeg out of the filling. For the glaze I just used softened butter and beat in the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla.

Nice, although I messed mine up.
You need to pinch the braided pieces together along the top of the danish, or they just open up and point vertically.
Not a total disaster though

Hallo!  I made this morning, and I absolutely loved it.  The bread is great, the filling is good.  
I did, however, refuse to gussy it up in a fancy braid.  Instead I just folded the edges together.  Call me lazy, but, I was starving!

This Danish is delicious. I was looking for a simple recipe to use some Granny Smith apples. The dough was easy to work with. The only ingredient change I made was to sprinkle  chopped pecans over the filling before braiding the dough. Rather than cooking the filling on the stove, I used the microwave. I find microwaving to be easier because scorching isn't likely. Melt the butter in a microwave safe bowl or large measuring cup. Add the apples, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Stir well, then add remaining ingredients. Stir well, cover and cook 4-5 minutes more. Stir well. The filling should have thickened.  If not, microwave in 1 minute increments until thickened. Proceed as directed in the recipe.

Wonderful!  Followed recipe fairly closely but used only vanilla in apple filling - not cinnamon and nutmeg (my husband does not like) and used maple extract rather than vanilla in the glaze. Could see how dough could be used with various fillings. Will make again for sure.

This was fantastic however, the dough was undercooked.
