Who doesn't love rice and beans? Mix it with pico de gallo and avocado ranch and it gets even better. I made these in homemade tortilla bowls as well as in corn taco shells. What's not to love here? I couldn't find Uncle Ben's Ready Rice so I had to use from scratch versions of rice and beans. This was perfect for a buffet type service.  Thank you bd.weld for your recipe.

My husband said to put this one on the top ten list. I make my own salsa, used left over rotissary chicken and used Manatma Red Beans and Rice.

This was wicked good.  I love the ease in preparation of this recipe and although easy, you won’t be disappointed in the flavor.  Delicious.   I honestly gave it my best shot making the taco bowls and they didn’t come out too bad, although next time I’ll ignore them.  This is a keeper!

Taco shell bowls are always so much fun and the pinto beans and rice were the perfect base. Top that with all of your favorite fixings and it doesn't get much better than that. Most taco bowls I've had are filled dominantly with lettuce and lettuce is boring to me when it comes to tacos. In and out of the kitchen in less than 30 minutes? Yes please! I had a little rice/pinto accident in between filling my 1st and 2nd bowl and it ended up on the floor so the picture I've attached was actually done with what I had on hand which was the Uncle Ben's Ready Jasmine Rice. The Pinto Beans and Rice was definitely the better bowl. Thanks for the great recipe b.d.weld!

This was a hit here. I used black beans instead of pinto beans. And I used the Mexican Rice III recipe from this site instead of the ready Ben's rice as I prefer not to use the boxed rice.  I liked the avocado ranch dressing, never had that before, quite tasty. I thought they were very pleasing to the eye when all put together, nice presentation. Thanks for the recipe. The changes were only because of personal preference.
