This is the AR Buzz Recipe Group selection for November 22, 2014.  I decided that I wanted to make a trial run on this recipe before Thanksgiving. I didn't have fresh thyme so I used dried. I baked for about 35 minutes and sprinkled with freshly ground sea salt and pepper.  Will definitely be making again for Thanksgiving and other meals as well.  Thank you, Don for sharing your healthy, easy and delicious recipe!

Tried and true!  This is definitely a keeper.  Didn't have any parsnips but used carrots, sweet potatoes and whole fennel.  Delicious!  No maple syrup in house so I used wildflower honey with a very aromatic scent and flavour.  It mixed very well with the thyme.  UPDATE:  Finally got to try this exactly as written.  Just delicious.  The maple syrup in this comes out with almost a smokey flavour.  The fresh thyme also adds a herbal flavour that mixes well with the maple syrup and the sweetness of the sweet potatoes.  Thanks a million.  Don.

My husband looked at me and said "what did you do to the vegetables because they are awesome".  Nuff said, these were delicious and simple.  Yummy, wish I'd made more!

Yum!  I love roasted vegetables, and I usually don't add anything besides EVOO, salt and pepper.  But these were delicious, and I followed the recipe exactly.  One bite led to another, and then another!  I've never had parsnips either, and the only reason I bought them was for this recipe.  I'm happy to say that I will buy them again, thanks to Don!  These vegetables were a welcome change from the marshmallow-topped sweet potatoes that usually grace the Thanksgiving table.

Oh YUM!!!  This was fabulous!  Saw it earlier this evening, while buzzing, had everything I needed, thought it sounded yummy and it was!  Can't wait to have own herb garden again!  Just used the Thyme I had purchased for tomorrow, but this just sounded (and was) burp....SO worth it.  Absolutely NO changes I could possibly want to make!  Thank you SO much Don, for taking the time to share!  Blessings!

awesome simple recipe. we had never eaten parsnips ( I thought they were albino carrots.) also, I'm not a big fan of maple syrup. we happened to have some the wife had bought up north. I doubled the recipe to have left-overs, dang it...I should have tripled it. no left-overs. seriously thinking of planting parsnips here. thanks for a great dinner with a favorite new (to us) vegetable.

This was a great flavor combination! I didn't have fresh thyme so I used dried and added it to the veggies along with the salt and pepper. For the baking, I baked covered at 350 for about 25 mins then uncovered and drizzled the maple syrup and baked another 20 minutes or so till soft and the outside had caramelized. It was soo good. A really flavorful twist on classic veggies. Will definitely be making again:-)

Recipe Group: Made this for our Turkey Day feast, and so glad I did! This is delicious! I used my convection oven, which lessened the cooking time a bit even at 350. When I added the thyme and maple syrup I drizzled just a wee bit more olive oil, I really didn't want the veggies sticking to the pan. I peeled my sweet potato but just scrubbed the carrots and parsnips (used two small of each, so about equal to the sweet potato). This is a great and simple flavor combo that would be enjoyed by anyone. Thanks Don for sharing!

I made this recipe recently and had everything but the parsnips. Not even sure I have seen them in a grocery store here before. So, I doubled the carrots. I accidentally added the maple syrup at the beginning. As a result, I couldn't get mine crispy at all which I think they were somewhat supposed to be. All was not lost, I turned this into a fabulous soup in the vitamix with some saut√©ed onions and garlic, some broth, seasonings, the roasted sweetened vegetables and a piece of apple. Made for a tasty lunch. :-)

I used one sweet potato and one parsnip, which gave me enough of a side dish for two or three meals. I peeled both before cooking.  I omitted the carrot (too much orange color for my aesthetic preferences) and added a thickly sliced red onion for flavor and color.  I cut the cooking time in half. When I tossed the vegetables at the 15 minute mark they were ready to have the syrup and thyme added and then finished off for another 10 minutes in the oven.  The onion added a bite to an otherwise quite sweet dish. The thyme complemented the other flavors nicely.

This dish was not only easy to make but tasted fabulous! In that I was not using fresh thyme I simply sprinkled with dry using my judgment. I love the hint of sweetness the maple syrup gives which is just enough. Ideal subtle combination of savory and sweet while still being able to taste the wholesome goodness of the vegetables. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*). Another winning recipe by Don!

Yummy recipe.  Since I am the only one who like sweet potato I used only 1 sweet potato then sub with thin skinned white.  Used my small roasting pan and cooked on the BBQ set on low.  Worked great.  Thanks Don.

This is a simple and easy recipe that tastes delicious.  I plan to put this into my weekly menu plan.  It's that good.  I recommend using only real maple syrup though.

Excellent and so easy to make! I didn't have any parsnips and added extra carrots instead. Loved the thyme + maple combo for roasted vegetables. Great change from the average (and still good) olive oil and salt+pepper.  My only complaint is not having any leftovers. Can't wait to try this again with parsnips, if I can find them. Thanks for sharing the recipe, Don!

I made this two ways: first, the original recipe. Sweet, delicious, will be made again (and again.) The second way, I used dark agave syrup instead of maple syrup, white pepper instead of black, and rosemary instead of thyme (and I used a LOT of rosemary). This turned out amazing, as well.  This is a versatile dish, and has earned a place in my kitchen as Classic Comfort Food.

Was easy to make and we loved the syrup on the vegetables.  I did add some Brussels sprouts and mushrooms just because I had them and wanted to use them up.

This was really good. I didn't have fresh thyme on hand, so I sprinkled dried thyme on it and it was still great!  Also, I increased the carrot and parsnip to sweet potato ratio, as I had more of them on hand, any ratio would work - whatever your personal preferences are.

Yummy. I used just 3 sweet potatos. I will definitely try it with all the veggies! 2 tbl maple syrup was plenty to make it sweet you can definitely get away with half that. This is a keeper.

Changed it up a bit due to what was in the pantry and made a large batch.  1.5 lbs of small red potatoes and 5 med sized sweet apples were subbed for sweet potatoes.  Used 5 small-med sized parsnips to use them up and a med sized sweet yellow onion for the same reason.   Dried thyme subbed for fresh.  Roasted at 380 degrees for 30 minutes in a giant sized roasting pan so as to have one layer, stirred then roasted for another 30 minutes.  Very tasty, an interesting blend of sweet and salty.  Next time will add onions and red and green bell peppers for color.

Simple and delicious! I personally will reduce the cooking time a bit because I prefer the ingredients a bit firmer.

The flavour was amazing. I cut the pieces too thin so I should have reduced the baking time. There were a few very crunchy veggies! Will make again.

This recipe was awesome!! I have never roasted carrots before, so I followed the timing and temperature exactly and they came out perfect!! I think adding the seasonings towards the end was key!

This was a nice change from the standard old stuff. Nice bright colors with that touch of sweetness. It was very pretty on the plate.

Delicious! I substituted honey for the maple syrup, and added a dash of white balsamic vinegar. Placed a bed of this recipe on the plate, topped with a perfectly cooked NY Strip steak. Served with fresh baked bread, and olive oil infused with fresh herbs for dipping bread. Started things off with a spinach & fruit salad. Made for a very romantic Valentines Day dinner!

Excellent. I used rosemary and put on some other herbs, like a little turmeric and paprika. I also added mushrooms half way through.

Recipe Group Selection for 11/22/2014 -  What a great selection!  This was a huge hit in our house.  I just wished I had made more.  This is a keeper.
