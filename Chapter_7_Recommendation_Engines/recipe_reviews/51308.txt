A quick and easy recipe. I pureed all the berries in a mini food procesor and added them to the egg/ butter mixture. Also I didn't use the 1 Tbs of vanilla- why too much, I only used 1 1/2 tsp. The brownies came out very moist and no soggy spots from the strawberries..

So different, but really good. I decided to make this because I had a lot of strawberries. But now I'll be buying strawberries just to make this recipe. Very easy to mix together, though I did have some trouble pureeing that small an amount of strawberries.

I was looking for a recipe to use those strawberries that still have a little life but not much more -- these were interesting but not something I'd make again.

Delicious!  I didn't read the reviews until after I had them in the oven, and was slightly unnerved after reading how so many people pureed all of the strawberries or didn't like the texture with whole sliced strawberries.  I treated the strawberries exactly how the recipe intends and I am in LOVE with this dessert. I love the slightly strawberry taste of the brownies themselves, and the chunks of sliced strawberries are a fabulous addition.   I did use a box of brownie mix, though, because I was out of cocoa powder. I followed the "fudge-like" recipe on the box, minus the water. (so 2 eggs and oil. the strawberry purree essentially replaced the water)  The brownie mix I used was verrrry chocolately, which was wonderful, so if making from scratch I would recommend a strong chocolate taste (since I didn't use this brownie recipe, I can't many any suggestions in this regard).  I liked baking in a pie dish as well because of the thickness (so 8x8 square pan would also work well, but I would definitely not recommend a 9x13 pan.)

This is a good idea, but I had to do some tweaking for our tastes.  Like other reviewers suggested, I pureed all the strawberries.  In addition to the vanilla (I did use the full amount--LOVE vanilla!), I also added some chocolate extract and some natural strawberry flavoring.  I also added more sugar, because my strawberries were a little tart, and because I also added more cocoa.  I also added baking powder and salt and some chopped bittersweet chocolate.  I baked in a 10x10 stoneware (King Arthur Flour original).  The taste was very good, and my family gave them a thumbs up.

Overall, I didn't care for this recipe but it did use some interesting ideas. I did like the taste of the brownie batter with the addition of the puree. I should have just left it like that and left out the fresh berries. The consistency of the fresh berries cooked into the brownie batter just did not appeal to me at all. It was more of a texture problem for me than the taste. Also, the brownie batter did need a strong chocolate taste IMHO. I will take the idea of pureeing some fruit with me from the recipe and use that in another recipe.

The brownie is nice and chewy, however the moist fruit pieces tend to leave mushy spots which gives it an odd, un-brownie like texture. I'd reccomend just using the puree in the batter and upping the amount just enough to make it easy to blend.

I love the idea of Strawberry brownies, and I took the advice of others and pureed the strawberries. I always try the batter before I make anything, and it was really tasty. Although when the finished product came out of the oven, I found they tasted too much like coco powder and not enough like chocolate, even after using chocolate chips. Will try again but with semi-sweet baking chocolate.

These were pretty, smelled delicious and the flavor was great, but the texture was fudgelike and somewhat off-putting. I don't think I would make again.

I thought these were pretty good, but for me, (and maybe I didn't use enough strawberries, but I thought I did!) I could barely taste the strawberries through the chocolate. They tasted like chocolate brownies with a very slight hint of strawberry. The brownie was moist and soft though. I did also use all purpose flour instead of cake flour, as I had none..I just added a little baking powder, as well I pureed all the strawberries as other reviewers suggested! :)  I will make again,  but possibly use more strawberries next time, again, that could have been easily been an error on my part. :) Thanks for sharing! :)

I baked this for the first time for guest.   They all loved it.  I used fresh cranberries and cream cheese and added baking powder for more of a brownies like texture.

The idea is good but I think it would be better executed using a traditional brownie recipe with fresh strawberries folded in.

I don't care for chocolate but my husband and 7-year-old daughter both said they were a 5-star.  I have made this recipe twice, once as written and once using raspberries instead of strawberries (though I just used the puree and did not add chunks of fruit).  I would, however, recommend not using a pie plate as the recipe calls for but rather just a square or rectangular baking dish.  The brownies tested done with a toothpick in the pie plate but when I took them out and later cut them, they were still way too gooey in the middle.  I ended up putting them back in the oven for an additional 15 minutes to firm them up a little.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Excellent brownies!  My first experience with strawberry brownies - will make again.  I did purée all of the berries, although added a layer of sliced berries on bottom thinking it would look nice inverted - bad idea.  The bottom was just soggy. Lesson learned.  I also added some mini semisweet chocolate chips which was a better idea.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated, only adding about a 1/4 cup of chocolate syrup to the mix.. came out amazing. crispy on top, soft and moist underneath with bits of sweet strawberry. As a side note, i had to cook mine for close to 43 mins to get it to the right consistency using an 8x8 square glass pan

This was good.  My wife said it tasted like strawberry ice cream w/choc syrup on it.  I followed reviewers suggestion and put berries in the blender.  I doubled the recipe and it fit well in a 9 x 13 and a large pie plate.  Texture was between brownie and cheese cake.  Different but good.

Great recipe that I will use again. Thank you!
I used raspberries instead of strawberries and it was good. Only 7 ounces of raspberries though, which was enough. Next time I would strain out the seeds first, but it was really good! Also I added chocolate morsels on top. chocolate and raspberries go great together.

I loved this recipe, but I think it was very chocolaty. I tried it a few minutes after it came out of the oven when it was gooey, but I recommend trying it when it is cool and hardens a bit. I also used frozen strawberries and thawed them in hot water, but I recommend using fresh berries. Next time I will definatly use less chocolate and more vanilla extract.

I can see that this would be a nice fudgey brownie as written.  However, I wanted a more cake-like texture, so I used another reviewer's suggestion re adding baking powder.  Pureed all the strawberries.  Needed to bake more like 45 min or so.  End result was exactly what I wanted, and totally delish!!!

I like the idea of adding strawberry puree to brownie batter, but as a brownie recipe, mine came out more like chocolate cake than a true brownie, even after I added dark chocolate plus the cocoa powder.   I'll probably try the idea again, but will find another brownie recipe.
