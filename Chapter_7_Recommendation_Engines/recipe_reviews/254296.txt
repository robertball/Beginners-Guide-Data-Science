I omitted the hot cocoa mix & just used chocolate fudge icing  & after coating the graham cracker crust with peanut butter , I put a layer of caramel, then the ice cream  then topped it with the chocolate glaze & more caramel,  plus I bought the mini graham cracker crumb pie tins so everyone can have their own, they all loved them!?
