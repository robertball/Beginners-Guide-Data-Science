I got this EXACT recipe in the mail, and I was searching this site to find a better one when I came across this. Thought I should leave a warning for future users... The bottom layer is great (if not a little hard), but the top layer is runny. It melted despite being in the fridge. I think it needs more cream cheese. We had to freeze it just for it to stick together. NOT recommended. Find another recipe!

THIS SOUNDED LIKE A GREAT RECIPE.  I HAD A GRADUATION PARTY TO GO TO AND I MADE THE PIE THE NIGHT BEFORE -
EVERYTHING WENT FINE UNTIL THE NEXT DAY - THE CARAMEL MIXTURE GOT WATERY AND SEEPED UP THE SIDES OF THE PIE - IT LOOKED AWFUL AND 
I HAD TO MAKE ANOTHER DISH FOR THE PARTY.  I THREW THE PIE AWAY BECAUSE IT WAS RUINED (ALL WATERY AND SOGGY)  I RECHECKED THE RECIPE TO BE SURE
I HAD NOT MESSED UP.  I THINK I WILL EXPERIMENT WITH THIS ONE BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT RECIPE BUT BEWARE IF YOU ARE MAKING THIS FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION.

The first couple of times I made this I followed the directions exactly and put the pudding layer on the still warm caramel layer.  I figured it might be the heat that was making the top section runny. I made two adjustments that has solved the watery pie problem. In preparing the chocolate mixture I blend everything but the sour cream. I fold in the sour cream after the rest is blended. Afterwards what I did was put the pie crust with just the caramel layer in the fridge on it's own, and put the cream cheese chocolate pudding layer in the fridge in a separate container to set. Once they had ample time to cool and set I put them together.  It works well and tastes amazing.

We hold pie auctions at my church to raise money for the youth group to go build houses in Mexico.  I brought this pie to the auction, and it went for the highest price ($90!), and they probably could have sold 10 more!  Everyone was asking for the recipe, or what store I purchased it at.  When I said I had made it and it was a no-bake dessert, *everyone* wanted a copy of the recipe!

I'm pretty sure there will be several of these at the next auction!

followed recipe to a T almost... runny runny runny. The flavor of the cheesecake mixture wasn't bad but it turned into a runny mess. Maybe I followed the recipe wrong with my change- it called for 2- 3oz pkgs of cream cheese. Never in my life have I seen a 3 oz package of cream cheese. I used 2 8oz packages, the normal size packages. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!! I gave some to the kids and none of them hardly touched it and went without dessert instead.

This recipe looked really good but it was not the best. There was too much cream cheese and like the others said the carmel ran and looked awful. I think I will play with the recipe to make it better for me!!!

The topping on this cheesecake became watery and messy!  It was tasty but looked awful!  Be wary of the chocolate topping used because I think that is what melted (despite being refrigerated)and it was a HUGE mess. (I used fudge ice cream topping in a squieezable bottle) Needless to say it didn't make to the bake auction it was intended for!

This recipe sounded so good I made it the night before Thanksgiving. Big mistake, I should have tested it before. I followed the recipe exactly, but the cheesecake part of it was so soupy I could not cut it. I thought about chopping it all up and serving it as just pudding, but it was so sickenly sweet.

Awesome recipe!  I was making it for company and made the mistake of making it the day before.  It got really watery and I was a bit embarrassed to bring it out but the taste totally made up for it!   Definately will be making this again!

I've had this recipe in my cook book for over 20 years....and it calls for 2 EIGHT ounce packages of cream cheese, not 2 THREE ounce packages.  Mine is not runny.  Not messy. Can't imagine it would ever turn out with only 6 ounces of cream cheese.
