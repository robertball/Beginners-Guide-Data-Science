I followed the recipe as written, the only change being that I used ground ginger, not fresh. The flavors were great, the crispy texture added by the panko crumbs was really nice. They cooked perfectly with an extra 5 minutes in the oven. My whole family loved these sliders. I'm going to experiment with different types of meat. This just might become our go-to burger recipe. Thanks for sharing!

These were great! I think the only thing that would have made them better and added flavor is some sesame oil . I think cucumber slices would be a nice touch as well. Overall excellent and one I would make again.
