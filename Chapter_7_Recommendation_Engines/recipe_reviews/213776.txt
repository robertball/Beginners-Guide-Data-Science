Egg salad is definitely a classic!  The only thing missing from this is that little bit of zing that comes from adding a little bit of mustard, so I added 1 tsp. of dijon mustard and 1/2 tsp. of yellow mustard.  That gave this that little kick this needed.  Other than that it was perfect on toasted whole wheat bread.

Good, reliable, basic egg salad recipe.  Great recipe for beginner and experienced cooks alike.  Lots of room for creative additions if you like but simply perfect as is.  I love raw onion, but not so much a couple hours later (!) so I used green onion instead, which added a nice kick of flavor and color. I also added a smidge of ground mustard. Nothing not to like with this one.

Silly me.  I used miced garlic instead of minced onion.  Woops.  Anyway, still tastes good.  =)  I added more mayo than suggested also added mustard.  Used slightly less pepper too.  Good recipe.  Will keep!

I think it's good, but it felt like it was missing something so I added a tablespoon of mustard, about 1 1/2 cup of celery, and an extra egg. I made egg salad sandwiches. I also used lettuce leaves and tomato slices in the sandwich.

This is a delicious recipe!  I added a tsp. each of dijon and yellow mustard as suggested by another user.  I also did not have the fresh lemon, so I used about 1/2 the suggested juice from bottled lemon juice.  Can't wait to fix this again.

This wasn't a bad egg salad recipe by any means but it wasn't my favorite. It tasted a little too much like mayonnaise for my likings. Next time I'll cut back on this and the lemon juice because it made it a little runny.

If you don't have lemon juice, add a tsp. of the juice from your jar of sweet pickles! Or, add a tsp. of sweet pickle relish- it's fabulous!

I didn't have any lemon juice on hand, so I axed that and the pepper and substituted lemon pepper instead. Then I added a little bit of yellow mustard and yep, tastes like a good ol' classic egg salad! I'm new in the kitchen so this was fast and easy and tasty!

This is the perfect egg salad recipe. I added some relish and upped the celery a little bit for extra crunch. Topped with a tomato slice, this is delicious.

This is a wonderful, fast, easy egg salad!  Tastes great and can be varied if you want (I like to add dill and mustard sometimes) but is fine just the way it is.

Simple and just as good as can be. I used low-fat mayonnaise, red onion and I did add a little dill weed....maybe about 1/4 teaspoon. I wrapped mine in bibb lettuce but the kids had theirs on whole grain bread. Great for me who is using some eggs before they go bad.

This was edible, but I probably won't make this again. The recipe calls for a little too much mayonnaise, so it's a bit wetter than I'd like it to be. Maybe try 3 tablespoons first. If necessary, you can add more later. I also added about 1/2 tsp of scallions and 1/2 tsp of yellow mustard (didn't ahve dijon on hand, but it would probably add a bit of kick to it). I don't like the smell/taste of all the raw onions, so I'd omit that. There are betetr recipes out there I'm sure of.

Awesome recipe! I didn't think I liked egg salad. I made it for my girlfriend, but I LOVED it. I added a half cup of sour cream and 3/4 cup finely diced cooked ham in addition to all listed ingredients. The ham really made this dish. Without it, I would not have been impressed. Also important to mince the celery, not just chop it. The egg salad was great on a lighter textured whole wheat bread. Also pairs well with a nice hefeweizen, pilsner, fruit beer, IPA or hard cider. I will definitely be making this again!

Perfect with the added mustard!  BTW -- I did not have fresh lemon juice and it turned out just fine with the stuff in the plastic lemon.

Very good. I did add about a 1/4 tsp dijon mustard and sugar, and I used fresh onion and chopped it up with the celery in my mini food processor. Didn't have time to refrigerate before eating and still very flavorful. Served on potato rolls, and enjoyed very much by myself, hubby (he added chipole hot sauce to his for more spice) and 3 year old daughter. Thanks for the easy, fast and economical recipe!

I always have wanted a really good egg salad sandwich. I used seven eggs instead of six and I followed another reviews advice and add 1tsp mustard and 1 tsp. dijon mustard. I also use red onion and it's superb. I have eaten it a few times and it is super great on slightly toasted bread.

I don't like celery so I just used scallions instead of regular onion for a little crunch.  I had 7 hard-boiled eggs I wanted to use up so I was just a bit generous with the mayo and it turned out fine.
