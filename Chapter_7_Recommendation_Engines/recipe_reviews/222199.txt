Made as written and this turned out perfect as is. My butter mixture was way to thin to get a "paste" out of it but other than that this recipe was spot on. I really enjoyed the extra flavor the jalapeno brought to the fish.  I only have access to a few fresh trout each year but I will most definitely make this one again when I get more .
