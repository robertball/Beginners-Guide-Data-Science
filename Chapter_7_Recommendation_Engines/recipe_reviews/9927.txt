Yummy!!!  Don't worry about spreading it out perfectly.  When it cooks it spreads really well anyway.  Next time I will try pecans. Update: love it with pecans. Lined cookie sheet with parchment paper. When done just lift the whole parchment out with crisps and let cool on counter, maybe place a towel down first, they are hot!!! I read someone sprinkled chocolate chips on top, might try that too!!!

A version of this recipie has been in my family for many many years. There are some differences and tips I can share: Heat your oven to 325, Boil your margarine, butter and sugar for only 2 minutes; remove and add 1tsp of vanilla. Pour ontop of HONEY graham crackers on a lined jelly roll pan (makes removal easier if you use parchment paper). Sprinkle with chopped walnuts and bake in heated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, NO MORE. Easily over baked and/or over boil so these times are important!

These are so bad for you, but so addictive!  I use walnut or pecan pieces, and only use about 1/4 cup.

You have to be sure to melt the butter over a lower heat and not cook the mixture too long.  If the syrup isn't the right consistency, or if you burn it over high heat, the cookies aren't as good.  Try it a couple times and you'll figure out the right temperatures and cook times.  It's been different for me each time I make these, but I've learned what the mixture should look like to turn out correctly.

Very good, especially if you love toffee. Be sure to use a cookie sheet with sides, though. I used one without sides and the butter mixture bubbled up, spilling over and creating a mess in the bottom of my oven. I also didn't have to boil this for two full minutes to get the right consistency for the mixture, which I would describe as frothy and bubbled-up.

I love these, they're wonderful.And very easy to make. I do not care for walnuts, so I've used pecans, silvered almonds and even coconut. They're all good. You really must try.

Very easy to prepare and taste so rich and buttery.  Canâ€™t wait to experiment with other types of nuts.  The only change I made was to add a teaspoon of vanilla after boiling the nut mixture.  I recommend using parchment paper or lining the cookie sheet with foil for easy clean up.  Thanks Melissa!

I've made these with both graham and saltine crackers.  I think I prefer the saltine version.  I like using slivered almonds.  Overall, though, very yummy and easy to make!

I had been looking for this recipe. My grandmothers neighbor made them and my family fell in love with them. We tried to make them ourselves but it never worked out. I was finally able to make them with your recipe. They turned out great, thanks!

I didn't use margarine, using 1 cup of butter instead. I also used pecans, rather than walnuts. And I only had cinnamon grahams. If you've made toffee before, you'll know how to tell when these are ready to come out of the oven. As previous reviewers have stated, the butter/sugar mix spreads on its own, but if your pans are a little warped, you may have to help it along halfway during the baking. To achieve the proper crunch, you should watch it carefully during the final 5 minutes of baking. While the bubbling is active across the entire batch, keep watching, taking them out once the bubbling subsides a bit and the color turns a dark amber. I lined the tray with foil before cooking, so you can just take the entire sheet out to cool on a flat surface. These were delicious! I've also tried these with coconut - about 1/2 cup added with the nuts right before pouring over the crackers. The coconut is a very nice addition! BTW, if you find that you've undercooked these (not crunchy enough), you can put them back in the oven, take them back to temperature, and bake until amber & crunchy (after cooling). In my oven, total baking was closer to 15 minutes at 345 F in convection mode.

I expected CRISP, toffee-like results, but like another reviewer, my crackers were soft and rather moist. I even kept them in a bit longer (about 13-15 min.) but it didn't help. The taste is GREAT...not the right texture, though.

Good flavor. I used someone's idea of pecans and cinnamon grahams. I am not sure if I was the problem or if they came out right, but I thought it was going to be crunchy. Not sure why. I am not sure if I used too big of crackers? not enough mixture for them? Family loved them, I thought they were good but was looking for crunch.

I'm not sure if I did this wrong, but I followed the directions exactly.  I also took the suggestions of many reviewers on what the consistency should be.  This did not really turn out like "toffee" for me at all.  It tastes like butter/sugar soaked graham crackers.

These are interesting to say the least.  I followed the recipe but when you spread the butter mixture over the crackers be sure to have a cookie sheet with sides, the butter mixture tends to drip out all over the oven. Other than that these are delicious. Made them for passing out at christmas, sure to be a big hit, thanks for sharing!

These things are so good!  To make them better I poured chocolate chips over them then added peanuts on top.  To help with the clean up, I lined the sheet with tin foil and the whole thing pulls off leaving one less dish to wash.

AMAZING! We used all chopped almonds instead and sprinkled them on top right before going into the oven. The sauce does not have to be spread perfectly even over the crackers, it spreads perfectly even in the oven. Definitely will be making these again!

This is so yummy!  I'd recommend making a test batch if you're using a different oven or making this the first time.  It is NOT good burnt or undercooked.

These were fantastic!!!! Very easy to prepare.  I used pecans and they tasted like little pecan pies. MMMMMM!!  I make these and called them fried skin, along with some PB eyeballs and some witches fingers for my ten year olds Halloween party at school and everything was a hit!  Thanks so much for such a great recipe!;-)
