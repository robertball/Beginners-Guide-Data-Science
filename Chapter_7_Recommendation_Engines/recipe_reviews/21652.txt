Great Recipe, Sally! I left out the mushrooms and toss in a minute amount of finely grated cabbage and 2t dry mustard. Sensational flavor. I sorely need some practice in forming the rolls, though!:)

These spring rolls were very good.  I used ground turkey instead of pork, dried black fungus in place of the mushrooms, and left out the crabmeat.  This made about 14 rolls, but I think that when I do them the next time, I will use less filling in each one.  Then I will be able to roll them more tightly, and they will be appetizer size, instead of meal size.  I used the fish sauce recipe from Vietnamese Fresh Spring Rolls found on this site, and it was the perfect dipping sauce.  My husband loved them, too, which is always a plus!

I thought these were wonderful!!  I used ground chicken and pork mixture.  I didn't have crab so eliminated that.  I also added ginger, some cabbage and a bit of water chestnuts for a crunch.  I used spring roll wrappers and egg rolls wrappers.  They both worked great.

Warning, these are addictive!  Even with a few substitutions (our local grocery didn't have all the correct ingredients), these were the best spring rolls we have ever had.  My husband couldn't stop eating them!! They were not as time intensive as I expected, and we were able to freeze half of them to eat at a later date.

Love these rolls. I did make a few adjustments to taste like my favorite restaurant. Only used these ingredients. Spring roll wraps(couldn't get rice wraps), 2oz. rice sticks instead of vermicelli, 4 egg whites, 1lb. of fresh small shrimp chopped, cabbage cut into thin strips, shredded carrots, then added fish sauce, soy sauce, and garlic. Wrap and fry.  To cook rice sticks before adding to mix, boil water, add rice sticks and boil a minute, turn off heat and let sit until tender. Also thai peanut sauce goes well with these. These are a favorite now and we don't have to go out to have them.

Students in my high school cooking class picked this recipe out for a vegetable unit.  They left the meats and fish sauce out adn we substituted egg roll wrappers for the rice ones due to availabiity.  They take a while to prepare, but they tasted excellent!  Many of the students liked them.

I made these for my last office party and needless to say they thought I bought them at a restraunt. I added the Chinese five spice (1 1/2 tsp) to the meat while cooking and served with garlic soy sauce. Great recipe!

I had everything ready to go when I discovered I was out of vermicelli noodles, so I used broken up and cooked angel hair pasta. Also, I had to use canned bean sprouts as the ones at the store were pretty sorry looking. Although I know that using the proper ingredients will certainly improve the recipe, I thought that the actual flavor was lacking something. If I were to make these again, I might try a little Chinese Five Spice. We did enjoy them though. Thanks, Sally!

These were great, Sally. I had only one problem, and that was locating the springroll wrappers. None of the chains I shop at had them. We do have some Asian markets about 20 miles from here that I will try, however. Thanks for sharing!

The kids couldn't stop eating them. I used a large bag of frozen oriental veggies, it was easier than fresh. I actually had to double the recipe the second time b/c they liked them so much. They were bragging to their friends that I had made homemade spring rolls. Thanks for the recipe.

Brought these to our friends as an appetizer for our annual "post Christmas Tree picking party" and twenty one rolls were gone in no time! I added cabbage, carrot, green onion, oriental flavored garlic powder and onion powder to the mix. So good Sally and thanks!

There's too much liquid in the bowl when you mix all the ingredients together,which makes putting them on rolls messier as the liquid makes the wraps so soft they may start to break apart. But the flavour is so good. After many tries,the closest to Vietnamese restaurants I have ever made.

I made this because we have a child who needs to go gluten-free, and regular egg rolls and spring rolls have wheat shells. These were fantastic and just the thing we needed after a very awkward transition. Everyone loved them!

I just added a tablespoon of sugar to the mix and sustituted the vermicelly for shredded cabbage this is a great recipe.  It goes well with a sweet/sour/spicy sauce on the side, made with red pepper flakes, cornstarch, vinegar, water, sugar and grated onions you might need to add red color for aesthetics.

I made them without seafood. I dont eat seafood. Even though many people think that seafood makes spring rolls what they are, they are delicious without it any way!

Wow - These are great, they were an instant hit with my family.  I left out the mushrooms as we're not too keen on them, and had to use cabbage instead of bean sprouts.  I used another persons idea about adding water chestnuts since I had some in my cupboard.  Thank you so much for your lovely recipe.

These were a little bland. I think with a little tweaking they could have more flavor. I would also use less noodles next time and more cabbage.

I didn't have vermicilli, crab meat or canned mushrooms (I used fresh). I used rice wrappers and was able to get into a groove rolling but the first few were not so great. When I put them into the frying pan, they all pretty much exploded, towards the end I double wrapped a few but didn't help. 
The taste was delicious but they were messy and technically I don't think I could call them a "roll" of any type.
Next time I think I will cook the pork and all the ingredients in a frying pan so that they cook together THEN roll it up and bake the wraps in the oven.. I am hoping this works better and eliminates some grease.

Great spring rolls! Amazing flavors and even better leftover from frozen state, baked at 350 for about 8-10 minutes!! I used the sausage crumbles instead of seafood, due to allergies to shellfish. I used 2 bags of coleslaw mixture to even out with one bag of sausage crumbles. Didnt use noodles. Also added another TBS of soy sauce and 1tsp chicken granules, 1tsp sugar. Oops! It seems I changed the recipe a bit. I got 30+ delicious spring rolls!

Man were those rolls a pain...but once you get the hang of them it all comes together. I used the ground turkey and crab just amazing..all my friends loved them.  Since I had to travel a bit with them..I popped them in the toasted oven 4 at a time. It really helped toast them..make them crispy with a fresh taste. Very yummy.

We made these without any of the meat.  They were pretty good.  My husband liked the rice paper wrappers.  My biggest complaint is that they were WAY too greasy.  I let them drain as best I could but still... the oil overwhelmed the taste.. maybe if I used a milder oil...

very authentic!  the only things I change are using black or wood mushrooms that come dried in Asian markets, and using an egg wash to seal the wrappers.  labor intensive, but we'll worth it.
