My mom gave me a copy of the Make-Ahead Cookie Mix clipped from a magazine many years ago. It came with TEN variations. The Butterball Recipe did not call for brown sugar- perhaps this is why yours spread out and were soft and messy.

should have softened butter first, it did not incorperate, so they flattened a little, we had butter blobs instead of balls. They were very tasty.

It flattens into a standard cookie as it cooks and is nutty, chewy, and has a caramel/toffee flavor.  It's ok, but not the "buttery cookie" you would expect, as described.
