I’ve never had kimchi before but since being put on a special diet in December, it was on my food list, so I bought some at my Asian market. I only made a couple of substitutions: coconut palm sugar, ham broth, and coconut cream (in place of tofu).  It was very good! I wanted soup but am limited in a lot of vegetables. Thanks for posting this recipe and for the reviewers’ suggestions.  I’ll definitely make this again!

Thoroughly enjoyed it!  Can’t go wrong with or without the meat!  Use the paste to adjust the heat to your preference.  The tofu will quickly take on the taste of the soup.

It’s ok recipe. Key to kimchi soup is you squeeze the juice out and “fry” the kimchi with some oil for 5 minutes on medium high heat. You then put the rest of the ingredients in high heat until it boils. You can add tofu before boiling and that is wonderful, too. It is best if served the next day.

Great soup!
I had recently made the kimchi jjigae recipe, and learned to saute the kimchi a bit to soften it before using in the soup, and I believe that helped. Also, I didn't have  pork shoulder available, but I did have a leftover chicken breast, so cubed that. I put some cubed tofu in also, though the recipe didn't call for it. Leftovers for lunch the next day was even tastier.

This is a very basic recipe and very functional! The beauty of kimchi soup is that it is very versatile. I generally add diced zucchini and carrots sauteed in sesame oil along with the green onions and tofu. For a fuller flavor, use broth to substitute for half the water.  It's also great if you add ramen  noodles. I often substitute hoisen sauce for the sugar. And any meat will work, not just pork.

I made it following the recipe and it was delicious. Next time I may add more veggies but it was good as is!

Came out great.  I used Tofu instead of Pork and it was super tasty!

2.5 This was just okay for me.  Since hot pepper paste is not something I have on hand, I substituted some roasted pepper antipasto and garlic.  A wonderful cook also suggested to puree' some roasted red pepper.   The directions did not say whether to drain the kimchi but there wasn't much liquid anyhow.  Kimchi was tough and I had to add more salt.
