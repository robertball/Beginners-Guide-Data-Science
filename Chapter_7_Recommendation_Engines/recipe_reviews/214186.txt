the taste was average, not wonderful but not bad... had a problem with using the bag to coat the chicken and it made a big mess and was time consuming.

Didn't like the taste. Plus decided to deep fry some drumsticks with this recipe and was awful!

I guess I did not get the temp right on the oil because I cooked it for way longer then told and my thighs were still pink inside.  Also when I put it on a higher temp to get it cooking it burned on each side.  I guess I will try this again but with drumsticks as thighs might be too thick for this.

Was way to salty for me. The mixture in the bag clumped up & I had to finish off in a bowl. Will not be making again.

This recipe has promise, but needs a little help. First, Iâ€™d cut back on the salt. The other difficulty I had was that the breading was pretty dark by the time the chicken legs had cooked through. I would use the suggestion of first boiling the chicken legs to avoid burning the coating in the future. I used some of the breading on chicken tenders and it worked very well.

I did like the receipe but it was a lot longer then I thought it would be I used drumsticks.  I did not use salt I used chicken seasonion instead of seasoned salt just to cut down on salt.

Turned out perfect and moist and delicious. Very easy to make. One bowl for egg and milk mixed together. Used a freezer bag for flour and Italian bread crumbs. Plan to make this again.
