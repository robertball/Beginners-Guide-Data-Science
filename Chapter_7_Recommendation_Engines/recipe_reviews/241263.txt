A FABULOUS dish! 

Whatever would a dish be without the balance of flavor and decadence? Hence, the answer was found here amidst the array of lightly fine fresh seasonings utilized.. creating a saucy, delicate ~POT ROAST~ dripping roast with tender flavour! I applaud this recipe which simmered into reminiscing savory entree, causing satiety with a light texture! WALLAH.. and there you have it,  a perfect meal! Thank You!

Makes a delicious roast. I nixed the salt as there is plenty in the Montreal Steak spice (which my wife didn't like so much, but I thought it was fine). Used Australian Shiraz instead of Merlot-it's what was available for a similar outcome. I chopped up a couple onions to layer on the bottom of the slow cooker before the beef went in. I also added carrots and celery.  There is ample gravy beginnings with this recipe, so it will pair well with mashed potatoes so you can slather it all over everything and not run out. 

This kind of recipe is very forgiving, so don't be afraid to experiment and change things as you need to.

This was one of the best pot roasts I've ever made, but there are several factors that affect that comment. I used an Angus chuck roast which is the very best. I used the ingredients and quantities as listed EXCEPT I omitted the salt. I read a review that said she cut the Montreal seasoning in half because it was too salty; I chose to leave the Montreal alone and eliminate the salt. I had jug Burgundy, so I used it. I sprayed the roast before applying the rub mixture and browned it really well in a sprayed pan on my gas grill (to avoid a mess in the kitchen). When I transferred the meat to the cooker, I added the liquids to the pan I'd used on the grill and scraped up all of the seasonings so as not to leave all of that flavor behind. It is wonderful and I've reduced the liquid in a pot, added mushrooms and served it over mashed potatoes!!

Full of Flavor! Amazing. my husband told me he wanted a pot roast.  I found this recipe and followed everything EXCEPT for the salt. After reading everyone's reviews I didn't add salt. the Montreal steak seasoning has enough.  I also added red potatoes,  carrots,  and mushrooms to the pot. so I did add a little extra wine and water with half an extra packet of au ju sauce so i had enough gravy with all the sides. I cooked a 3 1/2lb roast for 8 people. Everyone loved it. DELICIOUS!

This was very good. As I did not have the Montreal seasoning I used instead a prime rib rub. The prime rib rub contains rosemary already and I added thyme to it as the recipe suggests.  I rubbed seasoning on to 2.5 lbs roast. I seared the meat on all sides in Olive oil. I cut up potatoes carrots onions and celery and added those to the crock pot. I place the meat into the crock pot adding the au jus and onion mix. I poured Cabernet sauvignon over the top of the roast. I also used one can of beef consume`.  One cup of water.  Cooked on high for 4 hrs.  Made a quick roux in a saucepan and added broth from the crockpot until I got the thickness of gravy I desired.

I did what everybody does and made a lot of changes.  I should have stuck with the main recipe.  I started with a 2 and 1/2 pound chuck roast.  I sprayed my crockpot with cooking oil and placed sliced onions on the bottom.  I seasoned my roast as per the recipe, but then I floured and browned it in a skillet.  I placed the roast in my crock pot, added potatoes and carrots.  Although the roast was tender and juicy and the veggies cooked to perfection, I did not care for the overall flavor at all.  It could have been because of the wine I used.  Maybe the Malbec would have made a big difference.  I won't try it again.  There are too many other good pot roast recipes that I will try until I find the perfect one for me.

Used chuck roast, a healthy tablespoon of homemade Ranch Mix, Au juice packet and a cup of Burgundy cooking wine/water. Slow six hours, added carrots, celery and potatoes, cooked high for two hours.  Fantastic.

I made this slow cooker pot roast this morning and it was ready in 7 hours.  That part was great! Very tender and smelled fabulous as well when we walked in the door eagerly anticipating our dinner.  Here was the down side . Use either none or very very little salt.  The Au Jus mix and French Onion soup has plenty of salt!!! Adding the tablespoon full required in the recipe, made it way too salty! Otherwise it was very flavorful!

This has great potential, but the salt content made this almost inedible. I followed the recipe exactly, but I think I’ll have to tweak it to make it work.

This is a great recipe!  The meat gets perfectly cooked and then you can turn the drippings into a very flavorful gravy.  My only change is that I cut the rub amount in half.  I made it before with the full amount and it was way too salty.  Cutting it in half was just about right.  Loved it!

Turned out great!  It did smoke the kitchen a bit when I was browning it but what’s cooking without a little smoke?  I did omit the salt and it was plenty salty enough. I also cooked it on top potatoes, carrots and onion.

This was so easy to make and absolutely delicious!  I always read reviews so I did what many did and left out the salt.  I added sweet onions to the bottom as well as baby carrots.  I also copied someone and added an additional half package of Au Jus Sauce with some water to ensure I would have enough gravy.  I think I would have had plenty had I not done that.  I also used Pinot Noir as that was all I had - still delicious!  I passed this recipe along to some friends who had it last night.  They thought the same - DELICIOUS - as did their guests!  Thank you for an easy, YUMMY recipe!

Do not cook this pot roast for 5 hours unless you want your meat over done and all dried out.  Only cook for about 2 hrs for tender succulent beef.

Absolutely amazing! I substitute cabernet sauvignon since that’s my favorite wine. To cut fat, I’ve used a large pork tenderloin as well and the family loved it. I substituted beef gravy mix bc I didn’t have au jus on hand. Also, added carrots, potatoes and celery occasionally. I didn’t add extra salt but did add garlic and onion powder to taste. I wouldn’t skip the browning step! Best roast I’ve ever made!

I always make recipes twice (especially if I think there has been a mistake)  in this case the recipe called for 1 TBS  of dried Thyme. That is a whole lot of a very strong herb! It literally gave it an earthy (more like dirt) flavor.  The second time I used 1/4 teaspoon Thyme....much better and we loved it, easy to make too.  The dog ate the first one for a week, would have given it a 5 too.

Followed the recipe to the “T” aside from using just over 4lbs of meat so I had to double up on the ingredients. Awesome flavors and a recipe that’s very flexible as far as steak seasoning and the wine. Adjust salt to taste, between the steak seasoning and added salt for the rub there’s quite a bit if you’re needs require less salt.

My hubby and I loved this recipe! The roast was moist and tender and the gravy was so flavorful and looked so rich and deep in color. I eliminate the salt as there is plenty in the other seasonings. I served the roast over polenta and petite peas. Delicious! This one is a keeper!

This is a delicious pot roast!  Came out so tender and flavorful, not too salty.  The only substitute I made was to use a beef bullion cube instead of the aus jus mix, I dissolved a 2cup cube into the cup of water. YUMMY!

One of my families favorite "comfort food" recipes!   We serve it with the sauce from the pan drippings, mashed potatoes and roasted broccoli.  Delicious!

I added a little bit more wine as we like a lot of sauce.  The next day, I used the juices and added flour to make more of a gravy and put it over rice.

I also cut the salt in half and it was just fine. I added vegetables (potatoes and carrots). Family enjoyed it and I will be making it again.
