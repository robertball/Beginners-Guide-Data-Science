This is very similar to the traditional recipe I know of. The key of steaming eggs is to keep the heat at medium low or low to obtain a smooth surface. I also lay shrimps and ginkgo nuts when the surface is set and steam for about 7 more minutes.

I also decreased the amount of broth by half and the steam eggs were perfectly creamy and soft. Be sure to cook it gently over medium low heat. Instead of the mushroom I added in kernels of cooked corn and minced chicken (raw is fine). I also added a touch of sesame oil. Very yummy.

Wonderfull! I tried this recipie out for brunch today and it was simply delectable. My guests at first were a bit hesitent but found it adictive as they delved into the dish. A suggestion one may wish to decrease the chicken stock to a half cup if one wants a more solid texture to the egg. As the result with one cup can be slightly soupy.

I took the advice of those who reduced the broth but I had no cooked chicken breast. What I did have was leftover lamb and it was FANTASTIC (I figure most any egg dish is essentially an omelet to toss in what you wish anyway). No steamer so I inverted a couple of ramekins into the water to raise the egg filled ones off of the bottom of the bottom of the pot to make sure it was cooking with steam and not direct contact with the heating element. Just like advertised it came out light aromatic and delicious.

I wish I had listened to the earlier reviewers rather than trying to exactly follow the recipe the first time. Half the broth would have been better as it separated out somewhat. Cooking on low heat likely would have produced a smoother end result.

This was quite nice simple flavors that blended well with each other. I made a substitution of the sake with zinfandel. In my bowl I used turkey and in my husband's chicken. Also I threw a bit of green onion on top with the parsley.

I wasn't wowed by this. For the amount of work that went into cooking it I expected a better dish. Flavor was bland and uninteresting. Texture was nice and smooth though and aesthetically it was a nice dish to serve to dinner party guests. I woudn't make this specific recipe again. It wasn't bad. It just wasn't very flavorful.

The kids liked them a lot and asked for me to make them again. My husband and I thought that they were just OK. Maybe on a cold winters day. Tasted similar to egg drop soup but the consistency was..different.

Definitely calls for too much broth but aside from that this was delicious and fast. Versatile too - I didn't use the sake or mushrooms but used chicken onions and a little cumin. Great recipe!

Amazing even as a 3 ingredient dish: egg chicken broth and dash of Taiwanese Rice Wine rather than sake. The texture as is was perfect... soft and silky. Can't wait to make this again with shiitake mushrooms and prawns.

I love the simplicity and versatility of this dish. You can hardly go wrong. I used pieces of shrimp instead of chicken. I love the fact that you can use less eggs although I am going to try it sometime with reduced broth to see if the texture changes.

It has a weird taste that i m not completely used to. Don t have small tea glasses so i poured the entire batch into one large coffee mug. Added 3 minutes to the steam time. Despite mixing the chicken and mushrooms beforehand the chicken sank and mushrooms floated to the top so i reccommend stirring your cup after steaming to get a nice combination of the flavors. This may be at the cost of texture though which is something like a pudding. All in all a nice savory dish that i d use as lunch or appatizer on any occasion.
