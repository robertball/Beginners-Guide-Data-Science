Really good recipe.  Just what I was looking for!  I would have given it five stars, but I did make a couple of adjustments.  Following the advice of a few other reviewers, I only used 1 tsp of cumin (I just knew 1 tbsp would be too much as my dh doesn't like cumin, plus it makes it easier to measure out--all the spices are 1 tsp!), and I added a 1/2 tsp or so of salt.

I am always on the lookout for easy recipes that can replace the mixes available at the grocery store (too many chemicals and msg in most of them for me).  This one fit the bill!

I really liked this recipe. Though I used instant rice and cooked it on the stove instead of baking for a quicker and easier meal. I also didn't measure how much spices I put in, I basically measured to taste. It went awsome with Our Enchilada casserole!

This was very good rice really close to the resturants. I almost ruin mine by trying to cook it on the stove top, other reviewers stated they had done this, did not work for me, my rice started to stick and burn, I quickly remove from stove top, put in oven dish and cooked it that way, it did come out a little over cooked, but that was my fault, it still had that mexican red rice flavor that you get at mexican resturants. As far as the rest of the recipe I followed it exactly. I served with cheese enchiladas and a red chile sauce

This is really good stuff!  I'm a vegetarian, so I use vegetable broth and I don't measure the spices, I love cumin, so there's probably more. With those being the only exceptions...I'm not a repeat recipe user, but I'm making this for the second time tonight, it deserves a great rating!

Update: The second time I made this it came out really dry.  I switched recipes and the only difference between them is the tomato paste versus tomato sauce.  I like the tomato sauce WAY better.  Still a good recipe, but not as quick or as good as my new one!

I made a big batch for a mexican dinner and it was great. I used Uncle Bens rice and used the amount of chicken stock required by the box directions and it was perfect. The amount of cumin may be too much for some, but I liked it.

I thought this was great!  I used brown rice and tomato sauce and just baked it a little longer.  Great texture and taste.

I cooked this at in my cast iron skillet to avoid having to wash two dishes.  I live at 9300 feet, and despite the altitude it came out FANTASTIC. :)  I used saffron instead of chili powder.

Very good.  Just the right amount of spice for us.  Could easily increase the heat if you wanted.  This was just as easy, if not easier, than a box but tasted sooo much better.  Fresh and homemade cannot be beat.

I made this on the stove top like a risotto (I've had horrible experiences cooking rice in the oven in the past), and it turned out great. I added about an extra can of chicken broth while the rice simmered, and I think my cumin must be a bit old because I added a couple more tablespoons of it to get the right flavor for us. It's a bit of a pain, but I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks!

This is so easy and comes out great each time.  Very good basic recipe to tweak to your liking.  I like baking it to keep it on the drier side.  There are so many directions that you can take this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Great basic recipe, I was looking for a baking recipe instead of stovetop and used this as a basic recipe for a main meal...I added bit of paprika and oregano, less chilli and then canned tomatoes, a can of kidney beans, a can of black beans, and topped with cheese once it was cooked and cooked under the grill (broiler) til brown and bubbly.  Delicious!  Served w/ freshly cut tomato, as that was all I had, thanks for a great staple recipe!

Very good. I made this in my rice cooker and used a tablespoon of garlic powder, chili powder and cumin. I left out the onion and used tomato sauce instead of tomato paste. I also used chicken bullion instead of the chicken broth. I dissolved this in the water before mixing in all the other ingredients and starting the rice cooker.

The recipe was PERECT. I made dinner for the in-laws on Christmas Eve and wanted something homemade and this recipe did not disappoint. I made it exactly as stated. Very easy yet flavorful. Next time I might add a bit more "heat" to it as I like my mexican food with some kick, but it was very tasty as is. If you are looking for an easy mexican rice recipe, I encourage you to give this one a try. Five Stars, a winner!

The thing missing with this to me is that the rice should be cooked a few minutes in the hot oil before the onions are done.  Then the spices and tomato paste (do not substitute sauce) should be added and stirred around until the rice is a sticky mess.  Then add the broth.  The "frying" of the rice seems to keep it from getting mushy.  Also, be sure your liquid level (including the liquids from the veggies/paste) are in line with what is recommended for the type of rice you are cooking.  No idea how this would turn out with instant rice, but I hate the stuff so I am a bit biased.  I also like to add some carrots (first) and some cilantro (after cooking), but to each his own.

I followed the directions exactly and this rice turned out to be a giant sticky mess.  The rice didn't get soft.  It's crispy like it didn't cook at all.  I looked back to make sure I measured everything correctly, and I did.  Not sure what happened to it.

This is a good recipe to keep.  Next time though I'll use less cumin and more tomato sauce.  It didn't have a tomato taste or taste like the restraunt rice in my area.  Still looking for the perfect recipe.

I loved it! I will be making again. I did make it with the tomato sauce.  I think I will try the paste next time as I like a little more dry but it was the best I've had so far.

This was excellent! My family loves Mexican food. I made this recipe without changing anything and it came out perfect. We had a full spread of Mexican food which included the guacamole (by Bob Cody)and dinner was just delicious. My husband could not stop talking about how good dinner was. We will be making this recipe again very soon. Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good! I think there was a little too much tomato paste, cause I would've liked it to be stickier. It needed a little kick of something spicy too. I also am not sure about the whole "baking" thing, instead of making it the usual way on the stove.

I gave it 4 stars becuase it's quick, easy, can be paired with anything, but isn't amazing tasting. It tastes good though and I would use this again. I did like another person and reduced the cumin to 1 tsp. I might try 2 tsp next time, but I think 1 Tablespoon was too much unless you really like cumin. I also cooked it on the stove top and had to add 1/4 more water. If you choose to try it on the stove top after everything is added bring it back to a boil then reduce the heat to low and cook until done. Mine took about 25 minutes, but I kept messing with it. Great side and a easy to make and follow recipe.

My new go to rice!! I love putting it in the oven setting the timer (checking for done-ness) then turn the oven off; let it sit there till guest have arrived and everything is on the table! Stays hot!! I had to use tomato sauce instead of paste. I also added salt and pepper. Brown the rice with the onion, garlic and seasoning to keep it firm and not mushy. I barely brought mine to a boil before putting in the casserole dish. Taste the liquid before adding it to the casserole dish to see if it needs salt. Easy to tweak to your liking!! Remember, different types of rice require different amounts of liquid and cooking times vary. I used Brown Basmati Rice which requires a bit more cooking time. Just remember to check your rice for done-ness... it takes practice :)

I have made this recipe now a few times and we love it! I also used tomato sauce instead of tomato paste. I also added 1 cup of black beans. The black beans really make this an outstanding side dish! This is a simple and very tasty dish. Perfect for serving with any mexican main dish!

This was incredibly simple to make; it took no time at all. I added a little sweetcorn and a dash of chilli pepper but prepared it as per the recipe. I served it with Colourful Vegetable Fajitas from this site.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did like another and added more broth and simmered it on the stove top, but may try the oven method next time.  It was an easy recipe and I had all the ingredients on hand!  Thanks for sharing!

EXCELLENT!!  This was comparable to our favorite mexican restaurant's rice.  The only change I made due to necessity (out of regular rice), used minute rice, instead and increased rice by 1 cup (making enough for 10 servings, btw).  Turned out beautifully.

This was awesome.  Only used half the amount of cumin.  Next time will only use 3/4 of the amount of tomato paste.

Really really delicious! Both my husband AND my toddler loved this.  I used:  Olive oil instead of vegetable.  Only 1/4 red onion instead of whole.  1 cloves fresh minced garlic Only used 1 tsp cumin instead of 1 tbs Added 1/2 tsp salt, per other reviewers Jasmine rice "Better Than Bullion" chicken broth Hunt's Basil/ Garlic/ Oregano paste

This has become a family favourite...even making my 82 year old Dad ask for more. I have made it exactly as written...and loved it, but me being me,  I always mess with every recipe. So...to an already great recipe, I added 1/2 C salsa (instead of tomato paste), and some cilantro. When I serve it, I top with some cheese and green onions. Yum!!!!

Great flavor.  I love the Spanish rice mixes from the store but I did not have one for taco night so decided to try this.  Glad I did because this is much better and easy!

This was bland so I added mexican blend cheese and some salt and pepper. That did the trick for me. It was really good. Next time I will add some tomatoes and peppers. Oh and the cheese is a must. I might even try making a main dish with some taco seasoned ground beef in it. Thanks fo posting.

I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time was for my daughters grad. open house and I quadrupled the recipe.  The recipe is easy and inexpensive to make.  Each time I have made it I have been asked for the recipe.  My family likes it because they want a Mexican rice without a bunch of veggies in it!

Very simple and very good!
I did tweak it some.  I did add some Rotel.  I also made my own chicken broth and made sure it had plenty of flavor.
Fixed this for a Mexican dinner at our church for 200 people and it went over great.  Much easier than on top of the stove. 
Next time I think I may try adding some corn and green peppers.

This was good and simple to make.  I also added 1/2 tsp of salt and reduced the cumin to 1 tsp.  
I thought it could use a little more something... don't know what.  (A little Sour Cream from my plate helped.)  I might add a little cheddar cheese to it next time to give it some more flavor.
I made this as a side to the "Salsa Chicken" on this site which is awesome!

I made this as a side dish for a dinner for my in-laws (who are English and don't get much Mexican food). It was easy and delicious. They loved the entire meal which included Mexican Lasagna II from this site, but they particularly loved this rice and asked for the recipe.

I don't know what I did wrong, but I followed the directions and my rice never cooked properly.  I tried it on three different occassions to see if I had done something wrong and tweaked it a bit each time to help it, but I got the same results.  I was hoping this would turn out, since it would help to cook it in the oven with what I usually make it with, but to no avail, I'll continue to make my mexican rice on the stovetop.  Had great potential, but just didn't work out for me.

This was really good. I used olive oil to saute the onions and garlic, cut the spices back to 1/2 tsp each and added 1/2 tsp of parsley. I would love to try this full strength but hubs can't tolerate spicy dishes. I have tried this both stove top and in the oven as suggested. The oven method is by far the better way to prepare this, the rice was well done and tender. The timing was bang on, it took 35 mins. Thanks Elizabeth.

Made for a not so spicy crowd- so cut down the chili powder to half tsp. and cumin to 1 tsp. added a tsp. of salt and used tomato sauce as I was out of tomato paste and baked in a very heavy Dutch oven. Came out fluffy (not saucy) and lovely added a 1/4 cup of pico de gallo when finished and was very pretty and delicious!

This recipe lacked something for me.  I was expecting it to taste similar to the rice at Mexican restuarants, but it didn't.  Also, the rice came out crunchy and I had to keep adding extra chicken broth.  I would not make this recipe again.

Excellent and simple! Both of my very picky kids loved this and so did I! I did as another commenter mentioned and used instant rice, and cooked on the stove only. Still turned out great, although I'll try it out it as is next time.

This rice is a good start, but it needs a little something more to be truly tasty. I loved it once I put sour cream, hot sauce, and shredded cheddar on it.

Good recipe. I added salt and pepper along with the cumin and chili powder, and substituted 1/2 can of tomato paste with tomato sauce. It was similar to the rice served at Mexican resteraunts.

this was delicious! i accidentally added a bit too much of the chicken boullion (it fell out of the bag as i was pouring), but except for that it was great! i didn't measure out the spices, just did it by guessing, and i used mostly sweet paprika, otherwise it's too spicy... but it was good!

I used brown rice and tweaked the spices to taste.  Tastes just like the Mexican Rice at our favorite Mexican Restaurant. Served this with Grilled Mexican Shrimp.  No leftovers.  Will make this a weekly side dish.

I thought this was a easy and yummy recipe. I used instant rice and doubled it for left overs. Will definitely make again!

This was pretty good and will probably make again for an easy side dish for Mexican fare. However, it is very basic - I think it needed a little more spice or seasoning to perfect it. Thanks!

Much better than the box!!! i left the same amount of cumin and put in about 4 tbsp of lemon juice. I didnt want to get out another dish so i left it in the sauce pan and it came out fine. Also i added some saffron and paprika to give it that lovely orange color without artificial dyes.

Absolutely YUMMY! Surprisingly, with all of the Mexican dishes that my grandmother passed down to my mom (who is not Mexican), this recipe never made it, so I've never made it from scratch, only using a box mix in the past. This came out so good, even with it being left in the oven too long (had to leave the house, forgot the rice!), it came out perfect!! I used a little more chili powder, but fresh onion and garlic, and next time I may add some green chilis, too. This was so easy, I'll never have to use Rice-a-Roni again. Thanks for the terrifically simple recipe :-)

Very good, simple recipe. After I started I reallized that I did not have any cumin.  Instead of the chili powder and cumin, I used taco seasoning.  Also added red pepper and corn.  Prepared on the stovetop and put in the oven just like recipe states.  I cooked it at 375 because the chicken recipe I was using needed that temp.  It worked great.  My family loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Good, but a tablespoon of each spice is needed to taste any flavor.  In addition, I burned the rice casserole on the edge when cooking for 35 min, so make sure to watch it carefully.

Good Recipe. I suggest cutting down on the cumin as it is almost too overwhelming in the overall flavor. I also added corn and green and red peppers to the casserole. Will make again!

Excellent yet easy to make!  I've been using this same recipe for years and love it.  A little bit of diced red and green pepper added to it gives it a special flavor and makes the dish festive and colorful!  I'll keep making this family favorite!

Perfect side dish for Mexican night. I was able to put this in the oven and not have to babysit it. During that time I made the Enchiladas Suizas to put in after I pulled the rice out. Great recipe. No changes!

I'm on a low sodium diet awaiting a kidney transplant. I added no salt until the rice was on my plate. Just a small amount of salt and a little cheese, just to make me feel like I was getting something lol, and this rice was actually very good. I was surprised, bc honestly, without a pinch of salt it is an entirely different taste. But it didn't take much. 

Also, I missed the preheat the oven step. And could not find the temp. I was overlooking in my panic. I quickly turned the oven on, to 425, and even though the mixture was bubbling in my pan I just kept whisking. When the oven reached temp, I put the pan mixture in a 2 qt baking dish and baked for 20 min at 425. Came out beautifully!

With minimal changes, it was really good! I only have tomato sauce, not paste, and I'm not a big tomato lover, so the amount of tomato flavor was perfect.  I'd never put cumin in anything before, so I followed the advice of other cooks and used only 1 teaspoon. I used Calrose rice. I hate it when recipes say, "1 onion".  How big of an onion?  Some are 2 inches around, some are 5 inches around.  I used half of a 4 inch, about 1/2 cup chopped.  It makes a lot of rice, though.  Next time I'll try half a recipe.

Totally absolutely decent, but not mind-blowing. I had to cut down on the spices a bit because I was feeding a three-year-old, and I realized too late (like, five minutes ago) that I should have used short instead of long-grain rice. Which probably made a difference, and I wish I'd noticed that before! I do like the tomato paste. There are so many mexican rice recipes out there, though, and - even taking into account my errors and changes - I'm not sure this is The One. Thanks, though!

Instead of white rice, I used brown. Other than that the only changes I made were to cut back the cumin to 1 tsp instead of 1 Tbsp. I also didn't have any tomato paste or sauce so I used 1/4 cup of salsa. Delicious!!

I thought this was really tasty. I fried my rice for a few seconds before adding the liquid. It was just right. Not too dry and not too sticky. The only thing is next time i would cut the chili in half probably. Thanks!

I was surprised that everyone in my household liked this because of the tomato base, but they did.  We weren't fond of the cumin, which I had cut in 1/2, and might try to add more chili powder next time and less cumin.

This was OK, not great - better as a filling with tacos or burritos than plain. It was a little more soupy than I like my rice. I used brown rice, so had to increase the cooking time. Also - the foil scratched up my casserole dish, so I will just use the lid for the dish next time.

I was having a group of people over for dinner one night and had planned on serving Chicken Enchiladas V(from this site) but I had no idea what I wanted to serve with them. I stumbled upon this recipe and it fit the bill. I followed the advice of others and just threw in enough taco seasoning for the rice since I had the pre-made handy. Also, I didn't have tomato paste on hand so I used a small can of tomato sauce. It still turned out fine though slightly mushy, which could have been a product of using the sauce as opposed to the paste. I'll have to give this another go when I have tomato paste stocked in my pantry.

I followed this recipe to the T and the rice was not cooked.  My family would not eat it.  I'm thinking that i probably should have boiled the uncooked rice for at least 10 minutes.  The recipe does not specify how long to boil it.

I stumbled upon this recipe in my search for a simple side dish to use up the remainder of my can of tomato paste.  While this was super easy to prepare, it was nothing really spectacular.  Decent dish with OK flavour, but nothing I will rush to make again, there is another Mexican Rice on this site that we prefer, thanks anyway!

This was simple and very good. I didn't have cummin so I used adobe seasoning. I also didn't have tomato paste so I used a can of stewed tomatoes chopped fine and two big squirts of ketchup. This is a keeper recipe, good for family get togethers. Thanks Elizabeth101

This recipe really was easy and made with ingredients right at hand.  Instead of cumin I used coriander so the flavor was a little lemony.  But I still thought it was great.  Will make again.

This recipe was perfect. I  followed the recipe as written, except I used 1 tsp of cumin instead of 1 Tbs. The flavor was fine to me but I could see how one might want to add more spices. I always end up with leftover tomato paste from other recipes, and this is a great way to use it up.

This got rave reviews!  I added a diced green pepper, halved the cumin but will add more chili powder next time.  I sped thing up by cooking it in the microwave.

This is delicious - one of the few recipes that I don't change.  The only thing I do differently is  I just crush the garlic instead of mincing.  This is a staple for us - we never make enchiladas without it!

I thought this was a great recipe to start with. I was getting tired of mine because my husband thought it just tasted like chicken, but this recipe does have that authentic mexican rice flavor to it. I took the advice from another rater and only used a little of the cumin. The results were great in the oven, and that is the only way I will go for now on because the rice does not stick or burn at the bottom of my casserole dish. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This was easy to make and had I not needed my big fry pan I would have put the lid on that and thrown it in the oven to save a dirty dish.  I thought the flavor on this to be a little on the bland side.  If I made it again I would add salt and peppar for sure.  Thanks for sharing.

We made this at the last minute as a side for the Cheddar Beef Enchiladas (By Stacy Cizek).  It is really easy to make and is great as a side dish with other, spicier foods.

Excellent!  I followed the recipe but did add 3/4 can of drained black beans.  It turned out as good as any I've ever tried.  Thanks!

I made this as directed and found it to be a very good, basic recipe.  It is what it professes to be: simple mexican rice!  Thanks for the uncomplicated recipe that is better and healthier than the prepackaged mixes.

This was just ok for me.  I was expecting rice like I get from the restaurant.  I think because I live in Texas I am spoiled to really great mexican food.  This recipe was just missing something.  I will try it again with a few changes & see how it goes.

This was so simple to make and good tasting too. I think i prefer it with chunks of tomatoes in it like my mother-in-law makes. I will add maybe a can of drained tomatoes next time.

This is really excellent, but needs some alterations.  I used brown rice, and it just wouldn't absorb the thick sauce.  So next time I'll just cook the rice separately, using chicken broth, then add the sauce.  Also, since my daughter doesn't like spicy foods, I halfed the cumin and the chili powerder, and this really had wonderful flavor.  I'll definitely be making this again soon.

Made recipe according to directions.  Came out dry and slightly chewy, even when cooked the proper amount of time.  Only made it because I didn't have tomato sauce for my favorite mexican rice recipe on here (Mexican Rice II).  Thought I would try this one since I had tomato paste.  Sorry, but I won't make this again.

don't let it sit to long it'll turn gummy.   add salt to flavor it. overall my DH liked it and he normally hates mexican rice.
