This is a very excellent tuna salad recipe and I have been making almost the exact recipe for many years!    After slicing my apple off of the core, I dip in lemon juice to keep it from browning.  I also like to throw in a little chopped celery and use chopped red onion.  The red onion and apple combination - mmmm!

Very good.  I've had apples in chicken salad but never in tuna--it worked!  After making as written I found it a little dry for my taste, so I doubled the mayo and pickle relish.  I just used a dash of salt and pepper.  Yum!

This was a very good recipe.  I did add a lot more mayo though because without it the recipe was way too dry.

Great flavor, and love the added touch of the apples!! Added shredded carrot for extra color/flavor/texture.  I was out of onion, so added onion powder/flakes, which I prefer any way for a smoother tuna salad!! Went well atop my salad for lunch @ work!!

Really great.  I made it per the recipe.  The pic shown has to have more than 1 T of mayo.  Mine didn't look like that at all.  But it was really good and I'm sure I'll make it again and again.

This was surprisingly really good. I tend to like tuna the way I grew up on it & don't usually stray from that. But, I had a juicy apple sitting there and I thought "what the heck". Since I'm only making one serving, I halved the recipe. They must make tuna cans smaller because mine is 5 oz. I used the white albacore in water. I wasn't sure what to think of adding olive oil, but I really liked it. I did use a bit less and added more mayo, but I like the subtle flavor of a good olive oil in there. I used a bit less apple because it seemed to be too much for the amount of tuna. I only had dill pickles so I used a bit less dill. It's a really nice change of pace from my normal tuna salad. Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful.  Double the mayo and add 1/4 cup of pecans and it is perfection!  Serve on toasted bread with lettuce and a thin slice of tomato.

My husband absolutely loved it. Wasn't to sure about the apples in his tuna, but he said they added a nice crunch to the tuna salad. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe saved me on a day when I was out of celery, and we liked it with the apple!  I did add some slivered almonds for a little extra crunch.

So simple but very good! I served it on top of another recipe on this web site, "Salad with Artichokes". I'm not a fan off dill so let it out and added almond slivers. This taste like something you would buy in a nice cafe.

Super recipe! I didn't bother with the olive oil, just added an extra T of mayo instead. Delicious light meal.

Really, really good.  We used red onion and, per another reviewer's tip, added a small, shredded carrot.  The taste of the salad was a little flat with just the apple; adding the carrot really perked it up.

I have made this recipe many times since I found it on here.  It is sooooo good.  It does need more mayo to be added to it.  I just add more mayo until it is the consistency I like.  I also add 2 ribs of celery for some added crunch. This is completely worth a try if you are looking for a nice twist on plain old tuna salad.

As written, it was very good. Made it again and left apple peels on and used heaping tablespoons of relish, and it was excellent. Hubby loved it! Trying it with chicken in place of tuna tonight-yum!

The only thing I changed is that I probably almost tripled the mayo. Otherwise it's great.  Might swap for chicken and add grapes the next time.  Either way I will DEFINITELY add hard boiled eggs.

Delicious.  A great way to get protein and veggies- even better the next day served ice cold. My only substitution was a green spring onion from the farmer‚Äôs market.

This is perfect to eat when its a hot day outside and you don't want to turn the oven on!  The only thing i did different was that i added a little bit of celery and made it into a sandwich and used rye bread, it was sooo good with the apple in it!

I'm from South Texas,  we like a little heat in our food, so instead of sweet pickle relish I used sweet pickled jalapenos.  It is wonderful.

I grew up in Texas and we just call this Tuna Salad.  Instead of the relish and dill, we chop up a few dill pickle slices.  We also add a chopped up hard boiled egg and a bit more mayo.  I moved to Indiana and was shocked that no one puts apples in tuna salad! Everyone that tries it, though loves it :)

I don't normally like tuna, so the fact that I actually liked this recipe is really saying something. I made it for a luncheon as a sandwich filling on rolls. Almost everyone had at least two helpings (or more). I like how the tuna flavor is disguised and muted by the other flavors.

I really enjoyed the fresh zip of the apple.  I added another apple and celery to the recipe.  It was a light and refreshing.  I added lettuce to make a great salad for Weight Watchers.

I totally loved this tuna salad.  I like moist sandwiches and am a Miracle Whip girl.  Adding 3 times the Mayo as Miracle Whip was the only chance I made.   I ate it right after I made it.  Can't wait to see if it can really be better after a day in the fridge,

My wife and I enjoyed this tuna salad.  After working out with weights I thought 'this can of tuna is boring' and seen some apples. Found this recipe and we enjoyed a small meal.  Thanks for posting!

Not bad! I was a little hesitant because I've never added anything to my tuna other than the traditional mayonnaise, pepper, salt, and the occasional celery.

APPLE SELECTION: I used a "Gold Rush" apple picked from my local orchard. According to them, this apple is really good for salads and dips, which seemed appropriate for tuna salad. It was sweet, but not too sweet, and had a nice crisp to it. I'd recommend it to others, if you can get it!

I did not have dill weed or onion, but I don't think missing either affected how tasty this is. The apple and tuna are the main ingredients you taste, with a little hint of relish flavor (I used B&G sweet relish I had in the fridge from the hot dog days of summer.) 

Yes, you WILL need more mayonnaise, it is dry as written.  :)

This was ok for something different, but it's not something I would make again. The dill was too overpowering for my taste.
