I gave this 5 stars because my family loved it when I made it last night (I did make a few changes though mostly because I already had an idea for a soup I wanted to make and I was just looking for something similar to see what seasonings were used). Things I did different were that I added an 11.5 oz can of V8 juice, eliminated the potatoes and cabbage and added 3 stalks of celery, a diced up zucchini and about a cup of fresh green beans. I also added a can of cannellini beans and a can of mushrooms. I didn't use the whole peppercorns but used fresh ground black pepper, used dried parsley rather than fresh, and didn't use marjoram or celery seed since I didn't have them. I also added garlic powder and basil. To the meatballs I added Italian seasoning because I was concerned they wouldn't have enough flavor compared to the rest of the soup.

This is a very good soup, and you can use whatever veggies you like or have on hand, and I think it would probably turn out good with anything you add.

I loved the fact that you cook the meatballs right in the soup making for a one-pot dinner. However, I had a lot of grease, so I think next time I'll make the soup a day ahead of time and then remove the harden grease before reheating the next day. I just had it for lunch, and it's even better the next day!

I think this is a good starter recipe, but I will definitely make some changes the next time I make it. I really loved all the veggies and seasonings, but found the meatballs to be a little bland. I also adjusted the cooking time/order. I was concerned the veggies would be too soft to cook them for as long as directed, so I combined the broth, tomatoes and seasonings… then added the meatballs… let that cook for approx 45 mins… then added the veggies for another half hour. Thanks, Carolyn!

Delicious and warming on a cold winter's night! I follow the seasonings called for in the recipe but changed up the broth and veggies according to what I had on hand. That's the beauty of soup! I also added Italian seasoning to the meatballs per a suggestion, added some tiny pasta, and shortened the cooking time significantly (to maybe 45 minutes - just until the veggies were soft and the beef was cooked through). Next time I might also add a can of beans for extra fiber and protein. This one is a keeper!

I did not change a thing about this recipe except to add one cup of chicken stock to the cooking liquid.  I also added a cup and a half of frozen peas along with the meatballs.  
The vegetables were not overcooked and the meat was perfectly tasty with the called for seasonings.
