I followed the recipe exactly for my first time out.  My husband and I really liked the flavor, though it was too spicy for our three-year-old.  The only thing I would change is that I wouldn't puree everything.  We like our chowder a little chunkier, so I'll leave corn, potato and onion chunks aside when I puree next time.  But I'll definitely make it again.  My husband is a very confirmed meat/dairy eater and he had no idea this was vegan.  I served it in bread boules for the adults and made mini-boules for the kids out of rolls.  Fun, easy and warm/spicy on a cold New England night.

I'm a vegetarian and not a vegan so I didn't have any problem with using margarine. I used real milk, substituted green chilis for the red, and skipped the lime. It was totally yummy! My fiance made some homemade bread to complete the meal which I definitely recommend if you have a breadmaker. This recipe says that there are 6 servings but I think we will get closer to 10-12 out of it.

This was way too watery. I ended up draining off most of the broth... I didn't drain my cans of corn, so maybe that was my problem.  Unfortunately I didn't make this revelation until after I made a big mess with my first batch in the food processor.  After draining most of the liquid off, this chowder had a really nice flavor.  I didn't have red chilis so I subbed a small can of green chilis.  I will definately make again and drain the corn and half the broth.

Yum, this is tasty! Thanks for the great recipe. So many vegan recipes lack flavor, but this one is downright delicious. And you're right Mary, most margarine contains small amounts of dairy, but many are vegan. I use 'Smart Balance Light' or 'Earth Balance' depending on the consistency of the intended end product.

This was deeee-lish!!! I added a 3rd can of corn and a couple of extra potatoes (combo of yukon, red and russet - all "new" potatoes) and only blended about 3/4 of the soup.  I also only did half the soy milk to keep it nice and thick and I made home made bread bowl to serve in... YUMMMMMY!

I enjoyed this. Just changed a few thigs.  I added more garlic, used real milk and real butter because I need calories.  Otherwise it was very tasty.  Oh I also used frozen toasted corn from Trader Vic's rather then canned corn.

Don't pass this one up! I was skeptical of the chili powder and chile peppers, but the flavors really worked well together. I skipped the parsley (I don't think it would really add too much) and lime juice because I didn't have any. Also cut back on the margarine by a few tablespoons (I use Earth Balance). Served with some crusty bread. Next time I make this I'm going to double this recipe because it went so fast!

Mary, vegan margarine exists, although many commercial varieties do not contain milk solids or butter products, and are therefore vegan.  I check labels very carefully because my breastfeeding daughter is lactose intolerant.

meh. This wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about. I think that next time, I will add one of the cans of corn AFTER blending the soup, and maybe try to leave some potatoes in whole chunks. That may make it more interesting to eat at least.

The only reason I rate this with three stars is because my wife seemed to like it.  I'm not sure what it was about this, weather it was the texture or the flavor but I did not enjoy this recipe, sorry.

I used this soup to get a few meatless meals in on the kiddos.  This went over really well (though I omitted the red chiles for them).  I liked the tang which really sets this apart from the classic corn chowder.

Because this was a dinner my children would be eating with me, I didn't use the peppers.  This was fantastic ... even my picky 6-year-old ate it!  Will surely make this again (hopefully with the heat!).

I don't have a slow cooker so I pre boiled the onion, chili and potato until jut soft, then put the rest of the ingredients in and put the pot into a very low oven for a few hours - this is really worth trying - I'll be making it again

Umm... not terrible. Not great. I'm not sure what this was, but it wasn't corn chowder. The flavor is very intense. I'm not sure if it is a soup. I almost wanted to put it over rice as if it were an Indian dish (although it didn't taste like Indian food). My husband said he liked this, but he didn't eat the leftovers. Need I say more?

I have to admit I modified this recipe by accident and on purpose.  I didn't pay attention to the direction to put the butter and soy milk in during the last hour--I put everything in at the beginning.  I also used unsweetened almond milk instead of soy.  Nothing tragic happened!  In place of the peppers and chili powder, I used 2 heaping spoonfuls of Old Bay Seasoning.  This added a nice taste and some kick. Delicious and forgiving!

I made this recipe and it had not even come to a boil yet in the slow cooker after 6 hours. There was no way it was going to be ready in the next hour so I had to take it all out and cook it for about an hour on the stove. 

I also did not add the red chilli peppers, because I knew it would be super spicy with that much chilli powder in it already. And I was right.  My 6 dinner guests were shocked how spicy it was! Some liked it, some it was too spicy for. 

The other substitution I made was swapping light coconut milk for the soy milk and skipped the margarine.  That's pretty disgusting to add to your soup, pure fat. 

With the coconut milk and potatoes it was creamy enough! Please don't add hydrogenated fats to your diet in the name of vegetarianism. Skip it and use coconut milk instead. 

The one thing I liked was the suggestion of lime juice.  So I am remaking this recipe after overhauling the ingredient list and switching it to the stove.

Much better!

Yum! I didn't have vegetable broth. I substituted 1 can of chicken broth. I know it's not vegan but it did taste good. Nice aftertaste. I'm happy to see non dairy alternatives to chowders

This is a hearty flavored corn chowder, and the potatoes give it a good texture and body.  I did not have fresh red chile peppers, so I used 1/2 tsp of ground red pepper.  If you are not partial to that much heat, then you could omit the red pepper because the chili powder would be enough.   I was also surprised at how much firmness was left in the potatoes after 7 hrs, so when I make this again, I will dice those up smaller.   Next time I think I will save the parsley flakes and add them as a garnish at the end, because their flavor was missing.  The onion and corn flavors came through perfectly and this was overall a very well blended chowder. It couldn't get any easier to make!  If you use a regular milk instead of a soy milk, the color will be lighter also, but I really enjoy the soy milk flavor in this recipe.  I intend to make this one again very soon.

I made this on the stove top rather than in slow cooker.  I sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil did not use margarine or lime juice.    I also left out chile peppers.  I only pureed about half of the soup and stirred back in the rest for texture.  It was wonderful and everyone enjoyed in with homemade bread.  I will make this again.

This was a big hit with the family I cook for!  The eldest son has become a vegetarian and I try to look for foods that he can also eat.  This is a great and hearty meal that they gobbled up.  I prepared it as listed except I used Earth Balance for the margarine to keep it vegan and it was delicious!

We've made this a few times and LOVE it! The only thing we change is cow's milk for soy milk - only because we don't drink soy milk. Next time I'll have to double the recipe. It's just not enough!!! YUM!

This is a great basic recipe.  I have used coconut milk instead of soy, which works well, too.  To add more flavor, I have simmered it with a dried chipotle pepper or added 1/2 - 1 tsp of ground chipotle pepper, and that adds a wonderful flavor kick.  I usually add chili lime spice to my bowl and that's the cherry on top!  My husband and 12 yr old son always love this soup!

This soup had pretty good flavor.  I didn't puree, just left it chunky and added some whole wheat pasta to it.  Also used almond milk instead of soy.

Made this for my vegan daughter & asked her how she would rate this (as I made changes).  She asked me, "before or after the hot sauce?"  Before she added hot sauce it was a 4.5.  After the hot sauce it was a 4.75!  Here are the changes I made: Substitued the red pepper for half of a jalapeno; used almond & cocconut mike (as we ran out); Added some crushed red pepper; Didn't use lime; Put half of the mixture in the blender.  Next time, I will drain the corn! Well, my daughter loved it and joked that she will be eating for an entire week!  I suggested we freeze some, but she was fine with having it all week.  We will see!  Thank you for the recipe.

I made this according to directions the first time and found it to be a bit bland.  I added cayenne and Old Bay seasoning to suit my tastes and doubled all the spices.  I'm making it again and will be adding portobello mushrooms to provide a somewhat meaty texture.  Good recipe overall though.
