Wow-oh-Wow!! Great hot sauce! My husband has always wanted to try making hot sauce at home and this turned out great. I had to substitute some jalapenos, just because I couldn't find all the serranos we needed. Just a few suggestions for those new to the world of hot peppers...(1) wear kitchen gloves when taking off the stems (2)remove some or all of the seeds to reduce the heat and (3)wait awhile (and don't inhale) before taking the lid off that blender! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was my first attempt ever making any type of hot sauce. I chose this recipe because of the high quantity of habanero peppers, I like my food hot. I was amazed by how flavorful this sauce is, though I would assume that if you can't handle the heat you won't taste the flavor. I have made two batches of the sauce, the first without seeds and membrane and while delicious in flavor, it didn't pack the punch I was looking for. Round two was better, leaving in all seeds and membranes, I only removed the stems. I shall be making this again, though I could only find a couple people at work that would eat it. Guess that leaves more for me. Oh, and I did reduce the vinegar by about 1/3, not too keen on vinegar hot sauces.

NOT EDIBLE! The recipe needs to be revised to remove all seeds. I used the exact amount of peppers called for, leaving guts in since it didn't call for removal. I put a drop on my tongue and I swear this is poisonous!!! I love spicy food, and I POUR chili powder on Thai cuisine, and this is UNEDIBLE as written. Sorry, 1 star for a waste of my money. (fwiw, I reserved about 1/4 cup and quadrupled with Odwalla mango juice... still hotter than heck!)

great hot sauce for people who like it hot, not for the people who think they like it hot.

AWESOME!!! Added extra garlic, & some fresh lime juice, served it with a self serve taco bar at a party I hosted, & people just loved it!!!  Also, used Chipotle powder in lieu of regular chili powder, & gave it a shot of Applewood liquid smoke! Fantastic recipe!!!

This is a great sauce!  Make sure you wear gloves and don't open the blender right away.  Fabulous!

This is a great recipe if you like hot sauce. With a few additions this could easily be 5 stars. WARNING if you do not like extremely hot sauces this is not the sauce for you.

Excellent! My favorite hot sauce recipe so far. I bring all the hot sauces that I make, for the guy's in the machine shop to try, and this has been their favorite. I didn't grow serrano peppers this year so I used jalapeno's instead. Plus my habanero plant wasn't producing well so I used red savinas. Only other minor change I made was, I added a tiny bit more onion powder and chili powder. Very simple, very quick and very GOOD!! One quick note ... the recipe contains habanero's. If you consider something like Texas Pete a HOT sauce. Then this sauce is not for you, because IT IS HOT! Will be making this one again.

Maybe I should have left some of the seeds in. Not hot at all! But the taste is fair.

I removed all the seeds and membranes from the peppers. The result was a very fresh tasting flavorful sauce. Less hot than I expected.

Great base. I boiled a handful of baby carrots and added small white onion, tbsp of sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of olive oil. Excellent spicy Caribbean flavor. Will make it again.

Thank You. I used a few more habaneros and used banana peppers to make up half of the serranos, since I didn't have any, but it turned out great. perfect heat.
