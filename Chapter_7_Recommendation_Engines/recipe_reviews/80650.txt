All I added was some garlic powder and a few dashed of Frank's Red Hot and this was perfect for "Blooming Onion" from this site.

this is so simple and delicious.. a few people asked for the recipe and were shocked to know how simple it was.  i put in a shallow dish and chopped up some fresh tomatoes from the garden and placed on the top of the dip..  delicious and so simple.

Have used this so many times and haven't gotten the chance to post a review.  I love this stuff.  I use it for roast beef sandwiches and potato cakes.  Delicious.  One of my favorite sauces from the site.  Thanks for the post.

I doubled the recipe and added just a bit more cayenne - this was AMAZING - I made it to dip artichokes in - We are professional "dippers" and this was the best!

I didn't have any ketchup, so I used bbq sauce instead, but I loved it.  Served it with chicken and it was a hit.

I think this a great springboard for more bold flavors.  I had to spice it up because it was too "mayonnaisey" (if that's a word).  I modified the recipe as such:

- 4 tsp ketchup rather than 2 tsp
- prepared horseradish rather than creamy
- 2 tsp smoked paprika rather than 1/4 tsp plain paprika
- 1 tsp salt rather than 1/4 tsp
- 1/4 tsp dried oregano rather than 1/8 tsp
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder

I just found the recipe a little on the bland side and love bold flavors.  I believe it's a great starter sauce, ready for customizing.

This is a very good dipping sauce, thus the 5 stars. However, if you're looking for something with a southwest flavor, I recommend you look elsewhere. I fail to taste any connection to the the southwest here - this is more like a typical thousand island dressing.

Good base recipe. I work at McDonald's and am obsessed with their Southwest sauce. As-is, this recipe is missing something(s) to make it taste similar to theirs. Can't exactly pin-point it, but I made some additions to this recipe to try and get it right. I used a little more ketchup, only had horseradish sauce that contains beets (the colour of my sauce was off, of course), more of the spices as well as cumin, hot sauce and garlic powder. I don't think the one at McDo has oregano in it though. I'm going to see if I can see the ingredients list ;) Making burgers tonight, this should be great!

I have made versions of this recipe before and this one is kind of bland. After playing around a bit, I substituted Thai Chili Garlic Paste for the horseradish, added garlic salt, smoked paprika and onion powder. I used the sauce with beef empanadas and it had a great kick that really complemented them.

Very good! I give only a 4 because I didn't have any horseradish to use. However, I assume it makes it taste just that much better!

I was told by both my husband and father "You can make this again."

I thought this was an excellent dipping sauce. I didn't have horseradish on hand so I used about a tsp. of wasabi paste. I also added smoked paprika to give the sauce a nice smoky finish. As another reviewer suggested I added a little garlic powder as well.

I always get subways southwest sauce, so I was hoping this would taste like it. I don't think it tastes like theirs, but I still liked it. I used this as a sauce for italian subs.

This is very tasty! I didn't have any cream-style horseradish, so I just used regular prepared horseradish. Also, I added a little more ketchup (maybe like a tablespoon total). I made this to go along w/ the fish tacos I'm making tonight and I think they are gonna be a good match together! Thanks for sharing. :)

I added more cayenne because I like it spicy and a little sweet relish and used prepared horseradish instead of the cream horseradish sauce.  I used it on burgers; it was like a more flavorful version of the special sauce at a popular fast food chain.  I am going to try making it with sour cream and maybe a little cream cheese instead of mayo and using it for chip dip, sans relish.

This dip was great!  A huge hit.  I doubled it and added about a tablespoon of cayenne.  The original recipe didn't have nearly enough.

I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!  This has become a staple in my house. Who needs ketchup! Wonderful with Onion rings, fries, even chicken tenders.  I've even dunked fish sticks in this stuff! ?  I keep a small container in my fridge at all times.  Thanks for a simple, quick and great tasting dipping sauce!

yumMMMY! I made this to dip Holly's Garlicky Appetizer Shrimp Scampi in, trying to mimic an appetizer we just had at a catered party - success! Hubby thinks he hates mayo and horseradish, but surprise - couldn't get enough of this! Thanks!

Oh. My. Goodness. EXCELLENT! I almost didn’t add the oregano but did. This was the perfect sauce. Tastes identical to Outback Steakhouse Restaurant  and their bloomin onion sauce. I had to make another batch because the first one was no match for a house with three very unpicky teens that love to eat. Plus, even if you can buy it at the store, don’t. Homemade is always the best. I didn’t change a thing.

Really tasty. We both loved it and are using it on many different foods. I substituted plain yogurt for the buttermilk, but otherwise followed the directions. I will be making this regularly.

I was looking for something to dip carrots in, and it was okay, but too thin for veggies. I tried some corn chips, and it was too thin for those too. I like the taste, and I think this would be great on turkey burgers or onion rings or chicken tenders.

I made it for onion rings.  The horse radish was a little over powering, but over all tasty. Went well on a roast beef and cheese sandwich with sautéed onions on a kaiser roll.

I substituted 1/4 cup of mayo for 1/4 cup sour cream, plus a little more paprika. I will definitely make this dip again, and with chips,  it is a perfect addition to any meal.

Ok, I'll give it a 3, it is NOT a southwest dipping sauce in my opinion.  We had southwest egg rolls and it definitely did not go with it. However, it is a good "bloomin' onion" sauce.  So 4.5 for a bloomin' onion sauce, 1.5 for a southwest sauce.

Would have given 5 stars but after one tablespoon of horseradish, it had enough. Two tablespoons would be overkill to us. 
I mixed up all ingredients and saved adding horseradish to the last step to adjust and I am glad I did. It would have been ruined to me otherwise.

I wasn't sure about adding the oregano so I made the sauce with all the other ingredients, tasted it, and decided not to bother. This was really good with onion rings but, like others have noted, it would be great with a roast beef sammich, egg rolls etc. Thanks!

I replace the salt with garlic salt and add a dash or two of lemon juice - afterwards, this tastes just like the delicious stuff you'll find in a good American-style restaurant.

Also, this is a great base for other recipes. I was originally making this for some Southwest eggrolls but subsequently discovered it was good mixed with shredded chicken, tuna, dipped with carrots or celery and as a simple sandwich condiment.

I hate to lower the rating on this recipe, but it was a waste of ingredients for me.  My husband loves horseradish and did not care for this sauce, he agreed with the other reviewer that just straight horseradish is better.  If you are trying this out perhaps halving the recipe may be better, so if you don't care for it you won't have to throw the whole thing away like I just did.  Sorry, but thanks for the recipe anyway.

My hubby just enjoyed this with chicken strips that I made.  He said it taste like one of those high dollar franchise's dip.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good for my fries. I like the flavor of the oregano. I think it would be really good on a burger or some fish cakes.

This sauce was PERFECT to top off Cream Cheese Jalapeno Hamburgers (recipe by Noelle)!  I made enough to use as a dip for steak fries too.

This is as good as some of the restaurants I have been in.  It is the first one I found that compares.  Will use again, just as it is.

Yummy - this was good.  I added some seasoned salt and garlic powder to the sauce and the end result was perfect for dipping my battered calamari in!

YUM!  My family thinks they got the dip from a famous steak house for their onion rings...
