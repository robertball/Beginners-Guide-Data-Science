This was a BIG hit at my Thanksgiving dinner!  I used diced tomatoes instead of sliced, and it was still wonderful!  It was the first appetizer to disappear & even my 16 month old liked it!!

This is a great recipe. I used just the mozzerela and dried herbs and it still came out really well. Very easy and delicious!

I loved it.  We made it to accompany a ravioli dish and we ended up eating more of the bread than the main meal.  We did change it a little by using just moss cheese and sub black pepper and sweet bread.  It was excellent.  We will make this again!

A nice alternative to the normal bruschetta, the cheese really adds a nice texture.

Boy, was this easy and very tasty.  My guests enjoyed these so much that after dinner I had to make another batch for those who didn't arrive in time for appetizers.  Definately a keeper for us!

I guess that making bruschetta at home isn't for me.  I added a little pesto to cut back on time, and it didn't work out.  Very strong, so I think I'll stick to getting this out and leave it to the pros.

This was a total hit at the Superbowl party! I changed a few things, First: I omitted the oregano since I couldn't find it fresh at the store.  Second: I added two tablespoons of garlic powder.  Third: I brushed the bread with olive oil, put a slice of mozzarella on top and baked them until golden brown, then I added the tomato mixture on top unbaked.  Like regular bruschetta.  It was delicious.

Delish! Love the combo of cheeses.  I probably quadrupled the basil, and used dried oregano as that's all I had.  Used fresh minced garlic, and tons of it. I think the amount of olive oil is off.  I know I used more than a tablespoon.  What can be better than tomato, basil and cheese melted on bread?  Thanks Susan!

Pretty good! I used sliced grape tomatoes for extra flavor, added a sprinkle of kosher salt, and next time I would omit the mozzerella for something stronger, probably extra-sharp Cheddar. Thanks!

Very good, but a bit time consuming to put together.  I would make again, but only when I have ample prep time.  I would recommend chopping extra oregano and basil, so you can sprinkle without worrying about running out.

This was DELICIOUS! The only thing I changed was using a Garlic Clove rather than Garlic Powder. It was so good words can't even describe just drool :P haha.

My family couldn't get enough of the them. It was my first time making them & it was a chore to chop up enough of the tomatoes, but, it was worth it! I made more the next day too. I did make a few adjustments, I used regular french bread, I used the tips posted from a few other Allrecipes cooks. Then, just fine tuned it to my tastes. I added more olive oil & a bit more cheese, I used garlic powder & minced garlic(as posted by another) I also toasted the bread after brushing it with the oil. Added more black pepper too. It is a really good recipe, thanks for sharing it Susan!

We LOVE this recipe! The only substitution I have made is roasted red peppers on some in place of tomatoes, for my hubs who isn't a tomato fan.

I made this bruschetta for a Super Bowl party and was pleasantly surprised by how many compliments I got on the flavor.  The only thing I'd change would be to toast the bread in the oven a bit before adding the cheese and tomato...my bread was still a bit soft after the 7-10 minute cooking time.  I also used a very thin French baguette, so one slice of Roma tomato over the cheese and spices worked perfectly.  Also, my friend suggested including a side plate of vinegar for dipping, and I think I'll try that in the future.

I have made this about 5 times in the last 2 weeks.  This is fantastic!  Im absolutely hooked on this stuff. Everyone in the house loves it including the 2 and 9 year old. One of my favorite dishes to serve for gatherings too, I made 40 pieces and there was 2 left over the next morning....which I heated up and ate anyway :)

Yum!   I made only four just to try it out before making a whole batch.  It's fantastic.  We'll be having this tonight with our dinner.  I customized it a tad, using goat cheese.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing it.

This was very good and easy to make, use fresh ingredients when possible an it will be that much better. The only thing I disagree with is the amount of olive oil, you will need more than a tbs otherwise it is great! Oh and we cooked it on the grill outside. I just put the slices on foil, set it on the top shelf ,on low heat and closed the grill. Turned out great but watch it close.

We only had dried herbs on hand, but this was still great!  The only thing I might try different next time would be to pre-toast the baguette slices before topping and completing the recipe -- just to give them a little extra crunch.  Yummy just as-is tho.

This worked excellent. Tweak as u want with flavors but the olive oil brushing and oven temp for browning was perfect.  Will definitely continue to use this. Easy, easy, easy....and delish!

This bruschetta was really  good. I used it to  round up our soup meal. I used whole grain baguette, sliced grape tomatoes, dried herbs  and shredded mix of Mozzarella and Provolone cheese.
I only made one layer of tomatoes. I felt that layering them twice would result in toppings sliding of the bread in the oven.

Simple and easy as a starter. I just added more oil to the bread before putting it in the oven to prevent it drying out too much.
