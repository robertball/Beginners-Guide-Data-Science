Waiting 8 hours is sooooo hard.  Your home will be filled with a wonderful aroma (use your exhaust fan). I added about 1 tablespoon of cracked black pepper and red pepper flakes.  Delicious!

This turned out much better than I thought it would. However, we used ground meat and let it marinate for almost 24 hrs(or basically "soak" up the marinade). Using a jerky press that we borrowed, we made half into flat strips and the other half like ropes and deydrated them (it was already ground up-I doubt we'd get them to work very well in the oven as directed). The ropes turned out much better than the flat strips but they were tasty = slightly salty and hot yet sweet (from the brown sugar I assume). Thanks Pete! This worked well for us (even if we didn't follow the instructions exactly).

I followed the recipe to the t.  The marinated beef smelled so good!  I used an "electric" oven.  I keep my eye on the jerky hourly, unfortunately it turned out very dry even when cutting back on baking time. I throw out the whole batch.  It appears that those that liked this recipe had "dehydrarors.  I think I will try the dehydrator method and may find I write a different review.

This recipe was really easy to do. Although, I didn't marinade my meat over night ( about 20mins) it still turned out really good. I don't know how it is with the oven, I used a dehydrator. I put it in there for about 7 hours and everything turned out really good. I would next time trying adding something different to the ingredient since the meat tasted like the store bought stuff. Maybe trying a different cut of meat.

It is pretty straight forward recipe and the results are great.  I would of never thought you could make something like this without a dehydrator.

One of the benefits of this recipie is that all the salt in Soy sauce preserves it.  You don't need to add any additional salt to this.

Kids probably shouldn't try to slice
the meat, but with a little help from
mom or dad, this is a fun recipe to 
try with kids.  It's quick to get the 
meat slices in the oven, but it's hard
waiting for them to cook!  Delicious!

This review is more for the cooking/dehydrating method than the actual recipe.  For the recipe, I started with the soy sauce base and then basically raided my fridge for anything I thought would taste interesting (liquid smoke, apricot jelly, Worcestershire sauce, etc. etc.)  The cooking method -- 160 degrees for 6-8  hours) was the best drying method I have ever used.  It was so good, in fact, that I had stray animals coming to my door.  Literally!  We had a stray cat come, meowing at our doorstep, until we let him in.  We ended up having to find him an adopted home due to my wife's allergies.  But we thought it was funny that this beef jerky smelled so incredible that animals were flocking to our home.  Kudos to the drying method!  We loved the jerky!

After making home made jerky you will never buy it again. This was the closest recipe I found that was like mine. I use London Broil, Liquid Smoke, and I slice the meat 1/8th of an inch and soak in the marinade for about an hour. I also use a dehydrator. Place the slices of meat (sides not touching) on the trays. Cover with lid on partial vent and cook for about 12 hours. Beyond GOOD!!!!!

Love it! My family loves this recipe. They begged me to make more. I followed it exactly the first time around. I used Tabasco chipotle ]on the first round. Now I'm going to experiment with different hot sauces. I have used beef brisket as well as round. Either is tasty. I have tried other recipes on this site and this one was easy and my families favorite.

Excellent recipe! I was amazed that I could make beef jerky in the oven. It turned out great; very similar to a local meat store that specializes in jerky. My family and I like our jerky quite dry, so this recipe really suited us. I added a generous amount of crushed garlic to the marinade, otherwise I followed the recipe. This is going to be a real money saver when you consider the price of prepared jerky, especially at the rate it disapears around here!

My version is pretty much the same with the exception of time to marinate. I let bottom round thinly sliced sit in my "secret" sauce for 30 min.(tat's it!) Any more time is just wasted. The meat will absorb any moisture within that time...storing is another issue...if there's any fat left...and I mean ANY...it will go rancid in no time. Usually don't let it go more than a week with consuming...if it's good it won't be a problem.

This made a very tasty jerky.  I did not alter the marinade recipe and was surprised, given the amount of hot sauce, that the jerky is not spicy-hot; it is mild but flavorful.  I did not use the toothpick method; instead I placed the strips of meat on Airbake pizza pans, one on each oven rack, alternating racks and turning strips occasionally.  The jerky was done in 5-7 hours, depending on thickness.

My husband made this. He added some red pepper flakes which gave the jerky an additional kick. The jerky held its flavor weeks after making it. Great recipe!

I love this recipe, it was so simple but also so  delicious. I added crushed red pepper and granulated garlic, and for the hot sauce I used sriracha.

This is by far the best Beef Jerky recipe I have tried.  I use low sodium soy sauce and usually cut back some of the brown sugar.   My wife who "doesn't even like beef jerky", loves this!  Not to mention all my kids, including the 3 yr old.  Recently on a Keto diet, this is one of my go-to snacks.  I use my air frier @ 160F for 6 hrs, comes out perfect and I don't have to hassle with the hanging by toothpicks routine.  At this rate we are making it every 3 weeks.

A 1 lb batch is gone in minutes! Fast, easy, and delicious! Top tip: play around with the brand and type of soy and hot sauces. Can make a BIG difference. I also found Top or Bottom round roast is just as good and perhaps cheaper than Eye of round.

This is a great recipe.  I can't use most soy sauces, because my sister is allergic.  I use a homemade salt solution instead.  I also added a few of my favorite spices.  Everyone loved it and kept asking for more.
