Excellent.  I added 2 shakes of worcestershire sauce and about 2 tablespoons of sour cream to the sauce.  I also chilled the mixed meat mixture for 10 minutes in the freezer, then formed into balls, put back in freezer for another 5 minutes before I sauteed them.  It worked perfectly. This recipe is very good.  Husband couldn't stop saying how good it was!  Definitely a keeper.  
NOTE: I'm not sure how this feeds 14 people.  Maybe 2 meatballs a person???  This only made enough for 4 or 5 people.

I thought these were very good, but of course I made a few changes.  I used finely chopped onion & garlic and added about 3/4 c of bread crumbs to the meat mixture.  I read the reviews prior to making them and was worried that 1/4 c bread crumbs with 2/3 c evaporated milk would make them way too soft.  I also used 2% evaporated milk rather than the full fat version and added one egg.  After browning the meat balls (in olive oil) I removed them and added the water and bullion, scraping off the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  After simmering them, I removed them again and added the water mixed with flour and remaining milk.  I doubled the water and bullion, but not the water with the flour dissolved in it, it was still thick.  I added some dried parsley and returned the meat balls to the pan while my yolk free egg noodles cooked.  I used a large stock pot to brown the meat balls in batches as I don't have a skillet with high sides that is large enough for this recipe, it worked quite well.  To those who found this recipe bland, Swedish meatballs aren't usually screaming with flavor, but rather a nice mild, creamy flavor.  I found this recipe had very balanced flavors and I will make it again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These meatballs were a hit.  I did make some minor changes.  I mixed the meatballs as directed, but baked them at 350* for 15 minutes.  Using homemade beef broth, I mixed 1 1/2 cups of broth with a full 15 oz. can of evaporated milk, and used a bit more flour.  This went into a crock pot along with the meatballs.  After heating for a time, (the sauce becomes a little brown)it was ready.  I liked it so much without the lemon juice when I tasted it, I simply left that ingredient out.  The meatballs were served as an appetizer.  This recipe was rated very good by everyone who tried it.  A definite keeper!

At last a recipe that doesn't call for cream of soup!!  My whole family loved this.  I sauted the meatballs in olive oil instead of butter.  I cooked fetticini and placed it in the bottom of a casserole dish.  Topped the cooked noodles with the cooked meatballs.  Poured the cooking broth into my  4 cup "fat separator" and return the fat-free broth to the saute pan.  The flavor for the sauce is on the bottom of the pan!! Added fat-free evaporated milk (doubled the broth, milk, flour, and water).  Cooked until slightly thick.  I strained the sauce to remove darkened bits of meat and onions, and pured over meatballs and noodles.  Then my husband called to say that he had to substitute for someone at a business dinner, so I put the whole thing in the fridge for the next night.  The noodles were infused with the extra sauce and all flavors were well blended.  Wonderful!!  I will always make this one day ahead.  It heated wonderfully in the microwave on a defrost setting as I did not want the edges to cook before the center was warm.  A very healthy creamy sauce! Thanks for a new "keeper" at our house!
Note:  I ignored the second mention of 1 cup of evaporated milk.  Like another reviewer, I think it is a misprint as the directions did not give mention to it.

This was excellent!  Flavorful and no cream soups!  I did bake my meatballs instead of frying them.  Much easier!  My husband and son loved it and I was so suprised it was so tasty and rich!  Yummy!  Will make again!  Its a keeper!

I'm not a big fan of the swedish meatball but I brought these to Christmas dinner and they were devoured!  I had to quadruple the recipe and by the 3rd batch, I would have to agree that it's extremely beneficial to chill the mixture before forming the balls and to freeze the formed balls for at least 5 minutes before browning.  Also, I don't think I needed as much broth as it called for.  Mine hardly thickened up but it may have been due to quadrupling the recipe.

Tried this recipe tonight for dinner and it was delicious.  I made just a few changes to the sauce by adding a few dashes of Worcesterchire sauce and 3 tablespoons of light sour cream.  It seemed to add more flavor and made it more creamy.  Thanks for the recipe, it will definitely be added to my recipes to make again.

I tripled the recipe for a work potluck luncheon.  These turned out well and proved to be very popular.  I added finely minced garlic to the meat mixture, and used 50 percent more allspice as well as adding both freshly ground nutmeg and Worcestershire sauce.  Also, it should be mentioned that I used venison ground.  Chilling the meatballs in the freezer worked to perfection.   This was all prepared the night before the function.  The meatballs and sauce were not combined until the next morning when both were added to a crock-pot to be transported and heated at work.

This was a good recipe.  I would suggest pan frying the meatballs and using a non stick pan.  I would also suggest sticking the meat in the freezer for about 10 minutes before forming into balls.  The refrigerator just didn't do the trick.  Otherwise they are a little wet and tend to stick to the pan (even a non stick pan)

IMPORTANT NOTE:  There is a significant error in the ingredients. The recipe calls for 1-2/3 cup milk at the beginning of the list, and then another 1 cup at the end of the list, equaling 2-2/3 cups.  

The directions, though, call for 1-2/3 cups total, or am I misreading it?  I had the ingredients out, recipe printed, and ready to cook this when I noticed the discrepancy.

I'm 1/2 Svenska and grew up enjoying my Mamma's meatballs.  We are having my husbands Danish family over for Smörgåsbord and wanted to prepare something authentic for them to enjoy.  These truly fit the bill.  I used some ground pork in the mix and added an egg.  After freezing them for 10 min they were baked at 375 for 20 min.  I deglazed the baking pan to make the gravy.  Threw in a dollop sour cream and used my Tony Chachere brown gravy mix as the base.  These will sit in the fridge tonight and will be warmed up in a crock pot tomorrow while I do other things and the flavors will have time to get happy together.  Highly recommend!

A good old-fashioned, budget-friendly, filling meal. I used a pound & a half of lean ground meat. (I would use less milk with the meat if only using a pound). Drained off quite a bit of grease before the flour, deglazing steps. The gravy seemed a bit bland so I threw in garlic powder & pepper. Mine was a bit runny but very flavorful - boys loved it! Update - didn't even remember making this! Made it again, used 1 lb very lean ground meat, only 1/3 c Panko bc, 1/3 c evap milk. Used olive oil to fry meatballs (get your pan pretty hot to prevent mb from falling apart & turn gently with your fingers). Used minced onion instead of real. 1 bouillion cube (hubby has to watch his salt) lots of garlic. Takes a while to get it thick, but everyone really liked it.

BE CAREFUL - the first item in the recipe should be only 2/3 cup of evap. milk (not 1 2/3 cups) Later in the recipe you will make sauce with 1 cup of evaporated milk. Unfortunately I did not see this until I put all the evap. milk in my meat mixture. We shall see how they turn out.  DEFINITELY NEEDS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE WRITING OF THIS RECIPE!  3 stars for the recipe content...

Fantastic! My father has a recipe his great great grandmother had brought with her from Sweden, and it was very similar to this. I made this for my boyfriend the other night, and he kept going back until he was stuffed! We love this recipe!

These were great. When I next make these I might change the amount of milk and breadcrumbs in the meatballs, since I prefer a firmer meatball (they were quite soft). I added a scant tablespoon of Worstershire sauce. A definite keeper!

Tell you the truth, it lacked something. My husband and kids managed to eat it, somewhat. Maybe that's due to the fact that we love to eat a lot of mexican food. And most of you know, mexican cuisine is know for it's spices. Something this recipe lacks of. Thanks anyway!

Thank you for this wonderful recipe! I made 2 alterations- used 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. ground pork, and used 1/4 t. nutmeg + 1/4 t. of the allspice. As in other reviews, found the meat mixture to be very soft, but used a cookie scoop (similar to icecream scoop, but much smaller!)and plopped the meatballs right in the pan- worked great. The flavor and texture are much like my Norwegian grandmother's meatball recipe (I don't make hers because the recipe calls for veal). The flavors are fantastic- thank you again, flicka! ;)

I thought these were okay. The only change I made was using lean beef and ff evaporated milk. I thought the spice was a little strong. I ate a few when it was warm but not the leftovers. No one else complained. I might just like a less spicy meatball and a red or brown gravy. But, it tasted pretty close to what I know as a Swedish meatball, anyway.

What a great recipe!  I have made these meatballs many times and my family loves them.  I take a major short cut and use trader joes turkey meatballs - regular size and party size.  I always have a bag in the fridge and a can of condensed milk in the pantry for a quick meal.  I have topped mashed potatoes, egg noodles and pasta.  The only change I made is that I use 2 tablespoons to cook the meatballs before adding the beef broth.  Everything else I follow as directed.

This is by far the best Swedish Meatball dish I've ever cooked. I think the allspice and fresh sause makes the difference. My fiance loved it!

I doubled the batch but made it exactly according to the recipie in order to give it a fair trial. They turned out to be a bit of work, but very worthwhile. The kids loved them! The hardest part was to keep them from snacking on the meatballs after they had been cooked so that I had enough to put in the sauce.  This recipie is going to become a regular part of my recipie rotation. I took 1 star off due to the prep time -- the number of steps and time required seemed somewhat excessive; however, perhaps practice will make perfect.  This recipie is definitely worthwhile and we loved it just as written!

This recipe is awesome. I am swedish and lost most of my family young without their recipe, as it was buried with them. It is the closest I have ever come to duplicating theirs. Thanks.

I made this last week while in Ireland. My daughter in law is from Denmark/Faroe Islands, and to her, this meal is comfort food - something she always had growing up. She thought the flavor was spot on, but I found that it was difficult browning the meatballs because they were so soft they wanted to fall apart easily while trying to brown on all sides. I only bought the recipe with me - not the reviews, so forgot about the comments about the softness of the meatballs.  Definitely double up on breadcrumbs, or add less liquid.  Flavor was great and I will make it again.

WOW! This is a great recipe! It did resemble the meatballs I had at Ikea! haha. I dont think I'll put as much onion in it next time, maybe half of that. It almost overpowered the spice in it. But really, it was still totally delicious!

My swedish husband loves these!  Very tastey.  We have tried the recipe/sauce with fat free evaporated milk.  It was just as tastey.  Just be prepared to stir the milk/water/flour mixture much longer before it thickens.

I tried this recipe tonight and was a little disappointed.  The hamburger didn't hold together well even when I added an egg.  I would use 1 chicken bullion and 1 beef boulion.  It tasted awfully salty.

TOO MUCH MILK! I made these accordingly and it turned out way too soft and mushy in the center. I know that they're supposed to be soft (I love Swedish Meatballs) but it was too mushy. I was already hesitant when I saw that 2/3 cups of evap milk was needed for only 1 lb of ground meat so I only added 1/2 cup and it was still too much milk. I checked out other Swedish Meatballs recipes online and many others recommend 1/4 cups of milk for 1 lb of meat. If you like extremely soft and mushy in the center meatballs, then you're in luck! If not, use less milk.

I'm also 1/2 Swedish and since didn't have one from my late mom when seeing this one from Iowa - Swedish girl knew it would be good.  Quite the hit with the family just making minor changes/addition in using some Ground Veal with the Grou nd Beef.

These are fabulous!!!!!!! So moist and so yummy! Only thing i did different was that i used italian bread crumbs. It was a little time consuming but sooo worth it. I will make these again. Also the gravy holds up nicely on the 2nd day.

Very good and not hard at all! I followed the recipe almost completely; I had to add a few more shakes of breadcrumbs to get my meat to form balls and I added a bit of salt and worcestershire to the sauce.  Boyfriend loved them though he thought his Swedish granny made better ones (which apparently taste like Ikea's).  I don't have a Swedish granny so I thought they were great!

I made this recipe twice now, it's excellent.  My boyfriend doesn't like onions so I used onion powder, so I could still get the flavor with no onions showing,he couldn't tell. He just loves these.

This recipe is awesome!  It is fast enough for a home-cooked meal (took me about 45 minutes), and tastes excellent!  My husband asked for seconds :)  I love the addition of lemon and poppy seeds to the noodles - makes it more authentic!

I can't say enough good things about this recipe.  It's my one of my favorite things to make and is my go-to recipe when I have company coming over.  Every single person I've made it for has asked for the recipe.  The first few times I made it, I followed it to the letter, and it was fantastic.  Definitely worth a 5-star rating.  

However, over the years I've made a few changes.  Take them for what they're worth...
I use 2 tbls of butter instead of 2 tsps
I use a little over a tsp of beef bouillon powder
I leave out the lemon juice altogether
I don't remove the meatballs from the pan, or skim the fat.  I buy very lean meat, and leave everything in the pan.

I made these for lunch and they were a big hit.  I actually was in a hurry so I cheated and used some frozen meatballs and started the recipe at the point where you put them in the pan with the a cup of beef broth...I didn't have beef bullion cubes on hand.  They tasted great...I am sure they would have even been better if I had made them from scratch though.  No one complained.  I will definitely keep this recipe and make it again.

This was great.  Our whole family loved it.  I made it with ground TURKEY, and it worked out fine.  I added one extra bullion cube, in order to have a more "beefy" taste. I also added some extra bread crumbs to bind the meatballs.  We love sauce, so I recommend doubling the sauce.  The noodles soak up a lot of sauce.  It's nice to have more than enough sauce!

Oh my gosh!!!! This was excellent!! Made this for dinner last Monday. My bf thought it was "OK", but he rarely likes cream sauces (oh well, more for me!). He ate two helpings though :) I followed other reviewer's suggestions to finely mince my onion, use a bit more breadcrumbs (maybe another 1/6 c. worth) and place my meatball mixture in the freezer for 10 minutes, remove and shape into 1 inch balls (using my Pampered Chef small scoop) and then freeze the formed meatballs on a cookie sheet for another 5 minutes. Perfect! I was able to fit all of my meatballs (there were a lot!) in a large, deep non-stick skillet. I used about 6 teaspoons of butter as I thought 2 teaspoons would not be enough.... I also did not skim the fat from my pan drippings, and found the sauce to be fine even without doing so (my sauce was not too greasy at all). To use up what was left of my container of sour cream that was soon to expire, I added about 1.25 tablespoons worth to the sauce (along with a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce) at the very end of the cooking time. Oh, and I did bring my flour/water mixture and evaporated milk to a slight boil before reducing the heat to low to thicken (I think this helped thicken the sauce more quickly). Served over buttered egg noodles sprinkled with poppyseeds and a side of lingonberries. Absolutely delish! Thanks so much for sharing. This will make a permanent place in my "keeper" file :)

I really messed this recipe up by adding the whole 1 2/3 C. of milk to the meat mixture, so my meatballs turned into mush while in the skillet. I decided to finish the dish anyway and came up with a meat sauce that we ate over noodles. It was great, the kids loved it! I grew up in Iowa, and had swedish meatballs a lot while there. I had never tried to make them before. Next time I will make the real meatballs, but the sauce I ended up with this time tasted just like the swedish meatballs I remember!

Nice meatballs, but I did add a dash of Worchestershire and a pinch of dried rosemary. I also rolled them in flour which helped the meatballs hold their shape (no freezing necessary) plus thicken the gravy. This wa, I did not have to add the slurry of flour and water, which would have diluted the flavor. I added some sour cream at the end. It was tasty.

This was quite good.  For the meat I used 1/2 lb. ground pork and 1/2 lb. ground venison, since that is what I had thawed.  I also did follow some suggestions of other reviewers.  I added about 1 1/2 tsp. of minced garlic to the meat mixture, increased the bread crumbs to 1/3 c., added an egg, and reduced the evaporated milk to 1/3 c.  This made a very nice meatball that held up wonderfully when cooked.  For the gravy, I added a heaping tbsp. of sour cream after it had thickend, otherwise no changes.  Served it over mashed potatoes.  It was a very nice comfort food meal, that we will make again.

Delicious! Easy to make, relatively quick, and no processed ingredients is a major plus. I added four cloves garlic to the meatballs, and doubled the gravy, and I'm glad I did. Served over garlic mashed potatoes with broccoli, mmmmm! Leftovers even tastier!

I made this for dinner tonight and was so happy with it!!!!! Yummy. I followed this recipe word for word exept for the evaperated milk. I did not have any on hand so I used 2% milk, which did not effect the recipe at all then used about 1/2 teaspoon extra flour because milk is way thinner than flour. I will for sure use this recipe agean...soon, but mabe not use so much butter as I am feeling a tad guilty.

It's pretty good.  I used egg and a little milk to bind together the meat, rather than evaporated milk. I also didn't have allspice, so used cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves like someone else suggested.

Loved this recipe! Only thing I can say is that the meatballs broke apart fairly easily... maybe a bit more breadcrumb would have helped this situation? Other than that it was wonderful!

Very good - byt changed a few things based on other reviewers, Added 3 cloves of minced garlic to meet mix as well as some worcestershire sauce. I found that meatballs sort of crumbled when cooking - next time i would use less milk and perhaps dredge them in flour before browning. Overall was tasty though!

I too made this recipe a day ahead, and it turned out great.  The meat balls stayed firmly together and very flavorful.  There was no last minute preparation mess.  This is a keeper. It received rave reviews from our guests,

Great meatballs!  I followed the directions up to the part where you simmer the meatballs in beef broth. I took them out, and served them with mashed potatoes, topping the dish with lingonberry sauce (purchased from an international food store).  The flavor of these meatballs went perfectly with the traditional Swedish berry sauce.

Turned out very good. I always read the reviews before I start a recipe. I like meatballs that are firm so I double the bread crumbs, also I used corn starch instead of flour for the sauce (1 tablespoon CS to 2 Tlbs floor).

The sauce is AMAZING - just like my grandmother's.  However, I did not care for the meatballs.  The texture was strange - they were too soft, and I felt there was a little too much onion in them.  I did add some nutmeg, but it still seemed that something was missing (in the meatballs, that is).  I will definitely make the sauce again, but probably with a different meatball recipe.

I didn't mind this recipe neither did my daughter, it was just okay, my husband on the other hand didn't care for it at all. He didn't even finish what he had on his plate. He said something tasted weird with the meatballs. It was probably the allspice. I usually make the swedish meatballs with the seasoning packet from the grocery store and I think I will go back to that. Sorry. I am glad that I tried to make them from scratch though.

I thought this was very good as written, the four stars are for the recipe before additions.  I had some missgivings about the meat holding it's shape so I added another 1/4 cup of bread crumbs.  I also added a little more beef flavour with some extra OXO.  Great with noodles on a cold day :o)

This recipe is the bomb!  I made my meatballs with half beef and half venison, and no one knew any differently.  Even the two girls who always said they know if there's venison in something because they can "totally taste it" had 3 helpings during our Christmas party!  Just to let you know, the first ingredient is actually 2/3 cup.  I used nutmeg instead of allspice.  These were soooo good that I'm making them again for my New Year's party! (but I'm doubling the recipe this time!)

My family loved these meatballs.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I am only giving 4 stars because of the bouillon cubes.  they gave the sauce sort of a weird artifical taste.  I think with a good beef broth this will be a 5 star dinner.

This was very good. Even hubby went back for seconds. That never happens. Only change I made was to let the meat mixture sit in the fridge all day. I didn't feel like there was quite enough gravy so I added 1 packet of country gravy with 2 cups water.

I only gave it three stars becuase it was just fine.  Not fantastic.  The ingredient list should have the 1 2/3 c. evaoprated milk listed as divided, since I wasn't thinking and use the whole amount in the first step of mixing the meatballs, which made them waaaayyyy too wet (I'm not placing blame here, I should have paid better attention) and since it lists an additional 1 cup it was confusing.  But it tasted fine even though the presentation was weird because of the meatballs.

Awesome! It's not very often a family of five each goes for seconds or thirds, but they did tonight. I didn't have evaporated milk on hand, as I usually do, so I used half & half (about 3/4 c), and I used a can of beef broth instead of the bouillon. They want it again tomorrow - thanks so much for this recipe!

These were really good. My husband is not a fan of butter, so I made pasta and just poured some gravy over it. On day 3, we only had three meatballs left over, so I quartered them, sauteed onions, celery, and carrots in a soup pot, added the meat and gravy, poured in some more broth, and made a soup out it. The soup was good, too.

I doubled the amount of the meatballs, and added a few splashes of Worcheshire sauce, but otherwise left this alone. It was super yummy, though rather messy to make.

mmm...mmm...good! We loved this.  Did add a little worcestershire sauce during cooking and sour cream at the end. The lemon gave it a great flavor!
Served it over rice and with roasted Brussels sprouts.

the first disappointment of mine on allrecipes.com after many years of yummy recipes! the meatballs fell apart way too easily, and I used extra breadcrumbs and higher fat meat as other users suggested. My husband was scared by the amount of onions! The taste was alright, but we are used to my off-the-boat Swedish Aunt's meatballs. We prefer a brown sauce. Wouldn't do again :-(

This was excellent! Thanks to the svenska flicka in Iowa, we now have a great recipe for svenska meatballs. Who knew that a little allspice, and Evaporated Milk(!)would make something so delicious. (Secret ingredients, love it!) Also, very easy dish to make in large quantities.

This recipe was fairly easy to make and with a couple of personalizations was very tasty!  I used half ground veal for the meatballs and added a bit of sour cream to the sauce.  I think a very good recipe.

Yummy,yummy yummy!!!!!  I loved the lemon juice, and so did my swedish friends that showed up last minute.  I'll have to double next time though, there were no leftovers, darn!!  I added a just a tad more bread crumbs to hold them together.  But, other than that these are perfect the way they are!

This recipe was very good and actually pretty easy to make. I doubled the recipe and put it all in a crockpot to bring to a potluck. If you are making small meatballs be sure to mince the onions finely, as chopped onion pieces can seem pretty large in a small meatball. I substitured regular milk and canned beef broth for the evaporated milk and beef boullion plus water called for and it came out just fine. I used less milk than called for in the meatballs, as adding the full amount called for seemed like it would be too much, I would have had meat mush and been unable to roll them out. I think this depends on the beef you are using, mine seemed fairly moist to begin with. Also there seemed to be too much lemon juice for my taste, I had to add extra pepper and salt to the sauce to compensate, though once sitting in the crock pot for a while all the flavors mellowed nicely. Next time I will use only 1/2 the lemon juice. I will definitely make these again though!

This recipe mistakingly lists 1 and 1/3 cups evap. milk, and then again, 1 cup evap. milk. It's 1 and 1/3 total.
Hope this helps someone out. As I had too much milk ready.

My family loved these! I added an egg to the mixture based on reviews that some people had problems with the meatballs falling apart. (super lean meat usually needs a little help sticking together, fattier meat will not need the egg)

Lots of flavor - loved the poppy seeds on the noodles! 

Even my 3 year old twins liked them, and they usually don't like anything with a sauce or anything new!

This recipe makes Ikea's Swedish Meatballs taste like dog food!  This recipe is absolutely amazing.  The only thing I added was some garlic, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.  Absolutely delicious and will definitely make again!

Okay, this recipe is amazing! What I love is that these simple ingredients are usually in your pantry and freezer.
I took some liberties with this recipe and it still turned out 5 stars. I only had 1 – 12 oz can of evaporated milk. I used 4 oz in the meatballs and used the remaining 8 oz in the sauce. I didn’t have breadcrumbs, so I threw a hotdog bun in the food processor and got about 2/3 C crumbs and used all of them. I also added 1 egg to the meat mixture. 
Using my KA stand mixer for combining the meatball ingredients makes for short work. 
I refrigerated the prepared meatballs prior to cooking because it helps to firm them up, but just frying them with a cover on your skillet which allows them to steam firms them up also. 
For the sauce, I used 4 tsp of granulated beef bouillon with 2 C water and the 1 C evaporated milk. I seasoned the sauce and thickened with 3/4 C water & 3 Tb flour. Finally, I added a pinch of ground allspice and a pinch of nutmeg to finish the sauce. Wow! Thanks so much Emily! This one is a keeper!

How much evaporated milk is supposed to go into the meatballs??? It says 1 2/3 cups for the meatballs and then 1 cup for the sauce in the ingredients but in the instructions calls for only 2/3 c for the meat mixture.  I went with the 2/3 c and still it seemed like too much.  Many of the meatballs fell apart while I was browning them.  
One substitution that I made:  I used 1/8 teaspoon each of nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and pepper in place of 1/2 teaspoon of allspice since I didn't have it on hand.
Overall the taste was okay.  We served them over buttered egg noodles.  I was very disappointed about the appearance since I had meat "clumps" rather than meatballs!

These were so good!  Just the recipe I have been looking for!  I did decrease the amount of ev. milk in the meat but just added it to the sauce.  It didn't seem to get thick enough so I added more flour as well.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought these were good, and they weren't nearly as hard as I expected them to be!  I used turkey, and baked the meatballs for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  I also used olive oil (and, okay, a few pats of butter) as the fat in the sauce, and fat free evaporated milk.  Definitely add the lemon juice; up until that point I was really sad that I was out of worcestershire, but the lemon juice added just the kick I was looking for.  The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that my husband said he thought the meatballs themselves - not the gravy - could have been more flavorful.  I disagree, but the guy still gets a vote!

Yum! Had a taste for Swedish meatballs and this recipe sounded great (plus I had everything except the evaporated milk, I used regular milk). Very easy to make, even my picky honey liked them (and I haven't made a homemade gravy he likes yet, until this one!) I also baked the meatballs and added some sour cream at the end. This one is going into my recipe box!

Normally I write reviews on the recipes only I cook, but this was one recipe my husband actually cooked. Since I know he will never come on here to write a review on it, I will. This was amazing. My husband followed the recipe exactly except for not using the juices from the meatballs in sauce. This was so full of rich wonderful flavor. Will for sure make it again. Wonderful

This has got to be one of the best tasting meatball dishes that I have ever had! I didn't have lemon though, so I used keylime juice instead, but still very yummy! My entire family loved this dish and we will mnake it often now.
thanks so much for this recipe!

Very good, family enjoyed, I did bake my meatballs instead of browning in butter. I increased the sauce, added some allspice,nutmeg, and cracked pepper to it. Made over buttered noodles. Will make again.

Our entire family loved this. I followed it exactly as written for all the measurements (I used ground turkey instead of beef) and then strained the sauce to get out the bits and pieces. After returning the sauce to the pan I felt it needed a little bit more flavor so I added two dashes of allspice and 2 dashes of nutmeg. I used whole wheat egg noodles and added a bit of butter to the lemon juice used to coat the noodles. Absolutely PERFECT! I will most definitely be making this again.

We love this recipe, it's become a standard in our house.  Do chill the meatballs.   I was hesitant the first time I made them with the allspice but I now add even more than the recipe calls for.   I rarely have poppy seeds so I add some dried parsley to the noodles for a little color.  Absolutely wonderful.

I made these over the weekend.  They were fantastic.  I made a triple batch, baking the meatballs inthe oven, using the drippings to make the sauce on the stovetop, and kept them warm in the crockpot for a couple of hours while I waited for the company to come.  They kept wonderfully for that amount of time, but I wouldn't cook them for much longer than that as the meatballs are so tender they might fall apart if cooked too long.  Thanks for the wonderful meal idea.

It was excellent.  I used half pork and beef and used 1/4 tsp each nutmeg and allspice.  It was wonderful.  I will make this again.

Very good and satisfying to the taste buds. I woke up craving this and this recipe fit the bill. I always like to add a little sour cream to mine--and it was just great. We ate them over wide egg, buttered noodles. Dee-lish!!

Very tasty recipe! I made this for my Women's Circle "Christmas Around the World Luncheon" served over buttered noodles.  I will definitely make again to serve at home.  Next time I would cut back on butter and maybe try to use lowfat or nonfat condensed milk to try and make it more figure friendly.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was really good. We all loved this dish. I used 1/4 c dried minced onion instead of a fresh one. Wonderful flavor in this, and the sauce was so creamy. This is a regular on our dinner table. Thank you for sharing this keeper.

This is a great recipe, very tasty.  My husband did the actual cooking and he said it was so quick and easy to make. This will become a family favorite.  We all had second servings, including the kids who can be fussy eaters sometimes.  I wouldn't necessarily double the sauce as others suggested, but increase it by about 50%.

Exceptional!  Tastes a lot like what I grew up having...maybe better!  The sauce was divine and the recipe, easy.  I made these for Christmas eve dinner because I'm far from family and wanted something to "bring me home" for the holiday.  This recipe fit the bill  :-)   Thanks for the real deal!

Liked the recipe, followed exactly except....don't ask me what I was thinking I didn't have allspice, I used Chinese 5 spice. Believe it or not the flavor subtle. I would make again and use allspice though ;)!

These were alright, all I can say is I did not care for the allspice in them,  They also were a little too mushy for my liking, but the flavor was good.

Made a special trip to the store for Evap Milk just so I could give this a try... Made as written, less the  addition of garlic and parsley.  These were just "alright" - the breadcrumbs could be bumped up to AT LEAST 1/2 cup.  The sauce needed something more... Glad I tried 'em, but won't make again.

These were very good, but I did alter the recipe a bit.  The main thing I changed was to use ground chicken instead of beef. In this case, cooling the meat in the freezer before making the meatballs was a must! I also added a few more bread crumbs (I just crushed croutons) and added a splash of worcestershire and a couple tablespoons of sour cream.  Also used chicken bouillon instead of beef bouillon. Sauce turned out very creamy and rich. My husband and I ate it over rice and egg noodles. I will be making it again.

MMMM... delicious. I didn't have evaporated milk so just used some skim milk. I also used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain. This is a wonderful and hearty recipe.

I made this for my boys ages 6, 3, 20 months. They loved it. It was described as better than Kung Fu Panda right behind Disney World. I only had to replace the evaporated milk with cream because I didn't have any. WOW!

I really loved this recipe! I didn't have breadcrumbs so I used pepperidge farm stuffing mix, crushed a bit finer. Subbed the condensed milk with heavy cream. I took the advice of others and added a dash of nutmeg to the sauce, a splash of worcestershire and a few spoonfuls of sour cream. I will no doubt be making this again and again! It's a great base to tweek to your liking.

Made this last night and served over egg noodles.  It was excellent!  Hardest part was turning the meatballs while browning.  As the one side cooked, it flattened a bit and thus wanted to return to that side when attempting turn.  Used tongs to turn but had to be real gentle to keep from breaking meatballs.  One other note is definitely SIMMER.  If you allow your liquid to boil, the bubbles will tend to break apart the meatballs.

All in all, an excellent recipe.  My wife told me that I was going to memorize this recipe as she would request it often.

I did not have time to read the reviews before I made this recipe so I prepared it exactly as stated (except I had to sub heavy cream for half of the evap milk because I ran out, worked fine). As written, it's good but it needs work. First, these meatballs were too soft. I think they need about 1/4 cup more breadcrumbs. Second, I recommend draining the fat from the meatballs as soon as they are brown, then add the liquid. It's too hard to skim the fat off otherwise. Finally, this sauce needed salt. It was too bland otherwise. I will make again, but definitely will tweak.  You also only need 1 and 2/3 cups evaporated milk, not 2 and 2/3 cup, that's a typo.
**added later**Be sure to drain the fat first, it's too hard to do it after adding the broth and my hubby and I both got very sick from all of the fat left behind.

I had a bunch of leftover frozen meatballs in my freezer and decided to adapt this recipe to use with them. Am I ever glad I did. My whole family loved this and I will never, ever buy Swedish Meatball Mix or Frozen Swedish Meatballs again. This recipe blows them away.

An excellent, tasty recipe. I had no problem with the balls falling apart because I didn't brown them in the butter. I just poured the hot water with the bouillon over them and let them simmer. The consistency was perfect. I only used 2/3 cup of evaporated milk instead of 1 2/3 cup, that could be a typo. A definite keeper.

Thanks, Emily! I loved this recipe. I had it for supper last night and am now having it for breakfast. The only change I made was I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to meatballs when they were simmering. Perfect!

This was delicious...my first time making Swedish meatballs! I made it per the original recipe (with a splash of Worcestershire as others advised). It took more time than I'd planned for the sauce to thicken, but it did and tasted great. I served it with Brussels sprouts and noodles and my whole family ate it up. Thanks.

YUM! Now I don't need to go to IKEA when I'm craving swedish meatballs and gravy. Added a dash of Worcestershire and sour cream like other reviewers recommended, but not sure that I needed to. Used a little bit less milk in the gravy as I like my gravy a bit browner/meatier.

I made this recipe just as witten, except for making more sauce. My twin sons loved this dish. It was just like a dish my mom made when I was little. For those who wanted stronger flavor, sorry- It is supposed to be a light flavored cream sauce. We really liked!

I liked this recipe fairly well. I don't know if I really liked boiling the meatballs as I prefer a little bit of crunchy on my meatballs normally. I did really like the sauce. Also, I modified the recipe a little bit in that I used Gluten-Free bread to make the bread crumbs and used GF all-purpose flour in the sauce. Otherwise, this was really good and I like the hint of allspice in the recipe.

Marvelous! Did have some problems when the meat left burnt brown bits on the skillet, the flour/milk mixture had burnt pieces mixed in. I had to make the mixture in a different skillet. Besides that one issue, the taste was delicious. I didn't have poppy seeds so I mixed the egg noodles with freshly ground peppercorn, lemon pepper, and dried parsley. Yum, yum!

These were very good but rich. Next time I may use 2 % milk instead of the evaporated milk. But my husband and kids all liked it very much.

This was really good.  I didn't have the allspice so just omited it.  I will bake the meatballs next time.  Its a texture thing...I like a firmer meatball...not a "steamed" type.

Very good recipe. Since I served the meatballs with garlic cheddar red skinned mashed potatoes, yummy!!! I doubled the sauce ammount. BUTTER, not oil is the way to go when frying if your looking for a good flavor and not worried about calories.  Next time I think I'll add some sour cream just to give it a little different taste.

These were very good but VERY rich.  Maybe I'll try subbing some of the evaporated milk for some 2% for part of it - but these were a hit with everyone!  Just can't make these every week...

This was great a recipe. My wife made the meatballs on Friday by Saturday they were gone. Made meatloaf on Sunday using the sause and it didn't last two days. Thanks for the recipe. We had to increase the sause because it would go fast before the meatballs.

This one was liked by my whole family, but I found it wasn't that flavorful...maybe I just wasn't in the mood for Swedish Meatballs.

My husband told me to rate this a 10+.  He loved this so much he wants it regularly.  I was not expecting this to taste this good! It brought back so many memories of the old frozen Swedish Meatball meals I used to eat all the time but these were so so much better!  Made a double batch, added an egg to the meat mixture and also about 4 cloves of garlic.  Followed the rest of the directions but tripled the amount of gravy because my husband has to have tons of sauce when there is a sauce involved.  It was great over noodles the way I had it but my hubby had his over mashed up boiled potatoes with butter on them and he said he only wants it with the potatoes.  Very very good!!

My husband made this recipe for me after hearing me complain that I wanted some Swedish meat balls from Ikea. These were better! I love the fact that the recipe does not use a cream soup. This recipe is the real deal!

Phenomenal!  One of the first meals my mom taught me to make was Swedish meatballs... I was delighted to find a recipe that doesn't utilize packaged seasonings or canned soup!  I made a few minor adjustments:  used a scant cup SEASONED breadcrumbs and also added 1 egg and minced garlic to the meat mixture.  I put the meat mixture in the freezer for 10 min prior to rolling into meatballs.  Although other users mentioned using olive oil - the "key" to authentic Swedish meatballs is to brown them in butter!!!  I used homemade beef stock instead of the bullion which gave the sauce an awesome flavor boost (but I'm sure bullion works just as well).  I did forget to add the lemon juice - but the sauce was perfect as is without it.  Served with traditional egg noodles the first night - served the leftovers with mashed potatoes the next day (it was AWESOME with mashed potatoes).  Mmmmmmm!

Thank you for this recipe, it was just what i was looking for. it is so simple and easy to put together. better than IKEA's swedish meatballs. only suggesting i have is to only add 1 buillion cube or use beef broth or stock to cut the salt content, which I did the second time i made this dish. both times i put the meatballs on a bed of egg noodles. i will definately make this twice a month.

These were absolutely incredible!!!!!  The meatballs were so tender.  I was skeptical that the evaporated milk in the sauce would make it super rich, but that wasn't the case at all.  I will surely make this again!

Very good and a nice change.  I decided to make this because my husband just loves swedish meatballs.  He loved them.  I cooked too many egg noodles and combined it all together so it was a little dry, but that was my fault.  I will definitely make them again.

I loved this!!!  All the family loved it.  The evaporated milk and the allspice is the key to this recepie.  I used 3/4 cup of Panko(bread crumbs)which really helped Ithink.  I also used the olive oil and i used garlic in the meatballs as well as in the oil I used for browning them.  I used whole wheat rotini noodles since I didn't have any other noodles in house.  My girlfriend says she never has had better and believe me she would tell me if they weren't!!!

I loved these. I went with 1/3 cup of condensed milk and 3/4 cup of bread crumbs. The meatballs came out absolutely delicious. I also added sauteed onions to the sauce, and a little white wine to deglaze the pan worked wonders.

This was good but the flavor(meatballs&gravy) was a bit bland, needed something(?) more. Per others, I baked in oven then deglazed in pan for gravy.

Love this dish!!  Only a few minor adjustments for my family. I added one pound of ground veal, one pound ground pork and doubled everything else. I make two batches and freeze one for another night.  This is truly a comfort food for us.

Excellent. I even messed up the recipe (won't say how - embarrassing) and had to make a substitution, but it was still very good. I used all the recommended ingredients (plus a little milk) and Italian bread crumbs. Will make this one again, b/c even if I mess up it will still taste wonderful!

My boyfriend loved them and I thought they were good. Next time I will let beef chill longer before trying to make meatballs (It was my first time at making meatballs!). Also next time I will add some garlic and thyme to beef. I thought the sauce was a little bland but by the second day it was great.

This recipe is what I imagine when I think of Swedish Meatballs.  Wonderful.  Two notes: It gets better the longer it sits and I would recommend using "Better than Buillon" beef base instead of regular buillon cubes as the depth it brings is out of this world.  Great recipe.

My husband says these get 4.5 stars.  They were very good, especially for my first attempt at making swedish meatballs from scratch.  I have used seasoning packets and frozen before, but I guess that's cheating! I didn't have allspice, so I used the advice of another reviewer and used nutmeg.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and was impressed when I was finished.  I think I will use this meatball recipe for my Italian meatballs from now on and change the allspice to garlic powder and use a red sauce in place of the white.  Thanks for another great recipe to add to the collection!

These are the best swedish meatballs.  You don't need to change a thing about them.  I received rave reviews from everyone.  This is a winner!

I loved the meatballs, but the sauce left much to be desired. I realize the sauce was supposed to have a subtle flavor, but it was just plain bland.  In a household that loves LOTS of flavor, it just didn't work.  So, I did some sprucing up...added all kinds of seasonings (can't remember them all)....and it turned out pretty good.  Once again, though, the meatballs were delicious...though I added additional bread crumbs, because they seemed TOO gummy.

I made this with venison and added a little nutmeg and white pepper to the gravey.  My husband and son loved it and as an added bonus it was quick and easy to make!

I made this for superbowl, it was excellent.  I used onion powder instead of onion, I was out.  I used nutmeg in replacement of the allspice.  I will be making this again.  It reminded me of what my Sweedish grandmother used to make.

This is a tasty recipe for swedish meatballs. I did not use the butter like another reviewer because the beef I used was not the leanest. I also used a sauce mix that I got from a swedish food store. next time I will try these and make the sauce along with it. Thank you.

It wasn't a quick and easy recipe - the sauce took forever to thicken. But the end result was very good and my husband and kids loved it. I even liked it and I don't usually like meatballs.

I thought this recipe was great. I did double the sauce and left out the onions. My boys are both very picky eaters and the gobbled the whole thing up. Yummy!

This was so good, I didnt cook the meatballs in butter though I just put them in the pan. The thought of cooking hamburger in butter grossed me out. I ould double the sauce though ( I like lots of sauce) over all this was soooo good.
