This was tasty!! I’m a personal chef and made it for a client. She doesn't do sugar so I used only 1 tablespoon of  erythritol to slightly cut the tang. Make it low carb without the carrots. I’ll be definitely making this again! Great to just have in the fridge to snack on through the week.

Made the recipe as printed.  It was good. Crunchy and tangy. Great for summer BBQ.
