Yum!! I had some fresh blueberries that needed to be used so this was perfect! I also, added walnuts. I made buttermilk using the vinegar and milk trick. My husband is a diabetic and swears by cinnamon so I added more than was called for. Also left out the sugar and used old fashioned oats (it was all I had). So good! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This recipe was great! The only change I made was that I used 2 tsp. pure maple syrup instead of the white sugar. Fluffy, moist, and tasty!

These were great! I added pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and they were fantastic. I also did a milk and lemon juice buttermilk substitution. I love that they call for more oats than whole wheat. I'll make these again!

If these can taste good after I messed up, then it's a keeper! I printed out the recipe, then decided to cut it in half. I did well until I got to the dry ingredients...forgot to halve them...So I added more milk and hoped for the best.  I put blueberries and walnuts in some of them.  Delicious and hearty.  Will make again for sure (hopefully in correct proportions).

These are amazing! The only change I made was adding 2 tablespoons of white vinegar to two cups of 2% milk to make a buttermilk substitute since I didn't have any buttermilk on hand. It still turned out great!

Delicious!  I substituted Stevia for the sugar and and added a generous sprinkling of nutmeg, (one) chopped apple, and some walnuts.  Cooked on a lightly oiled griddle rather than the skillet.  Perfect for a fall day.  Definitely a keeper.

Hubby and I really enjoyed these! I substituted almond milk for the buttermilk and regular milk. I also used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup flax meal in place of 1 full cup of whole wheat flour, and added in 1 1/2 cup frozen blueberries. These were delicious! Definitely reduce the salt to a 1/2 tsp or less or they will be too salty (and up the cinnamon to a full teaspoon for a stronger spice flavor). I like how easily adjustable this recipe is to fit your tastes. Overall, I will make these again because they are a tasty, and very hearty, breakfast option! Thank you!

Five stars because it's a great alternative pancake recipe.  I would cut the salt just a little, but other than that - recipe 'as written' is good.  If you don't want whole oats in the batter, just pulse the dry oats in the blender a bit first and that should take care of it!

Healthy twist on classic pancakes! 
Pancakes turned out really awesome, never would have thought about putting oats into the batter and we love cooking with whole wheat flour. I added some honey, pecans and a little bit of brown sugar (I tend to like things on the sweeter side) I did try 1 pancake before adding anything extra and it was delish too. 
Can't wait to try blueberries in these next time!

Made them first the way was written (they were ok), and then 2nd time changed up a bit (because I can:) First blended the oatmeal and replaced 1/4 c ground flax seed. Half buttermilk 1/2 almond milk. Oh and a tsp of Vanilla. Added a large apple diced and tossed with 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Topped with 1:1 Apple butter and maple syrup heated in micro.

This recipe was a complete success! I added more cinnamon and eliminated the salt, and added 1 1/2 cups of blue berries. It made about 20 pancakes. My family of 5 eliminated the stack and continued asking for seconds. I topped our pancakes off with a blueberry syrup. 1 1/2 cup of blueberries 1 cup sugar 2 TBS water. Brought to boil until all the berries popped. Set aside to cool until I was finished with the pancakes! Enjoy!!!!!

I just made this for breakfast, and It was a big hit with my family. Instead of sugar I used liquid honey which I put into the wet ingredients.  It turned  out perfect! I will definitely make this again.

Added blueberries and increased the cinnamon. Instead of sugar I used 2 packets of truvia and 0% milk. Made enough to freeze and have these on those hurry up mornings.

Too salty and bland. Not enough milk either. Proportions are off. I tried playing with it but couldn't get it just right.

I used kefir (healthy) instead of buttermilk, oat bran instead of quick oats, stevia instead of sugar, extra cinnamon and some frozen blueberries. My grandson loved it and asked for more.

Great recipe.  And does anyone else see that the picture looks like a guy trying to crawl out of the middle of the pancakes?  (Blueberry is the hair, head to the side, arms reaching out.). :)

These did come out nice and fluffy, but the flavor was terrible. My 8-year-old didn't care for it and I quite agreed. They were too salty, for one thing. One reviewer did say to cut the salt, but because I've made similar recipes that called for the same amount of salt I went according to the recipe. I couldn't taste the cinnamon, even though I doubled it. (Because I enjoy cinnamon.) There was a definite grainy quality to the finished product (I think it would have been better if I'd mixed it in a food processor). The flavor was harsh, and needed too much syrup to cover. But I don't want to cover the flavor of a multi-grain pancake, I want to enjoy it.

I'm not usually a big fan of pancakes but these are pretty good, and my kids (4 and 1) loved them! I added some fresh blueberries and about 1/4 cup of wheat germ; other than that, I followed the recipe as written and would definitely make them again.
