Hi folks I just wanted to add some information I thought might be helpful.  I'm Korean & galbi is always a favorite!  

The crockpot method everyone is mentioning is actually a legit Korean Dish called Galbi Chim (Braised Shortribs) Make sure and skim off the fat when it's done.. there will be a lot!  I like to use shortribs that are a few inchs across.  Makes for a nice meaty piece.  Additions of carrot, chestnut, boiler onion and potato is delish! Eat w/some steamed rice as the flavors will be pretty concentrated to eat alone.

Tip from my mom: remember to rinse off the ribs well before marinading.  Give the bones a good rub with your hands under some running water or you will bite in and get bone bits. Ouch! We like to just leave them in a colander to drain a bit.  Also the addition of 1/2 a grated kiwi or some pineapple will really make the meat tender if you intend to grill it.  Just make sure not to leave it in the marinade for more than a day.  I got carried away once and my meat fell apart as I was trying to put it on the grill!

Having spent considerable time in various eateries throughout South Korea, salivating over Gal-Bi, and missing it, I was brought back with this recipe. Thank you. I sent some with my spouse, to serve to an elderly Korean girl friend of hers. It definitely passed the test. She loved it. She offered a suggestion...Pepsi. She told me to add Pepsi! I added about a quarter can to the recipe and it rocks! Either way it's a great, great Korean taste to die for.

One of my new favorites, and always a huge hit at barbecues (cut into one bone per piece and served as finger food) or dinner parties (served over rice). I've always made it exactly as suggested, and typically marinate it over night.

A lot of people have been slow cooking this, and that's good too, but I definitely think it's best grilled. I recommend using hardwood charcoal, which burns hotter, and cooking for 3-4 minutes per side.

This cut of meat is sometimes hard to find, and even when you can, the selection can be very inconsistent -- too thick or too fatty. If it's too thick, it helps to pound it out into thinner slices.

Can't see how you can go wrong with this recipe. I  put everything together in the crock pot and cooked it on low all day. I used pork baby back ribs, (I boiled them first), but this would work with chicken, beef, old socks, you name it. So good.

This is a five star recipe!  My husband and kids all loved it.  I changed the recipe a little, I used hot sesame oil, left out the sugars and instead used a couple of squirts of honey and it turned out perfect!  Next time I'll try adding chopped green onions.  Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!

This was excellent! I marinated for about 36 hours and followed the recipe, except I slow baked mine in the oven and then placed the ribs under the broiler to crisp up. The flavor was divine! Thanks for the post!

I followed this recipe with the exception of the white sugar-I just used slightly less then a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and I added a few teaspoons of chili oil (we prefer more spicy to sweet). I let it marinate overnight and then threw it in the crock pot for 4 hours-it was SO yummy! Meat just fell off the bone! Next time I would probably serve with some form of potato vs. rice as the sauce is pretty greasy for pouring over rice. Enjoy!

Off the hook!!  Follow this recipe exactly as written.  You will not be sorry.  I did have the ribs butterflied by the butcher and cooked them on my All Clad grille pan.  Simply delicious!  Thank you for sharing.

If you want to use a slow cooker, you may add some peeled potatoes chopped into chunks of 1 1/2 - 2 inches. It's pretty good as well, and use beef flanken instead of using california ribs.

This recipe is unbelievable!  I couldn't find beef short ribs so I used pork country ribs.  I followed the recipe exactly as its written.  my husband loves my cooking anyway, but he raved about these ribs.  I made fried rice as a side dish. Wonderful together!  I've got them marinating now for tonight. I think I'm going to try to boil some of the marinade and serve a little bit as a dipping sauce with them.  I'll edit this and let you know how that turns out. These are perfect!

Amazing - and I did it without a BBQ or grill. I only made one substitution: replaced the water with Coke at the suggestion of a friend who makes these all the time. Then marinated for almost 24 hours, braised in a dutch oven at 300 for 4 hours. Removed the ribs, strained, defatted, and reduced the liquid. Brushed it back onto the ribs and broiled for 5-7 minutes per side. First time ever making ribs and it was a knockout.

Marinated for 36hours.  Could have easily done so for 2 days and the flavor would have been even better.

Oh, was this fantastic! I used boneless short ribs; cut back a little on the minced garlic because the amount in the recipe made me nervous; added two teaspoons of sesame seeds to the marinade. Marinated overnight, then put meat & marinade in the slow cooker on low for 7 hours. Browned under the broiler briefly. Served with Jasmine rice, ladling the sauce over everything. Definitely a keeper.

soooo Ono (good)!! In Hawaii, we say "Kal-Bi", no matter, it  totally rocks. I couldn't remember how make the marinade, thanks so much! I didn't add the Pepsi (from Brian's suggestion), but I do add 1/4 to 1/2 can of Pineapple/Passion Orange juice by Hawaiian Sun. Not sure if its available in the mainland states though, so if you'd like, just add 1/2 cp pineapple juice and maybe a squeeze of orange juice. Alright!!! Now we kau kau. (grind)

Really easy and really good. I did make some adjustments. I added season salt, onion powder, black pepper, and red wine vinegar to the marinade. I also used the marinade once removing the ribs. I simmered it down with some chopped celery, bay leaves and minced onions and used it to drizzle on top of the finished grilled ribs. Once I drizzled the sauce, I put them in the oven covered on 350 to bake for 30 minutes and they came out very tender and full of flavor. This is a keeper. Yum.

This recipe was great. My suggestion would be to marinate for the full 12 hours. I made the recipe almost as writted. I had more meat, so I doubled the marinade, excluding the garlic, onion, and sesame oil. I also added 2 ends of a green onion. I'm not a big sesame oil fan, thats why I didn't include the double amount. Regardless, great recipe. Will definately make again, but marinate longer.

Marinade is delicious. I highly recommend. 

I had to cook this in the oven (no BBQ) and next time I would do it slightly differently. Last night I just cooked it for 40 mins on 375 degrees but the ribs were still pretty fatty. I like them a little drier so I would cook them at 350 for maybe an hour on a rack (so they aren't sitting in a pool of grease) and then broil them for maybe 5 minutes. I think that would dry them out a little more and they would be a little crunchier. I also recommend keeping a little of the marinade separate from the beef and heating it up to serve with the rice with dinner. Just de-lish!

My husband LOVES these.  I make them in the crockpot.  They always turn out tender and delish.  I have  marinated overnight and just threw everything in the cockpot and turned it on.  Turns out great either way!  I only use half of the garlic.  Sometimes I use beer instead of water.  I want to try adding pineapple to the mixture next.

I made this receipe and modified it quite a bit.  I used the exact ingredients called for, except what I did completely different was I soaked the meat in cold water to take out the impurities, I did this for about 45 min., then I boiled the ribs for 2 hours.  I added some garlic from the jar to increase the flavour.  (For 3 people I used 7 very meaty beef ribs.) At the 2 hour mark you can tell the ribs are starting to soften up.  I then transferred the meat to a casserole dish and poured the mixture of it.  I cooked it at 400 degrees for 1 hour in the oven.  It was so flavorful and tender.  The meat fell right off the bone!  These are by far the best beef ribs I've ever made!

Loved these ribs! I cooked them in the crock pot on low overnight and warmed them back up with some carrots. I served them with white short grain rice to complete the meal. The best meal we have had in a long time. The sauce was perfect poured over the rice.

I used ribs in the crock pot. Even tho they all fell off the bone everyone LOVED them. The kids actually fought over the last of the meat..will have to make a lot more next time. I made rice to go with. Put in pineapple juice as someone recommended. Let cook on low from 9:30 to 3, then on Keep warm til we ate at 5. Next time I will use boneless and make a lot more!!! My 4yr old son is still crying for more meat!!

I used this marinade for both thin sliced flank steak skewered on the grill, and with short ribs in the slow cooker. I marinated both overnight. Both were good but we preferred the flank steak. The ribs were too fatty, probably because I couldn't find the flanken cut ribs, so I used the traditional cut. But the marinade is excellent and very close to what we get at our local Korean BBQ restaurant.

There are many variations to this recipe that I suggest you try. In my family's recipe, we add diced (asian) pears and red wine. You can add other fruits to it as well and it turns out even more delicious.

I've had some real Korean Kalbi and this was not nearly as good as the kind in the restaurant, but my family enjoyed it nonetheless. I might try to add some other spices, such as ginger, green onion and sesame seeds to see if it resembles the real Korean taste.

Very easy to make and absolutely delicious.  The hardest part is looking for that specific cut of meat, usually in Korean or Japanese supermarkets.

I made this recipe for the first time and it was a hit.  My kids loved it.  I also substituted chicken for my husband since he's trying to limit his red meat.  I did as the recipe said and it was soooo good.

this was really good. my husband loved it! I didnt have time to marinate the ribs as indicated, and it still came out great! i also ran out of brown sugar, so i substitued some molasses. I can't wait to make this again so i can marinate the meat for more  flavor. I also crock potted it for about 6-7 hours on low. easy and yummy!    I've also used this marinade on pork roast in the crock pot.. melt in your mouth goodness!

I LOVE this recipe. It tastes just like the Galbi you have in the Korean restaurants in Koreatown here in LA. I can't always get short ribs with the bone in so the boneless large pack at Costco works just fine. I add a bit of crushed pineapple or minced Kiwi to the marinade to tenderize the meat. My Korean gf gave me that suggestion and it works wonders.

I love this recipe! I follow as directed and serve with rice and green lettuce (Bangja Gui) I make a sauce to go with the lettuce wraps. Soy, sriracha, water, brown sugar, garlic powder, and a lil sesame oil. I don't know the measurements...I just add a lil here and a lil there.

My hubby loved this!!  I boiled the ribs for about 15-20 minutes before throwing it in the crock pot.  Sauce went in (substituted water for chicken stock and pepper for red pepper flakes).  Cooked it for about 6 hours and threw in some slice green onions before serving.  No leftovers and it was just the 2 of us!

Excellent recipe.  I altered it slightly by first braising the ribs in a slow cooker for 4 hours & then finishing on the grill.  Served with Asian coleslaw, and it was DELICIOUS.  Please see my blog post on this recipe for additional pictures: http://kitchenandcraftadventures.blogspot.com/2011/05/korean-bbq-short-ribs.html

Very Yummy.
Made some alterations for my 3 pounds of boneless short ribs. I reduced the amount of black pepper and sesame oil by 1/2.  
After tasting the sauce mixture, I found it to be too salty and acidic for my liking, so an additional 2 tablespoons of brown sugar were added.  It is also the middle of the winter, so bbq grilling was not an option. Instead of slow cooking it as others suggested, I then pan fried it to a medium-rare to get that browning on the edges.  Also, instead of discarding marinade, I actually kept it and used it to cook with the meat as well. As the marinade cooked and reduced, it became a great gravy sauce to top the short ribs with.
Whole thing came out very delicious. It's a keeper!

Truely a 5 star recipe.  Can't go wrong with it the way it's written.  I'm in Okinawa and our base commissary always seems to have flanken style ribs for very reasonable prices.  So, we have them a couple times per month.  An Okinawan lady told me to put an Asian pear in the blender with all other ingredients. (Asian pears are shaped more like an apple and have greenish yellow skin) The pear will tenderize the meat and it produces an unbelievable taste.  I've also put pineapple juice and fresh pineapple in the marinade before too.

It was probably my fault because I did these in a crock pot BUT they looked, smelled and tasted bland.  I had to special order the ribs because I wanted to follow the recipe in terms of ingredients.  I think if I'd used pork short ribs and cooked as directed, they would have been much better.  Ono Spareribs (later found in my recipe folder) are wonderful and that's what I was picturing.

Tried it and loved it, did the crock pot way, used frozen beef ribs, threw everything in. Also made a veg. melody with squash, zuc's, tomatoes, green onions and onion in sesame oil and soy sauce,(What I had on hand) stripped the meat from the bone and since it pulled apart easily shredded it into the veggies and added left over liquid from crock pot, used baster to get liquid under beef grease, then with what was left put in freezer to skim off for later use on other recipes. Served it all over fluffy rice, Hubby loved it, he added more soy sauce for his taste, all in all it's a keeper. Thanks!!

Very good recipe.  Instead of white & brown sugar you can use honey, which works just as well.  Although the soy sauce version tastes good...in my opinion using teriyaki sauce  instead gives it a better taste.

This recipe is off the hook. I have been searching for a good bbq recipe and this is it. I am telling my friends. I made exactly as the recipe said with the exception of I also added a pear as someone else suggested. Also, I took all of the hard ingredients (pear, onion, garlic etc.) and blended them for a couple of seconds instead of chopping them. It gave the marinade a lot of flavor. At first it smelled like the onions were going to be too strong this way, but it turned out perfect. Thanks for the recipe.

I am updating review...  I now LOVE it.  Versatile like no other.  I was searching for an easy crockpot (quick version is to simmer in pot on stove) recipe for beef ribs for two people.  I didn't have time to let them marinate.  I didn't have sesame oil and I used olive oil, eyeballed all other ingredients.  I slow cooked them for about 5 hours (2 hours for simmering, be sure to use onion & garlic if nothing else) and they were about to fall apart.  We threw them on the bbq and used Pappy's White Lightning bbq sauce from Bass Pro Shop.  YUM!  The ribs were so tender, so tasty even before we put the bbq sauce on. You might not need oil if you are slow cooking this as my ribs were already fatty, but I won't take anything away from this simple and flexible recipe. We used to bake our ribs before bbq but my husband wants me to do them this way from now on.  THANK YOU!

Super easy and delicious!  I always add some type of citrus to help tenderizing.  Other than that I follow this recipe to the letter.  We've made these ribs on the BBQ and in the Crock Pot.  Both ways is great. Marinating overnight is key.

Really enjoy the flavours of this. washed meat before hand after reading a review.  Marinaded beef ribs for approx 30 hours.  Used pineapple for the last hour to help break down the meat to tenderize it. Worked great.  However I made enough ribs to try two different methods of cooking, I've done the grill before and it wasn't operational from the cold weather so I fried them in the frying pan and tried slow roasting in the oven.  The oven method did not turn out well.  I think they need to be cooked fast.  The frying pan was great to cook them.  Fresh out of the pan they have a lot of flavour.

This was a hit with everyone. I didn’t have onion but ended up using chopped green onions instead. I also used a low sodium soy sauce.  It turned out delicious over the grill. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty, but a little too much black pepper.  Sesame oil makes it hot enough - a whole
tablespoon is a little overkill - crock pot is the way to go

Absolutely loved it!  Made it exactly as instructed except only marinated it for 5 hours and it still tasted delicious!  My husband and son both loved it as well.  I'll make this all summer long.

My one and only korean-style marinade. You don't necessarily have to use shorts ribs all the time (it can get pricey). If lucky, sometimes I would use various types of tender beef cuts that has some kind of fat in it.

Great. My partner doesn't normally like marinated meats. This is the exception. It would be best (like most other meats) to cook over the grill, but we made do with stove-top cooking. Added stir fry veggies on the side. Summer plans include grilled pineapple.

I made this recipe for a crowd of people and the flew off the plate!!  I followed the directions, as is, except washing the rib first in cold water to rinse away any bone fragments. (as someone else suggested)  I let them marinade over night, cooking them on the grill around 5pm the next day.  They were to die for!!  I do not understand how they could be tough unless they are overcooked?!?!?!?!?  Thank you for the recipe.  I have stockpiled korean ribs in my freezer so I can make them again and again!

These are great! We have made these two weekends in a row and they make two meals for us. We pair them with the three cheese scalloped potatoes on this site.

I slow cooked these and the taste could not be better. I think I picked slightly the wrong cut of rib (mine was labeled 'beef back ribs') because there was barely any meat to be found within the bones and fat. Every piece of meat I retrieved however was delicious.

I have made this so many times, and it has been perfect every time. It is really easy to prepare, as well. I have made it for a lot of different people, who have all raved about it. I've used different cuts of beef including tenderloin tips, sirloin tips, boneless short ribs, bone-in short ribs, and it has always been so tasty. Last night, I baked bone-in short ribs on a rack, in a convection oven setting at 275ºF for about 40 minutes. They turned out really well. Enjoy!

In case anyone is going...Wow, that's a long time to marinate.  Do not cheat the marinate time.  If you have TMJ, your jaws will get a workout.  I'll rate it 5 stars because I know it'll be good next time.

Absolute perfection!  After marinating overnight I browned the ribs in a small bit of oil, placed in the crockpot, simmered the remaining marinade in the same pan to reduce a bit and scrape up the brown bits, then poured over the ribs and cooked on "HI" for 4 hours.

Really very good.  I changed it up a bit.  I lightly dredged the ribs in flour salty and pepper and browned in bacon grease.  Deglazed pan with beef stock an added with chopped bacon and some of the grease to the liquid and cooked in my pressure cooker on high pressure for 1 hour.

Tastes great!  Even my grandson (age 3) liked it.  Easy and quick.  I followed this recipe "to a t" and it was fine, although it may be a tad salty for some folks.  Just remember, you need to plan ahead for this since it requires some time to marinade.

I tried this recipe twice and still do not care for it and do not think it is authentic. I lived in Korea for two years and this recipe doesn't taste like the dish I ate when I lived there.  I tried it in the crockpot, as one reviewer suggested, that was terrible and not very flavorful as the crockput ends up having too much water and the meat was tasteless. The second time, I broiled it thinking it would be better and didn't care for the taste of the meat that way either.  I marinated it a long time and was very disappointed.  I will not make this again.

The flavor of the sauce is unbelievable. I boiled the marinade for a few minutes and poured it over rice. Delicious! While I enjoyed the charbroiled medium rare beef on the grill, next time I think I will use the crockpot for more tenderness.

Sooooo AMAZING!! I used boneless short ribs and  followed the remaining ingredients exactly and marinated for 17 hours. The previous comments were helpful. Marinating for longer is better. I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved them. Will definitely make this again!

Very delish!  I read one of the reviews and it said that this cut is hard to find.  Mostly, you can find this cut in Asian markets.  Most big enough Asian market carries it.

Well, I deviated for my own taste. I used 1 C low sodium Kikkoman soy, 1/2C water, 2 tblsp rice vinegar, 1/2 cup brn sugar, 1/2 tsp fresh grnd black pepper. Original measurements w/sesame oil & garlic but used 4 chopped up grn onions, 1 tsp of sesame seeds, a tsp of ginger paste and the juice from 1 small can of pineapple to tenderize. Mixed all that up and put in a large ziplock bag with 2lbs of plain ol' beef short ribs (after rinsing & soaking in cold water for an hour). Marinaded for 24 hours. I couldn't wait to fire up the grill (finally) and even though my short ribs were about 3" wide, they grilled up tender and so flavorful. I got meaty short ribs which I cut a layer of fat off and pulled off that piece of tough membrane like pork ribs have on the underside. I forgot to have the butcher cut them into thinner slices across the bones but will next time for a more authentic dish. Even my thicker cut turned out awesome. Next time short ribs are on sale I will buy like 6 lbs and have them cut properly. I love this recipe even tho I changed it a bit. Served with fresh sesame green beans and sticky rice. GREAT, Love it!

As good as one of my favorite Korean restaurants I frequent, this is a treat during the summer when we grill.  One of these days I'll try to pan cook it, but only after I get some better cookware.  I also added kiwi to the marinade, and the meat was falling off the bone.  Thank you for this recipe, it's one of my favorites.

I think this recipe is wonderful! But I must tell you all my mistake and not to make the same one....I like lots of sauce so I doubled everything, including the GARLIC.  Double everything else if you like sauce but for heaven's sake, use the same amt. of garlic.  I didn't think it was possible to use too much but now I've learned.  I came home to a house smelling like a garlic explosion.  I did use the crock pot, they are nice and tender.  I will make again, but with much less garlic, esp. if doubling the marinade ingredients.

I've made it several times and all my friends love it.  I skipped the black pepper and it just tastes like the one you get in Korean restaurant.  I also found the onion optional.

GREAT Flavor....  pretty close to what you would get at your local Korean Restaurant.  I used some thicker sliced spare ribs but would say stick to the thin ones.  Overall - Great Recipe – would make a good steak marinade too!

This was very good. I use boneless short ribs. Eye balled the soy and oil. I also added hot pepper sauce and wasbi. I cooked in a crock pot and the last 15 min I added rice noodles. Would also try making with pork loin another time. If you don't have sesame oil you can use olive oil. Oh and I also add about 4 large portabella's I had chopped up.

Delicious flavor. I think if you don't use the flanken short ribs, these need to be cooked for a very long time either in a slow cooker, low oven or slowly on the stovetop to make these less fatty and tenderize them a bit.

Next time, I'll be sure we use the flanken cut ribs. Definitely will be using this recipe a lot.

I didn't follow the measurements exactly I just poured things to taste.  I did add sliced green onions instead of the mince onion and added a grated pear to help tenderize it.  Definitely get the flanken style shortribs.  I love the chewy skin part near the bone! yum! Note: it gets very smokey if you grill indoors learn that the hard way =) will definitely try making it with the slow cooker as some reviewers did

This recipe is great.  I have a friend who was born and raised in Korea.  These ribs tasted just like the ones she makes.  I used boneless short ribs instead just because I am picky about bones in my meat and they still turned out great. I use toasted sesame oil instead of just sesame oil for a little more flavor.  Theses ribs are a hit with all who try them.

Yes I did make a few changes. I used Rice vinegar for the white  vinegar.  The 1 tablespoon of black pepper was way too much.  I used about 1/2 and it was still too much. I added 1 1/2 cup of vegetable stock with 1 tablespoon or corn starch since I was serving with rice and wanted enough liquid.  Other than the heat the taste was great.  I will make it again with 1 teaspoon of black pepper.

This was so freaking good! My boyfriend loved it, he said it reminded him of real Korean short ribs! I replaced the water with Pepsi. I would highly recommend that! Then I BBQ’ed(coal) them about 4 mins on each side. Will be making these again soon! Next time I might add some sriracha or chili flakes to add some spice.

Made it for Easter Sunday BBQ. Big Hit.  Voted best by all family and friends. 
I skipped white sugar and used half of brown sugar to make it a bit healthier, but it's still pretty sweet.  
I used more garlic, more onion, and more sesame oil.  More flavorful. 
Grilling instruction is also perfect! Thanks!

This was an amazing recipe! Honestly the best short ribs I’ve ever had. Used all organic ingredients and substituted coconut aminos for the soy sauce (that’s the paleo substitute for soy sauce), and substituted honey for the white sugar. Marinated for about 20 hours. I will make this again...often!

If you like it spicy consider adding hot chili pepper flakes to the recipe. I made a 3 serving size batch and added about 1tsp. The spice level and flavor was amazing

Great recipe, lots of flavor. Definitely recommend a 24 hour marinade. I subbed all the sugar for a few squirts of honey, and added some chili infused olive oil to give it a kick. 
Easy to cook on the BBQ and a family favorite!

I will definitely make this again! I didn’t have short ribs so I used lean pork, the other white meat. I marinade overnight & added sesame seeds to the marinade. I grilled the pork meat to give it the grill marks & then transfer the them to the oven. Turned out delicious!

I only marinated for 3 hours since I got a late start. Also, I cooked it on a ceramic grill pan on medium heat on the stove. 5 minutes on each side and though it was a bit chewier than it might have been with a longer marinating time, the flavor was on point! Delicious.

This recipe is fantastic!!! I can't say enough what a great base recipe this is. I loved the green onion garnish as it brings an added flavour to the meat. I used rice vinegar instead of  regular white vinegar and it definitely made a difference. Also, I used Demerara sugar instead of regular brown sugar and it definitely brought out more flavours. I didn't have a regular white onion but it didn't seem to make a difference. Next time, I will try adding in either Pepsi or Sprite instead of water and I'll add in some fresh ginger as well. But all in all, this recipe is a slam dunk and tastes just like the short ribs I get at my favourite Korean BBQ restaurant in Toronto. Thank you so very much for sharing!

Delicious!  Substituted green onions and added some sesame seeds, otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Marinaded for about 9 hours.  Definitely a keeper.

I had to use regular beef ribs instead of short ribs, because my supermarket was sold out. Because beef ribs can be tougher, I decided to throw these in the slow cooker for about 6 hours on high, and they turned out wonderfully tender. They just fell right off the bone. I added chili oil and ginger, and doubled the garlic, but these still turned out too sweet for our taste. I think next time I'll add more chili oil and decrease the sugar. I was concerned about it being overly salty after tasting the marinade, but the final product had the perfect level of salt. I can't wait to try this with actual short ribs, and broil them instead of slow cooking.

I added fresh ginger to the marinade and let it sit in the fridge for 24 hours.  I served the beef with basmati rice and an Asian chopped salad.  The family loved it!!

This is a great recipe, and the marinade is excellent.  I followed the directions as written except adding some Sprite for the lemony background as one reviewer recommended.  Definitely use short ribs, too. I tried it with beef back ribs and it was a wee bit fatty.  But that was my fault. This recipe is a keeper!

Awesome dish made in a crockpot. I think 1/2 cup of soy sauce would suffice and increase water to 1 cup to make it less salty if made this way. Kiwi is essential and the secret ingredient.  traded out sesame oil with sesame seeds (to make less oily) and used rice vinegar and added couple tablespoons of mirin for more authentic flavor.  Lastly add potato, carrot and shitake mushroom for ez one pot dish. Serve with rice and garnish with green onion. It's a ez party pleaser for sure!

Made it, and it tasted exactly as I hoped! I thought it was restaurant quality, or at least made by a good chef. I've eaten my fair share of short ribs, as it's one of my favourite dishes especially the Korean BBQ kind. 

One note, be careful how much onion you put in, they say half a large onion, but I found that to be too much (The large onions that are about the size of a orange). Half of the smaller sized ones is perfect!

This is an awesome recipe! I had read a few before choosing this one because it seemed the simplest and I already had most of the ingredient. I only deviated a little - I used light brown sugar and scallions mixed with a small piece of onion I threw in to use up. Also, we broiled the meat since we live in an apartment and don't have a grill. With some white rice and kimchi ordered in we enjoyed a wonderful meal!  I will definitely be making this again.

This was an easy recipe to make. I read quite a few reviews, which I used some of the tips and suggestions.
For me I added red pepper flakes and toasted sesame seeds. I didn't have sesame seed oil so I used canola oil.  The ribs marinated for about 5 hours. 
I baked the ribs on a shallow pan in foil at 275° for almost two hours. 
I put the remaining marinade in a saucepan adding 3/4 cup more brown sugar. Reduced in half cooking slowly with a constant stir.  Added  cornstarch and water to thicken a bit more. 
Barbecued the ribs basting with marinade glaze. They were so tender and moist, melted in your mouth.

Don't boil your ribs for too long, keep an eye on them or they will fall apart. Putting this sauce on them and then broiling them makes them so good. I've used this sauce recipe on other meats as well. Fantastic!!

This recipe is RIGHT ON. I only marinated the galbi for 30 minutes, and it still tasted amazing. I also used the marinade on chicken, and it was awesome. This marinade is a keeper!

I added chopped green onions and a bit of ginger to make this recipe simply amazing. BBQ the chicken over low heat and during the final two minutes of grilling place the meat over high heat to get a nice crispy taste!

OMG!! delicious!!  added a grated peeled kiwi to the marinade to ensure tenderness as everyone was skeptical but their wasn't enough!! everybody kept eating till it was gone then complained that almost 6 pounds of ribs was not enough for 4 people!!  A keeper and I am using this marinade for the cheaper cuts of meat that are a little tougher and could use this delicious flavor!!!.

I gave this one three stars because although the flavor was good, my ribs were tough---I think next time I make this I'll take other posters advice and put in a bit of pineapple or kiwi for the enzymes needed to tenderize it.

It may have been the meat and not the recipe but this was not as good as others I have had. I did add the green onions and pineapple chunks to the marinade.  It sat in the frige overnight and then some but the ribs were still very tough.  The flavor was surprisingly subtle but delicious. I give it 4 stars for flavor.

This was very good.  I used boneless short ribs b/c that is what the supermarket had.  I marinaded them overnight.  I used light brown sugar and added a little molasses (it was all I had in the house).  Would definately make these again.

Really great flavor, however a bit salty - would probably use the low sodium soy sauce next time.  We didn't have time to marinate overnight, so our ribs marinated for about an hour or two, then we threw the whole thing, marinade and all, into the oven and cooked it low and slow.  Delicious!!  I served this with fresh broccoli that I also cooked in the oven with some of the marinade from the meat, a perfect side dish.  Looking forward to trying this again and doing the overnight marinade & grill - perhaps might not be as salty then as well.  A keeper!

I cooked these in the slow cooker then finished them under the grill in the oven after brushing them with some ketchup manis, brown sugar and sprinkling of sesame seeds.  Very tasty ribs. A little on the salty side but not so much that you couldn't eat them. Next time I would add some ginger & chilli.

Yummy! I was afraid to use a crockpot but did try it....at about the 4 hour mark, I drained it all and added more sauce for about another hour or 2.(quite oily)  It darkened up and was so tender, sometimes grilling can leave the meat a little tough.  I also added onions and they caramelized with it.  Next time I will add potato.

I made this for my wife and I last night.  I came across some 'last day of sale' boneless short ribs at the local grocery store and had to try it out.  My wife has an allergy to garlic, so I left it out, and I'm not sure that the garlic is even necessary..  Of course, I haven't tried it with the garlic, but it was superb without it.  Absolutely excellent!  I look forward to trying the marinade with regular beef ribs next time I get them.

Both my BF and I enjoyed this. I marinated it for 18 hours before he cooked it on the grill... it smelled so delicious as it was cooking. He took a bite and said, "This is good, babe." I didn't change anything in the recipe, besides adding about 3/4 cup of Pepsi to help tenderize and sweeten. We still have half a batch still in the fridge waiting to be grilled... I can only imagine the flavor that will have.. it's been already been a few days! This will be a good standby recipe for Korean style BBQ.

This was very easy and very good. I didn't use the sesame seed because I don't like it.

GREAT recipe.  I grew up with this and it is spot on!  Another secret is to soak the meat in coke overnight and then marinade - it will help to tenderize the meat.  We also add jalapenos to the marinade to add some heat.

Very good recipe! Used beef shanks and slow-cooked for 2 hours.  Also added some carrots and shiitake mushrooms.

these were good and will probably make again, but they weren't 5* in my book. I had plenty of korean food while there for a year and these were a bit too vinegary and peppery then that of which I remember. Koreans like their food hot and spicy not so much peppery. LikeI said these were good for themselves not necessarily Korean.

Very good recipe that my family raved over. I used pork spare ribs, marinated over night and saved the sauce to mop the ribs as they cooked. A huge hit and thank you!

I made these for a family that was going through a rough time, and it was so fabulous and easy.  I used a slow cooker, and the only thing I will do differently next time is to use more short ribs.  They cook down to not a whole lot of meat, mostly fat and bone.  It was super with some mashed potatoes and green beans.

Absolutely delicious! I added sliced green onions to the marinade, even for the ribs. Served this to a culinary arts teacher and a man who is a very picky eater--he ate several servings and she took the recipe to share with her class. Give it a try, it is  wonderful. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

OMG! These short ribs are very good! At first I marinated for two days then put them in the broiler...WONDERFUL!!
The second time (a week later) I marinated one day and put on the grill.
Much better the first time but very good marinade! Serve with white rice

I made this the other night following the recipe and OMG it is soooo good. The meat was a litte fatty but I didn't care. I just with I had made more! This marinade will be good on anything.
