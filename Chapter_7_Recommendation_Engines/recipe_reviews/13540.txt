Scalloped oysters is one of the "must-haves" on my husband's Thanksgiving menu. I've tried making them before without much success. This time I scored a huge hit! He told me to make sure I hang onto this recipe. The 2 things I did a little differently: I used half & half in place of milk. And Ritz Garlic Butter crackers instead of plain Ritz. Excellent, simple recipe! Thank you!

I used this recipe at Thanksgiving....It was a great success!  The only change I made was to use half and half in place of milk.  I found I didn't have to use more than 1/2 cup and felt it made the recipe "richer".

All I can say is WOW! This was so delicious. I used exactly the amount of ritz and bread crumbs specified and only 3/4 one stick of butter instead of a whole stick and it was still plenty buttery. I also used clam juice (with a little more than the recipe called for since a few people said it was dry in their reviews) because we had steamed oysters the night before and I didn't have any oyster juice left. I also cooked it at 400 instead of 450 and it was Perfect at thirty minutes. We are thinking about adding sauteed onions next time for more texture. Try this, you won't be disappointed!!!

I have found ritz crackers work the best and baking at 450 is way to high.  375 works just fine.

I made these as the recipe directed and they turned out very well.  For someone who enjoys oysters, which I do, it really showcases them.   I made them again for my sister who normally will not eat oysters and I wanted to spice it up disguise the "fishy" taste so I added 1/4 tsp of chili powder and 1/4 cup of salsa.

Great recipe.  So much easier than breading and pan frying.  It's been requested again for tomorrow - Easter Sunday.

This recipe is o.k.. There is nothing wrong with it except it's a little dry. I found it to be boring and taste mostly like buttery crackers.

My mother made this every year for Christmas as I was growing up, and this year I wanted to make this dish for me - to make my Christmas a little more meaningful! This dish turned out great. I sized it for 2, since it was only my husband and I sharing this... Thank you so much for sharing this and making my Christmas so special this year. There were no alterations - and made it exactly as given.

This recipe was very good, but next time I will know to make a few alterations; the bread crumbs could be completely eliminated and replaced with crackers.  They really took away from the overall texture.  Also it was very dry - next time I will add a little more milk or cream.

Great recipe!!!  Since I like a little more flavor, I sauteed 1/2 an onion in 1/8 of butter and then mixed it with the breadcrumbs.  I also mixed in 2 tsp of Old Bay and 10 dashes of tabasco sauce.  Awesome!

Warning: this is REALLY salty (I used unsalted butter too). I used whole wheat Ritz crackers, and it was still plenty buttery and delicious.

This is a traditional Thanksgiving dish in my family, and it was just like the recipe I was used to growing up. Oyster crackers were on sale at the store, so I used those instead...and it's fitting with the dish!

This is a hit at our house. I used 1 cup of home-made italian bread crumbs on the coarse side and used 2 cans of oysters since I had them on hand already. My husband ate so much of this that I was scared he was going to get sick. He wants me to serve it for Thanksgiving this year too. Thanks for sharing.

Very good, very easy. My guest loved this dish, especially the men who already loved oysters. Try to find the smaller oysters as they are easier to eat.

I like this recipe but the oyster flavor was really strong.  I will use different oysters next time.

The finished result was too dry and salty. Maybe I missed something in the receipe.

It was eatable but definetly not anything special. I used canned oysters, so that may not have helped. Way too rich for me as well, I felt sick after a few bites.

I have been wanting to try scalloped oysters for a long time. This is not what I had in mind. Too heavy, weighed down by too much butter.

We didn't use any bread crumbs instead we used crackers on both top and bottom. My mom has made this for year this way so we just adopted this with this recipe.

I love oysters so it would be hard to go wrong with this dish.  I made it exactly as written with the exception of the milk.  I used half n half instead.  It was delicious.

My family loved it! I made a few changes: 
whole sleeve of crackers, 
Italian bread crumbs, 
1/2 cup oyster liquid (added 1/4 cup water to 1/4 oyster liquid), 
Mild shredded cheese (Lightly covered each layer except top layer), 
Baked about 40 - 45 minutes. Next time I want to try scallions and a splash of Worcestershire. Can't wait to cook again!

Made this tonight for the family and close friends, they loved it!!  We had fresh oysters flown in for the holidays and had some left over, this recipe was the bomb. I followed the recipe closely except I added saluted onions, half & half instead of milk and some Worcestershire Pepper to the crumb mix. Will certainly make this again, probably tomorrow.

Good basic oyster recipe. A little dry compared to the Joy of Cooking recipe.  I like the buttery crackers rather than the bland salteens. But I am going to add about a half of cup of half and half cream to the recipe.  It needs a little moisture.  I am making a casserole tonight so will update my review tomorrow.

I made this recipe as written and I didn't care for these at all. I thought the flavor of the oysters was too strong but my husband loved them. I won't make them again unless he asks for them. With the price of oysters, I would rather use them in a dressing recipe.

Loved it.  I make my own version which is almost exactly like this.  DO NOT use canned or Willapoint oysters.  I only use Appalachicola oysters, but when not available, I will use any others than those stinky things.  I have to make it for every Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner.  Quality of the oysters is so important when creating this amazing and expensive holiday treat. Men have fallen in love with me over this recipe.

My husband absolutely LOVED this dish!  He said it was the best way he's ever had oysters and I'm sure he will be asking for it frequently.  He took some to work the following day and shared it with his coworkers who begged for the recipe!  I personally can't stand oysters so I haven't tried it, but I love my husband and will definitely make it for him!
