Yeah, you could definitely use wine instead of beer to deglaze the pan.  I'm thinking white would be a good complement to to apricots, but red would certainly do in a pinch, and would be nice with the spices.

This was definitely edible, but less than shockingly amazing. It smelled amazing, but lacked something in the taste. Also, I would go easy on the onions and maybe add pineapple or crushed red pepper? Or cilantro? I don't know, it just needs something else.

Very very good.  I use the big can of budweiser and canned apricots. The sauce is so good.  There is never enough.

This sounded a lot better than it actually was.  Just not my flavor profile.  Sorry.

I prepared this recipe using dark beer, added chicken stock base and some all-fruit apricot spread for flavor, a chopped red pepper, plus green olives to make it more like a tagine!  It was delicious!
