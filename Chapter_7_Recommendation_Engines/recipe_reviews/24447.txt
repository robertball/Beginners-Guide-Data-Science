I was so pleasantly surprised how good these cookies are. They are easy to make and the anise seed is a wonderful addition. I do not like the flavor of licorice but my fiancee does so I made them for him, tastes nothing like licorice. Nice crunchy cookie with a buttery flavor. I will make these a lot, not just on hoildays! Do not try the dough.... they are better baked.

My hubby likes Jingles cookies at Christmas time, I thought I'd like to find a recipe that would not have all the partially hydrogenated stuff in it.  He likes these.  I knew I wasn't very good at rolling stuff out. So I tried rolling them into balls and then rolling them in cinnamon sugar.  Came out yummy.
Even if you roll them in cinnamon sugar you don't need more than the 1/4 cup you make in the recipe.  I think next time, the only thing I would try is rolling them into balls and flattening them slightly. Rolling them made 54 cookies. But that isn't necessary just something I might try.

Family members liked these more than I did. What I do like about it is that it calls for the seeds instead of extract, which mellowed the anise flavor, making it appropriate for everyday eating, with coffee or tea. The sugar-cinnamon topping definitely adds to the cookie, and gives it a nice crunch, but also removes somewhat from its buttery-ness.  I also made a few with some nutmeg added to the topping and it was a nice addition.

The taste was right, but they were as hard as a rock.  Not sure what I did wrong.  Would like something a little more moist.

I knew I would like these cookies but I was unsure of my son because of the licorice taste of anise seed but he loves them! Way too go. I will be making these more often

These are simply delicious and so easy to make. I wasn't in the mood to roll out the dough so I spooned the mix into balls and pressed them with a glass into rounds - then sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar. I cut the recipe in half and regretted that after tasting the first cooky. They didn't last long at my house. Everyone loved them and I'll definitely be making a larger batch next time.

I Loved theese.  When your getting ready to bake them, put the Anise seeds  on your board and run over them with your rolling pin a few times,  it will release more of the licorice flavor. and then you can run a sharp knife through them to chop into fine pieces, texture is better that way.
I shaped  the cookies into the double S shape in the picture. you can glaze them or dust with powder suger too.

Recipe should specify salted or unsalted butter.  I used unsalted and added salt.  In addition to anise seed, I added ground fennel seed, used 50% whole wheat flour.  Very good cookies.

Surprisingly delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as written.  It could use just a bit more anise.  But also taste great as written.
