I just made this the other day when I was looking for new ways to serve pasta. I am not surprised to find it featured in the daily recipe emailing.  I used lower sodium bacon (the only thing we ever have), three fresh tomatoes and a small yellow onion (again because this is what I had on hand). I omitted the added salt and poured off the extra grease and added a bit of extra pepper. As I found the sauce a bit dry for our tastes, I did about 1/4 cup of no-sodium chicken broth and simmered. I added the bacon, parmesan cheese and some parsley to the pan just before serving and sprinkled a handful of crumbled fresh mozzarella on top on the plates.  Very tasty and well received by my husband, college age daughter and her friend. I gave it five stars because, although I did not follow the recipe as written, this is an excellent "idea" recipe to enjoy and be creative.  I will make this again. Next time, I am thinking I might try the sauce with the cream mentioned by another reviewer, instead of the chicken broth. I am thinking that another time I might vary by adding grilled chicken pieces.  Thank you for the versatile recipe.

If I could give this 10 Stars, I would! My kids who don't care for tomatoes, absolutely loved this recipe! My husband said it was restaurant quality....music to a cooks ears!!
Per other reviews, I doubled the tomatoes(I used diced tomatoes seasoned with basil, garlic & oregano) added a 14 oz can of chicken broth and added 1 cup of 1/2 & 1/2. I wanted to serve this as a main dish, so I diced and sauteed 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I set aside and sauteed yellow onion, diced red bell pepper and garlic in a portion of the bacon grease. I added the tomatoes & chicken broth, and simmered for 10 minutes, then added the 1/2 & 1/2 and 12 oz angel hair pasta. I served topped with bacon, chicken and fresh grated parmesan cheese. This is recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

this was very delicious and i find myself making it often -- here is a piece of advice.. It is also wonderful cold - i made it and took it to my family reunion this summer and before it had time to heat up in the sterno pan it was GONE.  I got some before it was gone and it was slightlt cold and it was DELICIOUS - so try it..

Pretty tasty, but I find that it works best to double all the ingredients, except the pasta -- use about 3/4 lb. of linguine. Also leave out the salt -- the bacon makes it salty enough. Use just a little of the bacon drippings to saute the onion and garlic. Finally, toss in the bacon and cheese just before serving.

Good recipe, with some changes. I prefer using yellow onion to the green, and chop up an entire cup. Also use 1 cup chopped fresh basil.
It is a bit light on the tomatoes, but instead of adding more, try whisking in 1/2 cup heavy cream for a deliciously smooth Parma Rosa type of sauce. I don't feel this recipe needs any salt at all. Thank you!

This was delicious, although I only gave it 4 stars due to the fact that the way the recipe is written, you really don't end up with ANY sauce.  I had to double up on the sauce ingredients (with lots of extra garlic) and I even cut back on the pasta.  Will definitely make again though.  Oh I also used only a small amount of the bacon drippings, NO WAY you need all of that to saute.  And I was also a little upset as there is no directions on WHAT TO DO WITH THE BACON.  Is it supposed to be incorporated in the pasta/sauce or sprinkled on top with the cheese?  Well anways......mine turned out delish....hope yours does too.

I doubled the sauce as other reviewers did, used a sweet onion instead of green onion, upped the garlic. Awesome dish. Hit with everyone. Even my littlest boy had seconds! EDITED: I make this once a month now as a quick meal. It's become one of our favorites.

We loved this.  Since the first time, I have used two (14.5 oz)cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes and 3/4 lb of peppered bacon.  I use angel hair pasta because we prefer it.  I doubled the other ingredients except for the salt, pepper and parmesan cheese.  Love having lots of sauce with pasta.

I used regular bacon, so I added extra black pepper.  Also, I drained most of the bacon grease, only leaving a film of it in the pan to cook the onion and garlic (this cut the greasiness others mentioned).  Just before serving I added a couple tablespoons of water just to make the dish less dry.  More than 4 servings for us.

This was amazing, I will be making this again for sure, probably this upcoming week. I added the crumbled cooked bacon at the end with the sauce, so the bacon would stay crisp. Excellent recipe, thanks so much!

Made this tonight. Yum. I doubled the recipe for sauce and made another 1/2lb pasta. Drained all but 1-2 tablespoons of drippings from the bacon, added about 1/3 cup of flat leaf parsley and 2 cans chopped clams. Really good, thanks!

I thought that it was pretty good, thanks! I loved that it was cheap, flavorful, and super easy to make. To be honest, I actually preferred it without the extra bacon on top (better as a snack while cooking or for something else), as it ruined the balance of the flavors. I also added a orange pepper, but only because it was in the fridge and needed to be eaten. A nice addition though! Thanks again!

Was a delicious and easy recipe! I took the advice of others and molded the recipe a little bit. I added lots of garlic and used fresh basil. I didn't have peppered bacon so I used normal bacon, lightly drizzled with olive oil and lots of pepper - so delicious! I used one can of diced tomatos and one can of whole italian peeled tomatos! I let it simmer for 15-20 minutes with the bacon and added some sliced field mushrooms for extra texture. Delicious, smokey and a crowd pleaser!

EXCELLENT!!! I added a bit of chicken broth to the mixture and I also used fresh basil, and spaghetti. It was a wonderful, quick meal that I will be making again and again.

This is such a great dish.  I added wayyyy more garlic than was called for, but that's my family--we are garlic lovers.  I also halved the amount of of pasta and used whole-grain.  AND I used turkey bacon, which rendored very little fat....just enough to cook the garlic.  It was healthier, but (I believe) just as tasty.  My 8 year old asked me if we could make this EVERY night...and she is a very very picky eater.

This was a great recipe and easy to make.  I don't agree with the other posters who thought it needed more sauce.  I coated the pasta with olive oil then tossed the linguine in the sauce.  Yum!

This is a terrific recipe! My family absolutely loved it. I took this recipe and mixed with the recipe by Carol Spradling (Cajun Chicken Pasta). Basically the same recipe but adding chicken and tomatoes. My husband has always enjoyed my cooking but he said I outdid myself this time! This will definately be a keeper.

This was really delicious--a nice change from the usual pasta sauce.  I followed other reviewers suggestion to add cream, and it finished it off very nicely.  Try this--you'll love it.

My hubby and I really enjoyed this recipe- with a few changes.  I substituted 1/4 lb of thick cut prosciutto for the bacon since it has more meat per slice and is less fatty.  I sauteed the diced meat, green onion and garlic in a little canola oil rather than in bacon grease.  Also, I added 8 to 10 ounces half and half to the sauce, which made it creamy, but not too thick.

7:30 PM, babysitting the siblings, and not a clue what to make for dinner. This recipe saved my life! Or at least the kids' stomachs -- they ate the entire plate in 10 minutes!

This was very tasty and easy to make. I used fresh tomatos as I didn't have any canned, regular bacon, and no basil, and it was still stellar. The fat content is a little scary, but the taste makes it worthwhile!

I did add a bit of chicken stock to make the sauce go a bit further, as suggested by another reviewer. You could probably use water and tomato sauce if you prefer. I find it helpful to cut up the bacon with scissors before hand when making these types of recipes. You could even do this in the morning to save on prep time at dinner if you're rushed. I'm sure I'll be making this again... thanks for the recipe Kathy!!!

This was okay... I tripled the sauce which was fine (not too much sauce) but didn't triple the pasta or the bacon.  Thing is, the bacon kind of got lost in in the sauce and yes, it did get soggy.  I probably won't make this again ... but if I did I'd definitely hold off putting the bacon in the sauce and instead let everyone sprinkle it on their individual plates.  That way you'd actually taste the bacon, and it wouldn't be so soggy.

Excellent Pasta! I normally cook for 6 - 8 people every night so I upped the servings to 9 for this but used 3 cans of Garlic, Basil, Oregano Tomatoes and allow it to simmer closer to 20 min. This gives it a deeper flavor and thickens the sauce alot. I can see us having this once a month. It's really good. Thank you for sharing!

Excellent!  I did as others have said and discarded most of the bacon drippings, just using the thin layer that clung to the pan to saute the onion.  I left out the garlic because my father-in-law is allergic.  This is a super easy meal that my whole family loved.

Fantastic combination of flavors.  If you don't have pepper bacon, regular would also work.  Everyone in my family enjoyed this easy and delicious pasta recipe.

This was so good! I loved the combo of the bacon and tomatoes with the pasta - it's a nice change from plain old spaghetti. The whole family liked it!

This was a perfect example of an Italian pasta dish.  The sauce was light and the pasta stood out.  When cooking Italian and needing extra moisture to make the sauce coat the noodle, you simply add a ladle of the pasta water.  This is not like the Americanized pasta where the sauce sits on top of the pasta.  A really tasty dish. Thanks for submitting it!

I'm only giving this dish 3 stars because the first time I made it it was lacking and I had made it according to the recipe. The second time I made it I used the recipe as a guide and made it my own. Second time around I used 1/2 lb peppered bacon, drained off grease, 1 box bowtie pasta (prepared), 2 cans italian diced tomatoes, 2 cans petite diced tomatoes, 2 Tbsp. dried basil, 1/2 cup fat free half and half, 1 tsp. onion powder, cracked black pepper to taste and a clove of fine chopped garlic. Everyone had seconds the second time around (no one cared for it that much the first time I made it) and there was just enough left for my hubby to take to work for lunch. Much better reception for it when I changed it up.

I have made this recipe 2 times, and both times it was GREAT!!.  I used 1 and 1/2 lbs peppered bacon, drained off most of the bacon grease. Then added the 1 bunch of chopped green onion , garlic and 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  Sauteed for a short while, then added back the bacon and the cooked pasta.  Topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese.  My family loves this dish!!

This turned out great! I couldn't find peppered bacon so I just added extra pepper.  I also added about 1/4c. chicken broth per some of the other reviewers and simmered for about 10mins.

This was great! I took the advice of another reviewer & put 1/2 cup whipping cream in with the sauce & used less pasta than 16oz. I will cut back the salt next time. The bacon & parm cheese add a lot of salt. Definatly try the cream!

I've made this one several times. Instead of canned tomatoes I used fresh diced also I oven roasted a few Roma tomatoes with garlic and diced them as well. This recipe is fine the way it is but I thought it would taste better with fresh ingredients. I have given this recipe out countless times. Everyone loves it!

I made this last night and it was good a few changes I did....I doubled the sauce (as previously suggested) and next time I think I may even add another can of tomatoes to it.  I reduced the amount of bacon grease in it(used about 1/2) and added some canned mushrooms (we just like them).  I also sprinkled in some dried orgeano, rubbed sage, and garlic powder.  Oh and instead of green onions I used a regular onion.  It turned out really well!!! Thanks for the great idea...

Husband loved it! i wasn't exactly sure if the bacon was done enough, a little under cooked gave it more of a hammy texture which was more fitting for the pasta (robust i guess) I also used the thick cut market bacon which takes a bit longer to cook. I'd make it again!

This was awesome.  Like others, had never heard of peppered bacon so ground black pepper on bacon as I browned it.  Did not need salt.  I misread the recipe and added the parmesan to the sauce as it was cooking.  It turned out great.  Fast, easy, inexpensive and delicious.  What more do you want?

Very good pasta recipe.  I used 1 can of stewed tomatoes and put fresh basil on top. I also only used half of the amount of pasta.  After cooking my onion and garlic I deglazed the pan with about 1/4 cup red wine.  I let it reduce and then added the tomatoes and other ingredients.  Also added about 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes.  My favorite pasta recipe!!!!  Very good base

My guy loved this stuff. He had a really bad headcold but this really cheered him up!  I added 4 cloves of garlic because its good for colds. I think 2 cans of diced tomatoes could stretch the sauce further otherwise don't change a thing!

I made this exactly as shown, and it's o.k.  I think next time I will use fresh tomatoes and saute mushroom slices with the onion and garlic.  I would also like to toss some peas into dish.

I thought this was pretty good. I halved the pasta and only used about 4 slices of regular bacon because that's all I had. Also, I only had a can of Rotel tomatoes with mild green chilis -which gave it a really good kick.  I also added a handful of sliced fresh mushrooms and tossed the bacon back in the pan with the sauce about 45 seconds before serving. I topped it with fresh grated parm cheese and a side of garlic bread, it was tasty.

good idea to put bacon in the sauce. i wish i would have used 2 cans of diced tomatoes (italian flavoring). instead, i added almost a jar of spaghetti sauce. i added chicken, but then i remembered that i don't like chicken in tomato sauce.

Our whole family loves this.  Could use a little more flavor to stick to the pasta..havent quite figures out our taste of what we want..but we have made this a few times and really like it.  Drained the bacon to 1/2 the fat amount...didnt effect the end result.  like i said we will try different herbs and spices to add a little to it..but other than that we all love it...not usual in our home  :)

My husband and I love this recipe! We are from the south and love dishes w/ tons of flavor; and the flavor in this dish is different but oh so good! It's easy and doesn't cost alot - A plus(+) for young couples w/ small budgets! Loved It!! I read alot of the reviews on adding this or that... the main recipe is great! But I did try it w/ more garlic and more diced tomatoes. Great too! Food is always an experiment and u can always make changes to make it ur own. But the Original Recipe is Awesome!!

Fantastic! My boyfriend and son loved this dish. I added a little fat free half and half to make it a bit creamier. It also tasted great the next day as leftovers, heated with a little more half and half. I will definitely be making this again!

I made this recipe last night. Followed the recipe, except we used whole wheat linguine. I was going to use the suggestion of another reviewer to put in some cream into the sauce, but had none, so I used a little sour cream. Can I just say that I LOVE THIS RECIPE??? Excellent, and easy. The best of both words. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Oh my -- this was fabulous!  Actually had all of the ingredients on hand.  OK, I did alter it a bit - not because I'm all that creative, but didn't want to use all of the bacon grease so substituted olive oil.  And, had a can of mushrooms - threw them it.  And, put a few ounces of white wine in, as I was having some for din din.  My husband said it was one of THE best pastas I have ever made.  Oh yeah, didn't have pepper bacon, used regular bacon, but ground in a lot of pepper. Very, very easy recipe and can be served to company for a certain homerun!

This was very good.  It was a different taste and the more I ate, the more I liked it.  I did not find it greasy.  I poured off all but a couple of tablespoons of the bacon grease and I don't think anything was missed.  I also used fire roasted tomatos.  We will have this again.

Great recipe! I got "delicious" on this one! No leftovers too (which is a pretty rare occasion in my house)!! With that said, I made a few alterations, based on other reviews and based on what I had available. Ingredient changes: used only 1/2 lb pasta, used regular bacon, used only 9 oz diced tomatoes (had used only 1/3 of a can earlier in the week, so I had 2/3 left that I wanted to use up). Method changes: Only reserved 1-2 Tbl of bacon grease to cook in, added about 1/4 or 1/3c of chicken stock when adding the tomatoes (otherwise, would not have been enough sauce even with halving the pasta), and I added a bit of flour (the kind you use to make gravy) to help it thicken.  I will be making this often! Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent dish.  After reading the reviews from others, I integrated a little of this and a little.  I only kept two tablespoons of the bacon drippings so it wasn't at all greasy, added red pepper flakes while cooking the green onion and garlic.  Increased the onion and garlic, simmered the tomato mixture for about 15 minutes and tossed the chopped peppered bacon and cheese just before serving. I also increased the amount of diced tomatoes from 1 to 1 1/2 cans. Will make this again and again.

the bacon or at least the grease is one of the key things that makes this taste sooo good.. Of course the garlic adds to it as well.  So simply to make and so good in the summer for something light to eat.

I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about all the bacon but I was very pleasantly surprised as the flavor was excellent!  Used regular bacon and heavily peppered it as it cooked.  Also used the diced tomatoes with garlic and onion.  There were no leftovers here!

I had to make my kids stop at three helpings - definitely a huge hit.  I used a medium yellow onion, added a little sugar, twice the tomatoes, and drained most of the bacon grease off.  This is a great pantry meal, for when you didn't plan ahead.  The flavors hold up well to whole wheat pasta (I think penne works better than a long noodle).

Love it. This is so good. I must admit when I was making the sauce it was not appealing to me but when it all came together it was delicious. I used microwave bacon just to save time. Used olive oil to saute onions and garlic and I added pepper since the bacon was not peppered. I also added parmesan cheese to the sauce rather than just the top. Outstanding sauce but for 16oz pasta you must double it. I doubled the sauce and it still could have used more in my opinion. I will definately make this again.

This recipe is wonderful!  We doubled the recipe and the only real change we made was to add a can of chicken broth to make more of a sauce.  We let the sauce simmer a while and then added the bacon in for about 5 minutes and that was all it needed.  The sauce was light with a wonderful smoky flavor from the bacon.  Easy and soooo good!!

My husband and I really like this pasta! I used bowtie pasta instead, and sauted some mushrooms in with the sauce. I also used only half of the noodles, 7 slices of bacon, and used olive oil instead of the bacon grease. Turned out awesome!! Will make this again, for sure.

I took the advice of others on the site and added 1 cup heavy cream, 1 diced onion, 1 cup grated parmesan cheese, and drained as much of the grease as possible. 

It turned out really good, it had a great flavor and was easy to cook, however the bacon was just too much, and I'm a bacon lover. Despite the easy of cooking, the excellent flavor, I doubt I will cook this again. It has a lot of light healthy ingredients weighted down by all that bacon. 

this would be five star with chicken.

Super fast and easy!  I followed the directions exactly except I doubled everythng but the pasta.  My husband said it was restaurant quality.  I think next time I will try it with italian sausage rather than bacon and use olive oil to saute instead of pan drippings.  I might also add some fresh mushrooms as others have suggested.  Either way, we liked this well enough to serve it again.  My husband especially liked how fast it was ready.  It's great when your menfolk are hungry and you're running late in the kitchen.

OUTSTANDUNG! After the bacon was rendered out I cooked some diced chicken in the bacon fat and removed. Sweated a small diced onion for a couple of minutes till soft then deglazed the pan and all the brown bacon goodies with chicken broth. Added remaining items along with the chicken and pasta. Tossed with fresh basil and cheese. It was a big hit!  Thanks.

This was a great meal - such flavor!  I used the entire pack of bacon and two cans of diced tomatoes that already had the garlic and basil in it so I didn't use the basil but still added the garlic.  Wow, it was great!  I would serve this for company anytime.

This recipe is SOOOO good!  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and a small can of tomato sauce.  I also did not have basil so I used Italian seasoning instead.  This seemed to make the perfect amount of sauce for that much pasta, as we like our pasta "saucy" as well.  I served it with parmesan shreds, which you can find in the shredded cheese section (this tastes much better than the powdery Kraft kind) and I also sprinkled the bacon on top.  It was very filling, flavorful and my husband called dibs on the leftovers.  Thank you so much for sharing a wonderful recipe.  Oh... I also added more garlic, YUM!

OK, so I know I'm one of the few dissenters on this recipe. My wife made a half-recipe of this, leaving out the green onions. She also used thick-sliced bacon and added ground pepper to the mix instead of peppered bacon. Maybe we just haven't gotten on the "bacon-in-everything" wagon, but this tasted strange. Bacon grease and pasta just didn't seem to go together (and she used about half the bacon grease to saute the tomatoes, garlic and basil). We ate it anyway (kinda got better with time, I guess) and both wound up with upset stomachs all evening. We do normally eat healthy with no added fat when practical, so maybe that's it. Should've read the reviews which said "use just a little bit of bacon grease". This is definitely on the "Fail" list of trial recipes in our home. Sorry!

I doubled the sauce, after reading suggestions from other reviewers.  The directions were not clear as to what to do with the bacon; so I added it on top along with the Parmesan cheese.  While this was a very quick dinner to prepare;  it did not go over very well with the taste buds of those eating it.    Love to try new things, but this was not for us.  Thanks for posting, dalgal.

After the bacon was done cooking, we added peeled shrimp to the bacon grease.  The shrimp absorbed the bacon flavor and added more protein to the dish. The other thing we added was crushed red pepper to the sauce as it simmered for a little bit of a kick.  It turned out really well

This was fantastic.  My husband loved this and said it tasted like a meal you get in a restaurant.  I added fresh asparagus and fresh mushrooms to increase the veggies.  It was great!  Next time maybe I'll add chicken too to make this meal a little more hearty.  Great!!!

I really liked this recipe, but the pepper from the bacon made it a bit too spicy for my husband. I will probably make this again but only use a bit of peppered bacon and either regular bacon or Italian sausage.

WOW....I LOVED this recipe... with several modifications.....I used regular thick cut bacon and sprinkled with fresh ground pepper. I removed bacon from pan , then sauteed scallions and garlic.  I added TWO cans of fire roasted tomatoes and used italian seasoning  instead of just oregano.  I let this cook down for a few minutes then added TWO cans of chopped clams with the juice and let it simmer for a few minutes more.   I put on top of DReamfields Linguini and topped with shaved parmasean............I cannot wait to have the leftovers tonight!!!

This recipe was easy and fantastic!  I made it last night and my daughters loved it.  Have the leftovers for lunch. The only thing I changed was the amount of tomatoes.  I put in a 28oz. can - only because I love tomatoes.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I used this dish as a base to make a more substantial variation. I added chicken that I had marinated in balsamic dressing and baked in the oven and sliced. I also used plain bacon (all I saw at the store) and omitted the extra salt. After the bacon cooked I left enough grease in the pan to sautee 4 cloves of garlic (love the stuff) and added a can of diced tomatoes that had onions in it (saved me a step). I let that simmer for a bit, stirring up the bits of bacon and then I added a bag of spinach and let it wilt. I put my pasta, bacon, parmesan cheese, chicken in a large bowl and added some balls of  fresh mozzarella  then topped with the sauce and tossed it all together. The mozzarella melted slightly and all of the flavors blended together amazingly. Delicious!!! Will definitely be making again.

Extremely tasty, but as written, there is not enough sauce, even for an "Italian" dish. (Americans tend to have more sauce in their pasta dishes, whereas Italians use just enough to coat the pasta and no more. Typically, anyway.) Double everything but the pasta and salt (unless your bacon is low/no sodium, in which case you may want to double that, too) and it's perfect. Don't forget to stir the bacon in at the same time as the pasta! Also, we tried topping individual bowls with different cheeses. Parm is good, but a good feta is awesome.

i thought this recipe was great!  Changes i made were i used regular thick cut bacon & just added ALOT of pepper,  half a yellow onion chopped, i used the tomatoes with basil, but still used the dried basil as well. I also used one roasted red bell pepper and about a tsp red pepper flakes. Sauteed the onion & garlic until translucent then added the bell pepper for a min before adding the tomatoes, 1/2c. heavy cream and seasoning. I also used fettucini pasta since thats what i had and for the oil in the pot i used some of the bacon grease to help flavor the noodles :)

This was very good and different.  I too could not find peppered bacon, so I bought thick sliced bacon then rubbed it with cracked pepper.  Worked fine.  I also used two cans of tomatoes to make more sauce and we like a little sugar to take away the acidity...so I added 1Tbsp. sugar.  I might have been missing something, but I don't believe the original recipe indicated when to put the bacon in, it just said "drain, reserving drippings and set aside", but as indicated by others, I added the bacon just before serving.  I definately would make this again.

Wanted to make this recipe but only had pancetta on hand so used that instead of the bacon and it turned out just delicious.  I enjoyed the sauce as it is a nice light sauce...great for summer.  Next time I will add toasted pine nuts.  Yummy!

So I made it almost exactly as listed but I did follow other reviewers suggestions and ended up making about half the linguine and the full amount of the sauce. I'm happy I did, if I had halved the sauce too, i would have ended up with way to little.  I love sauce :)  I also omited the salt and it definitely didnt need it.  All that being said I absolutely loved this recipe!  I've had it in my recipe box for 2 years but never made it because my husband doesn't like anything w/chunks of tomato in it, so this week he worked 2nd shift and I jumped on the chance to make this.  This will now be one of my go to recipes when my husband isn't around.  It's also extremely easy and quick to make which is always a plus in my book since I work fulltime and have a very active 3 yr old at home.

I read the reviews before making this recipe. I used half of the pasta that it called for and doubled the garlic. Could have drained some of the bacon grease of, but my husband and I thought it was delicious.

If I could give this 3.5 stars I would. I think it has the potential to be a great recipe with a few tweaks. After reading and combining a few reviews, I used 3/4 lb. of bacon, cooked over low heat (cooks more evenly that way), 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1/2 a white onion, 1 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup of half and half. Oh, I also drained off all but a tablespoon or two of the bacon grease. Since the sauce was thin I added a few scoops of the starchy pasta water to the sauce to help it stick to the pasta. I didn't like the cream addition, personally, and I wish I had've put a second can of diced tomatoes in, but I didn't have it on hand. I'll keep playing with this recipe until I get it right. It reminded me of bruschetta combined with pasta and bacon... and who doesn't love that?

Incredibly good and easy, too!  Made as listed but only used 1/2 the linguine and it was lots for 3 people.  I couldn't find peppered bacon so used regular bacon and sprinkled it liberally with fresh ground pepper after it was cooked and drained.  Will make again and again.

Couldn't find peppered bacon either so just used pepper.  I let my 16 year old son make it, the recipe was easy for him.  We also used about a half-box of broth and then about a cup of fat free half&half for more sauce.  Oh and a 28 oz can of tomatoes.  Yum yum!

Very quick and easy. Good flavors. Did not use the bacon grease, instead used a little olive oil. I also used 28oz can of diced tomatoes and more green onion and garlic and added bacon just before serving to keep it crisp.

Good taste, but sauce is too runny and there's not enough.  It's missing something that could thicken up the sauce.... We added peas to give it some color- good addition.

Was disappointed, thought this would be much better flavor.  Would add a lot more garlic next time & green onion too.  Also would use fresh basil.

This was fantastic! I did make a few changes: 1) I only used 2 tblsp of bacon grease for the sauce. The second tblsp I added for taste. 2) I didn't have any green onion so I added about 1/2 cup of red onion and about 5 small cloves of garlic and 3) I added 1 tsp of the bacon grease to the pasta water along with the salt and pepper. I'll be making this again for sure!

Awesome with some of the changes others have suggested - using the cream in the sauce (or half and half) - ommitted the basil and used the seasoned canned tomatoes and added more garlic (we love garlic) - the whole family enjoyed the pasta.  Will become part of the monthly rotation.

Also,used petite diced tomatoes. Look forward to making and serving this again.

I cut the amount of bacon in half and discarded the drippings, using olive oil to saute instead.  Served on whole wheat linguini.  Very easy to put together and will definitely make again.

Pretty good, the recipe called for 16 oz of pasta and I used 13 oz and their still didn't seem to be enough sauce for my tastes. I will increase some of the measurements next time.

I give it 5 for the taste - my guy really loved it. But I give it a 1 on the way to cook this.  First of all - I added the bacon at the very end - the recipe just calls for you to set it aside.  I also agree with so many others - I only used 8 oz. of pasta and the sauce just covered it - I can't see how the recommended amount of sauce could cover a pound of pasta.  I will make this again but I will keep this in my notes for the future.  Thanks submitter.

This recipe is okay, nothing amazing. I felt that it was lacking something, though certainly not the fat, because its a heart attack on plate if you use all those bacon drippings.

Delicious! Made it for a family dinner and everyone thought it was hearty and tasty.  I did add some sliced mushrooms after the green onions and I also put a can of tomato paste in after the diced tomatoes.  We finished it all so next time I will have to double to recipe to ensure that we have left-overs.

I found this recipe disappointing.  It was very bland in flavor.  It mostly tasted like you were eating grease covered noodles.

Very tasty.  I wish it had a bit more of a sauce - I might add some chicken broth next time.  I'll definitely make this again - but not too often, as it's not the healthiest meal.

I added 1 8oz. can tomato sauce, we like our's saucier.  I feel that this recipe needs to be doubled to cover the amount of pasta required.
Taste wise.........WOW!!! all loved it, will be made again and again in this house.  Make it you will be happy.

This was a nice and easy dish to make. I've thought the peppered bacon was a bit spicy and would've preferred to do plain bacon for it, even if I've used one slice. And it didn't mentioned what to do with the bacon in the recipe, other than cooking it in step one. I didn't have any dried basil on hand and used oregano instead. But overall, it was delicious.

I used regular thick cut bacon and added yellow onion, some olive oil, and extra basil to the sauce. The diced tomatoes I used seem to be a mix of diced/crushed so I had a bit more juice, which I preferred. I allowed the sauce to simmer for 15-20 minutes and layered everything: pasta, bacon, sauce, fresh parmesan. It had excellent flavor, as far as I'm concerned.

I've made this many times. I just use regular bacon. I only use half a teaspoon of salt and use a standard yellow onion, if I don't have green onions on hand. It is a family favorite!

I've made this several times now and we really like it a lot. It's so easy to make especially if you do the bacon ahead of time. I dislike making bacon whether it's in the microwave, oven or on the stove top so if I can get that out of the way earlier in the day it's all the easier to make. The first time I made it we found that one can of diced tomatoes was just not suffuient for a pound of linguine so I always use 2 cans now and fresh basil if I have some. It's good with dried basil also but fresh makes it even better. This one is a keeper!

I used peppered bacon from Swiss Colony (not alot of bacan grease after) and followed the rest of the directions exactly.  It was so good and oddly light tasting with all that bacon.

This was a super easy recipe that has a lot of flavor. I followed it to a "T" except didn't have linguine so used thin spaghetti instead. My husband said he would like more tomatoes next time so I may try 2 cans of diced tomatoes.

I initially thought that I would end up with too much bacon to pasta - interestingly, the amount of bacon could have been doubled along with everything else.  Despite adding 8 oz of fresh mushrooms and 2/3 oz of fresh chopped basil, I still didn't feel like there was enough topping to the amount of pasta.  This recipe needs some kind of sauce as a base - maybe adding some tomato paste would have given it more oomph.

I really enjoyed this. The kids, however, did not. They found it too tangy.  I think I should have added more Garlic. I'll make it again, just have to make it on a night when the kids have other plans :)

I took others suggestions to double everything but the pasta and salt, but accidently doubled the salt....so it was too salty. I will make this again and NOT double the salt b/c it would have been great if I hadn't messed it up. :-)  Also put galic powder and onion powder in the sauce.

We loved this! (With a few changes) Increased the onion to one yellow onion and replaced the basil with 1/4 cup fresh, chopped cilantro (sauteed with the onion and garlic). Yum!

I followed the advice of reviewers and doubled the amount of tomato and garlic. I also added half and half because it was needing more liquid and extra parmesan cheese. Very tasty and easy.

My husband actually made this and I gave instructions on how to do it (he NEVER cooks) Like some of the others, I used white onion (as that's what I had) and used 1/2 cup double cream. I also put in a cube an oxo chicken cube, doubled the basil and galic. This was gorgeous!!! We are definitely making this again. I know lots of changes seem to be made, but this recipe is fabulous! My husband, who hates pasta that isn't in a super thick sauce, nor does he like reheated pasta, ate his entire plate (which was full) and ate the leftovers for lunch the next day!  Definitely a keeper!!!! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very simple but excellent.  Had a hard time finding peppered bacon but finally got some at Wal-Mart.  I did double the tomatoes and used Italian style.  Also used regular onions, about 1/2 cup chopped.   Added 3/4 c. half and half.

This was wonderful and my husband enjoyed it.  He never likes much of anything, so it was a treat to serve him something he said was sooooo good. I used angel hair diabetic pasta as he likes a thinner pasta.  Made no difference with the dish.  We will have a lot of this.

Was great when it was hot, but I didn't care for the cold leftovers. Next time I think I will keep the sauce and noodles separate. I didn't use onion (allergic) but used half an orange and yellow pepper instead. Also added one 8oz can tomato sauce in addition to the diced tomatoes (no salt added can) to create more sauce and added some red pepper flakes (1/4tsp) to give it some heat. Didn't have basil, so I used Italian Seasoning instead. And I agree with other reviewers, you don't need all the bacon grease (maybe half) and def don't add more salt. The bacon makes it salty.

This was delicious!  After reading other reviews, I used half the amount of linguine called for, and actually I could have used more.  I also added maybe 1/4 cup half and half, the sauce was so rich and flavorful that you don't have to 'cover' the linguine with it.  As for the salt, I think it depends on the brand of bacon, how much bacon & bacon drippings you decide to use.  So simmer for a few minutes and then taste to see if salt is needed.  Great recipe even cold the next day!

Made this and it was good.  However, after cooking the bacon and setting it aside, it was never mentioned again.  I put the bacon in about 5 minutes before serving

Excellent! However, I also doubled everything except the Bacon and Pasta. Had some fresh Basil so I chopped it.  I deglazed the pan after browning the bacon to keep  from getting to much pepper

My husband absolutely loved this dish.  I cut the amount of pasta in half because it was only the two of us and used italian diced tomatoes, otherwise everything was the same.  My husband wants me to add shrimp to this dish and serve it for his birthday!

This was sooo yummy!  I used 3 large bulbs of garlic, and a 28oz can of diced tomatoes and lots of fresh basil, cause i had it.  There was lots of sauce using the larger can of tomatoes.  I let it reduce down longer than it says in the recipe.  Very simple to make!  It got great reviews by my parents who 'happened' to be around.  I will definitly make this again!

this was excellent but it seems i always tweek recipes a little to my liking or to what's on hand.  i used regular bacon, about 1 cup of red onion instead of green, got rid of 2/3 of the bacon fat, added about 1/2 cup of frozen peas to the sauce and about 1/2 cup of the pasta water as well.  I didn't add any extra salt and stirred in about 1 tablespoon of fresh basil at the end and used about 1/2 cup of parmesan.  I also used large shell and wagon wheel pasta together.  My husband and picky 16 year old son loved it.  I will definetly make this again.

Just finished eating this for dinner and thought it was very easy to make and excellent. Like others I drained all but a couple TBS of the bacon grease and doubled everything but the pasta. I'll be making this again for sure.

This recipe was good alone, but l made a few minor changes that made it even better- taste-wise and health-wise.    l first sauteed the chopped bacon and then drained it leaving only 3 Tbsp of grease, l added chopped vidalia onion and let that saute for about 5 minutes (until soft), then l added Frozen spinach and a the can of chopped tomato with juice- this was enough water to cook the frozen bag of spinach.  l then let the onion, tomato, hot pepper flakes and spinach cook for about 7 minutes (until the spinach was fully cooked).  After the pasta was cooked and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil, l added the cooked bacon pieces to the pan with spinach, tomatoes etc. so they would stay crisp.    It came out WONDERFUL with a sprinkle of fresh parm. cheese.  This dish tastes wonderful without bacon- if you're worried about cholesterol.

Great and easy!  Used 6 medium/large whole tomatoes instead of the canned tomatoes.  Also substituted white onions instead of the green and added mushrooms.  Turned out great.

This is a take on an old 'po' folks' recipe my mother served us 60 years ago (& her mother probablly 30 years earlier) ... bacon/onion/tomatoes/pasta ... all the poor could afford. Cheese if we were lucky. I lived on this (along with bacon grease gravy over bread) ... it's good hot/cold/5 days later ... kept us alive for many years...:-)

this was amazing! I added some chopped artichoke hearts and I think clams or mussels would top it off perfectly if I had it on hand.  I took out about 3/4 of the bacon grease though and added a little olive oil to make it a little healthier... I put the crispy bacon bits on the side because it's good with out the bacon too

The first time I made this it was very good and went over well.  I too like a lot of sauce so I diced and cooked a pound of Peppered Bacon, it cooks down a lot. I added a 10 oz can of Ro-Tel and one can of diced tomatoes with Jalapeno.

My husband and I enjoyed it.  Next time I will drain off more of the bacon grease, omit the salt and use regular bacon.  I don't think peppered bacon is a must.  I enjoyed it cold too.

We thought it was very good, but needed something!  I had peeled and cut up some fresh tomatoes and had frozen them before they got too ripe, so I used those instead of the canned ones.  I believe the problem was that it needed salt, which the canned ones would have had!  I added the bacon just before serving also.  It was even better the next day I thought!  I added a little bit of butter before I heated up the leftovers and didn't use any bacon.  It was really good!!

For something so simple, this was really good! Followed the other reviewers and left only a Tbsp or so of dripping in the pan. Used normal bacon, fresh tomatoes, and upped the amount of onion and basil. Absolutely delicious! Served with Pork Chops Stuffed with Smoked Gouda and Bacon from this site.

Not enough "stuff" everything was lost in all the pasta. Flavor was good, when you did get the bacon, and onion and tomatoes in a bite it was even better. Not sure that I'll make it that often, wow all the bacon grease!!! I have a feeling tomorrow it will really be tasty.

This recipe is outstanding. The only change I would make is to scale up the amount of sauce we made to maybe double or 1 and a half times what it was. Other then that, just following the recipe it turned out great.

This recipe was so-so.  There really is no "sauce" so unless you add more liquid, the noodles will turn out pretty dry.

I really enjoyed this, though (like other reviewers) will next time double the sauce and leave the pasta the same.

I made this and thought it was just allright. I'm glad I didn't use all of the salt; I only used half the amount called for and it was still too salty and I had to add sugar.

This dish was a little on the greasy side for our taste, so I would recommend leaving out the bacon drippings.  Also, draining the tomatoes would have also made a good difference.  Otherwise, it was rather good, much to my daughter's surprise!

This is good, easy stuff.  I fixed it one night when I didn't want to go to the store and I had the ingredients for this.  Not the best pasta ever, but pretty darn good.

Everyone I have ever made this for was absolutely in love.  I like to throw in a little red onion that I caramelize and some tomato sauce to thicken it up along with some extra garlic, well since I put garlic in just about everything.

I served this dish to some friends and my boyfriend and it was a hit. My boyfriend is allergic to dairy so I just left off the parmasean cheese and let people apply their own if they wanted. This was a great dairy-free option that everyone can enjoy.

I had no plan for dinner and all these items in my pantry / refrig.  Boy, am I glad I did!  My husband had 2 big helpings and just raved.  I felt like I was having take-out!  A little work for lots of reward.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is great! I followed a lot of the suggestions posted by others, and now I have a new favorite fast meal. Like others, I doubled the tomatoes, used more yellow onion and garlic, and used fresh basil. I also used only a couple of the tablespoons of bacon fat to saute the onion and garlic. Thank you!

Yum, yum.  REALLY good!  No, you don't need all the extra bacon grease (we're active health nuts and would NOT do this on a regular basis) but once in a while won't kill you.  Leave ALL the drippings in - you'll like it much better!  Just don't eat it all the time. . .

This was really good.  We love garlic so I added a ton of it, along with some white wine while simmering the tomatoes.  Didn't have peppered bacon but that was fine, just sprinkled a good amount on while frying.  I also used regular yellow onion instead of green.  Yummy!  Thanks for the idea!

This was great. I gave it four stars because I didnt follow exactly.  I had to adjust for what I had.  I used cubed pancetta, and tossed in a ziploc bag with two to three tablespoons of black pepper.  I omitted the basil used two cans of garlic and basil diced tomatoes (as suggested by others) and I used three cloves of garlic instead of two (I love garlic). I agree more tomatoes for more sauce.  I may add a splash of cream and some chicken broth next time to stretch the sauce further. Definatley a keeper!

Quick, easy, DELISH! I drained away some bacon drippings before cooking onions, added some chicken stock for sauce but followed recipe otherwise.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars if that was available.  Will make again.  Thanks for recipe!

Our Creative Memories consultant prepared this dish for our Friday nite crop party.  It was great!  It is a very quick and easy meal to prepare.  I think it feeds more than it says it will.  I joined the allrecipes web site because of this recipe.  Now I'm hooked.

This was great!  It is a bit greasy, but well worth the calories.  I didn't use real onion, just sprinkled some minced and powder into the tomatoes while cooking.

This was a great meal & very easy to make.  I added some veg (bell pepper & carrots) and also some chile powder for a bit of a kick.  As suggested by others I used regular bacon as that's what I had.  Served with garlic bread & it was great - will definitely make again.  In fact I'm having some left-overs for lunch today!

Good flavor.  Could've used more tomatoes...I used 2 cans to make 6 servings and could've had another half or whole can.  I sprinkled crumbled bacon and cheese on the top when done.  Great.

This was so easy and sooo good.  What a wonderful change from your standard marinara sauce.  The taste was restaurant quality.  I also did not use peppered bacon and it was still great.

This was a nice change of pace.  My husband (who is a picky eater) loved it.  I'll make it again.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I used fresh tomatoes and fresh basil.  I will definitely make this dish again.
