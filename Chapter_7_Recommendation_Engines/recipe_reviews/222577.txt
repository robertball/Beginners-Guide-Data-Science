I thought this was a great recipe as is. I have never fried Zucchini before. I did double the recipe because the zucchini I had was huge. Will make again

Extremely Taste-y! I substituted 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead of the vegetable oil.  And I used Fat Free Parm Cheese instead for health reasons.

Yummy, yummy! I put the eggs in one plastic bag and the bread crumb mixture in another. Less mess, less to wash.

My good friend grows  enormous zucchini every year and this year she gave me one that was sixteen inches long and 5.5 pounds. I sliced it lengthwise and cleaned out the the seeds which were the size of pumpkin seeds.  (I should have roasted the seeds but didn't. 

  I found this recipe since I had so much left over after I made 2 large loaves, 2 mini loaves.  I actually omitted the parmesan and replaced it with panko bread crumbs.  I finished them off by sprinkling themimmediately with my homemade cajun /old bay seasoning:  


Cajun seasoning

1 T coarsely cracked whole black pepper.
2 teasopoons sweet paprika.
1 teaspoon dry mustard.
1 teaspoon garlic powder.
1/2 dried sage.
1/4 teaspoon cayenne

I added salt to taste as well 

  My family loved it!!!!

This was delicious. I had no problems with the coating sticking to the zucchini, the whole batch turned out perfectly. The Italian flavor was nice, I will probably experiment with other seasonings to switch things up this zucchini season, but this base recipe needs no changes. Thanks!

This is a tasty recipe and is excellent for using up extra zucchini from the garden. My husband made a yummy mustard dipping sauce for these by mixing Tbls horseradish mustard, 3 Tbls mayo, 1 Tbls regular yellow mustard, 1 tea. habanero hot sauce. Enjoy!!

I had a craving for fried zucchini fries (I sliced them like fries) that I got from a restaurant. I saw that a few posters said it lacked flavor, so I took care to add fresh garlic to the egg wash/mixture and added onion powder to the batter. To really turn up the flavor, without turning up the heat, I sprinkled them with paprika after taking them out of the hot oil. Hubby threatened to eat them all! :) Great, easy recipe!

It's a tasty and crunchy dish with a good flavor, but not over powering. I would put it with tilapia or maybe ever a nice burger.

Awesome! Be sure and drain on paper towels, not a rack or they'll be too greasy, as I discovered. Also I used panko w/ a little Italian seasoning.

My husband and I enjoyed this very much. Ease of prep and the flavor was really good. I was out of garlic, though and I know it would have given this an even better flavor. Will try again!

I started whipping these spears up for our neighbor’s dog’s coronation as the queen of their family. Haha, it was something else! Anyway, I ran into one HUGE problem in my prep. It turned out we were completely out of Parmesan. I didn’t want to go with no cheese so I topped these off with a healthy portion of cottage cheese, one staple I’m never without! Let me tell you, it was a REVELATION. Cottage cheese can simply make any dish a belly buster. These were DELICIOUS!

Just pulled fresh zucchini from our garden and made this.  Used shredded parmesan to top it off at end of frying and was scrumptious

We used horseradish sauce for dipping.  It really added to the taste.  Very good recipe!

The zucchini tasted fine, however almost all of the breading fell off- almost immediately after hitting the pan. Also, the measurements in this recipe are way off. I only used one zucchini, but I had  to use about a cup and a half of breadcrumbs to coat all of the planks. Basically, this recipe just needs a lot of tweaking.

I would totally make this again. I liked the crunchiness of the zucchini. I would fry them for longer though, until a darker brown almost reddish

I made this recipe and was glad I tried it, my husband ate all but 4 pieces.  I used slices instead of spears.  The batter stayed on nicely.  I used part bread crumbs and the Ritz crackers.  I think it made it a little on the sweet side.   The flavor was inviting.     lulusmom

perfect i used grated romano/ parmesan added fresh basil from the garden less garlic & a sprinkle or two of italian seasonings 
I fried it all in a cast iron skillet (from grandma) so it was golden brown & excellent 
this first time i cut thick slabs of zucchini next time i think i will cut them thin like chips ..they got darker & crisper  werent as "soggy" as the thickest slabs but BOTH ways this is a great recipie

I would give this less than the ratting I did, if available. This was the worst recipe I have ever worked with. Perhaps, if it called to bake the zucchini, it may have survived. The egg base did not hold the dried ingredients to the zucchini, so I had a pan of fried dry ingredients and bare zucchini. Thankfully, I tried this with my family first and did not have guests. It will be deleted form my recipe box! Awful!

Coating was tasty but I have to say that 95% of the coating was not on the zucchinis so it sort of defeated the purpose. I washed and dried the zucchinis before dipping in the egg mixture so I'm not quite sure what happened. It was very disappointing and I usually LOVE allrecipes recipes. Any suggestions to how to get the coating to stick to the zucchinis?I'm baffled.

I grew up frying Zucchini and yellow squash. Instead of bread crumbs we use yellow cornmeal. the next time I fry some up I will add the Parmesan cheese and italian seasonings. Nice change!

We had these in a Canadian restaurant over 30 years ago and loved them.
Since coming across this recipe, we are now looking forward to cooking them ourselves

I tried this recipe for the first time.  I received some fresh zucchini from a friends garden.  It was amazing and just the taste that I wanted.  I added a little more spices since I'm from the south. It only added to the recipe but it took nothing from it. Thanks lilcupcake.

This was pretty tasty! I cut the zucchini like fries, next time I think I'll slice, seems like it would be easier to turn in the pan. Both my kids ate this without complaint, so that in itself makes it worth it!
