This is Just what I was looking for! I made these with Polish dogs from Costco and Farmer Johns Steakhouse seasoned bacon. These needed the gourmet buns too! I am a simple girl, mustard, onion, relish is all I need to be a happy camper:))) Little hot peppers included in the happiness. Perfectly DELISH!! THANK YOU Combat Medic!! Keeper no doubt:)

I took the suggestion from another review.  I had my deep fryer on 375 and cooked the hot dogs 3 minutes 20 second.  They came out fantastic.  My autistic son even ate them doing his usual thing of cutting off anything charred.  I ate mine with fresh diced onions and BBQ sauce.  Gave the bacon a smokey flavor. I also used soft French rolls to handle a larger dog and to hold any condiments applied.  served with baked beans and fries. Definitely will make again.

It was so salty it was inedible......used low sodium bacon, low sodium hot dogs.  Somehow it became so salty I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Sorry to say.
