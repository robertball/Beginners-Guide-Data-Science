This is the worst cake I ever tasted.  It tasted like cornbread.  It was too salty and heavy. This is not a good recipe at all.

This is the single worst recipe I've ever gotten from this website - the recipes are usually great.  The cake tasted like badly cooked pancakes.

I made this for my mom for her birthday and now I feel bad because I worked hard on it. I wanted to make my mom a good cake and this was the opposite.

GREAT! After reading all the bad reviews, I was really wary of the recipe but ended up trying it anyway. This is a wonderful cake and I would highly recommend it to anyone!

This cake was a heavier cake like pound cake, but I found it to be the best vanilla cake recipe I have ever made.  You must use cake flour, and you must sift it.  For those who would like it lighter I would suggest maybe using 3 whole eggs instead of 7 egg yolks.  My only addition to this recipe was a 1/4 tsp of lemon extract.  I used a light whipped cream frosting.  It would probably make an excellent Jello cake or used for strawberry shortcake.

This cake turned out great! It didn't taste salty or anything like cornbread, as some of the other reviews stated. It was moist, and had a dense texture and sweet flavour. I put butterscotch pudding between the layers and iced it w/buttercream frosting. Great stuff!

I like this recipe...I use this one whenever I bake my kids birthday cakes. It is quick and easy and the kids like it. I found it a bit too sweet though and I did cut back on a half a cup of sugar.
