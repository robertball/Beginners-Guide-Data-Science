To reduce the "oily" factor, I sliced the salami up and fried it in a pan on medium heat (it makes its own oil, so don't add any).  I added the garlic into this once I saw it was getting crispy and needed only a few more minutes.  I didn't use any butter at all, and only enough oil to lightly coat my pasta so it wouldn't stick.  (maybe 1-2 tbls.)  I also added halved cherry tomatoes from my garden.  It was delicious, and not greasy at all.

This was AWESOME!  Usually I prefer to try a recipe exactly as it's written before fiddling with it, but I found this recipe while trying to avoid a trip to the grocery store, so I used what I had on hand.

Instead of green onions, I used a small yellow onion, minced, and a scant 1/2 tsp. chili powder substituted for the cayenne.  I also cut back on the butter and used the cheap canister parmesan rather than fresh grated; however, I don't think these changes altered the character of the dish.

Perfect for a quick and flavorful weeknight dinner!

Edited to update: I still make this fairly often. I never add salt (there's enough in the pasta and salami), and I usually leave out the butter. Olive oil seems essential to me, but I think using cotto salami rather than hard salami makes it less greasy.

I  use this recipe a lot. I have made my own adjustments. I don't think anyone wants to hear them. This is a great tasting dish, that is somewhat healthy.

Tasty, easy. A good way to use up salami. I think my salami was the soft kind, not the hard, but it came out fine. I can see where some people might find it greasy--I think you could cut back a bit on the oil without problem. Perhaps also next time I will try heavily salting the pasta when I cook it, so I don't end up putting extra salt on top of the already salty salami.   Update: Made this again, and I took another reviewer's advice and fried the salami, then used the salami grease to fry onion, etc. Came out a lot less greasy. I didn't add any oil or butter, and it was fine, although if you wish, you could add a bit at the end.

Overall, we liked this, although by the end of the meal the greasiness got a bit over-powering from the salami coupled with the sauce. The flavors were good, though, and the peas were a nice addition. It made for a pretty presentation. We will probably make this again and just cut back a little on the salami. I might even throw in some black olives and a diced fresh tomato.

This is a great quick dish. Because some others said it was a bit greasy, we cut down on the oil/butter - for two people we only used about 2 TBL oil and no butter. We also cooked the salami ahead of time, which made it crispy, which was a nice touch. We only cooked the peas for the last 3 minutes with the pasta, otherwise I think they would have been overcooked. This is a great tasting dish that is easy and I think it would be easy to add/sub different veggies depending on what you have on hand. I think next time I will add corn.

I loved this recipe!  I used pecorino romano instead of parmesan, which was delicious!

I love this!  I changed nothing about it, and I thought it was perfect.  Much spicier than I expected.. which is a good thing!  Yes, it is very greasy, but sometimes you're just in the mood for that.  In fact (and you all might get on me for saying this), due to how greasy this dish is, I might think it's the perfect hangover food!  Either way, though, I thought this was delicious and will 100% make it again.

This was very quick and delicious.  I used farfalle pasta instead.  Next time I might add some mushrooms.

Easy, definately! Unfortunately, it was unbelievably greasy. The salami & grease overpowered the entire dish. You could not taste the cheese at all-I even tried to add an extra 1/2c of an Italian blend cheese & still couldn't taste it. We all liked the addition of the peas. I'm really glad I tried it but probably won't make again:(

We thought this was really good! I didn't make any drastic changes, but I did change it up slightly. First off, I used mini farfalle pasta. I chopped the salami into small pieces because I was feeding a toddler and for more even distribution. I melted the butter in a pan and added the salami, vidalia onion (I had no green onions) and the garlic and cooked that until the onion was tender. I used steamfrsh peas, so I nuked them and added them to the salami/onion mixture and heated through. I added the cooked pasta a nice splash of extra virgin olive oil, a little salt, pepper, a dash of cayenne (again, I was feeding a toddler), and about 1/2 cup parmesan cheese. At the table we added extra parm. I will be making this again, and I may sub bacon for the salami next time, just to see how it turns out! Thanks for posting. :)

This was very tasty. I left the 1/4 oil out and cooked all in a non-stick frypan. I made a wee red wine sauce to go over it instead of oil. All yum flavours.

This was so tasty. Salami is a favourite goto snack in our fridge for my daughter. Had not added it to pasta before. Made a few adjustments: used a chopped white onion, added diced pepper and courgette, a few chilli flakes, dash of lemon juice, only a tiny drop of olive oil to minimise greasiness, (also used small tin of peas as opposed to frozen) and garnished with black olives. I omitted the Parmesan cheese, not a fan of the smell. Result= quick, delicious midweek supper.

i used all the ingredients the recipe called for but cut WAY back on the oil and butter.  I also crisped the salami.  The DH and I liked the end result well enough.

Thanks SAVVYHOSTESS for a great pasta recipe!  It's nice to find a non-tomato pasta that's this delicious and easy, too.  I'm sorry to say that I did not use salami - didn't have any - so substituted ham.  I also used some fresh mushrooms and a grated zucchini in addition to the peas and green onions.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Looks terrific and has a great flavor.
