This pie was easy to put together.  I was unclear about the pudding mix though.  I used 2 packages of jello and used 3 cups of milk (basically because I ran out of milk), this made the pudding very thick, when I added in the cream cheese (make sure it's nice and soft) and the whipped topping it made a nice mixture.  However there was a lot of it!  Couldn't get all the filling in the pie pan.

Everyone commented on how rich the pie looked and they seemed to have re-named it, "rich fattening looking pie"!  It was a great hit, thanks for sharing Debbie!

Okay for a quick fix, but I wouldn't consider serving it to company.  Not my favorite, I like the "real thing" too much.

This recipe is great.  It is easy and quick to make and very yummy!  I call it a great bachelor or bachelorette recipe since it is so easy and fun to make.  Also it makes a great first impression if you bring it to a party.  I add my own little touch by crunching up some Oreo cookies and sprinkling it on the top and topping a slice with whipped cream!  YUM!

It was good for a quick simple pie. Nothing to fancy though for company.

To the crust recipe, I cut the butter back by a 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of sugar. I baked the crust at 350* for eight minutes before cooling. To make a thicker pie filling, I did cut back the milk by a half cup. I used a small box of instant chocolate fudge pudding instead of trying to guess measurements. Instead of chilling this pie in the fridge, I froze it instead. The end result was very good, my family enjoyed it. It's worth playing with the recipe for a quick pantry ingredient pie. NOTE: Don't try to mix the coffee into the pudding after it's firmed up. Dissolve the coffee in the milk BEFORE you make the pudding.

A nice, light, creamy pie that is easy to put together.  It wouldn't be my first choice for company, but would work well if you had limited time for a company dessert.
