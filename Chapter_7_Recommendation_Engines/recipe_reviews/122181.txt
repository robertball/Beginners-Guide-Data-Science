I am a professional chef and regularly use this site for ideas, recipes and feedback. I will never rate a recipe unless it is excellent because I feel personal tastes don't ensure proper criticism. But in the case where a recipe is absolutely superb, I will give my feedback and this cookie recipe is one of the best I have tried here. I added 1/2 tsp of kosher salt only because I like a sweet/salt/nut profile but other than that this one gets 5 stars. Great recipe! Thanks*****!

These are great!  I added an extra half cup of nuts because I ground too much.  Also, instead of sprinkling them with confectioners sugar, I rolled them in it while they were still just a little warm.

Excellent recipe. These cookies are so yummy!   Instead of dusting them with the confectioner sugar, I poured some in a bag and tossed the cookies in it while they were still warm. They ended up a little sticky because it was absorbing the sugar and I thought I might have to coat them again. But after waiting overnight they weren't sticky anymore (and still aren't) and they have the *perfect* amount of powdered sugar on them.

I have a hard time shaping them in to the crescent, so I just make small balls and call the "snowballs"!!! I have also attached some pictures so you can see them and also keep in mind, that the cooking time is about 8-10 minutes!!!

Absolutely WONDERFUL recipe.  My dad and my brother-in-law simply can't get enough of these.  I make them every time I'm home visiting from college and every time they are gone in at least two days.

I'm going to a Stampin Up meeting tonight and wanted to bring something yummy.  Well, my husband has ate about half of them since he came home from working, which in turn, now I need to make another batch.  This just tells you how good these cookies are.  I'm dipping half of the crescent in chocolate instead of the icing sugar.  Thanks for sharing!!!!  ~~

These turned out awesome. So easy and quick to make. I toasted the pecans first before adding them to the dough. I also didn't shape them into crescents since I wanted to hurry up. I used my small cookie scoop and then just flattened them with two fingers. I baked them for 13 minutes in my oven (gas) which was sufficient. This will be one of my staples.

My family loves these cookies. Every holiday meal, someone would pay a baker to make these for the event. Not anymore. Followed the recipe exactly, except while the cookies were still warm I rolled them in the powdered sugar, the heat kind of melts it on and gives it a great flavor.

These cookies got an A+ from everyone who tried them and I made quite a variety for Christmas.  My husband said the first bite took his breath away. Now that is not only funny but it is high praise from the picky man!

DELICIOUS!!!  Very simple and taste is perfect....reminds me of a cookie my Grandmother used to make.  Only change I made was to toss in sugar while still warm.  The recipe is a hit, thanks for sharing!

I was looking through trying to find a cookie that didn't take eggs to make and I stumbled upon this one. I have to say I think I found a new house favorite! They came out perfectly and they are so delicious. I have to say they are the best cookies I have ever tried. Love the recipe, it's definitely a keeper!

The flavor is 5 star but, even reducing the baking time, these came out too crunchy/hard for what I was looking for. I WILL make them again because they were very good!

This is a simple but exceptional cookie. I have given these cookies as Christmas gifts and I always get requests for more when the next holiday season comes around. They are light as air, don't get overwhelmed by the powdered sugar, and the pecan flavor is just right. Great with coffee. Just like my momma used to make! Thanks!

These cookies are wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly as directed. My husband loves Pecan Sandies from the store. I have been looking for a similar taste and consistency. I shaped mine into little flat circles. Thank you for sharing.

Absolutely loved these cookies - easy to make and very tasty.  I accidentally screwed up the first batch by adding 1 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup (not paying much attention to what I was doing).  They turned out great.  They were a little flatter and a little crisper - more of a cookie texture.  Since they were also a little sweeter, I didn't dust them with the additional sugar.  I followed the recipe with the second batch and they were perfect.  I had difficulty finding ground pecans this time of year, so I used my coffee grinder to grind chopped pecans.  It worked better for the fine texture than using a food processor.

These were delicious!!  I made a couple of minor changes; I added an additional 1/3 cup of flour and added 2tsp of almond extract.  They turned out GREAT!  I will definitely be making these again :-)

Just got through eating about ten of these..they are so good!! Such a simple cookie, but so tasty. My friend is letting me use her Kitchenaide mixer so this recipe was super simple. I hope I can stay out of them till the family gets home. LOL

I made these for a Cookie Swap at my son's school. I love pecan, but I didn't find these cookies that great.

My cookies had a melt down all over the cookie sheet.  Baked according to ingredients, temp, time.  Needed for a cookie swap today at my house so panicville of course.  Won't dare to try again. Wish I knew what happened

YUM!  Nice alternative to super sweet cookies.  They take some time to form, but are worth it.  Thanks for sharing!
