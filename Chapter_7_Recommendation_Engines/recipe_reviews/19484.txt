This recipe is AWESOME!!  I made it exactly as written, which I always try to do on the first go-round because that's only fair to the submitter.  That way, I'm reviewing THE RECIPE and not my new version of it.  Ticks me off when some reviewers completely change the recipe and then take off stars cause they didn't like it.  OK, I'll get off my soapbox now!!  DH RAVED about the shrimp!!  And you're gonna think I'm crazy, but try this as a side dish:  reserve some of the marinade (I saved about 1/2 cup) cut a head of romaine lengthwise, leaving the core on to hold the leaves together, and allowing 1/4 head per person, drizzle the reserved marinade over it and let it sit.  When the shrimp are done, cover them with foil and then throw the romaine ON THE GRILL!  Cook it, turning several times, until the leaves are wilted and browning a bit.  Then, either serve as a whole quarter or chop to make a bed for the shrimp!  Better than pasta, cause it's a nice, crisp complement to the juicy shrimp!  Thank you, Robbie, for an excellent dinner last night!

I have found my finance & myself to be somewhat seafood snobs so to say. I say this because we have a beach house on the cost of Louisiana where we get the freshest seafood possible.  The shrimp come striaght from the gulf into our home.  We've tried close to a hundred different grilled seafood recipes & this recipe was absolutely fabulous. It wasnt spicy at all unless you hate spices, because I added a little cayenne to mine. We were short on time & I marinated for maybe 30 min., added a cinammon chiptle rub, & folks this marinade was great!!  Its so quick & easy you can't beat it with a stick! Leave the lemon out if you're marinading for hrs. It makes the texture of the seafood horrible! Add it about 30min befoer grilling!

this is like the best of all grilled shrimp recipes rolled into one! I only gave it 4 stars cuz i did change a couple things-i added the zest of the lemon (to up the freshness meter even more), and used 1/2 fresh basil 1/2 fresh parsley (mainly cuz i have a garden being overrun by both). I also added some red pepper flakes. Oh, and I find that i enjoy this recipe more when i use ketchup instead of tomato paste,as i like the sweetness it gives. This was all for personal taste, however i would strongly recommend adding the lemon zest to this ( and really almost any recipe that calls for lemon juice.). BIG difference!!

Don't forget to soak wooden skewers for at least 30 mins in water before to prevent burning!!

My family loved this one. I added a little more garlic and used my George Forman (worked perfectly). I added pineaplle between the shrimp on the skwers. I threaded the bottom part of the shrimp then put a peice of the pineaplle and then the top of the shrimp went on over it....so good. And I placed the lemon slices on top of the skwers while I was grilling them. Served with Pasta Roni's Garlic and Olive Oil pasta and was so so good. You should try it. Will absoulutely make this again!!!!!

I made this for my father-in-law for his birthday barbque yesterday and all of our guests loved it!  The main comment that people made about this grilled shrimp was "Oh my God, this Shrimp is To Die For..."  My husband is usually a very fussy eater and even he liked it.  Something easy to make for dinner and my husband likes it....I think hell just froze over.

Concerned for hubby's sensitive innards, I decreased the amounts of oregano and hot sauce just a little as I thought both would simply make the shrimp too "hot," at least for him. Not to worry! The hot sauce was barely noticable, and didn't even have the slightest bite I was afraid wouldn't work for him.  In fact, he gave this a two thumbs up, as do I. Because we had sub-zero temperatures, I made this on the indoor grill and they were just perfect! I know we will be enjoying this often.

Absolutely delicious!!  I wouldn't change a thing.  For those worried about wasting tomato paste, you can do what I do and freeze it in tablespoon amounts.  Drop tablespoons full on a waxed paper lined cookie sheet and freeze for a few hours.  After that, transfer them to a freezer bag.  You can take out a tablespoon or two at time as needed to add to sauces or marinades.  The dollops thaw in just a few minutes.

I am not a big shrimp fan but my husbadn is -- these were outstanding.  But, i marinated for about 4 hours, cooked for only 3 minutes per side to not overdo, and did not baste as it flared up too ,uch.  They didn't need basting -- they were great.  Would be great on pasta, we ate on rice, and i think would be good on top of my casear salad as well.  We will make them often!

Not only did my fiance want to propose to me all over again, he was ready to give me whatever I wanted after eating this shrimp!  This was the best shrimp EVER!!  We couldn't even focus our attention to the T-Bone steaks he had prepared!  And we also normally have lemon to add to our shrimp on our plate, but not with this recipe.  It didn't need anything else.  We even brought some to our friends and they are all asking for the recipe as well!  Can't wait to make it again!!!  Two thumbs up!

This was rated "the best shrimp we've ever eaten" by my whole family.It taste similar to a shrimp served in a local mexican restaurant. It was slightly spicy hot but just loaded with flavor.  I also did not baste while cooking since my grill flared up when doing this.  It was so moist without basting, so why bother?  We will fix this often.

Delicious!  I used pre-cooked shrimp, substituted Ketchup for tomato paste, and still delicious! (prev review on 6/11/08). Since then I have made this recipe twice. But the 3rd time I was tired of skewing the shrimp so I put it all into an aluminum pan and cooked on the grill. This was great! It kept the shrimp moist and much more flavorful since it cooked in the marinade. I will do this from now on. (last update 8/5/08).  Ok, I have to add more now that the temperature is colder outside. I put all the shrimp and marinate in an oven proof pan, bake at 425 for approx 30 minutes. It's still great!

Love this recipe. Easy and always good. I usually make enough of the marinade for both the shrimp and veggies.  Served this with grilled veggies on skewers - zucchini, mushrooms, onion and red pepper.  A quick easy week night dish. No need to marinate for 2 hours; 30 minutes works fine

I also substituted ketchup for tomato paste, but just a tip for those of you who don't want to open a can for such a small amount. I open up both ends of the tomato paste can, push the paste all the way out, wrap it in saran wrap and freeze it. When a recipe calls for it, I simply unwrap it from the freezer and slice off the amount needed. It works beautifully. I substituted lime for the lemon and it came out delicious. Grilled it on skewers and threw it on top of a caesar salad with some crusty bread. This is a keeper.

One of the best marinades I have made.  We added this to angel hair pasta and some crusty garlic bread...and a caesar salad for a great meal.  Thanks for the post.

Best.Grilled.Shrimp.Ever. Super-easy and fast! 5 stars and more with my few li'l changes and it freaking ROCKED! I will never use another recipe for grilled shrimp, and this comes with Mr. Picky's blessing (that is, my Hubster).
Only changes to ingredients: I had a 1/2 tsp of Herbs de Provance and threw it in marinade. 
I used garlic salt instead of plain salt. I used FRESH ground pepper. I used brand-named Poblano Mexican Hot Sauce (GREAT), and I took the tails off the shrimp, they were completely nude and cleaned. Also, I used KETCHUP instead of tomato paste...and I do NOT like or even respect ketchup, but I got brave and did it, and I think that the slight amount of sugar in there made it all happen right with the very light burnt crust. 
I marinated raw and fat, fat shrimp for 2 HOURS TOTAL. One hour would have worked too for smaller ones. No longer though. The lemon will "cook" the shrimp otherwise, and they were limp and sorrowful upon inspection and I was sad for them...and me...but with only 3 minutes per side on the medium-hot grill, revived to become tempting morsels of overeaten shame! There is no reason to baste! They were moist and delicious. 
We literally could have eaten another pound of shrimpies.  I cannot say enough good about this recipe and thank Robbie Rice for letting me in on the secret to the Best Grilled Shrimp ever. I served with steamed broccoli for a lean and mean Atkins'diet dinner. But I will bet you'd love them with pasta or rice. Enjoy!

This was excellent!  I marinated and then sauteed in pan.  I also added a touch of cream at the end with a touch of salt and pepper to taste.  Tossed it with noodles, it was so good my picky husband scarfed it all up!

LOVED IT!!!!! I have made this twice now. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. Everybody thought it was fabulous and asked that I make it again. The second time I upped the garlic, added some basil and a teaspoon of cayenne. Also, took another reviewers advice and added the zest of the whole lemon (great suggestion). WOW was it delish!!! This is one of the best marinades I've ever used, and I'll use it again and again :) Thank you so much for sharing Robbie Rice!

This is excellent. I did put a dash of worcestershire and liquid smoke in it. Extra marinade is great for cooking vegetables in.

This is my favourite shrimp recipe! 3 tips... use 2 skewers to thread each shrimp line, that way they don't escape your cooking process... make sure to soak the skewers in water for 30 minutes first... and 10 minutes cooking time is too much, more like 6, just baste each shrimp line with the reserved sauce and increase the heat at minute 2 each side for about 30 seconds.  (Reduce the heat, flip, at then wait 2 minutes for the second side.) Get a wonderful char-crisp, melt in your mouth shrimp girl/guy each bite!

OMG! I was in heaven last night when I eating this! This is the best shrimp I have had in a long time! I only made 1 pound of shrimp so I used half the marinade on the shrimp and the other half on some chicken tenderloins and BBQ'd those as well and they turned out delish also. I think the marinade would work well with any kind of meat. I did add the zest of the lemon and used ketchup instead of tomato paste as stated by other users. I think I would cut the salt and pepper in half the next time I make this, it was a bit on the salt side for me. Overall, a wonderful and aromatic recipe, a definate keeper! (Update: made this again and cut the salt in half and it was still too salty. Third time was a charm with no added salt.)

This is awesome.  If I could give it more stars I would.  I think this is the best shrimp marinade I've ever had.  However, like some other people have posted, don't add the lemon juice until you're ready to put it on the grill, or your shrimp will be tough.  I added a little lemon zest to the marinade, and then mixed in the juice to the reserve marinade for basting.  So incredibly good!  Everybody in the house raved about it, and we can't wait to try it on other types of seafood too.

I followed this recipe as is, minus the black pepper and I subbed ketchup for tomato paste as I didn't feel like opening a whole can for such a scant amount.  These had a great flavor to them.  I served them over whole wheat linguini w/sugar snap peas sauteed in EVOO and garlic.  Nice quick easy tasty meal.  TY!

Although I'd love to say I "tweaked" this recipe to personalize it, I didn't. Made it as directed, and all of us were absolutely delighted with the final results. Now I can imagine a few tweaks: skewering with fresh fruit(pineapple, peaches), sweet onions, even chicken thigh tidbits (same marinade? Maybe just a lemon/pepper marinade for the chicken for a refreshing taste?). I say - try the original recipe once then play with it the 2nd time. Enjoy!

First things first; don't discard the marinade in the second step that you need for basting in the third! I tried it as posted, very good. Then made my own changes for a Mexican flare. Sub cilantro for fresh parsley (hint, always use the tube variey instead of fresh in marinades, it will incorporate much better). Sub chipolte Tobascco for "hot pepper sauce," cumin for oregano, and lime for lemon (add the zest and juice).

This recipe was awesome!!  I made it exactly as listed and I could not believe the wonderful flavor!  The only thing I did not do was baste it, we were at the start of hurricane Irene so I just put them on the grill and only had to get wet twice.  This is definitely going into my favs, thanks for sharing!!

Very delicious & juicy shrimp!  This is by far, my favorite recipe to make on the fly, it is so easy to throw together.  The olive oil and the tomato paste really make a good combination.  We grill the shrimp on low heat to avoid the flames and overcooking the shrimp.  THEY ARE SO GOOD!!

Just reading this and will try the recipe, since it sounds wonderful, but just wanted to add a really quick comment.  For those of you who don't want to open a can of tomato paste for just a tablespoon, try freezing the rest.  I take a measured tablespoon, put it into a ziplock snack bag, squeeze out the air and continue until I use up the can. It stays well for quite a while and you would be surprised what a tablespoon of tomato paste can do for many recipes.

No doubt the best shrimp marinade I've ever made. We use it for chicken as well and it's perfect. Everyone asks for it often. We like it spicy so add more hot sauce to kick it up a bit. Try it. You won't be sorry.

To be fair, I have to admit I only marinated for 1 hour.  But I don't think another hour would have made that much difference as the taste was just not there.  A bit of spicy was really the only standout.  I'm a shrimp lover and have rarely found one that I didn't like -- but here's one to add to the list.  Sorry!

These shrimp were very good. My husband loved them.  I would not marinate them 2 hours though.  The lemon juice will actually start to cook them.  45 minutes to an hour is fine.  This will be my regular shrimp marinade from now on.

This is a great recipe. I added some Lime Zest, which provided for an extra fresh taste. I used frozen shrimp, and they were too small ... I think fresh jumbo shrimp would have really contributed to the outcome. I saved some of the sauce to toss linguini in, and put the shrimp on top, and served with Roasted Garlic Cauliflower, and garlic bread.

Absolutely wonderful.  I use allrecipes.com as a guide but always end up doctoring up recipes to my liking.  Not this one.  It was perfection as is!  I considered adding pepper flakes but after tasting it without, it really didn't need it.  As difficult as it was to curb my urge to change it a little I'm glad I didn't.  Robbie you made me a hero.  I was only able to marinate for 1/2 hour and I was too busy making other things to baste and yet it still was moist and flavorful.  Thanks so much.

Flavor is awesome!  I used less hot sauce for personal preference and somehow made it home without the fresh parsley on my list so I used dried.  I let it marinate all day (at least 8 hours) and got rave reviews at an appetizer party.  Also, I just sauteed them as that was more convenient than grilling at the time.

Very good.  I thought 1/4 cup of hot sauce would be way too spicy, but did it anyway...not too hot, but did add a tiny kick.  Very nice!  Tried the grilled romaine and I didn't like it at all.  Maybe drizzle some over grilled asparagus, beans, or summer squash next time. Thanks for the recipe. Will definitely make this again.

So glad I found this recipe, it was a great hit with my father and husband, I'm not suppose to eat shrimp because of the sodium but couln't help myself. I used Frank's hot sauce which I like better then tabasco not as bitter to me. It was simple and easy and served it with filets for a surf and turf. Excellent! I'll pass this on one to my fb friends who share recipes.

Great recipe everyone loved it.  I used Franks red hot but should have used something hotter like tabasco since it could have used a bit more kick.  But flavor was great none the less.

Add this to your next picnic! I used dried parsley since I didn't have fresh on hand. Also, I broiled this in the oven instead of grilling. 

Despite the other reviewer who said you couldn't taste the red pepper sauce, I disagree. These shrimp have a little bit of bite to them, but the heat was happily tolerated by my 6 and 8 year olds. 

I served it with brown rice and corn.

Excellent!  I prepared as directed except for the substitution of tomato paste for ketchup.  I marinated for 2 hours which was almost too much because of the lemon juice (cooks the shrimp) but was still okay.  Next time, no more than hour and a half.  I received rave reviews and will use as my "go to" recipe from now on.  I am a very picky cook and give this recipe 5 stars.  My culinary friend and neighbor asked for the recipe, and considering her skill level, I was honored.

I have made this recipe twice in the last week and my husband and I both love it!  We don't have a grill yet so I broiled them for two and a half minutes per side and they came out wonderful!  I can't wait to try them on the grill!

These were fantastic!  I didn't have tomato paste on hand so I omitted it, but every shrimp were devoured!  These are great under the broiler.  Will be making these again.

Delish!  So easy and very, very tasty.  We use this marinade over and over again.  The only thing I do differently is instead of parsley, I use cilantro.  Just a personal preference.  Goes great on salad or with rice.

Very good. Easy to put together, quick to marinade and fast to cook.  I cut the recipe in half for the sauce and used 10 oz of 30ct shrimp.  I also cut the hot sauce by a third since we wanted our 15mo to try it (she liked it).  I boiled the remaining marinade and added it to orzo, which we added the shrimp.  Served with grilled asparagus, a simple side salad and white wine - yum!

Excellent! Grilled on my George Foreman grill and it was great.  I can't wait to try on BBQ.  I used the same marinade to make some chicken as well and it turned out as good as the shrimp.  Posted photos of both chicken and shrimp.

i'm not afraid to cook shrimp anymore after making this recipe.  you can't go wrong - follow the directions.  i boiled the leftover marinade and poured it over the pasta.  i didn't even baste the shrimp and they were perfect.

I made these for a family bbq, and picked it b/c it didn't require too many ingredients. Prepared the marinade exactly and had my dad grill the shrimp. Thought they came out nicely, and got a lot of compliments... my sister in law even asked me for the recipe later.

My family LOVES this recipe. It is so easy and delicious we have been making this all summer, and shrimp is my 3 year old's new favorite food as a result. I do omit the hot sauce to make it more kid-friendly, and use ketchup instead as another reviewer suggested. I also cut the amount of olive oil in half after making it a couple of times because I did not feel that it needed all that oil.Thanks for the great shrimp recipe!

Great marinade for shrimp, only suggestion I would have is to leave the shells on and peel after...add alot to the flavor and texture. They are done when the shells turn pink. 2-4 min each side depending on the size of the shrimp.

I couldn't wait to review this recipe, but I have been so busy making it again and again!  I followed exactly, and it is UNBELIEVABLE!  Everyone loves it.  The key is to not overcook the shirmp.  Also, I chilled the shrimp afterward and serve cold as an appetizer.

Fabulous flavor and easy to throw together in a hurry.  I've made this twice now and will definitely use it many more times.  I substituted ketchup for the tomato paste as a previous viewer suggested.

That's it.  There is no other way I've made shrimp this summer.  I do it in the broiler though without the skewers and I keep the shrimp in the shell - peeling them at the table - makes it more fun, but the flavor is WONDERFUL!!!!

EXCELLENT! I doubled all of the ingredients because I had the whole fam. Everything was delish...I cut the hot sauce down a smidge and used "Frank's Red Hot Wings Buffalo Sauce." I subbed catsup for the tomato paste as suggested and waited til the last 1/2 hr or so to add the lemon to the marinade. It turned out great. Didn't take the full 5 mins/side to cook. We also used some of the extra marinade to drizzle onto Romaine lettuce and grilled that too to serve the shrimp on. Another good reviewer's suggestion. The whole meal was a hit. Easy to prepare ahead of time and quick cooking so you can actually enjoy the meal! Thank you Robbie Rice!!! I've made this many, many times and I don't even bother with the lemon any more. Perfect without it!

nice flavor!
made it on the foreman grill, but it took away some of the juices. might have been better to fry it since it was too cold to grill.

added the leftover marinade to the noodles.

This is the best recipe for marinated shrimp we have found in years.  Hands down, and like Forrest Gump's friend - we KNOW "Shrimps".  Shrimp ice cream - not so much!

MY favorite shrimp marinade!    I also use ketchup instead of tomato paste since 1 tablespoon out of an entire can would be such a waste.  It's still awesome!!!!!!  Highly recommend!

BEST SHRIMP EVER! Everybody loved them, there were no leftovers! You do have to be real careful when you put them on the grill because any dripping marinade will make it flare up! Don't think I'll make shrimp any other way after this!

Yum!  I am just starting to venture with seafood (after years of being afraid of it) and this was a fabulous way to jump in.  I really enjoyed the marinade for the shrimp.  My boyfriend and I didn't plan ahead and weren't able to let the shrimp marinate for a very long time but it still turned out delicious.

Excellent recipe! My boyfriend said it was one of the best things I have ever made for him. I only marinaded it for an hour and a half, but it still was wonderful. It doesn't need to be over pasta, it was delicious by itself with a few of my favorite side dishes.

Amazing! Yes worth 10 stars! I thought this was "take out" from our fav. restaurant. Ha!  Put shrimp on a bed of Bow Tie pasta w/ lightly saute'd fresh garlic and olive oil. I also added extra chopped parsley to marinade.
This is a must recipe!

Delicious (and this is from someone who doesn't particularly like shrimp). Better than the number one grilled shrimp recipe, in my opinion, as we tried them both tonight.  A bit spicier without being overpowering, perfect for pasta, and great with cocktail sauce.

This is a great marinade.  For the relatively minimal number of ingredients, it's very complex and layered in flavor.  We also tried it with scallops which is not recommended.  The next time I prepare this, I will add a bit of cilantro and maybe a bit more heat either from additional "hot sauce" or dried cayenne.  Really good....

Really enjoyed the marinade because you could still taste the shrimp. Cooked with spanish rice, refried beans and calabacitas for a nice Mexican dinner. Considering substituting cilantro for parsley to give it a more latin flavor.

Delicious recipe - makes an excellent marinade for shrimp.  I reduced the hot sauce as a personal preference but other than that made it exactly as written.  This may be one of my favorite shrimp recipes.

This is a terrific marinate! The recipe is very forgiving as well. Made it the first time with no measurements  (I had yet to set up my kitchen), plus I didn't have any lemon on hand so they were left out. Tip: leaving the lemon out makes this marinate very versatile for chicken.

Excellent!  No changes.  So good that I'm going to try it on chicken breasts or baked white fish.  I think I'll increase the tomato paste if I use on a chicken breast but would be good as is.  Also, I want to try blending in a processor and use as a baking sauce on white fish.  Wish I could create recipes like this, or any recipe for that matter!!!

This recipe is excellent.  I didn't have any tomato paste so I made it without and it was still excellent.  I think the hot pepper sauce is key because it gives it just that little bit of kick.  Also, marinating is important! We loved this and will use everytime we grill shrimp.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This was so good and easy.  My husband and I ate the whole thing.  I cut down on the hot sauce due to personal preference but otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  I just stuck this in a grill pan and they were done in no timme.

Excellent marinade!  We use pre-cooked shrimp, so it doesn't take 5 minutes on the grill (it will shrink up).  Delicious!

Have made this shrimp recipe numerous times for dinner parties, usually as appetizers, and always get rave reviews from guests.  I follow the recipe as is, except I usually add just a touch of cayenne pepper for our guests who like their food with a little "heat."  Great, great recipe!

I don't eat shrimp...this review comes from everyone else in our house that does.
Phenomenal!! Nothing but rave reviews! We only had time to marinate them for a little over an hour but they were reported as "to die for" from my son. We are going to try this again with shrimp and chicken and serve on top of linguine and a cream sauce.

This is a great recipe. I flame-broiled them over hickory chunks. We had them with sweet peppers, onions and mushrooms sauteed in butter and served over rice. Used lemon and lime juice for the veggies. Our whole family loved it.

This recipe is great!  I live in Saskatchewan and had great intentions to BBQ the shrimp but chickened out.  Instead I sauteed tomatoes, mushrooms, onions and used the rest of the marinade to make a pasta sauce.  Through the marinaded shrimp in the pan with the sauce and served it with Rotini pasta.  YUM!

So easy and was so SO good!!  I will try it as a marinade in the summer, but for now this made a great pasta dish!

Note: I also added a splash of red wine to the sauce and fresh ground salt and pepper to each dish once served!

I made this the other night, and it was wonderful.  I added fresh chopped cilantro to the recipe.  I thought it had a great flavor, and even saved some for the next day which I thought were just as good.  YUM.

I made this recipe for our family fourth of July picnic and it was a huge hit! I kept hearing "who made the shrimp?", 4 lbs of shrimp disappeared in minutes. An empty bowl is the best way to tell your recipe is a success! Thanks Robbie!

This was very good.  It was missing a little something to me - not sure what - think I will use more hot sauce and tomato paste next time.

This was great!  I only marinated for about 45 min., but it still had plenty of flavor.  I used ketchup instead of tomato paste, and added some chili powder and a few drops of hot pepper sauce.  My husband and 4-year old just raved about these.  I served with crab cakes and steamed veggies.  My family can't wait until I make them again.

One word -- AWESOME! I've made this only twice, but both times as an appetizer for a rather large gathering.  There wasn't one person who didn't come back for seconds and thirds. Everyone wanted the recipe. The only change I made was to allow the shrimp to marinate overnight, rather than just 2 hours.  A "keeper" for sure.

I made this shrimp the first time and everyone went crazy for it..including my 5 year old and his friend, even though I increased the hot pepper sauce.  I do marinate the shrimp overnight if time allows, but 2-4 hours will do the trick.  This is my most requested dish.  I generally make it for an appetizer for steak or ribs.  Bravo!

The first time I made this, I thought it was way too salty. The second time I made it I omitted the salt all together and it was perfect. Delicious!

This marinade was easy and delicious!  My husband loved it and we use it on most of our seafood.  Not as spicy as you would think and my (almost)13 year old loves it too.

Ok I tried this recipe today (5/26/02) I loved it so much that I'm gonna try it with fish until I get a smaller Grate thingy. I had a problem with the shrimp falling through. Now am I the only one that thought the marinade and the fire didn't mix very well?

At first I was skeptical about the amount of hot sauce this recipe calls for, but it turned out to be excellent (not hot).  The flavors complemented the shrimp without overpowering it.  We served the shrimp on a bed of spaghetti with homemade pesto sauce and the combination was fabulous.  One of the best grilled shrimp recipes I've ever tasted.

This is a great recipe!! Like anything you can adjust to your own taste. We only added a tiny bit more salt, a little more hot sauce because we are hot sauce addicts and double the tomato paste. We didn't have parsley but we have home grown cilantro so substituted that. True Perfection.  Thanks to Robbie, this will be a  bbq staple in our house.

I used 1 TBS Italian Seasoning instead of the parsley and oregano. These turned out excellent. I was going to serve over rice, but I served over buttered noodles instead, and I'm glad I did. The charred seasonings mixed with the butter and created a nice flavor for the pasta as well.

This was absolutely delicious!!! It was very easy to prepare, simple ingredients and the whole family just loved it. The only change I made was that I did not have the tomato paste and didn't want to go to the store just for that, so I used a couple tbsp. of ketchup instead. I also waited to add the lemon juice 30 minutes before they went on the grill. I paired the shrimp with some green beans and garlic/olive oil linguine. GREAT MEAL!! Thanks so much Robbie for sharing, this recipe will become a part of my cookbook!

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  This is my new favorite prawn recipe!  We only marinated them for about an hour (because we were getting hungry) but the taste was still amazing! 
I also used this marinade for some veggie kebabs using cherry tomatoes, zucchini, and cauliflower... I grilled them for a bit longer than the prawns and had the veggies wrapped in foil.  Spectacular!  I can't wait to make again!

Excellent marinade for shrimp.  A bit of heat without burning your mouth.  Cooking the shrimp for 5 minutes a side was a bit too much.  You might want to cut it down to 3 per side.

This is the first recipe that moved me to write a review...This recipe was perfect!!  I followed the recipe exactly even though I was a little worried about the amount of hot sauce and the smell!!  I had read the other reviews and went for it.  I used 2lbs. shrimp, hoping for leftovers but my husband ate it all!  I served it with rice pilaf and roasted fresh vegetables from the farmers market.  I can't wait for shrimp to go on sale again so I can wow the rest of the family with it!  Thanks!

This is an amazing recipe as is! If I don't have leftover tomato paste or a reason to open a can I will sub it for tomato sauce or chilli sauce. Thanks so much for posting it. I have been faithful to it for 2 years straight and all my guests love it too.

Love this recipe! We use Siracha for the hot pepper sauce and double the amount for extra spice! Also, we like it best if the shrimp isn't skewered. Just put a piece of foil on the grill and flip the shrimp during cooking. This allows more of the sauce to stick!

Very very good!!! I didn't know what to expect with the smell of the marinade. I was pleasantly surprised!!! My picky husband even said the same thing!! he's not impressed with much..even if I think it's the best meal ever and he liked these and told me its a keeper...the only change I used Ketchup instead of paste b/c i didn't want to open a can of paste for that little bit.

Made this recipe for a bbq. My guests loved it! Funny fact is that I've never cooked or ate a shrimp before in my life. So, I'm happy to tell you this recipe was the star of a Dutch bbq party. ;)

This recipe is so simple and the shrimp tasted awesome.  I marinated it over night by accident and it survived.  I used the left-over shrimp in a sald and it was good cold as well.

love this recipe, only thing I do differently is use only 1 tsp. oregano and sometimes cut back on hot sauce for the kids.  In addition to serving it grilled I like to saute it in a pan and use the sauce over pasta or rice...trying to figure out a liquid substitute for 1/2 the oil.  1 c of oil seems like a lot in the sauce, makes it "oily" (of course)...but a cup of liquid is necessary to have enough to use with pasta or rice...I'm open to suggestions to create more sauce but without it being so oily!

This is the tastiest marinade!  I would not hesitate putting it on any type of seafood.  My favorite so far has been on scallops, yum!

Made this tonight just as the recipe was written and it came out great.  I only had one pound of shrimp so I cut the recipe in half and it worked out just fine.  It didn't take 5 minutes per side but perhaps my shrimp weren't as large as the recipe called for.  They were the largest I was able to find.  I will be making this recipe again!

Delicious!!!! Followed exactly, except I used sundried tomato paste, b/c that's all I had. I also marinated zucchini & squash with the shrimp. Added pineapple chunks, and steak to these kabobs, served over a bed of chicken flavored wild rice....LOVED these & plan on making frequently during summer!!!

WOW! These were spicey without being over powering and oh so flavourful! I have made these a couple of times now and they are always a huge hit. They pair really nicely with a coconut rice. The only thing I do differently is marinade it without the lemon juice for 2 hours and add the lemon juice for the last 20-30min before grilling.

Fantastic recipe - everyone loved it and I can't wait to make it again. One of those crowd pleaser, need something stand out good recipes.  I used sirachi sauce and mexican oregano, because that is what I had on hand, and would never use anything different. Perfect for those who enjoy a little kick-spice in their food.

AMAZING!!!  My huge family loves and requests this all the time.  I grill the shrimp and add it to a Mexican salad with cilantro dressing, cojito cheese, tomatoes and pepitos.  I also serve this on a bed of rice.  I think it's the best recipe I've ever made.    For the hot sauce I substitute, 1tsp of hot sauce on 2 TBSP of Thai Sweet Chili Sauce by Kim Kum Lee.  The sweetness of the sauce colors and carmelizes the shrimp.  Amazing flavorful wonderful recipe!!

I did not have the parsley, and I omitted the pepper sauce bc of little ones. I used a trick so there is no marinating. If you have one of those hand-held bladed pureeing wands, you just throw everything together and puree away. It turns into mayonnaise consistancy so you can just brush it on before or during grilling! Boy was this good! And I am very picky. It was salty, so next time I only used just over half the amount of salt and it was great. My 4 yr old who does not usually eat more than a small bite of shrimp devoured five of these!!

Outstanding flavor!  If you're reading this recipe and don't think these ingredients will amount to much, then you are wrong!  I mixed the remainder of the marinade with cooked wheat pasta.  Will make again and again!

Amazing.  Had a bunch of people over for dinner and these were the first things that were gone.  Delicious flavor with a slight kick. Will definitely be making these again and again.  I can see how they'd be a great addition to a pasta dish.   I made them with mushrooms, green pepper and onion in between each shrimp - 2 jumbo shrimps on each wooden skewer.

very good... it would be better if i would've used larger shrimp such as jumbo, because the flavoring was almost too strong for the smaller sized shrimp i had.

I must be one of the minority who didnt really care for this recipe, no one in my family did.  I followed the directions exactly as stated.  They were just ok. So, as not to waste them we tried adding fresh lemon and salt, slightly better.  Needless to say I will not be making these again.

Perhaps I am too picky, but this was nothing special.  I love the Lemon Ginger Shrimp found on allrecipes.com MUCH more. (esp if adding 1 T bourbon whiskey!)  This recipe lacked flavor, even when I added more hot sauce.  Just nothing to write home about.

This is awesome!  The best shrimp dish I have ever had. My hubby loved it too.  Not sure what sauce this recipe refers to, so I made extra marinade and heated it on stove to cook parsley slightly, and tossed it with pasta before adding shrimp on top. DELISH!!! I can't wait to share it with my friends.

This is a delicious shrimp marinade.  We eat a lot of grilled shrimp during the summer and I have used this recipe numerous times.  I usually substitute ketchup for the tomato paste, and sometimes add a little cayenne pepper for extra kick (we like hot & spicy dishes).

This recipe is pretty good, I didn't do back flips over it, but I liked it. I would definitely squeeze some fresh lemon in the marinade and squeeze some over the shrimp when it is finished.

I tried this recipe again and let it marinate for three days...talk about punch!It gave it lots of taste everyone loved the unique taste.

Yummy!  I think I used a bit too much hot pepper sauce, but my boyfriend ate one that fell to the bottom of the grill cause he didn't want it to be wasted it was so good.

This was a great grilled shrimp recipe!  i'm a huge shrimp fan and always looking for new ways to fix it.  i marinated them over night.  Then grilled them in a basket on the grill (easier than kabobs!).  And my friends who weren't too sure about shrimp loved them!  Thanks for this great recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly but alternated my skewers with scallops. Came out excellent.  I have some refrigerated marinade left and will toss in some chicken strips tonight and grill them.  Thanks for this "keeper".

Great flavor! Will definitely make this again. I did cut back on the tabasco sauce to 4 teaspoons and marinated it for a couple of hours.

This recipe was fantastic!  I didn't have the parsley but it was still great!  My husband loved it and asked for it again already.

Those are amazing!! Full of flavors. My husband and I like spicy food and this recipe was perfect in our taste. Instead of grilling, I put the shrimps with the sauce in a pan and cook on the stove until the sauce thickened a bit. I also removed the tails.The result was excellent! This is my new shrimps recipe from now on.

Let me first start by saying AMAZING recipe as is! I made this exactly to the recipe the first couple times and loved it. Since I have tweaked it to suit my taste even more. Some adjustments I have made is to cut the oil down to half a cup. I found this makes the marinade a good deal thicker and sticks to the shrimp even more when grilling really enhance the flavor yet still not overpowering the shrimp. I also upped the amount of garlic to 4-5 cloves depending on overall size. I also added a little extra parsley and used Italian tomato paste. To save time I mixed all my ingredients into the food processor and blended it to a smooth puree and let shrimp marinade for 6 hours in the fridge before grilling. Delicious! Thank you for the great recipe.

Perfect to scale to the number of servings you need and full of flavor.  I froze the remaining tomato paste for future use as pizza sauce.  We will be making this again.

fantastic recipe! definitely the best shrimp recipe i've come across. I had to make a few subs because i didn't have everything... dried parsley instead of fresh (4tsp) and spaghetti sauce instead of tomato paste (1tbs)... SO YUMMY!

i am terrified of hot sauce and cannot handle anything even remotely considered spicy, so i was hesitant about putting in 2 whole tablespoons of hot sauce, but my mentor taught me to try it like it's written first before changing anything and MAN AM I GLAD I DID!
i LOVED this recipe EXACTLY HOW IT IS!! it wasn't spicy at all, just perfectly flavorful. We served it over a bed of rice instead of pasta. yum!
we will definitely be having this again!!!

I had an unexpected visit from my daughter and husband, and was missing parsley and the hot pepper sauce. I threw in Italian seasoning and dry cracked red pepper instead, and the shrimp were incredible! I'll be ready the next time to make it the right way, but I loved that I could have such a good result even with substitutions!

Perfect recipe!  I did use another reviewer's suggestion and used ketchup instead of the tomato paste b/c of the small quantity.  I made them again and used a squirt of honey too. Next time, I'm going to at least double the recipe so using the paste won't be a problem.  Yum!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have made it several times for guest with rave reviews.  One even said  it was better than the high priced restuarants that he had been too.  I use a chili habanero sauce from El Yucateco, it has a wonderful bite with a slow, hot burn.  I do use ketchup since I alway have it on hand.  This is a keeper.

This was fabulous...!! The only changes I made was to add cilantro in place of the parsley and because I used smaller shrimp I roasted them in the oven at 450 for 5 minutes.  Tasty...!!

WOW! The taste was First Class!!  Marinated these as suggested, sans lemon which was added when grilling.  Froze in the bag and then took camping.  Skewered and grilled.  Served over cleaned romaine, which soaked up some of the cooked juices and made for a delicious crunch.  Super fancy looking but so easy to put together.  First bite was out of this world perfection. There was an energetic discussion as to who would get the last shrimp.  Totally impressed my boyfriends parents who had joined us camping at Mesa Verde this last weekend.  When I want to cook to impress or just want to eat some delicious shrimp, this is what I will be making.  YUM!!

Amazing flavor! My husband and I absolutely loved it.  I followed some reviews and used ketchup, and I only had time to marinate for 20 minutes, and I sauteed in a frying pan for a few minutes in some of the marinate, and it turned out incredible.  My only regret is that I could have used way more shrimp!  I will certainly be adding this to the rotation!

excellent marinade-used tomato sauce instead of paste, and added a dash of balsamic to cut the sourness- didn't have time to grill so sauteed it in a pan and threw it over a bed of arugula along with corn, caramelized onions, browned mushrooms, and gorgonzola cheese (random things I needed to use up in my fridge)- the salad turned out to be really good!

I would give this 6 stars if it was available. We made this recipe multiple times over the summer and will use it again when grilling weather is upon us. Try it with lime juice instead of lemon...yummy!   As other reviewers have suggested, don't leave the shrimp in the marinade more than an hour. The lemon/lime juice will cook the shrimp.

This is the best shrimp recipe!  Everyone raved over it.  I used a lime instead of lemon, as that's what I had, and I prefer lime to lemon with shrimp. I also omitted the pepper, as I don't care for black pepper. Instead of fussing with skewers, we used a grill stir-fry pan, which worked great. This is going to be my go-to recipe for grilled shrimp from now on! (The shrimp we had were kind of on the smaller side, so I only marinated for about 30-45 minutes, and it was fine like that)

This was sooo delicious! I used frozen fully cooked shrimp, marinated it for about an hour and put it on the grill on skewers for about 5-6 minutes, turning once.  I added fresh basil and oregano, which I would definitely recommend. This will definitely be one of my go-to summer recipes this year!

AWESOME!! Followed recipe to a "T", except I reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. Very tasty! I tried the trick of freezing a can of tomato paste (pushed out of the can, of course). Once frozen,I sliced it into 1 tablespoon sized slices, then wrapped it up and put it back in the freezer. Now I can pop out just the right amount each time!

FYI – You can purchase a tube of tomato paste (most grocery stores carry it, I purchased it at Williams-Sonoma)…instead of wasting a can…
This recipe is great, did away with adding the salt, and substituted fresh cilantro instead of oregano, and also added lemon zest.  Total party favorite!

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site and I prepare it 2 different ways.  I prepare as written with the Ketchup substitution and I either grill it, or I dump the shrimp and marinade into an 8x11 pan and cook it all together as scampi.  Depending on the size of the shrimp, I cook it at 450 for about 5 minutes and then I broil it for about 5 minutes.  The marinade becomes a great sauce for dipping bread into or for serving with the shrimp over pasta.

This was fantastic!  I let it marinate for about 2hrs. I also used ketchup rather than tomato paste, as previously suggested by other raters. I added a little worchestershire sauce and used fresh chopped parsley.  Very Good recipe and I would like to try it on chicken as well.  Thank you!

I took previous reviewers' advice, cutting the olive oil in half and subbing ketchup for tomato paste.  I used pre-cooked shrimp, so I let them marinate a full day and grilled about 1 min/side until heated through.  Served with Summer Tomato Salad and a big side salad too.

Very good recipe!  I ended up sauteing the shrimp and tossing with bow-tie pasta.  My hubby and I really enjoyed it and plan to make it again.  Would NOT increase the amount of tabasco - the amount called for in the recipe is right on; any more, and it would overpower -- it's perfect as is.  If anything, I might increase the lemon juice and decrease the salt a little.  Overall, though, very good!

This was a fantastic recipe, my husband could not stop exclaming how wonderful it was.  It was a treat and very simple to make.  Rather than grilling however, I cooked it in a skillet with the maranade.  I will be making it again.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars only because I couldn't give it 10 stars. I do think it is named wrong though, I think the name should be 'Magical Disappearing Shrimp' ;-) My 6 kids were eating it right off of the grill, it didn't even make the dinner table! The marinade was absolutley perfect!! I will be making this often. Thank You Robbie

just right amount of spicy. easy to prepare and quick to cook. i used frozen, peeled shrimp which made it extra quick to prepare.  i threw everything into a large ziploc bag and made sure to turn it a few times during the fridge process to coat the shrimp really well. afterward, i threaded onto skewers and put on the george foreman grill (we don't have a real one yet) for a few minutes. served with rice, this was a filling meal.

Yum! This recipe was a big hit! I did cut back on the olive oil as one cup seemed a bit excessive. And I did cut back on the hot sauce using 1 Tbsp. of Frank's Red Hot because I wasn't sure just how spicy these would get. I put it all into a ziploc bag and let it marinate for two hours. I soaked my wooden skewers in water to prevent burning. These grilled up nicely and tasted fabulous! Great as an appetizer, compliment to steak, or all by itself! Thanks for a great recipe!

Loved this recipe.  Only thing is that I found it too spicy.  Honestly the hot sauce is not really needed in this recipe.  Marinated for about four hours and was extremely tasty.  I will definitely be making this again.  Cooked on a charcoal barbeque, made it even better!

We opted for baking the shrimp in its own marinade with red peppers and sweet onions (omitting the tomato paste). Bake at 425 degrees for approx. 30 minutes.  Serve with rice. The shrimp and vegetables have a spicy, garlic flavor. Entire family enjoyed it very much!

We make this recipe all the time with rave reviews from everyone.  The only change we make, is to hold back on the lemon until 5-10 minutes prior to grilling; otherwise the lemon acid-cooks the shrimp and they turn to mush.

awesome recipe, I didn't have tomato paste so I just pureed a tomato and added just a lil bit of honey cause I put a lil too much hot sauce. Im sure the real paste woulda been awesome, gotta make sure I have all the ingredients next time. I also broiled it because I don't have skewers lol but like I said, still awesome

This shrimp is excellent!!! The flavor is incredible, and it tastes just like it was from a nice restaurant. Unfortunately I don't have a grill, so after marinating for two hours, I cooked the shrimp in a skillet on the stove for about 3 minutes per side on medium heat. (I cooked it with some of the marinade in the skillet, too). The only other differences I made were that I used about 2 more cloves of garlic, since I believe there's never too much garlic. I also added lemon zest since I hate to waste any of a lemon. These shrimp were succulent, flavorful, and perfect. Thank for the recipe!

This is the best shrimp I have ever had! I don't really measure, I just estimate and I was out of oregano so I threw a little basil in there instead. I took the advice of another reviewer and only marinated for maybe half an hour because of the lemon juice in the marinade. I didn't have enough skewers to fit all of the shrimp so I grilled some and did the rest in a saute pan with the marinade. The sauce that was left is soooo good! We dipped our bread in it and next time I'm going to make some pasta to serve with the sauce. This is going to be my go to recipe for shrimp from now on. Thanks so much for the recipe Robbie!

This shrimp is awesome!!!  I was a looking for something a little different, more special than the typical jazzed up italian dressing marinade.  I was kind of unsure about the tomato paste and oregano; thinking it would overpower it.  I was so surprised and pleased to find out that this is the best shrimp I've ever made.  The tomato paste didn't overpower it at all, rather, it made the marinade cling to the shrimp.  You have to try this!

Probably more of a 4 star recipe for us but in all fairness I changed a couple things so figured I'd go with 5 stars for now.  I used ketchup in place of the tomato paste since it seem like such a waste to open a can of paste and use only 1 TB.  I used 1/8 cup fresh basil with 1 TB dried parsely as that is what I had on hand.  I didn't add the lemon juice as we weren't going to grill them for a few hours- intended to add it 30 minutes before they went on the grill but completely forgot.  They were good- glad we tried it despite having to sub a few ing.

The beauty of this recipe is that the marinade has just the right amount of flavor and spice to make it interesting but not mask the shrimp.  And it is thick enough that it stays with the shrimp even through grilling.  It was a big hit with the family this weekend!

Made tonight for dinner and it was good! Added green and red bell pepper to the skewers and made it even better. It was a good mix of flavors for the marinade however next time I will let it sit longer in the fridge than an hour maybe the flavor will be more intense next time. Also I will add onion and mushrooms to the skewers. It's a good change for the BBQ from all the steaks and chicken we do in the summer.

I made these shrimp kabobs for a BBQ on Father's Day and I cooked them over charcoal and wood chips. They were very flavorful and went over well. I marinated them about an hour and a half and my personal opinion is the only one I can really go by but next time I think I will only toss them in the marinade and maybe use it to baste them if needed but I thought it made the shrimp a little mushy. I am going to try it again and see if that was the problem cause I really liked the flavor.

Made as directed, except that I used my food processor to chop the parsley and mix the sauce.  Super tasty and quick.  Very fresh flavors on the grill. My 6 year old son came up to me after, gave me a big hug, and said "Thanks Mom for cooking that great shrimp!"  
Served over soba noodles (because I wanted to get rid of them) and that was good, but would also be fantastic over rice or regular noodles or on its own.  I have extra and will be making a shrimp sandwich for lunch later this week.

I didn't have tomato paste and used ketchup instead.  I don't know how much that changed it, but this was DELICIOUS!  I have never had grilled shrimp better than that at a restaurant, and I've ordered shrimp a lot of times a lot of ways!  This is now a staple on my grill.  Thank you!

I gotta tell ya, once I mixed this strange mix of ingredients and tasted the 'raw' marinade, I was scared, that I was going to ruin my fresh shrimp. However, I went ahead and marinated the shrimp for 30 minutes in the mix anyhow, cause I had already poured a cup of Olive oil in the marinade...and that stuff isnt cheap! After grilling, cooling, then eating I was Amazed at how good these were! Had a nice little spicy kick and really good flavor. I took some to my father and he even said he thought it was even better than some of the shrimp he has gotten at restaurants lately. Thanks for the great recipe, will use again.

This got a thumbs up from my dinner guests and me!  I substituted ketchup for tomato paste since I didn't have paste and was very pleased with the results.  The ketchup gives it a bit of sweetness too.  As stated by one reviewer, marinading the shrimp no more than 45 minutes is sufficient as the lemon juice will "cook" the shrimp (like ceviche) if it sits too long.  Mine sat for nearly an hour and I felt they didn't grill as well as other marinated shrimp recipes I've tried but will definitely make this again.

This was fantastic! I served the shrimp over a salad of mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes, using a little reserved marinade as the salad dressing. I've tried numerous "BBQ Shrimp" type recipes, but this the best. I definitely will make this again, however, my source for fresh, beautiful, wild shrimp is becoming a polluted mess.

Followed the recipe exactly as written, but only used half the marinade for the shrimp.  As another cook suggested, I used the other half to pour onto a head of romaine that was cut lengthwise and grilled.   Excellent!  Thank you!  (I only marinated for an hour and it was perfectly seasoned.)

The family loved the shrimp, but I wasn't as much of a fan.  Instead of grilling in, I ended up just cooking it in a pan on the stove in the marinade (no skewers) and it worked out fine.

This recipe was very good! I rated it four stars because I felt it could have used a bit more spice. I'd add more hot sauce next time. Because I didn't have access to a grill during the winter, I broiled the shrimp for three minutes on each side.

Great flavor. I've made several times and always get asked for the recipe. I add pepper flakes for a little more heat. I love serve it over a crisp caesar salad!

Very good marinade.  I used EVOO and I think it was a little too much olive flavor.  Next time I'll use vegetable oil and probably cut it down to 3/4 of a cup.  Otherwise, it was very tasty!

My family loved this meal. Served it over angel hair pasta (olive oil & parmesan cheese). My son took one taste and asked if i'd ever been a "cook". Next time I will make extra marinade so that I can drizzle over shrimp & pasta when serving.

Yummy! I used ketchup instead of tomato paste, added old bay seasoning and I also added lemon zest and first to the marinade, then the last half hour of marinading I added the lemon juice.  Very good.

Shrimp is not usually my first choice on a menu, but I made this for Mother's Day, and it was fabulous!  No only is the marinade good on shrimp, but also on scallops.  I emulsified the marinade in a blender to make it a creamier consistency.  This will be a regular recipe this summer.  Thanks!

Loved this recipe....gave it a 4 only, becasue I made a few adjustments.  Only need about 1/4 cup of oil, 1 cup is too much!!!! Did add ketchup instead of tomato sauce, like a few others suggested and decided to do lime and cilantro instead of parsley and lemon(no fresh basil available).  Easy preparation and most ingredients on hand already.  My husband who is a executive chef, loved it as well as my 3 year old.

WELL DONE!!!  This marinade makes the best shrimp!  I doubled the recipe...we were making 4lbs. of shrimp.  I bought jumbo frozen shrimp, they were butterflyed for the grill.  Marinated for about 3 hrs.  Perfection.  I did add a tad of cayenne, cuz we like it hot.  Really, just thanks so much for this outstanding marinade.  We just ate, and my whole house is happy!

The BEST shrimp recipe! I've tried to cook shrimp with many recipes and never really want to use the same one again...something missing. This is the one I'll stick with. I bought a 1/4 lbs raw (deveined) shrimp and used 1/4 recipe. Used ketchup in stead of tomato paste, and used Frank's for the hotsauce. I only marinated for 1/2 h because otherwise the lemon juice will make shrimp meat tough. I put shrimp under the broiler for 2 min, took it out and turned, topped with little bit of parmesan cheese and put under broiler for another 2 min...perfect (med size shrimp). The only thing I'll change next time is to use .5 t less oregano. I ate the whole 1/4 lbs by myself (burb).

Delish!! These are perfect as a side dish to any meal. We like our food spicy, so I add oil that is infused with red pepers. All I do is saute for a few minutes my red peper flakes in the oil and let it cool. Its great to give your food a little kick without really changing the flavor.

WOW!  This recipe is top notch!  I think it is one of new favorites.  I followed the recipe as written with only one minor change...I decreased the tabasco to only 4 tsp.  This made the heat perfect especially for my kids. I marinated the shrimp in only 1/2 of the sauce and saved the rest for serving with angel hair pasta.  Put a little sauce on the pasta and toss.  A little sauce goes a long way but it adds LOTS of delicious flavor.  I then topped the pasta with the shrimp.  FANTASTIC!!

AWESOME!  I added red pepper flakes, more hot sauce and basil-we like spicy.  I don't bother putting them on a skewer-too much trouble, I just grill them in an aluminum pan on the grill.

Made the shrimp exactly as the recipe stated, except I cut the oil by 1/2.  It was great!  I used the extra marinade to make a cream sauce for pasta.  It was excellent!  I was afraid the sauce would be too spicy, but with the cream and pasta, it balanced it out perfectly.  My two year old even loved it!

This was not only fast to cook on the gril but really tasty! Everyone loved it. Even our 8 year old and her friend said it was delicious! I used garlic olive oil instead of garlic + olive oil and it was great. 

I also marinate chicken with the marinade and it's a big hit too. Thanks for the great recipe!

I also substituted the tomato paste with Ketchup. Best shrimp I've ever made! Since the shrimp were cooking on the upper grate above the steaks some of the marinate dripped onto the steaks and gave them a nice flavoring as well.

These shrimp are so tasty. I served them along side of fettuccini alfredo and vegetables. They would be a good appetizer too. I don't like food to be overly spicy, so I only used 1 Tablespoon of Tabasco sauce. and I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used dried. I didn't put the shrimp on skewers, I simply grilled the shrimp on my panini grill for around 2-4 minutes. So quick and easy. You have to try this recipe.

This was delicious.  I've made it twice a week for the past couple of weeks.  I used ketchup instead of tomato paste.  I didn't have any parsley, so I put a little bit of cilantro instead and it was really good.  This is my new go-to meal.  YUM!

*UPDATE* After making this at least 10 times, I've discovered that you don't even have to waste time marinating it.  Brush the marinade on while grilling, and it's still great!  This recipe is simply the best!!!!

Excellent recipe! Made this tonight with some minor modifications. Doubled the garlic, used ketchup in place of tomato paste, added 1 teaspoon of Old Bay (and cut the salt by half), added 1/2 teaspoon of sugar. I also grilled it for only 4 minutes per side (5 minutes per side seemed a tad too long). My husband and I enjoyed our meal very much. Definitely a keeper!

I made this for my parents when they came over for dinner this past weekend. Everyone loved the shrimp! The hot sauce gives it the perfect kick. I thought it might be too spicy since it seemed like a lot, but it wasn't at all.  It might be good with cilantro, too. Anyway, definitely a keeper. It's easy, uses common ingredients and will be a hit!

Tried this the first time and followed directions exactly.  Family thought it was just okay.  After modifying (1/2 chili oil 1/2 olive oil and no additional hot sauce, basil instead of oregano, added lemon zest) the ingredients, I ended up with a much better dish.

Yum, Yum, Yum!!!  This is so very good and so very tasty that even my picky eight-year-old liked it.  But the true test came when my husband said it was good!!!  I nearly fell out of the chair!!!  I might decrease the amount of olive oil next time, but other than that this was a wonderful recipe!!!!

I made this last night. It was my first time ever grilling shrimp and it turned out so good! I used half the amount of oregano.  I think next time I will decrease the lemon and add a little more hot sauce.  I also marinated chicken breast and put them on skewers as well. It works well with chicken too!

I made this tonight for Father's Day.  I left the lemon zest in the marinade..  I marinated for about 4-5 hours.. I used frozen uncooked shrimp..They were too small for skewers so I put them on the grill in a foil grill pan.  They turned out great.. even my picky kids, gobbled them up.  They were not that spicy at all.  No leftovers!!  I'll have to make this again for them since it was such a hit.

This shrimp was the best I've ever made on the grill.  My son who is extremely picky asked if we could have it again the next night.  The only thing that I would do different the next time is watch more closely on the grill (maybe 2 to 3 minutes on each side) so they don't get tough. Can't wait to try it again!

Excellent and easy.  I've served this up several times at dinner parties and it is always a hit.  I serve over angel hair with the guest's choice of marinara or alfredo sauce.

This is the ideal Summer Meal! Even though we are not officially celebrating the “actual” season~ this past weekend we here in NJ, had a burst of some beautiful weather.  Spent most of our time outside~ so I really appreciated how easy this dinner was to put together!  Even better than that, was how “out of this world” it tasted!!!  The only ingredient I changed per suggestions of other reviewers, was subbing the ketchup for the tomato paste.
I simply threaded just the shrimp on skewers and grilled them, saving the marinade.  While they were on the fire, I boiled up some pasta.   I served the pasta in individual bowls with the heated marinade on top, and finished it off with a sprinkling of freshly grated parmesan cheese.  I laid the skewers of shrimp on the side of the bowl.  Included a salad and some garlic bread and we were all culinary heaven!  Can't say enough about this recipe!!!  You simply can't go wrong!   Thanks for a keeper.

This recipe was great and I will definitely use it again!  I only marinated the shrimp for 30-45 minutes and they were still delicious.  The spice was just right and the lemon juice gave it a wonderful fresh taste...perfect for summer.

I was just about to submit this recipe myself and went to check and see if it was already here.  This is fantastic.  I have been making this for years and years.  I have made this as a dinner and served it with pasta or on it's own.  I have also made this as an appetizer.  I place two shrimp per skewer and pass around.  It's ALWAYS a hit.  Never a single one left no matter how much i make.

These were very good.  I substituted ketchup for the tomato paste and did not use as much olive oil.  Next time I will follow the suggestion to sprinkle a little of Emeril's essence on them before grilling.

Ooh la la!!!!  The easiest and best shrimp marinade I've ever tried.  Took to a friend's birthday party, and everyone wanted the recipe!  DO marinate overnight if you have the time, however....makes the shrimp even tastier!!

Made it exactly as described. After all the reviews I was really excited to make this for hubby's birthday.  I thought this was very good but my husband, who ADORES shrimp, would not eat it.  He said it had an almost sweet taste (maybe from the tomato paste?).  I might try again, but also add crushed red peppers to see if that kicks it up enough for him.

JRW flat-out loved this, and I enjoyed it also.  I subbed ketchup for tomato paste and broiled them in the oven as it's too cold to grill right now.  No other changes made, and it was superb!!!

Who needs pasta? These sweet little wonders are fantastic on their own! We used them as appetizers and they flew off the grill. Great recipe Robbie and thanks so much!!

Oh my gosh!  This is soooo good!  I made this last weekend at the lake for family and friends, along with barbecue shrimp, coconut shrimp, grilled salmon, fried oysters and fried fish---this was a definite favorite.  I love barbecue shrimp, but this may take the lead for me.  My friend, Allan, asked me about the recipe and I said I had gotten it from Allrecipes.  He said he had gotten this same recipe from Allrecipes and had made it several times because it was one of his favorites.  Thanks Robbie!

This recipe is so simple, yet creates such flavorful and delicious shrimp! Broiling the shrimp works as well as grilling them too!

Great flavor.  I used med/small and wished I used med/large.  Soak your wooden skewers in water for at least 2 hrs.

This is an excellent recipe. Alittle too hot perhaps for some, but not overpowering. Spicy Grilled Marinated Shrimp is a better title. Word of advice, while cooking on grill, if you even suspect the shrimp are done, they probably are.  I overcooked the first batch, and although they were great, second batch much better.

I wish I could give it more stars. By far the best thing I've ever made from a recipe.  I have used this so many times that it's something I'm known for.  I also use this marinade for grilled chicken and I grill portabello mushrooms also with it.  WOW!!!

Wonderful!  Made this for Superbowl, I think I will be invited to every Superbowl party now!  :)  I made a few changes - first one was unintentional - chopped up too much parsley but added it all anyway.  So added more olive oil (wasn't liquid enough after the extra parsley).  Added more garlic.  Put about 8 shakes of Worchestershire sauce in.  After the party started, put in a splash or two of beer.  I swear, everyone raved.  Said it was like something you'd get in a restaurant.  Have made int broiled in the oven or grilled on indoor grill.

I thought this was pretty good but not great.  It could have been because since I don't have a grill I had to  broil them in the oven.  Also the marinade didn't seem to penetrate the shrimp.  I will make these again when I buy a grill.  My husband and daughter loved them anyway.

This recipe was GREAT! I threw the marinade together during my lunch hour and let the shrimp defrost in it. The shrimp stayed in the marinade for about 4 hours before I got home to grill them. In about 20 minutes after returning home all five us were sucking down the shrimp. There was not one shrimp left and two pounds was probably not enough for us. Wonderful recipe, Thank You!

Good but it really didn't knock my socks off. My husband enjoyed these more. He said he liked the subtle hint of spiciness from the cayenne and it was just the right amount.

I think my shrimp wasn't the best quality.  This recipe was fine, not enough "humph" that I wanted.  I followed the recipe closely, and marinated it for 2 hours.  BUT, just not what I was looking for.  Will try the other recipes on this website.

This marinade is wonderful!  My husband thought it was a little spicey, but I loved it!  The amount of hot sauce could easily be halved for those who prefer a milder taste.

We paired it with a salad with sundried tomato viniagrette.

This is a very, very good marinade.  I did as one other reviewer, and added FF half & half after cooking on the stovetop. (Too cold to grill!)
But, I also used the marinade when cooking and it was very salty; not to mention that the half & half didn't mix with the olive oil at all.  It just sat on the bottom of the pan.  Next time I make this, (and there will be a next time), I will grill as written.  Thanks Robbie!

What a delightful surprise!  followed the recipe, minus the tomato paste - just spaced out.  Used easy peel extra large shrimp and marinated and grilled it with the shell on.  Used Franks hot sauce for the hot pepper sauce.  Deliciously moist and delightfully flavored.  Surprisingly good.

This recipe is beyond wonderful! I have never had shrimp done this well. Make sure you follow it precisely and grill over an open flame. The olive oil will tend to catch fire, but I think that's what does the trick and the shrimp do not burn. I was skeptical with the hot sauce (I used tabasco), but the flavor was divine. Thanks for sharing!

This is now my go to shrimp grilling marinade. I thought it might be too simple and bland but nope! Turns out it produces absolutely delicious grilled shrimp. Other than reducing the olive oil to  1/2 cup which was plenty I followed the recipe exactly, marinating for 2 hrs which it seems is just right. I used the easier method of grilling in grill baskets. Wouldn't change a thing. You can't improve on perfection! DELICIOUS! PS By the way it works nicely for a baste for grilled Romaine heads as well!

Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 becuase I would cut back on the olive oil-- way too much! Otherwise, a truly fantastic recipe!

I made extra marinade and did the veggies with it!  Yellow squash, zucchini and red bell peppers...yum!

I didn't use skewers though, I just did them in a foil boat over the grill.  Easy and delicious...can't beat it!

We love this recipe. So easy and good. I did use ketchup rather than tomato paste as suggested by one reviewer simply because it was easier than opening a new can of paste.

Made this with 3 small alterations. I used 1/4 cup fresh basil and 1/8 cup parsley, I reduced the hot sauce to 1 tblsp, and used Ketchup instead of tomato paste.  Delish................

amazing! but for some who didn't know- the acid in the lemon will toughen up the shrimp if you let it marinate too long SO i added the lemon juice 1/2 hour before putting on the grill. turned out wonderful. it is a little on the salty side so for those not a fan of salt just cut salt in half. but if you are putting it in a pasta dish or salad just omit the salt from that recipe and it will balance out! definitely will be making again and again...

This was FANTASTIC.  Based on what I had on hand, I substituted garlic powder for minced garlic cloves (1/8 tsp per clove), ketchup for the tomato paste, and omitted the oregano.  I only used 1 tablespoon of Frank's Red Hot sauce for the pepper sauce, since I was cooking for young kids.  And, I only had time to marinate for half an hour.  Still, it was so, so, so good.  It had a kick, but not too spicy, especially when paired with pasta.  I'll make it the same way next time.  Total hit!

This makes perfect grilled shrimp. Delicious. I did add a little bit of Cajun seasoning to the shrimp before putting in the fridge to marinate. Wonderful recipe.

Loved this one! Didnt feel like the regular scampi thing, and have a mom that has a sensitive stomach so I didnt add the hot sauce. These were still very yum, kicked up the lemon a bit an added some dill, and soy....not much cause it didnt need it really.

This was a hit at Mother's Day dinner. A few modifications: ketchup instead of tomato paste, chili sauce instead of hot sauce and added a bit of lemon zest. 
This is pretty easy to make aside from the time it takes to skewer the shrimp. I will make it again

This recipe is one of the reasons I love All Recipes so much! This is a five star rating, and one that is well deserved!!!!! I did make a few on the spot modifications but I really do owe all the credit to Robbie for posting this! I used 2lbs of fresh tiger shrimp. The changes I made were as follows: I didn't have any fresh lemons on hand so I used bottled lemon juice (I put about the juice of 1.5 lemons. I used Frank's Red Hot for the hot sauce, and I added a few squirts of Sirracha sauce (Rooster Sauce) because I like things spicy! I added about an extra tbsp of tomato paste, eyeballed the salt and pepper and I added about 2 tablespoons of hot paprika. This was made as an appetizer for my housewarming bbq and it was the biggest hit of the night. I skewered three shrimp per skewer and the were all gone in not even 10 minutes. Thanks again Robbie, I'll be making this for many years to come!

These shrimp turned out to be very good.  I was concerned about the hot sauce, but they ended up not being really spicy at all, which surprised me.  I set these to marinade before going to work in the morning, so instead of marinating for 2 hours, they marinated for about 9-10 hours.

One of the best shrimp marinades I've ever had!  I added red pepper flakes and made a switch to ketchup instead of the paste since it was all I had on hand, marinaded for just over 40 minutes and it was excellent.  Words cannot describe the unique flavor it adds to the shrimp.  Served with Spanish rice and it was a hit with the family!  Definitely will keep this one on hand for future use.

I have been looking for a good marinated shrimp recipe and this is it.  Just enough spice and loads of flavor.  I used a small amount of Tabasco and the rest I used a milder hot sauce.  It wasn't too spicy to serve to children, but had plenty of flavor.  Should be good on other seafood and chicken as well.  It's a keeper!

This was very easy to make and absolutely delicious!  It was cold out so instead of BBQ'n on skewers, I decided to sauté the shrimp in a pan using the marinade as the oil for the pan.  Once cooked, I added in linguine, stirred and had a solid pasta dish.  Definitely recommend this.

Tried this today and it came out perfectly.  Just the right amount of hot sauce so as to not overpower the shrimp flavor. The only thing I did was take the advice of another member and waited to add the lemon juice.  Will make again and again!!!

This was the most amazing marinade I've ever had! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding the lemon just before grilling as one reviewer suggested. We brought them to a group BBQ and everyone LOVED them.
**UPDATE**
Used Sirachi for the hot sauce and this will be a permanent change! Added just the right amount of spice and everyone loved it!

Very good.  I will make again.  I grilled mine over wood charcoal with some oak chunks to give it a slight smokey flavor.  The recipe and smoke worked well together.

Made this along with chicken kabobs for Mother's Day tonight & it was soooo good.  I made a few slight changes due to what I had around the house: only used 10 oz of shrimp, used dried parsley, only used about 1/2 tbs of tobasco sauce (sensitive tummies, so I was worried about putting in too much), and subbed in ketchup for tomato paste (accidentally put in an extra tbs as well because I got distracted, oops).  These shrimp were VERY GOOD, I had seconds and I am a big shell fish eater...thank you very much for sharing!!  :)

Followed the proportions and recipe exactly but didn't like it. If I ever decide to try it again I might try it with more cajun spices to add a bit more flavor.

This was excellent!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband who is particular, and generally has a suggestion to make something a little better, said this is a keeper!! I used Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Pepper Sauce, it was actually cheaper than the other pepper sauces.  Instead of putting the shrimp on skewers I just grilled them in a grill basket, in the words of my husband, a definite KEEPER!!!

AMAZING!  My husband is a huge seafood lover and his quote was "Best shrimp ever!".  The only minor change I made was using ketchup instead of tomato paste.  Will definitely make this again!

Soooo good!  About once a week my boy friend asks me to make this dish!  I don't have a grill, so i just throw the shrimp and some of the marinade in a skillet over medium-high heat.  Then I serve it over rice.

I threw this together on a whim for an appetizer to grilled burgers and chicken breast.  It was a hit!  I didn't want to waste a can of tomato paste for such a small amount so I omitted it from my recipe.  Didn't seem to matter, everyone loved it.  Nice "heat" to it.

The BEST grilled shrimp I have ever eaten!! My husband and I both agreed that these tasted better than any shrimp we have eaten at a restaurant... Needless to say, it didn't take long before they were all gone! I will definitely be making these again... and again!!

Delicious!  The marinade was very light and added perfect flavor.  The only changes I made was to use ketchup instead of tomato paste because that was all I had, and I made them with the broiler.  Thanks for a great recipe, I will definately make these again!

This came out fantastic!  I used 2 lbs of large pre-cooked frozen shrimp (about 40 shrimp in all, 6 per skewer) and substituted cilantro for parsley.  I did add a bit of cayenne pepper to the marinade right before basting them on the grill.  Also, do not marinade with the lemon juice.  Add that to the mix before basting (or you will make the shrimp rubbery).  Baste often, and liberally!    This said, all of my guests thought this was the best tasting grilled shrimp they have ever had!  I have to agree...  making it again today!

nice and easy fool proof recipe.  I did add some ketchup to give it a sweet element with the spice. I also added fresh basil as some reviewers also did.  Really great especially for south beach dieters and diabetics.

We do not use the tomato paste because we did not want to open a can just for that small amount.  However, it is still the best grilled shrimp ever!

Wonderful recipe I have made twice in a week, once with shrimp and once with boneless chicken breasts.  I didn't worry about adding the lemon juice right before grilling, and instead of skewering them I just tossed them in a grill basket.  The chicken stayed really juicy - we grilled it on medium direct heat for 10 minutes each side.  The only alteration I made was to delete the salt entirely as I used really strong dark soy sauce.  Thanks - definitely a keeper.

Great recipe. I omitted the tomato paste (didn't have any) and upgraded the parsley to cilantro (cause I just love cilantro), but otherwise followed the recipe. The shrimp were a big hit. Thanks.

Better than shrimp you get at a restaurant! This was a beautifully simple and delicious marinade. I followed the recipe but increased the lemon juice since I love lemon and seafood together. I also used fresh oregano since it grows in my herb garden. Always use more fresh than dried herbs when recipe calls for dried. A few minutes on the grill and it was awesome! I made extra to have leftovers for tomorrow but ended up eating everything because it was so good!! I would love to try this marinade on chicken or fish, just marinate the fish for 30 mins max or it gets mushy. Chicken could go a couple hours. Thanks for sharing this recipe..it will now be a grilling staple!!

Very good!!! I made the marinade as written but used ketchup instead of tomato paste and only used 1# of shrimp. Boiled the rest of the marinade and served over pasta. Fantastic dish!

I don't know if it's just us, but my boyfriend and i found it extremely difficult to put the shrimp on the skewers and grill them like that! We ended up just omitting the grill and skewers from the recipe and cooking them in the skillet. It still turned out delicious :)

Wow!  Awesome shrimp, I also did potatoes w/mine - par boil potatoes, cut them around 1/4 inch thick (cool first) add them to the grill first basting w/olive oil, garlic salt, some dried oregeno, couple dashes of hot sauce, pepper & grill.  After they're done do the shrimp.  Shrimp was GREAT

Great recipe!  I made these for a cookout this weekend and they were gone as soon as I put them down on the table.  Everyone was grabbing them as fast as can be.  I made the recipe as stated.  This is awesome, thanks Robbie.  I think I will try mixing up with scallops next time.  YUM!

Yum!  Great flavor with a kick.  I ate the shrimp on a salad and used the marinade as a dressing after letting it simmer for a while.  My boyfriend at the shrimp with pasta and said it was really good as well.

Really easy and delicious.  I broiled the shrimp since it was raining and I don't have a george foreman grill, but they still turned out great.  I broiled them on a small grill on top of a pan lined with foil, and I used the drippings from the cooked shrimp (collected in the pan) to brush over them to give them more flavor.  They were really good.

This was really good. Like another reviewer, I didn't want to open a can of tomatoe paste for such a little bit (I should stock a couple itty bitty cans) so I used ketchup and it was wonderful. Actually, I liked the slight sweetness against the hot sauce. I didn't add all the oil. I made a marinated steak to go with it and served both over rice. Watch your grill - I was no where near 5 minutes for each side.

I thought this recipe was Great!, but I'm a fan of big bold flavors. My wife says that the flavor was too much, and I can see where she's coming from. I think marinating for only 30mins, or even just basting with this would be fine, as the grill adds some great taste to this as well! Thank you!

Yum. Yum yum yum yum yum.  Used a less oil, probably only about a 1/4 cup and marinated for under an hour.  Thread the shrimp through the tail and head, that way they stay put when you turn them.  5 minutes on each side on the grill was perfection.  YUM!!

It was so yummy! The tomato paste added a really great kick of flavor. I substituted a chili garlic sauce for the hot pepper, limes for the lemon, and cilantro instead of parsley. It almost had a Vietnamese flavor to it..I will definitely make it again!

Wow.  Fabulous.  Even though I goofed a little - forgot the tomato paste at first, didn't marinate for the entire time - these still came out wonderfully.  I'll be making these as my budget permits.  Thanks for sharing!

This was fantastic.  Even my 4 year old finished her plate and asked for more!  She does like spicy foods for a kid, though.  We didn't have tomato paste so we used double the tomato sauce.  It turned out wonderfully.  Like other reviewers suggested, we had angel hair on the side with the leftover marinade.  My husband thought it was a bit oily, but we agreed that it probably wasn't any more oily than a good restaurant's oil-based sauce.  Thanks for sharing a great meal!

Awesome!  I made this recipe exactly as stated and wouldn't change a thing.  Just the right amount of seasoning.  Update: I have now made this a 2nd time.  This time I sauteed in a pan with the marinade (tails off) and then tossed over linguine.  It was pretty 'hot' when all the marinade gets poured over the pasta, you might need to cut back on the hot pepper sauce. Yum!

Just made this for the DH for Father's Day.
It was a hit.  I served it over angel hair pasta tossed with a little oil olive.  I also heated petite cut tomatoes with chopped fresh basil,Italian seasonings and a very small amount of sugar and tossed this with the pasta to.
What a great blend of flavor with the marinated shrimp.

MAKE THESE SHRIMP! Wow! These shrimp are absolutely delicious! I used the large shrimp I could find (Using the "Grill Cuts" and leaving the shell on during grilling worked well for me). I let them marinade for at 4-5 hours... however adding the lemon juice 15 minutes before grilling. My guests who hate shrimp ate these up. Thanks so much for the perfect shrimp marinade!

I made this for my fiance and his friend for dinner and it turned out great.  I followed the recipe to plan, but added a little extra hot sauce.  We grilled the shrimp and also grilled some chicken with it.  We made angel hair pasta and mixed some extra marinade in with the marinara sauce.  It was excellent.  There were definitely no left overs that night!

Shrimp cooked up nicely -- snappy on the outside and fleshy in the inside.  Flavors, however, although good were not pronounced enough.  Probably would not cook again.

Good! Served wtih pasta, chopped sundried tomatoes, and a shredded mixture of goat cheese and Parmesan.  Could have been a tad more spicy for us - next time I'll add a dash of hot pepper flakes.  Gilled it in the basket - didn't bother with the skewers.

Very good.  And a note to those who are "ticked off" by people who change and then rate recipes:  I rate the recipe and state what I did differently so I have that info the next time I make it.  Also, if most reviewers suggest something, there is probably a very good reason for it.  If you always make the recipe as stated, don't read the reviews and you will not end up "ticked off".

3 stars because I didn't like it very much, but the rest of my family went bonkers over it. I mixed it with raw shrimp in a Ziploc bag and froze them for a couple weeks. By the time we grilled them they were VERY flavorful and marinated!

This shrimp is delicious! Followed the recipe exactly.  Let frozen shrimp thaw in a bag with the marinade all day, then threw them in a "fish basket" on the BBQ.  Served with angel hair pasta and corn.  Wonderful!

This is hands down the best grilled shrimp recipe ever.  The only change I made is using ketchup instead of tomato paste simply because it is easer to squirt out 1T of ketchup then it is to open a can of tomato paste just for 1T.  I have also cheated and bought shrimp that was already skewered, just don't cook those skewers marinated in oil over direct heat.

I've put this together ahead of time and brought it to several cookouts this summer.. it never made it to the table at any of them! Everyone raved about it. I used ketchup the last time and I couldn't tell the difference. Keeper!

This is so good I make it all the time to bring to cook outs. I make everything ahead (except for the lemon juice) place in a zip lock bag. About a half hour before grilling I add the lemon juice everyone love it.

Absolutely delicious!  And, I forgot to reserve some marinade for basting, and it was still fantastic.  Can't wait to make it again w/o any mistakes, but can't imagine it tasting any better!

Yum! Yum! This was the most delicious shrimp I have ever made at home. The first time I made them, I prepared them exactly as the recipe states. This time I prepared the marinade without the lemon and added the shrimp as I peeled them. I tossed them to coat thoughly and put them single layer on a jelly roll pan. I drizzled them with the lemon juice and broiled for 5 minutes. Fast and just as delicious. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was fantastic!  I just had a barbecue to celebrate my new backyard and my friends loved this receipe.  I also made it with chicken but the taste was not as good but am willing to give it another try with the chicken.  Maybe I marrinated the chicken too long.

This was fantastic!! I have been looking for a great grilled shrimp recipe for quite some time, but nothing is ever quite right - until I found this. It's simple and you couldn't ask for better esults. I was out of skewers, so I put the shrimp in one of those grilling basket things and it worked just fine. I'd recommend this to anyone! :)

Awesome shrimp marinade!  I've made it twice with great results.  The first time unexpected company showed up and the two pounds spread nicely with steak.  Everyone LOVED it.  My daughter took the recipe and made it for collage friends, some who didn't like shrimp, again everyone LOVED it.  I make the recipe as stated except I throw the lemon peel in with the marinade.  I think the Hot sauce is the secret! Absolutly the BEST!  Thank you, Colorado Shrimp lover

Excellent!! I always get a ton of compliments when I make these shrimp.  The only changes I made was I used more garlic and hot pepper sauce.  I did cut down on the oregeno a bit.  The spices blend perfectly with this dish!!

Excellent!  You don't taste any one ingredient, they all just blend so nicely. I did take the previous advice and did not marinade the 2 hours due to the shrimp "cooking" in the lemon juice.

I have made this twice in the past 2 weeks and my husband and I LOVE IT! Even my 17 month old couldn't get enough. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly. WONDERFUL! The second time I didn't have tomato paste and fresh garlic, so I used Ketchup and garlic powder. I also left the "jackets" on the shrimp. It was fun to peel them off as we had an outdoor meal. Really seemed to enhance the flavor too. Great recipe, thanks!

We loved this.  The only thing I did differently was to use ketchup instead of tomato paste.  This was so easy and tasty...definitely will make this again and again.  It wasn't even too spicy for my little ones.

I actually didnt follow this recipe exactly but what I ended up with I am giving five stars. I didnt have tomato paste or ketchup so I didnt use either, my husband doesnt really like tomato sauces anyway. I put in a little extra hot sauce (Louissiana) which may not have been necessary, i added lemon zest as was suggested, and a little bit of chili powder. I used already cooked shrimp which allowed me to use the rest of the marinade as a dressing and I served it over spinach. Oh I also didnt grill it or use skewers, instead I just heated it on the stove. It was great! My extremley picky husband really liked it.

This was the best shrimp I ever tasted.  Better than restaurant shrimp!  I didn't have parsley, so I used fresh chopped chives, and I also used smoker wood chips in my gas grill.  I served the shrimp over spaghetti and my homemade tomato sauce.  Yum!

EXCELLENT! Even my husband, who's not a big shrimp fan, loved the flavor. Definitely a "keeper" recipe.

Delicious!  My husband loved it.  I had to cut back on the hot sauce for my 7 year old (who loved it BTW).  Next time I'll just give him chicken fingers and kick up the heat!  Added bonus:  boil the left over marinade and dip fresh bread in it, YUMMY!   Thanks for the recipe.

This marinade is amazing - not only on shrimp but also chicken and beef.
I have made it following the recipe to a T and it's great, but my own personal preference is to use half the oil, and to substitute key lime juice for the lemon.

Very tasty marinade.  It's too cold to grill here - so I just sauteed the shrimp until pink.  Everyone enjoyed it - I'll make again.

I used frozen, pre-cooked shrimp and added some vegetables on the skewers and it was a fantastic and very fast meal to make!  I used a little less hot sauce.  Will definitely from now on whenever I grill shrimp.

These are delicious and easy.  I marinated them 4 or 5 hours, and they were excellent.  Good recipe for appetizers for company, since everything but the grilling can be done ahead.  I used a grill basket for mine, so needed no skewers. Everyone loved them.

I have made this recipe dozens of times since 2007 when I first printed it. I still believe only 1/4 to 1/2 cup of oil is plenty. And I don't bother to brush the shrimp with any reserved marinade. It cooks so quickly (usually 3 minutes per side) and the concentrated marinade, by using less oil in the marinade, gives it plenty of flavor. Many times I have marinated the shrimp only a few minutes and still get great results. One of my favorite recipes for entertaining.

Absolutely delicious ,wouldn't change  a thing,I personally didn't have the need to brush again while cooking .However like many I skipped the lemon juice and just used the zest.Plenty of lemon flavor and just the right amount of heat,by no means would I consider this spicey.

Made this last night exactly as written, and it was incredible. Lots of flavor. I marinated for an hr and cooked the shrimp on skewers in the oven since my grill wasn’t working. Definitely recommend using fresh parsley!

I am not a fan of shrimp, but I had all of the ingredients so I made it for my husband. It was very simple to make the marinade.  I too only added the zest of the lemon to the marinade.  The shrimp grilled up nicely on the kebobs.  I made an accompanying kebob loaded with peppers, onions, & pineapple.  We sprinkled lemon juice on the finished shrimp and served everything with Spanish rice and grilled ciabatta bread.  My husband loved the shrimp, and ate two complete kebobs full.  Easy, nutritious, and delicious.

I am a total shrimp lover, and loved this! Just wished I had bought even larger shrimp.
My guy doesn't care for shrimp, so used the marinate on a chicken breast for him. One substitution. I used ketchup instead of tomato paste since I was making only half the recipe and didn't want to open a can for so little paste.  
Cutting out carbs lately, so served it with grilled romaine rather than pasta. Great combo!

I made this recipe as-is and it was great. I cooked this ahead of time for NYC's annual Dîner en Blanc outdoor dinner and it still tasted great at room temperature hours later. It was simple to prepare and the end result paid off! Fellow diners were sampling this and loved it- it was one of the dishes that went fast.

This shrimp recipe is excellent.  Only thing I did different was used parsley and basil instead of the oregano.  My husband is not a fan of oregano.  I did not put the lemon juice in the marinade either since I let the shrimp marinade for 3-4 hours.  Put the lemon juice on after we cooked the shrimp.  Everyone raved about.  This is a keeper recipe.

So incredibly yummy! I wait until that last 10 minutes to put the lemon in. Lemon changes the texture and can make the shrimp more rubbery.

I reserved some of the marinade prior to adding the shrimp to use to separately to marinade and baste the vegetables. 
I marinaded the vegetables  (zucchini, sweet onion wedges, multi-colored bell peppers, crookneck squash and mushrooms)for about twenty minutes before skewering and grilling them. The vegetables took a little longer to cook, so they went on the grill first. 
The shrimp was good, but the vegetables were better; especially the mushrooms!

Excellent.  Didn't use the full amount of hot sauce - could definitely keep as written for next time.  This was excellent.

Very tasty!  I did cook it in the marinade which tasted great but when I added the pasta to the mixture I soon realized that it made it very oily. I wouldn't recommend doing that but it was still yummy.  I wanted a saucy dish and although it was it was just too much oil...still working out how I can keep the flavor of the marinade but of course have less oiliness...maybe less marinade and mix with chicken broth and more lemon?  I am definitely going to try again to get it where I want it and I will be trying this on chicken as well.

Thanks Robbie for bringing this recipe into my world, it has made me look like a gourmet chef. It's soooo good, used Sriracha for the hot sauce and have stopped adding salt, one batch was too salty ( may have added a tbs not tsp.... Too many beers while prepping:) Have given this link to a ton of friends after they asked how to make it. Seemed like a weird mixture to me but trust the recipe... It will be the highlight of a cookout.

This is the BEST shrimp we have ever made at home...or had!  I even "cheated" and used ketchup, dried parsley, and garlic from a jar.  Awesome recipe!

The second time I made this recipe I forgot to tell the associate to just remove the vain and they tasted a little different. Overall I love this recipe!!!

This was a great recipe! I was also worried about using the pepper sauce, but no worry was needed. The combination of the tomato paste and the pepper sauce was very tasty and not to overpowering. I might try using some fresh basil the next time around. I always make the original recipe and make changes from there. There are many things you can do with this recipe!! ENJOY.

I was blown away with this recipe. The only addition image as a 1/4 cup of cilantro in the addition to the parsley. I also used ketchup instead of tomato paste as another reviewer suggested. Absolutely delicious  and soooooo easy ? Don't over marinate and don't over cook!

I doubled this recipe for 5lbs of shrimp that I made at a party.  Needless to say I got to try 1 shrimp (to make sure they were done).  People that don't usually like sea food at two or more skewers and a dozen have asked for this recipe.  Great job to the author of this recipe. I made NO CHANGES and have no regrets about that.  Perfect as is!

I liked this, but my husband and son loved it!!! I would even dare to add a little more hot sauce if you like a little more spice or even crushed red pepper.  The recipe was very good and I will definitely make it again.  Thank you.

I made both chicken and shrimp kebabs with this recipe and arguably the chicken was better. I added (unmarinated) pineapple to the skewers and it was all delicious!

Wow!  I made these for Mother's Day and there wasn't s single shrimp left.  I used ketchup instead of tomato paste but otherwise followed the recipe.  The shrimp cooked so quickly there wasn't any time for basting but they didn't need it.  I wasn't sure about the hot sauce because my in-laws don't like spicy food but I used the 2 tablespoons and it was perfect.  This is now my go to grilled shrimp recipe.

Made this today on a gas grill for Father's Day dinner. Followed the directions to a T. Well, everyone loved it.....I mean Loved it!. Next time, I will make 4 pounds. We all wanted more, even though this was the appetizer. We all agreed, we could have just this and not the porterhouse that came a little later. Even my mother in law, who never gives a good word about anybody's cooking raved about this. She even went so far as to ask me to make the marinade so she can make it on the grill for tomorrow night's dinner. SIX STARS ALL AROUND......young and old.......WE LOVED IT,

I really liked these, although I got smaller shrimp which made for a very long prep of skewering them all before putting them on the grill.

My enormously picky fourteen-year-old son said this was the best shrimp he has ever had.  I made the recipe as written.  Everyone in my family loved it.  I have made it several times now.  I even served it over a salad.  It helps if you use some of the marinade over the salad.  You can set some aside or, if you have a skillet, try cooking it that way.  Then the juices don't get lost.  So good!

Made this recipe because it sounded easy.  OMG!! Not only was it easy, but the shrimp was tender and moist and company was impressed.  Served over bed of rice medley and a side of steamed asparagus and salad greens.  Thank you, thank you Robbie.

Made this for the wife as a mid day snack and she LOVED them!!! I used ketchup instead of tomato sauce and lemon zest instead of juice because I only marinated for about 30 minutes. The zest really does make a difference. Made more that evening for my sons and they are already asking for more! Would love to try it again strictly by the recipe. I only gave 4 stars BC I omitted and subed some items so to be fair, I gave it 4, but they are by far the best grilled shrimp I've ever had!!!!

Made this recipe with the addition of another clove of garlic and some added hot sauce since we like a bit more bite.  Served to another couple with a rice dish, salad and garlic bread and it got great reviews from our guests.   This one goes in the recipe box.

Thank-you so much for this recipe. Very best grilled shrimp we have ever had. 
I.have 2 comments:
1. Do not worry about marinating shrimp.too long in lemon. Due to unavoidable circumstances, I.was.forced to marinated 4hrs....no mushy shrimp.
2. I made recipe exactly as written, except for timing issue, as explained. Next time, and there will be many next times, I will reduce the salt in the marinade. Personal preference. Again, thank-you, Robbie for sharing this wonderful recipe. KB

This might be a 3 1/2 star recipe.  I've cooked over 25 years, but this was the first time I tried grilling uncooked shrimp. I used only 1 tablespoon of hot pepper sauce, but it still overpowered the taste of the shrimp.  I'm not a fan of hot sauce, so I may add only a dash or completely skip it next time. I also never tried using shrimp with the tail on, and the ones I bought at Walmart were peeled and deveined but had the shell still on, even tho the package just said 'tail on'.  The shell was cut and came off easily enough, but I would use peeled, deveined with tail off next time, provided I could find them.  I did use fresh cut pineapple in between the shrimp on the skewers as another review suggested, and it was delicious.

I followed this recipe exactly and found it to be incredibly salty - to a unpalatable degree. I think it has a huge amount of potential and I will use it again (with at least 1/8 the salt).

I also wouldn't be surprised if there was something I didn't do that may have made it saltier (I don't know, rinse the shrimp better??). I am most definitely a noob, or n00b if you will.

amazing!!!  My entire family including kids loved it.  I didn't have chile sauce so I added a small amount of chile de arbol powder.  I also added dried rosemary which my mother taught me is incredible on most sea food and i added some good italian seasoning.  I marinaded it for 4 hrs.  And I boiled the marinade ,befor i basted the shrimp, for five minutes to bring out the flavors.  I'm a very picky chef and this was hands down the best shrimp marinade I have ever had!!!

This marinade is wonderful, but I did make some personal preference changes.. I only used 1/3 cup olive oil, and added 3 more cloves of garlic (can there be too much garlic...nope!) and subbed ketchup for the tomato paste.  I marinated for one hour and the shrimp was already starting to 'cook' from the acid in the lemon juice.  The biggest difference was that I poured the shrimp with all the marinade directly into a large saute pan over medium heat.  I turned the shrimp after 2 minutes and sauteed just two minutes more.  The outcome was delicious!  The 'sauce' of the marinade was fabulous served over the accompanying jasmine rice. Yummy!

My husband said this was the best shrimp he has ever had.  I did change a few things - forgot to get lemons so no lemon juice, didn't have tomato paste so used ketsup, 1/2 tsp of oregano (2 seemed like it would be overpowering) and only 1 tbsp of hot pepper sauce.  Very easy to make - this one is a keeper!!

The recipe was superb! yes I made a change.  I skipped the tomatoe paste because I didn't feel like opening a can for just 1 tablespoon.  I used really big shrimp 16 = 1-1/2# and once I got the grill hot turned it to low and grilled them on the low heat. Because they were so big they didn't cook too quickly and they were able to develop a great grilled flavor as I watched over them with the basting brush and a glass of wine! If you can get the big shrimp you have more grill time to pick up the flavor without risking over cooking.

This was delicious!!! I didn't have tomato paste so I used ketchup and I added some red pepper flakes to give it a kick.  Marinated the shrimp for about an hour and it turned out perfectly.  We would make this hands down again!!  I even bet this would be great on chicken!

This was really good. I used fresh garlic and instead of tomato paste, I used regular tomato sauce(only a couple table spoons) because I didn't have any tomato paste. It came out excellent! 

They were a little dry after grilling but I poured the rest of the marinade over them and let it sit a few minutes and it was great!

Yippeee I finally found a grilled shrimp marinade that I really love!!!  I thought I had lemons but no, I had limes.  Was still wonderful with lime juice. Can't imagine how yummy it will be with lemon next time we grill.  Thanks for the awesome recipe :D

this recipe is definitely similar to an upscale fine dining restaurant!
I've made it 3 times now (exact recipe) &  always a hit with family.  My note to add, is that our grocery store now has tomato paste in a tube to make it easy to just squeeze out (1 Tablespoon), what you need, then refrigerate the opened tube...what a wonderful idea!  I found the tubed paste in the grocery aisle with the canned tomato paste, hope this helps!

Very good recipe!  I made it tonight on my gas grill and took the advice of another reviewer, only did 1 lb of shrimp and some chicken tenderloins as well. VERY tasty - I wouldn't change a thing! The hot sauce gives it a kick for sure :)

I marinated it too long with the lemon juice added, but everyone absolutely loved it. My husband though grilled shrimp would be better with no marinade and we have tried that 3 times since with no great compliments....

This recipe for shrimp was just average.  Good flavor but nothing special. It may be pretty spicey for the little ones too.

Absolutely great!  We use this recipe as an appetizer rather than a main meal and adjust the measurements accordingly.  Also, we always take the tails off before cooking - easier to eat.

Delicious!  Shrimp is not one of my favorite foods, however, this recipe is wonderful.  One of my guests remarked that it needed more garlic but to me the seasoning is perfect.

It was the hit of our bbq.  We are going to try the marinade with haddock this weekend.  It has just the perfect amount of seasoning and flavors.

I've made these twice in the past three weeks. My boyfriend and I both really loved this recipe and added it to our regular "rotation". I didn't change the ingredients at all, but I did throw everything in a freezer bag to marinate. After about an hour, I dumped the whole thing into a frying pan over medium-high until the shrimp were no longer translucent. I served them over rice with snow peas on the side. Couldn't be easier! I'm definitely making this for my next dinner party.

This has to be the most awesome recipe for grilled shrimp I have ever fixed or eaten!! I used the leftover marinade to make bruschetta, but you have to use it right away; brush the baguette pieces with a little olive oil, put shredded mozarella on top, cook at 350 until cheese is melted, then brush with marinade. Yum!! We put any leftover shrimp on top, more yum!!

VERY GOOD!!  I followed the recipe as written, but I only made 1/4 of the marinade for  10 oz. of shrimp and used fresh oregano instead of dry.  Rather than skewering, hubby grilled ours in a grill pan.  In hindsight I should have taken the tails off because I served it over Garlic Pasta, also from this site, and the tails made it difficult to eat with the pasta.  We both enjoyed this and we'll definitely be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Good marinade, but dominated by the hot sauce, in our case Franks red hot buffalo (med heat); since we are fans of that stuff it was just fine. I thought that 1 t each of black pepper and salt was overkill, too, but marinades are supposed to be more intense than sauces after all. I used half of the oil and added a bit of water to cover mushrooms and tomatoes as well; served this with rice and a green salad-very nice.   After simmering awhile it did indeed make an excellent dipping sauce for crusty Italian bread fresh out of the oven..mmm. I might tweak it a little for that application in the future.

Great, Powerful Flavor!  I prefer using the Vietnamese Chili Garlic Sauce instead of the hot pepper sauce. I also add a couple drops of Sriracha hot sauce if I really want extra heat.

Great easy recipe! I was looking for something I could do with shrimp but with ingredients I already had around the kitchen.  The only thing I didn't have was tomato paste but tomato sauce worked just fine.  I also cooked it on my george foreman.  It's a very adaptable recipe.

Excellent!!!  Picky husband loved and even 2 yr old couldnt get enough.  Followed recipe exactly except added ketchup instead of tomato paste only because I had none.  Did what other reviewers said and added lemon juice the last 30 minutes.  Will definitely be making this again......alot.

Recipe is awesome.  I didn't have time to heat the grill for a party, so I added some corn starch for a thickening agent and pan fried them.  Nothing but compliments all night.

This is excellent.  I always change things up to my tastes, but this one I can do as written.  Things I have changed are: substitute lime juice instead of lemon, omit the oregano, and add less of the tomato paste.  Will be making fore year to come.

Nice spicy shrimp, and happy to find a recipe that doesn't call for butter.  I cooked mine in a grill pan on the stove, then heated the marinade to boiling and mixed everything with some seashell pasta.

I made this as-is and it came out wonderful! My kids even liked this recipes and they are not big shrimp eaters. I think next time I will use cilantro instead of the parsley to give a mexican flare.

This was great!  Someone mentioned Chardonay so I had a glass and forgot to add the tomato paste and it was still great.  I used fresh oregano so I doubled the amount.  Made this and served over forbidden rice for hubby's birthday along with a tomato/avocado/mozarella salad drizzled with balsamic reduction.  Saved in  My Recipes for future reference and I'll try to remember to add the tomato paste/sauce next time.  Bon Appetite!

WOW...what great flavor!  This is a killer recipe.  I had 1 lb of shrimp so I halved the recipe.  Used the marinate to baste the shrimp as well as some grape tomatoe and yellow squash kabobs on the grill.  The vegies turned out great as well.  The shrimp were out of this world.  I didn't change the recipe at all, but did a 5 hour marinade, so the zing of the pepper sauce really showed through.  I will be making this again.

Wonderful meal. This recipe is so flavorful and juicy. I refrigerated the shrimp after grilling & made cocktail sauce to go with the shrimp but it went untouched! FABULOUS and yes I will make it again. No need to be scared of the hot sauce I only put in 1 tbs myself but you couldn't even taste it it is just for flavor.

Love this recipe! We have had this twice inside 2 weeks. Don't alter at all it is perfect! Remember not to add the lemon juice until just before you grill so your shrimps don't get chewy from the acid.

This recipe was great....only one problem.  The recipe says to discard the marinade.  It is then to be used to baste the shrimp.  The instructons should say to keep the marinade for basting.

Easy and delicious.  Reduced the amount of lemon juice so the shrimp wouldn't cook in the marinade.  Served over lemon-pepper pasta for a simple and fabulous dinner.

Even my picky 9 year old devoured two skewers of these!  I ended up with only half a skewer, because my family went nuts for these. Next time, I'll double the recipe. Only change I made was cutting the hot sauce in half. Excellent flavor, thanks!

We enjoyed these....ate 2 lbs between the two of us.  We ended up putting the steaks back in the fridge and just had shrimp.  Next time I will use lime juice instead of lemon to make it more "key westie."

I followed this recipe almost exactly. I didn't have tomato paste so I used 2 TBSP of ketchup instead. Was very good. Also I served this with linguini  with a sauce made from the remainder of the marinade and about 1.5 cups of broth made b cooking the shrimp shells with about 1.5 quarts of H2O, salt, pepper and a pinch of cayenne. I simmered the shells for about 30 min. I used 1.5 c broth, leftover marinade and boiled it for about 10 min and then simmered for 20-30 min. I added this to linguini, added 1/4 c fresh parmesan and served. M family went wild for this, it was so good. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Wow, were these shrimp yummy!  I only had time to marinate these for 1 1/2 hours, but they picked up the flavor just fine.  I cut back on the hot pepper sauce because of my little ones, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  My 4 yr. old and even my 15 month old couldn't get enough!  Thanks so much for sharing.

So simple and so yummy!  Made this for a Memorial Day BBQ and it was a huge hit!  I used another reviewer's suggestion and doubled the marinade to use as the pasta sauce, and let the shrimp marinate for one hour.  Everything turned out fantastic, thank you for a perfect recipe!!

These are the BEST shrimp I have had besides some seafood I had down south, but they taste almost identical!  I substituted fresh spices for dried, and lemon, for juice, I also omitted the tomato paste, but they were just amazing! I left the shell on and it kept them from overcooking while i grilled.... they were just awesome!!! i can't wait to make them again!

This is a great recipe!  I followed it pretty closely but only marinated for about 45 minutes.  Then, after I skewered the shrimp, I brushed some more of the marinade on before sticking them in the broiler.  I broiled them on one side for 3 minutes and the other side for another minute, minute and a half, and they were perfect!  Just the right amount of spice and flavor.  I also added some lemon zest like another reviewer suggested.  A definite keeper!

My family seemed to really like this. I cut back on the hot sauce, as a number of family members do not like spicy food and I thought 2 tbsp would be too much for them. Otherwise, I follwed the recipe as written. Thanks!

Made at Jeff's and served over pasta.  Seasoning was good but not enough flavor for the pasta.

This was excellent.  My in-laws came over for dinner and I made this along with Rib Eye Steaks with a Soy and Ginger Marinade and Missy's Candied Walnut Gorgonola Salad from this site.  It turned out great!!  My hubby said he wants the shrimp done this way every time.  I used precooked frozen (thawed) shrimp and grilled them for about 2 min. on each side and did not see a need to baste them.

Wow, what a favorful recipe! We absolutely loved it. I made this as written but doubled the marinate, saved half, warmed it up a bit and tossed it with some angel hair pasta and serviced the shrimp on top. Delish!

I can't even begin to tell you how good this is.  I do let it marinade overnight, which seems to let the flavors come together better.  I have made this several times and tried other recipes, and it's hard to beat this recipe. If you haven't tried it yet, your missing out!

I have a really good commercial marinade I like for shrimp, so I rarely actually use a recipe.  However, I did try this one and it is absolutely wonderful.  My whole family loved it.  It isn't that much more work and definitely worth the effort!

These shrimp were really good. Next time I'll probably add citrus to help make the flavor pop a little more. I've had better but this was definitely good.

My grocery gave away a free pound of HUGE butterflied shrimp with the purchase of porterhouse... needless to say I was hurriedly picking a grill recipe.  I didn't have 2 hours to marinate, and I had to sub chili powder for hot sauce (guestimated amount).  This was a hit!  Thanks, Robbie.

Absolutely delicious!  I cooked angel hair pasta and put butter and a few sprinkles of Mrs. Dash on that, then put the shrimp on top and it was awesome! I served it with asparagus on the side.  The only thing I'd do differently next time is add a bit less salt.

This turned out amazing.  I used the frozen shrimp from Costco and threw all of the marinade ingredients into the ziploc bag the shrimp come in.  I have also tried baking these in the oven as a scampi over angel hair pasta.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Didn't have tomato paste on hand, and it was still awesome! I used the uncooked easy-peel shrimp that comes in a resealable bag, and dumped the marinade right in there, resealed it, and threw it in the fridge! Couldn't have been easier! Will make again for sure!

A very good grilled shrimp recipe.  I cooked the shrimp in foil because I couldn't find my skewers, and I also added extra hot sauce.  If you have leftovers, I highly suggest making shrimp salad sandwiches out of them.  It's really tasty!

These shrimp are fabuous! My wife and I consider ourselves seafood snobs and we couldn't find anything wrong with this recipe. I liked the idea of one of the reviewers about freezing the leftover tomato past in tablespoon sizes for later use so that none goes to waste! Thanks Robbie!

This is a really good recipe, and we loved our meal! If you like spicy food, I would suggest that you triple or quadruple the hot sauce, because the amount suggested in the recipe just did not do it for us! I would not count that as a detraction, since it was easily remedied, but it's something to keep in mind if you want your food to have more of a kick!

Yum!  I almost left out the tomato paste b/c I thought it would be weird, but I'm glad I put it in, it brought the flavor up a few notches!  I cooked them in a pan since I don't have a grill, and it turned out nice.  Next time I will cut back on the oil to 1/2 or 3/4 C since I didn't grill them.

This was extraordiarily good!!  I reserved half of the sauce to serve over angel hair pasta.  My family found the pasta a little too lemony, but personally Ithought it was a very fresh, light flavor.  Thanks A LOT for this one!

These were excellent, I've now made them twice.  It just seemed to be missing a little something and I haven't put my finger on it quite yet. All-in-all though, very tasy and a great grilling recipe to add to the rotation this summer.

OMG! By far the best shrimp recipe I have found. The only change I made was I used Ketchup instead of the tomato paste. I think it adds a little sweetness to balance the spice of the hot sauce. Marinating for an hour or two is key. I've made them three times in the past two weeks. Perfect!

Sooo good!  Made for Mother's Day lunch.  We used frozen shrimp and it made them taste so fresh--no fishy or strong shrimp flavor.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The BEST!  I usually have a hard time getting marinade to stick to shrimp when grilling.  It either slides off or cooks off.  Not with these beauties (I think it's the tomato paste that does it).  Make sure you douse them once or twice with the leftover marinade while they are on the grill and they will come out perfect, juicy, and tasty.  Hands down the best grilled shrimp I have made at home and just as good as or better than most fried shrimp I've had.

Served this to a group of 14 and everyone loved it.  The only thing I changed was that I used catsup instead of tomato paste and crushed red pepper flakes instead of the hot sauce.  I also marinated scallops and they turned out great.  I'll use this marinade again and again!  Thx!

This was way too salty, I also made the grilled chicken kabob recipe from this site and found that marinade to be far superior and would use it for the shrimp and veggies next time i do kabobs, the family also agreed the chicken recipe was a keeper!

Amazing shrimp appetizer!! I marinated the shrimp all day (adding the lemon juice 1/2 hr. b4 cooking) &  sauteed them on the stove (not quite grilling weather in Vermont just yet : ). Tremendous flavor & super easy to make.

Absolutely wonderful! I used chili sauce instead of ketchup substitute as others and it was still delicious! I cooked up extra and freeze in little baggies to top salads. These will be fabulous.

nice marinade...used ketchup in lieu of tomato paste and this marinade gives you that classic grilled shrimp flavor you taste in most restaurants.

OH MY SWEET JESUS!! I recently served these skewers as the first course at a banquet and people raved.  I threaded sun dried tomato in between the shrimp to give it another element and color.  Everyone loved it.

Not that this recipe needs another 5-star review, but it was so awesome that I had to say something.  The only changes I made were to use only 1/4c of olive oil (I mean, it's good for you, but not THAT good), I used ketchup instead of tomato paste, and I only used about a pound of shrimp.  My boyfriend RAVED about it and I thought it was just a great all around marinade.  Will definitely make again!

Excellent shrimp.  Great for guests as it can be made a few days ahead and can then be frozen.  I have tried adding the barbeque sauce as some recommended and thought it took away from the flavor.  I have even sauteed them in a skillet one day and they were awesome (although my house stunk for 2 days).  Great recipe and regular at our house.

Another Great simple recipe !!  We only marinated for about 30 minutes due to time constraints.  When you are still raving about what you ate 5 hours later, It must be great !!  This and the Basil Shrimp (allrecipes) are super dishes.

This was a winner! I used ketchup like many others because it was open and in the fridge. Also, I didn't have any parsley so used fresh basil and I cut way down on the hot sauce because I was cooking for the kids too. Everyone loved it! I will reserve a little more marinade next time because we used it for a sauce on the pasta I served with it which was great.

What an amazing marinade.  I cut everything in half since I made very few shrimp, but it came out wonderful!  I can imagine this would be good on just about anything!

Very good flavor. I added more garlic & hot sauce to my marinade. Then after it was done marinating I sauteed mine in a mixture of a little butter, garlic, olive oil and Tiger brand sauce. Yum!

This recipe was great!  I would lessen or even omit the oregano next time, it gave the shrimp a kick-back flavor I didn't care for, but other than that... awesome shrimp marinade.

Shrimp was fantastic!  I didn't have any fresh parsley on hand so used dried, i also used extra garlic for us garlic eaters and instead of the tomatoe paste, I too like most others used the ketchup. With these changes and I wouldn't say they were overwhelming taste changing changes, the shrimp was loved by all 5 of us who ate it.

Love this recipe! I only changed one thing--I added scallops to the shrimp and it worked wonderfully! Next time I may redcue the oregano a touch and step up the hot sauce--but as written, it's still super yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone loved this! I substituted about 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce for the tomato paste which gave it a sweet/spicy kick. I got frozen uncooked peeled shrimp from Trader Joe's, thawed and marinated it. This will be a regular fixture in our house!

Used the suggestions noted, substituted Katsup for the tomato paste, and added the lemon zest.  I used Tobasco sauce instead of red pepper sauce (not sure if there is a difference) and it was really spicy.  Next time, I'll only use 1/2 of the tobasco.  Great Recipie, it was a crowd pleaser!

Very good marinade for the shrimp! Tangy, garlicky, with just a little tomato flavor for balance. I will definitely make this again.

This was easy and delicious!  Remember to baste the shrimp once grilling to keep the shrimp from getting dry or use tin foil underneath to keep in the moisture.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is awesome.  I substituted the tomato paste with ketchup as one suggested and it added just the right amount of sweetness.  Be careful not to overcook the shrimp.  I was sucking the juice out of the tail.  It was so good.

Very good!! Very easy to play with ingredients to suit personal taste...like more hot sauce and lemon. My shrimp were not very large, so I did cut the grilling time down. Thanks for the recipe!

I made the recipe as is with the exception of using ketchup instead of tomato paste.  I wasn't sure how it would turn out since the taste of the marinade alone was not my faviorite.  When the shrimp was grilled, though, they were simply delicious!  I think I'll try chicken or salmon next.  Thanks for the great marinade!

I liked the taste of the marinade, but the shrimp was dry. I used cooked shrimp, and I think that was a mistake. If I try this again, I'll use raw shrimp. Hopefully it'll make a difference.

THIS WAS PRETTY GOOD EXCEPT I MAY HAVE ADDED TO MUCH SALT.  i WILL TRY AGAIN.
Update:  I made this again last night and it was def worth 5 stars.  I added some lime juice as well as the zest from the lime and the lemon.  I also did not add the oregano but added some chopped fresh cilantro and I used ketchup instead of tomato paste.  I also marinated the shrimp in all the ingredients except the lemon and lime juice for about 2-3 hours and then I added the lemon/lime juice and let the shrimp marinate for and addtional 45 min to an hour.  My kids couldnt get enough of it.  Next time I will def have to double the recipe or serve with steak.

This is truly a five star recipe. When I saw all the reviews, I thought there must be something to it. There is and you will be very glad you tried it. I followed the recipe and made no changes. It works as advertised without extra help. Try it you will be glad you did.

I made these shrimp for a family gathering at the lake and everyone raved about them.  The only suggestion I have is to make twice as much as you think you'll need because these shrimp go FAST!

This is an awesome recipe!  I made it one night, and my husband keeps begging for it again.  I did add a little bit more garlic to the marinade.  But it was a sure fire hit.

This marinade was great!  I didn't have fresh herbs, so had to substitute with dried.  I served the prawns over a fresh spinach salad that I tossed with a vinegarette I made from some of the reserved marinade.  Just added red wine vinegar.

This was great.  I made it without the fresh parsley,I did not have any. Also used ketchup instead of tomato paste, and added the zest of the lemmon, based on the recommendations of other reviewers.  Next time I will make sure I have the fresh parsley. Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome grilled shrimp!  This was our first attempt at grilling shrimp, and it was wonderful.  Easy marinade - we used frozen shrimp which may not have been as good as fresh, but the recipe was excellent.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe.  I had to cut mine in  half because I only had one pound of shrimp.  Came out good.  Also, I could have marinated longer, and next time I will.  The flavors are good, and my kids enjoyed this too.

Great recipe.  I marinated the shrimp and then cooked them in a pan without the marinade.  I boiled the marinade and then added it all to some pasta with a vegetable.

The grill wasn't working, so I cooked it on 450 degrees for 6 minutes, following by a few minutes under the broiler.  Came out great!  I had already put the shrimp on skewers, so I used a 9 x 12 Pyrex baking dish as a rack.  No need to turn them over.

Hubby and I were looking for something yummy to cook shrimp in our air fryer. I didn't have much time to marinade the shrimp, probably gave it about 20 minutes, so I doubled the garlic, lemon, salt, pepper, and Cholula. This was SO FREAKING GOOD that I pulled out more shrimp and we're making more for later. I didn't have tomato paste, parsley, or oregano so we made this more of a lemon pepper shrimp. Thank you for sharing such a fantastic recipe!!

This recipe is spot on. So simple yet soooo good! Really good. Like if I’m on death row and I need to request my last meal good. I was surprised by the simple ingredients but was even more surprised at how delicious it turned out. I followed the recipe to a T. Irks me when people review a recipe and say how great it is “with a few of my awesome changes to it”. Follow this recipe as is. You will not be disappointed. This is a definite keeper.

This is really a great recipe. I have used it dozens of times and served it at parties. A bunch of fresh basil is what makes it stand out. I don’t recommend any other method besides grilling for this. Goes great with salad.

This is great. I added it to my shrimp recipes.  I did use ketchup as recommended by another reviewer and baked them in the oven. Delicious.  I served it over fettuccine.  It's easy and good.

My family loves this recipe.  I have made it as written and with only half the red pepper as I have someone whose tolerance of spice is variable as he undergoes chemo.  It is still spicy!  Also, I hate dealing with skewers so I just put all the shrimp on one of those vegetable/fish grill pans and sauce over the fire.  Works very well.

Reduced the amounts due to fewer shrimp. Cooked shrimp in wok with white onion and cherry tomatoes (sweated onion/tomato  removed then combined with cooked shrimp). Put mixture on bed of rice noodles. Very tasty. Great marinade!

This was great!! I only added half the amount of hot pepper sauce because I wasn't sure how spicy it would be and it was perfect. Served it on a bed of rice. Cooked on the George Foreman grill for 5 min.

OOOO-yeah. We've never been shrimp eaters, but this recipe, along with being able to grill outside (it's HOT where we live in So Cal) are opening us to a whole new direction for our menus! I followed it exactly on a package of thawed, raw jumbo shrimp, marinating it for about 4 hours, flipping it (in the fridge) about 3 times. I halved the recipe and used one pound shrimp (won't anymore...LOL), skewered them up (one pound with 10 on each skewer gave us 4 or 5 skewers), and they grilled up in only a few minutes. Total keeper recipe, and one to repeat hummm...about 100xs a summer :). You can ALWAYS find ways to use already-grilled, leftover shrimp!!!

I agree with everyone’s comments, this dish is absolutely amazing. Great mix of flavors and super easy to make. Followed the recipe almost exactly, sans not measuring a few ingredients perfectly and adding a some dashes of cayenne. Also followed another commenters suggestion and added in some lemon zest. Will definitely make again.

I thought this was very good but next time I will eliminate the salt altogether and maybe the black pepper too.  The only substitution I made was dried parsley for fresh. Will make again!

This was fairly easy and the whole family enjoyed it.  I used a little tobacco combined with some Thai Sweet Chili sauce as the hot sauce.   Just perfect.

Fantastic recipe.  I made it just as written.  I probably did add a little more chopped parsley just because I chopped more .  Husband and college-age son loved it! And used shrimp that had been in the freezer a while, and it was still super yummy.  Thank you for posting this!

This was a great option for me!  I was only working with ingredients I had in the house (it was before payday).  I substituted cocktail sauce for tomato paste in the marinade, and I used our Hamilton Beach (read: George Foreman) grill to cook the shrimp.  Very simple to construct the marinade, and I served the shrimp over linguini.  The end result was pretty good!  I'll make it again someday.

This was a fabulous recipe which I followed precisely.  The only thing I might change next time is cutting down a tiny bit on the salt.  Other than that it is perfect.  I am currently trying out more of a low carb diet plan and this is only 3.7 carbs!! Thank you so much for sharing.

I made this due to easy and the conisistent 5;star ratings! I had the easy peel raw shrimp in the freezer, thawed them out under cool running water and marinated for about 5 hours. It was easy because all of the ingredients were on hand!   Didn’t change a thing - just made more for 3 lbs.  used metal skewers on the grill to prevent the wood catching on fire - they were absolutely perfect and all were gobbled up! I did baste and turn frequently on the grill. This is a keeper and all of my guests now have the recipe! Thank you!

I have been making these forever.  I make changes to the marinade but nothing consistent.  I marinade over night and then use outdoor grille when the weather allows.  Otherwise I do them under the broiler and they are fine.  My whole family loves them.

I made this more or less as specified, except I grilled them on high heat for about 2 minutes per side to promote carmelization, as recommended in another grilled shrimp recipe on this site. They were a hit at the potluck I took them to, though I do think they were just a little overcooked. I love the combination of spices.

I've made this recipe twice, as submitted, and it is now my favorite way to prepare shrimp. Because I find it very easy to overcook shrimp I am cautious on the cooking time. In my oven I have found that broiling it  3 minutes, flipping the skewers, then broiling another 3 minutes is just right.

Was delicious … I used herbs de Provence because that’s what I had instead of the oregano and I added a little smoked paprika and cut back on the oil to 1/2 cup. I added about 1/4 of the marinade to my green beans and baked them … I’m sure this marinade would be good on just about anything … so yummy!

The shrimp were very tasty!  I was unable to grill so I put them on a grill pan in a 400 degree oven until they were cooked (10 minutes?)  I was leery about adding the tomato paste because I thought it would scream tomato but it didn't at all.

Extremely tasty and I will use again. I made absolutely no changes to the recipe for marinading the shrimp and followed the directions as stated to the letter. I did find that there was more than enough for the two pounds of shrimp and so after two hours I plucked the shrimp from the marinade and put those in another container in the fridge. Reading suggestions from other reviewers, I then added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper and one teaspoon of herbs de province to the original marinade mix and then combined with a pound of  cubed (spiked with a meat tenderizer) chicken breast which I then marinated for another two hours. Then I was ready to grill the whole boat load on my  small bucket grill using mesquite charcoal briquets at the recommended heat level. I did use slim soaked bamboo skewers. Very happy to report that both experiments turned out wonderfully.  I know this recipe is almost an ancient posting by now but thanks Rob. Another gem I will keep.

Delicious and easy.  Would make again for sure.  Substituted ketchup for tomato paste which I was a bit reluctant to do (and primarily b/c I had run out of the paste).  Marinated for two hours and intended to add the lemon in the last half hour per others' suggestions but forgot.  It was delicious anyway!

I loved this recipe. Of course, I didn’t marinate the whole time bc I waited until a hour before dinner to look for a recipe. I also subbed other fresh herbs instead of parsley bc I didn’t have any.

The marinade really made this dish!  I grilled them with some fresh yellow and red bell peppers.  I didn't find keeping the tails on all that necessary though.

This was over the top delicious. There was two of us so I used half the marinade for vegetable skewers; zucchini, grape tomatoes, red onions, whole mushrooms and red pepper. I used the other half for one pound of shrimp. You do not ever was to marinate any type of seafood for two hours if it has lemon juice in it because it will cook the shrimp. I marinated for 30 minutes. 
I will definitely make this over again and again

Perfect blend of flavors. Only modification was using dried Italian seasoning blend in place of oregano. Quick and easy too. This will be a go-to from now on.

Quick, easy and soooooo good. Only change I made out of necessity was I used sambal oelek instead of hot pepper sauce, it was what I had on hand. I also only used 1 tbsp, not 2 as recipie states for the hot pepper sauce. This will definitely be on my grill a lot this summer! Thank you for posting. P.s. I would add a photo but there was nothing left but an empty plate.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding cayenne for a little extra spice. Even with this addition it wasn’t too spicy at all. The marinade rested for probably 6 hours or so just because time got away from me. We had ours with some white rice I lightly seasoned and buttered. This shrimp will be in our regular summer grilling rotation.

So-so. I added one star to what would have been a 2-star review because I didn’t marinate it for the full two hours. However, the marinade on its own was pretty dull. On the positive side, it  didn’t ruin the excellent shrimp, but it certainly didn’t add much either.

I cut the hot sauce in half because I only like mildly spicy food.  I used the tip to sub ketchup for tomato paste for the slight sweetness.  I also pressed the garlic instead of mincing it.  It turned out fabulously.

FANTASTIC!!
My family and I agreed that we have NEVER had grilled shrimp this good at any restaurant or any other place!
I followed directions exactly but marinade came out very sour and sort of bitter.
I added more salt and Splenda till it was smoother tasting.
I could eat this everyday!!

Didn't have tomato paste, so went without it. Only change would be a little more salt to fit my taste. Truly loved it!

It turn out delicious! I used regular black pepper instead of cayenne and 1 tsp dried basil. I grill them on Foreman’s grill with some foil on one side. Cooked for 3 min and  turned only once for 3 more minutes. I combined with Mamma Rosa Pasta, made with onion, tomatoes and cream.

this was very tasty! yes i changed the recipe but i was using what i had on hand as always.. i cut the recipe in half and only used a splash of olive oil.. subbed cilantro for the parsley, 1/4 cup bottled lemon juice for the fresh, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder for the fresh and ketchup for the tomato paste .. i used the green chile habanero sauce by el yucateco as my hot pepper sauce (this stuff is burn your mouth spicy).. i marinated the shrimp for half an hour in the Marinator.. which was plenty of time.. i highly recommend using a very spicy hot pepper sauce as we loved the kick.. ty for the recipe

So simple, yet so delicious!  I used it to also marinade some vegetables (yellow squash, zucchini, cherry tomatoes and onions) then roasted them in the oven... I had a hard time saying that I was full!  Lol.  Happy cooking!

I only made this for about a pound of shrimp - prepped the raw shrimp and marinade at home - took for a camp weekend with the girls.  Mixed the shrimp and sauce together for about an hour, grilled on skewers.  I did halve the hot sauce as my one friend doesn't love spicy - so good!  Cooked up quickly in about 10-15 minutes, lots of flavor and just a touch of spice!

This turned out delicious. Wasn't able to marinate very long, but it didn't seem to matter. I drained the marinade and pan fried the shrimp in a small amount of butter and then added the sauce to the pan and brought to a boil. I used less oil in the marinade to make up for the calories in the butter. Will definitely be making again!

Wow! This was a flavorful dish that packed some punch. Not only did the adults like this, the kids liked it as well. This will most definitely be in my repertoire when we have company over to grill.

My family loved this!  I made this as written except I reduced the hot pepper sauce to about 2 teaspoons and I added the lemon juice PLUS lemon zest to the marinade. I only marinated the shrimp for an hour and it was delicious!  Served over pasta with a gen salad.   A keepe!

Made as written.  Husby, who can be picky, totally slurped it up.  He can be sensitive to spicy, but this had just the right level for him.  Really nice rolled into naan with lettuce and avocado the next day for lunch.

I made this last night and it was very good.  I was grilling potatoes first and, as I was about to put the shrimp on, I realized the gas bottle had run out.  Isn't that just maddening?!  So I put  the skewers on a sheet pan and in the oven at 350°F for 10 minutes total.  The shrimp was a little overdone but the flavor was still there.  Fantastic!

Very good quick marinade. I followed suggestion of another poster who suggested ketchup instead of tomato paste. I used a very small amount. The hot sauce I ended up using was Sirichi. May family thought the shrimp were tasty.

I made this Grilled Marinated Shrimp last night and it was a big hit! I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. To make it easier to turn the shrimp on the grill I used two wooden skewers parallel to each other to skewer through 5 shrimp - I have found when you only use one, the shrimp can spin around when you try to flip them. With two you can easily flip them. Will definitely make again!

This was really great -- everyone loved it. Only change I made was to replace tomato paste (which I didn't have) with ketchup. Fresh shrimp is a must -- I don't think this would have been as good with frozen.

Made this on kabobs on the grill for a crowd, it was a huge hit and got many many compliments! I did the recipe exact except  had no fresh lemon so used the fake lemon flavor.  I used ez peel precooked shrimp.  grilling with the light shell on kept them moist and plump and it was a cinch to remove before eating.  grilled each side for 2 mins just to heat them!  super easy!!!

Three thumbs up from my family! I cut the salt in half because we eat low-salt foods, but will consider only using 1/4 tsp. or omitting it entirely. There was plenty of flavoring and just a little salty for us, even with half the salt. Overall, great recipe for shrimp. I would make this again and again.

Followed the recipe.  Marinated for 4 hours. Quick, easy and delicious.  Highly recommend it.  Its a keeper!

Next time I may add basil and a little bit more lemon juice .

Amazing! My husband asks for this every week! Follow the recipe exactly. If you'd like it a little sweeter use catsup instead of tomato paste ??

This was wonderful! Only changes I made was to cut the amount of oil in half and used ketchup for tomato paste. Still tasted great. I took the suggestion to use a bit of the marinade to brush on romaine lettuce halves, then grill.  It was terrific and was a great substitute for rice or another starch. Next time I'll increase the hot sauce because we like more heat, but delicious as written.

My entire family said it was the best shrimp they have ever eaten. The only thing I did different was add some fresh Basil.

This is delicious! I only had time to marinate the shrimp for about 45 min, but they were very flavorful. I used siracha for the hot sauce and only about half of what was suggested and it turned out perfect for my liking. I'll also note that I accidentally used grape seed oil instead of olive oil but didn't notice until the shrimp was already marinating and I was putting the bottle away. Next time I will use the olive oil and see if it makes a difference. I made rices cauliflower as a bed for the shrimp and corn (for my husband). My husband is critical of anything new and he commented several times on how he liked the flavor so this is definitely a keeper in our house! Thank you!!!

This recipe is amazing! I followed it exactly and these shrimp are SUPER delicious! I live in Chicago and gassing up the gill was definitely out of  question, but placing them on the George Forman didnt take away from their deliciousness. This will be my go to recipe when I want shrimp!

No changes.
I don't know what hot pepper sauce they expect you to use. I used Louisiana Hot Sauce. 
Completely wonderful!!! 
Well blended flavors. Not hot, but gives a slight blast of spice.
If you want it hot then add more sauce or some cayenne.
Excellent!!!!

We grill a lot of shrimp and this marinade really hits the mark. I regularly cook for large patio gatherings,  and people always ask for the recipe.  Just remember if using large or jumbo shrimp always allow two hours minimum for flavor to penetrate.

This was an awesome shrimp dish!  I made it with the quinoa pilof recipe on this site and it was a great combination of flavors!  I put out a dipping sauce and no one used it!  This is definitely my new go-to grilled shrimp recipe. Highly recommend!

Excellent recipe.  I did not cook it on the grill (we ended up being rushed for time) but followed the marinade recipe  as written - and added a little bit of cayenne pepper seasoning.  I also held off with the lemon juice until cooking because I marinated the shrimp for several hours.  Cooked the shrimp in a hot skillet on top of the stove with the marinade and then added cooked Campanella to the cooked shrimp.  Restaurant quality recipe!  Thanks so much.

I have made this recipe many times following the recipe exactly as written!  There is no need to change anything!  One suggestion for those not wanting to open a can  of tomato paste for 1 tsp. needed in the recipe. You can buy tomato paste in a tube!  Yes, it looks like a tube of toothpaste! Using this tube of tomato paste allows you to the small amount of tp needed in recipes like this. Once opened,  it's kept in the refrigerator.  You can find it in stores like Trader Joe's, World Market, Whole Foods  etc  Hope this helps!

This was absolutely delicious!  Based on other reviews I added red pepper flakes for a bit of extra zing.  It was perfect, even for the younger eaters.  I alternated the shrimp with sliced cooked chicken sausage on the skewers which stretched out the meal to serve 7 and served with grilled quartered corn on the cob.

This was sooooooo good!  For all the reviews saying it is so salty, I just don't understand, it was fine.  I made minor changes...I doubled the garlic (hello that always makes everything better!), and used about 1.5Tbsp tomato paste (the kind with basil/oregano added in).  We cooked these indoors on a George Foreman grill and they were delicious.  We used 2# of shrimp for two people and we will be able to have leftovers.  Will DEFINITELY make this again!!

This is a wonderful shrimp recipe.  I followed the directions with the exception of a little less hot sauce as my family does not like things "really" spicy.  Excellent and so easy to prepare.

I used some cocktail sauce instead of hot pepper sauce.  We prefer the mild taste.  Easy.  Will make again, maybe next week.

Delicious recipe! First time made without hot sauce, and second with. More people liked the second time when adding half of hot sauce and it didn't make the shrimp too spicy, just enough.

My husbands not a fan of shrimp and he loves these! I throw the shrimp & marinade in a skillet then serve over creamy polenta. If you have leftovers, you can throw them on top of a caesar salad. This is a quick easy but looks like I spent forever dinner! Like other reviewers I put very little lemon but I did add zest in the marinade. Once finished, I squeezed the lemon on top.

Really enjoyed this! Easy to make and very full of flavor, yet it didn't overpower the shrimp.

Oh my gosh…insane! I forgot to get the tomato paste, but the recipe was fabulous regardless.  My husband threw the shrimp on the grill and we put it over pasta that was tossed in a bit of olive oil, fresh basil, and shredded parmesan.  He now requires it go on the weekly rotation.  Oh, and in one case I only had time to marinade the shrimp for about 30 min, and they still turned out amazeballs.  Thank you!!

This recipe is very good!! I'm not s big seafood person but definitely enjoyed the recipe. I did use almost a whole 6oz can of tomato paste but other than that I did not change anything. Our shrimp tasted like steak!! It was so good!

Fantastic, my wife and I loved it. She is still raving about it. I only had time to marinate for about 30 minutes and it was so good it makes me wonder how much better could it be with the proper time. Made as is but I did half the recipe.

Definitely will make this again. Followed the advice of sourdough girl on the grilled romaine.  Also added an herb rice dish with cannelinni beans as a side.  It was great.  Agree on making it first exactly as the recipe states.  Can always modify after.  Don't think this one needs it.

Really good marinade.  I took another's advice and added the zest of the lemon I used for the recipe.   Grilled up great!  I could see this being good as a marinade for chicken or a baste on kebabs.

This is seriously amazing.  Made exactly as prepared, we now no longer have the grocery store steam our shrimp for us!  It has a nice zip to it, but even my husband who doesn't like spicy said it was perfect.  (And he was able to grill it perfectly, and he's not exactly an expert??)

I made it according to the recipe. I threw all of the ingredients into my Magic Bullet. When I opened it up, it smelled WONDERFUL. Marinated the shrimp per the recipe and threw the shrimp on the bbq. You really didn't need to baste them afterwards. I would like to try this marinade on chicken! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Delicious! I had to use bottled lemon juice and tomato sauce instead of paste, and only had time to marinade about a half hour and they were still tasty.

I followed the recipe exactly (except cut down on the hot sauce a little) and it was just ok. Not much flavor. I don't thank that less hot sauce made that much of a difference.

Made this tonight for dinner and loved it.  Had planned on putting the shrimp on a salad but I've had salad for four nights running so treated myself to some angel hair pasta instead.  I didn't grill as it's still cold up here in Maine but sautéed everything in a pan and it was wonderful.  Will definitely make again!

Absolutely fantastic shrimp marinade.  Followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  This is our grilled shrimp recipe from now on.  I think using fresh parsley makes a big difference in taste.  Thanks for sharing.

One of my family's favorite shrimp recipes!  This always gets rave reviews from guests too.  I find it keeps the best flavor and juiciness if you grill in the shell, but it's great either way.  I usually only use about a quarter of the hot sauce it calls for - good flavor without being too spicy for kids.

I just made this for a dinner party.  The shrimp tasted great!  We served with other meats, grilled peppers and onions and had a fajita buffet.  We did use ketchup vs paste and used huge jumbo shrimp.  For hot sauce, I used habanero pepper sauce.   Our friends raved over it.  We doubled the marinade.  Will be making again.  Thank you!!

By far the best shrimp I have ever had. I agree with other reviewers who do not change a recipe in order to review it. I'm not sure I could improve upon this recipe anyway. My wife is all about seafood and she often asks me to make this recipe for her. This has also become a mainstay during our holiday celebrations. We sometimes will mix this in pasta for an outstanding shrimp Alfredo.

I used ketchup instead of tomato paste because I thought I would like the flavor better.  I marinaded my shrimp for almost 1 1/2 hours and cooked them on my stovetop grill.  They were delicious and this will be a frequent recipe I use for shrimp from now on.

I have made this shrimp twice, once using fresh shrimp and once with frozen shrimp, both times it was fantastic! I hosted a football game BBQ and this was the only dish that went over so well that there were no leftovers :-)

This marinade is absolutely delicious!! I served it over cauliflower puree and a perfectly seasoned steak (if I may say so :P). 

I HIGHLY recommend reducing the amount of olive oil though. I put 5 tablespoons the second time I made this, and I might reduce it even more the next time (flavor didn't taste different than the first time, and it's ten times healthier this way). I sauté the shrimps in a pan and put the marinade in half-way through and skim as much oil as possible. 

Thank you so much for posting this! :)

Delicious!  I let the shrimp sit in the marinade for a couple of extra hours, and it made a difference.  My 5 year old who tends to be a picky eater even loved it with his buttered angel hair pasta.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

My family LOVES this. I found using a small hibachi grill worked better than my larger grill, as it kept the shrimp closer to the coals. The marinade is amazing. I usually do 6-8 skewers, and I find 1/4 cup of reserved marinade to be a little short. I would save at least 1/3-1/2 cup.
FANTASTIC!!!

Made as written and can't wait to try it again. I forgot lemon wedges on the side but I'll have them ready next time. Super easy and quick to cook. I'm thinking I'd like to try this marinate with chicken also.

Been using this recipe for years without any major changes to original, other than just combining all of the ingredients in a large Ziploc bag, adding un-skewered shrimp into said bag, waiting until the end to add the lemon (so as to not 'cook' the shrimp), and then I will either grill them on George Foreman or simply pan fry them on top of the stove. This recipe is a staple in our home. Thanks!

OUTSTANDING!!  Followed recipe exactly as it said, and wouldn't change any of the ingredients.  The only thing I did different was I didn't use skewers.  Poured shrimp & marinade into cast iron skillet on grill & just kept stirring shrimp around until cooked--5-6 min.

I made this and another shrimp recipe on this site tonight because I couldn't decide between the two. This was so good!  I hate lemons but decided to try it anyway and oh my god was it worth it. Awesome. My only difference was ketchup instead of paste because I am not one of those people that keeps staples like tomato paste around. Amazing. Seriously.

Definitely will make this again! I made this for friends as appetizer and almost missed out on getting any for myself! My only substitute was cilantro for the parsley. I had run out of the parsley and subbed dried cilantro. Brushing the shrimp frequntly while grillng helps keep them from getting rubbery. I'd like to use this as a base fora variation of scampi next time

My favorite shrimp recipe.  It's even good leaving out the hot sauce. Only marinate for 30 minutes when there's lemon juice otherwise the shrimp starts to cook.

This marinade is absolutely fantastic! I used sriracha for the hot sauce and marinated the shrimp for about 6 hours instead of the two called for. Best grilled shrimp I have ever had by far!!!

This was really good and super quick.  Only marinated for an hour, used ketchup instead of tomato paste.  Amazed at how the flavor quickly permeated the shrimp.  So good that I finally signed onto all recipes so I could save this to my recipe box!!  Served with grilled romaine, brushing some reserved marinade, as suggested by another reviewer.  Oh, and I don't like tobasco, but this was soo good.

Didn't have the parsley or tomato paste (substituted ketchup).  Grilled on high heat for 3 minutes, basted, flipped, basted again and went for two more minutes.  Amazing flavor!  A great find for someone doing Atkins.

Yum! Followed recipe as written. Added pineapple with the shrimp on the skewers as suggested by another reviewer. Next time I will try cutting salt in half.

This shrimp was absolutely delicious!  I cut the recipe in half to serve 4 and used jumbo shrimp instead of large.  I'll cut back on the salt a little next time but it was still delicious.

I used a crushed fresh tomato, spicy brown mustard instead of the lemon and tomato paste which I was out of.  It was delicious!  I love the tomato flavor and the spicy from the hot pepper sauce and brown mustard!! I will be making this regularly!  It's now on our bi-weekly recipe rotation!

Family loved it!  Made as written this time but will cut oil in half next time.  Used Garlic Tabasco and no heat at all.  Garlic Tabasco is the least mild Tabasco you can get and it has a ton of flavor w/ the garlic. Added lemon about an hour before grilling.
I made 2 lbs, marinated 7 hours.  Will absolutely make again!!

Just made it tonight - cut recipe in half because I only had one pound of shrimp; also did not add hot sauce because my kids are weenies - and it was still a hit! Purchased deveined jumbo shrimp that still had the shells attached, and left them on, per another reviewer. I also forgot to reserve some marinade for basting. However, they stayed nice and plump, and the marinade still penetrated throughout the shrimp. Mom said it was the best meal she had at my home so far, so it's definitely a keeper!

Absolutely delicious! I used far less than 1 c of olive oil, probably closer to 1/4 c, and the shrimp were perfect.

My family absolutely loved this recipe. I changed a few things because I did not have the exact ingredients. Instead of parsley I used cilantro. I also used half buffalo wing sauce and half hot sauce. I doubled the recipe and added scallops with the shrimp to marinate. When my husband grilled it we did not use skewers. We just used a large holed pizza pan sprayed with cooking spray and placed that on the grill. It was fantastic!!

Made these on Memorial Day for something a little different.  I didn't have parsley or lemon on hand and wasn't able to let them marinate long - only about 30 mins.  These were awesome.  Very tasty, not too spicy (but a little kick) and a great pick for the warm day.  Will definitely make again...soon.

Great as is but I grow all my own herbs so used fresh everything. Do it. Fresh oregano isn't as strong a flavor. I can't stand dried, the only thing that should be used for are hoagies & pizza sauce lol...but fabulous recipe!

Holly cow my kids devoured this shrimp and my husband liked it too. This is by far the best marinated shrimp recipe I've come across. I didn't change a thing I made it exactly as stated and it turned out beautifully!

I thought this tasted okay, but honestly I am not a shrimp eater. I decided to do half the marinade, because I hate wasting marinade. In this case, I think the whole amount would have worked best. After the 2 hours, the flavor seemed to mostly just glaze the outside. They were done super quickly on the grill. No complaints from others. ty

This was so flavorful. We really enjoyed it. I used catchup instead of tomato paste. It worked wonderfully. I would highly suggest it and will make it many more times in the future.

Absolutely delicious!  I definitely agree with the user who suggested waiting to put lemon juice in; keeps it fresher.  I suggest making pasta and using a little garlic, olive oil, and basil. Then mix the shrimp and pasta. Delicious. Definitely making again

Fabulous.  The only thing I did different was add a little more salt.  I also did what another reviewer mentioned with using some of the marinade on romaine lettuce and grilled it. Yum!

Extremely tasty! Even my husband loved it and he is picky.  First thing he said was "oh, wow!"   Definitely don't add lemon until it's cooking. We added it to the marinade that we basted it with.

Because of the excellent reviews, I tried this recipe.  It is the best!  So glad I found it.  Flavors are wonderful together.  I made it exactly as directed.  Only had 1 pound of shrimp but they were large.  Having lots of marinade was advantageous since I sautéed them in a pan using a gas stove.  Pour the shrimp and marinade into the pan together. Once the marinade heats up, cook 2 minutes then flip shrimp over with tongs and cook for another 2 minutes and it's done.  The marinade becomes the sauce for the mixed rice I made to accompany the shrimp.  This recipe is a treasure to keep and make many times more.

Absolutely loved it! I used all ingredients (only used 1 tbsp of hot spicy veg mix from calambia - you can find this small jar of sause in m&s 
expensive imported delicacies section), also used twin pack of raw prawns from m&s w/o tails. As I didnt have scewers and all ingredients are so lovely and healthy, I just put whole mixture after 5 hrs in the fridge to a pan and panfried it, then added half a pack of organic whole durum wheat spaghetti (that I boiled just before frying the prawns). The result was the best spaghetti and prawn dish ever! It wasnt too spicy for the mouth membranes but after ingesting I could feel fire deep in my chest, it was absolutely delicious! The only thing the prawn meat was cooked by lemon juice and the meat was a bit tough but it didn't bother me at all. Also I didn't devein the shrimp, don't see the need for it.

I made this marinade with my classes (Children from ages 5-11) and they LOVED it!.  It has all the elements for teaching points (acid, oil, salt etc.).  The kids learned so much and had fun skewering the shrimp.  Not a single one left!  The staff ate them up too!  Delicious and amazingly simple.  Thanks Robbie!  Fabulous!

Was enjoyed at dinner by four adults. We thought the amount of heat was perfect. The seasonings lean toward Cajun but I served it with the Italian dish Pasta Pizazz from this site. It worked pretty well ( with more garlic in the pasta, but that's another review.) Try this recipe, you'll not be disappointed.

Yum!!  We wanted to try a new grilled shrimp recipe and saw the great reviews this one had.  It was fantastic!  I didn't stray from the recipe at all.  Served it with some couscous and asparagus.  It was a perfect dinner!  Can't wait to have it again.

Oh - my - goodness!  This was wonderful.  Since my husband doesn't care for anything "hot," I made half the marinade with the hot sauce and half without.  You really couldn't tell much of a difference after the shrimp were grilled.  This is definitely a recipe that will be made again and again.  We also grilled fresh pineapple chunks alongside the shrimp and served with homemade rice pilaf.  Delicious!

I think this recipe is extraordinary.  I make it just as it says, but sometimes marinade it longer than 30 minutes.  I fix for all my family members and guests and haven't had anyone turn up their nose yet, mostly they ask if there are more!  Just passed it along to my boss.  We'll see what he says next week.

Easy and Delicious!  I followed the recipe exact but I didn't have fresh basil so I used dry. This marinade is subtle and doesn't overwhelm yet gives the shrimp a boost with a nice clean taste. This is the second time I have used this recipe. The first time I marinated 3-4 hours. This time about an hour. The tase was the same. I used frozen raw, deveined, tails off shrimp - couldn't be easier and was a big hit with our dinner party. I mixed my own serving with wild rice and it made a delicious meal.

This is really delicious.  I followed the recipe, but added a tad more garlic because I LOVE garlic.  Other than that, no changes and it turned out great.  Served it as an appetizer for our camping group and everyone loved it!  I'm going to try adding the pineapple to the skewers next time as suggested in some of the previous reviews.

This was really good. My family enjoyed the flavor of this shrimp and it was easy. Mine did take a bit longer than stated but followed recipe otherwise. Thanks!

The best shrimp yet!  My family gave rave reviews.  I only marinated it for 1 hour and it was very tasty.

This is by far the best grilled shrimp recipe ever!  I have had company, family, and even young grandchildren beg me to make this shrimp again and again.  I do decrease the amount of olive oil and sometimes use jarred garlic and dried parsley instead of fresh.  Be sure to use dried oregano, not ground oregano.  I find that the longer I marinade the shrimp, the spicier it becomes.  I limit the marinade time to approximately 2 - 2 1/2 hours.

This was delicious.  When reaching for the dried parsley I accidentally grabbed the Oregano.  Didn't realize it till it was too late and already in bowl.  Oh well.  Turned out great!!  Marinated for an hour, grilled about 4 minutes per side and served with homemade shrimp sauce.

This is an excellent marinade for grilled shrimp! I did not use parsley because I didn't have any and certainly didn't miss it since its not my favorite herb anyway. I only marinated about an hour and it was great. Then I grilled them on my Big Green Egg Grill. I didn't baste during the cooking and I don't think it's necessary. Especially since I made a lemon garlic butter that I drizzled on them for serving. Delicious!

I've made this over and over and over.  I use cilantro instead of parsley.  I usually cut the hot sauce in half because I serve it to my 4 year old and my toddler.  They both love it.  I also use ketchup instead of tomato paste because I don't like to open a can of paste just to use a little bit.  I have cooked on the stove top in the oil marinade and it works great that way as well.

Delicious.   I cut the oil to 1/2 cup (that was plenty) and cut the hot pepper sauce to 1 Tbsp (bad move, it definitely could've taken the additional spice).  Took others advice and added the lemon juice only for the last 30-45 min. marinade time.  Yum... husband and I were fighting the kids for the last bite!

OUTSTANDING! Picky teenage son couldn't get enough. I didn't want to open a can of tomato paste for just a small amount and I didn't have hot sauce on hand. So, I substituted some hot BBQ sauce for the marinade and it was great.

After reading many reviews it seems a number of people thought it was too bland, so instead of plain hot sauce I used Sambal Oelek (available at most grocery stores) and that gave it a delicious kick. We also had added pineapple to the skewers and served over wild rice.

We all enjoyed these shrimp. It was too cold to grill outside so I drained the shrimp and sauted then in a nonstick skillet without any oil. Thanks for the recipe.

This was amazing!  I didn't have pepper sauce so I used Frank's Red Sauce.  Also I didn't have tomato PASTE so I used a small can of tomato sauce.  I ended up marinading for over 24 hours in the plastic bag in the fridge because something came up and we weren't able to cook/eat it that night.  Otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter and it was yummy yummy YUMMY!!!  I served it with wild rice and a green salad.  The best grilled shrimp I ever made!

I followed the directions exactly, with the exception of I marinated this for about four hours instead of two.  I used frozen, already cooked shrimp because that was all my favorite grocery store had.  So really my husband just nuked these on the grill for a minute until they were warmed through.  Husband loved it, and I loved it.  Will do this one again.

Just made this tonight.  I marinated shrimp and chicken thighs together.  The chicken thighs were a winner but the shrimp, according to my sensitive children, were bland.  Maybe because I used farm raised shrimp from Thailand and only marinated them for one hour?  Maybe because I omitted the salt and half the hot pepper sauce.  They seemed salty enough.  They actually tasted like they had some kind of preservative in them.  Next time, I will marinate them longer, but I will include a lot more chicken thighs.

I can't say enough about this recipe!  I first made this at Christmas for my family that was visiting and everyone loved it. My boyfriend and I love it so much that I've started making large batches of the marinade and vacuum sealing marinated portions of shrimp in the freezer.  We pull out a bag of the  shrimp the night before, or even day of, and either grill it or cook it on the stove in a pan.  With some rice and frozen veggies this has quickly become one of our go-to meals.

I made this for my family yesterday and it was the first thing gone! I did alter the receipt a little added more hot sauce(we're from New Orleans area needed little more kick) and a little more lemon juice. It was easy and so good, will make again very soon.

Good shrimp marinate.  I think 2 hours is too long to "soak" the shrimp.  Makes them soft after cooking.

This recipe is GREAT! I followed it to a T and it was almost perfect (I expected more of a kick, but that's OK). I think the TYPE of hot pepper sauce used will determine how spicy it is. I used Louisiana and the shrimp turned out mild. Next time I will use extra, or a spicier sauce. We ate this with a sides of rice pilaf and extra lemon wedges. DELICIOUS!

We tried this marinade exactly as written, but it was definitely TOO SPICY for us!  Will try again but may only add a tsp of the hot sauce - it was definitely TOO HOT!!!!

This was sooo good. I really liked the combination of herbs and seasonings that ended up making these delicious shrimp. I admit that after tasting them, I was tempted to steal them all for myself. You really can't go wrong with lemon + shrimp.

I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day.  We didn't have gas for the grill, so we cooked it in a grill pan on the stove.  I used shrimp with the shell still on, and it was fantastic.  Next time, I'll actually grill it and I'm sure it will still taste wonderful!

Used this yesterday, over hardwood charcoal and mesquite smoking chunks.  The result was very tasty shrimp.  Only change was to reduce the cooking time, as I do not care for overcooked shrimp.  3-4 minutes on a hot grill usually does it.

Fantastic! Me and my husband loved it! Extremely lean with a light but very savory flavor to them. We will definitely make them again, no changes to the recipe needed. This would definitely impress some company.

This was fantastic!  I ended up broiling the shrimp since we were out of propane for the grill.  Broiled them for about 5min on each side.  I will probably use a little less salt and hot sauce to make to my family's tastes.  I served with rice. Can't wait to make again!

Tried this tonight and it was good.  I used only 1 teaspoon of oregano, but I will use the full measurement next time.  In an effort to be "kid-friendly", I also didn't use the full measure of hot sauce, but will do so next time.  I marinated for 1 hour and grilled on skewers.  As you can tell, I *will* use this recipe again...with grits.  Mmmm.  ADDING CITRUS EARLY IN THE PROCESS WILL MAKE THE SHRIMP TOUGH...DON'T ADD CITRUS MORE THAN 20 MINUTES BEFORE GRILLING.

This recipe was very simple and quick that me and my bro made for a family function.  It came out so good, we made a batch for a thanksgiving side dish.  I think this is the best non-restaurant cooked shrimp that I have had.  Great recipe!

I tried this recipe out because of the high ratings and reviews and followed it almost exactly except for the hot sauce (I only put in 1 tsp - I'm a lightweight when it comes to heat). This turned out absolutely delicious and my family loved it.

I made this for my Mom's birthday.  They loved it and agreed with other reviewers that it needed no sauce.  I used fresh oregano and may have used a little much, which is why I rated it 4 stars.  I thought it was good, just not the "melt in your mouth" quality that I save for five stars.  I served it with grilled squash/zuccini, salad and black bean/corn relish.  I really thought it worked perfectly with those.  Tomorrow I am using the left overs to mix with homeade pico and avacado for a shrimp salad.  I think it will be great!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fabulous served over linguine with fresh chopped tomatoes, basil and feta cheese and sprayed with fresh lemon. Delicious fall-back recipe for every-day dinner or special occasions. I omit the parsley just because I'm lazy and it doesn't seem to hurt the flavor.

I can't rave enough about this recipe!  I've made it twice in the past week - exactly as written - once for company and once for the family.  Both times the shrimp disappeared quickly.  This is definitely one of our all-time favorites...

Loved it!  I followed the directions, but substituted ketchup for tomato paste.  They seemed to take a little longer than 4 mins per side, so just watch for the color change.

These shrimp as so good!!  My entire family including picky young kids can't get enough.  I've made it several times and each time we're just blown away by how good it tastes.  I replaced the hot sauce and tomato paste with 2 TB of ketchup as others suggested.  A definite keeper!

UPDATE:
I cooked these for our 4th of July party and I had people lining up for more. EVERYONE said they were the best shrimp they have ever had. So good!

SO GOOOOOOD!! I have been looking for a shrimp recipe that resembled that of Outback Steakhouse's shrimp that comes with the "No Rules Pasta". This hit it spot on if not better!!! I think I'll use ketchup next time becuase I have wasted plenty of tomatoe paste by using it only for this and nothing else! But It is delicious!

This was delicious - I threw some steak into the marinade as well and it tasted wonderful.  I used cilantro instead of parsley for a little more kick.

This recipe was delicious!  Simple and easy.  I served this at our first pool party/picnic of the summer and everyone loved it.  I didn't reserve any sauce for basting and it still came out perfect.  Very good and highly recommended.

I ahd a dinner party and the grilled shrimp was the bomb! I replaced the tomato paste with ketcup and the flavor was great. I also used the left over marinated to roll skewers of raw vegetables--mushrooms, onions, yellow squash, and zuc's, I put these on the grill about 10 to 15 minutes before the shrimp and they where all done at the same the time. What a great recipe! I think it would also be great on chicken.

Wow!!! I made this marinade for a BBQ and people RAVED about the delicious flavor of the shrimp. It has a little zing to it, but certainly not too spicy! This is one of my new favorites, and in fact, I am going to try it with BBQ chicked tonight! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Great recipe!  We used EZ peel shrimp and I think that helped cut down on the saltiness and the grill flare-ups.

This recipe is delicious!!! I am a salt lover, but this recipe was too salty even for me. Next time I will use just a pinch or two of salt. I only had dried parsley and it was still so good - I can't wait to make it with fresh parsley. I will be making this all summer long! Thanks!!!

This is an outstanding marinade for grilling shrimp. I prepared them a couple of days ago and found them to be very tasty.  Two days later I grabbed the (few) leftover shrimp from the fridge, and dipped them (still cold) into a bit of cocktail sauce.  Even then they were phenomenal. 

I am planning to make them again over the weekend as they turned out so well.  Highly recommended.

This really is a 4 1/2 but also some of the best shrimp I've ever had.  It is quite salty. I would ommit it, it's really not needed.  Otherwise YUMMY!!!  Thank you.

My family seemed to like this - I don't care for shrimp.  I used catsup instead of tomato paste only because I didn't want to open the can and use such a small amount.  I would probably use make this again.

This marinade was awesome, the amount of flavor the shrimp picked up was unbelievable.  I also added a little lemon zest in addition to the lemon juice, and ketchup instead of tomato paste... I never end up using the rest of the can if I open tomato paste. I'd like to try this on pork or chicken.  Thanks for th great dinner!

My husband loved these and I liked them.  Therefore I decided on 4 stars but hubby would have definitely given them 5.  We almost always make the basil shrimp recipe on here but now we will mix this one into the rotation as well.

AWESOME SHRIMP!
we took others advice & used ketchup instead of the tomato paste.  we also used barbeque sauce in place of the hot sauce, as we don't like things very hot.  i didn't have any fresh parsley on hand, so used fresh basil, we used dried parsley, and only about 1/2 of the oregano that the recipe called for.  we skewered our shrimp & grilled it.  ate it with some boiled corn on the cob & baked potatoes.  A delicious easy dinner!

Very Good!!  I followed the recipe to a tee. i thought they would be spicier but i didn't let them sit overnight either.  I ran out of time and only let them marinate a few hours.  I will DEFINITELY make them again, add a little spice and let them marinate for the recommended time.

This is a very good starter recipe for grilled shrimp.  I always end up adding a little more seasoning and spices because my husband is from the West Indies and they tend to like their food on the hot n' spicy side.

I used the advice and used ketchup instead of the tomato paste and the whole family loved this recipe. If you like shrimp on a barbie at the out back you will LOVE this recipe.

When I first read this recipe I had my doubts but diecided to give it a try.  I also used ketchup instead of tomato past, I halved the salt and used 3/4 tsp black pepper and then added a 1/4 cup to pineapple juice.  I marinated for only 1 hour so as not to make it too spicy and what a hit!!!  My husband asked me to make it again the next day.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone and have.

This recipe was very easy to put together. I prepared this exactly as written.  It was good but not great.  I felt there was something missing.  It was a little oily.  Next time I will use less oil and more lemon juice and some lemon zest.

Excellent recipe! I followed it exactly and it came out perfectly. Doesn't need anything added or changed - it's just right as-is!

OMG! Who knew a mere mortal could cook something this amazing? This was the first thing I've cooked on my brand new grill, and WOW! This is foolproof, folks. I didn't have parsley, but added a healthy dose of country dijon mustard. And I just used those cheap shrimp from the freezer section. This tastes gourmet. Thanks for a KILLER recipe!

Wow!  Who needs to go out to eat when you can bring restaurant quality to your own kitchen.  Absolutely loved this marinade for the shrimp.  I did make a couple of changes based on other reviews - substituted ketchup for tomato paste, didn't have any hot sauce so did a dollop of BBQ sauce, and completely left out the salt.  I'm on a sodium restriction diet and my taste buds were awakened by this marinade.  Looking forward to baking this and trying it as a scampy like another reviewer recommended.  Thanks for the recipe!

Like everyone else, I thought this recipe was WONDERFUL! A word of advice for those who, like me, are skewering shrimp for the first time: Leave a little room in between each shrimp on the skewer to insure even cooking/grilling. I tried to jam as many shrimp on a skewer as I could and ended up trying to seperate them while they were on the grill... and hot. 
Am I the brightest bulb in the pack? Probably not. But tonight I have a very happy belly.

WOW! Absolutely the BEST grilled shrimp recipe! My very picky family couldn't get enough of it. I even made a cajun sauce and ate it and the sauce over pasta.
