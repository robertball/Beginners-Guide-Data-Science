I love this recipe.  I see that everyone that has tried it bought the cinnamon oil from the grocery store or crafts store.  I got mine from the pharmacy.  You have to have the pharmacisty order it, and it's about 5$ a bottle but you only need like a teaspoon and it's hot...  I made 10 lbs of candy last year and didn't even use one bottle.

This is the same candy my mother made.. I lost it.. then found this one.. then my sister found moms.. there is no difference and we and our children enjoyed it for years.. it sounds like some cooks get in too much of a hurry

This recipe was great! It was very simple to make, all it took was some minor patience. I used Lorann gourmet oil, it was extra strength, and it was bursting with flavor. I always loved cinnamon rock candy and now I got a good recipe. Too bad nobody else could enjoy this. Thanks again, tata.

This was really easy and yeilded enough for all my holiday gifts in one batch! I went to my local organic grocery store and bought essential oils for the flavoring. Be sure to break the pieces small as they take quite a while to dissolve in your mouth and are not really good for crunching. Also made another batch with green coloring and peppermint flavor. YUM!!

Well Apparently some people cannot cook, I made this recipe it was fine. I almost killed over from the smell but it was great, if you put powdered sugar over it brings out the spice, I find nothing wrong with it. Was spicy if anything.

Not enough cinnamon flavor at all.  It was so much work and to have it not be flavorful at all was a complete disappointment.  May try the recipe on the cinnamon oil package which has more flavoring in it.  Do not try this recipe - NO flavor!

I tried this recipie like 2 times without a candy thermometer an i burned it and under cooked it so it was like a hard rubbery state and when i burned it it was nasty so finally i went out and bought a thermometer and it was wonderful. but i sugest putting 2-3 teaspoons of oil.

This is a great recipe! For those who commented that it didn't have any flavor, my guess is that you're using cinnamon extract instead of cinnamon oil. Unfortunately, extract is easier to find, but it doesn't work!

I lost my recipe, so I searched and found this one. I have been making rock candy for years. This is the best recipe, only you do need to double the oil if you like it hot. I usually add a dram to it instead of the tsp. But we like it spicy. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

this recipe sounded pretty good but it was way more work then it was worth!! like someone mentioned before there was no flavor, i even put in 2 table spoons but it still didn't taste near strong enough! it also was very sticky and did not harden all of the way.

This recipe is great but I like hot cinnamon candy! I bought 2 drams from Hobby Lobby and used that tonight to make it really spicy. Bad idea! the oils rose to the surface of the candy and any time I touched it to check the hardness my fingers would burn! I actually fixed this by "washing" my sheet under running water and even though it disolved some of the candy away it fixed my problem and I still have really spicy cinnamon!

My first batch came out perfect and the candy hit 300 degrees in exactly 25 minutes; my 2nd batch, I used a shallower pot and it took forever to hit 300 degrees.  If you follow the directions and use a thermometer, I think you'll find this recipe easy to follow and very delicious.  I'm trying raspberry in my 2nd batch and I think this candy would be yummy no matter what flavor oil you use.  But definitely use OIL and not extract.  There won't be nearly enough flavor if you use extract.  Also, make sure you stir the oil in very thoroughly, I didn't on the first batch and parts of it were unbearably hot and other parts didn't have enough flavor.  OOPS!

My grandma makes something like this, so I was looking for a recipe and found this one.

This recipe is so easy! Just follow the directions as written, and don't try to rush things.

You definitely need a candy thermometer. They're cheap, so pick one up when you're getting the ingredients.  I spent $4 on mine.

This candy is positively delicious!  Be sure to use a candy thermometer and for best results use 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon oil!

I was unable to find cinnamon oil and used cinnamon extract and used internet to determine the ratio of 1 tablespoon cinnamon extract to 1 teaspoon cinnamon oil.  They say extract doesn't withstand the heat as well and therefore our end result was a bit soft - but still hard candy.

This is the first time I ever made candy and it turned out perfect!! The hard part was finding the cinnamon oil. I ended up having to go to a bakery supply store to get it. Worth it in the end though! I can't wait to give out candy as gifts!!

Yummy! I used Pam for baking on the foil and scored the candy with a lightly oiled knife once it had cooled a bit to allow foe easy breaking.  I will make this again. It is very good.

This was VERY good, the only thing I will do differently next time is use a larger pan to pour it in, just because I like my hard candy thinner, and not so  thick, but very very good! Thank You!
