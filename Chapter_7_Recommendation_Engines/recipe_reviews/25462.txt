This is an excellent recipe. HOWEVER, I can see why people have commented on it the way they have. When you blend up all the ingredients,it is a lot of liquid to add to just 2 pounds of ground beef. I was having a large party and I added it to 7 POUNDS of ground beef. I let it sit longer in the fridge too. It didn't dilute the flavor and the meat was formed into patties that stuck together just fine. I really didn't even need the bread cumbs, but I added them just as a precaution. Everyone LOVED them. They were juicy and very flavorful. Thanks a lot!!!!!

We made this recipe for a barbeque party we were having.  Thank goodness we tried one before we served our guests!  The burgers totally fell apart on the grill and made an awful mess!  We tried adding more bread crumbs, tried egg, even tried frying, but it was still more like a meatloaf then a burger!!  I will never make these again, and even had to make an emergency run to Wal-Mart for more hamburger to serve at our party!

This is one of my favorite ways to make burgers.  I really like the flavor the steak sauce gives the mixture.  I admit that due to some picky eaters at my house I have to make without the vegetables.  I suspect they would go a long way to adding to the flavor.

We've had this recipe twice.  My husband and I think the flavor is great, but we're not too hip on the texture.  I usually make four burgers and freeze the second two raw and throw them on the grill when I need them.  Both times I have done this we have liked the way the taste and grill up better after they are frozen.  Go figure!  It's great to have a recipe that's not just plain hamburgers once in a while.  I give it a must try, but not a family favorite.

There is a good bit of liquid in this recipe. That should be apparent to anyone trying it. The bread crumbs are a must because of it. Even with the bread, the meat mixture is very soft. I tossed one burger on the grill to see what would happen. It started to stick and fall apart right away. I ended up grilling these on non-stick foil over high heat. I agree with the reviewer who said these grill better when you begin with frozen patties. Freezing would certainly keep them from falling apart. The flavor of these is good. The texture is different from a plain burger. Don't expect it to be the same and you won't be disappointed.

Well what can I say. They were good, but there was nothing extra special about these.  It was a lot more trouble to make than the reward of the final product.  I will not be making these again.

This was too much like meatloaf on a bun.  Maybe if you leave out the breadcrumbs they would be better and maybe not fall apart while grilling.

I just loved these burgers. I also added mushrooms and black olives to the vegetable mixture. Had to increase bread crumbs somewhat, still should use egg to hold together better. You can taste every veg. as if you were eating them seperately, can't wait for my dad to try these he will flip. The veg. mixture when mixed looks like something you would find at a old folks home, had my doubts, but stuck with it. Was quite pleased with end result and you will to.

I loved this recipe, but I didn't use as much breadcrumbs.  It was delicious.  I use this recipe everytime I make hamburgers.  I also use it for Meat bourekas.  Brown the meat, wrap with small squares of puff pastry and bake.

While this was good, to me it tasted more like a meatloaf type dish rather than hamburgers on the grill. I made it both ways and my family liked it with mashed potatoes and gravy rather than on the grill as burger.

Couldn't get anything to stick together.  Didn't even make decent meat loaf.  What we did eat in a meat loaf had WAY to much green pepper.

This burger was OK.  A little too "mushy" for me, but I did enjoy having my son and husband eat onion, bell pepper and tomato without them knowing and complaining.

I thought these were really good. Very flavorful and not at all dry. Before cooking it appears as though the burgers would fall apart on the grill, but they held up fine. Everyone loved them. I definitely recommend trying these!

Made these for a party. Double everything in the recipe and used 12 pounds of meat to make 42 patties. Everyone loved them and said there was a lot of flavor. Great recipe!

This recipe really WAS good but I guess we are not much on green peppers.  I agree with TinaGeiger who felt the taste was more of a meatloaf. However, we did not have the opportunity to actually grill these burgers to give them the full treatment. I liked the ingredients overall and will continue to experiement with this base to find what will best suit the tasts of my family.  Thanks!
