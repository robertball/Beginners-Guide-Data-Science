It was yummy!  We used vanilla pudding instead of butterscotch and pancake syrup instead of corn syrup

YUMMY! I cut the rolls into fourths and rolled them in vanilla cook and serve pudding powder. I also used 1/2 butterscotch and 1/2 vanilla pudding. After dissolving the brown sugar in the butter I added the pudding mixture to it. No gritty crunch from the sugar. Everything melted and blended together beautifully. So good!

This was pretty good. I halved the recipe and baked it in a loaf pan. When making this recipe I would put some of the pecans on the bottom of the pan before putting in the frozen rolls.

A new family favorite. Make sure to use a Bundt pan (not a tube pan with removable bottom). Learned this the hard way ... thank goodness for self-cleaning ovens! If you don't have the cook 'n serve pudding, you can use instant, but mix it in with the butter/brown sugar mix. Found the instant didn't "dissolve" if just sprinkled over. Thanks for this great recipe.

This recipe is very good especially with the addition of the corn syrup. My frozen rolls were unfortunately sitting in the freezer for a year (i know shame on me) and they didn't rise much in the fridge, so before I went to bed i left them on the counter to sit covered overnite, and they rose much more. Will make again with fresh frozen roll dough that btw, i cut into four before putting in pan and also I layered the rolls then butter/br sug, pudding mix, wh. sugar & cinnamon, syrup, then repeat. Delicious and gooey!

I left out the corn syrup and it was still delicious. It does rise quite a bit so I would recommend placing foil over the top then a cookie sheet and something heavy to keep it all in. Make sure you let it set after removing from the oven to let all the juices cool to a syrup and soak into the bread.

We call this recipe "Butterscotch Bubble Loaf", but "Amazing Monkey Bread" works as well.  Vanilla pudding works good as a substitute, but I like it best with butterscotch pudding.

The recipe wasn't super clear. Let rise in fridge or countertop? The amount of brown sugar and butter: to taste? It stuck to my pan and I thought it wouldn't come out but using stiff spatulas I was able to coax it out without ruining the whole thing. On the flip side I took it to a neighborhood brunch and everyone loved it. I'll probably keep looking for a better (easier to follow and more foolproof) Monkey Bread recipe.

This recipe is amazing!  Only change was I subbed walnuts for pecans.  Reminds me of  'sticky buns' I used to buy at my favorite bakery.   In my opinion, the taste and texture are far superior to the recipes that call for biscuits.

This recipe sounds great, but I have a stupid question.  What am I looking for regarding "frozen" dinner rolls?  Unbaked dough apparently.  I am only familiar with the stuff that comes in tubes (like Pilsbury), or the ones that are already baked.  Thanks for any feedback, like name brands, stores to look into, etc.

It turned out great. The only change I made was to use 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon. I have tried it with both butterscotch and vanilla pudding. They are both good, but I think the butterscotch is more flavorful.

I followed the directions to the T and they were truly amazing. I will never make the other kind of monkey bread with biscuits again. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Note: I did not have regular butterscotch pudding mix the second time I went to make this. I ended up using sugar free instant and it was still delicious and caramelly. I would probably not deviate from the recipe again but it was nice to know I could use the sugar free pudding.

This is a terrific recipe.  I followed the recipe,  but I think too much of the sprinkled ingredients ended up on the middle rolls - they didnt rise so wel I'll. I also didnt have the tube pan so I used a 9x13, which worked pretty well.

Made it and left it in the fridge overnight.  2 hours before cooking I put it on the counter to finish rising which worked very well.  I would recommend putting something under it in the oven to catch spills otherwise you'll be cleaning  a burnt sugary mess from the bottom of the oven like I did. Its very tasty and everyone loved it, would make again.

This was a terrible recipe.  Pouring the sauce on top makes no sense.  I let the rolls rise before baking and the sauce just kind of disappeared. They were totally dry and no caramel really at all.  I had to make caramel sauce after they baked that I poured over the rolls.  Very weird recipe.  Don't understand how it got so many good reviews.
