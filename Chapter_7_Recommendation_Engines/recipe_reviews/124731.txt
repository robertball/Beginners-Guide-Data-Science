I had my husband go to the store, so I ended up with shredded potatoes instead, and it came out awesome! Everyone, especially the kids, loved it!! I will definatly make it again. I would suggest increasing the cheese though, because the sour cream was slightly overwhelming the rest of the flavors.

I made this for a side on Christmas Day.  I get so bored with Mashed Potatos and gravy.  EVERYONE LOVED this recipe. It was so easy using the frozen hash browns, which by the way I used shredded instead of cubed.  It was fantastic.

i made this using ore ida brand o'brien potatoes (with onions & green peppers already in there). It was awesome! Didn't have to chop onions & we both like green pepper so worked great! Topped w/a little extra cheese at the last minute. Terrific leftover too!

This is a family favorite now! The only difference is that I reduce the melted butter down to 1/4 cup.

I cook dinners for our church every Wednesday night which consist of 75 people, so I'm always looking for new recipes.  When I found this one it sounded pretty good, so I though I'd try it. 

Well, it was a huge success.  In fact, I had two ladies ask me for the recipe.  This was one of the best recipes I've tried and was so simple to make.  I was told by several of the people tonight that I could fix this again and again and they would be very happy with that.

So thanks a bunch to Betty Claycomb for submitting the recipe...truly a success in my books!!

delicious!  I used thinly sliced fresh potatoes rather than frozen and it still turned out lovely.

This was easy to make, and tasted fantastic. I do agree with a few reviewers that more cheese is needed. Other than that, Its a great side dish.

I used reduced fat sour cream, reduced fat sharp white cheddar, and I added fresh minced garlic. I sauteed the onion and garlic in a little butter before I added it to the rest of the ingredients.  Right before pouring it into the baking pan, I did add a little dijon mustard and a few shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce. I liked that this was easy for me to throw together and used pantry ingredients and cleaned out my freezer at the same time but my family didn't seem to like it. I think if I add some spices next time, maybe some chopped red pepper, it might be better. Maybe some chives? Cutting out the butter and adding more cheese would be good.

Everyone LOVED this one, at Easter this year!! It is so easy and quick to make. I put it all together the night before and baked it next day. Didn't use the french onions on top. Also baked it for an hour and a half, and it made it that much better. Delicious!! Also used reduced fat sour cream :)

i didn't think these would be that good just looking at the ingredients, but they were amazing! i added a little extra cheese to the mix and sprinkled an extra layer on top w/ the f-fried onions - next time i might 1/2 the butter as it pooled up on top a bit after baking. will definately be making again as an easy BBQ-side. thanks!

absolutely awesome. My wife loves this recipe and is always asking for it. Then when I make it she gets mad at me because she can't keep from eating half of them (Not really healthy). I will continue to make this recipe (Unaltered)and will just have to get used to being yelled at. :)

I made this for Thanksgiving for the first time and it was the first side dish to go!  Everyone asked me for the recipe.  This is a great go-to side dish.  I recommend using Romano cheese, and the Hash Browns with the onions and peppers already included.

Addictive. It is so hard to stop eating this!!! I used 1/2 the butter and sour cream and added a bit more cheese. Sprinkled dried parsley over top instead of onions. I forgot to get the shredded hash browns out of the freezer and so I mixed them up frozen. Baked it in a glass 13x9 pan at 325 on the top rack while we went to church.  It was lightly browned on the edges which made it even better. I served it with barbecue meatballs and green beans. Another keeper!!!!!!!!!

Made this for a holiday get-together & it was the hit of the party! I doubled the amount of cheese, crushed & added half of the fried onions to the mix, as well as some seasoning salt & garlic powder, and let it cook in my crock pot for a few hours. Just before serving I put it in a big casserole dish, topped with the rest of the fried onions and browned the top under the broiler. You could change up the flavor by adding different cheeses - gorgonzola, asiago or extra-sharp would only enhance the flavors. It's a keeper!

I've made this a couple times, and always receive rave reviews. I use the frozen potatoes O'Brien, since they have the onion and red and green peppers, they look extra festive for Christmas. Plus I can skip adding the chopped onion, since its already in there. Last night I cooked it until almost finished, kept it warm while my roast cooked, then popped it back into the oven with the french-fried onions and a little extra cheese. Soooo good!

Not a bad recipe. Followed it to the tee and thought it was just a tad salty but that may just be my taste buds. But all in all I did add it to the recipe box and will be serving them again.

I made this for Easter Sunday dinner and doubled the recipe since we have a large extended family. I used Kraft's Philadelphia Three Cheese (monterey jack, colby, & cheddar chees with cream cheese variety) and added an extra cup (for 3 cups total) after reading the reviews. The potatoes I bought were the fresh (not frozen) cubed potatoes that already had onion added so that saved a step for me...I'll definately use the same thing next time as it made this recipe extremely quick to make.
EVERYONE raved over these potatoes and my sister-in-law even asked for the recipe. 
I would recommend these for a quick & easy recipe for scalloped potatoes and will make them again & again.  Thanks for sharing!!

This has become my favorite after work dinner side.  Quick and easy to prepare (with practically not cleanup) and by the time it is finished baking, the main dish is ready and these potatoes are usually the hit of the meal.

I've made a version of this for years and my family can't get enough. Shredded hashbrowns tend to pick up more flavor, I find. Reduce sour cream to 1 1/4 cups, increase cheese to 2 cups (use sharp cheddar for a more full flavor) and instead of french onions, sprinkle 1 cup of crushed rice cereal over the top, drizzling with a bit of butter and a sprinkle of paprika. One step, into the oven and out an hour later (if your potatoes are thawed). No need for foil. Delicioso! :)

This dish was outstanding I made it for our Easter dinner. I made a few revisions as I did not have some of the ingredients in my kitchen. I used fresh sliced parr boiled potatoes, thinly sliced. I also used jack cheddar mixed shredded cheese I used more than it called for maybe about 1 1/2 cups. I also did not have fresh onions so I used minced dried onions. I also left out the french-fried onions as It was Easter dinner and I was using them in the green bean casserole. I will remake this recipe to take to my next family gathering.Thank you for sharing this scrumptious recipe!!

This is the family recipe that we've been using for years.  To reduce the fat content, we use low-fat or fat-free sour cream, and 98% fat-free cream of chicken soup.  We also use thawed tater-tots, green onions, and crushed cornflakes on the top instead of the french fried onion....  tastes great and is always gone when we take it to a potluck.

I used frozen shredded hash browns and it was delicious!  I also sauteed the onions before putting them in the potatoes so the onions wouldn't overwhelm it.  I made it as a side dish for Christmas ham and my family loved it!

The great thing about this recipe is, beyond having to dice up a medium onion, there's pretty much zero preparation.  Today proved to be the tipping point as my brother's kids had it at Easter.  They are notoriously finicky eaters, and they both loved it.  In fact, I had to send the link to both my brother's wife and my mom.  Sure, it takes an hour to bake, but the results are fantastic every time.  Highly recommended, especially for larger groups as this makes a good 10-12 servings. (I know it says 8 servings, but that would be 8 really big servings.)

My family loves this recipe!!!  I get requests to bring it to gatherings all of the time.  I love that you can prep it the night before and just put it in the oven on the day you need it.

This dish is awesome.  No matter where I bring it someone asks for the recipe.  The only change I make is to add 2 cups of cheese,

I love this recipe! The first time I made it I did so with the shredded hash browns since the store was out of cubed and it was delicious! I just made it again with cubed and I must say I prefer the shredded so I'll stick with that in the future. I also add a bit more cheese than is called for.

I used thinly sliced potatoes, 2 cups of cheese, and no french-fried onions. It turned out great!

This one is a keeper. The whole family loved it. If you slice up raw potatoes as I did, bake it an extra 10 minutes.

Made it for the first time last night...Overall it is a simple, easy, & delicious recipe. My family thought it was delicious but a little on the rich side....definitely not a low fat or low calorie side.

Yummy.  We loved this...including my 3 year old, who is lactose intolerant, so I substituted the sour cream with Toffuti cream cheese and used almond cheddar cheese.  I also made from fresh potatoes.  Just boiled red potatoes until they were slighly soft, sliced and then put in.  Still tasted excellent.  Thanks and will make again.

YUMMY & I'm not a huge potato fan & my husband doesn't like sour cream.  Thanks Betty.  I made this with some modifications. I doubled the recipe. I steamed old, sprouting potatoes whole in the microwave until they were softened but still firm.  After I peeled and cubed them, they weighed about 4 pounds.   I mixed together 2 cups of sour cream, 1 can of cream of chicken soup, ½ can of cream of celery soup, about ¾ soup can of milk, 12 ounces of shredded Cheddar cheese, 2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. ground pepper.  Then I stirred in the potatoes and about 2 cups finely chopped onion, sautéed in ½ cup of butter until tender and just starting to brown.  Poured the mixture into a buttered, 4-quart glass bowl and baked at 350 degrees F for about 1½ hours uncovered.  I didn’t use French fried onions.  Next time I make this, I will change a few things.  Even though it looked, smelled, and tasted great, the potatoes were floating in oil. The onion taste was too strong. I will use a less than 1 cup of onions and just enough butter to sauté them. There was too much sauce and it was too thin. The second night the sauce had thickened considerably after re-heating at 350 degrees F for about an hour. For a double recipe, I will use 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and no milk. I will still use half as much sour cream and may try a topping like crushed corn flakes to help sop up some of the excess oil from the melted cheese.

I like this side dish.  Delicious.  The family enjoyed it. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used the shredded frozen hash browns instead.

I made this as written for my family last night and they LOVED it!  Not a low calorie food by any means but worth it as a special treat.  Very easy too.

This was ok.  I was looking for a recipe I had tried before.  This wasn't it.  It is ok, but I probably won't make again.

I made this tonight for Easter dinner to go with ham and these were delicious.  Everyone raved about them and there were no leftovers.  Follow the recipe exactly, do not change a thing.  If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!

we've made this for christmas morning before- my brother in law introuced this to our family...
the only big difference is that we add broken cornflakes (mixxed with a bit of melted butter) ontop, to make a delicious crispy crunch ontop. 
Normally not at all my style- but its soooooo good you really cant pass up.
