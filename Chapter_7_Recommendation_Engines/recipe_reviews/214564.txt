4-28-11: I love scallion pancakes! I would've lowered the ratings if I made it as is. Just by looking, I know and agree with the flour/water being way off. Start with 1/4 cup water (if using the 1 cup flour;8 smaller pancakes or 4 reg sizes) and add more by a teaspoon at a time if needed. I also skipped the flour/veg oil crumb mixture; to me, it was unnecessary. 12-16-12: I didn't feel like kneading with my hand today, spin used the bread machine instead but used the whole amount of 3/4 water and added at least 3/4-1 cup flour.

I think the amount of flour is off. I had to add 3/4 cup more to make soft dough otherwise the dough will be runny. There won't be any kneading to do! I live in Shanghai and there's this thing called "Dong Bei Qiang Bing" and it looked a lot like the photo here but this definately wasn't it. Because this so-called "pancake" lacks in taste and need sauce to dip it in. I've had many Chinese street food but this one is not for me.

Yummy! Mine came out crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, and had a great taste. I did add about 3/4 c extra flour, and also doubled the salt.

I thought this would be the like the stuff you can get at gong-guan in Taipei, but these are not tasty at all.

This took me a long time to make but I think with practice I could whip some up in no time. They had a great texture with a mild onion-y taste, but definitely need a sauce to go with them - I tried a spicy chutney that was delicious, but I think Chinese sweet and sour sauce would be best. Also, I had to add much more flour than the recipe called for, enough to make it solid enough to knead. I'll try these again for sure! Thanks!

These are so yummy. 

My friend would take me to restaurants and had to order for us in Cantonese and he'd always get onion pancakes for us.

Very good but they tasted a bit floury despite the frying in oil, I made them exactly as the recipe described for ingredients.   However, I tasted them right after they fried and found they were floury and too crisp.  
 I then steamed them in my bamboo steamer for ~3 min, as the ones I have had before in restaurants were somewhat soft.
  They were good and I will make them again but maybe roll them thinner, so that the flour cooks better.

While the measurments may have been slightly off, we started with just a bit of water and added as we went. Also found that the flour crumbles didnt add anything extra, but also didn't take away from the wonderful flavours. But the taste of these are fantastic, just like at Dim Sum! Now a defenite staple anytime I make stir-fry. Once I got the method down it's easy to make anytime I have the craving! Definite 5 star!

I liked the recipe but it requires more 3/4 cup of flour to make a soft dough. If not, it is impossible to knead! I also made dumpling sauce to complement the dish.

I did not care for this recipe. The dough was wet, sticky and unworkable.

They're way to salty, and you needn't add so much oil. Also, the flour is way off.

They didn't have much flavor, but were enjoyable dipped in soy sauce. The dough was also very sticky so I had to use much more flour than was called for.

Overall, a decent recipe. It was too tough and chewy for my tastes, but I think maybe that was a mistake on my part.

My husband is Chinese and used his recipe. He just used pork meat and green onion and flour. He packed it all together and fried it. They were pretty good.
