I really wanted to this to be good but it didn't quite make it. I added a clove of garlic and a stalk of celery sliced thinly. The flavor wasn't bad it's just that there wasn't much OF IT. Pretty bland even with the garlic addition. I'm also not sure why it calls for water as well as milk. I'd say pick one or the other because I ended up with mushroom a la soup. If I hadn't been so hungry I would have taken a moment to try to thicken it w/ cornstarch or something but I was famished so I ate it as it. Also I don't think I would make this with macaroni. Egg noodles might be a better choice but maybe that's just me. Thanks:)

I make this too when I need a fast but yummy pasta meal for myself. I use spaghetti noodles and while they cook I mix a few tablespoons of the condensed soup with some water chopped onions garlic S and P. Just top the spag with the sauce and some fresh parmesan.

My husband really liked the mushrooms in this. He also liked the parmesan cheese on top. This is his rating since I didn't try the dish. I'm mushroom-ed out.

I made a variation of this dish using only half the water and no milk so the sauce would be thicker. I also added about two cups of frozen veggies pepper to taste and little torn-up pieces of turkey ham because I had it on hand. It came out absolutely delicious this way and with the added veggies I felt I added some good vitamins.

This was very quick and delicious... I did add a few seasonings to it and cut the milk/water ratio in half so it was more sauce like but other than that great!

Much too watery. Why add water to this?
