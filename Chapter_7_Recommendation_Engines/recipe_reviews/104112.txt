This turned out perfectly and you can't tell the difference!  I used the Splenda Brown Sugar Blend in place of the regular brown sugar and used fat free half and half.  The end product is about 1/4 inch thick if you use a 8x8 pan.  I made this for my Grandmother as a gift as well as a few other goodies made with Splenda and it turns out Penuche is a favorite candy of hers that she hasn't had in years since developing diabetes.

Very good treat. Tastes exactly like my favorite penuche recipe. I changed the recipe as follow: (1) do not butter the sides of the pan - why bother? (2) substitute 1/2 c packed splenda/brown sugar for 1 c brown sugar. (3) Substitute 1/3 c fat free half n' half for the loaded variety. (4) Substitute 1/3 c 1 % milk for 2%. Could also use 2/3 c 1% milk. And, I have used skim milk in chocolate fudge with good results. 

This recipe then makes approximately a 6" square, about 1/2" thick.  About 16 pieces.

I live at 6500 feet, so it takes a longer to bring up a soft ball, at least 30 minutes.
