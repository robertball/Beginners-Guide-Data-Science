Yummy!  The beans are a strange addition, but they worked well.  Wouldn't serve over rice or pasta, it doesn't need it, just with a salad and bread.  Did add fresh minced garlic and 2 tablespoons of capers.  Top with fresh parm. cheese and you've got a great meal!

TRY THIS RECIPE!  It is fast, easy and sooo good!  I love this recipe...the only changes I made were to add olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder to the chicken before topping it with olives, beans and sauce!  Also, doesn't need  to be served over pasta...quite filling and delish...3 year old ate the chicken (without topping) and husband loved it as well!

Not sure what others rave about.  My huband and I found this to be very blah.  I even seasoned the chicken first and seared it before baking.  I used kalamata olives, and added fresh garlic, but we still did not enjoy it.  Sorry, but definately would not make again.

I loved this recipe (so did my husband). I even used a cheap can of portabella mushroom spaghetti sauce from Aldi, and it was still great. I recommend throwing into the oven at the same time a ramekin of whole garlic cloves and a little olive oil. It roasts the garlic to an almost carmelly taste and goes well with the dish. Also, I served it with pasta.

This was exceptional.  I used kalamata olives instead of black olives and browned the chicken a bit in olive oil before baking.  (i cut out the last 10 minutes so as not to overcook). Very quick and easy.

This recipe was very quick and flavorful.  I served it with bowtie pasta flavored with a little olive oil and garlic, and it was a hit.  The ingredients are different, but work well together.

I'm a big fan of no-prep, "throw it in a pan and bake it" recipes. I improvised a little by rubbing the chicken breasts with extra virgin olive oil, salt and pepper, and tossing some garlic cloves into the pan as well. I served this on top of mini penne and it was very, very filling. I think the flavor of the dish will depend mostly on the spaghetti sauce you choose. (I used a spicy pepper-flavored sauce and hubby asked that I tone it down next time.) I will probably make this again because it's so easy and the ingredients are minimal and convenient. Thank you, RS Thomas!

This was great! I added 4 links spicy Italian sausage to it and some fresh garlic cloves with plain Ragu. The extra meat required a little longer cook time. This recipe is easy easy easy. Deffinately a keeper. Thanks RS_Thomas! :o)

You could substitute dried great northerns if you cannot find canellini in the Progresso aisle or in the health food section. Tuscans love their beans (more than pasta)! It does not need to be served with added carbohydrates--just add more beans. I liked extra garlic, too. Thanks for the recipe.

This was okay. My husband didn't like it too much... too much sauce. I think next time I will not add the whole can. I added canned mushrooms and a whole can of whole olives, which I sliced. It was good, but I don't know that I'll make it again any time soon.

Easy recipe, not great, but enough with salad and bread. Just add some olive oil and top with Parmesan cheese, and maybe some extra garlic. I love garlic!

This is perfect for those busy nights when you want something simple and nourishing.  I didn’t have the type of spaghetti sauce the recipe calls for, so I used canned diced tomatoes and added seasonings.  I served it with rice topped by freshly grated parmesan.

Very good.  I slit the breast and added sauteed mushrooms/onions and added parmesan cheese on top for last few minutes of cooking.   Seemed a little bland until I spooned the liquid in pan over the breast before serving. Added a lot of flavor

This is a great basic recipe. I have made it twice using pitted kalamata olives - I hate canned black olives - the kalamata olives gives the dish a rich briny taste. I also have added fresh spinach and sliced zucchini, sliced onions. I slice the chicken breasts horizontally rather than beat them with a mallet, salt and pepper them, add some thyme. Spread the olives and then any additional vegetables on the chicken and then the beans and sauce. I initially cooked it for 40 minutes, but the chicken did not cook  quite enough so added another 5 minutes and family said that did the trick. I will continue to experiment with this recipe.  My family really enjoys the flavors.

Excellent dish. Even my grandsons ate every single bite of food on their plates.  I used regular sauce and diced 3 cloves of fresh garlic.  To the regular sauce I then added turmeric, tarragon, rosemary and basil

totally underwhelmed by this dish even though my husband liked it better than the broccoli chicken dish I also made. The chicken was very blah even though I seasoned it with garlic powder, salt and black pepper. Won't be making this one ever again.

Easy recipe to make.  Little prep time, although I could not find canellini beans at 3 grocery stores.  Had to use light red kidney beans.  Extremely easy to make for someone on the go.  Put it in the oven, go for a run, come home and eat.

Cut chicken breast in half, added a pint of fresh mushrooms, tons of Italian seasoning, and garlic. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese last couple minutes and then more once you plate the dish. Also put it on a bed of rigatoni pasta. Served with a fresh crusty French loaf.

I made this as described except I used a tomato-basil sauce, as my is allergic to garlic. I also used sliced Calamata olives as detest the canned sliced black olives.  It was wonderful!  The chicken was very moist and the olives added a great flavor. My wife raved and this will be a welcomed addition to our menu!

Used  thighs instead and added minced garlic, sea salt, pepper and oregano. Used black olives, white Northern bean, tomatoes sauce and topped with Parmesan cheese. It was amazing. Wanted to celebrate our trip to Tuscany in two days. We were not disappointed!

The whole family liked this recipe however they all said it would be better over angel hair pasta- maybe use half a chicken breast per person! I think a little more spaghetti sauce would work better if over past!

I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt, pepper and basil and then browned in coconut oil in the fry pan.  I added fresh mushrooms and used  navy beans.  It was a winner and I will use this recipe often.  Thanks for sharing it.

I gave it a 3 because it LOOKS good.  I absolutely HATE it when someone post a picture of the finished product and it contains things that are NOT in the recipe!  Somebody want to tell me what the other two ingredients are on the top of this chicken besides the "only four" ingredients this plate boasts to be all about?

the basic  recipe is good. For everyone complaining of bland then like myself you need more flavour. I  added chopped garlic ,oregano,basil,thyme ,S&P to the Hunts garlic tomato sauce. Lots of olives,capers,EVO and the beans. I Also used thighs and drumsticks. It was Delish. Served over butternut squash noodles...yummy.
Good basic recipe to tweak for those who like more flavour,but on it own it is still good.

To make it truly 'one pan,' I seared the chicken in evoo & garlic  in an oven proof skillet, added the other ingredients, covered, and baked. Served with salad & crusty Italian bread. Delicioso!

I was very disappointed in this so-called 4 ingredient recipe.   I don't consider canned spaghetti sauce home cooking and nor would any self respecting Italian mama. This is a way to use a prepared product not a real recipe.

This was easy but needs "something" - not sure what but it lacked flavor.  A bit bland for us so I will add some fresh oregano or parsley or ???   It sure is quick but still a shrug when I suggested it again.

This was a good recipe. It needed the garlic flavor in the sauce. Otherwise it would not have any flavor. It is very easy to put together. My guests enjoyed it. I used dark meat so it was tender. I left the olives out because not everyone likes them. I did have it available if people wanted to put on their olives. It needed the olives which I love.  The beans were great in the recipe.

Followed the recipe as written, husband liked it however I would make alterations in future.  400 degrees seemed too high a temperature - chicken was a bit tough, more or less "boiled" in the sauce.  I think I'd try this on the stove top, simmer the sauce for a bit first to thicken it and then add the chicken and beans, simmer gently until the chicken is tender.  I think I'd also try it on pasta, rather than rice.

We love it, eating leftovers tonite. As tasty as you desire, depends on any other olives you might add, or some spices. I pretty much followed the original but did add sliced fresh mushrooms I had on hand that needed using, and they were a good addition.  Also used 2 cans of the beans, and NO rice or salad, some pickled beets on the side was all. YUM

I used the roasted garlic flavored Prego Spaghetti sauce but now think what would be REALLY good is a Roasted RED PEPPER spaghetti sauce instead as the one I used overpowered the flavors.  Also I used an organic cannelli bean which which had  no salt by accident - and very bland.  I cut up my chicken pieces to cook more evenly and added parmesean cheese at serving. It was edible but that was it.  A waste of whole jar of sauce.   Doubt I'll be making it again........

Delicious and easy. I used thighs so the chicken didn't overpower the other ingredients. I made a side dish of wild grain rice and topped it all off with a piece of crusty garlic bread.

This is easy to make and full of flavor. A small side of pasta and salad would be good too.

I used a small cast iron skillet.   I lightly seared both sides of the chicken breasts on the stove.   I then added the olives, and cannellini beans, and finally covered everything with about a cup of leftover tomato sauce from a previous meal.   30 minutes covered, and fifteen minutes uncovered in the oven, produced one of the most flavorful and tender chicken meals I've made in years.    Don't be afraid to improvise.

Very easy, and I will make it again.  I will admit, I used sauce from a jar (Ragu hearty garlic) which was quite tasty.  I topped with fresh mozzarella for the last 10 minutes which was good too.  Used chicken tenders and they were perfectly cooked and moist.  I might try artichoke hearts next time.

I made this recipe as written with the exception of browning the chicken.  Excellent!  Will add artichoke hearts and mushrooms next time.

I cut up my large chicken breasts so that it would cook more evenly.  An interesting combination of ingredients that tasted great.
