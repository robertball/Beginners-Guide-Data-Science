This came out really, really well .  Very pretty, and everyone commented.  However, with all these cold, mayonnaise-based salads, I always cut the mayo in half and use a light sour cream for the other.  To me, it makes it creamier and a lot healthier without sacraficing taste.  Everyone appreciates it, too.  With the added mustard, it is really perfect.  I salt (everything) very lightly and sprinkled a really good layer of pepper over the potatoes.  Also, I used only half the eggs.  The celery adds a welcome crunch.  Make a big batch so you can enjoy it for a few days!  Thanks Dee.

This is a great potato salad!  The only substitution I made was green onion - my kids hate biting into bits of raw, hard onion, so chopped green onions always work nicely for me.  The sweet potatoes added such a nice touch, and my husband, who thinks he hates sweet potato, thought they were carrots and loved them!

This was definitely different but very good.  I think next time I will use 2 sweet potatoes and 1 white potato for a little more of the sweet potato flavor.  I loved the different colors of the salad - very appealing!

I didn't have any eggs on hand & this salad was still great - with eggs I'm sure even better! I found it easier to largely cube the potatoes before boiling, then they only needed twenty minutes cooking time & were all set to toss in the mayo mix.

This potato salad is awesome!!!  I made it with red onions which made it a little strong, so next time I'd use a milder onion. It's still delicious!

Very tasty! I decided to do 1/2 regular mustard and 1/2 dijon mustard... added a little zip that I would definitely recommend trying!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I think the sweet potatos come out best if you steam them.

I didn't care for the sweet potato in this salad, but the rest was okay.  I've had other sweet potato salads that I liked, so I think I just didn't care for the combination of two potatoes.

Delicious! I omitted the celery because I don't like it and it tasted wonderful. I'm going to try making tofu mayonnaise sometime just for this recipe. Then it'll be truly healthy and hopefully delicious with all the other strong flavors.  Thanks!

Several reviewers have stated that the sweet potatoes give this dish a lot of color.  A sweet potato has cream-colored flesh, not orange. They must have been using yams, which many mistake for the sweet potato.  Yams have deep orange flesh and they are very, very sweet.  I have found that few grocers know the difference - so check carefully before you buy your sweet potatoes!

Very good dish. I took the advice of some other reviews and added red pepper and apple and substituted in green onions. I also added curry powder to the mayonaise dressing. Variations are endless. Good one.

We absolutely love this potato salad, it is now requested at all of our family BBQs and I never get to bring home leftovers!  I am not an onion fan so I leave it out and I boil my sweet potato seperately from my potatoes since it doesn't take as long to cook.  I always double or triple this recipe!  Thanks!

This is the best potato salad I have ever made. Running late once again for a dinner party, I ended up serving it warm. I apologized to my guests, but they loved it! So try this dish as a warm potato salad - the flavors come together so well.

If you are a beginner like me, and over boiled your potatoes and they are all mushy. Once you've cubed them, throw them on a cookie sheet and throw them in the freezer until they are somewhat stiff. That way it doesn't mush even more when you mix it all in with the mayo mix. Thanks for the recipe :)

I really enjoyed this salad, but my favorite part was actually an addition that I made because of what I had in my fridge.  I boiled 2 red potatoes and 1/2 of a large sweet potato for 30 minutes.  After 15 minutes, I placed 3 eggs in the pot to boil with the potatoes for the final 12-15 min.  Next time I will wait until the potatoes have been cooking for 20 minutes because I felt the eggs were a little bit overcooked.  When the potatoes and eggs were finished I drained them and set them aside to cool.  During that time, I chopped up 2 stalks of celery and an apple (I did not have an onion but wanted to add something for flavor).  I then chopped up the potatoes and eggs and mixed them with the veggies.  I combined the mixture with 1/4 cup mustard (I looove mustard) and 3/4 cup light mayo.  I seasoned to taste and let cool.  The apple added SO much to the salad.  Thanks for the start of something delicious!

I made this for a cookout and it was really popular - the dish was wiped clean. I didn't make an alterations, other than using a little more mustard than called for, because I like the heat. Paprika never goes wrong - might try that next time. The second time I made it with a little diced red pepper and that worked. My only tips are to dice the celery and red onion pretty small, squish the potato pieces a little with your hands as you put them into the bowl, and don't skimp on the mayo!

My family really liked this salad.  I will admit, I used my own potato salad dressing recipe, but used the sweet potatoes with the regular potatoes.  I really liked the color difference, it looked so festive!  And it was gone before I knew it.

Next time I make this, I would cook my sweet potato separate from the regular potatoes as the sweet ones cook faster. I found them a little to 'mushy' while combining the salad ingredients.

Love it! Nice change from regular potato salad. I subbed some sour cream and plain yogurt for half the mayo. I did not like the sour cream taste in it much, so next time, I will only sub with plain yogurt. Other than that, very tasty! Thanks for sharing!

I wasn't too sure about this recipe at first, but it turned out really good. I wasn't sure about the sweet potato egg combination, but it is really good. I did cut the salt and pepper in half, I am glad I did it would have been way to peppery for my taste. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This was delicious. The flavor improved the longer it was left to chill. I dont like raw onions so I used green onions chopped very fine. I find them much more tolerable. I also used a little less mayo and used a little dijon mustard mixed with regular mustard. The first time I made it I used yams and the second time i used sweet potatoes. Both times it was excellent.

I'm not crazy about sweet potato salad so I just used regular potatoes. It came out very tasty.  It could probably use less mayo though. I added green, red peppers and small cut up pieces of celery.  It was great everybody loved it.

Very good.  I took the sweet potato's out about 10mins. earlier than the white because they cook faster.  Will be making this again.

Since potato salad isn't one of my top 10 favorites, I was looking for a change to the standard.  This is a good recipe and I agree with others who mentioned that it could use more flavor.  I used only sweet potatoes.  I peeled and cubed them before cooking so cooking time was only about 10 minutes (even with a larger cut I think 30 minutes would give you mush), plus I cooked them in chicken broth instead of water.  Immediately after draining I spread them on a cookie sheet, and drizzled with a mixture of 2 Tbsp mustard and 2 Tbsp cider vinegar.  I tossed the potatoes in this  (The hot potatoes soak up a great deal of flavor this way) and then refrigerated them for about 30 minutes.  Then I added them to the celery, egg and onion (I used a medium sized Vidalia and used the whole thing).  I used half mayo and half sour cream and cut the mayo mixture with some milk to make it thinner.   Even with the flavorful potatoes and the whole onion, it is still pretty bland.  Next time I think I'll go with a stronger onion and maybe consider a Dijon mustard or one with horseradish.  It's a good start but not quite a 5 star for us.

Like several other reviewers suggested I used 2 sweet potatoes and green onion. I actually found it made the salad a bit too sweet. If I make this again I'll use less mayo and maybe a smidge of wine or white vinegar. The best part of this salad, though, is how pretty it looked with the surprising colours. Looks very impressive.

Just found this recipe a couple weeks ago and have already made it twice.  The kids, hubby, and neighbors all love it!  Made it once with yams and once with sweet potatos - great either way.

I leave the onions out of this recipe, other than that we love it!  Everyone that tries it wants me to make more or give them the recipe and there's never any left overs to bring home.

I loved this potato salad! I had it along-side baked honey mustard chicken, and the honey mustard from the chicken tasted AMAZING with the slight sweetness of the sweet potatoes. The next time I make this, I am going to add a bit of honey mustard to it as well, or possibly just replace most of the yellow mustard with it. Delicious!

This is so good.  I added some sweet relish, and I roasted sweet potatoes and tossed it in.  A dash of paprika gave it a tiny bit of a kick.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  Even though it's not aesthetic, it's a tasty keeper!

Great potato salad! It's getting me in the mood for summer. I wonder if the amounts of pepper and salt are errors, though. You only need 1/2 t salt and 1/4 t pepper, otherwise it overwhelms the dish (especially the pepper). I used Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard and it was soooo yummy. I'm saving this one.

We've made this recipe at least twice recently & it still comes up a winner. Incredibly addictive taste - once you start you can't stop. It is a definite recipe to keep esp for picnics & hot summers.

Just made this for tonight. YUM! I made equivalent of sweet potato to regular potato (just so I could use up my sweet potatoes). Again YUM! I never would have thought to incorporate sweet potatoes into my potato salad. Thanks a YUMMY BUNCH for sharing this recipe!!!  It's a keeper!!!!  :)

Not only a yummy recipe, but so visually appealing also.  Be careful not to overcook the potatoes or the potato salad will look like pinkish mashed potatoes rather than having the pretty distinctive variations in color.  I used red potatoes and yams and added sweet pickles and it was gorgeous.  white, orange, and green - a very colorful salad.  Everybody raved about it at our family picnic.

I am someone who spends every spring looking for new summer salads.  This is the best that I have ever found.  I do find that if you use the ammount of salt recommended its better to sit and not eat immediatly. I might actually reduce that salt and I dont think it would matter.  Wonderful!  My new favorite potato salad!!!

I come from one of the homes of sweet potato and would just like to say that in actual fact there are at least 3 different types of sweet potatoes. Yes, the original ones are flesh coloured but nowdays there are also gold and red coloured ones. These are quite different to yams but are definitely sweet potato or kumara as we call them in NZ. They are also prolific here where i live in China and they too have the 3 colours. I hope this helps.

This is my favorite potato salad!  It has just the right amount of mayo (I hate when there's too much), and I love that you can taste the mustard.  The celery adds a nice crunch to it.  Best salad!

One of the best potato salad recipes ever! So easy to make and healthier then the store bought salad. I did reduce the amount of mayonnaise by 1/4 cup and used a sweet onion which didn't give it that onion taste. Also, I pulled the sweet potatoes out about 5-10 mins early because they cooked much faster then the regular brown potatoes.  All in all, a wonderful recipe!

Delish!  My husband doesn't like potato salad, but he gobbled this one up!  I made a few changes that I would recommend:  I used ONLY sweet potatoes, added a chopped apple (left the skin on all...it's good for you!), cut down on the mayo, added a bit more mustard and a couple heaping spoonfulls of sweet relish.  very good, will make over and over!

WOW, this was fantastic and that is not a comment I throw around lightly.  The only thought I have is to watch the sweet potato closely while they're cooking.  My big old sweet tater was done about ten minutes before the white ones and I had to fish it out of the water to keep it from getting mushy. Wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing!

I was skeptical at first, but decided to go for it and take this to a 4th of July party. It was a hit. I was glad I had doubled the recipe. My only changes (after doubling) were that I used 4 sweet potatoes and 4 white potatoes, making it half and half. I didn't have any eggs on hand (and was not about to go to the grocery store on the eve of a holiday!) so I had to leave those out. Next time, I'll be sure to add them. I also used leeks and chives from the garden for a milder onion flavor. Luscious and colorful! Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good! I used sweet onion and made sure to chop it VERY finely. No one (my kids!) could tell the onions were there but the flavor was wonderful with them. I also used Red potatoes and left the skin on. Wonderful. Was a hit with everyone, even my kids who dislike sweet potatoes in anything else!

Made this recipe exactly as stated.  Excellent!  Eaten by even the picky people! Oh, the only change I made was that I used honey mustard instead of regular.  Definitely a keeper.

This is simply amazing.  I did make some alterations - I used about 2 1/2 tablespoons of brown mustard with horseradish and didn't use any black pepper.  I also used light mayo without any flavor being sacrificed.  Next time I might try substituting a little sour cream for some of the mayo to impart even more creaminess. This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing, Dee!

Not bad.  I like that it used sweet potato, which adds more nutrients, but it basically just tastes like a typical potato salad. Nothing spectacular about the taste.

This was phenomenal--really yummy!  I was trying to see how I could make potato salad a little more "healthy", and this did it!  My husband despises sweet potato, and so I didn't tell him what was in it before he took a bite.  He even ate it after I told him what was in it.  I also added a small bag of Hormel bacon bits to the salad.  To keep it even healthier, I used red potatoes and kept the skins on.  VERY GOOD!  I will definately make this again!  Thanks for the great idea!

Simply delicious, really simple, yet effective. Served this at a barbeque and it went FAST! I added some radishes in there as well, and a little extra mayonaise, and served it in a hollowed out cabbage. Very good.

VERY yummy!!  I used 2 sweet potatoes and 3 white.  also do recommend cooking the sweet potatoes for less time than the white ones b/c they cook faster.  Will definatley make again, received all good compliments when I took this to a cookout dinner party.

There is nothing setting this recipe apart as a 5 star taste.The addition of a sweet potato is unique but the dressing is the same as many other recipes I have tried, okay but not special. I won't make this again...sorry

YUM! I used blue potatoes - because I happened to get them from my CSA - and garnet yams for the sweet potatoes. This was really pretty and very tasty. It was a little too much pepper for us though, so next time I'll use a little less. Otherwise, fantastic!

This is WONDERFUL!!!  I will make this over and over again.  I love the combination of sweet potato and regular potato.  I've used several different kinds of non sweet potatoes in making it.  They're all good!

I liked this a lot. I do think it's a bit too peppery. I reduced it to about a tsp. and think it'd be better with even less. It got rave reviews by our dinner guests as well! We did use 2 sweet potatoes and 1 red potato. I also used 1/3 T yellow mustard, 1/3 T coarse ground mustard and 1/3 T spicy brown mustard. Thanks for the recipe!

this was really good.  It was the first time I had ever tried a potato salad using a sweet potato and it was a nice touch.  I peeled and quartered the potato's before I boiled them.  I also sprinkled some sliced green onions on top to make it pretty.  I think this was the most attractive looking potato salad I had ever seen.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this but used an extra sweet potatoe. The flavor was spot on and impressive. Although the texture of the sweet potatoe takes some getting used to. I think that it would be a great addition to a family gathering because its so unique and creative in looks and taste.

My husband loved it. I felt half an onion is too much. I used a yellow onion and it just over powered the whole salad. I felt it was missing something so next time I will experiment by adding something I'm not sure what. I think it is easier or faster to peal the potatoes and chop them how you like like them, before you boil them.

Very good, just stuck with recipe some what and came out great. Wasn't sure on the cooking of the potatoes but I peeled them first then cooked till I could stick a fork in them a little ways. The sweet potato I cut into chunks as big as the regular potatoes  because it was pretty big.

Very nice potato salad...my sweet potatoes ended up just mixing in with the mayo and it gave it a reddish tint.  Very good still.  I like the crunch of the celery and onion as well.

Suprisingly good!  I did add just a small amount of chopped yellow and orange bell peppers.  I also added some parsley at the end.  It was very delicious!  I never mixed sweet and regular potatos before -but will definitely make again!  I doubled it to serve 6 people and it was all gone! Served it with roasted turkey breast and green beans.  Paired well!  Can't wait to make it again!

This turned out delicious! The family was a little nervous about it at first (what, sweet potatoes that aren't covered in sugar??) But everyone really enjoyed it! I only used 1/4 cup mayo and added 1/4 light sour cream instead. I used celery seeds instead of celery. Also added some fresh basil and chives.

OMG this is sooooo good. I've made it twice now & the 2nd time I omitted the mustard. I used vidalia onion also instead of regular onion. What a hit! Hubby loves it & he's hard to please. My older son who gags on sweet potatoes loves it and my younger son who refuses to eat baked potatoes also loves it. I will never make regular potato salad again. Thank you for a killer dish.

Followed the recipe exactly as it was written.  But I added the mayo according to taste, and the salt, I sprinkled just a little, so it wouldn't have too much salt. It ended up tasting delicious, and my husband and I could have finished the whole bowl! The only thing I will change next time, is to add more salt, and to chop the celery more fine. Great taste!

This is a good twist to plain old potato salad. I love the added nutrition with the sweet potatoes!

This is a really great recipe. We used the small red potatoes with the skin on and added black olives to give it more color and flavor. Also added a tsp of white vinegar and a tsp of lemon pepper to give it a little extra kick. The sweet potatoes give a sweet twist to traditional potato salad. Went really well with our 4th of July bbq dinner!

I just finished making this potato salad. It is wonderful. I'm always looking for ways to make a recipe more healthy so using sweet potatoes was a great idea. I used 2 sweet potatoes and 2 white potates and added a little red pepper and dollop of sour cream for a more creamy taste. Thanks so much for the recipe. This has now become my #1 recipe for potato salad.

Delicious. There is one thing I should've done. I should've soaked chopped onions in water or chopped them smaller pieces before mixing them in the potato mixture. We tasted the onion a bit too strong in the salad.

I made this as written the first couple of times...and it's GREAT!  However, adding a couple of splashes of vinegar (I use rice wine) to the hot potatoes really enhances and sharpens the flavor.  Try this recipe...it's better and more interesting with the sweet potatoes...

Very good!  It wasn't so different from a typical potato salad.  The sweet potatoes just added a slightly different taste, not to mention the the extra nutrition that comes from sweet potatoes.  Everyone enjoyed it and we will definitely make it again!

I thought this was really good, and a nice change of pace from regular potato salad.  But I made a bunch of it for a family gathering and hardly anyone ate it or commented on it (while other dishes I prepared got rave reviews).  So while I might make it again for my family, I won't make this again for a crowd.

This was awesome.  I made it for Easter.  The only thing I changed was I used miracle whip instead of mayo(which is standard for my house).  Since none of the kids made it this year it was just Hubby (who LOVES potato salad) and me.  When I told him what I was going to make he said, "Just make me some without the sweet potatoes in case I don't like it."  Guess which one he ate?  Then he said, "Why don't you make some more sweet potatoes and add them to the leftovers?"

I have made this recipe at least 5 times now and it really is very good. I had never attempted making potato salad before, but this sounded so good with the combination of sweet and white potatoes. Even my picky family liked it. It is definately a keeper. Thank you Dee for sharing this recipe.

This was soooooooooooooooooooooooooo Delish!!!! I made it last night for a family gathering, and everybody loved it thankyou. It was so easy to make, i read the reviews on it first so i held back on the pepper, and i added fresh chives to the mayo, apart from that i made it as is.

This is a great recipe.  I used 2 sweet potatoes to 1 white potato.  I don't cook sweet potatoes very often - just a note, don't over cook the sweet potatoes.  They cook faster than white potatoes and can get pretty mushy! I also omitted the eggs. Excellent dressing on the salad.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made this along with chicken wings and ribs for our Super Bowl party. Everyone commented on the unusual combination of white potatoes and sweet potatoes,  and it was a hit. I omitted celery (don't like it), and I peeled and boiled the potatoes. I boiled the sweet potatoes first as they take longer to cook than the white potatoes. Don't worry about the sweet potatoes being too sweet - they're much less sweet when boiled.  It was really good, but I will add a little more salt and more mustard next time for personal preference. YUMMY!

Very good, its a nice way to add a little more flavor and color to that boring potato recipe :) Next time I'd cut down on the prepared mustard a bit other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

I like this recipe better than my regular mustard potato salad.  I changed two parts of the recipe-I microwaved the potatoes, let them cool and skinned them and used green onions.  I will never make plain old mustard potato salad again!!

I used two sweet potatoes (one large one small) and half a cup of mayo with half a cup of sour cream. I loved the consistency, some thought it needed to be more mayo, depending on how you like your salads!

This was my first time making potato salad and I didn't have sweet potatoes so I used butternut squash. It was alright but that's about all. It was easy which was nice for my first time but there isn't much depth of flavor. It was missing something.. Not sure what.

Five stars.  Didn't have any onions in the house, so used onion powder.  Lots of it.  Overcooked the sweet potatoes, but that worked great because they absorbed the ingredients more fully.  I used a tad more American mustard than called for.  Left out the celery.  Used five eggs and 3 or 4 regular potatoes.

I loved the combination of the sweet potatoes and regular potatoes. The crunchy celery is a must. I thought there was too much sauce (but maybe my potatoes were too small). Next time, I will cut the mayo down to 1/2 cup.

This salad had great flavor especially on the second day.  I'm not a huge potato salad fan but the sweet potatoe gave it some color and added to the taste.

I've made this potato salad for various different occassion (bringing to other people's bbq's too) it's a hit everytime!  the only substitution I do based on other reccommendations is I use green onions.   Make this for your next bbq - it'll be an instant hit!

Yum Yum!  I made this and no one even knew it had sweet potato in it.  I also added a dash of dill weed, sweet pickle relish, fresh chopped cilantro and 2 diced fresh tomatoes.  It was fresh and yummy!

I made this to go with a BBQ rib dinner. I used a sweet potato from Mississippi,to my surprise it had very little orange color but was very sweet.It was also much smaller than a normal sweet potato.I cubed the potatoes to the size I wanted cooked and cooled them. and mixed it with the dressing. My only addition was some diced fresh red peppers. I will make this again but found the dressing a bit thin and will cut back on the mayonnaise. I also used a Cajun seasoned salt to give it a little zing.

I love sweet potatoes. This was good, but the dressing needs something. I loved the celery in this, but my onion was really strong. I will definitely try again, but work on the dressing. Some white vinegar added a pleasant tang.

I love this recipe and use it all the time. I think the secret is playing around to hit a mix that you suits your preferences. I tend to use an equal amount of each potato and add mustard to taste instead of sticking with the tbsp called for. I also like to add some dill or green onion and paprika. Happy eating!

The sweet potatoes were barely noticeable in this recipe - they just blended in like everything else.  I also added in some bits of red pepper, and that added a nice kick to the basic potato salad.

This is a good recipe, but since yams are not a big favorite in my household, I think I'll just stick to using russets and red potatoes when I make potato salad. Adding sour cream to any mayonnaise dressing is, IMHO, always a good idea. Tossing in other vegetables (e.g., fresh green or red peppers, radishes, zucchini, frozen peas and/or canned corn) and meats (e.g., bacon or bacon bits, ham, cooked chicken or turkey, etc.) also serves to "boost" the salad, transforming it into a genuinely good luncheon meal. A bit more spice (perhaps a sprinking of paprika and/or a 1/2 teaspoon of horseradish) and some herbs (e.g., parsley, cilantro, basil or dill) and this recipe -- with or without the yams -- becomes simply GREAT!

Very good.  I added a little olive oil and vinegar while the potatoes were hot.  I do think that you have to like sweet potatoes to like this recipe. My husband doesn't like them, so he ate around them.

I used this recipe on Sunday afternoon. We had friendas around after church and I needed something easy to do and fast to prepare. It got the thumbs up from everyone, I added extra celery to give the dish a bit more of a crunchy texture and that worked really well. I live in England and trying out American recipes on my pals.

Great idea with the sweet potatoes--had no idea it would taste this good! Only thing I would change is to take out the onions altogether. The celery gives it enough of a crisp and the onions overpower the salad.

I like the idea of adding sweet potato to a standard potato salad because they are rich in nutrients. I increased the hard cooked eggs to 6 because we enjoy the "eggy" flavor. I also sub'd minced green onion for the chopped sweet onion, and as always, used Dijon mustard to impart a hint of white wine flavor. Yummy! Thanks for sharing.

I made this on the spur of the moment and didn't have any celery or celery seasonings, so I chopped a few green onions for color.

I am making this recipe today for my mother-in-law's b-day and all I can say is we haven't even made it to her house yet and I can't keep her son or my family out of it.  They have shrugging their nose about this for 2 days since I told them I was going to make it.  However, they all love sweet potatoes and I am sure they will not be disappointed, if so more for us to bring home!

Not bad at all. I usually fry the onions in as little oil as possible before adding to the potatoes, and find that this gives a nice sweetness.  I mixed in a handful of chopped chile which contributed a delicious kick to an otherwise regular salad dish.

Disclaimer: I made quite a few additions... due to dietary restrictions... added chopped orange peppers, sugar snap peas, pickles and bacon. It had enough of the flavors of my mom's traditional potatoe salad to make it feel reminiscent and indulgant without the extra carbs and calories! My family loved the extra crunch of the snap peas! Can't wait to make this again!

Left out onion. Daughter did not like it. She said it was too spicy. May need to back off on the pepper. Son would not touch.

I’ve been making this for over 10 years now...but never reviewed it. This is a wonderful salad!  It is requested every time I go to a party or barbecue. Just one change that I always do...switch the potatoes to 2 sweet and 1 white potato. Everything else is perfect. I was very hesitant to use so much black pepper, but I always try recipes as written the first time so I know what I might want to change. I’m not a fan of mustard or heavy black pepper. But this dressing is absolutely perfect!  Thanks!

Easy to make and tastes good. I used spring onions for a fresher effect and added frozen peas for more colour.

I was looking for a way that my son would eat sweet potatoes and have finally found it.  He won't eat them any other way. I'm hoping over time this will help expand his palette for sweet potatoes.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use 1/2 cup mayonnaise and 1/4 cup plain greek yogurt to try to improve the healthiness of the dressing. Everyone loved it.

I made it with half sweet potato and half white potato, reduced the mayonnaise a bit, and  eliminated the celery.  Friends were still talking about it days later, so this is a new favorite of ours.

didnt have celery so substituted fresh steamed green beans. used one large sweet potato, one smaller russet, and 3 chopped eggs. I'm on an acid free diet, so used mustard powder and tons of dill weed, garlic powder and celery seed to make up for the loss of the prepared mustard which has vinegar. Thanks for the recipe

This is a WINNER! I  tweaked a bit by adding a teaspoon of curry to the mayo mix & about a tablespoon of sugar...I also seasoned the potatoes with garlic powder, onion powder, cracked black pepper, seasoning salt (teaspoon each). Perfect! Was a crowd pleaser at my pre-Thanksgiving party. Several requests for the recipe.

I left out the eggs because the folks are watching their cholesterol and I didn't have any celery or mustard on hand. Nixed the onion too. My family is not fond of mayo, so I used Miracle Whip instead. Tossed in a can of drained mixed vegetables and it was a hit! I think next time I will switch the potatoes around for variety and see how it works.

It was okay, I suppose. Not really my taste. Too sweet and the flavour of onion didn't really blend well with the sweet potato imo.

Great summer recipe, made it for first time this weekend and it was a big hit.  I did adjust the seasoning to taste instead of following the recipe exactly but meanwhile have to eliminate celery, hubby and kids hate celery but the onion still gave it a crunch. This will be a family regular recipe especially for hot days.

This would've been better with a lot less pepper and mustard.  The way it is hid the sweet potato flavor, and I even used 2 sweet potatoes and 1 white potato.

I also put 2 eggs instead. I add half of a red pepper (sweet one) and one green onion that I though added more taste and color. It is good to redo it for a party but it's not the kind of salad you eat for lunch as if you take a small portion it's really good but if you eat too much it get too much, heavy like any potato salad. Next time I will use 1.5 of white and sweat potato as I like the taste of both equally.

me & my bf didn't like it at all...this was my first SWEET potato salad i wanted to make. Usually i have my recipes for regular potato salads (a couple of them). I even REREAD to make sure i put right amounts for the right ingredients, etc, etc...i didn't make any mistakes but it turned out bad...we DID eat some for the dinner...i still can't believe how it turned out...i always choose the recipes which has 4 to 5 rating, and also the recipes with the familiar ingredients..i don't get it...

I made it as written and it was really great.  Then I made it again with another reviewer's suggestion of substituting half the mayo with sour cream and felt that it was even better.  Thanks Gramz!

This is a great way to change potato salad.  The sweet potato in it was scrumptious.  I also made it with all white potatoes (for folks who don't like sweet ones) and it was also very, very tasty.

What an easy and yummy recipe!  I didn't have an sweet potatoes, so I just used some red potatoes I had on hand.  I added about a 1/2 tsp. paprika to the dressing mixture and used a sweet/hot mustard in place of regular mustard; it was awesome!  I'm sure the recipe would have been just as wonderful as written!  Thanks!

Made this tonight for the first time and it is delish! My husband does not even like sweet potatoes, and said he couldn't taste them. He really love'd it! As other's suggested, I only added an extra sweet potatoe! Followed the rest of the recipe to a T. I will be making this for my son's graduation party this June! Thanks for sharing it!

Absolutely loved this!  Next time my husband wants me to use just sweet potatoes.  It was very refreshing.  What a great idea- I never would have thought to use sweet potatoes in potato salad.

Delicious. I'm a big fan of straight-up potato salad, and I love this version with sweet potatoes. The contrasting flavors and textures of perfect potatoes really come through. Since I reviewed this in 2008, I've never made potato salad any other way. It's great.

I found this recipe to be a nice change to your average potato salad. The sweet potato gave it a nice added flavor. I used a touch of apple cidar vinegar and next time I will use the sour cream to cut the calories down, like other users did. Thanks for a great recipe! I will make again.

Very good.  The sweet potatoes add nutrition and a little sweetness.  A nice twist.  However, I found it to be a bit bland so I added some coriander and hungarian paprika which seemed to help.

I made this for a BBQ at the in-laws.  The orange color, and unique sweet potato flavor made this a hit amongst the other potato salads present.

This recipe did not taste bad, but I found no difference in adding sweet potatoes. The taste was the same as my other potato salad. It did add a little color, if that is what you are going for.

Absolutely delicious! I did cut the salt to a 1/2 tsp. and added two Tbs of spcy brown mustard instead of regular. It came out so good that I ate the whole thing in one day!

Pretty good, but didn't taste much different than regular potato salad. I will make this again, but add more mustard and experiment with the dressing - it needed something more flavorful. But it went over great at a church potluck - no one had ever heard of using sweet potatoes.

I have always hated potato salad, but I love this!  I changed the recipe a bit though.  I didn't have any sweet potatoes so I used all regular ones.  I also fried the onion first because I hate raw onion and I think it made it taste much nicer.  I also added some grated cheese, about 1/4 cup.

I loved the idea but we didn't care for the sweet potatoes in this recipe.  They don't hold their texture and come out rather mushy.  I am not sure that a potato salad really does this wonderful little vegetable justice.  Three stars for the creative idea.
