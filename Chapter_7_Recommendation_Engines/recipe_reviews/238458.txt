These are like a kicked up Asian-y version of buttered noodles, and we LOVED them! I did adjust it a bit to suit our tastes, but I still used all ingredients called for...I added more butter than called for (3 Tbsps.), only used 2 Tbsps. sriracha sauce, added a bit of salt, to taste and reduced the dried basil to 1/2 tsp., due to personal preference. This would be a great side to any meat or fish. I served them as a side for buffalo chicken wings, and they were a big hit. Next time, I wanna use sesame oil in place of the peanut oil to add extra flavor. I could totally see college kids making this, lol. I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

My girls and I made this for a quick lunch.  We had some leftover chicken cutlets and broccoli that we chopped up and added in. Gave it a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese to finish. Only changes from the actual recipe were I used olive oil as I don't use peanut oil and I added some fresh garlic.  Good recipe you can play around with!

I do not eat noodles, but my husband really enjoyed this! I made the recipe as-is, except used whole wheat rotini and sesame oil (instead of egg noodles and peanut oil), as that's what I had on hand. I served this with grilled chicken and steamed broccoli. He said he is looking forward to having the left overs for lunch tomorrow.
Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Really amazing! I made it with slightly more sriracha than called for because apparently I'm a masochist and enjoy quite a kick :D

Loved these! They were pretty spicy. I took another reviewers suggestion and added some kielbasa I had sliced and browned in olive oil to make it a meal.

I can drink Tabasco straight--bar bet stuff--so making a Sriracha sauce is fine (only change, like everyone else, sesame oil), but it was less fun on pasta than expected.  Not likely to replay...the Asian noodles on SimplyRecipes is more my thing.

It was ok. Makes a nice, quick lunch, but a little too much of a kick for my taste, even though I quite like spicy foods. I followed the recipe exactly as listed except I used fresh basil from the garden rather than dried. 
Would recommend cutting back on the amount of sriracha in this recipe as it completely overpowers all other flavors.

My husband was going to make spaghetti and just put sriracha on it and eat it with hot dogs. That sounded ok for a quick meal, but I wanted something a bit more. I did a search on the internet for "sriracha spaghetti" and came across this recipe that used mostly ingredients I had on hand. I used whole-what thin spaghetti, fresh basil and omitted the paprika because I didn't have any. I cut up some turkey hot dogs and added those. This recipe was ridiculously easy. I will be making it a lot on days that I have to work until six or seven.

This was sooo good. You may need to adjust the amount of siracha or peanut sauce depending on your tastes. I didn't have peanut sauce and used toasted sesame seed oil instead; it was just as fantastic, I might even prefer it that way. And if you want a quick dinner, throw in some pieces of chicken or other meat with the sauce and noodles. , I might even just cook chicken in the sauce without the noodles. This is a quick, easy, and tasty recipe. Highly recommend it!

I chunked up turkey kielbasa and mixed it in. This added a lot to the dish.

I found this recipe to be so delicious.  I am always looking for meatless recipes and this one made the list of the meatless dinners.

Ok so I made this exactly as written.  It's waaay too hot.  3 Tbs of sriracha is overkill, so the second time I made it I cut it down to 2 Tbs, added more vinegar and butter.  That made this a very tasty satisfying meal with some bite, I really liked it.

I like sriracha, but even at 2-2.5 tbsp it was bordering on too much. 3.5 tbsp and it would have be inedible. I used the Kikkoman brand though, and maybe that's got more kick than the Huy Fong brand. Even if you're a fan of spicy, I'd recommend maybe starting out with a third of the recipe amount and give it a taste. You can always add more later.

Just ok. Kind of dry.
