These sausage grinders were fantastic! I used jalapeno instead of the goat horn peppers and made a mascarpone cheese substitute out of the following ingredients:

1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese; 
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream; and
2 1/2 tablespoons sour cream.

Soften the cream cheese prior to mixing the ingredients. 

Also, I did not use a food processor for the garlic spread. I just mixed my ingredients together, spread it on the hoagie buns, and toasted them.
