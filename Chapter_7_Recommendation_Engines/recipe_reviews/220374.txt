I have been making this for my boys for a week now. It is our breakfast and I sneak in 6 spinach leaves as well. YUM! We use the light v8 fusion blueberry/pomegrande (sp?) and you can do so many things with this!

I've been doing smoothies for the last month or so, but to avoid excess sugar, I'd sub the V8 juice w/water and use plain yogurt. The blueberries will make this sweet enough on their own. If not, a splash of agave nectar will do the trick AND it'd be diabetic friendly.

Delicious and nutritious!  This was so simple to put together and had a wonderful flavor.  You can easily sub strawberries or bananas for the blueberries and make it to suite your own tastes.  I used a fat free greek vanilla yogurt to make it nice and thick.

I use this recipe, too.  I use aronia berries instead of blueberries.  Aronia berries are much healthier.

Hubby n I have been drinking these for a while now. I add instant oatmeal to the blender and Boy is it filling and oh so YUMMY! !!  Makes getting out the door for work Very easy.  This is the kind of drinking and driving I Totally love and encourage Everyone to try!! Want to change it up?  Use any fruit or juice you like. Freeze it and it gives the smoothie more texture. If you use apple n cinny oatmeal, it tastes like apple pie!

I did not have the specific juice asked for in this recipe, I used a cranberry blend I had on hand. I threw in a banana for thickness. Absolutely delicious!

I really enjoy this. Easy to make.  The last few times I have used V8 V-Fusion light strawberry banana, Stonyfield 0% fat french vanilla, and mixed frozen fruit. Yummy.
