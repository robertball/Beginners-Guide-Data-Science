I didn't cook for 40mins like the recipe says, more like 20ish because it popped back when touched and a toothpick came out clean at that time. I added chocolate chips. I used cinnamon applesauce. It was very bland but moist. I felt like the batter was a bit thick. The finished muffin really stuck to the paper.  They smell really nice though. I'm still going to eat them but probably won't use this recipe again.
