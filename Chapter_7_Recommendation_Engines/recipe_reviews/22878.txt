I agree that this cookie is unbelievably delicious. We put the marshmellows in the freezer for a couple of hours before putting them into the batter. It keeps the cookies from looking too mutated.

I followed the advice of using parchment paper and decreasing the temperature to 350 degrees and baked them for 9 minutes. They turned out fabulous! My kids love them! This is a keeper! Thank you for sharing this wonderful cookie recipe!

The cookies are messy and tend to fall apart easily.  To avoid this, try rolling the dough in your hands to create a ball.  Then place on the cookie sheet.  They will come out a lot neater this way.  I also added an extra 2 toblespoons of cocoa to the mixture...MMMM MMMM...They are the best-tasting cookies I've had in a long time!  Well worth the mess!!

I read Michelle's review & followed her suggestion of rolling the dough into 1" balls...this worked well. I flattened them slightly w/ a cup dipped in cocoa. I think next time I make these I won't mix the marshmallows into the dough...I will roll the dough around a mini marshmallow. Very tasty cookie!

Use tin foil sprayed with vegtable spray instead of coating a cookie sheet. They make a mess.

I didn't have mini marshmallows, only regular size.  I cut the mini's up but it was disaster when they baked.  I would not recommend using regular size marshmallows.

I make this recipe for an annual cookie exchange, and need to start making it more often for my family to enjoy throughout the year! I do the following to make them perfect: instead of mixing marshmallows into the dough, I press 3 into each ball right before baking, and I bake at 350 for 9 minutes exactly. I am planning to up the amt. of cocoa powder to 1/2 cup to give it a stronger chocolate taste next time, too.

These are the best cookies I have ever tasted in my life! Best to use harder marshmellow's (sit out in over night to make a little stale) the marshmellow's don't mix / melt in with the cookie when baking that way!

I used parchment paper and the cookies didn't stick. Also, I underbaked them (350 for 9 minutes) and they weren't hard afterwards. Yes, they look mutated, but they're really tasty.

Finally a recipe I can modify to be gluten free without tasting gluten free.  Substitute 1 cup Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Flour, 3/4 cup rice flour and add just under one teaspoon of xanthan gum in place of the regular flour. My 9 year old daughter who has to eat gluten free loved them and even her 11 year old brother who hates gluten free deserts liked them. He said he could eat 3 trays of them. Thanks TOMBOYGIRL!

I thought this cookie tasted awesome! Definitely get your chocolate craved cured and gooey sweet tooth happy. They are not the prettiest looking but they make up for it in taste. I refrigerated the dough for like 2 hours. I was nervous reading the reviews from others. But I rolled them into balls then into cocoa. They looked liked truffles until I pressed them down a bit. I baked them for 9 min at 350. I definitely will make these again,

I was disappointed with this. First they wouldn't cook, then they burnt, all the marshmellows stuck to the tin foil, EVEN with the cooking spray. By the time I figured out the exact timing for cooking this it was the last batch and I was very bummed. BUT if you feel like eating a good cookie that is very messy and a big pain this is it!!

Good cookies, but messy; I made them because I had the ingredients in my kitchen and wanted to use extra marshmallows up. I made as other reviewers suggested (350 for 9 minutes), but I didn't have parchment paper, so I used wax paper instead. Cookies must be removed quickly to dry; if they dry to the wax paper, the melted marshmallows are devilish to get off.

I would rate these 5 stars using some of the changes recommended.  With a couple tablespoons more cocoa powder, baking at 350, and putting 3 marshmallows on top of each rather than mixing them in, they were delicious.  They turned out fudgey in the middle, and the marshmallows were light brown.  My husband declared them his new favorite!

I thought these cookies were great! I followed the recipe except I didn't add the marshmallows into the mixture. I froze the marshmallows and then pushed a few into the dropped dough on the cookie sheet. I also added chopped pecans and I used parchment paper for less mess. I will definitely make these again

Such an easy recipe with tasty results!  I added a touch more vanilla and baking powder than it called for and the results were perfectly fluffy and moist cookies.  I'll be making these again.

These are awesome cookies but I have found if you use dried out marshmallows they don't spread out or stick to the pan and also use parchment paper they come right off.

A tasty, chocolatey goey cookie, would definitely recommend this recipe. Straight forward to make. Top tip is use baking parchment for no stick and less cleanup. I also added extra cocoa and baked them for 10min at 350 as recommended by other reviewers. I used a kitchenaid mixer and it smooshed the marshmallows up. This was not a bad thing, ended up with smatterings of marshmallow all teh way through each cookie rather than larger lumps of each individual mini mallow.

Instead of mixing the marshmallows in, I chose to press them into the top of the cookies.  I was hoping that this would prevent them from melting so much and sticking.  I also froze the marshmallows overnight.  neither of these tricks worked.  The cookies were messy and sticky.  Luckily I used parchment paper.  After making one sheet, we tasted them and decided that it wasn't worth continuing with the recipe.  The chocolate flavor was weak, and nobody really liked them.  Sorry.

these cookies were great! they were gone in a day.  i did bake them a minute or two less and added extra marshmallows. Freezing them did help a lot. i didn't over grease the cookie sheets either; i went back over and wiped up the extra shorting and didn't have a issue getting them off or them being a mess.

I really like these cookies...very yummy!  I read other reviews and froze marshmellows for about an hour before adding to the dough and also put the dough in the fridge in between batches which helped with keeping the cookies together.  I also added some white chips that I had which added great flavor.  Tinfoil or wax paper is def needed!!

These cookies are a mess. I tried freezing the marshmallows as suggested but they still melted away. I also rolled into balls before baking and they melted together into eachother. They were the worst looking cookies ever! They tasted just ok. Not sweet or chewy enough for what I was going for. I took the remaining dough and put into a cupcake tin, those didn't come out well either.

just follow michelle's instructions. they turn out great, despite all the other reviews. ^____^ added a tbsp of coffee granules to 1tsp of vanilla extract instead of just 1/2 a tsp of vanilla. made the flavour pretty unique.

i followed the recipe exactly and the cookies were hard, and i couldnt scrape them off of the cookie sheet without ruining the cookies. the marshmallows made the cookies very mutated looking.

I followed others recommendations to up1 tea vanilla, 1/2-1 tea baking powder, 2 Tbl cocoa more. 
Froze marshmallows and placed on top.
(More would be better)
Baked on parchment or foil sprayed with cooking spray. Bake 350 for 9 min. Removed immediately for cookie sheet.
These are very chocolatey.

These are great cookies if you love chocolate on top of chocolate. My wife loved them so much, I made another batch a couple days later.

So good! Not a marshmallow family so I didn't use any but I added peanut butter. Used the lower temperature tip (350) but needed the full 10 minutes

I followed the recipe exactly as shown and spooned them onto a sprayed cookie sheet. 10 minutes was the perfect time. They tasted perfect and my daughter and her friend (aka my guinea pigs) loved them with a glass of milk. This is definitely getting saved so I can make them again!

tasted ok, very sweet, reduced the chips and mallows by a quarter as seemed too much, definitely cook for 10 minutes and use wax/greaseproof paper. 
make sure the mixture is binded together as it is very sticky and it will spread, makes 24 using a teaspoon

I would have given it more stars but this is one messy cookie...I made it this weekend for superbowl party..they are yummy, but since I was using my sisters oven I wasn't sure of temperature correctness..9 mins was not enough...left mine in for 14 mins. but think it might have been oven., the trick it to linger by the oven right @ 9 mins, the choc. cookie should look dry but the marshmellows should still be recognizable...I used minis & frozen them.  The parchment paper is good if you are not chilling your batter...I chilled batter rolled in balls flattening slightly...they were yummy & worth the extra effort!!!

It was alright.  I tried it by making them into balls and doing the marshmallows on top.  That wasn't the issue.  They just weren't very chocolatey.

My goodness -- these cookies are amazing! They remind me of Ben & Jerry's Phish Food ice cream in cookie form! I baked them as suggested (8 minutes at 375) and they tasted great, but were a bit on the crunchy side. When I make them again, I'll bake them at 350 to make this DELICIOUS recipe just a bit chewier. But seriously, I bake on a regular basis and these cookies are some of the best!

These cookies were delicious! I rolled them into balls, making sure no marshmallows were showing and this eliminated any mess. I also used parchment paper to bake on and let them cool completely before removing from the paper.
