This was a pretty good variation of peanut butter cookies, though I prefer the later to these.  I would recommend rolling the balls of cookie dough in granulated sugar prior to baking (like pb cookies).  It gave them more of a sweet taste.  Other than that they are good.

Made these last night and the family loved them.  I didn't follow the recipe to a T, used tofu instead of egg and replaced granulated sugar with honey.  I will be making these again, and again!  Great recipe.

A nice alternative to peanut butter cookies. My daughter has a peanut allergy and this was a tasty swap for the whole family to enjoy.

I made a test run of these today for Christmas. They taste like peanut butter cookies, only with a slightly different nut flavor (obviously). I could NOT get the nuts to work on top, but then again I rolled mine into balls and then rolled the balls in colored sugars, so that might have affected it. When I tried to place the nuts, though, the cookies cracked around the edges in a way that did not please me, so I just did without the nut topper. If you're worried they'll be too dry, use all AP flour. If you're worried they'll be too greasy, then I'm not sure what to tell you, because if anything they are under-greasy. They're certainly not dry or un-tasty; don't overbake them. For the record, I like these a LOT better than peanut butter cookies. Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor was for the most part good, but they just fell apart way too much! The dough seemed to be very dry, so I added a bit of milk. They rolled into balls okay, but if I tried to push an almond into them, they just crumbled. And after baking, they crumbled even more! I ended up dipping the uncooked balls into sugar, which was a nice touch (I gave up on the almonds). I also used all whole wheat flour, and margarine because I didn't have butter. That might have been why they where so crumbly...

DH really liked them.  I prefer a traditional PB cookie.  I omitted whole almonds and added 1 cup chocolate chips.

WOW. These turned out wonderful. We used margarine, because its what we had on hand. Added just a really light dusting of cinnamon to the last of the flour mixture as we were mixing it in and a pinch more salt. We didn't add the almonds to them, but half of them we topped with sliced maraschino cherries. Huge hit, will be making again I'm sure

I used fresh ground almond butter instead of creamy and just whole wheat flour instead of whole wheat pastry flour. They were pretty oily, so I didn't grease the pans. Delicious. Not as sweet as most cookies, but tasty.

These are excellent - I also tried a version where I added carob powder and pressed pieces of dates into the cookies instead of almonds - turned out delicious!! My kids ate them up FAST.  Thanks for a great recipe :)

this is a good recipe, little side note i added chopped almonds to the dough and it gave the cookie great texture. the only problem was that there was to much salt. next time im just going to use 1/4 tsp. 3/4 tsp was to much

Good recipe.  I made the following changes:
1) I substituted 1 tsp almond extract for the vanilla extract;
2) Prior to baking, I dipped each cookie in beaten egg white, then sprinkled with sliced almonds.
3) Decreasing the flour to 1 cup may make the cookies less crumbly--I plan to try that next time.

I make it with all regular white flour and add almond extract instead of vanilla. Also, chill the dough for about an hour to make for easier handling and better texture. 
Blanching the almonds to remove the skin also makes a nice touch.

These cookies smell and look so good. I'm baking them right now. They mixed well, but were constantly crumbly. I changed the recipe to 3 eggs, rather than just two. Would consider using less almond butter and more butter, possibly alter the kinds of flour for less texture. Thumb printed the cookies and nested chocolate chips in them, would be good to dip in chocolate/drizzle effect with alterations... Just tasted them, AMAZING!

We love these in our house and it's one I make all the time. Not too sweet, they're simple but delicious. I roll them with my hands into a workable ball and then smash them down... that way they're not too crumbly to deal with. Then I top them with the almond afterwards.  My two year old loves them too!

Turned out pretty well, though super oily when putting on the cookie sheet (the nature of almond butter).  Rolled cookies in sugar to add a little more sweetness.  Skipped the almonds on top.

This recipe is great. I took a previous suggestion and rolled the cookies in sugar. I also melted the butter and added one tablespoon of milk.I ditched the almonds and I added banans instead as a topping. They tasted great.

Not bad. I used 100% all purpose flour because I didn’t have whole wheat. The dough was definitely crumbly and I think next time I’ll stick with just 1 cup. I ended up beating another egg and adding half to the dough which made it stick better. I also added a half tablespoon or so of coconut oil but I probably could have stuck with the egg. As you roll the balls the oil from the almond butter works it’s way to the surface. They looked very much like the ones in the picture. Yes they are a touch bland but there is a little something there that keeps you going back. I ate three before I realized it LOL. Overall decent recipe but I wouldn’t go buy almond butter to make them.

I made it as per the recipe and as others side, it was very crumbly and could not put the almonds in without the cookie falling apart.  They did solidify once cooked which was good, but I was not impressed by the taste or lack thereof.  It was ok, but I did not save the recipe and probably will not make again.
