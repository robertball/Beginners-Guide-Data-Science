Tip I learned from a chef: Cook your pasta in salted boiling water for 3/4 of the recommended cooking time. Drain, then add to your sauce to finish cooking. It will soak up the flavor without soaking up all the sauce.

My husband made this last night and it was excellent!  He doubled the garlic and added some chopped red and green peppers.  The smell as it was cooking was mouth-watering and the taste was even better.  We will definitely make this again, and best of all, it is a great "starter" recipe that can be used in so many different ways:)

This was fantastic! Used a Merlot wine, can crushed tomatoes, and penne pasta b/c that's what I had on hand. Doubled the garlic and added a little fresh basil. Will add mushrooms next time. excellent!

Oh so yummy!! The blend of flavors was excellent, especially with the topping of spinach and melted mozzarella. We made it with sweet italian sausage instead and it was great!  This is going on our favorites list! Next time we'll add zucchini and mushrooms to bump up the nutrition even more!

DELISH BUT NOT HEALTHY AS WRITTEN. I'm surprised at how many recipes give a false sense of health. Frying/ browning food in oil creates carcinogens, so I always cook in a small amount of water or broth and add organic EEVO at the end of cooking for the health benefits. I stirred in the chopped spinach at the last minute and used organic since spinach is high in pesticides and loses nutrients when cooked. Fresh chopped tomatoes added near the end so not mushy (and some dried basil and oregano) instead of canned since acidic foods leach more chemicals from the can lining. Half quinoa and half pasta, plus 1/2 can cannellini beans and it was really good. Organic cheese instead of factory farmed. And we SAVE money by eating healthy:)  (and not buying unnecessary chemicals like air and fabric fresheners, etc.)  Thanks for the yummy base recipe!

Yum!  My picky husband loved this.  I used whole wheat pasta and increased cooking time and added about a cup of chicken broth to prevent drying and scorching.

This is my all time FAVORITE pasta dish ever.  It's so easy to make, I make it slightly drunk early -- now that's easy!!  Furthermore, it's an easy base dish to add on to, and it's WONDERFUL without other additions. Love it!

I was disappointed in this recipe. It was so bland, even after I added more garlic and cheese! If I make this again, I'll use Italian sweet sausage instead. At least then it will have some flavor.

This was fantastic!  I substituted tomato strips with basil instead of diced tomatoes and added diced onion, a tablespoon of Italian Herbs and a couple of Tbsp of Brown Sugar.  I didn't have any Mozzarella cheese so I used a cup of grated parmesian cheese, absolutely delicious.  Next Time I think I'll try it with sausage instead of Chicken.

I dont normally rate recipes because i often find myself changing a few things in them but this was a real quick and easy dish to make and my boyfriend LOVED it!!!! it could use a bit of a sauce so i just heated up about 5 oz of alfredo sauce in a small sauce pan w/ mozza cheese and drizzled just a bit of it on the bottom of the plates before i served the pasta. It was delish, and i'll be making it again soon.

This is a delicious, easy and healthy recipe.  My husband can't do dairy so I left out the cheese and it was still great. I also added some chopped zucchini and fresh mushrooms, and I didn't have Italian-style diced tomatoes so I just used regular diced tomatoes and added oregano, basil and parsley.  

One issue I had was that when the pasta was cooking there didn't seem to be enough liquid to get it all the way cooked and I had to add some water.  So in the future when I make this again (and I will!) I will either cut back the amount of pasta I add or just be ready to add some water and/or extra wine as the pasta is cooking.

Thanks for a great recipe!

Oh my gosh! This was amazing. I considered several recommendations and it was so delicious. Here's what I did...saut√©ed 4 garlic cloves and 1 med/lg diced white onion, added Italian sweet sausage and lots of spices (season salt, salt, pepper, parsley, basil, red pepper flakes, mixed Italian herbs), browned sausage, added 2 handfuls of diced green and red bell peppers, lg can of stewed tomatoes, two handfuls of diced zucchini, 2 small cans of mushroom pieces. Cooked pasta for about 6 1/2 mins and then added to skillet to absorb sauce for remainder of cooking time. I am so excited about this recipe. Awesome, awesome!!

This was fantastic tasting, and good for you the way I made it.  I used regular red wine that we had, and Barilla multi-grain elbow noodles.  I left out the mozzarella, choosing instead to top with grated parmesan upon serving.  Good stuff that I will make again and again.

My version had a sort of Italian/Mexican fusion since I was working with things I had on hand, but it turned out quite tasty. Instead of the tomatoes it called for, I used a 10 oz. can of diced tomatoes with green chilis. I thickened the sauce with some corn starch and added a sprinkle of Italian seasoning and cayenne pepper. I ended up using probably more like 10-12 oz. of the seashell pasta and used sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella. Sounded weird, but I tasted it along the way and was pleased with the result. Perhaps I'll try it as written if I happen to have the correct ingredients as I'm sure it's good either way.

Five solid stars just for the technique, I LOVED that the pasta cooked in the dish. I subbed Barilla Plus pasta, which is whole grain and protein fortified, and did not have a problem with undercooked pasta or need to add extra liquid so I can't forsee a problem using processed pasta. I made exactly as directed and thought it was great for a healthy hearty weeknight meal. I think this would be well-suited to make vegetarian with no chicken/extra veggies, or even to sub in cooked leftover meat for the fresh chicken and just let it heat up as the tomatoes boil. I look forward to making this again, thanks so much for sharing.

Added chicken broth as needed for pasta.  Didn't put all the spinach in to cook, used the fresh spinach as a bed for the pasta & was great.  It was gone before you knew it & they were asking for more.

This was very delicious. My whole family loved it. What I did different is I added 1/2 a jalapeno, 1/2 a red bell pepper, 1/2 a green bell pepper, 1/2 a bunch of green onions, and used bowtie pasta. I also added seasoning salt, black pepper, garlic, Italian seasoning, and parsley. Very flavorful.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe--and I love that it only uses one pan!!! I added some water (about 1 cup) since it seemed a little dry and I cooked it with the lid on. I added salt, pepper, oregano, more garlic and a lot of fresh basil. I WILL make this again-- with sausage, onion, green peppers and mushrooms. Thanks for sharing!!

Yum, great flavors!  The chicken was overcooked though. I knew the cooking time was too long but I wanted to brown it first, so I removed it until I added the other ingredients, but it was still way too long.  There really wasn't a reason to brown it first anyway because it takes on the color of the wine.  Next time I'll add the chicken when the pasta is almost done (I cut it into strips instead of cubes).  I used Merlot wine and a combination of cheddar and Parmesan cheese.  Really tasty and easy, thanks for sharing!

I made another recipe similar to this with shrimp that was much better.  It was ok but I think I would rather have the shrimp recipe vs this one.

This recipe is awesome! So easy and delicious. I had some extra time so I roasted a few cloves of garlic first and smashed them before stirring in with the chicken. I also added some zucchini. Finally, I wanted a tad more liquid so I added more wine and chicken broth. It was so good my husband asked me to make it again tonight. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I tried this recipe last night and it was excellent. I read many of the reviews before getting started so I made some adjustments. I cut the recipe in half, doubled the garlic, added basil, thyme, crushed red pepper flakes, onions, mushrooms, roasted red peppoer and one can of Cannellini beans. I also used whole wheat fettuccine as that is what I had on hand. The dish was quick and easy to prepare and tasted excellent. This will definitely be a repeat recipe here.

Yummy! I realize that this is not the best review because I was out of two of the ingredients--spinach and mozzerella cheese. However, the dish was great without it and we were fighting over the leftovers. I can't wait to try it with spinach and cheese!

This has become a family favorite. You know a dish is good when your son asks you to make "that spinach stuff."  I make it with whatever pasta I have on hand, although bowtie is our favorite. Last week I went to make it for dinner and discovered I had no chicken! so I made it with a pound of browned ground beef. Yummy!!

This was fair.  It lacked a little flavor...I'm not quite sure where, exactly.  Something about it was a little bland.  It's definitely worth tinkering with, though.  Healthy and simple.  Thanks!!!

Easy and yummy! I had to add about one more cup of liquid (wine and water) to cover the pasta enough to cook.

We loved this! I didn't change anything except we used wheat noodles and cooked them separately and served everything over the noodles. I did use a bag of frozen spinach because for some strange reason my husband doesn't care for fresh spinach so that's our compromise (he prefers canned most of all but that wouldn't have worked in my opinion) and we used the whole bag of spinach but we loved it! I think I'll add more italian seasoning next time for stronger flavor but we will definitely make this again :)

i followed the recipe exactly, except for using elbow mac instead of shell shaped, and we didn't really like it.  i think it would have been better if the macaroni was cooked seperate from the sauce and then added.  won't make again.

This is a really great recipe.  The only differences I made were to double the garlic, added 1-2 tsp of red pepper flakes for a little spice and at the end, we added a little bit of parm cheese. We didn't have red cooking wine so subbed white and it turned out fabulous.  I have made this several times and used both red and white wines and prefer the white, though it is great with either one!  If you can, adding a little bit of fresh parsley is great!

My husband, my mother, and I all thought this was really good. My tomatoes were unseasoned. So I added 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning as suggested by another reviewer. I thought this was a bit too much. Next time, I will add 1 teaspoon as suggested in the cook's notes. I doubled the garlic, and added 1/4 large onion, chopped, and 2 cans of mushrooms. I used whole wheat penne noodles that I cooked separately. I had fresh baby spinach on hand. So I weighed out 5 ounces and added it without chopping it. I had to break up a couple of clumps after it was cooked, but it worked out fine. So other than the added onion and mushrooms, I pretty much followed the recipe. I think it would have been just as good without the additions. For those of you who have the Ninja Cooking System, this is what I used to cook the entire meal except the noodles that were added after they were cooked and drained. By the way carcinogens form on meats only when cooked at a high temperature or when its overcooked or burned. Browning meats at a lower temperature is not harmful.

Excellent as is. I always make a recipe as written and then modify if needed. This is an excellent dish as it is written!!! I used a heavier cab for the red wine and it added a nice deep flavor to the pasta and sauce. I thought this was absolutely wonderful, easy, 1 pot and filling. I recommend trying the recipe as is before making changes. Make sure you get the diced tomatoes with italian seasoning or look for the can that has basil, oregano (the kicker for me) and parsley. Sure to be a famy favorite. Thank you for posting this.

This was absolutely delicious, and very easy to make! It was full of flavor and made a large amount. It was just as good or better the next day as leftovers! The only thing I did different was add some extra cheese to it!

This recipe is excellent, however I modified it a bit. I added some crushed red pepper, freshly ground black pepper and chopped fresh herbs (Oregano, basil, parsley). I pre cooked the pasta a bit, so that the chicken didn't cook too long and didn't get tough. I also added some parmesan with the mozzarella. Excellent!

This was so easy, even my hubby made it!  We used 1/4 cup water, 1/4 cup lemon juice for the wine.  Didn't have garlic, just powder.  I think next time I'll add the noodles before the chix is completely done becuz it was a little dry in the end.  But then we had to wait a little while to serve.  VERY GOOD, will make again!

This was a big hit with me and my hubby.  He went back for seconds and thirds.  I had to force myself to stop with the seconds.  The only thing I did differently was to add more spinach.   A definite permanent recipe in my collection.

I always cook a new recipe exactly as written the first time.  Sorry I did that with this one.  In my mind I know that cooking chicken a long time in  basically water, toughens it up. In my mind I know that un-seasoned chicken is very bland. Very few sauces can overcome that blandness. I figured, ah the wine!  that will tenderize the chicken and add a lot of flavoring!  But not enough for my palate!
It is an easy dish to amend so in my personal cookbook I put these notes for this recipe:
Season cubed chicken before sauteing lightly. (I use Penzeys Old World Seasoning, a good combination seasoning.)Remove only sauteed chicken to a covered dish,to keep hot, leaving the garlic. Pour wine and tomatoes into skillet, bring to a boil and add pasta. Cook 9-10 minutes. If sauce is thin, mix 2 tbs corn starch in 1/4 cup cool water.  Make a well in the center of the pan and, stirring all the while, pour mix into skillet. Add chicken back to skillet with any juices on the plate. Add spinach over the top and cover and cook for 5-7 minutes. Add layer of cheese over spinach and cook, covered for about 3-5 minutes. 
That is how I cooked it the SECOND time!

This is a good one skillet recipe!  As written it is 3.5 stars because of lack of seasoning unless "Italian-style" tomatoes means the pre-seasoned kind, then it's a 4 star recipe.  If using Italian tomatoes (you buy from a special deli,)  you'll need to add  some fresh basil, dried oregano and red chile flakes.  (One-third cup and 1 tsp each respectively.)   I also upped the garlic to five cloves and increased the amount of wine to 1 cup.  Reviewers have complained about dryness.  Cooking should be done with the lid on the skillet throughout the process. If adding seasoning, simmer the chicken in sauce for appx. 15 minutes before adding the pasta.  I cooked the pasta, covered, for 10 minutes then turned the heat off, added 1/2 cup of chicken broth (you could add water, instead) and let the pasta finish cooking in its own heat with the lid on for 10 minutes.  Then I folded in the spinach and sprinkled with cheese and let the recipe rest in its own heat, again, with the lid on, for five minutes until the cheese melted.

Fantastic and only one dish to wash! We took the advice of reviewer Monique and threw in some diced red and green peppers when cooking the diced chicken and garlic. Otherwise, we made it exactly as written, cooked up quickly and easily and was devoured by my entire family. I served it with some Texas Toast and we will certainly make again. The colors and flavors in the dish were both lovely.

We loved this!  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper, added a red pepper, green pepper and onion along with the garlic and cooked on med/hi almost like a stir fry.  I added the wine and tomatoes and let it simmer on low while I cooked 8 oz of Penne pasta separately.  I added fresh chopped spinach for about 5 minutes, then tossed in the pasta.  I added Italian seasoning, because my diced tomatoes were not seasoned.  I also used Primal Roots red blended wine from California.  This is definitely going into the rotation!

Super easy recipe - nothing difficult about it!  I'm a big fan of one-dish recipes, and this one had lots of flavor.  I always find that my cook times are longer than indicated in the recipe but it still didn't take too long to finish everything up, and the end result was definitely worth it.

This dish is absolutely amazing! I substituted sweet Italian sausage as another user did. It blended perfectly with the sweet and rich flavors from the sauce. It is so easy to make, and I love one dish meals! I might even double the recipe next time because everyone was left wanting more.

Giving this 5 stars as even though we tweaked it slightly, I can only imagine what we left out would have made it even better (I blame a picky hubby!) Added some Italian herbs, left out the oil & spinach (didn't cook the chicken or pasta first, just threw it all in a dish in the oven.) Delicious!

This was REALLY GOOD!  I added some onion just because I had it and I doubled the garlic.  I think next time I will cook the chicken separate and serve the pasta as a side dish--the chicken ended up being very tough after cooking for so long in the dish.  If you want to leave the chicken out, double the spinach--you'll love it.  My kids made this dish with my help and each had 2 huge helpings.  Thanks!

This was an easy recipe to make, and the pasta/chicken combination was hearty and filling. However, I found the final flavor lacking and the leftovers didn't re-heat well. I don't plan on making this recipe again.

This was a wonderful dish that even my picky 2 1/2 year old gobbled up.  I did not have red wine so I used 1/2 can tomato juice and enough chicken broth for their to be enough liquid to cook the pasta.  After the spinach cooked I sprinkled about a handful of the mozz. in the pan and stirred it up.  Then I put it in a casserole dish, topped it with more mozz. and cooked it at 325 for 15 mins. so the cheese was well melted and browning a bit on top.  Will definitely make this again.

Followed other user's suggestion of subbing sweet Italian sausage for chicken and adding zucchini.  Fabulous!

Not bad. I added a zucchini and a yellow squash, and I used more garlic. From my herb garden I added some fresh basil, thyme, savory, and oregano. Even with these herbs, the dish tasted lightly seasoned. I cooked the noodles partially before adding to this dish. Some spiciness is called for, I think. Next time I will add a hot pepper to the mix.

I was really surprised at how yummy this was! As i was making it I kept thinking this was not gonna be as good as some had said, it was just too simple and easy. But it was great. I kept telling myself how great it was. I added some chopped green pepper and onion while cooking the meat with the garlic, and used whole wheat pasta....other then that i followed the recipe as is, and it was great. I will make this again...for sure!

It's a good recipe. I added some peppers, onions, and mushrooms. Also, I used a bit of parmesan  with the mozarella.

Highly recommend! It has great flavor and is simple and fun to prepare. I added some Italian seasoning to plain canned tomatoes, and I used about 35 oz of tomatoes. I also added salt and pepper to the chicken as it cooked. Finally, I added a little Parmesian to the cheese.

We added a lot of spices to make it less bland, including adding red pepper flakes (approx 1.5 tsp), black pepper (approx 0.5 tsp), and dried basil (approx 1 tsp) to taste.  With the changes it turned out really well, but spicy, so beware if that's not your thing.

We also used the tip of cooking the pasta 3/4 the way on its own before putting it into the skillet.  This worked pretty well.

Goes really well with a caprese salad on the side!

I made this recipe exactly as it was written. It was fabulous. I do have a couple of comments. 1.The serving size says "4". I'm not sure how "they" calculated this. There was no way I could ever eat a quarter of the amount of food this recipe made. I went back for seconds and still it wasn't a quarter and was actually stuffed. Maybe use less pasta than 8 oz. 2. The dish does not look like the picture unless you toss the spinach with the rest of the dish once it has wilted down.   I might cut the recipe in half and add mushrooms next time, and maybe onions and celery.

I tried this recipe tonight and Oh my So tasty and easy. It's definitely a keeper. I used leftover rotisserie chicken and frozen spinach, so good. My spouse raved about it. Served woth a fresh salad it's a great dinner. Try it, you will love it. I'll make this when we have friends from England this fall.

I've made this two or three times, including tonight.  It's a clear family favorite.  It's easy and cleanup is quick so it's the cook's favorite too.  It's healthy too, which violates the law of conservation of nastiness.  I goose the recipe a little by adding 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning to the chicken while it's cooking.  If a little garlic is good, more's better so I put in 3 or 4 cloves.  Our local Krogers doesn't seem to have Italian style tomatoes but Hunt's diced tomatoes with garlic and onion fill the bill quite well.  I use whatever non-spaghetti type pasta I have.  Elbow doesn't pick up the sauce very well but is OK in a pinch.

Pretty good.  The flavors are on the milder side;  I served it with a sprinkle of fresh grated parmesan cheese, which gave it a little boost.  My kids even ate the spinach without picking it out, which is an added bonus.  My only real complaint was that there didn't seem to be enough liquid.  Thankfully, I parboiled the pasta, but still ended up adding some water, which could have contributed to the milder flavor.  I'll make it again;  maybe experiment with seasoning/ingredients.

I thought this was ok for an easy one-pot dinner, but husband gave it the thumbs-down--bland and boring, he said. I made it exactly as written, except I added chicken broth when it started sticking to the bottom. I think it would be better with more seasoning, including crushed red pepper, plus an onion and other veg such as bell peppers and mushrooms.

Delicious and easy to make! This will be a repeat meal. I modified to my tastes: I used plain tomatoes, then added oregano, basil, parsely, chives, black pepper and a pinch of sea salt for flavor. I also added 1/4 cup diced bell pepper and 1 cup cubed eggplant. I also used mezzo penne instead of shells. Turned out great!

Great base recipe! I took the advice of some others and added some chopped bell pepper and onion along with the chicken and garlic (doubled up on the garlic). Also took the recommendation of par-cooking the pasta then adding it just before putting the spinach on top w/the lid. Cooked for a couple of minutes then stirred it all together several times allowing the spinach to cook down. Added some fresh black pepper, a bit of ground sea salt, and some Italian seasoning. Would definitely make again! This recipe is quite adaptable. I'd probably add more herbs like basil and oregano next time, and try it with Italian sausage.

Wish I liked cooked spinach.  I hoped putting it all together like this would help.  Next time I will try different vegetables. I bet that time I give it a five!!  Love the flavor, prepared it exactly as written.  Now if I pick out the spinach, I might enjoy seconds.

My husband and kids loved it! Between the three of them they are most of it with barely any leftovers. One thing to note, I used white wine instead of red, just because I didn't have any in the house and it turned out fine. I also salted and peppered the dish as I went along.

Next time, I would double the recipe to make sure there's leftovers.

OMG - is so simple yet absolutely delicious -though I did make a few changes - I grilled the chicken breast whole on my countertop grill - less oil/fat that way- then cubed. I then tossed the chicken, garlic, and wine into the skillet and let the garlic cook for a few minutes. Then add the tomatoes, warmed up, then added the pasta along with some fresh basil, cooked until the pasta was done -added the spinach and then sprinkled the cheese on top.  thanks for sharing!

This was a very easy recipe and tastey as well.  Needs a bit more spice.  Next time I might add some peppers, mushrooms and some more italian spices to boot.  Be sure to add enough spinach, when at first it looks like you have a lot, it whilts right up, so be sure to add at least what the recipe calls for.  Good recipe, thank you - love one pan meals!!

This was good but nothing special.  My husband and I like our pasta with more sauce so it was rather dry for our liking. I added more garlic and wine and still thought it could have used a little more flavor. It was quick and easy so that was a plus. I'll try it again with some changes.

This was delicious--almost like a chicken stew.  I used rice shell pasta w great results but added about a cup of chicken broth throughout the cooking time to be certain there was enough liquid for the pasta.  I also added mushrooms & zucchini.  The whole family loved it!

Made this recipe tonight for dinner. My husband and I both loved it. I used frozen spinach (thawed & drained) instead of fresh and it worked and tasted just fine. I also cooked my pasta before adding it to chicken and tomatoes. Will make again soon.

Simple and easy.  Used broth instead of wine because my kids don't like the taste and it was really good.  Next time for my husband I will use the wine.  I can see how this would be a great base recipe for other ingredients.  Adding this to my personal cookbook!

Easy and tasty. Next time I will skip the mozzarella and use parmesan, I think that will give it a little more zip.

Very good!  Aside from adding mushrooms (and a little water), I followed the recipe and it was really good!  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Easy and tasty dish. Added some zucchini and crushed red pepper flakes for a little heat.  Used crushed tomatoes and linguine as that is what I had on hand.  Would make again during the week.

This just didn't work for me..  One of the few times my husband hardly ate a bite.  Perhaps it was because I used chopped roaster chicken leftovers?  It was very dry and unappetizing.  Sorry.

I added more garlc...(we love garlic..) and to the garlic I added diced onion, and a bit of fresh green & red pepper. Stirred in some chopped fresh basil before adding spinach,  Then after I topped it off with the cheese I put it in the oven in a oven proof skillet at 400 with my speed bake feature (but a broiler feature would work) to brown the cheese a bit... everyone loved it. And it is sooo very easy. This is worthy of having company over too!

Very good & very easy to make.   I added a little extra garlic (of course, diced zucchini & mushroom, an extra can on tomatoes & a little chicken broth. I, also, precooked the pasta (a 10 oz box) for 1/2 the recommended time in a separate pot then finished cooking in the sauce. My husband & niece loved it!   Big hit, will def make again!!

A good, basic recipe where you can actually taste the individual ingredients instead of being smothered in a heavy sauce or processed food taste.  Easy to customize with your own favorite ingredients.

Would like to give this 4 1/2 stars because the only problem I had was too much pasta which stuck to the bottom of the pan while the spinach was cooking.  Flavors were great.  Easy to make in one pan with only a cutting board and a couple of utensils to clean up (after I scour the pan with the burnt on macaroni)  Next time will use only about 6 oz. pasta.

This was a great way to use up leftover chicken. I cut up leftover chicken breasts and just warmed it up after cooking the garlic. I was out of spinach but added bell pepper with the garlic. Everyone in the family from my 9 year old to my 80+ year old mother enjoyed this meal.

My husband and I both thought this recipe was good but not great. It was fast and easy to make which was a plus but it was a little bland for our taste. I added bell peppers, extra garlic, and mushrooms which added some texture but could have used some stronger seasoning. I will make it again though because it was fast and easy.

Fantastic!  Eating this right now after having made it for the first time, and it was a huge success.  Very easy and cheap to make, and it makes more than the four servings stated.  I added mushrooms and red onions in with the chicken, and then I had to add some water when I put in the pasta, because it wasn't covered by the liquids all the way.  I highly recommend this recipe, and I will be adding it to my list of go-to meals, for sure!  Thanks a bunch!

Everybody liked it but didn't LOVE it.  Next time I will try it with sausage as others suggested and  maybe some more veggies.  It definately was fast and easy to make and clean up was a breeze.  I took a photo because it looked so good in the pan!

This is a KEEPER!  I had no red cooking wine so increased liquid with 1/2 cup water and wouldn't change a thing.   The sause is so tasty that it really stands alone and think I'll try it with broiled seafood next time.

Awesome. Cut the recipe in 1/2 using 1 giant breast, mushrooms and a little extra wine, spinach and italian seasoning.  Next time I will try it again using a little ricotta under the mozzarella and also use blackening seasoning on the chicken. Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe!

This recipe is very yummy, I will definitely make this one again.  I didn't have any pasta shells on hand, so I substituted spaghetti noodles in place of those, and it turned out fabulous!  My husband loved it!  Next I make it, I'm going to add fresh mushrooms and onions to it.

This one was just ok for us.  It is a pretty healthy meal; I just felt like it needed a lot more spice and a little salt and pepper.  I only used 2 blsl chicken breast because mine were large.  I didn't have any small shell pasta, just bow tie.  I did need to cook it longer, but I fully expected that.  Thanks for sharing.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!  I didn't have Italian diced tomatoes in the pantry, so I just added some Italian seasoning to regular diced tomatoes.  YUM!!!  We'll be making this often.

This was a wonderfully easy, tasty dinner!  My fairly picky husband gave me a "4" on it, and I haven't received anything higher than a "4.5" from him, so he was very happy with it!  The only thing I changed was to use the pasta pictured, as I didn't have seashells.  Thanks for sharing.

Phenomenal! a one dish meal that ALL my picky kids loved - It smells so good while cooking - they kept coming into the kitchen to see what was for dinner! I added extra garlic, extra italian seasoning & fresh cracked black pepper (personal preference)

Absolutely delicious. I've never cooked with canned tomatoes before, but they tasted so good with the chicken, I will definitely be making this again.

For the 1st time, my kids eat spinach, and LOVE IT!  This dish has become a weekly favorite!  And in no time, it's ready!!  The red wine gives it such a nice rich, italian flavor...it's bravened me up to start using red wine in other savory dishes!!

This was a good weeknight meal!  We're out of red wine so I just added chicken broth and a bit of red wine vinegar for the acidity.  I had some fresh basil on hand so I chopped that up and added it to the pot, plus I doubled the spinach and cheese.  One-dish cooking is great!

Loved this!  The pasta didn't cook enough before it was time to add spinach, and it felt like the pasta was frying, so I added extra wine to provide moisture.  Used more spinach and cheese than written because of a preference.  I used whole wheat penne instead of the seashell.

a wonderful and simple recipe that really does only require one pan! The only thing I would do is decrease the amount of cheese as I found it a little overcheesed, but everyone's preference is different! This is a great recipe to add to or replace ingredients, and it will still taste awesome. Thanks!

This is a healthy and perfectly easy recipe for a weeknight meal. Used rotini and added fresh basil and oregano. Loved the fact that you didn't have to cook the pasta separately. Can't wait to try it with smoked sausage.

Despite what goes in.... there is zero flavor to this dish. My fiancee and I were so excited to try this dish but were so disappointed! I even added extra cheese to make it more palpable and it didn't save it.

Loved it.  I took the chef's recommendation and added Italian seasoning.  I didn't have minced garlic so I used garlic powder.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it turned out great!  Husband loved it too.

I thought that this dish was alright. For me it needed more flavor. I found that the chicken was very bland even with the garlic. But was happy the chicken was very most. It was an okay dish.

Just made it for the first (of many) times tonight for my family.  We LOVED it. It was so good and so easy!  My grandmother (aged 98) is a diabetic with a heart condition and on a very low salt diet.  I already sent this recipe to my mother who cares for her.  This is a wonderful and easy dish. I am a working mom with so little time and I could make this every night!

So easy and versatile!  I didn't have red wine, so substituted white, and it was great. Added mushrooms and zucchini, and that was good too. It's nice to have a recipe that's quick, tasty, and super easy,

I added more chicken and a lot more cheese mainly just to cover the top and more garlic. When I added the Italian seasoning I mixed in after I added the paste so the seasoning could go in all of it.

Delicious! I had Penne pasta in the pantry instead of  the shells.  It worked wonderfully! I needed more liquid so I added chicken broth. Fresh zucchini from my dad‚Äôs garden was a great addition. My family loved this recipe!

Fantastic! Huge hit with the whole family. I did add twice the garlic, basil, and oregano instead of Italian tomatoes. I also added a sliced green pepper.

I made some changes. I put seasoned salt and pepper on chicken. Once that was cooked took it out of pan and I put cut up zucchini and onion in pan. Then added garlic for two minutes. I then added can of petite diced tomatoes, Italian seasonings and red wine. Brought to boil then added the seashell pasta. Needed more liquid so added some chicken stock.  Added some seasoned salt and pepper too.  Put the chicken back in pan for couple minutes then added the spinach. I stirred the spinach into the dish which helped it cook faster and then added the mozzarella.  It was so delicious.Put 3 stars because its too bland how was written but it‚Äôs a good recipe to build on.

Made as directed. It was OK. 4 chicken breasts is a lot of chicken for this dish by the size the breasts come in today at most grocery stores, even organic.  I would have preferred meatless or with Italian sausage instead as suggested.

I'm surprised at how good it is. I was worried when I realized that there weren't any seasonings used. With that being said, I made a few changes.  When browning the chicken, I seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt (this is an absolute MUST!!).  I used an 8 oz bag of spinach instead of 5 oz. Towards the end, I added chopped black olives.  Next time I will use asiago cheese instead of mozzarella cheese, only because it's a family preference, as well as sundried tomatoes.  Overall, very good, easy to make dish;).

I try to make recipes the way they are written the first time, but this one was a challenge as it had almost no seasonings except the garlic.  I did add dried oregano, onion powder, and basil, and my tomatoes were seasoned tomatoes.  That gave me the flavor.  I also made the mistake of cooking the pasta as the directions said, in the tomato mixture.  That didn't work.  It soaked up all the sauce and left the pasta hard.  I had to add another can of tomatoes and by the time the pasta cooked, the chicken was overdone.  Oddly enough, it still tasted pretty good.  I will make it again, but with changes, such as cooking the pasta separately and adding at the end.

Love this recipe. I followed it as is, with the exception of using chicken tenders instead of chicken breast since that's all I had. The meat was a little dry but given the rest of the things in this dish (tomatos, spinach, etc), it was an overall delicious feast.

Would have been good but when following the recipe, the noodles burned. I think you should make the pasta separate and then just mix it into everything else.

I like the recipe a lot! But its extremely bland if you follow the recipe I added twice the wine and twice the cheese. For seasoning I used. Oregano,basil, parsley, salt, pepper , garlic powder, and minced garlic for the chicken.Then I just added more salt and pepper and garlic powder after I added the wine and the tomatoes.It‚Äôs very refreshing.

Really nice proportions with the tomatoes, spinach, pasta, and chicken.  Even with all the cooking wine and the liquid from the canned tomatoes, the liquid evaporated too quickly.  I had to add in about a cup of water towards the end (which also evaporated).  Cooking on lower heat would have fixed this.  

More importantly,  when adding the spinach and mozzarella, I suggest constantly stirring.    Unless there is plenty of liquid, letting the pasta sit in the skillet will burn it (which is what happened to me).

I cooked chicken with the garlic, removed from pan then saut√©ed onion with red pepper flakes,added tomatoes, wine oregano and basil let that cook down.  Added chicken.  Cooked pasta in boiling water until al dente added to chicken.  Added spinach and mozzarella.  Very good.  Next time use only 2 chicken breast and 1 lb of pasta.

Like other people said, it was bland even with adding some more garlic and Italian seasoning. It needs a sauce to tie the flavors together. It‚Äôs a good start but will need some tweaking to the recipe.

Made this last night as the recipe indicated using Pinot Noir and mini penne (instead of shells).  Turned out Fantastic - Family loved it and want it included in our regular dinner rotation.  To cut down on the calories, you could reduce the amount or skip the cheese, but I think it adds to the dish nicely

I added, ground Italian sausage. Doubled the garlic, added scallions and basil. Topped it off with a small can of tomato sauce for a little moisture! Yum!

Only changed a couple of minor things ingredient wise.  First we didn't chop the spinach, just put it on top and let it wilt. That's as much a matter of preference and convenience as anything, but there's really no need to chop spinach that you're going to cook.  Second we had a block of pepper jack on hand that was exactly the right amount so we substituted that for the mozzarella. And finally, for any recipe calling for diced or cubed chicken breast, I always use the chicken "tenders" rather than whole breasts. It comes from the same part of the bird, and costs much less.

As to the technique, I found that in the process of getting the pasta cooked, the skillet kept boiling dry and I had to add liquid incrementally to keep the process going.  I also covered the skillet after adding the shells to prevent losing too much liquid to evaporation until the pasta began to soften.

But it was completely worth the effort!  This is a definite keeper.  We used plain diced tomatoes and seasoned them liberally with basil, oregano, less liberally with thyme and black pepper, and added just a pinch of fennel seed and marjoram.  I think next time I might try it with fresh tomatoes and add a bay leaf to the mix.

I will make this again. My husband loved it also and he doesn‚Äôt like tomato dishes.  I did the changes that the reviews suggested. I added a onion and red pepper and orange pepper also added mushrooms.   I did not have spinach on hand so I added kale.  I also added a chicken buillon cube when cooking the chicken.   I also added some rosemary and basil to the tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe this was very flavorful. My husband said bursting with flavor.  I also cooked the pasta separate as recommended.

My favorite pasta recipe! Added onions and mushrooms at the beginning, instead of spinach. I add a little marinara if the dish starts to dry out during the boil.

This is the second time I've made this dish and I really like it, and hubby does too! I always try to make the original recipe before I mess with it, and it was a little boring the first time.  This time I added 1 teaspoon of dry Italian seasoning,  1 tsp.  minced (jarred) garlic and a chopped onion. Made all of the difference!  You can dress this up even more with mushrooms, zucchini, whatever you like. Easy to make, delicious and pretty healthy! I'm keeping this one in my favorites!

Oh my.... how tasty!  My husband and I made this together.  It was very easy to make.  Both of us are thrilled!  It was like eating in a nice Italian restaurant.  We had seconds, and we are sure looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!  We will definitely be making this again...and again, and again!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is delicious... Prep everything ahead of time and be ready because once you start, it happens pretty fast.  If you have to stop and open or chop anything, you may risk over-cooking the chicken, which be a crying shame. Layering the spinach on top (and not stirring it into the dish) is pure genius.  It was sooooo hard for me not to stir it all together, but I urge you to resist because it allows this back-up singer to step up to the microphone and shine! My only real departure from the recipe as written was brown sugar.  Yep, I added several tablespoons of brown sugar. I know, something is wrong with me. Somewhere along the line, I developed a preference for a little subliminal sweetness whenever I make a tomato-based pasta sauce. Sorry, I feel like this is a crime against what comes natural to most of you, and I apologize. I do not, however, apologize for giving this rather simple dish a full 5 stars because it deserves it. Enjoy!!!

I loved this as a base recipe.  I did make a few changes to suit our family's tastes.
1. As I had plain tomatoes (not Italian style), I added in more herbs and spices to the tomatoes (oregano and chili pepper flakes)
2. Added in a 1/2 can (small can) of tomato paste, to thicken up the sauce.
3. After browning the chicken, I removed it from the pot.  I added it back (and the tomato paste) when there was about 5 minutes left in the pasta cooking time.  I do this to avoid a dried out / overcooked texture that can happen sometimes when 'boiling' chicken.
Enjoy!!

I did not make any changes.  I followed this recipe exactly.  The chicken breast chunks were tough and dry.  I was so disappointed....  I would suggest not cooking the chicken as long as the recipe called for.  Maybe preparing the pasta separate so it does not ahve to cook so long.

Nice recipe, especially for weeknights. I also added come dried basil and oregano to kick up the flavor a bit.  This left plenty of leftovers for two people!

This was delicious!  I did not have the small shell pasta.  A larger pasta, such as rotini works fine, which I cooked prior to adding it to chicken mixture.    I did not cook the chicken and garlic as long as instructed.

My family loved this recipe! The only changes I made was to use boneless, skinless chicken tenders (because that's what I had) and season them with salt, pepper and Italian seasoning. Also, I made sure to use seasoned diced tomatoes for extra flavor and long spaghetti/or fettuccine for noodle. A true keeper.

This was very good! I did have the issue with the liquid running out before the pasta was completely cooked,so I needed to continue to add chicken stock each time it would soak up the liquid until the pasta was done. Next time I will cook it partially and then add it in. I also added more garlic than it called for (just my preference) and added grated Parmesan at the end along with the mozzarella since it seemed a little bland. My son enjoyed it as well. I will definitely make again with those modifications.

This is very similar to a recipe I make frequently, except the other uses an Alfredo sauce.  Personally, I like the creaminess of the Alfredo sauce better, but my husband does not.  So, aside from that, this was very good.  I liked that it was all cooked in one pan. I added some fresh herbs but I think that was the only change.  I'm sure I'll make this again.

Was really surprised on how good it was. Half way through I had some doubt on cooking the macaroni in the sauce pan but it turned out great. Will be making it again.

Fantastic, simple, delicious recipe! I used chicken thighs instead of breasts because that's what I had on hand. I followed the suggestion to cook the pasta just 2/3 of the way to let it soak up more flavor in the dish. Tossed in some extra oregano and basil as well as some chopped zucchini. It turned out great, and I'm sure I'll be experimenting with this one for a while to come.

Hub & I did enjoy this recipe.  It was so easy that I truly expected it to not be very good.  I,....like everyone else did make a few tweeks to my cooking.  I doubled the garlic, added additional seasoning & ACCIDENTALLY ADDED 2 CANS of seasoned diced tomatoes!!  However, the pasta soaked up most of the juices & probably added to the flavor.  Ultimately, the leftovers needed chicken broth to moisten anyway.  Very good, simple, weeknight recipe to keep!  Next time, curious as to how a splash of balsamic vinegar may taste.

Enjoyed it!  I had to add a little water and turn the heat down due to stickage. :)

Next time I am going to use more pasta.  I also added a Lipton Onion Soup Packet for more flavor.

We absolutely loved this recipe!!!  Extremely flavorful with some modifications.  I added a whole onion and doubled the garlic. I also was only able to cook 3 breasts (after I pounded and brined them). I also blended the diced tomatoes because my family doesn't like tomato chunks (also added dried Italian seasoning because my tomatoes weren't seasoned). I made it healthier by using coconut oil instead of olive oil) and used organc corn and quinoa blend pasta shells which is gluten free (and that is all I had on hand).  Kids were hesitant to try because of the reddish appearance of the chicken breasts from the wine (I used the cheap Charles Shaw cabernet  so I was able to finally try a glass as well...not bad surprisingly)! As I write, my picky husband just went in for seconds!!!!

It was good, but without any spices, it makes it bland. The tomato taste was quite strong as well. A good base, but could use some work.

I ended up doubling the pasta because we like pasta! But I also doubled the wine and ended up adding 3 cups of chicken broth. I cannot imagine the pasta getting cooked in the original recipe?  I also added a tablespoon of Italian seasoning. It was mild, but still very tasty! Will make again!!

I used medium sea shells so should have cooked it a little longer. It's what I had on hand. I will try to get the small next time, or pre-cook the shells partially if I can't.

Very good, and easy to fix!

Very good. I cut the recipe in half and used zinfandel (red) since I never use cooking wine. I added some chicken broth to the tomatoes, and I did add some additional  basil and oregano. It was so easy!

This was good. I didn't have a skillet big enough, so I cooked the pasta separately and crammed it in afterward. I should have drained the chicken and tomatoes since I wasn't cooking the pasta in the juices. I used 3 chicken breasts and grated parmesan on top instead of mozzarella.

I loved this recipe soo much that I looked for over an hour for the right one lol. I did add chicken broth to the olive oil while cooking the chicken for flavor and to keep the chicken nice and juicy! The kids even loved it, they didn't even notice that the green leaf was spinach. Awesome recipe.

I made this dish exactly as directed. I had no issues with liquid or anything. My only comment is to add a little more seasoning - salt for sure. Otherwise it was a family hit!

I ran across this recipe when I needed a speedy meal, and I had all ingredients in house.  I used a generous portion of Italian herbs, because of having plain diced tomatoes, added extra garlic, and some Frank's Hot Sauce (my husband's favorite) to give it a little zip, and Brat Hans seasoned roasted organic chicken breast strips from Whole Foods, which added a lot of flavor. I used my "Scan Pan", so clean-up took seconds, and the best part was that my husband said (and he himself is a good cook) that the next time he says he's hungry for spaghetti, this is what he wants!  It's also a great meal to take to a neighbor/friend when the need to help arises.  It can be easily "dolled up" for those who think it's not hearty enough for them. Think sliced olives, mushrooms, etc.   It's a win win all the way!!

Made this as written with these changes, I did par boil my shells for a few minutes first and used chicken stock instead of wine as I didn't have any, and only used cheese as a garnish. It was yummy and so fast! I will make this again and again!

Great recipe. I have made it several times.  Add seasoning to your liking but don't rate a recipe low because you don't know how to "taste as you go" when making a dish.  I have found that I have needed more liquid to boil the pasta than what the recipe states.  I usually add a bit more wine at the start and chcken broth or stock (whichever I have handy) as it simmers along.

I wasn't a big fan of this dish.  But I think this might not be the fault of the recipe, but rather, because I may just not be a fan of chicken pasta dishes.  I've tried one or two others and am just reaching this conclusion.   I might try this again with Italian sausage however.

Italian Chicken Skillet Haiku: "Eh this was okay. Calling out for flavor punch. But, easy to make!" Even adding crushed red pepper, salt and Parmesan cheese when we served this, we still found it veering into bland country. It definitely needs either the seasoned tomatoes, or the addition of Italian seasoning (if not even more than that.) Love all the spinach (I think I used even more than called for; didn't measure), and love that it wasn't time consuming to prepare.

I followed the general format but substituted a lot of things. This recipe is so flexible, fun and yummy. I used beef, broccoli, and many other veggies instead. Also some mild mexican diced tomatoes with peppers because I couldn't find Italian. The smell and taste was amazing with the red wine! Next time I think I'll boil pasta on the side a bit first before hand and add to the skillet later. I R8 8/8 M8.

I made the recipe as written, but found it bland. I think I would add some spices like oregano or Italian seasoning, use Parmesan instead of mozzarella, and add some other veggies if I make it again.

We used cooked chicken and it was ready really quick. My husband even made this. We used elbow macaroni instead of shells and it made no difference that we could tell. The second time I used half the amount of shells it calls for and it still made 5 servings.

Very good basic recipe.  However, it is screaming for more seasoning!!  It needs plenty of salt & pepper then a good amount of parmesan cheese.

I used regular tomatoes instead of Italian ones because it was what I had and what was on sale.  I added Italian seasoning and doubled the garlic.  Doubled the cheese too because it was just easier to use the whole bag. I added some salt and cracked pepper too.  I can taste the chicken nicely, but everything else was bland.  Next time I'll add some zucchini or something.  Just missing something.

This meal is healthy, quick and easy to make.  My husband and two teenaged children love it.   Cooks in one pan so clean up is minimal. I added extra garlic and mozzarella cheese for flavor and I did not have italian
style diced tomatoes so I added Italian seasoning.   I would make it again.

This is one of my favorite busy night healthy meals. Super easy and relatively quick to make. And the kids love it! The only thing I did differently is I only put in half a bag of spinach but served it with a salad.

Excellent!   I added a pound of browned italian sausage and a container of cremini mushrooms.  The store didn't have any small shells, so I used mini-faralle (bow ties).   I also didn't have red wine, but I had some Moscato, which worked well

My husband and I love this recipe, however we use no salt added tomatoes and add a little bit of Italian seasoning, to cut down on the salt, skim cheese (use less of this also), rice penne pasta to make it gluten free and add a little more spinach to make it a little more healthy. We also add a little more water to cook the pasta because rice pasta needs a little more cook time.

I've made several recipes from this site so far. This one is the most polarizing in my home. Personally, I LOVED it, but my husband did not like it at all. He did not think it had enough flavor and the pasta was overcooked by the time all of it was completed. I tried it a second time, this time adding more garlic and basil while using a thicker pasta, but it still didn't have a strong enough flavor and now the pasta didn't get cooked enough! lol So, I gave up. Still I encourage others to try it. I really loved it. The one thing I did slightly different that I really enjoyed was just a bit more red wine.

So simple, adaptable, an attractive dish and tasty enough for company.  Even half a recipe made leftovers which were good too. I did cook orecchiette pasta (little ears) for 6 mins. (3/4 of the cooking time suggested by one reviewer) prior to adding it to the skillet.  Also cut down on the initial cooking of the chicken, figuring it would continue to cook without getting tough.  I'm fairly certain it wouldn't have browned anyway.  Thank you RHARRISS for this great speedy one dish meal.

Excellent.  Only cooking for 4 and on a diet, so modified by removing beans, only 1 can tomatoes, used 2 leftover corn on the cob instead of canned corn, only 2 chicken breasts.  Served with guacamole to cool it off, and some tortillas.

Quick, easy, and delicious. We like a bit more sauce, so I added a cup or so of chicken broth with the tomatoes.

I tried to follow the exact recipe, but I didn't have the Italian-style canned diced tomatoes, so I replaced it with the regular canned whole tomatoes and I added a bit of fresh basil, oregano, and parsley from my herb garden, and I replaced red wine with beef broth too. I added half teaspoon of salt and black pepper to add more taste. The result was really satisfying.

I tried this recipe and it was very good. However, I did cook the pasta separately. The second time I made it, I used chicken sausage and broccoli rabe. I kicked it up by adding hot cherry peppers. Awesome!

This was delicious! Left out the shredded cheese because of a child with a dairy allergy.  So we added the cheese after plating our food.  Will make this again for sure.

My family didn't like this - I also didn't feel it had good flavor. It seemed like it was supposed to be somewhat healthy, and it was definitely edible, but not something I would have a craving for.

It's  incredibly bland. I will try it again but with more Italian spices. It would have been helpful to have a weight  for the chicken breasts as they vary so much in size & measurements  instead of weight  for the spinach & pasta.

Loved this recipe. Don't have any cooking wine, so just used chicken stock, used Parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella, still turned out amazing.

This was really good!  I added some cubed zucchini and some red pepper flakes for a little kick.  Also found that there wasn't enough juice to cook the pasta and added some chicken broth a little at a time while the pasta cooked.  I will definitely make this one again!!!

Made this last night.  It was great! My picky grandson even loved it.  I didn't
have any wine so I used water.  Also fried it in homemade olive oil spray.  It was fast and easy to make.  Just wish I would have had something to make garlic bread to go with it.  Served it with a fresh salad,  It is a definite keeper

Good recipe, but as another reviewer mentioned, can be a little bland without some extras.  I added some Italian seasoning and think that next time I will add a bit more garlic and maybe some mushrooms.  Should be excellent then!

This was absolutely delicious.  One of the best new recipes that I have tried.  It is very flavorful and the chicken is tender and absorbs all the other flavors.  My husband suggested adding beans so next time I will add a can of Canelloni white beans and see how that goes.

Lol, don't use canned spinach. This would have probably tasted better if I would have omitted the spinach altogether. Doesn't help that I have a VERY picky family.

I made it tonight for dinner. Substituted parmesan for the mozzarella and collard greens for spinach. Dh already wants to have it again. I used a sweet red wine for the wine and served it with Tempranillo. What a great dish. Just the right balance of flavors.

At first I was incredibly skeptical. As I made the dish I remained skeptical until the very end, WOW!  Amazing and great flavor!  My 11 and 8 year old loved it too.  I cut back a bit on the spinach because I didn't think the kids would like it.  To my surprise the requested that I make this dish more often and they even asked that I would double the amount of spinach.  I did add a bit more pasta.  Instead if

Really great for a quick weekday meal. I used a small can of diced tomatoes with chiles and a jar of roasted red peppers (because that is what I had on hand) and the flavor was very good! I think the wine is the ticket.

Wow!  Delicious and so easy!  The wine adds that little something extra. I used more garlic and diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano. Just enough spice. A little extra mozz made it stringy delicious.

It was great! I added some sun dried tomatoes, onion and Italian seasoning and my family loved  it. I also used mini Penni pasta and it turned out perfect.

This was excellent! Very easy and barely any chopping involved :) And it smells really good while cooking! I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the garlic. This is one of our favorite dishes now :)

Made this two nights ago.  My family loved it!  I added red bell pepper and mushrooms, omitted the spinach.  I used white wine instead of the red, as I didn't have any.  Wonderful flavor - my family devoured it.  Will definitely be making this again!

I made this last night and LOVED it.  I used chicken Italian sausage instead of chicken, added mushrooms, 2 stems (leaves only) of fresh thyme, and basil.  I was looking for something that would make good lunch leftovers, and this did not disappoint!

I made this for dinner tonight and enjoyed it.  As written, I don't imagine it would have much flavor, as even with my additions, it was pretty mild on the palate.  I doubled the garlic, added some red pepper flakes, some Italian seasoning, an onion chopped and sauteed, and a green pepper.  Towards the end I added a chopped up zucchini.  I would make it again, even though my husband was a little lukewarm about it.

very bland and boring. I even tried to marinade the chicken with some salt and herbs for half hour and it still tasted bland. Should have followed some reviews and use sausages. The short cooking time of the dice tomatoes doesn't allow for the flavors to blend. I will definitely not make this again.

I made this last week and my husband and I both loved it!  It's so easy to make and with everything cooking in one pan it makes for easy clean-up afterwards.
Because it was a last minute idea I didn't have everything it called for, so had to modify it slightly. Used radiatore pasta which worked very well.  Also had rotisserie chicken on hand so added that towards the end.  I didn't have fresh spinach but had some that I had frozen so also used that.  It really was very very good. So pleased that I tried it.  I have emailed the recipe to my daughter as I thought her family would like it.  I would definitely do this again and would recommend it.

Delicious! I made it using penne pasta and about 3/4 cup of organic frozen spinach. The frozen spinach seemed to provide the extra moisture needed to steam the larger shaped pasta I used instead of the small shell pasta. I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes to give it some kick. Everyone loved it, even my very picky husband. Oh and the leftovers tasted even better the next day. :)

This was very good! Added in onions, green peppers and mushrooms, and only used half the amount of chicken, cut into chunks. Easy and quick. I had to add water to this in order for the pasta to cook properly, but once it was done the dish was perfect.

This was so GOOD and so easy to make. My husband loved it and never eats the same thing more than one night, but he had it three nights in a row and so did I. I did cook my pasta first and added to the dish in the pan. So nummy! I saved it to my recipe box and we will have this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This is VERY good, my husband who doesn't like Italian food loved it.
I added some onion, green and red peppers, and added the spices: white pepper, Herbs DeProvance, and basil, also added some white cooking wine and some marsala cooking wine along with the red cooking wine. (I didn't have enough red wine). I also added some fresh parmesan cheese along with the mozzerella. I put some cheese in and stirred it until melted then added more of each cheese on top and let it melt. I served it with garlic bread and cesar salad.

This was good and flavorful, though there wasn't enough liquid.  I added about a cup and a half of chicken broth continually as needed when it was cooking.  I didn't have red wine, so I used white which was very good.

This was ok. Nothing special. We all added a bunch of Parmesan cheese to make it taste better. I'm not sure if we would make this again. I ended up cooking the noodles separately from the rest of the food since my pan wasn't large enough to hold everything, but I followed the recipe for the most part.

Made this as it is written with the addition of fresh mushrooms.  Very good.  Will add red peppers and also 1 TBLS. of Italian Seasonings to jazz it up a bit, along with sliced onions.  It is a keeper.

I enjoyed the dish, but  I made a few minor adjustments to ensure good flavor.  I seasoned the chicken prior to cooking it; I also seasoned the spinach as it wilted on top of the dish; and I doubled the cheese.  Very yummy!  The next time I make this I might pre-boil the pasta for a few minutes prior to adding it .  My pasta didn't cook evenly so some of the pieces were a bit too crunchy for me.

Such an easy and delicious dish.  I used ground beef and scoobi doo pasta since I has them on hand.  I had to use more chicken stock to cook the larger pasta and to yield more sauce.   My 4 year old loved it and even ate te spinach!

This recipe appealed to me because of it's minimal ingredients and seemingly easy directions.  I only made two changes, I used three times the garlic and red wine, not the cooking kind, and it was fantastic!  My husband and son LOVED it and so did I!  Will make it a staple in our "what should we have tonight for dinner" solution.

DELICIOUS! I read all the reviews, used some of their suggestions and it was a huge success! I used blackberry Merlot, fresh tomatoes, added onions, extra garlic, extra spinach and Italian seasoning and cooked the pasta separately.  My 5 year old grandson to my picky eater son-in-law to my daughter and husband loved it!  I will use more onion, more tomato and more seasoning (or, hopefully, fresh basil and oregano) next time and will cook the pasta with the meal.  I may even try Italian sausage or some other meat; the variations are endless and the basic recipe wonderful.  I can use the produce from my garden and add and subtract to taste; thank you for the recipe and the great ideas!

Very tasty.  I sauteed chopped onions and fresh mushrooms with the chicken.  I was afraid that the pasta (I used whole wheat penne) would not cook to desired consistency so I cooked it almost halfway in another pot of water.  After I added the tomatoes and wine and brought to a boil, I added the pasta and continued to cook it.  I added fresh basil with the spinach and topped with parmesan also.  My husband ate one helping and pushed the dish away.  I asked if he was finished and he responded, "Yes, with this helping".  The second helping was larger than the first.  This is definitely a "do again" at our house.

Made this tonight and it's a keeper! I modified it a bit by reducing the wine, adding reduced fat chicken broth, using whole wheat pasta and then added broccoli and green peppers for added veggies. Even my 11 year liked it and he's picky.

I liked the general idea, but knew it would be too bland for me given the lack of flavoring.  I used an Argentinian Malbec that had lots of body instead of cooking wine, added a bit of salt, and a tablespoon of a Tuscan spice mix.  It was delicious. I love cooking pasta in sauce in a pan and I love skillet meals.

We liked the overall concept of the recipe.  Definitely needs more 'pep'. We added the mushrooms.  Not enough spinach to consider this recipe giving us a veggie component.  So spice it up with more garlic. More basil or Italian seasoning, olives, onion. What bothered me most was after the simmering of the pasta, unless I made a mistake, the chicken was over cooked.  Will try again, but make these alterations!

Liked it.  Used leftover brats in it instead of chicken and it worked pretty well.  I'll probably try it with left over chicken too!

I read a bunch of the less flattering reviews regarding blandness.  So I used 14 oz can diced tomato and 14 oz of marinara sauce. I added a bit of dry basil (~ 1 tsp) and oregano (~3/4 tsp) and a bit more red wine (maybe 3/4 cup instead of half cup).   I though it came out pretty good (deep red wine flavor) but I added too much oregano, the spice seasoning mixture wasn't quite correct and it was a little too saucey.  

Will make again but will tinker with it.  Definitely a good recipe (the original) to start from though.

Very good! I didn't have any wine so I used half grape juice and half red wine vinegar which tasted fine. I also added a shallot and extra garlic. Hubby and 2-yr-oldd loved it as well.

My husband LOVED this. The liquid didn't seem to be enough to cook the pasta so I added about 1 cup of chicken stock that I had on hand. Very good - the spinach was a nice touch. I'll make this again. :)

This was very good.  I made it just like the recipe said, although I added about a half cup of water to the pan while the noodles were cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking to the pan.  Otherwise, it turned out very well and my husband and a friend of his loved it.  Thank you for the recipe.

Wow, this recipe was amazing! I asked if my husband liked it, and his response as he was licking cheese off his fingers, was nom, nom, nom! Definitely saving this recipe for future one-skillet night meals! It was so quick and easy! I did add a little more liquid (1/2c.) because I added more shell pasta, and wanted to make sure the pasta was al-dente. Thanks for sharing!
