I have been making this recipe for years and everyone loves it.  I prefer to mix the cream cheese, sour cream and seasonings and let it sit overnight. Otherwise you will taste more cream cheese/sour cream than seasoned cream cheese/sour cream.  I also increase the oregano to 1/2 tsp. versus 1/4 tsp. and add 1/8 tsp. of red pepper--it does not overwhelm the dip.  I have also used provolone cheese in lieu of the mozzarella cheese.  Add or delete peppers, onions, sausage, olives, tomatoes, etc.  This is a very versatile recipe.

I made this with reduced fat cream cheese, reduced fat sour cream and turkey pepperoni. Instead of baking this, I put all the ingredients into my Lil' Dipper crockpot early this morning and let it go until lunch. The kids thought this was great--I served it with hunks of homemade garlic bread, carrot "chips" and sliced fresh zucchini. This was nice for a quick "lunch" on the weekend. I'd use more spices next time.

This was designated as a new family favorite! I was skeptical about the ingrediants but they worked so well together! I didn't bother "layering" but rather, just mixed it all together, topping it with the mozzerella cheese.  Fantastic dip!! We served with french bread and butter crackers. I cannot wait to make it for the upcoming holidays. This was soooo good!

Great Dip! I used regular pepperoni because of availability and diced mushrooms instead of green peppers.  This was great to make ahead and refrigerate, just add a few minutes to the cooking time.  It was the first dish empty at the party I took it to. Will make it again and again!

This recipe was delicious and so easy!  I omitted the onion and green pepper though.  I served this with Triscuit Thin Crisps (triangle shaped Triscuits).  They went great with the dip and don't break when you dip them.  My guests gobbled it up in no time!  It really does taste like pizza!  I'll add this to my recipe box for sure!

This dip was great.  We made it for a New Year's Eve get together -- we doubled the amount of pepperoni and left out the onions and green peppers but it was fabulous.  I had to tear it away from my roommate :)

I made this dip for a party because my husband loves pepperoni.  I left off the onions and cut up french bread to put the dip on.  Everyone raved about the dip.  The dish was almost spotless within an hour.  Loved it.

Not a big fan of onion or raw peppers, so left those out, but this dish was STILL amazing.  I had it for dinner last night (heehee) and it fed two grown men PLUS made 2 small tupper wares for lunch today (going to eat it with tortillas).  We chopped pre-sliced pepperoni and that was key - the pepperoni flavor was still there and the pepperoni got tender.  Can't wait for lunch!!!!

I brought this dip to a small gathering last night and it was gone in 10 minutes. Everyone loved it!! i made a few changes....i used a whole 8oz. package of presliced pepperoni, added a half cup of parmesean cheese, 1/4 tsp of basil and parsely, and mixed it all together instead of layering.  It turned out so well that i can't wait until another event where i can make it again. thank you so much for this great dip.

I liked this dip, but it didn't go over well at our Super Bowl party. I guess people would rather just eat "real" pizza! LOL I followed the recipe other than leaving out the bell pepper. I have tons of dip leftover :o(

I have been making this dip for about 20 years after finding it in a JC Penney charity cookbook.  Everyone who likes pizza loves the dip.  The onions and peppers make the dish for me, but the great thing about it is you can get creative and use anything you would on a pizza!

Hate to be the first bad review but my family did not like this at all. I was expecting something really great because I love everything that goes into it. I'm not really sure what was wrong with it and my husband couldn't point anything out either. I think the cream cheese/sour cream mixture just didn't pair well with the other flavors and it had a strange texture. Maybe using more mozzarella and mixing it in with the cream cheese would help a little.

yummy, but very greasy. I'd highly recommend microwaving the pepperoni for a few seconds.  I served it with refrigerated breadsticks. Thanks!  :o)

I double this recipe for our family gatherings.  I use 2-8oz blocks of cream cheese and only 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I added 1 tsp Basil, increased my Oregano to 1 tsp as well.  I used more cheese then recipe calls for.

This was extremely good.  I mixed all the ingredients together instead of layering them and I also mixed in a 1/2 cup of mozzarella baked it and then added more cheese on top. I also toasted a loaf of French bread in the oven to serve with it.  Really really good !!!

We thought this was awesome! I think the cream cheese mixture needs a little more oregano and garlic, and next time I am going to add a little sausage to give it a true pizza taste. Also added a little crushed red pepper to the sauce for a kick. Will be making this again.

This dip lasted all of 5 minutes at my son's birthday party. It tasted fantastic! We used tortilla chips to dip.

This was super for an appetizer!!!  I prepared it all ahead the night before and then baked as directed.  It tasted exactly like a gooey pizza.  Everybody just ate it all up.  Enjoyed by all.  I served it with a fresh italian loaf cut in cubes which went perfectly

I used red bell pepper instead of the green and mixed the pepperoni, onion, and bell pepper into the cream cheese mixture. Took this to food day at bowling, everyone loved it.

I whipped up a double batch of this for a get-together, and served it with french bread cubes and Ritz crackers. I baked it in a stoneware casserole dish so that it would stay warmer longer. Everyone raved over the dip, and I got a request for the recipe. It's definitely one I will make again!

We wanted to like this, but it was really heavy on the cream cheese and sour cream flavors. I see some reviews that address that- so I'd recommend trying it their way. We mainly tasted the cream cheese when following the recipe. Not something we'd make again.

this was okay but nothing spectacular. Next time I'll use onion powder instead of onions, take out the green pepper, cut the pizza sauce in half, and double the pepperoni. also, as a point of interest, it took 10 minutes for the mozzarella to melt.

My family loved this recipe.  I made the cream cheese & herbs the day before  and put in the frig. The next day, I spread the mixture on the bottom of my crockpot and finished with the remaining toppings before turning it on low.  This helped the mozzerella cheese on top stay warm and gooey. This is a keeper!

Not the best looking dip but tasted pretty good, even better the next day. I added sliced black olives and used only green onions. I used the whole small can of pizza sauce it was a little more than a cup. Not sure if I would make this again.

I did not change a thing for once and this is very good. I served this with warm Italian bread and paired it with Pepperoni Burgers(no rolls), from this wonderful site. We really enjoyed this fun dinner but not real healthy. We all need a treat like this once in a while. This is guest worthy!

The first time I made this for ym boyfriend and 5 of his friends. This was gone in 20 minutes. To this day, they still ask when are we having the pizza dip favorite. This dip has made the favorite girlfriend of the bunch! Also, I would use a little more garlic powder and oregano. Also, I don't like the onions or the peppers. They don't really add anything, but just take time to cut up.

Definitely make this dish! It is a crowd pleaser!

This was very good, however I would rather have it without the pepperoni.  It was very good, I just don't do meat all that well.

Very good, I left out the peppers and onions b/c kids were there and it was still good.  I think you could play with this and add all your favorite pizza toppings and it would be great.  I cooked a french bread loaf and served it with that.  Everybody ate it all up!

I served this at a party recently and it was a huge hit.  I used the thin presliced pepperoni (diced), and it made it so easy.  I'm sorry there weren't more leftovers for me!!!

I found this recipe to be just "ok".  Not one of my favorite's or something that anyone wowed over.  I cut up fresh onion bagels and toasted them for dipping which I think worked better than tortillia chips, but even still, unless I'm going for plenty of variety, I don't really think I'll be making this one often.
