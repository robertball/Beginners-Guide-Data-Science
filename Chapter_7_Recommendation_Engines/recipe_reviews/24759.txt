I asked my husband what he wanted for Father's day dinner, and he said squash casserole. He's from Arkansas, I'm from New York..so needless to say, I had a "are you kidding me?" moment. Having nothing to compare the taste to, I was reluctant to make it. But then realized I could go to my favorite website and find one that would come close to what Granny used to make. After reading every single recipe,and all the reviews, this one sounded the best.
Wow, is all I got to say. I have never had this before. Never even bought squash till yesterday. I thought it was totally amazing. Very very tasty. My 5 yr old even liked it. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but didn't use the whole bunch of onions..(What is a bunch anyway? is it the whole bag,and what if my bunch was bigger than one used in this recipe? would I then be using too much?..yea, I was going nutty.So I knocked it down to half, and it came out awesome. Thanks for a wonderful recipe,and for saving Father's day!

This recipe is so good. It tastes just like the casserole at Black Eyed Pea! I did do one thing different though - instead of putting the crackers and cheese on top, I mixed them in with the rest of the ingredients and baked, it was sooooo good!

Good old fashioned recipe, just what I was looking for.  I used sliced Vidalia onions instead of the green onions (just a southern thing, I guess!), and everyone loved it.  I'll use this again!  Thanks.

I wanted to like this casserole, but, the flavor just didn't suite our taste.  We prefer our squash a little more firm, so, I only boiled the squash about 8 minutes and it was a perfect texture.   I also thought a stick of butter would be too greasy for us, so, I reduced the butter to 4 tbsp which was plenty.  The problem for us was the sugar.   It was too sweet for us.  Instead of enhancing the flavor it just seemed an odd combination for our taste. It seemed that most people liked the casserole as is, but, if you prefer a more savory dish like us - I would leave out the sugar.

I've made this several times for my father with his fresh squash from the garden.  He loves it.  I've also recommended the recipe to family and friends.  I was able to put the whole recipe in a 9 inch pan instead of the 13x9 pan and it came out great.

This was exactly what I was looking for--tastes like what I used to get at the Blackeyed Pea.  I will put only 2 tablespoons of sugar next time, though.  Thanks for the recipe

Family truly enjoyed this. I cut the cooking time for the squash to five (5) minutes. I knew 15 minutes would make it mushy.

this recipe is amazing as is, but basic enough to allow your own twist on the dish as well.  I did not have Ritz or "butter" crackers so I used the saltines I had on hand.  The flavors complimented each other in an amazing way.  I may add some grilled chicken to it and have it as the main dish.  AWESOME and easy.

I am sorry but we did not like this much at all.  I knew 15 minutes was too long to cook the squash unless you like mushy squash, which we do not, so steamed the squash for 7 â€“ 8 minutes.  Did not like the sugar addition nor the crushed cracker, will continue to top my squash casseroles with chicken flavored stuffing mixed with a little melted butter.

Followed the recipe as is.  It was very good.  My husband even enjoyed it and he is not big on squash.  The only thing I would do differently next time is cut the cooking time on the squash...it was just a bit mushy.  Overall great casserole though!

This was devoured at Thanksgiving. I made it for a holiday potluck since I am away from home and it's a tradition for my family's Thanksgiving dinner, so I was surprised that my friends who'd never heard of squash casserole scraped the dish clean! You can easily get by on 1 egg mixed with the milk for 7 squash, a smaller baking dish, and my family recipe doesn't use cheese, just the crackers. Nonetheless, it's still very rich and delicious.

I liked this enough to make again.Even though I am a southerner I never ate much squash casserole. We normally  bread and fry, season and saute or slice thin and add to salads. Having a grocery bag full given to us I decided to make a casserole and freeze the rest for future casseroles. Looking at the recipes I thought I would try this because it didnt have soup in it. I did half the recipe since there are only two of us. I used what cheese I had on hand which was a little cheddar and a taco blend. I had about 3/4 of a sleeve of club crackers which were not fresh enough to eat but good enough for this. I steamed the squash 8 minutes in the microwave. I added garlic and onion powder. I used a scant T of sugar. I only used 2 T of butter that I pulsed with the crackers. I mixed some of the crackers/cheese into the casserole and put the rest on top. As for the green onions, here's a tip that I did not know til a couple weeks ago, some of you may know this already but I sure didn't. Last week I found a small (sad) bunch of green onions in the fridge. I trimmed most of the green off, stuck them down in a small juice glass of water (change frequently) and they had growed enough to use for this casserole. They are back in the water and growing again. You can do this in dirt but they grow faster in water.

By far the best Squash Casserole I have ever had. Only changes I made was mixing half of the cheese called for in with the other ingredients and then mixing the other half in with the toppings. I was very pleased with the outcome.

Beyond good! I sauteed squash w/1 lrg. onion for about 10min. instead of boiling. Followed recipe as written, but left out sugar & crackers, & added extra cheese throughout. This will be added to our holiday dinner menu from now on. Thank you Shannon!

This is a great recipe, but I, too, had to tweak it to reflect my childhood.  I grew up eating squash casserole here in Texas, but it was savory all the way -- no sugar, and we used saltines instead of the round, buttery crackers (although I've had it that way and it is good).  I used the green onion tops, but also sauteed half of a Texas 1015 onion in 2 tbsp butter (omitted the rest of the butter), and mixed the crackers and cheese with all the other ingredients.  I give it a little kick with a dash or two of hot sauce (use your favorite). Also, I used a bit of fresh thyme out of my garden and seasoned it with white pepper, instead of black.  Oh, to be that kid again, and have the energy to burn off all those calories!!

Wow. I had some quarts of squash that I canned, and I used that. It was so fresh tasting. I also used instead of the crackers, a little of bisquick sprinkled on top with the cheese. Oh the cheese! This was one of the best tasting casseroles. I had 6 family members over and it just wasn't enough. Next time Im doubling it. Thanks a bunch, Ann

This was really good.  Substituted zucchini (couldn't find squash) which I only boiled for about 6 minutes then rinsed w/ cool water.  15 minutes and zucchini would have been mush.  Also sauteed 2 chopped onions in butter til soft, added salt/pepper to taste, then doubled the egg/milk/suger mixture, using 1/2 cream.  More salt/pepper for good measure and put in a 9x13 casserole.  Don't skip the Ritz crackers on top...ymm!  Even better the next day.

I never made a casserole with squash before this and it was an outstanding dish. Everyone loved it. It was very easy to make and I will definitely be making this again!

Yummy! A couple of changes: I mixed in the cheese instead of sprinkling on top, and I omitted the crackers. Delish!

This is THE squash casserole recipe!  I use Allrecipes as a 'guide source' and this recipe was right-on-the-nose for egg-milk-squash ratio.  I had two quart sized bags of yellow and zucchini and used those.  I was out of butter crackers, so used buttered corn flakes.  I think the crackers would have been better--the corn flake topping turned-out a little too buttery (yes, there is such a condition!).  Great recipe; I will defintely use it again.

This was a good way to use up squash, but a bit bland and mushy. I'll make it again when I have another abundance of squash, but will add a liberal aount of seasoning and make it in a shallow pan to balance the crispy top and mushy bottom.

Definitely a keeper in my recipe box, I too like another reviewer used vidalia onions instead of green onion, I think it is a southern thing.

I was in a hurry and this recipe sounded like one I had used before, so I followed this one.  I was disappointed; it was too 'eggy'.  I did try the few comments about putting cheese in rather than on top, but I still didn't like it.   I then determined that the previous recipe I had used was a Paula Deen recipe, which had no eggs, and was quite tasty.

Excellent! I will use a less sugar next time because I prefer not so sweet squash casseroles, however it was great! The family loved it, my son ate half the dish for dinner!

This was a really great recipe.  After making it the first time as is, I changed some things.  I added 1 c. of crushed crackers into the mix along with a minced garlic clove and 1 c. cheddar cheese.  On top, I put 1 c. of cheddar cheese along with about 1/2 c. of the cracker crumbs.  Very great recipe!!

I agree with the comparison to the casserole from The Black Eyed Pea restaurant.  That is one of my favorites but we don't live near the restaurant anymore so I was really glad to find this recipe.  It has been requested several times for potlucks and believe me, if I can make a dish that gets requests, it's a winner!  After all, I don't usually cook, I go to the Black Eyed Pea or other restaurants!

Very good Squash Casserole!
I loved it, but my children won't eat it. My husband will eat it though. I did not put crackers on it, (I just put cheese. I found it to be better)

I made this for a family gathering and even though I had to substitute wheat club crackers for the butter rounds it turned out really good.  Even my teenage daughter who hates squash asked for seconds.  Can't wait until my next visit to the farmers market to get more squash.

not what i was looking for. I don't think it should have sugar in it. I guess we were looking for a creamier cheesier taste.

Yum! This dish turned out great. Hubby kept raving about it as he ate it. Not a choice food for my kids, but then squash isn't a veggie they care for. I made a couple changes. I blended the cheese and crackers in the mixture. I also used crushed CheezIts since that is what I had on hand. It was very flavorful. I will make this again!

2nd version- only 2 T butter, 1.5 T of sugar,  did not have crackers so smashed tortilla chips and used hot pepper jack cheese

Very good. I had to tweak it based on what I had on hand. I used 2 zucchini and 2 yellow squash, cut the ingredients into about 1/2, used a small yellow onion, and cheese-its instead of ritz.  SautÃ©ed the squash and onions, mixed all the ingredients and baked it. Turned out very well.

I've made this twice in the last month - my husband loves it!  I used some of the suggestions from others (left out all sugar, cut butter back to about 1/4 cup, sauteed the squash in a PAM-sprayed skillet instead of boiling it, and cut back cracker crumbs to about 1 cup.)  I sauteed one diced onion (instead of green onions) in 6 slices of cut-up bacon.  Then I added about a pound of leftover cubed turkey to make this a main dish.  (Great way to use those Thanksgiving leftovers soon!)  I'm not a big veggie fan, but this is fantastic.

We receive a weekly organic CSA box, and needed to find a recipe to use two weeks of various squash varieties.  This one hit the spot perfectly, with a few minor changes since I did not have the exact ingredients on hand.  I added corn from two fresh cobs, diced jalapeno ,maui onion in lieu of the green onions  (all from my CSA box), shredded Kraft mexican cheese, and topped the casserole with crushed tortilla chips. Ole!

This is a basic squash casserole recipe.  The ingredients are what most people have on hand.  I chose this recipe because it is simple and did include ingredients I already had.  I followed the recipe exactly except I only boiled it about five minutes.  I used both round butter crackers and saltines.  This is a very good recipe in which you can add other ingredients or change around a bit according to your tastes.  Very good.

OMG. Wow.  This is fantastic.  If you've got good squash, you don't need the sugar, otherwise keep this recipe just as it is and you will be sooo happy.  Great beginner recipe too...  you can't get more simple!

This was the best recipe for squash that I have ever tasted. My kids and husband loved it. I did make a couple of changes to it. Here they are: Only 4 squash. I melted the butter in the microwave and premixed the ingrediants. I also used a regular onion (very small). After the squash was done boiling I drained it then returned it to the pan. The poured the mixture over it and stirred. I then dumped it into the baking dish and put 4 cups of ceddars cheese on it and ritz crackers crushed. It was an amazing dish! Thanks for the great recipe I have passed it on to my whole family to try.

Even my daughter liked this one, and that is saying something!  I put some cheese and crackers in the mix as well as on top, because who doesn't like cheese, right?  Great recipe!

Exactly what we were looking for - a simple, classic squash casserole without a lot of unnecessary "frills" that cover up the wonderful flavor of the squash. Great flavors, and we loved the sliced green onions in this! The only cheese I had on hand was provolone, so I used it in place of the cheddar and it was wonderful. This will definitely become a keeper...thanks for the recipe!

This was so good.  My family loved it.  Taste just like the casserole at Black Eyed Pea.

Ended up using frozen yellow squash as well as a bag of frozen mixed squash, which included tomato, zucchini and yellow peppers. Used more cheese than called for. My mother loved this and even loved the leftovers more.
