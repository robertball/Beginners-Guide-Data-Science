Great recipe.  However, if you plan on marinading for a long time make sure to use a very low sodium soy sauce or else the steaks will be far to salty.  Otherwise great.

I used minced garlic, added to the marinade;scored the steak on both sides & left the steak & marinade in a ziplock bag for about 20 hours, turning every few hours. I broiled this about 6" from the heat for about 10 minutes per side, and it came out medium rare in the middle.I sliced the whole thing against the grain in thin slices, and poured the BOILED marinade (after it cooled) over the leftovers. I have been enjoying this for days-reheats very well in the microwave for a minute for several slices-they don't get tough! Next time, I might use a low-sodium soy sauce! This is a keeper!!!

Very good. I used olive oil instead of veg. oil, low sodium soy sauce and minced garlic vs. garlic powder.  I scored the steak slightly and poured everything into a ziploc bag.  I let it marinate for about 6 hours.

This marinade adds a ton of flavor to flank steak it also made the meat very tender. In the past I have always typically marinaded my flank steak in teriyaki sauce, however this recipe is certain to make me change my ways . .

This was a really good combo of flavors.  Soy and lemon go good together.  Like another reviewer, I too added a tablespoon of brown sugar and a dash of onion powder and ginger.   I started marinating in the morning and grilled later that evening..(about 6-7 hours) and the flavor was fantastic.  A little on the salty side, but we still enjoyed our steaks very much.  Thanks Bobbie.

I make basically the same recipe and it is flexible. I generally add some frozen orange juice, fresh ginger, often rum or tequila, honey, and always some red pepper flakes. No measuring required. I just add a dash or this or a gurgle of that into the bag and give it a shake.  If I run into flank steak on sale and I'm going to freeze it, I just freeze it in the marinate. Once it defrost I have a instant meal. This is awesome sliced very thin with a fresh orange salsa.

Being that the weather is 60+ degrees outside today, I was very excited to grill and was even more excited to make this recipe. I am so glad the recipe exceeded my expectations! Other than adding a TBLS of brown sugar to the marinade, I didn't change a thing. We started these by 10am and grilled around 6pm. Everyone was very pleased and the steaks were both flavorful and tender. My roommate made me promise not to lose this recipe...which I won't! Thanks Bobbie!

Excellent!  I only marinated for about 3 hours and it was still really good.  I used real chopped garlic, rubbed it into the steak and about 1/4 of a cup of brown sugar.  Everyone loved it.

It came out really good. Way better then I was expecting. I marinated the steaks over night. They were filled with flavor all the way through.

Fantastic recipe, even if you cannot marinate for a long time. A couple hours will still make for a juicy meal.

All the reviews were right.  This is a delicious marinade!  It does make meats tender and after marinating overnight, my family didn't need a steak sauce.  Marilyn in Winston-Salem, NC

I've been grilling flank steak for years. Try scoring the steak diagonally with a sharp knife before marinating. This will help to break down the muscle and assist the marinate to permeate the meat more effectively. I score diagonally from right to left on one side, turn it over and score it in the opposite direction on the other side. The score only needs to be a few millimeters deep. Try it and then marinate. Try using this for fajitas too. Yummy!

Even though it uses few ingredients, this recipe has tons of flavor. I used london broil and marinated it for about 8 hours.  I also used fresh garlic rather than garlic powder.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was really tasty . I used low sodium soy sauce and 2 cloves of minced garlic in place of the garlic powder in the marinade. I marinated the steak for 8 hours and then grilled the steak to med-rare and let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing it. The meat turned out to be more tender than a NY loin steak. Next time, I'll add freshly grated ginger to the marinade.

Used this marinade for flat iron steak and it was delicious.  I added a bit of brown suger and some ginger.  This is simple and makes a very flavorful tender piece of meat.

Very good.  I also used low sodium soy sauce, chopped garlic instead of the powder and marinated for 24 hours. I barbequed on the lowest setting on gas grill. It was eaten up at one sitting.

I thought this was very good and I will use it again! I let it marinade over 24 hours which made it a little too salty for me. Next time I'll let it marinade no more than 8 hours and use low-sodium soy sauce. I added cracked black pepper to the garlic when rubbing it into the meat. I love the lemon juice! Maybe next time I'll add a little lemon zest to rub into the meat as well! Thanks!

I made this before I knew what it was...lol!  I got the recipe from a friend of mine and the look on peoples faces with that first bite is always shock of how delicious it is!

I do it a little different.  I use low sodium soy sauce otherwise it's too salty and I marinade it overnight.  Then I sprinkle garlic power all over the steak, slice a lemon in half and rub the garlic powder into the steak with the lemon half.  Both sides of course ;)

I just finished eating this steak and it was great.  I made it in a hurry and didn't get a chance to marinade the meat.  I used some thin flank steaks and made it in a skillet.  I also threw in some onions as well.  After that, I cut up the steak and made tacos.  Incredible.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Great recipe!  We let our steaks marinade for 48 hours.  The ingredients enhanced the flavor of the meat without overpowering it.

This is sooooooooo easy and mmmmmmmm    mmmmmmmmmmm good. You won't regret trying this one. The smell as its cooking. The taste as you take your first bite. Ingredients most should have already. Thank you, I will never eat a bland steak again !!!!!

Very flavorful! Like others, I also added brown sugar to marinade which helped to camelize the outside of the steak, leaving the inside very tender.  Next time will try with fresh minced garlic.

I used this recipe with Mock Tender Steaks and was suprised at how well they turned out.  If this can turn cheap meat into a great tasting meal I just have to wonder what it would do to a good cut of meat.

Thank you Bobbie for a great marinade!
We just tried it tonight on our sirloin
steaks and they were so tender we could
cut them with a butter knife!  Very good
flavors that enhance steak, but not over-
powering.  Our 5 year old gave it thumbs
up, too.  This is a keeper.

This was still delicious even though my grill caught on fire. Obviously I did not have to cook it the recommended amount of time, and it was a bit dark on the outside, but it was juice and tender after I sliced it up. Served it with baked potatoes and broccoli and cheese.

Great! I've been using this recipe for a few years now and always get rave reviews. It's great on any type of meat especially chicken. I use fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder, 1/4 cup of lemon juice, and low sodium soy sauce.

Instead of garlic powder I also used minced garlic.  For a double recipe added a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar, and sprinkled in some salt free onion and herb seasoning and ground ginger (fresh would be great).  My cheap meat had great flavor but was tough more than likely due to my being forgetful and poor grilling skills not from a untenderingzine marinade.

I made this and because I was going to refrigerate for 4 hrs or more, I left soy sauce until 1/2 hour before  grilling.  Made a world of difference, less salty flavor.

This marinade was very tasty, and so quick to make.  I was able to marinade for 3.5 hours, and the meat was not quite tender enough : going to marinade overnight next time!

I made this recipe this week. I follow the recipe 100% and add used some of the suggestions. My 12 year old  son LOVE IT!! and I thought the flavor was very interesting and different. I defenitely think you will impress your friends with this recipe.  The next day tasted amazinly better. I will  defenitely do it again. I also want to try the marinate with chicken though.

This is an excellent marinade.

I modified it just a little bit by first rubbing a small quantity of cumin unto the steak.

To the marinade I added lemon zest and honey, replaced the garlic powder with minced garlic, and the vegetable oil with olive oil for more flavor.

I reduce the marinade (with a bay leaf) and the drippings from the steak (broiled in the oven) to form a sauce.

I made this last night with a tenderloin.  Yummy!   I marinated for 6 hours and used fresh garlic.  I will use this easy marinate on pork or chicken.

I agree; a great tasting steak, but it is NOT an inexpensive cut of meat. I've seen it in the store priced at 8.00 - 10.00 a pound. Good, but not cheap!!!

Even though we used a different piece of meat other than the flank it still came out outstanding. I also added a little garlic powder and black pepper when I was grilling it it still came out very good. I just used it with pork steak and followed the recipe totally but didn't marinate as much and also added seasoning salt.

My husband likes his steak plain, but my daughter and I love this. I used NY strip steaks and it was pretty good.
