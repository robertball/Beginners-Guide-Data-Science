There's a faint taste of orange to go with the poppy seeds.  I used butter instead of shortening.  These are good cookies!

There is an error in the recipe...step 3 and 4 are almost identical (so omit Step 4). It needed 10 mins to bake.  Also, this makes 54 cookies, not 18!  (There are three cylinders of cookie dough per recipe, each ONE cylinder makes 18 cookies.) I think I might add a pinch of salt and some extract to it next time, perhaps lemon extract or vanilla.  I used Spectrum organic veg. shortening which is free of transfat. It's a very simple recipe, the kind you can make any time of the year w/o a lot of work. Tasty.

I've made these cookies for a coupla yrs now and I love them! I think my recipe came from 'Taste of Home" magazine and it doesn't have the yogurt. To make them more festive, roll the logs in colored sugar,prior to slicing. Red looks very good.
