This sauce is a change from my usual marinara sauce.  I'm not really fond of the carrots in this, and the tomato flavor nearly eclipses all the lovely onions, garlic and mushrooms.  It's a very useful sauce for adding veggies to the plate, and as you can see from my picture, I tried it over "zoodles", for a lower carb count.  I'm not sure I will replace my other TNT recipe, but this was worth a try.  Thanks for the idea!

This was really good.  Very easy to make and stood up very well on it's own with fettuccini.  Will definitely make again and will use it in lasagna, with meatballs, on sandwiches, etc.  Added some shaved parmesan on top as a little addition.  Thanks for posting the recipe
