Carlie's Chocolate Oatmeal Waffles Haiku: "First thing I must note: Yay! No egg separating! Not too sweet, just right." Ahh a waffle recipe that doesn't call for separating eggs, and beating the whites! My family loved these waffles (if you could believe it, they liked them better 2 days later toasted, and w/ just butter), but I wasn't quite as wild about them; a little dense, but that's just a matter of taste. I knew making them w/ the oat, and skipping the separating of the eggies, that the end result wouldn't be a fluffy light waffle, but hey, 2 out of 3 people in my house devored them, and they were easy to make, so Success!

Followed the recipe exactly.  They were ok.  Came out very dense and soft... Not fluffy or light like other recipes we have used on this site.  With a few modifications they may be better.

I'm new to this. In what amount could I substitute oat flour for the oats? Thanks for your suggestions. I love this recipe; I'm just curious about the difference oat flour might make.

First I blended the oats and flour together.  Then all the dry ingredients while I melted the butter in the milk in microwave. I pulsed the eggs into the dry ingredients then finally blended in the milk when butter was almost melted.

Kids and wife very happy with it!

yummy and tasty!  Head's up, though; I overcooked the first one, since this recipe has a little more sugar than my 'normal' recipe, and the cocoa powder makes it harder to judge the doneness by colour.

I loved this recipe! Simple and easy! I made mine without the cinnamon and it turned out good! I'm not a very picky eater as long as it's easy and turns out good then I love it!

This tasted very good. However, as written it did not work well in my Cuisinart upright waffle iron. The oats clumped and clogged the top opening, preventing the batter from going all the way down. I had to add extra milk, and the oats still clogged it. Next time I will use a regular recipe and add cocoa powder to it.

We tried these on a cold snowy day when looking for something new to eat.  They were great, but definitely not typical waffle density, which is fine with me.  I'm going to try the toasting them the next day!
