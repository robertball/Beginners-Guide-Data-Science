I loved the idea of "not hot canning"! I did find that mine turned out a little "bland" for our taste. I didn't have tarragon vinegar and used cider with fresh tarragon instead so maybe that could be why. I re-worked them a bit, added wine vinegar,some sea salt, sugar and a few more spices; then heated the vinegar mixture just until things disolved nicely. I increased the ratio of vinegar to water. For our taste, that was better. It's such an easy recipe that you can quickly make changes to suit your own taste!

I agree, they are a little bland (though the pickling vinegar would make a great salad dressing) - and I think it would be better to blanch the green beans first.

I forgot to try these the first day but after two days they taste pretty good. I had to make a few substitutions. I mixed tarragon and cider vinegar as I didn't want to buy a whole bottle of special vinegar just for this recipe. I also couldn't find any fresh dill so used some dried even though I'm sure it's just not the same, and a small amount of powdered mustard for the mustard seeds, which I also can't find.  I primarily taste garlic & vinegar with a kick from the peppers. I think these will be good for snacking or in bloody marys.

Made these just as recommended and loved them!  I did need more of the vinegar and water mixture than the recipe called for, though.  Super easy and I will definitely make more.
