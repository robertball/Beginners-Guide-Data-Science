I love this recipe. This is a Christmas must in my home. I've been making this since I was old enough to stir a pot.  The not setting up is because of cook time.  It  needs to be a full boil before starting to time.  It will turn a slightly darker color as it gets done. You should measure the marshmallows.   I love to make peanut butter fudge.  Just replace the choc chips with peanut butter chips and the nuts with 1/2 C peanut butter.  It is really good layered with the regular fudge.

I'm so happy to find this recipe again! I used to make it years ago and it's sooo good, not to mention super easy!

Good, but I've never really liked fudge with marshmallows, it doesn't taste "real".

Having never made fudge before, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this was!  I made one batch with nuts (almonds b/c that's what I had on hand) and one without, and both turned out great!  One thing I might change in the future is to use milk chocolate (or half semi-sweet, have milk chocolate) because the semi-sweet just seemed a little too rich for my liking.  But the consistency of this fudge was great--creamy enough to melt in your mouth, but solid enough to stick together and cut into pieces easily.

The taste was delicious, but mine did not set correctly.  I followed the recipe exactly, but omitted the nuts.  I ended up with a tray of gooey chocolate. Too runny to cut, too thick to pour. (We're eating it with a spoon because it is still too yummy to waste!)  My question is about the marshmallows.  The bag says 10.5 oz.  So I used 2 bags, thinking that was the right amount of ounces for 2.5 cups.  Should I have measured the marshmallows into measuring cups instead?  I probably wouldn't have even used a full bag that way.Does anyone know?  Thanks!

I followed the recipe as written but used pecans instead of walnuts. Delicious. I normally don't like fudge but this was excellent and not so sweet as regular fudge.Be sure to use only 2 cups measured of marshmallows not 2 cups equivalent in ounces.

Amazing!  I poured over all the recipes and decided on this one because it was the closest to what I rembered making 2 years ago.  I used mini marshmallows and measured them.  I followed the recipe exactly and aside from some serious stirring, it was easy.  I am going to attempt to double it next time.  I also omitted nuts because my family doesn't care for them.

Very good, I didnt have plain Marshmellows only the colorful ones and this still turned out fine! The texture isn't like a true fudge though, but this is nice to have on hand for guests! great, easy recipe!

I make this every Christmas, great easy fudge recipe!  To answer Holly's question below, yes she used WAY too many marshmallows!  You should use 2 cups measured out in a measuring cup, less than 1/2 of a 10.5oz bag.  It should start to set up very quickly once you remove it from the heat, so don't waste much time getting it in the pan.  I have never had this recipe fail me, it is a tradition for us.

I just made two batches of this in a row, and they both turned out great. I've never made fudge before, but it was really simple to make and I had no problems at all. I'm planning to try to make other flavours soon, such as Vanilla (with white chocolate chips and real vanilla bean) or maple (as above but with maple flavouring).

I love this recipe!  I will never go back to the traditional thermometer method ever again.  If you have trouble with soft-ball, hard-ball, and crackle candies then this is the recipe for you.
