This was unbelievably good. My husband asked me not to make again because he couldn't stop eating it. Best cheese cake ever.

I made this for Valentine's Day and we loved it. It was easy and delicious. I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the cheesecake mixture. I may have made a mistake with the brownie mix and it seemed like it needed more liquid or something. I expected the crust to be a bit less dense. Very good, but a little thick and hard to cut thru   Would definitely make this recipe again.

Great recipe!  I only used half the brownie mix. The whole mix was too thick. Also added half cup of Amaretto.

this was very good. my suggestion is not putting the cherry layer in the middle. I could not get the cheesecake layer to set properly over the cherries.
