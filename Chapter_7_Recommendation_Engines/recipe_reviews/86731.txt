I'm a chef from New Orleans, and the best thing about real cajun food/recipes is that they were created just like you did it...trial and error and local favorites. Most of the dishes you eat from here are not how we eat it anyway! great job, I liked it.

Sorry for disappointing the person from New Orleans. I did not copy this recipe from someone in New Orleans, so it may not be authentic, but I tried to model the taste after ones I have had during several of my trips to New Orleans.  I hope someone likes it at least!

Since I am from New Orleans, I know this is NOT how you make etoufee. But you're on the right track. I would suggest taking out the cream soups and replacing with 2 cups of vegtable stock and 2 tablespoons of flour. Also, add a can of diced tomatoes.

This is how we make it at home. People from NO like tomatoes in everything but in Acadian we don't put tomatoes or orka in gumbo or in etouffe. If you have the time to cook the crawfish down then make a cream sauce with flour and broth but most people don't have the time. I use one stick of butter per pound and only cream of mushroom because cream of celery gives it a funny color. I cook the onion and celery together. In Acadian less is more. A little tony's and cook it down and you are done. It is simple and good.

This recipe was excellent.  I made it for "the girls" at work and they all demanded the recipe.  Great Job!

I use old bay seasoning to make it a little more spicy.

Great Recipe.. There's absolutely nothing wrong with putting your own spin on your fave dishes. Nobody said you were doing a N'ORLEANS Etoufee...you said it is designed after it. Love it; I prefer it without the tomatoes too.. I just prefer it that way. Thanks for the recipe MIKI, cos all the others had tomatoes ; . Love it!!

AMAZING!!! Loved it so much. We fought over the leftovers. I left out the celery soup and added more crawfish AND some corn. Have heard some add white wine - maybe next time.

I made this exactly as directed with the addition of 1 Tsp of Zatarains Creole Seasoning.  Turned out Absolutely Great!  It had a tiny bit of bite, but not too much.  I do realize it isn't EXACTLY like what I had in New Orleans, but I feel it is better because the flavors were so smooth, even without the Roux smokyness.  Great Recipe.

This recipe was very bland to me...I'm from Louisiana however and eat everything very spicy.  I added extra seasonings and spices and it turned out good.  Overall, it was a great jumping off point, just needed a little more kick for my taste.

I was born and raised in New Iberia, La - the heart of Cajun Country! I've made etouffee all different ways over the years, and this is by far the best way.

I read some people say to take out the soups, but honestly I rather it this way (it also helps to 'stretch' it out for a bigger family). 

The only thing I do add is Rotel (another staple in Cajun Country!)....

For innovation and simplicity and for a delicious meal I gave you 5 stars.

We had some crawfish left over from a boil and I wanted a quick fix for them. Your recipe did the trick!

I also chopped up some sausage from the boil and cooked it with the etouffee as well....good stuff.

I did change it some because the crawfish were already salty and spicy but it was great.

This was pretty good, we enjoyed it. I added a bit more seasoning (We like it spicy). It is quite different from the classic New Orleans type, but in fairness, the recipe does say a "version of" and "fashioned after".

Very good recipe.  Instead of cayenne I used a drop of crab boil you get the hit of heat after you swallow. I also added a bay leaf.

This is a great recipe! I did change and eliminate some ingredients but it still remained delicious. I substituted the chicken stock for shrimp stock and eliminated the white pepper and green onions only because I didn’t have those items. I will be repeating this recipe.

Used cream of chicken & cream of celery soups instead of mushroom. 
Served over egg noodles. Hubby's words-Absolutely devine.

This is a fantastic recipe that is easy and packs a ton of flavor! I recently visited New Orleans and had a craving for Etouffee when I got home. I followed the recipe with the only exception of adding a bit more water to make it more soupy. I have one extremely picky eater who barely spoke while shoveling spoonfuls in her mouth and asking for seconds when her bowl was empty. Everyone in the family gave it an A+. This recipe is a keeper! Well done, thank you!

This is a great, quick recipe for étouffée. I'm from the NO area and am also strapped for time with 4 kids, college, and work. I quadrupled the recipe and sautéed store bought crab meat(Oh my!!!) in butter, crab boil, and the veggies. Each of my kids had 2 bowls and the hubby had 2 bowls and is taking some to work for the guys to try! No, it's not "authentic", but with people crunching time nowadays, it was the most delicious quick étouffée I've ever had. No tomatoes here!

No cream of mushroom soup. Used all cream of celery. It was delicious!
