These are great and very low calorie!  The first time I made them I used quick oats and soaked them for an hour, which made them completely unnoticeable.  We were disappointed that they weren’t more “oaty".  So the next time I used old-fashioned oats and only soaked them as long as it took me to get the rest of the ingredients together (about half an hour) which gave them a chewier texture and an “oaty” flavor he really likes.  As suggested by other reviewers I added spices- 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  The store was out of buttermilk so I used regular with a Tablespoon of vinegar.  They turned out wonderfully.

If you want non-sugary, soft, non-crumbly and healthy muffins this is the PERFECT recipe.  I made these muffins for my 10 month old daughter and very picky 3 year old son and they LOVED them.  I used white flour because I was out of wheat, I used organic no sugar added applesauce, I decreased the brown sugar to about 1/4 of a cup packed and then loaded the batter with fresh ripe good quality blueberries.  I made mini muffins and each muffin has 3 to 4 big blueberries in it. They were perfect for little ones.  If you are having trouble with this recipe try weighing the flour.  Once I started weighing my flour to measure, all my recipes come out perfect.  Since these muffins have very little fat you have to grease the pan completely or they will stick.  Also, if you are looking for full flavor and sweet this is not the recipe for you.  You can add spices and more sugar as suggested if you want that.

To up the fiber and cholesterol fighting factor here’s my recipe: 1c multi-grain oats, 1c flour, 1/2c of whole ground flaxseed meal, 1/3c of oat bran, 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, 1 tsp baking powder, ½ tsp baking soda. In separate bowl mix together: 1c applesauce, 1/2c 1% milk, 1/2c brown sugar, 1/4c of canola oil (or extra applesauce, but I used the oil), 1 egg. Add wet ingredients to dry ones. Then to the mix I added almond slivers and 2/3c of dried cranberries. Before baking lightly top each muffin with a mixture of 2/3c oats, 3 tbsp brown sugar, 2 tbsp applesauce, 1 tsp cinnamon. Spray mini-muffin pan, in dark pan bake at 350 degrees for 16-18 minutes. Makes 3 dozen mini-muffins. Each mini is about 85 calories, most are from fiber and grains, but you can cut this number back substantially by using applesauce instead of oil.

This muffins are really great. I was really pleased with the way they turned out. I was a bit afraid about it at first because they didn't sound that great. But they are really gerat. I used fat free milk to make them with no fat and my friend in weight watchers loved them!! At 2 points each she was simply in heaven!! Theyhave a really great fiber content too.

A great, healthy recipe! Instead of buttermilk, I used plain yogurt with a little bit of peach yogurt (I can't find buttermilk in any supermarket in Chile, but plain yogurt works as a great substitute). I added a chopped up apple, raisins, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and a tablespoon of honey. I didn't have muffin tins, so I baked it in a 9x9 pan for about 45 min. It came out wonderfully! I can't wait to try this recipe as muffins.

These tasted great, but the two hour oatmeal soak took a while.  I used quick oats and didn't soak them as long, used egg substitute, and added apple pie spice.  My husband even liked them-I didn't tell him they were healthy!  I will definitely make them again.

These were great! I did make some modifications. I used quick oats and 1% milk with some vingegar to cut down the fat. Also, for ease, I let them soak while I was at work so they were ready to use when I got home. Also, I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 3/4 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. vanilla, and a 1/2 fresh peach diced small. I also only cooked them for 20 minutes. They rose very nicely, and they were light and fluffy. I got great reviews from my friends! Thanks for a great recipe that you can adjust and add different ingredients to create great muffins!

This is not the cake/dessert like muffins most people are used to; the are hearty! And no, they are not to everyone's taste (one of my kids friends really did not care for them) but, if you are looking for something very filling and fun to make for breakfast- this is it. The basic ingredients allow for plenty of tweaking. I decrease the amount of applesauce (too much gives off an odd smell and taste) to about 1/3 cup and added plenty of spices like ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice etc. I have added grated carrot, chopped apple, blueberry, molasses, craisins... whatever I have had on hand at the time. One thing I really recommend is warming your milk in a saucepan and then adding the oats (this allows the oats to soften quickly). Then just dump the rest of your ingredients in the same saucepan, adding the egg last. They can go straight from warm saucepan to muffin pan to oven. Thanks for a great recipe!

Not quite sweet enough for my taste, but my boyfriend loves them because they're filling and full of fiber. Interesting texture.. if oatmeal were to take on the form of a muffin, this is how it would taste. I added cinnamon.. next time I'll add more sugar.

Way better than expected, thanks to tips from other reviewers! Followed recipe except for not soaking the oats that long (maybe 20 min?) and also added: 2 tsp cinnamon, 3/4tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2tsp pumpkin pie spice. I lined the muffin tins with butter, filled about 2/3, then put some diced peach in each cup then covered with another spoon of dough. Sprinkled with cinnamon-sugar & after 25 min, they were finished, beautiful and came out of the cups perfectly. The peach surprise in the middle was delicious, reminiscent of peach cobbler, but more guilt free :) Thanks for the recipe!

All baked goods need a small amount of salt to keep them from tasting flat. 1/2 teaspoon of salt mixed into the dry ingredients will prevent the bland taste some reviewers have noticed. With the addition of salt these muffins are very tasty. I added a chopped apple, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.

Yum!  I added 2 tsp cinnamon and 3/4 cup of raisins to the mix and they came out YUMMY!  I didn't have time to let the oats sit for two hours (6 hungry kids!) so I heated up the buttermilk substitute (1 tsp lemon juice in regular milk) just until first bubbles formed and then let it sit like that until it was time to add to the mix.  Baked at 400F for 20 minutes in middle of oven.  Moist, great texture, sweet enough... just YUMMY!!!!

I make a double batch of these twice a week!  They are fabulous and I'm absolutely hooked!  Initially, I made the mistake of substituting all-purpose flour for the whole wheat flour as it was all I had on hand--the result was a poor texture.  Now that I'm actually making the recipe as it is written (haha) the texture is just like any other hearty muffin.  I only soak the oatmeal for about an hour and that seems to work just fine.  All in all--these muffins are addictively yummy and healthy!

I thought that these were great, but I modified them a tiny bit.  The first time I made them they stuck to the paper wrapper, so I use the paper wrapper and then sprayed the wrapper with cooking spray.  I used soy milk once and almond milk another time, both batches came out well.  I preferred a more 'oaty' texture so on the second batch, I only soaked the oats for an hour, and really enjoyed the results.  Lastly, and forgive me 'unhealthing' them a bit, I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  The kids think they are getting a treat, when they are basically very healthy.  The muffins only get around three or four chips each, but it's enough for the kids to enjoy them like cupcakes.

What a great little recipe! I halved it; for the egg I just used a yolk because I'm lazy. I only had quick oats, so I soaked them in milk and a little vinegar for about 10 minutes while we stirred up the dry ingredients. Made 6 perfect sized muffins. They were really soft and tasty (I did add a dash of cinnamon), a great treat for my 5 year old! Even with his 'help' they only took about 15 minutes to stir up, so really easy too. Thanks for a great kid friendly recipe!

After reading reviews, I made these with Splenda, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 cup raisins. I also used quick oats.  They were delicious and were eaten up within 1/2 hour.

For a healthy muffin, these are pretty darn tasty! I added the following based on other reviews: 1 tsp vanilla, 2 tsp cinnamon, and 1 diced apple.  I used skim milk instead of buttermilk because that's what I had on hand.  I also used only egg whites.  I baked at 375 for about 20 minutes and lightly dusted the tops with cinnamon sugar.  Very tasty!

This is a good base muffin recipe that lends itself to a varitey of additions.  I chose to add some walnuts and dried cranberries which added great texture as well as flavor.  I also added a little brown sugar oatmeal streusel on the top.  I think these are best warmed with a little butter and a cup of tea.  Will be trying again with some added cinnamon and diced apples.

Add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the batter to boost flavor. This recipe makes a healthy breakfast or snack. I had a similar recipe from my mom but it was from the less health-conscious days and used white flour and 1/2 cup of melted butter instead of the applesauce. Of course I like that one better, but its not so healthy!

These muffins turned out so good.  I was so glad to find a healthy lowfat muffin.  I follow some of the review advice and added 1 tsp of cinnamon and vanilla, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and salt, and I added one diced apple.  Definetly only bake for 20 minutes.

I got great results from this recipe along with some of the recommended changes. I microwaved the oats and buttermilk for 1.5 minutes, and let it sit as I preheated the oven and prepared the rest of my ingredients. As some reviewers suggested, I added 2 tsp. cinnamon, 3/4 tsp. salt, and a tsp. of vanilla. I myself threw in a dash of nutmeg. It really only needed to bake about 20-25 minutes, and I sprinkled a teensy bit of brown sugar on top when they were hot out of the oven, but it wasn't too necessary... really good, but not necessary! Either way, they tasted great to me, but I've always preferred whole wheat. I'm glad I found a 100% whole wheat recipe like this one. Sometimes whole wheat can be a little dry, but these had a great moist texture and a delicious flavour!

Had to use quick oats as the only other ones I had were steelcut.  Also made my applesauce from scratch so added some cinnamon plus threw in a pinch of salt.  Next time will not use paper liners either as they really stuck due to lack of fat I guess.
Definitely not a CAKE type muffin with streusel on top, more like a compact fibre product made to be taken with juice, water, coffee, etc. to be a breakfast subsitute which is what I need.

I love this one! I add 1 tsp salt, 3tsp of cinnamon ,2 tsp of vanilla and 4Tbsp of flax when I double the recipe. They freeze well and the kids and I snack on them or eat them for breakfast till we run out.  Oh and only 20 minutes baking time for my oven.

First, half hour cook time?  NOOOO. 18 minutes for me on 350. Pretty decent overall for what it is; VERY healthy (90 calories each), and pretty filling if you eat two. Downside, even after gratuitous spices (tons of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger)and such, it's still a bit on the bland side.  Even kind of moist and tender.

Plus side?  Made the house smell AMAZING.  Just wish it tasted more how it smelled, the batter was even pretty flavorful.  It absolutely has potential, I just have to find the right tweaks.

I made this today and they turned out well. I did make a few modifications...  I didn't have buttermilk so I used skim milk with a dash of apple cider vinegar.  I added 1/4 cup of flax seed meal, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla for additional flavor.  I also included some slightly rehydrated dried cranberries.    These muffins are not excessively sweet or flavorful, so I can't imagine what they would've been without the cinnamon and vanilla.  I think this is a good recipe to use as a base for muffins.

Yummy! For such healthy muffins, they're really good. I soaked the oats for about an hour and a half, and the texture was perfect. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, & 1/2 tsp salt, and sprayed the muffin cups with Pam before baking. Next time (and there will definitely be a next time!) I'll bake them on the bottom rack, since the bottoms were a little too moist even though the tops were well done.

I didn't need to let my oats soak in the buttermilk (actually "soured" nonfat milk) for two hours. I gave it about twenty minutes and we were good to go. I used my own homemade organic spiced applesauce, cut down the sugar to less than 1/4 cup, added vanilla extract and about a cup of organic blueberries for added fiber/fruit. These turned out great and the kids loved them. OMG, these smell SO good while baking.

These are great if you are looking for a healthy muffin. I make them for my 1 year old and he loves them. No, they are not as tasty as some muffin recipes that are really cake masquerading as a breakfast food, but sweet enough for us! They are good with some extra spices, but also good as written.

Very good healthy recipe! I only let the oats sit in the milk a few minutes (not 2 hours), I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup honey, and I added 3/4 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg for added flavor. Because there's no fat in the recipe, they stuck to the paper liners while they were warm. After they cooled completely, the liners peeled off easily. I recommend either not using liners and spraying the pan with Pam or spraying the inside of the liners with Pam.

Super moist and yummy!  Could have used more spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.) and I personally would use some Splenda as well next time for more sweetness.  But overall, a great basic muffin recipe.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used vanilla soymilk w/ a tbsp. of lemon juice instead and also used an egg substitute.

I really like these. I, per other reviewers, added 1/2 t nutmeg, 3/4 t cinnamon, 1/2 t salt and 1 t vanilla. I froze some of these as well, and they tasted fantastic about a month later! I plan to make these regularly and just keep them in the freezer so I can grab one in the morning and have a healthy snack and filling snack by the afternoon.

A smashing hit! Delicious and healthy recipe. These turned out so well. A dozen were gone in a few days. Afterwards my boyfriend said, Are there anymore? So I am making my second batch now!
I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of buttermilk and coconut sugar instead of brown sugar. I added a quarter cup of pumpkin puree, a handful of chopped walnuts, tsp cinnamon, one cup of chopped and skinned green apple, and a quarter cup of whole ground flaxseed meal for fiber. This recipe is my new favorite.

These are good as is, but GREAT if you make some modifications.  Add 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1 diced apple.  Only adds about 10 calories:  122 cal, 2 g fat, 3 g fiber, 11.6g sugar, 2.8g protein.

This is our new, guilt-free breakfast (or snack) muffin that is absolutely delicious!  I have DOUBLED the fiber content by GRINDING oats (using a coffee grinder) and used the oat flour to REPLACE the whole wheat flour. No need to buy the expensive oat flour at the store when you can make it yourself! I find it bakes and tastes the same, too! I also halved the sugar to 1/4 cup and increased the applesauce to a full cup.  Along with the other reviewers, I added 1 tsp vanilla, 2 tsp cake spice/all spice, 1 tsp salt.  In addition, I have added 1 cup of craisins and raisins.  Looking to add apples, nuts, berries, bananas, carrots, or zucchini in the future!  The variations are endless!  Awesome recipe!

Super Healthy wow great basic recipe... these taste great as they are but you can add what ever you want to these and they will taste excellent and be healthy... I added 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and about 1/3- 1/2 cup raisins soaked in water.. and they turned out great... blueberries might also be great... I think if you want to make them even healthier you can increase the apple sauce to 3/4 cup and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup... but as is these are very tasty and super healthy

Very easy to make. I made these with rice flour as I am allergic to wheat. Anything that converts to gluten free or low gluten is a 5-star in my book! I also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla, as well as a chopped up apple that I needed to use up quickly. Will definitely make again!

I know these are intended to be healthy, so obviously they are not going to be super good, but these were not very good.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and 1/2 cup of pecan pieces.  If you are trying to eat really healthy and added some spices, etc. to this, these would be okay I suppose.  They are just very dry and would have no flavor as written.

For a low calorie, healthy muffin these taste great. I made a few alterations though. I used 3/4 c. all purpose flour as I didn't have whole wheat, added 1/4 c. wheat germ, and cut back a little on the sugar since I used regular sweetened applesauce. I only soaked the oats for about 45 minutes. They came out wonderfully moist and had just the right amount of sweetness. Like other reviewers I did find that 30 minutes was too long for them to bake, mine were done at around 25 minutes

These were extremely good and super moist! You couldn't even tell there was no butter, etc in them. I suggest baking them for a little less than 30 minutes and I made them in to blueberry muffins by adding a generous amount of frozen blueberries and 1 tsp. vanilla. We had no buttermilk either, so I used 1 cup 1% milk and 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar. I also wanted to speed up the soaking process (just because I was hungry and impatient) so I microwaved the oat/buttermilk combo for 1 minutes first and then let it sit for about 20 minutes. The muffins had a great, chewy but not too chewy texture.

I give these 5-stars for what they are...low fat, low-calorie good tasting muffins.  When you make a low fat muffin you can always expect a "rubbery" outside, but there's not much you can do about that shy of adding extra butter and/or oil...but then it's not low fat.  Besides that, the inside is moist and the muffin has great flavow.  I used low fat buttermilk and because I had another recipe I was making today that called for two egg yolks I used two egg whites in this instead of 1 whole egg just so I didn't waste any egg and it came out just fine.  I may add some cinnamon and raisins next time for even more flavor.  I will be making theses again.

4.5 stars. For a muffin with hardly any fat, amazing. The only gripe I have (and I was expecting it) is that they come out slightly rubbery because of the substitution of applesauce for oil. Still, they were very good. Make them with cinnamon and nutmeg for a slightly jazzed up muffin. Oh, and add a dash of salt. (One last little thing: if you don't want to wake up two hours earlier just to soak the oats, then combine the milk--or 1 Tbsp. vinegar and enough milk to fill one cup--and oats and soak them overnight in the fridge.)

Wonderful! A big hit with my husband.  Used regular milk with a little bit of vinegar since I didn't have buttermilk.

Fantastic!! I followed this recipe exactly with only one exception, I added blueberries.the only problem I had is they stick to the paper liners. If anyone has a way to avoid sticking this would be a five star recipe for sure! I will be making them again. I found them to taste great and I like the texture. Thanks for this one, my five year old son is asking if he can take some to school tomorrow for him and his friends and his teachers!! I guess they got his approval.
I made this again without paper liners and used non stick spray. Worked like a charm! No more paper liners for me! 
Thanks again for this gem

These muffins came out with the perfect texture and taste!  I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon, some raisins and some chopped apples and they were just delicious!  The best muffin I've ever made with whole wheat flour.  I love cooking healthy, but only when it tastes great too, and these muffins can't be beat!

I really wanted to like these muffins, but they were very bland. The baking soda flavor was strong. After baking one batch, I doctored up the batter and  added more sugar, cinnamon, allspice, salt, and cardamom, almonds, and blueberries. I'll continue to tweak this because I like the idea of filling and healthy muffins... these just need some work, in my opinion.

Unfortunately, I just looked at the star rating on these and made them as directed without reading the reviews.  They were horribly bland.  After eating them we agreed that cinnamon and raisins would probably make them much better.  I topped them with come cream cheese icing which made them edible but it kinda defeated the purpose of the low fat low sugar muffin.  As written, the recipe gets only one star.

Amazing!  These are subtly sweet and wonderful for a snack.  I did do a couple of substitutions: 1/4 brown sugar and 1 tbsp honey instead of 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup eggbeater instead of the egg.  I also didn't wait the full 2 hours since I was in a hurry; I only waited 1. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to it as well.  Overall, amazing, moist muffins packed with fiber.  :)  Next time I'm putting blueberries in them!

I make these all the time now.  Sometimes I  mix the milk and oats together and put in the refrigerator overnight to mix with the dry ingredients and bake the next day.  Like others, I add cinnamon and a little nutmeg.  I rarely have buttermilk on hand, so I substitute 1 tablespoon lemon juice and enough skim milk to make one cup.  Always turns out great and guilt free!

A great nutrious muffin. They are a little bland on their own, but I add lots of cinnamon for taste. I also put in some flaxseed for an extra health kick. Don't use paper muffin holders... too hard to get out. I also use regular milk with a teaspoon of lemon juice instead of buttermilk to make it lower fat.

THESE are my new standard recipe muffins. The only changes I make is to add 1 cup of fresh or frozen berries, add 1/2 cup of wheat germ or use 1/2 cup opat and 1/2 cup wheat germ,  and cook for 27 minutes @ 375. They are so delicious, moist, and if you don't tell, noone will know how good they are for you.

I would not recommend using paper muffin cups for this one. My muffins wouldn't come out of them. That said, I really liked the buttermilky (is that a word?) taste of these as well as the texture that the oatmeal gives them.

Very delicious muffins, very easy to make. My entire family loves them! I used quick oats and only soaked them for about forty minutes, and I added slightly over 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 3/4 teaspoons of salt. I topped them with brown sugar. The cooked ten minutes faster then the recipe suggested. Overall, they were great, and the lowest calorie muffin I have found so far. Will definitely make them again.

These muffins are very good. For people that rated it low for flavor, its because these are healthy low calorie muffins. Low fat and sugar. I did use sweetened applesauce and blueberries and non fat milk. I used a mini muffin tin which made them about 16 calories a piece! they were pretty moist so next time I might reduce the applesauce a little bit.

These are great. Not overly sweet. My 3 year-old really likes them, and it makes me feel like she's getting something pretty healthy for breakfast. I add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla. I also only soak the oats for the time it takes me to get the rest of the stuff prepared and they always come out fine. I've made them a bunch.

These muffins came out nice and moist, however I felt they lacked a little on flavour.  May try them again and add some blueberries.  I will also grease the muffin tins rather than use paper liners, as it was difficult to get the muffin out .

These are really good.  I used cinnamon applesauce since that was all that I had and I added vanilla.  I also added craisins and will add an overripe banana next time for a little more mooisture.  I took some to my parents and they loved them as well!  Something to keep in mind when tasting these is that they are a HEALTHY muffin.  This isn't your typical buttery, full fat muffin you could get from Starbucks.

I liked this muffin, but had to make some modifications as we live at a higher altitude. When made exactly as listed, they came out quite rubbery due to a combo of the lack of fat and our high altitude. Added 1 T of Canola oil, but still a little rubbery on top. Still, quite good, nevertheless!

Delicious!  I adapted it to what I had on hand, and it still came out great.  Used 2% milk instead of buttermilk and only let it soak while preparing the rest.  Used gluten free pancake / baking mix in place of flour.  My mix already had some baking powder and baking soda, so I only used half as much of each as this recipe called for.  Used a version of raw, Costa Rican sugar, which is course and less sweet, rather than real brown sugar.  I added: a 1/4 cup coconut oil + 1/3 cup raisins + 1 tsp cinnamon.    We couldn't wait for them to cool before tasting.  Will be a good breakfast bread.

With the changes I made I think these were great.  I added cinnamon and vanilla, as well as a bit of extra chunky (sugar-free) applesauce.  Also, these only baked about 10 minutes.  At 30 minutes they would have been completely burned!

I made a giant batch of these for my kids and parents and everyone loved them. We added a big bag of frozen blueberries, didn't change the recipe besides that. My kids loved the mini muffin version and would chow down several at a time. I love that there is no guilt and it tastes good! A great anytime snack.

Awesome muffins! Very moist and fulfilling. I made some slight changes to the recipe. To begin I didn't have 2 hours to soak the oats, so instead I popped the oats and buttermilk in the microwave for about 11/2 minutes covered with saran wrap. This softended the oats perfectly without turning them into complete mush. I also added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin pie spice to make more of a spice muffin. I don't know why, but my muffins only took about 15 minutes to bake completely through. I'm guessing that when I microwaved the oats my muffin mixture was slightly warm which caused them to bake in much less time. I'm very pleased with this recipe and I will definitely be making this often.

Decent basic recipe. Its really easy to make and healthy, but lacks flavour. I added splenda and more cinnamin to give it a little more.

These muffins turned out great! I made them as minimuffins with paper liners, and my only complaint is that they stuck to the paper too much. Next time I'd definitely use a greased muffin tray without paper liners.  I followed the advice left by other reviewers, and added cinnamon, salt and vanilla. Buttermilk isn't sold where I live, so I used milk and 2tbsp of vinegar instead. I also only soaked the oats for about an hour. I'll definitely make these again, though next time I'll probably use less sugar than the recipe says. Still, great muffins and remarkably filling!

I followed the recipe and then based on other reviews added to it.  I added 2tsp. cinnamon as well as used cinnamon applesauce, 1/2tsp nutmeg, 2tsp vanilla and threw in 2 diced up apples.  The muffins only took 17 min. to bake and even though I basically filled the cups they barely rose out of the pan.  With my modifications they were really good, however I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have been so without the extras.

Requires way too much modification to add flavor to warrant anymore stars than this.  Even after adding cinnamon and raisons these were still very bland.  A decent base to start with, but flavorless as is.

I will be making this recipe again.  After reading some of the other users reviews I decided to make some changes (which the muffins were still a little bland so I will up the measurements next time). I added 1tsp vanilla and cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 cup of wheat germ and 2 medium  granny smith apples shredded.  Another thing I noticed was the muffins were sticking to the muffin liners (not sure if this was because of the changes to the recipe), so next time I will used a greased pan.

I made several changes to this recipe, but the end result was super delicious! A definite make again! In addition to this recipes ingredients I added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1 and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp salt, 4 tblsp. wheat germ, 1/2 tblsp. vanilla, 1 tblsp. vegetable oil, and 2 tblsp. honey. I also just used regular milk (whole) instead of buttermilk, and only soaked for about 20 minutes. In the end they only cooked for 15 minutes, and came out moist, chewy, and quite flavorable (nice and sweet with a light spice). They had a more cake like consistency, and actually tasted like a light spice cake, or a carrot cake (minus the carrots).

Yummy. Everyone loved them. Added 1 tsp of ground cinnamon, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, and almost 1 tsp of salt. Also added 1 tsp of vinegar to the plain milk. Another addition I put in was about 1/2 cup of raisens and 1/4 cup of dark chocolate chipss! They were excellent! Didn't have applesauce on hand, so I put in roughly 1/3 cup apple juice and 1/4 cup of flax seed. Very healthy! Thanks for the yummy breakfast muffins!

very good muffins!  I used paper liners though and half of each muffin wouldn't peel off of the paper.  I added cinnamon and vanilla to mine to give them some flavor.  Next time I think I'll add some grated apple too.  I'm going to add flax too for some added fibre.

These are delicious & healthy.   Changes: Used egg beaters in place of the egg Used quick cooking oats, but still soaked them 2 hours. Chopped up 1 cup of a peeled apple & drizzled with honey - let sit while oats soaked (added extra moisture & sweetness) baked about 13 minutes.

i love these muffins, i started making them when i was doing weight watchers, i subbed splenda instead of brown sugar to cut calories and i always added either diced, peeled apples to them or mashed bananas for added nutrition and flavor. also cinnamon is a must. they always turned out delicious and moist for me. this is a really great healthy base muffin recipe.

The muffins taste great and it was pretty easy to do. I recommend greasing the pan rather than using muffin cups though-- the only downfall I had making these was that so much of it sticks to the muffin cups!

Knowing ahead of time that these would be "healthy" muffins helped with my expectations of how they turned out.  My husband loved them and they really are a tasty muffin.  I also didn't find the soaking necessary, or at least not that long of a soak as was listed.  I wanted to also note that quick oats work well in the recipe too but there is no need for any soaking with those.  Also notice there is not salt in the recipe so if that is a concern you could add in 1/2 tsp for a 12 batch.  You can also use 1% milk.

For a variation:  Try adding cinnamon (1 tsp for a batch of 12 muffins) and raisins to taste!  YUM!

I was looking for a healthy and Yummy muffin.  Sorry to say this was not it. These are very moist and tend to get more moist the longer they sit, kind of gross moist.  My boyfriend who typically eats anything said these were "different" and ate only 1 of these. I ended up throwing them out.  We found them to be very bland and taste "healthy" which is not what you want from a muffin. Ive tried much better recipes from this site for healthy muffins and will not be making this one again. Sorry.

I was looking for a healthy fat free muffin that was also tasty.  This fits the bill.  I used some of the other reviewer's suggestions and loved the way these muffins came out.  I used fat free milk with vinegar as a substitute for buttermilk and egg substitute rather than the egg.  I also used apple pie spice and increased the brown sugar to three quarters of a cup.  Mine were done in about 20 minutes.  I will be making these again.

I have been meaning to rate and review this one for ages as I have been making it for a good couple years now!  Made these again yesterday and we love these muffins, they're hearty and healthy.  I use quick oats for mine and usually up the applesauce (I buy unsweetened) by about 1/4 cup (based on 12 muffins).  I don't know why (maybe it's my oven), but mine are usually done in 15 minutes tops!  Sometimes I add raisins too, but often double the recipe so I can freeze some.  Great muffins!!!

Perfecto! I made this recipe using plain yogurt instead of buttermilk, and I added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. The muffins were wonderfully soft and slightly chewy with a mild sweet flavor.  People who like cakey, sugary muffins may be disappointed with this recipe, but I loved it, as I prefer a slightly dense and slightly sweet "tea cake" with my coffee. I would eat these muffins for breakfast or dessert. Verdict? Healthy, tasty, quick to make, and filling--who could ask for more from a humble muffin?

After several attempts this is the best alteration of the recipe. Instead of applesauce use 1/2 c nonfat sour cream. This made the muffin very moist. I also added pealed, diced apple, 1 tsp cinnamon, dash of salt, dash of nutmeg and vanilla. It could have used more spices. Try the nonfat sour cream!

I think these are great. I tried to make just muffin tops, well...they spread a bit too much so turned out like cakelike cookies and very yummy. I used nonfat creamer instead of buttermilk and only soaked oats for half an hour due to busy day, added 1/3 cup craisins and 1/4 cup sunflower seeds  and used a finely chopped apple instead of apple sauce...I will be eating these for a quick breakfast. Wrapping in wax paper and freezing so to take out one a day. A great way to get healthy food and not too high in fat, and a sweet craving satisfied early in the day. Thanks!

I love this recipe! I added a diced apple and some chopped almonds, which gave the muffins extra texture and crunch. It comes out very moist and delicious!

These muffins burnt really badly in 30 minutes, and were very difficult to get out of the muffin tins. They also had a little too much tang...perhaps that was the buttermilk. Otherwise, very good. I added 1/2 - 3/4 cup chopped apple and a little flax seed and wheat bran.

Pretty good muffin considering it's quite healthy for you!  Slightly chewy, somewhat dense and very textured muffin.  I added a little over a 1/2 cup of chopped apples and a teaspoon or two of cinnamon and a little nutmeg. Great for breakfast on the go.

This was a great recipe, exactly what I had been looking for.  It has a great texture and it is high in fiber.  It fits perfectly into a cholesterol reducing diet (I substituted 2 whites for the egg).  I did add cinnamon and a little cloves to add some spice.  Great recipe!

These muffins were so moist and soft, not what you'd expect for something that didn't need butter. This recipe is so versatile and healthy, you could be creative and put anything in it. The recipe sayas that you have to soak the oats for 2 hours, but I only waited one hour and they turned out just fine.

These were a little bland, but really moist.  I'll use more cinnamon next time, and maybe a few bananas or something.

Pretty good! A little bland in taste, even with the addition of another 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 teaspoon of apple pie spice. Still, that's a minor complaint. They taste good -- just not really flavorful. Maybe next time I'll try adding some chopped nuts or dried fruit to liven things up a bit. The texture is outstanding, very moist and delicious, and for so few calories, one of these muffins is quite filling. All in all, this is a healthy recipe that I will definitely make again.

Excellent.....Excellent!!!!    Have been wanting a muffin since being on my diet...but couldn't  bring myself to eat all those calories!!  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2  tsp. nutmeg, and 1/2  tsp. salt,plus 1 tsp. vanilla.  I  also put in some cranraisins (of which I put in hot water while I was getting the ingredients together, to make them nice and soft and plump.).    I have NEVER tasted a low calorie muffin so good.  Hats off to you!!!!!!!!!!

Delicious! I used quick oats and only soaked them in skim milk for long enough for me to mix up the rest of the ingredients. I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg. I plan on making a lot of these!!

In making this recipe, which I doubled,I followed the suggestions not to let the oats soak for two hours, just while I prepared the other ingredients.  In doubling the recipe, I cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 cup.  This made no appreciable difference to the result.  These muffins were moist but not at all "gummy" and, with the addition of cinnamon and nutmeg, about a teaspoon of each, had a very nice spicy flavour, and oatmeal taste.  Great recipe for freezing!

I should have added some raisins and chopped nuts as I found these muffins a little bit on the bland side.  I found them to be a bit chewy and was expecting them to be airy and light. Since this was a very easy recipe, I will give it another shot and add cinnamon, raisins, and walnuts.

An outstanding "healthy" muffin that is surprisingly light in texture.   Not too much sugar, made with whole grains which you could amp up by adding a few tablespoons of flax seeds.  Unfortunately, I did not have flax seeds but I did add a touch of cinnamon, craisins and walnuts.  This is my kind of recipe:  easy to make and nutritious.

Very good; I added Craisins and pie spice.  Couldn't wait two hours so warmed the milk (regular with a little lemon juice added) before adding to the oats, then warmed in microwave for 30 seconds.

Nice moisture. Others like the muffin, but I found it a little bland, even after doubling cinnamon and using two different varieties.  Good enough that I'll play around with adding more spice.

a sweeter version of the Easy Oatmeal Muffins. (tastes like sugar.) i cut down on the sugar to about 1/3 cup because i had regular sweet applesauce. not sure the buttermilk made a difference. could probably just use regular milk. only soaked for about 15 mins, and that was plenty in the buttermilk. cooked for 28 mins. delicious, slightly heavier than Easy Oatmeal Muffins.

Very good. I had some leftover applesauce and buttermilk so gave this a shot. Baked in a 8 x 8 pan for 45 minutes and then cut into squares. Very simple, light flavor. I added nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice. Thank you.

This recipe needs some seasoning - I added 3/4 tsp salt, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla. I also made some changes based on what i had on hand. I used 1c. whole milk with 1 T white vinegar in place of the buttermilk and all purpose flour in place of the whole wheat flour if you don't have it. I rarely have those ingredients on hand but it worked wonderfully with my substitutions. The all purpose flour lacks the nutrition of the whole wheat but it also makes them light and fluffy. Because my applesauce had no sugar added I added a little extra brown sugar (1 heaping 1/2 c scoop). The were yummy served warm with butter and some honey. Delightful! *Also they only need 20-25 minutes in the oven. Not 30!

Yum! They're a little on the dense side but nonetheless very delicious. I did not soak the oats for 2 hours, in fact I only soaked them for about 1/5 hour because I boiled my milk, which was sour milk prior to adding the oats. That worked really well and then I didn't have to have the patience to wait 2 hours! :)

These turned out amazing! I made 2 changes. I used non fat milk instead of buttermilk because I didn't have any on hand and I also added 2 tsp ground cinnamon. I also only cooked them for 20 minutes total. They are absolutely delicious!

Delicious and good for you. What more can you ask for? Made as written (using 1% buttermilk), these turned out moist (but not 'too' moist), flavorful, and rose very nicely.  I added a cup of fresh blueberries and mango to the batter, so I also put in a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg as a complement to the fruit. I also topped with a little crumb topping just for fun. Took this recipe to the next level. I will make these often, and look forward to trying other variations with this great, basic recipe. Thank you for sharing it.

I'll admit I had my doubts when I saw the batter, BUT these turned out awesome!  I only soaked the oats for about 30 minutes in my bath and they were great.  They were better when I let them sit overnight.  The kids ate them up and they are full of fiber and fruit!

Excellent muffins! Very moist and soft and flavorful with the following modifications: Add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon; 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg; 1/2 teaspoon salt; 1 teaspoon vanilla and one diced apple. Healthy and a hit for my whole family. Stays soft for a while but best hot right from the oven.

Made these delicious muffins dairy and sugar free!  I used 1/2 c. honey instead of brown sugar, perfect sweetness! I used white whole wheat flour(just as healthy and same fiber as whole wheat). I added 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp allspice, and 2 tsps cinnamon to the dry ingredience! Instead of buttermilk I used almond milk with one TBS lemon juice in it(let sit for a couple minutes).  The oats and milk sat for only a few minutes and I zapped them in the microwave for 20 secs to make room tep. Mixed all together and baked for only 20 mins. (30 mins must be way too long?) and WALA!!! Note: for company, I might add a ripe mashed banana or more honey for a sweeter taste!

these are pretty good. I used fat free milk then soured it and i used white sugar since that's all i had. I only used about 3 or 4 tbs I can't remember. I used cinnamon applesauce since that's what i had and added 1/2tsp of cinnamon. I added some raisins about 1/2 cup.

These are some of the best low fat muffins I've ever tried - the texture isn't rubbery like some applesauce breads I've made.  I added vanilla and cinnamon but it would have been just fine without.  I don't like super sweet, so it was perfect!

I was looking for a recipe I could use to onhand ingredients that needed using up.  This recipe is really good.  I didn't soak my oats as long as the recipe called for simply because I was in hurry and I also like the oaty texture.  I used cinnamon applesauce and added some vanilla to the buttermilk/oat mixture.  I also added some extra cinnamon.  I didn't have two eggs so I just added the 1 I had and added an extra 1/2 cup of applesauce.  I am not too unhappy with my results.  The "skin" is a little tougher and they didn't rise very well.  But that was my errors not the recipe.  The flavor is good.  I think adding some chopped up apple would really bring these muffins to life.  I was hoping for more apple flavor, but again that was baker error not recipe.  Overall I think this is a great recipe.  My children claim they are good and my 4 year old just ate two without butter, so I am pretty confident we will make these again.


Ok remade recipe and I realized I misread my measuring spoons on the baking soda so that may have attributed to the tough skin.  Recipe was much better after I soaked the oats for the two hours and used two eggs this was great.  I also decreased the cook time and don't worry about overfilling the cups as they don't over rise.  AWESOME!!!!!

Healthy but not very tasty. I made them last night with the alterations of adding vanilla and cinnamon. They are not very sweet, the texture resembled a very moist carrot muffin but I guess at a hundred cal a muffin, its a pretty good deal.  To add more sweetness I just iced it with Nutella.

So good! I made mine with white flour since I don't have wheat flour in the house, but I'll try that as soon as I get some. Also, if you use a 1/4 cup measuring cup as your scoop it makes exactly as many muffins as it says it will. My 3 year old and husband loved these! What a great recipe!

These muffins hit the spot!  I did use water instead of buttermilk, and soaked the oats while I mixed the other ingredients...no longer. A dense, satisfying oatmeal muffing...not too sweet, and a hit with the family...now a breakfast regular!

These came out nice, with a little tweaking after I read the reviews here.  I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla.  I also used half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  My bag of brown sugar was almost empty, so I ended up using 1/4 of brown and 1/4 cup of white.  They baked to perfection in 18 minutes, much shorter than the stated time of 30 minutes.  The muffins weren't too sweet but had a nice flavor from the cinnamon and apples.  My kids liked them and ate two each for their afternoon snack.   I'm sure I'll make this again since the kids enjoyed it.  Thanks!

I get that these are supposed to be a healthy and nonfat muffin but they are very very bland.  No flavor!  I even added vanilla and cinnamon based on reviews but still these leave a lot to be desired.  They are not sweet in the slightest and I think they need at least a little fat-some oil or butter.  I'm hoping they improve when they sit a bit.  I made them because I was out of butter and oil and needed something to have for the kids for breakfast and this fit the bill since it doesn't need any oil/butter.  2 stars because they are edible but I won't be giving them another try.  One redeeming quality is that I like the flavor of the oats in them.

These  muffins were disappointing but the recipe probably has potential.  The muffins stuck terribly to the paper and were incredibly bland.  If it had not been for the brown sugar topping and raisins that I added, they would have had little flavor at all.  I will try them again adding salt, more spices, and substituting half the flour with conventional white flour.  I will, again, add the brown sugar crumb topping.  That being said, they will get eaten (kids are happy with any baked good) and will be a healthy way to satisfy a morning sweet tooth with coffee.

I totally forgot I had made these before!!  This time I followed everything to a "T", except for the spices (1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp pie spice and 1 tbsp vanilla) and added raisins.  So far too hot to really enjoy, but found the middle wet, even though they were well cooked.  Can tell its missing some of the fat, by the outside texture.  But the flavor so far is really good, and super easy.

I soaked the oats for only 20-30 minutes while I prepared the ingredients. I also added 2 chopped small apples to the batter and increased the volume substantially. I got 12 generously sized muffins as a result. The muffins themselves were perfectly smooth (especially compared to bran muffins I've been eating) and very, very good. However, these are not very filling because they are so light. I would use some kind of fiber (maybe bran instead of flour?) to up the substance in these muffins for breakfast. Otherwise, great snack or pick-me-up throughout the day.

i added chopped apples to mine but otherwise followed the directions completely and they baked lovely with a nice golden brown top, however, my grandparents gave them horrible reviews and actually threw them out! saying that they were too chewy and not good at all. but my mom and i thought they werent THAT bad. i think they needed a little more spice...cinnamon maybe. and the chewiness i think came from the amount of soak time of the oats with the buttermilk and the addition of applesauce after that. this is definitely a hit or miss recipe. but one i will not be keeping.

These were great, I took other reviewer's advice and added some spices (cinnamon, vanilla, salt). I also chopped up 4 pink lady apples, sprinkled them with brown sugar and cinnamon and baked them at 375 for about 15 minutes, then added these to the muffin batter.

These muffins came out quite good and I would make them again. I doubled the recipe so I'd have extra to freeze. I added dried cranberries, pumpkin pie spice and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top. They got two thumbs up from my kids.

I liked that this recipe was really quick & easy, but I did think the taste was bland.  However, I think it's worth another try with kittycondo's recommendation of chopped apple and spices, and salt.

Not really what I was expecting.  It was too sweet, and the texture was a little chewy.  I'd prefer something softer.  I added a little vanilla and salt as others suggested and added some blueberries, but this shouldn't have changed the flavor/texture too much.  I will keep looking for another recipe.

love this recipe! I just made a batch (tripled the recipe) and they were awesome! I made a couple of changes.  Used homemade applebutter in place of the applesauce, added some ground flax and added raisins.  Definitely going to be making these on a regular basis.

These were VERY good.  Moist and chewy and not too sweet.  I used a 6oz. plain yogurt cup with a little less than 1/4 cup water with 1 Tbs dry milk(I was out of milk) as well as a little lemon juice.  I added 1/2 tsp salt, 3/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I only baked them for 20 minutes, as I saw that other people baked them for shorter times, but I'm sure they would have been ok for more.  Blueberries, banana bits, or apple pieces would be delicious in them.

I did this without the two hour soak, thinking it would add some good texture.  I don't recommend it. It needs the soak to soften the oats. But I did use a multigrain oatmeal. A little on the bland side and I even added 2 teaspoons cinnamon.

I'm going to go ahead and give this 5 stars.  I was pleasantly surprised.  These muffins are really tasty and the texture is fantastic.  I read most of the reviews and added raisins and sultanas and pumpkin pie spice. Even if I didn't add the extra ingredients this recipe as is would have been a 4.5 star.  Perfect mid morning snack for adults and a perfect breakfast (teamed with a smoothie/milkshake) for preschoolers who are far too busy to sit down and eat their breakfast!

This is my first-ever review on allrecipes.com, although I've been using recipes off of here for years. I felt compelled to comment on these muffins because they are SUPERB! They are dense, yet extremely moist, and very healthy! Thank you for a great recipe!

I just pulled mine out of the oven, and they're very good. 

I used Wild oats and Homo milk as I didn't have the others on hand, and I added a dash of cinnamon and Mexican vanilla, but I followed the baking instructions exactly.  

They are very moist and tasty.

These are delicious!  My sister made a batch using quinoa flakes instead of oats.  She also added some apple pieces and raisins.  Turned out delicious!  Nice and sweet, with great texture :)

These got the seal of approval at my house! I used non-fat vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk!

Ehh...these are only fair.  They're a bit bland and just not all that wonderful of a flavor.  Even so, I would eat them if they were served and would still enjoy them.

Thank you! Thank you, for this recipe!! They are fabulous, I even posted my own photo of the finished result!! I substituted 1 cup fat-free Stonybrook Farms organic yogurt b/c I didn't have buttermilk, and I added 1/3 cup date crystals to the oat/yogurt mixture to soak with the oats, and some grated nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Also, 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  These were sooooo good!! My three year old loved them!!  The date crystals I got from a friend of mine, who gets them from CA, from the Shield's Date Farm, they have a website where you can order the date crystals.  I don't know why, but they just add something special to muffins, it's soooo great!! Try it!

If you are looking for a healthy breakfast, these are great! I make them with regular milk and I only soaked the oats for about 30 minutes, but they turned out very good.

These were very good, with the added cinnamon suggested by others.  I used 1 tsp cinnamon for 12 muffins.  I didn't find a need to soak the oatmeal at all beforehand, and they turned out great.  1st batch I used buttermilk and they were really good.  I didn't have any left for the batch the next day and used 2 % milk......they weren't quite as good as they were with the buttermilk.

These were a lot better than I had hoped. I used 2 percent milk and quick oats. We tried the first batch and made many more batches to freeze as a quick breakfast or snack. I added ground flax to all, some of the batches i added frozen blueberries (thawed), chopped apple, dried cranberries, cinnimon, and walnuts. We also added mini chocolate chips to some per the kids request. Excellent recipe. They are soo good and good for you to!

Probably won't make these again, since they were kind of bland.  I think they need some cinnamon or something.  Also, they were done at 20 minutes.  I have read that it is important not to overcook lowfat items.  If you use muffin liners, don't try to take them off until the muffins are completely cooled.

These were the best muffins I've made in a long time. They're very moist and taste  delicious. I added a very ripe, mashed-up banana, some cinnamon and nutmeg and 40gr of chopped raisins. I also cut down on the sugar a bit since the banana and raisins make it sweet enough I think. A wonderful treat and still very healthy! Thanks for this recipe!

Very good breakfast muffins! I added a handful chopped dates and raisins and used soy milk + lemon instead of buttermilk.

I substituted 1/2 cup Raisin Bran Crunch instead of the full cup of oats and added a few extra raisins. I also substituted skim milk for buttermilk.  It turned out great!

Pretty bland.  Great filled up with prunes!  Followed recipe with modifications:
*  Added 4 tbsp ground flax seed
*  Used sweetened applesauce (and still didn't turn out sweet...)
*  Tried various fruit additions:  chopped prunes, crushed pineapple, chopped dried apricots, raisins

OK, Next I tried another batch with following modifications:
* No sugar (drizzled on a dallop of honey onto each muffin cup  before placing into oven
* Microwaved an apple until soft instead of applesauce
* added 1/3 cup of ground flax seed
* instead of soaking oats, microwaved them with a cup of water
* no buttermilk
* added 1/2 cup water to make mixture more runny
* added Lots more prunes

I didn't change any ingredients and they tasted great! Especially hot out of the oven w/unsalted butter melted on each half!  My muffins were done in 18 minutes and are still moist and yummy the next day.

This is a great recipe.  I'm trying to gain healthy weight, so I added 1/4 c melted butter and 3 T wheat germ.  For added flavor I added vanilla extract, cinnamin,nutmeg,and cloves.  After it was in the oven, I thought about next time I will add some peeled carrot and walnuts.

This is a healthy, filling muffin, but it's on the bland side. I had already added salt, vanilla and some flax meal, but next time I would throw in some chopped fruit and nuts to make this interesting to eat.

These are excellent!  I added a green apple and a 1/3 cup dried cranberries.  I also added some cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.  I soaked the oats in buttermilk overnight, and I made jumbo size muffins (six large muffins) instead of twelve which came out perfectly.  I love that they taste good and are also good for you!

These muffins are yummy, mild tasting, filling and healthy...definitely a good sidekick for a latte!  I understand what other reviewers say when they 'lack flavour' but I quite enjoy it; they're not bland at all, just mild.  I followed suggestions to add spices (1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of cinnamon) and also added about 5 tbsp of ground flaxseed.  I couldn't help but sprinkle a bit of cinnamon sugar on top too, and ate one right out of the oven...wonderfully moist and chewy!
I only cooked them for 25 minutes and made 10 muffins instead of 12 because my muffin tin makes really wide muffins. Next time I'll add a few raisins and walnuts...

Thank you for such a healthy, easy recipe!

As written, these muffins would be SO bland! I followed the recommendations of others and added 1t. vanilla, 2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. cloves, and 1/2 t. salt, and it was still pretty blah. With these additions, my kids didn't mind them, but they'll eat almost anything if you call it a muffin.

I took a lot of advice from other reviewers & added 1 tsp cinnamon but next time I'll add 2 tsp! I used a lite cinnamon applesauce & Eggbeaters. I thought about adding some Splenda but I didn't but will consider that for next time as I really think these need a little more flavor! But the texture was great & were mildly sweet. They're so healthy & versatile-I think I'll add some chopped apples & vanilla next time. They're certainly worth experimenting with!

I used large baking oats and white sugar because that is what I had on hand.
I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. all spice as recommended by other reviewers.
Th flavour was nice, but the texture was way off.  I used greased/floured pans and when the muffin was golden on the outside its was still thick and gooey on the inside.  
I will keep looking for a great lowfat recipe.

Excellent Muffin recipe!  My kids love it.  There is not an overpowering Apple taste.  I added cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and ground flax seed to give a little more flavor and health benefit.  Very healthy and good tasting.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a great breakfast treat or sweet healthy treat!!!

These muffins were pretty good but not fabulous.  The buttermilk gave the muffins a nice flavor, but the 2-hour wait was frustrating, and the muffins came out rather dense.  I added some cinnamon and raisins that for more flavor, and I recommend those additions.  Personally, I liked the "Apple Bran Muffin" allrecipe much better, but these aren't bad!

These are an excellent way to sneak some nutrition into my family's day!  I added 1/2 cup of wheat germ and about 1/2 cup of raisins; I also threw in some nutmeg and cinnamon and increased the brown sugar to 3/4 cup.   I did have to decrease the baking time by about 5 minutes, and found that these don't rise a huge amount, so you can fill the muffin cups more than 3/4 full.  I'm making these again today and, instead of applesauce, I'm using the pulp from fresh pears, apples, and carrots that was left over after making juice in my juicer.

These muffins turned out pretty good. I used 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour. I also increased the sugar to 2/3 cup--this turned out to be the perfect amount. Try baking these for 25 minutes first, because it took mine less than 30 minutes to bake. Will make again.

Pretty good. To be more specific, I'd say like a 6.5-7/10. Flavor is subdued compared to most other muffins, but the flavor they due have is very good, remeniscient of bran muffins. I used homemade applesauce for the recipe, which made the texture and flavor both much better (and now pumpkin muffins with ripe pumpkin is absolutely on my bucket list). I added spices and vanilla as other reviews suggested, and used quick oats, which I only soaked for like 20 minutes. That actually turned out totally fine. I didn't have buttermilk, so I just used milk. In retropsect, I should've added vegetable oil to increase lubricance, but I totally blanked on it, so they clung to their papers for dear life, which resulted in me and my family all consuming excess amounts of paper the day I made them. Took way longer to make than my go-to blueberry oat muffins, and while I'll probably stick to those as my usual choice, I'll definitely come back to this, especially when next harvest season rolls around and I get to have fresh applesauce again. I'll definitely try adding more applesauce to the batter, though, and possibly more brown sugar.

Wow, this was awesome!! My modifications:  didn’t have buttermilk so made my own (2 Tbsp. lemon juice mixed into 1 C 2% milk, let sit for @ 5 mins); allowed oats and buttermilk to sit @ 1 hour versus 2 hours (didn’t have the time!); used light brown sugar; the rest was as listed. Hubs, who LOVES all things sugary said he wanted to eat the entire pan! This is HUGE for me! If I can get something healthy into this man, I’m doing it. I’m currently making a second batch. 5 stars, y’all!!

We liked these a lot.  Didn’t have wheat flour so used white flour.  They still tasted healthy with the oats in them.  A little crunch.  I will make them again.  Very easy, but don’t forget the 2 hour soak.  Was going to have them at dinner, but they were good the next morning for breakfast.

These muffins were wonderful. Liked that they weren’t too sweet. Used quick oats and milk with lemon instead of buttermilk. Also added cinnamon, vanilla and finely chopped apples as other viewers suggested.  Next time will add raisins or dried cranberries. Definitely a keeper!

Instead of 1 cup buttermilk, I used 1 cup vanilla soy milk combined with 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar. Because of the sweetness of the soy milk, I used 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup brown sugar. The muffins were very easy to make, and while not bursting in flavor, were  pretty tasty.

I really liked this recipe! The only change I made was using strawberry applesauce for a bit more flavor, and I used quick oats soaked for about an hour because they were what I had on hand. That meant the oats weren't super heavy in the final product, but I preferred them that way. Overall, they made a tasty and healthier breakfast or snack option!

These are very good.  They smell incredibly apple-y but don't taste overly like apples.  They sure as heck don't need to bake for 30 minutes though.  12-15 minutes is sufficient.

Love that I finally found an easy, healthy muffin recipe. I made a few adjustments in order to make them vegan, and they turned out great! Here are the adjustments I made.
1. Mix 1 Tbsp of Lemon juice with enough almond milk to make one cup and let sit for about 5 min (this replaces the buttermilk)
2. Mash 1 small banana (you need a 1/4 cup mashed) and add a pinch of extra baking powder. (this replaces the one egg)
3. I also added pumpkin pie spice and a pinch of salt to the dry ingredients for extra flavour.
Followed the rest of the recipe exactly as directed. Will make again!

These were pretty good for more healthy muffins, but I think next time I'll give them more of a flavour boost. More spices & maybe some apple bits or cranberries would be nice.

These really don't have much flavor.  After tasting the batter I added cinnamon, nutmeg, a pinch of cardamom and pecans.  Better, but still not too exciting.

I decided to make these at the last minute & didn't want to wait for oats & buttermilk to set. Decided to experiment since I was using powereded buttermilk. Put oats & 1 cup water in microwave for 1 minute. Let cool a couple of minutes, then added rest of ingredients (including powdered buttermilk). Also added raisins because we love them. The results were moist & yummy.

Made this for a work gathering.  It was a huge hit with the children of my coworkers.  One adult said "don't tell them it is healthy or they will stop eating it".  The child took the leftovers home.

8 16 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/25209/oat-applesauce-muffins/ ... So surprised.  I thought these would be "brown," healthy tasting, as in not eaten.  They're not.  They're just good.   'Used dark brown sugar & unsweetened applesauce.    Mine didn't roundup like the photo, but I used dry buttermilk & water so maybe that's to blame.  'Still taste good!  Oh, I sprayed the paper liners.  First time, but they came out fine.  I also added a T or two of oil to the batter.  A few oats top would be nice, improve appearance.  I'll make these again.  :)

These are awesome! Used as many of the reviews suggestions as possible and these are now a breakie or snack favorite. I wrapped them individually and frozen them for work breakfast and lunches and they were delicious. Suggestions from reviews that I incorporated are: soaked for an hour in homemade butter milk, added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tbsp maple syrup (not pancake syrup) and increased the applesauce to 3/4 cup. Add whatever fruit I want depending on what I have in the pantry. :) These are super filling.

These are great considering how few calories they have! I accidentally made mine vegan since I was out of milk and eggs (subbed in cashew milk + vinegar for the buttermilk and 3 T aquafaba for the egg), and they were still good. I did add in some pumpkin pie spice, vanilla, and a pinch of salt to boost the flavor. They're pretty obviously "healthy," but still yummy.

These are a great lite snack, very easy and quick to make.  I only had all purpose flour on hand so I used that instead of the wheat. I also added 1 small chopped (skin removed) Apple to the flour mixture, 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla. I actually got 15 muffins which only took 18 minutes to bake. Overall, these muffins are rather bland but my kids seem to like them and they are healthy.

These are really good! I just used quick oats and soaked them in the buttermilk (2% milk with a tbsp. of vinegar added) while I was getting the rest of the ingredients ready. Tip: DO NOT USE PAPER MUFFIN CUPS. My daughter wanted to use them and the muffins stuck to the paper, we lost half of the muffin trying to get them out of the paper. Follow the instructions and just grease the muffin tin.

Really delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except put in slightly less sugar, and i only had white sugar so i added a bit of molasses. Next time i think i would add a little cinnamon and apple chunks for extra flavor. Would definitely make them again!

I've made this twice.  The first time as written except that I didn't have buttermilk so I used yogurt and I added some spices to pep it up a bit.  Good, but tasted healthy and I didn't love the texture.  :-)  Second time I doubled the recipe but used 3 eggs and instead of all applesauce I used 6 oz applesauce and half a cup of coconut oil.  I beat the coconut oil and eggs first, then mixed in the applesauce, then the yogurt/buttermilk/oats mixture then all the dry ingredients.  For spice in this double batch I used 2 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg and about 1/2 each ginger and salt.  I also threw in about a cup of mixed dried berries.  For me, the huge improvement in texture is worth the little bit of oil since these are so healthy otherwise.

These are the perfect base recipe for healthy oatmeal muffins!  I have a similar recipe that uses 1/2cup of melted butter instead of the applesauce so I thought I'd give this my spin.  I used quick oats but didn't soak them because I like the oat texture (plus my similar recipe didn't soak the oats so I knew it would be fine)I did take the advice of others and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and for extra flavor, I added in a heaping tablespoon of apple butter as part of the applesauce called for.  I also added 2 tbsp.'s of melted butter just to give it a little fat-boost!  Perfect sweetness and very satisfying as a grab and go breakfast.  Will make again!

I've made so many variations of this I've lost count! Instead of buttermilk I use 2 T plain yogurt mixed with milk to make the amount needed. I add 1 1/2 t vanilla extract and spices to the oatmeal - today I used 1/4 t cardamom, 1/2 t cinnamon and 1/4 t nutmeg. After it soaks about 1 hr I add the rest of my wet ingredients, INCLUDING the brown sugar and 1 T EVOO (I like Goya). I've added chocolate chips and raisins to different batches and made them plain, too. I make these as large muffins so I only get 6, which is perfect for my teenage daughter's breakfast for a week.

Great healthy muffin.  I took previous advice & added 1 tsp vanilla & 1 tsp cinnamon.  I also only let the oatmeal soak for as long as it took me to get the dry ingredients together, as I wanted the oat texture to show up in the muffin.  I made 2 batches & added blueberries to one & left 1 plain.  My tip... use cooking spray, even if you are using muffin cups.  Also, they stick less to the muffin cups if you let them cool over night.  I will definitely save this recipe and use it over & over again.

Very tasty! I was concerned that they'd taste too 'healthy,' but they actually have great flavor and a nice texture. I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, and only let the oats soak in the buttermilk while I mixed up the other ingredients and preheated the oven (maybe 15 minutes total soak?)--this probably kept more of that 'oaty' texture, which I like! I think 30 minutes for the bake time is a tad too long, though. They were a bit dry and hard on the bottoms at 30 minutes; I made a second time and baked 20 minutes which seemed to be perfect.

This is a good starting point, but without some alterations, it was a little too bland for my taste.  Also, it really needed some oil to keep the muffins from sticking to the wrappers. I used chunky applesauce, and threw in some raisons and cinnamon.  After the first batch, when I realized how badly they stuck to the wrapper, I added a little olive oil to remaining batter, and those turned out great!

I heated the buttermilk and oatmeal over low heat on the stove, kinda looked like cooked oatmeal when I added it to the other ingredients. Also added cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, salt. Sprinkled cinnamon-sugar over the top before baking. Very very good!

Great recipe even though I did do some tweaking. Used one tablespoon apple cider vinegar in the one cup of milk. Added one teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon allspice for a little extra flavor.  Also added 1/2 teaspoon salt, one teaspoon vanilla, a small chopped apple and some chopped walnuts.  I only soaked the oats about 20 minutes.  Wow, these are so delicious. You can do so much with this recipe, almost like the Easy Oatmeal Muffins without the oil.

I guess I got what I expected from these, they are a "healthy" muffin. I don't know that I'd make them again.  I soaked the old fashioned rolled oats in the buttermilk for about 3 hours while I did errands.  My only change in the recipe was adding some diced dried apple bits along with about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and a little turbinado sugar on the tops.  The muffins did not rise at all, they stayed perfectly flat in the muffin tins.  Can't blame my baking powder because I opened a brand new one for this recipe.

I have used this recipe many times. I use 1/4 cup of honey in place of the brown sugar and occasionally, I add raisins, a bit of chopped fresh or dried fruit, or cinnamon, nutmeg and a pinch of cloves. I also add: 1 tsp Vanilla extract to the recipe whenever I make it.  The muffins are great every time!  My husband and I love them and, when our grown daughter and grandson were visiting, she asked for my recpe--a rare thing!  These make GREAT "on-the-run" breakfast muffins!

Good muffins.  I didn't want to soak rolled oats so I added instant oats to the dry ingredients and the texture turned out just fine.  I also used cinnamon applesauce instead of plain, but felt they could use just a touch more cinnamon too. You can taste the apple but it's not overpowering. The muffins taste much like apple cinnamon oatmeal.

These were great. I did like other reviewers mentioned and made buttermilk with vinegar and skim milk, added cinnamon and vanilla as well as chopped up a stalk of rhubarb from the garden. I made them as mini-muffins. I love that they have no oil, just the applesauce. My kids loved them and I loved them. Going to make them often.

Will only rate because I followed this recipe to the letter.
I only came out with 9 muffins instead of 12. Although good, they could be a little sweeter. They tasted good warm from the oven with butter.

This is yummy and healthy!  I like to double it and freeze them for fast breakfasts...they are not that sweet.  I used quick oats and only soak it in the buttermilk for 10 minutes.

I followed the advice of previous reviews and added some salt, cinnamon and vanilla for flavor. I also added some wheat germ for added vitamins and fiber (about 2 tbl). I let the oats soak in reduced fat buttermilk for just over an hour. I used mini-muffin tins and they came out pretty good. They were a little bland, and I definitely plan on adding chunks of apple next time to boost the flavor even more. I use homemade applesauce, so it should be easy to leave it chunky instead of processing it in a food processor. Overall, these are yummy and very good for you.

I always want to eat healthy muffins for breakfast but have never found a muffin recipe that has enough moisture and flavor for my tastes. I have now!! Even my kids liked them, at 16, 15, 1. Hubby did not like them as much as I did but he sure ate his share.

These are good for a healthy snack. I wouldn't serve them to guests but they are healthy and I don't feel bad eating them. I add little pieces of apple as well as some cinnamon. Used quick cut oats and didn't have to soak.

As written this recipe should probably get 3 stars but I am giving it 4 because there is so much potential.  Also, for only having a little over 1 gram of fat per serving I guess I did not think they were going to be to die for.  I did not read the reviews before I made the muffins and thought they were kind of bland.  I will try adding some splenda like others suggested. Also, you do need to wait until the muffins are completely cool before trying to remove the liners because they stick really bad.  I thought the baking time was a little long but also a reminder (because I forget this alot), if you use a dark coated muffin pan decrease the baking temperature to 350.

Good recipe.  Low cal and low fat!  I added about a cup of chopped apples, and used an egg white instead of an egg to lower the cholesteol content. You may want to add a packet of Equal to sweeten up the muffins...otherwise they are a bit bland.  NOTE:  If you choose to add a cup of apples to the recipe, avoid storing them in ziplock baggies...the muffins become overly-moist.

These are good for a healthy low-fat muffin and I would make them again, just based off of that.  I added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, instead of applesauce I used pumpkin butter, and instead of buttermilk I used milk and 1 tsp vinegar.  I also didn't have much time in the morning so my oats and milked soaked overnight in the fridge. I only cooked for 20 minutes and they were done.  Good for healthy!

I love these muffins.  I fill the muffin cups half full and add 1 teaspoon of allfruit in the center.  Then I spoon a bit more batter on top.  My kids LOVE these muffins and I make them often because they are so healthy!

I doubled the recipe and added cinnamin, wheat germ and an apple. The doubled recipe made 24 regular size muffins and 12 mini's. The kids LOVED these! We adults enjoyed them too.

These are pretty good. I used whole wheat flour instead of regular and added cinnamon. Next time I may add some nuts or chopped fruit.

the recipe by itself, even with some spices added for flavor, was a little blah.  but i subbed fat free flavored yogurt (after subbing plain yogurt for the buttermilk) and added some raisins and coconut to the last batch i made, and they are SO good.  i made them sunday and finished them today.  didn't mean to, but then, maybe i did.  ;)

After reading the reviews that suggested the muffins were a little bland, I decided to add 1/4 c brown sugar, and 1 tsp of cinnamon, and some chopped pear.  They were ok, but these stuck a little to the muffin papers, even when cooled, and just leave something to be desired.  Good, but not great, is my overall evaluation.

This is a great recipe for a healthy muffin.  I added one chopped apple and 2/3 cup of dried cranberries.  The muffins were very moist despite not using any oil.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

I thought they were excellent for a healthy muffin.  I made these in a mini size for my son's first birthday party and froze the leftovers, which we both enjoyed very much when heated.

These are okay but not great.  Raisins, dates, walnuts, and cinnamon help.  I think I will try to 'perfect' these to my own liking.  I like that I don't feel guilty eating them though!!! The second time I made them I used wheat bran for 1/2 cup flour, and added milled flax seed and wheat germ.  Maybe I'll try adding honey instead of brown sugar?

Tasty for a healthy muffin.  I added a few generous dashed of cinnamon and next time I might add allspice or even pumpkin pie spice.  Texture is a little chewy, but moist for such low-fat, low-cal muffin.

These muffins were very hearty. I made a double batch and put about 1 tbsp of vanilla extract, lots of cinnamon, pinch of ginger and cloves and about 1/4 cup white sugar in these. My 4 year old liked them so that is a compliment as she is very picky. I also added some flax seeds like some other users and that was a nice touch. They would be good with ripe bananas too!

My playgroup made these disappear - Moms and kids!  I soaked the oats at room temp and left them in the fridge overnight covered with plastic.  This made early morning prep much easier.  I did add a tsp of cinnamon and a few grinds of nutmeg as suggested and everyone loved them.  I used unsweetened applesauce this time and will try a fruit applesauce next time.  Wonderful!
