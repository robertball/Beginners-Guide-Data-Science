I LOVED THIS!  Modified it though.  I don't like Italian, so I marinade it in lemon juice and Jamaican jerk and scrapped the bacon.  Too much fat!  Also, baked in a pan coated with olive oil at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.  Good good stuff!

We make this recipe but in a much different way...as an appetizer....and it is wonderful!!  It gets gobbled up quickly for football games and cookouts. You will need considerably more jalapeno peppers..deseeded of course.  
Cut the chicken into much smaller strips.  Fill the jalapeno with the cream cheese (you can almost cut it with a knife off the block) put the smaller chicken strip on top of the cream cheese and wrap a slice of bacon around your jalapeno, cream cheese, and chicken.  Then cook on the grill for a great appetizer...Yummy

Wonderful recipe!  I made this at a family cookout and it was a hit.  Used the jalepenos in a jar so they were very juicy, but not too spicy.  Now I crave this every time we barbeque!

This recipe was great!  I used 2 slices of bacon to wrap each chicken breast, one length-wise and one width-wise, to keep the cream cheese from melting out.  I would recommend NOT using thick-cut bacon if you like your bacon crispy.  It was really easy, too!

YUM YUM and YUM!  Loved this!  I marinated it in italian dressing, but i think it would be really good to do a margarita marinade.  This recipe is a keeper!  It would also make a really great appetizer by scaling down the sizes.

This is a nice something different!  I mixed my 1/3 less fat cream cheese w/some 2% shredded cheddar for a little extra in the middle.  My peppers weren't all that spicy, but this was a nice dish.  I did have to use more bacon than called for the wrap the chicken (I was afraid the cheeses would ooze out).  TY!

I just love this recipe (wrapping anything in bacon appeals wildly to me). I use a whole jalapeno, split and seed it, stuff with cream cheese and then reassemble. Never thought of using salad dressing to marinate before--it feels like cheating, but it sure turns out well and the results are great. Add some bagels to your shopping list and you can use the leftover bacon and cream cheese for, well, cream cheese and bacon bagels...mmmmmmmm.

I thought these were excellent.  My husband and kids removed the jalapeno after cooking and enjoyed them like that.  I'll keep making these!  Thanks.

I thought this was an AWESOME recipe! I fine tuned it using all the reviews and I think I made it perfect! First, I did grill the peppers before I put them in the chicken and I stuffed them with chedder cheese, I despise cream cheese. Also, I made homeade italian dressing (the kind that comes in the seasoning packet that you mix with oil and vinegar) that gave it a very robust flavor. Then when I marinated it I threw in some fresh diced garlic, basil and parsly. It gave it A LOT of flavor. The bacon is a must, it adds a nice flavor and really holds it together during cooking (the secret to keeping the chicken in one piece is to put the bundles of chicken packed TIGHT on a HOT grill and leave for 5 mins before turning, then lower the heat)I liked this a lot, I served it with corn and herb potatoes, definately a keeper!

Not your everyday chicken breast... this one stands WAY out amongst the crowd. The flavor of the bacon with the chicken, jalapeno & cheese blends together AMAZINGLY! I double wrapped each chicken breast with 2 strips of bacon; one length wise and another across the middle, in an attempt to keep the cream cheese from melting out. It worked out somewhat, but I will fool with it next time to get a more cheesy taste. Maybe sprinkle some shredded pepper jack cheese on top for 5 minutes before they're done??? 
DEFINITELY pre-cook your bacon a little if you want it cooked all the way through. Hubby and I both really liked this... I can't wait to make it again!

Pretty tasty! For those of you who have never deseeded jalapeno peppers [like me], wear gloves. My hands were ON FIRE for 12 hours.

the concept is good but I need to make adjustments for next time.
-1- i will skip the bacon- i dont think it added any flavor or value to the recipe. -2- i will use low fat cream cheese -3- i will dip the rolled chicken in egg and breadcrumbs then bake in the oven (and skip the bbq)
-4- i will grill the jalapenos themselves first before stuffing in the chicken

---the italian dressing marinade part left the chicken tasteless it needed more marinating..and the jalapeno was too spicy- needed to be cooked before putting inside the chicken. with some tweaking this could be fantastic- the chicken, jalapeno and cream cheese could be a great combination.

Was disappointed with this recipe.  It took a bit of time and was looking forward to it but overall for all the time it took was not worth the effort.

Super yummy. Let my chicken sit in the italian dressing over night. Cooked in the oven at 400 for 20 to 25 mintues.

Made this about an hour ago and wish I'd made twice as many. David kept saying "Ummm, delicious".  I used canned pickled jalapenos, seed, membranes removed.  I used string cheese because it's easier (to me) than cream cheese. I wrapped with 3 pieces bacon per breast and cooked in skillet on stove.  Even with the very minor changes, this is a 5 star because it ALLOWED the changes but still kept the integrity of the recipe.  This might be a bit warm for kiddos but the heat of the canned peppers dissapated quickly in the mouth (not the lingering burning). Thanks Christi

Made this last night with the following changes. I precooked my bacon in the oven on 375 for 15 minutes. I also put my jalapenos in the microwave for 2 minutes before deseeding them to make sure they would be soft enough. I also pounded out my chicken and cut them into strips before cooking. I didnt have time to marinate so I used BBQ shake and bake on the chicken and it was good..I also added shredded cheddar to the cream cheese. I took the cooked bacon down, then chicken, the jalapeno and rolled them up and secured with toothpicks. Really good!

This really is a quick and tasty way to prepare chicken. I made it tonight for my daughter's birthday dinner and everyone loved it. I baked it at 350 for 40 minutes and then turned the heat up to 400 and baked it 10 minutes longer to crisp up the bacon. Based on other reviews, I used 2 strips of bacon. I look forward to trying it grilled because I'm sure that will bring out more flavor, but not until this cold weather goes away!

This..was..delicious!  I didn't change the ingredients, but instead I changed how they were used.  I marinated the chicken all day in Italian dressing like the recipe called for, but then combined the cream cheese, cooked/crumbled bacon, and sliced jalapeños together and spread it on the chicken breasts.  I rolled them and grilled to get a nice char, then finished them in the oven.  WOW!  You could do so many different combinations with the cream cheese.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was good but I used cheddar cheese instead of cream cheese since we have never liked that with our poppers. Next time I will include a bit more cheese and maybe use thicker bacon. I may also look altering the dressing or just using a good rub. Good recipe that can be modifier to one's taste.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  The only change I made was to add cheddar cheese to the cream cheese and a little salt and pepper. I also found that cutting a small pocket in the breasts (from the side) and stuffing in the popper was much more functional than pounding out the chicken. Next time I will skip the marinating step as it didn't bring much flavor to the party. We may consider using a mesquite flavor marinade next time, but there will definitely be a next time! I served this with jalapeno cornbread muffins.

I think the flavor in this is amazing, but I think the method could be MUCH easier. I butterflied my chicken breasts until they were open, but not cut completely apart and roasted my peppers first, then spread cream cheese on the breast, added the roasted peppers and closed them back up. So much easier than rolling them around peppers. I added turkey bacon, but probably won't bother with it next time...the true flavor was in the chicken and peppers and cheese. However, if you're a big bacon fan (we're not) you probably won't want to skip that step. I didn't have any issues with my cream cheese leaking and I didn't use toothpicks at all. Again, the flavor here is 5-star, but the method leaves a lot to be desired.

I didn't end up marinating the chicken breasts in Italian dressing, as I thought I had some and didn't. :(  The only other change was I used cheddar cheese instead of cream cheese.  My jalapeno peppers were weak, so it wasn't nearly as spicy as me and my fiance would have liked, but that's no fault of the recipe.  The results were delicious, regardless.  I will definitely try it again with the italian dressing and cream cheese just to see how it turns out.

This was really good. Have a ton of jalapenos in the garden, and this is an excellent way to have them. It's like a jalapeno popper inside grilled chicken. Served over spaghetti and homemade sauce, similar to chicken parmesean, but with a kick!

These are very good. We like a little more kick so we didn't remove the seeds from the jalapenos. We also added sharp cheddar to the center.  This is our second time of these and we will definetly have them again.

This is really tasty and pretty easy to make. I would suggest partially cooking the pepper before assembling this, it still had a raw texture. Very good though.

Wow, can I say YUM (and how many times am I allowed to say it?)? This recipe was simple and fantastic. I omitted the itallian dressing marinade step and just rolled up the plain flattened chicken breasts with halved jalapenos stuffed with fat-free cream cheese spread. Wrapped one thin slice of applewood-smoked bacon around each breast and secured with toothpicks. Popped them in the oven for 35 minutes at 375 degrees and then broiled for 5 min. more. FABULOUS!!! My BF couldn't stop talking about them (He loves bacon). Nice flavor and very rich from the cheese. Thumbs up!

this recipe was awesome!  so far i've made the following alterations, i omitted the italian dressing since we don't care for it as a marinade and left the chicken as is, i pounded it to 1/4" thickness. i took whole fresh jalapenos and cut the tops off and de-seeded them,heated them in a skillet for about 5 minutes, filled them with mexican taco cheese instead of cream cheese since we can't get past anything with cream cheese in it besides bagels and cheesecake lol. i took the remainder of the shredded cheese and sprinkled it on the chicken put the jalapeno inside and rolled it up and put thick cut (all i had) peppered bacon around it and pinned it closed with toothpicks. i pan seared it until the bacon was almost all the way cooked and then baked in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. pan searing it first made the bacon crispy and just right, plus it stayed on the chicken after i took the toothpicks out! putting in the oven for the remainder made the chicken perfectly moist and juicy. yes, as some other reviewers said the jalapeno is crunchy even after baking, put i think the contrast in texture is part of what makes it really great! i will certainly make this again, even my normally picky partner who hates spicy food called this "gourment cooking" served with fresh green beans pan fried with garlic,red onions,bacon and olive oil.

My family LOVED this! I added a little dry ranch dressing mix and some shredded cheddar to the cream cheese. I seeded and removed the membrane from the peppers, then boiled them for 2 minutes to remove the heat. It was too cold to grill, so I cooked the chicken on an electric griddle. FABULOUS! Next time, and there WILL be a next time, I will follow the recipe as written, as I'm quite sure it's great without my "tweaks". Thanks for a new favorite!

This recipe was good overall. I used 2 pieces of bacon instead of 1, the idea stemming from a previous reader. I also baked it instead of grilling, which worked out great: 400F for about 25 minutes, then a low broil (to crisp the bacon on the outside) for about 5 minutes or so. The only change I will make next time I make it (and there will be a next time since it was pretty good) is that I will chop the jalapeno up and mix it with the cream cheese. That way the filling will be more uniform, easier to work with and the jalapeno will be evenly distributed so you get some in every bite. Pretty yummy stuff!

SPICY!  We loved it!  I didn't marinate with the Italian dressing as others said it wasn't really necessary.  I spread cream cheese on the flattened chicken, then added sliced jalapenos from a jar - - LOTS of them.  Then I sealed with toothpicks and laid pre-cooked bacon around each chicken breast.  Baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes and served.  I found it to be quite spicy but we like it hot.  I'd have to readjust the heat if serving to guests.  DH couldn't stop raving about this one.  Excellent!

This was delicious. The dressing I used also had balsamic vinegar in it, which worked well. Next time I will parboil the pepper to soften it slightly.

This has become one of my go to recipes and one of my husbands favorites. To reduce the heat of the jalapenos, I split, de-seed and bake on a cookie sheet at 350 for ten minuets before filling with the cream cheese. I also prefer the KC Masterpeice Carribean Jerk Marinade/sauce.

This is great, esp. if you eat  alot of chicken and just need something a bit different. I marinated in homemade italian dressing, from this site. Softened the jalapenos in the microwave, stuffed with cream cheese, used a whole pepper in each breast. Grilled on high about 20 min., just as stated. Will def. make again.

This was so good and easy! My husband said it was his favorite chicken that I've made. After reading some reviews about the jalapenos being too raw, I boiled mine for ten minutes before slicing them in half and seeding them. They came out great. I then stuffed them with cream cheese and some shredded cheddar. I put them back together and used one whole jalapeno per chicken breast. They weren't too spicy at all so I'm glad I used a whole one. Also - this is news to me - but be sure to wear gloves before you handle the jalapenos. I am a novice cook and did not know this - good thing I read some reviews. I didn't have gloves so I just put some ziploc bags on my hands. I had a hard time wrapping the bacon around lengthwise - so I used one around the width and secured with a toothpick. I cooked mine on the grill and the bacon crisped up perfectly - yum! I served with grilled corn on the cob and a salad. A great meal to go with a glass of wine - thanks!

I made these for a Christmas dinner recently, and they were a huge hit!  Nothing was left!  Even my son, who was home on leave from the Air Force, and his friends, loved them!  The only difference was that I cut the chicken breasts in strips...thick strips, and followed the recipe.  I used fresh and pickled jalapenos...and you couldn't tell the difference!  I was going to go with Mexican cheese, but the cream cheese was excellent!  They were more like poppers when I was done.  WILL be doing this again!!!!

This recipe was wonderful!! Its my boyfriend's new favorite dish!! It was spicy enough for him and mild enough for me. This was an easy recipe, though I still need to improve on pounding a chicken.  I also took the advice of others and substituted the Italian dressing for Caribbean Jerkl  Anyways thank you for the great recipe!!

Wonderful!  My guy loved it.  Baked in the oven at 400 for 25 minutes and it was perfect.  Wrapped in turkey bacon just for a little bit more healthy, still great flavor.

I split large chicken breast rather than trying to roll them.  I also put cooked turkey bacon inside with the jalapenos and cream cheese rather than on the outside (since this usually burns).  I cooked it on the foreman grill and it was awesome

This was really good! I diced the jalapenos and mixed with cream cheese, salt, pepper, and garlic powder, then filled the marinated chicken with the mixture. I skipped the bacon and baked/grilled in my nuwave oven. So yummy!

A very yummy recipe. The only thing I did differently was butterfly the chicken and brush the insides with cream cheese and placed sliced jalapenos in the inside. I also baked them for 25 minutes ate 400F. This can easily be done with prosciutto to cut on fat also. Thanks for the idea of putting jalapenos in chicken!

IF I could give this recipe 10 stars I would! I LOVE this recipe!! I made it once for dinner just to give it a try. I love stuffed jalapenos so this recipe really caught my attention. I pounded the chicken thinner than what they want on the recipe and used a whole jalapeno intead of a half. My husband loved it and insisted I make it for my daughter's birthday party for the adults. I made a huge batch of these and they didn't last! I got rave reviews on these! I crave this recipe a lot! I can't thank you enought for this great recipe, I will be making this. A LOT!!

Made these a couple months ago and forgot to rate. These are very good, (except I don't like the fact that the bacon just doesn't really seem to cook. I mean I guess it does but its not appealing to eat. It just gives the chicken a good flavor. I think its ok to take off the bacon at the end and fry it crispy. Otherwise I'll end up throwing it away.) I really love the crunch of the pepper and the smooth feel of the cheese. I will make these again.****10/03/09 OK! I am finally writing this recipe down. Just dawned on me that I was not able to grill these; baked instead. That probably had alot to do with why my bacon had no crunch!

I rate this recipe the absolute best! This is my husbands’ favorite dish; I bake it in the oven with all the Italian dressing at 375-400 F and the time varies depending how thick I stuff the chicken. I mix cheddar with the cream cheese like the others suggest and depending on how big and thick your peppers are, the time will take longer with thicker or bigger peppers. Avg,. Time cooking I would say 1 hour.

We loved this recipe. I made it pretty much by the recipe, the only thing I did different was I used string cheese (I was out of cream cheese) and it was fantastic! I cooked it in the oven at 350 for 30 mins and at 400 for 10 mins and it was perfectly done.

We make this recipe often but as kabobs.  We cut chicken into kabob size chunks (on the larger side) Cut butter size or a tad smaller of cream cheese and put on chicken chunk.  Place Jalapeno on cream cheese.  Then wrap it with bacon and put on a kabob skewer.  We usually put 4 or 5 per skewer.  Grill, these are so YUMMY !!

This dish is really delicious- I make it almost once a week now!! Make sure, however, that you pound the chicken out before you try to wrap the jalapenos up, because otherwise you will definitely have a difficult time. I also use turkey bacon rather than regular bacon.

Loved it! I also baked the chicken in the oven (glass dish) instead of the grill. Wonderful combination of flavors!!

Just Great! For those who can take the heat, then 1/2 a breast per 1/2 Jalapeno slice, otherwise 1 breast to 1/2 Jalapeno is fine.  We double wrap with bacon(sprinkled with course ground pepper); 1 slice one way, the other slice the other way to hold everything in. YUM!

"Amazing", "Oh my gosh", "I didn't know chicken could taste like this"... these are just some of the things my boyfriend had to say about this dish. He's on a diet and Sundays are his 'cheat days', so I wanted to make something worth the calories and this was a home run. He said he couldn't wait to take the leftovers to work for lunch so he could show it off to his coworkers. :) Thank you so much! I'm sure I'll be making this often from now on!

I really like jalapenos so I used 2 whole jalapenos,split down one side(seeds removed)stuffed with cream cheese and chunks of sharp cheddar.I baked them in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes then crisped the bacon under the broiler for a few minutes.This is a winner!!!!

I have made this a few times now and it is always a hit.  I don't even bother wrapping with bacon and it is still amazing.  I have also used shredded cheddar cheese to stuff the jalapeno as my boyfriend doesn't like cream cheese and marinade in a mesquite marinade.  I also bake mine at 350 for 30 to 40 minutes until juices run clear.  I have prepared and frozen and taken to camp to cook.  So easy and so yummy.

This is one of my favorite recipes. When I used fresh jalapeños sometimes it was too spicy and the jalapeños were too crunchy. Now I roast the jalapeños on the grill for a few minutes first before stuffing the chicken.  They soften up and have a more mild flavor.  Delicious!!

I have made this many times my family loves it.  We cook it on the grill and us Italian dressing and soy sauce to marinate our local grocery store will cube chicken just like cubed steak if you ask makes it so easy!  I also microwave the peppers about one minute.  Thanks so much for this great recipe.

Very good, we also use apple wood for smoking and made some just with the filling (no pepper). Very tasty and I will make it again.

I chopped my jalapenos and fried them in a little butter to soften them.  I also used two slices of bacon per breast.  I think that when I make them again, I'll season the chicken before wrapping in bacon.

I marinated and pounded the chix as per recipe. I deseeded one whole jalapeno per chix breast. Stuffed it with the Cream cheese and rolled the whole Jalapeno into the chix. Wrapped 3 slices of bacon around each chix and placed in oven 400 for 25 min. I loved the crunch of the jalapeno but my husband said he would prefer the Jalapeno to be cooked a little prior. It also was surprisingly only mildly spicy. Will definitely make again!

Didn't have Italian dressing so just marinated in my own balsamic vinaigrette. I think a honey dijon marinade would be good too. I did roast the peppers first to take away the crunch. I like the idea of breading them, they just seemed to be missing a little something, maybe that's what it was. Also might add a little cheddar for flavor. Need to mix with Jalapeno Popper chicken from this site.

We love these in the summer and can't wait for the jalapenos to come in from our garden!  Like another reviewer, we use two pieces of bacon to hold everything in and filling whole jalapenos instead of halves retains more cream cheese.  Because we use a grill basked, toothpicks aren't needed.

I thought this was really good. It was really easy to make.........I didn't have time to grill outside so I just used my indoor grill. My husband said he'd rather just have grilled chicken with stuffed jalapenos on the side though.

This recipe needs a few tweaks.  The jalapeno doesn't get cooked enough when just grilled inside the chicken breast.  I put the peppers on the grill, or soften in the microwave for 30 seconds before cutting in half and stuffing with cream cheese.  Even though the chicken is marinated it also needs to be seasoned before being wrapped with bacon.

The flavor of this was excellent. The only thing I wish was better was the jalapenos...they were really crunchy and hard to cut. My chicken was done, so if I had cooked it any longer it would have been dry. Next time I think I will blanch them, or even use the jar kind.

I just finished having this for dinner and have got to say I was a lot disappointed considering all of the rave reviews. I thought it was good, but just ok, certainly nothing to rave about. I just found it lacking in flavor, and so did my family. I par cooked the bacon first. Just slightly. Just enough to get rid of some of the grease and to make sure it was cooked in the end. Maybe that's what made it bland, not sure. I had a few smaller pieces of chicken and put slices of jalapeno pepper with a gob of cr. cheese in them and found them tastier. I think the cheese to chicken ratio made them better. Like one reviewer said, she makes them as apps. Those would probably be more flavorful. Also, it seemed like  a waste of salad dressing since it added so little to the flavor of the chicken.  I will make again, omitting the bacon and italian dressing,bread the outside with some spice in the crumbs and see if that helps. Good recipe but needs more umph!

Hmmm. I really, really did not like the cream cheese in this. Weird, since I like cream cheese in other things. Otherwise, chicken marinated in italian dressing - Check! Chicken stuffed with Jalapeno - Check! Chicken wrapped in bacon - Check! What to do? I think I'll try cheddar next time instead. That cream cheese really wrecked it for me.  Also, I think the meat could use seasoning besides the marinate (I marinated for about 4 hours). Maybe that depends on what you use for the marinate. I used jalapenos from the freezer, so they were soft after thawing. I like heat so I used 1 pepper per serving. Still not that hot for me. Otherwise kept to the recipe.  Also (this is my fault not the recipe so I did not count this in the star rating) I baked at 400 for 25 min. The bacon was still not crispy so I broiled for a couple min. I ended up with over cooked chicken. Not too bad, still good to eat. Need to find a way to cook this that doesn't rely on a grill, doesn't over cook the chicken and crisps the bacon. I should try the pan-frying suggestions that are in the previous reviews. I'll definitely revisit this one without the cream cheese.

Chicken with a kick!  My family and I loved these.  I did not grill them because my husband has banned me from the grill......  However, they turned out wonderful with baking them in the oven at 400 for 30 minutes.  I also used 2 slices of bacon per breast to help keep the cream cheese inside.

This recipe was almost right except for the undercooked jalapeno inside. I had expected something softer. So next time I might boil the jalapeno or cook it somehow before assembling. Other than that, it was a delicious dish worth making again.

I cut recipe in half. I also threw in a handful of shredded mexican cheese blend, garlic, and salt to the cream cheese mixture. I baked in oven at 400 for maybe twenty minutes. Very good.

Very good!  When I make it next time I'm going to roast the peppers a little first to soften.  I will make this again.

My family LOVED this!  The bacon keeps the chicken moist on the grill.  The chicken is a delightful mix of hot and mild.  The cream in the center cools the heat.  I served it with a basil noodle dish, watermelon and some Blue Moon beer (everyone was over 21! :p)  I used Niman Ranch uncured bacon to roll the chicken up in that I purchased at Whole Food.  Loved the taste....this is a keeper!

WOW!!!! Amazing!!! I read quite a bit of reviews before making it. I bought thinly sliced chicken breasts and marinated in Robusto Italian dressing by Wishbone for almost 24 hours. I then diced and sauteed the jalapenos in a tiny bit of olive oil. I added the jalepenos to the reduced fat cream cheese and added small chunks of cheddar cheeses to the mixture. I then added it to the chicken mixture rolled it up and secured it with toothpicks. I then found the leanest bacon I could find and wrapped 2-3 pieces around the chicken, making sure to cover the openings so the cheese mixture would not seap out. I then baked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes then stuck under the broiler for a few minutes on both sides. I have never had anything soo delicious ever!!!!

Awesome! My taste buds loved it! My slight modifications included not using the Italian dressing for a marinade, as I felt it was sufficient enough without the marinade; use jarred jalapenos, as I found regular jalapenos not only not lost all their spicy taste (tasted more like a green pepper), but also didn't cook enough over the BBQ being rather crunchy, and lastly I used 2-3 pieces of bacon to cover the chicken so the cheese didn't ooze out.

WOW!  Me and my family loved this recipe...and I don't like jalapenos!  We cooked this inside in an over (350 degrees for about 30 minutes) instead of on the grill.  The only thing that we think may be better is if the jalapeno was diced and mixed with the cream cheese, then spread directly on the chicken.  For us jalapeno haters, this will help with the 'chewing' of the pepper!  I will definately have this in the favorite section of my recipe book.  OH, I almost forgot, my kids, who are 11 and 15, and are probably the pickiest kids on the face of the earth loved this too!  Great job to who ever invented this recipe!  Awesome - Great - Spectaculat - Amazing...

LOVE IT!
I didn't marinate the chicken and grilled them vs. baking.  This was wonderful and so flavorful even without the dressing.  I thought about leaving out the bacon too and am so glad I decided to use it.  Awesome flavor combo and will probably make this once a week!

I marinated my chicken in a tequila lime marinade, used more cream cheese than called for, and added a slice of cheese before sealing up the chicken. I also drizzled some of the marinade over the top, then placed the bacon on top of the chicken before baking about 20 minutes at 350. SO SO SO good!

I totally modified this recipe...besides stuffing the chicken with jalapeno and cream cheese, I also added swiss cheese.  Once jalapeno is wrapped with chicken, covered the chicken with flour (seasoned with paprika, pepper, and salt).  Added butter to the pan, placed chicken and browned it on both sides.  Once chicken is cooked on both sides added white cooking wine and heavy whipping cream to the chicken, cover and simmer...cream will get thick.  When serving chicken, cover chicken with cream.  The creamy sauce is delicious!  Goes very good with a side of salad and a side of homemade garlic bread!  Enjoy!

PHENOMENAL! I have had this recipe in my box for quite some time, and I can't believe it took me so long to make it! I used thinly sliced chicken breasts so that I didn't have to mess with pounding them. This made the rolls smaller, but they were great this way. I did saute the whole peppers in a bit of oil to soften them up, and this worked really well. I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes, then stuck them under the broiler to crisp the bacon. We were amazed that this simple recipe was so delicious! I can't wait to try these as appetizer bites, as well. Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty, but if I make again, I would use thin sliced chicken breast as it undercooked inside to prevent bacon burning on outside. Also I would par cook jalapenos as they were basically still crunchy.

We tried this last night and it was a big hit!  My normally "picky" husband even liked it.  I only changed it a little bit.  I substituted Velveeta (my husband's favorite) for the cream cheese and stuffed shredded bacon bits and canned jalapeños in the middle.  I was concerned about it not cooking thoroughly but had no problems.  Definitely a keeper!  I served it over Uncle Ben's Mexican Rice. Yummy! Thanks for the great recipe.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed this recipe because of the kick! I did think it needed some sort of sauce so I made one using cream cheese, roasted red pepper soup, half and half, and parm. cheese. I'll make this again!

These are great!!! My family loves them.  You can also replace the chicken with Jumbo Tiger Shrimp.  Just butterfly the shrimp and put the remaining ingredients inside. Wrap the bacon on the outside and secure with toothpick. Place on hot grill and turn when needed.  Yum Yum!!!!

My husband and I made this recipe last night and we just loved it!  We used light cream cheese and that worked well with it.  The jalapeno was still a touch crunchy but was very tasty all the same.

I marinated the chicken for 10 hours in Zesty Italian... and it still needed some more oomph.  With a little tweaking this could easily be a five star recipe in my book.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic!  I thought it might be hard to get it all rolled together but it wasn't at all.  Made them with the jalapeno for the adults and without for the kids.  Everybody loved it.

I used 2 pieces bacon for each chicken roll and made sure to roll them tightly.  The 1/2 pepper is just right for a bit of pep for us, except for my 9-year-olds; other than that they said this was 'really good chicken!'  The leftovers were great warmed up and sliced over a fresh, green salad later.  My husband said this is definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe, except I got an idea from another one(based on ingredients I had) and the only thing I did differently was stuff it with feta and spinach instead of jalapenos. But nonetheless, it was superb, divine. Positive words are all I have to say.

We really liked the flavor of this dish.  The pepper on the inside of chicken was little too cruchy for me.  Maybe slice the peppers and lay them on the grill for a few minutes to soften them up before wrapping them in the chicken????

Wow!  Fantastic recipe...tweaked it a bit (I'd never use bottled salad dressing for anything).  Used the Marinade for Chicken recipe by Jillypooh from this site - but added garlic, ofcourse.  And I used goat cheese instead of cream cheese.  And wrapped it with as much bacon as I could...you've gotta try it!!

These are not tasty at all. Suprisingly from all the great ratings. The marinating didn't seem to help. The bacon is pointless. I used whole Jalepeno's so my cream cheese didn't run all over. I boiled them a little first as another review suggested to get rid of the "Rawness". It was just very boring for all the work I did. Funny story though... My hands burnt for like 5hrs after handling the J's. Apparently your supposed to wear gloves?!? would have been nice to know

This was great. For two servings, I used one jalapeno cut in half. I roasted it before rolling it in the chicken with a little olive oil. I used a combination of cream cheese and cheddar cheese, and sealed up each end of the chicken with toothpicks to the cheese wouldn't melt out. I also dipped it in egg and bread crumbs, no bacon. Will make again.

I made this for 6 friends the night before we road tripped to Colorado. It was farily cheap as I am a college student!  It was super easy and everyone loved it! I marinated the chicken in italilan dressing, low sodium soy sauce, garlic powder and red pepper flakes for 2 hours. Super juicy. I served this with ranch style potatos and green beans. It was definatly a hit!

Brilliant recipe!  I used thin chicken cutlets/filets, half a jalapeno for each cutlet (I cooked the jalapenos on med high heat on a skillet to soften prior folding into the chicken), and a mixture of cream cheese and 2% sharp cheddar cheese as the filling.  I decided against the bacon since I was baking the chicken and not grilling.  Baked for 45 minutes at 375'.  Next time, I'm not sure that the chicken needs the marinade (I only let it set for 20 minutes rather than 2 hours) and may just use a little olive oil.   I will definitely make this again!

My husband and I thought the jalepenos were just too hot so we took them out after we cooked it and then it just had the perfect jalepeno flavoring without the heat. Delicious!

Very good, Cooked at a bit higher temp, to get the bacon crispy.(can't stand my bacon soft, and ruins any meal for me) Make sure you flip the chicken half way through to get both sides of the bacon. If you have leftovers, make sure you heat them in the oven. If you cook in the Microwave, makes the bacon icky.

My husband, a man who rarely cooks, & even less often cooks something good, decided to surprise me with this dish.  WOW! Not only was I treated to a delicious dish, but he is now getting more brave & trying to create new dishes. We have made it as written & we have made it substituting fresh Hatch chilies. Excellent both ways. If you like jalapeno poppers & grilled chicken, you can't go wrong with this recipe!

We love this recipe, the only change we made is to keep the jalapeno whole, cut a slit down the side take out the seeds and then fill with the cream cheese. Use the thin slice bacon. By the time the thick sliced bacon cooks the chicken is overcooked.

This recipe was wonderful.  I used fresh jalapenos from my garden, so it was even better.  I actually used a whole pepper from my chicken and only 1/2 for my husbands (he doesn't like real spicey like I do).  My six year old daughter even thought this was really good.  i will definately make this again!!

This was SO good! I only used 1/4 jalapeno as I made this for a big family dinner with several children. Next time I'll use the 1/2 as per the recipe. Everyone LOVED it! I can't wait to make it again!

Topped it with prosciutto rather than bacon - which I think helped to hold the chicken together.  We loved it!

I'd give this a 5 star but I made modifications.  Instead of italian dressing I used an Asian marinade (soy, brown sugar and garlic).  I then split the chicken breasts and stuffed with cream cheese and diced jalapenos.  I topped it with a slice of bacon and then baked.  Yummy! Therefore I give it 4 stars as it is a good starter recipe to play with.

Very tasty.  I increased the jalapeno amount to two halves per chicken breast,  Even then, it wasn't so spicy.  Very simple to make too.

This was delicious! I marinated the chicken also in lemon juice and seasonings. I didn't use bacon. Instead, I dipped the chicken in breadcrumbs and baked at 400 for 25 minutes and they were perfect! Don't forget to wear gloves when seeding the peppers!!!

Great recipe. I baked the chicken for about 45 minutes at 350. I then refrigerated it until we were ready for our cook out. I just reheated the chicken on the top rack until the bacon was crispy and the chicken was warmed through. EXCELLENT! Huge hit!

This recipie was a nice change from the regular stuffed jalepinos. I added a rub I made to the chicken and added lime honey and celantro to the marinadeand let it sit and chill over night. If i make it agin I will deffinatly add shrimp or crab to the cream cheese before finishing it.

I thought this recipe was yummy but the next time I make it I will probably add more flavoring to the cream cheese.  It was flavorful but maybe lacked a little something for me?!  I will definately try it again with a little seasoning added and see how that turns out!  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Great recipe! I did alter it a little by using a whole hollowed jalapeno filled with a mix of fat free cream cheese, shredded mild cheddar and red salsa. I grilled them this time, but I think in the oven they might come out more juicy.

Yum!  I did change a few things though and didn't use any bacon in the recipe.  Also, instead of butterflying the chicken and rolling it around the jalapeno and cream cheese, I just slit a hole in the chicken almost all the way through and slid it inside.  No leaking of cream cheese that way.  Next time the husband wants me to try using jarred jalapenos and see how that goes.

I thought this was good, but the cream cheese was OK.  I think if I stuff it with chorizo it would taste great.

The whole family LOVED this recipe!  Next time I will butterfly the breasts, marinate longer, and definitely not be too thorough with seeding & de-veining the jalapeños (jalapeños are tricky like that, they can smell like they'll have tons of heat and then eh, not so much - my family loves hot and spicy).  The flavor combinations tho are fabulous.  Definitely will be in regular rotation here!

This is going in the recipe box!  Delicious, full of flavor and HOT!  I followed the recipe exactly and used thick sliced, smoked bacon.  If making these, make sure to pound the chicken really flat so you can roll it nicely around the chicken and to ensure the chicken gets done properly without over grilling.  The only change I will make is to grill my jalapenos before stuffing them with cream cheese.  My family did not care for the crispy jalapeno inside the chicken, just seemed like it should be cooked a little more.

Made as directed but used some Goats Cheese I had leftover from another meal. I also marinated it in a vacum marinator after pounding it out and used 2 strips of bacon just to hold it together better. It was excellent !!  My wife and I loved it and will serve it to our next dinner party !

I was short on time so I was only able to marinate the chicken for a bit over an hour. I used a whole jalapeno in each chicken breast (stuffing both sides and then putting the pepper back together). I also used two pcs of bacon, wrapping one horizontally and one vertically. I had a hard time with the bacon sticking to the grill, so I'm glad I added another piece as I lost quite a bit of it. The kids didn't like it, but I thought it was AWESOME.

The flavor was really good, but I only gave it 3 stars because they are pretty labor intensive in my opinion. I followed other reviews and baked mine, and the broiled to get the bacon crispy. I think what I would do in the future is pan sear them before putting them in the oven. And find a better way to keep the cheese from leaking out. Not sure if I will make these again, but they weren't horrible.

Very tasty.  I used chicken breasts pounded thin, then stuffed a whole jalepeno with cream chese and rolled the hicken around it.  I wrapped each in two slices of bacon, which held it all together nicely, and cooked for 30 min at 400.  Next time, I think I'll try adding some cheddar cheese and then making a cream sauce to go over it.  The chicken was sooo moist and the bacon really added to the flavor.

Excellent! 
We deviated from the instructions a bit- we purchased a FF cream cheese container , jarred sliced jalapenos, & omitted the italian dressing. 
We pounded out the chicken, and then made a pocket in the middle...spread the creamcheese, placed a few jalaps in it and cut the bacon in half-placing 3 strips across the top. Baked 375 25-30 min. No toothpicks needed. CAME OUT PERFECTLY! So moist and absolutely delicious. It's definitely a keeper.

Awesome recipe! Simple but so delicious. I took someone else's advice and broiled it the last few minutes to make the bacon a little crispier. Thanks for a great recipe!

Crowd pleaser! Used whole jalapeno stuffed with cream cheese and then stuffed chicken. Used 2 pieces of bacon to secure and keep chicken moist. Cooked in oven: Preheat 400 and cook 25 min. Add to broiler to crisp bacon 5 minutes.

This was SOOOO good!   I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs because I already had them onhand and it was divine!  I did saute my jalepenos in the skillet a little to make them softer before I stuffed them (per other reader reviews).  I still can't get over how good this was and so easy!  Thank you so much for sharing!

This is a very good chicken dish if you like really spicy things.  I suated my jalapeno halves in evoo for a few min to bring out the oils and that made it even spicier.  For the kids I left out the jalapenos all together and just put in the cream cheese and they loved it.  I will def make this again and add more cream cheese next time.

It was really great!  Would have given it 5 stars, but thought the recipe needed some changes.  You should definately try it!  (I actually rate it 4.5 stars)!  We personally marinate our chicken for an hour in Dales marinade.  Then we stuff the chicken with cheddar cheese and 2 jalapeno halves. We leave half of the seeds in.  We then roll up the chicken, wrap it with bacon, and use toothpicks to secure everything.

This was quite good.  Didn't change anything; didn't need to.  Although I wish I could get more bacon around the chicken.  Be sure to grill on higher temps to make sure the bacon is cooked crispy.

Delicious! One of the best things I have ever had. Just a tip though don’t buy fillet chicken its to thin and small. Pounding the chicken breast is the way to go. And as much cream cheese and jalapenos you can get in there the better it will be.

Very good but I'll let my husband cook it next time as I burned the bacon terribly and ruined the whole presentation.  Chicken came out perfect after 8 hours of marinating in zesty italian dressing.  Great combination of flavors.  I think I will try to slightly roast the jalapeno's on the grill next time to make them less crunchy. They didn't really cook in the center and slipped around when trying to cut.  Will try again with the help of my husband!  Thank you! (Worthy of serving to friends this summer with practice)

Definitely a keeper! My family really liked it.  Next time, I'll be sure to marinate the chicken the full two hours - ran short on time today and only marinated the meat in the dressing for about 30 minutes.  Seemed to be lacking a bit in flavor, but I'm sure it was the lack of marinate time causing this.  Very easy to make! Even my picky 5 year old cleaned her plate (hers was made without jalapeno)!

We really enjoyed this.  It is different and tasty.  I used green chili peppers instead of jalapeno and sprinkled the chicken with a little Fiesta Fajita seasoning before wrapping.  You can find the Fiesta Fajita at Wal-Mart.  I use it on all kinds of meats, add it to soups, it is just a very versatile seasoning.

This recipe turned out really well even though I made a few adjustments. I substituted a grated Mexican blend for the cream cheese and used a whole jalapeno (butterflied) for each. I think this recipe would turn out just as well broiled in the oven if you don't want to grill outside.

Tried this last night and thought it was great!!  It was raining so instead of cooking it on the grill, I baked it in the oven....still great results.  My husband doesn't like bacon so I omitted the bacon.

Have made this three times. On the third time I switched it up stuffed the chicken with a roasted hatch green chilie pepper and wrapped with two strips of bacon cooked at 400 for 25 mins then mixed bbq sauce with franks red hot and poured that over chicken and cooked an additional 5 mins. Was the best I had.

FYI: Italian Dressing needs to be Zesty Italian Dressing, not plain Italian Dressing if you want flavoring added in your chicken during marinating!!! For the marinade if you want the flavoring to set into the chicken get "Zesty Italian Dressing" instead of regular Italian Dressing as this recipe calls for. I see many saying the regular Italian dressing left no flavoring. I myself learned the hard way that regular Italian Dressing doesn’t leave flavoring in your chicken, however Zesty Italian does as it has more spices and flavoring for marinating chicken in! We make baked Italian Chicken all the time marinated & then cooked in the Zesty Italian Dressing. We will definitely be trying these extra steps as far as adding the stuffed jalapeño and bacon to my usual marinated baked chicken!!

When grilling isn't an option,  use your oven at 350 deg, for about 20 minutes, the first 10-12 minutes under foil to assure the chicken doesn't become dry. Cook longer if needed to get the bacon at your desired crispness.
*Hint on the jalapenos, the heat is in the "ribs" inside the pepper, if you want the taste and not the "hot" scrape them out before filling.

Have made this several times. My husband and I love it. I make enough to seal and freeze for a great and easy meal another night. I do cook the bacon at least halfway before wrapping it around the stuffed chicken breasts. I don't use the Italian Dressing just season the breasts the way we like them - little pepper, garlic powder and Italian herbs. Add minced garlic and shredded cheese to cream cheese.  Bake in my convection oven on 400 for 20-25 minutes. Serve with salad.  So darn good.

This recipe was amazing and I had happy people raving about it for days! I highly recommend trying this recipe. Instead of just using cream cheese to stuff the peppers, I used a cheese mixture of cream cheese, cheddar, Parmesan, feta, minced garlic, with some Cajun seasoning and a dash of cayenne pepper.

As written, I wouldn't make this again. However, it does have potential and I do plan to make it again with the following changes. 1. I will use chicken tenderloins next time. 2. I grilled the jalapenos before adding them to the chicken, and I'm glad I did.Next time I plan to just spread cream cheese over the tenderloin, then chop up the grilled peppers and sprinkle them on top. Halving them made rolling the chicken a super slippery job. The peppers kept wanting to slide out. On a side note, to secure the pepper inside the chicken and not have it sliding out, I had to use 2 pieces of bacon per chicken. 3. I was smart enough to cover the grill grate with aluminum foil first. Otherwise I would have had a grease fire. I actually pulled the edges of the foil up to create a shallow "bowl" to contain the grease in. With the above changes, I do believe this recipe will be a 5!

I'm giving this a 5 Star rating because it was fantastic! I did change a few things... first I didn't have Italian dressing so I used the powder Italian dressing mix as a dry rub, the other thing I changed was instead of one slice  of bacon I used 2 (you can never have too much bacon) . My husband has requested I make this all the time. Next time I might sprinkle some brown sugar over it for a bit of sweetness. The peppers gave it a little heat but the flavor was fabulous.  I served with grilled potatoes with onion.

I kept all the seeds in the jalapenos, and it made the chicken super spicy. John LOVED it this way, but I may remove some of the seeds next time. It was pretty intense.

Wow, incredible!! I told my husband as I was bacon wrapping the chicken and poking toothpicks through that I wasn't sure if it would be worth the effort. I was so wrong! I have to make this for guests now, I don't care how much time it takes. It's that delicious. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

We like spicy food (a lot) and maybe it was the fresh jalapenos I got but this was SUPER spicy! Cooking those peppers down and keeping all the juices in the chicken just made it too spicy.

As is, even with marinating the chicken in Italian Dressing for 24 hours, this is pretty bland.  I like the potential of this dish, so I will try again using some more spices, and a different cream cheese (maybe onion and chive).

I did not marinate the chicken.  But I did all the other steps.  There was a good flavor. But I have a few ideas to make it better.  After marinating I would add two slices of bacon and a slice of pepper jack cheese at the end of the recipe.l will make this again.

I can't count how many times I've made this, it really has become a staple during bbq season, the only changes I've made is to mix Italian dressing with a smokey bbq sauce, baste more bbq sauce during grilling and if i remember i roast the peppers in the oven to soften them a bit b4 filling them

Great recipe!  I made these using Chive and Onion cream cheese and I baked in the oven @ 400 for 30 mins.  They were very tasty  and we really enjoyed the little zip and flavor of this recipe.  Will make again.

This one was just ok for us.  We love the poppers with the jalapenos stuffed with cream cheese and wrapped in bacon.  I'm not sure why this didn't work for us.  It was just average.  My cooking time was much longer than the 20 minutes.  I pulled mine off at 30 minutes and they were still not done.  Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was good.  I made some with cream cheese and some with a garlic and herb cheese spread I had on hand.  Everyone like the one with the cheese spread better.  I also grilled the jalapeno before I stuffed it with cheese and rolled the chicken around it.  Thanks for sharing.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!! Great dish and super easy. The only 2 things I would do differently would be to double the jalapenos (fresh jalapenos just aren't that spicy to me) and two, preheat and use medium heat, High was a little much and created a great char but would have burned had we left it on high. I suggest serving this with some grilled corn on the cob... the perfect summer meal!

Four stars only because I changed the recipe so much for myself. What a great idea though! Here's what I did different: I used poblano peppers, which I charred on the gas stove for 5 minutes, steamed in a bag, and rubbed the skin off. I like that flavor better than jalapenos. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and used 1 oz per breast. I also marinated in tequila lime marinade, but next time I think will just season the chicken with oil, lemon, garlic, salt and pepper. I skipped the bacon (I have no grill and don't like the bacon cooked in the oven - too soggy) and baked these at 350 for 30 minutes and broiled for 5 minutes. PERFECTLY done. Never would have thought of this on my own - thanks!!

This was a very good recipe. As New Mexicans, me and my family LOVE spicy food! I let the jalapenos I got from the store ripen a little bit more in the refrigerator for a few days and they were quite spicy. I didn't marinate the chicken in Italian as I don't have a taste for the dressing. I seasoned them well though with lemon pepper and it tasted great! I also ended up cooking them in the oven instead of on the grill because the bacon was falling off and flaring the fire.

Really good!  Only differences I did was canned peppers and slow cooked the breasts in a pan (I don't have a grill).  Fantastic!  My husband said "This is how you should cook chicken from now on."

I followed the recipe as written, but used fat free dressing, low fat cheese and turkey bacon.  This recipe is a winner in my book.  I loved the taste.  The only mild complaint I have is that the jalapeno did not soften with cooking/grilling; it was still crunchy.  The bacon imparted a subtle smokey taste, which was a nice complement to the italian herbs and cream cheese.  Yummy dish.  I might pop the jalapenos in the microwave to soften before grilling next time.

This recipe is good.  We made it for dinner tonight.  We baked ours for 350 F for 30 minutes, then ncreased the temperature to 400 F and baked it for another 10 minutes, just to make the bacon crispier.  Next time, we make this recipe, i'll make sure that my chicken is marinated at least 24-hours, put more cream cheese, and choose a thinner sliced bacon.  I think i'll also follow one reviewers suggestion to put it in skewers.

This was soo Fab!!  I did marinate in tequila lime by Lowrys.   Cut fresh Jaleponos in half and spread cream cheese on each half.  Rolled chicken up with Jalepo and put two bacona;  lenght wise and one width wise on each breast.   Barbque (for my first time, I might add) till bacon was crisp.   This chicken was so  moist and flavorful, there was no noise at the dinner table people to busy stuffing their mouths.

Fantastic!  I used half a pepper in each and stuffed it with cream cheese and cheddar cheese. We ran out of propane so had to cook it in the oven, but it still turned out great.  I removed my pepper before eating, but the juices left a nice spice to the rest of the chicken, perfectly complimented by the cheeses and bacon. My picky husband gave it a 9/10 which is a BIG deal.  Thanks!!!

This is a wonderful recipe and a definite crowd pleaser.  A few alterations that I make is wrapping the chicken in a honey-bacon, which adds a delicious sweetness.  Also, I like to marinate the chicken in a teriyaki dressing for a few hours instead of the italian dressing and drizzle cheddar cheese on the top before baking.  This recipe is delicious!

This was a nice new way to prepare chicken.  I will make again, but probably use a smaller piece of jalapeno in my serving.  It was a little too spicy for me, but my husband thought it was great!  It's nice that you can alter it to suit individual tastes.

Bland and boring- I know it seems crazy considering the bacon and the jalapeños, but it was.  I took the suggestions and minced up the jalapeños and added some cheddar cheese to the mix.  That part was really tasty, I added a dash of garlic powder to that too.  I baked the chicken wrapped in 2 strips of bacon at 350' for 35 minutes on a cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet to keep the bacon from getting soggy, and the chicken came out moist, but my husband and I both took a few bites and abandoned it. It was lacking in flavor and despite our best efforts the bacon didn't seemed cooked thoroughly on the bottom.  I won't even attempt to make this again.

Excellent recipe as is...we love spice and this hit the spot!  If you are pressed for time, try the following: 1) Omit the italian dressing and the marinating time by using the Spicy Chicken Breasts rub on this site from Barbara Radford. This adds more of a kick; reduce the cayenne to temper the heat, if needed). 2) Use pickled jalapeno slices - just chop them up and press into the cream cheese, seeds and all. 3) Use lean bacon, as fattier bacon can disintegrate on the grill. Thanks, Cristi!

My Husband and I absolutley LOVED this recipe.  It tasted like a jalepeno popper you get at restaurants!  I made it exactly as shown but next time I think I'll add a whole jalepeno stuffed with the cream cheese.  I'm salivating as I write this.  Think we'll be having it again for dinner! Thanks, Cristi, for a SIMPLE yet DELISH new way with chicken.

This was great! I had some leftover bottled tequila/lime marinde so I used that in place of the Italian.  My husband doesn't like cream cheese so I used some slices of Colby cheese for his, but stuck with the cream cheese for mine (both were great).  I used chicken tenders so one piece of bacon wrapped around was perfect.  I baked them at 400 degrees for 25 minutes, turned the broiler on low for five minutes, flipped the chicken over and browned the other side under the broiler for five minutes.  VERY GOOD!!

This was really good...and easier than I expected. I marinated the breasts overnight, stuffed with the jalapeno/cream cheese, and wrapped with 2 slices of bacon. I grilled them on high for about 25 minutes and they came out perfect! YUM!!

This was great.  I've grilled it before, but tonight I baked it and added a "sauce" from another similar recipe.  Wonderful recipe...you can add or take from it to adjust to your taste.  Will make again!! :)

This was an absolute hit for the entire family. The only change I made was baking it rather than grilling. Thanks for the recipe, I will be making it again!

Really good!  It's a shame the Jalapeno I used wasn't spicy at all. I wrapped the chicken in prosciutto instead of bacon. Don't know how much flavour the italian dressing added to the overall dish. It made the chicken very soggy & hard to roll. I wouldn't bother marinating it next time I make this.

Modified this to a main dish instead of appetizer.  I didn't cut into strips or add bacon, and I baked it instead of grilling, and it came out really well.  There were no leftovers, even my husband loved it.

Wonderful! I like this recipe even better than spinach-stuffed chicken breasts. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent recipe AS IS! Lots of flavor!!

We really enjoyed it and it was a great change from the "norm."  The flavors work really well together. I baked it and had no issues with the jalapenos being too crispy however I love raw peppers so i was perfectly happy with their level of crisp. The bacon is a must have - i hardly ever eat it so including it was not an issue for me and it was the final flavorful touch. I dont think it would be as good without it.

Thanks for such a great recipe!

My husband and I loved this.  I omitted the bacon, just because I felt it didn't need it since the jalapeno and cream cheese would be enough flavor.  My husband requested this for his birthday and I even started growing a pepper plant so they would be on hand.

These were yummy. I used wishbone italian this time, next time I will try another kind of marinate. My husband, not a big fan of jalapenos just took his out of the center and still had some of the taste.

Absolutely fantasic!!  The best chicken recipe I've made in a long time.  Used Ken's 3 Cheese Italian Dressing to marinate (3 hours), cut three breasts in half, flattened them to 1/4" thick and then rolled with the cream cheese stuffed pepper.  Will be serving for a large pool demolition party this weekend.

This is so delicious!  Don't be afraid of the jalapeno.  We thought that it might be too spicy and so tired some with the jalapeno and some with a roasted poblano pepper.  The flavor of the chicken with the jalapeno was much better and not overly hot.  Just gives it a nice kick.  They do take careful watching on the grill so that the bacon doesn't get overly crispy and hard before the chicken is done.
