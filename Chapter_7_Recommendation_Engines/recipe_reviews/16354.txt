This recipe was excellent.  I have made it twice already.  I added about a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and sauteed the onions in a little butter and garlic just for a few minutes until the onions were softened. It was delicious!!!!! thanks

Good Stuff - I did follow the advice of other reviewers:  1.  Sauted the onion 2.  Use seasoned bread crumbs 3.  Doubled the ketchup mixture and reduced the amount of mustard a tad 4.  1 tbsp Worstishire in the meat mix 5.  Line the pan with foil for easy clean up 6.  LET THE MEAT REST before slicing.  Served it with Paula Deens Cottage Potato's and steamed vegetables. No complaints from the boys who were over for dinner.   Went down well with a 2004 Pinot Noir. Will make this again.

This was a great recipe.  I compiled and followed all of the advice of previous reviewers: 
 
-I lightly browned the onions in butter before adding.  
-I also added chopped green onions, mushrooms, and a green bell pepper. 
-I used italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  
-I tripled the sauce (many said that there was not enough sauce/topping) and 
-I baked for longer than the recipe states (I baked for a total of one hour and 25 minutes).  

It came out perfectly.  Thanks for the great recipe, and reviewers thanks for the great hints/amendments!

I have tried some more "exotic" meatloaf recipes on this site which have turned out quite good, but my husband wanted more of a basic meatloaf so that it would be good on a sandwich the next day.  I chose this recipe based on the high marks and the easy ingredients.  I substituted ground turkey for the beef, and followed the "most helpful" suggestions of sauteeing the onions in butter + garlic, and adding 1 Tbsp. of worchestshire to the meat mix.  Other than that, followed the recipe completely, and it was wonderful!!!  Very tasty and moist (one thing I can't stand is a dry meatloaf, not this one!) and I have a feeling it will make great meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow.  Thanks for the post!

I made this recipe and altered it according to previous reviews:  1) I added Worcestershire Sauce 2)didn't have any fresh onion so I used minced 3)added garlic powder 4) added 1 slice of bread ripped into pieces since it seemed too wet when mixing 5)used a glass baking dish 6)doubled the topping 7)used seasoned bread crumbs.  A 1.30# of meat cooked in an hour.  This turned out great and we went back for seconds even when my man is sick and said he wasn't hungry!  I personally thought the topping was a tad too sweet so I would do everything the same next time except reduce the brown sugar some.  This was very easy and a big hit.  Will definitely make again and again!!!

YUMMY!!! Made this dish for company the other night and WOW! It was a BIG hit! My 6 yr old had 2 huge pieces and my hubby even had leftovers for breakfast the next morning while we were all still sleeping! I used 2-1/4lbs. of ground beef, kept the 1 onion(1 of my guests is not a big onion fan), 2 eggs, 1-1/2 cups of both milk and SEASONED breadcrumbs, threw in some garlic powder and parsley flakes and doubled the ketchup mixture. Seasoned breadcrumbs are a must for this recipe; Would be very bland without them. Thanks for the great recipe! :)

Hands down, this was the best meatloaf that I've ever made.  I used about 2.3 lbs. of ground beef.  

Following some of the advice of others as well as adding a few of my own tweaks, the meatloaf was perfect.  

Here's what I did:

1.  I sautéed finely chopped onion, 3 cloves (minced garlic) & 2 stalks of celery in butter (which really makes the loaf tender); then added it to the ground beef.

2.  I added 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to the ground beef mixture along with 2 eggs instead of 1, 1 1/4 cup of milk & about 1 1/2 cup of dried Italian bread crumbs.

3.  For the sauce:  I initially made it as the directions indicated with 2 TBSP. of brown sugar, and found it to be way too sweet.  I then added 1/3 more ketchup and a couple of dashes of Worcestershire Sauce and it was perfect.

4.  It was an abundance of sauce, and a lot of the other reviews said that there wasn't enough sauce, so I spooned a thin layer at the bottom of the loaf, molded half the loaf, then sauced the top, and then added the rest of the loaf on top and sauced it really well.  This was absolutely perfect.  

5.  Lastly, there was no specification on whether or not to cook the meatloaf covered or uncovered.  I used enough aluminum foil to line the baking dish as well as cover the top (so I essentially wrapped the loaf in foil) and cooked covered for 45 minutes, drained most of any accumulated liquid and cooked uncovered for an additional 30 minutes.

This was super moist and delicious!!!!!

I made this meatloaf with my boyfriend. Not only was it delicious but we had a lot of fun making it. At first i was worried that it would be too onion-y, but using the whole onion was well worth it. 
it was a dark dark scary night and i was home all alone, hungry and scared, all of the sudden the hunger kicked in and i walked in the kitchen, opened the fridge and there it was, a big juicy hunk of meat with onions, pepper, and one medium sized egg.  without a second thought i clenched my teeth into it and mmmmmmmmm oh my lord it was so meaty and loafy. my night was made. it just... just... magical.

This recipe was definitely easy to make but I wasn't sure of the brown sugar mixture that goes on top and sure enough when my husband tried it, he said it was like eating desert and dinner at the same time. He said it was way to sweet and that he couldnt taste the meat b/c of all the breadcrumbs. May want to cut back to less than 3/4 cup. He made me promise not to make this again. Personally, I thought it was ok.

This is the same recipe that I have used for years. My son only likes ketchup on his, but the rest of us love the sweet/tangy sauce.  I also add 8 saltine crackers crumbled into crumbsand reduce the bread crumbs by the amount of crackers and a small minced cut carrot to it. This is a very good and moist recipe. This recipe also does well with green pepper or mushrooms added to it.

Whoops! The recipe submission lists 2 tablespoons brown sugar, not the 2 cups we published. We have revised the recipe to include the correct amount. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Don't be discouraged by the unimaginative ingredient list.  I made this recipe exactly as instructed, adding some worcestershire to taste, but I think it would be fine without it.  The raw onions give a perfect crunch, I would not pre cook them. The flavor punch comes from the perfect sauce, my family loved it. I look for good meat loaf recipes like I look for the perfect purse. And this is IT for me.  It would be good to use it as a base for adding whatever else you wanted, but I don't want to mess with a good thing. This is IT for all you cooks.

Absolutely love this recipe! It was so easy to make and so delicious!! My boyfriend and I both had seconds it was so good. I did some altering to the recipe, which I thought made it even better. I listened to the other reviewers and sauteed the onions in a little butter and garlic powder. I also did half a cup of crushed Ritz crackers and half a cup of Italian Seasoned bread crumbs. I added a 1oz packet of Hidden Valley Ranch seasoning for flavor. For the topping I did 1/3 cup ketchup, 1/3 cup sweet baby rays bbq sauce and 1 tbs regular mustard. I had bbq sauce on meatloaf at a really nice restaurant and it gave me the idea, the combination is perfect!!!

Almost identical to the Ranch House Meat Loaf recipe I use.  I use 2 lbs gr. beef, 1 cup cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs (trust me it is better), 2 eggs, 1/2 cup onion, 3/4 of 10 oz. can of beef broth (instead of milk), 1 tsp. sage, 1 tsp. thyme and 1/4 tsp. pepper.  For topping: 3 tbsp. brown sugar, 4 tbsp. ketchup and 1 tsp. dry mustard.  Bake meatloaf at 325 for 1 1/4 hours.  Remove from pan and place on plate (this gets the meatloaf out of the grease for the final cooking).  Put topping on meatloaf and return to oven for additional 30 minutes.  DELICIOUS!!!!

This meatloaf was great! I did as some of the other reviewers did, I tweaked a few items. B 4 cooking I read some reviews about the meat being too mushy. The trick to solve this problem is to put two slices of bread in the bottom of the pan before the meatloaf. Also, use 1 packet of Lipton's onion soup instead of real onions. And to give the meat a nice flavor, use 1 tblspn of Worstcestershire sauce. Instead of using 1 cup of milk, use 1/4 cup. My family loves a more firm meatloaf and this was perfect. After dinner, my hubby fell right to sleep! :-) Guess that's what GOOD comfort food does to ya.

This is a great, classic meatloaf, and the topping mixture is delicious! However, using all ground beef resulted in a very dense and sort of chewy meatloaf. I would advise using a "meatloaf mix" of either beef & pork or beef, pork and lamb. Many grocery stores sell a mix like this already pre-packaged, but you can always just buy them separately and mix them together. I used such a mix when I made this for the second time, and it resulted in a meatloaf that was moist and had a more pleasing texture. I did add about 15 minutes to the baking time. Other than that, I loved it and will make it again!

Very tasty meatloaf but came out really mushy for me because I didn't let it sit long enough after it came out of the oven.  It needs to sit for at LEAST 10 minutes, this definitely should be in the directions.  I took other reviewers advice and did the following: 1) added garlic powder and worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture.  2)  Used less brown sugar in the topping mixture (probably more like 1 tbsp of sugar).  I also used crushed white cheddar Cheese-Its instead of breadcrumbs, gives it a nice cheesy flavor.    Some reviews say to double the amount of topping, which is true, it does need more, but I would suggest reserving some of the sauce and warming it up at very low heat in a saucepan.  Then, drizzle over the meatloaf after you slice and plate it.  Yummy sauce!

This was very good!  I read through the reviews and took a few tips and added some of my own. First, I used ground chuck (80/20). It had a wonderful flavor and consistency. I think ground beef would be mushy and ground sirloin might turn out too chewy so watch that. Ground Round would work ok too.  I minced my onions very fine and they were great. I did add several splashes of woscheshire and some garlic powder to the mix.  I doubled the sauce (but not the sugar) and I thought it was fantastic. I baked this in a foiled lined glass dish that was round and I poked a hole in the middle of the raw meatloaf with the end of a wooden spoon  before the sauce went on to facilitate even cooking.   I cooked it for 1 1/2 hours on 350, took it out of the oven, drained away some of the fat that collected and then most importantly I tented it with foil and let it rest for 10 mins before slicing into it. You have to let the meat juices redistribute so resting is an important step. Also, the temp of the meat continues to rise another 5-10 degrees so you know your food is properly cooked. So what I ended up with was a moist, succulent restaurant quality meatloaf that looked and sliced great and tasted even better. This is the ultimate comfort food. This recipe easily serves 4 and makes great left overs. Thanks everybody! Enjoy.

Really enjoyed this meatloaf. I added a few tablespoons of worcestershire sauce and a little garlic powder. I also made 3 small loaves instead of one big one. It cut down on the cooking time from 1 hour and 15 to about 50 minutes or so.

I struggled for a long time to find a perfect meatloaf recipe. The famly always claimed my meatloaf was good, but I never cared for it. First time I made this meatloaf everyone just raved about it, including the more picky eaters. I did add a dash of low sodium wortceshire sauce. This is a keeper and will be my main meatloaf from now on.

I LOVE this recipe!  It tastes great and is easy.  

The only modifications that I made were to:

1) Leave out the ketchup
2) Put the brown sugar in with the meat and other ingredients (a mistake the turned out to be great)
3) Use BBQ sauce as a glaze 
4) Bake it in muffin cups

By baking it in muffin cups, we were able to get 12 servings out of it, which helps with portion control, because when I slice meatloaf, there's never enough for two meals.

Great recipe that I'd certainly recommend to others.

I tried this several times to see if I could tweak the recipe to something less sweet/more solid. The basic meatloaf ingredients are right but the ketchup/sugar/mustard sauce is way too sweet even for someone with a sweet tooth. I doubled the ketchup as other reviewers suggested but I don't think you need to add any sugar to it. I reduced the milk to 3/4 cup which helped a lot, kept the bread crumbs at 1 cup. My only other suggestion is to maybe increase the ground beef to 2 lbs or find a really lean 90% and above ground beef so that the natural fat in it doesn't make it so greasy. If you want to use this recipe, I recommend leaving the sugar out and using lean ground beef.

This is a very delicious, basic recipe. I would have given it 5 stars, but I made a few alterations which prevented it from being on the bland side. I added about a tablespoon or so of Worcestershire sauce (I just eyeballed it), used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain, sautéed the onion with a few cloves of freshly minced garlic, added some fresh chopped parsley into the meatloaf, and I added about a tablespoon of BBQ sauce to the glaze just to give it a little more dimension. And for my tastes, I used a teaspoon each of salt and pepper (if anyone wondered how much should be recommended). Don't forget to double the sauce! **Also, here's a helpful tip on how to cook it. Free-form the loaves, and place them on a cookie cooling rack. Line a large cookie sheet/baking pan with foil, and place the cooling rack on top of the baking pan. This will allow the fat/drippings from the meatloaf to fall onto the bottom of the pan, so any draining/soaking will not be necessary.** The original recipe yields a pretty good meatloaf, very moist and with the right proportions...but the modifications made it even better! It was my first time making it, and I even made my grandma proud. :)

I thought this was a great recipe!  I added the worcestershire and cooked the onion as previous posters said. I cooked it 1 hour in a pampered chef stone loaf pan and it was a little underdone.  I think 1 hr 15 would have been perfect.

I rated this recipe a 3 because it contained no ingredients to provide flavor and virtually all reviewers altered it in some way.  As others, I sauteed the onions along with some finely chopped celery, green pepper and roasted red pepper.  I used only half the bread crumbs and milk because I wanted meatloaf rather than bread pudding.  I also added Worcestershire sauce and some chopped parsley.  It was very tasty but nothing like the recipe provided here.

I love this recipe. I've saved it for the past year and made it my exclusive "standard meatloaf" recipe. I add veggies to it and make it with 3 lbs of ground turkey now. My boyfriend eats meatloaf sandwiches with the leftovers, so I make this same recipe, doubled, (except same 1 cup of milk), and add a green bell pepper, half a yellow squash, and a handful of baby carrots. It's absolutely awesome.

Great meatloaf. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added green pepper to the meatloaf. Didn't saute the onions and did make extra topping sauce. It turned our amazing! The only gripe I would give is that you need to cook it for at least an hour andfifteen minutes or hour and a half, as well as, put bread in the bottom of the pan to soak up the grease. I only cooked it for an hour and the middle had raw spots so we couldn't eat the entire thing. But I will make again for sure!!!

Awesome meatloaf.  I made 4lbs of it.  I did alter the recipe a bit.  I added in a 1lb roll of breakfast sausage, a packet of dry onion soup mix and a few drops of Worcestershire sauce.  

~2nd Time Making this~
Everyone that eats this loves it.  Its a huge success. I tend to alter the recipe each time depending on what I have; however I add sausage each time.  If you haven't tried it, I suggest you do.

The ingredients were like soup by the time I mixed in all the milk. If you try this recipe, you might consider cooking an additional 30 minutes so the meatloaf firms up. I think this is due to all the liquid that was added. Otherwise you will be spooning it instead of slicing. I thought the brown sugar would be a nice addition but the formula works out like this:
beef + brown sugar = gross

Since we like to keep kosher at home, I substituted the milk with an additional egg and used panko bread crumbs (which are parve). Total cook time ended up being 1hr and 10 mins. It came out delicious.

Ok! So I rarely write reviews but I felt like this little jewel deserved a mention. So I decided to surprise the boyfriend with something new BUT old. I searched through the net for a simple yet easy meatloaf recipe.. Well because I've never made meatloaf before!! I stumbled upon this, quickly went to the supermarket, got all necessary ingredients and dashed back to my kitchen to put it all together. ***I definitely followed what other users said about sautéing the onions and adding 3 average sized garlic cloves - well because I just love anything oniony & garlicky!!! I have it a generous 4-5 round sprinkles of worcestershire sauce. I also doubled the ketchup mixture which I thought was enough but not enough for me since I just love anything drenched in sauce, the more saucy the better.*** THE VERDICT: Both son & boyfriend devoured their first plates and asked for seconds, mind you son is only 4 1/2 yrs. old! HAHA! Also, I made potatoes au gratin & steamed/baked garlic veggies with this. Everything bounced right off each other and it made the whole plate very comforting to eat. A WINNER!

I had mine in the oven when I started to read all the reviews and was getting a little worried because of all the people saying it took over 2 hours to cook, that is was all mushy, and people saying it was gross.  First of all, what did those people do wrong??  
I followed the directions perfectly and mine came out great.  The topping was very good, people were saying it was too sweet and it soaked into the loaf...mine didn't.
There could have been a little more flavor it in and next time I might add some sage or some garlic but other than that this was very good.  I cooked mine for about 1 hour and 5 minutes, the very middle was a light pink but it was still hot.  My husband microwaved that part for 30 seconds and it was fine.  The cook time should be about 1 hour and 15 minutes to cook the middle.
I also really liked it because the meatloaf my mom always made was very good and would melt in your mouth, this was very close to doing that.
After the load was done cooking, there was some grease in the pan which is bound to happen because it is beef.  I didn't do this but next time I will let it cool for a bit then try to drain some of that grease out before cutting and serving it.
Basically, I love this and so did my husband.  I don't know what the others who claimed it was soup when they mixed everything together did but if you follow everything correctly you should end up with a great dinner.
Oh, I also used crushed croutons instead of bread crumbs.


Great recipe!!!!

I made this recipe several months ago and accidentally added the brown sugar, mustard and ketchup INTO the meat mixture and baked it.  AWESOME! It added "something" unique to the meatloaf instead of just a topping.  Now it's the only recipe I use.

My very picker eaters, each with different preferences and tastes, all LOVED this meatloaf and have asked to add it to our "regular" dinner arsenal.  I used Italian style bread crumbs instead of regular only because that's what I had in the pantry and it turned out great.  THANKS!

Amazing. I prefer to use oatmeal instead of bread crumbs. But tried it both ways and you really can't tell the difference. I double the sauce topping because I like a little extra :)

Icky...I followed directions to a T.  Meatloaf looked undercooked and the ketchup on top was way too sweet.  Not much flavor to this loaf of meat. Won't be making this again.

WOW its all in the ketchup/mustard glaze....and don't change a thing....  I have told people to make their own meatloaf recipe but to try this glaze...  their husbands told them it was the best meatloaf they ever made.  To the meat I added a little oregano, basil and garlic, and chopped green peppers....that is how I make my meat loaf... however this glaze will go on ALL meatloaves!  Great recipe!

Wonder why I ever bothered making all those fancy meat loaves with veal, pork and beef, etc etc etc…this was so easy and my family liked it just as much, if not more. I used Ritz crackers for the breadcrumbs, just because I wanted to use them up. I did sauté the onion. I think it would be fine to eliminate onion altogether and it would still be good.
Update 11/2/14: Made this again but didn't sauté the onion (use 1/2 onion) and just used saltines. Still delicious - the husband and kids ate the whole thing.

Four star with no topping. I've never understood meatloaf topping and don't care for it when I've had it. I don't know anybody who puts on a topping. We use gravy or Heinz 57 for dipping...no topping necessary and a tomatoey or BBQy type topping doesn't do well with gravy, which we have anyways for the mashed potatoes that go with the meatloaf.

Good flavor. Next time I'll add celery salt and replace the bread crumbs with oats. Oats make for a more moist meatloaf, always, in my opinion, when the loaf is made from all ground beef...not so dense.

I made this for thirty people and ALL of them went back for seconds and wanted the recipe!!  When I go home to Colorado all of my relatives always ask me to make this.  I disagree with people that said that the brown sugar topping made it to sweet.  It was perfect!!

This was pretty tasty.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly, because someone decided that the bowl of hamburger defrosting in the fridge was an invitation to make themselves a hamburger for lunch, but I think I was close enough to the original recipe's proportions to review it honestly.

I sauteed the onion and about a tablespoon of garlic in some olive oil and butter.  I ended up using 2/3c milk and 1 cup bread crumbs (Italian seasoned).  The sauce was too sweet and it wouldn't have been enough.  I ended up tripling the sauce and adjusting the ingredients (NOT triple the sugar.) to make up for it. I ended up with: 1 c ketchup, 3T brown sugar, 1 T mustard, 1tsp vinegar, 1 tsp hot sauce.  It was tangy and just a touch sweet.  Overall, a very solid meatloaf base.  And it was super moist.  

Next time, I'll probably use 2-3lbs of meat since it shrank quite a bit in my 8x8 dish.

No wonder people hate meatloaf.Followed the recipe exactly and I think that it had way too much bread crumbs in it and made it too light and fluffy, which meatloaf should not be. It should be dense and full of meat, not fluff.

I would not recommend anyone to make it. The brown sugar was way to much, the syrupy mixture destroyed the loaf.

This is the second time I made it and it turns out great with minor changes. 
I add chopped bell pepper and a couple of dashes of Worcestershire Sauce. I don't use the brown sugar/ketchup mixture, instead I just use ketchup as a topping.
Husband loves it and he is a true southerner ;)

Mmm. Tasty. I made as directed and it turned out great. The loaf had cracked a bit but the taste made up for it. Thanks for sharing.

Just like momma used to make! The only difference is that she used onion flakes instead of real onion - same flavor, but for some reason it doesn't make you quite as gassy as using real onion.

great recipe, entire family had seconds. Changes I made: beef/veal/pork mixture, add garlic, italian seasoning, worcestershire sauce to mixture (def needs spices, salt & pepper), if you use all the mustard you wont have it taste as sweet, if you 1/2 the mustard it will be a little too sweet, def. double the sauce mixture!!! This one's a keeper!

It's funny when people make all these modifications to a recipe, and then complain when it doesn't turn out the way it should. Seriously, take my word for it and don't alter the recipe. Doubling the sauce is fine, because the sauce is amazing and just adding more makes it even more delicious. But nothing more than that. This is truly the most amazing meatloaf recipe I've ever tried!

This is another great meatloaf.  Instead of the bread crumbs, I use quaker oats.  This glaze is better than mine.  What's fun is that you can adjust this to your familys likes and dislikes, even hiding some of their dislikes.

Easy, very moist & quite good. I only used the recipe as a guide & followed some other suggestions, such as using seasoned bread crumbs & adding worcestershire sauce...I also sauteed the onion with diced bell pepper & garlic (in a small bit of butter), then finally threw in a bit of italian sausage I had leftover from another meal. Since I doubled the recipe I baked it for 2 hours, adding the sauce (used 1/2 the brown sugar) the last 30 minutes only. I have no doubt this will make terrific sandwiches tomorrow.

So good! I omitted the mustard from the sauce and my family loved it.  I also added worcestershire to the meat - tasty.  Finally, I divided the meat into two loaves; cooked in one hour.

Great meatloaf recipe.  this is basically how I make mine, however, you can also cook in the microwave.  I put a hole or a well  in the middle like a angle food cake pan and I put the sauce over the meatloaf & cook with a lid on it in the microwave for 20-30 minutes.  Keep an eye on it after 20 minutes.  Then let it sit for 10 minutes or so after you take it out and it should be done.  Keeps the house from heating up.  My daughter is the 'microwave queen'.  I taught her from an early age how to cook in the microwave to avoid her getting into trouble by cooking on the stovetop.  She learned well, and this recipe can be cooked in the microwave as well.  Still turns out pretty good if you need to use the microwave instead of a regular oven.

Awesome.  I would cut back on the brown sugar because I felt it was too sweet.  I added more onions as well as garlic and parsley..  It was very small when I took it out of the oven so I added an additional 1/2 pound of beef.  Perfection!

I'm not a huge cook but my step-mom said it was the best meatloaf she's ever had. I sauteed the onions in butter and garlic prior to putting them in the mix as others suggested, and the end result was delicious!

Easy and Delicious! I only had a pound of ground beef but I kept the other amounts the same. I did put in a garlic clove, cayenne pepper, sage and tyme. Mmm! Also, I didn't use any measuring spoons when I mixed the topping, so I think I put in too much brown sugar. But it turned out really well and tasted like barbecue sauce. My husband loved it. I formed it as a loaf in a pan and put cubed potatoes and carrots around it. Put some olive oil over those and sprinkled with salt, pepper and tyme.

This meatloaf is the BEST!  I've already made it a few times. It is on the sweet side but that's what makes it great.  EXCELLENT for meatloaf sandwiches.  The topping seems to keep all of the juices inside.  IT'S GREAT !!! AAA+++

A good, basic meatloaf recipe, but it seemed a bit bland. I sautéed onions, red peppers, and garlic in butter, waited for it to cool, then added it to the meat mixture. I also added a few Saltine crackers as well Italian bread crumbs. In addition, I added about 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and a dash of A-1 steak sauce. I doubled the sauce, but only added approximately 1 tablespoon of brown sugar as I don't care for sweet things. I found that I had to bake it for approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes. Overall, a good, easy recipe.

i liked this recipe alot. I followed the advice of another review saying to saute the onions and garlic, i added bell pepper as well. and lots of garlic because i love garlic. I added the worchestire sauce as recomended along with a generous sprinkling of Italian seasoning. Turned out great. I did decide to cook a little longer and cover with foil some of the cook time to prevent burning.

It was good, just felt like there was something missing. The sauce was amazing!!!! I made it with mashed potatoes. My husband really liked it but also felt like there was something missing. I'll have to experiment a little bit, this was also my first meatloaf dish I've ever made!

Not sure what the problem is...I followed directions completely and it's been 2 hours and it's still in the oven.  I pulled it out at one hour and it was still raw in the middle so put it back in.  Very disappointed right now

Super easy and incredibly good!!!  My wife had ground turkey, so I used that instead of beef, and because it was Passover, I had taken a bunch of Matzah and put it into my Vitamix and grounded up in place of the bread crumbs.  Other than that, made it as is, and it was great!!!!  Will make that again.

Really good recipe. My husband was disapointed to see I was making meatloaf, but was MORE than pleasantly surprised once he tasted it. I followed the recipe, but added some minced veggies I needed to use up. So tender and yummy!

This is not only the best meat loaf I've ever made, it's the best meat loaf I've ever had! My husband and I loved it. It tastes great and and it actually cuts into slices! My other meat loaves tended to break up when I tried to slice them.  I did saute the onions first and used store bought Italian bread crumbs, otherwise by the recipe. Like a meat loaf should be! I'm thrilled with this recipe and I'll make it again and again.

Just served this for dinner tonight.  It was fast to prepare and easy to put together.  Turned out to be delicious and moist.  Served it with boiled potatoes, carrots and corn.  There was enough left over for lunch tomorrow.

Sorry, but this had no flavour at all.  It was mushy, bland, and the sauce was way too sweet.  (I even added garlic and extra spices)  I will not be making this again.

We love this recipe! I use onion powder instead of onions and use the Italian style breadcrumbs for more flavor. I usually have to cook it more like 1hr 15minutes to totally cook it through.

I have made this again and again since finding this recipe.  Wonderful!  I do par boil my onions before I add them to the meat mixture.  Like others said needs more sauce, I just eyeball a little extra.

This meatloaf was fantastic!  I did take the advice of some other reviewers and sauteed the onions in butter and garlic and I added a little worcestershire sauce.  It was so moist.  Unfortunately, we will not have any leftovers because everyone ate it up!

This was an awesome Meatloaf! I'm by no means a meatloaf fan and wanted to do something with ground meat I had left over. I've read the reviews and don't understand how everyone is using 1 to 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar. The recipe only calls for 2 TABLESPOONS of brown sugar. I didn't have any so I substitued Pancake Syrup as another reviewer did and it was awesome! We had 3 helpings!

I was very disappointed with how this meatloaf turned out, especially given such high reader ratings. I always make Betty Crocker's meatloaf, and even though it is a great loaf, I decided to try a different one. Unfortunately, this dish turned out mushy and very much lacking in flavor. The only thing I liked about it was the ketchup and brown sugar sauce, but even that I altered after reading reviews. I will not use this meatloaf recipe again, but if I were to change anything about it i would add a handful of sharp cheddar cheese to it and I would recommend using Italian seasoned bread crumbs to help develop flavor. Also, it took at least 15 minutes longer to bake than the recipe claimed, so make sure to allot for the extra baking time!

I am brand new to cooking so anything with "easy" in the title gets my attention. Even though I have a reputation for ruining dinner, this came out awesome! Since my husband usually does all of the cooking and he tends to be pretty set in his ways, I wasn't too confident in making meatloaf not done the way he is used to. But boy am I glad I did! I followed the suggestions of the others and added Worchestershire sauce and  sauteed the onions before I added them. It was so moist and and the sauce was delicious! But the best thing of all -- my husband loved it!  I've never had meatloaf prepared this way but now can't imagine preparing it differently!

This is literally the perfect basic meatloaf. The glaze is delicious. You can jazz this up with a TBSP of Worcestshire sauce, but I have made it without and it tastes just fine. I also often buy meatloaf mix (beef/veal/pork) rather than just ground beef and that tastes fine too. This is great for dinner and great on sandwiches the next day.

This was delicious and easy to make!  The topping was really yummy and gave it a nice flavor.  I made two changes...I used quick oats instead of bread crumbs and I added green pepper along with the onion.  Very pleased with this recipe...very moist meatloaf.....thanks!!

1. Way too sweet (why the brown sugar???) 2. Could not hold its form(1 more egg would help). The addition of milk was a poor choice. No garlic?

Excellent! I, too, followed many of the reviewers advice and added Worcestershire sauce, sauteed the onion and some garlic in butter, and also added a chopped red pepper, which I also sauteed. Instead of putting the sauce on top, I added the mustard, a small can of tomato paste and a small can of tomato juice, and also used Italian-style breadcrumbs. I sprinkled a bit of leftover provolone cheese on top for the final 10 minutes, which melted and was nice and bubbly on top. It tasted DELICIOUS!

Even utilizing the 2 tablespoons of brown sugar made the glaze for this meatloaf unappetizing.  The sugar cooked throughout the meat making the overall taste too sweet.

This is a lot like my meatloaf but I like mine better. I do not like meatloaf with a bunch of stuff in it or any sauce on top. I use 1 lb (no leaner than 80/20 or it's too dry), 2/3 c milk, 1/4c ketchup, 1 egg, 1/2 cup bread crumbs, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper. A few tips: DO NOT overwork the meat or it will end up dry and tough--mix all the ingredients and then put meat in least and mix up by hand until combined. I never use a loaf pan.. always a 9x13. And like i said, don't use lean meat or it will be dry and tough. 80/20 is fine and should be fall apart moist.

I made this twice and loved it each time. I need to remember to bake it in a loaf pan so it will look like a loaf. Very delicious!! I followed the comments to double the sauce since I like it with more sauce.

This is my "Base" meatloaf recipe. I actually substitue 1lb Ground Chicken and then use 1/2lb beef or sausage..whatever I have on hand.. it looks really weird, but tastes great and is probably saving me from a clogged artery. I also add some crushed garlic and a good handful of celery..Okay okay I know I changed things..but like I said, this is a good base..

Been making this meatloaf for about 22 years now; got it from my former mother in law. The only difference is we use oats instead of bread crumbs. I have actually converted a handful of confirmed meat-loaf haters into lovers of it, with this recipe.

When I told my family I made meatloaf for dinner they all snarled up the noses, but after tasting this recipe they ALL HAD SECONDS. I followed some reviewers recommendations. Sauteed onion and garlic in butter. Added more ketchup and reduced the mustard. Cooked longer than 1 hour. Very easy and tasty!

Generally, I'm not crazy about meatloaf and I dislike ketchup, but I decided to make this recipe for my husband who really likes both.  I couldn't believe how much I loved this meatloaf!  The ketchup topping is what made it for me.  Try this recipe, it's great!  Thanks for sharing this recipe Janet!

I can't name any redeeming qualities about this recipe. It's fast food meatloaf. I'm a sucker for a new recipe like the next person but this one has done me wrong. If you have a taste for a nice juicy meatloaf, skip this one, you'll thank me.

I love this meatloaf took me just a few minutes to put together and it was fantastic. I grated a whole onion just because the kids complain when they find a onion in their food. I would also double the topping next time. Sometimes simple recipes are truly the best

I found the bread to meat ratio a little too high for our tastes, but overall one of my better meatloaf attempts.  I also sauteed the onions with a half of a green pepper finely diced, for a little extra flavor.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had hands down! I followed the other reviewers such as the worchestershire sauce and sauteing the onions beforehand. I might cook it for just a bit longer as I use a little more beef than it called for. Excellent!!

Best meatloaf ever!  I always had trouble baking in a loaf pan, then I tried using a 9x12 glass baking dish and formed the loaf in the middle of the dish.  It cooked perfectly!  Even my Mother-in-Law loves this recipe.. Thanks for sharing!

Very good. I did add green pepper. I diced it and sauteed it with onion and fresh minced garlic. Then added it to the meat.

Awesome.  I've made this twice now, and my boyfriend has gobbled it up both times!  The second time I made it, I used 1 pound of ground beef and 1/2 pound ground pork and it was even better.  Definitely make double the sauce.

This was ok for meatloaf.  I think it would have been better with Vegetable flavored Ritz crackers instead of the bread crumbs and I didn't care for the Brown sugar in the sauce.  I did saute the onions and garlic in butter and that was great.  I doubled the egg second time around also.  It was good but not awesome...I will try one more time with a little more seasoning and see how I feel at that time.

Sorry... this was not a hit in our house.  While it was moist, the flavor was not that of meatloaf as we know it.

I was nervous to make this for the first time but it turned out so delicious that I made it twice in one week and shared with others. Saute the onions with garlic, add some Worcestershire sauce, and double the sauce recipe and it will be awesome!

This was REALLY moist!! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it was almost too moist! I baked it for an hour and 15 minutes and the meat was cooked through but it was so moist the pieces fell apart as I cut them! Don't know what to do different, maybe bake it another 15-30 min? Anyway, highly recommended anyway! I did as the others said and sauteed the onion with 1t of garlic and added 1T of worchestershire. yum!

I made this tonight on a whim, it was very good, used less milk than called for, guesstimated the amount of bread crumbs, and added worcestershire sauce to meatloaf mix - very good, not too dry, just right!!! Sauce was great!!! A keeper!

This is the best meatloaf my husband and I have ever had! Neither one of us were big fans of meatloaf growing up, but this one blew them both out of the water! The only problem I had was it was really juicy? I used turkey meat so that might be why, next time I will keep it in a little longer. I used others advice and doubled the sauce, adding more or less of ingredients till I found the perfect taste. I also added Worcestershire sauce as someone suggested..wonderful! I do suggest also sauteing your onions and adding about 2 to 3 cloves of garlic..per taste, and oregano and basil to the meat as well.

I've made this meatloaf for 37 years!! I grew up on it! We put a 1/4 - 1/2 tsp of sage in it - an extra egg - and for the piquant sauce we put 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. ALWAYS make 2 - 3 times the sauce to serve with the loaf. Also we didn't put it on the meatloaf till it was about 15 minutes to being ready - that way when you pour the grease off during the cooking time (which gets rid of a lot of fat)the sauce won't get thrown away also.  THERE IS NO OTHER MEATLOAF.  P.S. it's great to make sandwiches with!!

Pretty good basic recipe for meatloaf, but it definitely needed a few more ingredients. I added some finely chopped bell pepper, a few shots of worcestershire, a heavy sprinkling of granulated garlic, Italian seasoning and a big dollop of the glaze mix. While mom and I enjoyed it, we did feel it was still rather bland. Texture was perfect, though! Hubby and kids were less impressed, so I don't think I'll be making it again. Thanks for letting us try!

Excellent. My teenage kids raved about it. I shredded a carrot to mix in with the meat but otherwise followed recipe. Will keep this as my new meatloaf recipe. Edit: I have now made this meatloaf many times and it gets rave reviews each time. Thank you for such a great recipe.  BTW I usually use flavored breadcrumbs in it. Sometimes I add shredded carrot, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I use fresh onion and sometimes dried, minced onion. It comes good every time.

Just a little tweaking. About 2 1/2 lbs. ground beef, 1/2 onion shredded, 2 cloves garlic, 1 c. ritz crackers smashed with rolling pin, 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 egg, 1 c. milk, salt and pepper. Formed in 9X13. 3/4 c ketchup, 4 tbsp mustard, 6 tbsp bwn sugar. Baked for 1 hr 10 min. YUM!

This was a hit.  I've had a hard time finding a good meatloaf recipe - but this will be my go to for meatloaf.  Family raved over it.  I listened to the other reviews and added Worcestershire sauce, Italian bread crumbs (flavored) and extra ketchup.  I also had chopped celery and carrots and onions left over so I sautéed them in butter and added those.

Very good!  I did some additions/alterations as others suggested and it was excellent.  Sauted onions and add minced garlic in a pan with olive oil.  Added 2-3 tsp of Worcestershire sauce.  And added 2-3 tsp of Italian seasonings.

Delicious! I am fairly new to cooking so this was my first time making meatloaf for my husband, and it was amazing! I love recipes like this one that are simple, easy to follow, and turn out great. I also read the many reviews and suggestions and sautéed the onion with butter and minced garlic before adding it. I also used 1/2 tablespoon less brown sugar than the recipe called for in my glaze  and it came out perfectly cooked in an hour and 10 mins. Thanks for another great recipe and to all those more qualified reviewers who gave such excellent suggestions on how to tweak it!

Update: after making this recipe an additional few times I tried just making it as written (because I forgot to sauté the onions) and my husband I both liked it better with the raw onion mixed right in before cooking because the flavor and texture was better then when I precooked the onions with the garlic!

Absolutely fantastic! Our family (esp. the kids) seldom eat beef and this loaf has got everyone wanting a second serving, I ran out as I only made half the recipe.

Like other reviewers, I sautee the onion with a bit of garlic first. I used red onion but don't think it would make a difference. I used double the amount of egg (simply because half a recipe is 1/2 egg, which would leave the other half useless). I also added a sprinkle of fresh chopped spring onion and 1 stick celery (chopped) in the loaf mixture. For breadcrumbs I just chopped up 2 slices of wholewheat toasted toast in a food processor.

The sauce is the highlight. Like other reviewers, I doubled the amount of sauce, and it came out very juicy.

I did not care for this.  If you are going to change the ingredients drastically as suggested in the comments, it's a completely different recipe.

This was very good. It has a dense, even texture that slices easily, essential for sandwiches. I used about 1-1/2 lbs of ground beef, with about 1/2 lb ground pork, and it took a full 2 hours to cook, and that was even turning the oven up first to 420 and finally to 450°! So by the time we ate, we were all good and hungry! -:) I only had plain breadcrumbs, so I added generous amounts of oregano, basil, marjoram and garlic
powder. I used a couple Tbl of dry minced onion instead of fresh, and just under 1 C of milk. I also added about 2 tsp Worstershire, and used bottled BBQ sauce for the top glaze.
My husband said I should use this recipe for all future meatloafs, so thiat's high praise!

UPDATE: Not long after I wrote this, I discovered that my oven has serious problems maintaining temperature! So you all should probably ignore that bit about taking so long to bake!

This has been our family's favorite meatloaf recipe for over a year! We simply double the brown sugar, mustard and ketchup for more sauce on top.

Very good and very easy.  A bit sweeter than I like normally so will probaby cut back on the brown sugar a bit.  Used 2 lbs of meat but doubled the sauce since I heard a lot of people saying it needed more but I ended up only using half of it so stick to the recipe; it doesn't need any additional sauce IMO.

Made this last night and came out pretty tasty!  The only thing I would change next time is to take out the brown sugar...I think it made the topping too sweet, I would just use ketchup with a dab of mustard!  Overall, it was a good recipe for meatloaf though!

Was pretty tasty, but I made a couple of changes. Lacking a fresh onion, I used some dried, minced onion (around a teaspoon and a half), added some garlic (about a teaspoon), and we're not big ketchup fans in this house, so I used barbeque sauce. I also used plain sugar instead of brown, since I realized I didn't have any halfway through making this. The end result was good, the crust being the best part!

Very easy and yummy. I used this recipe and added some changes. I used Saltines instead of breadcrumbs and sauteed the onions. I also added a little of A1, Worcestershire sauce, parsley. Very moist and the topping was tasty.

It was a pretty good meatloaf.  I did exactly as recipe but added some gr. pork (probably not nessisary) and 2 tbsp of worcester.  Didn't do onions because of kids but it would be better that way.  Very good and everyone liked it.  (reduced milk and crumbs a bit)

This is a pretty good basic meatloaf recipe.  I thought it called for too much bread crumbs. If you arent really a fan of sweet sauce skip the sugar.  I made it twice.  I did not use sugar the second time.  The ketchup was still a little sweet for me.

This is the best meatloaf ever!!! I've made this several times and I've followed the advice of a couple of people. I double the sauce which is yummy and leave out the brown sugar. I also add a little worchestire to the meatloaf mix as well as to the sauce. I brown onion and garlic and add that to the mix as well. Will definitely make again!!! This is now a family staple!!

This was soooo good! I did use over 2 lbs of hamburger. What I did is add about 1 1/4c. milk, 1 1/4 c. Italian bread crumbs, 1 T. worcestershire sauce, 2 cloves minced garlic and half of a green pepper with the onion and sauteed them in butter. Also doubled the sauce but used 2 T. spicy mustard and 2 T. yellow mustard and that took away some of the sweetness of the brown sugar. Made it in 2 small loaf pans which worked great and drained fat off occasionally. Meatloaf stayed together really well and it was very flavorful. It was delicious! Definately will make again and again. Thanks for the great recipe Janet!

There's not much to say about this meatloaf except that it is delicious.  The sauce is pretty sweet, so if you don't like sweet and tangy meatloaf, you probably should leave out some of the brown sugar.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and I loved it.  I will definitely bookmark this one and make it again!

I accidentally put all ingredients together before I baked this, we thought it was great! Sweet is not overpowering. Went great with roasted potatoes.

I used 2 lbs ground beef, 2 eggs, and a packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix (instead of the chopped onion). Also added 1/3 c ketchup into the meatloaf mix. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise and it was AWESOME! Super easy. Made great sandwiches with the leftovers.

Easy to make, went over well. Coarsely chopped the onion so kids picked it out, adults had no problem with it! Held firm too. Used 80% lean ground beef.

As an "easy meatloaf" this does deserve 5 stars.  Everyone loved it.  Be sure to check with a meat thermometer though.  Mine was only at 140 degrees after an hour.  Needs to be 160-170.  I cooked it to 160 and it was totally moist.  Thanks for posting it!

This is the blandest meatloaf I ever had.  My husband liked it but he had ketchup all over it.  I guess I'll try it again w/ something the spice it up.  I also broiled a few min at the end of cooking to get the glaze to not be so runny.  It's hard to believe 733 review w/ 4 1/2 stars?

I've been using similar recipe from Hunt's for many years.  Original recipe called for 3/4 cup water and 1/2 cup tomato sauce.  The sauce topping is what makes this recipe great: I use 2 tbsp brown sugar, 2 tbsp mustard, 1 tbsp red wine vinegar and 1 cup tomato sauce.

We really loved this meatloaf, it was so moist and flavorful. Leftovers the next day warmed up very nicely in the microwave, still moist. It really is a no fail meatloaf!

This was really good, my hubby liked it very well and so did I, I gave it 4 *'s cause I think the next time I make it I will double the brown sugar, mustard, and ketchup and put a little in the meat mix, and cut the mild down by half just to give the meat a little more zest. Bake time was right on, and it did taste very good. Thanks for sharing.

Made my first meatloaf with this recipe. Now it is the only one I use. The family loved it, Only thing I modified was the brown sugar and ketcup, I doubled both and came out great. Thank you for this easy recipe.

MMMMMMMM!! really good recipe. i did add some meat rub and worcestershire to it. let it sit in fridge for an hour or so before cooking. recipe doesn't say to cover or not, i cover it with foil, then take off foil and bake for another 15 minutes. put a couple slices of bread at the bottom of the pan to soak up the grease.  yummy!!

My first meatloaf - I don't think it stole the hearts of anyone in the fam, but it was really a decent change to the dinner line up that I'll probably cook again.  Made similar changes other mentioned - lined pan with foil, added some W Sauce to the mix, sauteed onion in butter with some bell pepper before mixing, doubled the sauce mixture for the top, used turkey instead of beef.

So yummy! My first time making meat loaf, but with this recipe it will not be my last! I didn't have brown sugar so I used a few pinches of white sugar. I also added the topping in the meat by mistake, so I just squirted some ketchup on top to make it look pretty. I liked this recipe because it didn't call for the onion dip/or soup like the other ones I saw... I didn't have it!

Oh yeah we ate meatloaf sandwiches the next day but I didn't know how to make them. (special sauce or something?) I just buttered some wheat bread and sliced up the meat about 1/2 an inch. They were very delicious but I wasn't sure if something else usually goes on them... any suggestions?

We really loved this meatloaf!  From now on this will be the recipe I will use.  Maybe it was just my oven, but I had to cook it an extra 10-15 minutes.  Also, I did saute the onions in butter as others had suggested, and it worked perfectly.  Finally, I used a glass 9x13 dish instead of a loaf pan, which made glazing the meatloaf, cutting it, and cleaning up easier, in my opinion.  Thank you!

Wonderful! This meatloaf was very easy and my son and husband loved it. I used seasoned breadcrumbs and minced onion instead of a fresh chopped onion(time crunch). Next time I will probably make double the amount of the ketchup and brown sugar topping.

This is the best meatloaf I ever tasted!  So simple, yet so perfect.  The only thing I changed, was that I browned the onions in butter before mixing them in.  It gives them a slight sweetness, and takes away the crunch.  I also used less mustard on top.  Thanks for sharing!

This was the best!!!!  I think the milk was the secret to keeping it moist.  The mustard was a great twist.  I used dijon mustard.  You must try it!

Quick and easy!!! It was very moist and tasty. I didn't have any brown sugar so I used about 1/4 cup of pancake syrup. My daughter hates onions, so I used onion soup mix instead and I also added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce. Hubby and I both loved it. Daughter not too crazy over it(she hates meat loaf anyway!)

I thought this meatloaf was delicious, but my husband didn't like the sweet sauce. Also the sauce was way too much, I would suggest trying half quantities.

I use this recipe with some variations based on what is available - but my one tip is this: instead of mixing in a a bowl, I add all the ingredients to a 1 gallon freezer bag - then do all the mixing in there. It lets me do a very thorough mix without getting my hands greasy.  Then, I actually use the freezer bag to shape the meatloaf - and release it into the pan by slicing the bottom of the bag with a knife or pair of kitchen scissors.  This gives me a nicely mixed and perfectly shaped loaf.

This is a great recipe.  We arn't fans of the sauced top so we have our meatloaf with mashed potatoes gravy and cream corn.  But this meatloaf was so incredibly moist. 
Definitely, I will be making this again.

I've mad this meatloaf twice already and it was wonderful.  I sautéed the onion, added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, doubled the ketchup mix and used seasoned bread crumbs. Thanks for the recipe!

I was a little uneasy about the 1 cup of milk as I have never used milk in meatloaf before.  But I was pleasantly pleased!  This meatloaf was very good and I didn't change anything and followed the recipe exactly.  I wouldn't change a thing except cooking it just a little it longer to get a sort of crust on the meatloaf.  Oh, I may use a little less mustard too.  But this is certainly a keeper recipe!

I loved it!! It was so easy and turned out great!
I changed just a few things...
I used barbecue sauce and pancake syrup instead of ketchup and brown sugar. I made extra sauce and added it on the plate. 
I sautéed the onions in butter and a little sugar to put on top of the finished product, too. 
YUM!!!

Very good base to the recipe, so I gave it a like.  Members additions/modifications is what makes it a 5 star:(Doubling ketchup mixture, sauteeing onions beforehand, adding worcestershire to the meat mixture)

We both thought it was the best meatloaf we ever had.  Of course we came from Moms that just couldn't figure it out, as a result, I rarely make meatloaf.  That all changes now!!

I made this dish twice. It is the best meatloaf I have ever taste. I made the same recipe, except for the glaze I doubled the mustard and ketchup. I made them in the cupcake pan and left them in the oven for 15 minutes.
It turned out super tasty.

best meatloaf that I've ever made. I used about 2.5 lbs. of ground beef. Following some of the advice of others as well as adding a few of my own tweaks, the meatloaf was perfect. Here's what I did: 1. I sautéed finely chopped onion, 3 cloves (minced garlic) & 1 green bell pepper stalks  with butter ; then added it to the ground beef. 2. I added 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to the ground beef mixture along with 2 eggs instead of 1, 1 1/4 cup of milk & about 1 1/2 cup of dried Italian bread crumbs. 3. For the sauce: I initially made it as the directions indicated with 2 TBSP. of brown sugar, and found it to be way too sweet. I then added 1/3 more ketchup and a couple of dashes of Worcestershire Sauce and it was perfect. 4. It was an abundance of sauce, and a lot of the other reviews said that there wasn't enough sauce, so I spooned a thin layer at the bottom of the loaf, molded half the loaf, then sauced the top, and then added the rest of the loaf on top and sauced it really well. This was absolutely perfect. 5. Lastly, i cooked the meatloaf covered for 45 minutes, drained most of any accumulated liquid and cooked uncovered for an additional 30 minutes. This was super moist and delicious!!!!!

The best meatloaf I have ever had. The sauce was absolutely perfect and the only thing I did differently was to use an onion soup packet instead of an onion. My new go-to recipe for meatloaf.

This meatloaf is delish & truly is easy! We used half Italian breadcrumbs, half ritz crackers. We also added some Worchestshire sauce to the mixture. I also added onion & garlic powder (just a habit i suppose). & the most important tip--- DOUBLE THE SAUCE! its too good to have the bare minimum.  this meatloaf is excellent!

This recipe is actually pretty good, and is super easy to make. The pros are the taste-it's very good! I personally didn't find the sauce too sweet at all and felt it was just right. I WAS a bit worried at first, but I'm glad I didn't change the amount of brown sugar. I probably will add a little more of everything though to make it a larger amount of sauce for next time. The one thing about this loaf I didn't like was that it was a bit too mushy. I think if I used 1/2 cup of bread crumbs instead this meatloaf would have been pretty perfect. Will be trying again with some adjustments, including cooking the onions (and a little minced garlic) in some butter before mixing it in.

We love this recipe! So glad I found it!! I can cook it in my crock-pot, instant pot or oven and I know it will turn out delicious! My husband told me that he had never liked meatloaf! Now it's a regularly requested item! I've doubled the mixture and froze one for another meal or give it to a friend for a quick evening meal.

I did try this and just as it smelled while cooking, it turned out marvelous! I used 1/2 cup of mushrooms, 1/2 cup of green peppers and a large onion, all finely diced and fried them in butter before adding them to the meat. I lined the meat with bacon before putting it in the oven, I had to cover it during the last 15 minutes of baking, as to avoid overbrowning of the bacon, aluminum foil does that nicely! I read many complaints on here as to the baking times and how people reduce stars due to that fact..I have recently purchased a new oven and I find that many things I have baked or even cooked previously require longer or shorter cooking times due to the new oven..not all ovens cook the same, you have to play with it a little sometimes. Love this meatloaf Recipe and so does my Family!

This turned out pretty good, however I think next time I would use less bread crumbs - we thought it was a little mushy which is why I deducted a star.  I sauteed the onion in some butter first as others suggested. The sauce was yummy and reminded me of a sticky tangy spare rib sauce. I lined the pan in foil and greased it but it really stuck to the foil so I think next time I will just cook it in a well greased pan. I made it with some garlic mashed and steamed carrots and it was good comfort food.I think I will make this recipe again just with a few adjustments.

Everybody loved it!  I followed Redhotnubian's recipe (w/the worchester sauce & sauteeing onions, tons of garlic) under the most helpful critical reviews & then Kayleigh111387's sauce recipe also under the most critical reviews since my husband loves barbque sauce.  I added onion salt, and pepper.  I made an entire loaf last night and it's almost gone today between only by husband, me, & my visiting Grandmother.  With an extra person it would have been gone the same night.  Delicious!

My husband loved the recipe exactly as is, I'm going to have to make a few modifications next time I make it for me to enjoy it. I'll only use half an onion, chop it very finely, and saute it in some butter first. The onions were a bit overwhelming to me. The moisture of the meatloaf was really great though! The loaf needs a little more seasoning...will probably add some worcestershire and garlic powder and double to sauce on top. Husband suggested mixing some of the sauce in with the meatloaf mixture.

I cut the milk to 1/4 cup though, because the mixture was wet enough....

Wow. This is fantastic! I added the 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce and sauteed the onion with some garlic like some other users recommended and it turned out amazingly. I made it for my bf to take out of town with him for work. We just tried a bite after supper to see how it came out. Then we had another bite and wished we hadn't already eaten. I may have to hide it until he leaves. Thanks, Janet, for the excellent recipe!

This meatloaf was good. However I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it was a bit sweet for me everyone else loved it. My sister said the sauce was tangy which is different for meatloaf and she thought it was great! I did sauté the onion in butter like someone else had mentioned. I also used seasoned bread crumbs and a little worchestire sauce in the meat mix. I did double the sauce but found it to be too much. I will be trying this recipe again because I love meatloaf and this recipe was moist unlike some other meatloaf i've tried. I will however cut down on the sugar. Thank You!

My family likes this, I tweaked it quite a bit during the process however, not only because I was serving 4 people but because by the description and reviews I hear its a little bland..so the glaze ingredients i decided, i would incorporate into the meatloaf itself, now keep in mind i adjusted all of the ingredients, so whatever was in the glaze i put in the meatloaf itself (except milk) then i formed a loaf and topped it off with a second glaze in a smaller proportion. It was delicious and moist. I'm actually glad that I changed it while making it.:) liked it very much!

this was excellent and SUPER easy! I've always just made meatloaf not following any specific recipe and just thought it was something I wasn't good at making. I found this recipe to not only be very easy to follow but also very moist, flavorful, and every last bite was eaten by me and my family (who are picky eaters!). I would highly recommend this to anyone as it is very simple and worth trying.

Really liked this; it was so simple and moist. I added Worcestershire sauce and put the brown sugar, mustard, and ketchup in the meatloaf mix. Just before serving, I put more ketchup on the top.

This was a great recipe. I did add the 1T of Worshestire sauce to the mix. I also doubled the toppings recipes based on the previous reviews.  I would have given it 5 stars if my son liked it.

great recipe!  My dad was a chef for 30 years (and still cooks so much at his house) and his meatloaf was the only one I could ever really eat.  This tastes so much like his and reminds me of being young.  My finace and son LOVE this recipe, which stinks because then there doesnt leave much for leftovers and I LOVE leftovers!  Thanks for the sweet recipe!

This is my go-to recipe for meatloaf. So yummy! My whole family loves it! Only thing I do differently is saute the onions before adding them...or I skip out on the onions and just use onion powder.

This is a very good base recipe, one way to change it up is, instead of bread crumbs try adding stove top stuffing, I like it with the savory herbs stuffing mix, but don't be afraid to try others.  Also adding worcestershire sause will help improve this dish.

This was a very good recipe! I did make small adjustments to suit my taste. I used 2.25 lbs of ground beef, 2 eggs, 1 cup green onion, 1 1/4 cups milk, 1 1/4 cups regular bread crumbs, salt, pepper, garlic powder, seasoning salt, Italian seasoning, and worcestershire sauce. I cooked for 1 hour and 15 minutes but for the hour I put aluminum foil over the loaf to ensure the whole loaf cooked evenly and in the last 15 minutes I put the topping and allowed the loaf to brown slightly. Then I let it rest for about 20 minutes before cutting, which allowed for even and non crumbled pieces, just the way I like it. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a simple recipe. Even with all the additions it only took 7 minutes to assemble for me.

This was excellent!  I too added about a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and sauteed the onions in a little butter and garlic just for a few minutes until the onions were softened.  Also doubled the sauce on top!  I will definitely make this again.

This was the best meatloaf that I had made!  It is full of flavor and juicy and best of all, very basic and easy to make!  I didn't use the chopped onion(husband doesn't like them), so i used onion powder.  I added 2 chopped garlic gloves, sprinkeled paprika, dried parsley, seasoned salt(Lawry's), pepper and garlic powder.  I didn't use the glaze for the top, just used ketchup.  Excellent!

This recipe was easy to make. I followed the previous recommendations to saute the onions and that made the meat taste good. I personally DIDN'T like the sauce. I just put ketchup... but that might just be me.

First of all, I don't cook.  Scrambled eggs, french toast, bacon at best.  But I've decided this year, at age 58, I'm going to learn to cook.  This was my very first attempt at making meatloaf and it turned out delicious!  My wife was shcoked to come home to the smell of meatloaf in the oven.  Anyway, I did triple the sauce as several people recommended (although I only doubled the brown sugar to cut down on sweetness) and I added some sliced olives since I've always liked olives in my meatloaf.  I can't wait to eat the last little bit of the meatloaf fun lunch today!  Maybe I can lear to cook afterall.

Awesome recipe!  My mods are:
-1 lb of g.beef and 1 lb of g.pork
-3/4C of milk instead of 1C, 
-1 small clove of mince garlic to meat mixture, 
-1Tbl of Worcestershire sauce to meat mixture, 
-broil on high for 10 minutes to get a crispy shell at 500 before adding sauce
-use BBQ sauce (non-hickory) instead of ketchup
-triple the BBQ sauce and mustard (but not the sugar)

I've made this about 6 times varying the ingredients to perfection.

This is a very easy and very basic meatloaf recipe.  It was alright, but we like our food spicy, (meaning flavorful not peppery), so this was very plain to our taste.  I would have preferred that the recipe had given an amount of salt and pepper instead of "to taste."  I can't taste raw meat to see if there is too little or too much salt and had to hope I added enough.  I tweaked the sauce based on what others have suggested and found it to be very nice.

Delicious. My husband made this and added his own twist by grinding up mushroom (about a cup and half) in the food processor) and adding those to the mixture. Tasted great and the kids had no idea there were mushrooms in the meatloaf.

Great recipe, great taste.  serve with mac n cheese - ummmm!!!!! I did take advantage of the aforementioned adjustments from other reviews.  BUT just one more thing...
Try putting 2 bread slices in the bottom of a glass loaf pan - it helps absorb some of the meat fats,  Just cut it off before serving!!  However my son loves that part, too!!  Go figure teenagers!!!
Thanks for the great taste!!!!

I make this meatloaf all the time.  This one has become a kid favorite!  Can't get much easier than this recipe.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Kids could not tell a difference!  Much healthier.

I made this for dinner and received rave reviews. I used 2.5 lbs of meat and made two loaves. And I only doubled the ingredients for the brown sugar/ketchup/mustard mixture. I also used dejan for the mustard.

Good base recipe for meatloaf.  I use 1/2 and 1/2 mixture of ground beef and ground pork; reduce milk to 1/2 cup; add parsley, onion powder, garlic powder, garlic, paprika, seasoned salt and worcestershire sauce and then adjust mustard and brown sugar amounts to taste in ketchup topping.  To make things easier and ensure the meatloaf comes out moist I cook it in the crock pot on low for 8 hours.

Great go-to basic meatloaf. I think that is the point of this recipe. If you want to add things to it go ahead but rate this as-is then make suggestions. There is an option now to tweak the recipes. I love it. That way I can see what other people are doing with their own version of meatloaf and decide accordingly.

I did as some suggested: Seasoned bread crumbs, sauteed the onions and doubled the "sauce" on the top. It was good. But there still seemed to be something lacking in the loaf portion (maybe garlic?). It needed to have the sauce on top to add enough flavor. Still good and will probably repeat it for another day!

Very good.  Hadn't had meatloaf in years, and truly enjoyed this one.  I did add 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to loaf and doubled glaze.  Also per recommendations I sauteed the onion and some garlic slightly before adding.  Will make again.

Easy and full of flavor. Like other members, I too sauted some chopped onions and green bell peppers and a clove of garlic prior to adding it to the rest of the ingredients. I added a tablespoon of low sodium Worcestershire sauce to the meat. I added some BBQ sauce to the sauce ingredients as well. Will definately make again.

That was great! I really liked the brown sugar on it. Nice touch. I changed the bread crumbs to panko. You'll love the texture. It really changes it up some.

Since I don't eat meat I become a little skeptical of the taste, but followed this exactly, with my own small addition of 1tbsp. worchestershire sauce on top before the sauce mix.  My husband loved eating it while I loved how easy it was to make.  This was EXTREMELY MOIST!!!!!

Wow~ Being a big meatloaf lover this recipe really hit the spot for my family and I. This recipe was simple to make but I think I used too little ketchup in the topping making a mustard a bit overpowering. Oops...my mistake! 

One thing I will mention though was I thought adding the brown sugar would make it taste a bit sweet. Turns out none of my family noticed the sugar at all. The meatloaf was simply too delicious!

My go to recipe for meatloaf- it's perfect and easy. We love to tweak it as well just to shake it up once in awhile. I love adding cheddar cheese to it as well.
It also works fabulous with ground turkey.
Thanks for sharing.

This meatloaf is delicious!  Like other raters, I added sauteed onions, red, green & yellow peppers and worcestershire sauce.  Instead of adding additional salt, I added a pack of meatloaf seasoning and plain bread crumbs.  The glaze is so good!  I usually dont like mustard.

I love this meatloaf. I have made it four times now and it is so flavorful and tender.
I mistakenly put the sauce mixture into the meatloaf and baked it and it was very good! So my mistake led to another tasty variation of this fine dish.

Wow Wow Wow... my husband hates meatloaf, but he LOVED this recipe!  I followed the customization recommended by other reviewers:

1. Sauted the onion in butter
2. Use seasoned bread crumbs (did not have a full cup, so I mixed with crushed saltines) 
3. Doubled the ketchup mixture and reduced the amount of mustard a tad 
4. Added 1 tbsp Worchestershire in the meat mix 

This meatloaf was moist and delicious. We will definitely make again!

I threw all the ingredients in, with exception of mustard, which i didn't use.  I covered the top with plain tomato sauce out of a can.  I also used seasoned bread crumbs.  I also increased the cook time to 1.25 hours.  I would suggest cooking at 375 for 1 hour if you want more of a solid loaf.

I have a family of picky eaters. When everyone like something it's a happy day. Everyone loved the meatloaf. They said it tasted like McD's cheeseburgers. I guess that made the kids really happy.

I thought this was a great starter recipe for me. I added and took a way things according to my taste preferences. So I made this according to the recipe for my first attempt and went from there :-)! *Chopped carrots, bell pepper, and celery work great for this recipe.

WOW!  Amazing...1st time I've ever rated something but had to! We both had seconds and would have more if we weren't so full!  Made the following changes - used 1 lb grass fed organic beef, 3/4 cup goat yogurt instead of milk, sauteed onion in garlic and butter, added grated zucchini (approx 1/3 cup) and dried basil, oregano and thyme (approx 1 tsp each).  For the glaze mixed 1/2 cup ketchup with 2 heaping TBSP maple syrup, 1 tsp worcestershire sauce and 1TBSP balsamic & pepper mustard. Cooked 1hr 10 mins. Served with roasted zucchini and curried quinoa with apples, toasted almonds and dried apricots.
FAB-U-LOUS!

We enjoyed this recipe very much the topping was especially good. The only problem I had was it took me a lot longer to cook, then was wrote on the recipe.  The middle stayed pink, which gave me a little trouble by having to put it back in the oven a few times.  Maybe somehow it was my fault due to the pan or something?  The taste was great and it was nice to have moist meatloaf for a change.
Thank you for sharing!
I'll share it on my blog with others.

I gave this 5 starts after a few alterations :) I used onion soup mix instead of the onion and the seasoned bread crumbs that others suggested.  I used half the amount of brown sugar, as I like a little less sweet.  I like to broil on HI for 3 minutes, then let set for at least 8 to 10 minutes before serving.  Very flavorful, my 3 and 5-year-old daughters loved it.  Served with buttery mashed potatoes and green beans.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe. I did add just a few chopped, slices of jalapeños to the meatloaf since we usually eat spicy food in our home. I cooked the meatloaf for an hour on 350f. It was not fully cooked. I cooked it again for another half an hour and it was fully done. It was a little moist for my taste but overall, it was a good, easy recipe.

Super easy, quick and budget friendly! Double the sauce though and drizzle some over the sliced plated peices. The oven tends to dry out the sauce alot. Fantastic flavor!

This meatloaf was really good. The recipe was so simple that I didn't expect it to be so yummy. The amount of positive reviews this recipe received caught my eye and I'm glad it did! Everyone absolutely loved it! I did take some of the reviews additional advice and added a little bit of worcestorshire to the mix and it came out great!

It was my first attempt at making meatloaf and it came out great. Didn't give it 4 stars because it came out a little tough - maybe I overmixed it? I tried not to. I made it for Passover, so I substituted the milk for beef broth and the bread crumbs for crumbled up matzoh. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome! I didnt sautee my onions, I just added them to the meat mixture. To the sauce I put a little Worcestershire sauce and used dijon mustard and ketchup with the brown sugar and it turned out AMAZING! Easy, quick to whip together and the best meatloaf I've eaten in a long time!

Four words: quick, easy, awesome, delicious! I followed the advice of others and used seasonsed breadcrumbs (Italian) and added 1T worstershire sauce. I also doubled the ketchup and mustard but not the sugar (thought it might be too sweet). My 1 year old has been pretty finnicky about ground beef thus far but she gobbled it down and so did I! Will definitely make this again.

The Sauce alone Gets 5 stars! I would not have tried those 3 basic ingredients without this recipe! But i prefer more spices in the meat. Add a little worchestershire sauce & garlic powder, and you've got some goodness. I prefer using ground turkey & a dash of EVOO. Parsley and a few crumbled 7-grain crackers never hurt anyone, either!

Amazing meatloaf. I used about 2 pounds ground beef. Substituted doritos nacho cheese for breadcrumbs. Added good amount of garlic salt. Cooked onions with minced garlic, garlic salt and butter until brown. Added a little seasoned salt. Kept one cup milk and one egg. I added more brown sugar to the topping, I suggest doubling the topping like everybody suggests. Cooked for about 1 hour 10 minutes since I had more beef. Most delicious moist meatloaf ever. :)

This is my signature meatloaf! My friends and family love it and ask me to make it all the time. I do add about a tbs of worcestershire, sauteed onions and bell peppers and a 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. Just to give it a little kick!

The ketchup/mustard/brown sugar mixture are 3  of the 4 ingredients my family uses to make BBQ sauce, for those of you hesitant to use it or think its too sweet just substitute with your favorite bbq sauce! Recipe was simple, we cut the bread crumbs by 1/2.

Used a broiler pan and created a 2# meat log. Sauteed frozen diced onions until opaque in color. Added minced garlic. Added 1 TBSP of Worcestershire Sauce. The Sauce: Doubled the ketchup/brown sugar but not the mustard. Cooked for about 75 minutes for 175 degrees. Great results!

This recipe was exceptionally easy.  My husband and I both loved it.  I substituted bison meat for the ground beef and only used 1/2 an onion since my husband is not a huge fan of onion and this turned out excellently.  Thanks for sharing this super recipe.

True to the title, this is an excellent, easy recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added my own twists as well.
1) added sauteed onion, mushroom and green pepper, and crushed garlic.
2)doubled the sauce, and added a healthy tablespoon of A1 sauce for more bite.
3)added 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning (plain breadcrumbs)
4) lined pan with tinfoil.

This was outstanding!!! And as the title indicates, very easy to make.  My husband, who is not a fan of mustard, even liked this. Generally when he likes something a lot, he will say it's "not bad", but he actually said this was "really good!" Very high praise.  :-)  The sauce gives the meatloaf a nice sweet/tangy flavor.  

I only used half an onion and used italian flavored breadcrumbs.  I'll definitely be making this meatloaf again.

Very good and very moist meatloaf recipe.  My husband loved the topping, but since we were out of ketshup and I didn't know, I had to use BBQ sauce instead and it was really good.  Even my kids, who remain not big meatloaf lovers, ate half of the piece given to them...which is a half more than they've eaten with other recipes! LOL

This was the most amazing meatloaf I have ever had. It was very moist.  I sauteed the onions with some minced garlic in butter and used seasoned breadcrumbs.  I also doubled the ketchup in the topping but didn't double the mustard or brown sugar.  The topping was still very sweet.. I loved it, but if you aren't a fan of sweet, I would leave the sugar out.  It was overall very delicious and I will use this as my main meatloaf recipe from now on! (and delete the other one I have in my recipe box on here!)  Thanks :)

I've made a lot of meatloaf recipes and this actually turned out the best.  I added dashes of worcestershire and a few squirts of ketchup to the mix. I sauteed the onion in butter first.  I also used 93% lean meat. I had 2.25 lbs of meat so I upped ingredients accordingly but used 1 egg.   I hand shaped 2 loaves on a foil lined cookie sheet and for the topping just coated with ketchup.  Baked until therm said 160.  So simple yet really good.  Sadly no leftovers for sandwiches!

The texture and flavor came out perfect. My husband didn't care too much for the sweetness, but I thought that was the best part! Since I dont usually eat meatloaf, I figured I would have a small piece....turns out that wasn't enough this stuff is so amazing!  Also, make sure you save some of the sauce or make some additional after baking.

Very good meatloaf.  Only change I made was to add quite a bit of garlic powder.  Would definitely make again.

My husband just wondered if maybe we could have this meatloaf for Thanksgiving dinner, instead of turkey.  This is as billed- simple food, easy to make- wonderful for weeknight comfort food. Very moist, it held its shape but my children had no problem chewing it.  The topping is awesome, used a little more mustard and a little less sugar than recommended.  I added garlic to the onion and sauteed both.  Used a little less milk based on reviews, and added some William Sonoma Smoke House Rub for extra flavor.....oh yum, I can't wait to make it again. Thanks for the recipe!!!!

This a good recipe, very moist and tasty! i didn't have onions, so i used french fried onions instead (saves time on sauteeing) it tasted so good.  I also listened to the other reviewrs to double up on the sauce, and my husband loves this, I finally found the one.  My search is over.

You don't need so much milk if you don't have so many breadcrumbs.  The more breadcrumbs and milk the less you'll be able to really taste the flavor of the meat.  I used 2/3 cup of breadcrumbs and 1/4 cup of milk.  I added an extra egg and 1 T of dried parsley.  I liked the sauce for the top though.  GREAT recipe with changes - a little 'doughy' as is.  Also, flavored breadcrumbs can change everything - three cheese is my favorite.

My wife has to be the pickiest eater in the world. I started surfing this site so I could find good, easy to make recipes and then tweak them for her liking. My wife loved this recipe so much she had seconds. My wife getting seconds is like being told you are doing a great job by the President himself. Since my wife is picky the only thing I changed was the onion so I sauteed some shallots instead. Thanks to your recipe my wife calls me her Bobby Flay.

It was very good, but the sauce was a tad on the sweet side.  Next time I think it would be better to cut down a smidgen on the mustard, and maybe by 1/2 on the sugar.  I also changed the meat recipe a little and added onion powder to compensate for not having enough chopped onions on hand, and added parmesan cheese with some salt and pepper thrown in as well.  The meat was fantastic, but the sauce could use a little bit of tweaking in my opinion.

I thought this recipe was pretty bland.  I used more breadcrumbs and oatmeal together so it would be more firm.  I wont be making again.

This is really good!  Based on other reviews I sautéed my onion, left out the milk, and only put half the brown sugar in the glaze (next time I may just leave it out).  I used an 85/15 ground beef and it was still very moist so I won't hesitate to use ground sirloin next time to try to cut some of the fat.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely delicious.  I recalculated the servings down to 4 and made this tonight for my DIL and myself, with the following changes:  I substituted Peppridge Farm Herb stuffing for bread crumbs, and pre-soaked the crumbs in the milk.  Result was a moist delicious meatloaf.  Have already added it as a permanent recipe to my recipe box.

I have tried many meatloaf recipes and this was the most simple and by far the best recipe.  My husband said it was the best meatloaf he's ever had!  I used some of the other reviews and I sauted the onions with a little garlic before mixing and I also added one tablespoon of worcestershire.

Very good! Used dried onion flakes instead of raw onion. Added 1 tablespoon worchester sauce and 2 tablespoons horseradish. Doubled the sauce. Will make again.

I thought it was excellent!  Tasted wonderful and easy to make.  I thought it was a little moist while mixing, but decided to follow the recipe anyway.  It fell apart as I was slicing it.  I'll add a little more bread crumbs next time, but some may like it that moist.

I loved this recipe!  I modified it slightly based on other reviews.  Used the garlic flavored bread crumbs, a little worcestershire sauce, and sauteed the onions.  I also added two torn pieces of bread to it.  Very good meatloaf!  My husband and son loved it.  Even better the next day.

This is our favorite meatloaf hands down. We make it all the time! But...I add worcestershire sauce and parsley. We also cut up some red potatoes, coat them with olive oil and bake them right along with the meatloaf in the same pan. The sauce mixes in with the potatoes and...YUM!!! AWESOME!!!

A time saver is to place the ingredients in a food storage bag and squish them around until mixed. Turn out into a baking dish and toss away the bag.  No bowl with raw meat to deal with.  Another time saver -  cut down on baking time by using a mini loaf pan.

Both my husband and I have childhood fears of meatloaf.  However, since we recently bought half a cow, we needed new ways to cook ground beef. I decided to try this recipe and it was DE-LISH! I followed the recipe exactly as written and then added a coupe additional things 1.) 1 Tsp. of Worcestershire sauce, 1 Tsp. of Liquid Smoke, and 1 Tsp. of beef seasoning.  Highly recommend this recipe. It was even better as leftovers.

Love this easy, tasty recipe. It has so much flavor and I love that it is made with staple ingredients - no special trips to the store. We have this often and I use saltine cracker crumbs since that is usually what I have on hand. Thank you for sharing!

This was great!  My whole family really liked it (including my 2 year old!) Made a few changes that others listed:   -Sauted the onion before adding it to the meat -Use seasoned bread crumbs -Doubled the ketchup mixture and reduced the amount of mustard and brown sugar (don't like my meat too sweet) -Added 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce in the meat mix  - Put the loaf on a roasting pan b/c there was sooo much juice/grease that it spilled over into the oven

This recipe really lacked major flavour and the onion was overpowering. I wouldn't make this again. I love meatloaf, but this particular one was too bland for me.

** I thought that this didn't have much flavor, it was too moist. We didn't like the topping, too sweet. Every bite I took I felt like it was missing something, I had to scrape off the topping for the leftovers before I put it away. Brown gravy was so much better than that topping, but, then again, I have  discrimanating  taste buds. I've been told that I'm a great cook- it's a matter of opinion. I would recommend adding shredded ramano cheese, lot's of garlic, seasoned pepper to add more flover to this dish.

this is  a winner. I changed a couple things like adding fresh nutmeg and reducing sugar by a table spoon. I also used 40% of turkey ground in place of hamburger required. I also used quaker oats in place of bread crumbs. Need to watch the heart!

This did not hold up for me at all. It was very soggy and the meatloaf its self didn't have any flavor. I thought for sure I messed up the recipe, but I didn't! Bummer! It might be all right with less milk and some more seasoning! As written, it is pretty much the ONLY thing I have ever made that my husband wouldn't eat. The entire pan went to waste!

About ten years ago I had a recipe card with a meatloaf like this and lost it. Since then I've tried different recipes but ONLY this one stands! That meatloaf is what hooked my boyfriend at the time =]  We've now been together 10 years hee, hee. Absolutely delicious!! Thanks! My husband also thanks you Janette!
Update: now been together for 19 years and it's STILL his favorite!!!

This was my first time making meatloaf.  Some changes: I only had Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs on hand and doubled the ketchup sauce too make it a little more sweet because I served it with salted Italian seasoned red baby potatoes. Also added worestchire sauce like many other reviewers recommended. I accidentally added mustard sauce into the meat itself, but I dont think this made much of a difference. Very easy to make and delicious. Hubby loved it! Thank-You, this is a keeper!

Very flavorful and moist. I mixed in the glaze ingredients before baking and just made a bit of additional glaze for the outside. I'm not normally much of a meatloaf fan but I thought this was good.

Why does everyone say double the sauce? I think the amount in the recipe is perfect (after all, you still want to taste the meat!).  I reduced the brown sugar in the sauce by half, I personally don't like the glaze to be too sweet.

AWESOME!!   Just what I was looking for!  Tastes just like the one my Mom used to make (RIP!) glad I found this recipe! Thanks you SOOOO much! :D

I doubled the sauce and reserved half for the last 10 minutes and I attempt to drain the fat before putting it on, which can be tricky.  Much of the existing sauce getting runny from the fat hence the reserve.  I also double this recipe as sometimes 1 batch just doesn't feed myself, husband and 2 growing toddlers

This is a traditional meatloaf recipe. I use it often.  Last Halloween I got a little creative and shaped my JOHN DOE.  The kids got the biggest kick out of it.  I called it MURDER MEATLOAF.  The whole dinner was themed.  I also served...maggot rice, monster eyed deviled eggs, witches finger bread sticks, green slime punch with gummy worms and for dessert kitty litter cake....served in a "new" litter box and served with a scooper.  That recipe went a little overboard, it was very good, but the family just couldn't gag it down!

used my magic bullet to mash the onion with some fresh chopped garlic and 1/4 of a yellow onion.  Also added salt and pepper along with some garlic and onion powder.  Made the glaze without the mustard and put it on half way through cooking.  Served it with mashed potatoes and corn.  It was divine!

This is really good for a quick nite meal.  I usually have everything in place.  The only thing I do differently and I do it with every meatloaf I make is to put the meatloaf in a 13x9 pan and add about a 1/4 inch of water I cook it this way for about 45 mins then drain add the topping.  This way I drain all the fat and the meatloaf stays moist, and comes out of the pan AND cleanup is easier!  I do the same with meatballs except use beef broth.

This was my first attempt at meatloaf and it came out perfect.  Quick and easy.  Very moist and tasty.  I highly recommend using the 9x13 glass dish to drain the grease.  My picky husband loved it!

This recipe is fantastic!  It is very simple and straight forward.  The first time (which was my first time ever making meatloaf) I made this recipe, I followed it exactly.  and it was great, my husband wouldn't stop talking about it for days.  I just made it again tonight, however, I did alter it ever so slightly.  I used a red onion this time and made the sauce more to taste than to the measurements listed here.  It is even better this time!  I highly recommend this recipe...especially for first time meatloaf makers!

Excellent recipe.  I used garlic and herb flavored bread crumbs.  I also waited a little closer to the final cook time before I added the glaze.  I like many other cooked the onions in butter prior to putting mixture.  This gave great flavor and also kind of helped hide them from the kids.  2 year old and 4 year old ate it up.  Saved this one to my recipe box.  thanks submitter

The sauce alone makes this recipe fabulous. Next time I will make twice as much. I did add half a package of Lipton Onion soup mix which gave it some extra flavor!

This was absolutely delicious! It's so moist and the topping really makes it! Thanks! OK, this last review was 9/11/03 and it's now 5/5/05. I must review again because I've been making this for over a year now and I have to say This is the best meatloaf recipe, really! My husband flips over this. He says, " I love the way you make your meatloaf, I've never had better!" This is the best compliment, considering the fact that his Mom is an excellent cook, ( in my opinion as well as his.). That means, my meatloaf is better than Mom's, Thanks to you! Don't change a thing - the recipe is perfect as is!

this was the first time I've ever made meatloaf and it turned out sooooo good. I did change it a little though. I took 1/3 cup of spicy BBQ sauce and 3 kinds of bell peppers and added it to the meat mixture. and itstead of the ketchup topping I used spicy BBQ sauce. Now my dad is said to be the Chef in our family and he thought it was excellent and so did every one else. Thank You.

This meatloaf was excellent.  I only used one cup of light brown sugar and 1/2 of an onion.  It wasn't too sweet with the reduced amount of brown sugar.  We loved it!

This is a good meatloaf.  Th on thing that I would do different is cut down on the brown sugar.  I would also bake it on a baking sheet rather than putting in a loaf pan.  Overall, it was very different but good.

As the other reviewers have said, this meatloaf is VERY sweet. However, my husband was very excited about the leftovers, and that made it worth the effort! I will make this again sometime.

The first time I made this, I was in a hurry and didn't follow the directions exactly...I put all of the ingredients in with the hamburger, rather than using the ketchup mixture on top. BEST. MEATLOAF. EVER. I make it that way always now...so moist and flavorful!!!

I made a few adjustments. I added chopped red bell pepper, seasoned bread crumbs, Worcester sauce and part package of au jus to the meat mixture. I also added just enough milk to make the mixture moist and the bread crumbs softened. Simply amazing!!

It is an excellent basic easy meatloaf recipe. I made it as is and everybody loved it. It's kind of tiresome to read reviews that people keep saying it was great but I did this and this and this instead. That's not following the recipe. Make your own recipe. I did not add any of the extras and I did not saute the onions and everything turned out perfect. Oh and I also set ketchup out on the table if anybody wanted to add extra to it.

Next time though I believe I'll only use 1/2 tsp of the pepper.

I made this meatloaf recipe, but I mixed together some sweet BBQ sauce and ketchup for my topping. I even amazed myself with how good this meatloaf was. I will definitely be making this again.

I wouldn't use a loaf pan as that allows the meat to sit in its own grease. Rather build your loaf on a wire rack sitting in a sheet pan with raised sides. This allows the grease to drain away from the meat. You can line the sheet pan for easier clean up. 
I also left off the brown sugar as ketchup already has some sweetness as does the onion.

Made a few changes and took the advice of other reviewers as well.

I grated some carrot, chopped some onion, minced a clove of garlic and sauted that in some butter with basil and parsley. 

Used seasoned breadcrumbs and added a dash of soy sauce and balsamic vinegar (JUST a dash ;) ) Also added some garlic powder and mixed everything together.

For the topping I omitted the sugar (ketchup is sweet enough by itself) and instead added a tbpn BBQ sauce to the mixture. 

Came out amazing!! Will Def go into our reg rotation!!

Will definitely make it again!!! I reduced the mustard to one tablespoon and added two tablespoons of worshishire to the meat. I seasoned the caramalized onions and garlic instead of the meat. It makes the onions and garlic more flavorful before mixing in the ground beef. Also added just a tad of worshishire to the sauce for a little more flavor ????

The best part of this recipe is the sauce! My son usually HATES meatloaf but loves the sauce. He told me if I can make it like this all the time he'd eat it every day! LOL! Great recipe! We're cheese fanatics so I put half of the meat in the pan, add a half cup of shredded cheddar cheese then add the rest of the meat on top. The combination is amazing!

Yesterday we made this exactly as it was written. The only "differences" were using Panco bread crumbs and browning the onions a bit.  It is amazing! It's just like old fashioned comfort food. I ate a bit of it cold tonight and it was the best cold meatloaf I ever ate. We intend on making it a permanent member in our files. Thank you Janet!

No fail recipe every time!  I've made it as is and also used gluten free crackers instead of bread crumbs or substituted ground chicken.  If I do not have an onion I use onion soup mix and nix the salt.  This is a recipe to keep in the files!

This is close to my Mom's recipe....she'd add Pork/Veal, whichever was available - 4/1 beef to pork mix.  Milk is important, don't know why but if I don't use it it's not as good.  And try Oatmeal instead of Bread Crumbs...an old Italians trick when making meatBalls.

I made meatloaf for the first time in my life only yesterday.  It's delicious!!  I followed the recipe to a T, except I didn't use brown sugar in the topping, only dry mustard and ketchup.  Next time I will add the Worcestershire sauce and I'll use chili sauce instead of ketchup to give it a little zing.  thank you to the woman who developed this recipe

Love IT! The first time I made it, I did not read the directions through and added everything from the ingredient list in the meat mixture. Also, I had a store bought meatloaf mixture of 1-lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground pork. I cooked everything together and topped with some "Sweet Baby Ray" BBQ suace the last 15 mins. Now my family wants meatloaf once a week.

We thoroughly enjoyed this meat loaf. I love the basic ingredients, nothing pre-fab like condensed soup or soup mixes. I did add 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce like other reviewers, and used seasoned bread crumbs. I really liked the tangy hit of mustard in the topping which cut the sweetness. I did not see the point in cooking the onions beforehand as others suggested. There is no need for that extra step, as they were nice and soft after one hour in the oven.

A friend and I made this recipe and heeded the advice of the other reviewers. The result was a fantastic dish! Note that this might only serve 2-3 people, I feel that a typical family will need two dishes. We used the exact ingredient list, with Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and a little more (.20 lb) of meat. Also, a whole onion, diced and sauteed in buyter and garlic beforehand. For the sauce, lots of brown sugar, very little mustard, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce, blended to taste. Also, some common kitchen spices didn't hurt. We baked it until the sauce caramelized on the top and the inside was nice and plump, this took about an hour and a half at 350. Served with quartered red potatoes and a ceasar salad, it was an excellent meal that we'll be making again!

Recipe was very good. I followed the suggestions of others and sauteed the onions and I also added some celery. I used about 1/4 cp of the breadcrumbs and replaced the rest with Parmesan cheese.The sauce was very good but I did think it was a little too sweet. The meatloaf itself (I used half beef and half ground turkey) was very moist. I will definitely make it again.

This is hands down the best meatloaf I have ever had! This recipe has actually become a classic staple in my house. I make it  at least a couple times a month. My family absolutely loves it! So much so that when I asked my uncle what he wanted for his birthday dinner with the promise he could choose anything in the world he wanted, he actually chose this meatloaf recipe!Every time I buy hamburger meat now I literally use it for nothing else but this meatloaf. It has the perfect moist inside but the top gets really nice and crunchy with the Delicious caramelized ketchup on top. I usually don't add the onion because my family doesn't really like them and honestly you can't tell a difference. One thing i will say though as a tip if your new to making meatloaf is always get hamburger that is really low in fat! If you get meat with higher fat content you will basically have delicious taco meat. It needs to have less fat so it holds its loaf shape and not fall apart. Hands down 5 stars but would be ten if they had ten stars!

Pretty good recipe with some modifications: 1) add 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 2) use 3/4 bread crumbs (Italian seasoned) and/or oatmeal, 3) I used 80/20 chuck ground beef (maybe use 90/10 next time- it was super oily!), 4) double ketchup portion for sauce (don't double mustard or sugar), 5) bake for 1 hour 20 min (maybe at 50 min drain the fat if using oily meat), 6) when done, cover with foil and let sit for 10 min), 7) if still wet and oily, place on plate and microwave for 3 min.

I've made this meatloaf several times, it's great!  I saute the onions in coconut oil before adding them in.  It comes out perfect every time.  I used Jalapeno mustard in the glaze and it gave it a nice kick.  If you like spicy give it a try!

Followed the advice other reviewers have suggested. Instead of mustard, I used a hot sweet dipping mustard I got from a farmer's market. Holy schamoly this was delicious. Even my friends whom I had over for dinner were raving about the meatloaf saying this was the best meatloaf they've ever had. I highly suggest you use this recipe and add the onion, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce.

Awesome. Used Worcestershire sauce in the recipe, no mustard, twice as much ketchup, and subbed 1 cup lentils for the last 0.5 lbs beef. Kids are it right up!

I used this recipe to make meatloaf for the second time in my life.  Turned out great.  It was so easy.  I just have to say again I love this recipe it is so easy and so good.  I do sauteed the onions first and add some garlic, also add one tablespoon steak sauce.  Excellent I make two at as time and freeze one after I slice it.

Really good basic meatloaf. Nice and moist.  I do recommend you NOT put it in loaf pan, and instead shape it and bake it on slotted broiler-type pan so grease can drip through.  I used Panko breadcrumbs b/c that's what I had.  And to experiment, I cut bacon slices in half and laid them over half of the meatloaf. Good addition! I thought topping was good balance of sweet/spicy, with yellow mustard.  I mixed that up earlier, so maybe sitting awhile helped?  I literally spread it on top of meatloaf/bacon with my fingers since it was thick enuf and that allowed me to "paint" the sides.  Have saved this one to my Recipe Box.

Perfect base recipe. Great as is or good start for experimenting. Makes wonderful sandwiches. Try refrying with melted cheese. Let cheese flow over and toast. Use garlic toast. Mmmmm.

I have made this many times now and my hard to please husband still requests this for his lunches. It heats up great and is delicious! I would definitely double the sauce mixture to add on top! I typically use panko bread crumbs but have also tried regular Italian and both are great.  I always use Worcestershire  and add a few shakes to the meat mixture! If you are out of eggs you can use 1Tb of real mayo. If you have onion i would sauté them. i have made it without onion too and it still was received well. I have already had 2 requests for my meatloaf recipe! I never thought meatloaf would be such a loved recipe in our house! Definitely give this recipe a try!
UPDATE: I now cut the sugar in half (use 2TB only if you are doubling the sauce) and it is perfect!

Simple, tasty recipe. I added several "splashes" of Worcestershire to meat, browned the onions, and doubled the sauce. Also added chopped potato. Cooked for 70 minutes and came out very tender. I will cook this again, maybe add chili powder and jalapeños next time to give it a little kick

I found that using a "meatball &meatloaf mix" from the grocery store makes the taste 10 times better than just one type of meat. Also cook it 30 minutes covered and the last 30 minutes uncovered. You will love this especially the kids if they are picky eaters!

Made this for dinner this evening and I followed the recipe exactly except I added the Worcestershire sauce as suggested by others and I have got to say that this is by far the best meatloaf I have ever tasted. It will now become the only meatloaf recipe I will ever use. Thank you, thank you for such an easy and delicious recipe.

This was great! Used 1lb organic beef, 1 lb turkey, don't really measure ingredients, so just tossed everything together that was listed. I added the Worcestershire sauce, sauteed just half an onion in a little butter, also sauteed some mushrooms and added them. Oiled and seasoned 2 potatoes and cooked them on the rack next to the meatloaf, added steamfresh green beans to the meal. Awesome dinner!

This really is, as offered, an easy meatloaf.  Not fancy, just quick and ready and good. For ease, I subbed a half-package of stove stop stuffing for the bread, then added as few favorite spices (cumin, oregano, basil, thyme, for kicks) and put it in the oven.  go for the full time, it's better well-done.  Any time I don't want to mess around, I'll use this one !

Made the most marvelous meatloaf last night, thanks to this recipe! I did thought tweek it a bit. I grilled onions and red peppers, then puréed them adding kalamata olives and olive oil to add as a topper to the meatloaf! Lastly, adding bacon strips on top to simmer and add even more flavor!
I served with steamed and puréed carrots and cauliflower!

Delicious. I always use turkey so did as well with this one(not trying to alter recipe). Added 1 green pepper to mixture.  Also added strips of bacon after topping with sauce. We really enjoyed. The sauce was not too sweet and it was the perfect amount. Did have to cook 1 1/2hrs but possibly because of the bacon.  Very moist.

One of the best recipes for meatloaf I've tried.  My dad loved it, even my hubby who is not a meatloaf fan.  I ate 3 big pieces!  The only changes I made (personal preferences)is I added some panko breadcrumbs as it was a bit wet, some worcestire sauce and garlic powder.  I know I hate reading how people changed someones recipe, but some people like additional spices.  This is a good recipe that can be adapted to your own taste.  It came out very moist.

Made it twice now.  Like an old fashioned meatloaf that makes nice slices for sandwiches when cold. Last night I had to use Italian seasoned crumbs as that's all I had. The first time I used plain, but not quite enough to make a cup, so I supplemented with Italian. Both are great. I also added about 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce each time. For the top, I used plain ketchup, put on halfway through cooking.  The proportion for the loaf are perfect.  This would nicely serve a family of 6, but there would be no leftovers for sandwiches. My husband of 40 years has asked me to make this every week! Good, quick, cheap and easy, my cooking criteria.  Editing:  today, I used one lb 85% lean hamburger, and two sweet Italian Sausages , about 1/2 lb for the two, meat removed from casings.  One half cup Italian dry crumbs, one half cup dry plain crumbs.  Cooked it in two small loaf pans, one to eat tonite, one to freeze for next week.  As before, used the Worchesester sauce.

Easy is an accurate description!  Excellent is another powerful word!!  This was one of the most MOIST meatloafs I've ever made...  and if you choose to reheat it...  just cover with a bowl in the microwave and it's amazing as moist as first served.  I believe the difference is the milk!  You can play with spices if you want to go for a different taste... but this recipe is a good crowd pleaser.  I rarely write reviews... but I was very pleased and impressed with this recipe.  Good luck.

My husband has been craving meatloaf for a couple weeks now. I followed this recipe ALMOST to the letter. Everyone likes to put their own personal touch when cooking...recipes are a nice guideline...not set in stone. This recipe is sooooo basic and easy to use. Almost impossible to mess this up. I added worcestershire sauce, used seasoned bread crumbs, used a season mix blend of onions bell peppers and celery, used bbq sauce instead of making the topping. It was FABULOUS!!!!! My husband loved it. My 2 teenagers devoured it. I only have enough left for 2 servings! I personally think this is the BEST meatloaf I've ever made. A cup of this and a cup of that, an egg and some ground beef made for an incredibly moist yet firm meatloaf. Such an easy recipe. I don't think I'll ever use another recipe again. This was fantastic!!!!

Amazing taste and moistness!  I use 1/2 cup of milk as the full cup seems to be a bit much to me.  The bf and I have this about twice a month now.

This was a great recipe especially for somebody who had never made a meatloaf. The only things I did differently was used 2 lbs of lean ground beef. For seasoning I used garlic salt, seasoned salt, Italian seasoning, ground pepper corn, and steak seasoning. I served it with home made mashed potatoes and fresh green beans and fresh asparagus. It was great

Just made this recipe for April 1st (April Fools Supper) into "cupcakes".  I followed another reviewers advice and used Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs.   It was very tasty.  After combining all the "loaf" ingredients I divided the meat mixture into large balls and put them into a muffin pan, then spooned the glaze over each serving.  I still baked for one hour and they were done perfectly.  When serving the "cupcakes" I bought premade mashed potatoes (easy) and tinted it bright pink.  The mashed potato "frosting" then went on the meatloaf "cupcakes".  I served each on a plate with a lit candle that we all blew out after saying our dinner prayer.  It was a fun and tasty meal.  My 6 year old niece told me I really "April Fooled" her as she thought we were having real cupcakes for supper.

Because of the short ingredient list, I chose this recipe for my first attempt at making meatloaf and have now made it twice. I followed the recipe faithfully the first time with the only changes being that I used plain almond milk instead of cow milk, Italian seasoned dried bread crumbs, and increased cooking time to be about 1 hour and 25/30 minutes until the meat thermometer read 160 degrees F. The meatloaf turned out really good, pulling lots of compliments from my family. However, we all agreed that the sweetness of the topping was a bit much for our taste and that there wasn’t enough of it (which was probably a good thing since it was too sweet). The meat itself tasted good and was the perfect texture. The second time I made it, I used some of the suggestions from other reviewers.

Meat mixture: Used Italian seasoned dried bread crumbs (again) sautéed the onions with garlic, and added 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce (low sodium).
Topping: Doubled the ingredients to make more topping but reduced brown sugar by about half.

The recipe is mostly unchanged, however, because the original is just sooo tasty! My family said they loved it and want it again!

Absolutely fantastic taste. I cut out a lot of fat by using turkey burger, fat-free milk, and olive oil to saute onions and mushrooms before adding. The end result was a bit wet, but it tasted incredible. Maybe I will put it in a 9 x 13 pan and surround it with bread slices to mop up the juice next time.

I followed this recipe exactly with great results. Something came up so we couldn't eat it the day I made it.  So I covered it still in loaf pan and stuck it in fridge. Next day I removed it from loaf pan, and completely wrapped it in foil and cooked it for 25-30 mins at 350.It was completely moist and delicious. GREAT recipe#

Great meatloaf and very easy to make.  It did need a little longer than 1 hour, about 70 minutes--could have been my oven.

The brown sugar imparts a little more flavor to this typically bland meatloaf recipe. I prefer meatloaf made with chopped green olives, onions and peppers, also sans the traditional ketchup icing.

Good start but I did some adjustment to the recipe.  I sauted the onions, 2 chopped celery stalks, and garlic before I added to the meat mixture.  Also added 2 TBS of ketcup, steak sauce and yellow mustard into the mix.  For my topping sauce I omited the sugar and instead used 2TBS of the steak sauce instead with some dash of tabasco sauce for some heat.  After I put the meat mixture into the loaf container, I added the sauce and then topped it with some slice of thick bacon.  It was tastey!

I made this meatloaf for my family on Saturday.  It was so easy to make.  I tweaked it a bit, following other reviews.  I used a mix of ground beef and pork just to cut back a bit on the fat.  For the 1.5 lbs. of meat, I used 2 eggs (because the eggs I had were kinda tiny), 1 1/2 cups of Italian style dried bread crumbs, half a teaspoon each of dried basil and oregano.  I also added half a large green bell pepper which I chopped finely.  I left the rest of the ingredients for the meatloaf unchanged.  I added 1 tsp of worcestershire sauce to the sauce and not in the meat mixture.  I baked it for 1 hour and 20 minutes and it turned out perfectly moist and most importantly....DELICIOUS!  My hubby and 6-year old son loved it so much they want me to make it again!  And I definitely will.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I though the meatloaf was great as written.   Loved the sauce. First time made as written.  Second time sautéed onions.  Even better with sautéed onions. Third time sautéed onions and garlic in butter and added tablespoon Worchester sauce (based on other reviews)  perfect.

Had to give this 4 due to alterations that made it a 5! BEST MEATLOAF EVER! I sauteed the onion w 2 cloves garlic 1 stalk celery in 1 tbsp butter. Added about 1 tbsp Worcestershire to the meat, reduced bread crumbs to 3/4. For the sauce double the ketchup & add a few dashes Worcestershire.  I doubled the mustard because we like the tang and added about 1/3 c bbq sauce. The layering of the sauce on the bottom, middle, then top was a must.I topped w parsley flakes for a little color. cooked at 350 for 50 minutes foil covered, then uncovered for about 20 (kidz prefer beef well-done), then broiled for about 5 minutes. I did have to drain it several times and again right before broiling.  Seriously,  TRY THIS OUT!! Thanks reviewers for the tweak suggestions :-)  I'll never make meatloaf any other way again

This recipe is absolutely amazing for being rather 'plain', ( I say that in a good way- not alot of fussy ingredients/steps) I have made it twice and finally added to my favs. My family requests this at least 1x a week! I followed the recipe exactly and it turns out lip smacking each time! Thank you Janet!!

I added a good slug of Worcestershire Sauce and it was Great!  I was reluctant when it came to the brown sugar and mustard, since we don't like sweet and mustard is for hot dogs, but decided this receipt had so many good reviews, I went for it.  My wife said she liked it better than her's ...and that's saying something.  Definitely a keeper.

Added red peppers and used my homemade honey butter bread for the toasted bread crumbs. Doubled the topping as well. Needless to say... it was **amazing**!!! My husband doesn't like red peppers or onions, and this was a great way to sneak them in. ;)

For those without a sweet tooth, cut the brown sugar in half and this meatloaf will be a hit. I also added spinach and mushrooms. First meatloaf I have made in 20yrs that actually was finished!!

I took the basic recipe added some paprika pepper, fresh chile and crushed garlic. I hard boiled three eggs and put them in the middle of the mixture. I've decided to call it The Devil's Egg Meatloaf.

It could possibly be the best meatloaf that I have ever made.  I did have to use oatmeal in place of the bread crumbs, but other than that followed the directions.  Will make this again! Thank you!

This was a great base recipe.  Using two pounds of g.b., I did what others suggested with the worcestershire, sauteed onions and a red bell pepper in lots of butter with garlic.  I was out of milk, so I used a bit under a cup of chicken broth instead and added another egg to make up for the milk.  I also added 4 pieces of cooked, chopped bacon.  A dash of nutmeg to the topping.  My guys liked it...being vegetarian, I didn't try it, but if my men like it I know it must be good.  Will be keeping this one :)  Thank you for sharing!  Also, I formed a loaf on a sheet (makes for easy removal of grease) and cooked at 350 for about half an hour, and another half hour at 365, let sit for about 10 minutes before serving.

Well I substituted two eggs for the milk as I dont drink milk and subbed dry oats for breadcrumbs. Also I added garlic and green pepper to the onions with a bit of paprika. I liked the topping as I usually use ketchup. Wait a minute! I changed the whole recipe but thanks for the guidelines. LOL.

I found this recipe in a childrens cookbook that I had when I was a kid.  I absolutely love it and have been making it ever since.  One difference is that in the cookbook it gives you the option to make mini meatloaves, which I usually do because it cuts the cook time down by 75% (only 15 min.).  You can do this by using a muffin tin or by forming small balls, about the size of a baseball, and cooking it on a foil lined baking sheet.  I also recommend not filling the loaf pan to the edges.  This way you can get the sauce on the sides, and in my opinion the sauce is what makes this dish.

This is a wonderful basic meatloaf recipe that you can tweak and edit and add to as you like to suit your preferences. I made this with 1lb ground beef and 1lb spicy Italian sausage, and I loved the subtle kick the meatloaf had to it!

I didn't have the dry bread crumbs, so I added a pkg. of savory herbs stuffing mix instead.  We like onions and gr. bell pepper and so I added that plus 1T of A-1 sauce instead of Worsc. sauce.  Baked it 40 min. and then added the topping and finished baking for about 30 additional minutes.  My husband said it was the best he has had in quite awhile.  Will definitely make again.  I made a double recipe and formed 2 meatloaves in a deep treated pan.

I love this recipe!  I was hesitant to try it at first because I thought the whole onion would be overpowering and the milk would make it too liquid-y to stick together, but I followed the directions exactly and it was perfect!  My husband was never crazy about meatloaf when I used to make it, but now when I make it following this recipe, he always has seconds.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe! With all respect to the chef, may I gently suggest replacing 1/2 lb of the beef with 1/2 lb of ground sausage? It's a lovely variation that gives the base a bit more depth.

By far the best meatloaf recipe I've ever had! Love, love, loved it! I doubled up the "sauce" and made lots of garlic mashed potatoes to accompany it. I actually went through my recipe box and threw out all my other meatloaf recipes. This is the one! 
update: Made this for company last night. Doubled the sauce recipe and added siracha, WOW!

Served this tonight. I used crackers instead of bread crumbs.  I also found a tiny bit of chili powder (the kind in an envelope for making chili, not regular chili powder)...it was probably about a teaspoon and I threw it in with the ground beef mixture.  I didn't salt much because I figured between the saltine crackers and the chili seasoning, it was ok.  The only mustard I had was Dijon so used that.  I browned the onions in a little bit of butter as many described and also sauteed some green peppers but forgot to put them into the ground beef mixture, so I just added them to the top after spreading on the topping. It looked pretty. I served it with rice.  My husband liked it so much he had two servings and he rarely does that.

This was mushy. I can't stand mushy.  It was also bland on the bottom and too sweet on the top. I couldn't eat it. I was really disappointed. I am sure the recipe calls for too much milk which caused the mushiness.

Good recipe.  After reading numerous reviews, I decided to adjust the recipe based on advice from others.  I completely excluded the brown sugar, reduced the amount of mustard to 1 tablespoon, increased the amount of ketchup to 1 cup, sauted the onion, and also added a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce.  I also ended up cooking it for 1 hour and 25 minutes rather than just an hour which was perfect timing.  Thank you everyone for the great suggestions in your reviews! I do not think mine would have ended up as good if I wouldn't have made these adjustments based on all your suggestions!

This is my base meatloaf recipe, and the very first thing I tried when I decided to start doing actual cooking instead of just warming up pre-made stuff in the oven or microwave. Although I alter it a bit, it's become one of my "go-to" recipes for when I need something quick and easy.

The first meatloaf I ever had was kind of ketchupy-tasting, so that's what my mouth looks for in a meatloaf. Therefore, I usually increase the amounts of ketchup and mustard by 50% (doubling the part that goes into the meatloaf mix, and leaving the glaze as is). I also quite liked it when I increased the sugar the same way, but I stopped doing that to try to keep some semblance of trying to be healthy! Also, instead of brown sugar, I use coconut palm sugar, which is healthier and tastes just as good. I try to add lots of different veggies, too, to make it a one-course meal that's easy to pack for lunch at work. Carrots are good, as are mushrooms, diced tomatoes, and chopped spinach.

BFF LOVED this recipe!!!! said it is the best EVER!! . He also said keep the topping per original recipe do not double it. LOL. I sautéed the onions is a little butter & garlic first with a little red pepper(Pete says omit the red pepper). Also...note to self ...after said cooking time, check w/ fork, if too moist, cook at 375 for 20 more min.. I don't know about your stores but I never can buy 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef so I buy 2 lbs.  Obviously I had extra so I made 3 nice sized patties from the "extra" meatloaf  mixture. I then wrapped them in clear plastic wrap and into a plastic bag and froze them for individual use later.

I halved this recipe and pretty much followed it. Going by the reviews of others though, I grilled the onion and added a large clove of garlic. Used breadcrumbs that I added my own spices to, and added a tbsp of worcestercire. Used a whole egg for half the recipe. I don't eat meat but made this for my Dad. He loves my cooking but said this was dry and bland. He picked the hamburg, which was only 6% fat and we both agreed this was the reason it was dry. But the bland was the reason I only gave this 3 stars. He didn't have much to say about the topping, but wound up adding a lot of ketchup to each piece. Wsh I could try this myself and give more constructive comments, but I will have to go with my Dad's review and just look for another recipe.

Turned out great. I followed the other reviews and doubled the sauce and added Worcestershire sauce and some minced garlic. Simple and the husband loved it.

Definitely a keeper. I made the following revisions per the other reviews: sauteed onion w/butter + garlic (powder), added about 1 TBSP of Worsterschire, used a little less mustar (yellow). I also doubled the sauce which was perfect. And, used italian seasoned breadcrumbs. Baked for 10 mins longer than called for - could have gone for 10 more mins..and I let stand for a good 15 mins before serving. There was a pool of oil on the bottom but maybe that helps it keep moist..because it really was! AND it did not crumble at all. Can't wait to try it a a sandwich. Delicious and so easy!

My husband introduced me to meatloaf with a very simple recipe that I thought was great enough to put in our church cookbook. That recipe is tough and bland by comparison. Try this!

My wife and I baked this meatloaf tonight for the first time. We both agree it was the best we had ever tasted. Will be our only meatloaf from now on.

I cooked this meatloaf on a broiler pan in the oven . I first placed three pieces of bread on the pan and placed the uncooked meatloaf mixture on top of the bread slices. No sticking to the pan and the bread (discarded) soaked up much of the grease from the meat. I simply topped with our favorite bottled barbeque sauce. It was a winner.

Great Recipe. I did what others suggested with the sauteed onions and Worcestershire sauce, but I also used 1/2 a green and red pepper too. I used Ritz Crackers instead of crumbs for the salt and buttery taste. I also added some bacon bits to it. For the sauce I made a little more than the recipe and also to spice it up a bit I added a 1/2 teaspoon of Cayenne pepper. It came out amazing! My kids even ate it and they are picky eaters!

This is the best meatloaf recipe I've found. Made it twice already for a very picky husband who loves it. I added worcestershire like another reviewer and green pepper. I've also found that sauteing the peppers and onions before makes them taste even better.

This meatloaf stayed very moist.  I thought it had a bit too much onion.  I will probably use 1/2 onion next time.  Absolutely LOVE the sauce!  Will make again!

This has been my go to meatloaf recipe for the past 3 years now. I do saute the onions first in butter, double the sauce and I substitute old fashioned oats for the bread crumbs. Delicious!

Adding my two cents because I have learned that the more positive comments there are, the more likely it is that someone will try the recipe. And you SHOULD try it! This meatloaf is perfectly moist, holds together well, and tastes delicious. I sautéed the onions in butter, added worchestershire sauce (1T), and just spread catsup over my meatloaf before baking (I didn't want my meatloaf to be sweet). Yum! Soo good!

I haven't eaten meatloaf in at least 10 years. This was delicious! Instead of onion I added a packet of French onion soup. The glaze for on top is so yummy I might put it on other things!

Great basic recipe which I gussied up some by using 1/2 ground chicken and 1/2 ground sausage.  I didn't have any bread crumbs, so I substituted rolled oats.  Didn't miss the bread crumbs, plus I need lower gluten recipes anyway. I left out the sugar and mustard also. I layered half of the meat in the pan, then sprinkled a generous portion of grated sharp cheddar, then the remainder of the meat mix. Oh, and I left out the milk, too, but this recipe turned out very moist. I didn't grease the pan as I figured there would be extra fat from using the sausage. Everyone of the eight people at the table  pronounced it to be a 'keeper' for sure. It was absolutely delicious and I definitely will make it again. It proved to be a quick, easy recipe for short notice company coming. Great basic recipe you can switch up different ways for different dinners. Thanks, Janet!

Awesome, love this meatloaf. I have already made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks. I cut mine into little squares and bake it in the oven on 350 for 30 minutes. It lets all the little pieces get nice and brown.

This was ok. I didn't really care for the bread crumbs(the flavor of them really stands out), I should have used crushed crackers(my preference). I doubled the sauce but it just didn't seem to add much flavor for some reason.

This recipe was wonderful. I read a lot of reviews before making this and made some modifications. My fiance and youngest daughter are very picky eaters. My fiance wanted seconds and my daughter ate it so big success. I used 2 lbs of ground beef, 1/2 C. milk indtead of 1 C., we don't like onions so used I TBS onion powder instead, added 1 TBS garlic powder, and 1 TBS worcestershire. Also doubled the topping; however was too mustardy so we did 3 TBS mustard, 4 TBS brown sugar, 1 C. ketchup, and added I TBS worcestershire. This was wonderful. It cooked for an hour just like the recipe called. I think it depends on your oven.

I'd like to ask how much onion is required (1 onion might be very big or very small).  Perhaps the quantity could be expressed in cups. 
Also, add a tablespoonful or two of freshly chopped parsley, hold the sugar, forget the ketchup.  Top with stewed tomatoes and grated cheese.   Also, in lieu of dried bread crumbs, try oatmeal soaked in skim milk or water to add fiber.

As written, this was okay. It need some seasoning and veggie love. For round two, I sauteed chopped onion, green pepper, mushrooms, and garlic and added it to the meat. I also added a packet of onion soup mix and some pepper to balance out the saltiness of the onion soup. I paired this with parmesan/roasted garlic potatoes. It was so good that I woke up in the middle of the night to pick at the leftovers. My advice to other meatloaf makers is 1) for tender meatloaf, don't squeeze the beef; gently mix together the ingredients until they're just combined, and 2) let the breadcrumbs sit in a bowl with the milk to absorb it, then mix in everything else.

My family loves this recipe.  I like to make meatloaf  shaped in a 3 inch high rounded mound on a pizza stone.  The grease drains away from the meat and there is more surface area for the sauce.

My family has always loved meatloaf, but they have never asked for it until I made this recipe.  Based on other reviews I sauteed the onion.  I also use 2lbs of meatloaf mix (1lb gr beef, 1lb gr pork) and add a meatloaf spice packet instead of salt and pepper. The recipe is wonderful as written but such a great base that you can customize it to savory or sweet to suit your taste. Thanks!

Before this meatloaf...my family dreaded meatloaf night...now they look forward to it! I swear!! The one thing I do different is I wrap it with bacon then put a second coat of the sauce on top of that. It's a hit!!

This was an easy recipe. Also, my husband does not like meatloaf, but I made it anyway. He kept saying, bite after bite, how incredible the meal was! He was even shocked that he went back for seconds!

I've used this recipe several times, cutting it in half, and adding a bit of worcestershire sauce. It always comes out great! I've also mixed a bit of cheese into it as well.

Awesome recipe.  I used leftover bag stuffing in place of breadcrumbs and it was delicious!  My 8 yo son & his friend asked for seconds!  Have made this recipe several times.

This was very good meatloaf. The mustard/ketchup mixture on top separated after cooking. I just mixed it up on top of the meatloaf and it was ok.

This meatloaf was good, not fantastic. I followed the recipe and thought it could have had more flavor. I did not like the glaze, I thought it was a little too sweet. I fed this to 4 people and got mixed reviews.

Awesome meatloaf recipe!! My boyfriend could not get enough of it it was delicious! I made a few changes though. 1) I used 3 lbs of ground beef(grass fed and organic) and used more of all of the other ingredients for the extra meat.  2) I added worstishire sauce to the meat, about 2 tablespoons. 3) I sautéed the garlic, onions, and red and yellow bell pepper and added that to the meat. 4) used seasoned bread crumbs. I also doubled the ketchup sauce mixture. Baked at 350 for an hour and a half. Made mashed potatoes and asparagus to go with it! Soo delicious I will definitely make it again!

I was looking to make a meatloaf that was different than my current recipe. The milk and the brown sugar caught my attention in this recipe. I made it tonight and it was wonderful. My husband and son loved it and said it was the best meatloaf they have ever had. I added a little extra brown sugar to the ketchup. Was definitely quick and easy!  10 stars

The taste was okay but it came out too watery. The meatloaf fell apart as soon as I cut into it.  I wasn't sure about any meatloaf recipe that called for milk but thought I'd give this a try since it had so many good reviews. I'm not going to be making this one again.

I made this meatloaf for my English mother in law who was curious about American meat loaf.  She was very impressed and thinks I am an amazing cook.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!  I wouldn't change a thing :)

This is a great meatloaf.  The only change I made was to add a few diced jalepenos to spice it up, I felt it was a nice contrast to the brown sugar-ketchup mixture.  Ive had a number of people say its the best meatloaf they have ever tasted.

This recipe in my opinion was great. I followed the recipe exact, and also sauteed the onions per other suggestions. I even had a bit closer to 2 pounds of the meat. I added Lea & Perrins Worcestershire and I actually used plain bread crumbs. I also added a bit of basil and a bit of ketchup. 
The topping was nice in my opinion also. 
Its a keeper for us :)

This meatloaf turned out quite well.  I have been searching for a new meatloaf recipe, and decided to try this one tonight.  It turned out GREAT!  Very moist and awesome flavor.  The only changes I made was adding a few shakes of worchestershire, and a couple of minced cloves of garlic.

I made this last night. We usually just put ketchup on top of meatloaf, but I used the topping in the recipe and no one liked the topping. My kids and my boyfriend preferred to have ketchup only on top. I thought it was great though. I liked it. :)  I did use the suggestions from the other reviews.

I have to say I made this tonight and it turned out absolutely wonderful.  It's not a new, exotic, type meatloaf.  Instead, it reminds me of the kind my  mother made growing up!  The sauce is so good, and I certainly agree with other viewers that you should make about a third more than the recipe calls for in order to give the loaf a nice glaze.  Additionally, I also sauteed the onions with a couple of cloves of garlic in some butter and oil, as others suggested.  It was so moist, so comforting.  GREAT recipe...will now be a staple!

I made the recipe but added green peppers and omitted the glaze. It's just me in my household, so I cut it into slices and froze the rest. It was good the first day but great after the flavors had time to marry. Try a meatloaf sandwich with mustard and ketchup.

Awesome!!  Didn't have time and some ingredients for my usual meatloaf so tried this.  Already had ground beef and ground pork (1 lb each) so just used that but everything almost same (adjusted for slightly adjusted meat amount).  Family really loved it.  Guess I may be switching since this is easier

I absolutely love this recipe. I added worcestershire sauce too. I'm going to reduce the milk a bit but the mustard, brown sugar & ketchup mixture is to die for. I am going to add it to a brisket sandwich I've created as a topping before I add slaw. Wonderful. Simple IS better!

This was good (for a very basic meatloaf) and hubby loved it but I do agree, there isn't quite enough sauce, hence the 4 star rating.  Since I was just making for 2 ppl and only had just under 1lb 90% lean ground beef, I had to modify the recipe a bit.  I set the servings to 5 and used those quantities listed (except still used 1 whole egg).  I would've loved to try adding Worcestershire sauce but didn't have any in the house.  I didn't have breadcrumbs so I used crumbled crackers (the equivalent of about 8 'social crackers').  I also sauteed the onion a bit along with a large clove of garlic.  Still baked it for an hour and it came out perfectly cooked.  Next time I'll make more sauce on the side to ladle over individual servings.

Very good base recipe! I replaced the milk with salsa and added bell pepper. Next time i will only put 3/4 cup salsa so its not TOO moist, add worcestershire sauce and replace the onion with Lipton Oncion soup(dry).

EXCELLENT! I have made this meatloaf many times and it is always a hit! I use salsa instead of milk, and have used crackers instead of bread crumbs if none were available. My family and friends love this meatloaf and one of my friend's children call this "Penny's Meatloaf!" Thank you Janet Caldwell for this fantastic recipe!

Excellent meatloaf recipe. I haven't made a meatloaf in ages because mine always shrank too much. This meatloaf came out perfect in size and moisture. I used 2 lbs. of ground beef and a little less than the I cup of milk  because others who used this reciept said to let it stand for  10 min. before cutting it and I was pressed for time. My brothers raved about it and we have enough left over for sandwiches too.

This was so easy to make.  One of the best meatloaf dishes I've consumed in a long time.  I added some worcestershire to the meat & sriracha to the glaze for some extra kick!!

Love the meatloaf, but the glaze had a bit too much mustard taste so I prefer without. I cooked the onions in a bit of olive oil beforehand. Also put it into the crockpot for 8 hours. Delicious and moist!

We weren't too happy with the outcome of this meatloaf. It was just too simple and bland (the top sauce was the best part). I'm sure there are a lot more recipes out there for meatloaf that are as easy to make but with few more ingredients... Sorry!

I added a packet of onion soup mix instead of the chopped onions & it was delicious!  The whole family loved it, especially my daughter who claimed she didn't like meatloaf!  :)

This was the best meatloaf I've ever made. My husband is a very picky eater, and he loved it too. I didn't have any onions on hand, so I used Lipton dry onion soup mix. This had plenty of seasoning, so I didn't add any salt or pepper. I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain ones. My husband is diabetic, so I didn't include any topping before baking it. I added a bit of sweet baby ray's BBQ sauce on mine once it was on my plate. I was pleased with the simplicity of this recipe, and how quick it was to throw it together. I will definitely make this again.

Super simple but super good! I did take the advice of others and added the worcestershire and sautéd onions. However, I also added some Italian seasoning to it as well.  I'm getting ready to make this for the forth time as the family really loves it!

I have never actually made meatloaf but I was trying to imitate my mother's. I didn't put the onion in because I couldn't seem to find the onion I had just purchased at the store but the only thing I would change on it would be the mustard in the topping. I think I will replace it with worcheshire sauce next time. The brown sugar adds a great sweetness to it.

Followed the direction , but much too sweet for my crowd. Sub no brown sugar and use tomato paste instead of ketchup - my suggestion. I love all recipes but this one ... not so much ...

excellent starter recipe.  crushed corn flakes work as well as bread, or oatmeal; try chili sauce in place of ketchup; more egg-less milk.  OR sour cream.  the mustard is an excellent touch.   dust with ground cloves before adding sauce

I've been using this recipe for years now, and discovered that you can perk up the topping by adding 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg and 1/4 tsp dry mustard to the ketchup mixture. It is so flexible that you can add any shredded vegetables and spice up or down with the same excellent results.

Made meatloaf for the first time ever using this recipe. It's super easy and the boyfriend loves it (he's the meatloaf/pot roast/steak kinda guy)!! As a tip, I line my 5x9 inch loaf pan with foil and then lightly grease the foil with some vegetable oil.  Reduces the mess you have to clean up later!  Love this recipe just as it is, it's definitely going in my book :)

I gave it 3 stars because I thought it could've been better and it seemed a little mushy to me. I didn't use 6 slices of bread to mix in because i didn't want it to be mushy but I did put 2 slices on the bottom to soak up any extra grease which worked. I did like the meatloaf though and everyone in my house did as well. I would def add more seasonings next time though. I did sautee the peppers and onions before hand which everyone liked. Maybe i should draion the sauteed  things before mixing it in that could be why it was a bit mushy too. I wasn't so much mushy i guess just very moist. My boyfriend would prob give it 4 1/4 stars though. Super easy to make!

I made without breadcrumbs (wheat-free) and it was still good, although a little runny.  Probably my fault as I should have reduced the milk to compensate for the lack of bread crumbs.

Love this recipe.  Best one I have ever tried!  The only change I make is add a peeled boiled egg inside.  Meat loaf surprise!  My husband loves it this way :)

I live overseas so I don't get a lot of western food... this was GREAT!  Not as great as some recipies that have a lot of hard to find ingredients where I live but the best I've had over here.

Delicious!  My only change was to use seasoned bread crumbs, which I always do.  It was great.  Remember to let rest b/f cutting. Update:  I reduced the milk to 3/4 cup to make sure it wasn't too wet.  I've also added green or red pepper and that is tasty.

I gave this a 3 based on the written recipe not the taste.  The flavour is great, but it wasn't written properly.  I am AMAZED no one has said that the cooking time is WAY off.  I used 1lb turkey, 1/2lb beef.  I did 350 for an hour and let it rest and when I cut into it, it was not done.  So I put the temp up to 400 and did another 30 min.  STILL was bloody in the middle.  Did ANOTHER 30 min at 400 and it was finally done.  It isn't my stove because this is the first time I've had a recipe NOT turn out from AR.  So this took me double the time...we ate dinner at 8:30pm because of the timing issue....way too late.

I think this is a good, easy, basic recipe for meatloaf. I shared it with my brother who isn't much of a cook and he was able to make it and loved it. You can always get more complicated and add things or sub things. I like the rawness of the onions. I also liked the sweet glaze. I did add a few shakes of worshire sauce.

I have made the modifications that others have made:  sauteing the onions before adding, doubling the sauce (with a little less mustard) and adding a dash of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture.  I also foil line the pan for easy cleanup.  My 5 year old requests this weekly!!

This was a really good meatloaf recipie. I did modify it a bit. I added a tbsp of worshestshire(sp?) and doubled the katchup sauce. However, next time I will just squeeze katchup directly on top of the meatload because I didn't like the brown sugar in it, it made it too sweet. I will also put in olnly 3/4C of milk instead of 1C. One more thing I did was I put sliced american cheese in the middle of the meatloaf. It was really good that way.

This meatloaf is easy and delicious, but the cooking time called for seems to short, so I added 20 minutes to the cooking time. Be sure to let it rest before slicing as it's very moist.

I made this meatloaf with extra lean ground beef and substituted the 1 cup of bread crumbs for 1 cup of quick cooking oats.  I also used half the topping mixture as I didn't want it too sweet.  It was so tasty and moist!  This recipe is going to be the only one I use to make meatloaf.  Tried other recipes and could not get away with extra lean meat without drying it out except this one.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was awesome! Probably the best meatloaf I've ever had (with a few tweaks). I made some changes based on others here and myself.

First off, I left out the brown sugar (kind of). I used Adam's Rib Rub which was sold in my local supermarket (Shop-Rite). It has brown sugar in it and other spices. I put this in my meat mixture as well as my sauce. I put more than the 2 tbsp of brown sugar called for. In total I might have used 1/4 to 1/3 of the bag between the meat and the sauce.

I tried this recipe twice. One person said to first saute the onions in butter. Not needed and made absolutely no difference. The onions get tender when cooked in the oven anyway.

As for the sauce, I tripled the quantity.. that means 1 cup ketchup, 6 tbsp mustard. I used Boar's Head Mustard, which made the sauce very tangy. Some said to use less mustard, but I enjoyed what I made and thought it was perfect.

The cooking time was perfect if you ask me. My meat was totally moist and not overcooked or dry in anyway shape or form.

Truly a no-fail. I consider myself to be a very good at home cook and have failed at meatloaf(which should be impossible) everytime until I tried this recipe. Followed the other recommendations as well and sauteed onions, garlic, and added green peppers to the saute also. Used ritz crackers in place of the bread crumbs. It was def a HIT! Love this recipe.

I made this last week and it was delicious!!  My very picky 8 yr old daughter even had seconds!!  It reminds me of my grandmother's home made recipe I use to enjoy as a child.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was awesome :)  I wouldn't change a thing.  I've now made this recipe my own!

My 12 yr old son requested meatloaf and the whole family thought this one was amazing.I gave this 4 stars because of the sweetness of the glaze on top. Next time I'll just  really reduce or leave out the brown sugar. I served it with mashed cauliflower similar to the recipe on this site. I had 2 lbs of ground beef so I added 2 eggs, 1 1/3 c of both milk & bread crumbs. I did modify the recipe per other reviews by using only 1/2 onion and adding 1 pkg onion soup mix, some Italian seasoning, a couple shakes of Worcestershire in the meat and also in the glaze but I think if I would have just made the recipe as written I would have still given it a 4.    Thanks Janet!

*note -  this would easily get 5 stars if you tweak the sauce like 95% of the reviews say to do. 
I did and my husband and i loved it (which is saying something since i wouldn't choose to eat beef. But he loves it so it better be good when i make it & we eat)
I used a loaf pan and when i took mine out of the oven there was quite a bit of liquid around the loaf which surprised me but i drained it before serving and the meat was very moist. I also put in 1 minced garlic clove, used half an onion and that was just fine, however the only thing i had in the house was Ritz crackers and those didn't seem to hold up as well.. They seemed to disappear.  i'll probably go for real bread crumbs or more substantial crackers next time (we crushed some on top & that was a great addition).
For my sauce i followed the recipe and then added hot sauce, BBQ sauce and some salt&pepper

Hope this helps!

hubby and son really liked this one, definately had to double up on the glaze recipe, but didn't double up on mustard, we like mustard but it would have been to strong if I had double the mustard, quick and easy. I will be making it again. The glaze is what makes this recipe.

This hit my tastebuds.  I made it with mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, cornbread and buttery carrots.  SO BOMB.  I sauteed the onion.  I made my breadcrumbs with garlic croutons.  I used leftover evaporated milk I had instead of regular just so it would not go to waste.  Thanks so much for the formula.

Amazing recipe! My husband usually hates meatloaf and he had seconds! I followed other reviewers and sauteed the onion and added a little garlic. I also added about a tablespoon of worchestshire and it was perfect! Can't wait to make this one again!

this is a good basic meatloaf recipe. I did the recipe as written BEFORE I TRIED THE SUGGESTIONS OF OTHER REVIEWERS..we all have different taste. I notice people try the suggestions of others before trying the recipe as written.This was not the best meatloaf i've ever had but it was really good for a  quick, weekday meal. not everything has to be gourmet...sometimes i personally just want tasty and quick. This is exactly that.

My first ever meatloaf ! My husband loves traditional homecooked meals so I made it for him last night. He loved it!
I only used 1 lb of 80/20 ground beef, and used multigrain ciabata bread crumbs and about 8 wheat crackers I had in my pantry, 2% milk and added a little bit of salt and A1 to the beef mix... turned out delicious!!

I have made this meatloaf 3 times now & my whole family loves it.  Followed recipe, baking on a rack inside a baking dish so there is no greasy mess.  I have not had meatloaf with milk in it so I was skeptical but adding the milk gives the meatloaf a wonderful texture & moistness.  This has become a regular meal in my house, thank you!

This was great!!!

I put a little twist on it though.
I made it with ground turkey instead of ground beef, added spinach, minced garlic and 1/2 cup more of bread crumbs and it was delicious!

My husband loved it!

Ok. I made my own BBQ sauce and used that for the liquid. I used 3lbs of ground beef, 2 eggs, 1 small red oinion, bread crumbs, S&P, and some of my BBQ sauce. Put that in the oven on 350 for 45 minutes or so. With my sauce on the side and some roasted garlic mash, I was in heaven.

Finally a meatloaf we all enjoyed! Fast, easy, and if you adjust it up to 11 servings it makes two nice sized loaves you don't have to wait forever to cook!

Sorry to the poster, but this has to be one of the WORST meatloaf recipes I have ever tried.  Meatloaf was VERY bland, needed lots of extra seasonings and had WAY WAY WAY to much onion.  Maybe the onion she used was quite small, but with a regular sized onion I wouldn't use more than 1/2 if I wanted to attempt to try this again and remedy.  Very disappointed with the bland, onion full meatloaf.  0 stars :(

I have never followed a recipe for meatloaf in my life, and I probably never will again!!!!  I followed this recipe along with others suggestions of cooking the onion first, adding Worchestershire sauce and garlic.  Very dissapointed.  Did NOT like the kethcup/brown sugar topping at all!!  I normally just use plain ketchup and will from here on out!  Thanks for posting Mrs. Janet, but this recipe was not for me:)

I just made is yesterday and my family wants me to make it again for tomorrow's supper! Thanks for the recipe!

I accidentally forgot the milk, so this was a little chewier than I think it was supposed to be. Overall it was a good meatloaf, but I definitely prefer one with more of a barbecue background.

4 stars from me....2 stars from the family. I was THE laugh of the evening due to the brown sugar....my husband was having insulin rushes...hAha. My revisions/additions...I sauteed the onions, added fresh minced garlic, about a Tbls of baby rays (because that's the bbq sauce we like, added a splash of worcestershire sauce, parsley & fresh from the garden tomatoes. I also used ritz crackers instead of bread. I could tell without reading other reviews it needed some "extra" ingredients. Apparently others agreed (according the reviews I read afterwards...It didn't surprise me). It was more of a wet loaf, which I'm not crazy about. It DID have a great flavor though (a bit of the topping was scraped off & in place, I had some left over Ritz cracker crumbles to spinkle on top which the kids Loved). I divided my meatload into 3 smaller loafs, increased the oven temp to 365 & cooked it about 40 minutes. I added the sauce about 20 minutes after cooking to avoid burning. So, all in all, I give it 4 stars!

very yummy!

i made it with ground turkey. 
sauteed the onions in butter with a little crushed red pepper, salt and pepper, and a little bit of poultry seasoning.  added some Worcestershire sauce to the meat and the sauce.  used a little less mustard.  

next time i think ill use a little less brown sugar.  thought the sauce was a bit too sweet.

I give this 4 stars only because I altered the ingredients based on other reviewers and my own likes.   I make my hamburgers very similar but wanted something that differs.  So I did what I normally do with hamburgers which is add the eggs, milk, sauted onion with garlic, worcestershire sauce. Except this was meatloaf and I desired it to be different.  Sooo, with this meatloaf I made my own seasoned bread crumbs.  Simply by using "thin whiches" and grinding them with "Italian Herb" grinder from McCormick. Who knew? they came up with a great blend.  Anyway it worked great.  I did cut down on  the mustard in the sauce.  Only because I'm more a ketchup person; Great Meatloaf thank you to the reviewers it means so much!

I am not a connoisseur of meatloaf but this was the best I've ever had.  Very moist. I used Lamb instead of beef, did not saute' the onions but instead chopped them finely and they were fine.  Also did what others suggested and added 1 T. of Worcestershire.  I added 1 t. of garlic powder and 1 t. of Herbs de Provence and doubled the topping sauce.  Very flavorful and juicy. Excellent.

GREAT, GREAT, GREAT.  I substituted regular ketchup with spicy ketchup and worcestershire and doubled the glaze recipe.  I also used panko breadcrumbs and made a free formed loaf comprised of 1/3 pork 1/3 beef 1/3 veal with 1/2 cup of cubed prosciutto thrown in.  Utterly delicious.

Very tasty recipe.  I used a mix of beef, veal and pork (meatloaf/meatball mix).  Added a few heavy shakes of Worcestershire sauce and some garlic.  Will make this again!

There's obviously been a lot said about this recipe. I have been using this site for a long time and have rarely been disappointed. This is the 1st review I've left. This meatloaf could not have turned out any better. I did add the Worcestershire, some cayenne, a little Italian seasoning. It was extremely flavorful and attractive. The sauce was perfect.

Great! I did some changes, for example I used fresh bread cause I didn´t have any crumbs or saltines;I used some seasoners like garlic in the meat and basil on the sauce and added some bacon on the top. It came out perfect.

This was excellent! Very moist and took about 10 minutes to throw together. My three year old, who isn't a fan of the texture of meat, ate his whole slice because it's so nice and smooth. A new family favorite!

Good Stuff, nice easy way to use up some ground beef if there is too much snow on the grill/deck. Followed recipe pretty closely, I just added some additional herbs and spices. Also made it into 4 small loafs, just had to reduce the time a little.

This was the best Meatloaf recipe I've ever made.  I added a little garlic powder, parsley, and only about 1/2 of the onion.  I would recommend maybe cooking down the onion before adding it.  It seemed a little crunchy.

This is a very good basic meatloaf recipe. I used very lean ground beef. The only problem I had was the fat bubbled on top of the meatloaf. When trying to drain the fat off, most of my topping went with it. Also, I didn't add enough salt. The next time I make this, I will add a little more salt and take the meatloaf out of the oven about 10-15 minutes early and drain the fat. Then put my topping on and bake for the remaining minutes. My husband is a very picky eater, but he liked this recipe. It is also great the next day.

I loved it. it was super easy to make and it was delicious. I used italian seasoned crutons and crashed them as bread crumbs. I doubled the sauce. The next day made a meatloaf sandwich with the left overs and that was even better.

Easy to prepare & tasted great. I did a mix of tomato sauce & milk, and threw in some ground flax with the bread crumbs for added fibre.

I made this recipe last night but substituted the 1 cup milk for 1 small can tomato sauce and used crushed Ritz crackers for the crumbs.  Also agree with others...should have cooked for 30 min. longer.  It was delicious and moist.

This was a good recipe.  I did everything the same except I used 1/2 regular bread crumbs and 1/2 italian bread crumbs.  I also used dijon mustard instead of regular mustard!  I will definetly be making this again.  My kids, that can be picky, ate it up!

It was so delicious. I have wheat and dairy issues so I substituted rice bread crumbs and used unsweetened almond milk. I sauteed the onions in butter; added a little garlic and oregano because my bread crumbs were plain. When I made the sauce I followed the suggestion and doubled the ketchup and used a heaping tablespoon of mustard. I am definitely making it again. Thank you for this keeper.  It has replaced my Mom's recipe. (Paula Dean's potatoes were wonderful with it.)

Super easy recipe and great results!  I read other reviews, and took suggestions that included adding Worcestshire, and softening the onions in butter with garlic before adding to meatloaf mixture.  I also made the glaze with just ketchup, Worcestshire, dry mustard and a lot of freshly ground black pepper - spicy!  Meatloaf was super moist, had a nice, mellow onion flavor to it which was balanced nicely with the heat of the ketchup glaze.

I'm yet to taste it as a whole, but the juices and the topping plus the smell are divine, thus a 5 star rating.
I softened my onions in butter before adding it to the mix, I added 1tbsp Worcestershire sauce, only used 1/2c milk and started my bread crumbs at 1/2c and added gradually as I didn't want to make it TOO "loafy".  I used tinfoil throw-away pans so I didnt have stick or clean up.  I should have put bread on the bottom or used a lower percent fat ground beef because I had a LOT of shrinkage with 81% and a lot of juices.  
When I tested the temp it ruined the topping sauce, as a FYI, see if you can wait out testing the temp if you can/do. I only tested the temp because i wasn't using the recommended pan size and was making more than one loaf and didn't want to over or under cook.  How does the loaf in picture #1 turn out like that? I'll make this again, I won't give up!

I've been making this recipe for 20 years, but I omit the breadcrumbs to make it moister. Sometimes I make this into meatloaf muffins by greasing a muffin pan with a bit of oil, then adding the meatloaf mixture, and spreading the sauce on each. Makes about 10 "muffins", and my picky eaters love them!

This was really good! It's a quick and basic recipe.  I did not saute my onions, as usual, but made sure they were chopped very fine (picky kids). The raw onions add more flavor to the meat.  Instead of salt and pepper, I used a teaspoon of McCormicks steak seasoning. The sauce on top added a lot of flavor!

Very good meatloaf. Would add 1/2 the milk it called for and a few more bread crumbs. Flavor was wonderful...especially with green peppers.

My husband has never really cared for meatloaf but this recipe sounded so good that I had to take the chance!!  I have made it twice now and both times HE LOVED IT!!!  He even took leftovers in his lunch and all the guys he works with tried to talk him out of it!!  The only thing I did different  was to double the sauce.

I used 1 TBSP minced onion instead of a chopped onion and also added 1 TBSP of Worcestershire sauce. Very yummy!

Pretty good meatloaf. I only put in 3/4 cup of bread crumbs, used turkey ground, also a few dashes of Italian seasoning and added chopped bell pepper that I sauté with the onions and a little butter. I also used just a tad less brown sugar. I'd make it again.

Great recipe. I used a 9x13 dish and the meatloaf was very moist. I added the worcestershire sauce(that was suggested) but accidently left out the milk. It still turned out great. Will make this again. Thanks

Awesome, yum, added the changes, sauted the onions in butter and garlic, doubled the topping but did half ketchup and half head country bbq sauce, and cut back on the brown sugar. Wow, so good. Husband said best meatloaf he's ever had, that is the first time he's ever told me something I cooked was the best he's ever had.

Very good, easy meatloaf!  Definitely took the advice of others to double the sauce, saute the onions, and add 1 Tbsp of Worcetshire (sp?) sauce!  Next time I'm going to rig it so that the fat/oil from the meat can drip to an underlying pan.

yes it's easy, and sort of boring. I followed the recipe exactly except added garlic powder and worshestire, and still little flavor. Won't make this one again, at least not without many modifications.

Followed exactly and it was so good. Except maybe next time I'll do what others say and saute the onions :) ... Also, I used dijon mustard and added worcestershire sauce.

This was my first attempt at making meatloaf ever and this one turned out very moist and flavorful with a few minor changes...  Took the advice to 1)Saute the onion in butter with some garlic before adding to the mixture and 2)Add 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce for flavor.  3)My fiance really hates mustard & won't eat anything with it, so I made the sauce just from brown sugar and ketchup and it turned out great!  I accidentally used 2lbs of ground beef instead of 1.5 but the overall taste and consistency was good... it came out moist but very "loose"... probably will cut back the amount of meat next time or at least add maybe 1/4 c. or more breadcrumbs to help fix the texture.  Anyway, because of this, mine took slightly longer, about 1hr, 7 minutes.  Just cook until the temp reads 160-165 or higher.  :)  Will definitely make this again!

This recipe is fantastic!!  We did saute the onions and added a tablespoon of worchestershire sauce, but it was delicious.  We have made it with ground beef, but also with ground turkey and it was delicious.  Usually have meatloaf sandwiches for leftovers and that's even better.  Definitely my favorite meatloaf!!

Decided after a long day to go with this easy, quick, delicious recipe. Comfort winter food at its best! I did not add the addition of Worcestershire sauce to keep sodium to a minimum and  to allow the natural flavors of the beef to come out. Both my Fiance and myself loved the mild flavor with the hint of sweet/tart from the sauce.

This meatloaf was delicious!  I loved the sauce on the top.  I even told my husband "it tastes like meatloaf!", because it seems my meatloaf usually tastes like meatballs, which is fine, but I'd rather it tasted like this recipe.  I used a lb. of ground turkey so I adjusted the bread crumbs and milk to 2/3 cup.  I also added a handful of fresh grated parm. cheese and a teaspoon worchestire sauce and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, but just because I always have to improvise.  Delicious!

Good but a little bland. Salting/peppering more and/or adding worcestershire sauce or some other herb would probably make it better. The glazed parts were really good, might be good to mix some of that mixture in with the meat.

I used this basic recipe but added a hint of spice - fresh minced jalapeño, and sauteed onions, garlic, carrots and red potatoes and my secret seasoning.  I also  added the brown sugar and the ketchup onto the mix :S looks a bit dry, but it came out soo moist and delicious! Hands down the best meatloaf I've ever made (I'm mexican and most of the time cook authentic mexican food) but this one is a KEEPER! Thank you for sharing and making our lives a LOT easier!!

You have got to be kidding me!  This is THE BEST AND EASIEST meatloaf I've ever had!!!!!!  I used Italian breadcrumbs (in the can) since I was out of plain ones, and it may have made this even better.  But, aside from my change, this was AMAZING!!!  I'm keeping this forever.

This was the first meatloaf I ever made.  Read a lot of reviews and made some changes.  I used 1/2 turkey, 1/2 beef mix to cut down the fat.  Was going to add Worcestershire sauce as other suggested and found I had none so used soy sauce instead. Sauteed onion,, green onion, and garlic in butter as other suggested. Also doubled sauce recipe, but used less dijon mustard. I read reviews on other meatloaf recipes that baked in cupcake form and did the same.  350 for 25 minutes with the convection on.  Much faster and each meatloaf cupcake was a serving.  Also put some bread at the bottom of each cupcake form to soak up the excess fat prior to putting meat in.  Hubby and kids both loved it!  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

Good recipe but I had to cook it 1 hour and 50 minutes before it was done.  I cooked it on a glass loaf pan.  I will use it again.

Loved this dish with a few changes based on the other reviews. First I sautéed the onions so they were not to crunchy, added garlic salt and a bit of BBQ sauce to the meat. Then cut down on the mustard and added Worcestershire sauce instead for the topping. It was a bit soggy based on the cooking time provided so I cooked it for 1 hour 20 minutes. It was very yummy. Everyone ate it and did not complain which is a miracle with a 5yr old and 22month old boys. The only thing I would do differently next time is make more of the topping which other users suggested as well.

I read some of the previous reviews and added changes from their suggestions. It was wonderful and very easy. Definately a big hit at my house and is now in our meal rotation.

Excellent meatloaf, even better sauce! I cut down on the mustard, but overall I followed the recipe pretty closely.

This recipie is amazing! No matter how the recipie is adjusted for company - it always works out!  If you have weak tummy for raw onions - I grill them beforehand and then add them to the ground beef mixture before cooking in oven.  Delicioius!

SO glad I looked at this recipe, it's the same recipe I used when I was a new wife--can't remember where I first saw this recipe, maybe in a supermarket magazine. I lost my copy years ago and was happy to find it again here. This is a classic meatloaf that is as easy as it is delicious!

this is my go to meatloaf recipe. very easy as the name implies. i follow the recipe as written, but i have substituted crushed crackers or cornflakes for the breadcrumbs, whatever i have at the time.  i'm sure there are better recipes out there, but until i find it this meatloaf will be the one i make.

Agreed- a no fail recipe. Had to to cook a little longer, but will try letting the meat rest next time. Will also saute the onions first. Very good!

Great meatloaf!  My kids and hubby love it.  I did half BBQ sauce and half ketchup and left out the mustard.  I also did half ground beef and half ground pork.  Delicious!

I modified this recipe and it was fantastic!!! I used 1 lb of ground pork & 1lb of ground chicken 2 eggs, 1 Large Onion saute in olive oil (just till lightly browned, 1 1/2 c. crutons & club crackers and a splash of milk.  NO SALT AT ALL (which was hard for me) but instead used Accent, garlic powder, onion powder, garlic pepper (very little) Sauce:  Ketchup, Mustard, & Splenda Brown Sugar Everyone Raved Over This!!

This is a quick and easy get home from work and assemble meal.    Or even easier is to make it ahead and freeze!  Just take out and unthaw a day ahead and even the teenage boys can put it in the oven for an hour!  (Now one of my regular recipe's for batch cooking)   I have made it with and without sauteing the onions first and it definitely tastes better with sauteed onions.  I also add a bit of fresh garlic to the pan with the onions.  I found the milk to be too much liquid so I cut it down to 3/4 cup.  Great with a side of potatoes / rice and a salad!

I SERVED IT AND MY 12 YEAR OLD THAT SAYS HEY I DON'T DO MEATLOAF, WHEN I PLACED IT IN FRONT OF HIM AND CAME BACK FIVE MINUTED LATER IT WAS GONE.  I WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING. THE TOPPING ADDS ALL THE FLAVOR IT WAS WONDERFUL

Excellent! It was my first time ever making meatloaf and this recipe was very simple to follow. I did brown the onions in butter and added garlic to them. I also only used 1tbsp of mustard and added a little Parmesan cheese. Next time I want to try adding the Worcestershire sauce to it.

I made this with turkey and omitted the milk.  As others suggested, added worschire sauce and caramelized the onions too.  Very easy and yum. Another fun thing I did with some of the meat mixture is put a large tablespoon of it in a cupcake wrapper, topped it with 4-5 baby spinach leaves, topped that with 1 teaspoon of mozzeralla cheese, a slice of roma tomato, more mozzeralla cheese.  Put it in a cupcake pan and baked at 350 for 25 minutes (until cheese was browned).  Very yummy and gourmet.

I was doubtful as I put it the mixture of the pan, for it seemed too wet.  Sure enough, it was actually too moist.  Perhaps with less milk...  I normally enjoy a brown sugar or ketchup glaze on meatloaf, but this "sauce" was not very good.  Edible, but won't make it again.

This is a good meatloaf, great for kids because it's on the sweet side. My mom has always made this recipe and now I make it for my family. It's very good with ground turkey, and I have to use 2 pounds to feed my family of 5. I use 1/2 cup ketchup and add half of the "topping" to the meatloaf mixture.

Absolutely nothing special.  Glaze I give a 4/5 and the meatloaf itself I give a 2/5.  The meatloaf itself was bland.  I prefer to use the packaged meatloaf seasoning I buy in the store rather than this recipe again.  Everyone in my family liked the glaze but prefer their meatloaf w/o it.

Meatloaf is my husbands favorite meal, but I have yet to make a winner...until now.  I didn't change the recipe a bit, and it turned out perfectly.  The only thing I'll change when I make it again, is I will double the sauce.

excellent meatloaf! I added the Worcestershire sauce and sauted the onion w/chopped garlic (as the other reviewer said) and it came out amazing. I used saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs. A tip: I mix the crumbs, onion, s & p, egg, & worcestershire sauce together first, then add the beef. I do that so i know there is even distribution of ingredients thoughout. I didn't add the milk and it was still excellent. For the topping I used 2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard, 2 tablespoons brwn sugar & 1/2 c ketchup and poured it on meatloaf at last 10 min. of cooking. Sauted onions did make a difference. When you take it out of the oven, let it rest about 5 min. before slicing. This was the best recipe for meatloaf i've found so far. My husband really loved it.. It was very juicy. thx!

A very good and easy to prepare meatloaf.  My family especially liked the topping.  I made a few small changes.  I used 2 lbs of beef because that's what I had.  I also only used half a yellow onion and sauteed it in a tablespoon of butter with one and a half teaspoons minced garlic.  I used mostly Italian style bread crumbs because that's what I had and I increased the crumbs a little (my 1 cup was mounded) since I was using more meat. I also added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.  After mixing everything together I patted it into an 11x7 pan and since it was a little thinner than it would have been in a loaf pan it only took 55 minutes to cook to 175 degrees on the meat thermometer.  It was very moist.

Good, some tang to it.  I doubled the recipe and mixed everything together rather than make the outside sauce.  Sauteed the onions and added worchestiershire as recommended. Baked it in a 9x13 pan at 380 degrees for 50 or so minutes.  Yum.

For meatloaf, this was pretty good.  Per other reviews I made the following changes: sauted the onions in some butter before adding to the meat mixture; used italian bread crumbs; added 1 tbs of worstechier sauce; added in some garlic powder; doubled the sauce (I did omit the mustard too, but that's because I hate the stuff, lol).  Thanks for sharing!  :)

I made this for the first time this week and my husband said "Make it like that from now on!" I followed others comments 1) adding 1 Tbsp Worestershire, 2) sautee 1/2 onion and 1/2 green pepper, 3) use Italian breadcrumbs and 4) double the sauce, (but only 3 Tbsp of mustard). The recipe doesn't specify cover or uncovered, so I covered for the first 30, then uncovered for the rest of the time. This one will be a regular in our house!

Very easy and tastes great.  I was skeptical about the topping of mustard, ketchup and brown sugar...It was great!! I did saute the onions with a little butter and garlic.

My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed this meatloaf! I made it the first time about two weeks ago and was craving it again tonight! I made the following adjustments: I used onion powder instead of fresh onions, Italian bread crumbs instead of regular and for the topping, I only used one tbs of brown sugar and mustard instead of two. It was a little too tangy/sweet for me the first time. Also, I made it in a mini-loaf pan which cuts the cooking time by about 15-20 minutes and makes it easy to pack leftovers for lunch the nexdt day. This is a very easy recipe using very common ingredients that I will certainly keep in the dinner rotation.

This is so easy to make, and it tastes delicious!! I took the other users' suggestions and used seasoned bread crumbs. I also like to add some rooster sauce to the ketchup blend to give it a little kick. If my husband is too hungry to wait out the baking time, I'll make 4 mini meatloaves instead.. then it only takes about 30 minutes to bake. Great recipe!

Wonderful!  I was looking for my recipe that calls for some of these ingredients and white cheddar cheese.  I couldn't find it, so I just added some white cheddar cheese and it came out great.  We double wrap in foil and cook on the grill - indirect heat for about 1 hour, flipping it over ever 6-8 minutes.

I really liked this recipe. I used 93/7 beef, substituted an envelope of onion soup mix instead of the onion (didnt have time to chop it up and saute it), used italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain breadcrumbs, added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce to the meat, doubled the ketchup mix (though I halved the amount of brown sugar that the recipe called for, to decrease the sweetness), and added about a heaping tablespoon of barbecue sauce to the ketchup mix to give it a little more tang. Wonderful!! Husband gobbled it down.

Easy to make. And finally, a meatloaf my kids love! Instead of chopped onion I added powdered onion. Meatloaf was moist and set up well. I usually have trouble with my meatloaf crumbling. But not with this recipe. Thanks!

Wonderful recipe. I did not add the sugar and used a cup of dried stuffing mix rather than bread crumbs, which I always do, and added garlic.

This was a wonderful meatloaf, though I did make a few changes and additions. I sauteed the onion with garlic, and used seasoned bread crumbs. Usually I'm a fan of lots of ketchup on my meatloaf, during and after baking, so I took someone else's suggestion and doubled the ketchup/mustard/sugar mixture-it turned out to be the perfect amount.

I made this meatloaf and have to say.. absolutely delicious, moist, flavourful!  A real crowd pleaser!  Added Worcestershire sauce and doubled the sauce quantity!  THe only downside is the higher fat content. I am a big fan of cooking " clean, nutritious and low fat", however, this is still getting 5 stars. A real treat once in a while!

Such a great simple recipe. I've made a couple of meatloaf recipes in the last weeks looking for the taste of this one! 4 stars because I changed it up just a little bit. So easy, threw all of the ingredients into the Cuisinart and added two cloves of garlic and a little salt and pepper. Threw it in the loaf pan with the the topping and cooked it for an hour and 15 minutes -- it was perfect! So glad to have finally found this staple recipe - next time I'll be making this with turkey and adding a little heat with some jalapenos or red pepper flakes.

I LOVE this recipe, but I do change it a bit.  I add more of the ketchup mixure, I add green peppers, and I use saltine crackers instead of the bread crumbs and it comes out DELICIOUS.  My whole family loves it including my very picky 9 year old!

This was very easy to make and tastes great.  My whole (picky) family enjoyed it!!!  The only changes I made were to add 1 Tbsp of worcestershire sauce and I sauteed the onion based on other reviews.  Next time I make it I think I will increase the worcestershire sauce to 2 Tbsp and add some garlic to give it just a little more flavor.  The sauce on top was wonderful - we loved the sweet, but tangy flavor.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This recipe was fantastic! I had never made meatloaf before and I decided to try this one. The only thing I did different was add about a teaspoon and a half of garlic powder and I doubled the topping. But it was great! Thank you so much posting this meatloaf! I will definitely use it again!

This turned out great!  I used about a half a pound of soy crumbles to up the fiber content and reduce the fat.

This really is the only meatloaf recipe you'll ever need. Having a 6 month old infant, my husband and I are big on quick and easy meals. This one is the best! We call it "weekly meatloaf" because we have it once a week now. DELICIOUS!

Tasty meatloaf that was very quick and easy to make. I only used 1 lb. of beef, so I reduced the amount of milk. This recipe is a keeper!!

This was very good!  I made the recipe exactly as is.  The bread crumbs I used were Italian, so it had a little bit of a kick to it.  It was very easy and so tastey!  I will be making this again.

As is this is a very good basic recipe.  Our family was very happy but it does need a bit more flavoring.  Next time I will use seasoned bread crumbs and add some garlic for some more flavor.

I doubled the sauce, but did half the brown sugar...and it was still wayyyy too sweet for my family.  We all kindof scraped off the sauce and ate it otherwise. Will probably make it again, but without any sauce.

I thought this was delicious!  The only things i changed where that i used onion powder instead of onions since me and my husband don't like onions.  And I used cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  Also we were out of brown sugar so i used regular sugar in the sauce.  But I loved this recipe and will definetly be making it again in the future!

Needed an easy meal and was short on ingredients and this fit the bill!  I doubled the topping and only used about a quarter of the mustard suggested.  Really didn't need the extra topping since it ran out into the 9x13 pan and just made a mess and burned (not affecting meatloaf taste).  I used seasoned bread crumbs because that's all I had and added a little worcestershire powder to the meat.  Not bad at all for a super-easy meatloaf recipe.  Would have given 5 stars, but mustard is way too much for my taste and prefer a little worcestershire in the topping and a smidgen of garlic in the meat.  Still, worth a solid 4 stars.

this is my first time making meatloaf and i decided to go with this recipe because I had all the ingredients in hand. I used lean ground turkey and 2 fresh whole wheat bread instead of crumbs and added carrots, garlic and celery! i used only 1 TBSP brown sugar and 1 TBSP of mustard and 1/2 tbsp of dijon mustard. came out wonderful..the next time i will cut back a little on the bread so it can come out even juicier!

Awesome! I don't even like meatloaf, but I loved this recipe. My husband said it is the best he's ever had. I took the advice of another and used a tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce. I also added 3 chopped cloves of fresh garlic. I'm not a huge ketchup fan, so I skipped making the topping. It turned out delicious, and was so flavorful that it didn't need a sauce.

it was definitely delicious! i also modified by sauteing onions, garlic and a tomato beforehand, and extending cook time to 1 hour 30 minutes.  I also drained the meatloaf after it was cooked, it had an excess amount of oil.

Good.  Added an extra egg, also sauted onion and garlic in butter before adding.  Mixed 1/4 c bbq sauce with ketchup.    And to please the cheese lovers in my family, I threw in a little shredded parmesan cheese.  Very tasty.
The first time I made this recipe, I placed sliced potatoes in the bottom of the pan before adding the meat...it flavored them nicely and cooked them to perfection.

I made this last night for dinner and it was spectacular!! And tonight we had cold left-over meatloaf sandwiches and they were the yummiest! I even made it with turkey and one would never know it was turkey! It was so moist. I think the sauteed onion did it, and oh, I added 1/2 red bell pepper, cut up really small, to the turkey. Ya just gotta try this!!! Slathered the top with plian ol' ketchup ( hubby hates sweetness).

Normally I do not like meatloaf, BUT this is really, really good.  I needed something to do with ground beef and I always wanted to find a meat loaf that I could enjoy - well, I found it! Awesome the next day as a sandwich too. I will make this again for sure. Everyone loved it, even the toddler!

WoW! I love this recipe... I had never made meatloaf... but this recipe was so easy to make! I followed the original instructions... I don't think there is need for more ketchup or cooking the onions... I just added some fresh chopped spinach and cilantro... it was awesome! I am eating it right now but I had to come and give my review... I hope my husband likes it too... I am sure he will.

I will never use another meatloaf recipe other than this one! Ever since finding this recipe, it's a favorite in my family and requested often. My husband even broke down and said it was better than his mother's. High praise from him! LOL
Easy and so delicious. The glaze makes it so much better than ordinary meatloaf. Thanks for sharing it with us.

WOW! my husband and I loved this recipe and will make it more often. I took some advice from others like adding a little bit of garlic powder and frying the onions in butter! TURNED OUT GREAT! 5 stars for sure!

The meatloaf was easy to fix and we loved the topping on it, but the flavor was just to bland for us.

This meatloaf is ridiculously easy to make and tastes SO good! I had one piece of it before my boyfriend ate the rest of it, so I'll be making this again soon.

This was so easy and economical.  I added fresh garlic but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was full of flavor and stuck together very nicely.  Will make again.

My fiance did not like meatloaf growing up, so when I first made this for him, I was nervous.  He looked at it with skepticism, but to my surprise and his, he loved it!  It's now one of his most requested meals.  I have changed the recipe a tiny bit.  I add more seasonings, including worcestishire sauce, and I bake it for an extra 30 minutes.  When I only baked it for an hour, it wasn't even close to being done.

My boyfriend and I love this. I do make a few changes, I add bell pepper instead of onion since the boyfriend doesn't like them.  I find the "glaze" a little too mustardy so I might use a little less next time but makes GREAT leftovers.  I'll make it with peas and mashed potatoes.

This was a hit at our house! It was easy to make...I cooked it for about 15 minutes longer...used onion powder only because my children would not eat it if they saw chopped onions throughout it...and I doubled the topping and used it in the meatloaf as well as on top. It was delicious...and the only meatloaf I will ever make for now on! Thanks!!

My daughter who doesn't like meatloaf, was very dissapointed to find out what was for dinner! But she loved it and asked for seconds. I used ground turkey instead of beef and still was very good. It's a keeper!!

This is the best meatloaf ever!  When I make it, I double the recipe for the brown sugar topping.  I also have to cook it for about 20 minutes longer than the recipe states, or I up the temperature to 400 degrees and cook for an hour.  I make this meatloaf atleast once a month!  Everyone loves it.

This recipe is wonderful!  The glaze is terriffic as well; it adds a bit of zip to it.  I didn't have an onion, so I used Onion powder which worked rather well.  I also added "One Step Seasoning for Beef" to give it another little bit of zest.  My 18 month old son loves this meatloaf!  Thanks again:-)

This recipe is just like my mom used to make, thought that it would be easy enough to log on here and see what I could find to make some thing different then the norm. We just like plain old ketchup on it though, and it ABSOLUTELY NEEDS ONIONS!! lol we had ran out of onions and I thought that i could get by without them, but they make the whole dish and gives it GREAT flavor!! :o)

good, to much sugar!!
It must be 2tbs not 2 cups, take my advice, do not put 2 cups of sugar it will choke you down!

I haven't made meatloaf in years and wanted to try it.  This was a little sweet because of the amount of brown sugar, but overalls, very good and economical.  It WAS easy to make.

I've never been a fan of meatloaf (could be the name!) but I make it occasionally for my family.  They were WILD about this recipe.  They loved the sauce, not too sweet, not too sour.  It's only been two days since I tried the recipe and they've already asked me to make it again.

I doubled this recipe, thats 2 whole pounds of ground beef and my family of 6 (2 toddlers) ate the entire loaf, except for one slice that I saved for myself for lunch the next day, but it too got ate by the kids for lunch. 

My family loved this recipe.

I confess, I am terrible about exact measurements. I get close, plus our minus.  I use brown deli mustard in the topping and am a bit heavy with it, plus extra brown sugar and I add a couple of fat dashes of Worstershire sauce.  It imparts a great flavor and helps tenderize the meat.   As for the beef, using the recipe measurements, I replace a half pound of beef with a half pound of Jimmy Dean's sage breakfast sausage.  Once you make them, wrap them in plastic wrap, put them in a gallon ziploc bag and then into the freezer for at least three days. It gives the ingredients a chance ro mingle and mature. 

My family is nuts about this recipe, especially my finicky nine year old.

WOW. Very delicious. I used about 1.75 pounds of ground beef and made two loaves. I kept everything the same, except I used Paleo panko instead of breadcrumbs. I served this with steamed broccoli and a green salad. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

Excellently! I added 1T worchestershire sauce and used meatloaf mix instead of straight up pork and it was delicious! Also doubled the sauce recipe. Will cut the amount of sugar in the sauce next time.

Wonderful.  Ketchup and mustard simple but delish.   Comfort food for sure- proud to have a recipe I can serve as moms meatloaf:-).   Finally!  Can’t wait to make again...I tend to eat like a bird and not big into beef but I can put this away!   Oh and I used almond milk instead of dairy, added minced onion and Worcester’s sauce and for my crumbs used toasted leftover hotdog buns ground up- it works!

Enjoyed this recipe. Very tasty. Made it with 2 lbs of turkey meat. Very easy to make, but took longer than 10 minutes of prep time. Wished I had the review that suggested letting the meat rest before cutting. May have been good to drain excess liquid during cooking or reducing amount of milk. Very moist, yet there seemed to bee too much liquid. My first time to make meat loaf :)

Yes, very easy, and a crowd pleaser. I didn’t change a thing, except I doubled the recipe and froze half. We are the frozen portion tonight and it was just as good.  If you are one of those who likes to prepare meals ahead to freeze and have over the next couple of weeks,  there is a slow cooker meatball recipe in allrecipes that is identical to this one, except you add Italian seasonings and omit milk.  They are easy to make at the same time as you will already have the ingredients out. Very good!

Only part I liked was the topping/glaze mixture. The meatloaf was very bland and mushy... or as my husband said kinda soupy... I followed the directions to a "T"! My husband was shocked because 99% of the time the food I cook he loves. Would try and find a different recipe or mod this one.

I love the recipe. It came out perfect. The only thing I did different was double the glaze used to put on top of the meatloaf. The glaze recipe to put on the meatloaf is a step above just using tomato sauce or paste. It’s everything!

Stumbled upon this recipe when my husband asked me to make a meatloaf for dinner one night.  Made the recipe exact,  but there's waaaaay too much brown sugar in the recipe.  Made it again,  and made it with half a teaspoon of brown sugar,  and it came out so much better! Definitely my go to meatloaf recipe!

I have made it according to directions as well as altering and it's always a hit. My husband really likes the brown sugar and ketchup in meatloaf so sometimes i omit onions and peppers and just add egg, milk, bread crumbs, brown sugar, and ketchup. Then glaze with only ketchup and brown sugar, leaving out mustard. It always turns out great, it's my go-to recipe.

We really love this recipe. It is our favorite, hands down. We like that the topping of ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar is sweet. The meatloaf is super moist. Highly recommend this recipe!

Update: 5/13/19 I just made it again and it turned out amazing. It was a smash hit with my friends. Thank you for the recipe! I never am going to try another meatloaf recipe. This is the one! ??

Made this recipe recently and it was the best meatloaf I've ever had!   However ... I made one mistake:   I mixed most of the ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar into the meat mixture.   I caught myself as I was ladling the last of this mixture into the meat mixture, so had maybe about 15% of the mixture still available to put on top.   I'm glad I made the mistake, because I think it improved upon the original recipe!  I'm making it again tonight, and I mixed about half of the ketchup mixture into the meat, and spread the rest on top.

My go to recipe for meatloaf, always a hit in my house.  I use seasoned breadcrumbs, saute the onions in butter and garlic before adding them to the mix.  I also add 2tbsp of Worcester sauce and seasoned pepper to the mix for a little added zing

This was a great recipe and I will make it again! As usual, suggestions from previous reviews were very helpful. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain and added a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce. I also used a seasoning blend of chopped onion, green pepper, and red bell pepper instead of only using onion. I will likely add chopped or sliced mushrooms next time I make it. I was afraid I wouldn't have enough sauce so I doubled it. That turned out to be a good thing as it made just enough. The men in my family loved this meatloaf.

Outstanding!!!  I will definitely make this meat loaf again!!!  Followed the recipe and it was very good!!! - Feb 19, 2019
UPDATE:  Tried again for the second time--still outstanding!!!
This time I added chopped onions with red, yellow, and green bell peppers and minced garlic to the mixture.  I also added about five sprinkles of worchestershire sauce to the mix.  For the sauce topping, I used a blend of regular yellow mustard and honey dijon brown mustard.  Makes it a little more spicy!!!     --Mar 8, 2019

very tasty! made a couple of changes.

sautéed the onions in some oil and garlic (like was suggested) and added a bit more than a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce. also only used a few squirts of mustard, and added just a pinch of sriracha in the sauce. 

can't wait to make this again!

Love this recipe (shhh, it’s way better than my mother’s meat loaf) and have made it many times. I do add Worcestershire sauce and a little garlic, and I think next time maybe I’ll try sautéing the onion and garlic together first. Also, I double the sauce on top, but cut back a little on the brown sugar.

OH MY GOODNESS....YUM!!
I've made this 3 times now!
My husband loves that I've finally found a meatloaf that tastes great!

I made the sauce with 1Tblsp mustard and4 Tblsp brown sugar. I also used Ritz Crackers instead of bread crumbs.
Delicious!!!
And, of course, I can never remember to take pics!
Next time!

My first time making meatloaf and it was a hit!  I am guilty of making a few modifications based on preference.  Sautéed the onions with a bit of butter and garlic just to soften them up a bit.  Added a tbsp of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mix and about a tsp to the sauce.  Topped with a few slices of bacon before it went in the oven because that’s how my grandmother always made it, and bacon makes everything better!!  Used a foil lined baking dish with two pieces of bread in the bottom to soak up some of the grease.  Baked for an hour and 20 mins and served with mashed potatoes and peas.  This made an amazing comfort meal and I can’t wait for the meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow!

Wow, you really can't beat this!  I've never been a huge meatloaf fan... usually kinda dry and over spiced/salty heartburn-bomb.  This one changed my life! The dairy (see milk) and breadcrumbs come together create the juiciest, most tender, bundle of joy I've ever tucked into my  cheek (

My family loved it- the adults, that is. The kids not so much, but that's ok, they are the pickiest eaters known to man. They even turn down chocolate! The meatloaf was awesome. Followed directions to a T.  Will be making more of this soon!

I make this all the time. I had a little Parmesan cheese, but that's about it. The recipe is very simple and easy to do. Often I substitute making the barbecue sauce for the top with a premade sauce. Something a little spicier. But, this recipe is amazing and easy.

Was a good recipe I took out the brown sugar completely because I started making this and realized I did not have any milk...but I did have some vanilla ice cream! SO I substituted the milk for the ice cream and it turn out just fine, it added come sweetness to it, but not as much as I thought it would.

Why is the prep time always so underestimated?

I JUST popped my loaf of meat in the oven. Rated 5 stars ahead of time because I know this is gonna be good! The raw meat smelled good to me and it's similar to the way my mom makes it. I don't think I've ever seen her use milk in hers.

I added a few good splashes of worchestshire sauce and a nice dash of garlic powder like a few others mentioned, along with some spicy brown mustard from another recipe. It looks and smells fantastic!

If it turns out not so good, I'll come back and change my rating. I'm pretty confident about this one though. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Best meatloaf I ever tried! I am a very young cook and meat is not my strong suit, so I was a bit nervous about making a meatloaf, but the recipe was super easy and quick and the meatloaf came out unrealistically delicious and super soft. Both thumbs up!

I modified this recipe because I wanted a version with more veggies. I used 1/4 cup of chopped onion, 1/2 cup chopped celery, 1/2 cup chopped zucchini, 1/2 cup chopped spinach (frozen), 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar, 1 extra egg, and coconut cream instead of milk. For the sauce, I left out the brown sugar and added 1 tablespoon of BBQ sauce, 1 teaspoon of A1 sauce, and a few drops of liquid smoke for a smokier taste. The result was AMAZING! This gave me a beautifully moist and veggie-stuffed meatloaf that seemed like a meal all by itself. So good the pan barely made it to the table. Thank you for a giving me a great starting point!

First meatloaf I ever made and it was very tasty!! My boyfriend said he usually doesn’t like meatloaf because he can’t already tell it’s beef that he is eating and always adds ketchup. But this time it didn’t mess with his taste buds! He could tell it was beef and it was so good no ketchup needed plus the Mac and cheese wasn’t the best part of the meal!! I also had cheats Italian bread on the side. I used just a tad more seasoned breadcrumbs then it called for, used a little less milk than it called for, and only chopped up half of the red onion. Love it

I made the suggested changes of extra topping and less brown sugar. I also used a spoonful of minced garlic instead of onion. I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground turkey as I normally do for ground beef recipes. Excellent. The whole family loved it.

I made mine with venison. I chopped up 4 strips of cooked bacon and add it to the mixture. I didn't mix the mustard, brown sugar, and ketchup. I used straight ketchup.

Turned out good. Don't like the taste the mustard gives. Makes it seem like it wants to be a giant burger. Which is not what I like for a meatloaf. So I tossed that glaze & instead I replaced the mustard with Worcestershire sauce & added 1TBSP of honey. Delish!

I Instead of putting the ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar mixture on top, I mixed it in with the milk before adding it to the meatloaf mixture! It turns out so good!!  I love this recipe! I've made it twice now and both times I've made more than just one batch!

It was great - made exactly as recipe. Comments on changes made can be helpful, however there should be a rule that doesn't allow someone to say they made this recipe if they changed more than one ingredient or step. Those cases should be entered as a new recipe with credit given to the original one.  It cracks me up when someone says they made it but they changed things.  For example: substituted x, y and z and didn't do steps 3, 4 or 5 etc.  Too funny.

great recipe! i made some changes of my own for it being my first time making meatloaf. for starters, ive tried it three ways. i started with making the meatloaf. i used hamburger season ing, adobe, eggs, saltine crackers, little garlic seasoning a few very tiny cubed green bell peppers. i mixed that all up. i took half of the meat in a small square pan flattened it out evenly. then i took thick slices of velvetta cheese (i also used mozzerella and coby jack for the other two times) i placed those slices evenly over top the meat. after tht i then spread the remainder of the meat on top of the cheese. pressing the edges closed. lastly, i smeared BBQ sauce on top (traded it for ketchup, also tried different flavors of bbq) and placed it in the oven. after the w0 mins or so cook time, the meatloaf turned out AMAZING! had slight crunches and cheesy plus meaty. i called it a 3 in 1 LOL

Added green pepper and used fresh bread cubed. Have made Two times now and Loved it both times. Simple and Easy. Open to additional flavoring If desired.I've made this with combo of beef/pork,beef/chorizo, beef/Italian sausage. The best recipe for adjusting flavors. Can't recommend enough.

I adjusted the quantities to make a 3 lb meatloaf and added 1/2 cup more breadcrumbs, shredded carrots, shredded celery and used a red onion instead of yellow - needless to say it came out fantastic!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  :)

My husband complained for years I didn't make a good meatloaf. Well he doesn't complain anymore , this meatloaf recipe is excellant. I did add the Worcestershire sauce and I did sauté onion and garlic in butter before adding it to the meat. I also cut down on the onion, we only needed a little to flavor it.

I've made this several times and the family loves it.
I add  few things though. I add jalapeno's, and red bell pepper.
Instead of bread/cracker crumbs I use a cup of oats. One of our favorites.

This is the best meatloaf  I have ever made.  My widowed father-in-law  loves meatloaf and every time I tried it,  it was dry and not very good.  I learned that I was using too lean of beef (97/3).  I changed to using 80/20 or so and you can mix it with a sausage too for depth of flavor.  The milk makes it really sloppy when trying to shape it but makes it so moist and delicious! Great leftovers as sliders on those Hawaiian dinner rolls too. Thanks for a great recipe !

This is an excellent base meatloaf recipe that you can make little changes to easily.  It's a foolproof recipe, and you can play with seasonings, add cheese, whatever you want.  Highly recommend!

Made it just like the recipe...very good and tasty sauce! The leftovers the next day were even better. I used a vidalia onion which didn't seem to cook all the way even though I cooked it in the loaf for 1hr 20mins. I also used a 13 x 9 glass dish so made the loaf smaller and placed it in the middle. 

Some recommendations: Cook until 1hr 20mins, precook the onions & make more sauce!

This was a very tasty meatloaf, and not heavy like some of them can be. My son likes very few meals I make! But he loved this! I added a little cayenne for a mild heat.

I just realized I've never reviewed this meatloaf and it definitely deserves one! I've been making it for years, using all different meats.. beef, pork, veal, sometimes turkey when I'm feeling plump. The simplicity of this recipe is what makes it delicious. Don't get fancy people, it's meatloaf! I've  tried TONS of different meatloaf recipes, but always come back to this one. Very quickly you will not have to read a recipe because there are not a lot of ingredients making it easy to remember. I have tried to fancy it up, refusing to believe the simplest recipe is the best. I've sauteed the onions first, but the flavor is better with just raw onions, chopped finely. I've added other herbs and spices, nope, not as good. I wrapped in bacon, not so much and too greasy. Ok, so I do add one thing not on the list b/c I love it so much I could bathe in it... Worcestershire sauce, a few shakes in the meat and a few in the topping. Happy cooking :)

I just made this for my brother, sister and roommate and they loved it.  This was my very first meatloaf ever.   They told me that the only thing bad about it was that there wasn't more.  So now, only two nights later, I am making it again.

Only problem is that it took me about two hours to bake it.  After one hour, it was still red inside.  But it was soooooo yummy!

As per family tradition I had to add ketchup into the meat mix before putting it into the pan. I also waited until the last 10 minutes to put on the top layer made up of ketchup/mustard/brown sugar mix because I didn't want it to burn. Overall, it's a really good recipe.

Based on all the positive reviews I made this recipe exactly as the recipe states. I'm an experienced cook. So my wife and I were both surprised at how average this tasted based on the reviews.To each his own.

Very good recipe. I used 2 lbs of ground beef, 1/2 an onion (my wife and son hate onion), and doubled the ketchup and mustard with the same amount of brown sugar as other reviewers say it's too sweet, and we like a lot of ketchup on our meatloaf. I also always use stoneware my step-mother got us years ago and I swear by it for meatloaf. Great recipe. Tonight will be the 4th time I've used this recipe OVER my wife's Grandmother's "famous' meatloaf recipe.

This is my go to recipe, the only thing I do different is add some minced garlic and I use stale bread instead of breadcrumbs. I soak the bread in the milk to get it soggy and then combine everything as stated. The mustard I use is usually Dijon. Soooo good!

Fast, easy, delicious. I've made this recipe at least 12 times. Great every time. Like suggested by other reviewers I added 1 TBSP Worcestershire sauce and usually soften the onions in butter. Didn't have the time for that tonight so just chucked 'em in raw.

I prepared this meal last night and it was a hit with the fam.  I tweaked it a little bit. I  made the meatloaf with ground beef and ground pork, added fresh onions, onion powder and minced onions, garlic powder, salt and pepper , a splash of milk, eggs and breadcrumbs.  I then followed the recipe instructions.  The glaze is really amazing!  The glaze is what makes this meatloaf pop!  This recipe  will now be a part of my rotation of meals!  My hubby was delighted!

This was a yummy and easy recipe for a cold evening. I made it exactly according to recipe and found it to be moist and an excellent pairing for potatoes and carrots. I cooked in a 8x9 pan with potatoes and carrots cut up along side in the baking dish. I did cover with tin foil and uncovered during last 15 minutes. Leaving it to set on the stove 10 minutes before serving made it stand up nice on the plate. With a side salad my entire family loved supper. Will definitely make again.

Super tasty and very easy! (I had no idea my favorite comfort food was so easy to make!) only changes I made were I added a few dashes of Worcestershire and one very small bell pepper to the meat mixture. It came out tasting just like Cracker Barrel meatloaf. Added bonus the picky 2 year ate it. Definitely going into the rotation.

We are not big meatloaf eaters but I like to make it occasionally. This is hands down the best I've ever made. I pretty much followed the recipe except substituting a portion of the ground beef with turkey. It was quick and easy and delicious. I was worried the milk would make the loaf to mushy but it came out nice and firm. I've passed the recipe on to friends and they love it too. This one is a keeper!

GREAT YESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!! (fry the onions in vegetable or olive oil to give WAY more flavor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
(Also 1/2 seasoned and 1/2 regular breadcrumbs, regular breadcrumgs are boring and tasteless, and seasoned breadcrumbs make it way to season and salty. So do 1/2 & 1/2.

Great easy reciepe.. Quick and simple to make. Pretty good flavor. Also, did not see that the ketchup, mustard and brown sugar went on as a glaze. I put it all in the mixture. I did use one tweak, I used oat instead of bread crumbs to make it gluten free as my daughter has Celiac disease

I made this recipe exactly as written. It went together quickly. It is a good basic recipe but unless you like your food quite bland you may want to consider add-ins like garlic, Worcestershire Sauce, peppers, spices, herbs   .   .   .   .   .   .

I have made this recipe several times, and this time I made sure to add the milk, which does help keep the loaf very moist and juicy.  I used white sugar and Worcestershire + Dijon mustard for the glaze this time, which was the best flavor to the glaze yet.  I highly recommend this loaf to anyone!

I lost my grandma's meatloaf recipe, and I was looking for something similar.  She used tomato juice instead of milk, but I thought the milk worked just fine and reduced the sodium. I would even cut back to 3/4 cup next time; this was very moist, even though I added 1/2 pound ground turkey to the ground beef. I added worcestershire sauce, as another reviewer suggested, and as Grandma did, I added 1 diced bell pepper, and here's where my only complaint comes in - next time I will remember to saute the onion and pepper, so that they are tender, because they were a little too crunchy without that extra step.
Second time I made it, I used 2 lbs. ground turkey, 3/4 cup milk, and I remembered to sauté the onion and pepper prior to mixing them into the meat. Also had mushrooms that needed to be used, so I chopped them and added them to the mixture as well.

This was super easy to make and did not take a lot of time !  Both of my kids really liked it &  wanted more of the sauce that went on top; luckily I had some left over. I didn't add onions because my kids are super picky about onions but next time I'll try it with and maybe even add a little green bell pepper for some added flavor.

Absolutely loved it! Accidentally mixed all the ingredients together instead of putting the ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar on top. Was still awesome. My 9 month old almost ate his hand off he ate it so fast!

The only changes I made was add a package of ranch seasoning. A pinch of garlic powder and to the sauce little Worcestershire sauce. Done it in tin foil and it came out crispy on top and mouth watering through the rest. Just like moms when I was a kid. Sides included corn bread, green beans, from the garden, and scratch mashed potatoes.  A must try!!!!!

Oops! Didn't read the instructions carefully, mixed all the ingredients in one bowl including the mustard, ketchup and brown sugar, baked it and came out pretty good. Instead of adding the topping sauce again used a dab of regular gravy to even out the sweetness that was in the meat loaf. It worked! Now I have to try it again the correct way...

This recipe is the BOMB. I have great meatloaf recipes from family members and my husband is a naturally amazing cook that doesn't need a recipe like me and has made many great meatloafs of all different styles... BUT THIS MEATLOAF IS THE BEST. Super freaking easy and just really delicious.  I wont make any other meatloaf every again. The only changes I made were a little bit more of everything because I made it with 2 lbs ground beef. Oh and a little worcestershire because my mother would be mortified if I made a meatloaf without it!

I love this recipe and it has become a staple dish in my house. Today I doubled the recipe and this is what I did 1. I always you see a 2 to 1 ratio of beef and pork, not pork sausage just ground pork. 2 . I grated up a zucchini and added to my mix 3. I minced a couple of hand fulls of kale, with out stems minced it up so it looks like parsley. And I  just mix everything together even the brown sugar one VERY big bowl. Next I make a meatloaf and drizzle it with ketchup...yes I know. .but I live with all men  what can I say hince the zucchini and kale wink wink. Then the other half I make up as meatballs and sprinkle with parmesean. ..the real stuff...and bang I have 2 meals!  My guy's really love the meatball subs or just add them in with the sauce. Win win!!

Tasted good and really liked the ketchup mixture but I think it needed less milk and bread crumbs. It was like mush. I'll try it again with less of both and maybe add a little Worcester sauce.

I really like this recipe because you can use it as a base and add or subtract from it. I sauteed  1/2 of and onion, a 1/4 of a red pepper and green pepper, 3 cloves of garlic and 4-5 chopped mushrooms in olive oil and added them to the already mixed mixture of milk (not quite a cup) 8 ritz crackers, and 1/2 cup or so of bread crumbs egg and beef and some worcestershire sauce. I used only 1 spoonful of brown sugar in the topping. Very moist and yummy.  Served with mashed potatoes and a green salad.

This is one of the best I have made and I have made many meat loafs over the years!! I took the advice of some others sautéed my onions in garlic and butter and adding in the worcesestershire sauce and seasoned bread crumbs the loaf stayed together yet was very moist and delicious.  I loved the unique flavor to the topping but I added in a pinch of cayenne for a little extra flavor! Delish and I served it with my funeral potatoes and my husband went wild!! He isn't one who usually likes anything but the potato's and loaf were a huge hit together and one I'm keeping Thanks!

This was very good. I followed it pretty much. Used Progresso Italian bread crumbs which gave it a nice flavor. I also added Worchester Sauce as I do for all my meat loaves. Otherwise followed it. Oops, I also added 1/2 pound of seasoned pork sausage.  Very good.

This is a really great recipe! I followed other reviewers suggestions and sauteed the onions in butter, doubled the sauce, and used Italian bread crumbs. I also went an extra step and mixed together all the ingredients before adding the beef. I did this to make sure the beef was mixed very well and seasoned evenly. I used 1lb of extra lean beef and .5lb of lean beef. Meatloaf came out perfectly moist. I checked the meatloaf at 50 minutes but ended up leaving it in the oven for the entire hour. It came out very tasty and I will definitely be making it again! Only thing I would suggest is maybe adding a bit more brown sugar to the sauce on top. That might help get rid of the strong ketchup/mustard taste and add more of a sweet taste sweet.

Sautéed onion in garlic per other reviewers, added Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste, and mustard to meat mixture, left off the sugar topping and replaced with a small "river" of ketchup and BBQ sauce combo, then laid bacon strips on top.  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  Even fussy 8 year old loved this.

This is my go to meatloaf recipe, as it's always a family pleaser and goes together so quickly. It is always moist, even when you loose track of time and leave it in the oven for longer than suggested. Sometimes I use seasoned breadcrumbs which adds nice  additional flavor.  I follow the recipe exactly and don't saute the onions. I've tried it both ways and I prefer my onions with a little texture/bite.  I just can't say enough about this recipe. It's THE BEST!!

The sauce on the top is a basic BBQ sauce.  You see it on ribs all the time.  The only thing extra I added was 1/2 cup parmesan cheese.  Great recipe.

i love the sauce on this first of all, it is amazing! that being said I did mine in a 9x13 pan in a loaf shape and had to cook for an hour and a half or so. But the flavor was very good and I would make again. I added Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, and a few other herbs I personally like.

I have been making this recipe for about 4 years and my family absolutely LOVES this meatloaf.  I have never had a complaint!  I don't always have  plain bread crumbs so I usually just chop up whatever bread I have around....I have used left over dinner rolls, wheat bread...anything!  Everytime I make this recipe, I have to stop and consider putting as much milk in as the recipe calls for.  I use the full amount and yes, it does seem soupy sometimes.  I might add a few much chunks of bread in that case,  but you don't have to.  The milk will absorb and cook out.    The sauce is perfect to bring out the beefiness of the meatloaf.   I always have an extra side of it on the table for dipping.   This is an absolute must recipe for anyone who wants a quick and delicious meatloaf!  Thanks for sharing!!

added one tablespoon Worcestershire sauce.  Lots of onion (large onion finely chopped) to keep it moist inside.

Absolutely delicious! As per other reviewers, I sauteed the onions in butter and garlic before adding it, added a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce, and added a green bell pepper. I used Panko instead because it's what I had. I also doubled the sauce. It was a hit with the family! Even better the next day!

Everyone loves this every time. And I've made it many times using this exact recipe. Usually I make a double batch of the glaze and add some extra to the top of the loaf before it's done baking. Lives up to its name with ease of preparation. Almost as easy as writing this review. Giggity.

Meatloaf has always defeated me.  Up until now I've never made a decent one.  I used this recipe with variations.
I took out the brown sugar - I hate sweet flavors with meat.  Instead I used Worcestershire sauce in the mixture, and in the topping along with mustard and ketchup.  

I also sauteed the onions before adding them to the loaf.  I like a mellow onion flavor, and one of my family members can't eat it unless I cook the daylights out of it!

All I had on hand for the crumbs was a sleeve of Bacon Ritz crackers.  It made a surprisingly tasty change!  I could smell them very clearly while it was cooking, and I think I'll use those exclusively since this was a big hit.

I thought it was great. Instead of salt and pepper (we cook no salt added my family is used to it.) I used ground mustard. I made my own bread crumbs.  I used 85/15 ground beef. Next time I will use 93/7 I like my meat loaf to be a little more dry. The sauce was very good I made that to the T. Next time I will make twice as much sauce.The whole family loved it there were no leftovers.

I've never liked meatloaf growing up and I LOVE this recipe.  Instead of making one big loaf, we will make small patties (6-8) with them so that we get more of the crunchy edge that I like.  We also add a bit of Worcestershire Sauce to the meat mixture too.

This recipe was delicious - though I added ketchup, dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture with seasoned stuffing mix in place of bread crumbs. The sweet sauce on top was the perfect compliment to the slightly spicier meatloaf. It's become a go-to household favorite.

I've made this several times now.  Its a great and easy recipe. I make a few changes, but nothing that takes away from the original recipe. First,  I use Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers. It adds a little more flavor. I also usually use 2 lbs of ground beef and so I add a little extra of the other ingredients as well. Ex: I use 2 eggs but only 1 cup of milk. Add an extra 1/4 c bread crumbs and a little extra onion.  
I make 2 loafs so I can freeze one for later.  It's a great recipe that I recommend to friends!

I made this tonight and it came out great. I'm a novice when it comes to the kitchen so a easy to follow meal like this was an all around good start. The simplicity allows you to add to it for your own taste, but if you're not brave enough for that you will still get a great meatloaf out of this recipe. I used less onion out of my own discretion, but I took the advice of one review and sauted the chopped onion before adding to the meat mix. For what it's worth to anyone like me trying to start cooking and getting comfortable in the kitchen; I'm a 26 year old male who knows nothing about cooking. If you're interested in cooking and don't know where to start, keep it simple and get rolling with easy recipes like this one. 
Best parts of this meatloaf is that it holds together, its juicy, the topping is easy and tasty, and if you want to add stuff it's doable without really hurting the recipe.

Dish was utterly scrumptious, though next time when making it, I would leave out the sugar, I'm more of a savoury eater, not that it was sweet, but I could taste the sugar, could've been I had done something wrong, not really a good cook, and I just experiment with the recipes I find on this app. Once again this dish was Devine and I would definitely be making it again.

I did what many other said by adding 1 TBS of Worcestershire, adding extra ketchup (almost double), reducing some of the brown sugar, and sauteing the onions beforehand. I also added about half a bulb of chopped garlic, half a chopped jalapeno, and I chose garlic herb breadcrumbs. I never cook and am just getting started trying to learn recipes, and this came out great! I may use more breadcrumbs and/or a leaner meat next time though, as it left a lot of grease in the pan (I used 80% lean beef). But I still got seconds last night and am eating leftovers now!

Great recipe.  I substitute Heinz Chili Sauce for the topping.  Saves time and tastes great!  I also use plain Panko for the bread crumbs.

We loved it! I am not one to post any changes, as I like to try first and then assess.  Frankly, it was really great as it.  BUT, I must admit, I did not have any onion, so mine went without!  Other than that, did it by the book!  Does anyone use lean ground beef?  I use 80/20 for I do not like it dry, but would love to know your thoughts.

I love this recipe! Every once in a while when I make the sauce for the top I will change out the 1/3 cup of Ketchup for bqq sauce or A1 sauce or even mix some A1 or bbq sauce in with the ketchup. Also I mix in some shredded cheese. This is my go to recipe!

First time I've had meatloaf since I found out I can't eat wheat.  I made it gluten- and lactose-free - I substituted 3.5 slices of gluten-free (semi-stale) bread for the crumbs, just tore them into relatively small pieces.  Instead of milk, I used gluten-free beer (made from sorghum).  I like my onions a little toothy so I used them raw. I did put 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce in the meat mix along with squirts of ketchup and mustard, since that's what my mom always did.  In the topping, I used a little less ketchup and a little more coarse brown mustard, I also completely skipped the brown sugar.  We loved it, my son ate 3 pieces and asked me to make it again.  I look forward to having this tomorrow as leftovers!

An easy recipe and quite good.  I made the recipe as is. Because of my long work days, I made the recipe the night before.  I put the meat in the loaf pan and stuck in in the fridge.  I mixed up the sauce for the topping and left it in a separate bowl in the fridge. The next day, it was easy for hubby or an older child to add the topping and stick it in the oven, so that I didn't have a lot of prep work after a long day at work.  My picky seven year old loved it.  The twelve year old ate it that night and again for lunch and still loved it the next day.

Same amount of meat, grate 1/4 cup onion, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4, pepper or more/less to taste. 1/2 cup milk and enough cracker crumbs to soak. Mix all together with 1 egg. Topping: 1/4 cup ketchup, 3 tblsp, brown sugar, 1 tblsp dry mustard, 1/8 tsp nutmeg. Mix well and spread on top. Hope you try it and enjoy!

I have been looking for a recipe similar to what my mom made and I believe this is as close as you get. The only changes I made were, I used equal handfuls Italian flavored croutons (crushed), saltine crackers (crushed) and uncooked oatmeal. Oh and some A-1 mixed with the glaze. Despite all of this it was very moist and delicious. P.s. I think next time I might use barley instead of oats just to experiment.

I made some modifications.  I read the reviews to saute the onions first, but I decided to grate the onion instead.  It definitely intensified the onion flavor without giving me large, noticeable chunks of uncooked onion in the finished meatloaf.  I also added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce, and a bit of garlic powder to the meatloaf mix.  Next time I make this, I might use the meatloaf meat blend of veal, pork and beef for more flavor.

This was super easy and tasty. I added bacon to the mixture before adding it into the oven dish for something extra special. Yum.

This recipe was very easy to follow. I did not saute my onions like the other reviewers did, and instead if beef I used turkey. I did however used seasoned bread crumbs. It was really good, I have used this recipe a couple times.

Great, moist recipe!  I chose to cook it for an hour at 350 and a half  hour at 425 to make the edges crunchy!  I also used ground chuck and drained the grease after cooking.

You dont need egg with meatloaf or meatballs.  Sprinkle water on Panko bread crumbs.  All the egg does is increase cholesterol and over-all fat.

:( it's been cooking now for 2.5 hours... 8:30 pm and my family is starving. .. still can't eat b/c it's mushy. the only explanation I have is the milk. I have never used milk in a meatloaf recipe before but thought I would try it... I think it was a mistake... mushy meatloaf. Will never put milk again.

This was a great and easy recipe. I made a few additions and I'm kind of a weird cook so I added pretty random stuff.  I made the meatloaf exactly how it said. No real changes. But after i added a bit of sauce I laid a few pieces  of bacon on top and more sauce. I added a bit more to the sauce such as hot cause and maple syrup which caramelized and added the perfect flavour. My husband loved it. Can't go wrong with bacon :) can't wait to make this again!!!

Great recipe. You'll definitely want to sautee the onions beforehand though, otherwise they come out way too strong and partially crunchy.

Love this recipe! Comes out perfect every time. My kids really look forward to it! Only thing I change is I reduce the mustard amount. I use about 1 tablespoon as opposed to too. Last time I made it, I put bacon slices on top of the ketchup/mustard topping... it was delish!

A good starting block to be creative.  I added 1 cup shredded carrots and the kids ADORED it! This lends itself beautifully to any changes.  I've also subbed ground bread sticks (leftovers) for the breadcrumbs.  I have made this numerous times with great success.  I puree the onions as I have a kid that HATES onions. No sacrifice on texture or flavor by doing this.

I used the general idea for this recipe. I mexi-ed mine up :) I added leftover tomato, diced onion, and for season I used Cumin, red pepper, garlic powder and for the milk I used left over tomato soup. Also in place of bread Crumbs I smashed plain corn chips. Served with some avocado and sour cream on the side and Spanish rice made a great meal with a green salad. The family loved it!

This is my favorite meatloaf recipe.  I replace the milk with an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and use panko bread crumbs.  It's one of the only meatloaf recipes that I like when it's left-over.

Love this recipe! I followed the other reviewers and sautéed the onions in butter, and added some garlic. Delicious!

OMG, this is the BEST meatloaf I've ever had or made.  Absolutely AWESOME.  Made this last night for dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly with only 2 small changes tripled the amount for ketchup, since I wanted more sauce on the meatloaf & sprinkled fresh chopped cilantro on top, which you can use chopped parsley, if not a big cilantro fan.  Served it with sides of mash potatoes and fried zucchini.  

Janet, THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing your recipe with us all.  This is an absolute keeper in my recipe book!

Very good! But I did vary the recipe a bit. I read some reviews and decided to use some of their advice. I didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so I used a packet of Lipton onion soup mix. I sauteed the onions and added mushrooms  and sauteed them as well. Then, hoping for less cooking time I cooked it in my muffin pan instead of a loaf pan, and did cook  In about an hour. Was very good, my husband loved it. Will continue to use.

So simple, quick, and easy.  So good!  I made it exactly as written and the entire family was delighted.  My meatloaf generally turns out dry, but this one is juicy. I wasn't sure my family would like the combination of ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar on top, but it was delicious!  This is my new go-to meatloaf recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved! A few changes...made a double batch.  And also made extra sauce.  Added a bit more brown sugar-and used light brown.  Also cooked a bit longer.  Served with home made mashed potatoes and fresh green beans.  Planned to freeze but almost gone for a family of 4??

This recipe is a great outline. For those not used to the idea of brown sugar added to the topping, it's a classic carmelization tool :) it's in many bbq recipes and works amazingly with any meat. I always add a bunch of veggies in my meatloaf, carrots, celery (not too much), green and yellow onions, I love fresh peppers so it's not abnormal for me  to add some fresh jalepenos and/or green chiles. never forget salt/pepper/garlic as they're great in everything. Meatloaf is a lot like lasagna, you can make it whichever way you want. Mexican, american, italian, whatever you feel like or have in your kitchen. Happy Cooking :)

Made this for my girlfriend she swears it tastes just like the meatloaf her mother made and loved it....I Mean Loved IT!  So it's the only meatloaf I make now. I did alter the recipe  slightly.  only had 1 lb of hamburger added  1 mild Italian sausage link, skinned sliced then quartered and added to to mixture before blending ingredients.  6 slightly toasted bread then cubed. I added two eggs because it  didn't seem to be enough to bind such a loose mixture. I baked the loaf as directed but it seemed to need more sauce so I made a double recipe of sauce. I drained the excess grease carefully out of the loaf pan then topped it again with the sauce and baked it another 30 min.  I'm making it again tonight the same way but plan to slightly sauté the onions   Thank you for a great recipe  and I consider it a 5 Star dinner!

I love this recipe. I have used it many time it's quick to fix and does take long to cook and my family loves it.. sometimes I may add a little extra to the recipe like sundried tomatoes or shredded carrots. It also taste great without any extras. Great recipe!

This was an easy recipe.  I made a few changes. I used veal,pork,beef about  2.5 lbs. so I used 2 eggs 3/4 c milk and about 1/2 c  grated cheese. I also shredded the onion and added fresh garlic and Italian spices. Glaze as is and came out great!

I eyeballed the measurements in the sauce, used spicy Dijon, added a bit of bbq hot sauce and minced garlic, and a bit of taco seasoning for some added flavor. I also added steak seasoning instead of salt and pepper (includes a few herbs) and I used Parmesan seasoned croutons for my bread crumbs. I forgot to add the milk but in the end it was moist and didn't need it. Loved this recipe, so quick and easy and delicious!!

I added Worcestershire sauce because of multiple recommendations and I could taste it. It added a very nice, rich undertone to the dish.

Awesome recipe. Thanks so much! I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and sautéed my onions first in butter. The cook time for 1.5 lbs was about one hour and fifteen minutes.

Made a sandwich to take for lunch. Combination of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar can be used as a dipping sauce for various finger foods.
 I sautéed onions and garlic to enhance the taste.
Used seasoned bread crumbs.
Added bell peppers.
So good.

I will never make meatloaf another way! It is simple, fast, and truly delicious. I started to modify it, then realized I should follow the directions first to see if I liked it before adding additional steps. Glad I did.

The brown sugar, mustard, and ketchup combo was very nice.  Used just a little less mustard for personal taste. Put most of combo topping initially, and a little more towards the end. Used ground beef and ground pork.  Very tasty.  Many complements.  Will make again for sure.

My little girls said no at first to meatloaf.  But after trying it and telling them there is ketchup in meatloaf it was game on.  They loved it and sang my praise for cooking it, mom didn't like that part so much.

It was good but very heavy on onion. Would recommend no more than a small onion. Sauce was tart which son did not like. Next time, will either use 1/2 of mustard or none. Cooking time was good and flavor aside from onions was good.

I wanted to try a different meatloaf recipe so I picked this one. My husband loved it. The next day I made him sandwiches with the leftovers and he texted me about how great it is. I will definitely be using this recipe in the future.

This recipe was nice and easy. I like the step-by-step directions. I just added a few changes I used sautéed n raw onions, McCormick Meatloaf Seasoning and garlic herb breadcrumbs. As for the sauce I used spicy golden mustard just for a lil kick. So all in all I give the recipe a thumbs up and I would recommend it to others.??????

Very easy to make. My youngest daughter thinks she hates meatloaf, so I put this in bunny-shaped cupcake tins and call them bunny burgers. She loves them and my meatloaf loving oldest daughter gets to wink at me and stuff her face. I used smashed chicken stuffing mix and a pre-packaged mix of ground beef and pork from the store to make this tonight. Definitely a winner. As long as we don't call it meatloaf, we'll be eating this again real soon!

My Lady has to have gluten, soy, and dairy free, but Janet this recipe was absolutely one of the best ever, after I made the changes.
I wanted to find out what would happen if I replaced the milk (which I always used)entirely, and replaced with beef broth to keep the moisture. 
Chopped up 1 green bell pepper, and 1 onion, placed them together in plastic bag with 2 tsp of minced garlic, and shake till well mixed.
1 cup of Gillians Bread Crumbs (Wheat, Gluten, Soy & Dairy free).
My Lady and I absolutely loved it,and the beef broth was the best I have ever had. Hope this is helpful for those on special diets.

Very good. I sauteed the onions & added a Tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce, as suggested, to meat mix. I had 1/2# grnd turkey meat so used it as part of meat measurement. Baked 1 hr. 25 mins.  I think the turkey meat makes it extra moist, so if using turkey, cut down on the milk a bit. Also, I should have added more salt to meat mix (cannot "salt to taste" when mixing raw meat). Doubled the topping. My husband loved it. Will make this on again.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. It was very good, but not extremely flavorful. I did like that it was not greasy at all. I think next time I am going to add bacon to the top fora little more flavoring.. The recipe is very easy to follow. I loved the onion in it, i just used about 3/4 of one large onion. It looked like way too much, but cooked very nicely in the meatloaf. The real test will be when my 11 year old tries it when returning home from her friends house!!

Meatloaf is not a favorite of my sons ... but after four slices I think this one is a winner. Made as directed but did add Worcestershire as others have stated, and also used minced onion instead of chopping due to time ... will add a something to the glaze to make it a bit sweeter.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe. It was so flavorful and moist. Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, and I wouldn't change a thing about it. My husband said this is his favorite meal that I've cooked so far and that  he could eat this on a weekly basis! I probably won't be cooking it that often, but I will definitely be making this many more times in the future!

This was absolutely moist and delicious!  My husband had thirds.  Couldn't get enough and kept on saying "wow" with each bite.  I followed what the other reviewers did by sautaeeing the onions first and added worcestershire sauce to the mixture.  It's one of my favorite seasonings so I judt had to add it.  I also didn't have regular breadcrumbs only panko so I pulsed it first in the food processor until fine.  Worked really well.   I also doubled the glaze on top.  Doubled the ketchup, the mustard but the brown sugar still 2 tablespoons as I didn't want it overly sweet and true enough, when I tasted it it was just the right sweetness for me.  The entire mixture fit perfectly inside a 9 x 5 pyrex loaf dish.  To be sure about cooking temperatures I stuck a meat thermometer right through the middle but not all the way that it woukd be touching the bottom of the dish.  I wanted to make sure that  it reaches the proper cooking temp of about 160 F.  1 hour at 350 F did just that so the baking time stated was pretty accurate.  Next time I make this I will be using a leaner ground beef as grease just pooled at the bottom of the dish.

I was in a rush and made this recipe ver batim, without reading the reviews first. A whole onion is too much. Definitely sautee first or use onion soup mix. We found the recipe flavorless, even with salt/pepper. The meat was too soft a consistency and the sauce was neither flavorful nor the right amount. Thank goodness we had yummy mashed potatoes and veggies to mix the meatloaf in, otherwise it would not have been eaten at all.

I mixed it up a bit and my roommates love it. When I sauté/soften the onions with butter I sprinkle about a tablespoon of brown sugar on it. Don't fully caramelize it but just run the stove on about 3. Next I substitute regular mustard with dijon and instead of ketchup I use Stubbs sweet heat. I also use the Progresso garlic and herb bread crumbs. And the real trick is after pressing the first half of the hamburger mixture in the pan I spread a layer of shredded mozzarella then top it with the rest of the burger. It's awesome! I've also used blue cheese crumbles and loved it but some people aren't fans of the strong flavor. Lastly, after spreading the sauce over the top I sprinkle siracha over the top for a little extra kick along with onion powder.

Super simple recipe! I did modify it a little, but used the above for a reference. 2 lbs ground beef (super lean), used seasoned bread crumbs , THEN added Worcester sauce, Dijon mustard, and a red pepper.  I also used my Cuisinart to chop the onion & pepper together, and chopped it to a very fine mixture. That way the onion & pepper were evenly mixed into the meat. Next time, I will add more red pepper & add green pepper. Bon appetit y'all!

I made this last week and it was amazing !  Making it again this week. I followed the advice of Redhotnubian and made it as described.....OMGosh, we loved it.  I usually have to smother every bite of my meatloaf in ketchup but not this time, it was so moist and with the topping it didn't need a thing.  Will definitely keep this recipe !

I love this recipe.  Only made a few minor changes, sautéed the onions in a little evoo with two garlic cloves minced, added 1 tbls. Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and doubled the topping sauce.  Baked 1 hr at 350, drained the grease with my baster and added six partially cooked bacon strips and returned to oven for 30 additional minutes.  Delicious...served with red smashed potatoes and green beans tonight.  Cannot wait to have leftovers tomorrow.

This recipe is awesome! I make my meatloaf into bacon wrapped meatloaf cupcakes, so I add the brown sugar/ketchup mixture into the meat and also add a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. The I line the muffin tins with bacon, fill each one with a good amount of the meatloaf mixture and bake at 350 for 45-1 hour depending on how you like your bacon...also I place a cookie sheet under the muffin tin to avoid any spill over of grease from the bacon and meat...then I top then of with mashed potato "frosting". My family LOVES these!!!

Not bad!  Very simple, with some good base meatloaf flavors.  Too much onion, though.  I scaled the meat/breadcrumbs/milk mix up 50% and used half an onion, and that was still a little much.  That's just our preference, though.  All in all, good recipe.

First time making meat loaf. Used a little less than 2 lbs. of 85% lean ground beef. Used same proportions of other ingredients. Took tips and sautéed onion before mixing it in. Also added some worcestershire sauce. Used small loaf pan to form 3 loaves and placed them on broiler pan to cook so loaves weren't swimming in grease. Doubled sauce mixture. Cooked for about 1 hr and 20 minutes. Last 20 I increased the oven temp to get some browning. Meatloaf was still moist. 

This was a good base recipe. You can tweak it to suit your taste. I'll definitely play around with this one in the future, especially the topping which I found just a tad sweet.

Great standard meatloaf recipe. I used a couple different techniques to make it even better. First, I soaked the breadcrumbs in the milk before adding it to the beef. Second, use a room temperature egg. Third, instead of sautéing the onion as some other posters suggested, I grated it on a box grader. I have made meatloaf with sautéed onions and grated onions, my family prefers the grated version because a few don't like the texture of onions. I also added a teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of seasoned salt, and a heavy teaspoon of pepper. I'll add Worcestershire and some franks next time as well.

I really like this. Perfect for a first time meatloaf maker. I sauteed the onions in garlic and butter and used crackers instead of bread crumbs. Doubled the sauce but left some of the brown sugar out. Oh and I added a little steak sauce to the meat.turned out nice.

I tried this recipe today and I did it exactly as it says. It turned out VERY GOOD ! The only problem I had was with the breadcrumbs. 1 cup is entirely to much and takes away from the taste of the meat. I would recommend using half a cup. I also doubled my topping because it wasn't enough. Great recipe just needs small alterations.

Loved it but added a bit more ketchup. My Husband thought it had a little too much brown sugar but my daughter and I thought it was just right.   We added the topping towards the last 10 minutes  and made some for the side. Will be  making this  again. I have also tried it with a combination of turkey and hamburger and it's great.

I never thought I'd find a meatloaf recipe to rival my mom's, but this sure gives her a run for her money! I didn't have an onion so I used a packet of onion soup mix. Everyone especially liked the glaze on top. I served it with the ultra creamy mashed potatoes and bourbon-glazed carrots, both also from this site. We will make this again and again!

Have been looking for a good meatloaf recipe for a long time. No one would eat my husband's, lol. We tried this and the entire family loved it. It's now a regular on dinner list. Have made it several times. I did saute onions first. It is quick and easy, and very inexpensive to make.

This was yum, very moist. I only just made it. I ran out of sugar so replaced it with honey and I also used seeded mustard.  The meat probably needs a little more flavour so I will do as others have mentioned and sauté the onions in butter.  (And  more herbs) Otherwise great and so easy. Will be making again for sure. :-)

This was quite good and simple to make.  I used seasoned breadcrumbs,  sauteed the onions with some garlic,  added a little onion salt and garlic powder, and tossed in a handful of leftover shredded cheese.  Yhe glaze is the same as I normally make.  Delicious! It was gone before I remembered to take a picture!  Thanks!

Recently made this as I had a tonsillectomy and one of my few approved foods was meatloaf, and I was going a little crazy doing nothing but Convalescing. My dad LOVED it--he actually ate most of it--I found it a little too dry and a little painful to swallow, but I'm not sure if that's just because my throat still wasn't fully-healed or because I used very low-fat beef. 

It was my first time working with raw meat, and I probably could have combined the ingredients in an easier way than a potato-masher, and I didn't have a loaf pan of the right size so I had to use a casserole dish. I also forgot we didn't have any onion, so I went without. Next time, I think I'll double the sauce and try to find a loaf pan to make it a little less lumpy.

Absolutely wonderful!  No need to sauté the onions.  I did add Worcestershire as others had suggested.  Used 2 lbs of ground beef and an extra egg.  Cooked for 1 hour 25 minutes and it was great.

This meatloaf was amazing! It's hard to imagine that something can taste so good with only a few simple ingredients. I doubled the sauce (doubling was a tad too much but a single portion wouldn't have been enough sauce). I also cooked it for 1 hour and 25 minutes since after an hour it didn't seem ready yet. Will definitely make this again !!!

Very good. The family also loves it. I added a few things. Red, green onions. Mrs. Dash. Also I just put a cup of tomato sauce in the meat instead of the brown sugar on top. Then right before the loaf is cooked I put ketchup on top then let it cook another 5 or so minutes.

This wasn't anything special. I added a bag of frozen broccoli, and even that wasn't a redeeming quality. It was just so bland. Won't be making it again.

Excellent recipe. Made it with some changes, as suggested by other users and then made it again but this time, instead of the ketchup/mustard/brown sugar sauce I covered it with "Sweet Red Chili Thai Sauce"...OMG! Try it.

Absolutely love this recipe! I've already made it about five times now. Meatloaf is one of my boyfriends favorite dishes, and he cant get enough of it.The only changes that I made were to add a little bit of Worcester sauce, and a slice or two of bread, cubed. Also a little bit of cayenne pepper to the ketchup sauce

I have never made meatloaf before. I don't even like meatloaf. My husband does; so I found this recipe. Thank You for this recipe. It was quick and easy. I didn't have brown sugar so I subed it with a half pack of hot chocolate mix. So amazing! Just enough chocolate sweetness but doesn't over power. I am not gonna stray from this recipe esp with the hot chocolate mix sub. I like meatloaf now. :)

It is good as it is but fantastic with a few modifications.  I use Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Also, I saute the onion in olive oil with garlic and add 1/2 of a chopped green pepper.  I also add about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and a dash to the glaze.  I also make more glaze than called for, it needs more.  I have probably made this 8-9 times and always a hit if made this way.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever made, and my husband agrees.  Easy to make ... I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use all the ketchup mix.  This is a keeper in our household!

This is a delicious recipe and now the only meatloaf I will make. I did use the one and a half pounds of ground beef (90/10) and I also used one pound of ground pork. And because it wasn't a fully doubled recipe (one pound of pork instead of a pound and a half, I used one and a half cups of milk instead of two cups. I made this meatloaf gluten free by using gluten free Italian bread crumbs but I mixed them into the recipe ingredients before adding the ground beef and pork so they wouldn't be crunchy in the meatloaf (gluten free bread crumbs are crunchier than regular bread crumbs). I also (as suggested by other reviewers) sautéed the onions first which made them soft and flavorful. So I did alter the recipe a little, but it was still fantastic and the family absolutely loved it.  The sauce was delicious and even though I doubled it for the recipe, I am going to triple the sauce next time.  I cooked this for one hour and fifteen minutes but next time I will put it under the broiler for a minute after it is done and give the top a little crust, especially with the extra sauce.  MmMm Good!

This is a great recipe.  The only change I made was to replace the breadcrumbs with oatmeal (got that from my mom) to make it a little healthier. The oatmeal made it hold together better, and I added a little worchestershire sauce. I didn't even make the sauce for the top....Everyone wanted seconds and thirds :)

This was pretty tasty!  I didn't have an onion so I substituted 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder, & I also didn't have any bread crumbs so I ground up 1 cup of rolled oats.  To push it one step further, I grabbed a handful of baby spinach and chopped it up like you would parsley and added that as well.  It doesn't really add flavor to the food, but it sure does pack in a little more nutrition.  I also took some of the reviewers suggestions and added in some Worcestershire sauce.  The end result?  A meatloaf my kids LOVED and I love the fact that there's oats and spinach in it.  This was a great base recipe that was easy to make subs/additions to.  Next time, I will take some of the other reviewers suggestions and saute a chopped onion (and some garlic) in butter and then add that to the meatloaf.  The onion powder was good, but nothing like the taste of a real onion.  The one thing I noticed when I first mixed everything together was that 1 cup of milk seemed a bit much - it was a very sloppy mixture that I couldn't mold into a loaf in the beginning.  Maybe it was the oats I used instead, but once it sat in the fridge for about a half an hour, it firmed up better.  Next time I will probably only add 3/4 cup milk, especially if I need to bake it right away.  Also, this needs to cook longer than an hour.  Based on other meatloaf recipes I've made, 1 1/2 lbs ground beef needs 75-90 minutes to bake in order to cook all the way through.  I am making this into meatballs next time!

I decided to add 2 slices of diced raw bacon, 1/4 cup diced apple and a small handful of crushed kettle cooked potato chips! Yum! 2014

Made this again.... added an extra egg and only 3/4c milk. I added the brown sugar and ketchup to the meat. I also used a mix of ground beef and pork. 2015

It was decent but I felt it was missing something. I will use onion flakes in place of fresh next time (for better texture) and at least a tablespoon of Worchestershire sauce. We did enjoy the sauce. Husband suggested doubling the sauce and spreading a layer in the middle before baking.

CROCK POT-ABLE! Excellent! Followed all prep instructions but then dumped mixture into my large crock pot and flattened it down (loaf shape didn't matter to me). Cooked on low for 6 hours and came out unbelievably tender and juicy... Slices were still tall/thick enough to offer a nice presentation. So incredibly easy and my husband and kids loved it and asked me to make it a regular menu item!

Didn't get a pic of this when I made it, but everyone that tried it, enjoyed it. The only thing is that I had to cook mine an extra 30 min. The first time I brought it out the center was still quite pink.....but back in the oven for a bit and it was great. :)

I did this but with 2 lbs. Of Beef. Divides into two dishes. I used tomato paste and mustard and mixed it in. I also used 2 eggs and sautéd onion and mushrooms. I ran out of paste by the second loaf and used ketchup. I left out the milk and sugar. I lined my glass baking dishes with foil and drained after they were done. I cooked them for an hour side by side. I used two toasted heals of bread to make my own bread crumbs, always. Very good

My entire family loved this recipe - my wife is on Paleo and I sautéed the onions and garlic before adding them, used whole cream instead of milk, decreased breadcrumbs and added a little Worcestershire sauce.  Cooked at a lower temp 325 for an hour and a half before adding the topping ( made with splenda instead of brown sugar)...  added cheddar cheese to the topping and the meatloaf was a rave - family asked me to make it two days in a row!

This is a great recipe, I sautéed one green and red pepper, one onion, and about 6 cloves of garlic before I mixed them with the beer, pork and veal mixture and it came out great!!  I also didn't glaze it with ketchup instead I mixed about 1/3 cup of ketchup with it and after 30 minutes I poured a can of brown gravy on it and it changed the flavor completely from the first time I made.  I liked it a lot better and if you pour half of the juices from the pan into a small pot with another can of brown gravy, you've got a great gravy to put on the meatloaf and mashed potatoes to go with it.  Next time I'm planning on laying the meat the a layer of shredded mozzarella and then meat again and a layer of shredded cheddar and then meat again to see how it comes out.

OMG!!!  This is a keeper!  We loved it.  I have been making meatloaf for over 42 years and this is the best recipe ever.  The only thing I changed (as suggested by others) is I made much more sauce.  I only used two tablespoons of the mustard though.  You will not be disappointed with this recipe.

I've been looking for a good meatloaf recipe for years.  This is it. I did sauté the onions in butter for a few minutes, then added a couple of cloves of garlic, and cooked a couple of minutes longer.  I prefer sautéed onion flavor to raw onion flavor.  I also added little worcestershire sauce to the meat because it adds a great savory touch with little work.  I doubled the catsup so I had an enough to generously cover the load, which I baked in a loaf pan.  This turned out great. Held together when served (frequently a problem from past recipes), and was so easy.  I've made meatloaf with 2 times more ingredients and several more steps that was not nearly as good.

Although I did change just a bit because it was what I had in the house. This recipe was a hit! Instead of sauteing onion and garlic, I used powdered onion and garlic. Next time I want to be able to use the real stuff! I also used 2 tsp. of cinnamon and added 2 Tbsp of A-1 sauce in the meat mixture. I then laid bacon across the top of each loaf. (Something my mother always did) I then used 1/3 cup bbq sauce and 3/4 cup ketchup, 1 tsp mustard, 1/4 cup brown sugar. My picky little critic said he wanted more just like this! lol

I made this for my family and they loved it! I did make a few changes, instead of breadcrumbs I used 1 cup cooked quinoa (my father in law is allergic to gluten), about 2 tbsp of A1 sauce (I didn't have Worcester like the other reviews used), I sauteed the onion in butter, I only used 1 lbs organic beef and 1/2 cup milk. I forgot to grease the pan our use foil but I used a nonstick loaf pan so I didn't have any problems with sticking or cleanup afterwards. It wasn't super greasy thanks to the organic beef and the quinoa helped I think. I did double the sauce and I'm glad I did, but it was kinda sweet, my family liked it but next time I think I'll only use 3 tbsp off brown sugar instead of 4. All in all a great recipe will definitely make it again.

I tried to get ground veal at the grocery store, but they did  not carry it.  As I was driving by one of our favorite BBQ joints, it struck me to combine 1/2 pound chopped brisket in with 1 pound of hamburger....added some bbq sauce instead of worcester sauce, italian seasoned breadcrumbs...voila!  The most amazing meatloaf I have ever had!  Can't wait to try it cold tomorrow morning.

great recipe!..you need to add milk for that restaurant taste..I fried the onions in butter before I added it to the meat loaf I also mixed my meat...ground beef,sausage...Iv used ground moose meat with ground beef meat before also...you can even make this with ground turkey or ground chicken...I put the glaze on last 30 min of baking update....you have to whisk your egg and milk (just until blended) then soak your bread crumbs for about 10 min...this wont be a mushy meatloaf!!

Really like it. As with others, I sauteed the onions first and added 1 tbs. of worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. I doubled the sauce topping. Very good, a keeper.

The recipe was good as is, a tad bit mushy because of the milk. The second time I made this I used no milk, added chopped bell peppers to the mixture, and added the glaze AFTER I browned my meatloaf for about 40 min. I then finished cooking my meat. Delicious!

I LOVE this recipe! It's a family favorite and my go to recipe.  How much easier can you get for a fabulous meatloaf?  I've used various salt seasonings, different flavored bread crumbs and types of mustard which vary in taste, but it all still turns out great!  Pair the meal with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies and you are complete.  A definite comfort meal and crowd pleaser!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Kind of boring, lacked flavor other than the sauce on top.  My family wasn't impressed.  We won't make it again.

I was worried because the mixture seemed more moist than I'm use to but I followed the recipe and it turned out great! I sautéed onions, added 2 tbs of Worcestershire sauce, and doubled the topping as suggested. I also used crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs. I made 9 mini meat loafs out of 2 1/2 lb. and baked for 1 hr. Husband loved it!

This recipe is now a family favorite!  The sauce is what separates it from all other variations of meatloaf!  One day, my sister asked if we should put bacon on top of or in the meatloaf mix, and I responded that we should do BOTH! So, if you chop up three strips (or so) of bacon and put it into the meatloaf mix, and you line strips on top of the sauce on top of the meatloaf, then it adds a nice flavor!  When we don't have onion or breadcrumbs, or if we just don't feel like fussing too much, we pick up a pack of these pre-made seasonings called "fresh takes." They have cheese and breadcrumbs and herbs, and I found that the cheesy taste also makes the meatloaf more flavorful! My suggestions are obviously higher in calories though!

My family loves meatloaf so much that is has become it's own day. The last Sunday of the month we have meatloaf. :)  I found this recipe months ago, and have used it plenty of times.  I took into account what other reviewers said, the Italian bread crumbs do wonders, I add honey to the sauce that goes on top, use dried onions, and minced garlic.  This was a great starting point, that my family has come to love! 
** It's currently in the oven **

I made a lot of mods but used this as a guide as far as ratio of meat to breadcrumbs to egg and milk and cooking time.  It came out beautifully!  Things I did differently were:  I doubled the recipe, besides the onion.  I think there was still plenty of onion.  For meat I used grass fee ground beef and chorizo (2:1 beef: chorizo), used some garlic cheddar bread for the breadcrumbs, sautéed the onion in some butter and garlic.  I didn't think the brown sugar would go with the chorizo so I sautéed some garlic and mixed it with the ketchup.  So my glaze didn't get caramelized like it would have with sugar but it was still really great.  Definitely a solid framework for meatloaf that's easy to modify to suit your taste.

Great Recipe.  I like to add bell peppers and prefer to use saltine crackers as oppossed to bread crumbs.

Love this recipe!! Super easy and you can use it as a jumping off spot to make it your own.  Use Worcestershire Sauce, add mushrooms, cook the onions, or don't.  Use your imagination!  Super yummy and makes great sandwiches. I added Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning  and garlic power (hubby hates garlic, so the powder is as good as it gets for us). It always comes out great!  Next time I might add some shredded sharp cheddar cheese and see how that works.

Made last night. Super easy - and if I can make dinner with a one year old at my feet, life is amazing! Did change a few things..... I sautéed onions in olive oil before adding and I added a few dashes of Italian seasoning to beef along with dash of worcjestire sauce.... And since my baby had crushed all her saltine crackers earlier, I used those in place of bread crumbs. So I altered yes, but without the basic recipie it wouldn't have been so great. Thank you. Will put in rotation

I normally hate meatloaf but this recipe is DELISH! My whole family loved it! The only thing I would suggest, like others, is to sauté your onion first with a little garlic!

A very good basic meat loaf recipe. It's a shame that many kids under 30 have to look up a recipe for meat loaf these days, but I am certainly happy to see a good recipe out there for them when needed.

This is one of the best meat loafs ever.  I added Worcestershire sauce (approx 2 tablespoons), sprinkled garlic powder over top before adding topping.  Cooked one hour covered in foil then removed foil and cooked 10 minutes.  Let it rest for 10 minutes and served with creamed potatoes and English peas.  It was wonderful!   I did double the topping because I had almost 2 lbs of meat.  The topping is so good you will want extra.

I was praised and admired by my husband after making this.. he couldn't stop talking about it. My only substitution: instead of using an actual onion, I put in a packet of soup recipe mix. If you ask me, that is MUCH quicker and it made this meatloaf taste amazing! I think it added more flavor. Also, since some ground beef is prepackaged in a 1lb package, I just do 3/4 milk and 3/4 bread crumbs.. everything else I kept the same.

Just made this recipe last night for my family. It was tasty and well-received, however I did make adjustments.
1. Sauteed onions & 1 bell pepper (finely diced) in butter before adding to meat mixture
2.Used 2 lbs. of ground beef
3.Used cracker crumbs with Italian Seasoning added
4. Reduced milk to 2/3 c
5. Added extra seasonings (McCormick Montreal Syeak seasoning, a dash of Worchestershire sauce and a dash of A1
6. Reduced brown sugar & mustard to 1 TBSP but increased ketchup to 2/3 c.
This baked uncovered in my 350 degree convection oven for about an hour and twenty minutes and was perfectly cooked throughout.
In general this is a fine starter recipe for meatloaf and adapts well to various flavors to meet your families specific tastes. Only 4 stars, however because I feel the ratios of ingredients in the original recipe are a bit off and I did make changes.

I am not a huge fan of ground beef, but I wanted something similar to my grandmother's meatloaf.  This recipe was it!  My boyfriend and I LOVED the meatloaf, and it has been repeated several times since I discovered this recipe a couple of months ago!  It's very easy to put together, and the results always come out the same: perfect!  I do add a couple tsps of Worcestershire sauce when I make this because we like the taste of it, and I always double the sauce recipe for spreading on at the end.  I also take leftovers, and everyone at work has told me that the smell of this after reheated in the microwave is delicious!  They have all asked me for the recipe!  This one has already been a go-to recipe for me, and it will continue to be one!

It's really good.  Mashed potatoes, Salad and I mean a really good one, Corn off the cob, Garlic bread and bam, that's a great dinner!  Make sure you cook enough to make sandwiches the next day.

The only thing I changed was that I used half an onion, which I thought was a perfect amount. It was SO GOOD! Best meatloaf I've ever had! The texture was perfect, the flavors were great. I will keep this recipe for sure. Extremely easy to make!

I've been using this recipe for years and it is the best.  I have made this using deerburger as well.  The sweet/sour topping makes the meatloaf.

Made this twice. Made a few changes the second time. I used the meat loaf kit (beef, pork, veal) from the meat section rather than straight ground beef. Added green pepper and carrot with onion. Decreased onion just a little. Used real oatmeal instead of bread crumbs (great flavor), and decreased the amount of mustard by half. Was amazing the second time!

As the recipe says, "Easy Meatloaf Recipe," was very easy to make.  Moist, flavorful & hearty comfort food.  I followed the suggestions of others and lightly sauteed the onions in butter and added two teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to the meatloaf.  My daughter, who doesn't like mustard, enjoyed the "ketchup frosting" as she described the topping.  I will definitely make this meal again.

I actually goofed up and added all the ingredients including the brown sugar, ketchup and mustard to the mix but figured I would cook it anyways. I also added a shallot to the mixture and topped the meatloaf with a can of tomato paste with garlic and onion. It was so tasty. Everyone loved it!  We also used the leftovers for meatloaf sandwiches the next day with a slice of meatloaf and mashed potatoes on a roll.

Did I do something wrong? I followed the directions, but I'm not sure if the milk was only to be used with the bread. I used the breadcrumbs and my meatloaf was on the soft soggy side. If I made this again, I would reduce the amount of milk. The topping was too tangy and sweet. I might reduce or take out the mustard and sugar. Overall not terrible, but I wouldn't follow this exact recipe again. It needs tweaking.

Good meatloaf. I did find the sauce was a litte sweet, so I used more ketchup and added wocestershire sauce.  I cooked mine a longer than that one hour.  About 1.5 hours.

Yum! I made this recipe for my husband and I. The changes I made was to not use milk, substitute the breadcrumbs for 1 sleeve of Ritz crackers since that's what I had available, used ground veal and added 1 teaspoon of seasoned salt (1 teaspoon since crackers have salt) and roasted garlic to my meat to intensify the flavor. For the sauce on top I only used 1 tablespoon of brown lightly packed sugar. Also chopped up two small plum tomatoes and tossed it into the meat. Served with balsamic glazed carrots and toasted whole grain artisan bread this makes a great meal to serve to guests!

Delicious. My family loved the dish. "This is the best meatloaf I have ever had," was actually said. I followed the advice of other reviewers: 1. sautéed in butter 1/2 large white onion 2. added 3 green onions, chopped 3. added 1 tbsp Worcestershire 4. added a dash of garlic powder 5. tripled the sauce but with a little less brown sugar (6 tbsp mustard, 1 cup ketchup, 5 tbsp brown sugar) 6. baked ~2 hours. Next time I will make even more sauce to serve warm on the side.

I made this meatloaf last night and it came out fantastic! I did saute the onions first and added some green pepper and garlic. I have only made meatloaf a few other times and it didnt come out like this. This recipe is very easy to follow. After reviewing other postings I did make some extra sauce and turned the oven on broil a few times to make the glaze very thick. Thank you for this recipe!

We all loved it.  I couldn't find prepared mustard so we omitted that and added French Fry Onions to the last 5 minutes of cooking time.  My kids have already asked to have it again.

Mmm...meatloaf!  So yummy and comforting.  I added ketchup and mustard to both the meat mixture and the top of the loaf because that's the way my mom makes it.  If you have a family, I'd consider doubling the recipe so you have some leftovers.  It's hard to be a grilled meatloaf sandwich ;)

I made this for dinner i tried a little of the meatloaf it is good but even with light brown sugar it was too sweet for me anyway maybe 1 tablespoons brown sugar next time and i always use two cups of bread it just makes more and does not effect taste.

Tasty meatloaf recipe!  Just a few changes I took Alton Brown's (Good Eats) idea and used smashed up garlic butter flavored croutons as the bread, and added a little Italian seasoning.  This is my go to recipe as I've made it three time already.  Thanks for the submission.

Used ground turkey instead of beef and added in about one cup each of shredded carrot and broccoli. Threw in some Montreal seasoning blend and Worcestershire sauce. Extremely moist and delicious!

I followed this whole recipe however I used ground turkey instead if beef and I did not make the sauce. Instead I wrapped it in low sodium bacon and I have to say it was amazing. The only other thing I did differently was I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic and I found my mixture was a little too loose so I ended up adding more breadcrumbs... I highly rexxomend the bacon though!!!

Delicious recipe!I substituted onion for Lipton onion soup mix. Also for the sauce that goes on top, I wasn't sure what prepared mustard was so I used regular mustard. A long with the brown sugar, it gave it a real kick. 5 stars.

1.  Used the following mix for the sauce and it was delicious:
2 tbsp brown sugar
1 tbsp Gulden's brown mustard
2/3 cup ketchup
1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce

2.  Diced, and browned the onions prior to mixing
3.  Used seasoned Panko bread crumbs
4.  Baked for 1:25 instead of an hour. Let set before slicing.

My very first time making meatloaf. I was nervous because all the reviews said they added other ingredients or changed something about it. I followed all the ingredients although I did forget to add the salt and pepper. I just added a little more glaze! My daughter and my boyfriend loved it! I will definitely be making this again! It was delicious

Simple & delicious. I omitted the mustard & brown sugar ( not a fan of either). Used Italian seasoned bread crumbs & sautéed the onions w/ a little garlic. It was perfect!

Delicious and easy! I have to sneak in veggies to feed my elderly parent, so I blended carrots and sautéed them with onions. Instead of bread crumbs, I used oatmeal for a healthy alternative. Not healthy, but tasty Worcestershire sauce was added (no measuring just eyeballed it), as well as some garlic.  This moist and versatile recipe was a winner in our home (teens - grandma)!

Yesterday I decided to make meatloaf, it has been years.  So I thought I would refresh my memory by looking up a recipe.  Bumped into this recipe, quickly wrote it down and I went on my merry way. Later I prepared the meat an placed it in the frig.  Later as I was preparing to place it in oven couldnt remember if it was best to cover or not.  so I looked at this recipe on line once again and I PANICKED!! In my haste earlier I did not take note of step 3 in the directions. lol Yep the ketchup mustard and brown sugar is in the meatloaf.  But oh my goodness it was Delicious. I mean really good, my husband said a little tangy but his son said no its really good. I loved it the best meatloaf I ever made.  Next time maybe not 2 tbls of mustard just one?

My fiance said this is possibly the best meatloaf he's had. My mods (lifted from many previous reviews): sauteed the onion with a little bit of butter first, threw a few squirts of Worcestershire in the meat mixture, and used Italian-seasoned bread crumbs. I thought the amount of sauce was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

Oh my gosh...First off, let me say that I love meatloaf. But seriously, this is GREAT!! Easy to make and delicious taste. I made a couple of  adjustments to this recipe though. First, I omitted the onions and replaced with minced garlic. Second, a few people complained that the whole meatloaf tasted like the topping, so I let my loaf cook about 40 minutes and then added the sauce to the top of it. I cut the amount of mustard in the sauce in half. I also cooked it about 15 minutes longer...rather, turned the oven off at 55 minutes into cooking and let it finish out another 20 minutes with the oven off. Turned out perfect! Not greasy at all, lots of flavor thanks to the garlic, and moist as can be. Even my boyfriend commented on how moist it was. :) Happy eating!!!!

This is the best meatloaf that I have ever had. I brought in SKYGIRL & MAMASPICE'S recommendations including: doubling the glaze; adding Worcestershire sauce to the meat; sauté'-ing the onions; and baking for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Wow!

I followed the advise of precious reviewers plus added other changes including: sautéed onions with minced garlic, added a dash of garlic power to the meat mixture. Used 1lb ground beef, 1/2 lb sausage. Attempted to double ketchup mixture with 1/2 the mustard but ran out of ketchup so I used approx 2 tablespoons of Original BBQ sauce. It was very flavorful with a tangy sauce. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.

My husband LOVED this, the kids wished I'd left out the onions :)  I cooked it a few minutes more and the top sauce was very nice! Better than a plain ketchup.

My husband and 3 sons just LOVED it!! I did make 2 small changes.  I used 1/2 medium onion very finely chopped with 1 package of onion soup mix for some added flavor.  And I added a 1/4 green pepper also finely chopped.  Sauce is so yummy, I didn't change a thing! I usually make a larger meatloaf, and as others have stated....needs to cook just longer... I add 15 to 30 minutes depending on the size of the meatloaf.  This is a keeper in my book!!

I have finally, after twelve years of marriage, made a husband-approved meatloaf!  I cannot describe my previous attempts at meatloaf in ladylike terms, but suffice it to say I had given up on the idea.  I made this recipe while I was home alone this weekend, just because I didn't want anyone to know if I failed again.  This was such a win that he photographed it for his social network sites!  36 hours later, and he has eaten the entire thing and requested another.  He is also sending out links to this recipe among his friends.  This is a winner.  I made it exactly as directed, except I used ground pork.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe! *Update: I make this meatloaf all the time now.  A couple tips I have picked up: one, line the pan with parchment paper: easy serving, easy clean up. Two (I think this one's from Alton Brown), put a couple of slices of bread on the bottom of the pan.  I use the heels that generally don't get eaten.   They help absorb grease, then can be easily discarded after cooking.

This is a 5 with alterations of Worcestershire, sauteed onions, green bell pepper and garlic, and double the ketchup. (I don't like mustard so I didn't double that part and I had plenty of sauce)

As a 40 year old male, I only make a couple of dishes so I tried to expand my repertoire with this dish. My wife loved it and couldn't believe I made this. It was so simple to make and I didn't change anything on the recipe. I wish I would of cut the onions into even smaller pieces. I made it with a side of Red lobster biscuits and she was impressed that it tasted so good. Thank you so much for this recipe...adding to my "hey I know how to cook this" list.

This is seriously the easiest meatloaf recipe and as a mother of two kids under two, you need easy meals to make for dinner. My husband loved this! I added garlic powder and Italian bread crumbs and always eyeball my measurements. I also tripled the sauce to have extra for leftovers. Thanks for the recipe!

This is everything meatloaf should be- simple and delicious. Don't let the straightforward list of ingredients fool you into thinking this one doesn't have plenty of flavor, even when lean (95/5%) ground beef is used. I did add a splash of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture because it seemed like the thing to do. This is great comfort food!

I followed the directions and what I got was a super sweet, way too oniony, greasy loaf of mush. My husband never complains about food, even when he doesn't like something he still eats it, but even he couldn't eat this. Meatloaf should taste like meat and be solid, almost like a hamburger in loaf form. This is the worst recipe I've gotten from this site!

Made this for my boyfriend who had never tried meatloaf and was certain he wouldn't be able to ever like a "loaf" of meat. He loved it went back for 3 plates. I took notes from other reviewers; added Worcestershire to the meat mixture 1 Tbsp, a couple drops to the sauce and cut the brown sugar in half, i also sauteed the onions before adding them. Oh yeah we are huge bacon lovers so i topped the loaf with a few pieces of bacon before topping with the sauce.

Using this as a base actually proved to be one of the best meatloaf recipes I've done to date.

Like so many others, I sautéed my onions prior to adding them.  I partially 'baked' a couple slices of bacon to top it off and then added the sauce (fwiw, I used dijon mustard).  I was initially worried it hadn't cooked enough, but it was spot on.

Loved this!  I followed the other suggestions for the slightly cooked onions in butter and garlic, then, since I was out of ketchup, used barbecue sauce for the topping!!  It was soooo good!!  I have used the same meatloaf recipe forever, and this was even better!

Scanning the ingredients,  it was obvious that I'd have to add more seasoning to appease our family's tastebuds. Easy enough, so I got down to business. Liberties I took with this recipe resulted in a perfectly done main dish: 2lbs. lean (93/7) ground beef seasoned to taste with worchestershire, sea salt, pepper, garlic & onion powders, dried chives and parsley. I sautéed a small onion with minced garlic in 1 T butter until just translucent, and added it to the ground beef. I used the called-for 1 egg, but scaled back on the milk (used 2/3 c) and breadcrumbs (3/4 c total of a mix of 1/2 c roasted garlic seasoned crumbs and 1/4 c panko). I always use the same topping for meatloaf, which I just eyeball (a combo of ketchup, prepared mustard, bbq sauce, brown sugar, garlic/onion powders, black pepper, ground mustard, and parsley.) I make extra and keep it warm in a small saucepan until serving. I baked it 50 minutes at 350 in a 9x5 glass pan and let it rest for another 10 minutes after removing it. Perfect! Served with mashed potatoes and corn, this will remain in my recipe box.

Truly the best meatloaf I've ever had!  I too modified based on other helpful reviews: 1. I had 2 lbs of organic beef, so added a bit extra of everything else.  2. I browned the onions in oil and added a garlic glove.  3. I used plain breadcrumbs and added my own seasoning: oregano, basil and paprika, as well as Worcestershire sauce (along with salt and pepper).  4. I tripled the sauce, and used a tad less mustard and brown sugar (I'm convinced the Bone Suckin Sauce hot and sweet mustard is key).  5. I cooked it for an hour and 35 minutes and let it rest for a bit before serving.  Incredible!!

Yum!!! -  Made this for dinner tonight. It was a big hit. So good. The only thing I did different was to use half lean ground beef and half ground pork. I also sautéd the onions with a few sliced mushrooms before adding to the mixture. Oh yeah, I made a little extra sauce for the top too. Looking forward to meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow! Thanks, this is a keeper for me:)

I enjoyed this recipe. Only change was I added a few slices of crumbled up bacon for a little extra flavor. Then for the topping I put in a tablespoon of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and a tinch more brown sugar. It's a great, yet simple recipe!

This came out awesome.  I made it GLUTEN FREE by substituting the bread crumbs for crushed Rice Chex.  Also, sautéed the onions before and added some garlic and herbs.

Excellent! I agree with others to double the sauce. A lot of it caramelizes and cooks down, so the extra sauce is welcome. Also, line baking pan with non-stick foil completely or you will be scrubbing pan later. I also added 3 crushed cloves of garlic to mixture and oregano. I left off the milk but added 2 T heavy cream. Also, seasoned bread crumbs.

I substituted Ground Turkey for the ground beef. I found the meat not firm enough when I was cutting and serving it, and it easily broke apart.  Flavor was fine, but not the best ever.

I used the recipe and added green bell pepper and used Sweet baby rays BBQ sauce with brown sugar for a topping and it was just delicious.

I am new in the kitchen.  I made this meatloaf for the hubby it was easy and he liked it.  It was really greasy when it came out of the oven and I didn't think it would be good but it was.  The sauce was tasty.  I will be making it again.  Just gotta figure out that grease situation.  I also made it with 2 lbs of meat because we like meaty meals.

Not loving the brown sugar. Otherwise, excellent recipe. I leave out the onions and add more ketchup.  Used seasoned bread crumbs.

After preparing this meatloaf many times, we finally have it down to a T on how we like it. Keep the beef, egg, bread crumbs, salt, pepper, mustard and ketchup. Add 1/3 cup of barbeque sauce, 1 tablespoon of garlic powder, 2 tablespoons of minced onion and a 1/2 pound sage sausage. Omit the brown sugar and milk entirely. Delicious!

I just made this for the second time and it was just as delicious as the first!  I didn't change a thing.  The sauce definitely makes this meatloaf and using raw onion gives this a nice crunch.  The next time I make this I think I'm going to throw a little green bell pepper in it for just a little more texture!

I really liked this meatloaf!  The only thing I did different is not use all of the onion.  Thought that would be overkill.  I was a little nervous about using milk but it came out great!  I did uses lean ground beef.  As another reviewer said, let the meatloaf sit for about 5 minutes so it does not fall apart when you cut it.  The texture was great!  As for the sauce, I think next time I will use less mustard.

I was looking for a nice comfort food meatloaf and I found it. This was really good. My husband and I both thought the sauce was too sweet so when I made it the next night I reduced the brown sugar by half & it was much better.  Already have a few thoughts for my next attempts with this recipe!!!!!!!

I would definitely suggest using lean ground beef. It wasn't bland for me because I seasoned the meat. I used panko bread crumbs because it was all I had:p an it turned out great! I also cooked it a little longer than what was recommended. My only complain about this recipe was the sauce. I mixed it together and I felt the mustard taste was overwhelming! Bleh! So I nixed that and came up with my own of tomato sauce, brown sugar, ketchup and browning sauce. Baby and hubby liked it and it tastes even better the next day. The next time I make it I plan to add more to the meatloaf. This recipe is a keeper!

I just made it!!!!! Soooo good !!!  I doubled the recipe. I added Worcester sauce. I also sautéed onions and garlic. I made extra sauce for the top. I removed from the grease and placed in a pan to heat later. I know the guys will love this. I think you could add even more of your favorite ingredients to make it your own but I wouldn't change it to much. Yummy !!!

This is a great easy recipe with some added touches. I added green and red peppers, 1/2 cup Ritz cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup seasoned Italian bread crumbs and 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce. The taste was great! The sauce on top I doubled as suggested and it turned out yummy! This was my first meatloaf and I will be making this one again, and again, and again!

I'm enjoying this meatloaf now! I had to cook it for 20 minutes longer since after an hour it was still raw in the middle. For the onions I substituted 1 tbsp of onion powder. I'll definitely be making this one again!

This was tasty with some modifications. I added onion powder, ground sage, black ground pepper, salt, and a Northwoods seasoning that has a kick to it, to the rest of the ingredients. I also increased the topping a bit and added nutmeg, clove and dry mustard and a touch of cayenne. Made an excellent meatloaf!

The recipe was ok except for the sauce. It has too much mustard and brown sugar. Next time I'll decrease that or just use barbecue sauce on top.

This has got to be the best meatloaf recipe I've ever used. I used ground round and bottled BBQ sauce but otherwise made no changes.
8/24/2014  Still my favorite meatloaf recipe.  Works every time, even if my ingredient amounts aren't 'exact':  little more or little less meat, smaller eggs, etc.

This was a very easy to make meatloaf that had great flavor. I used ground turkey instead of beef and the recipe still turned out nicely. The only suggestion I would make is if you are not a fan of mustard, you may want to exclude it from the glaze. The listed measurements for the glaze was more than enough for the meatloaf, so losing the mustard won't affect amount needed to cover the loaf.  My son loved the meat but hated the mustardy flavor of the glaze.

I made a meatloaf several years ago but because it did not turn out good i never attempted to make another meatloaf till last week when I came across this recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers. I sautéed the onions and double the sauce. Even though I only had 1 lb of beef to use the double sauce was not enough. Will have to make more sauce next time. This was DELICIOUS. Thank you for the recipe.

We use 1 lb venison and 1/2 lb pork with this recipe, along with worcestershire sauce.  The milk/bread mixture looks way to wet when mixed in but the end result is delicious!   The sauce topping does taste like barbecue sauce...Who knew?

I used to HATE meatloaf. This is the best meatloaf I have ever had. The moistness is incredible. I'm not sure I used all the exact measurements, and I used ground turkey -but it was finger-licking good. I also made it in a muffin pan. Makes for super easy serving and storing...not that there was any left!

I also recommend adding chopped bell pepper and a little Italian style tomato paste and ketchup with the ground beef mixture. That way the flavor is kicked up on the inside as well as the outside! Trust me its delicious!!!It's my mom's recipe and I love it!

I was looking for a "traditional" meatloaf recipe that didn't have too many frills.  THIS IS IT! This is a great basic meatloaf recipe.  With a few minor tweeks, this was amazing! Firstly, I used 1lb. of ground beef and 1/2lb of ground pork. I used about 2Tbsp of Worcestershire, I used about 3 cloves of fresh garlic minced and I used fresh breadcrumbs as I had a left over baguette that I blasted in the food processor. The sauce - I doubled the recipe, not including the mustard. Added some Balsamic Vinegar and a finely diced Jalapeno pepper for a bit of heat.  This was truly a great recipe - so good there were no leftovers. Next time I make this, I will double every ingredient!

This turned out wonderful everyone loved it.
 I did double the sauce because we are huge fans of ketchup. I also took the advice of some of the other cooks reviews and added the minced garlic and sauteed the onions and garlic before mixing in with the meat as well as adding Worcestershire sauce and I replaced the milk with low sodium chicken broth due to being lactose intolerant.  I then cooked it on the grill indirect heat due to it being so hot out lately I did not want to heat up the kitchen and work the air conditioning anymore than necessary.  This will be my go to recipe for meatloaf.  Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe except I left out the mustard because I am allergic to it and left out the pepper and salt (I am sensitive to salt and hate pepper). I used a meatloaf pan that has an insert to keep the meatloaf above the grease. The problem is that the meatloaf held onto the grease. The breadcrumbs soak up all the grease so NONE dripped into the pan! If I use this recipe again I will cut the breadcrumbs to 1/4 cup so that the grease comes out of the meatloaf. The texture was mushy and greasy. I will also use less brown sugar because the topping was too sweet

I have been making this recipe for over 50 years. We use tomato juice in place of the milk. In place of the bread crumbs, we used crushed saltine crackers or oatmeal. Both make a nice meatloaf that will not fall apart.   Excellent for sandwiches the next day. If you want a less sweet sauce on the top, use less brown sugar.

This recipe is awesome!  I went through and used most of the tips that others had left such as seasoned bread crumbs ans Worcestershire sauce.  I also used 1 pound of lean ground beef and 1 pound of ground sausage.  I doubled the amount of sauce but halved the amount of brown sugar to 1 TBSP.  It was DELICIOUS!!

This is the only meatloaf my husband will eat. I have made it many times.  It is a very good meatloaf.  Usally, I saute the onions first but if in a rush, I just chop them fine and throw them in. Sometimes add a splash of worchestershire sauce. (BTW - my husband wants meatloaf without breadcrumbs. LOL. He doesn't even know they are in there.)

I made this recipe tonight. I put a half of cup of milk Paula dean house season and seasoned croutons crushed in my phone processor. Everything eles was followed to the t.  I cooked it on 350 but wasn't done in an hour so I bumped it up to 425 for 20 mins or so.  It was moist, tasteful and amazing. I will only make this meatloaf for now on.

I made this recipe last week and it was delish.  My boyfriend even told his mom that it was the best meatloaf he has ever had.  I don't think she liked that too much.  Even the left overs tasted amazing.  This will be a family staple.  It was my first time ever making a meatloaf and it was moist and full of flavor.  My only changes were to the sauce.  My family loves spicy food, so I used a jalapeno ketchup and a horseradish mustard.  AMAZING.  Just the right amount of kick :)

Other than using seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain, I made exactly as written. It was awesome! My whole family loved it. This will be my go-to meatloaf recipe. Maybe next time I will try adding a little worst. sauce as others have recommended, but I can't imagine it being any better.

So, I just now made this. I followed the recipe EXACTLY. And it turned out mushy, soggy and looked totally unappealing. I ended up adding the mushy wet mess into spaghetti sauce and made weird spaghetti for dinner.

I followed the recipe closely, but added celery and chopped bell pepper. Found it to be extremely bland, and was disappointed. Consistency was too moist and it wouldn't hold together.

This was a huge hit in my household.  In fact, the unanimous comment was "this is the best meatloaf you've ever made".  So, out with my old recipe!

It's a staple in our kitchen.  I use onion powder instead of fresh onion for my kids.  It eliminates the possibility of one of them finding a piece of onion in the meat!

I made this for dinner 2 nights ago, it was a big hit and easy to make. I did as suggested and used Italian bread crumbs which gave it a yummy flavor. I forgot to add the Worcestershire sauce but will add next time!

It took me 2 hours and 15 minutes for this meatloaf to cook! It was really mushy, too much milk I think. I'll go back to grandma's recipe next time.

I actually made this meatloaf recipe in a cupcake tin. I used 1 pound of ground chuck and 1/2 a pound of ground turkey. I didn't have an onion or bread crumbs, so I substituted dried minced onions and crushed saltine crackers. I also added some Worcestershire sauce and Cholula hot sauce to the meat mixture. (My family likes things with some zing to it.) I also added Cholula hot sauce and some dijon mustard to the sauce mixture for on top of the meat. The recipe was really easy to follow and I can't wait to make it again.


I don't know the caloric intake and such because I tweaked it.

Great flavor - enjoyed by everyone.  Have made over and over again...best served with mashed potatoes of course! I also made a simple brown gravy and added some of the topping mixture and Worcestershire sauce to the gravy to give it great complimenting flavor. 

Notes below. 
I made with 2.25 lbs ground beef and so adjusted other ingredients to: 2 eggs, 2-3 shakes of minced onions, 1.5 cups of milk, 1.5 cups of seasoned bread crumbs (the SEASONED part makes a big difference) and I sprinkled Worcestershire Sauce all over the top prior to putting the brown sugar/ketchup/mustard on the top. 

I made 3x the sauce to put on top as I made 2 loaves with this recipe.  

I also cooked it for the 1 hour at 350F and then an additional 30 minutes at 225F.  Internal temperature 160-165F.

I made this recipe according to the directions except I put BBQ sauce and slices of uncooked bacon on the top of meatloaf, instead of the brown sugar glaze that is stated.  I baked it as directed and it turned out teriffic.  Since the bacon cooked while the meatoaf was baking, the flavor from the bacon really blended well with the meatloaf.  Everyone loved it and went back for seconds.

I changed the recipe of easy meatloaf to make it with oatmeal, and saute onion and mushroom. The other change is the almond milk. My husband and I love this meatloaf recipe.

Awesome! Simple, easy meatloaf!  I used 1 & 1/2 hoagie rolls as crumbs (all I had in the house) added about 1/4 cup of Heinz Chili Sauce to the mix (in the ketchup isle in the grocery store) and used the chili sauce with the brown sugar as the glaze.  My SUPER picky 11 year old daughter LOVED it!  Thanks!! It is going in the dinner rotation!

This recipe was great! I did make a few changes per other reviews. I added 1.5 Tbs Worcesters sauce, 3 cloves minced garlic, used italian bread crumbs, and used double ketchup and less mustard. My husband and friend loved it and there were almost no leftovers. Love it! Will definitely go into my collection of recipes to use on a regular basis.

Not something my husband usually loves, but everyone, including my 2 year old, raved about it.  He actually asked that I make it again tonight.  The only things I changed were 1) I sauted the onion first because I think it adds a little more flavor and 2) I didn't have breadcrumbs on hand so I pulsed up a piece of wheat toast in my food processor.  Delicious!

I guess this was easy, but it was also quite bland. The other reviewers had warned me, and I meant to add in some more spices but forgot. The consistency was good. I left the brown sugar out of the sauce, and it was just sweet enough (ketchup is already pretty sweet). I will probably try to make this again, but I will add in some onion soup mix, dried parsley, and more worcestershire sauce.

This was an easy recipe that helped me use up some ingrediants before they went bad. The recipes that I use are usually much more complicated so I had to make myself follow the recipe as written. It reminded me of meatloaf that my mom made when I was a kid. I kind of wish that I had added some crackers in addition to the bread crums for more texture but it was good without them and it brought me back to when I was a kid.

I just made this recipe tonight and it came out great!  I am not much of a cook so this means it must really be a fool-proof recipe.  I sautéed the onion and green pepper before adding it to the meat and added Worcestershire sauce to the sauce.  It was really delicious!

Just cooked it tonight for dinner, and I have to say: this meatloaf had too much onion and too much brown sugar. I'd cut the onion in half, as well as the mustard and brown sugar, and double the ketchup. I also had to cook it longer. Next time (if I make it again) I would cook it at 350 for an hour and a half, or 375 for an hour.

I would not use this recipe again.  I altered a few things 1)sautéed onions, 2) what about milk?  I never used that before 3). Needed much more than an hour to cook. The taste was just okay.  I think there are better recipes out there.

I have made this around 5 times now and every time it is heaven. We don't use beef for anything, so its always made with ground turkey, which I think tastes much yummier. I always saute the onions and add garlic too. I either double or triple the sauce and highly recommend that. My 4-year-old loves it too! One of our favorites in the house.

I made this last night and it came out perfectly! The only thing I did differently was add some steak sauce to flavor the meat a bit.

Been looking for a basic meatloaf recipe and this was perfect. I added a bit of herbs and a little Worcestershire sauce.  Family loved it. Onions could have used a bit more cooking as others mentioned. Didn't do the topping at all.

After reading the reviews, I sauteed the onion as well as added the Worcestershire.  I also flattened it out prior to cooking and added a layer of mozzarella and some basil then rolled and into the oven.  Fantastic!!!

My family loves this recipe. We use a mini loaf pan which holds six loaves so that everyone can have the whole range of cuts that you would have from one big loaf pan.

This is my go-to meatloaf recipe. It is simple and delicious. I followed other reviewers' tip and sauteed the onions in butter before adding them to the mix. The sauce is delicious, as well. Thanks for a great recipe!

This meatloaf turned out amazing. I brought the left overs to my parents. My dad said it was better than my moms! That's a pretty good compliment and my boyfriend had thirds. I added worcestershire sauce, minced garlic (maybe 2 tsp.), and used a bag of seasoned crumbled croutons instead of bread crumbs. I too doubled the sauce but instead of 2/3 cup of ketchup I used 1/3 cup ketchup and 1/3 cup A1. I did need to cook it for about 1.5 hours but I used almost 2 lbs of hamburger instead of just 1.5.

My family raves about this meatloaf.  My grandson really like it a lot and wants me to make it again soon.  I used seasoned bread crumbs which brings a lot of flavor to the dish.  First time I used dried onion flakes which worked really well.  Second, time I used onion powder because my grandchildren don't like the texture of onions.  That worked out equally well.  First time I did the topping which added a lot of flavor.  Second time, my son did not have all of the ingredients for the topping but the meatloaf was still excellent.

3 1/2 I only used one lb. of meat, 1/2 onion, 1/2 cup milk, 1 TBL. worcestershire sauce.  It seemed like way too much liquid, even after one and 1/2 hours of cooking, it didn't firm up.  My second attempt I used the correct amounts so it did firm up, I also added mushrooms and green pepper for flavor and texture.  Also, a packet of onion mix is easier.

I made this meatloaf without any changes to the recipe, other than using ground pork instead of ground beef, since beef is unavailable here. It was absolutely delicious, and made me a fan of meatloaf for the first time in my life. With the addition of bread crumbs and milk, the loaf is much less dense and heavy than the ones I grew up eating in the 60's. The glaze is indeed sweet, but is a nice burst of flavor ~ especially with the tangy mustard. I'll definitely make this again!

Made the meatloaf in loaf pan that had an insert to keep the meatloaf about an inch from the bottom of the loaf pan.  Followed recipe exactly.  Meatloaf was ready in an hour and 15 minutes.  It was moist, but it needed some more flavoring.  As other reviewers suggested, Worcestershire sauce would be a good addition.  Also found the topping too sweet.

Overall, a great recipe, though, that I'm sure I'll be able to tweak to my liking.

This was really good.  I used ground elk meat instead of beef and followed the suggestions I saw in other reviews regarding the onions, seasoned bread crumbs and worcestershire sauce.  I added a tablespoon of A1 too for added flavor.  Hubby and boys ate this up.

I have used this recipe several times since finding it. One of the easiest, beginner meatloaf recipes I've found. Great way to start adding other things you may like in your own recipe. However, left as is, it's perfectly delicious.

This was amazing! Will definitely make again!  I did what others suggested and sauteed my onions and some garlic and butter before adding it to meat. also couple dashes of worchshire sauce to meat. doubled the sauce, not the brown sugar and added a dash of cayaenne peeper and mustard powder to sauce!  WOW! Everyone had seconds! It was a hit

Great recipe for a household staple. I like to also add some worchester sauce, and I also grate all the veggies. Try adding in carrots, green bell pepper, and celery. TONS of veggies, and no one will know it. The topping is a little mustard heavy for me, so I just used a touch more ketchup and a tad less mustard. Also, this is enough to make two bread pans worth. Cook one freeze one or make it the next night for meatloaf sandwiches. 

Give this one a whirl folks.

I made this for supper this evening and it was absolutely delicious. I did a couple of things differently which I do believe added to the wonderful taste. I added 3 tablespoons of brown sugar to the meatloaf itself and I also added 1 teaspoon of garlic. Lastly, I cooked it for 1.5 hours instead of the one hour that it was calling for in the recipe. I find that meatloaf tends to be mushy in the middle if it isn't cooked enough. My husband, my 8 year old son and I loved it and will definitely be having it again in the future. Excellent recipe!!!

Good base recipe. I use half ground pork and half ground beef. Finely chopped onion and a couple garlc cloves in food processor, then sauteed in a little extra virgin olive oil. Italian bread crumbs with romano cheese. 1T worcestershire sauce. Mound mixture in center of lightly greased 9" square baking dish and surround with peas (I use steam-in-a-bag, prepared). Cover meat with 3x catsup/mustard mixture and only a tablespoon or 2 of brown sugar. During baking process, I periodically mix peas so they don't dry out. I serve with Chef John's Perfect Mashed Potatoes (sometimes adding blue cheese, cheddar, or garlic to them).

My husband loved it. I was so nervous making this for the first time. Doubled the sauce amount as others suggested. Also cooked the onion in butter and garlic before mixing in, but not sure that I could detect the difference. My only complaint is that it was incredibly soggy. Like, dripping with fat and oils. Not sure how to fix that. Also had to cook it for about 1 hr 15 mins.

Easy to make and mixture on the top was good.  I would use 1/2 an onion in the future...it's too much.  Also, adding some worcestershire would be good (to the meat mixture).  It needed 20 minutes longer to cook through as well.

I made the basic meatloaf recipe from this, then used Chef John's Creamy Mushroom Meatloaf recipe for the topping, instead of the brown sugar/mustard/catsup.  I'm sure this is great the way it is, but the mushroom sauce makes it fit for serving to guests on a special occasion.

One option if the topping is too sweet is to use canned tomato sauce.  This is almost identical to my Mom's recipe and she mixed half a can of sauce in the loaf and topped it with the rest.

Great recipe! First time made meatloaf. It is easy to make and it's delicious. I follow some of reviewers, I added chopped red bell paper, chopped sweet onion, dry chopped basil leaf, also add Worcestershire sauce. I used seasoned bread crumbs for meatball as already have it in my kitchen. I double quantity of the sauce as some said the original recipe is not enough. It turns out real YUMMY. My hubby loves it. Will make it again.

My husband and daughter hate meatloaf... untill today.  I added the Worchestershire and about 1/2 cup of diced red pepper that I had left over. I also doubled the ketchup in the sauce. They both came back for seconds!

Loved this meatloaf recipe! I never add reviews and I just had to with this recipe. It really is easy to make, I did not use 1 whole onion which I regret... but it was still amazing! Also did not use the brown sugar just ketchup and Worcestershire sauce in the meat while mixing it and again on top before baking. 
Pointer: use green pepper in the mix.

This was very good.  I added the worchestire sauce as some reviewers suggested.  I loved the ketchup glaze.  It was so moist my husband said next time cook it longer for his personal taste of dry meatloaf.

So good! very moist and flavorful. I used only half of onion pack and then added a spoonful of onion flakes. I also didn't have crackers but I had bread crumbs with seasoning and it was delicious still.

We love this recipe. Here are my changes. I use lean ground turkey breast. I add in worcestershire sauce in both meat and sauce. I add mustard  and catsup to meat. 

Turkey cooks faster. Expect about 50 min to each 175 degrees

Easy and turned out delicious! I reduced the onion by half, will saute full onion next time as suggested. Used Italian breadcrumbs for flavor, added a dash of garlic powder, and mixed a couple tbsp ketchup into loaf. I actually didn't have prepared mustard on hand, so I used a little bit (about 1 tbsp) of yellow mustard - it tasted AMAZING in the "glaze". BF loved the brown sugar flavor, too.

Tonight was my first shot at a meatloaf and I tried this recipe. I didn't add any onion, because my son (or I ;)) don't like onions, so I substituted with some minced garlic. I also used some Italian Bread Crumbs because that is all that I had. I didn't add any brown sugar to my mustard and ketchup sauce, but that's pretty much the only things I tweaked on this recipe. I also gave it an extra 15 minutes of bake time just to be safe :) 
This meatloaf came out amazing!!! I can't wait to serve it to my husband, who is in the military and is away right now. 
New dinner to add to the roster! :)

I have made this meatloaf for 4 years now and it remains a family favorite. The only thing I take out is the onions as my family doesn't care for the texture of the onions in meatloaf.  I do add a bit of onion and garlic powder, as well as some italian seasoning to the mixture.  I also use spicy brown mustard in the sauce. I do have to add more ketchup as others have stated for enough sauce. I bake it on a sheet pan shaped in a loaf and it comes out perfect.

GREAT simple recipe. Only change I made was to add 2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce to the meat and used onion salt instead of actual onion (we're not big onion people) and it turned out GREAT! No leftovers at all. Defiantly added to my recipe book.

This is sooo good!...and easy to make. I like to add a clove of chopped garlic and I put much less mustard because otherwise it takes over the sauce.

Very simple and easy recipe with delicious results! I used a pound of 93/7 ground beef and a pound of ground pork. For bread crumbs, I put small chunks of leftover italian crusty bread into my food processor and pulsed until it was fine crumbs. I did sautee the onions in butter before putting them in the meat mixture. This is going on my go-to list for everyday dinner recipes!

Just delicious!  Very easy and very tasty.  The onions made the house and my clothes smell 'fragrant' for a few days after this so be sure to shut bedroom doors if you're in tight quarters and open the windows.

I have now made this meatloaf twice and my husband and I LOVE it.  I followed the above suggestions and doubled the ketchup and brown sugar for the glaze and made a free form loaf to maximize the glazed surface.  One of our recipe mainstays now!

I hadn't had the best of luck with meatloaf recipes.  They were either too bland or too exotic for my and/or my family's taste.  This one was really good.  It did take about 35-40 minutes longer to cook in the oven.

Good meal.   Paired it with some leftover stuffing, broccoli, rolls, and macaroni and cheese.  Good meal.

Amazing meatloaf! The sauce was great! Leftovers were great too! I followed what user 1 & 2 has said. Saute the onion with garlic and butter and add 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce to the meatloaf.

Delish!  My husband and I both loved it.  Very moist.  Followed other reviews and sauteed the onions first, added Worchestershire, made extra sauce (which it needed) but other than that stuck to the recipe.  Give it a try!

I wasn't sure how many stars to give this because I have to give it a mixed review. The sauce that topped the meatloaf was absolutely delicious. Whether or not I make t his meatloaf recipe again, I will definitely use that sauce again. But after following this recipe exactly, the meatloaf came out too soft & squishy. It was done & I even cooked it longer than it said, but still very soft. I think the problem was the milk. My advice would be leave out the milk altogether because it adds way too much moisture.

My go-to meatloaf recipe.  I like to sautee the onion first before adding to the meat, etc.  Always a great comforting meal with smashed potatoes and a green salad and wonderful for sandwiches the next day.

I sauteed the onions per someone's suggestion and added a little Worcestershire Sauce. My son and I loved the sauce but my husband and daughter did not. I'll just have to make with sauce and without next time.

This is a great Meatloaf recipe! I added a little garlic powder and Worchestershire Sauce to the meat and it was soooo good! Next time I might make some extra sauce, it was enough to cover the top but once sliced I wanted more. YUM YUM!

I did not like this meatloaf... I see most people did, and I'm not sure why. I did add the extra ketchup and Worcestershire sauce like suggested. It was very just very "wet" meatloaf and little flavor.

I refuse to alter this recipe except that I use gluten free ingredients.  My husband did not like meatloaf until this recipe.  Best meatloaf I have ever had or made!

Love this recipe, have made it numerous times now, but have always used ground moose meat, and cooked my onions prior to adding to the meatloaf. I season with steak spice and try to crush up ground croutons that are flavored, just for a little extra flavor.  Turned out great every time.

Not a keeper. I followed the recipe and even added extra seasoning and ketchup and bbq sauce and it was so bland, dry and tasteless.

Wanna make it fantastic? Next time you make it, add sliced olives, chopped mushrooms (whichever you like most) and drained, whole kernel corn (BONUS: you can actually save $$$ on ground beef this way) to the actual meatloaf mix before cooking. If you're like me, you'll also add crushed/minced garlic and a touch of chili (or spicier) seasonings to the mix for a little added kick. I don't include quantities because I pretty much "eyeball it" according to my mood. Tasty tasty!!!

We really like a sweet glaze on top of the meatloaf, so this was great for us!  I only left out the mustard, hubby doesn't like it.. We were pleased with this recipe, thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe.  I made it for a family gathering and everyone loved it.  Some said it was the best meatloaf they'd ever eaten!!!  I used two pounds ground beef and added a couple grated carrots, but I'm sure it would've been fantastic made exactly to the recipe.

Really turned out amazing; I used shallots instead of onion, as far as sautéing them, I just fried them gently in butter and still near raw, added a teaspoon and a half of pepper, almost a tablespoon kosher salt.  For the topping instead of straight up mustard, I made some with 2 tbs of ground mustard, 2 tsp of vinegar, .5 tsp sugar, mixed well, added 1/3 cup, and tablespoon ketchup, 1.5 tbs of brown sugar, mixed well, and sealed the top of the loaf with the mixture which made it medium rare near the top as it cooked up.  I also used 6 slices of italian bread for the bread crumbs, and made sure the baking dish was buttered.  I didn't need any Worcestershire sauce for this, and it had the fresh red meat at the top cooked to 145 degrees inside.  The whole baking dish was gone in a matter of 16 minutes!

Loved this recipe as a strong base.

I changed a few things. I sauteed the onions and also added fresh garlic and mushrooms. I put in asian hot sauce and more worchestershire in both the meatloaf itself and the sauce. I used grainy mustard instead.

It was amazing!

This recipe is very good.  Am really impressed.  To those who didn't like the sauce try BBQ sauce on top.  You can put as little or as much on of your favorite sauce on there.

So-so.  Wasn't the best and wasn't the worst.  I made a separate BBQ sauce to go over the top.  I might try to find a better recipe to make next time.

Tried this tonight and fed my brothers. They loved it. We found the topping a little tangy. One brother liked it that way. Other brother and myself could have done without it. All around, a cinche to make and really tasty. Thanks for the recipe!!

This was very good and easy to make! I took the other reviewers' advice and 1) sauteed the onions in butter and garlic, 2) added 1 tbsp of worschteshire sauce. I also added a thin layer of the seasoned bread crumbs on top and then poured the sauce on.

1 hr isn't quite long enough, I think. I would cook it closer to 90 minutes next time but it was very good!

Fantastic.  Very moist and flavorful.  I have prepared it as the recipe says many times.  I have also used less onion since my daughter isn't very fond of it.  Still great.  Also added the topping into the mixture, instead of a glaze.  It was an case of too many cooks in the kitchen.  I think it was even better that way.

This is a great, basic recipe that can be altered according to tastes.  Kudos to Janet!

I used Italian breadcrumbs and a different sauce:

1/2 cup catsup
1 tsp cumin (or less)
Dash Worcestershire
Dash hot pepper sauce (optional)
1 tablespoon honey

I form the loaf by hand so I can slather sauce on all 3 sides.  Also I have added pureed vegetables to the recipe with great success.  (One way to hide them from certain children)

This was my first attempt at making meatloaf, and I have to admit, the mix looked WAY too watery with all the milk, so I added in some more breadcrumbs. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out good, but still a little TOO moist for my tastes, I think next time I will cut the milk in the recipe down to make it a little less mushy. It was a good tasting meatloaf though, and tasted even better the next day, although I usually dislike leftovers. I will definitely make this again with a little tweaking in reducing the milk.

This is meatloaf I have been eating since I was very small, my Grandmother always made it, for people who don't like meatloaf they will change their minds after this one.  Only suggestion: add spices to your personal taste,
Good job in posting it

I didn't have prepared mustard so I used dry mustard. I added more bread crumbs after the milk was added because it got a bit too squishy for my preference. Used garlic and herb bread crumbs because it's what we had on hand, and added a couple splashes of worcestershire and soy to the mix. My kids loved it and my mom said it was the best she's ever tasted.

YUMMY! ;) I didn't have bread crumbs so i substituted with plane corn flakes. Taste really good. I also added a bit of dry basil and oregano.

My family said this was the best meatloaf Ive ever made! I thought the ratio of ingredients were spot on. Resulted in a moist flavorful loaf that cut and stayed in form perfectly. Bravo, will be my go to recipe for meatloaf from now on!

I followed the recipe, and the texture was enough to make me gag.  Wayyyy too much liquid in this recipe.   You're best bet: pass this recipe up and keep looking!

I followed recipe exactly and it is the most boring meatloaf we have ever tasted. Way too much bread crumbs and even though I added salt and pepper, the flavour was minimal. Would not make again.

I was very excited to try this recipe based on all the reviews I've read here but was diapointed with the end results. Though I followed the recipe exactly I ended up with what is best described as meatmush rather than meatloaf. I found the taste quite bland and used lots of mustard to bring it up a lot. I only added mushrooms and garlic to the recipe. Perhaps using fine bread crumbs was my mistake in the the mushy part of the dish?. I will try this recipe again but will use more bread crumbs and additonal spice to pick up the flavour. As an aside it did make fine sandwiches the next day after a night in the fridge to from the mixture up. Mayo and mustard added to the rye bread for a nice sandwich.

We are making this again tonight. This meatloaf recipe is great. Thanks for sharing. It is my go to recipe for meatloaf, very simple & I always have the ingredients on hand. The only change I made was used turkey meat & lean ground beef. I also took the suggestion and sauted the onions in garlic & butter. In addition, I also doubled the sauce- just a personal preference for my family.

This was very good although as usual I added a bit more to the recipe. Garlic for one, green onion for color and worchestershire sauce. Some meat seasoning, plus I used Dejon Mustard. Other than that it was delicious.

I can't believe how good this turned out for how easy it was.  This was so delicious.  My husband was the only one who made a great meatloaf and when he tried this he was playfully mad, because it was better than his.  This was delicious, moist, tasty!  I kinda eyeballed the ingredients for the top and and added a couple jalapenos in it and it was the best meatloaf we ever had.  Thanks for the very EASY and great recipe.

Good old fashioned recipe. I mixed Tiger Sauce (bottle found in Texas) into the topping of brown sugar & ketsup. Tiger sauce adds a spicy taste.

Awesome recipe and very easy.  Definately follow advice to saute the onions in butter before mixing in with rest of ingredients.  My meatloaf also took longer than 1 hour to cook, just keep an eye on it.

Really easy to make meatloaf.  Very basic and you can add other ingredients to make it more flavorful.  Added carrots, Worcestershire sauce, some garlic, and used a mixture of pork , beef, and veal. Consistency was very moist.  I hate dry meatloaf.  Cook till 155-160F.

I have never liked meatloaf, but my husband grew up loving it. So, I gave this recipe a shot and he LOVES it, I LOVE it, and our son LOVES it. (I don't add onion is the only chage I made). The sauce that goes on top just makes it and the house smell so good. It has wonderful flavor for the tastebuds...it's a  keeper!

Great recipe! Lots of flavor, and the sauce adds a unique flavor to set you apart from other recipes. In my recipe I only used half an onion which i sauteed before. I also added the recommended tablespoon of Worcestershire, and doubled the sauce recipe. I also cooked it just a tad longer. Overall great recipe!

This was so good! I did as suggested by other users: decreased mustard to 1 TBS, added 1 TBS Worcestershire sauce, used seasoned breadcrumbs, and probably used a little more meat then called for. Was nummy :) I like a sweet red sauce top so it was a wonderful version of a classic for my family :D

Simple recipe...I add tons of garlic, italian seasoning, dry mustard, onion powder, crushed pepper flakes, etc. And, also...at least a couple cups of shredded cheese. Plus, I add all sorts of spices to the sauce as well...and just used horseradish mustard instead of regular and it was great! PERFECT (with all of the additional spice and cheese)!

i have not tried the recipe, but i will be cooking it tonight. i also agree with cooking up the onion a little before hand. my mother makes an awesome meatloaf, but that stubborn italian woman wont give it up. So i am resorting to this. In addition to this recipe i will also be adding barbecue sauce, because i know besides the breadcrumbs thats what she adds!!!! will post after we eat!! I made it that night..it was moist and great.. i made it again 2/28/2012...this time a little less milk, kept on with cooking the onion, and the barbecue is to die for!!!! i live in a house of 4 and it was gone within a day.. im starting to think my recipe is better than my moms!!

Ok.....so I made this tonight.....I used dried onions (because I'm not a fan of fresh CRUNCHY ones, and added some worcestershire sauce. I made 3 mini-loaves vs. 1 large one and still had to cook for 1 hour.  They are SOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!  My "meatloaf mix was 1/3 of each of the following.....Ground Beef, Pork and Veal.  I will DEFINITELY make this again and again!  even my icky 11 year old will eat this!!!!

I made this once before and my kids LOVED it!!! (I am making it again tonight).  I did leave out the mustard and onion thinking the kids would not like it, but they are asking me to put those ingredients in tonight when I make it.  I will though (per a reader's post) sautee the onions first. I think by doing that the kids won't feel the crunch of the not fully cooked onions.  Otherwise, a really delicious dish and so very easy to make!!

Excellent.  I used ground beef/turkey mix, added a splash of Worcestershire sauce, and used dijon in the topping.  The loaf was mixed and in the oven in less than 10 minutes; can't get much easier than that!

I'm not even a big meatloaf person, but I LOVED this.  I also did what others did and sauteed the onions with some garlic and olive oil.  I also added worchestershire sauce.  I also used ground turkey because it's what I had.  And it is soooooooo good.  It was incredibly fast to put together, although I did cook it for an hour and ten minutes.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was a hit with my family... the only thing I would change is using half of the recommended brown sugar to bring down the sweetness a tad.  Other than that it was amazing.

This is the first meatloaf I ever made and it turned out great. I did what other reviewers recommended--I added worstershire sauce and garlic powder to the meatloaf itself and doubled the topping.

This is a very easy and yummy meat loaf. I used half ground turkey and half beef to make it a bit more healthy. I also cook it on a bed of potatos or frozen tater tots to make a this easy meal even more complete!

Very good!  I cooked for one hour and twenty five minutes and as other reviewers suggested sauteed onion.  I also tripled the sauce omitting a little mustard.  I used Italian bread crumbs.  Will use this recipe again!

normally i don't like meatloaf but found this edible. My husband and son loved it and were suprised to hear what the sauce was made of. I added about 1/4 c more ketchup to the sauce and used italian bread crumbs.

I handed this recipe to my brother to make for dinner cause my husband and I were going to be busy but still wanted dinner. It didn't specify what size of onion so he used a large onion that ended up clearly being too much. I added a little bit of salt and garlic powder to my slice after it was done and it helped. I wish I would have showed him how to read the reviews because it was a little blan. We are going to try this recipe one more time but using all the advice on the reviews because there was not nearly enough sauce either.

Delicious. We like to use it to make both meatloaf and meatloaf muffins (a mini meatloaf in a ramekin with mashed potatoes on top). Great for a weeknight dinner or serving for guests.

Super easy and quite good - even my 1 1/2 year old ate a whole slice!  I used dried minced onion instead of fresh and added a little garlic powder and cut the brown sugar in half.  I'll likely make this again.

This was good, but I like the Brown Sugar Meat Loaf recipe on allrecipes the best.

Delish!!! Took others suggestions of sauteeing onions first, adding a liitle Worcester and garlic, and using seasoned breadcrumbs.  Also doubled sauce.  My 2 1/2 year old who eats nothing gobbled it all up. I would probably bake a little longer next time as it was fully cooked but a tad mushy.

Love the recipe and comes out delicious. Only problem is it takes longer to cook at 350 degrees. you either need to up the temp or cook it longer.

I'm surprised this has so many stars - I made it tonight and that it was very mediocre. The mixture for the top was unappealing. Won't be making it again...

Never had meatloaf before but always wanted to try it and decided upon your recipe as it looked very easy. I am so pleased I did, I thought it was delicious and the family loved it too.

I altered it slightly by using one tbsp of dijon and slighty more ketchup. I also sauteed the onions a little beforehand.

Great recipe thanks for sharing :)

I used 1 pound of meatloaf mix (ground beef, pork & veal) instead of the ground beef. As the other reviews suggested I sauteed the onions along with the garlic first and doubled the ketchup topping. I also added 1 T A1 into the mix because I was out of Worcestershire sauce and used seasoned bread crumbs. I lined the pan with foil for easy clean up and let it sit 15 minutes before slicing.  I made this for my aunt & uncle for their 25th anniversary (meatloaf is my uncle's favorite dinner!) and it was by far the best meatloaf I ever made! I am keeping my modified version of the recipe in the family recipe book!!

This was so easy and everything already in the cuboard. I had almost 2 pds of ground beef and everyone loved it so much there is only a sliver left the next day. I put cheese in the middle just because I love cheese so much. I loved the sweetness of the sauce on top!

I gave this 5 stars because it was simple and great! My husband loved it.  I did tweek it but just a little bit and it was more in the actual sauce that I tweek for personal taste.  Overall I loved it.  Easy, convenient and FAST!

Disappointed.  We had to dip in lots of ketchup to make it taste good.  It took about 45 minutes longer to cook than stated.  It was very mushy, probably because of the amount of milk as previously mentioned.

I've been making this meatloaf for a couple of years and for a family of 6 who hates meatloaf, this is a winner.  My hubby and kids eat every drop of this.  I do make a few changes such as adding about 3tblspns of worthshire sauce, cooking the (only a half onion chopped in butter and using garlic cheese crushed croutons.  I also make more sauce but the mustard overpowers the coating so I only use half of the suggested amount.  

I usually serve this dish with mashed potatoes or a seasoned roasted red potatoes recipe I found on here with brocolli or apsaragus.  Never fails.

Overall, it's a good recipe. I doubled the sauce, but even 3T mustard was too much, and it's very sweet. Next time I'll try using 3T brown sugar and 2T mustard. The meat turned out great, but I'd add some bell pepper and garlic to give it a little more flavor.

Doubled the recipe but used 1 small can of spicy V8 and about 3/4 c. milk for the liquid. 
I have been a poor meatloaf maker until now.  My family all ate this (although the 8 year old asked for no onions next time - I might use onion powder).  They have never liked meatloaf before.  Thanks Janet!!

Awesome!  I'm not sure what makes this meatloaf so good but its my new go-to recipe.  I often make a 1.5x recipe and shape a larger loaf in a 9x13" pan so that I can have leftovers.  Otherwise it all gets gobbled up the first night!

This tastes exactly like meatloaf should taste. My friend really likes meatloaf, but I'm not as much of a fan. If I were to choose a recipe for traditional tasting meatloaf this recipe would be suitable.

I have always made my meatloaf this way with the sweet topping--YUMMY!!!  BUT what makes it even better is to omit onions and add a can of diced tomatoes.  Or try rice instead of bread crumbs.   Serve with mashed potatoes and green beans.  :)

Just made this meatloaf tonight and really was not impressed at all.  Unfortunately, I didn't read through all of the reviews and I followed the directions exactly as stated.  The result was a very bland and greasy meatloaf.  It definitely would've benefited from more seasoning and less bread crumbs.  I will definitely not use this again.

This meatloaf was actually pretty tasty.  Instead of using a whole onion I only used half and that seemed to work pretty well.  The only thing that I would change would be to not add the sauce, but that is only because I am not a fan of mustard.

Love it! I've made this several times. I can see why people might want to sautee the onions, but we like ours firm so I don't. I always add a good health squirt of ketchup (probably like 1/3 cup or so) directly into the meat mixture. It gets the sweetness throughout the whole meatloaf that way.

This is a good, simple meatloaf. I substituted onion powder for the chopped onion for the sake of convenience but otherwise followed the recipe. I was a little hesitant about the smell of the precooked ketchup/mustard/brown sugar topping but decided to give it a try anyway and am glad I did. Everyone loved it and couldn't wait to eat the leftovers the next day for lunch -- a rarity in our household!

Not sure why but my meatloaf came out stiff and hard to slice.  The good news is that it did not fall apart.  I did not heed the advice of others and cook my onions and pepper beforehand so they were a bit crunchy.  I will try it again and see if I like it better next time.  It is a good basic recipe.

I made this meatloaf last night for dinner and my husband and I loved it!  Like so many others I did also saute the onions with a little garlic and I added worcestershire sauce and it turned out so very yummy.  I did not find the sauce too sweet as some others did.  I found it a perfect balance between sweet and tang.  I personally did not double the sauce ingredients and felt that it was just the right amount of sauce for the amount of meat.  Great recipe!

I've made this a couple times now and really like it.  The topping is delicious.  I double it as other reviewers suggested.  I also brown some onions and add finely chopped carrots and shredded zucchini for an extra nutritional boost.  I need to try it with Worcestershire next time, too.

I had worried about finding a meatloaf recipe we'd all like, but this one is definitely a keeper!

Excellent base here are my tweaks: I kept everything the same and added the following: 1/4 pound ground pork. 
1 yellow onion nearly caramelized added to the meat mix. sauteed garlic in meat mix. Seasoned meat mix with lawrys seasoned salt and several shakes of Worcestershire sauce.
For the topping: I added Worcestershire and lawry's to taste. (You can use your favorite bbq sauce too.)

I had never made meatloaf before and decided to try this "easy meatloaf" and it sure was easy! It was pretty good. I think I'm ready to try a more complex recipe. :)

This was really good. I did add some garlic, italian seasoning and worchestire (sp?) sauce and I used a meatloaf mix of ground beef, pork and veal instead of just the ground beef. Hubby had 2 servings and took the rest for lunch. Good thing I made 2 and froze one for another day!

Made this for dinner tonight after my youngest requested meatloaf for the 1st time EVER. ~I can't even remember the last time I even made meatloaf. It was DELISH! The only thing I did differently was I put a layer of cheese in the middle. My daughter literally licked her plate clean!!! Simple & KidLicious!

I've never been a huge meatloaf fan but this was wonderful! Followed all the basic suggestions from other reviewers and the resulting meat loaf vanished at dinner time! It smelled so good cooking my kids were lining up in the kitchen counting down the time till it was ready. I did cook for about 1/2 the time without the sauce on the meatloaf. I used very lean beef and turkey and when I went to drain fat there was little. The top was nice and brown though, yum. Added the sauce and finished baking. The end result was a nice crisp top much like the ends we all love so much!

We love this meatloaf. Simple to make and very tasteful. Yummmmmmy. I followed the direction but doubled the saue, added a green onion and baked 20 minutes longer. Forgot to sautee onions in butter like many of the users suggested but it still came out wonderful. This recipe is a keeper!

Great basic meatloaf recipe, it comes out perfectly moist, I added about a half cup more bread crumbs because it was a little too wet and some parsley too. Leftovers worked awesome for meatloaf sandwiches the day after!

I chose to try this recipe because of it's rating and simplicity. My family and I LOVED it! Even my 21 month old son was begging for more and he is going through a phase of refusing all meat! 

The only thing I changed on subsequent times using this recipe is that I now saute the onions a bit before adding them so that they cook down a little more and are not quite so crunchy in the finished product. I'm not so great at dicing. If I could chop them a little smaller I might not have to do this... but I don't mind since it only take a couple of minutes and a small pat of butter.

Awesome, but not sure it would be awesome without the modifications reviewers suggest which is why I give it 4 stars. Definitely double the sauce, brown the onions and cook for longer than one hour. Otherwise definitely a keeper!

This meatloaf is the best I've found so far. It didn't fall apart when cutting it, moist and the sauce was sweet and tangy. I took some of the other reviewers' advice and added worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture, made extra sauce and only used about 1/3 of the suggested mustard. The kids who NEVER eat meatloaf really liked it.

This meatloaf was a huge disappointment.  It was so bland, the only thing that made it edible was adding a lot of barbecue sauce on top.  I'll never use this recipe again.

This recipe has become a staple in our house! the best parts about it for me is that is very flavorful, takes very little prep time, and you can literally use any kind of cracker in it! Seriously, I'm making it right now with Goldfish crackers because I didn't want to have to run to the store. :)

We thought it was great.  Used 90/10 ground beef and seasoned bread crumbs.  Diced the onions really fine (instead of sauteing them) and added a clove of garlic.  Doubled the sauce like the other reviewers said.  Delicious!

This is the only meatloaf I ever make because it is simply the best. I always saute the onions first. I also double the sauce. It is the best part!

Great basic recipe!  I jazz it up with other additions at times like chopped mushrooms, green pepper, jalapenos or bacon.  Depends on who I am serving it to.  i love the sauce on top!  five stars for the sauce, 4 stars for the meatloaf!  A keeper either way though!

Very easy recipe to follow. My 12 year old wanted to make a meal for her family and she was able to use this recipe without any help.   We used italian seasoning breadcrumbs and  I did suggest that we add a tablespoon of worshire sauce to the meat and doubling the ketchup in the sauce mixture.

This is really easy to make and my husband and toddler love it.  I don't eat meat so when my husband left for deployment I made this recipe but made 4 mini-loaves and froze them for later for my son.

I made this as written and feel it deserves only 3 stars for taste. We found it very bland and now I wish that I had followed the other reviewers' suggestions. However, I loved how easy is was to put together and it was very moist. The sauce gave the few bites of meatloaf great flavour, so I also recommend doubling the sauce. I will make this meatloaf again but with the recommendations made by other reviewers.

This was very good. The sauce is delicious.  I needed more sauce though, even after I doubled the sauce.  I'll do much more next time.

This meatloaf was perfect! It was very moist and delicious, I'm putting this recipe in my recipe box for sure. The only change I'm making is to the topping, it's too sweet for me but my husband loved it.

So I thought I messed up when I added all of the ingredients, even the sauce stuff, but it was actually really good. I added Worcester to the meat, sauteed the onions with some garlic.  I also added a few cups of fresh, chopped spinach to get some veggies in there.  I didnt have bread crumbs so I used Wheat Thins, ground them up first, instead.  I made additional sauce, ketchup, creole mustard, Worcester sauce, brown sugar, to actually put on top, about half way through cooking.  It cooked for around and hour and a half.  I also took the advice and put bread at the bottom of the pan to suck up some of the juicy fat.  The result was so good!  My people loved it.

No need to line or grease the pan, instead line bottom of pan with bread slices and then place the formed meatloaf on top.  It absorbs the grease while baking and after removing the meatloaf is easy to throw away and clean up.

I liked this recipe, especially the topping, who would have ever thought of putting mustard, ketchup and brown sugar on top. I am glad somebody did!!!
I would not have sauteed the onions, as I like a little crunchy in the meatloaf, will probably add celery as well.

i was looking for a meatloaf recipe that i could make that my boyfriend would eat. neither of our mothers ever made meatloaf, and some of the other recipes had some odd ingredients,so i decided this was the recipe to try. It was terrific, and not at all complicated. i'll be making this one again :)

I did like most of the people before me and followed there advice. Very good meatloaf. my roomate and I almost ate the whole thing in one sitting. I did make one change that I have not seen. I used dijon mustard instead of yellow. only reason is because it was I had. I did find that 1 hr was not long enough more like a hour and a half. Served with sauteed green beans in a lil butter and onion and garlic..

MAKE THIS TONIGHT!  Don't even waste your time with the other more complex meatloaf recipes lol!  I took previous advice:  followed recipe to letter, just doubled the topping sauce and added some worcestershire sauce to the meat.  It is great! I'm a newlywed and my hubby always requests this and then wants it for lunch!  An easy, super-delicious recipe that is filling, smells and tastes great!  Good stuff!

Very simple and easy to make. I added a little bbq sauce to the sauce mixture only to remove the tangy taste. Overall my son loved it so it's a keeper.

Meatloaf is still meatloaf. I just don't like it but hubby thought it was an excellent recipe. I did enjoy the topping - reminded me of my grandmothers. Left overs served with a side of gravy, which for me, makes everything made with groundbeef better.

Awesome recipe!  I've made this recipe a few times now so this time I made a few changes. 1) added green peppers 2)Italian bread crumbs 3) one heaping Tsp minced garlic 4) Mushrooms 5) I sauted the Mushrooms, Green Pepper, Onion & Garlic in butter and once they start to cook down I add 2 or 3 splashes of Worchestershire to the sauted veggies before adding to the meat. For the topping I used one Tbsp of Southwestern mustard instead of regular mustard. Even our picky eater likes it...

This recipe was excellent. Both my husband and son loved it.  I did change it up a bit, using some of the suggestions from the other ratings. I sauteed the onions in a little olive oil and garlic just for a few minutes until the onions were softened.  The topping was a little to sweet for my taste. So I doubled the mustard and ketchup but left the brown sugar the same. We haven't had Meatloaf for years.  This recipe is now back on the list.  Thank you!

This is a really good! I did do a few things different though. I used about 2 to 2 1/2 lbs of hamburger, since that's what was thawed. Then I followed the recipe except for these addtions; a few splashes of worcestershire sauce, green /red peppers, a little garlic salt, & a cup & 1/2 Italian bread crumbs, & last of all a baby food jar of sweet potatoes (that was to add a little extra veggies for my daughter ;)  It cooked for 2 hours @ 350

I absolutely love this recipe. I've made over and over and it's perfect every time. I followed the advice of previous reviews and added Worcestershire sauce, and Italian bread crumbs. I also added garlic powder,green bell pepper, and celery. I don't add the topping until about 10 to 15 min  of the end of bake time.

Great meatloaf recipe with lots of flavor. I added a packet of onion soup mix to the mixture. We did not like the topping however, too sweet. Next time will just use plain ketchup.

I was scared to make meat loaf because I remember that it was always so dry and gross when I was growing up. (sorry mom!) This was moist and wonderful and delicious! I will make this again! And my husband and 1 1/2 year old loved it! Thank you!

This was really easy to make. Not a huge onion fan so I used half of a red onion and I mixed garlic powder in addition to the salt and pepper. I love sweet so the topping was good. I am glad I looked this one up. Thanks :)

Why did mine come out mushy?? Looked at other recipes and looks like those didn't use as much liquid ingredients.

I really liked this recipe and it was a big hit with my husband too.  I always know when he really likes my recipe if he tells me he likes it immediately after his first bite.  With this recipe he said it was fantastic before I even realized he had taken a bite.  I did take the advise of other reviewers and sauteed the onions and add sauteed garlic.  I also added shredded carrots and used table water crackers.  I will most certainly use this recipe again.

I made a modified version of this recipe, adding a lot of Worcestershire sauce and several seasonings. I also used BBQ sauce instead (since I don't care for brown sugar). I used about 1/2 cup of toasted bread crumbs and one egg, and the 1 1/2 lbs. of meat held together just fine for me. I baked it at 350 for 1hr and 20 mins and it came out perfect... My boyfriend LOVED it! I personally am not a meatloaf fan and even I had two slices for dinner. I probably won't get to try the leftovers (because of the aforementioned boyfriend). I will definitely use this recipe again.

My three picky children LOVED this dish - it was quick and easy to make, had a little sweetness and zest and maintained its moistness.  I cooked it in a parchment lined pan and needed to add 7 minutes cooking time in my convection oven.

This is the best meatloaf recipe ever! Comes out great every time.  Ingredients are ones that I  most always have on hand. I do mix 1 lb. of ground beet with 1/2 lb. of ground pork. The two together add more flavor to the meatloaf.  If I can purchase a ground beef, pork and veal mixture it is even better.

I am by no means a chef.  This recipe was extremely easy and very quick prep time.  I actually made the meatloaf and put it in the fridge for a couple of hours until I needed to cook it.  I followed the directions and also made modifications based on other reviewers: I sauteed the onions in butter and made triple serving of the sauce.  Needless to say, it was a success.  Even my cousin who is a restaurant owner and never touches anything I make had seconds! Success!

Very good meatloaf.  It did not fall apart.  I did use 2 pounds of meat as I did not want to waste any that I had defrosted.  It was enjoyed by all.

This had a great taste.  I did not add salt or pepper, and nothing was missing.  Next time, I will reduce the onion as there was just too much for me.  I did saute the onion in some olive oil and garlic first, which added nicely.  I doubled the topping as suggested, but there was too much.  I ended up putting a layer in the middle of the loaf, which added nicely and made it moist, but there was still a heavy layer on top.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe to follow. I don't eat beef so I substituted in ground Turkey, which requires more breadcrumbs to the recipe because it forms more juice.

I have never been a huge fan of meatloaf when I make it for some reason.  This one was probably the best I've made.  The flavor was nice, but the texture was a little slimy on the edges and crumbly elsewhere.

My husband has asked that I throw out my other meatloaf recipe (formally his favorite).  This recipe is now "the one".  I only made a two small changes: I used ground turkey and, I had one pound of ground turkey so I adjusted the measurements for one pound instead of 1.5.

I'm not a big fan of meatloaf, but this was suprisingly good and easy to make. We like to add mixed veggies to the mix. Make sure your meat is completely thawed though, or it will be pink in the middle.

This was excellent and got great reviews from my family!  I doubled the recipe but there was still only 2 pieces left!  I used onion soup mix instead of chopped onions and I next time I will either cut the mustard out of topping or reduce it but otherwise it was soooooo good!  Thanks for the recipe!  I will use it always!

This was definitely super easy and AWESOME!  I added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, and dried basil leaves. Sauted onions with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Next time, I'll make more of the ketchup/mustard/brown sugar mixture for the topping.

This was very tasty!! Even my fussy husband liked it! The only change I would make is to add 1/2 cup of milk instead of a full cup. The texture was a little too soft for us.

This is a great and easy meatloaf recipe!  I used Ritz cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs and also added a packet of Ranch seasoning mix.  I only had a little ketchup, so I spread it VERY thin on the top.  Turned out wonderful! Just enough sweet and tang on top!

This meatloaf is not only easy to make, but is some of the best I have ever had, love it and will make often. I wasn't sure about the topping, but I am now it was incredible.

I tried this recipe following the additions made by ALC. I also used turkey instead of beef and it came out excellent. I will definitely be making this loaf again.

I keep coming back to this recipe for the sauce.  For the meatloaf, I just throw some stuff together but I love the sauce on top.  Much better than plain old catsup.

For years I have added chopped carrots, cheese, and or diced potatoes to my meatloaf with mixed results. This recipe is simple, straightforward, and simply delicious. NOW my family gobbles it up...even on leftovers night. Great recipe.

This made an excellent meatloaf. Me and my husband gobbled it up. We added half a can of Hunt's tomato sauce for meatloaf in the mixture and then poured the rest on top.  I can't wait to cook this again!

This was my first time making meatloaf and the recipe made it very simple. It was very moist but too moist... Maybe it's my oven type, I'm not sure, but it took me an hour and 40 minutes just to cook it to where it wasn't pink... It was personally a little bland for me, but still tasty nevertheless. Doubling the ketchup like others had suggested I think made it not cook as well. It kept soaking into the meat and the top layer would not cook. I eventually scraped off the majority of the ketchup mixture to get it to cook thoroughly along with upping the temperature to 400 degrees.

Pretty good. I used 80/20 beef because it was on sale. Had to remove some extra liquid fat after it was finished cooking. Was very tender, not dry as some other recipes. Like the sauce on top.

I'm sure the fact that I only had a pound of beef and didn't change the rest of the measurements led to why my meatloaf turned out like mush.  However, mush or not, there was NO TASTE whatsoever!  I think I'll go back to the drawing board for a recipe that includes some mega seasoning.

I have never cooked meatloaf before and came across this recipe and decided to try it. I liked that the recipe was not too complicated ingredient wise and preparation wise. I made the recipe as stated but I did add a little bit of worcestershire sauce to the meat. It turned out great. The only thing next time I would probably do different is putting in less onion. I chopped up 1 onion like the recipe said and it was a bit too much. Otherwise it turned out great for my first try at meatloaf!

This was such an easy recipe!  I sauteed the onion with garlic first, as someone suggested.  I put about a tablespoon of steak sauce in with the meat as well.  I also reduced the ketchup for the topping and added steak sauce.  But overall it was fantastic!  Oh, and as someone else suggested I served it with Paula Deen's cottage potatoes, OMG....fantastic!

Wonderful.  I added a dash of Worcestershire Sauce and Sautéd the onions with two cloves of garlic in 2 tablespoons of butter and reduced in 1/4 to 1/2 cup of dry sherry prior to adding to mixture.  Also reduced the milk by half.  Perfect for the cool evening.

Wonderfully moist, better than I expected. I took some pointers from the reviews I read and sauted the onions with a bit of garlic,made twice the amount of sauce with half the amount of brown sugar since i think ketchup is quite sweet. I added a bit of smoked paprika and a dash of cayenne pepper to the meat for a bit of spice. My whole family loved it, I will make it again for sure.

Wow... this was eazy and delicious!  I had several people ask me for the recipe.  I will definitely add it to my recipe box.  Only thing different I did was add some tomatoes/green chilies (1/2 can) and increased ground beef to 2 lbs.  I divided between 2 - 9x5 loaf pans and cooked for 1 hr 20 min.  ALSO, after cooking, I drained the excess fat off before serving.   Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Fantastic recipe - the simplest recipes are usually the best, in my opinion.  Like many other reviewers, I used a couple of the common modifications for this recipe.  I sauteed the onion with some butter and garlic, and added Worcestershire to the meat mix.  I also used quick oats and some seasoned salt instead of seasoned breadcrumbs, since my husband is sensitive to too much wheat.  It turned out beautifully.  Thumbs up!

This was DELICIOUS!! My husband and I have made it multiple times and absolutely love it. We did do one odd thing, however, which made this meatloaf a favorite for us. Not reading the directions properly, we put the ingredients for the sauce inside the meatloaf itself and WOW. It makes it tangy and great for leftovers, as it's so moist. We also added a cup of carrots, a cup of celery, two tablespoons of chives and a clove of garlic to make it more to our taste. Give this recipe a try, you won't regret it!

Great tasting meat loaf! Very easy to prepare! We used elk meat instead of beef and added some bbq sauce into the mixture as well. As stated by previous reviews we went easy on the break crumbs. One thing we had a little issue with was that after 1 hour of cook time the meat was still pretty rare so we cooked it for another 20-30 min and it was perfect! Probably do to the fact that we used 2lbs of meat instead of 1.5

Super quick, super easy and the family loved it.  I was a bit skeptical about the ketchup and mustard mix but it changes in the oven with the brown sugar in it.   Instead of bread crumbs I used garlic and butter flavored croutons I had in my pantry and in addition I crumbled up some crackers (just to break up the beaf).  The flavored croutons added garlic flavor which was yummy.  I'm glad I made a double recipe!

This is a great and simple meatloaf recipe that my husband and I love. The sauce is delicious, tangy but not too much. My only change is instead of breadcrumbs I added in cheezits - the smokey cheese flavor really went well with the tangy sauce.

Great recipe! I also added a finely chopped dill pickle to the mix. It was the best tasting meatloaf I have ever eaten.

This meatloaf tasted SO good! I followed the advice of previous users and sautéed the onions with garlic (and I also added about a pinch of dried thyme) for 8-10 minutes. I used Italian breadcrumbs, and I used only 1 tbsp of mustard for the sauce. Yummy! I did have to cook this about 25-30 minutes longer than the recipe called for, but that is my only complaint.  This is a very easy recipe and it tastes wonderful!

Wow... Very very yummy! The measuring system here is a little different though with the metric and US calculations changing 110g of bread crumbs Which is about 2 cups to only 1 cup in the US version which confused me.... It still came out good though! (I had already put in the 110 grams) I thought it was gorgeous but you have to get over the mustard smell hitting you as you open the oven ;) I was pleasantly surprised.

I have very picky eaters.  They loved this, asked for left overs the next night.  Followed the recipe exactly except made double sauce.  May make a bit less sauce next time - but the recipe itself is great.

This got thumbs up from everyone. The changes I made were just personal preference: mixed ground beef and ground turkey; used Italian seasoned bread crumbs; added 1 can of diced tomatos; baked in muffin tins. The sauce was delicious.

absolutely great tasting and very simple to make.  I loved the sauce (next time I will make an extra batch to pour as a condiment).  I took the advice of others to lessen the mustard and increase the ketchup.  I had no brown sugar on hand so I used 2 tbs of white sugar and 2 tsp of molasses.  I also sauteed the onions and I also served them with Paula Deen's cottage potatoes.  This was an awesome meal! Thanks

This recipe is great! The only change I made was I used italian style croutons instead of bread crumbs. It really added the perfect seasoning.

I am not usually a meatloaf fan, but my husband is. This recipe with the given amendments was very moist and flavorful!  I gave it a 4 because there was a LOT of excess juice even after letting it rest for 10 minutes.  But we will probably make again.

Awesome recipe! It is now the base for all future meatloaves. I stuck close to the recipe with a few minor changes: Italian Seasoned bread-crumbs, a hefty dash of Oregano, and mixed in a cup of cheddar cheese.

I dont know what I did wrong but when I tried this recipe, it was extrememly soggy. The meatloaf was basically floating away in juice. I actually had to pour some of it out. My boyfriend still liked it though. Maybe if I try a leaner hamburger it may fair better.

Love this recipe. so easy and quick. I wasn't a big meat loaf fan...Until now :) The great thing about this recipe is that the ingredients list is stuff you would normally have in your pantry already. I made my own bread crumbs and usually pass on the onion. I make this once every two weeks now. This is a family favorite.

My fiance and I thought this was a delicious recipe. I stuck pretty close to the original recipe; I had an extra lb of ground beef I needed to use so I just added more bread crumbs (I used the italian seasoned kind), 1 extra egg, a little more milk until I had the right  consistency, an additional 1/4 cup or so of chopped onion (which I sauteed in butter first) and 2 tbsp of worcestershire.  I ended up with enough for 2 loaves and it took about 1 hour, 55 minutes to bake them both together.   I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and sweet corn and it was so good! My son, who doesn't really like most meats, even enjoyed it.   I was skeptical about the sauce but decided to try it anyway and I wasn't disappointed. The only thing I did differently with the sauce was to pour it over the loaves after the first hour of baking. I was worried it might burn. As it was, it carmelized perfectly so my theory is that if I'd poured it on from the start it may have burned but I'm not sure.   Overall, it was an excellent recipe and I'll be making this again often. Thank you!

Great recipe, I would recommend mincing the onions very small, instead of a coarse chop.  My husband and toddler both loved it.

I used this recipes on a few occassions and my diners always raved about it. It is actually my husbands favorite. I Follow the recipe almost exactly only I add a teaspoon of worst. sauceto the mixture. I also use two eggs and a little more milk or the meatloaf is dry. I dont use mustard in my topping, and I use half of the topping before baking and then add a little more after.

Followed advice of others and added worcestershire, also added a meatloaf seasoning packet in place of salt and pepper.  Decreased mustard to 1 TBSP, and added a little extra ketchup. Loved it!

This was delicious!  And so easy!  I have NEVER been able to make an edible meatloaf for some reason.  They just never turned out.  And this one turned out great.  The only thing I added was a bit of Bullseye BBQ Sauce on top instead of the ketchup mixture because everyone in my house LOVES it.

This meatloaf was too sweet and lacked the tomato flavor that meatloaf is known for. The corn syrup used in Ketchup, plus the 2T brown sugar masked the tomato flavor and made it just too sweet for my taste.

It Was A Very Good Recipe. I Didnt Use The Sauce Over Top and It Was Still Yummy. I Would Have Either Made The Onion Pieces Small Or Cooked Them A Little Before I Put Them In The Loaf. But All In All It Was A Easy and Delicious Recipe!

My family loves this recipe.  I triple the sauce mix, add 1/2 lb more ground beef, and make two shallow loaves instead of one.  That way we get a taste of the tangy sauce in every bite.  I also brown onions first, use Italian bread crumbs, omit the salt and pepper and use less milk than called for.

4 out of 5 for 2 reasons: too much milk and not enough flavor. However with the easy additions of a little celery, some green pepper and garlic, a little less milk, this was easy and delish. And the topping was YUMMMMOOO! Totally seals the deal. Hubby ate till he had a bellyache!

Delicious - and I usually despise meatloaf. Definitely use the Italian seasoned bread crumbs and reduce the mustard, double the ketchup. We also added ketchup to the meat for flavor and fried the onion in a little butter before adding. So moist and and light - not heavy feeling. My two year old loved it - a definite bonus.

Not having the ingredients I needed to make my usual meatloaf, I came on here to find something different, but easy. After seeing 801 people have  reviewed this, and the majority of them were good, I decided to make it. I did saute the onion and a yellow bell pepper in a little butter to gaurentee softness and I only used 1 Tablespoon of mustard in the sauce, but I had to double the sauce to cover it all. It was awesome, and I think I'm going to use the sauce on chicken next time my husband bbqs..thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This is a pretty typical meatloaf- nothing special.  My husband liked it, but he just likes meatloaf in general.  I'm not a huge meatloaf fan and thought it was standard.  The glaze is as good as plain ketchup.

I used this recipe as a guide. I had more meat so I eyeballed all the other ingredients. I sautted onions and garlic. I used season bread crumbs and panko (since i ran out of seasoned), I doubled the sauce and used classic yellow and dijon mustards. IT WAS AWESOME, and I'm not a fan of meatloaf and my kids enjoyed it so that was a plus!

As a grad student who can't help but play mother to her roommates this recipe has become a staple to make in the morning and have ready to toss in the oven after work/class. I've combined the reviewer recs (tbs worcestershire sauce to the meat, fry up the onions with a little garlic, double the sauce, seasoned bread crumbs) with a few little things of my own. Halving the ketchup in the sauce with tomato paste gives it a bit of a tang and since for some reason we seem to have honey mustard in the fridge more than regular old hotdog grade stuff I've taken to using that - it just adds something a little extra. And bacon, there must be bacon on top of a meatloaf if you have it lying around - layer of sauce, a few strips of bacon, and another layer of sauce. After over a year of making this I've even gotten my mother to swap it out with grandma's recipe from her childhood! Thanks!

I am not a huge fan of meatloaf, but this recipe was so good! I bought the meatloaf mix that they sell at the store (beef, pork and turkey). I sauteed the onion first and added a little less milk to the meat mixture. I also followed the advice of others and added some worcestershire sauce to the meat before baking. I let the meatloaf sit out for about 5 minutes before cutting. This meatloaf is better than mom's.

Great Meatloaf!  I used 2 lbs. of meat; substituted half a cup of hot salsa for half a cup of the milk; added minced garlic; and added a tsp. of Worchester sauce to the meat  and the sauce.  My guests could not stop eating!  I doubled the sauce mixture but would have had enough if I did one and a half times.  We still have plenty left for some cold meatloaf sandwiches we all love!  My guests asked for the recipe. Want a pretty sliced meatloaf?  I add a hard-boiled egg or two, forming the meatloaf around them.  When you slice it you will have meatloaf with a slice of egg in the middle.  Tastes good and the kids love it.  Make sure you let the meatloaf set for about 15-20 minutes before you slice it so it gets firmer.

I made this recipe with a few modifications & OH MY~~it was THE best meatloaf ever.  I reduced the milk to 3/4 C, I used 1 1/2 C of seasoned bread crumbs, 1 TBS Worcestershire Sauce, 1 tsp cayenne pepper & sauteed the onions as well as 2 TBS minced garlic & 1 large bellpepper in butter before adding it to the meat mixture. For the topping I ditched the ketchup & used 1/2 C honey barbeque sauce with the mustard/brown sugar (& will probably go to 3/4 C BBQ sauce next time I make this) I lined my loaf pan with tin foi for easy clean-up & cooked for 1 hr 40 minutes, transferred to a serving platter & let stand 10 minutes before slicing.  There were NO left-overs; wish I had doubled the recipe.

My family LOVED this. Even my super picky 2 year old and our picky room mate. The only thing I did different was use home made bread crumbs (2 slices of toasted bread and Morton Reduced Sodium Nature's Season) instead of store bought.. and I didn't have brown sugar  for the topping so I thought back to a meatball recipe I made that called for jelly/jam and used a little strawberry jelly (probably about 1 tablespoon.) and Worcestershire sauce (about a teaspoon). Everyone loved it.  I was told if I didn't make this again, I was being evicted. Superb!

This meatloaf is the absolute best. I won't use another recipe. The topping is wonderful, much better than plain ol' ketchup. I made as directed and didn't stray from the recipe- it is outstanding. My hubby asks for it constantly!

Excellent, easy meatloaf.  I used 1 lb of ground chuck and 1 lb of ground pork.  It took a bit longer to cook but was so moist and tender.  Will definatly make again. Outstanding and easy to make

My husband was so excited about this meatloaf that he told his mom about it - that's saying a lot. I doubled the sauce on top like the reviews suggested - however, I didn't measure the second batch and it was pretty sweet (more brown sugar, no more mustard, and not as much ketchup) but that was part of why he liked it so much, apparently. Didn't have onions, but must have them next time!

I made this meatloaf tonight and i tweeked it a little. I used tomatoe paste and ketchup instead of brown sugar and mustard and ketchup, it came out wonderfully it was thick and stayed in place. I also used lipton onion mix instead of an onion and it also tasted wonderful. I put the meatloaf in a cupcake pan to make it interesting for my kids and they loved it. I rate this meatloaf a 5 it's esy and it tastes good, it's not to overpowering and the meatloaf stays together.... you should try it!

I took the advise from other reviews and sauteed the onion with a bit of garlic and added a tbsp of Worcestershire Sauce too. I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain. As Meatloaf can sometimes be dry, I mixed the bread crumbs with the milk and let it sit for a couple of minutes before adding it to the meat mixture. This will always give you a moist meatloaf!!!! All-inall this recipe was OK. My boyfriend and I both thought  the meat itself was very bland. You definitely have to double the sauce mixure!!!

I thought the recipe was average. The texture was good but it definitely need more doctoring up. I added some garlic and worchestire sauce but it still was lacking some flavor. I wouldn't say it's a bad recipe but not out of this world.

This recipe is absolutely delicious and so easy to make! I had never made meatloaf before and heard that everyone messes it up on their 1st try. But, it came out great and my husband said it was the best meatloaf he had ever had. I did make a few small changes. I didn't notice that the recipe called for a pound and a half of ground beef and only bought a pound. To make up for this I only used 2/3 a cup of milk and bread crumbs instead of the full cup. Also, instead of using salt and pepper to taste I used a half a pack of meatloaf seasoning. This meatloaf was great and absolutley amazing!!

This is a great meatloaf recipe; I haven't yet tried one with milk added, but I did so for this one, and it turned out great.  I also added mushrooms (chopped quite small).  I personally did not like the sauce topping, and would stick with a tomatoe based sauce/topping.

Only thing i changed is that i added green pepper and used onion powder instead of real onion b/c my brother is a picky eater and used tomato sauce instead of ketchup in the glaze. when cooking i left it in the oven for about an hour and 20 mins.  also recommend making extra sauce to have on the side, it is a delicious addition to the meal! thanks for the recipe!

This was good.  Topping did the trick.  It was moist, filling, and tasty.  Great way to use up leftovers in the fridge.

The sauce on top separates this from other meatloaf recipes. Not a big mustard fan, so I used about one T. of mustard and added a little bit of cream of balsamic. I would recommend spreading more sauce on top of the meatloaf than the recipe calls for. Did I mention I like the sauce on this meatloaf?

Fantastic! I did cook the onions before adding them to the meat. I don't care for crunchy onions in my meatloaf. I also added a few dashes of worchestier sauce. This meatloaf is better than the onion soup kind I normally make. I did think the ketchup sauce on top was far far too sweet! I think ketchup is sweet  enough, the brown sugar isn't necessary at all. Besides that, this meatloaf was perfect

This was an ok recipe. It got rave reviews from my boyfriend but I wasn't impressed. I used ground turkey instead of beef, and didn't have an onion so I used 1 teaspoon of onion powder. I may try it again w/ an onion if requested.

Last time I tried meat loaf I HATED it!!! I had a request to make it though and used this recipe...boy am I glad I did!!! SO tasty! I tossed a little A-1sauce and shredded cheese in the meat mixture, and used ritz crackers (didn't have bread crumbs)...but other then that followed the recipe! This is a definite keeper!

I've been fixing the sweet-n-sour meatloaf recipe for years now, but decided to try something different for dinner. The whole family raved how good it was.  This will be my new recipe.  I did use a little less mustard and a little more ketchup in the sauce.  My meatloaf also took 2 hrs to finish cooking, I've never had one done at 1 hr!

I really hate it when people comment on the recipe, then CHANGE 75% of it.  I'm commenting on the ORIGINAL recipe and I absolutely LOVE the ketchup/mustard/brown sugar "gravy".  I did feel an entire onion was too much for me.  Next time I'll go with scallions or maybe fresh chives.  Regardless, thanks for sharing an easy stand-by.

This was very good, but I actually found it to be a little too soft for my preference.  It was really moist and tender, but it was so tender that I couldn't get one single piece out without it falling into a couple of pieces.  I think I'll use fewer bread crumbs next time.  After reading several reviews, I used chili sauce instead of ketchup because it's very similar to ketchup but it's less sweet.  I also used a spicy brown mustard instead of a plain yellow one.  As other reviewers suggested, I sauted the onion (and cooled it) before adding to the beef mixture.  I also added a grated garlic cloves and half a red pepper to the mixture.  Very good.

Best recipe so far I have tried for meatloaf. Only thing different i did was saute onions in butter along with minced garlic, and adding 1 Tbsp. of worcestershire sauce to the meat mix. Family loves this one very moist and it is quick and easy to make.

Mine Turned Out really Moist which Everyone really liked. As apposed to Beef I used Ground turkey which is good but you have to remove the fat, I also didn't make the sauce but took it out ten minutes before it's done and put ketchup on the top.

This recipe turned out pretty good.  I did add Worcestershire sauce and doubled up on the ketchup & mustard (but not the sugar).  I didn't have bread crumbs so I used a package of stove top stuffing!  I'll definitely make this again and next time I'll saute the onions.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe, it was excellent. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added Worcestershire sauce, the only thing I would do differently next time is double the sauce mixture and put some on the bottom or even mix it right into the meat. but there will definitely be a next time!

I was quite impressed with this recipe. Im not a meatloaf fan persay, but my husband suggested it for something different and decided to give it a try. I didn't have any breadcrumbs with spice, so I added just the normal italian spices. I also did what everyone suggested and sauteed the onions and garlic and some chopped mushrooms for a little bit, but only with a tsp of butter. I was nervous about 1 cup of milk, cause I've never heard or putting milk in it, and then making blend...but it worked!  Also I didn't have the worshsture sauce, so I added a few drops of hot sauce.  Also with the topping I ran out of ketchup so I added bbq sauce.  I thought it was awesome!  Thanks for sharing this recipe...it was VERY moist, which is a nice change from my dry meatloaf!

This recipe is excellent! It is so flavorful and tender.  ***The only thing I would change is cutting the brown sugar in half at least. It was too sweet for me for a dinner dish.*** I followed other reviewers suggestions and sauted the onions in butter and chopped garlic ,added Worcestershire sauce, and doubled the ketchup.

Great base recipe. I scaled up the recipe for 20 servings because we like leftovers! You'll have to scale the recipe up to 20 servings for my below changes to make sense. I used 4lbs of ground chuck and formed it in to 2 seperate loaves in a 13 X 9 baking dish and cooked for 1.5 hours at 350 then let rest for 15 minutes. Here is what I changed. I used 2 packets of onion soup mix instead of onions. I used no salt or pepper. I used no worceshire as other suggested. Instead of doubling the ketchup as other suggested I added 3/4 cup barbecue sauce. I halved the brown sugar. I subsituted bulgar wheat for half the bread crumbs. My wife said it was the best meatloaf she's eaten!

This is a great basic recipe and so versatile! Since it is always so hard to eat enough veggies I incorporated one can (drained) of no salt added mixed veggies into the mix and baked as directed... fabulous! And my husband didn't even realize the extra veggies were in there! Will definitely make again.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a hit! I took the advice of some reviewers, sauteed the onions and used seasoned bread crumbs. Delicious and easy to make! I will definitely make this again.

This is a super easy meatloaf recipe. I do agree that the topping could be doubled. I didn't feel like there was enough. This meatloaf is stellar for the amount of work it involves. I will use it again when I am in the mood for an easy and tasty meal!

This was an easy but very tasty way to make meatloaf.  I also substituted the beef for turkey and sauteed the onion in garlic and butter.  I used Dale's steak seasoning because that is what we had in the refrigerator and it was great!  My two year old picky eater even had seconds! I was honestly a bit worried about the topping because it was a first for me but I was pleasantly surprised.

This is a staple in our house every week. I always have the ingredients on hand, so it's easy. At least one of my kids asks for it EVERY week. I do add a little worchestershire in it just for a little extra flavor. Amazing!!

I've used this with both turkey and beef. Tonight I made a meatloaf w/ ground beef. I was out of bread crumbs and used a combo of oatmeal and crushed wheat crackers. Once I read the ingredients for the 'sauce' I decided to just use a few squirts of ketchup and a few squirts of bbq sauce along with a couple of splashes of worcestershire sauce...I didn't want it as a topping so I mixed it it. I started the 1 1/2 lb. meatloaf at about 425 for about 15 minutes and then 350 for the remaining hour so it cooked for an hour and fifteen and then I let it rest for about 15 minutes. It was moist and flavorful. Really liked the combo of the bbq sauce and ketcup...lots of flavor w/ out being overpowering.

I might not have done something right, but when I made this recipe the meat did not bind very well and just fell apart in crumbles everywhere. :(

First meatloaf ever and it was a HUGE hit. I wanted something I could make from what I had around the house, and this was *it!* I didn't measure everything out, sort of eyeballed it and it was still fantastic! I did brown the onions in olive oil with garlic and added at least 1 tb of worsteicher sauce to the meat. Also used hot mustard in the sauce, adding more worsteicher to that. I made about the same amount of sauce and it was great. I will make this again and again! Goes great with steamed cauliflower and baked potatoes. *runs off to eat her leftover meatloaf sandwich for lunch*

I'm not much of a cook and have never made meatloaf before. But I decided to give this a try. It is super easy and the family loved it. Everyone asked for seconds. I doubled the topping and added Worchestershire Sauce. I'll definitely make this again.

I enjoyed this,did add extra seasoning.One tip,if cooking a larger amount use more than one pan or wider pan,using a deeper pan will require ALOT longer cooking time.One more thing for hunters,great way to use up all that ground venison.

I finally got my husband to say "wow this meatloaf is really good!" He pretends he doesn't like meatloaf but he finally admitted this was a good recipe! The glaze on top was great--i did double it. Inside I added more seasonings--italian seasonings, s&p, etc, as well as diced green bell pepper. Definitely will make this again!

Great meatloaf, although a tad bland if you don't make changes. Saute the onion with a clove or two of garlic, use seasoned breadcrumbs, and add a tsp. or two of soy sauce. I also used soy milk instead of regular. With these changes we loved it! I'm on a diet that doesn't allow me to mix carbs and proteins, so I made a small part of the meatloaf without the breadcrumbs and the brown sugar and it was also delicious.

Love it. I make this with turkey instead of beef, because I don't eat red meat, and it's wonderful. I also took the advice of others and sauteed the onions before adding into the mix as well as adding a bit of Worcestershire sauce (which really helps the ground turkey, even moreso than it would help ground beef), but aside from those tweaks I follow the recipe to a T, it comes out great every time.

A good simple meatloaf. It was very easy for my first time making meatloaf! The flavor was alright, but a bit plain. I think I'll add more spices next time. I liked the glaze though!

This meatloaf is excellent & for my husband to comment on it, you have done a great job. I followed some others advice about less milk and I actually only used 2/3 cup ketchup with the mustard and brown sugar & it suited me just fine. Thank you Janet this is a keeper!!

Mom's been making this recipe since the 50's.  It's from Betty Crocker or BH&G, her most used books.  For a treat for us kids, she cut chunks of cheddar cheese and put them the middle of the loaf so there was a cheesey treat in the center of each slice.  Still a fave comfort food for me! (and yeah, great sandwiches the next day)

this was quite yummy... very moist. i used 2/3 beef and 1/3 pork and grated the onion. i also doubled the sauce but  lessened the mustard as per another review. very easy but it took about 1 hour 20 mins to reach an internal temp of 165 degrees.

Ok i just made this and it was way gross. I did substitute ground beef for ground turkey, but i really don't think that was the big issue. the whole thing turned out watery and mushy and generally just disgusting. i had to cook it for an extra 45 minutes, and took it out and poured out the extra juice about 1:10 min. in to baking and it was still mushy. the flavor of the loaf itself was tolerable, but i found that brown sugar-ketchup topping to be unforgivable.   Will not be making this again, sadly. I was really hoping this would be a nice, standard meatloaf i could add to my repertoire.

This was delicious even the next day! This is definitly a keeper. I also sauted the onions with minced fresh garlic in olive oil, used Italian Herb Seasoning. The only thing that I'll probably change next time is use 1 tlbs of brown sugar instead of 2 because the top tasted a bite sweet to me. The rest of the family didn't complain not a bit.

It was very good i was impressed made some minor changes. I used 2 1/2 lbs. of meat and sauteed the onions in a little olive oil and fresh minced garlic till they were soft, i used 1 cup of seasoned breadcrumbs, 1 cup of mile, 1 egg. I made the sauce with 1 cup of Ketchup, 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, and 2 tablespoons of deli mustard and whisked it together. Cooked at 400 degrees for about an hour.. YUMMY!

This may not be the best meatloaf I've ever tried, but it's a very close second. I give it 5 stars because it is so yummy and the EASIEST!!! My only change is using ground turkey; it's a perfect match with the brown sugar sauce. I've made this many times & do like using sauteed onions. My family loves this with oven baked sweet potato wedges. Thank you for this wonderful, time-saving recipe.

My changes to this basic recipe: 2 lbs. grnd. chuck; 3/4 c quick oats; 1/2 c catsup; 1/4 c milk; 2 eggs; 1 Tbls. horseradish.  Topping= 1/2 c catsup; 1 Tbls. horsradish; 3 tabls. brown sugar; 2 tsp. mustard.  So really the oatmeal and the horseradish are the major difference. Horseradish is the secret ingredient to give it a great, different flavor. Honestly, I tried meatloaf recipes for years and this is the very best one I've found!

Easy and delicious! I made it a little differently. I added all ingredients into a bowl and with hands mixed them all together. I also added one more egg and 1 tablespoon of worchestershire sauce and used 1 pound of pork and one pound of leand ground beef. I suggest you pour off any hot grease before serving. I also used an 8 X 8 glass dish. Yummy. Thanks allrecipies!

This was very good and very easy! Next time, I would chop up a green pepper and put it in the meat. I never ate meatloaf with ketchup on the top, but I tried it anyway. Although it gave it a nice, sweet kick, I would not put the ketchup mixture on top again. Instead, I would serve with beef gravy and mashed potatoes, but that's just me!

I have never made a meatloaf with milk, so I was skeptical. I added some worcestershire and crumbled some French's fried onions in the mixture. I just topped with ketchup. I also used deer meat and it was great! Will definitely be making this again!!

I sauteed the onions first because I hate crunchy things in dishes that aren't supposed to crunch (meatloaf, deviled eggs, tuna salad, etc.). I added a teaspoon or so of Worcestershire, a handful of grated cheddar cheese, and a pinch of dry mustard to the meat mixture. But it would've been delightful without my alterations. So, five stars. I'm stuffed!

Great! Like some other cooks, I browned the diced onion along with garlic, mushrooms, Italian parsley. I added Worchestershire to the meat and cut down a little on the bread crumbs (I used seasoned) and milk. For the topping, I used 2/3 cup ketsup, 1 Tbsp brown sugar and about 2 Tbsp Mezzetta "zesty" bell pepper relish, and the result was perfect - not too sweet. My fiance loved it, and I can't wait to have the leftovers in sandwiches today. I'm giving just 4 stars since I changed up the recipe but will definitely make again.

Excellent with ground turkey too!  I sauteed the onion with some chopped garlic in olive oil.  While that sauteed, I added milk, egg and 1 T Worchester sauce to breadcrumbs and let absorb. Doubled ketchup to the 2 T brown sugar and 2 T mustard, and cooked loaf exactly one hour.  Super moist with a great flavor.  This is our family's new meatloaf recipe.

This was GRRREEEAAAT meatloaf.  I didn't have regular bread crumbs so I used pepperidge farms seasoned stuffing mix.  Worked Great.  Also, I used worchester sauce, minced garlic, and jalapeno jack cheese in the meat loaf and sauce.  One last thing I added was 1/3 cup of rotel tomato.  It was all good.  YUMMMMMMMMY

Terrific recipe for those of us who want traditional meatloaf. I don't make meatloaf often but when I do, my family wants it basic. They even like this better than my mothers which has ketchup or chili sauce on top. This is a very moist and flavorful meatloaf recipe which lends itself to tweak to individual tastes.  Thank you for posting.

Perhaps I ruined it by using the traditional meatloaf blend of beef, pork and veal.  I couldn't eat mine and my daughter would not eat hers.  Sorry

Having never made a meatloaf before, I was drawn to this "no-fail" recipe. I followed it almost exactly, except I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs because that's what we had on hand. I made this for my very opinionated father in law and was shocked to hear him say that this was the 2nd best meatloaf he'd ever had!! Thank you to the creator of this recipe for such an easy, tasty meal!

WOW!!! I have made alot of versions of meatloaf and this is by far the BEST!! I made a few changes...instead of bread crumbs I used crushed ritz crackers and I used half of the milk (I like my meatloaf firm). Thanks for the recipe this will be my meatloaf choice from now on.

Great recipe and easy to make.  As others have recommended, I also added Worcestershire sauce and increased the ketchup.  However, the mustard flavor did not bother me, so I left that the same.

I have a bigger family and doubled the recipe. I added garlic powder and 1 tbs of Worcestershire sauce (2 tbs if doubling) and changed the mustard to half yellow mustard and half spicy brown mustard. It offset the sweet of the brown sugar. (don't forget to double the topping if doubling recipe). It had to cook for an hour and a half. We even added a little more ketchup on the plate to dip the meatloaf in. I like meatloaf a lot but I've never made it before. This recipe was fairly quick and easy which is right up my alley! It came out great and we had leftovers!

I've made this meatloaf several times and my review is based on the meatloaf only.  I do not like anything sweet so just used tomato sauce for the topping.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs and added a little garlic powder and a couple dashes of worcestershire sauce.  There are never any leftovers.

I thought this was terrible. It came out very mushy and I cooked it an extra 45 min.  My husband didn't think it was bad but I had to smother my serving in ketchup.  Won't be making this again.

excellent meatloaf.  I had already thawed two pounds of ground turkey, so I increased the recipe slightly by using two eggs and a rounded cup of bread crumbs to get the right consistency.  Did not increase the brown sugar/ mustard/ketchup topping, as it was enough to cover.  I baked it in a slightly oversized (5 1/2 x 9 3/4) bread pan in my convection oven for 45 minutes and it came out just right.

I was never a meatloaf fan but this recipe changed my mind.  I only left out the onions and mustard and both my son and I LOVED it.  This will definately be on our table again.

This was pretty good. I would def recommend grilling the onions first.  I also added mushrooms and garlic to the onion mixture.

This was an incredibly easy recipe, but I found that an entire onion was too much. Next time, I'll use half. I also added some barbecue sauce to the meat which kept the meat from getting dry.

Very good, my new meatloaf recipe.  I used 2 eggs and extra bread crumbs since I didn't have lean ground beef and I didn't have a problem with having to drain off any grease.  I also made the sauce with only 1 tablespoon brown sugar and it was plenty sweet for us.  The whole family loved it!

This is my usual recipe that I really like.  Most recently I mixed salsa and cranberries for a different sauce on top.  I still used the basic recipe, just changed the topping for variety.

There are so many meatloaf recipes out there it's hard to choose.  You can't go wrong with this one.  I've made it twice and have gotten excellent reviews from my family.  I was just eating a leftover piece of it as I was writing this review and I think it's even better left over!  Next time I will double the sauce recipes as many others have stated here.  Also, I reduced the milk a tiny bit and added a Tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.  Don't forget to saute the onions first!

Very good.  Will definately make this again, the texture is perfect.  But there is something about it that I don't care for, I think it might be the dried bread crumbs.  I did use seasoned bread crumbs, but don't think the seasoning is the problem.  I think I might try the same recipe with something else, like cracker crumbs, or real bread crumbs and see how it works.

Sorry, we did not care for this.  It turned out gooey & bland...maybe I should have kept baking it beyond an hour???  I'm sticking to the Brown Sugar Meatloaf recipe from this site.

excellent - with modifications (I made it the original way the first time and it was good but a tad bland for us) Sauteed the onion and garlic with small diced carrots. Used 2 lbs lean ground sirloin/chuck mix and 2 eggs. 1 1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs.  Added Emeril's steak seasoning, and anout 2 TBS each of Paul Newman's Steak Sauce and Worschester.  Dash of oregano. Instead of the glaze I used BBQ sauce. Everything else stayed the same. It was FANTASTIC. Served with the Italian Peas from this site.  Thanks for a good base recipe!

To me, it's hard to make a bad meatloaf, although I suppose plenty have tried. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added garlic, oregano, parsley and worchestershire sauce. I did not, however, find it too wet when finally all well mixed. The sauce on top was a little too sweet for me, but not enough to ruin this dish. I think a good alternative would be to use hoisin sauce instead of the sugar to add a little more tang and little less sweet.

Funny story about this meatloaf...I made it last night when I got home from work, using cheap, fatty ground beef that was on sale.  When it was done cooking, the loaf was literally floating in grease.  I tilted the pan over my sink, and holding the meatloaf in with a spatula, proceeded to drain the liquid....along with the ENTIRE meatloaf...into a dirty, soapy sink.  I was devastated!  I made it again tonight using lean ground chuck and it made ALL the difference in the world.  No draining necessary!  This recipe is everything I expect a meatloaf to be.  I think it is even better than my mom's (but I would never tell her that!).  The only thing I will do differently is maybe make a bit more of the ketchup mixture/topping.  Other than that, this is the perfect meatloaf recipe!

I did make some adjustments but this was still very BLAND... Not sure how it got so many rave reviews. I added worcestershire to the meat mixture and rather than onions used crushed fried onions from a can... I did use a different topping my own recipe (ketchup, brown sugar, dry mustard and some nutmeg) and even mixed some in the meat mix and STILL the meat was bland and not anything special. All in all if you have to try something and you have all the ingredients try it out... But if you want something great then find another recipe!

I thought this one was incredibly good.  I did add about 1 Tbs. of Worcestershire sauce, 2 tsp. garlic powder, and 1 tsp. of crushed red pepper.   I also used 2 Tbs. of instant minced onion in place of the fresh onion as I was short on time.  Still, I was impressed!

We had high expectations based on the reviews but were very disapointed. We will not make this again as we have used much better recipes. If I were to make it again I would cut the onions by half, add worchester, maybe italian seasoning and increase the cooking time about 10-20 minutes. I think there are much better recipes that wouldn't require the same degree of adjustments.

Very good and moist, I only used 1 lb of beef, (all I had) and seasoned bread crumbs. And I ommited the ketchup topping, (DH doesnt like the sweet topping. Instead I used the drippings from the meat loaf to make gravy, and poored that over meat loaf.

absolutely delicious and so easy to make with ingredients that are usually on hand! It took about 1 hour 15 mins to bake through. Made the house smell sooo good! It came out really moist and flavorful. I was worried, cuz I had tried meatloaf before, and nobody liked it, so I thought we are just not 'meatloaf people'lol, but that recipe is the best I've tried! Tastes even better with bread, cuz it's so moist.

Ive been making this recipe 3 years now and its one of my favorites! When I made this recipe everyone moaned at the sound of "meatloaf" but after the first bite they were hooked. I now have to make 2 batches when i make this recipe as there is never enough. I never add all of the milk, i add half and see if i need the rest later. I use minced onions as we never have regular onions in the house. I also used 7 grain bread that was toasted then grated in place of bread crumbs. It gives it a great texture and taste. You can always substitute and add more for the consistency you want. Where the guy got soup on one of the other reviews i dont know. LOL! I always double the sauce but i use spicy mustard thats already prepared(i also squirt a tablespoon in the meatloaf mixture), the brown sugar sauce gives it a great flavor. My family loves it!

The name says it all, easy!  A couple of changes - used 2 pieces of whole wheat bread instead of the bread crumbs, used dijon mustard instead of regular yellow and used about 3/4 cup milk.  I saw that other reviewers sautéed the onion before but I just diced mine pretty small and it was fine.  Next time I'll add some garlic and try the bread under the loaf trick because it did get fairly greasy.  My boyfriend was a big fan as was I.  I will definitely be making this again.

Revised! And the second time was better...  I initially gave this 4.5 stars and substituted herb-seasoned stuffing and evaporated milk for the bread and milk, used 1 lb. of ground turkey, added 1T. worcestershire sauce, and reduced the onion by half. But after Round 2, I now give it 5 stars by leaving the recipe virtually intact. I used turkey again (personal preference) and because I had no bread, 1 c. of store-brand dry (unprepared) stove-top stuffing instead. I used one whole onion and did *not* saute the onions this time.  SO MUCH BETTER. Yay!

Not the best I've ever had, but passable. I tweaked it by adding 1 T of my dried Italian spices.

This is a wonderful meatloaf recipe.  I was never a huge fan of the dish, but now find myself making this every couple of weeks.  The meatloaf itself is very moist with good flavor, and the glaze makes a perfect finish.  Thanks for this recipe...it's now one of my hubby's favorite's. :)

This is just what I was looking for.  I did change the sauce on top a little.  This is what I used:
2 Tablespoons Brown Sugar
1 teas. yellow mustard

This is a great basic meatloaf. Exactly what I was looking for. Quick and easy to prepare and it came out perfect. Used leanest ground beef, so I think that helped with grease factor. Thanks.

This is an excellent and simple homestyle recipe.  My husband is a picky eater and likes good old homestyle cooking, and this was great!  I used lean ground beef, you know, the kind you can buy that says that it's only 8% fat.  I was glad that I did, because the lack of fat didn't make the recipe turn out dry at all and I didn't even have to worry with draining off the fat.  I've since made the recipe with ground chuck, which seemed like way too much fat to drain.  I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain, and added Worcestershire sauce as other reviewers suggested.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe almost to the T but i did take the advice of some other reviewers.  I added about 1 Tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and doubled the sauce topping. I also used itailian chicken stuffing instead of bread crumbs and it was excellent! While my husband and i really liked it, i felt it was missing something. I will experiment more next time.

This is a really great basic meatloaf recipe. I think it is key that the onions are chopped really fine, so I use my food processor. This recipe works really good with turkey as well. Served this with Suzy's mashed potatoes and a tossed salad...comfort food at it's best!

When I first got married (about 3 years ago) I had no idea how to make a meatloaf.  I know it's funny.  This recipe has been REALLY good to me.  I've been using it for 3 years and have made some minor adjustments - like making extra sauce for the top and adding different veggies.

I've even served this recipe to company and they LOVED it!  I sent them home with their own copy of the recipe.  :)

Thanks so much for sharing this and teaching me how to make a great simple meatloaf.

I love this recipe. It's quick and simple. I decided to double the sauce and  bake it at 375 for 40 to 45 mins. It turned out moist and yummy. Next time I'll try adding diced green peppers and minced garlic!

For years I tried to find a way to make the perfect and EASY meatloaf and I cam across this terrific recipe. I did tweak it some. I add chopped green pepper, chopped carrot, a pinch of garlic salt and a handful of parmesan cheese. It's simple and delicious! I highly recommend.

This recipe was not as great as I thought it was going to be.  I think that if I increased the breadcrumbs and decreased the amount of milk it may have turned out better.  The topping left much to be desired.

Quite possibly the best meatloaf I have ever tasted! I made this for my wife, and she raved about it. Tried the variations suggested such as adding the worcestershire and a bit of garlic powder and parsley flakes. Using finely ground seasoned bread crumbs made the taste and texture very good. Definitely keeping this recipe for future meals!

This was great!  I have never gotten a meat loaf to work for me before.  I've tried five or six times and was just about to give up on the whole meatloaf concept.  This was great!  The glaze was tasty as well.  Awesome!

This is by far the best meatloaf recipe I've ever tried --  my family loved it.  As others sugested,  I added some chopped peppers, cheese, and some of the glaze to the meatloaf.  I made double amount of the glaze.  Thanks Janet, this is a great recipe.

It's not a very dense meatloaf. But I do enjoy the texture as is. I opted for breadcrumbs, added Worcestershire sauce, and a garlic powder to flavor the meat. I used two eggs instead of one. I added 1/2 cup of leftover prepared Lipton Mushroom Rice Sides. I substituted the topping with good old ketchup. Five minutes before meatloaf finished, I topped with fried onion topping and placed it back in the oven uncovered until topping lightly browned. Delicious. Thank you for the recipe.

This meatloaf was AWESOME!!! I only made a couple changes (I have an unhealthy obsession with cheese). I added a handful of shredded cheddar, and a small handful of cheddar french fried onions... and about 1/4 cup warm water to the glaze ( because I knew I would want the glaze flavor in EVERY bite)
But just the base recipe itself was perfect! It blended easily, held it's shape for me to plop it in the baking dish ( I prefer not to use a loaf pan), and the end resultwasn't crumbly OR gooey. It was exactly as a meatloaf should be! I couldn't be more pleased!
Just for the record... my extremely finicky 6 year old gave it 2 thumbs up, literally!
Janet, your are a meatloaf diva!
Thanks for sharing this recipe... it will be a favorite in our family for generations, I'm sure!

My husband and I made this recipe for a church dinner. We adjusted it for 50 servings. I can't begin to tell you how many people loved it and are begging for the recipe. I'm almost embarrassed to let them know how easy it was. The only change I made was an additionof oatmeal for texture. Thanks!

This meatloaf is pretty mediocre and unimpressive.  It was way too dry - I think it's a decent recipe to serve as a base, but it needs something to make it saucier on the inside.  I think I would add some tomato sauce, or some ketchup or V-8 to the meat next time.  The topping sauce wasn't very good either.

This receipe was easy and tasted great!  The sauce was very good and complimented the meatloaf well.  I divided the mixture into 3 mini loaves and then put one in the freezer for sandwiches later!!  I will make this again.

I cooked this recipe when my mom came to dinner one night, she and my husband loved it! She asked for the recipe, and has since passed it on to my sister.  Everyone who tries it loves it!  My sister has also suggested adding a little bit of the topping into the meat mixture, however, I haven't had a chance to try it yet.

2 modifications which turned out fine:  Used honey mustard; only had 1/2 the amount of ketchup called for, so I filled in the rest with BBQ sauce - great & tangy!

Since I moved out of my mom's house, I needed to start to learn to cook. I found this recipe and made it for me and my roommates. They absolutely loved it ! Especially my one roommate who has never had meatloaf before. I didn't have milk on hand or brown sugar (used white sugar instead). Still turned out perfect. I had to keep it in the oven a little more than an hour. Very good!

This was very easy and tasty. I made only minor changes to fit what was in my cupboard. I used crutons that I ground in my processor for the crumbs, then chopped the onion plus some garlic in the processor, so that there were no 'chunkies'. After that I also processed up a carrot to sneak in some extra veg. 

I did saute the onion/garlic/carrot for a few minutes before adding to the meat mixture, but besides that everything was the same.

Toddler and husband gobbled it up in great amounts!

This is very good and easy.  I did not use onion because my daughter won't eat anything with "pieces" (sigh) but I put in a half envelope of dry "meatloaf seasoning" and it tasted wonderful.  I also used the Italian breadcrumbs just because I keep those on hand for meatballs.  But it didn't taste Italian due to the seasoning package.  My favorite thing was the ratios worked out very well - moist but not falling apart.

This meatloaf was the moist ever!! Not a single complaint from the family. Next time I will use a touch less of the brown sugar, made things a little sweeter than usual. This recipe also froze well (made double recipe). this is a keeper in our house, must try you'll definately be surprised that something so easy tastes sooooo good!

I've tried just about every meatloaf recipe there is, but this is the one I'll stick with. It's so moist and delicious! Instead of using an onion, I substituted a packet of onion soup mix because my kids don't care for big chunks of onion. Also, I used steak sauce instead of the sauce in the recipe. It was great.

I just ate one bite, saving the rest for dinner.  I made it ahead and put it in the fridge... I think it needs more cooking time but it was pretty good.  Not my mom's but it was easy and tasty.  Can't wait for the mashed potatoes and nice slice for supper!

I added mushrooms, oatmeal, bellpeppers, lots of garlic and onions. Made the topping, and baked it. I made 3 loaves, 2 for a support group I go to, and 1 for home. The best I have tasted, everyone loved it, the were fighting for the last piece. I got home and ate half a loaf in one sitting. Delicious, very moist. The Best Easy Meatloaf Ever, A must in any home recipe. I was skeptical about the topping, but it baked in, simply the best. Serve with mashpotatoes and garlic bread.....WOW!!!!!   Not a disappointment!!

Great recipe. I used the seasoned bread crumbs and doubled the topping as other users suggested.  It also needed a few extra minutes baking....I used a stonware loaf pan....that may have been why.  Everyone loved this recipe.  Thanks.  I will use this recipe again.

Was very easy and delicious.  Added a green pepper, little lemon juice, worcestershire sauce, ketchup and garlic powder. Just to change it up a bit.  Loved it, husband loved it.  Will make again.  Had to bake 1.5 hours.

Very good and easy recipe.  You can't mess it up!  My only two complaints were that the meatloaf was a little bland and the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste.  Next time I'll add a little worsteshire sauce to the loaf and cut the brown sugar in the sauce.
Thanks for the recipe!

My husband BEGS for this at dish every week! It's a sure fire winner at your dinner table, I highly reccomend it! The meatloaf always comes out very moist and flavorful, although I use about double the glaze, and bake it for maybe 20 minutes longer than the recipe says. Serve this with mashed potatoes, biscuits, and a vegetable for the best comfort meal ever.

This recipe was easy to do.  Next time, I will puree half the onion first and chop the other half very fine.  I will also consider adding a few ingredients that others have mentioned. Overall a good base recipe.

This was my first meatloaf and it was easy like the title said. Some people complained of it being too greasy. I used 93-percent lean ground beef and there was no grease at all after baking. I followed others' advice and added worchshire sauce, parsely and a sprinkle of ginger, and garlic powder and Lowrey's seasoned salt. I also added some carrot and green pepper. I would think this recipe would be pretty bland without some adjustments. But overall, it's a great base for creating a meatloaf to your liking. Like others, I liked the sauce, too.

This is the meatloaf recipe I have been looking for.  Very leasy to make, moist, and not too chunky with peppers and onions and such.  The sauce on top gives it just the right extra flavor.  This should be a very kid friendly dish.  I say "should" because unfortunately I couldn't get my one or two year old to even try one bite.  They are exceptionally picky though so it's not a refletion on this recipe...I thought it was very good!  Carol

This is a very good basic recipe! Like others, I added worstershire, and sauteed the onions with a little bit of garlic. Had to bake about fifteen minutes extra. Won't be using brown sugar next time, but that's just our personal preference.

A pretty good, basic meatloaf.  I had to cook mine *twice* as long as the recipe said, though, and there was an awful lot of liquid in the pan; I don't know if this is typical of all meatloaves, or if it's the recipe, or if I'm just a lousy cook (a completely plausible explanation).  Once it finally cooked, and I drained it, though, it was quite yummy!

Good recipe, very easy.  I used lean ground turkey instead of beef and it came out great.  Added the worchestire as others did and sauteed the onions.  I added 1 tbsp of BBQ sauce and the kids liked that.  I think I like ketchup only better!

I cook this for me and some friends about once a month and everyone raves about it.  People actually request that I make this meatloaf.  It has become a local favorite :)

Delicious!  I did customize it a little.  For moinstness, I added one torn piece of white bread.  Also, minced a garlic clove into the recipe and sprinkled a little parsley into the mix.  I also addedthe topping in the final half hour or so of cooking, that way I can better monitor the doneness of the meatloaf.  My family loves it!

Easy and very good. I used onion powder (unfortunetly no onions eaten by this family) also kicked it up a knotch with a little powdered ginger, seasoned bread crumbs, celery salt and a little balsamic vinegar in sauce. What is everyone in the reviews talking about " too sweet"?---"Two cups BS",the recipe reads 2T BS!

This recipe was very very good!  This is the first time I made meatloaf, and it tasted even better than my moms. Next time I will change the amount of bread compared to the amount of meat, this had too much meat I think, but it still turned out wonderful.  Reheated well too!

I made 100 servings of this recipe for the clients of our agency.  They loved it, I found the recipe easy, and I even had other staff members asking for the recipe.  I've never made a meatloaf with a glaze, but I thought it added a nice touch.

AHHHHHH! I wish I had read everyone else's reviews first! The meatloaf itself was very tasty and moist but the glaze was WAY too much. It should read 1/2 cup brown sugar NOT 2 cups brown sugar. Once we scraped off some of the glaze the meatloaf was very good. WARNING- DO NOT USE TWO CUPS OF SUGAR! I even doubled the recipe to 2 1/2 pounds of hamburger and the glaze was still way too sweet!

While a servicable meatloaf, the recipe called for too much onion and brown sugar. Additionally, cleanup was near-impossible.

I've made this several times and change it a little each time to suit my family's tastes.  i.e. I leave out the mustard and add extra ketchup.  And I've fooled around with how much topping I use.  I've made it for my parents and they enjoyed it.  Thumbs up!

I didn't add nearly the amt of brown sugar called for and it was very good.
We are serious meatloaf eaters in this house and they asked me to make this one again.
The meatloaf itself was very moist and tasty.
Just tone down on the sugar.

My husband who doesn't even like the thought of meatloaf actually liked this one.  I reduced the brown sugar to 1/3 cup because we don't like sweet food and it was still a little sweet for us but the glaze did do a wonderful job of keeping the meatloaf moist.  I also increased the mustard and think that definitely added a little kick.  Overall, a good recipe and made really great cold meatloaf sandwiches for lunch!

Excellent recipe. Turned out well for my wife and I. Plenty of flavor. Tweaked slightly by adding a 1/2 pound of lean turkey sausage to the mix along with a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles (drained).

This was the first meatloaf I've ever made, and my husband loved it. He usually makes meatloaf, and to make something better than he does is extremely rare. The only change I made was I sautéed the onions before I put it in the meatloaf mixture, and I put a squirt of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce in the sauce. Definitely making this again.

Great guide to the perfect meat loaf! Didn’t change much just sautéed the onions and garlic first and added more seasonings/Worcestershire sauce to the meat(I used venison). Also didn’t make the sauce, made brown gravy instead:-)

So good!!!! Normally I would just use ketchup on the top but this sauce is amazing!! I decided to put cheddar cheese in the middle for another texture and flavor and it was completely good. I love meatloaf but this was going up a notch!

This was delicious. Both my husband and I loved it. Someone else complained about the brown sugar and at first I was hesitant to use but glad I did because it added so much flavor to the sauce. Will be making again!!

I loved it! I only used 1/4 of the onion and added bell peppers, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce in the mix. Also the brown sugar was I tad sweet for me but I put ketchup mustard and Worcestershire sauce mixture on top and it was perfect

Did not use onions, and used a type of butter cracker instead of saltines. Shrank a bit when baking, but it was more than filling enough for my boyfriend and I. Used spicy mustard instead of regular mustard and it really helped to offset the sweetness of the brown sugar, it was very good! Overall, this was a quick and easy recipe that I will definitely be making again!

Perfectly simple with ingredients most already have. I didn’t have to add Worcestershire, Dijon, $5 dried mustard or other ingredients because they aren’t needed. The sauce on top was a perfect tang with a hint of sweet, not overly ketchup-y. I did use half an onion and it was enough for us but I had to cook the loaf for 1 hour 20 minutes to ensure cook through. I also used plain bread crumbs (my mom used to crush crackers which is great but bread crumbs make it fast for busy schedules). It could have been my oven but it was juicy and spot on still. I will definitely make extra sauce! Even my kids liked it so it’s a win.

It doesn't get much easier than this! Such a good meatloaf! I did take the advice of many of the other reviewers and add Worcestershire sauce, extra seasoning (garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, oregano, and thyme), and sauteed my onion before adding it to the meat mixture. I used a mixture of ketchup, BBQ sauce, and mustard for the topping (left out the brown sugar since the BBQ sauce was sweet) and that worked wonderfully! Tasted great! I also used 1 lb ground venison and a 1/2 lb lean ground beef. It took 1 hr 15 min to bake. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this tonight! I had to use stove top stuffing mix (Savory Herb) because I was out of bread crumbs.  I did put the stuffing through my handi chopper to make it more bread crumb like but the meatloaf came out fantastic!  My husband loved it :)

Excellent...easy..simple ingredients...made it twice, but the second time the only thing i did different was using Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and a marinara sauce to top off to reduce the sweetness.

This was so simple to make. I had some ground deer that was thawed and decided to give it a chance. I did sautés the onion and some garlic for a couple minutes and let it cool before adding it to the meat. I also substituted hot picante sauce for the ketchup. Because of the deer burger I inserted a thermometer for doneness check. Tasted

I made this and it came out better than my mother’s (according to my dad..YES!!) but i added heavy cream about 1/4 cup and then i put about 1/2 cup of mozz cheese in the middle. I also but it on 450 for the last 5 minutes. You didn’t even need the ketchup thing here. It was good all on it’s own.

Great recipe that I make over and over. Love  the simplicity of it. It’s also easy to remember the amounts. However I skip the sauce as I prefer ketchup by far with my meatloaf.

I love love love this meatloaf recipe!  It’s by far the best I’ve made.  I love the ketchup/mustard/brown sugar topping..it gives a sweat and tangy bite.  I follow the recipe with a few changes that others have made as well.  I sautéed the onions first and added Worcestershire sauce to meat mix.  I’ve made this a lot and it’s always a huge hit.

My husband has been a vegetarian for almost 30 years and I am a carnivore.  We followed the recipe exactly but used Beyond Beef in place of hamburger.  Deelish and we BOTH love it!

I made the recipe exactly as described. It was very juicy, easy to make and molded well. 

Taste wise it was just....ok. Boyfriend and I found it to be way too "oniony" I'm also not a huge mustard fan so the taste of the topping was a bit off for me. 

Would make again using half the onion and mustard. Also as others have said add a tbs of worseshire sauce to the meat. Hope next time is better.

Very easy- made it in instant pot and turned out good. Family had no complaints. Only change was the ketchup- I used chili sauce. My grandma always used chili sauce for meatloaf.

I noticed the people giving  this recipe 5 stars have mostly changed the recipe.  I made it exactly as stated and it didn't stick together and just kind of crumbled out of the pan.  Also, as many have said the topping was too sweet.  I am so sorry, but this wasn't great or even good.  I hope I can find another recipe for basic meatloaf that would be good.  Maybe I will try all the suggestions and see if that makes a difference.

I’m looking forward to trying this meatloaf recipe. Was thinking about making chili but my mom’s meatloaf came to mind instead. And it’ll be easy to take to work. This recipe comes close to how I remember Mom’s and I already know it’ll earn a 5-star rating.

I made this three times and one thing I'd add, before you add the meat mix up the egg, bread crumbs, milk and onions and then add the beef.  Much easier to combine.

I have made this per recipe many times and it is a great meatloaf. The beauty of it is that it can be a base recipe for alterations. If I’m missing an ingredient or feeling especially creative I make changes. But the one thing that I always do is make more sauce and add some to the meat.

It was really good and if you don’t have brown sugar use 2 tablespoons of syrup and 2 tablespoons of sugar also add butter and a1 sauce  while cooking onions for extra flavor :)

Made adjustments to fit my approach: I use one pound of ground beef and one half pound of ground pork (one and a half pounds total), reduced the bread crumbs to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup quick oats. Result was perfect.

I followed the recipe but  added Worcestershire. Great basic recipe. Husband loved it. IF there is any leftover it will make a great sandwich. I think I liked the sauce the best. Thanks for sharing!

Modified to make this vegetarian and gluten free and it was awesome. To be fair, how I made mine is pretty different from the instructions here because my partner kinda messed up the recipe and incorporated the sauce into the loaf instead of pouring it over top, however it turned out delicious! We are ketchup lovers so we didn’t mind putting a little ketchup over the finished product.

 In addition to that change, we used almond/coconut creamer instead of milk and added a clove of garlic, 1 tablespoon of organic vegan worchestershire sauce into the mix, used udi’s gluten free italian seasoned bread crumbs and changed the sauce as follows: 
2/3 cup ketchup
3Tbs each mustard and brown sugar

Next time i would want to try it without incorporating the sauce into the mix to see what it tastes like. However, I think that was a lucky mistake because we hypothesize that by incorporating the sauce into the mix we could actually forfeit the egg, which would be a great way to make it  for vegans.

Very tasty! A home run at my house for dinner! If you are using a disposable tin foil pan, be sure to stab holes all around the very low portions of the pan to express the grease otherwise your meatloaf may come out soggy on the bottom. This is my go to recipe! Enjoy!

This is a good and simple meatloaf that is very easy to make. I added Italian bread crumbs and Worcestershire  sauce. I didn't use milk.

After reading several of the different reviews. I took the advice of one reviewer. I sautéed the onions and garlic in butter.  I also added additional onion powder . Turned out delicious. The meatloaf itself did not fall apart when sliced .

I didn’t use milk and it was still mushy, worst meatloaf I’ve ever made.  I usually cook my meatloaf on 400 and it comes out firm. I think that’s the issue. I also use aluminum foil to cover for the first 40 mins. Remove let cook for another 15 mins or so & then add a sugar/ketchup mixture & cook for 10 more mins.

It is a good recipe. I read and learned from my previous peers experience. I added only 1/4 of the suggested brown sugar, and I browned the onion first.  I also added 1/2 t. Sp of Hoisin sauce and mixed the meat like a dough until the meat stayed together, like a dough, and the delicious smell of the meat came out.

I will make it again, but one hour was not long enough to cook through. It needed an additional 30 minutes. I will probably use instant minced onion too,  or chop the onion a bit finer. Not really fond of the topping, I could really taste the mustard. But my hubby loved it, so there's that!

Very good taste for an extremely quick & easy meatloaf. Use this one when in a rush. Do add a 1 tbs worcestershire to the mixture - think it adds flavor but not a necessary ingredient.

I loved this recipe.. I changed it only a little. I only had 1.2 lb ground beef so I used 3/4 of a cup of milk, bread crumbs, and milk instead of 1 cup of each. I also added a tablespoon of meatloaf seasoning from a packet, and about 2 TBL spoons of different herbs like thyme and oregano.. I wish the sauce glaze held together better. Tasted awesome before it was cooked. When the meatloaf was done the top sauce sort of separated and became greasy... was good anyway though.

This is delicious, and I have made it many, many times.  I make only two changes.  Number one, I use meatloaf mix that I buy at the grocery store (beef, pork, and veal) and number two I make my own breadcrumbs out of 3 or four slices of Original Pepperidge Farm bread which is sweeter than most breadcrumbs.  I cut them into pieces and then put them into the Vitamix on just the "on" button so they get a very gentle chopping.  Then I dry them in the oven on a low setting for ten minutes or so.  Otherwise I follow the directions exactly, and the meatloaf is just wonderful.

The meat was moist and the sauce needed some tweaking to increase the amount of sauce,  but not the flavor. The meat itself was very bland. I will make it again, but next time I will add my own spin on the meat itself. Not too bad though.

Easy to make. I go lighter on the onions ( kids dont like them ) I have substituted maple syrup when out of brown sugar.I have also added bacon to the top. The only thing I would add is that the internal temp should be 160° as it will increase slightly upon removal.

I have been making this for almost 10 years now and it is so moist and delicious. It's a basic recipe. Beef, onions, salt and pepper.  For those who said it was gross and threw it away...really? You threw it away? Then I believe a mistake was made on those individuals part.
One thing I do is combine the bread crumbs and milk first. Let that absorb nicely then add it to your mixture.  Also no need to precook the onions, just dice them instead of chopping. They cook up nice and tender.
Years ago I use to add everything but the kitchen sink into my meatloaf and everyone loved it. Today I believe less is more as with this particular recipe.
Also reading the negative reviews sounds like people are putting the ketchup and brown sugar mixture into the meat itself.  It is a sauce for the top and is VERY good. You can make it as sweet as you like.
Overall this is a super delicious recipe just on its own. You can certainly add to if you like. 
I thank you Janet!

I did a quick search for a new meatloaf recipe. The amount of reviews & 4.5 stars sold me on this recipe without actually reading any reviews or the recipe...I needed to get dinner on quickly. I printed the recipe & I was out the door to get the ingredients. When I finally looked at the ingredients I was  shocked that there were so few...I made it as per recipe, and it was DELICIOUS and EASY!!!! Many times I decide on if a new recipe is a "keeper" by the "taste to difficulty" ratio. Was the recipe worth making again? Many times it's just too much work and the results are just average.  This recipe is the opposite.  I will make this again AND I will make it exactly as written again.  I do have an excellent "go to" meatloaf recipe, but it's quite a bit of work and tons of ingredients. Point being the bar is set high on my meatloaf and this was an enthusiastic thumbs up! I used 80% ground beef and formed it into a loaf shape and put it on a sheet pan. Cooked as directed.

Perfect meatloaf.  I had to cook a bit longer than stated to get 165 degrees internal temp (high altitude perhaps). But the extra 20 minutes did not detract from the food, was still very moist, glazing perfect, and my grand kids loved it.

Did alter a bit this time adding salsa, celery and carrots. Otherwise followed the rules. Second time I've used this recipe and will refer to it again.

Excellent easy meatloaf  recipe.  I really liked the sauce initially but wasn't as good the next day; a little too sweet.  Definitely make again.

my family & i were verry pleased!! i used this with 3lbs of ground beef to make it a Bacon Wrapped meatloaf. basically doubled this recipe maybe a little less than a cup of milk n 2 cups of unseasoned bread crumbs and after saucing the top i covered n tuck the top with bacon strips;) DELICIOUS!!! and on the side used another recipe from here to make easy homemade mashed potatoes topped with brown gravy and a side salad ...perfect dinner.. now to make dessert--pecan pie.

Very Good Recipe------

Made this just as described and it turned out great.  Enjoyed the glaze--first time there was no leftovers--will double it next time.  Might just make this again next week.

I made it and it came out excellent the entire family loved it the only thing is I didn't use the mixture to poor over top of it I made a brown gravy mix and poured over top and poked holes through out so gravy could penetrate the meat while cooking

I used half diced onion and green pepper, minced garlic,  and a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce for flavor. I also substituted the bread crumbs with 6 slices of bread, a dash of salt, pepper, onion/garlic powder.

I made this for the first time tonight and it was a hit! I ended up using 2lbs of ground beef instead of 1.5, Italian style bread crumbs instead of plain, and added 2 eggs instead of one, but everything else I kept the same. It turned out soo good! The only other thing I think I'm going to change next time is I am going to puree the onions instead of chopping them. Definitely keeping this recipe for the future! 

*** also I cooked it for 1 hr 20 min since I added an extra .5 lb ground beef ***

So... I didn’t read the directions initially and I put ALL the ingredients on the list into the meat (including the topping ingredients). Once I realized what I had done, I made another batch of the topping ingredients to place on top the meat. Other than needing to take some of the liquid out of the loaf pan near the very end, it turned out AMAZING! Honestly, I am going to always make it that way going forward. Toppings inside and out! A happy accident!

We love meatloaf. I wanted to try something different. This was way too mushy, and the blandest meatloaf I have ever eaten. I made it exactly as stated. I love to cook, and I am good at it most the time. When I try new recipes, I make them as stated to give it an honest attempt. This was horrible without a lot of tweaking, and then it isn't this recipe.

DELICIOUS!!! I haven't been able to make a good meatloaf ever. Something is always wrong. BUT THIS RECIPE PERFECT!!! Soooo good. I sauteed the onion, added a tsp of minced garlic, and followed the rest of the recipe as is. I did bake it about 20 minutes longer. great recipe! will definitely be making again!

I am a very inexperienced cook, I can only make a few dishes well but this was very easy for me to make! We're lactose intolerant so I swapped the cup of milk out with water. I also didn't use as many onions (I might omit them completely next time) and I added some garlic salt and garlic powder. I used Bell's Meatloaf mix and one pound of beef since it was serving a smaller group. It was delicious! The sauce was amazing too and my dad had me make even more of it. It was an excellent experience. One tip I recommend is using latex gloves while mixing the meat since you should always be careful with uncooked meat handling, while your hands might be clean, the meat is not!

My #1 Go2 Meatloaf! I've made this dozens of times. I always double the sauce recipe cause I like a big fat yummy layer of it. I like to make slices in the meat so it can seep in and get its goodness inside too. This is everyone's favorite.

I've been making this for awhile now, with the exception of mustard in the mix. I'll try that next time. The topping is definitely sweet. My husband is not into sweet so much, me , the more the better so I always make a little extra in a side dish so I can lap it on :)

This was a solid base recipe for a meatloaf! There are numerous changes that anyone could make if they wanted to create a "more complex" meatloaf recipe, but for being toted as an easy one, it is very tasty AND quick in terms of prep. 

I will include a list of change ideas that can be made for those looking for more complex tips.

-Use a mixture of beef and pork, or even better, beef, pork, and veal. This can be found in some groceries already mixed or you can ask a butcher to grind and mix for you.
-Sauté the onions in 1 Tbsp butter until slightly browned.
-Add in 2 diced celery ribs and 1 Tbsp minced garlic when sautéing the onions along with 1 additional Tbsp butter.
Meat mixture adjustment suggestions:
   -1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce. 
   -1 tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder.
   -1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley or 2 Tbsp dry parsley.
   -Seasoned breadcrumbs vs plain.
   -Whole fat milk vs lower fat variations.
Topping adjustment suggestions (it's a BBQ sauce base):
   -1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
   -1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
   -1 tsp honey or molasses
   -1/4 tsp smoked paprika
   -1/4 tsp garlic powder
   -1/4 tsp onion powder
   -Hot sauce or cayenne to taste
   -Maple extract, bourbon, whiskey, etc.

I cut back to 1/2 cup of milk and added in about 1 cup of shredded cheddar.  I also added in 3 cloves of fresh garlic and pan fried along with a 1/2 an onion before mixing in.   I baked in a more shallow pan since I was in a hurry and cut back cooking time to 40 mins.   This meatloaf had good flavour, was moist and my 7 year old ate without a problem.   Thanks for the family-friendly recipe :)

I like meatloaf on the drier side so make sure you heat this uncovered.

Accidentally modified the recipe as didn’t notice the milk and only had 1lb. of beef on hand. It turned out great, family loved it. It was easy and very moist. I baked it in a glass dish for specified time. Will make it again, the same way.

The is my go to meatloaf recipe with my own twist.  I use less milk because of lactose sensitivities ( often use almond milk but only 1/3 cup) and grate in a small zucchini  with gives wonderful moisture.  I use two eggs and mix bread crumbs an oatmeal until I get the desired texture.  I love the topping.

I’ve been using this recipe for quite some time now, with a pinch of garlic powder, onion powder, and oregano. As far as the topping goes, since I was little we always used a ketchup and brown sugar glaze! As I read through the other reviews, I wanted to note that along with the ketchup and brown sugar, I also add a touch of mustard and Worcestershire sauce for the perfect mixture of sweet and salty! I saw that people prefer it in the meat mixture, but in case anyone else has toddlers or older parents that prefer less salt, it’s a nice compromise!

This was great! I doubled the topping amount and used a little bit less mustard. I also added about 2/3 of a can of corn to the meat mixture and used seasoned breadcrumbs. It turned out great. Even my 2 year old enjoyed it!

This is hands down the best meatloaf I have ever had! I make it exactly by the recipe other than I have to cook it about 10 minutes longer than it calls for but that is typical with my oven. This is an easy weeknight meal and family favorite!

The topping is what makes this recipe really stand out as a winner. So simple, yet so tasty. I always use a beef / pork blend in my meatloafs to "lighten" the beefiness.  I eliminated the salt and pepper from the basic recipe because the blend and Italian bread crumbs provide enough flavor.

Best meatloaf recipe I have found.
Has way more onions than I thought there should be, but it makes this meatloaf absolutely delicious!
I bake in a meatloaf pan and layer sliced bacon on top, and then add the ketchup & brown sugar sauce, to which I add a teaspoon or so of dry mustard. A must!

The best meatloaf recipe I’ve ever made. My husband loves it! It is the go to staple especially for cold winter evenings. The brown sugar, ketchup, mustard glaze on top really adds to the flavor.  I make it exactly as specified in the recipe and it’s perfect every time.

I made a mistake and put too much bread in it. My recipe is very altered from this one.... I add bell peppers and fresh garlic, season my meat with more spices, used hickory bbq sauce and raw honey, pasta sauce because I didn't have ketchup, and for the bread: saltines, low sodium chicken-flavored stuffing mix, and a few croutons. Probably wasn't more than 1 cup of bread but in ground turkey, it turns out too dry.

We made fresh garlic mashed potatoes, green beans, and Sister Shubert rolls. It was a fantastic meal and my husband and I had fun making it together!! :D

Instead of using onions, I used onion powder and garlic salt to save some time.  I added the Worcestershire sauce and Italian seasoned breadcrumbs like I normally do when making this recipe.  And I covered the top of the meatloaf with bacon instead of the ketchup mixture.  It turned out great.

TRIED AND TRUE
I made this recipe for my dad when it was first posted as he was in a rut as far as what he prepared for my mom.  He liked meat loaf and LOVED this meat loaf. I didn't like meat loaf but did like this one.  So whenever I made this, I made an extra one for him. Three years later when he passed. . .I made this recipe x5 for his Funeral Dinner and got so many rave results that I had to print the recipe in the church newsletter.  I'm thinking that the sauce for it was a very mild sweet tangy sauce without being too overwhelming BARBECUEY (I know--I just made that word up) or sweet--a nice balance of flavors. . .though my taste buds are far from being the end-all and be-all of the Universe. For those who favor a bit of sweet with their savory--try this reworked recipe. It is simple and lets the meat shine through without being too fussy.  If you are strictly a savory type of person--find one with a beef or mushroomy gravy.  One more thing--many people also add changes to this recipe. . .
when I had no onions, I would occasionally add a pkg of dried onioin soup that I mashed up for better distribution throughout the recipe.  Once added mushrooms and that too was a hit.  Don't be afraid to experiment--just keep it simple. . .there are many "add 1/3 C of tomato sauce and 1/2 cup of oatmeal--dry"  recipes with a very regimented blend and they're good too--just different.    I like to KISS when cooking since I am always pressed for time.

Like others, a little less mustard for the sauce and I added a little paprika and cayenne for a bite. I added Worcestershire to the meat as well as and sautéed the onions and garlic before adding to the meat.

I was never a fan of meatloaf but my husband asked me to make one and I stumbled upon this recipe... I’m so glad I did- it’s great! Be sure to double the sauce because that what’s makes this so good. I’ve made it many times since finding this recipe a few years ago and my family is always excited when I do.

I made this tonight due to the many positive reviews it got.  However, the meatloaf has a creepy texture and no flavor.  It was a bit like eating corn meal mush with a very slight beefy flavor.  Not a good combination.  I couldn't eat it and my SO ate it saying "I'm so hungry, I don't care".   I made the recipe as-is with no substitutions.  Just stay away.

Delicious and simple; definitely worth a try! I use seasoned cracker crumbs (the kind you use to make a meat and cheese cracker platter for a party, but- of course -smashed to bits) instead of bread crumbs, and threw in some onion and garlic powder along with the salt and pepper. Sautéing the onions in a little butter or vegetable oil with some garlic not only adds flavor, but greases the pan as you put the meat in once its all mixed together. 

For the sauce I use cranberry ketchup and dijon. Together they have a nice kick that tempers the otherwise desert-y glaze.

Made x2 now and plan to make it more in the future!

Delicious and so easy!  And the topping is so yummy, the only thing I will change is adding more of the ketchup/mustard/brown sugar for the top, it was so good I felt there needed to be more after it cooked.

This recipe was so easy to make and tasted super good! I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and sautéed the onion in fresh garlic (I used 3 cloves) and butter, I added a TBS of Worcestershire sauce to the mix, and I used Italian breadcrumbs. I also doubled the sauce because we love sauce! I did keep the ratios of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar as written and we really liked how the sauce came out! I don’t think it was “too sweet” at all. And the consistency of the meatloaf was perfect, I cooked it for an hour and 15 min just because some of the reviews scared me that the inside was raw after only an hour! Great meatloaf!

I made some major changes, but this is a great starter recipe for new cooks.  I use it to split the 3 lb family pack of hamburger I buy into ½ meatloaf and ½ cottage/shepherds pie.

I used 2 lbs hamburger and added 1 tbs Worchester  to the meat ingredients. I also sauted 1 medium red onion, 2 tbs chopped garlic in 1 tbs butter and added that to the meat mixture. For the sauce I used 1/2 c ketchup, 1 tbs mustard, 1 tbs brown sugar, 1 tbs Worchester. 

Cooking took about 75 minutes and it was delicious! Everyone from 16-45 years old LOVED it!

I love this meatloaf recipe and have made it many times. My variation is omit the mustard. I put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom of the dish, then add the meat, and possibly some bbq sauce on top if I have it on hand. The ketchup and sugar then bubble up through the meatloaf as it bakes, wonderful! I’ve also turned this recipe into freezable meatloaf muffins for meal prep. Such a great dish, I love it!

My family loved the sauce on the top, I used Honey mustard (I also doubled the recipe for the topping) 

I prepared this using 2 lbs. ground Venison. I added 2 cups precooked onions peppers and mushrooms, and about 1-1/2 cups of rice (all leftover from night before).
I used 2 eggs, a mixture of cracker and bread crumbs soaked in buttermilk. I also added 1 1/2 TB  Worcestershire sauce.

Leftovers were gone the next day!

Took the other reviewers' advice & added worcestershire sauce to the meat. Also sauteed the onions with a little bit of butter & garlic. I did lessen the sweetness by only putting in half the amount of sugar. Was a hit at my family's dinner table the other night. Was also good for lunch the next day.

Best I've had in a while. I added a second egg and that was a mistake. I put bacon on top (great if you like it).

I have made this recipe many times. I always substitute quick cook oats for the bread crumbs and double/triple the sauce. Turns out perfect every single time.

This was really easy to make and came out moist and tasty. I found the sauce was a bit sweet even for my taste. Great basic recipe for inspiration to customize at will. I'd probably turn this in an Asian version. ?? Thanks to the author and reviewers. ????

I’ve made this meatloaf so many times and it always turns out amazing!  I never liked meatloaf until I made this one. My kids even love it and ask for it!  The only substitution I make is almond flour for the bread crumbs to make it “lower carb”. SO GOOD!

It wasn’t the best meatloaf I had but it was quick and need few ingredients. I did add extra ketchup to the sauce because my Mom always used a lot of ketchup for our meatloafs when I was a kid. I didn’t think it needed brown sugar at all but it added extra sweetness if that is what you like. I also sautéed the onion in butter and garlic beforehand. 

It is simply just a plain, nothing special meatloaf.

Did as recommended - sauteed onions, added Worcestershire. Truly Easy and Truly Average.  I prefer a bit more zing in my meat. But a great base to start with.

Such a delicious and easy meatloaf! The sauce is so  good! I sometimes substitute chile sauce for ketchup for a little extra zing. I also add green pepper and mushroom to the onion with the meatloaf because I like it chunky. Comes out perfect every time and makes great mini loaves!

I loved this recipe! I didn't give it 5 stars because I made a few adjustments as well after reading the reviews. I used 90/10 beef so it would be less greasy, as well as a pan that kept the meat on a lifter pan so the meat didn't sit in grease at all. The package of meat was a little over 2.5 lbs, so I used two eggs, 2 onions, 1.25  cup of milk, 1.5 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I did saute the onions in a little butter as well before adding. At first it seemed like it was going to be too loose, but I continued to mix the meat with my hands and it was perfect. I tripled the glaze, but I cut down the mustard by half and it was more than enough. I cooked it uncovered for 1.5 hours and let it rest about 5 minutes before cutting and it was by far the best meatloaf we have ever had. SO good in fact that my fiancé said it was way better than his meatloaf, and the whole family actually wants to have it for Thanksgiving instead of the traditional ham we make. So thank you! It was excellent.

This is my third time making this recipe and my fiancé's face lit up when I told him what was for dinner tonight! Only changes were made to taste. Doubled the ketchup, kept mustard the same and did slightly less of the brown sugar. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was great! I used my copper chef  grilling oven pan. I did use some suggestions from previous reviews, which is why its only a 4...I so wanna give it a 5! I did add about 2T worshtershire, 2 eggs, reduced the milk to 1/4 C and I added green pepper and onion, sautéed the onion and garlic then added the chopped green pepper at the end.  I also added only Italian bread crumbs. I did double the ketchup mix, but I added 1/2 ketchup 1/2 bbq and a splash of liquid smoke. I did use a brush and brushed the top at first and last 15 min of cooking I brushed on the remainder. I did follow advice to use bread slices before placing meatloaf in the pan and worked excellent! MY KIDS LOVED THIS!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I’ve been making this for years. Definitely double the sauce and soften the onions in butter. I also add some crispy fried onion and use less raw onion. So good!

I  didn't separate the sauce ingredients. And I added a few drops of Worcestershire, a little Italian seasoning, and a splash of cherry juice and cooked an extra 10 minutes. BEST Meatloaf I've ever had. Is prepared mustard liquid or powder? I used powder.

I would like to officially rename this 'Onion Loaf'…..Seriously, waaaay too much.  And unfortunately I didn't have a chance to read the other reviews beforehand as I quickly decided to make this at the last minute. Otherwise I would have done less onion and sautéed in butter first so they weren't so sharp/raw tasting. Overall it still had a good taste once the onions were picked out.

I followed the recipe but did modify it a bit. Decreased the bread crumbs, used onion soup mix to give it a bit more flavor. the topping was a tad sweet. If I make it again in think I will used spicy brown mustard.

Wonderful recipe that I am told( by my family) to make again. Like everyone else, I sauté the onions with garlic and addedWorcestershire sauce to the meat. My husband loved the recipe as it is a bit sweeter than other recipes-but he loves sweetness. I will definitely add this recipe to our collection.

Great basic meatloaf recipe, but a bit bland. I'll make it again with the addition of a bit of hot sauce or cayenne pepper.

I’ve made this many times. It’s my go to meatloaf recipe & my family loves it. I double the glaze & adjust the mustard to taste. I love mustard but it’s a little overpowering at the same ratio as brown sugar. Otherwise best meatloaf ever!

Made it into 3 mini ones, used chicken broth instead of the milk (3/4cup instead of 1cup) & added some purée veggies for extra nutritional value. Moist & huge hit with everyone one (kids included!)

I love me a simple recipe, and this turned out SO GOOD. I am also an idiot and was rushing and put ALL ingredients into the meatloaf mix instead of having a separate glaze. Turned out to be a delicious mistake. Thanks for writing my new go-to meatloaf recipe!

I have never used a recipe for my meatloaf so there was no guarantee that it was going to be the perfect taste and consistency each time.  This recipe is spot on and tastes much like what my mom made us and kids.

Great taste! Too much onion for my palate, so I would do just 1/2 onion next time. I live at altitude, 7200 feet, so I baked mine at 375F. Also, it was too juicy in my opinion, so I may cut back on the milk or leave it out completely.

I  used a pound of beef, substituted Matzo meal for breadcrumbs , and used water instead of milk. Then, I  used yellow mustard instead of prepared mustard and added a few dashes of A1 to the sauce. Received lots of compliments.

Made it with gluten free panko breadcrumbs and cooked in muffin tins for 25-30 minutes. We froze them for use in lunches or meals as needed. My kids devoured them!

This recipe is THE BEST MEATLOAF EVER-I added Lea & Perrins  Worcest sauce to meat mixture and used  crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs then just didn’t add salt because the saltines has salt on them already and I sautéed the chopped onions in a lil butter and garlic before adding to the mixture.  Soo good!! also I used honey instead of brown sugar(out of it)in the ketchup mustard mix for the top and it was FABULOUS!!-I’m NOT a cook but my family showed up UNANNOUNCED & HUNGRY so you guys saved the day-Thanks

Actually I left my husband to make it with the only change being to use 1 pound gr beef and 1/2 lb of gr pork. It was so delicious! When I got to the door, I could smell the aroma before I opened it.  We decided this is a keeper.  That sauce for the top was the star of the meatloaf.

This is my go to meatloaf recipe. Perfect as is. In a pinch I’ve also used rehydrated dried minced onion and that worked perfectly fine as well.

I used dry onion soup mix ( I do in all my ground beef recipes), I was reluctant to put brown sugar in (so about 1 teaspoon) I also added little A1 steak sauce along with the normal breadcrumbs, etc. Wasn't bad at all. My 5 * is the dry onion soup mix.

This was so delicious. We thought it was the best meat loaf we had ever had. Followed reviewers suggestion and added 1 Tbs of Worcestershire sauce and Italian breadcrumbs. This is a keeper. Thank you for a great recipe!

Absolutely loved this! Also, I messed it up by accident and instead of reading all the directions I mixed all the ingredients in together. I think this actually helped. My boyfriend who was very hesitant to have meatloaf actually really liked it as well. So win for me! :)

The first time i made this i added jalepenos and used a jalepeno ketchup for the glaze/sauce. It was delicious, it just seemed to need more sauce. 
So making it again, i made extra glaze and layered some halfway through the loaf. It was perfect!

I used crackers instead of bread (didn’t have stale bread) and it was yummy! We like extra sauce so I’ll double that next time.

I change nothing. This meatloaf became our favorite so many years ago, after finding on AR.  Still make it quite often. The glaze is what makes it such a crowd pleaser too.

Great recipe! I did sauté the onion then added it into the ground beef! I also added a dash of cayenne pepper to the sauce, I find the sauce a little sweet. Other than that, it’s perfect!

(((Vegeterian version)))
I've been vegetarian for 4 years & often challenge myself by making some of my favorites dishes into  meatless versions. Sometimes they're a miss but most of the time they're a HIT! This veggie meatloaf was definitely a big hit at home! Even my husband (who's a meat eater) LOVED IT!
I substituted the meat for Lite Life Smart Crumbles & used tomato juice instead of milk. 

I TOTALLY RECOMMEND

This was a delicious recipe as the meat was moist and very flavorful. The sauce for the top of the meatloaf requested a little too much mustard for our liking so we plan to reduce the amount for next time. I’m also guilty of adding 1 tablespoon of worchestshire (spelling????) to the meat mixture to give it a little boost.

Followed the great advice of sauteing onion. I did not have seasoned breadcrumbs so I just mixed thyme, sage, rosemary and salt to the breadcrumbs. Turned out great.

I love this meatloaf! I am low carb so I used Panko Pork Rinds and half and half to cut the carbs. Good stuff! Plus you can use this recipe as a base and add whatever goodies you want to change it up when in the mood.

Really good meatloaf (and so easy/quick!) but I would prefer a different sauce. I'm not a big ketchup fan. Next time I will use a different sauce recipe but I'll keep the meatloaf recipe the same.

I really don't like meatloaf but my husband does. I made this almost exactly except that I added Worcestershire  sauce, poultry seasoning, garlic powder and used Italian bread crumbs. OMG I loved it. So did he.

I added shredded mozzarella cheese :P and used half of the brown sugar (which I mixed into the meatloaf) and didn't add the mustard (we were out) The whole family loved this and asked for more, this is a big win in my book :D

I found myself out of onion soup mix on meatloaf night and tried this one.  Since I was also out of ketchup, I used Stubb's BBQ sauce for topping instead.  Pretty good!  Perhaps I will try this topping next time! Today I mutilated the onion in the food processor and used cracker crumbs.10/01/19 today I put the bread crumbs in the food processor with the onion.  I have been making this weekly.  For seasoning I pitch in an envelope of McCormick 's meat loaf seasoning.  11/6/19 last night I used one envelope  onion soup and only a half onion.  They liked that too!

I love this dish. Its super easy to make and absolutely DELICIOUS. It always comes out moist and perfect. Ive made this 3 times now and I think the brown sugar is a nice touch, but you can make it without it, too. Also, I usually use a little over a pound, not necessarily 1 1/2 pounds and it still turns out great. And dont use a large onion but thats all.

I used meatloaf mix (veal, pork and beef).  It tasted good.  Next time I’ll use more spices and less onion.  The ketchup, brown sugar and mustard sauce was very tasty.

This was my first time making meatloaf and this recipe was quite tasty. After reading the reviews, I did make some small modifications. I sautéed the onions in butter like some other reviewers recommended. I also added 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire to the ground beef mix. I cut down the recipe to 6 servings, so if any of you are making more, I would add maybe 1 tablespoon or more of Worcestershire. The recipe also didn’t specify if the meatloaf should be cooked uncovered or covered. I cooked it covered for 40 mins and cooked uncovered for 30 mins. The meatloaf came out perfect! The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because I wasn’t too fond of the ketchup sauce. I’m not big on ketchup in general so it’s a matter of preference. I felt that the ketchup sauce was too overwhelming. I’ll have to play around with it in the future, however, the meatloaf itself was delicious. I also read others saying that the sauce wasn’t enough, so many doubled on the sauce. In my opinion, I don’t think it’s necessary. I thought it was just fine. I will definitely make again!

I make this a little differently but have been using this topping for years.  I make the meatloaf with a box of stuffing mix, 1 cup milk, and 2 eggs.  I bake in a 9x13.  My family and everyone who has tried it loves it so far.

I have made this a million times. It’s my husbands favorite. I also add Worcestershire and minced garlic. And triple the sauce. And use Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Comes out perfect and moist every time. Serve it with garlic mash potatoes and whatever vegetables I have on hand. So easy. Brought leftovers to work for lunch and everyone wanted the recipe. Wish I could give it 10 stars!

SO simple to make and the flavor is excellent.  I made twice the sauce to top it and it was so delicious, I might triple it next time!  Great recipe, thank you.

Whenever I make meatloaf, I look for new ideas and gave this one a try.  I altered the amount of ingredients and cooking time because I used 2 1/2 pounds of meatloaf mix (hamburger/veal/pork).  Ran out of breadcrumbs (of course) so I used less of them and less milk. I added the brown sugar, ketchup and mustard into the meat. It came out moist and delicious, everyone loved it.

I don't usually do reviews but this meatloaf is a big hit in my home.  All 3 of my young kids will eat it without complaint so any recipe that pleases all of them deserves 5 stars in my book!!  I have made it just like the recipe, but my favorite version of it is with Italian Bread Crumbs, and I like to sub the onion for dried minced onion - it keeps the flavor for me but the lack of obvious onions for the kiddos.  If I make for adults, I salute the onions in butter or olive oil before adding them to the meat.  If they go in raw, they are a little to crunchy for me.

What I changed: only added meat, 1 egg, 1c breadcrumbs and milk, packet onion soup, 1/3c ketchup. Poked holes in loaf with chopstick,  sprinkled brown sugar, topped with 3 strips uncooked bacon, more sprinkled brown sugar. EXCELLENT, moist and too sweet (may skip the sending sprinkling next time)

My meatloaf turned out awesome!!  I added a couple tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and it was perfect!  My boyfriend and nieces loved it!! ( I you used 80/20 hamburger meat and drain 50-75% of the juices half way through baking).

Great! My husband is not a big meat loaf fan, but I am. Tried this one for a change and we both loved it. I substituted 1/2 lb of  pork, turkey and beef smoked sausage for part of the ground beef and used spicy brown mustard and Italian bread crumbs.It was sooo tender and tasty.  This is my go to meat loaf from now on. Very easy to make too.

Bored with traditional meat loaf I used lamb. 
For this round I used 1.5lbs lamb and 1/2 a tube of hot breakfast sausage mix. 
I did sauté the onions first with a good helping of garlic. I don’t like crunchy onions as much as my wife. 
Added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce to the meat. Totally added what was missing.

I actually messed this up when making it, and added EVERYTHING together - including the brown sugar, mustard and ketchup (I was really tired and in a rush).  And after I had it all mixed up, that's when I realized what I did.  So I mixed some brown sugar, mustard and ketchup, and added it to the top anyway.  It came out super delicious - and I'm not a huge meatloaf fan.  I would actually probably make it the same again because it was so good.  So I guess the point is...even when messing this up, it was still delicious!

Great recipe! I used ground Turkey and it was just delish. I made extra sauce because Turkey has a tendency to dry out. I will definitely be making again.

My family and I love the recipe for the glaze, and the meatloaf itself is the same as my mom's. I have to make one change using about 3oz cream cheese for the egg. We have to avoid for an allergy. my 2 toddlers eat it up

I have made this recipe several times. The only change was due to missing ingredient in which the substitution was good but the original is better. My Boys love this meatloaf.

I've made this 3 times now. I didn't read the instructions properly the first time and I added all the ingredients to the ground beef and didn't do the topping. The second time I followed the recipe and we didn't like it as much. Third time threw it all in the ground beef again it was great. I subbed BBQ sauce for ketchup, cooked the onions in the frying pan first and added 2 tea spoons liquid smoke.

Great recipe! First time ever making meatloaf (actually first time making anything in the oven!). Made it for my wife & Kiddos for Mother’s Day & it was DE-LISH! A home run! Served it with corn & potato tots on the side. Simple to do. If anything I’d recommend bumping the temperature up a bit. This took about 45 mins longer than expected to cook. Other than that totally recommend!

to season I used parsley and Worcestershire too. Also I used about half the onion which was a good call because it was still very onion-y. I used tomato paste and water instead of ketchup. It was so good this way but not sure how it would be with all that onion

the title says "EASY MEATLOAF" for those complaining, heres what i did, i read the ingredients, knew that i would be changing it up so its not some basic meatloaf,  like sauteing the onions with some garlic, using real bread soaked in milk, adding worcestershire sauce and some shredded up cheddar, a little bit of green stuff, cutting back on the sugar, etc. dont be afraid to make it work, i followed their instructions along with my own ideas and had a delicious meatloaf.

I have been making this at least twice out of the week for a year now. My family will even have it for breakfast or in a sandwich during the week for a lunch. I now sauté my veggies and add a good amount of wishershire sauce to the meat thanks to another viewer who had posted her tip. Oh so good.

Easy, yes.  Tasty, no.  But it would be fine to serve in a nursing home.  Shame on me for not adding additional ingredients.

This is my second time making this recipe & it's fantastic! I didn't have specific bread crumbs so I used toast;  & added minced onions & some of the brown sugar mixture into the meat. I was actually told by my MOM that it was the best she'd ever eaten! Which is definitely high praise!

I followed some of the changes in other reviews to cook onions prior, use less brown sugar, and use  alumin foil liner for easy cleaning. we loved it!! I will do it again.

Too much liquid. We even reduced the milk amount to 2/3 cup but it took forever to cook and although tasty, would definitely reduce the milk or skip the milk altogether next time.

2 Stars if you make it according to the recipe. The brown sugar & catsup topping is overpoweringly sweet without enhancing the flavor of the meat. The meatloaf without the frosting (and that's what it is) warrants 3 stars... it's good, but nothing special.

added in some Worcestershire sauce, and finished off with some fried onions on top. Next time I probably won't add the brown sugar,  was a little too sweet for me.  Beyond that.  It was a huge hit!

I followed the recipe as written  and was disappointed in the taste (I think it was the mustard in the topping).  The meatloaf itself didn’t seem to have much flavor, so my search continues. I will not be making this one again and have removed it from my favorites.

This was an excellent very easy to follow recipe and it made the most delicious juicy meat loaf! It was moist and very tasty and delicious with the mashed potatoes, gravy and steamed carrots. I would recommend this recipe for anyone who loves meatloaf and wants a very simple easy to cook recipe

I made it exactly as it says,except I forgot to get onion and onion powder, and I used crushed Ritz crackers but it still came out awesome! My boyfriend loved it and I brought some for one of my coworkers who normally doesn't like meatloaf, but she loved it also and asked for the recipe. I love the glaze!

I thought is was great. I didn’t realize the ketchup mixture went on top because I thought the directions said to add all ingredients. It was very tasty anyway. Not too sweet to me or my husband, and I used ground wheat crackers and everything came out perfect. The only thing I did differently was add more spices.

This was a simple yet delicious meatloaf.  I tweaked the ingredients a bit based off of the reviews, I used 1/4 cup of bread crumbs instead of what the recipe calls for.

Also, for the topping that goes on the meatloaf I did not put it on until there was 15 left of cooking time left for the meatloaf.

I loved it!

I have made this a few times with great success. I use oats instead of bread crumbs, and 2 eggs. I have also used bbq sauce on top either with the mixture or instead of.  I have also made it adding an onion soup mix. I always add seasonings to my meals, usually a Cajun or seafood, throw a few fresh rosemary sprigs on top; and I add garlic. My two finicky eaters both approve!

Easy. I make this in double batches and freeze one uncooked for use another night. I only put brown sugar and catsup in the sauce...like my mom did. :)

I toast bread, let cool, and crumble it in food processor. Then add other ingredients to processor. I’m generous with salt and pepper.

Made this just as stated. Came out very good! Quick and simple.  May cut back a little on the brown sugar the next try. A big hit with both I and my son.

Yes! We like it!! ??My husband made it and thought the title fits it perfectly.I enjoy making meatloaf with bone broth instead of the milk, it’s an easy,flavorful way of making the meatloaf dairy free. Thanks for the recipe.

I love the flavor of the meat, but I find the topping a little too sweet. My family has always put chopped tomato into the mix, rather than ketchup on top, but the recipe is easy as can be, great for a weekday dinner.

Dee Lish! I ended up mixing all ingredients together as well as coating it with ketchup and mustard. 
I used honey mustard instead and also added finely chopped fresh tomato and garlic in the meat mixture.  Really good.

Delicious! Used the Worcestershire but unless you like your meatloaf drowning in ketchup, no need to double the glaze. Definitely a keeper.

Loved this recipe! I’m not a fan of cooking but this was easy enough to do and doesn’t take much time to prep (about 20 min). I used 2 lbs of beef and made 2 loaves. 
In addition to sautéing the onions in garlic and adding Worcestershire sauce, I also added green bell pepper and cilantro. I’m allergic to egg so I used an egg replacement mix (potato starch) and it held up just fine. I doubled the amount of ketchup but didn’t change the mustard portion. Can’t wait to eat this again for the rest of the week!

Per the other reviews/suggestions, I sauteed the onions with some minced garlic, used seasoned breadcrumbs and a few dashes of worchestershire sauce.  Next time I will also add more more salt and maybe even sub in some vegetable juice for the milk to give it more flavor.  My family liked the sauce/glaze, but they wanted more of it, so I will make more next time.

My husband said this was way better than his mum's meatloaf..! Very tasty and moist, even when reheated. I'd probably leave the sauce next time I make it, I prefer onion gravy.
Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

I didn't make any changes except adding a little more ground beef, but it still came out juicy and delicious. And the sauce on top is a bold complement to a subtle flavor of the ground beef.

Paid attention to others' suggestions and sauteed the onions before adding them to the mixture. Was good, not "the best I've ever had" and if I were to make this again I would cut back on the mustard.

I made the recipe exactly as is, otherwise how could I honestly “review” the posted recipe?! It was delicious, pleased the critic (husband) and brought the picky eater (son), back for seconds. My girls are fairly neutral eaters, and they ate without saying a word. Mashed red skin potatoes and green beans for sides. 

Excellent meatloaf. I saw a lot of interesting modifications in others reviews, but I’ll leave it as is for now! Thanks for sharing.

THE BEST CHILI !! 
I have tried so many chili recipes, even making up my own but none of them come close to this! The only thing I changed was I used black beans instead of kidney beans.  Be careful if you double the recipe not to double the chili powder otherwise it over takes all the other flavors. I doubled the recipe but only used one and a half the chili powder.

I used 3/4 cup oatmeal instead of bread crumbs. And 3/4 cup of milk. Turned out awesome. I always make extra of the sauce to put on later.

I have had several versions of meatloaf in the past; this one was just a little plain for me.  I added some cumin and smoked paprika to and some garlic powder to zing it up a little.  Much tastier.

I made this and it was great! I followed a lot of the other comments on adding thing (Worcester sauce, the seasoned bread crumbs, etc.) I also added shredded cheddar to the meat mix. Shredded cheese is one of my favorite things to add to a meatloaf and I think it added just something a little extra. Over all good recipe and room for lots of customization.

Best yummy meatloaf! We use half an onion not a whole & 1lb ground venison & 1/2lb ground beef. We used a stone ground mustard and it was delish! Took much longer than an hour to get the internal temp 165... but so worth it!

I am a freak about meatloaf. I have been making the same recipe for as long as I can remember. I decided to try something different and this recipe popped up on my feed. Hands down the best meatloaf I’ve ever eaten!! The only thing I do different with the recipe is I double the sauce.

It was very good.  The only problems were on my side, as in not mixing well enough to get the bread crumbs into the mix completely.  Otherwise, great.  I will definitely do this again!

For my first time making meatloaf, I really enjoyed it! There were a few things I'd do differently next time, though. The meatloaf was super moist, and I didn't even use the full cup of milk, so next time I would use less than 3/4 cup. I also think that seasoned bread crumbs would add more flavour to it, or maybe just mix some seasoned with some regular. I also added a green pepper, and cooked it for about 80 minutes. Overall, my sister loved it so I was very satisfied with this, and will definitely be making meatloaf again in the future!

I don't understand any negative ratings on here! This is the only meatloaf I make. I do add some diced up cheddar cheese to it as well. It is my favorite!!! Definitely recommend for any picky eaters life myself.

add your own blend of chili powder and crushed peppers (the more variety the better) to give it a little kick.

Great recipe. Meat loaf came out just lovely. I go by this recipe all the time. I love the topping while it's baking. Anybody who screws up this recipe can't cook period!

This was good!  I used saltines and green onions, since that’s what I had on hand.  This meatloaf tasted like the comfort food meatloaf of my childhood.

I make this at least twice a month sometimes more. My son and husband love love love this meatloaf. When and if we ever have left overs 9 times out of 10 we do not. But the left overs are great also.

I've made it 2x and it's a piece of cake.  

My only exceptions to the  recipe were:  1/4 chopped Green bell pepper; 2 Tbsp BBQ sauce; 1 Tbsp Scallions for garnish; 1 Tsp Smoked Spanish Paprika.

Thanx.

I sauteed onions with garlic then added them to the meat mixture.  I listened to other reviews and added 2 tbsp of  worcestershire sauce to the milk mixture.  I reduced the brown sugar to 1 tbsp and only used 1/3 cup of ketchup and 3 tbsp of mustard.  I also used just over 3 lbs of meat so I doubled most of the ingredients, eggs, italian bread crumbs, onions, and 1 1/2 cup of milk.   I'll rate it after they eat it tonight.  Done; maybe 1 hour was too much because the top of the meatloaf burnt.  I'll try again for a shorter period of time &/or eliminate the sauce all together.  Will update when done next.

Made this before and it's always a favorite. This time, I added sliced garlic, some jalapeño and some freshly squeezed orange during the last ten minutes of baking to see how it will taste. I made another batch without jalapeños.

Update: It tasted great with the orange squeeze and jalapeños weren't that spicy.

I've made this meatloaf several times and it is fantastic.  The last time I made it  I used 1 1/2 cups of canned French Fried Onions in place of the onion and it was even better!

This recipe was the best meatloaf I've ever made! Kudos to the author, from this lazy cook! I used crackers and breadcrumbs, ground beef and ground turkey, and sauteed my onions. Also added garlic powder to mixture.

Super easy. I do mix the ketchup, mustard and honey (sub for brown sugar) into the loaf instead of putting it on top and use uncle chris' gourmet steak seasoning (a few shakes) instead of just salt and pepper. Kids love it and foodie hubby has been asking for it again.

Ran out of ketchup so I used manwich sauce instead. Also didnt have bread crumbs so I food processed some garlic croutons I had.  This was amazing. Added garlic because we loved it! Absolutely no complaints. We also doubled recipe and used a 9x13 pan making a rounded loaf shape. As it cooked i drained grease. Cooked for about 1 hour and 45mins.

Excellent! I made ours with 93% lean ground turkey meat. No grease. Great texture. I too sautéed the onions / garlic and added a sprinkle of garlic powder to the mix.

I will follow what reviewers have posted and I'm not adding one cup of milk. That's way too much moisture. I'm just going to add a little milk and one egg. I'll also saute the onion and add some BBQ sauce to the sauce recipe too. Hope it turns out well!

LOVE this recipe! I doubled the recipe, but only used one onion, which was plenty. Would also use less mustard/more ketchup in the sauce. Cooked it in a glass casserole dish lined with foil instead of loaves (since the recipe was doubled) and increased heat to 375 for 1 hr 20m. Came out great! SO good, definitely going to make again!

(No photo because we ate it all before I thought to take one lol)

turned out very juicy and lots of flavor.  not sure if its our oven or because i was cooking 2 1/2 lbs of meat but it was still pink in the middle.  I'll cook it a little longer next time.  overall very impressed with the recipe and will make again.

I made it on a recent very cold day for my two picky eater grandsons. I put two small carrots in a food processor until they look like orange paste. I can't use shredded carrots or they'll sit and pick them all out before eating. They loved it didn't even notice the carrots. I'll be making it again maybe I'll also add zucchini.

I sauted mushrooms and the onions together, added a smush of chopped garlic and added Worcestershire sauce. I also added some ground pork to the beef.
This is a great basic recipe that's easy to manipulate for added flavor and texture.
Before coming across this recipe I never added mustard or brown sugar to the ketchup but it's so good.

Like other reviewers, I tweaked the recipe. I like meat loaf to be solid so after reading several reviews that said this was too mushy, I used only 1/2 cup milk. Several reviews said it was too bland, so I used Panko Italian style breadcrumbs  for extra seasoning. Because I don’t like to chop onions and the recipe was vague about the amount of salt to add, I used one packet of onion soup mix for both onion flavor and salt. I threw in 1/2 tsp of black pepper and it looked like enough. I shaped into a loaf and placed into an oblong casserole dish so the grease would drain out. Me and the rest of the family loved it!

Great simple, learner recipe for beginners trying to self teach, or quick and easy for the pro that may not have all their spices or ingredients for there own version, really liked the flavor the brown sugar ketchup sauce made even a dead 2 tablespoons to the meat itself.

Quick and easy and very tasty. I  eliminated the sugar topping
and added a side of gravy. Excellent leftovers sliced cold as a sandwich.

Instead of putting ketchup on it I put BBQ sauce on top, mixed some into the meatloaf as well, I also upped the brown sugar to 1/2 cup added some cinnamon into the meatloaf mix as well. My family loves this so much. Definitely takes away the original recipe classic but it's so much better. It's a sweet and savory meal... Goes amazing with mashed homemade sweet potatoes, green beans that have some butter and garlic seasoning on them

This is a great recipe. I always just use 2 lbs of ground beef and add an additional egg and 1/4 cup of milk. For a no carb or keto option, I use crushed chicharrones instead of crackers and nobody can tell the difference. I coat it with a 50/50 blend of ketchup and A-1 Steak-sauce. I don’t add the sugar because I don’t like my meat that sweet. A winner for dinner at my house anytime!

Every time I make this into mini meatloaves,  I'm always asked to make again and make more.  Even picky kids love it.

Excellent recipe!! I too sautéed the onions and because we aren’t huge ketchup fans I added about 1 tsp of sriracha, 2 TBSP of ketchup, and the rest BBQ sauce. Instead of mustard I used Sweet Baby Rays honey mustard and about a tsp of worcestershire sauce, because of the extra liquid I added two cups of breadcrumbs/crumbled RITZ crackers, same baking temp & time. Well received at our house. 
Love that everyone shares the little tweeks to the recipes-thank you all.

This meatloaf is simply perfect. It’s a classic, without any weird alterations. I did whip up a little extra catchup sauce for the top. But this is one of the best meatloafs I’ve ever made.

We love this meatloaf recipe. It literally melts in your mouth! We’ve sliced the cold leftovers and used the meat on whole grain or rye bread with spicy mustard to make awesome sandwiches the following day.

First time ever making meatloaf. Husband and son loved it! Easy. Followed other reviews - used season bread crumbs, sauteed onions, added 1 T Worcestershire sauce to meat mixture, doubled ketchup and brown sugar.

I only had a 1lb of meat. I used boar meat instead. I had no onion, used garlic and onion powder instead. I doubled the topping and put in less sugar. I added Worcestershire to the meat and made my own breadcrumbs. I added an extra egg. I also increased the cooking time by ten minutes. When it was  done I drained it.

The brown sugar on top was perfect.  If you don't want it on top because you think it might be too sweet cut in half and add in the mix.

I made this twice now.  This time I added 1/4 cup Knorr dry Onion Soup seasoning and doubled the breadcrumbs.  It’s PERFECT for us.  I made 3x the amount and froze individual  portions.  Is excellent with an onion gravy and mashed spuds.  Thanks for the recipe!

I use truvia brown sugar. I used 1/2 bread crumbs and 1/2 regular oatmeal this time. But last time I just used unsalted crackers because that was what was in house! But no matter what my husband loves it. And it reminds me of my mom’s meatloaf! Thank you Janet!

I made the recipe as written with the addition of sauteing the onions with minced garlic. The flavor of the meat was fairly bland even when using flavored bread crumbs. I added Adobo seasoning and pepper at the table to each plate to make it more palatable. The topping mix portion was too small as well, could easily double it.

I have made this recipe many times but I have adjusted it quite a bit. Firstly, know that it works with turkey or beef.  Secondly, there is no need for the sugar at all. 

I am wheat free (which makes me gluten free most of the time as wheat is in everything), I have replaced the crumbs and milk with greens. Instead of those two, I usually use a pound of spinach or a mix of hardy greens. I pan fry them to wilt them first, then drain and chop them once cooled a bit. Because the greens have so much moisture, they make the meatloaf very moist and a healthier option as well. As the greens cool, I pan fry my onions. Then I mix everything in a bowl with spices (I have a mix I love to use that has thyme and rosemary and other herbs as well as pepper and salt as a blend), and after spraying oven safe dish with a cooking spray (Avocado oil in my case as it has a high heat tolerance) I spread the meat mixture into my dish.

For the sauce, I have used a mixture of ketchup/bbq/Dijon mustard, and I mix to taste so proportions vary. I have also used a creamy bell pepper dressing mixed with ketchup and mustard as well for a twist on it. 

Also, because I’m in the mountains at over 5000 feet, I always change the cooking temp to be a little higher. So in this case, I cook at 375F.

Hope you enjoy the recipe! It’s a great base to adjust to your family’s tastes.

Very good recipe, you do not have to sauté the onions first if you just mince them.  Added Worcester sauce to meat mixture and cut mustard in half for the sauce on top.

I made this according to the recipe, other than doubling the main recipe and tripling the glaze recipe. I used 80/20 ground beef. Next time I'll use 90/10 just to reduce the amount of grease released. I made it in a 9x13 pan as a full-pan and it came out awesome. Everyone loved it! I paired it with mashed potatoes and sweet peas for sides. Great dinner with only a few minutes of prep. In total I think we had 90 minutes from entering the kitchen to serving the table. Clean up was a breeze.

3 times:  #1 a little sweet for me, #2 tweaked w/ half onion/ half green pepper 4 star, #3 same as #2 except reduced brown sugar to 1 Tbls. and made 2 loaves side by side in a 9/9 glass pan, to me 5 Star. Shortened bake time & better topping coverage. P.S. check with meat thermometer might not take the full hour. #1 & 2 took 1.3 hours.

We love this recipe. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because we prefer less mustard, more ketchup. I too like to add 1 T worcestershire sauce and to sautee the onion with a little garlic and butter before mixing with the beef. It's delicious!

Excellent base for meatloaf and you won't be disappointed with it as is.  I have made a few adjustments to suit my family's tastes.  I replace a few tablespoons of milk with ketchup and add some celery to the mix.  I mince my regular bread and the vegetables in the mini food processor so they are the texture of relish; a very small mince (kids, you know!)  I also add some thyme with the salt and pepper.  I love the sweet/tangy topping.  I use a little less sugar, though.  If I decide to make gravy, I omit the topping.  Wonderful recipe..I recommend this as a guideline to those who ask for the recipe I use..and encourage them to adjust it to taste.

This is a great recipe. My first time making meatloaf and it came out great. My boyfriend, sister and daughter loved it. I just added a green bell pepper and only used half of that and half an onion for 2.5lbs of meat. That was just personal preference as we aren’t big onion people. Used the leftover sauce to put on top of our plates. Served with Mac and cheese, corn and Texas toast (not pictured)

This meatloaf was good. I tweaked a few things (caramelized the onions, onion powder, and garlic powder  tend to enhance the taste of the fresh ingredients) because I know my taste buds. Other than that, this was a great recipe.  I loved the sauce too.

Made it per the recipe exactly except added Worcestershire to the sauce at the last minute (forgot to incorporate it into the meat mix per the suggestions). It was so good! I will try some of the other suggested changes next time.

I altered the recipe a bit too:Chopped carrots, onions, celery sautéed in butter. About 10 quartered cherry tomatoes. Oatmeal instead of bread crumbs. A bit of garlic powder. 3 tbs ketchup. I tbs honey mustard. Bake for 1 hr, 10 min. All else the same. Yum!!!

amazingly easy. followed the most helpful positive review by sauteeing the onions with garlic. used olive oil instead of butter. also added the worcestshire sauce to meat mix and essentially followed the rest of the recipe. cooked covered with foil for 45 minutes and then uncovered for 15 minutes. i did not make the ketchup sauce as i can't stand that on top of my meatloaf. moist, full of flavor and so simple.

This was hands down the best meat loaf recipe I have ever made, I tweeked it a few ways. Sautéed the onions in butter first, added worserciar sauce to meat mix, cooked at 375 and covered it for half of the cook time. I wrote this one down and put it in the books! Thank you!!

Only changes I made was to sauté my onions in butter with garlic powder,  pepper and old bay seasoning. I then added it to the ground beef mixture.    For my sauce I used less brown sugar but also used a little barbecue sauce.  My husband liked it.  This recipe is a keeper.
I tried making meatloaf in the past but it was not good.

Quick & delicious. I did substitute a package of dry onion soup instead of seasoning and it was perfect! Thank you

This was awful. It tasted like soggy bread. You could barely taste the meat. And the sauce on top to keep the meat moist? Not only was it not needed (again: soggy bread), it also was too sweet and tasted too much like tomato.

This is absolutely outstanding. I would have never thought to use milk in my meatloaf. We’re dairy intolerant so we used almond milk instead of whole milk. I will hands down be making this again.

I followed what other people said and sauteed the onion and 1 clove of garlic in butter.  Like others, I also added 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce to the topping sauce.   I served this with onion and horseradish mashed potatoes and it was fantastic! Thanks for such a great recipe!

This was disappointing.  The meat was bland, and the topping was way too sweet--even after reducing the sugar by half.

The recipe turned out great! I added a little bit of bbq sauce to the meat mix with the prepared mustard. Then on the top I had spread some ketchup and bbq sauce as well. It was a hit with the family and I’ll be making this again in the future. I think next time I’ll put in in a loaf pan so it’s not as thin but other than that it was perfect. I changed it a little bit seeing as I didn’t have brown sugar so that was the only thing I left out.

It’s a great BASE RECIPE. Meaning I read it and knew it needed more and I wasn’t going to touch the glaze. I had zero interest in it and am not a fan of sweet meats so I adjusted it.

I added Italian bread crumbs, celery salt, pecarino Romano, salt, and pepper, and ground mustard. Came out great

I tried to gussy it up a bit by adding canned mushrooms and used canned mushroom soup in place of milk.  If you like mushrooms as we do, this was a great switch.  Like others I added Worcestershire sauce just because I always do.
Result - delish hot and then cold!

This is a great recipe and pretty close to what my mother use to make for family dinners. What I found to make it just right is replacing the katschup with a nice smokey BBQ sauce and using sweet onions (I prefer vidalia but all work). I also use the BBQ sauce on top instead of the brown sugar mixture. You still get the sweetness without it feeling like dessert. As well as  Italian bread crumbs. Hope this helps!! (Usually I serve it with cornbread green beans and sweet tea! Yummy)

I followed the suggestions about cooking the onions and using seasoned crumbs.  We enjoyed it but I think next time I will use a little less bread crumbs.

Excellent easy peasy recipe, My addition to it was Worcester Sauce, seasoned Italian bread crumbs, pepper flakes, I sauteed in olive oil diced onions and carrots added Parsley to it then added the mix beef. The top sauce is a hodgepodge mix with salsa, ketchup, mustard, brown sugar. I don't do measurements when I cook.

I tend to change recipes as I go but usually I do the exact recipe the first time just to see how it is. Honestly, I felt it was amazing. It was juicy and had so much flavor... So I didn't bother to make any changes.

I made two changes:
1.  1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce + 3/4 cup milk as substitute for 1 cup milk;
2.  Doubled the sauce for the topping.

My family LOVED it!  Enjoy.

Delicious! The kids loved it and we even left out brown sugar from glaze to lower sugar content! Baked in two rectangular loafs formed in a 9x13 pan with parchment paper to allow grease to drain around loaves. This cut down baking time to about 40ish minutes. Great recipe for adults and kids alike!

This recipe turned out great! I followed tips from other reviewers by sautéing the onions in butter and garlic and adding worcestershire sauce. Everyone loved it, although one diner suggested cutting some of the brown sugar next time (I didn’t mind it!).

This was awesome.  I used dry dark rye bread for bread crumbs 
because I didn't have the bread crumbs and it was so moist and tasty.

I added my usual paprika, garlic powder plus a little onion powder also, even though it already has chopped onion, just because I think it gives it an extra layer of flavor. Everybody loved it!

Themeat loaf was very good and turned out well.
I did not have any brown sugar so  I used mustard, ketchup,
and BBQ sauce for the topping.

It wasn't anything special and I wouldn't make it again. In fact, I just threw the recipe away.  I would like to see someone make something without adding or subtracting something.It isn't the same recipe so  it's hard to judge.

Simple recipe but very tasty.  I only had a pound of ground beef and so adjusted the recipe accordingly.  I didn’t have onion salt or garlic salt.  Replaced with garlic powder and seasoning salt.  The topping added a sweet and pungent flavor to the meatloaf.  Husband liked too!

If you have children, they may not like all of the onion.  I will try it next time without the onion.  Other than that it was delish!

This is very similar to the meatloaf our family has made for over 50 years. However, I can’t imagine how it would taste without the spices we always use. In the meat mixture we add 1/2 teaspoon ground sage. In the topping we add 1/4 t nutmeg and 1 t dry mustard. I replace these spices every six months for optimal flavor. Also, the original recipe calls for crushed saltine crackers instead breadcrumbs. I use the unsalted top crackers if I’ve added salt to the mixture. This makes wonderful sandwiches the next day!

Followed directions as stated and added 4 cloves of fresh garlic to meat mixture for additional flavor.  Taste of the meat was quite good and sauce added quite a bit of flavor to the recipe.  Served with a side potato dish and a nice Napa cab for a delightful dinner.

This is my very first review- a milestone!  The meatloaf was wonderful.  I ground  my own fresh local beef and was lucky enough to have fresh ground venison to add half and half.  I used whole  wheat bread crumbs that I also ground. Added garlic , Worchestire sauce and cardamom with the onions and left out the brown sugar.  So good!

I actually increase the brown sugar mixture just a little and I almost  double the ketchup, (since my men can drink ketchup lol), and add some to the hamburger as well as pouring on top. I also do not buy breadcrumbs so when making any kind of a meatloaf I will use old cereal, corn flakes, chex, or potato chips! Flavored potato chips are super yummy! My husband and boys LOVE THIS and have to have it with mashed potatoes.

If you use 1 lb of ground beef and 1/2 lb of ground pork, instead of all beef, it will be even more tasty.

BEST MEATLOAF EVER!! My husband doesn’t even like meatloaf, but after I made this he bragged about it to all the guys on his job site. I sautéed the onions and doubled the sauce (as other reviews recommended). I will absolutely be making this again!

Made this last night  and I will go back to the recipe I already have.    The amount of bread crumbs made it way to "bready" tasting.  I will eat the leftovers but won't make

Perfect name. So easy. One thing I did. I put a piece of parchment in the loaf pan. (If you have 2 pans...put the parchment in the one you’re going to use and put the other pan inside while you mix up the meat. Nice and neat. And, of course, easy.

I have made this for myself a few times now. I have never added milk to a loaf but I think its the trick to making it juicy and solid. No pockets between the burger. Only takes 5 to 10 min. at best before putting it in the oven. Best I have ever had.

Easy preparation. I use BBQ sauce to replace the ketchup and it’s even better.  It’s pretty nice when your teenagers rave about meatloaf!

Great tip,for all of you meatloaf makers, spray your pan with non-stick spray, then use about a 3"wide strip of parchment paper, long enough to hang over the ends of your pan.  When your loaf is ready to cut, run a knife along the long sides if needed, then just lift the whole thing out of the pan with the parchment "handles".

Very good.  I like the addition of the celery.  My Mom used to put peas or corn in the meatloaf too anything to make it go farther.

This is very much like the meatloaf I make. I don’t generally measure, but I probably only use 1/4 to 1/3 c of fresh bread crumbs, and enough milk to make soggy. My “secret ingredient” is about 1/2 tsp of sage, depending on how much meat there is. You will not taste “sage.” It just adds flavor. I also use seasoned salt, such as Lawry’s. I make extra topping, because it makes a great spread for your cold Meatloaf  sandwich. Ease up on the brown sugar to your taste.

My family of 8 loved this recipe! I doubled the recipe and used a 13×9 pan but kept the temp and time the same. I did half milk and half ketcup, I used italian bread crumbs and dijon mustard because that's what I had.

Nice recipe. In addition to the recommended ingredients, I added garlic powder, onion powder, dry mustard, a grated carrot, grated celery stalk, paprika,  adobo seasoning, sazon seasoning,  and Worcestershire sauce. Placed on a sheet pan as a 2/12 " thick log with oil-sprayed aluminum foil under it. Just delicious!

Added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and about 1/2 cup of fresh parsley and the meat came out perfect. Now onto the sauce which was unique and kind of the main reason why I did this recipe. Sauce was definitely a welcomed upgrade to the plain ketchup used on previous meatloafs but was a bit too sweet.

My new go to recipe for making meatloaf.  It is very easy and very delicious.  I have used several over the years.  When I lost my favorite one, I found this one on the internet and now it is my favorite meatloaf recipe.  I have been using this recipe for about 2 years now.  I have even used this recipe with substituted ground lamb and ground bison and it works well with both of them.  I usually up my ground beef, ground lamb, or ground bison to 2 lbs and I just adjust the recipe accordingly.  I even have my picky daughter eating this meatloaf.

Husband and I loved it several times last week and we are making again. Ended up using crushed gluten free cereal instead of bread crumbs. Used 90% lean and leftovers were noticeably drier texture. Gonna try 85% next time.

The only thing I did differently which was adding 1 more ingredient was: I added 2 Hard Boiled Eggs before baking the meatloaf. 

I am Spanish & I remember my Mom always making the meatloaf & putting in the hard boiled eggs.

It just gives it a little something different & Hubby seems to love it

This meatloaf recipe will make you famous..lol
I have made this many times and folks who don't get excited about meatloaf, love it. It begins when the delicious smell begins to waft from the oven as it bakes.  I use 1 lb of lean ground beef AND 1 lb of ground turkey. I like to mince the onions too before adding.  I bake for 1 hour and 15 mins

I've made hundreds of meat loaves over the years but this is by far the best I've ever made. It's simple, quick and extremely juicy without falling apart when you cut it. I used ground chuck (no idea what the fat content was but I'm guessing it was an 80/20 mix). The only changes were to add some Italian seasoning since I only had plain bread crumbs and I didn't make the ketchup/brown sugar glaze for health reasons and it doesn't appeal to me. I'm done with experimenting on new recipes. This is my go to from now on.

I added a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce to the meat and used tin foil to make clean up easier. My family loves this meatloaf!

This is by far my favorite meatloaf recipe, it's better than grandmas! The only change i make is adding an extra egg and another cup of bread crumbs which makes it a softer texture. There are never leftovers when I make this dish!

Made it 3 times already! 
I read some comments suggesting to add some worcestershire and I'm very glad I did. First two times used the Ketchup / Mustard sauce, last time used BBQ instead and I think we liked it better that way.
Perfect and quick meal!

The meatloaf was delicious and the recipe is awesome. 

If you’re going to complain it’s undercooked when thousands love this recipe, get your oven checked or cook it longer. 

If you think the sauce is too sweet before you even taste it, don’t add as much sugar.  Add sugar to taste.

I added a tablespoon of Worcester sauce and the meatloaf was a little loose, but it was absolutely delicious.  

Thank you for sharing!!!

I will definitely make this again! I've always made the standard onion soup recipe but this one was a nice change. Just the onions, salt and pepper make it flavorful. I was a little concerned about adding 1 cup of milk but it worked just fine. Moist and loaded with flavor, love the sweet topping.  I used crushed ritz crackers because I had no dry bread crumbs.

This was super simple to make and turned out great! I'll be making this often. I used 2lbs of organic ground beef, because that's the portion it came in from Costco. 
The meatloaf was very juicy and flavorful.

Yum! 
Some customizations: I used one  pound of ground beef and 1/2 pound of ground pork, both purchased at the local farmer's market, and half of the breadcrumbs that I used were from a ciabatta bread baked at a local dairy farm and purchased at the farmer's market, and the other half were 4C Seasoned Breadcrumbs.  I cut back on the amount of milk, and used just enough to keep the mixture moist.
This might have been the best meatloaf I've ever made.

changed: "In a separate small bowl, combine the brown sugar, mustard, and ketchup"...
...to: white sugar, no mustard, small can of tomato paste.  Mix well and pour over the meatloaf.

This recipe was excellent. Following the other reviews,  I added about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture with red pepper flakes and sauteed the onions in butter and fresh minced garlic until browned slightly and soft. I also doubled the sauce as I found it didn't make enough. Delicious!

I messed up and mixed the brown sugar and ketchup into the meat mixture.  Came out incredible!  I have also used deer meat.  Everyone that has tried it loves it.  I have tried it using honey BBQ sauce on top, but like the original brown sugar, ketchup, mustard topping best.

I made this recipe based on the ratings. When putting it in the oven I thought, hmm there's not much seasoning or flavor in this besides ground beef, onion and the toppings, I hope I added enough salt and pepper.  While it was cooking for an hour (it came out raw in the middle) I read some reviews and noticed everybody added something to this recipe. And you need to, it came out bland as hell. Gnarly is the first word that comes to mind. Waste of money and time.  Needs at least worcestershire sauce and garlic powder, and I regret not thinking of this before putting it in the oven. This recipe is a starting point, but on it's own it's gross.

I'm not a big meatloaf-lover, but I did really like this and will use this as my go-to recipe going forward. I made some changes after reading reviews, and I also improvised slightly. After reading reviews, I lightly sautéed the onions with garlic, and a few mushrooms and green pepper. I reduced the brown sugar to about 1 TBS but only because that's all I had. 
Here were my more improvisational changes and I'll share my final thoughts:
I only had 1 LB of grind beef so that's what I used
I used about 3/4 of a large yellow onion
I added 3 cloves of garlic, 5-6 chopped mushrooms, and 1/3 chopped green onion to the onions then lightly sautéed in butter. I used just under 1C of italian breadcrumbs and about 1/3 of that amount I included some crushed herb crackers which I think was a great touch in the end. I didn't have milk so I used low sodium chicken stock. 
For the sauce: I used slightly less than 2 TBS of dijon mustard (I would use the full amount next time though), and I used about 1 TBS of brown sugar based on some reviews. The sauce was actually amazing and way better than just ketchup alone. It was the perfect amount for 1 LB of ground beef so if I had more meat I would increase the portion. *My end result was not incredibly "meaty" since I had so much veggies and didn't follow the recipe exactly; BUT my husband LOVED it and he is a big meat eater. I will make this again - it was SUPER simple and tasted a bit different (better) than the traditional more dry, meaty meatloa

For the topping I use a small can of tomato sauce, brown sugar and mustard.  I use the back of a spoon to make a rim around the meatloaf so the sauce doesn't  all run off in the pan.  And a few strips of bacon on top of meatloaf adds another layer of flavor.

I doubled this recipe ...except the onion ...I used one and ended up picking half out of the pre mix..way too much onion and it should be finely minced so the meatloaf doesn't break apart

This was so yummy! I finally had meatloaf I actually like that I cooked. Sauteed the onions because me and my husband don't like raw onions and it added a great flavor. It's super simple and cheap and it's good the next day.

Made as is the first time, was fantastic.   One change I have made is to do a meatloaf mix (50/50 beef/pork). I have also found that since the sauce is so easy and tastes great, that I'll double it.   My main "home-style" go-to.

I used 1/2 c bread crumbs and a full cup of crushed   (not too well) French Fried onion rings. 
Only 1/2 amt. of diced onion
2 tbl. green relish
Only one tblsp. Brown sugar only 3/4 c milk 
Absolutely the best meatloaf ever.

I think the milk makes it a little too squishy, and that there’s too much mustard in the glaze. When I make these two tweaks, it’s a five star meatloaf in my book!

After trying  so many  meatloaf recipes,  finally, I found this one.  It is the best and so very simple.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

I didn't want to modify it, but I had to use honey instead of sugar and spread only  about 1/3 of the mixture on the loaf  It was delicious!!!  It gave it a "sweet & savory" finish!!!

This is basicly the recipe I have always used but I mix the brown sugar, ketchup and mustard in with the burger and all the other stuff.  I also never measure but just dump the stuff in by what looks like the right amount..lol  I am not a meatloaf fan but my family loves it.

Awesome recipe! I did have to substitute cane sugar instead of brown (whoops) but it turned out really well! As a college student, this recipe was really easy to make and not a hassle, great way to make something hearty without the intense labor of finding the right ingredients!

Most of the ingredients are staple items in our home.  Was very easy to make and family enjoyed.  Usually macaroni and cheese, collard greens and cornbread complete the meal.

I will start by saying I followed this recipe exactly except I did sauté the onion and added jalapeños for a little spice.  The meatloaf was mushy and did not hold together well. “If” I tried this recipe again I would reduce the breadcrumbs and add additional seasoning. I will keep looking for a recipe that does not need a lot of changes.

This was really good and really easy.   I used one pack of ground veal and one pack of ground beef and two eggs not one.   I also added worshester sauce to the recipe.   I threw in a few potatoes around the meat loaf and cooked at 375 for 1 hour.    Sorry I don’t have a pic but it was great.

Amazing with a few additions!! I have 3 boys so I use 1 lb of beef and 1 lb  of Buffalo. I also Brown the onion as suggested by other users and added 1 Tbs Worcestershire and 1Tbs liquid smoke with no change to to the other ingredients in the loaf. Since buffalo is not as fatty/moist I change the sauce a little. For starters I double the amount of sauce because we like extra to have on top of each slice. I also add 2 Tbs of mayonnaise and 2 Tbs barbecue sauce for additional flavor. After pouring over the meat I layer bacon over top and bake covered in a roasting pan for the first 30min then uncovered for the last 30min. If the bacon isn’t quite crispy enough I broil a few minutes until desired crispiness. The bacon adds extra fat so be sure to skim off Tom of sauce after done cooking before pouring over each piece.

I had been using another recipe for years my hubby didn't like it so I rarely made meatloaf. I looked online for recipes and tried a few. This recipe has been the best, however I make the sauce differently after the first time making it. The sauce is very sweet. I just add less brown sugar.
The meat is tender, juicy and has a sweetness from the sauce but leaving out some brown sugar makes this perfect. I recommend it just go easy on the sugar unless you like sweet meatloaf.

We like  this recipe but I followed the modification suggested by a reviewer to the topping to 1/3 cup ketchup, 1/3 cup BBQ sauce and 1 Tablespoon of regular mustard. I also slightly cooked the onions and add worchestire to the mix. I also cooked with foil on top for 45 minutes, removed and poured out the greasy fat, and then added the sauce and cooked uncovered for 30 minutes. Because of the modifications I only rated four stars.

I mistakenly put the brown sugar and ketchup in the meat mixture (sans mustard). I used 1/2 cup of milk instead of the full cup. Didn’t get a chance to take a picture because it was gone so fast! It was enjoyed by everyone!

I am a perfectionist when it comes to cooking. For years I have had trouble finding just the right ratio of wet and dry ingredients so my meatloaf would be either dry, greasy, or crumble. I did follow this recipe but not exact. I used it as a guide. I had used 3 pounds of ground Chuck it was a extremely lean meat so I made sure to season and add a little extra moisture to make sure the meatloaf didn't end up dry. I think this recipe is great. Some of these comments are ridiculous really it's not like you can't add extra seasoning. And if you think it's to soupy because of the extra milk it's called add more bread crumbs that's what I did. Turned out amazing. Way to go poster.

Instead of just beef I used meatloaf mix (beef, veal, pork). Plus I omitted the milk and used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce in lieu of  brown sugar, mustard and ketchup. Loved it... very close to Mom's!

This was an awesome recipe! The only things I did a little different was using dried chopped onions instead of hand chopping one. I, also, seasoned the meat as if I was seasoning hamburger meat. Then, I mixed the other ingredients after. It was so good...there weren't any left for leftovers.

I added Oregano leaves.  I wanted to make my own bread crumbs, but no time, used store bought (makes it slightly mushy), otherwise tastes good. 

Thank you!

My kids say they don't like it, but they gobble it up every time. I've learned to make extra sauce for the side and they love it. Also I've used dijon, brown, and yellow mustered when making this meat loaf, and I have found that I prefer either yellow or brown. The dijon was too pungent. It was still good every time though.

I did not use as much milk. maybe 1/4 cup. I used 2 eggs.  1
 &1.2 tsp. steakhouse seasoning and 1 tbsp fresh minced garlic and my homemade bread crumbs. I dry any heels from loaves and run them through the food processor. I used spicy brown mustard in the glaze and make extra. I also use 90% lean meat.

I like it. It’s different from the meatloaf my mom used to make with cream of mushroom soup. Next time I make it, I’ll add more spice since the meat it a tad under seasoned. My brother wanted a tomato/ catsup meatloaf, so hopefully he likes it.

I make this all the time and my family loves it. I do however make a few tweaks. I use 2 lbs of ground beef and caramelized onions (the caramelized onions are well worth the extra effort) seasoned bread crumbs and cook at 375 for an hour and fifteen minute. And I always triple the sauce recipe bevy we love to dip.  So good with mashed potatos or in a sandwich with the sauce on the bun. Yum!

This is a good recipe!  The meatloaf is very much how I have always made mine, but the sauce on top is just fantastic!  I always just used ketchup before.  From now on, I’ll make the topping sauce like this!  Very good!

My hubby loves this meatloaf. I followed the advice if other reviewers and sauteed the onion and 2 cloves of garlic in about a tablespoon of butter. I also added about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce  to the meatloaf mixture.

Awesome recipe! I made a few changes to make it a bit healthier. I used almond milk instead, 2 egg whites instead of 1 egg, honey instead of sugar with sugarfree ketchup. Tasted exactly the same

I’ll start off by saying that I made only 1 substitute, instead of beef I did ground turkey. I also did 1/2 an onion instead of a whole. I followed the recipe exactly aside from these two things and it turned out horrible. It was lacking flavor majorly and seemed wayyyy too moist. The sauce on top just tasted off as well. Not sure what went wrong but I would suggest anyone who follows this to start off with less milk and add more as needed when your mixing. I would also suggest some additional seasonings and an adjustment to the sauce on top. This recipe has potential with some adjustments but main thing is lack of flavor.

Making it for the second time today. My boyfriend absolutely loves this meatloaf and talks about it all the time to his friends at work. I double the recipe so he has lunch (meatloaf sandwiches and small plates) for work. I use panko instead of breadcrumbs and cayenne instead of chili powder in the sauce. I serve it with mashed potatoes with a little cheese and corn on the side. Delicious!

I made this last night for dinner. I followed the recipe except for a few changes. 1) I added minced garlic (1 clove) to my beef. 2) I had Ritz crackers (no breadcrumbs) in pantry so I crumbled that up and used it. 3)Only added ketchup for sauce (did not have any brown sugar). My family LOVED it. I am so glad I tried this recipe.

This recipe is so easy & delicious!!  I do add a little basil & seasoned salt (ILO regular salt) to the loaf but that's just because I love basil.  :)
Also, I add a little more brown sugar to the topping because, again, I love brown sugar!

5 stars for simplicity, but then I WAS talking as I prepped dinner and just carelessly mixed all the ingredients together (no glaze).  Cooked at 375 for 1 hr 20, then let it rest 10 minutes before cutting.  5 stars for flavor.  Put a little BBQ sauce on it & a side of roasted Yukon gold potatoes tossed in garlic & olive oil.  Didn’t have time to sauté the onions, but honestly an unnecessary step in my opinion.  Keep it truly EASY and don’t change a thing.

I followed the changes on the first review. Sauteed onions and garlic with butter.  I also changed the meat mince to a pork / veal mix and used Panko bread crumbs.
Switch out the brown sugar with a tablespoon of molasses (or golden syrup). Splash a teaspoon of Tobasco into the sauce to liven it up.
This recipe produced a delicious and balanced savoury flavour that will be on my home menu for a year to come or more!

I have made this several times. it is a nice easy recipe. made as is. my husband loved it. was not to greasy and the brown sugar mustard and ketchup topping gave it a nice tang. good recipe for those who are not into a lot of spices and want a quick and easy dinner.

Changed the recipe a little bit- instead of adding real onions (to me onions add no additional  flavor and are just a hassle) I added a packet of beefy onion soup mix, a few dashes of worstershire sauce as stated by other reviewers and used SEASONED bread crumbs and the meatloaf came out flavorful, moist and delicious. Will make again.  ????

I add a green bell pepper and saute it with the onion until they are soft before mixing everything together . Otherwise they will come out crunchy. I also add worcestershire sauce and/or A1 sauce to both the meat and the topping. Just a little bit. It tastes much better.

I made this but did not add milk! And I am glad that I did not. We like a more dry/solid meatloaf. Turned out great! I want to try this with ground chicken!

Good recipe; added half chub off Italian sausage. Thought one cup of milk would make the mixture too loose; actually, was more dense. Used crackers, diced green pepper and onion. DH said dish is tasty.

Very good overall, but my family and I agree that the meat mixture could use more flavor .   Next time I'll add more spices.   The sauce on top was great!

It was okay, very moist.  Didn't put steak sauce on top and I will never again take the suggestion of mixing bread crumbs and milk separately.  The chunks of bread crumbs were frowned upon by family.

This is wonderful. Simple recipe. Quick to prepare. I made “meatloaf muffins” in my muffin pan and reduced the cooking time to 45 minutes. Turned out juicy and flavorful. Will be making it again.

This is fail proof! I was using my phone to prepare this. My phone continued to cut off so I got tired of looking at it. The last thing I read was "mix all ingredients together" so i did. As we all know I was only suppose to mix some ingredients into the loaf, and the rest for a sauce. When I realized my error, I added an extra egg, and let it cook for a bit longer. It was delicious. My first meatloaf was really tasty. Also, I didn't have whole milk, I had almond milk! It still rocked!

I used bacon wrapped jalapeño potato chips instead of bread crumbs (amazing flavor added) otherwise super easy and flavorful. Next time I am going to try putting a layer of sauce in the middle for my husband who feels that the only thing it is missing is sauce throughout it just on top:)

I have a family of 6 (4boys) and they tear this dish up! It’s a very simple and incredibly easy meal. I love to fall back on this recipe on my lazy after work days. I think it’s a basic meatloaf recipe that if your new to meatloaf, this is the best one to start with. You can tweak it to your preferences later.

Excellent results. As suggested by others, I sauteed the onion with 2 teaspoons crushed garlic before adding and also put in one tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the beef.  I used Stubbs BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. Meatloaf came out nicely firm rather than crumbly. I used Panko breadcrumbs. My pan was a Williams-Sonoma Goldtone meatloaf pan with lift out tray. Finished off with a bottle of Kendall-Jackson Pinot Noir and a Magnum Mini ice cream bar for dessert.

I have been making this recipe for months now. My husband doesn't even like meatloaf, but he loves this meatloaf! So does my mom, my kids love it, and I could not be happier that I found this. It is important to use high-quality low fat ground beef in order to get the desired result. If this recipe is followed exactly, it is amazing! Every time I make it, my mom begs me to send her leftovers. My husband is in the car business and works long hours. He has brought left-overs to co-workers just to show off! Thank you so much for sharing this. I make it at least once every two weeks. I never leave reviews, but I just had to for this recipe.

Like other commenters, I also doubled the ketchup (probably could have used just a little bit less) and browned the onions. Turned out great!

Delicious! Super moist and flavorful. I sautéed the onion with butter and garlic before adding it to the meat mixture, which I think makes a big difference - that softens the bite on the onion. I also doubled the sauce. Super yummy - I will definitely make this again.

This is such a delicious simple meatloaf recipe!! The only change that I make is add a little more ketchup to the topping to cut down on the mustard taste.

I used 3 pounds of ground beef 80/20. I soaked  1 pint of 1% milk and  1 sleeve of saltine crackers together. I added  1 cup of chopped onions, green bell pepper,red bell pepper and parsley. I seasoned with powder roasted garlic, slap your mama, 2 eggs and  some curry powder. I mixed it all up and shaped it into a 13x9 inch  oiled pan. I baked it for 1 hour at 350. I poured off the fat and poured  brown gravy over the top and baked it for 30 more minutes. I served the finished dish with white fluffy rice and  steamed broccoli florets. YUMMY!!!

The meatloaf was way uncooked by 1 hour. I had to cook an additional amount of time. The flavor was fantastic but only giving it 3 stars because it fell apart trying to get it out of the pan. I had to spoon it out

My first meatloaf. Made with ground turkey and Italian sausage, red onion (not sautéed as some suggested, I liked the texture better) and mushroom, both diced fine, seasoned Italian bread crumbs, and bunches of spices. Covered for first 45 minutes of cooking in glass dish, then cooked another 15 uncovered, pouring out extra liquid in between. I also made my own sauce mix with BBQ sauce, Worcestshire, A1 and a little horseradish sauce, don’t like too sweet, gave it a little kick. I put a layer down the center of the loaf too. Yum.

I found the recipe delicious, but a little bland. I will make it again & take some hints from other reviews as sautéing the onions with some garlic & adding worchesshire  sauce.

Mmm.  Mine turned out so tasty, and MOIST.  I used a trick I found on another meatloaf recipe.  Place a pan of water under the meatloaf.  Just an inch or less, so it heats quickly and steams.  Makes all the difference.  Meatloaf is very moist and tender.  Oh also I added a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to the sauce, to level out the sugar a little.  But then I like vinegar in a lot of my sauces.  Deliciosio!

Didn't quite stick to the recipe, as we had more ground beef than the recipe called for.  But doubling the ingredients helped make a huge meatloaf that EVERYONE loved!  Even people who don't like onions liked it.  They said it was the best meatloaf they ever had with onions in it.  Definitely going to make this again!  :)

I am always looking for different types of meat loaf recipes. This one by far is my favorite. I followed this recipe exactly and there was enough that I froze a loaf for dinner next week. I absolutely love the toppings. I wasn’t sure about the milk but it turned out great( I generally use water).

This is the first time I tried this and definitely not the last!  I followed the suggestions of other reviews-cooked the onions in butter and garlic until softened, added Worcestershire sauce, and used seasoned bread crumbs. I should have made a second one!  My family loved this!

I would recommend baking without the ketchup mixture first then add mixture and bake another 10 mins. Also I tripled the ketchup in the recipe.

Made it. Used ONE teaspoon brown sugar [any meat loaf recipe asking more I think is suspect as error or typo!!]. Used crushed (pureed) tomatoes, added dash of worcestershire sauce & abt 1 tsp dijon mustard to this mix for topping. No bread crumbs so used crushed crackers mix (-4 roasted  onion flavored , 3-herb/spice mix and 3 seasalt&pepper crushed crackers plus some panko [all gluten free as it happens]. Added 2 tablespoons tomato puree to meat mix plus S&P & 1 grated carrot plus celery powder. No milk so used 1/4 c 5% plus bit of water. Cooked 45 mins then removed from oven to add more of the tomato sauce topping. Back to oven for 15 (turned oven off after 5 mins & let sit in oven for another 10). It was good but next time may add a bit more 'zing'.

A few changes... Used 1/2 an onion minced. Sauteed the onions with minced garlic and butter. Used half the amount of salt and pepper. Used 1 lb of venison with .5 lb pork. For sauce I used can of tomato sauce with 2T brown sugar and 1t Worcestershire sauce. I ignored the mustard/ketchup bit. Any saying sauce is too sweet it is not the brown sugar. It is the ketchup with the brown sugar as ketchup already has so much sugar in it so mixing the 2 is overkill. That is usually how I make my sauce. I also don't put the sauce on top until halfway through cooktime and put a sheet of foil on top for remaining half hour. Wanted to try a twist on my meatloaf and this recipe was a great addition with some tweaking.

Decent recipe but omit the brown sugar unless you want your dinner tasting like a dessert, if you really want to kick this up try my variation, double the ketchup and add just a couple drops of your favorite hot sauce (tabasco, chalula, ect) for the topping. Add Worcestershire sauce 3-4 teaspoons, use stove top stuffing instead of bread crumbs. Mix 1-2 to 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese and a half cup Kraft parmesan cheese or freshly grated real parmesan. Other tips to make it easy if you hate chopping and prepping stuff like i do is use dried onion flakes instead of cutting your own....these are amazing because they soak up tons of yummy juices and end up being just as good as sauteed onions with out the hassle, and using the pre packaged minced garlic, saves time and money as well, about a tablespoon.....or 2...or 3 or more of you really like garlic...lol...another alternative I've used for the topping and is always a hit, instead of ketchup use your favorite bbq sauce. Another ingredient i use once in a while is some bacon crumbles, especially if I've got some Apple wood smoked bacon....that's especially Yummy with the bbq sauce topping. Last suggestion, if you've got the patience and the equipment....instead of the oven.....try letting your creation come to life in a smoker....takes hours but worth the wait!

This isn’t a fancy recipe, but it’s my daughter’s favorite. It’s great comfort food. I do split it into to loaf pans so I can put 1 up in my freezer. I recommend.

Made this many times!  I use Italian Panko bread crumbs and usually triple the recipe with a ratio of 2/1 ground chuck and ground turkey.  My husband will eat 1/2 a loaf at a sitting, it's his favorite.

This recipe was easy to follow and fantastic!  I am not a huge meatloaf love but my husband is and he said it was the best meatloaf ever and definitely keeper!  I did saute the onions and garlic and kept some of the sauce for serving.   

Excellent recipe!

This meatloaf is so easy and it turned out perfectly! I sauteed the onion in butter & garlic as suggested, and added some Worcestershire to the mixture as well. Just lovely! I am planning to make it again tonight!

Fantastic meatloaf recipe. I cook this every month for my husband. The only critique I have is I usually make 2 pounds of this meatloaf, and the recipe calls for 1 and 1/4 egg and 2 is actually needed. But that might just be personal preference. If I use less than 2 the meatloaf ends up being a little dry. Regardless thank you for making a recipe I have used for years!

My husband loves meatloaf and I never had it growing up, so naturally I looked for an easy recipe. I’ve made some minor tweaks that have just stepped up the recipe a bit for us. I use Italian bread crumbs and spicy brown mustard. Otherwise, the recipe is exactly the same!! Love it!

Turned out fantastic. I doubled the meat and therefore doubled all the other ingredients as well. I did use a little bit less brown sugar in the sauce and I think it would be good without any added sugar as well.
To the meat mixture I added sauteed onions and garlic, a handful of cheese, a splash Worcestershire sauce and a bunch of spices.
I have never had a meatloaf this moist and juicy before, it was bursting with flavor. Definitely husband and toddler approved :) 
Will make it again

This turned out great!!  It was so easy to make. I made some substitutions since we are gluten free, but still good.  We made it with ground turkey and cornflake crumbs in place of bread crumbs.  I sautéed the onions with garlic as many had suggested. The glaze for the top was delicious.  I usually don’t make meatloaf because the recipes I find call for all kinds of different ingredients.  This was so simple.  I think it will be making a regular appearance in the line up.

My son loves it. He asked for a second which was very rare.  I sauteed the onions, sweet peppers and garlic with butter. I excluded the mustard Worchester sauce and brown sugar. I add a layer of barbecue sauce on the top.

My family loved this meatloaf! I sautéed the onions to soften them before adding them to the mixture and used garlic salt with parsley and a pinch of kosher salt. I did not have brown sugar so I mixed molasses with white sugar & water. along with the ketchup and mustard. It came out great!  I served  the meatloaf with the following sides:italian green beans with potatoes and mini corn cobs.

I actually love meatloaf because when you don't know what food to cook thats quick and easy meatloaf is the #1 go to . Also, it isn't expensive either because all you need is ground beef, ketchup,mjustard,salt&pepper, bread crumbs or cracker, 1 egg and garlic. I know a lot of people put BBQ sauce or spaghetti sauce on top of their meatloaf but, I suggest they put nothing on top of the meatloaf it just taste better to me thats one of the things I would change about how people make their meatloaf. The best side dish to go with meatloaf would be Garlic red potatoes or even regular fresh potatoes and some dinner rolls would just make the meal more amazing. Lastly, I recommended meatloaf when your trying to make something quick that taste good at the same time.

I've made this recipie many times now and everyone loves it! I follow the recipe with 2 minor change saute onions with 1-2 cloves garlic.  Make in a silicone muffin pan.  To do this roll the meat mixture into about 2 inch diameter balls and bake for about 40 mins.  It's a little more work but does it ever freeze nicely for a quick meal later. Plus it's a perfect portion size and my SO loves to call them "man muffins"

The best meatloaf recipe we’ve ever tried! Only changes i made were i didnt add onion (because i didn’t have any), and i added a little bit of honey mustard and McCormick steahouse onion burger seasoning to the meat. Even our 2 year old devoured it.

This was great! Didn’t give five stars because I saw another recipe from Bake at midnight.com whichever I used to make some changes to this one. I added green pepper, used three eggs, 6 soda biscuits and some cheddar cheese. Also used 1 tsp mustard and quarter cup sugar and ketchup. This was bomb and my non beef husband gave me a pretty good so will be making this again!

I followed the recipe, added some Worcestershire sauce and garlic salt and then put in a touch more brown sugar in the glaze and it turned out amazing!  I'm sure if you follow the recipe it will still turn out amazing...it was really easy too.

I always use this recipe. My family loves it. My only changes are to saute the onions with some garlic and a bell pepper, if I have one. Last time I added the Worcestershire sauce. 

Always comes out great.

This is the second time I’ve made this and I love it. My boyfriend gave it two enthusiastic thumbs up! It was very moist and very tasty but it did not cook fully at one hour and I used less than the amount of meat called for. Next time, I will sauté the onions, add a little Worcestershire. I will also reduce the amount of milk used next time. It was just a tad too much.

The milk was the perfect ingredient to the perfect meatloaf! The only adjustment was using Saltine Cramer crumbs instead of bread crumbs. After making this the first time and finding it a bit oily, I now shape the mix into a loaf (no need for a loaf pan!) and just put it on a cookie sheet sprayed with Coconut oil to cut the grease down to a bare minimum, it was still the moistest meatloaf we’ve ever had! This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe is really good.  It always turns out moist and flavourful made just as the recipe is written.  The sweet and slightly tangy glaze along with the onion in the meatloaf makes it a keeper for us.  It is easy to make and one nice feature is that it holds its shape very well so you can bake it in about any type of dish or pan.  Serve with mashed potatoes or mac 'n cheese and your favourite salad and you have a full comfort food meal.

This was the first time I have ever made a meatloaf. I followed the recipe but added 2 tbs of garlic salt and 2 tbs of Worcestershire sauce to the meat and doubled the ketchup mix as the other reviews suggested. I also covered the pan with foil. It turned out Great my husband loved it so I will be fixing again.

I was needing some warm comfort food. Meatloaf came to mind. I'm thrilled I chose this recipe. It was simple and truly delicious. The only thing I did different was  I swapped the ketchup for steak sauce and added minced garlic. I prefer earthy and savory.  I served it with  mashed mini yellow butter potatoes and fresh steamed green beans. Next time I'm going to try a little less milk and 1 tablespoon of the brown sugar. I'm thinking too I might carameliz the onions before adding to the mixture. Overall, a  wonderful recipe for home cooked comfort food!

This is the first meat loaf I've ever made, it turned out well.  I  modified the recipe by adding bell pepper which I sauteed with the onions before adding to the mixture.  I made extra ketchup topping  but will probably just double it next time, as we like a lot of ketchup anyway. I used garlic herb breadcrumbs I already had, next time I'll try with Italian flavored breadcrumbs instead. 
It wasn't quiet as firm as I think it should be, so going to read more reviews and see how to remedy that, more egg maybe?

It was ok, but next time I'd cut down on the bread crumbs and put less than half of the onion. Onion was the prevailing flavor.

I actually use this recipe to make venison meatloaf. The only change I make is cutting the milk to 1/2. Turns out delicious and is a hit every time!

This was the best tasting meatloaf I’ve ever had. After skimming the comments, the only changes I made were sautéing the onion a few minutes before adding them in and doubling the ketchup mixture that goes over the meatloaf (and cutting down on the mustard just a bit). I also used 2 lbs of lean ground beef and the ingredient ratios were still good. Excellent end result; very flavorful. Goes well with mashed golden potatoes. Husband loved it too.

I have made this recipe several times- I’ve used ground beef but also ground turkey and ground lamb. I personally love mustard so I didn’t change anything about the sauce. I use seasoned bread crumbs in place of plain, green onion (and a lot less) in place of a regular onion. I add a splash of Worcestershire sauce. I serve with pan roasted veggies and a seasoned long grain rice. This recipe is part of my regular meal rotation! It’s always good!!

This is my favorite meatloaf recipe. The only thing different that I do is fry the onions first. It adds to the flavor and keeps the moisture down. My family loves it.

I did adapt the recipe based on what I had on hand and what other reviewers said. Sauteed garlic and onion. Didn't have Worchestershire - so used a bit of A-I. Thanks for a great recipe!

I created an account just so I can review this meatloaf recipe. It was AMAZINGLY GOOD! Anyone would like this meatloaf. I’ve made many many meatloafs and this is my favorite. I accidentally put the whole glaze sauce into the meatloaf, and made more to put on top . I will make it like that next time it was great.

I've made this twice now. I'm happy to have a recipe that I can mold into shape inside a flat, glass dish. For decades, I've used a glass "meatloaf" pan, only to have it swimming in fat. The 2nd time, I added 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup salsa....also good and added a bit of interest. Both versions quite good. Thanks for the recipe and "correcting" my decades-old behavior. hahaha Old dogs DO learn new tricks.

I didn’t add the brown sugar and I added  a clove of minced garlic. Kind of plain, but pretty good.

This recipe is my go-to for home cooking comfort food. Sometimes I make it with ground turkey and garlic& herb breadcrumbs (cooked roughly the same amount of time) and it always comes out phenomenal.

We made this because it had a lot of reviews and rated well.  This was the worst meatloaf I've ever had.  Save yourself the time and money with the ingredients other than that meat.  Just throw the mean in a pan and cook it and you'll accomplish the same results.  It was incredibly bland.  If you hate mustard like I do, do not add it to the ketchup mixture because that's what you'll taste.

Excellent!  Very moist and flavorful! I omitted the brown brown sugar in the mixture for the top, and just used ketchup and Dijon mustard, as we prefer a less sweet version.  This was so delicious, and very moist.  This will be my go-to meatloaf recipe!

My family enjoyed this one a lot! Easy to make and quick. I did precook the onions with some garlic and add some Worcestershire sauce to the meat mix as suggested by many and it worked out great. Thanks for the recipe.

When I tried to make it, I found that 1 cup of milk was a bit too much.  Otherwise, it tasted pretty well.  Though it was a little too mushy.  Other than that, it was amazing.

Hands down best meatloaf I’ve ever made. I have made fancy meatloaf recipes from the food network website to meatloaf using a Lipton onion packet and I have finally found my go to meatloaf recipe.I followed the suggestions of other reviewers by adding worsterchire to the meat mixture and sautéing the onions with a minced clove of garlic in some butter. I also used a mixture of ground beef, ground pork, and ground veal. My husband loved it. It’s the first time he’s ever requested that I make meatloaf more often. He never eats left overs but he insisted on eating this meatloaf as leftovers for the next two days.

This is a wonderful recipe! Easy to make and delicious. I sautéed the onions and added carrots and put these in the mixture and it was amazing. However,  I needed to cook it for about 15 minutes more.

My husband and I could NEVER agree on a meatloaf recipe we both could agree on. This one has been it for several years now! Our daughter now requests it anytime she comes to visit! I always make two when I make it to freeze one unbaked in freezer paper for a meal for us or a meal to take to someone who needs one. A staple in my kitchen now!

Quick, easy and oh so delicious!!!  This recipe makes a very moist and tasty meatloaf!  Follow the directions as written, and you'll have a great go to meatloaf recipe.  I agree with some of the others.......please rate THIS recipe.  When you start adding this, that, browning, adding turkey meat, celery, etc. you are changing the recipe completely.  Please give the author of the recipe the courtesy of making and rating THEIR recipe.  When you change everything, it becomes your recipe.  The idea is make and rate this recipe, not make your own recipe and pick this one apart.

This is a great recipe! I altered it just a little, I added a teaspoon of fresh minced garlic and two teaspoons of an organic adobo to give it a little more flavor. My family loved it ! My 11 yr old couldn’t get enough!

It was pretty good. I’m not a big fan of mustard, but I know mixing it with other ingredients sometimes you can’t hardly taste it. That wasn’t the case with this. That was the only downfall for me. I would make it again for sure without mustard! Lol ??

I made it exactly as the recipe suggested except I softened the onions in a pan first.   It was very soggy.   I had to slice it and put it in a pan to dry and cook off some of the moisture.

I've made this recipe quite a bit. It's makes an excellent meatloaf. The Heinz 57 sauce adds a nice touch to the flavor. I use a brown sugar, mustard, and ketchup mix  for the final touch to top  it off.

I followed your directions as you put them. I preheated the oven for half an hour to make sure it would cook thoroughly. I even put holes inbetween so that the meat would cook thoroughly, after an hour and fourty-five minutes of cooking the meatloaf, it ended up in the trash. This recipe is no good.

Just like it says, quick, easy and delicious. I didn't have ketchup or milk, so I substituted a small amount of steak sauce and used 1/2 & 1/2.  Still came out awesome!  Thank you!

Excellent recipe and sauce! I did add shredded carrot and potato. The sauce is amazingly simple and delicious. I didn’t have enough regular mustard so I used Dijon in replacement and it was perfect.

Everyone seemed to like this meatloaf. I made the suggested changes, onion, garlic and Worcestershire sauce. I suppose they had an effect, but I think the modification I will make next time is to the milk. I thought adding milk seemed quite odd, and I think I was right. The milk seems like it contributes to a sort of mooshy texture, which does not appeal to me. I'll make this again, but will cut back on the milk, or skip it entirely.

Ignored makin' the sauce since me n' dad just use ketchup for that. 

It's really good but definitely use seasoned salt and some garlic herb dash, helps make it even better.

Tried this last night and it was awesome! The only change I made was instead of bread crumbs, I substituted pre-cooked white rice, as I have to eat gluten free.

This meatloaf was a simple recipe to follow. However it is very plain, it's a great base for someone to get creative with! I followed to advice from previous comments adding Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture(just eyeballed it, maybe about 2.5tbsp). I also added garlic powder, basil, parsley, thyme, and oregano. I mixed in Italian seasoning with my bread crumbs. I caramelized the onions in butter and garlic before adding to meat mixture as well. I also added some more cheddar cheese, my family always made it like this. For the sauce I used ketchup, yellow mustard, Worcestershire, brown sugar, and Sweet Baby Rays BBQ. I didn't measure out anything, just mixed until it tasted good, living on the edge a little. I lined the glass cookware in tin foil which made for a very easy cleanup and also allowed me to take the meatloaf out of the pan for easier slicing. I added about 20 minutes to the cooktime labeled in the recipe to ensure a fully cooked meatloaf. The time ended up being perfect! I made zucchini and squash as a side, half in the oven with a garlic and herb steak seasoning and olive oil, half sauteed on the stove with garlic, onion powder, and the same seasoning. I also served it with Knorr's shell noodle packet. This was my first time making meatloaf so I was very nervous when my boyfriend's friend came unexpectedly for dinner. They both LOVED it and even went back for more! Great recipe and will definitely be making it again!!

the milk turned the breadcrumbs to mush and left the loaf with a disagreeable taste and consistency.  The sauce on top is only for those who like sweetness with their meat.  Apologies to the 7000 who liked it.  I didn't.

Turned out great!! The only thing I did differently is I sautéed the onions in a little olive oil before I added them to the mixture. Super tasty!!

Very good enchiladas, I will make again but will probably add more heat. I'm thinking I will add a can of Rotel  with habaneros to the meat mix.

Easy recipe to follow and it turned out delicious! I used 2 pounds of meat and doubled the topping mixture. I also used spicy mustard instead of the regular kind. I added green bell peppers to the meat. Cooked for 1 hour and 15 minutes in a pan lined with foil. It was a hit!

Super easy recipe with ingredients I usually have on hand. I followed others suggestions to add 1 tbsp Worcestershire to the ground beef. Also I cooked the onion in a little butter before adding it to the beef mixture. I had a yellow pepper on hand so I diced it up and cooked it with the onion. I doubled the sauce but was skimpy with the mustard. I used spicy ketchup which gave it a nice kick. The final product was a flavourful juicy meatloaf

I sautéed onions with butter and garlic like it was suggested. I also added Worcestershire because it just makes everything better. I followed everything else exactly like the recipe said. It was a little too moist, so next time I will cook 10-20 minutes longer, or use a 90/10 ground beef instead of 80/20. It was a really great meatloaf.

Have made this meatloaf a few times now my family loves it and even ask me for it. I have made a few changes I reduced the amount of brown sugar in the sauce cause we found it too sweet I also add mushrooms and depending on the day greenpepper and sometimes celery, I also cube some hard cheese and add it to the meat mixture!!

The past few years my husband has been making his moms meatloaf recipe which uses applesauce instead of egg. It’s good, but nothing special. This recipe is special. My husband also has approved it. I used 1 1/2 lb ground beef, 1 egg, 1/2 on onion, 1/2 a green pepper, bread crumbs, garlic powder, milk, salt and pepper. I did NOT sauté my onions and don’t feel they need it. I just dice them super fine. I made the top sauce as is and it is so good!  Baked at 350 for an hour then 425 for about 15minutes to get the outside nice and dark. Delicious!! We will be using this instead of my mother-in-laws recipe from now on.

Made this meatloaf as recipe called for, but did sauté the onions in butter and minced garlic.  Once done, I added them to the meat and mixed everything together, adding 1 tbs of Worcestershire sauce.  Baked in the oven in a 13x9 glass pan for 60 mins.  Meat was very moist, maybe even too moist as it didn't have texture.  I definitely didn't like the sauce topping.  It made the dish too sweet and while baking, it smelled like I was baking hot dogs - yuk.  My mom's meatloaf never had a sauce topping so perhaps Im not accustomed to the idea.  It also makes a lot of food so I probably won't make this one again.

It had entirely way too much onion. Like the onion to meat ratio was the same. Next time I’ll be using 1/2 cup or less of chopped onions!

I made this recipe with a few changes.  I am not a fan of a sweet topping so I left it bare and made a brown mushroom gravy.  I also used 1 pound of ground beef and a half pound of brats.  My husband wants this dish again soon!

Most amazing meatloaf ever. Only things I changed is no onions only cuz the hubby and offspring hate onions. Added the Worcester and omitted the sauce. The pains like just ketchup. But it was so good the hubby took it for 2 following days to work.  
P. S.  He has got to be the most picky eater but he loves this recipe so much

I used this recipe as a base for my own creation. I added green and red peppers as well as 2 T of Worcestershire sauce. then placed the in a cupcake pan because i was unable o find my loaf pan. which i find cooks them alot quicker so i will stick to that. for my topping i used ketchup in a small sauce pan heated it up and added brown sugar. Placed it on top of the meat loaves half way through.

I've made this meatloaf many times and it is always a success. I just add a little whorshire sauce to the topping. In my opinion I'd never make any other meatloaf than this one...and it doesn't need any Tweeting

I felt it was too soupy.  I didn’t care for this at all. I’d have preferred just putting BBQ sauce on the top.

Meatloaf is one of my husband’s favorite dishes.  I’ve never had a set recipe.  I made this the first time and I got carried away just putting all the ingredients in the bowl, I mixed it all together and then I read the instructions.  I had put the topping in the body. So I put it in the pan and then made the sauce again and put it on top. My husband raved over it. So I made it for friends this week. This time I used a beef/veal/pork mixture and it was even better. The loaf does not maintain much of a solid slice, but the consensus was that it was so good no one cared. My friend raved to his wife about it all the way home.

This is the BEST meatloaf recipe I've ever made! I LOVE The tangy sauce for the top. I substitute old fashioned oats for the bread crumbs and use maybe a quarter cup of diced Vidalia onion for a milder flavor. I have also used a combination of ground beef and ground pork to make  this meatloaf....  SO VERSATILE and SO DELICIOUS!!

It's easy and tastes great! I used about 2 pounds of beef and used a small glass casserole dish. I just upped the ketchup to a half cup.

This was only my second time making meatloaf, believe it or not. I love meatloaf too!!! This was the first recipe that popped up on google, so I gave it a try. I followed the recipe to a T and it was paradise by the dashboard lights!!! I was a little apprehensive about the brown sugar, but it was a nice touch. OK... by accident I added a pinch of garlic powder, ssshhh. This is a quick and easy recipe with a lot of flavor I will stick with!!!

Husband approved! I did follow others and added Worcestershire sauce and sautéed onions in butter. Also added 2 tablespoons of parsley flakes. Halved the milk since I used 85% ground beef. 1/2c breadcrumbs and 1/2c panko, only because I ran out of breadcrumbs. Added garlic powder, onion powder, mushroom powder, and chicken bouillon powder. Excellent. Perfect amount of soft-ness. Thanks!

So delicious.  I'm almost 40 and this was my first time making meatloaf. I added adobo, sautéed onions and a few slivers of green pepper along with all the ingredients.  I also added a bit of garlic powder and Italian seasoning. I followed other reviews and cut the mustard in half and use 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar as opposed to 2.  BTW I was going to skip the topping sauce as I didn't have brown sugar but it made allllllll the difference. It came out super moist and yummy. My teenage picky eater loved it and had 3 servings. Next time I will add a few more veggies to see. Thank u!

I found it quite mushy before cooking - too wet so I added 1/2 lb of ground lamb. I also cooked the onions before adding to meat and added bit of dried parsley and cayenne. As well I am a fan of HP sauce so substituted a bit of HP for the sweeter ketchup (3:1 ketchup/HP).  Made 3 small loaves.

This meat loaf has to cook way more than an hour to ensure the middle wasn't raw. It was sooo oily and leaked all over my oven and burned. Make sure you cook this is a large enough pan so it doesn't even come close to the edges. I'm really unimpressed, not only did my oven burn like crazy but it wasn't very good. Kind of flavorless and too sweet.

I used 2 pounds of ground round and increased the other ingredients accordingly.

It was still raw in some places after cooking, covered in foil, for an hour. I uncovered it so it would get a little brown on top and baked it for an additional 30 minutes.

My husband gave it a big thumbs up.

This was pretty good, easy and had all of the ingredients on hand. I added a Tablespoon of Worchestshire sauce, and all I had were dry onions. I liked the consistency, but it needed more flavor. I'm not sure what to add to make it more flavorful. Any suggestions?

I added some worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture, and did not have a fresh onion at the time so used dried onion flakes, also added a little salt, pepper and Italian seasoning to the meat mixture --- the entire family loved it - everyone had seconds.  very easy to make and a definite hit!

First time making meatloaf and this recipe reminded me exactly how my mom used to make it! I doubled to sauce for the top and added more garlic. Turned out juicy, flavorful, and disappeared withing minutes!

Make sure you chop the onions very fine - and if you put less ground beef in than the recipe calls for be sure to reduce the amount of milk you add.

This recipe is amazing! Every person who tried the meatloaf loved it.  When I make it I use the exact products that the recipe requires. The only thing I do differently  is: instead of chopping the onion I puree it with eggs and milk using stick blender.

I followed the recipe as stated and the only thing I would change was the amount of brown sugar used. It was a little too sweet for my liking. Otherwise it was a nice and easy to make and the cook time was right on.

Loved this meatloaf! Only changes I made were sauteeing the onions ahead of time (my 8yr old doesn't like onion, so I mask them in whatever she eats by precooking and cutting very fine), and I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the meat. 
I normally make a ton of changes to even your best recipes, and while I was apprehensive about the sugar in the ketchup... this stuff is delicious as is. 
Thanks so much for the recipe!

Nothing special about this. No flavor to the meat; only when taking a bite with the saucy topping.

Made a few tweaks per other reviewers by sautéing the onions beforehand. I didn’t have brown sugar so added a little white sugar, packet of duck sauce and spicy Chinese mustard (major improv here). Sauce had a little kick but was delish. Baked in oversized muffin tins for about 50 min (was only about 1lb of meat). Came out great!

I am literally sitting here eating this right now. I only made a few modifications based on all of the reviews I was reading. 
1. I diced mushrooms (because I had a handful left needing a home) and sauteed them along with the onions in a little butter before adding to the meat mixture. 
2. I doubled the topping sauce while cutting back slightly on the mustard. 

It is delicious and moist! this is my new Go-To meatloaf! I served with steak fries as a compromise with my kids for the mushrooms and onions they caught me adding.

Variation that my super picky 4 yr old and toddler will actually eat is using 2.5 tablespoons of brown sugar rather than regular sugar, using only 1 tablespoon of mustard rather than the two called for, using a whole sleeve of whole wheat Ritz crackers rather than bread, and using only about 2/3 of a large egg rather than a whole one. I have made it about a dozen times sometimes with less mustard, sometimes with more sugar, sometimes with the amount of egg called for, and sometimes with more ketchup, but the variation above actually has my super picky 4 year old requesting meatlove and yes she really does call it that.

This is my go-to meatloaf recipe. I add McCormick meatloaf mix packet and Worcestershire sauce to the meat for an added depth of flavor, but the real star of this recipe is the ketchup/mustard/sugar sauce on top. Super easy and delicious!

Easy versatile and delicious! My dear granddaughter can’t have eggs. My substitutions; Omitted the egg, added a tablespoon of Worcestershire to the meat and to the sauce. The whole family absolutely devoured it! I will be making this again for sure! Thanks so much!

Very easy prep and delicious meatloaf!! My family and I like a heartier meatloaf, so I reduced the onion, milk and bread crumbs to 1/3 cup each. We love the sauce so much I usually almost double it. When we eat the meatloaf, we spread the leftover sauce on the rest of our slice, yum! I've substituted crushed corn flakes to make the meatloaf gluten free. It's delicious with or without gluten!

This was a great recipe. I've always disliked meatloaf---Why I decided to make it the other night, I have no clue but this will now be a staple in our house. I read several of the reviews before preparing and I decided to add a 1/2lb of hot pork sausage with the 1lb of beef- great decision there & I added 1 tbs of Worcestershire to the meat mixture and a few dashes to the sauce on top. I also used  grey poupon as my mustard. This was delicious. I paired it with some mashed potatoes, a balsamic green beans. I have over 1/2 a pan of left overs and it's been a great lunch these past few days. I definitely recommend this.

Very bland meat. Topping helped to give some flavor. May make once more and work with the meat trying to add flavor.

I made this recipe as a new variation to a classic dish and I must say, it was delicious.  I wasn't sure about the brown sugar topping, but tried it anyway and loved it.  My fiance wants me to make this every week now, he loved it so much he nearly ate the pan and was upset when it was gone. My new go to for meatloaf. Thanks so much.

It wasn’t bad. Next time I will use leaner meat (90%), because when I cut a slice the grease was a bit much. Also I found a whole onion was overwhelming. Perhaps 1/2 will be just right.

As is, I give this recipe 3 stars.

Now, to make it a 5 star dish: Throw in some Worcestershire sauce (to taste) in the meat mixture. I also use Italian bread crumbs instead of the plain and trade out the reg. mustard with Dijon or brown. Line the pan with bacon grease before baking and your taste buds will be in heaven with each bite. The meat comes out so juicy and delicious! The great thing about meatloaf is you can really play with the ingredients to your liking. Sometimes I'll add some frozen corn or green bell peppers to give a little more texture and flavor.

this turned out wonderful, I searched for this recipe because I kind of forgot how to make a good meatloaf, instead of ketchup I used Valentina Mexican mild hot sauce, instead of regular milk I used evaporated at half of what would be called for, everything else followed, this was Devine!

Followed recipe exactly and it was moist, delicious and very easy to whip up.. It held together well when sliced. I think it tastes very similar to the onion soup meatloaf recipe but better. My hubby liked this also.

I use this recipe but I just add ketchup instead of the topping here. I also add a packet of onion soup mix, greek seasoning, and sometimes bacon. When  done in the oven I slice it then fry it in butter to crisp the outside. Its the bomb!

I’ve been making this recipe for over a year now. I add my own seasonings and onion soup mix to the meatloaf and shape into the loaf shape. I LOVEEEE the brown sugar glaze. I love all things brown sugar so this was a plus. Great standard recipe.

I love this meatloaf; this is my go-to recipe. I only make two changes: Because I'm a ketchup lover, I double the amount of ketchup mixture and stir half into the mixture of beef, milk, and breadcrumbs. I also use onion powder instead of fresh onion because it isn't as overpowering (also, I don't care for the texture of onions in meatloaf, whether or not they're sauteed ). The meatloaf turns out beautifully, but doesn't hold together well once sliced. This doesn't bother me, but if you like a firmer meatloaf, I would reduce the amount of breadcrumbs to 3/4 cup or 1/2 cup, depending on desired firmness.

Love this recipe.  We use a combo of sweet Italian sausage + ground beef and it’s so delicious.  I use Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Yum!

If you only make one change in this whole recipe, use 1 cup of crushed white cheddar Cheez-Its in place of the bread crumbs!  Sooooo good!! I also took the advice of others and added diced green pepper,  shredded carrots and a little garlic to the onion and sauteed it before adding to the meat mixture.  Put in 1 TBSP of Worcestershire sauce and reduced milk to 1/2 c.  EXCELLENT RECIPE!

I have a picky man for dinner, and he really enjoyed it. I didn’t use the full 1/3 cup of ketchup, just 2 tablespoons for the topping. Otherwise it worked perfectly. For those sensitive stomachs like mine, no issues. I’ll make it again!!

So moist and soft inside and the outer layer had the perfect firm but not hard as burnt bread texture. I've always had problems with getting 'too bready' loaf, it would be too dry but this was awesome and so simple. I used reduced fat buttermilk instead of regular milk because i ran out of milk haha but it worked. I also used a half pound of ground pork and one pound of beef instead of doing a pound and a half of just beef just to give a subtle hint of that porky goodness.

This was a pretty good recipe, but I made some minor changes too. I used 1 lb of ground chuck and 1 lb of ground Italian hot sausage. I omitted the bread crumbs (I hate bread crumbs added to meat dishes).  As others posted, I  used more ketchup, less brown sugar,  instead of prepared mustard, I used a pinch of ground mustard, and a dash of worcestershire sauce for the topping. I formed the meatloaf in a 9×13 baking dish, as others suggested, covered with aluminum foil, and the last few minutes baked it uncovered.

This was so Good!
Made with 90/10 hamburger meat and ditched the brown sugar.
Baked for an hour and 10 minutes.
Sauteed onions and garlic beforehand then added to mix.
Made mashed potatoes and broccoli with the dish.


Was very good, husband and son loved it! Super easy and tasted great!

I've made this so many times. My husband absolutely loves it! I did follow some of the reviews. I added some Worcestershire sauce to the meat and also cooked the chopped onions with butter before mixing into the meat. I also, doubled the sauce. Besides those small changes, I followed the recipe. So yummy and moist.

An easy and basic recipe. Family loved it! If I had to nitpick, it would be that you have to double or triple the sauce amount - but even so it turns out a tad too sweet for my taste. Additionally, adding more veggies would boost the flavor I think. I ended up adding green onions along with the regular onion and it still felt a little missing in flavor without the sauce.

I used a meatloaf mix that we had left over from my wifes Thanksgiving stuffing (just the meat part NOT the stuffing) instead of hamburger, added 1 Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce to the meat and cut the brown sugar back to 1 Tbsp.
I really don't make changes to any of the recipes here because I've found that most are great as stated. But I really like Worcestershire sauce and didn't want it to be too sweet so I cut back a tad on the sugar.

Amazing! Even my kids loved it! The only substitute was that I used onion powder instead of chopped onions because my kids are texture sensitive. And I ran out of milk so used half and half. Was seriously the best meatloaf we have ever eaten.

This recipe meets all of my requirements: Easy and YUMMY! I've made it with both lean ground beef and extra lean ground turkey, and both were delish. I've also used breadcrumbs or torn up dry bread, and both worked well. If you would like a less sweet topping you could reduce the sugar easily. I'm going to try this next time as I'm cutting back on sugar. It's a winner!

this was overall very good tasting and easy to prep.  only thing I would recommend is higher bake temp at least 400 and check for doneness after an hour.  I always follow recipes exactly first time out, and this was undercooked in the center at 350 for an hour.  another 15 mins at 425 and perfection!  I probably should add I used a little more than the recommended 1.5 lbs, prob more like 1.75 lbs.

I enjoyed the meatloaf I did follow the other reviewers comments and added celery and used Italian bread crumbs. I cut out some of the sugar from the sauce but just did not like it that much.

First time making this, loved it did not change a thing, but recommend making maybe double the sauce and mixing in half with the meat mixture to blend in flavour while cooking

Holy cow, this was good! I added a little bit (maybe a Tablespoon) of Worcestershire sauce to the sauce mixture and also a few sprinkles to the meat mixture. LOVED IT! We will definitely make this one again.

This recipe was amazing! I, too, made some substitutions. Instead of an actual onion, I used Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix (both packages in the box). Instead of yellow mustard, I used Walmart’s “Stone Ground Mustard”. For the breadcrumbs, I used crushed Ritz crackers (one whole sleeve makes about a cup as it turns out!). It might not be necessary, but about halfway through the cook time, I make a few small slices in the meatloaf to ensure heat gets to the middle. I have never had a problem with losing moisture this way, and I have comfort that I haven’t undercooked something.

I've made this many times and really like the recipe. Please note that the topping is basically a homemade BBQ sauce and it is very sweet. I prefer to omit that and simply put ketchup on top. You can also just use a store bought BBQ sauce of your liking.

The "Pro Tip" said to cover with tin foil to help cook evenly and to keep moist. My fiancé just poured all the excess liquid off the meatloaf because it's been cooking for almost an hour and a half and still doesn't look edible. Positive note, it's moist!

It was a very delicious meatloaf. Everyone in the house loved it. The only thing i did differently was used honey mustard instead of yellow. I definitely will make this again.

This meatloaf was way too mushy. I wish I had read of some of the other reviews before making it.  I didn’t even put the 1 1/4 cup of milk I only put 1 cup and it still was soft like dog food. I also left it in the oven for extra minutes but that did not help.

Milk was a horrible idea no one could eat it, took it out after an hour and it was raw. Put it back in for 30 minutes and it was wet (not juicy wet) more like soggy, dripping cereal smushed together. It was a horrible experience, would not recommend.

I found the best and easy way to crumble up bread crumbs is to grate it. And putting the butt ends of a loaf on the bottom of the loaf pan soaks up a lot of the grease.

This is the second time I've made this recipe but this time i used saltines instead of bread crumbs.  It was awesome!  This recipe is my family's favorite recipe for meatloaf.  
I think next time i will try buttermilk rather than sweet milk.

Super easy and delicious!  Takes only a few minutes of prep time and the outcome was great!   I work in a restaurant,  so I crushed some of our house-made croutons to use in this recipe.  I have only great things to say!  For the ease, prep time,  and outcome, this recipe is going to get tossed into the regular rotation!

This was easy and delicious. I used the “meatloaf mix” from stop & shop - a blend of beef, pork & veal.  Based on other comments, I added extra ketchup and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce to the sauce ingredients. Also, I made these in cupcake tins rather than a loaf so I cooked it for less time and topped with mashed potatoes (like frosting LOL). My daughters love it! A Nana-favorite.

The only change I made was sauté the onions and garlic in butter! I didn’t use the ketchup either, but it turned out great! My family loved it!

I absolutely love this recipe! I make this one just the way it is for the fussy eaters (those people that won't anything green) For  everyone else, I added 2 tbsp of the Worcestershire sauce, I added garlic and green pepper and sauteed it  in butter with the onion just as the other commentators suggested.  I don't make the ketchup topping because it's too sweet. It was so sweet that everyone scrapped it off and threw it out. Really, using this basic recipe, you can tweak it anyway you want.  Also, using Italian style bread crumbs did make the meatloaf tastier.

Made it twice in one week. The second time I only had mozzarella cheese-definitely not as good as cheddar cheese.

I made this a little more weight helpful.  I use 86% lean ground beef & use 1 lb beef & 1/2 lb turkey - this reduces amount of grease.  Adjust to your liking.  I use Splenda Blend brown sugar for topping, 2% milk or even 1/4 cup fat free half & half, and a little less than 1/2 cup 2% milk (probably about 1/3 cup).  I reduced bread crumbs to about 1/3 cup and mixed in about 1/3 cup of oatmeal with bread crumbs.  Chop onions small.  Adjust milk & bread crumbs to make the loaf manageable -  make first time by recipe and then adjust to your liking the next time.  I usually add just a sprinkle of garlic powder & a couple of drops of Lea & Perrin and a few drops of Soy Sauce.  I have gotten rave reviews and requests from family and friends on this meatloaf.  This meatloaf fits my stoneware loaf pan perfectly.

This was excellent as written.  The onions made the dish, and I did not saute them first.  We didn't think the ketchup mixture was too sweet; I wish there was more of it!!  I predict that I will make this over and over again.

Delicious!! It was so moist that it fell apart. I added more sauce, Worcestershire sauce and didn’t cook the onions like others but I bet it would have been good.  I used whole milk.

Simple, moist and yummy. I did add the sauteed onions. Only reason for four stars is because I didn't care for the sweetness of the brown sugar. Next time I'll leave that out. Otherwise great.

The first time I made it, it was too bland. So the second time I decided to add a few garlic cloves. I sautéed the onion and garlic before adding it to the mix. I also added some Worcestershire sauce, 3/4 packet of meatloaf mix, 2 eggs instead of 1, and 1/4 cup of ketchup (didn't add any additional salt). Came out amazing!

I made it exactly as listed.  We liked the meatloaf part of it very much and will continue to make it.  We did not like the sauce on top.  It was too sweet for our taste.  I will stick with plain catsup.

I will definitely make this again. I made changes to the recipe: (1) 2 lb of ground check instead of ground beef, (2) added 2 tbs worchestershire (since I doubled the recipe), (3) 2 cups of Italian bread crumbs (since I doubled the recipe, and doubled the milk, and used 2 eggs, too), (3) sauteed the 1 large white onion, (4) only put 2bs of mustard seasoning for a doubled recipe. I did not read the directions, so everything was mixed into the meat (except the brown sugar). I only did ketchup for topping, which I put on the meat 10-15 minutes after being in the oven. It turned out AMAZING! My family, which includes picky eaters, loved this recipe (even though I made changes and screwed up directions).

I made this as per instructions with half veal and half pork. I followed the recommendations of using two eggs, adding more ketchup, diced some carrots and squash and red pepper , added a touch if curry powder,  left out the sugar and lined the pan with bread to soak up the fat. It cooked well and was tasty, Next time I'd probably only use one egg and a little less milk perhaps cook another ten min as it held together but was a little moist.

While the ingredient list is simple enough, this recipe is always inconsistent for whatever reason. I've made this exact recipe a dozen times, following the few short instructions on it and cooked each one in the same stove. I've had some come out completely burnt. Others took, and this isn't an exaggeration, 3 hours in the stove and the last hour on 400 degrees. After 3 hours in the oven with the last hour being at 400 degree the entire top of the loaf was raw meat. I did all the tricks and tips to more evenly cook food and nothing worked. I won't be using this recipe again that's for sure.

I made this recipe, with two changes. I mixed cheddar cheese into the loaf. And instead of just ketchup, I used half the amount of ketchup and the other half barbecue sauce. Very delicious! The whole family love for it!

This was my first meatloaf and it turned out delicious.  Being my first I have nothing to compare this recipe to and I probably won't.  This worked out great!  I had 2 lbs of hamburg, used 2 eggs, same milk amount, sauted onions and garlic and for bread crumbs I used package of Stove Top dressing;  chicken flavoured (turns out to be nearly 2 cups of bread crumbs).  I followed the others suggestions and put less sugar;  one tbsp brown sugar and nearly half cup of ketchup.  My wife, who doesn't care for meatloaf had seconds and my son, who is super picky, simply ate it so that's a win right there.

With zero alterations this recipe has been a hit with my family. So much so that I made it to take dinner to a sick relative - and they asked for the recipe! Seriously good stuff and so super simple. Thanks for a great recipe!

It was very good and super simple. However, I used ketchup only for the top of the meatloaf and it tasted just fine without all that extra sugar.

This Meatloaf is absolutely delicious! I’m not one to change recipes and comment how good it was with the changes but I did not have milk on hand and substituted equal portion of tomato sauce. No doubt it would be excellent as well. It was the only change I made. This was by far the best meatloaf I have ever made and my spouse LOVED it just as much. Highly recommend everyone try this. It’s a keeper for us. We are looking forward to making this a Sunday dinner favorite. Thank you for sharing!

I'm not a big cooker (my husband is the chef in the house) so when I do cook, I look for easy recipes. Well... I made this and the meatloaf turned out so good! AND was super easy! I did sauté the onions in butter, use Italian bread crumbs, added Worcestershire sauce PLUS I added peppered bacon on top. My chef hubby was impressed and loved it! Thank you!

I make this at least once a week for my husband who was diagnosed with Ulcerated Colitis. He is limited to meals he can consume and this one doesn't give him any adverse symptoms. That being said, I do not deviate from the recipe with the exception of garlic. I add a good teaspoon to the mixture and it gives it a little more flavor.

I was in hurry when I was making this and looked at the ingredients list before I read the directions (hand on head!). I put ALL of the ingredients into a bowl and mixed it up and ... it seemed awfully soupy. No mind, I threw it all into a baking dish and stuck it into the oven.

This was a simple, plain (not a lot of ingredients) and tasty meatloaf. I had 2 pounds of ground beef to use so I added an extra egg and added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce along with one medium clove of garlic, minced, as other reviewers had suggested; everything else was the same.  Partner enjoyed it and had a second helping!  That is a great recommendation!  Enjoy!

I only used a half an onion and still thought it was too much! Aside from that and the fact that I didn't have the right pan and kept having to dump grease out of the pan to keep the meat cooking though, it was a simple and delicious recipe!

Delicious!!  The best meatloaf I have made.  Love the sauce you put on top.  I reduced the milk by 1/4 cup and I added Frenchs onion rings to the top.. I omitted the salt but did add the pepper.

I doubled the ingredients to make more meatloaf except it took nearly over 2 hours instead of the one hour in the original recipe to get the meat to cook through! We were all starving waiting for the meatloaf to cook.  I think the recipe should have stated the corresponding amount of time if one were to increase the quantity or the temperature should be adjusted because I do not think 350F is hot enough to cook the thick meat! Not terribly happy with this recipe.

I decided to make these as meatloaf muffins. I used 2lbs ground grass fed beef, added a chopped bell pepper and zucchini to add some veggies for my family and reduced the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon.  I baked this in a 12 cup muffin tin for 25 minutes. It was so moist and delicious, my family enjoyed and ate the entire thing. I will definitely be making this again soon. Great recipe :)

Excellent meatloaf! I followed suggestions in comments and added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sause and replaced milk with tomato sauce and sauteed half of the onions to give the meat more flavor. Before adding sauteed onions I pulsed everything  in my Cuisineart food processor to get rid of grainy ground beef texture - the result was a nice smooth texture. The glaze is really good too. It was very easy to make and my family "destroyed" it all in one sitting.

This was a GREAT starter recipe for my fist ever meatloaf! While it was a little bland, it gave me a base recipe to add to for the next time I make it. I used 80/20 beef and found that it held together perfectly and was easy to shape.

I use this recipe all the time. I usually make it with closer  to 2lbs of meat and cook for 1.5 hours. Previously I would saute the onion in butter before adding it to the mixture but recently stopped because it didn't make a difference in the finished meatloaf. I use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. Everyone my 3 year old to my husband loves  it

Excellent!  My husband especially liked the topping.  I made 2 changes:  1) added 1 tablespoon of dried parsley flakes and 2) used dried onion  instead of a fresh onion.  (My grandson does not like onions in his food.  The dried onion gave the flavor but not the appearance of the onion.)

threw it away it was a waste of money to cook a lump of meat with no flavor, I should have known better. I started reading the reviews and everybody who rated this high is talking about making changes well than why even bother to rate this if you did not cook this?

Honestly I was very disappointed. Very plain & was way to moist, it didn't even get hard. It was like eating wet dog food. Don't waste your time with this recipe.

So, I read the ingredient list and accidentally dumped all of the ingredients into one bowl, not realizing that the last 3 were intended for a separate  glaze. I decided to proceed with cooking the whole thing as is and, I have to say, the mustard and brown sugar gave the meatloaf an awesome boost of flavor throughout. I will be repeating this mistake again.

Used 1/2 the onion and it was still too much. Next time I'll use 1/3. Used GF oats instead of breadcrumbs and almond milk. Delicious, will make again, just with less onion :)

Made exactly according to recipe. It needed to cook longer than an hour. I wish it had said what the internal temp should be. It is a wetter version of meatloaf and there wasn't enough sauce for on top.

This is a favorite in our household! I usually don't do the onion (I have a thing with the texture), but I'll use onion powder. We've also made it several different ways adding in whatever veggies we might have on hand -- carrots, mushrooms, etc. (usually slap-chopped raw and then mixed in with everything else, so the kids will get an extra serving of veggies without even knowing lol!)

I made this after my husband requested meatloaf. I was reticent to make meatloaf as I thought it would be more "work" than it was worth, but this recipe was easy! ALSO my husband and our VERY selective 6 year old both raved about how good this was, my son decided to call this new food "meat lovers" because of how much he liked it. This is going into our regular weeknight meal rotation.

This was ok. It took an hour and a half to cook though, not an hour- probably because I had 2 pounds of ground beef and I used a loaf pan. I used italian seasoned bread crumbs and added 1 T of Worcestershire sauce. I sauteed onions and garlic in butter before adding. I think it could have used some more salt maybe. It was ok. Could use some more seasoning within the meat mixture. The topping was too sweet, maybe reduce the sugar next time. I did reduce the mustard.

I followed the worchestire sauce tip, but I added a spoon to the meat and another one to the sauce, and a little bit of diced parsley. I also used golden brown sugar, not dark. I don't have a meatloaf pan so I used plastic wrap to make it, and then I added half of the sauce, covered in bacon, and only then poured the rest to glaze the bacon. My husband loved it!

I ended up cooking it for another 45 minutes and it turned out perfect! We ended up using turkey meat also.

I'm not much of a cook, but I'm trying to step up my game.  I like that the recipe only required a few simple ingredients and I already had most of them in my house.  It was easy and my family loved it!

Very yummy meatloaf! My husband is a picky eater and he loved it. I did cut the onion in half out of personal preference.

Very moist.  I will make it again, but I will use less onion.  The recipe calls for one onion, which if you have a large onion, that might be too much.  I'm thinking one half to three quarters cup of diced onions would be about to my tastes.

First time I've EVER made meatloaf. It turned out great and I'm not a big meat eater so that's saying A LOT!! Will definitely be using this again. I did follow the suggestion to add Worcestershire sauce, but that's the only change I made.

I just made this last night and it was delicious! Because I only made it for two people, I used just one pound of meat instead of the pound and a half that the recipe calls for. I didn't sauté my onions like other reviewers suggested for the simple fact that I didn't want to wash a skillet. I just chopped them up finely and they were fine. I only added 1/3 cup seasoned bread crumbs and 2/3 cup milk since I reduced the meat quantity. Oh, only change I really made was instead of adding the salt and pepper, I just used one package of Hidden Valley salad dressing and season mix. This meatloaf was so moist and delicious. The glaze on top really adds a delicious flavor. Served it with some sweet corn and seasoned potato wedges. My husband loved it!

Very easy and moist unlike other recipes I have tried. I used the tip about the onions as well as Worcestershire sauce. Was better fresh rather than reheated but still good. Could have used a bit more kick - a bit mild for our tastes so I'll likely throw in a few mire seasonings next time. But there will definitely be a next time. I'd have given it full marks but for the taste.

I followed the advice of others and added Worcestershire to the meat mix and sauteed the onions with some garlic in butter before adding to the mix. Also, I didn't have bread crumbs on hand so I used Pepperidge Farms seasoned stuffing mix. I've never added a sauce to the top of my meatloaf before; but I must say, I liked it!

Turned out great! I do mine into meatloaf balls with a ball of velveeta inside each one. I also use quick oats instead of bread crumbs, that's just what I always grew up on. :) great recipe!

This one is a "keeper" for sure. I've tried several meatloaf recipes and was not happy with any of them--too dry, too bland, whatever. This one sounded just right, and it was!! I added a splash of Worcestershire sauce (I think I heard my dear departed mother whisper that into my ear) At any rate I now have found MY perfect meatloaf. I make them in minis to freeze and pop out as needed. BTW, I used Panko bead crumbs.

It was adequate. Not great. I won't make it again. I was hopeful because of other recipes I've used here, but my family all felt the same - we didn't toss it but we don't want to repeat it. I will say it was easy and didn't require too many ingredients. I used 2 lbs of high quality organic ground turkey, and added the Worcester like the reviews recommended. I admit I think I added a bit more salt than the recipe called for. I also did not saute the onions as some of the reviewers did, I just put them in as written in the recipe.

Not as soft as I hoped & the topping is too sweet, otherwise good though.   If someone is fussy abotu onions you may want to reduce that amount as well.

Not bad, but kind of a boring and bland flavour. Definitely easy to make. I'd probably increase the sauce by 50% next time.

Sooo I didn't watch the video.. I saw the ingredients and mixed everything together, and when I say I everything I mean everything. I put the egg first mixed it up, then the milk, then the breadcrumbs, ketchup and mustard in a separate dish and mixed it all together. Then diced up a small onion added it into the meat mixed that in separate. Then threw the onion meat what my girlfriend called "The Sludge".On a positive note it smells good, and I am confident in the amounts of ingredients I put into the bowl. So I'm waiting for it to come out so I can take pictures. I did use good fresh meat and I will put ketchup on it towards the end of the bake time around 55 minutes. I think it's bangin.

Very good, doubled to 2.5 lb ground turkey. Hubby said was good, but too sweet. (I liked it). Will reduce or omit brown sugar  next time. Used whole wheat panko for bread crumbs. Increased cook time. Used 9X13 glass pan, drained off after.

This is a great basic meat loaf recipe. A cup of milk is too much for my taste -- love the catsup/mustard/brown sugar topping. I start with this recipe and adjust it for what I have. Made it with ground turkey and ground beef -- it was great. I use more bread crumbs -- Panko -- and less milk -- maybe 1/2 cup. Love it spicy, so I add dried chili peppers.

I made this dish for Fathers Day because my husband LOVES meatloaf. He loved it so much that he asked for me to make a second one just so it would be just his and he could take it to work for lunch and so he could have meatloaf sandwiches. It is such an easy meal to make.

It was just....EDIBLE..., sorry....
It was too many breadcrumbs, making it gritty.  And even though I followed the other's advice to brown the onions and double the sauce...it was plain on the inside, "zingy" on the outside.

I've made it approximately 10 times now.. It is very delicious. I use about 3/4 cup milk instead of 1 full cup.

Followed all the steps but instead of 1.5 lbs of ground beef I added 1/2 lbs of sweet Italian sausage and 1 lbs of lean ground beef. I also substituted the soft bread crumbs for  1/2 cup of progressive's Italian style bread crumbs  and added an extra egg. AND OMG...so good and gives it a little extra flavor.

I had NEVER used milk in my recipe before but was curious so I gave it a try. It was tasty and definitely moist but a little too much so for my preference. I'd make it again except maybe with only half or one-fourth the amount of milk called for in the recipe.

Family raved about this meatloaf. Did saute onions and garlic first in butter, and added 1/2 lb. ground pork to make 2 pounds total.  Definitely double topping!  Not much left over!

It was a huge hit with my husband.   I used ground chuck and pork mixture and used half onion and red pepper minced well.  I did not saute since it was a fine mince with seasoned italian breadcrumbs.  I thought the sauce was enough.  I don't like too much sauce on the meat loaf.  It takes away from it but that is only a matter of your taste buds.   Definitely worth a try and tweak to your liking.  Overall great recipe!

I love this recipe. I've made it four times now and I put my own twist on it. I make my own bread crumbs and usually use more meat than it calls for. Tonight I made it with hamburger and turkey then I used a thick and spicy BBQ sauce instead of making my own.

The only thing I changed was the bread crumbs. I used crushed up Ritz crackers. It was excellent. My family would eat this every night if I made it.

I've made this quite a few times now, exactly AS-IS and it's by far the best meatloaf I have ever built.  I have been making loafs of meat for years, all different recipes with a plethora of outcomes, but this recipe right here is the only one I use.  I really appreciate the recipe, and I would have never have thought to put milk in a loaf of meat in the past.  Thank you!

I just made this,I loved the recipe,but I love modifying  recipes,I added,what I did was,saute the onion in olive oil,until soft or even a little burnt,but while I was doing  that I did the whole recipe,but I never use a measuring cup with my recipes,even a little More bread crumbs,a little more of everything,,weather you have a big family or not,and I used one packet of Lipton onion soup mix,for the sauce I put on it,which you should put a little on the bottom for extra,flavor,ketchup, mustered, salt ,pepper, hoison garlic soy vay,found in the Asian isle,brown sugar,like I said everything measured on how big your family is. Alright so on mash potatoes, which goes with meatloaf, I used three cans for four people of sliced potatoes,I added milk,sour cream,cream cheese,salt ,pepper, garlic salt,and alittle of bobs blue cheese,sorry but that's it I have a one year old crying at me,bye,hope this helps,cause I'm not much of a cook,but my mother in law,told me I out did myself, i t made my day,thank you!

I made two slight modification -- added some worcestershire sauce -- and I had two fully cooked Bratwursts so I only used 1lb of ground beef and then cut the Bratwursts into small pieces a mixed it in with the ground beef.....AMAZING results.  Even without my additions, this was an AWESOME recipe.  Oh, and when I cooked it, I used a pie dish and made a round meat loaf.....IT WAS MY FAVORITE DISH in a long time.  smb

Made as stated and it turned out amazing, all three times. Think I'm going to sauté the onions next time, sounds yummy. Also, for the sauce I just use ketchup & brown sugar- no mustard.

Mushy and bland meat. Sauce too sweet and over-powered the meat instead of complementing it. I've used quite a few of allrecipes ' recipes, and this was the first I didn't like.

The recipe is great, I love the sauce but I do suggest adding 30 minutes to your cooking time as mine was still pink. Will definitely make again. I added hp sauce to the meat and some steak spice.

This is really different from what I've had the in past, but very tasty! I got going and didn't read the instructions properly, and ended up putting all the sauce ingredients into the meatloaf mixture so there was nothing on top. However, I didn't miss the sauce on top since it was so moist. Delicious as leftovers the next day too. I'll probably make it the same way next time as well. The sweet/tangy of the brown sugar and mustard really makes this meatloaf.

Wonderful, easy recipe. 
I did add chopped fresh parsley and a tsp of cumin.
Next time, I won't add as much milk because I prefer it to be more firm.

Good recipe but cooking for 1hr @ 350 degrees wasn't enough, took it out after 1hr and the centre was only somewhat cooked and liquidy. I will try this again in the future and cook it for longer!

Very easy to make and very tasty. I added some garlic powder to the meat, use Italian seasoned breadcrumb and added Worcestershire sauce in the glaze.

I will definitely keep this in my FAVORITE recipes list! Hubby LOVED it! Didn't cover it w aluminum and it cooked for 1 hr, 20 mins. Prep time was a hot 8 minutes. I did add the worshershire sauce as another reviewer noted. I used 3/4 sleeve of saltines but may add a whole sleeve next time.  It was the most moist meatloaf I have ever made! Even my Lil one ate it and she isn't a meat lover at all! Thank you!

I added about a half a tablespoon of worcestershire to the meat and used panko crumbs instead of bread or cracker crumbs. I added about 1/4 cup of barbecue sauce to the ketchup mixture for a little more smokey flavor. Lastly, I like  my meatloaf to have a good, crispy coating so a baked at 375º instead of 350. Turned out awesome.

I used a spicy sweet onion mustard for the sauce and it added a nice kick. Half of my family loved it, the other half thought it was just okay.

The most moist and tender meatloaf ever. I received rave reviews on a MEATLOAF!??  That says something.  I did alter this recipe and added several tblsp of dried parsley, eliminated the sugar, used panko breadcrumbs, onion powder, garlic powder salt and pepper- otherwise followed recipe.  This is how I will likely forever do meatloaf.  Delicious.

Great recipe. I do wish I had followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the amount of mustard. In my opinion it needs to be reduced to one tbs, and the ketchup should be increased also. I did not take the time to brown my onions, however I did chop them very finely, with a food chopper and I like the result. I made mini meat loafs in the pampered chef brownie pan. It worked great! Same temp, I reduced the baking time to 30 minutes.

This was great and I don't even like meatloaf ;) I took the advice of other reviewers and sautéed the onion in butter because I'm not a huge fan of crunchy onions in my food. Next time I will probably grate the onions before sautéing them because I have picky eaters and the finer the veggies, the less complaints! I saw a lot of reviews that suggested doubling the sauce, which I did, but found the meatloaf to be too sweet. So the next time I made the sauce as written and it was perfect!! Oh and I used 2 eggs and skipped the milk, only because I didn't quite have enough. Wonderful recipe!

yes the only change was putting  the ketchup,mustard, and brown sugar in the Bowl with the turkey buger  before cooking it then after it was cooked I put the sauce on top again. This was the best everyone loved it I gave the recipe to all my friends and even gave the site to go to thank you so much.

We didn't enjoy this at all and I won't make it again. Thank goodness for the glaze because the meatloaf had absolutely no flavor. My other half typically would have had seconds but he was done after one serving.

Needed a new meatloaf recipe and this one reminded be of my childhood!  Sautéed the onions with garlic and added Worcester sauce as suggested. All good!

Excellent and easy! I put my little meatloaves in muffin tins to shorten cooking time. Delish! And moist enough to reheat in microwave and not dry out.

Definitely very easy to make. I threw in a couple tbs Worcestershire sauce and also used a pan of water underneath to make it more moist. I also added green peppers. As is, the recipe itself is very bland, great for beginners who have never made a meatloaf before!

So I've never made a meatloaf before. I'm still slightly new to cooking certain foods and my boyfriend requested meatloaf for dinner. This recipe seemed easy enough to follow. So I put all the ingredients in a bowl, combined all together and put into a loaf. I didn't notice on the directions that it said to combine the ketchup, brown sugar and mustard for the topping. I accidentally put it right in! Lol. Well, it still came out good but kinda mushy at the bottom. Will add more breadcrumbs next time. My way came out pretty good for my first meatloaf. For a topping I mixed about 1/3 cup ketchup with 2 tablespoons brown sugar, mixed together and spread on top. I also used 1lb ground beef and 1lb ground turkey instead of all beef. This recipe made me 2 loaf pans worth. Super good and easy.

Great recipe as is. And no offense to those commenting on this recipe if you have made alterations to it because your comments are no longer for this exact recipe, rather comments on your own altered version. Makes no sense

Wonderful recipe! I made extra sauce (doubled ingredients for sauce) and added Worcestershire sauce to it. I also added Worcestershire sauce to the meatloaf ingredients, and sauteed the onion before adding it to the meatloaf mix.

I added Tabasco and Worcestershire to the ketchup mix to make it spicy/sweet.  Very good recipe, can use a little less onion depending on size.  Also, I drain the grease off after I cook it.  Next time I will try it using 90/10 lean meat instead of 80/20.

Excellent recipe! It took not time to throw together and the results were delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, with one small exception. I sauteed the onion with some garlic, as others have suggested. Also, I cooked at 350 for 45 min. in my convection oven. Will definitely make again!

SO SO good! I made this tonight and instead of making it into a loaf, I made it in a muffin pan and made mini meatloafs. Then I added mashed potatoes on top of it and gravy drizzled on all of it. SO amazing. Absolutely would make this again!

Loved the recipe and so did all the hungry men in my household!! Used everything on this list except I made with ground chuck (came out super juicy, prefer it over ground beef) and I also added A1 sauce. Would definitely make again.

DIVINE SANDWICHES! YUMMY, DELICIOUS MEATLOAF! These are the rave reviews of my husband. I made the original recipe and he thought it was pretty good.  With a few changes, he went crazy over it.  Two pounds of hamburger.  Two eggs.  Two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce.  One tablespoon coarse sea salt.  No pepper.  No topping.  Hubby prefers catsup.  I think it's perfect without any side sauce.

Very good and I will make this again. In place of the milk I used Bacon French onion dip and did not use the bread crumbs but did use a roll of the ritz crackers. My meat was fairly lean and I used a lb of hamburger with about a half pd of sausage.  Very very good and I am not a meatloaf fan!

I make mine like this except I use Baby Ray's Bar B Q sauce in place of the
ketchup .   I also add a little dried onions flakes in the sauce.  I soak the dried onion flakes in a little water to soften them first.  I use panko flakes in place of bread crumbs or oatmeal.

First time making meatloaf and it came out well! I used a pack of magic flake crackers (basically Asian buttery saltines) and supplemented the rest of 1 cup with chopped up french bread. Added copious seasonings (Italian seasoning, s&p, and garlic powder). Sautéed garlic, onion, and celery. Do not overwork the beef, mix in meat after all other fillings incorporated. I drained the meatloaf twice, at 45 mins and at end of 1 hr and 15 mins. A lot of liquid came out. At about 45 mins in the meatloaf shrunk quite a bit in length so I jammed baby carrots in the pockets, that was a good addition of veg. The glaze was delicious, I added a bit of hot sauce :)

I made this because it sounded easy and it was.  Everyone loved it, and it was delicious and simple.  I followed some of the other suggestions about sautéing the onions in butter and did a few of my own: added some sautéed green peppers; used seasoned bread crumbs;  doubled the sauce amount; added Worcestershire sauce; and used Dijon mustard as that was all I had on hand.  It was perfect and simple.  I really loved it but my husband and mother raved and raved...we had leftovers (barely) and gobbled it up the next day.  Goes great with mashed potatoes!  So happy I found this recipe.  ENJOY!

The meatloaf was great.  The sauce on top was too sweet for me and tasted too much like barbecue sauce.

I made this last week hoping for just a quick and easy dinner. It was easy to make but I didn't care for it at all. I made it exactly as it called for maybe it was the mustard, first time I used it in a meatloaf recipe. I will not make this again. Sorry.

So simple, yet so good. Hadn't  made meatloaf for years, when I found this recipe.  Now I can't wait to make it. I make recipe as provided, except I have peach preserves I use instead of apricot, but only because I have them.

I loved it! While the recipe is perfect by itself, I added some vietnamese chili garlic sauce; 2 table spoons. It adds a small kick that I like in my food. The sauce itself doesn't pack a high amount of heat, but it gives you all the attributes of adding garlic and some chili pepper.  Other than that, as my grandma used to do, I hardboil 3 eggs, peel them, and stick them inside the loaf before I bake it. 

Amazing, all together, but the recipe is perfect on itself. If you're feeling adventurous, try it my way - you won't be disappointed.

This is going to be a family favorite. I did change it a little. I sauted the onion in butter and added shredded cheese in the middle. Everyone loved it.

An excellent recipe.  I just added 1 Tbs Worcestershire and  2 Tbs ketchup to the meat mix.  Also used a "meatloaf mix" consisting of ground beef, pork and veal.

I have made this many times, as it is my go to for meat loaf. I tear up two slices of bread and add to it.  Also, I added1 T worcestershire  sauce., parsley flakes and garlic powder. My husband doesn't like cooked onion, so I add 1 T onion powder.   I used the seasoned bread crumbs(crushed ritz crackers are excellent to use instead of bread crumbs too). I triple the topping and add 1 packet of Splenda to it. We like it sweet. I also use EVAPORATED milk, much better than regular milk. I pat it into a 13x9x2 pan so it bakes the fastest.  I like to serve it with Tater Tots. All of my picky eaters LOVE IT.. Thanks to all of the cooks for the extra tips and additions.

I have made this several times and it comes out perfect every time.  I make it exactly as written but usually use venison instead of beef.  Even with a lean meat like venison, it still is pretty moist.  Best meatloaf I have ever had.

This is a great recipe. I changed in a little by adding around 1/4 cup of ketchup into the meatloaf and a dash of worcestershire into the meatloaf. I didn't do exact measurements for the sauce on top but I added less brown sugar than suggested. My husband and son loved the recipe. This will be my new go to recipe as my husband said it was the best he's ever had (even better than his mother's). That's a WIN.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was very bland with too much onion. If I make it again, I'll definitely follow advice left in comments. I like to cook the recipe as is before tweaking.... I'm regretting it.

5 stars for simplicity and taste. I added a tsp minced garlic and few shakes of Worcestershire sauce to the mix and put it back in the oven for 10 mins after topping it with the ketchup mix.

Loved it, this is now my go-to meatloaf recipe.  I added a dash of liquid smoke to the ketchup mix, which I think really helped, I recommend that.  Also, I know a lot of other commenters thought the instructions yielded too little sauce, but I think that's more a matter of personal taste.  I really wanted more of a glaze than a drenching, so if anything I'd probably cut down on the sauce next time.  Two other tips: first, this goes great with beef mushroom gravy.  Second, this was even better reheated in the microwave the day after, so make a little extra for your next day's lunch.

The only change I made was 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground pork (instead of all ground beef). No other changes. This was so easy and so good! Everybody loved it. Will definitely keep this as a "go to" weekday dinner option!

This a a quick easy crowd pleasing recipe to make on a weeknight. I followed the recipe 100% but added some fresh cilantro into the meat and a little on top. It was not over powering and added extra flavor to a already flavorful meatloaf. It made for great leftovers was more flavorful couple days after. Delicious you wont be disappointed.

Excellent recipe! Super easy. I did not use the brown sugar/ketchup topping. While the meatloaf was cooking, I blanched sweet red and orange peppers and put them in marinara sauce which topped the meatloaf along with some mozzarella cheese. I will definitely make this again.

I also used seasoned bread crumbs and added worcestershire sauce (1 Tbs) I also used minced garlic 3 cloves and left out mustard. Not a fan in meatlof. I also mixed everything together vs putting last ingredients on top.

I use this as my base recipe, but I use crushed croutons instead of bread crumbs.  I also add bacon bits, and cheese.  Then I just use BBQ sauce on top.  My husband loves this recipe and often asks for it!!

I used crushed plain pork rinds instead of  the bread crumbs.  Hunts natural tomato sauce and I added seasonings to it, instead of the ketchup.
Eryithritol instead of sugar.
I put the topping on it during the last 15 minutes of cooking time. I Was Great!
I am eating High protein, low carbs.

Good recipe!  Easy and delicious.  I followed other reviewer's tips and added about a tbs of Worcestershire, and also sautéed the onion and 1 clove or pressed garlic in butter to soften it up.  I dumped that into the meat mixture and followed all of the other instructions.  I also added a bit of bacon because bacon always can be counted on to add a little extra goodness!  I didn't add much, just a little, already cooked but not too crispy.  To my delight my family LOVED it!  Even the sauce.  I served the meatloaf with green beans and mashed 'tatoes and gravy.  I will use this recipe again for sure.  :)

Great recipe! I added about a half cup of sausage and even though I accidentally added the ketchup, mustard and brown sugar, meant for the top, to the meat mixture, oops!, It turned out great! When I realized what I did, I grabbed the ketchup and mustard back out of the fridge and mixed it with the brown sugar and poured the mixture on top, as per the recipe. This recipe filled 4 mini loaf pans, I cooked them for 40 minutes, until the internal temp was 160. Really good. It's a keeper!

This was my first time making meatloaf! I used organic grass fed 95/5 lean meat. I was delicious! The only issue I had was the measurement of the sauce; it was too little. I made more to really cover the top and really add that classic flavor to it!

I added a few pieces of garlic man that really hit the spot. Just took it out and already half is gone. I would suggest doubling the ingredients so you have leftovers this went quick.

Super easy and delicious! I subbed the salt with garlic & sea salt, added 1 tsp minced garlic, 2 tsp dried parsley (fresh would probably be better) and 1 tsp summer savory. Super rich with lots of flavor!

Apparently I don't know how to follow a recipe and this meatloaf turned out to be THE BEST DARN MEATLOAF I've ever eaten.
Instead of reading the directions, I simply added all the ingredients into a bowl. Yes, all of them.
I couldn't figure why it was so mushy.
Til I read the recipe fully.
I wasn't about to waste it so I cubed up some whole wheat bread (3 slices) and added it to the mix. That did the trick and the result was the most tender and delicious meatloaf. 
I will make this way from now on and be happy it turned out so well.

HOLY WOW! This was a hit with every member of the family, from the 2 year old and 4 year to mom and dad. It was the perfect consistency, taste, and moist(ness). So freaking amazing! Instead of making the glaze, we just poured a little brown gravy on our pieces. So good!

Note: you definitely CAN put too much sauce on top. A little sweetness goes a loooong way. And I added a bit of Worcestershire sauce to the sauce on top to balance out sweetness.

It was really good and easy to make. My family loves it my boyfriend said it was better than Costco's all ready made meatloaf. But what I did was let the bread crumbs soak in the milk for a little while in a separate container, after it soaked I put the egg in with the milk and bread crumbs mixed it then I put the wet ingredients on the ground beef and onions then mixed it.

We love this recipe!!  The only thing I don't include is the onions, I feel like it doesn't stay together well with them. 
My entire family loves this!! The mustard/ketchup/brown sugar mix on top is the best part!!! 
I make this quite frequently for my family and they never get tired of it!

Very simple, but very good recipe.  I either don't add the onions or I will add a dried onion soup packet to it. People I know don't like the fresh onions in their meatloaf. Something to do with the texture. Otherwise, fantastic go to recipe.  I did cut down on the sugar for the topping because the Ketchup has a lot of sugar to start with. Also...for something a little different...use a lasagna pan and flatten/spread it in a thin layer. So you can divide it up into squares after cooking to make sandwiches.

Followed directions but cooked a bit longer, had good flavor, will make again and will add the worcestershire sauce.  Second time around added 3 cloves of garlic and worcestershire sauce, will continue to make it this way.

I followed the recipe and,much to my surprise, it tasted like my mom's meatloaf (of which I didn't have a recipe for).  For me, it was the brown sugar.  I've never added sugar before, but now, I will keep this recipe as a family favorite.

Really easy and just the right amount of flavor.  I did mix some additional ketchup and brown sugar to drizzle on top of cut pieces.  My entire family loved it, including my very picky son.  Will make again.

This is a great recipe, it's my second time making it. The changes i made was to cut out the mustard (don't  like). The  onion and bread crumbs i cut in half. also had to put half sauce on( for me)  and half off  (for my husband) on the meatloaf. I also added 1.tbsp of Worcestershire sauce. I baked at 375 degrees instead of the 350. We were able to get six servings from this with leftovers. This is definitely a repeater meal for the both of us!

Love this recipe as it is quick, simple, and never disappoints! I've tweaked a wee bit and now substitute the milk with an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce. Was just too bland with milk.

Instead of beef we used ground venison that had a little pork mixed in. It was so good and we will definitely make this again.

This was delicious - and I usually don't like meat loaf. The glaze on top is hat makes it exceptional. One hour was just right for it to be cooked through but not dry.

My husband LOVES this recipe. When he asks for meatloaf, he begs for the "brown sugar one!" I always used seasoned bread crumbs- without, it's too plain! The whole family loves it and I'm lucky if there's leftovers!

This was my first time making meatloaf and I thought this recipe was full proof and excellent! I did follow the advice of the other reviewers except for a few things. I added minced garlic to the meat, I added a tablespoon of worcestercire sauce to the meat, and a bell pepper. I doubled the ketchup, used the recommended 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, used 3 tablespoons of mustard, and a teaspoon of honey. Soooo good!

Have made it twice in 3x batches and it scales well. I used 50/50 ground elk and beef and it turned out great too. I used frozen onions which made them softer to begin with, added lots of seasonings (Worcestershire, A1, meat rub, meatloaf seasoning, just use what you have on hand and would typically use to season meat). This recipe is very adaptable, a great base to add your own flavors.

I never wanted to make meat loaf after seeing how families reacted to it in movies. I'm 7 months pregnant and never had meat loaf in my life but somehow was craving it! My gosh! It came out sooooo yummy! Esp the sauce on top! I sautéed the onions in olive oil. Did one tbsp of mustard instead of 2. Doubled up on the ketchup. & Added a few splashes of worshire. So yummy! I always find recipes on here to add to my weekly rotation!

Excellent. I have to modify most recipes due to a variety of serious dietary issues and if it was excellent after my changes, then it would be as good or better without them! I had to make the following changes:
- 1/2C cooked quinoa in place of breadcrumbs/eggs
- no eggs
- unsweetened almond milk instead of cow milk, and only about 1/4C since there were no breadcrumbs for absorption.
- Dijon mustard in place of prepared mustard (it's all I had on hand)
- coconut sugar in place of brown sugar.

This was the best meatloaf that I've ever made - even my husband liked it more than usual.

Great base recipe, but like most I made changes. It was pretty major, I used a pound of ground beef and a half pound of Italian sausage. Turned out pretty  good.

I am the type of person who makes her meatloaf by the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink method, meaning I use whatever I have on hand and dump it in. I have never used milk in my meatloaf for the liquid (preferring ketchup, steak sauce, wine or beer), but I like it in this recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and sautéed the onions (adding minced garlic) and included Worcestershire sauce. I also used panko crumbs. I thought it was very good, but my family didn't like it as well as my regular never-the-same-way-twice meatloaf.

I have made this twice now and my family really loves it!  I used Italian bread crumbs. I may cut back on the prepared mustard in the topping mixture next time, only because my kids do not care for anything spicy but it was still received very well! I will continue to use this recipe from now on!

I used two pounds of meat and made 2 loafs. I also used half an onion, ritz crackers, dijon musturd and put all ingredients  in the meat. (I like the added flavors but hate the saucey coating.) Turned out Fantastic! Kids love it!

Very easy and very tasty!  However, I think next time I will skip the brown sugar.  The sauce was a little too sweet for me.  Other than that it was great!

This is a great, easy, flavor packed recipe. I used whole milk, Italian flavored bread crumbs, 2lbs of beef, 2 eggs, and followed the rest of the recipe as stated. it was moist and packed with flavor! 
I also tried adding 1 egg, dijon mustard, and a tbs of sour cream instead of 2 eggs. FABULOUS! This is an easy go to meal for any night of the week!

I used the fattier 73/27 beef, left out the milk, used italian breadcrumbs and added 2 teaspoons of mustard in with the meat mixture. I also added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, sauted the onions in butter and put a single layer of maple bacon over the top before adding the sauce. I left it on an extra 5-10 minutes. It came out perfect; sweet but not too sweet and the aroma swept through the whole house. Probably the best meatloaf I've ever made. The only other thing is my roommate suggested to add jalapeños next time to add a little kick.

I followed the recipe except for putting the sauce on after 30 min of baking. This creates a crispy exterior. No need to sautee the onions of they are diced small enough. I'll definitely be making this again.

I don't keep brown sugar or mustard on hand, so I substitute barbeque sauce, about a quarter cup. Works just fine mixed with the ketchup.

Sweet and savory!  You cannot go wrong with this meatloaf.  I make all kinds of meatloaf: loaves from my grandmother's kitchen to the gourmet I've learned along the way, but this one is fool-proof and delicious.  (I saute my onions with crushed garlic for no more than three minutes.)

After 50 years of making meatloaf,  I tried this recipe for a change. It is now my new meatloaf recipe. I  did saute the onions just a little as some stated, but that is all I altered.  A true winner! The glaze is wonderful.

I cook at my church for Wednesday night meals. I use this recipe but upsize it for 120 people. Everyone loves it. I do modify it a little. I add Worcestershire sauce, oregano, basil, and dry mustard. The glaze I do not change at all.

This recipe was excellent. I added the foil to the pan, I sautéed my onions, I added Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and parsley. I toasted and seasoned my own bread, and used a 1.5 cups of that and cooked it a bit longer. turned out great. this is my first meatloaf, and this is my new go to recipe.

This is a very good meatloaf recipe.  I love how moist and juicy it stays after cooking.  Nothing dried out about this meatloaf. I did follow some of the changes that others talked about.  I used 2 lbs of ground turkey along with doubling the ketchup mixture. I added maybe 1/2 cup more bread crumbs.  I just toasted some bread and cubed it . I also cooked it for another 20 min or so. I have another recipe that I have used for years but wanted to try this one because of the many reviews.  I'm glad I did. I'm sure that any meatloaf lovers out there would love this version.

This was yummy.  I used 2.25 pounds of 93% lean meat.  I followed the ideas for the Worcester sauce, and the  butter sauteed onions and garlic.  I upped everything by 50% to accommodate the extra meat. I left it uncovered and used non-stick foil at the bottom of the pan. I used ground oatmeal instead of the bread crumbs because I was out of breadcrumbs.  Excellent.  Looking forward to making it again.

Holy moly this was better than the band. Always loved meatloaf, first time maker. Would've given it 5 stars however as others have mentioned, the alterations required become a separate recipe altogether. This is a fantastic base. 

I doubled the topping and added Bullseye BBQ (eyeballed and tasted)
...I used Ritz buttery crackers instead of breadcrumbs 
...Skipped the milk...Added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce...
Added fresh parsley and green onion...
Added cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, basil and a garlic salt seasoning (two pinches each) ...Served with balsamic veggies. Covered in foil for 1h10m at 350. Make sure you let it cool a bit before slicing - I was so hungry and it crumbled a tad. Destroyed it anyway! Yum.

I've made this multiple times.  It's not the same as my mom's meatloaf recipe, but it's definitely become a family favorite.  Whenever I've made it for company, they too have thoroughly enjoyed it.  I, personally, don't make any changes to the recipe; however, I'm sure the added suggestions would turn out great.  In my opinion, the brown sugar mixture really makes this recipe.  Maybe one of these days, I'll give some suggestions a try... On a side note, I have always used seasoned bread crumbs. 
My mother made a wonderful meatloaf recipe with bacon for years; and I personally think this one tastes even better.  If you love sweet food, this recipe is a go-to.

I used a little less milk then called for and I still felt like it was to much milk.  I added garlic and some herbs. If you use this recipe I recommend cooking it longer and /or less milk.  Add seasoning to.  I don't plan on using this recipe again.

I'm not sure why but it came out super mushy. I sautéed the onions in butter and added garlic. I used 1 cup cracker meal, 1 cup of milk, and 1 egg but it barely held together. It did taste good! Next time I might use a leaner ground beef.

I made this for my husband and I but I thought the 1 cup of milk sounded like a lot of liquid and bland so I used only about a quarter cup of milk and about two tablespoons of steak sauce into the beef mixture with the onions, panko bread crumbs and the egg, with salt, pepper and   added some garlic powder to add some more flavor.  The sauce I made as in the recipe and this meatloaf came out very moist, very flavorful and maybe the best meatloaf I've made to date.  My husband just loved it!  I normally make a recipe as written before reviewing it but the one cup of milk and lack of spices made me question and make changes.  With the tweaks I would give it a five and more.

Really easy to make done and ready for the oven in about 10 minutes.  Amazingly I didn't have any ketchup so I used 1/3 cup of spaghetti sauce and a pack of sweet and low for the coating  along the other ingredients and it was delicious!

Delicious! I didn't use the brown sugar or the milk...I forgot both ingredients (I'm the worst cook). But it was very good even without it! I am definitely going to make it again.

I made this wit h garlic & herb bread crumbs, Heinz 57 instead of ketchup. Also I sauteed the onions before adding them.  Also I used venison that I seasoned. Super yummy!  I am so glad I made 2 pans & will make this again.

After searching for many years for just the right Meatloaf recipe that combine few ingredients, easy assembly , consistent outcome, and the taste i was looking for, I came upon this one.  After 5 times, this one doesn't disappoint! the secret is in using  the round buttery salty sweet crackers  for this meatloaf

I made this last night and it was delicious! I totally forgot the onion so I just substituted with some garlic salt and pepper for flavor. I also added about 3 dashes of oregano and mixed it in. The brown sugar topping was nice and tasty as well.

Followed exactly but meatloaf itself was bland. Sauce was great. Should have made more for dipping.

Mixture on top was very tasty. For the crumbs I grabbed the crumbs in chip bags, tortilla bags, and crackers and finished crumbling them. Worked good. Now I have another way to use up the last of those crunchy type stuff! I added a little fresh rosemary since I had some growing on the windowsill. Other than that I went by the recipe and was pleased with the result. Oh, I cooked the meatloaf in a covered clay pot. Last 15 minutes I need to remember to remove the lid so the meatloaf gets a chance to brown...

Delicious melt in your mouth. Used what I had on hand-half ground beef (grass fed) and half chicken. Sautéed onions and chopped green peppers, additional spices and a bit of garlic salt. The kicker was putting about 1/2 teaspoon of orange zest mixed in with tomatoe sauce.

Best meatloaf I've tasted. Read some of the review.. and I also added 2 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce, sautéed onion in butter and garlic. I used seasoned breadcrumbs. Taste so good and moist. Seasoned to my taste. Lovely.

omg!!!!  this was my first try making meatloaf, and this one is DA BOMB!!! and sooo easy to make!  Whoever said it wasn't good...your taste buds are dead!  I used 1 lb 90/10 sirloin and .8 lb 94/6 ground chuck.  There wasn't much grease.. only lots of flavor!  I used italian style bread crumbs, added green bell pepper and cut the mustard in half.  i sauted the green pepper, onion and some garlic in a bit of butter before mixing it in.  added just a bit of ws sauce also.  it was perfect.  any more mustard might have made the flavor too pronounced.  i think i might make more of the ketchup mixture next time.  definitely recommend this recipe.  it's delicious and you can adjust it to your tastes.  thanks allrecipe!!

I also sautéed onion celery and garlic before adding to mixture. I also added about two teaspoons of Dijon mustard. I used BBQ sauce instead of making sauce. This was so easy and delicious. I just cooked half and froze half for a future meal. My husband loved it!

This recipe was delicious!!!! I usually make my meatloaf with crackers and tomato sauce so I was skeptical about using milk and losing the texture of my crackers. But I took everyone's advice and added a little worsteshire sauce and sautéed my onions in garlic and butter. I did add my own twist though-- I cooked my onions down then added about half a pound of bacon and just cooked it for a few, for sure was still raw, and added it in my mixture. The best meatloaf I've ever made! Hubby ate so much we are both kicked back on the couch lol
I should also mention I didn't mess with the glaze. Good old fashion ketchup

The only changes I made were , we bought a hot ketchup at a farmers market and used it instead of ketchup.  LT's Angry ketchup gives it just a little kick that we like.

Really easy and tasty. My oven took a bit longer, but I'm converting to celcius so that's probably why. I also substituted panko for bread crumbs.

Delicious!!!! I used Club crackers instead of breadcrumbs (forgot to buy breadcrumbs), I used two eggs instead of one, and used 2lbs of ground chicken (I don't eat beef). Also I like cheeses on my loaf so I added some.

This was AMAZINGI  I didn't have bread crumbs so I was going for a slice or 2 of loaf bread when I saw the "bread crumbs or CRACKERS" in the ingredient list. I had about a 1/4 bag of cheezit crackers left  and decided to give it a try. I also added a tablespoon of minced garlic (jar) and 2 eggs, but cut the milk to half a cup. One cup of milk seemed way too much. A large whole onion was right on, even though I thought it would be too much. I did use the recommended 1 and 1/2 pounds of meat and added a tablespoon each of salt and pepper. I did not saute the onion, I just threw it in raw,  because it was easiest. I followed the directions on the topping and wouldn't really change it, I don't think.  It was a little "spicy" with 2 tbsp of prepared mustard so I might cut it next time to 1 tbsp. This was truly a great meatloaf - and, I have NEVER made good meatloaf, even when using a recipe. This was juicy and scrumptious.  It's a keeper for sure! And really easy. You cant go wrong with this recipe!  LOVE LOVE LOVE it.

Added the worchestire sauce to the meat and sauteed the onions in garlic like someone suggested and it's AWESOME!! I've made this a couple dozen times. Everyone loves it. The sauce mixture I have to double because everyone likes to get extra.  I make homemade potatoes with them. Soooooo good

Way too sweet for my taste, probably from the ketchup. In the future I'll probably replace the ketchup with tomato paste.

This made up a good every day meatloaf.  We made it as presented with the exception of substituting oats for bread crumbs -- gotta be gluten free.  Next time we will go with a splash or two of Worcestershire sauce and a plain ketchup glaze.

Pretty tasty, but maybe next time I'll use a lot less mustard or none at all and replace it with more ketchup. I may look into adding more herbs for more flavor too.   Everyone said they loved this recipe as is though. :)

The changes I made were: 1. Softened 1 onion and 2 cloves of fresh Garlic in a pan with a bit of Oil before adding it to the meat. 2. Added 2 Table Spoons of Worcestershire Sauce. 3. Used flavored Bread Crumbs 4. I didn't have any Milk so I didn't put that it. For the sauce I used 3 Table Spoons of Brown Sugar, I doubled the Ketchup and 1 Table Spoons of Mustard. I cooked it at 375 for an hour  without the sauce, then pulled it out added the sauce. Cooked it for another 20 min. It came out great!

I used 1lb ground Hamburg, didn't have an onion, so I used 1 tbsp onion powder. I used like a tiny dollop of minced garlic, sprinkled a bunch of salt & tiny bit of pepper (can't "season to taste" with raw meat...). Used 1 tbsp mustard, 4 tbsp light brown sugar, 1 tbsp dark, 1 cup ketchup (Hunt's all natural, prefer Heinz then 2nd choice is French's but hunts was the cheapest). Didn't have a loaf pan, so did my best to form it. 
Hubby says it's FANTASTIC! (He's usually pretty critical of my cooking). Said it was cooked perfectly, not over or under. Only suggestion was that his mom would make a layer in the middle of the ketchup sauce instead of just on top, so next time maybe do that middle layer of ketchup stuff.

This is really tasty! Because so many reviews complained that the sauce is too sugary, I decided to use a nice mushroom sauce instead. I followed the recipe for the loaf exactly (I only added some Worcestershire sauce for a bit of flavor) and it came out beautifully. I also saved a bit of the mushroom sauce to pour over the cooked loaf and it turned out fantastic. My husband and kids all had seconds!

I actually screwed this up, I was in a rush and added everything to the meat instead of making the sauce to pour over. You know what? It was delicious anyway. Also I added 2 tablespoons of soy sauce to it as well.  I needed another 15 minutes to cook it through and then broiled it to get a nice caramelized top. On it's own it was tender and tasty. 

Then I had an idea...

I made wine braised short ribs a few days ago and had lots of sauce left over, which would be a shame to waste. So, I mixed with the drippings from the meatloaf and used it as gravy over it and mashed potatoes. Y U M.

Based on a suggestion, I sautéed the onions (with some chopped garlic) before adding them to the meatloaf mix. I did use a mix of meat (pork, chicken, beef) and also added a bit of Worcestershire and liquid smoke. After I put the mustard, ketchup mix on, I added some breadcrumbs on the top. 

It did take longer than the hr to bake, about 1hr 20m.

This was much better than the meatloaf I used to make (which I loved as well) and it has become my new go to!

I did read a lot of reviews and used some of their tips to make this meatloaf. The meat itself came out excellent, but the topping was too sweet for my taste. I'll make this again using the meat recipe either without the topping, or with much less topping, or serve the topping on the side for those that want it.

I followed most of the recipe with some changes based on the most helpful reviews. I sautéed the onions, garlic, small diced carrots, and very small diced bell pepper in butter. Have to hide the veggies for the kiddos. I seasoned both the onion mixture and the breadcrumbs with italian seasoning, salt, pepper and garlic powder. I added about 1 tbsp. of bbq sauce instead of the W sauce to the meat. I changed the sauce a bit but cannot remember what the change was besides adding 1 tbsp. of bbq sauce to it. It was pretty good so will make again.

I am a horrible cook but this was so easy to make.  Due to a food allergy, I had to leave out the onions...everything else was per recipe.  My family loved this and just requested it for Thanksgiving.

It was very tasty!  I made it in muffin tins. I used bread crumbs instead of the oatmeal.

Simple to make and tasty, the glaze is the perfect topping. I used a mixture of ground beef and pork which I think makes a moister meatloaf.

Delicious and really easy. I sautéed the onions first just until they were soft and a little browned. Used gluten free bread crumbs and the texture was perfect. The sauce over the top is genius - I made mine with spicy brown mustard and it tasted almost like a barbecue sauce, but a little milder. SO GOOD!!

Great Recipe. Took the advice of a few other posters and increased the sauce amount, sauteed the garlic and onions in butter, and added celery to help retain moisture - it worked really well and the flavor wasn't prevalent at all. I piped mashed potatoes around the meatloaf during the last 20 minutes or so until the tops of them were just a bit brown / crunchy and it was delicious!

I wish I could give this a negative 5 stars. This would have to be the worst meatloaf I have ever had. Never mind the fact it had no taste or flavor. The addition of the ketchup and mustard mixture for the top was something disgusting in it's self. 
This was made for me for dinner and I typically don't pass up a home cooked meal. 

I do not recommend this recipe for anybody.

Great meatloaf recipe. My husband has hated meatloaf his entire life until I made this for him. 
*my modifications for this recipe included using "4c whole wheat seasoned breadcrumbs" and added 1 tablespoon of worchestshire sauce to meat mix. 
*for topping, used 1 tablespoon of Kosciusko spicy mustard, 1/3 cup ketchup, 2 tablespoon of light brown sugar and a light pinch of ground chipotle.
Came out AHHHH-mazing!

I made this recipe two days ago. my 2yr old son, my husband and I love it! It is nice and moist and my husband loved the sause. The only difference I made to the recipe is, I made twice as much sause and placed half on the bottom of the pan and the other half on the top of the meat.

I took half of the ketchup, mustard and brown sugar and mixed it into the meet and the other half poured it on top. It was delish, very moist and flavorful. A hit with my family!

I've made this recipe several times with various ground meats although I always use two pounds and keep the other ingredient measurements the same. It turns out perfect every time. Last time I used one pound lean ground beef and one pound ground turkey and it was fabulous! I'm using two pounds of ground turkey tonight and I'm sure it will turn out just as good. Great recipe! My husband agrees! Awesome meatloaf sandwiches the next day!!

This was an excellent recipe that my whole family loved.  I added extra pepper and probably 1 tsp or so of salt. I also used gluten free bread crumbs and used coconut sugar and spicy mustard in the sauce on top with Ketchup. Serviced it with yellow diced baked potatoes with herbed sunflower oil and salt and pepper and broccoli.

I'm almost famous around here for making undercooked meat loaves :) I wanted to find a recipe that I could not screw up and with all the positive reviews I thought I'd try this one.  I didn't even try without, I added the worcestershire to the meat and sauteed the onions first. I used alittle over 2 pounds of 90% lean meat, panko crumbs and 2% milk.  I ended up having to make a last minute dentist appointment for my son so instead of scrubbing the meatloaf in favor of take out I decided to put it all together earlier in the day and pop it in the fridge for 2-3 hours while we went to his appointment.  Came home and to be on the safe side I cooked it for 2 hours :) It was still moist and got really good reviews from my sons (hub was working). In that time the topping caramelized somewhat too and made a little bit of a crust. I should add that I have one of those healthy meatloaf pans where there is room for drainage at the bottom and you can just pick up the meatloaf out of the pan - I won't make this meatloaf again until I get another pan and I can double it  :) I think I may also make it the night before, foil the top and cook it next day instead of take out. I also oiled and spiced some small potatoes and put them in the oven at the same time. We like them well done so that was easy too :) Yay! :)

This meatload was bland and soggy. I only used a pound of lean ground beef, so perhaps the portions were out of whack. However I think this recipe really requires more seasoning. Seasoned bread crumbs might help? Used only one tbsp of brown sugar and added some steak sauce and the topping was delicious. Bottom-line: This recipe, as published requires amendments to be top-notch.

The meatloaf tasted pretty "grainy". The breadcrumbs were extremely heavy. I think next time I will be using oatmeal instead, or I plan to use half the breadcrumbs. I did like the flavor after I put about a tablespoon of Worcestershire and some minced garlic in it. I also used Heinz 57 on the top instead of the mixture.

I have used this recipe quite a few times now. I did however have to make a few changes after the first time making it to meet my families needs... first off with the brown sugar it is too sweet so I would recommend only half the sugar or most times I use bbq sauce instead. I add 1 TBS worstershire sauce and need to use 2 lbs ground beef. My kids HATE onions so I dice 1/2 onion and a stalk of celery..... in variation I use 1c shredded cheddar cheese in the middle (or mixed with the meat and diced mushrooms. For my husband sometimes i will add a can of diced tomatoes and chilies to the meat and 1tbs (or half if you don't like it spicy) of chili habanero sauce (or any hot sauce) to the topping. All these are delicious.

It was super simple to prep and make! So much so I had my nine year old and 6 year old help me do the prep! They had a ball! The only thing I changed was I put a couple of deli slices of ham in the middle. That's the way my mother made it, and I loved when she would do that. So I wanted to continue that with my children. Also I made it using 2 lbs of ground beef, I kept the same measurements of the ingredients the only thing I changed was I had to add on 20 more minutes of cook time. Which gave me enough time to finish the mash potatoes!

Perfect meatloaf. I make this at least twice a month, and I use Italian bread crumbs. I also double the ketchup sauce because, well, we're Southern and we love plenty of sauce on our food!

THIS is how meatloaf is supposed to taste. My only substitutions was to sauté the onion and some garlic in a little butter before adding to the hamburger mixture...and I accidentally left out the beef bullion. I baked it in a foil-lined 9 x 9 pan for 60 minutes. Cleanup was easy peasy. Delicious!

Best meatloaf I've made in awhile and made this one exactly as written except used italian breadcrumbs. I had given up on making meatloaf after so many failures but this one restored my faith.  The only problem I have with the recipe as written is it's pretty darn bland.  Next time I'll check out some of the reviews to see what people added to kick it up a notch but as is, it turned out good enough for dinner tonight and the glaze is very good too.

I added 2 tbsp. Worcestershire Sauce and a 1/2lb or ground pork for extra flavor.  It was moist and delicious!!

It's a great meatloaf! I made a few alterations that shined- subbed herbed stuffing mix (pepperidge farms) instead of bread crumb. I also added sautéed celery onion mix instead of just onion. I'm at high altitude too (5280) so it needed to cook for 20 minutes more than is called for.

It tasted really good, I will definitely make it again.  I covered it with foil the whole time and it was a little too moist.  Perhaps next time I will only cover it half the time.  Next time I will also double the sauce for the top and add more of the ingredients for a little more flavor. Meat mix could probably use Worcestershire sauce.

This was a good meatloaf recipe. The only changes I made to the original recipe was to add a packet of dry onion soup mix as well as a packet of dry ranch mix> I think this adds additional flavor to the meat to give it a better meatloaf taste rather than a burger taste. Great recipe though! Enjoyed by everyone.

We make this meatloaf on a regular basis. The only changes that we make is ground chicken vs beef, Italian bread crumbs and add green pepper. We have made the recipe as is as well and its great either way

This is very good and easy to make. I read  many of the reviews and the only thing I did different was add celery & 1/4 of a green pepper for moisture as some of you recommended. I put them in a food processor and processed into a chunky smooth consistency. It did come out very moist. I used seasoned bread crumbs. I cooked it for 1 hour, but the middle had a few pink spots, next time I will leave it in longer. I did not make the ketchup topping my family does not like ketchup.   I cooked it uncovered. Some have recommended 1tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce I will try that the next time I make this and their will be a next time. It still was very good without the topping.

Really good. I also add a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. To make clean up easier, I mix it all in a large ziplock bag (no getting my hands dirty) then I bake it on a tin foil lined cookie sheet (not a loaf pan). I use a cooling rack under the meat loaf as it cooks to allow any grease to dip off. It makes serving it a breeze.

This is by far the best meatloaf ever. My hubby HATED meatloaf before I made him this one and he now always asks for it. I've also used ground turkey and it was still amazing.

Very good!  Added worcestershire sauce to the meat, and used slightly less brown sugar based on reviews saying it was too sweet.  I also cooked an extra 10 minutes as it did seem to be too "juicy".

I've made several meatloafs over the years and this one will be my new go to.  Very simple and good flavor.  I doubled the ketchup and added worcestshire sauce and used good lean hamburger meat.

One of the best meatloaves I've tasted. I keep honey mustard on hand so cut the brown sugar to 1Tbsp.  It was still too sweet, but makes a great sauce. I added a little chopped  green  pepper  and sautéed with the onion, garlic and garlic salt. Turned out good. I will make again.

Came out really good! I added Worsteshire sauce and sautéed the onions as other users recommended. I doubled the sauce; next time I will triple it for layering once cooked for more flavor. My family loved it and all had seconds! I also used Italian flavored bread crumbs.

Was a little too wet. Made a variant of my own sauce, which was good (swapped Ketchup with Bullseye BBQ sauce, and added brown sugar and mustard). Also added Worcestershire sauce as one person suggested. Will modify again to try and dry it up a hair, maybe add less milk.

It was very good.  Followed recommendations in other reviews, primarily sautéing the onion w/some garlic and doubling up the sauce (w/reduced b/sugar & mustard).  Only thing I would be careful about is not "mounding" the meat mixture into a loaf shape in the pan since the shorter ends will be done before the middle is completely done.   This lead to the topping burning a bit.  I had to slice and finish off the middle part of the loaf in a sauté pan.  Still came out very good!  It's a keeper!!!

I make this meatloaf regularly, around once a month. I double the whole recipe because we eat like it's a contest. In a double recipe, I caramelize one big onion with a big spoonful of garlic, some garlic salt, pepper, and thyme/oregano. The other onion, I keep raw and stir it into the hot onion pan to cool it off a little, since I mix the meat mixture by hand.
The only other addition i make to my double batch is a packet of Lipton golden onion soup mix. Just like that, we're gourmet!

This was a very delicious and juicy meatloaf I followed the directions exactly as they said the only thing that I changed is the mustard content in the sauce I just used one tablespoon of mustard instead of 2 and it had just the right amount of Tang to it. Next time I will add a little green and red bell pepper but other than that I will use this recipe from now own.

I have made this exact recipe at least 6 times now and it is a huge favorite of the family and kids! I prefer with lots of onion but sometimes I will cut back the onion to whatever I have in the fridge and it is still delish!

I followed the recipe pretty close, I used 2lbs ground Elk and season the meat with garlic and onion powder, seasoning salt, and ground pepper. I had to bake it a little longer just due to the extra meat, but overall my family loved it!

I have tried a lot of meatloaf recipes over the years, but since trying this one, it is now my go-to.  It goes over very well in our house.  The other night I had to use up some ground pork, and decided to make meatloaf with it.  Although it was different than the ground beef meatloaf, it was still so good!

Great recipe,the sauce is just like mom used to make when I was a kid...I use 3 lbs of meat and sausage....so I double the ingredients...recommend making  extra sauce so you can nuke it and spread some on the un -sauced. part of the thick slice...

I love this super easy recipe. I adjusted things a bit. Made it 3lbs, 2 eggs per lb, and added a pkg   of lipton onion soup mix. Also put mozzarella in the middle for a little extra flavor.

This is my go-to meatloaf recipe.  It seemed weird to me to have a cup of milk, but it's really good.  I've added Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix and other sauces/spices and it always turns out really well.
I didn't like the mustard and brown sugar glaze (too sweet and too mustardy), so I use 2/3 ketchup to 1/3 Franks Red Hot sauce and top it with that.  Or skip it; it's still really good!

I have made this meatloaf countless times.
I left out the breadcrumbs and it still tastes great. I also did not make the brown sugar and ketchup mixture. I made my own sauce.

This worked out well for my family. I didn't have the components for my normal recipe but this came out better. The texture was smooth and the flavoring good. I didn't have any onions so I left those out. Salt and pepper to taste is little vague but that's what I do anyway. I did squash a bit on a plate and microwaved for thirty seconds to check the flavor. I will use this again.

It was ok but it just took too long to cook. If you love meatloaf, you should totally try it. But we aren't die hards so we probably will not make it again.

We made it using the ingredients as listed, but we put it in 4 small loaf pans and baked  for 45 minutes in a toaster oven at the temperature suggested. The sauce makes it special.

This turned out pretty well, but the "one onion" requirement is (in my opinion) a bit vague. In my case I used a very large yellow onion and ended up eating a meatloaf filled with chunks of half-cooked onion bits. If you have a very large onion I'd recommend using only half.

I added more brown sugar and ketchup than it called for. I was out of onions so had to used dried chopped onions as a substitute and it still turned out great! So I can only imagine if I had used the real thing. It tasted great for such a simple meal!

Tastey  but different from what we are used to.  Maybe I will use less onion next time.  Tastes great on a sandwich, cold, the next day.

This only gets a 5 star if you make the Glaze for the top! 

So I only made one lb and used one egg. Bumped up the Crackers a bit (I used saltines) other than that I followed the recipe for a serving of four exactly. 

My husband is super picky and pretty much hates the taste of ground beef, he LOVED IT and SO DID I!  

Glaze: 3 tsp ketchup, 1 tsp honey and 1/2 tsp worschesire

This  was very very good. Me being me I did not read the recipe all the way through and I mixed the ketchup and brown sugar in the beef mixture. It  was awesome. Also, l left out the onions as my family does not like them. Can only imagine it is even better with onions. Will definitely make again.

I added worchestershire sauce, skipped the onions and just added onion powder and garlic powder.  Piled the mashed potatos on top and called it Mountain Meatloaf.  The kids loved it!

My family requests this meatloaf at least once a week. I've used ground turkey and ground beef both are excellent!

As others suggested, I sauteed the onions first. I also used only a half onion since some family members don't like onions. And I was out of ketchup (aah!) so I used cocktail sauce (with extra mustard to cut the horseradish flavor). It was a complete hit!

very good.  I don't like mustard so I didn't have any.  I substituted with steak sauce and some hot sauce. If I were to use hot sauce again I'd not use the chicken wing stuff and I'd either use hotter sauce or more of it.  I put in 1 tbls of each the steak sauce and the hot sauce.

My husband and kids love love loved it! Yes it is sweet, but thats what keeps you coming back for more. mmmmmm good.  My husband was talking about this meatloaf over breakfast this morning, LOL! If you like sweets, then youll enjoy this delicious main dish. I doubled everything except the onions. I didn't even sauteed the onions. I did  put the oven on 375 degrees, and let it cook for 1 hour and 15 mins, and did not cover the dish at all. It came out better than expected.

I am vegetarian but I made this for my family and they LOVED it! I used Italian bread seasoned bread crumbs mixed with hot n' spicy bread crumbs for a little kick. Definitely will be making this for them again.

Love this meatloaf, and I am not a meatloaf lover, by any means. My hubby and mother in law give it too thumbs up as well! I microwave the chopped onion In a little bit of water for about a minute or two, to soften, and then dump the onions and onion water mixture into my big bowl with the other ingredients. I also make extra glaze and make sure the whole loaf is nicely coated for the extra yum factor.

delicious and moist. after reading the reviews,  I sautéed the onion with olive oil and garlic and added a dash of worchestershire to the meat mixture.  next time,  I will also ad about 1/3 of the glaze to the meat mixture.  
I made these in muffin tins,  450° for 20 minutes.

This is my favorite meatloaf recipe. I wrote it down and put it in my recipe book. I always add worcestershire sauce. It makes it taste so much better. A lot of people have said it taste like a desert because of the topping but that is our favorite I double that. I guess it would be something picky kids would love. I also don't put that much onions in it. A whole onion is way too much. I am making this tonight. The leftovers are even better! My family begs me to make this all the time.

Great recipe! I sauteed the onions with some garlic and a little butter as recommended by others. Kids had it in ciabatta buns with some cheddar, tomatoes, red onions and pickles and loved it.

I tried this recipe today as a treat for my son, the onion for him was overwhelming, and the sweetness was nice, especially on the burnt parts, but my oven isnt the best, and I used a glass dish rather than a metal loaf pan, so I'm sure those factors contribute to us nothing liking this 100% but it was good, and filling. I normally would have free formed it, and added the ketchup topping last, but overall, a good quick dish.

I made this according to the recipe except I used a box of Stouffer's Stove Top Stuffing (Herb flavored) instead of bread crumbs. I soaked them in the milk as indicated. I also made extra sauce and put it on the table for folks to add to their taste. Oh so good on French bread the next day as leftovers too!

Use ground beef or else you'll  be disappointed.  I used ground beef the first time and it was delicious!  The  second time, I used ground turkey and it was awful.  If you are going to use ground turkey, use less liquids  or up the bread crumbs and you'll also want to add some spices because it's bland.

Added celery, green bell pepper, garlic chopped small, only added 1/2 cup milk and a little Worcester shire sauce. Comes out great each time.

This is an excellent meatloaf recipe. I am not a meatloaf lover but my husband is and he loved. He set aside 2 slices for his meatloaf sandwich for lunch. I did make a few changes though; I omitted the egg and milk and I used Pace Hot Picante Sauce, also used Panko Crispy Bread Crumbs,2  finely chopped fresh mushrooms, and 3 slices of a habanero pepper chopped finely for a little spice. Delish!!!

This makes very quick meals and a cheaper alternative with bread to traditional burgers.  All ingredients are to taste, but as instructed, I think it's about right.

I am not a big onion fan so I used minced onion instead.  We are also cutting back on sugar so for the topping I only used tomato sauce and it was still so yummy.

I never make anything according to the recipe because rarely do I have all the ingredients on hand. I used 3 teaspoon  honey mustard instead of prepared mustard.  Used a little brown sugar and added a specialty mixture of Vidalia and orange marinade, make sure to use a chopper to make sure the Vidalia onion is finely chopped. I spread half the mixture at beginning of cooking, then 10 minutes prior to end, I  added the rest of topping with breaded onions.   I added a teaspoon of Italian seasoning to the breadcrumbs.   Turned out great, goes great with frozen peas and butter, and mashed potatoes.  Not your old fashioned meat loaf for sure....

This is a easy recipe. And it came out so good. I did not have brown sugar so I added white sugar which made it sweet so next time I will  try it with brown sugar.  Thanks agin for the recipe.

CHANGES:
1. Reduce the milk to 3/4 cup.
2. Add 1 cup of carrot: shredded, then chopped, and then lightly sauteed, to the meatloaf mix.
3. Lightly saute the chopped onion. 
4. May use parsnip or potato chips, crushed, for the bread crumbs, for a gluten free meatloaf. 
5. Use an extra egg.
6. Double the ketchup mixture. Or make it with some 'heat': 2/3 c ketchup, 3 T brown sugar, 1 T mustard, 1 tsp vinegar, 1 tsp hot sauce.  
7. Top the meatloaf with the sauce before baking the meatloaf. 
8. Bake meatloaf, uncovered, at 375-F, 1 hr 25 minutes, if you're baking potatoes at the same time. You may even bake the potatoes (and carrots) in the pan along side the meatloaf, roast-style, or you may bake the potatoes separately, but potatoes need 375-F or hotter to convert the starch.
9. Bake the meatloaf, uncovered, at 325-F, 2 1/2 hrs, if you have the time, for deeper flavor. 
10. LET the just-baked meatloaf REST 15 minutes before serving.
11. MAKE AHEAD TIPS: cover unbaked meatloaf after placing it in a sprayed loaf pan and refrigerate it. Next day, bake it.
OR bake it and then rest it to room temp. Cover and refrigerate it. Next day, bake it at 350-F for 25 minutes.
12. You may form this into a loaf (or double it and form it into loaves) and refrigerate it, then bake the meatloaf resting directly on a cooling rack that is placed in a sprayed, lipped cookie sheet. This is especially good if you want to make it for sandwiches. (Use a lipped cookie sheet that the cooling rack fits into,

Wonderful!  Very moist and flavorful (with adjustments, substitutions, and add ins ).  I took the advice from other reviewers and used seasoned breadcrumbs, sautéed green bell pepper mushrooms and garlic with the onions.  For the sauce: I used one tbsp of mustard plus one tbsp of Worcestershire sauce instead of two tbsp of mustard and Heinz Sriracha ketchup instead of regular ketchup.  The heat from the sriracha tames and compliments the  brown sugar nicely.  I will definitely make this one again.

This is a very good recipe for anyone who needs to take it slow or doesn't want to put forth too much effort. I would recommend adding Worcestershire sauce and a little Tony Chachere to the meat. It gives it a great flavor. You can use ground chicken or turkey for a less greasy/fatty taste. Also, make more sauce than is recommended.

This was easy to make, I substituted water for milk due to dietary sensitivities. I thought the meat needed more seasoning, such as garlic and the topping was way too sweet. The kids who tried it really liked it.  I'm going to try another recipe next time though.

I made the recipe and followed other reviewer's suggestions. I doubled the sauce mixture but reduced the amount of mustard ( perhaps bit more than half of what recipe asks for), added the tbsp of Worcestershire sauce, used seasoned bread crumbs. I went further and finely chopped up some carrots and mushrooms and sautéed them with the onions. The result was a tender and juicy meatloaf.  The key is to let the meatloaf rest after its out of the oven!

Made it and enjoyed it, as did the family.  Even the picky 2 year old enjoyed it and that's saying something.  The 10 year old was disappointed there weren't leftovers for lunch the next day.  I used crackers instead of bread crumbs, added a bit of Worcestershire sauce per the most helpful review and also sauteed the onions.  Paired it with mac and cheese and broccoli.  I'll make again.

This recipe is really an easy meatloaf. It took no time at all. I cooked the onions and added a few bits of diced pepper and took the advice of other reviews and added the Worcestershire sauce. I think when I make this again I will decrease the brown sugar to 1 1/2 instead of 2 but that's just my preference

This is such an easy and delicious recipe! I've actually made this about 3 times since finding it, and the one time I made one following an Alton Brown recipe, my husband was deeply disappointed and said I can only make this one from now on! I didn't really make any changes to it, except for the time I had to use Italian bread crumbs because I was out of regular and it was it even better!

I caramelized the onions to a nice golden brown and added  fresh minced garlic.  I tented it with aluminium foil as it cooked then browned the top at the end!!!!  My husband LOVES IT!!! Next time I'll try adding a little worcestershire sauce for an added zing!!!!

Yummy, easy, what more can you ask for? 
I used 2lbs of ground chuck, so I upped everything else just a bit; used seasoned stuffing instead of bread crumbs.  It was a bit crumbly when I went to serve it, but no one minded, we just scooped it out and ate it all up!!  I would probably bake it just  little longer next time.  So good, thanks for the recipe.

I used this recipe for a basic set of instructions; did NOT have cracker or bread crumbs, so I crushed up some corn tortilla chips instead, did not add salt or use the brown sugar. I added chipotle salsa and some Tapatio hot sauce to please the Hispanic food lovers at my home.

Easy, good, and flavorful. I did as others recommended and doubled the ketchup, added Worcester sauce, and grilled my onions. It was  but sweet for me, next time I will half the brown sugar. Also for me personally I will do a longer cook time, it was a bit mushy. However I will be honest and say I did not let it rest after pulling it out is the oven.

Great basic recipe.  Did make some changes.  Used one pound of ground beef + one pound of ground pork.  Instead of the bread crumbs or crackers I used two slices of sandwich bread torn into fine pieces.

Reminded me so much of my mom's recipe that got lost in transition in her later years.  Since my husband is not an onion person, I substituted 1-1/2 tsp of onion powder for the chopped onion, and it turned out perfect...  we all loved it!  Will definitely be our "go-to" recipe for meatloaf from now on.  Thanks for sharing Janet :-)

I wanted an easy meatloaf and this is it! The only thing was I only had a scant pound of ground beef, so the end product was super moist and barely held together. It held together, and was delicious and easy. Just what the doctor ordered after a hard day's work. bravo!

This was an awesome recipe! Super simple and easy! I added thick slices of bacon on top when I made it. The meat loaf it's self istorage good but with it being simple I'd cook the onions in butter or toss some garlic in for a bit more flavour. But over all a great meal! Definitely putting this in my cook book.

I usually make turkey meatloaf but after seeing the reviews I decided to give it a try.   Wow.  It was awesome. My hubby loved it so much that he may never want turkey meatloaf again :)

Really really good! Added Worcestershire sauce to the sauce as well, no more than a dash when I doubled the recipe, and I used less mustard as well as a little more what was called for with the ketchup. Also, used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, though only a 3/4 cup.

This is a great basic meatloaf recipe, which is really the only meatloaf I like.   I browned the onions in butter first as I found there were too many and not done enough when I didn't.  I also left off the brown sugar topping, I just drizzled some ketchup on top.  I found it needed about 20 extra minutes in the oven too. Came out perfect with the minor onion adjustment.

Family really enjoyed this.  Had to made a couple of changes due to wheat allergy.  Used 8 large mushroom (minced) instead of breadcrumbs and heavy cream instead of milk.  Also minced 3 cloves of garlic.

Since my family does not like onions, I omitted them and I added Worcestershire sauce, I didn't measure just what I wanted.  The glaze I substituted sweet baby ray's BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.  I also used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain or crackers.  This was delicious and I now have a meatloaf recipe that my family will eat!

Great meatloaf! My boyfriend couldn't get the meatloaf recipe from his family so we found this one! He said it was probably better than his family member's! 

We sautéed the onion as well! (I got to pick my first onion from the garden!) and added chives and garlic salt. We made our own breadcrumbs too! For the sauce, we did about 1 1/2 tbs mustard instead of 2 and about 1 2/3 tbs of the brown sugar. Also doubled the ketchup. 

All in all really great meatloaf! We had it with brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. My boyfriend loves it! I'm excited to try it in a sandwich tomorrow!

Made it exactly as written, kind of bland, definitely mushy. Decent flavor, i give 3 stars because too little seasoning is better than too much.

Excellent recipe!! This was my first time making a meatloaf. I made it with 2/3 lean ground beef and 1/3 extra lean ground chicken. I added some dried oregano to the meat mixture, and sautéed both vidalia onion and garlic. 

Didn't want ketchup for the sauce, so I baked with a homemade tomato sauce for the top. 

It was excellent!! My husband who had never had meatloaf (but plenty of meatballs) absolutely loved it! Great recipe. Thank you.

So I'm usually not a fan of meatloaf, my husband is though so I decided to make this recipe and I must say I actually kind of like it. =] So I will definitely be making meatloaf more often from now on.

My family loves this recipe!  The milk makes it so moist.

The only thing I suggest due to my family's preferences would be to use crushed saltines in place of bread crumbs; also, we leave out the onion for my daughter.

I've made this a few times now, as the recipe is written and a few of my own tweaks. It's very good as written, but using only ground beef makes it a bit too greasy in my opinion. So the second time I made it I used 1/2 lb of ground turkey and 1 lb of ground beef.. much better, also added lipton onion soup mix, cheese cracker crumbs and 2 T of worcestershire sauce. Enjoyed it much better this way. I always make the sauce as directed but rarely use all of it.  Will keep tweaking and making this one.

I added 1 tbsp as recommended in many of the reviews. The meatloaf was swimming in fats (yes I used 90/10) and was very crumbly. In the future I think I'd use less milk, maybe add another egg, and cook it a bit longer.

I used half an onion and Home Style stuffing cornbread. I also used ground turkey! It was so good and calorie friendly. The ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar was GENIUS! I'll definitely be making this again!

Doesn't  get any easier than this.( Followed recipe as suggested) I happen to Love it bc, it's a very flexible recipe to add too. I went with the 3 meats beef,veal and pork added Worcester sauce to taste with a teaspoon di jon mustard and ketchup( a bit less than recommended). ( mix separately ) Added garlic by the hand full (my preference )and Italian seasoning mix. With seasoned bread crumbs and bread and 2 eggs. 350 for just over an hr and then topped it off with the sauce for the last 10-15 mins at 400. Let sit for 5 to 10 mins and cut and enjoy. Serve with stringbeans on the pan with olive oil (just to coat pan) ,bread crumbs and pepper.(5 to 10 max mins)This is NOT a sweet recipe bc I rather bitter (for lack of a better word) I've cook this about 5 times now and it's a hit every time. (Or at least thats what they tell me to be nice) I hope that u enjoy this as much as I do...
Bon Appétit!

This recipe is super easy. I like to cook but have never made a meatloaf. I only had 1lb of beef and I didn't have any bread crumbs, so, I used a smaller pan, found some stovetop stuffing (which added a really nice spice), and used 3/4 C milk. We also used Dijon mustard for the topping which added even more flavor. All in all,  supper easy, great taste, and we even had leftovers which where even better the next day.

I used 1 cup oatmeal and 1/2 sleeve saltine crackers in mine since I didn't have any breadcrumbs (or bread for that matter, LOL!). I also added Worcestershire sauce and barbeque sauce to the ketchup mixture. I covered my pan loosely with foil for the first 30 minutes of bake time, so the top wouldn't get too browned. It turned out very moist. I will definitely be making this again!

Made it twice and learned to use foil for easy cleaning. Also added 1 1/2 tablespoon w sauce , sautéed 1 onion and 2 garlic cloves in 1tbs of butter. I didn't add all brown sugar to the ketchup and mustard mix I only sprinkled a little bit on top. I used Panko seasoned bread crumbs and noticed it holds meatloaf better. Other than that SO TASTY....

I've made it twice now. I changed meat mixture to 1lb ground beef and 1lb ground sausage. Added 1tsp of chili sauce to sauce topping. My son never eats meatloaf but he asked for seconds.

This was the best meatloaf me and my family have ever had. Used 2 lbs. of hamburger, 2 eggs, all other ingredients to the recipe, cooked 45 minutes covered, then 45 minutes uncooked. It was moist and delicious.

I wanted to share a slight alternative to this recipe.  Instead of using brown sugar, mustard and ketchup, use tomato paste on top.  Just leave out the brown sugar and mustard and when the meatloaf is cooked, before serving, spread tomato paste on top.  It's so good and the way my mom always made it.

My family loved this meatloaf.  It was absolutely delicious.  I did take one of the reviewers suggestion to saute onions with garlic, double the ketchup, cut back on the mustard and add a little worcestershire sauce.  Will be making this again and again!

I used ground up oat flour instead of bread crumbs.  Natural grass-fed beef.  Family said best ever.   Next time I may cook the onions first.

This is a fabulous recipe. I used a combo of ground beef, veal and pork. Otherwise followed recipe exactly. The easiest meatloaf ever, and by far the best of many meat loaves I have made over more than 40 years cooking. Recommend you use a meat thermometer set to 170F for well done. Thank you.

It was good.  I am satisfied, considering this was my first time making a meatloaf.  It could use a little extra seasoning, but the texture is soft and easy to eat.

Haven't made meatloaf forever, found this recipie and thought why not give it a shot. I didn't look at any reviews before making, the only change I did was cut the brown sugar in half as I'm not a real fan of sweet in my meals. And boy did this taste fantastic I loved the texture and how well it held together, the meatloaf stayed very very moist which really makes a meatloaf enjoyable. Fairly simple flavours which was perfect by me. Next time I make this dish I am going to try adding mushrooms and lots of garlic and celery. However to me this is a five star recipe as written. That you for such a good meal.

Other than the fact that I didn't have mustard and I placed some tomato and onion slices on top of the sauce, everything was as is and my family loved it.... this is definitely going to be one of my new signature dishes...

This is a great recipe! Very moist and delicious. The only thing that I do different is that I substitute the onion with a packet of Lipton onion soup mix and I double the sauce. Then I cover the entire meatloaf with strips of bacon. It comes out amazing. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I followed the recipe but I didn't use onions because I used a bag of Lipton onion soup in the meat mixture and I added Parmesan cheese as well.  I didn't make the ketchup sauce instead topped it with Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce.  Very simple to make, and quick.

Wow!  Best meatloaf I have made in ages. I did make the following changes. 
1. I didn't have onion so I used onion powder. 
2. I used fresh minced garlic that you can buy in a jar. 
3. I added Worcester sauce to the meat mixture. 
4. I used Italian breads crumbs. 
5. Once the meat was shaped a applied a thin coat of tomato paste. 
6. I double the recipe for the sauce.  Did one less tsp of mustard and added apple cider vinegar to cut the sweetness and thin out the mixture. Added til I got the taste and consistency I wanted. 
7. Covered with foil to keep it moist. 
The whole family came back for seconds!

I added worcestershire and grilled onions per other suggestions. I also added some fresh jalapeno for spice, which was great.  To be fair, meatloaf is not my favorite dish; a meatloaf fan might give it five stars.

Made it this evening and my family loved it.  My husband didn't like meatloaf because he's moms was dry.  He asked that I make it again.  It's gone, we ate the WHOLE THING! Great recipe.  Thanks!

Excellent easy recipe.  I followed other recommendations (about cooking onions in butter, using seasoned breadcrumbs, and adding worcestershire sauce).  I doubled the recipe and put the extra in my freezer.  I would also recommend making more sauce.  You can easily lower the sugar amount, if desired.  Will definitely make again.

My hubby is PICKY and he loved this version of meatloaf.  I was worried because of the ketchup, but he has been raving about it for a week.  I know that's when he's telling me to make it again.

Used tips from other reviews. Turned out a little sweet for me. But I still liked it. Will just use less brown sugar next time.

Really enjoying this recipe, even for a beginner like me. as we speak my second attempt is in the oven. I substituted the ketchup glaze for BBQ sauce, and added some jalapenos to give the meat a bit more kick. I like this recipe because it's very straight forward, but still allows for a bit of experimentation.

My family loved this. Substituted onion with French's fried onions to our liking.  We're not onion fans but love the ones mentioned.  Used seasoned Bread crumbs and doubled up on  the sauce. I cut out some brown sugar and used spicy mustard. Delicious

I would probably add Worcestershire sauce next time as others suggested, but I made it as is just to try out and it was still good! I borrowed my husband's ketchup with the Sriracha sauce in it and it gave it a good tangy flavor.

This is my go to recipe!   Love it!  I tweak it because of my own taste buds, which always needs garlic  (just garlic powder = 1 tsp), and oregano (1 tsp) but nonetheless, it's excellent and easy to follow.  I also add a small layer of mozzarella cheese to the top, then the sauce, and then another layer of  shredded mozzarella/parrmesean) half way through cooking).  I cannot live without cheese!  Delicious!  But, that's me, this recipe is 5 stars regardless of tweaking.  Good job!

This was a great recipe. Like other reviewers I sautéed the onions first and added worsteschire. My super picky 2 year old that only eats hot dogs ate two helpings. Will make it again... Possibly even tomorrow since there were no leftovers lol

Excellent recipe for meatloaf. I though it was a bit too mushy so next time will try with less milk and maybe add more breadcrumbs to the mix. Husband loved it. The topping was great, I didn't think it was too sweet like I read in another review and plan on making it again

I added roasted red peppers in a jar (diced), 1/3c of ketchup to the beef, about a 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder and about a tsp of adobos all seasoning . I also cut the milk down to about 3/4 of a cup since I was adding ketchup to the meat. Seemed like the original version would be to bland for my liking since I'm Italian. ?? anyway I think it came out delicious!

I was in a hurry, and made this exactly as written.  My entire family loved it, even the picky eaters.  My only complaint was that I used 1.4 lbs of ground beef and it took 1.5 hours to cook!  I even turned up the oven to 375 at the 40 minute mark.  I cooked in a glass loaf pan.  Cooking time aside, this was a very tasty and very moist meatloaf.  The sauce was a great compliment, though next time I'll double the sauce to pour over it once sliced (the rest of my family thought it was perfect as is, I just like things a little saucy personally).  This one is a keeper and my entire family told me it was the best meatloaf I've ever made.  :)

It was delicious! All was the same except I had 2 lbs hamburger so I added a couple tablespoons of tomato paste and went over cup of milk. I added tsp. Salt and 1/2 tsp. Pepper.

Here I am, over a year later, having made it again. I was in a big hurry so quickly read the ingredients and threw it all in, not even measuring properly except the cup of milk. Added extra ketchup as I didn't have an egg. Filled my little loaf pans and checked back for the topping. What a laugh I had! I had added the ketchup, (dijon) mustard and brown sugar in with the 2lbs burger! So I just put ketchup on top. Well, it was the most delicious I'd had!! We loved it! PS only had about 1/3 cup bread crumbs left so added in a handful of regular Quaker oats. Plus healthy dose Worcester sauce. Proves how meatloaf is so versatile. This is a great recipe, with or without subs and tweaks. I did NOT saute onions but chopped them small. Perfect!

Made exactly according to recipe the first time for Mother's Day 2016.  Very moist, quite easy to concoct; parents thought it very tasty.  It traveled well the 15+ miles to their house and re-heated beautifully without drying out (oven on 250 degrees for the time it took to cook everything else; about 15 minutes.)  My mom suggested reducing the amount of milk just slightly so the loaf wasn't quite so "loose."  Adding worcestershire sounds good to me - wondering if it would be better in the sauce rather than the loaf to offset the sweetness.  Hmmm - something to think about next time.  I would make this again.

I really liked this meatloaf! It was super easy unlike the recipe I usually use. I did cook the onions in olive oil before mixing it in. I also used Italian bread crumbs as suggested by others. That's all I did different. At first I didn't like the sauce when I was mixing it the mustard was too string but after it cooks it's perfect the way it is! Thank u for the recipe!

Delicious! Followed the top advice: sautéed the onions in butter, added some worcestershire sauce, cut the mustard a bit and added a bit more ketchup.

This is a very basic recipe and I like a little more in my meatloaf so I upgraded a bit....
-Instead of 1.5 lbs. of beef I used 1 lb. of beef and 1 lb. of hot sausage
-I used Italian Bread crumbs
-For the mustard I used Spicy Brown Deli Mustard
-Like the other reviewers, I cooked my chopped onion in butter for a bit to soften it up
-I served this with Oven Roasted Red Potatoes and it was an amazing meal.

I've made meatloaf for years, but this is my new go to recipe. I loved the topping. I did add a bit of a pepper/garlic mix I had and a bit of Lowrey's seasoning salt to the mixture. I sauteed my onions first as my husband likes them very soft.   I was curious how the brown sugar, mustard and ketchup would end up tasting, but I'll never use another topping again!

I made it exactly and found the cook time to not be long enough.  I have altered it since then using ground turkey in place of beef.  I also mix in 4oz shredded cheddar and 1 tbl spoon Worcestershire to both the turkey and the sauce.  My family likes it a lot more with those changes.

I've made this 3 times now and love it. I added some chopped bell pepper and increased the ketchup brown sugar mix as others suggested, spreading some on the bottom of my pan and the rest on top. I'll probably keep tinkering as I use it as a base recipe.

We love this recipe. With a house full of boys, it is filling and tastes great. 

I do add grated parmesan cheese to it to give it some more flavor, as well as garlic.

In the sauce on top, I add tangy BBQ sauce instead of brown sugar because the brown sugar made it too sweet.

I've been making this meatloaf for years and it is excellent! The only thing different that I do is use ground turkey instead of beef and add some garlic powder. I wait to put the ketchup topping on it until it has already been in oven for 30 minutes. This will keep it from burning.

Whole family loved this. I doubled sauce recipe and used a mixture of pork and beef (2lbs total not 1 1/2) Like skygirl I sautéed onions with a clove of garlic and added a good splash of Worcestershire sauce. I formed into loaf and cooked in lasagna pan with tinfoil on bottom.  This will be my meatloaf recipe from now on.

I made the recipe exactly as stated and it is very very good.  A definite go to!  I made extra tangy sauce and was so glad I did.  Next time I will add some thyme into the mix to give it just a perfect touch.  Thanks for sharing this with us.

Made this tonight, it was delicious! I didn't have any breadcrumbs or crackers, so I used Stove Top stuffing..and OH MY GOD!! I used 2 small packs of ground beef with the full package of Stove Top stuffing, 2 eggs, 1 cup of milk, ground pepper and a dash of salt and 1 medium sized onion, I didn't grease my 8 mini loaf pan...the sauce was amazing, but as others stated, next time I will double maybe even triple the batch. 

I don't think I will try it with the peppers and mushrooms though, as it is suppose to be a meatloaf, not a veggie loaf but I did however make steamed veggies(broccoli, cauliflower and carrots) and a baked potato mashed with a bit of butter then topped with some chives, real bacon bits, cheese and sour cream.

Also the next time I cook this, I will maybe line my 8 mini loaf pan with a strip each of bacon before filling them with the ground beef mixture ...mmmmm bacon ;)

I've made this recipe countless times and everyone loves it.  I tweaked it by using  italian breadcrumbs or seasoned panko crumbs, and adding dried parsley flakes (like my mom always did).  I saute the onions in a little garlic along with some green peppers.  This recipe turns out perfect every time, and you can even use ground turkey and it always tastes great!

just use bbq sauce .Its the same thing . Also use a pkg. of onion soup mix soaked in a little water stirred in. Layer the top with sliced cheese(your choice) and bake 10 mins. at end.

I used yellow mustard for the "prepared mustard" ingredient and that was a big mistake. All I taste is mustard. And with the brown sugar, the topping is way too sweet.

I agree with another review that the sauce was too sweet. When I make this again (and I will), I'll use one tablespoon of brown sugar instead of two.

I followed the other comments and added about a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture, sauteed the onions in a little butter and garlic (I used garlic powder) just for a few minutes until the onions were softened, and doubled the ketchup in the sauce mixture. It was delicious!!!!! Will make again.

This was my first time to make meatloaf, and it turned out great! I used ground turkey instead of beef, and it was so moist and delicious. I only baked it for 45 minutes, and that was just right.  I will definitely make this again.

I think this recipe is a good start.  I read the reviews and I browned my onions with some garlic before mixing it, however you miss the texture in the meatloaf when you do this - almost tasted mushy?  I made it a 2nd time and I actually put crackers in the meatloaf and I used only 1 tsp of brown sugar in the topping - was amazing!!  Customize this recipe to how you want it - is very easy to make!

This was delicious! As others mentioned, I sauteed the onions, added about 1 tbs Worcestershire sauce and about 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the meat mixture.  I also doubled the sauce, which would be a great idea regardless, but was especially helpful since I used 2 pounds of beef. Then formed it into a loaf, baked it for 1.25 hours and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Stayed together when sliced and tasted amazing! Family approved! Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This is a great base to use for a meatloaf recipe.  I make a barbecue meatloaf using this recipe with a few tweaks! I add 1 chopped green pepper, low-sodium Spam(blended), and 2 tbs of barbecue sauce.  I mix bbq sauce and syrup for the topping.  I also use ground turkey instead of beef.  It's amazing!!!!

I followed the recipe to a T and it came out awful. It was just too bland and I think the milk made it too mushy. I will just stick to my own recipe.

I have made this recipe plenty of times (over 10) and everyone who I have made it for, loves it! I don't do the brown sugar on top, I just put ketchup in the mix and put it on the top and use no mustard. I also do put a little more breadcrumbs in it but not much more. I use the Italian flavor bread crumbs. Everything sticks together just fine and it is delicious! I also cover it with aluminum foil for the first 45 minutes and take it off for the last 15 minutes. Cooks perfectly! Definitely recommend to anyone!!

Excellent, I followed the reviews and added 1 tblsp of Worcestershire sauce, sautéed the onions prior to adding, and then also added about 1/3 cup of grated parmesan cheese, 1 tsp oregano, and 1 tsp parsley.  I also used the topping from The Pioneer Woman's Italian meatloaf, which included chopped tomatoes, brown sugar, and mustard powder.  It turned out really delicious.

Great, simple recipe. I made it as directed with a few minor tweaks. For example, I used seasoned breadcrumbs and only one tablespoon of sugar and mustard. I also used pimento peppers for additional flavour as well as a little Parmesan cheese. Would definitely make again!

It was so easy to make! I had 1.5 lbs of lean ground beef and when it cooked it shrunk and had to drain a lot of juices. Next time I'll use extra lean hopefully that will take care of the shrinking and excess juices. I covered it with foil for the first hour and cooked uncovered for the last 25 mins in a metal loaf pan. For the sauce, bf doesn't like mustard so I used chipotle BBQ sauce and I only used 1 TBS brown sugar. I also sautéed the onions and garlic before putting it in the mix and added Worcester sauce to the meat.

This was a very good and easy recipe. I did as others and sautéed the onions and added Worcestershire s sauce to the meat mixture. That gave it a nice kick.  Next time I may also add some mushrooms  because we like them. You could also add other items to your liking, peppers and salsa might give it a little southwest flare.

I also did as some others have done, I sauteed the onions and garlic.  I added like a tsp of rosemary, chili powder and cayenne pepper to the mix as well.  I broke mine into two smaller pans and covered one with half the recipe ketchup mix, on the other i mixed about 2 Tablespoons of  BBQ sauce into the remaining ketchup mix.

I made a 3lb meatloaf and changed up just a few things. My daughter does not like onion so, this time I used my emulsifier to really blend the onions up and I added diced garlic.  About 6 cloves.  I also used 2 cups of breadcrumbs but only 1.5 cups milk, the onion adds moister.  I mixed the milk and breadcrumbs together and let sit for a few mins while I added my salt and pepper.  It came out delish.  This is how I will be making it from now on.

Best meatloaf ever.  I did add crushed saltines instead of bread , tomato paste instead of ketchup and added Worcestshire to the glaze.  Also added one can of original Rotel crushed tomatos and chilis to the meat mixture.  Served with Au Gratin potatos.  My girlfriend loved it.

Made this multiple times and it's went over very well no matter who was eating it. The only thing I change is the I leave out the onion (no one that has been here likes onions) and add a little extra meat (maybe 1/4lb.), and substitute the mustard for barbecue sauce!

Well...me and my son gets really hungry so we thought we would try this recipe which was the easiest we could find. It didn't work for us. It ended up looking like scrambled eggs with a sweet salty taste. We had 3 lbs of meat so we trippled everything. One tray of eggs and well we didn't have bread crumbs or cracker so we used cookies instead and a bag of milk and cooked for 1 hr. We ended up going to McDonalds instead.

I make it gluten free by substituting 1/2 cup oatmeal for bread crumbs.  I also leave out the onion because my son doesn't like it, and I add a tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder.  We love the glaze topping and we never have leftovers!

I cooked this easy meatloaf for the 3rd time and i prefer the taste of  raw onions and garlic rather than pre cooked. I also omitted the brown sugar,the sweet/tangy taste of ketsup and mustard taste better because it was too sweet before.It was a hit for my 2 adult sons and my husband...indeed it was so easy to make! Also i added some raisins to the meatloaf!

I did saute the onions in butter first and used Italian bread crumbs. I also cooked it a total of 1 hr and 30 mins.
Someday I'll add the mushrooms and bell pepper, that sounds great!
My family loved this recipe.

Made a tasty moist meatloaf.  I used 1lb beef and 1/2lb turkey and added 1 Tbsp worschesture.  I didn't sauté the onions beforehand as some had suggested and don't think this would be necessary.  Topping amount was right on.

This has become a staple dish in our house! I love the recipe, it's easy and you can always add things to suit other people's taste (onions, garlic powder, seasoned breads crumbs, etc). The only thing I do differently is I bake it in a muffin tin... We call them "meaffins," as it makes for easier portion sizes (and easier to take leftovers to work).

I made a few changes to this recipe....

I use 2 pounds or more of meat and keep the amounts the same. 


I added worcestershire and the topping into the meat. Instead of bread crumbs I use butter crackers and smoosh them up enough to make a cup (in a liquid measuring cup). I also add garlic salt, pepper, and salt. Then I add the sauce to the top as well and poke holes in it so the sauce can drain into the loaf.

Everyone I've made it for, loves it. And my husband hated meatloaf before I made this one.

This is a very easy, very tasty meatloaf. I made it according to the recipe except omitted the egg as I didn't have any on hand. The family enjoyed the barbecue flavor of the glaze. I will make it again.

Good, but I think I'll follow the various suggestions provided by others, specifically adding the Worcestershire sauce to the meat.  I also doubled the topping sauce only by doubling the ketchup.  Great recipe regardless! Thanks for sharing. :-)

I was looking for a simple, straightforward meatloaf recipe. I have made meatloaf in YEARS! Well, it wasn't really a loaf at all, more like crumbly cooked beef. We ate it drowned in ketchup, and the rest went into the garbage as I couldn't think of how to salvage the leftovers.

The only thing I would change is more garlic, and replace the sugar with honey. Cause who needs more sugar in their life, especially when eating meat.. it has natural sugars in it already, it just needs to be accented :)

I have made this dish twice so far and both times have come out fantastic! I do add some spices to it to taste but is fantastic without them. I highly recommend this to anyone

So good! I had gr beef in 1 lb packs so I made it with 2 lbs and still perfect. I used crushed cracker crumbs: half soda and half of the veggie Breton. I under salted the meat but the fabulous mixture on top made up for it. SUPER moist but not sitting in liquid like some other meatloaf. Definitely a keeper??

Wow! Yummy.
I changed brown sugar to maple syrup.
Change milk to almond milk.
I added Worcestershire sauce and a bit of garlic mix from Costco.
I'd double the topping ingredients next time as it was so good.
Saved and will definitely make again.

Fell apart way too easily even the next day after being refrigerated overnight. The flavor was exactly what I expected so I'm going to try it again and hold back on some of the milk.

Easy easy! Just like the name implies. My wife and I like this recipe, the only thing we do is cut back on the onion a little. My wife is gluten-free, so of course instead of regular bread crumbs, we use gluten-free bread.  I can't tell a difference in the taste.

I am making this again tomorrow.  Made it a couple of weeks ago and everybody loved it.  first meatloaf not used any tomatoes.  substituted heinz 57 for the catsup since I am married to a catsup hater. I also lightly browned the onions  and mushrooms in olive oil.  every thing else the same.  probably should cook a little longer than an hour; will try to add 20 minutes to the cook time.  thanks for such a great recipe.  5 stars!

I love smokey bbq flavor, so in the ketchup/mustard/brown sugar sauce I added about 2 tablespoons of Johnny Trigg original BBQ sauce.

In the meatloaf mixture I added about 3 tablespoons of parm cheese, oregano and paprika.

To avoid a mess in my oven, I placed the loaf pan on top of a baking pan.

Thank you for reading!

It's very flavorless. I even added some spices, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and put bacon on the top and it's still flavorless.

I add ground sage to all ground beef recipes and Worcestershire sauce as well  as onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms.  We think it is delicious and you can always top instead with your own bbq sauce which is also delicious.

It was good. I used ½ cup each of panko and milk in the meat mixture, and 1 tbsp each of dijon and golden brown sugar in the topping sauce. I also added about 1 tbsp of Worcestershire and two finely chopped large creminis to the meat mixture. It was moist and flavourful, and certainly easy to make.

This is my go to meatloaf recipe.  I have tried many recipes but this is by far my favorite.  I was never a fan of the ketchup topping on a meatloaf until I tried this.  I do add a tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce to the ingredients but other than that, I make this recipe exactly as written.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is almost identical to Mary's Meatloaf that I have used for several years now the only difference is she  ( Mary) uses bread pieces rather than bread crumbs. They are both very, Very good.

We love this recipe in our house.  The only change I make is using 1 pkg. of "onion soup mix" in the beef in lieu of the actual onion.  We like the flavor it gives without the over abundance of onion pieces.  

YUMMY!  Make extra sauce for the top if you like it saucy (we do).

This was a great recipe.  I changed it a little by adding  chopped green pepper  and replaced the combination of mustard, ketchup & brown sugar to barbeque sauce.  I added about 1/2 cup of barbeque sauce to the meat mixture in addition to spreading it on top before baking.   When I make it next time, I will saute the onions & pepper before adding to meat mixture. I needed to bake the meatloaf an additional 30 min. to get the internal temperature where it needed to be.   It was very good and will use this recipe again.

I didn't make the sauce for the top because I don't like my food sugary. I, personally didn't like this recipe because of the milk. I like my meatloaf harder inside, but the milk made it so moist!!!

This came out delicious! I followed the directions of previous  reviewers and sautéed the onion and added garlic. I also used Italian seasoning I used 2 1/2 pounds of meat doubled all the ingredients and also added mozzarella sticks in the meatloaf let me tell you it was a hit! My fiancé loved it. The glaze really makes the meatloaf.

When we wee dating, I told my guy I made excellent meatloaf--which was a complete fabrication. Then I went on Allrecipes and found this. We were married 2 years later. I'm just saying.....GREAT meatloaf! I did not confess for another 3 years!

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.  I then baked it in a loaf pan.  This came out way too loose and certainly didn't hold its shape as a loaf.  I didn't love the brown sugar taste and I think the milk was completely unnecessary.  I won't be making this again.

Great recipe! I used turkey meat instead of ground meat and it was super tender, moist, and flavorful.

I love this recipe! I did make a slight alteration u using 2 lbs of ground beef. I bake this in a cupcake pan to make mini meatloaf servings and my kids gobble them up! I bake at 350 for 35 mins

I'm assuming I should've followed others advice and sautéed the onions.   My family loved it, but I found the onions to be too strong & I picked them out.  Nonetheless, I covered mine with a tent aluminum foil for the entire time, it came out very moist & delicious!  Also instead I used a 1/2 cup of oatmeal & 1/2 cup of crackers.  Added teaspoon of brown sugar to the mix.   (Trying to entice my picky eater).  I will bake again!

I'm not big on ketchup so I skip the glaze and instead add garlic to taste,  and dust the outside with parm cheese. Then bake for 45 in a COVERED pan (to retain moisture) and remove the foil/cover for the final 15 minutes. Pair with a nice gravy if desired.

I followed this recipe to a tee and loved it! I made it last week for our weekly family night dinner and paired with smashed potatoes & sautéed green beans and the meatloaf was a huge hit. Now having had it, I would sauté the onions prior to adding to the meat mixture. Too early to make it again? I think not.

This was very easy to make!  I actually used 2.5lbs of meatloaf mix. Then added 1 tsp of cumin, 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of onion powder and 1/4 tsp of paprika.  Everyone including my 3 and 5 yr old loved it!

My family loved this.  I substituted the chopped onions with minced onion spice because I was too lazy to go to the store.  As well as, I substituted the bread crumbs with oatmeal.  It was great.  Next time, I would like to add cheese to the recipe.

I prefer with sauteed onions and peppers, didn't have worcestershire but that would have been great. Came out a little too wet. I'd use a bit less milk and more egg next time. For the topping, used 2tBsp each ketchup and brown sugar, and 1 tBsp dry Colemans mustard - it was thick but easily spreadable and added great flavor.

Couple things. 
1.I sub the milk w almond milk ( for those who avoid dairy or keep kosher
2. I added more ketchup and brown sugar to glaze
3. Baked at 350 covered for 1 hour then 10 min uncovered at 400.   Then it bakes better and throughly

I made this following the recipe exactly.  I really liked it a lot - it was moist and flavorful.  The only thing I would do differently next time is I would double the sauce, since more is better! ;-P

I set my oven on convection roast, instead of on bake, and I used a meatloaf pan, which helped drain off the grease.  Will definitely make this recipe often, just as it is.

I don't cook!  But this was looked so easy to make, I couldn't pass trying it out.  And the result, my husband loved it.  I made two loaves and took the 2nd loaf to a friend of mine.  She too liked it.  I will definitely make it again.
PS.  I love this site

I have a VERY picky household and my son will not eat anything on hamburger meat, no matter what dish I make. After making this recipe one time (6 months ago) it is a biweekly request. Any our son wants to make sure he gets PLENTY of the sauce! Excellent!

Made it last week and will make it again tonight.  I added mozzarella to the center because everything tastes better with melted mozzarella.  In a house where no one likes to eat anything twice in the same month this was easy to make, delicious to eat and a breeze to clean up afterwards.

I made this exactly as written and I didn't like it very much. My boyfriend thought it was good. I had to put it back in the oven because after one hour, it was still very undercooked. Even after cooking all the way, this isn't the recipe to suit my tastes. I will be trying something else!

The recipe was great! I have made it twice. The first time I didn't follow directions and mixed the ketchup, mustard and brown sugar right into the beef mixture. It turned out very moist and flavorful. The second time I followed directions and it was just as good. I do recommend cooking it another 10-15 minutes. Both times the loaf came out pink in the middle.

This was a great base recipe. I added some carrots to replace the brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, a dash or two of Italian seasoning, one hot Italian sausage, and used half ground turkey and beef. I mixed the ketchup and mustard in the meatloaf instead of on top; it was great. After all that is was not spicy, just full of flavor. Wow this will be a great sandwich tomorrow!

Great recipe! I really never have cared for meatloaf but with a lot of kids you have to make cheap and quick meals that are usually not so good. This is the only meatloaf I will ever make!! Everyone loves it and have made it several times.

There was very little flavor. We cooked as directed and it was still raw in the center.

It was delicious.  I made a few adjustments to the recipes.  My daughter complained that most meat loaf is dry so I decided to use 1/2 cup of bread crumbs instead of 1 cup.  Then, I added Lipton Onion soup mix.  I also used sweet mustard.  My daughter was so surprised.

Very easy and tasty. I used sirloin and minced onions since I had no fresh onions. My only change next time will be to add some carrots to get some veggies in my kid!  Definitely adding to my dinner rotation.

Too much mustard in the topping. The texture was strange, likely caused by too much breadcrumbs and milk, would reduce these quantities.

Best meatloaf I've ever made:) I have made this a few times and this was the best! I usually don't write comments.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce (a read in a comment) and maybe 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt and minced garlic...nothing serious. I'm sure it would of taste good without the extra stuff.

Easy and delicious! I cut the recipe in half because I only had 3/4 lb of ground beef. I did make the same amount of sauce for the top since so many people recommended doubling it - I would do that too!

Really easy and very good. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about adding mustard to the ketchup/brown sugar topping - but it was surprisingly tasty. I used Panko bread crumbs, as they were all I had on hand. I also added some seasonings - to taste- to the meat mixture: basil, parsley & garlic powder.

My family loves this recipe. We always use a meatloaf mix rather than just ground beef and I replace the onion with one pack of dried onion soup mix. The taste the soup mix adds is phenomenal! Thanks!

This recipe turned out great except a little too moist.  I suspect that's because it calls for a whole onion.  Also I had a little over 1 pound of meat and not 1 1/2.  Lesson learned and we get paid in a few days I'd like to give it a second shot with at least 1 1/2 pounds hamburger and only 1/2 of an onion.

Good, easy meatloaf recipe. I also made some adjustments to suit my family's tastes.  I omitted the onion and added a tsp of Italian seasoning and a tsp of garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste. Only used 1 lb of hamburger, 3/4 cup of bread crumbs, 3/4 cup of milk. And for the glaze, I only used ketchup.

This meatloaf was very tasty and moist. I mistakenly added the ketchup, mustard and brown sugar to meat mixture...still put topping on but used less mustard and brown sugar. My family went back for seconds! I may saute onions next time. I used Italian breadcrumbs and added tbs of Worcestershire. Will add to my recipe collection!

Made this last night for myself and 6 houseguests. It was truly the best meatloaf I've ever had; super easy to throw together, everyone loved it. 
Here are my changes:
Add 2 1/2 tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce and a cup of shredded cheese to the ground beef. When you put it in the oven to bake, set the meatloaf pan in another pan (preferably a glass Pyrex) with a little water in the bottom to keep it moist while it cooks. After it cooks for the full hour, drain the oil from the pan as much as possible and broil for 2-3 minutes to get the sauce to stay firmly on top and add a little firmness to the loaf. Delicious!

This was my first time making meatloaf. I expected a bit more flavor from this. I used Italian bread crumbs, added green pepper & Worcestershire. I followed the recipe as written other than those changes. I think it needs less breadcrumbs, more topping, and more of a meaty flavor. This baked on a foil lined baking sheet with a wire rack for grease drainage. It wasn't done after an hour of baking. It took about an hr and 45 min. The last 15 min, I jacked the temp to 400 to bake more of the topping on. My boyfriend said this was good & tasted like Mom's. I would make this again for him. Just ok for me.

I love this!
I am a big Rotel fan.
Add a can to put some spice in the recipe.
The mix is a little juicer but cooks up great.
Add some Worcestershire sauce to the topping mix.
Turned out yummy!

My kids would never eat my meatloaf until I made this recipe. The only change I made was to use onion powder instead of the chopped onion. The meatloaf was moist, delicious and flavorful and was completely gobbled up.

This recipe is great!  I typically add green pepper, garlic, pepperoni and Worcestershire sauce for added flavor.

I added 1 egg for a total of 2 eggs. Added 1/4 cup of milk for a total of 1- 1/4 cup. Also only had 3/4 Cup of bread crumbs so added 1/4 Cup crackers to equal 1 cup.

This is absolutely an easy recipe and comes out right all the time. It is moist and delicious. My family loves this so  I double the recipe, because I have a big family and they always want seconds. Not to mention the kids loves the ketchup and mustard mixture on top.

I don't make meatloaf too often, so I followed the recipe, and yes, it was easy, but it also had no taste, in my opinion.  Maybe it will taste better tomorrow after it sits in the fridge (I do like to make meatloaf sandwiches the day after).  Next time, I'll just wing it and see it "meatloaf magic" happens...

Really good recipe!  Sauteed onions 1st, double topping.  Variations are endless.  I tried with pesto and tomato past on top-yum.  Used Dijon mustard another time, don't need ketchup on top if using tomato sauce in loaf.  Really takes only  1 hr for 1.2 lbs ground beef in 8x8x2 pan.  If you add >1 cup liquid or sauce to this, must increase breadcrumbs too, or will not set up.  1 cup stale seed crackers in it was so good!

Great finished product! Perfect, loafy meat loaf, not crumbly or too mushy. The flavor was marvelous!  I added a little kick to the finish by putting Sriracha in with the final coating of ketchup, and I substituted bread crumbs for the oat meal (because it's what I had in the kitchen!)... Next try I added some Lipton onion soup mix, and it knocked it out of the park. Wonderful recipe!!

This is a great recipe!  Basic but very good.  Like many, I sautéed the onions and also added a garlic clove.  I also doubled the sauce (we like the topping to be noticeable).  The texture was great (firm but not *too* firm) and the leftovers were just as good.

Note - If you don't like sauce on top of your meatloaf either skip the topping or go for another recipe.  IMO though, the sauce is very tasty!

This was really good meatloaf and my whole family enjoyed it!
The only changes I made were, I used half the brown sugar and I used crushed salad croutons (garlic & asiago cheese) instead of the regular bread crumbs. The best meatloaf I have ever made, however; it could use a little something, not sure exactly what. Maybe next time I will add some garlic or red peppers for a little extra umph.

We loved this recipe!  Lots of flavor and taste; I'm definitely going to make this again!  I followed the recipe 100%, the only think I would change is to have it in the oven longer.  I pulled it out after an hour and it wasn't nearly done.  I bumped up the temperature and had it in an additional 20-30 minutes.  Tasted great with some mashed potatoes!

Instead of all beef, used 1/2 lb. each of beef, sausage, and veal. My other change was to use Italian seasoned dry bread crumbs to take the flavor explosion up a notch or two.

I used Saltines for the crumbs, and I used 1lb beef and 1/2lb turkey for the meat portion. Added the Worchestershire Sauce as suggested by Skygirl. For the topping I didn't really use the right amounts of the ingredients but it worked out fine. Really enjoyed it. I think it was one of the best meat loaves I made.

This was easy and excellent.  I didn't have enough milk, so I mixed in ketchup for the remaining amount of milk I was missing.  It was about 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup ketchup mixed in with the meat.  It tasted great and was a hit with my husband and 3 kids.

Have made this dish several times now and my family loves it! We aren't onion lovers, so I add a dash of onion salt in place of the real thing. I also cut back to 1/4 cup of ketsup, and mix all ingredients into the loaf prior to cooking (so no topping). Makes it a bit less sweet and more meaty.

I made a few changes. I used red wine instead of milk, tossed in a couple of dashes of Worcestershire, a dash of Tabasco sauce and a small amount of garlic.

These changes are for my personal preferences and might not be liked by others.

This is a very similar recipe that I have made for years.  The only difference is that I simmer and reduce the sauce and put in on the meatloaf for the last 20 minutes of baking time.   I do that after draining any fats/oils out of the meatloaf pan.

This is a very simple, basic and delicious meatloaf recipe - just the way I like it! I didn't modify anything other than adding a packet of lipton soup onion mix and a tsp of worcestershire sauce. It was absolutely delicious! My mother-in-law raved about it and said she was going to make it herself at her home soon so that's gotta be a good sign :) Very tasty. Will make again and again. I did reserve a little of the sauce until after the meatloaf was done. Sauce is tasty I ran out and wished I had a little more to put on top of the meatloaf when it was on the plate but was still wonderful :)

This is a good meatloaf recipe! I always bake my meatloaf on a cookie sheet, instead of in a loaf pan. It's so much better that way! It's very moist...the only thing I wasn't a big fan of was the sweet 'n sour sauce on top. I prefer the ketchup on top, or marinara sauce (especially if you use Italian bread crumbs instead of the plain). But I will make it again...minus the sweet sauce on top.

My husband likes things a little spicy so I added some chopped jalapeños and added a few drops of hot sauce to the sauce topping (just to his side). He had two servings so I am guessing he liked it. :)

I omit the sugar (there's enough in the ketchup for us) - but this has become the only meatloaf recipe I use. My family actually looks forward to meatloaf night. Thank you!

This is a good basic meatloaf. I shredded my onion with a cheese grater, and added 2 cloves of garlic. I Normally prefer a bbq or tomato /basil sauce over my meatloaf, but this was a nice change... Kind of reminded me of a burger. I replaced prepared yellow mustard with dijon.

Made this for my family, my mother and son both had second helpings.
But since I didn't have the tomato juice, I happened to have the Motts Clamato original.  It was nice and moist also.
I'd certainly make it again, and kept it as a favourite.

My mom  made a meatloaf just like this once when she didn't have the usual tomato sauce. It was one of her best meatloafs. Dad and I loved it, but the little bros didn't. She never made it again, unfortunately, but  I'm so happy to see there's a recipe for this. Now I can cook it for my family.

This is a family favorite.  I double the recipe and make two loaves so we can have leftovers.  I add celery and 2tbs of Worcestershire sauce.  No need to sauté the veggies.  Very yummy!!

Quick,easy and hearty! I've never been a huge meatloaf fan but my son had been requesting it so I tried this recpie and was surprisingly impressed! The only thing I changed was using milk soaked bread Instead of breadcrumbs because I was out. I can understand how some folks might not be Into the brown sugar sauce but it cooked up savory and slightly sweet. The family and I loved it.

I am gluten and dairy free. I used plain rice cakes in place of the bread crumbs and water instead of the milk. It still turned out great and my kids love it!!

This was an easy recipe and totally delish.  My family finally didn't complain about me serving meatloaf.  I did follow some of the suggestions of others.  I sauted the onions in a little butter and then added a clove of minced garlic at the end.  I also added a tablespoon of worchestershire sauce.  Finally, instead of bread crumbs I used a cup of cubed up bread I had left over from Thanksgiving.  I soaked it in the milk before adding the other ingredients.  Absolutely yummy and very easy to make.

This is my second time in making this I love it. The only difference I added my green peppers because my mom when she made her meat loaf that is what she add an I like the aroma of smelling green peppers. My mother is'nt with us but her memory lives on.

I put some habenero and liquid smoke in the meat, used purple onion and sautéed it with garlic before adding to the meat, and also added some paprika, chili powder, pepper, and cayenne. I also added Worcestershire to the sauce. It was spicy and so flavorful!  Best meatloaf I've ever had.

My family loves this recipe and it is so easy to make! Definitely either cut way back on the onions or saute them first.  And add lot of Worcestershire sauce.  The best one I ever had was when I made it up and let it sit in the fridge for several hours before cooking.

Simple and easy. I have made it three times and it's a hit. Definitely make the suggested changes with pre-cook of onions in butter (I use the light butter) add Worcestershire sauce and double the sauce recipe for topping. I use the 96% lean hamburger every time and it still turns out juicy.

The sauce makes this recipe. I was skeptical but it is indeed delicious! I did add some worcestershire sauce to the meat, and followed other reviewers' suggestion to saute the onions first. I also add a little me cooking time to make the outside extra crispy.

Well as stated its a pretty simple recipe yet very tasty and the glaze was a hit too!  I did add some garlic powder, cumin, green peppers and adobo seasonings to my taste. That just made it more flavorful.  It may show up again at thanksgiving. Thanks Janet for sharing.

LOVE this recipe. It is my "go to" meatloaf basic. We have this for dinner at least once every month it seems.
I add a finely diced green pepper, a splash of Worcester sauce, and either seasoned breadcrumbs or a large dash of Italian seasoning (or both when I'm feeling frisky.) Then to finish it off I just slather it in whatever BBQ sauce I have around. I love BBQ and meatloaf.

So easy, juicy & delicious.  My husband & I don't like mustard, so instead I top it off with a mixture of ketchup, brown sugar & Worcestershire sauce.  I've made it with ground beef as well as ground turkey & both equally delicious.

Made it loved it! I still make it because it is so easy it's been a couple of years since found this recipe where I just remember it by heart. I've also learned to add my own seasonings for added flavor. I also add diced green peppers and onions in my meat.Yum

Great recipe, very simple and easy to incorporate other ingredients... definitely making again!  I added a little Worcestershire sauce, fresh minced garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, seasoned salt and shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the meat mixture and it turned out awesome!

So easy and was wonderful! The texture was right and so moist! The only thing I would do differently is add some minced garlic and some bell peppers. Other than that, I recommend this to everyone!

Like the surgeon that told a man's family " Everything was fine until he fell off the table". Oooppps. When I got to "Add all ingridients" I did. When I read further, there it was...I needed to keep the ingredients for the glaze topping seperate. I didn't tell anyone...and it turned out good.

I made this for my husband and I, it was awesome! So easy to make and we both loved it! Definitely will make again :) 
I didn't made the topping sauce, just put ketchup and mustard, still great!
Also, did what everyone else said and browned the onions and add little garlic in butter and worcestershire sauce, yum!

An unusual meatloaf.  We liked the sauce but the meatloaf itself is a little bit bland.  I took other reviewers' advice and sautéed the onions with garlic and a sweet pepper in olive oil.  I used Italian bread crumbs.  It is very important to let the meatloaf rest for at least 20 minutes or so after you take it out of the oven.  It firms up and the flavor does improve.  I have a feeling it will be good on sandwiches tomorrow.  Thank you for the recipe.

I enjoyed this meatloaf. It was a bit moist for me as I prefer a bit dryer loaf, but the taste was great. I really enjoyed the glaze which surprised me but it went well over-top.

I did not like it. It was much too watery and soft. It seemed soggy to me.  Maybe the milk or the ground beef?

Very tasty with some tweaks, I only used 1/4 cup each milk and bread crumbs, added some minced garlic, Worschestire sauce and Montreal steak spice, omitted the salt. I halved the topping and only used half of the sugar amount. Held together nicely and sliced well, was very juicy.

I made this and once again my picky family likes it. I did make a few changes. I added some garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce. I also doubled the sauce recipe and cooked what wasn't put on top of the meat loaf. My family isn't crazy about mustard so i added a bit more ketchup but the mustard adds a zing. instead of using bread crumbs i used crumbled up ritz crackers. needless to say this was a winner in my household.

I've  tried other meatloaf recipes and none of them have come out as good as this one.  as other reviewer's have said it is a bit sweet however I  used spicy mustard and that gave it a tangy flavor .  Next time I will add woshestire sauce to the meat and use less sugar. But I have to say it was easy to make! Mt husband really liked it and no meatloaf can compare to his mom's. Lol!  Even my picky 3 year old eater ate it with no hesitation..

Best meatloaf I've ever made!  Also sautéed the onions as others did. I didn't have yellow mustard so I had to use wasabi mustard and it was great!  I've shared this recipe a lot!

I used to do a really hard recipe for Meatloaf, until I found this one. Now I just add the seasonings from the hard recipe to this one. It is the only way I make Meatloaf. I did use honey instead of brown sugar on top. I also add a layer of bay leaves on the bottom.

My husband is not a big fan of meatloaf but he loved this recipe. I did make a few little changes. I used minced onion and added minced garlic.  I used Italian bread crumbs but only about 3/4 cup and added cheddar cheese during the last 5 minutes.

Made it to recipe.  Nice texture, but was VERY bland.  No flavor at all.  Temp and time of cook were enough for the meat, but onion was still raw.  Next time I'll tweek by omitting onion, and adding onion soup mix or A1 or worcestershire, to flavor it up a bit.

I combined this recipe with A Firefighter's Meatloaf. My husband likes ketchup as the topping and I prefer barbeque sauce. So combining the two recipes made it perfect. I'll be making it again soon!

I thought it was the worst meatloaf I ever tried. topping was too sweet. Too much bread crumbs...couldn't even taste the meat. Had to cook well over an hour and turn the heat up.

I'm a guy and not a cook.   It tasted excellent.  I did use some Worcestershire, and sauteed a red onion and two garlic cloves.  It was not too sweet at all with the brown sugar.  Next time I will bake some additional topping to use as a dip or for spreading over the meat.   Thanks for all the suggestions.

Easiest Meat Loaf ever! I am a novice, so this is perfect for me! We have a family of 3...2 adults and 1 toddler. My husband said it was the best meat loaf he has ever had! And my toddler at ALL of his helping! The only alterations I made was I actually added 1 helping of the ketchup,mustard, and brown sugar mix to my meat and mixed it into the loaf..then made another mix of it and put that one on top of the loaf. Turned out perfect! I also did not put a whole onion in, we used 1/2 of an onion and it was just enough. :) Highly recommend!

I've made this recipe many times and never once have I received any complaints. It's definitely a recipe I will use for the rest of my life. The only adjustment I've made is, I substitute the bread crumbs with crushed crackers.

Absolutely delicious! This is the first meatloaf that i have ever had, so i can't compare it to any other, but me and my husband loved it very much. Like others said, i sauted the onion with garlic, added about 2 tbs of worcestershire sauce, and a little bit of nutmeg. Will definitly make this again!

I left the mustard out just because I didn't have it.  My family loved it and asked that it go in our regular rotation.  I took the other recommendations and sauteed onions in butter and added worcestershire sauce.

This is a great recipe. My husband and even picky kids destroy this at dinner. There are usually no leftovers. The only things I altered were to brown the onions a bit before adding to the meat, and doubling the glaze. I reduced the mustard by about half. Also, Italian bread crumbs add more flavor than plain so I use those. Some have commented that the glaze is too sweet. It IS sweet, but I think the tangy sweet glaze is exactly why the kids and husband love it so. This has become my stand by meatloaf recipe. Easy, simple, delicious.

I added about a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and sauteed the onions in a little butter and garlic just for a few minutes until the onions were softened. 
My family loves it! Delicious and easy to make.

Five stars for the basic meatloaf recipe, so easy, moist and tasty. Made our own sauce with a 50/50 blend of A1 and ketchup. It was such a big hit with my family! Served with baked potatoes and a side of "Normandy blend" veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots) tossed with a little bit of Dijon mustard and steamed. Next time I will make extra sauce for serving.

Amazing.  Best meatloaf ever.  The ketchup sauce mixture really made it pop!  I did everything as per the instructions the only thing I changed was I also added one tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.  I also made another batch of the ketchup sauce to spread over the meatloaf on my plate as necessary.

The milk made it soggy and the brown sugar on top was too sweet.  It fell apart and you could not do nice slices.

Followed other reviewers changes:  Sauteed onions in butter and clove of garlic to soften.  Added 2 tbsp of ketchup and 1 tbsp of A1 (because I didn't have Worsc sauce) to the meat mix. I also used garlic breadcrumbs because I didn't have Italian (which was suggested by many).  And in the sauce recipe I reduced the mustard by 1/2 and added the difference in extra ketchup.  Baked about 15 min longer.  Was the best meatloaf we've ever had!  I think the sweet/tangy sauce really added to the dish.  Baked in perfectly!

We did not like the topping, so I cut out the brown sugar and mustard and instead added the ketchup right into the meat mixture. It adds a good flavor and keeps the loaf moist.  Also, I use Italian seasoned bread crumbs for extra flavor.

I made this exactly as the recipe states.  Everyone in our house liked the meatloaf (including our 3 young children).  I really love the ketchup/mustard/brown sugar mix for the top, but I thought the actual meatloaf itself was a little bland.  I will try a little worcestershire sauce and saute the onion beforehand next time.  Still, this meatloaf wasn't too dry but also didn't fall apart which seems to be the biggest problem I've had when making meatloaf in the past.

Delicious!!!  I left out 1/2 lb. of the beef because I only had 1 lb., and left out the brown sugar because I forgot.  I goofed up and put the mustard and ketchup into the beef mix, so I put additional ketchup and mustard on top.  I used evaporated milk, only 1/2 c because I didn't have any fresh milk.  I also added some Miami Spice meat loaf seasoning, about 1 Tbsp, 1 t freshly ground Celtic sea salt and 1/2 t freshly ground pepper.  It turned out super moist and tasty!

I followed the recipe except I added dehydrated onion that I had on hand. Used 1 lb of ground beef extra lean.  I used less sugar and mustard for the topping since I was using one pound beef  Used a hamburger bun which had sesame onion and poppy seeds on the top for the bread portion.  Added a few shakes of Lowrys garlic salt. No other changes were made to the recipe. My husband said "This is the best loaf you've made. No need to buy those packet of meatloaf mix any more". I baked it on a cookie sheet using non stick foil for easy clean up. Baked in confection oven per recipe at 350 for on hour. This will make wonderful leftover sandwiches. Thr topping topped it off.

Meatloaf is basic and fine. The topping was down right odd. Too sweet. That is why the 3 stars.  Didn't need the sugar. I think I omitted it the last time I made it and I should omit going forward. I also put a can of tomato paste this time in lieu of milk which made it non dairy and helped out the flavor a bit. My kid that likes bland food ate it right up.

I have made this recipe for a few years now. My (now) 5 year old daughter and I love it! I did follow some advice from the reviewers and tweaked it a little. 1) I sauteed the onions, 2) Add Worcestershire sauce to the meat and the topping mix, 3) Use seasoned bread crumbs, and used a little less, and 4) I also doubled up on the ketchup. Definitely one of my favorite recipes!

This is the BEST!
I sauteed the onion until almost tender in a little olive oil before adding to the meat mixture because of dietary preferences and plus I  mixed the milk and egg and salt and pepper together before adding in as well. My son and husband travel a lot and "LOVE" meatloaf. I was tired of not getting the best reviews for mine.  Now they never order meatloaf anywhere but home! Thanks so much!

GREAT! I 've never liked meatloaf, but I like this one. The topping/sauce makes it. Make extra to serve on the side. (I cut the mustard in half)
I sauteed onions, peppers, and garlic in butter before adding to meat mixture.  And added Worcestershire sauce to meat. Simple  and sooooo good. Don't let the few ingredients fool ya'.  Worth a try!! It does take about 1 hr 30 mins to cook. (Put sliced bread under meat loaf to soak up extra grease)

This is delicious and easy! I am that person that adds random things. I used ground turkey, squirted BBQ sauce in to meat mixture, used soy milk, sprinkled a LITTLE brown sugar on top, did a squiggle of mustard and ketchup on top, and added chopped green pepper. Delish!!

I've used this recipe three times now. It. Is. Awesome. Simple and tasty. The only thing I changed the first and third time is using the seasoning "chopped onion" instead of a fresh cut onion. I can't take the tears haha. I will definitely be using this recipe in my kitchen A LOT.

This is excellent!  I followed the advice and doubled the sauce.  This is a great meal to put together (sauce and all) and freeze before cooking.  I have given this frozen meal to several of my friends right after they had a baby and they ALL raved about it.  Works great with ground turkey as well.

I feel like it was missing something, but I really like how it came out. I broke it into 5 small loaf pans (which was a little tricky but it worked out). I froze 4 and they've all tasted great. Just like the one I didn't freeze. Really good since I'm a college student and trying to make meals stretch!

My kids despise onions, so I just added a couple dashes of onion powder rather than an onion. Everyone who "hates" meatloaf at my table asked for seconds.

I substituted the ground beef for dirt and the rest of the ingredients for stick and twigs and this recipe was barely edible.  Will not be trying again.

Just kidding, this is a great recipe.  I just can stand how people rate the recipe based on their substitutions.  In all seriousness, this meal made it into my regular rotation.

For my first time making meatloaf, I chose this recipe! The turn out was by far amazing and left my taste buds hollering for more! The only change that I made to this dish was, sauté onions and minced garlic together in salt-free butter, over a medium heat. Very tasty and most defiantly will make this dish again!!

The only change I did was add a little bit of Sriracha sauce to the ketchup mixture. I doubled the recipe and froze the second meatloaf. Super easy to put together and pretty yummy! Family ate it all with no leftovers! :)

I love this recipe and have made it many times. My whole family loves it. We love the sweet and tangy sauce on top. I usually make extra and heat it up if anyone wants extra on their piece. Pair this with mashed potatoes and it's perfection.

Easy to make. I know that some may find it bland but for those of us with medical issues like Crohn's - this was perfect! It would be very easy for others to add more spice. Great recipe.

I have used this recipe so often, I have it down to memory.  My family loves this meat loaf and so do I.  It is very simple and easy.  You can also enhance it by adding Lipton onion onion flavored soup that comes in a box.  Gives the meatloaf extra flavor.

Made this with venison meat and it was phenomenal!  I don't know why I've been slaving over meatloaf for over 30 years.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thank you so much for sharing.

I usually add a few more herbs, like garlic, to the meat before cooking, otherwise I love this recipe. I make it in single serving loaf pans and freeze them to eat over a couple of weeks.

Great basic recipe.  I added my own embellishments, just wanted a basic to start from & this was perfect.   (Use this recipe then add ingredients your family likes before cooking.  i.e.... green peppers, tomatoes, cheese, garlic.... it's fun to play with different additions.)

This is a good meatloaf recipe if your in the mood for a basic meatloaf. After reading the reviews used about 1/2 the milk and it was just the right texture for us, held together nicely.

Very easy to make and I'm by  far a cook in the kitchen. First it was too soggy so I added more bread crumbs so it will stick.  Next time I'll add tomatoes sauce to put on top.

I did add some cheese to the mix but other than that - no changes - GREAT meatloaf. Easy and kid-friendly in a family of pretty picky eaters.

My son and I cooked this tonight. We loved it.  So simple to make.  We used venison instead of beef and corn flake crumbs because we didn't have bread crumbs.  We doubled the ketchup and sauteed the onions.  Even my wife loved it.

It's the first thing when you google meatloaf for a reason and all you need to know is your kids will love this. Winner, as moms we all know how difficult it can be with kids. The sauce isnt really sweet to me, I don't pack the brown sugar. Also, ny husband actually loves it, so much. He asks for it every week! It's good when you brown and add extra veggies as well and an easy way to hide them from my LO's. Picky eaters! Don't need any extra sauce at all..it's perfectly fine the way it is. Great basic meatloaf

We really enjoyed this meatloaf. However, I only had 1# of hamburger so I added one large link of sweet Italian Johnsonville sausage. I decreased the milk and breadcrumbs by 1/4 cup. I don't like meatloaf but this recipe made me re-think my meatloaf opinion.

I liked how this recipe did what it said. It was easy. I liked the easy measurements and portions. You could almost memorize the recipe. Great beginner meatloaf.  Oh, I did need to cook it 15 minutes longer. I thought it was too pink in the middle. (I used the loaf pan)

Yum! Just ate a serving of this fresh out of the oven. Nice crispy outside and spongy inside. Substitutions: ground turkey not ground beef, water not milk, rolled oats not bread crumbs, and I added 1/4 cup of "Italian mix" herbs. I doubled the recipe except for the brown sugar and I baked it at 375 F for 90 minutes. It filled a 9x13" pan with room to spare.

My husband loved it, so the amount of brown sugar was fine with us...as he is quite opioniated if things are too sweet. 
I doubled the recipe using two lbs. ground beef & 1 lb. pork. I cut down on the milk to 1.5 cups, as I wax mixing the meat for fear it  would get too loose. Following other suggestions, I sautéed onions and chopped garlic cloves (also added chopped up mushrooms) in butter before adding to meat mixture. I forgot to add worcestershire to meat, so I added it to sauce (along with the leftover onions & mushrooms because I made too much of that)...amazing!!! Thank you for submitting the recipe!

Awesome!!!  My tweaks:  2 pounds of beef, 2 eggs, plus added 5 ounces of shredded Parmesan cheese. I used unseasoned Panko bread crumbs. I doubled the sauce and added A1. 1/2 sauce cooked on top of the meat loaf, and other half served on the side. Cooked in a disposable pan for 1 hour at 350 degrees in a convection oven. My husband said its better than his meatloaf!!!

I literally just finished making this and eating it for dinner. I'm the first one to say I'm not the most skilled cook in our family. But this simple recipe made me appear to be a culinary genius!! Even the best cook in our home was not only impressed but am even bigger compliment had seconds! My only regret is not taking a picture!! I did follow the review suggestions in terms of adding the worcheschire sauce as well as to sauté the onion with garlic. I used 2lbs of lean ground beef and cooked it for 20 min longer than suggested. Definitely one of my favorite recipes so far!!!!

Great, easy & quick recipe. I took the advice of the other reviewers and added sautéed onions. I used barbecue sauce because I didn't have enough ketchup. Turn out great.

Pretty good recipe! I substitute the ketchup for sweet baby rays BBQ sauce, since I didn't have ketchup. I added progresso Italian style bread crumbs & honey mustard. I doubled the BBQ sauce & added 1 tbsp Worcester sauce like one of the reviews had done.

The meatloaf I make is very similar to this one, the only difference being I use a tsp. of dried sage to the mixture.  The difference in flavor is subtle but very good .. IMHO.

Made as recipe states.  Found it rather blah and almost mushy, even after letting it rest after cooking.  The sauce on top just tasted like ketchup to me.  I personally like the Brown Sugar Meatloaf recipe on this site better.

They say to never try out a recipe for the first time on company.  Well, I did.. and it was a WOW!!!  Everybody loved this meatloaf; I did too. :-)  I doubled the recipe because of the number of people.  I served it with roasted potatoes and ginger-honey green beans from a previous site and Texas dinner rolls.  This will be my go-to recipe for meatloaf; the name fits..Easy Meatloaf..Fantastic!!  Thanks for sharing  :-)

I made it exactly how the recipe said and it was great. I didn't read any of the reviews until after I had already started and was worried how it would turn out since many of the reviewers had changed a thing or two but my dad LOVED it. I don't know that I loved it, but I definitely liked it and would probably make it again. Super easy.

It was fantastic!!!!! I added Worcestershire sauce (a good 3-4 glugs) and used  Japanese Panco instead of the dried bread crumbs.
Next time, I am going to add some Parsley (which I baught for the dish but forgot to use!) Ian, Ladybrand ZA

I made the recipe as directed except I only had 1 lb. of beef, so I lowered the amount of milk slightly.  It came out great.  I used a finely diced red onion and didn't think it needed to be sautéed ahead as some reviewers advise.  The sauce amount was perfect, but maybe because I only used 1lb. of beef.  I only had plain bread crumbs (a mix of panko and regular), so I added 1Tbs. of unsalted Italian spice mix.  I might try the Worcestershire sauce next time.  Yummy comfort food - thanks!

Very moist but you must follow the recipe additions from other reviews. Sauté the onions and double if not triple the ketchup mixture. I like the mustard taste so I will keep that ratio the same. If you are not a big fan of that taste, then reduce the mustard ratio. Worcehestier will help with the lack of seasoning in the mix along with seasoned breadcrumbs. I would also recommend making it on a baking sheet as a loaf instead of in a loaf pan like I did. The ketchup mixture is delicious but only stays on the top in a loaf pan, baking in a sheet will allow the mixture to cover the top and sides, making it delicious!

Meatloaf is not a typical dish in my country. I tried the recipe and it was moist and flavour packed. Meatloaf will not turn into my favorite meal, and my husband actually dislotes the texture, but the recipe was helpful and turned out pretty well. Actually I have prepared it 2 or 3 times (until hubby let me know he didnt enjoy meatloaf's texture)

My husband loved this recipe! It's very simple, and it tastes delicious. Many people said the sauce was too sweet, but I added about a tablespoon of Worcester sauce to counterbalance the brown sugar.

I've been married for 12 years now and have never made meatloaf before.  Actually, I don't even remember having it very often when I grew up.  Can't even remember why I decided I was going to try it.  This recipe looked really easy and yet had great reviews so figured I'd give it a try.  Wow.  Love the flavor.  I did add the changes that almost everyone says: used Italian breadcrumbs,  1 TBS worcestershire sauce and a bit of garlic powder for flavor (we don't do onions in this house so too lazy to chop some garlic and saute them on their own).  I doubled the ketchup and brown sugar but left the mustard to 2 TBS.  I really enjoyed the simple ingredients yet really good flavor of the meat and sauce.  Will definitely be making it again!

I've made this several times now. I do add extra onion, double the sauce, and add garlic and Worcestershire to the filling (though I forgot the garlic and Worcestershire last time and it was still okay). I used a meatloaf mix of ground beef, veal and pork (filling in some extra ground beef to make the 1.5 pounds). It was great!!!!

This is a really good recipe and essentially how my family has always made meatloaf.  I know a lot of older folk that also use dry oats if you don't have the bread crumbs or crackers.  The only thing I did differently was add some bell pepper.  I sweated those and the onions in a little butter till soft and then added to the mixture.  I personally don't like to use very lean ground beef because I like the flavor and juices the extra fat gives.  Some reading may also like that or just use it for economic reasons.  I only say this because if you do, like me, you may want to adjust the amount of milk.  Overall, a great go-to recipe and really easy to remember.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe - very simple to make and simple tasting, but very good.  I sautéed onions and added 1 clove of garlic.  Also as others suggested I added seasoned bread crumbs and 1 TBS Worcestershire.  Came out moist and the ketchup and brown sugar mixture on top adds a nice sweetness to it.

I added extra bread crumbs because after a cup of milk it was too soupy. I also omitted the brown sugar mixture and only put a small can of tomato paste on top. Needed a little bit more than an hour to completely cook the middle. I would make it again.

I only had one pound hamburger thawed, so it was a bit crumbly, but good. I also subbed Ritz cracker crumbs for breadcrumbs. Will make again!

Easy! Confidence building for newbies at cooking! I included 1 T. of worchestershire sauce, seasoned breadcrumbs, and used jalapeno ketchup on one-half of it because my husband likes spice.

The most wonderful thing about meatloaf is its adaptability. This recipe is a great starting point for your own creativity. 

I've made this with finely minced raw onions and I've made it with sweated onions and garlic. I like them both. I add Herbes de Provence and dijon mustard to the meatloaf mix and the sauce. As for breadcrumbs, I use toasted bread. I'm not a big fan of brown sugar for this dish and I like heat, so I added balsamic vinegar, Worcestershire and cayenne pepper to the ketchup and mustard.

Let it rest for 15 minutes before serving and it's simply the best reheated or used cold in a sandwich the next day. (If it lasts that long ... lol)

It was ok only because I neglected to read reviews prior to making it.  Next time I will use seasoned bread crumbs.  Used egg replacer (due to egg allergy) and it came out yummy.

I make it without onions since I can't eat them. My husband and the 3 year old both like this meatloaf. This recipe can be low FODMAP with the right ketchup (no HFCS, etc).

I found my holy grail meatloaf recipe and who would have guessed it would be such a simple one? Exceeded my expectations!! I wanted to make two loaves so I doubled everything using 1 lb ground beef, 1 lb ground veal and seasoned bread crumbs. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. After one hour the loaves were still too pink in the middle so I added about 20 minutes.  This was the most moist meatloaf I've ever had! I did not miss any of the extra ingredients I've used in the past. It was simple in a good way and very flavorful.  I thought the sauce was just perfect and not too sweet.  I was aware some of the reviewers complained about the sweetness so I tasted it a few times while mixing it to make sure I liked it.

I like to use three quarters very lean beef (93/7 if I can get it) and substitute one quarter ground turkey. I love followed many reviewers advice and sautéed the onions first, used seasoned breadcrumbs, and  added Worcestershire sauce to the meat.  The glaze in this recipe is just a bit sweet for my taste, but overall it's still quite delicious. I will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe because it was quick and easy to make, inexpensive and so yummy. With so few ingredients I expected it might be a bit bland but it's the best meatloaf I've had and my fiance requests it often. I've also tried using half hamburger and half ground Turkey, which was less greasy but just as tasty.

I added oatmeal. Whatever amount of meat I'm using, I add half that amount in oatmeal. Meat is expensive these days, so I've gotta stretch it as best I can!  I have a house full of carnivores and they have no idea how much oatmeal I'm adding in. And it's healthy to boot!

I made this recipe and it turned out really well. The first time I made one loaf. Now I make 2 loaves so I can reeze one for another time. I used extra lean hamburger meat. Charlie and Bea, Montreal, Que Canada

Good outcomes given how easy the recipe was. We cut down on the sugar a little bit, as others recommended.

I took the advise of other reviewers and sautéed the onions in a bit of butter along with some garlic. Also, I shredded a very big carrot (next time I think I will also add a shredded zucchini) and sautéed it with the onions/garlic (I need to disguise veggies for our 3 boys)and then added it to the mix. Furthermore, I used seasoned breadcrumbs. I mixed everything in my Kitchen Aid as I hate touching meat, plus it really does a great job combining all the flavors. My 2 pickiest eaters LOVED it. I will def be adding this to my list of regular meals.

I liked this meatloaf. I am not sure what the complaints were about especially the under cooked part. I always check it with thermometer anyway just to make sure. I however cooked in 3 separate small round tins for an hr and was perfect. I also found there was plenty of sauce. Thanks for recipe :)

I made this minus the mustard (just not a fan) and substituted ground turkey and minced I onion flakes because it was what I had on hand, and it STILL turned out great. My picky kids went for seconds. And was very simple to make. Definately putting this in rotation for those busy nights I have to throw something together quick!

I've been making this meatloaf for several years and it is the best.  But I don't bake in oven.  I shape into a loaf in a glass pan, cover and cook at 70 percent power in my microwave for 24-27 minutes.  Very moist and quite a crowd-pleaser. Really great with mild horseradish and for meatloaf sandwiches the next day.

I made some adjustments to the recipe and the dish was a huge success.  I added a 1/4cup of Granny Smith apple sauce and 1/2Tbs to the brown sugar mustard ketchup mix.  Also, Lined the bottom of the bread pan with Sliced Italian bread 1 layer, Then coated it with a paste made of 3/4c brown Sugar,1/4c water,1tbs cinnamon, and Italian bread crumbs added to make a paste that was just moist enough to spread on the bread. This soaked up grease from the lean ground meat. I then placed the meatloaf mix in which I only used a 1/2 of a onion diced and a small clove of diced garlic. After the 1hr time, I removed from oven then removed the bread from the bottom, (dumped on plate bottom side up) then recovered with the original pan and placed back in the oven at 225 for approx. 30 minutes while I completed side dishes.  This was the best meatloaf I  have ever made.

This is the best and easiest meatloaf recipe ever.  I also sauteed the onion since my son can spot an onion a mile away.  I omitted the topping since both son and hubby like ketchup only.  I even added 1/4 cup of ketchup to the meat mixture for an even better taste.  Thanks a million Janet!

I am not a big fan of the onion texture so I put the onion, egg, and milk in blender and liquefied it . I also not a fan of ketchup so I substituted it with bbq sauce, everything else I kept the same I will definitely make this recipe again.  I was very tasty, the rest of my picky eaters were none the wiser.

I found this receipe in a microwave cookbook many years ago. It is the same recipe except it added one tbsp of Worcestershire sauce. And instead of using brown sugar and mustard, you just pour a little ketchup on top. You cover it with wax paper and microwave it a 70% power for 22-24 minutes, then let it rest for 5 minutes. It is my favorite meatloaf recipe.

Amazingly delicious and easy to make.  triple the ketchup topping if you like it saucey! I too browned the onion with a tablespoon of jarred minced garlic. A tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, and switch up the bread crumbs to whatever I have on hand.  I've used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, plain, garlic and herb, and three cheese.  All work well with this recipe.  I've never wasted a slice of this yummy meatloaf!!!

Great, basic meatloaf recipe. Produces a moist and flavorful meatloaf. Instead of salt and pepper, I use garlic salt and steak seasoning. I also added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar last time, and that put it over the top!

I did this recipe mostly as written, however; I had to lightly brown the onions with some garlic in a little coconut oil just because. I also added come Cajun seasoning and my bread crumbs were seasoned. It is great, but; I guess it really wasn't this recipe any more. Thanks for the start.
I hope this helps others: when I have some bread that starts to dry a little, I add all kind of seasoning in a bowl, lightly toast bread so that it will crumble, run it through processor to mix, and put it on cookie sheet to finish drying and store in a hasped jar.That way, you never waste, you decide what seasoning and you never run out,

Pretty good, but I had to increase the cook time by about 35 minutes. It was still VERY pink when I took it out at one hour. Next time I would also take other reviewers' advice and sautee the onions first.

Good stuff, been using this for years. I like 2 eggs per lb of meat and Parmesan cheese. You can add sun dried tomato paste to the meat mix or use as a ketchup substitute with the topper. To avoid sugar, I use agave. For best results, brown the meatloaf before covering with the topper. Same recipe works for meatballs!

I have tried to make meatloaf a thousand times and it just never turned out right. But with this recipe it was great, including the sauce. My husband loved it also. The only difference I made was adding chopped green peppers, garlic powder and I omitted the milk. Yummy!

I have made this close to a dozen times. Easy and the family loves it. I always take a recipe and try to adjust to a personal preference. One thing I did was cook Japanese style rice using this method here http://allrecipes.com/recipe/perfect-sushi-rice/ and I added 2 1/2 cups cooked rice into, it helps it from shrinking and with the rice vinegar added in the rice it sure brings out a wonderful taste. I always add a little more onion since I am an onion lover, same with garlic. I also find if you do not want your meatloaf topping to caramelize, cook the meatloaf and the last 30 minutes pour it on. For some reason also, when making this I never meet the expected cooking time. 1 hour leaves it quite pink, although it could be thicker. Regardless my cooking time is closer to 1 hour 25 minutes. Great recipe and thanks for the share. As we speak the Japanese rice is cooking and the meatloaf for family is being prepared. Along with oven Jerky, homemade mozzarella and ricotta. Beautiful day in the kitchen. Thanks again

I've used this several times now and it's always delicious. I've tweaked it slightly every time until now it's just about perfect.
I add Worcester sauce as well, and topped the loaf with finely chopped green (spring) onions before I bake it. 
Breadcrumbs : I used half regular and half Panko, I'm not sure it made a real difference though. 
Re. the sauce:  We found it to be too sweet if made to the recipe, so the last time I made it, I used tomato puree rather than ketchup, and I dropped the sugar to about 1tbs rather than 2. 
For us that tasted much better, and more natural. 

Thanks so much for the recipe, even though I've added my own twist on it, it's delicious when made exactly to the recipe too.

I usually double this recipe & freeze leftovers in individual servings. It's a quick "grab & go" lunch or dinner. I mince the onions as small as possible & sometimes add other veggies like shredded carrots, minced red peppers & zucchini. Just make sure to blot any excess moisture from any veggies you add. This is a comfort food kind of meatloaf & certainly not one with many distinct flavors. It's quite good though.

Great, moist, tasty meatloaf.  Browned onions in butter, salt, pepper, garlic.  Reduced mustard to 3/4 tablespoon.

Super easy & so yummy!! I make it at least once a month. I threw in a little pork, sautéed the onions and bell peppers, seasoned with pepper, garlic powder & garlic salt, and I use Italian bread crumbs. Hit with the hubster, my 2 yr old & even my picky 5 year old who doesn't like meat!!

I loved this recipe, but made a couple minor changes. I added finely chopped bell pepper because I love it! And for the sauce, I added nutmeg instead of mustard based on a recipe from a former step-mother's recipe! It's a tangy sauce that I love! Oh, I also added crushed saltine crackers rather than breadcrumbs and omitted the salt! Very yummy!!

I modified this greatly based on what I had on hand and my preferences. I used 1 lb of 96% lean meat, 1 diced onion, 1 egg, about 4 slices of 5-grain seeded Italian bread crumbled, about 10 saltine cracker halves, no milk, some sage, parsley and thyme from my garden, a diced small green pepper and a small can of tomato sauce. I used the ketchup topping but mixed in a little vinegar and painted that on the top. I topped it with 2 slices of bacon, because, well bacon (and because my meat was so lean). Oh I also buzzed about 5 mushrooms in the food processor for the mix of meat because I had them. My cooked product put out a lot of moisture, but I poured it off and it was fine.

Yummy!  This was quick, easy, and exactly what I was looking for!  Hubby loved it, too!  I made it as written.  It did fall apart a bit but I probably cut into it too soon.  The taste was fabulous!

Great recipe! And it's easy to make. Only thing I changed is the glaze. Half the mustard and twice the brown sugar makes a sweeter glaze that's still tangy.

Loved it!  Had to use half ground beef & turkey but added steakhouse marinade, a little shredded cheese, Worcester sauce and seasoned salt. Reason being turkey tends to be a bit dry so these extras actually made it taste more beefy w/out adding all the beef. Perfect would definitely be making this again. Sorry no because as soon as it was done it was gone! Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!

With modification this meatloaf would be much better. I found it too soggy as it is and a little bland.  Next time I would reduce the amount of additions and in particular the milk.  I would add some more flavor (spices/herbs, etc) and some parmesan cheese as well.

This is a family favorite now.  I add worcestershire sauce, 2-3 tbsp and a ketchup & mustard mix to the meat to get the some the flavor of the topping in the loaf. Definitely easy and delicious.

This meatloaf is always a hit and my family can't get enough of it. I follow the basic recipe except I saute onions first before adding. I also add 1 Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce to meat.  For the topping I mix together 2/3 cup ketchup, 1/3 cup BBQ sauce, and 1 Tbsp dijon mustard.  And I aways make two at a time. One for dinner, and the other for seconds.

It's a family favorite. I minced the onion, added one packet of onion soup mix, 1/4 cup milk yes milk keeps meatloaf fluffy and moist , and doubled the glaze for the top of the meatloaf . Excellent!

I am relatively new to the meatloaf world, so I was looking for the simplest (but still flavorful) recipe for me and my kids.  I came across this recipe and tried it, AMAZING!! Its simple to prep and delicious as a leftover sandwich, YUM! I am also adding some BBQ sauce in the mixture to make it pop a bit, maybe next time I'll add jalapenos or mushrooms mmm TYVM for posting this wonderful recipe for beginners like myself

It would have been bland if I hadn't added 1 TBSP worcestershire. I sauteed the onion and a little garlic in some olive oil. It needs about 1 1/2 tsp salt. I used straight ketchup on top. I didn't want it too sweet.

Easy and delicious! I've made this several times. As others suggested, I do add a tablespoon of the  worsch. sauce to the meat mixture as well as sautéed the onions and garlic. I also find myself adding extra breadcrumbs and making double the sauce.

I had NEVER made a meatloaf before. I was cooking for 4 hungry people and everybody loved it! My dad and our roommate both had seconds and dad had some for lunch the next day. This was SOOOOOO good!
I used 2 lbs of ground beef, 3 eggs, 1 1/4 cup of milk, a packet of onion soup mix 1 1/2 cups of plain bread crumbs with about 3/4 teaspoon of salt, 2 teaspoons of white pepper and 2 teaspoons of garlic powder mixed in it for the meat mixture. I blended all of that with a mixer in medium speed for about 10 minutes.

For the topping I used tomato sauce instead of ketchup. I used 3 tablespoons of brown sugar, 3 tablespoons of plain yellow mustard, and a regular sized can of tomato sauce. 

I swear, it was the best meat loaf I had ever had. It had the most wonderful texture, was juicy and not overdone. The sauce came out marvelously and it was a huge hit with my family. 

Definitely gonna make this meat loaf for my fiance and the inlaws!

Took other reviewers recommendations and sauteed the onion with a couple cloves of minced garlic; used seasoned bread crumbs and added the Worcestershire sauce. I used the 5x9 loaf pan as indicated in the recipe and after 1 hour at 350 degrees it was still red inside. I ended up adding an additional 30 minutes to the posted cooking time. Tasted OK... hoping it firms up in the fridge overnight so I can get a decent sandwich out of it tomorrow.

This was THE meatloaf recipe when I was growing up. Only difference was that we doubled the sauce and added 1/4 of it to the meat before cooking. Love this meatloaf!

I added one cup of slightly sautéed diced portabella mushrooms, one-half cup of diced and slightly sautéed celery, one-half cup of diced green pepper, and fresh minced parsely to the meat mixture. Also, instead of ground beef I used ground bison. For the topping I substituted a mild Chilli sauce for the ketchup and added one teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce to the mustard (Bold and Spicy) and brown sugar. All I can say is ... FANTASTIC!!

This was amazing! My first time making meatloaf and I was absolutely amazed by how good it turned out :) I also made some changes as per what I read in the reviews, 
I sautéed the onions in butter, and I didn't use mustard (I don't like it) I had it in the oven at 350 for an hour but it wasn't done so I raised the temp to 400 for an additional 20 mins and it was perfect :) bravo! 
Bon appetite !

Got a big thumbs up from my husband.  It is very good.  Added the worcechester sauce as others suggested.  Everything else I did as noted.  I will double the sauce next time and put some on the bottom of the tray as someone else suggested prior to cooking.  Thanks for the recipe.

Janet, I tried this recipe about two weeks ago. I followed it to the letter except for one item. I thought I had mustard, but did not. So, me being a risk taker (not really), I tried using honey mustard. My kids (ages 8 & 10) and my roommate loved it. There wasn't any left for later. My roommate even said that he didn't have the upset stomach later on after dinner was over. Although it took a little longer to cook than mentioned in your recipe (probably because of my oven), it was a great hit and they want me to make it again. Thank you for the great recipe. -JamesH

This recipe is absolutely fabulous!  I had meatloaf mix, so I used that, and was short on bread crumbs so did a mixture of breadcrumbs and crushed saltines.  My husband and I said a number of times "wow, this is great!"

I lined a 9x9 pan with foil (big help on the cleanup) and shaped this into a loaf. Since I had 1/2 lb of ground pork from Swedish Meatballs that I made, I used that and 1/2 lb gr beef. I was low on ketchup so I also added a little chili sauce to both the meat and the sauce. Added a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce to the meat, as well as garlic and onion powder. I used a few pieces of crumbled-up bread for the crumbs. Since some said the sauce was a little sweet, I cut back on the brown sugar by 1 TBLSP. Doubling-up on the sauce may be a good idea, because then you'd have extra to spoon over the meat. Very easy, moist and delicious. Thanks Janet!

This receipe for an "easy" meatloaf is delicious and EASY!  I would cut back on the mustard the next time I made this one though for a more subtle taste.  Great 'go to' weekday receipe!

Great base recipeI doubled the ground beef so I used 3 pounds of 93/7. I also followed some previous reviewer's advice I sautéed the onions added garlic and Bellpepper in butter before adding to meatloaf mixture and a dash or two of Worchestire (spelling?) sauce I also cut back on the amount of breadcrumbs I only used about 1 1/2 cups of seasoned bread crumbs. I did use two eggs and doubled the milk I did also add my own seasonings and just used steak seasoning instead of just salt-and-pepper  I also opted for a brown gravy this time instead of the traditional ketchup sauce. I used an internal baking thermometer and mine was done within about 55 minutes. My four-year-old and my husband enjoyed it!

Added A1 sauce to the meat mixture instead of worcestershire sauce. I sauted the onions in half butter half olive oil. In the sauce I also added A1 sauce and a table spoon of soy sauce. Turned out great. Served it with cheesy hashbrowns. It was a hit!

Excellent! Very moist, which I was very impressed and happy with! First time my son, age 20, said he loved the meatloaf and he did not ever remember it tasting so good.   I didn't make the topping as I thought he would think it was too sweet. Meatloaf was on the bland side so spice it up more if you want to. My family was ok with it not being super jazzed up. I did use the dry minced onions as I did not have the time to fix fresh onions. Definitely a keeper!

The texture on this meatloaf was perfect! I added in chopped garlic and some crushed red pepper to the onions and it was great. The only thing I would change is maybe reducing or removing the brown sugar from the topping. it was almost like a barbecue sauce flavor which isn't bad but my boyfriend and I wanted a more traditional flavor.

Great meatloaf. I also added worstechire sauce and doubled the topping portions. The topping was a bit too katchupy flavored so next time I would reduce the amount of katchup. I also baked it for about an hour and 20 minutes. My husband loved it!

Very good, as long as you listen to the reviews: add 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce to the meat; use italian breadcrumbs; cook longer, but not more than 165; saute the onions in butter; line the pan with foil; double the ketchup mixture and use less mustard. Huge hit with my Minnesota man. Better than mom's! (Shhh don't tell!)

Followed the recipe with the following exceptions:
1. Added Worcestershire
2. diced small onion and added it to mixture
3. Added envelope of Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix

It was the best meatloaf I've ever made!  Both kids came back for seconds too! Tons of flavor!!!

I made this recipe. Please read to the end, there is good with the bad. In my opinion only a half an onion should be used, wow I did the whole onion as suggested and it was too much! It actually took an hour and half to bake. I let the meat rest while I cooked instant potatoes and corn, the meat was still a bit crumbly. The amount of glaze was enough to cover the loaf, but I needed more to drizzle over the slices once baked, but it was quick to make. The glaze was amazing!! I'll be adjusting this recipe for the next time. Overall it was simple to make and it was a decent meal...if you like lots of onions. Thank you for adding your recipe here!

I just tried this recipe tonight for my family. It was delicious and the directions are very simple. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who needs a quick and easy recipe for meat loaf. I didn't take a pic of it until my elderly father and my 10 year old daughter got ahold of it, therefore the picture does not do it any justice.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever made! My husband and I loved it.  Typically I only make meatloaf once in awhile but we had this twice in 2 weeks.  I did modify the topping part of it however. After reviewing a bunch of meatloaf recipes, I ended up using the sauce from Tennessee Meatloaf.  YUM!

It crumbled a bit and was hard to cut into slices, but that could possibly be chef error and not recipe error, unsure

AWESOME!!! This is my go to meatloaf recipe. My family requests this on weekly basis and every time it's a winner. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing!! The only "change" I made was add Italian breadcrumbs instead of regular bread crumbs.

I used to always make my mom's meatloaf. I wanted something a bit "better". I LOVE this recipe. I followed the suggestion of a reviewer and let the breadcrumbs and milk sit together for a bit before adding it. The sauce on top is my fiancé's favorite part. Thank you for this recipe!!! I have shared it many times!!!

Great recipe, thanks! Sometimes I use honey instead of brown sugar, but the brown sugar is de-lish. If I'm in the mood, I'll make a bit more and mix in the ketchup-honey/sugar mixture throughout, as well as on top, but don't tell anyone. :)

This was so good! I added Penzey 's BBQ 3000 seasoning and Worcestershire to the beef mixture and doubled the topping while reducing the mustard like others suggested. My hub loved it .

My husband has told me he didn't like meatloaf, but I wanted to give it a shot myself so used this recipe. The first time around, I messed up and added the mustard to the meat itself, but still ended up delicious! This recipe is very easy and prep time is short. My substitutes are 1 packet of onion soup mix (instead of the onion), stone ground mustard (instead of reg mustard. Gives a kick) and seasoned bread crumbs (instead of reg bread crumbs). I don't add any salt or pepper to it.

My husband and I made this recipe and we followed the instructions of other reviewers with the onions and the worcestershire sauce but think the measurement for the amount of bread crumbs was off, it should have been less at least to our tastes probably could have cut it by 1/2 cup. It didn't taste horrible but the taste and consistency was not what we imagined.  Will try again with less bread crumbs and re-review.

This was FANTASTIC.  I have been trying for years to replicate my mother's meatloaf, and this one is the closest I've gotten!  It was absolutely perfect with no changes, substitutions, or modifications at all.  I remembered someone mentioned worcestershire sauce after it was in the oven but it honestly didn't need it.  And it was CHEAP to make!  I paid $6 for the meat (yesterday's, sale rack!) and another few cents for the onion and everything else was a staple I keep in the house.  I'll admit to more than one serving tonight!

The taste of this recipe was outstanding. However, my 8 and 4 year olds refused to eat it as there were visible pieces of what looked like uncooked onions throughout. Therefore, I would recommend either sauteeing or pureeing the onions before adding them to the ground beef.

We just tried this recipe last night and my husband loved it!!  I used the recommendation of adding Worcestershire Sauce and used half low fat turkey and half low fat hamburger meat.  Unfortunately, I didn't have ketchup so I used part honey bbq sauce and part mustard with just a tsp of splenda brown suger for the topping.  It turned out great!!  My husband had 3 servings last night and even had leftovers for breakfast with a fried egg on top!

I made this last night for dinner and it was almost perfect. Since I don't like onions I left those out and added onion powder, garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce (didn't measure these, just threw some in until it looked right). Next time I'll omit the sauce on top because baked ketchup is kind of nasty. Had the leftovers for lunch and it still tasted great.

Okay, on the plus side it was moist.  On the down side it lacked flavour.  In future, I would add diced red pepper and worcestershire sauce and see what that does.  Maybe some garlic too.

Very easy and tasty. Used sage and onion breadcrumbs (because I had them) and substituted dehydrated onion flakes (because I don't like cutting onions) and cooked an extra 25 minutes. Also held back a bit of the sauce and applied after 45 minutes cook time. Will definitely do this again.

I made this, and of course tweaked it a bit. I used worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, and red gold ketchup for the glaze and i added some of this mixture to my meatloaf, plus a tbsp of italian herbs and an envelope of dry onion soup mix. My family raves over this and there are no leftovers!

Wasn't thoroughly cooked after an hour at 350 preheated.  I'll use a thermometer next time and probably add another 15 minutes.

As always, I didnt leave this recipe alone. I added 3 pieces of chopped crisp bacon to the meat mixture and I used the grease to saute the onions with a some Mrs.Dash. I also added 3 splashes of Worcestershire sauce and because I didnt read the instructions I added a tbsp. of brown mustard to the meat. In addition, I used seasoned breadcrumbs in place of plane. I doubled the ketchup and brown sugar but only used about 1 1/2 tbsp. mustard in the topping. Baked in a loaf pan and not free formed this was a wonderful meatloaf! Its my new go-to recipe for meatloaf.

This recipe was so easy and tasty.  I ve never added milk to my meatloaf and surprised how tender the meatloaf was. I added instant oats instead of breadcrumbs because thats all I had at the time. I did add a package of goya sazon to ad a little more portuguese style. I will definetely make this again. There wasnt much left over and sliced the rest very thin and had sandwiches the next day

I just made this recipe tonight for a romantic evening with my fiance, i paired it with mashed potatos (his favorite) and steamed carrots (my favorite). I also cooked a couple cobs of corn ,just because i love the cobbed corn(corn on the cob)!! I wasn't sure about it because the meatloafs ive made in the past called for a can of tomato sauce to mix into the meat mixture and this one does not.  But this one, speaking lightly, it is amazing!! i love the way the brown sugar ,, mustard and ketchup topping tasted ! But, i kind of tweaked it by adding double the ketchup and about half honey barbecue sauce. it is worth it ! so simple, yet so yummy!   xoxo kayla

This was EXCELLENT. Moist, easy to make, and my picky 9 and 11 year olds asked for seconds!! I followed some of the other's suggestions...cut the mustard amount in half, doubled the sauce for the top, increased baked time to 1 1/2 hours, added a tablespoon of worcestershire to the meat mixture, and sauteed' the onions with a little garlic before I added them to the meat mixture. I let the whole thing rest about 10 min after it came out of the oven, before I cut into it.  Deeeeeelishhh!

I make this recipe or some variation of it everytime I make a meatloaf.  I must say that this TYPICALLY turns out excellent.  The only time it doesn't is when it is my fault and I mix the ingredients too much and the meatloaf comes out lacking in texture.  Some of the variations that I have done in the past... grate the onion instead of chop it gives the onion flavor without the crunch, use 1/2 lb sausage one lb beef instead of 1 1/2 lb beef (changes up the spices a little).  In the summer I add fresh basil and thyme. 
I do vary the sauce a little when I make this.. I cut the brown sugar down to 1 T and I add 1 T of A1 in place of one of the T's of Mustard (just personal preference).

All in all- excellent recipe.

Super easy! And a really good base recipe. I took other's advice and sautéed onions, green, and red peppers in olive oil and garlic. I also added Worcestershire sauce and steak sauce to the mix as well as doubling the ketchup sauce. So surprisingly moist. Will def make again

It's a great very easy recipe. To the chef that said it was too sweet, I think she confused 1 or 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, with 1 or 2 CUPS, which is really too much. With the strong flavor of ketchup and mustard, just 1 tablespoon of sugar is enough. THANK YOU

Easy to make - I used Shredded cheese ( Mexican blend) in stead of milk, plus 1/3c. Katsup in side loaf, cooked brown rice in place of bread/crackers, added an extra egg, and made double the topping. 
I tasted it and decided that when I next make it I will use half of the amount of brown sugar and add 1 Tbls. of Salt to the loaf. It's yummy and will be an excellent dinner.

Loved the recipe. I, too, sautéed the onions before adding to the mixture. Also,  needed to cook for 1 1/2 hours.

This recipe made me like meatloaf. I did my own spin to it and did half ground beef and half pork. I also mixed the sauce mix in with the meat and made a second sauce mix and spread it on top. It is mouth watering and all my friends love it!!!! This recipe is a life saver. I also leave out the onions because I'm not a big fan but, man 'o man is it tasty!!! Yum! Yum!

Great recipe as is, have used it about a dozen time with turkey or beef. I've tried it with Worcestershire and without, with cubes of cheddar added, adding green peppers, and varying the amount of brown sugar. It's a very versatile recipe but I still give it 5 stars as is. Boyfriend loves it, and having turned up my nose to meatloaf for about a decade I'm a card carrying meatloaf addict now!

Great recipe but cut back on the bread crumbs unless you like your meatloaf or meatballs bready. I never use more than a half cup of bread crumbs and I also only used a half cup milk. We're trying to make meatloaf here, not meat-flavored bread. :-)

Great recipe.  I used half and half instead of milk, and didn't have brown sugar so substituted honey.  Also, added about 3 strips of bacon on top, just to add that smokey flavor.  Delicious!!!

Made this a number of times, always good. Substituted egg whites for egg, slightly more crumbs, a little spaghetti sauce, and a sprinkling of Worchestershire sauce. Also modded the topping to be less sweet..added some wasabi like hot sauce with tomato sauce, mixed and brushed. Killer.

Super easy and tastes great!  I vary it by mixing in a can of stewed tomatoes with the meat mix and because of the additional water, I heat it at 375 degrees rather than 350.

Great easy recipe and tasty meatloaf too.

The only alteration I made was to substitute Sugar Free (Splenda) syrup for the brown sugar.

Didn't have any milk so added heavy cream and used 3/4 cup. Was so good. Will make this again. Was suggested to use the toppings in the middle and also top... might try that next time!

Tonight is the third time I've made this. Family loved it the first time and there are never any leftovers.  Made mine more like dump the ingredients in....no measuring just going by looks and feel when mixing, comes out great every time. I also add barbecue sauce and Worcester sauce. Easiest meatloaf ever and best tasting.

This was yummy. I'll definitely make it again, though I may lessen the sugar next time. I followed the directions exactly, but the topping was just a touch too sweet to make it 5 stars.

I sautéed the onion and used one pound of hamburger I also per other suggestions increased the sauce for the top. Husband raved about how moist it was and full if flavor (I used garlic and herb bread crumbs) absolutely delicious I have found a new meatloaf recipe we love after 36 years of marriage :-) thank you for a great recipe!!!

This is a great recipe and really easy I cooked the onions as in the reviews and used seasoned bread crumbs I added half a package of McCormick meatloaf seasoning and I tripled the sauce I ended up with too much I also used honey mustered in the sauce instead of regular mustard.

I have made this recipe several times and my family loves it. I also used flavored bread crumbs, and I didn't use mustard in the sauce. Will always use this recipe when my family wants meatloaf.

Great recipe! I doubled the sauce as I didn't feel there was enough, added about 2 tablespoons of sauce to meat mixture then used the rest for the topping. Also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I baked mine longer than recipe calls for 1hr 30 min.

I took the advice of others and cooked the onions in a pan (in low heat, just till they become clear) first, and it makes a BIG difference. The consistency is perfect with the addition of the milk. Hint: good chopped meat makes good meatloaf. Don't cheap out! Get the good sirloin and it makes a great difference. This is now a family favorite in our home.

I liked it alot.  I did as a few recommended - added worcestershire sauce and sauted the onions.  I didn't care for the brown sugar; otherwise, really good!

It's good. My husband said it needed more seasoning. I sautéed the onions like some folks suggested. I added cayenne pepper, salt and pepper to the onions then added pepper to the meat mix. Next time I'll use dried parsley, basil, oregano and thyme in the meat mix as well as the pepper and salt.

I have made this several times, but have altered it slightly each time.  Last night was the best--I only had a pound of hamburger (93% lean) so I used that and sautéd the onions as others have mentioned, added Worcestershire sauce, a little ketchup and garlic powder, and replaced the bread crumbs with a cup of stovetop stuffing mix for chicken.  I also added a handful of quick cooking oats, which makes it nice and light.  We prefer the standard ketchup to the top instead of the sauce, but it was a huge hit.

Easy and taste great! The only thing I do differently is caramelize the onions first, then mix it all together.

After reading comments, I sauteed the onions (I actually sauteed them in onion soup mix with a little oil and butter-- weird, I know, but I think it added a great flavor). Also added worchestershire. The reviews had me a little concerned about the sauce, so I didn't make a ton of it-- huge mistake-- the sauce was delicious. I will definitely double the recipe next time-- I did use brown mustard instead of prepared. Hubby doesn't like mustard at all, so I didn't want to give any indication that the recipe contained mustard). I also used italian seasoned breadcrumbs. my only complaint-- it was really greasy with chuck-- next time, I will use the 93% lean meat and hope that it doesn't come out too dry. I did use the loaf pan-- maybe I would lose some of the grease if I cooked it in a 9x13?

Great recipe! So simple and brainless! I changed one ingredient  and it makes it twice as good and i haven't seen it done anywhere else yet!   I removed the onion and added  ROASTED 8RED PEPPER! Probably good without removing the onion too. But the red pepper changes everything about the way meatloaf is.

Just made a couple changes... stale sourdough bread in the food processor to make bread crumbs.  Added egg, milk, breadcrumbs and other things together then added meat at end. Then covered with ketchup mixture.  Took longer to cook.. about 1.5 hours.   Ended up upping the heat to 400. Yum!

My wife loved it. i messed up and mixed all the wet ingredients then folded in the meat, bread crumbs, etc. I did not realize the ketchup (i used spaghetti sauce) and mustard were for the glaze, oops!  but it still tasted great and no harm no foul. i only baked for about 30-35 minutes because i modified the recipe by putting the meatloaf into a muffin pan. it made 16 meatloaf muffins and they are easier to handle and portion out. ensure you butter (or spray) the pan beforehand for easier removal.

i'll be making this again soon. it is going into the rotation.

Never made meatloaf before so I was a little nervous that my family would approve of it. I accidentally made a double batch but it turned out to be such a hit that we ate every last bit. Thanks!

Wow. This was highly pleasant to the taste (the definition of delicious).  We really enjoyed it and ate more than we needed in one meal.  We cooked this about 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated.

I did follow suggestions in the reviews: sautéed onions ahead, added garlic powder and Worcestershire and I used a mixture of croutons/seasoned bread crumbs/saltines.  For the topping, I reduced the amount of mustard (I have this "thing" about mustard). The meatloaf was delicious! Best ever!  My husband actually lied to my adult son by stating that it had "entirely too much onion" in it just so he wouldn't want any, thereby securing his 2nd helping that night and plenty on the following evening. Come on fellow cooks, you know something's good when people lie in order to prevent anyone else from eating any! 
A must-try! Happy cooking!

We line a loaf pan with bacon before putting meatloaf mixture in.  Then turn over onto grate in baking dish. Cover with sauce in recipe (doubled). My boyfriend raves that it's better than his Mom's! Also followed suggestions of other posters, ie. Cooking onions first, Worcestershire sauce, etc. Fantastic!

I made this recipe tonight with ground turkey. It came out very bland and undercooked after an hour. I followed the recipe exactly. Overall, the meatloaf was too mushy. Even my kids didn't like it. Maybe we are  just not a meatloaf fans:( I won't be making this recipe again.

I didn't have any bread crumbs so I crushed up some ritz crackers (same amount) and used them and my husband loved it. Said it was the best meatloaf he ever had. Thanks!

I made this tonight for supper and followed the directions and ingredients given. We really enjoyed it, my husband kept going back for more.  This recipe is certainly a keeper. Thank you Janet for sharing.

Very basic and not very flavorful as written. I added Worcestershire sauce, peppers and garlic as some had suggested, and it was still not that flavorful - can't imagine what it would have been like without.  I would have liked a little direction as to the quantity of salt and pepper, since you can't taste a raw hamburger mixture to gauge how much to add as you would soup. As for the sauce on top, you can do as well with a good barbecue sauce - or for that matter - dabbing some ketchup on top. I did like the suggestion to add milk, had never heard of that, and it did add some moisture to the recipe. Will continue to look for a meatloaf recipe that's got a little more going for it.

I love this recipe. I've made it many times and it always turns out great. It's very easy and the whole family loves it. I sauté the chopped onion with garlic and butter before combining it with the other ingredients. Delicious!

Was an excellent base recipie.  I added my own extras such as bell pepper.  I also used Penko bread crumbs for a more dense meatloaf.  The sause was excellent!!! Had to make more sauce ??

this was my first time making meatloaf and was quite pleased with the result. very simple to make and i feel the sweetness of the sauce really adds to this dish. i did add worcestershire sauce like other reviewers as well as fresh diced garlic.

My family loved this meatloaf.  Doubled the quantities because of the big eaters coming to dinner.   The few leftovers quickly disappeared into someone's car.  Definitely double the tasty gravy.  It really makes this a favorite.

I made 2lb of ground beef instead of 1.5 so i cooked for 1hr 25minutes.  It seemed very bland and had too much onion.  I will play with the ingredients and maybe add worchestershire sauce next time or more salt and pepper. I might also use a shallower pan instead of the 5 x 9 which seemed too deep.

I love this recipe. I altered it a little though. I'm not a fan of onions much so I replaced the fresh chopped onions with frenches fried onions! My 6 year old son loved it so much and the brown sugar mix on top is amazing, sweet but not too sweet. A great quick go to meal for a family of 3 or 4!

Worked great.  I left out the onions.  I turned it into bacon cheddar meatloaf.  Added cubes of mild cheddar to the mix and wrapped the whole thing in bacon.  Put shredded cheddar on top when it was done.

I added a Kroger's meatloaf seasoning mix, Italian seasoning, pepper, and I only used one egg instead of two. This is my first time making the meatloaf. I gave myself 3 stars because of the presentation. It tastes ok. Oh, I used 2 pounds of ground beef instead of 1 and 1/2.

I gave this a 5 because it is better than my other attempts at making meatloaf. Very delicious and easy to make. The only thing I will do differently next time is add a lil more seasoning. I didn't want to over do but the onion and green peppers I added gave it a lot of flavor. I did not sautéed my onions or peppers. I like the "crunch".  Overall very good!

The meatloaf was a hit with my family and myself. The only thing I did differently was double the portions so we had dinner for the next night also. Absolutely loved it, and easy to make.

Very good basic recipe. I reccomend sautéing the onions before mixing with the ground beef. I found the sauce too sweet. Next time I will use Dijon mustard and reduce the brown sugar.  Very tasty as is, but would be absolutely delicious with a little tweaking.

Pretty good recipe. It's quick and easy and infinitely upgradable. 

One thing I must point out: the recipe says "salt and pepper to taste" and that is at the raw meat and egg stage... This is a bad idea.  Call it a teaspoon (+) and taste it once it is cooked.

Absolutely love it! I tried it the first time just as is, only adding red bell peppers and it was amazing!  Oh, I did forget to add the sauce on top until the last 10 minutes and it still turned out great. I've also tried it with the suggestions: sautéing onions and garlic, adding the Worcestershire sauce, and bell peppers and it was also great. Again, I didn't add the sauce until the last 10 minutes only because I had done that the previous time and I really loved it. I feel that I tend to have more control of sweetness that way. I love sweet food so I sometimes double up the sauce. My hubby likes it with less sauce and my little girl likes it with almost no sauce, she scoops it right off. Anyway, it's a winner in my family's tummy. Thank you!  :)

I also sauteed the onions and instead of mustard and brown sugar I used a couple table spoons of BBQ sauce in the ketchup on top. Also I added a half cup of parmesan and a couple table spoons of ketchup into the meatloaf to. It was so moist and cohesive flavor between the BBQ and parmesan. Also sometimes I put a bacon layer on top when there's twenty minutes left. I also tried it by the recipe exactly and it wasn't nearly as good because the meatloaf was a plain okay cheeseburger flavor and the sauce was too sweet. So this revised version is definitely my main meatloaf recipe now.

While it was moist, it didn't have a lot of flavor even though I put sautéed green peppers and 1 TBS of Worcestershire sauce in it.

This is my go-to recipe for meatloaf. And by far the best. It smells and tastes great. And so easy! I add some ground pork and have even used crushed Ritz crackers (had no breadcrumbs!) for a more buttery and juicy final product. You can tailor this recipe to your liking. A++++

Best one I've found so far! I've made this recipe five times now and I've had many complements on it. The only thing I suggest is cutting the onion real small so it cooks, there's No need to saute them .Thank You for the great recipe!

This recipe has really good consistency and taste! I, like others, added about a TBSP of Worcestershire sauce and sautéed fresh onion and garlic in real butter. I had to cut back on the milk or it would have been too watery. Cooked 45 minutes covered at 350 then uncovered for the last 15 minuted. Easy to make and delicious

This was awesome. I need a few changes based on other reviews: I sautéed one whole white onion with some butter and fresh thyme.  I sautéed some finely chopped mushrooms and garlic in butter. I added one table of Worcestershire sauce to the meat. I used 4 teaspoons instead of 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. I handed up having to cook it for an hour and 10 minutes. Also I put the whole loaf over some mushroom slices. It was really moist with a great flavor. I think next time I'll make some extra sauce in case somebody wants to use a little on their plate but honestly the flavor of the meat itself was so good it probably doesn't need more sauce.

Made this for my dad's birthday (for family).  Sautéed diced carrots with onion & garlic before adding to meat, milk, herbed breadcrumbs & egg. Doubled the ketchup, brown sugar, mustard (added Worcestershire) topping and even saved some to put on top of meat after slicing. Had to bake for 1 hr, 20 min.

Will definitely keep this recipe!

Yesterday I followed this recipe but the meatloaf came moist but too crumbly and bland. So today I did the following:  (1) Sautéed the garlic. (2) Added sautéed green peppers. (3) Added mined garlic. (4) Added fresh minced jalapeño. (5) Added dried oregano. (6) Let the meatloaf sit for 10 minutes (before cutting)  after I removed it from the oven. The tweeks mentioned below created a tasteful, exciting meatloaf! Can't wait to share with folks.

I make this for supper at the fire house and it's a crowd pleaser! I add 1 cup of BBQ sauce to the mixture and then brush the top of the loaf with BBQ sauce before cooking. Also I eliminate the milk to help keep it more solid.

Super simple easy meal! I get off at 5pm this meat loaf was ready by 7pm. Of course I made it my own adding red pepper, garlic, rosemary and home made bread crumbs. Also added more ketchup to the sauce topping. But over all wonderful easy recipe. Since it takes an hour to cook after prep you can help with homework and baths and whaaala dinner is served!

This was excellent! I added brown sugar to the meat mixture by accident, but it was so good! I also added some ketchup to the meat mixture. It was super moist like meatloaf should be.

Great basic recipe. Can be adjusted in so many ways. I add worcestershire sauce and minced garlic to mine...no onions. I do 3 lbs for my family and keep the 1 egg , 1 cup milk and 1 cup bread crumbs.

It was way to moist. I added paprika, garlic and sage. Also a tiny bit of BBQ in the sauce.

I made this recipe for my picky family and they loved it.  I used Italian seasoned Panko bread crumbs and added one onion Lipton packet.  I also used 1 lb beef and 1 lb pork. My family now requests this at least once a week.  It is very moist and flavorful.

This was an easy meatloaf but it was a bit mushy due to bread crumbs - will try crackers next round.

This was my first time making meatloaf.  I followed some of the suggestions and it came out amazing!  I just added 1 tbs worcestershire sauce,  1 green pepper chopped, and Italian style bread crumbs.  I also sautéed the onion and green peppers in butter and minced garlic first to soften.

I made this and the only alteration I did was add 1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce, and I sautéed the onions in butter with garlic before adding.  It turned out so moist, but was not falling apart.  My teenaged boys and my five-year-old ate seconds, which is always a good sign.  I will make this again!

The meatloaf was delicious.  The kids loved it and had seconds.  I'll be making this again for sure!  I forgot to put the Worcestershire sauce in the meat mixture as recommended by some reviewers and so I instead put it in the meatloaf gravy which made it even more tasty.  Thank you!

I wish it was around long enough to take a photo! It fed my family of six with no leftovers, which disappointed them greatly. They wanted more. I cut back on the milk, and added a little at a time. I also followed another reviewers lead and sauteed the onions with a bit of garlic before adding them to the rest. I also put in a pinch of marjoram and some smoked paprika. I also added half the sauce at the beginning and the other half 15 minutes before the end. It was moist and flavorful.

This dinner was good and my husband really liked it. He is a hard man to please when it comes to dinners. Instead of putting all ground beef,  I put 1 pound of ground beef and 1/2 pound of mild ground sausage to give it a kick.

For someone that doesn't really like meatloaf I thought this was great. My hubby who is a meatloaf fanatic didn't like it as much.  I only used 1/3 of an onion and added 1 clove of garlic and sautéed them in butter and 1T worchestersire as other reviewers said. He thought the texture was too mushy and there was something in it he didn't like, maybe the 1 small clove of garlic I used. I would make this again but maybe use less milk to get a different texture and no garlic. This was very moist and had a good flavor even without all the onion the recipe called for.

I made this recipe but substituted ground turkey and pork sausage.  I also sautéed garlic, onions and red pepper.  I had some left over quinoa, carrots and didn't have any bread crumbs around so I used 2 lunch bag size of Sun Chips crushed for the replacement. I also added the Worcestershire to the mix.  In the sauce I have played with the mustards; I did separately grey poupon and durkee. They were both fantastic.  Now my husband always says that I never make a meal the same twice. (He's right)  I thought I would write it down so that I wouldn't forget.  It was delicious.  I have saved this one in my recipe box for sure. Moist, Juicy, and Delicious! Hopefully I will get close when I repeat it.  I can't wait for the sandwiches for leftovers.  MA from STL

It was way too moist and there were WAY too many onions. The meat mixture was very bland and definitely needed more flavoring. The sauce for the topping had too much mustard. I will not be making this recipe again.

This is a staple meal at our house.  I use dried minced onions and a hint of red pepper basil seasoning.  I double the ketchup and brown sugar (and leave the mustard the same) because we love the sauce.  Delicious!

Fabulous meatloaf and oh so easy.  Didn't think I'd like the sauce spead over the top but WOW was I wrong. Until this recipe I didn't have a "go to" meatloaf recipe.  Since trying this one, this is the only recipe I will use.

Kid approved!  My extremely picky eater loved this meatloaf.  I took note of some reviews and added Worcestershire sauce and sautéed finely diced o ions in butter before adding to the mixture.  I also used Grey Poupon Country Dijon mustard for the topping mixture.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Like most of the reviewers, I modified my seasonings to my tastes, however, I added the ketchup/mustard/brown sugar topping after 40 minutes of cooking. Still seeps into the loaf a bit, but does not dry out to a gooey paste on top. Still perfecting it, but basic recipe is great. sauteing onions prior to adding to mix is a huge plus to flavor. adding some garlic does the same, either straight to the mix or to the onions prior to saute. Worcester sauce seems to add to flavor too (I call it my secret ingredient, though it isn't too secret, since I tell everybody).

Soak the bread crumps into the milk for about half an hour before mixing (including the not absorbed milk) with the other ingredients. The roast gets more juicy and fluffy. I also added mustard, Worcestershire Sauce (if available you can also use MAGGI), thyme, basil, Oregano and marjoram (1 teaspoon of each).

Great recipe. I cut up onions really small. I also used Italian bread crumbs and I tried a mix of beef pork and veal. OMG it was gone.

I gave this recipe a five star rating because it was quick, easy and tasted very good to my picky eaters. As a working mother you are looking for a quick way to feed the kids and something they will eat. You have the ingredients already and it was cooked in a hour! Perfect timing after all the homework was done we were able to sit down to a hot meal and a great one too!

I must say I was very excited about this recipe as I really LOVE meatloaf. I took most of the suggestions of other users with regards to sauteing the onion before mixing it, using seasoned bread crumbs, and doubling the topping mixture (with a little less mustard). 

First off I must say that I'm not an inexperienced cook. I cooked professionally for about 10 years in my early 20's. I have however never made a meatloaf before. I don't know why, I just haven't. I had 2 lbs of nice ground chuck so I changed the recipe's ingredients slightly to account for the extra meat. I used the following in the actual loaf: 

2 pounds ground beef
 1-1/4 egg
 1-1/4 onion, chopped
 1-1/4 cups milk
 1-1/4 cups dried bread crumbs
 salt and pepper to taste

Once i had combined the toppings for the loaf, I noticed that it was quite mushy/liquid like. The instructions say to form it into a loaf if you are using a 9x13 inch pain instead of a loaf pan. Forming it into a loaf was not an option, so I just did the best I could to get it evenly into the pan. I'm not sure why it was so liquidy.

As far as the topping I used guldens spicy brown mustard, instead of a regular yellow mustard. I think maybe this hurt the flavor profile of the topping considerably. I shouldn't have done this, but oh well. 

I just really wasn't too impressed by the finished product. I think adding the extra meat was possibly the culprit. I do think that adding some additional bread crumbs may have helped, but IDK... Thoughts?

Just made this tonight! Its delicious! I used a cup of saltine crackers because I don't have bread crumbs. I added a tablespoon of worcestershire and sauteed shallot to the meat. Although, mine came out quite mushy but its delicious!

I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and it turned out great.  It was very moist,  not dry at all and very delicious.  Super easy to make to.

So for starters, I used a pound of ground chuck, and half of a pound of ground pork. I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, and tripled the sauce. I lightly sautéed the onions with a bit of crushed garlic.i put one fourth of the sauce mixture in the middle of the loaf, covered the loaf with another 2/3. I set aside the rest. Finally,  I baked it for one hour and twenty minutes at 350 degrees.

This is probably the best meatloaf I've tried. The only thing I did different was added 1 teaspoon garlic powder. The top glaze was sweet and tangy - I'll surley be making this again.

The Meatloaf turned out wonderful!  I got Thank you from the kids!!!  And we know how kids can be hard to please.  I have tried several recipes that I did not care for at all.  This was a hit.  I added a 1/2 cup of milk and made my own mixture for the sauce.

Best meatloaf I've had! It was so simple to make as well. I took the advise of some of the other reviews and sauteed the onions with some minced garlic first as well as added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce too. These little changes definitely elevated the flavors in the meatloaf. Will definitely go on my cycle of meals to make.

This was delishhh! My family loved it. The only ingredient that was missing was the onions, could have been better with them and if I did add them of course I would have sautéed them... plus I did not exactly wait the hour as instructed, I actually added more time since at an hour looked kinda not ready.. added an extra 30min and came out perfect, that's cause I used only one lb of meat. Thanks to the helpful comments on the bread crumbs I used a bag seasoned bread crumbs that was a left over since thanksgiving which it was about to expire, perfect timing. A+++ for this dish and definitely going to make again.

Super easy and delicious (and I wasn't a big meatloaf fan before)! Used 2/3 ground beef, 1/3 ground pork.  Cooked it a little longer (1.25-1.5 hrs).

We Love It!  This is the BEST meatloaf recipe I have ever tried.  Freezes beautifully; I place 1/2 the recipe in 2x4 mini loafs to freeze for my mothers dinners.  I double the glaze and sometimes the recipe.

I put peppers in mine, and I don't like putting gravy or the ketchup/mustard mix on top of my meatloaf, I grew up with pasta sauce on my meatloaf, so I putt a chunky prego veggie pasta sauce mixed with a little bit of meat pasta sauce on top. It was SOOOO good thank you!

I made meatloaf muffins with this recipe and it filled 12 muffin tins nicely. As muffins it took 40 minutes to cook. It probably could have gone 5 minutes longer as the "crust" wasn't as crispy as I like. 

The taste was not bad, though only one of my 4 kids really enjoyed it. The only change I made was adding 1 Tbsp of worcestershire to the meat. It was still pretty bland, though. I probably could have added more salt and pepper but didn't know how to season it to taste without tasting it!! I will keep looking.

Made this last night.  My wife loved it but didn't like the sauce.  The kids and I thought it was a little too mushy but loved the sauce.  Overall, it was good.  (I did add a little worcestershire sauce to the meat)

I've made this recipe twice now, and I'm still in love with it. I love all things brown sugar, so I added a cup more brown sugar than what the recipe calls for (if you do this, make sure you mix it in really, really well!). Mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus complement it perfectly, but when I'm low on produce, instant mashed potatoes with a heap of butter and canned green beans work too! One of my favorite recipes!

Pretty basic recipe. I find that adding an additional egg and reducing the amount of milk keeps it together better. I also add worchester and garlic for extra flavor.

my husband absolutely loved this recipe! He is a real picky eater but he practically ate the whole thing alone. I did however, follow others advice on using seasoned bread crumbs. He's not a huge fan of the sauce so I made creamy mash potatoes with gravy and it hit the spot!

Really good recipe. I'm not a fan of onions so i did not add any onion but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. My husband said this recipe was better than his grandmas meatloaf which meant a lot to me. I served it with mashed potatoes and candied carrots. YUMMY!

Wasn't the best meatloaf I had, but it wasn't horrible either. My biggest issue was the amount of onion in it. One full onion overpowered everything else.

Wonderful recipe; very easy and tasty.  I got a lot of compliments!

The only two small changes I made were making the pieces of sauteed onion a bit bigger than minced in order to have that pop of onion flavor upon biting in

I also didn't have any mustard, so for the sauce I threw together some ketchup, garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce.  Worked great!  Thanks for this recipe!

OK, this is a basic recipe and I took other comments into consideration when I made this.  I did sauté garlic, bell peppers, onion and garlic to add to the meatloaf mixture.  I lowered the amount of mustard to 1 Tbsp, 3/4 C milk, and did 2/3 C of ketchup.  I also added Worcestershire sauce with Italian seasoning and parsley.  I first made this for my aunt and cousin (picky eaters) and they couldn't get enough.  She even asked for the recipe because there were no left overs.  I have made this several times for my husband (a true meat and potatoes man) and he loved it.  I am actually making it again tonight.  I have made fancier, more expensive, recipes, and after trying so many, this is it.

I've only eaten meatloaf 3 times in my lifetime, my mother in law's, my stepmother's, and last night this recipe. It was so good! I was hesitant to make it because I'm not big on ketchup or mustard but the glaze was delicious! The perfect amount on top to spread on the rest of the piece of loaf, and the loaf itself was so moist! Really a wonderful recipe. This is going to be a regular in our household and my husband couldn't be happier!

This was so easy and a family pleaser!!  I did make some adjustments to the recipe 1. Sauté 1 onion & 1 green bell pepper in butter before mixing with meat. 2. 2 eggs  3. 1 tbsp Worcestershire to meat mixture.  It was so moist and the sauce on top just as recipe said was sooooo good!  I did adjust the sauce  - 2/3 ketchup - 2 tbsp Dijonaise - 2 tbsp light brown sugar.   Thanks for sharing!

My family loves this meatloaf.  It is the only recipe I use now.  I soften the onions with a small amount of butter.  Double the topping (all except the mustard) and use Italian bread crumbs. So good!!

My hubby wanted to try meatloaf for the first time and I looked everywhere for recipes but since it was our first time trying it I just wanted a basic recipe nothing over the top and exotic. I tried the sautéed onion in butter, added Worcestershire sauce , milk,  seasoned bred crumbs, bell pepper and added BBQ sauce to the topping and added the topping sauce the last 20 mins. My hubby loved it! Even My little picky eaters gobbled it up as well. Thanks you for your review post I used a few ideas from a few of you...yum!

I love this recipe. It's very simple to prep and cook. I have made it exactly as listed and I loved it!

Tonight I was forced to try a hybrid based on ingredients in hand. I had a pound of Jimmy Deans "Italian" sausage I bought by mistake, I added that to a pound of ground chuck, I used sour cream rather than milk. It turned out like a Italian meatball loaf.... but it works!

All that's missing is a good garlic mashed potatoes side dish.

In the 27 years I've been married, I've never made a meatloaf that my family liked. They love this one! I made extra sauce and added a little bit of honey to it. Great job thank you

Family said best ever. With leftovers, sandwiches, didn't last long. Small change: I used 1 can tomato soup instead of 1/3 cup ketchup. And slathered another can of tomato soup over top before cooking. Moist and flavorful.

This is a winner! Easy to make and very, very tasty. A little different than what I'm used to for meatloaf, but in a good way!

Simple prep, tasty, and filling. My only critiques would be to lower to 1-1.5 tbsp brown sugar to cut back on the sweetness, and add a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.

I made this meatloaf tonight...for some reason my meat did not really "LOAF"..I formed it into a loaf shape & baked. Did everything EXACTLY as the recipe stated...yet when I went to cut into it...it just crumbled. It never formed or glued together....(If that makes sense)

This was very good, I used two lbs of meat and changed the recipe a little for more sauce,  I used a half of an onion instead of a whole one, also added bell peppers which made it taste even better. For the sauce I used a 1/4 cup brown sugar 2/3 cup ketchup and about two teaspoons of mustard powder.

This is a great basic meatloaf recipe that's even better the day after on sandwiches. I did what others did, as far as sauteing onions and added Worcestershire sauce. This is definitely one of the best meatloaf recipes I've found. Thank you for sharing!

This was the first meatloaf I've ever made, and it was AWESOME! I remember having meatloaf as a kid and not liking it much...I always remembered it being dry and/or blah. For some reason I recently got a craving for it and I made this recipe for my boyfriend and myself. We both loved it! So moist and flavorful! I made it with garlic red mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. The easiest and most delicious meal! As far as this recipe goes, I only had one pound of ground beef so I cut the milk and breadcrumbs down to 3/4 cup each, which worked great. For the sauce, I also added a big dash of Worcestershire sauce and Sricha for a slight spice. This is going in my regular rotation of favorite recipes!!!

I modified my recipe a little but used this one as my guide and the meatloaf turned out amazing. Things I did: 
Cut the milk in half and added 1/2 cup of goat cheese
Added some shredded carrots and celery to get some more vegetables in the diet
Added a squeeze of sriracha sauce to the the ketchup
Used Dijon mustard

Wonderful meatloaf! My only concern with the recipe was that it was not nearly cooked in one hour at 350. It took a good hour and a half.

This is really my basic meatloaf recipe although I have never added MILK!!! It really makes a difference. The meatloaf was surprisingly moist. Also, I had never added the mustard to the topping. It added another layer of flavor. I just added a squirt though. I will make my meatloaf like this from now on. Saved & Pinned!!!

I love to cook, although, I don't do it as often as I'd like because I do not know how. This meatloaf was easy to make, delicious, and it will be something I make again. I made this dish for my boyfriend and I. My boyfriend said it was the best dinner I ever made for him! This recipe gave me more confidence to try other recipes. I made the meatloaf with a little less onion than what the recipe calls for. I used about half of a yellow onion and it turned out perfect. I made mashed potatoes and cooked zucchini as sides for this dish and these sides were perfect for the meatloaf. Thank you.

Very tasteful! I substituted the milk for 1/4 cup BBQ sauce to mix into the meat, and I mixed BBQ sauce with Ketchup for the topping. Also this version was delicious. My family loved it, so I'll be making this again.

Very tasty - made it for a group of 30.  The recipe calls for WAY too much onion - we reduced it by over half of what was called for.  The topping is delicious and really adds to the flavor.  It was very easy to prepare and was a big hit.

Good easy recipe. I did change a few things. I sauteed the onions, added 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce to meat mixture, doubled the amount of the ketchup sauce, and cooked for an hour and thirty minutes.  I found that only cooking it for an hour made the meatloaf a little soggy. After it was done cooking i made another batch of the ketchup sauce, heated it on the stove for a minute or two, and poured it over the sliced pieces of meatloaf.  Without the extra sauce it was a little bland. Husband loved it so overall it was a success. Served it with mashed potatoes and corn!

Loved the taste of the mixture. I like my meatloaf a little more dry so anyone else who wants it dry add more crumbs and less milk. I also followed the suggestions to increase the mustard, ketchup, brown sugar topping. Delicious, can't wait to try this again.

Overall a good basic meatloaf recipe. I used seasoned breadcrumbs and added sautéed garlic but other than that I followed the rest of the directions to a T. I did make extra sauce but it turned out sweeter than I needed so next time I'll use less sugar.

This was really good, I also sautéed the onions in butter, a lot of people said to add Worcestershire sauce but I didn't have any so I improvised with a tablespoon of soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of steak sauce and a teaspoon of dijon mustard, also only used 1 tablespoon of brown sugar for the top, turned out delicious, I also only used 3/4 cups milk, it was tender, juicy and yummy, the man loved it and he is picky picky picky when it comes to meatloaf!! Will be making this again for sure :-)

Delicious, and easy! I use only 1-4 - 1/2 cup milk otherwise the meatloaf is too moist and has trouble cooking through.

I made this meatloaf last night for my family and we loved it!  I took the leftovers to work today and that was fantastic too!  Very easy to make!  Will make it again.

Used a bit of extra ground beef (had a pack of about 2.2 lbs) but this was simple and delicious.  We'll definitely have this again!

Easy meatloaf is great, here's what I did differently - added a shredded carrot, used Italian bread crumbs instead, I make a trough along the top and use BBQ sauce for the topping, add 3 strips of raw bacon across the too and 3 slices of white cheddar :)

I used half hamburger and half ground sausage. I also replaced the onion with a package of onion soup mix.  It turned out great.

I tried this last night. I have never made meatloaf ever. I skipped the mustard part, but followed the directions down to the T and it came out great. My kids loved it and there was no more left. 
Thanks for the recipe.

I am a kid under 30 who had to look up a recipe for meatloaf. My mom hates it so she never made it. Fiance is in the same boat as me, and we both love it, so this recipe has been made quite a few times. I rate it 3 stars for the recipe as written, as it is somewhat bland, but I have found that meatloaf is an art and this recipe is an excellent canvas

Not bad but very dense. I used Panko crumbs since I didn't have regular breadcrumbs, which may have made a difference. I didn't love the topping either.

Delicious! I used ground chuck and a mixture of Italian bread crumbs and garlic seasoned bread crumbs. I only used 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. Next time I'll bake for 1 hour and 15 mins. Hubby thought it was a little soft.

I made this. But I did change it a little. I used almost 2 pounds of meat. And I used two eggs. And I softened the onions first with oil and butter. And I used seasoned bread crumbs. It was very good. It is very filling, so you should not eat much at one time.

This was the best meatloaf! I did follow other reviewers advice and did the following:
-saute onion with a little butter
- used italian seasoned breadcrumbs
-double the ketchup and only slightly reduced the mustard. I also used coarse ground mustard
-add Worcestershire sauce

It was a huge hit, my boyfriend ate over half of the loaf in one sitting! It also made great left overs. I paired it with some corn bread muffins.

This recipe is so simple and delicous, nothing too complex and nothing too pricey, ingredients can be found in any supermarket. Some tips: -doubled on the ketchup sauce.  -be very careful about the brown sugar, be sure that there are no clumps.   -make the onions very tin, i didn't sauté them so i had huge clumps of tasteless onions when i first made it.

I am not exactly sure how others were able to successfully make this recipe. Yes, this is an easy recipe but it seems like 1 cup of milk is an incredible amount of liquid. I did my best to follow the recipe exactly but somehow I ended up with soup. We were unable to eat it. The meatloaf fell apart but not in a good way.

What an awesome recipe! So easy, but so good. I never even liked meatloaf before now, but this has sold me. Definitely will be something we make often in my house. The only suggestion I have would be to maybe add more ketchup. That would make the sauce a bit thicker (which it needed, in my opinion), and would make more of it (which is also needed, again, in my opinion). Also, the sides burned a bit. Not sure if I didn't grease the pan enough or what, but beware of that.

This recipe deserves 5 stars as is! Sure it can be altered to tastes and is pretty basic, but incredibly delicious.  I think the key thing is using a loaf pan because the juices all get trapped inside. 
Thank you for the great recipe!

I have tried many recipes for meatloaf and this is the first that my 9 year old daughter ate and enjoyed!! I also followed other pointers of using seasoned bread crumbs and sautéed the onions too. I didn't double the sauce, it is fairly strong (perfect match to the meatloaf though) and felt it didn't need the extra sauce.

I also added some Worcester sauce and garlic powder. I would recommend heating the oven to at least 400 because it took almost 2 hours to cook all the way through. And one whole onion is too much. I used half of one.

This is a great meatloaf recipe. I put lots of mushrooms and onions in mine and added a little Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke. I've never been a big fan of meatloaf. Now I make it once a week. Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe

Meatloaf was perfect for me and my family. I lessened the mustard and added chopped garlic and cilantro cube. Taste was great!

Kids loved it!-even the picky ones! I do use the seasoned bread crumbs and only use about 1/2 of a small onion. Other than that I just followed the recipe. Took slightly longer than an hour to cook...more like an extra 10-15 minutes. Delish!

Wayyyy too much milk.  A whole cup? I followed the recipe to a T, and it came out mushy and almost unrecognizable as real ground beef.  So far, I've had to put it back in the oven twice - the first time it was in the oven, uninterrupted for a full hour.  I do like the sauce on top, but right now Im baking it just to dry it out enough to make it edible.  And as for the salt & pepper to taste? I don't like to taste raw hamburger to get a feel for whether it's salty enough or not.  Maybe it would be helpful to start off with say, a teaspoon of each and then people can add more or less the next time they make it?

Very good. I have tried many meatloaf recipes but never moist enough. I used this recipe and sautéed the onion along with some of green pepper and mushrooms I needed to use up. Added a pinch of granulated garlic, onion powder and Worcestershire sauce and my family raved about it. I used the sauce recipe and added a tablespoon of medium hot wing sauce so it wasn't so sweet. I also used silicone muffin pans, put a indentation in the middle of each ball of meat so they don't swell up and it holds the sauce. Cooks in less time. I will use this recipe every time and just tweak it slightly.

I have to bake mine for 30 to 45 minutes longer, and at 400 degrees for the hamburger to cook all the way through. I also just use 1 lb of hamburger. Maybe it's because of my elevation? but other than the extra waiting, it's delicious.

I added a little Worcestershire sauce as well and i used flavored breadcrumbs.  Also, I mixed everything together and baked it for an hour, no sauce on top. It was delicious.

I have been looking for a good meatloaf recipe for some time. I was questioning about putting milk in a meatloaf, but I was wrong when I took the first bit. The meatloaf was very moist and tasty, my husband who really doesn't like meatloaf loved it. I will be making this again.

This was good.  My husband really liked it.  I'm not a huge meatloaf fan, but I did like it too.  I used Italian breadcrumbs.  I think it would be too bland without them.  The sauce on top was good too.

I made this recipe exactly how it says to make it. It was delicious! Only thing my hubby didn't care for the crunchy onion texture in it. I think next time I will sauté the onions before adding to the meat mixture! I also used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain bread crumbs.

I had to make a few changes due to allergies. It still was delicious! I had to omit the eggs, I used almond milk and oats. For the sauce, instead of brown sugar I used Agave. I put foil in the pan, so I was able to lift it right out and move it to a platter to rest,  and had all the juices it the foil to fold up and throw out. Easy clean up! All the substituting and it still was delicious. Served it with mashed potatoes, and roasted zucchini making it a true comfort meal.

Made this tonight!  I have tried at least 4 other recipes that I've felt were good (ones with bacon, ones with bacon & cheese, etc) but this one seemed more flavorful. I did follow others' small advice as well:  sauteeing onion(only had 1/2 of onion)& garlic (1 clove),and adding the worcestershire (1 1/2 T)!  I used the Italian bread crumbs, because that is what I had, I used dijon mustard and only 1 T of brown sugar.  We ate kind of late and my boyfriend said it was worth the wait!

Very good! I made this because I didn't have much in the house but I did have about 1 1/4lb of ground beef...so meatloaf it is.  Only changes I made was that I sautéed the onion with some garlic, I got that idea from Ina Garten. I really liked the topping so next time I think I'd double that. Some reviews said it was too sweet but I thought it complimented the meat nicely. I served it with mashed potatoes, of course. I'm looking forward to the leftovers tonight! This will probably become my go to recipe! Thanks!

Update: I make this recipe all the time. But recently tried it as meatloaf muffins, and it was great. Just placed the ingredients in a  muffin pan, to make individual servings. 450 degrees for 20 mins and Perfect.

I had never had meatloaf before in my entire life (I'm 22) but I had a lot of ground beef in the freezer. So I decided I would make meatloaf. I only cook for my boyfriend so it's imperative that he likes what I cook or else I feel bad. He has a very simple palate and I usually cook from recipes that are made for kids (he loves all of them) but this recipe looked simple enough for me to make and for him to eat.

This meatloaf was a success. I used italian style breadcrumbs and 2 eggs instead of 1, I'm also pretty sure I used 2 pounds of beef. Well since I had never made meatloaf before the timer started off with 1 1/2 hours. Now I know I had to cook it for probably 2 1/2 because I used more beef. It was a teensy bit raw so I popped it back in at a high temp (425) while some potatoes were cooking. I doubled the sauce but I bought spicy mustard and I thought the mustard was a bit too overpowering when I tasted the sauce, I poured it on anyway and crossed my fingers. The sauce tasted awesome cooked, I guess the heat brought out the sugar in the sauce. 

I took the advice some of the other reviewers made and put in about 1 1/2 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce. Plenty of salt and paper. I didn't saute the onions but I think that was the right move because they were kinda crunchy and brought a lot of flavor to the meatloaf. My boyfriend whom is not a fan of onions didn't mention the fact that there were onions in there! He absolutely loved the meatloaf and the sauce on top of it.

This recipe is great! I accidentally put the mustard, brown sugar, and ketchup in the meatloaf the first time. It was so good that I still put those ingredients in the meatloaf, as well as, the topping. My mother begs me to make this meatloaf when she is at my house. My husband also loves it!!

Good as-is, and has all the parts of a standard meatloaf recipe so it's easy to customize. I used 1lb of ground turkey and 1/2lb ground beef, and only half an onion (1 cup) because it was large. I sauteed the onion (until translucent) with 6 thick-cut slices of bacon which I had diced (about 6oz) and 2 tsp of minced garlic. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and 1/2 tsp each salt and pepper, and added 1/4 tsp each onion powder and granulated garlic. I reduced the milk considerably (to 1/3 cup) and made the sauce with 1/2 cup ketchup, 3 tbsp yellow mustard and 2 tbsp brown sugar. I shaped the meat into two small loaves, topped them with 2/3 of the sauce, and baked 1 hour, adding the remaining sauce after 45 minutes.

Fantastic! I also added Worcestershire sauce, sauteed the onions (in butter with some balsamic vinegar), used less brown sugar for the sauce, doubled the sauce, and made my own bread crumbs since I didn't have any store-bought on hand. It came out moist and delicious! Best meatloaf I've ever had!

Good basic recipe, easy to tweak to your own tastes.  I added a second egg to the mixture, along with a clove of garlic and a dash of worchestershire sauce.  As some have suggested, I sautéed the onion first.  I also substituted a little salsa for part of the ketchup, cut back on the mustard, and added a dash of worchestershire sauce. Served with mashed potatoes:  comfort food at its best!

Overall, not too happy with this recipe. I've been waiting two and a half hours now for the thing to cook; much more than the 1 hour cook time. I haven't had similar problems cooking any other dish, and simply find the prep/cook time to be very misleading. It seems to me this is less of an easy meatloaf, and just a time-consuming brick.

My family can not get enough of this recipe! I make this probably every other week.  The only things I do differently is, I use 2 lbs of beef, since we buy beef in bulk and it comes in 1 lb packages.  But, that is one of the reasons I love all-recipes, you can adjust the number of servings, and it will adjust all the other ingrediants for you, however, in this case, you can't do 1/25 eggs, so I use on egg and one egg white.  
I also put the loaf into my pampered chef 4 mini loaf stone.  Doing this gives me a lot more surface area to put the topping on, so I double the topping ingredients and slather it on....some people commented about not liking the topping....for our family, that is what makes this recipe so great!  Everyone we make this for requests the recipe...so it is a hit with others as well.

A family favorite!! I have made this several times now and my husband and kiddos still ask for it all the time! The best meatloaf and so easy to make! I do use seasoned breadcrumbs and I only add a pinch(sometimes none) of the brown sugar for the topping. As with any recipe I don't follow it to a "T" I add breadcrumbs accordingly I start with a little and if the meat seems to wet I add more 1 egg and a splash of milk!

I made this and it was so delicious. My husband loved it and that's saying something. The only things I changed was I cut the ketchup in half and used A1 sauce since my husband can't have ketchup. I also didn't use mustard.I used italian bread crumbs instead of bread crumbs. I seemed to need more of the italian bread crumbs.  This is the first time I have made this! Soo yummy!

I expected more, based on the reviews. I made a double batch of this, and added Worcestershire sauce to one of them. It wasn't anything special, but perhaps with some tweaking, it would be pretty good. I did use seasoned bread crumbs. I think if I make this again, I would cut back 1/4-1/2 cup of the breadcrumbs and the milk. It almost gave it a bit of a mushy texture; not firm like meat. If you like it like that, fine; but if you like a firmer consistency, I would lighten those 2 things up. I will also add some seasonings next time, and I think with those few changes, it would be a lot better. Good starting base though. Oh, and the sauce basically just tastes like what you would imagine ketchup and mustard and sugar would taste like mixed together. Not horrible, but nothing special.
2nd time- doubled the batch, except for the crumbs and milk; kept those at 1c each. Added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 1.5 tsp italian seasoning, and 2 good teaspoons of minced garlic. Also takes about 1hr 20-30 min to cook, 2 loaf pans for double batch. Flavor was better this time, texture wasn't mushy, but, it wasn't firm like meatloaf, it fell apart when slicing, but tasted great.When I took it out of the oven, there was liquid about 3/4 way up pan,so I'm glad I didn't double the milk! On 3rd try, I may add more crumbs, or cook a bit longer just for firmness. Taste was much better 2nd time than 1st. also ommited wor.sauce this time.

GREAT MEATLOAF! I added a little Worcestershire Sauce and used 2 eggs instead of one. My husband went on and on about how good it was. I definitely recommend this recipe if you're looking to make a yummy meatloaf.

Very juicy and pretty tasty. My boyfriend said it was the best I've made for him yet. My daughter liked it too. I will however use less mustered next time it was a bit too much for my liking. I did sauté the onions  first until somewhat clear with a little garlic then added a little red bell pepper...followed the rest of the recipe.

This was really good. My mom rest her soul used to make my favorite meatloaf, but I never watched her make it (mad at myself).  I have been craving it lately. Went to a diner and had it, but it just wasn't the same. So thankful that I found this recipe. Full disclosure, I always read the reviews, so I changed some things based on those, as well as what I had on hand. I made this tonight and it was so yummy! I used ground turkey and for some reason, I didn't expect there to be as much grease as there was, but I read that bread on the bottom of the pan will sop it up. I used only a 1/2 cup of milk and mixed Italian bread crumbs with panko. Next time I will try oatmeal (was all out). I seasoned with pepper, italian herbs, garlic, paprika, and kosher salt. I mistakenly added kosher salt thinking it was panko (mixed up the boxes), but thank God it didn't mess up the meat. I didn't have steak sauce or Worcestershire sauce, so I used chili sauce instead. Will DEFINITELY stick with that. I also added some carrot and green pepper and will add red pepper next time. I like the idea of adding veggies. I also topped it with Sweet Baby Ray bbq sauce. I originally baked it for one hour, but didn't feel it was done, so I did another 20 minutes, and then an addition 10. So delish! My dad had seconds first and my 6 yr old nephew (who barely eats) had seconds. Thank you for this recipe and all of the reviewers who experimented with it. It's a keeper!

Delicious! I cut out the onions since they don't agree with my husband's stomach. I'm sure the onions would have made it more flavorful, but it was still very good and so moist.

I made it exactly like the recipe told me to. I wish I hadn't. Maybe this meatloaf would be good with the alterations all these reviewers seemed to make. I would only use 1/2 an onion (I might as well have just eaten a raw onion and called it my dinner.) and twice as much ketchup. It was very moist, which is good in a meatloaf usually. But not THAT moist. It was very fatty but maybe that was just the hamburger I used. I will try this again sometime with much less onion and see how it turns out.

I sauteed the onions with a little garlic and diced bell pepper (had a pepper to use that I didn't want to spoil) before adding to the ground beef.  I was out of seasoned bread crumbs, so I added a couple dashes of Itialian seasoning and used oatmeal.  I thought the amount of milk might make the meatloaf mushy but the oats absorbed the liquid well and it came out very moist but definately not mushy.  This is an EASY recipe as the title implies and is very good as well as versatile from the slight changes I made.  I might decrease the amount of brown sugar next time as I thought it was a little sweet.  I will make this recipe part of my monthly recipe rotation.

Super good and easy to prepare. I would use less milk and season the meat a little more. I also added a red bell pepper and steak seasoning. Looked at everyone's reviews and will try it in some form or another. Great dinner!

okay i am rating this a 5 but that is only without the sauce on top i made this for my boyfriend and his father for dinner and here is what i did. 1. added 2 tbs of Worcestershire sauce. also when i browned the onions i did it in 1 tbsp of butter and added the salt and pepper to those and put in a little garlic to taste. and then added that to the meat mixture. for a little flare and something different i minced some mushroom and added that. after all was said and done i have literally made this 3 nights in a row and have only gotten 2 pieces. but i do warn you do not use the sauce on it not tasty. if you like ketchup add it to your plate after.

Delicious!! Easy recipe that is a crowd pleaser! Followed the recipe with the following additions: 1. As suggested, chopped onion and some garlic cloves were sautéed first 2. I made extra sauce, just eyeballed more ketchup and a 1/3 more brown sugar plus spices. 3. Added shredded carrots and shredded zucchini to sneak in more veggies. 4.  Used the "as seen on TV perfect meatloaf pan", it cooked evenly and the excess fat accumulated on the bottom while the meat cooked on a rack on top. Very moist and delicious!!!

Whole family loved it, including my 2 1/2 year old whom had seconds. I omitted the onion, used hot honey mustard and almond milk. Made a second batch to freeze.

Quick and simple! Took the advice from other reviews about adding worcestershire sauce and sautéing the onion in butter and garlic.  Those two changes adding lots of flavor to the meatloaf!

Very yummy but ours came out a little mushy. Had to put it back in the oven for another 20 mins and it still wasn't completely solid. I think if we had a loaf pan it would have been perfect. We just used a Pyrex baking dish cause that all we had. Either way... Super easy to make and yummy!

Wow! This was moist and delicious!  I added a half can of tomato paste that I had to use up,about 2 T of worchestshire sauce, and a healthy splash of heavy cream instead of the cup of milk.  Even though it was moist it held its shape nicely when sliced. My husband and I both enjoyed the sweet tart sauce. Yum! Thank you!

I made this recipe last night and I have mixed reviews. The meatloaf itself was wonderful(based on other reviews I added 2 Tbsp of Worcestershire Sauce & that made it yummy). I also doubled the sauce because I like a substantial tomato sauce on top. Doubling gave the perfect amount of sauce. What I didn't like was the brown sugar (and I ADORE anything with Brown Sugar in it). And I actually HALVED the amount of sugar and STILL FOUND IT TOO SWEET for my taste. I would simply use Tomato Paste next time I make this...and I definitely will make this again. I used a loaf pan and ended up cooking this for 85 mins.

I don't care for the addition of milk to a meatloaf recipe. Made a million other meatloafs and this wasn't very good and I followed the recipe exactly. More like meat mush.

This is pretty much the exact recipe Ive followed my entire adult life. I do add hot pepper flakes because I do like it spicy. And I make mini loafs out of the meat mix. And the leftovers are aces for meatload sandwiches. Yum!

An excellent and easy recipe. My boyfriend made this for Christmas dinner. Everyone said it was the best meatloaf they had ever had! We followed suggestions from some of the other reviews for the sauce (reducing mustard, brown sugar and adding Worcestershire). I also added 1/8 t. onion powder and 1/8 t. ground mustard per batch of sauce.

Made meatloaf for my family this weekend. Easy and Awesome.   I used Big Rick's Chipotle Ketchup. It was amazing.  It gave the meatloaf a little kick.  Give it a try at www.bigricks.com.

This recipe is a keeper!  I did make a few modifications, as others recommended: I doubled the sauce (it was my favorite part), sautéed the onions in butter and garlic powder, and I added Worcestershire sauce.  I also used 3/4 lb. beef and 3/4 lb. pork and baked it in a muffin pan instead of a loaf pan at 350 degrees for 35 min.  Delicious!  Thanks so much Janet.

very good recipe!  The family loved it.  I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the mix and I had an old red pepper that I chopped up (big chunks)and it really came out well.  Made mashed potatoes and gravy - from an envelope  - really great!  Try it!

Delicious.  This was a hit with the kids and adults, although I might make a separate, smaller loaf for the kids with less mustard.  I altered the recipe a bit by using whole wheat seasoned breadcrumbs (4C brand) and sauteed the onions in olive oil.  Very moist and savory.

I used beef, veal, pork mix and it was amazing and very moist. I did not brown the onions first because my husband loves onion and he loved this. I did add a dash of worshestire, but that's  all I changed. Thanks!! I cook often but had never made meatloaf before!

Super easy and delicious.   I baked mine a little longer than recommended.  
Mad wine modification, added BBQ sauce instead of the brown sugar.   Just a family preference but this meatloaf is a huge hit at our house everytime!!

This was very tasty. It is simple as the name implies. It gets a four because it is not "over the top" delicious. I increased the portions which of course increases the ingredients. I could have held back on some of the onion. I would definitely make it again.

I made this and added finely chopped celery.  About 1/4 cup.  This turned out to be excellent receipe.  Will print and put in my receipe box.  Very easy and delicious !!

This was my first time making meatloaf and it was excellent! I didn't add milk (lactose intolerant) or bread crumbs (I forgot) but it still turned out well. Very moist and full of flavor. Thanks for this easy recipe to start from!

Excellent meat loaf! The sauce is what makes it good. I added a little Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture, maybe a tbs. to give it a little more kick.

This was a very easy recipe but not as flavorful as I would have liked. I think next time I'll cut out the onion and add a packet of onion soap mix. The topping too was a little sweet for our family's taste so I'll forgo that next time as well. Overall this is a great one for first timers like me. I'm thinking about how to alter it to fit my family and thinking about cooking at all is a monumental step in the right direction!

This was really good. I made it based on other reviews. Added a little worcestershire sauce, sauteed onions and a clove of garlic, also used a little less mustard in sauce. Next time I will use a little less milk, and a little less brown sugar in sauce, thought is was a little too sweet. Overall good recipe!

Ok I'm writing this review as I eat dinner & I'm not in love. I had everything I needed & the recipe was really easy to follow. I even sauteed the onions & garlic in butter. It smelled good as it was cooking. I had to cook it for 2 hours & it still came out too soft and mushy. The sauce on top was amazing which is why I gave it 3 stars. But I will stick to my own recipe & just add the sauce.

My husband loves this recipe over all the others I've made. I didn't add or change anything. On the plus side it can be cooked in a microwave safe dish for 12-15 mins on 50% power depending on the size of your loaf. I make it that way every time and it turns out fine.

Quick and easy to make.  My family thought the texture was a little mushy.  Think I will reduce the milk next time and add the worchestershire sauce someone else mentioned.

I don't know if it's me being pregnant but I wasn't a fan of this recipe... My first time making a meatloaf and I was happy how it finished. I used somewhat of the same recipe, but I added mushrooms, cut onion and garlic in the mixture. It gave more taste, spiced it up and gave it a little twist! I even cut down the brown sugar to 1tbs instead of 2tbs. 
Looked perfect, sauce was amazing and the mix was delicious. I'm just sad that I didn't leave it in another 5 or maybe 10 minutes, it was to moist for me. Although my fiance thinks it was amazing and flawless! He thinks it deserves a 4/5.

I just mixed this together with the following substitutions: 3lb ground beef , 1T Italian seasoning, 1t thyme, 1T dried onion , 1T Duck Dynasty Cajun seasoning,plus more sprinkled on top, 1t.onion powder, 1t chives, I used 2 eggs,mixed with about 2/3 C milk, and 1C bread crumb,plain, as I didn't have seasoned. For the sauce/glaze I used 1/2 c ketchup,1/2 c grape jelly,2T white sugar, 1/4 cup Italian dressing,2T steak sauce. ( it all sounds gross, but boil it down until it is thick, and top the meatloaf with it at the last twenty mins of baking.) Trust me, everyone I have ever made this for goes nuts for it, and begs for my secret recipe. I usually make cocktail meatballs with this glaze, and people come at me with marriage proposals, gifts, bribes, etc. I can't tell you how my meatloaf turned out, as it is baking now.......will update later....

This s my second time I made meatloaf and my husband loved it.  He had two servings each plate setting :) thank you for sharing.
**Update**- its been awhile since I made this meatloaf recipe and hubby ??D it. I added garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, and for the glaze I did not have brown sugar on hand, so I used honey and sweet and spicy mustard. I made mashed potatoes as a side dish. Looking forward to leftovers. ??**

Super good, we make it a lot! sautee the onions in a frying pan with a bit of butter or evoo 1st then add. I found there is enough topping but I use our fav BBQ sauce instead of the ketchup to switch it up. It slices nicely and doesn't fall apart.

This was amazing and pretty easy to make. I would sauté the onion and add in some garlic in the future, but otherwise a really great recipe for meatloaf!

I really liked it but it turned out kind of mushy, needs to be cooked a little longer than an hour, maybe ten minutes or so.

I used this recipe and added 2 tablespoons of sofrito for latin carribean flavor, with carrots and sweet peas and my family loved it. Will use this recipe again for Thanksgiving.

Great tasting meatloaf. I didn't have any dried breadcrumbs so I used cracker-crumbs. It was a bit on the dry side but very enjoyable with a side on fried rice.

I doubled the sauce, added the Worcester sauce and sautéed the onions.  It came out a bit soggy...maybe I will add less milk next time?

The mustardy mixture for the top was overpowering. I like mustard but this ruined it.I may try it again but use less mustard or find a recipe for a better sauce to put on top.

I like how it was so basic and everyone could put their own touch on it. The main change I made was less sugar by volume on the sauce and I added pickle juice with a dash of cayenne for a surprise bite. The cajun in me demanded it!

I made this exactly like the recipe states except added a little worchestshire sauce.. and instead of onions I use onion powder since my husband does not like onions but he likes the flavor doesn't make much sense but that's how it is. and I only use a pound of hamburger but I used all the same ingredient I did DD sauce recipe which actually made a little much for only one pound of hamburger however it turned out great. I did let it set 10 minutes before I cut it and it cut just perfect!

Too greasy in my opinion. The flavor was decent, but I think the dried onion soup made it too salty.

We absolutely loved this recipe. I followed the recipe but for some reason when I sliced it, it fell apart. What did I do wrong? I used 80/20 ground beef.  I did not tweak it.    Sparis43

Seemed juicy around the outside even with 93% hamburger;  interesting topping with the mustard; doubled the topping;  would be curious to try it with seasoned bread crumbs;  added 1 tbsp. worchestershire; kids said they liked it (Nicholas said it like it better than moms recipe)

I made this recipe for the first time for a dinner I had with my in-laws and I was so embarrassed. After following the recipe exactly, this did not turn out. I had high hopes because of the high rating, it was simple to make, it looked great, smelled great but we did not care for the flavor. You couldn't taste the meat at all. My suggestion would be to cut down on the breadcrumbs and milk or eliminate them altogether. My husband asked me not to make it again and stick to the way I've been making it. I learned my lesson, I won't make a new recipe for company without trying it first!

This was so good. The whole family loved it. Made some substitutions: no milk, gluten free crackers instead of bread, stone ground mustard and low sugar/organic ketchup.

First time making a meatloaf, this is the perfect recipe! I added some italian seasoning, garlic powder and chilli powder in addition to the salt and pepper! I also only used one tbsp of brown sugar in the sauce to cut down on the sweetness. Loved it! Will definitely make again!

My best advice...use VERY lean ground beef or a mixture of beef and turkey.  I think mine was 80/20 (I usually brown and drain in most of my cooking).  It was incredibly greasy.  The flavor was there...I browned onions first and decreased the brown sugar on top.  I added oregano to meat mixture but I feel like some fresh parsley or basil would have kicked it up a notch.

I rushed this and put all the ingredients into beef! But it was the best meatloaf I ever had! It was on the sweeter side however, as I also made the topping (with less mustard). Would do again, and perhaps split the topping ingredients as half in beef and other half on top.

At 59 years old, I've probably made 100s of meatloaves.  To me this is a great basic recipe.  It is very good, as is, or one could spice it up to their personal taste.  I cut the onions small enough that they were thoroughly cooked within the loaf. The overall flavor, moisture and texture was to my liking.  Next time I make a meatloaf I'll use this recipe and if I want it to have a differnent "flair" I'll add herbs/spices/other ingredients accordingly.

Great recipe! These were the changes I made to it:
1. Only used 1/2 an onion and I sautéed it before adding to the burger mixture
2. Used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs
3. Added 1 Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce to meat mixture
4. Added 1 tsp. of both salt and pepper to meat mixture
5. Used 1/2 cup ketchup and 1 Tbsp of mustard for topping
6. Make sure meat mixture is pushed down well in loaf pan
7. Cook for 60-65 minutes or until edges start to brown

ENJOY!!!

Perfect. A wonderful base for a meatloaf or you can cook it just as is.  I am a green pepper fiend, so they go into most everything for me, this included.

I didn't have enough breadcrumbs but I threw in some quick-cooking oatmeal (had about 2/3 cup breadcrumbs, added 1/3 oatmeal to finish the 1 cup that the recipe called for) and it worked! I followed other suggestions and added Worcestershire sauce, doubled the sauce and used less mustard -- I think the sauce came out great. I would use this recipe again for easy but tasty meatloaf! Better than my mom's ;)

I used 2 pounds of ground deer meat with 2 tablespoons of garlic and it turned out great.  I also didn't add the brown sugar to make it that much healthier and swapped the bread crumbs for a leftover hamburger bun and oats lying around.
I had to make it fast, so spread it out in a 12x12" pan and cooked it for 45 minutes.  I definitely should have browned the onions first, but it was otherwise fully-cooked and a huge hit

Amazing recipe.  It was so delicious and moist.  I will defiantly make this again.  The only thing I changed was I reduced the amt of milk and added Worcestershire sauce and garlic to the mixture.  On top I mixed only Worcestershire sauce and ketchup.

Pretty good. Mine came out a bit mushy so next time I won't add as much liquid, but it's a recipe with great potential.

I feel the meatloaf turned out good, it just didn't have the flavor that I am use to. Way too bland.

Modified recipe as follows:  added 1 tablespoon Worcestershire-sauce, sautéed onion and add garlic, added 1/2 of a large green pepper diced, 
added 1/2 a carrot shaved, added parsley, 
added one slice of whole grain bread broken up, 
used italian seasoned breadcrumbs, cooked in glass baking dish greased with butter (no need to foil line), and let set before serving.  It was delicious!

I sauteed the onions ahead of time and decreased the amount of brown sugar by half, like others suggested.  It was good but I found the end product a little mushy.  Next time I will decrease the milk and breadcrumbs a bit.

I added 1 clove of garlic and saute'd them with the onions, one toasted bread slice in pieces, worchester sauce and italian seasoned breadcrumbs.

I put in a bowl the milk and the bread crumbs and let it sit while I cooked the onion and garlic so it would absorb and be less soupy.

overhaul, we loved it and my family is fighting over leftovers for their work lunches.lol

I made this recipe with some changes/additions. Used garlic with the beef as mentioned, added 1/2 the breading was Panko and the other 1/2 was regular. This added some texture. Then I doubled the recipe so 1 loaf had Baby Ray's and the other had the recipe's. Liked the recipe's sauce better. It was really moist and very tasty.

This recipe is delicious!! I followed everyone suggestions and also added a half block of pepper jack cheese to middle of loaf before baking.   needless to say it was a huge hit in our household and I will most definitely be making this recipe again in the future! :)

Delicious!! I followed of other reviewers doubling the ketchup topping as well as sautéing the garlic and onion. I actually only cook with ground turkey which I season with Goya perfect seasoning and a little pepper. My husband cleaned his plate while giving kudos. But the clincher is my picky daughter loved it as well!!!

I ended up having to use some sourdough bread we had to make the bread crumbs. We also down sized the recipe a bit. I was surprised how good this recipe was and how well it came out. I will be adding it to my list of things to make again. It was sooooooooo good. My husband loved it.

This is a great meatloaf recipe especially for those who aren't big meatloaf fans! I grated the onion but maybe next time I'll sauté it like some of the suggestions here.  To me this is how meatloaf is suppose to taste.

I made this for dinner last night and followed it exactly as is, and it was delicious. Moist,and surprisingly flavorful for so few simple ingredients. I put a medium sized onion in my food processor before adding to the mixture and it looks like way too many onions, but it's not. When it's done it's just right. Love this easy (and cheap) recipe and will make again for sure. Thanks for sharing!

Really liked this recipe, except the sauce was way too sweet! Both my husband and I had the same reaction to sauce. Second time, I didnt use brown sugar at all and instead added 1 tbsp soy sauce (to both meat and sauce). This greatly improved the recipe! Also, followed the advice of other reviews and sauteed onions first with garlic & butter, used seasoned bread crumbs, and doubled the sauce recipe - all worked great! Meat comes out really juicy and tender, which I really liked!

Good flavour, a hit with my family.  One recipe of sauce was enough, as we serve ours with gravy.  Hints such as adding Worcestershire sauce and sautéing the onions are good ideas.  Very fast and easy to make.

I had (and lost) this recipe from a number of years back, the only variation you might want to do is to add a 1/2 tsp of sage to the milk and eggs and onion before mixing into the meat.  Cook for an hour, drain the goop, put the topping on then let it cook for another ten minutes or so.  I have also used 1 tsp of dry mustard instead of prepared as well.  Great as is or with my variation

I made this recipe last night and it was easy and wonderful.  I didn't have any milk so I used 1/2 a can of cream of mushroom soup. It was delicious and moist.  I didn't think I would like the sauce, but I tried it and it was wonderful. I'll definitely make this dish again!!!!

This was the worst meatloaf I've ever had (even w the 2T brown sugar).it had no flavor and crumbly texture.  I used it because I didn't have any pork sausage in the house and wanted an all beef loaf.  I'm going back to my recipe with my Bob Evans pork sausage in it.

this was decent, but not so great as the rave reviews. the sauce is quite sweet and there wasn't a lot of flavor in the meat itself. Next time I'll try something less generic and bland.

Came out great, thanks. I used 94% turkey and like one reviewer suggested, some worcestershire sauce. I put 1 tsp in the sauce too. I also cut the sauce in half and that was plenty to glaze the loaf.

This is an outstanding recipe. Before making it I had never eaten meatloaf I enjoyed before, let alone tried making it myself. What a success! I sauteed the onions before adding them, and made the recipe gluten-free by using gluten-free breadcrumbs instead. I also added double-smoked bacon pieces and diced apple, both of which added some phenomenal flavour. The topping mixture was amazingly tasty; I was somewhat leery because I don't like ketchup, but everything combined into a great dish. Served it with mashed potatoes and roasted veggies. Will definitely be making this one again!

I have never made a meatloaf before so I decided to try this recipe. I got rave reviews with the recipe as is. The second time I sauteed the onions first and added some Worcestershire sauce and some additional spices and carrots and it still came out divine. Thank you for giving a great base recipe that I am continuously asked to make.

This recipe was easy and yummy. It was great as it was lovely and moist with a yummy sauce, but would be easy to use as a base for your own recipe. Absolutely fail proof.

Great meatloaf I subbed potato flakes for the breadcrumbs b/c I don't eat flour, and added a little cayenne to the sauce. I also made two smaller meat loaves so I could cook it on the grill, less fat no pan!

First time ever making meatloaf and I used turkey meat. Followed the direction almost to the T, no breadcrumbs, and it came out GREAT. My only problem was cutting my onions a little smaller.

This recipe was delicious!!  We don't eat red meat, so i used ground turkey breast, which usually comes out DRY,  but this was so moist and delicious!! That is the only change i made &   I will never go back to my old recipe :0)

This is so similar to what I make, with the exception that I seldom add bread.  Instead I add dry Mrs. Grass dry chicken soup (with only half the pkgd spice inside)and I can't remember but if it has a capsule inside, I generally poke it and add half to hamburg mix.  If too runny, then I had a few crumbled soda crackers.  
Sometimes I bake extra in cupcake pans and after cooled I freeze them in freezer bags for future use.

My family loved this meatloaf! My 3 year old is very picky. He skips dinner most of the time, however, he ate an entire piece of this meatloaf!! If he doesn't like something, he simply won't eat it, and he ate all of his piece!! My husband even said it was delicious, and was hesitant because of the brown sugar! I did not read the reviews before I made it, due to the lack of time, but I did change the recipe a little, similar to the others. 1) I added seasoned bread crumbs (we only use seasoned bread crumbs) 2) I did not have an onion so I added garlic powder, onion powder, season salt, and some other seasonings that we use often. 3) I added Worcestershire sauce. I don't measure, I just add about a tablespoon, maybe two. 5) I buy packaged meat from the meat market in 1 pound packages, so I used 2 pounds of meat, instead of 1 1/2. 6) I also added ketchup & mustard to the meat. I thought the topping was perfectly fine, I think it would have been too sweet if I doubled it..DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!

Hands down, best meatloaf I have ever had!  Sauteed garlic and onions in butter as other reviewers suggested, and added worcestershire sauce.  Added grated carrots, and Franks Red Hot for a little kick!

made exactly as written.  It was horrible.  Bland to the point of tasteless.  A very weird mush texture.  I think it was all that milk.  Oh, and it took an hour and a half to be thoroughly done.

I made this wanting a very easy meatloaf to make, this was wonderful! Very moist and tasty. I did take advice of others to saute the onions, add worchestshire sauce & seasoned bread crumbs.  Did not make the sauce for the top.  It still was very good!

It didn't have quite as much flavour as I had hoped, and was rather greasy (I even used lean ground beef), but otherwise, a splendid dish. The topping with ketchup and brown sugar was good as well, though some don't seem to like it. I found it had the perfect amount of sweetness to offset the beef flavour. It could definitely use a little more spices. I would suggest garlic powder, more pepper, and maybe even some good herbs.

I made it just as directed but adjusted it because I had 2 1/2 lbs of meat (oh and I used turkey) It made 2 loaves. Easy, good weeknight meal. My husband and I both enjoyed it. Will make great sandwiches and great leftovers. Too bad my 4 and 6 year old wouldn't eat it. Oh, well...will definitely make again.

Love this meatloaf! My family really liked it as well. I haven't ever made meatloaf with a brown sugar and mustard topping, but mixed together with the ketchup, it is excellent. The topping forms a slightly crisp, sweet topping that is unusual, but very good. I've made it twice this summer and until I see a better looking recipe, this is my new go-to meatloaf recipe!

very good!  I added a half of a can of tomato paste to the meatloaf and worcestershire  sauce plus a little vinegar (sweet and sour) to the sauce and it was unbelieveable.  I have to make extra sauce now since that is the favorite part of it for my family.  I did thicken with a little corn starch.

I just seasoned mine a little more and used a very small onion and made more topping than was called for. The recipe was good & simple. The only reason I gave it 3 stars ? Cuz I had to tweak what went in the meat and the topping. Its an awesome recipe for the beginner cook for sure !! :)

I am not fond of toppings on meatloaf, so I skipped the glaze. But to add some flavour I add 3 tbsp. of steak spice to the meatloaf mix to give it a bit of impact. Used oatmeal filler, and beef\pork\veal mixture - 1/3 each. Added garlic powder and lots of onion and a bit of sage. Stays moist but stays together when sliced. Partner used a tomato sauce on his. On the whole, a good meatloaf, tender and more flavourful with the pork and veal added.

I didn't have an onion so added a package of Lipton Instant Onion soup and 4 chopped slices of  bacon!  Didn't have ketchup, so I added tomatoes fresh from the garden.  Delicious!

This was the first recipe that I tried for meatloaf, abs ended up being the only one I needed. My husband loves it. Even my right year old daughter who said that she doesn't like meatloaf ended up going for seconds and doesn't eat anyone else's. Great recipe!!!

I have made this a few times now, following other reviewers suggestions as to adding Worcestershire sauce & a little less mustard for the sauce.  Don't usually sauté the onions, just cut them up finely. I also mix in a can of sliced mushrooms & will use some of the mushroom liquid instead of all the milk.  Sorry for reviewing a recipe while changing things up but just wanted to mention how good the added mushrooms make this meatloaf.  Both my husband & I really enjoy this, it's comfort food for sure.

I've made meatloaf this way all my life.  The only difference is I use dry mustard, tomato sauce, and brown sugar for the topping.

This is the way my grandma made meatloaf and it is delicious just as is. I sometimes use a small amount of dried onion instead of fresh.

I've made this recipe for many, many years and love it. When my kids were little, they didn't like the little pieces of onion in it, and I didn't either, so I'd put the onion into my blender, along with the milk, and emulsify it. A pinch of nutmeg in the topping is good, too.

I have tried many different meatloaf recipes, and this one has become my go-to. It's moist, flavorful, easy, & delicious. I like it because you can leave the milk/breadcrumb mixture the same and add or subtract other ingredients if you like. I don't add as many onions when cooking for my daughter or will substitute some minced onion instead. I also season the meat with garlic powder and Worcestershire. For the topping, I double the sauce and decrease the mustard by half as to make it less like a hamburger taste.  I also shape into mini loaves so there's more sauce for meat. YUMMMMMMM

This is how I make mine pretty much except I add bell pepper, I've never added milk before until my daughter suggested it.  To the ketchup mixture I add about a 1/4 cup of dark soda, along with a splash of soy sauce.  I always use the splenda brown sugar.  I suppose in a nutshell it's the same thing only different.

I got this same recipe out of one of my mom's old cookbooks years ago. It's so easy yet so delicious. It's very versatile. I have replaced the breadcrumbs with oatmeal before and even left out the onions (i have a picky eater) and it still tasted yummy. Make this for your family. They'll love you for it. :)

I think this is an excellent base for a meatloaf. Before making this, I had never made meatloaf before and this was very easy. In the future I would probably add more to it for some extra flavor (such as peppers).

I have been using a recipe similar to this for years instead of breadcrumbs I use 3 slices of bread brocken up and 1 carrot grated. I also use a muffing tin and put sauce on individually cuts the cooking time down to! Great with mashed potatoes

This meatloaf was moist and tasty. I incorporated suggestions from other reviewers and used seasoned bread crumbs, sauteed the onion in some olive oil, added a chopped green pepper, and cut the brown sugar in the topping. I was going to add Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture, but forgot :)   I will definitely make this again, and won't forget the Worcestershire next time!

I  am wondering, to you,what is to taste?  How much salt and pepper do you use?  I've made this a few dozen times, but due to either too much or not enough, it doesn't one out great.  Thank you!

This was my first time making meatloaf but I decided to modify the recipe some as others suggested. 

1) I used bison ground instead of beef and I used 2 lbs instead of 1.5 bc it comes in 1 lb packages. I just used a little more breadcrumbs. 

2) added Worcestershire , smoked paprika and oregano to meat mixture. 

3) doubled the sauce recipe

The only thing I would change is to not use a bread pan but make a loaf in a cooking sheet. The fat that cooked off just stayed in the bottom of the pan and it was a little greasy.  Kept it juicy mind you but a little too much grease.

First time i made this i did it exactly as stated but now for the 5th time i think i have my personal preferences ironed out.  I love onion so i use 1 1/2 onion sauteed with minced garlic in butter until softened.  I also add 1 tbs of Worcestershire sauce to the meat.  The sauce is a bit too sweet for my tastes so i only use 1 tbs of brown sugar just a splash of water to make it easier to pour and also a dash of more Worcestershire sauce along with the mustard and ketchup.  I then put a layer of meat, half the sauce mixture, another layer of meat then the rest of the sauce.  This keeps it extra moist. :)

I have made this countless times and love it!  I use a meatloaf mix from my market that has bell pepper, seasoning and some onion in the ground beef.  In a medium bowl I beat the egg and stir in the seasoned bread crumbs and milk and add a package of beefy onion from Lipton or Mrs. Grass.  I mix that all up and add the meat and mix it together and then add the worcestershire sauce and form in a pyrex dish.  For the topping I do what is stated but add a few squirts of sriracha to give it a little kick.  SO GOOD!!!

This recipe was perfect AS IS. I didn't have dry breadcrumbs so I used a few pieces of stale bread and crumbled them in the food processor. This meatloaf turned out fantastic, moist, and delicious! My husband and I both ate every bite.

Soooo mouth watering!! Just the right amount of sweetness. Never put milk in meat loaf. I think it added a nice texture. The only mistake I made was I think I used too much meat, more than a pounds and a half so I needed 2 eggs instead of 1. Other than that...AMAZING!!! I'm making meat loaf like thus from now on :-)

This recipe was pretty much the same (except I used only a tablespoon of minced onion) as I have always made my meatloaves. The new twist is the glaze! I only changed it a bit by adding a touch of molasses, and it was very tasty and my husband loved it. At about 40 minutes into the cooking time, I added a bit of water to keep it from scorching and it really made it moist. Also, I added Worcester, parsley and oregano into the meatloaf mix. And after the glaze was spread on I sprinkled on more oregano and parsley.

Amazing!!!!! I'm a new wife and a new cook trying to find my way around the kitchen and this recipe was not only delicious, but easy enough where a new cook like me can make it without a problem! This is my husband's favorite dish and even my mother asked me for the recipe! I took other people's advice and added less mustard and more ketchup. Can't stress how EASY and delicious this recipe is! Definitely a keeper!!!!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly as written. I should have covered it as I typically do when making meatloaf. After 1 hour and 15 minutes of cooking uncovered, it was still pink in the middle.

This was a really easy recipe.  However, it was bland.  I'll probably make it again but next time I'll make some changes to the recipe to add more flavor.

This meatloaf is amazing. I use seasoned bread crumbs and maybe only 1/4 to 1/2 onion and that's the only difference I make. Sometimes I wrap it in thick cut bacon and then put the sauce on top and oh, man...SO GOOD. I make this all the time for my fiance and stepdaughter and they love it. Me too!

This recipe will replace the one I've been using for the past 20 years!  It was excellent.  The only changes I made were to use just 1 T of mustard and in place of bread crumbs, I used oatmeal (trying to eat wheat-free).  Next time I will take the advice of another reviewer and sauté the onions before adding to the meat mixture.  I also had more meat than what would fit in my loaf pan so I made individual meat loafs with a muffin pan (reduced baking time by about 20 minutes).  My son, who does NOT like meat loaf loved this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is excellent.  my tweek.  used 78%lean 15% fat ground round. also sauted the onion and for the mustard substituted Maille honey dejon - used Pepperidge Farm white sandwich bread. 3 slices processed in the food processor makes excellent bread crumbs. used one large yellow onion.  used parchment paper on cookie sheet to form the loaf and topped with sauce - best ever

I make this all the time, and made it yesterday for my family, we love this recipe! I make it exactly as is but only use one slice of bread (large slice of whole wheat bread), and for the topping, I prefer more mustard to ketchup ratio and cut back a little on the brown sugar as the ketchup makes it sweet enough. I use the Holy Trinity (onion bell pepper celery a.k.a mirepoix) pretty heavy handed as well instead of just onions. Always a hit!

Very similar to my usually recipe, the only changes I made was I used tomato sauce instead of milk, used dried mustard instead of prepared mustard and waited till the last 10 min and added the glaze. My husband loves this says its better then his mother's meatloaf.

I make this about once a month. I took some reviewer's advice and sauted onion and garlic before adding it.  But the other night I was short of time,so I chopped the onion, and 3 cloves of garlic and threw it in.   Much more flavorful!  When I went to make the sauce, I found I only had jalapeno mustard, so I used that.  WOW! Husband asked me to make another batch! It raised this meatloaf to five stars.  And the meatloaf sandwich the next day was much more interesting.  I suspect I'll be making it more often now . . .

This is a good, basic meatloaf recipe, and it's very similar to the one that I always use, although I normally don't measure out the ingredients...I just eyeball them. You can tweak it a bit to your family's tastes -- such as adding garlic or worcestershire -- but it's great just like it is. I usually add a chopped up green pepper along with the chopped onion myself.

I used the Italian bread crumbs and sauteed the diced onions in butter prior to cooking.  I also got creative and used a Schezuan sweet and spicy glaze mixed with catchup for the glaze. excellent.  I pulled it out too early and had to pop it back in for a few minutes even when the center registered 160, it needed a few minutes more.

Super easy. I had never eaten or prepared meatloaf before, and this recipe was a hit. My boyfriend loved it.
I added about 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, a good sprinkling of granulated garlic, and about 2 tbsp of BBQ sauce to the meat.
I didn't sauté the onions and they turned out nice and soft for me- wouldn't sauté them next time either as it adds extra time/dishes and I thought it tasted great without.
Extra sauce is definitely a good idea.
Great recipe overall, simple and delicious.

I tried this to specifically test out the loaf of the recipe and followed the recipe exactly.  it was ok in taste, but I am looking for a different texture , one that is more put together.  this was loose and crumbly. (note to self:  used angus beef)

I am NOT a meatloaf fan at all usually.  The meatloaf I remember from growing up was dry with baked ketchup on it.  BUT my 20 year old culinary student wanted to try making it so I agreed after looking up this recipe.  This was SO good.   We followed the instructions exactly and it was the BEST.  We adjusted the serving size to 10 because all I had was a two pound package of meat.  There is plenty left over and I think this is going to make terrific sandwiches tomorrow!

This was a very easy recipe to follow and very tasty! I changed only a few things. I used seasoned Italian bread crumbs in the meat and I sautéed the onion with fresh garlic in olive oil. For the sauce, I used only 1 tablespoon of brown sugar instead of 2 tablespoons and I also added 2 tablespoons of water to it.  It was a hit! It was moist and juicy. My pick husband even asked for a second helping and then excused himself from the table to get a third slice for himself. Thank you for sharing. I will definitely make this meatloaf again.

This recipe was awesome! I also added green bell pepper and sautéed the onion and bell peppers together first. I also used real bread and sliced it into tiny bread pieces as well as seasoned bread crumbs (about 1/2 and 1/2.) I am a huge cheese lover and so is my boyfriend so I layered about an inch of meatloaf then a 1/2 inch of cheese over and over again until I ran out of meatloaf. The cheese was my favorite part. I used Monterey Jack. The ketchup/mustard/brown sugar sauce was so yummy I made extra to top it off when it came out of the oven. My boyfriend was highly impressed with how good it was. He ate it for 3 days in a row!! Iv made meatloaf before but it has never been this good. I am definatly adding this to my favorite recipe list!!!

This was a very good and very tasty simple meatloaf recipe. My only complaint is that with the brown sugar it makes the meatloaf over-the-top sweet. The ketchup has enough sugar in it to give the dish some sweetness.

WOW!  I tried this tonight and my wife laughed....Well it turned out GREAT!! I used chopped onions in her spice rack(freeze dried??). I poured have of the topping on and put in oven then after it was done, I drained the grease off and topped with rest of topping and put back in oven for about 3 more minutes.

VERY GOOD!!! even for me....I think the topping made it!!!!

This is an excellent recipe!  I appreciate that it is so simple but results in a delicious meat loaf.  I've tried other recipes that required more ingredients but still did not compare to this-- I would highly recommend this recipe.

I tried this recipe today and we really enjoyed it. I followed the suggestions from others and sauteed the onions,garlic and green bell pepper. I added only 1/2c of milk because I didn't want it to be mushy. I also added a dash of worcestershire sauce to the meat mix.  I made the topping using only 1 tbsp of brown sugar and equal parts ketchup/mustard. It was perfect! The loaf was nice and firm, tasty and juicy. I would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for an easy and quick meatloaf. I will definitely make this again.

This was the best meatloaf I have made. Absolutely delicious. Taking the advice of other users I did make a few changes. 1. I used lean ground turkey. 2. Sauteed a half onion and a 1/2 bellpepper with 1 teaspoon of minced garlic and butter. 3. Added 2 teaspoons of Worcestshire sauce and 1 teaspoon of Heinze 57 to meat mixture along with seasoning. 4. Only used 2 teaspoons of light brown sugar to 1 cup of Ketchup and 1 teaspoon of Worcestshire sauce for topping ***you will want to make extra topping** 5. Cooked for 1 hour and 30 minutes and drained excess liquid mid way through. Soooo moist but not falling apart. Very Good!

I always  made meatloaf with a recipe that my mother had but lately it just seemed to lose its appeal so I thought I would try something a bit different.  SO glad I did!  THis worked out just perfect for me.  It held together really well and the topping was especially delicious....definitely NOT too sweet for us.   I thought a cup of milk would be too much, but not so.   This will be my new meatloaf recipe from now on.

Absolutely yummy.....  Like some of the reviews i browned the onions a bit in butter and added some chili seasoning.  I added some chopped green onion to the meat mixture and about a tbsp of Heinz 57 steak sauce. (also adding about two tbsp to the ketchup mixture). After i topped the meat mixture i added some thinly sliced tomato and red pepper on top.  Delicious.....

This has been the only meatloaf recipe that's has been a success!  I've made it three times now and will be making a  a cupcake version for Easter tomorrow. The only addition that I added was 2 mild sausages just to give it a little kick. I also added a few gulps of worcestershire sauce. The topping was fine as well I used just a little less mustard. Highly recommend trying this recipe.

I love this and I am not even a fan of meatloaf! Instead of bread crumbs I use a box of stuffing mix! So yummy!!! :)The first time I made it was with ground turkey and it was amazing! Tonight we are trying ground beef!

This is a family favorite, easy to make and the ketchup/brown sugar glaze adds just the right flavor.  I usually make double of the brown sugar and ketchup sauce for when I serve it, there are barely any leftovers for meatloaf sandwiches.

I made this meatloaf several times. Each time I tweak it just a bit. When mixing the ingredients, I use Stove Top stuffing instead of breadcrumbs, but tonight I didn't have enough so I crushed up some Chex cereal and added it to the mix. My boyfriend LOVED it and I did too.

I made this tonight just as written.  Loved the topping with the brown sugar.  Not too sweet but just enough with the ketchup and mustard.  My husband said please make it again and as easy as it is that was music to my ears.  Lots of left overs too, which makes it even better for me!

Wonderful recipe.  I made it for years using a package of onion soup mix instead of onions and sour cream instead of milk.  I tried the chopped onions (not sauteed) and still used the sour cream instead of milk.  Very nice texture.  I've used that topping for years also and love it but you can use any topping.  I never make any other recipe for meatloaf.

My whole family loves this recipe, including a fiance' obsessed with the spicy and a meat-picky two year old. It's very good! I don't use the mustard but I'm not a fan of mustard. As a person who dislikes meatloaf in general I find myself now making it bi-weekly.

SO GOOD!!! I had never had meatloaf before, and to be honest, was very nervous about the brown sugar, ketchup, mustard combo. It was AWESOME!! It is now a go to recipe in our house and everyone loves it!

Delicious recipe! I actually combined this recipe and the cheeseburger meatloaf recipe and it came out perfect! Only thing I added was some celery, which only made it even better. :-)

This is a good basic meatloaf recipe, not dry. I do use canned evaporated milk, it really makes a difference.  I also added a little savoury.  For bread crumbs I prefer soft crumbs and not too small.   I baked it for just over an hour in a meatloaf pan. Next time I'll try the shallower pan.

I love this recipe. It's the first meatloaf I've ever made and I've made it like 5 times now (in the last month or so). I use free-range organic ground beef and use only a pound instead of a pound and a half. I also cut the breadcrumbs down to 2/3 a cup and use Worcestishire sauce in the meatloaf and in the sauce for on top. This is delicious, and one of the easiest things to make.

Delish!  I made this recipe but only had 1.25 lbs of beef so i eyeballed everything.  I also didn't have ketchup so I substituted with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.  To Die For!  Will make again!

This recipe is quick, easy and good. I used 1 1/2 tsp. dried mustard instead of the regular mustard, and added 3 drops of smoke flavoring to the sauce. Also I used Italian Bread Crumbs. My husband said it was the best meatloaf he ever ate anywhere! Thanks.

Very simple, basic meatloaf recipe.  I substituted 1/3 of the beef for TVP (textured vegetable protein) to save money and fat.  I thought it tasted the same.  I usually bake slightly longer than the recipe suggests.  There are many ways to change this basic recipe up.  I try to get a bit creative.

This recipe was Excellent!  I used the Meatloaf Mix (Veal, Pork and Beef) from the Meat Section in the market.  It was so tasty and my family really enjoyed it.  The brown sugar, mustard and ketchup is the perfect topping to it.  Thank you :)

This turned out great, followed directions except I added a cup of chopped bacon to the meat, and added a cup of oatmeal. I made a double batch and an extra half pound of ground beef...it was good, and I just wanted something that was straight meatloaf, not exotic. I also added like two table spoons of worcestershire sauce...

I made this recipe and it was the most moist meatloaf I have ever made. I only slightly changed a few things that I don't think would have made much of a difference in the overall result. 1. I used 1 lb. ground pork and 1 lb. ground venison. 2. I used 2 eggs instead of 1 because I used more meat, and 3. I didn't use table salt because I try to follow low sodium diets, but I did add garlic. My husband loved this meat loaf and he didn't think that the sauce topping was too sweet. Also, I got the new meatloaf pan (as seen on t.v.) for Christmas and christened it with this recipe. I totally recommend this meatloaf, (and the new pan lol). Easy and delicious!

very good, lacked flavor but this is an excellent base. My son (6y) and I both loved it. Next time i´ll make 2 x the topping and mix half of it in the meat. And the rest will go on top after 30 min in the oven.

It's a huge hit in our home! We like to add some green and red pepper, as well. The sauce for the top is terrific! We go through this recipe pretty quickly, so I usually have to double the recipe (we use for meatloaf sandwiches later in the week). Works great for meatballs, too!

This is now the only recipe we use for meatloaf.  We substitute the bread crumbs with Ritz crackers as well as the other alterations of the sauted onions etc.  It is amazing!  We would all highly recommend it!

For me this recipe was very unsuccessful, I ended up giving it to my dogs. Fell apart instantly. (prob due to the milk) There was a huge pool of oil at the bottom of the pan and had to pour it out and it filled a tuna can and a half full of oil.

This is a good basic recipe to start for a good meatloaf.  I added a few more ingredients in it - 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp dry mustard powder, 1 tsp garlic powder.  I also used only 3/4 cup of whole milk and seasoned bread crumbs.  I also took the advice of others and sauteed the onions first (threw in some fresh garlic as well).  It did take about an 1 1/2 hours to get it to 160 degrees.  I didn't make the glaze as both my husband and I do not like sweet on our meatloaf. I made a brown gravy instead and served it with that.  It was very good.

My first time making meatloaf. This recipe was great! I sauteed the onions before I mixed it with the ground beef. I also diced carrots and potatoes, boiled them together and then mixed it into the ground beef. Other than that I did everything else in the recipe.

Wonderful! So easy to make, I used croutons instead of bread crumbs. Tossed them in whole. Next time I'll add more topping mixture.

I have made this several times...just followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and teenage sons devour it.  I double the recipe and cook for 1 1/2 hr. Recommend using lean ground beef, or draining half way thru cooking. Sometimes instead of ketchup I use tomato sauce.  Excellent and so easy to make.

I love this meatloaf! I first tested this recipe on my husband and it has become his favorite.It is such a great base recipe and easily addapted to whatever preference. I use italian seasoned breadcrumbs and I sautee the onions as suggested also add a tablespoon or two of worcestershire...Delish! I have since made it for my parents and in-laws. Everyone always fights for leftovers if there are any!

This one is going into the recipe box for sure. I didn't have any bread crumbs so I substituted them with saltines and used Smokehouse mustard in the topping and the family loved it, even my very picky kids(my son went back for fourths).

Made this with elk burger(we are hunters). It turned out great! We also made some of the alterations some of the others said. Used plain bread crumbs, added 2 TBS Worcestershire sauce, added chopped green peppers, green onions. We sauteed the onions first, just cause i didnt want a crunchy meatloaf. Added plenty of salt and pepper, garlic powder, and dried parsley. People are saying the topping is too sweet but i loved it! Perfect topping for this meatloaf. I recommend letting it set for 15 minutes after cooking so it can set up. Overall a great recipe!!

Good recipe, It was mouth watering. Instead of using milk, I used 1/4 can of beef gravy and I added some chopped up bell peppers. I also added garlic salt. My family loved it. I will try this recipe again. :)

The meat was really good the sauce on top was a little sweet for my taste. a couple kids agreed and of course another child liked it. So over all we will try and cut down the sweetness next time.

Very Good!!  I too sauted the onion with garlic in butter and doubled the sauce.  When doubling the sauce, I doubled the ketchup but only 3 tablespoons of brown sugar and mustard.  Depending on you sweetness meter, you could get away with not doubling the brown sugar.  I had a package of ground beef that was 2.25 lbs.  When shaping, I flattened to about 3", which will be perfect when using the leftovers for sandwiches, and it was done in 1 hour.

This was a fantastic meatloaf. I too sauteed onion and garlic. I used seasoned croutons that I ground up in the blender and for the sauce, I didn't want it too sweet. I only added 2 tsp of brown sugar and about the same for the mustard, I then seasoned to taste. It was sooo good.

This is the first time I am actually taking the time to comment on a recipe. This was PHENOMENAL! Thank you to everyone who wrote a review because that helped me make the BEST meatloaf ever when I tried this recipe. I actually had a family pack of ground turkey that I used (3 lbs)so I just doubled the ingredients listed since the recipe was intended for 1 1/2 lbs. I also took the advice of the other reviewers and sauteed my onions with garlic and butter before adding it to the ground turkey. Also, using Italian bread crumbs and adding the Worcestershire sauce to the mixture was perfect! My family is still talking about how delicious it was. Oh and I let it cook for 1 hour and 25 minutes like another reviewer suggested! This recipe is a WINNER! Sncgrant in NY

Good recipe, though I like the recipe on the back of the quaker oats box more. I added mushrooms and didn't make the ketchup topping.

Great tasting meatloaf! There are a few things I kind of tweaked in this recipe though, (1) use seasoned breadcrumbs for more flavor, (2) after 1 hr is up remove excess liquid in loaf pan and use meat thermometer to check temp (160 for medium). If the  temp is too low place back in the oven and change temp to 375. Take out after 30 mins or once internal temp reaches 160. You shouldn't see a mushy loaf by then. Good luck fellow cooks!!

AMAZING!- I'm not normally a huge fan of meatloaf, but this recipe is superb. My husband requested that I make him a meatloaf that wasn't "fancy", this one was perfect! I followed the advice of other users and it turned out perfect. LOVE this recipe. TRY IT! it was super easy too!

I just made this recipe.  It is so amazing.  I sauce on top I was a bit leery of, but it is amazing.  I added in some orange bell peppers and I added some hot chili peppers from my garden and they both kicked it up a notch.  Very delicious recipe.

I thought this meatloaf recipe was fantastic!  I have never cooked meatloaf and this recipe was simple.  I sautéed yellow onion and a green bell pepper in butter. I added a little Worcestershire sauce.   My fiance and son who both really do not like meatloaf thought it was really good and requested it be put in our dinner rotation.

I love this recipe. Here are my additions and variation changes:
I chopped red, yellow, orange, green peppers and added to ground turkey mixture along with 2T. bbq sauce, 1T. Worchestershire sauce. Used garlic & herb seasoning instead of salt & pepper. Let sit in refridgerator overnight. 
Used 1 small can tomatoe sauce with 1T. Worchestershire, 1T. bbq sauce, 3T. brown sugar. Add onion and garlic powder. Pour over meatloaf in pan. Sprinkle with parsley flakes, cover and bake as directed in recipe.  YUMMY TO MY TUMMY MOMMY is all I heard!

Super yummy!   My husband, who's not a meatloaf fan, even enjoyed it.  My 4yr old even loved it and she can be a picky eater when it comes to meat/protein.  The only thing I changed, like the rest of the reviewers, was put the sauce on the top - yum!

First time making meatloaf and I'm glad I made this recipe. The only changes I made was to put 2 lbs of hamburger (venison at that) and I mistakenly forgot the milk. Even so it was delicious, a must-make-again.

I've made this recipe several times and it's turned out really well each time.  Everyone always enjoys it - even those who typically haven't been fans of meatloaf!  Living in Asia makes it difficult to find certain ingredients when cooking Western food, but this recipe has such easy/common ingredients!  Definitely a keeper for our family!

I just adjusted a few things: use 1/2 finely chopped purple onion, 1 cup of Italian bread crumbs,  a tablespoon or two of Worcestershire sauce. I doubled the brown sugar, mustard & ketchup mixture & baked on the side in a covered dish. Drain the fat from meatloaf then add the brown sugar, ketchup & mustard mixture.

A slightly leaner ground beef is the way to go. I had to drain mine twice during cooking to make sure it wasn't swimming in grease.
Update: This is my go to meatloaf recipe. Delicious!

This has been my go-to recipe for over three years. No changes are necessary for a delicious meatloaf, but I usually replace the fresh onion with onion powder out of convenience. This freezes well both before and after baking.  Prepare the meatloaf in a foil-lined loaf pan, freeze thoroughly (at least overnight), then pop the whole thing, foil and all, out of the loaf pan and wrap tightly for the freezer. Before thawing, completely remove the foil and thaw in the same loaf pan overnight. I prefer to freeze before baking, but either way works.

I have never used milk in meatloaf before so I was worried about this recipe at first.  I feed three men and they all loved it.  I used green onions because that is all I had at hand.  It was such a success with the boys, I will definitely make this again!!

This recipe was very easy to prep which is what I was looking for. It was also tasty which is a must as well! I used ground turkey and I also added the glaze half way through cooking time. I think it would have been better with ground beef. Glaze was delicious! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is easy and tastes fantastic! The second time I tried it, I added a few of my own spices just to try it out and although it came out great the regular recipe is just as good. This is one to add to the family cookbook :o)

Easy and quick to make. I definitely recommend sauteeing the onions -- if you do not,  they taste a little chunky. I usually add some diced bacon in as well.

This recipe was indeed easy and came out very good. They didn't say to cover the pan when you put it in the oven but I did for the first 30 min and it came out very moist. I also seasoned the meat with some garlic and onion powder and a little seasoning salt(we like more flavor). I also minced the onions instead of chopping them so they integrated into the mixture better. All in all a great easy dinner stand by. I will use this recipe again.

I have never like meatloaf but decided to make this recipe for my family and it was wonderful! Only thing different I did was sautee the sweet onions and the rest of the recipe was followed to the "T".  Since it was a big hit I have to double the recipe for the family!

I baked this in a 9"x13" pan, and after 30 minutes I added a 20oz can of drained pineapple chunks topped with brown sugar, cracker crumbs, and melted butter. Next time I'll caramelize the onions beforehand, add worcestershire sauce to the meaty mixture, and double the brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard sauce, which I added some barbecue sauce to.

Great quick and easy recipe and it tastes great. I have made it by also adding a chopped orange or yellow pepper. Sometimes I substitute ground Turkey instead of using ground meat, it is still awesome! Try it tonight and especially with the sauce topping, yum!

Absolutely fantastic! I cooked just a hare longer than 1 hour as we love a crispy meatloaf on the outside. I also put 2 tablespoons more brown sugar than recipe calls for.

I just put this into the oven and have only sampled a taste......the best part will be the sauce on the top. Otherwise, it seems extremely bland. I could not think of what to do to make it better. Very disappointed.

Very easy to make, and delicious.
I used 2 lbs meat and skim milk. Next time I'm going to add a bit of garlic salt because it was a little mild.
I cooked it longer than 1 hour. I used a meat thermometer, and took it out of the oven at 170º, then let it rest for 10 minutes before serving.
I will totally make this meatloaf again. I joined allrecipes just so that I could save this recipe and review it.

This is the first time I made meatloaf. It was quite enjoyable however I was concerned that it would be too much meat so I sauteed onions, garlic, chopped zucchini and red pepper and added it to the meat mixture. We made our own sauce since the one provided didn't appeal to me.I added the sauce after a half hour and let the meat cook for about 1and a half hours. It was very moist and this allowed the sauce to really marinate the meat. Will definitely do this again and possibly with more veggies the next time since I know that the meat will not crumble.

I added 1 tsp of chili powder and 1 tsp of garlic powder and only used 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. I also added 2 Tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce.  I only used 1/2 an onion and added 2 fresh mushrooms(chopped).  Instead of ketchup I used Hickory barbeque sauce. turned out great but could have added another egg to help hold it together better.  It wasn't mush or anything like that but if your planning on using leftovers for a sandwich you will need another egg.  otherwise a great recipe!

I followed this base recipe and added a few more ingredients. I sauteed the onions with a green bell pepper.  I added Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon thyme, 1/4 oregano, salt & pepper to the beef mixture.  And doubled the ketchup mixture.

I made this tonight and it was excellent!  I changed the recipe a little bit.  One, I made this into four different mini-meatloaves so I could freeze leftovers (I'm single).  I also added the tblsp worsh. sauce and sauteed the onion with garlic like other reviewers suggested.

Ok, so I just took my meatloaf out of the oven and I have to say I am pleasantly surprised...especially with adding milk. I have made some modifications and want to share them with you. First, I had about 2 lbs of meat, so I seasoned that with pepper (no salt), garlic powder and adobo (to my family's taste). In addition to the onion, I chopped up a piece of green pepper, and instead of 1 cup of milk, I used 3/4 cups from what another cook mentioned and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce in the meat (that makes a difference). Although the taste is great and very very very moist, it still came out a little mushy. I'll be sure to use only 1/2 cup of milk. My family has not tried this yet, but I'm sure they will love this. I rated this 5 because I know the next time I make this it will be perfect. SO EXCITED!!! Thanks for the recipe and happy cooking.

Very simple, moist and tasty! I added in about 1/2 cup of chopped fresh parsley (can use even more, if you like) and about 2 Tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce (and lessened milk by same amount). For those who like a little spice, perhaps you'd want to add in some chopped jalapenos to your taste.

Was so looking forward to a good meatloaf last night, but was sadly disappointed.  Followed this recipe exactly, even adding the sauteed onions and Worcestershire sauce as reviewers have suggested.  The meatloaf was soggy, and all I could taste was the breading filler, and barely the meat.  Also, I ended up baking the meatloaf for 1 1/2 hours,  just to get the internal temperature to 175 degrees.  My husband was kind enough to say it tasted good because he was starving.  If I made this recipe again, I would cut the amount of bread crumbs and milk.  The ketchup, mustard, brown sugar topping was delicious, though.  Would use that again.

Amazing!  This is the best meatloaf I've ever had!  I did make a few changes due to what I had on hand.  I used crispy onions (like what you would use on a green bean cassaroll) and I didn't have regular bread crumbs or crackers, so I used the Italian Cheese its.  Turned out amazing!  Love this and will make again soon!

This recipe is the best, I followed the directions to the T and it came out perfect. I read some of the other reviews and added 1 table spoon of the Worcestershire Sauce and ¼ cup of Honey BBQ Sauce. It was superb!!

Yummm!  I also sauted the onions and added the 1 TB worcestershire sauce as someone else suggested.  I added a heaping handful of shredded cheese.  And I made the topping just as the recipe directed and it was perfect!  I also served it with Paula Deen's cottage potatoes - and steamed peas.  PERFECT dinner!  This recipe will definitely have a place in the "family favorites" cookbook!

My first time ever making meatloaf was with this recipe. Everything turned out perfect. Only thing I would change is the amount of onion. Instead of a whole onion, next time I will only use half. Other than that it was great!

I made this recipes many times as I love meatloaf. Very easy to make and very, very tasty. I added one carrot, half one green pepper and half one red pepper, some parsley and lots and lots of dill, just because I love dill. I mixed all ingredients and baked them without the sauce. When meatloaf was cooked, I sprinkled ketchup only on top (without the brown sugar and the mustard). It's amazing!

This was a very moist and delicious meatloaf.  I only made one change; I did half ground beef and half ground veal.  The glaze on top was very good as well.  The cold left overs made the best sandwiches.  I will stick with this recipie going forward.

Awesome! However, next time I will omit the brown sugar in the sauce...it was a bit too sweet for my liking.  I did add the worcestershire sauce like others suggested and I also added garlic powder.  All in all a great, easy meatloaf!

The meatloaf deserves 5 stars! Very good! I did tone down the onions because that many onions would have induced anarchy in my house. This recipe got 4 stars because the sweet topping was not a hit at all. We have discovered that we don't like sweet flavors on our meat so next time I'm going to just throw on some bbq sauce instead. Overall, this is a recipe I will make again.

Wonderful meatloaf.  I don't make it hardly ever and wanted a simple and highly rated recipe.  This is it.  Hubby loved it and so did I.  I doubled the Ketchup glaze recipe because I was baking it with potato slices and wanted a more "saucy" liquid for potatoes.  The only thing that I did differently than the recipe is I halved the mustard upon reading other reviews suggestions.  Super easy and will be a staple at our house.

Just finished eating this meatloaf, amazing!  You absolutely must sautee the onions as others suggest and I used half the mustard and a little more ketchup.  Super juicy, easy to prepare, very common ingredients, clean plates!!  I served it with steamed brocoli.

Love this meatloaf recipe!  It is great as written.  But I also have made it with 2/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup barbeque sauce (instead of 1 cup milk).  Cook it in muffin trays at 450 for 20 minutes and its always perfectly cooked the first time I take it out!

Delicious, truly easy meatloaf. I'm not sure why, but it almost had a buttery taste to it. Could probably use a little less breadcrumbs, because it was awfully moist.  But still yummy.  

Like a lot of the reviews, I added 1 TB of Worcestershire; I also sauteed both garlic & onion before adding to the meat.  I used a Meatloaf mix (ground beef, pork & veal) & I added some parsley & oregano.   For the sauce, I used my other meatloaf recipe sauce - 1/3 cup ketchup, 2 TB Balsamic Vinegar & a sprinkle of Red Pepper Flakes (mixed & poured over before cooking).  

My husband & kids loved this meatloaf & it's on our "Keeper" list.

Great recipe almost similar to my own I usually use red & green peppers and onions, sautee them all then combine with other ingredients. I also make my sauce and combine with it so the sauce can cook all the way through and top with remaining or additional sauce

This recipe is fantastic! Everyone who eats it, is in awe. I changed up a bit: I added in 1/2 diced tomato, parsley flakes, sometimes a tiny bit of italian seasoning. I also sautéed the chopped onions before adding to mixture with 2 cloves of garlic. In the topping mixture, I added tabasco sauce for a little spice. Very easy and great for leftovers! YUM!

I'm far from being a pro in the kitchen, but this recipe gave me some hope.  I took several of the suggestions made in previous reviews like adding worcestershire sauce to the ketchup/mustard mix and sauteed the onions in butter and garlic prior to mixing with the ground beef.  I also added 1 tablespoon Chalupa hot sauce to the ketchup mix since I like a little zip in pretty much everything I eat and it turned out great!  The leftovers were even tastier.

for people who cannot cannot have preservatives, wheat, or dairy (like my sister) : I used rice crumbs instead of bread crumbs, and rice milk instead of milk, organic soy sauce instead of ketchup and maple syrup instead of brown sugar. (I did use a strong german mustard even though it had sulphites. Maybe instead mustard powder could be used?) It came out well, but I think I didnt need quite so much rice crumb or milk. And next time I would make more sauce and mix some right in the meat, and put more on top, as it was a tiny too bland and ricey tasting. But that was just my taste, my parents loved it how it was.

This is a very good base recipe.  The only thing I don't really like is the topping. It's not terrible, but needs to be tweaked for my taste.

This was excellent. I used a combo of lean beef and pork otherwise I followed exactly. I didn't saute the onions beforehand as I like a little crunch to them. Might cook a little longer than 1 hour next time.

I though this was very good, even the sauce on top. I did add a tablesppon of worchestshire sauce to the meat. I would suggest cutting the bread crumbs down to 2/3 cup, also i used italian bread crumbs. All in all very good. Thanks!

This is a great recipe; my family (all picky eaters) LOVED IT. I did not add onions at all but I think they could add additional flavour. The other change I made was to use a flavoured bread crumbs. Overall meat loaf was a huge success

I added 1 cup diced carrots, mushrooms and celery. A bit more milk, some italian seasonings and worchestshire sauce. Also zested up the sauce with hot sauce, cayenne pepper and a bit of maple syrup.  Served with cheesy mashed potatoes. Very yummy dinner!

My family loved this recipe. i made a few changes because I didn't have enough of some things, I did saute onion and garlic like others did and added worcestershire sauce, then I used wheat seasoned bread crumbs which i didn't have enough of so, I chopped up some ritz crackers in the blender to make crumbs, it worked. I used spicy brown mustard because it was what I had, My 7 year old ate THREE peices.. (amazing). so all around a hit here.

Loved it! First attempt at making meatloaf and it was great, my boyfriend couldn't wait for leftovers the next day. I followed the directions of everyone else and browned the onions first and used the seasoned breadcrumbs and added worcestershire sauce. Definitely making this again!

My son and I love this meatloaf.  We also love onions, so we use extra onion and it is just wonderful!  Also, when I make this I make two loaves and freeze one.  It's so easy to just pop the frozen one in the pan and cook it when we want it.

I made this for the first time this evening and it is very tastey.  I used meatloaf mix instead of ground beef.  I didn't use as much onion, and I added garlic powder to it as well.  When making the topping, I only used half of the mustard and added Worcestershire sauce like some of the other reviewers suggested.  The topping does make the meatloaf.  It adds a sweet taste to a bland dish.  My husband has not yet tried it, so he will be the ultimate test.

Delicious and super easy. I used crushed crackers and it was so good. I love the topping. I actually made this twice and the second time I made it was while we were camping. I cooked it in a dutch oven over the campfire and it turned out great. I will definitely make this again and again.

I just made this tonight for dinner. I followed the recipe exact and I thought it was super easy but super bland. It was just okay to me, my husband on the other hand said he liked it. I thought it tasted like a big hunk of beef. :(

Just made this recipe for the 2nd maybe 3rd time and once again it was delicious! :) I tossed in a bit of my own flavors. Added some parmesan, Nature's Seasoning and worcheshire to the meat mixture. Also added abt 2 tbls of BBQ sauce to the topping.

Recipe is easy, but found that the meat could have used more seasoning than just salt/pepper.  The ketchup topping was very good, I didn't find it too ketchupy like some reviewers, just needed the rest of it to be as good.  Would use again, but would spice it up a bit.

Excellent, easy recipe. So far, I've made it twice. The first time, I sauteed the onions in butter as suggested in the reviews. The second time, I skipped the sauteing and I also added tiny diced carrot pieces and red and green peppers. As others suggested, this time around I used less mustard and more ketchup. Very tasty!

This recipe turned out GREAT!! It's just my dad and I here and he LOVED it! I followed all the suggestions given including browning the onions, but I did not like all that mustard, so I added some more ketchup and a tablespoon of sugar to the sauce mixture. It was delicious :)

I took the advice of previous raters and cooked the onion in butter before adding it the mix mixture. I was disappointed in the flavor of this meatloaf. While it was very moist, it tasted like ground beef and breadcrumbs. I also thought topping tasted like nothing more than "sweet ketchup". My hubby liked it but I didnt care for it. I wont make this again.

I'm a newlywed and beginner cook.  I thought this recipe would be easy.  However, my meatloaf has been cooking for 2.5 hours and it still isn't done.  We went ahead and ate the sides and if it ever finishes, I plan on making sandwiches with it tomorrow.  Where did I go wrong?

Used more ketchup and less mustard to make more of the sauce, also added some bell peppers to the meatloaf!  It was the first time I had ever made it since as a child I despised meatloaf but we enjoyed this!!

Very bland. My family told me to go back to the way I used to make meatloaf. Since I never make it the same way twice, I'm not sure what that means except that they didn't like this one.

Ok, I modified it a little to fit my comfort zone.  I used onion soup mix vs. the chopped onion, but everything else was the same.  It turned out very flavorful.  I really liked the glaze.

I love this meatloaf!! It really is easy. I didn't used the sauce of mustard,ketchup and brown sugar though. I just didn't like the taste, though I usually like them sepately. I simply covered with plain ketchup and it was just as good!

Awesome meatloaf. Made this for my family the other week. Wish I had made more of the sauce for a dipping sauce. Use less milk or more breadcrumbs though.

The meatloaf was great, but I wish I hadn't used any brown sugar in the topping.  As one reviewer mentioned, it was more like a "meat dessert" with the topping.  I would use the recipe again for the meatloaf...minus the topping.

This is very similar to 1 of my quick easy favorites, however if you add a pinch of nutmeg to that topping it adds a really nice old campfire chuckwagon twist to the meal! Very good!

Really good!!  Unfortunately, no left-overs for sandwiches.  I only had 1/2 onion, so I added 2 green onions.  In addition to the previously recommended add-ins, I added 1 t. red pepper flakes; our family likes things a little spicier.  Perfect fall meal, with mashed potatoes and gravy and baked brussell sprouts.

Super easy to make... the sauce is great (definitely double it) but I found the meatloaf itself quite bland without the sauce.

Just like momma made! I added green bell pepper to the mixture and some hot sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar topping. It was perfect, not sweet at all like others had stated, this was exactly the recipe I was looking for!

We love this meatloaf, I have done some modifications each time ive made it. The last few times we have had lean ground turkey and it was just as good (if not better!) I use two eggs and also add a little Worcestershire sauce to the meatloaf, sometimes i add different seasonings to vary the flavor. Also double the amount of sauce. This is a great super easy and super affordable meal. Even my 2 and 4 year old will eat it, and they are picky!

This is a good basic meatloaf recipe.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and added a small can of sliced mushroom pieces, and it turned out very moist and perfectly cooked.  Not much 'wow' factor to this dish, but it was easy to prepare and the leftovers make great sandwiches!

This was a absolute hit! Had it with mashed potatos and corn everyone just loved it.  Modified the sauce a bit, instead of ketchup and mustard I used Ketchup, teriyaki suace, hot sauce and a chicken and rib sauce. MMmm so good.

So good and even better the next day..I followed some advice from other readers about the browning of the onion..also I used roasted garlic bread crumbs (something new at Krogers-Kroger brand) and it was so good...took leftovers to work and my friends ate it all up and requested more!! Will for sure make again!! So easy!

very good, added some worcestire and garlic powder, maybe a little less milk next time, but delicious.  I especially liked the glaze on the top.  My family loved it.

You can also add things like green pepper if you like and I add worcershire sauce to my mix like a teaspoon or two. I did cut back on the brown sugar to a tablespoon. I don't like the topping too sweet. I may cut back to even less next time. I think I used a little less bread crumbs as well. Very good recipe.

The recipe I use is almost exactly like this one so I know that it is delicious.  I add red pepper to mine, but I know some do not like pepper so that is personal taste.  I also use various tomato based sauces instead of milk; I like the taste and consistency better.  Also, I added everything except meat and bread crumbs to my blender because my family does like chunks of onions or peppers.  My family even requested meatloaf one year for Thanksgiving dinner.

Very Good.  I accidentally added the sugar, mustard, cayenne and garlic to the meat...I then added more to the sauce.  (I used Dijon).  The meat could have used more kick.  Next time I may add some chili powder or more cayenne.  The sauce was perfect and not too heayily proportioned.

This came out really good! I did sautee the onions and some garlic before I mixed with the meat. I did not use an entire onion, because my boyfriend is not a fan. We love the ketchup/brown sugar mix that goes on top... sooo delicious, but I always make more. I did also add Worchestershire sauce also! It was really moist and delicious!

I made this the meat was a little bland for my taste.  it says pour on the last 3 ingredients but it was more like a paste and once cooked, the stuff was just this blob on top of the loaf, i mixed it well but it was gritty and not very tatseful.  I think I will try honey next time. instead of brown sugar

This was a perfect, moist meatloaf. We had it last night and I can't wait for lunch!! Of course I read reviews and tweaked it. As suggested I used lean ground beef, sauteed the onion with 2 t garlic and 2 T finely chopped celery. I also used seasoned breadcrumbs, added T Worcestershire sauce. I used 3/4 cup skim milk and 3/4 cup crumbs. Then I formed it in a loaf pan and knocked it out on a cookie sheet (let the grease out!) lined with parchment paper (a huge time saver for cleanup) For the sauce I only used 1 T yellow mustard, 1 T dark brown sugar (packed) and a heaping 1/3 cup ketchup. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes and a yellow squash and tomato saute.  It was fantastic!

Great! Nice and easy, when I made mine I did half the slab of a large hamberger pack from Wal-Mart, followed everything it ended up making 2 lofes. It was great and had enough for the next day. Fed a family of 5 2x.

Great easy meatloaf! The whole family loved it. I did make several changes based on other comments: couple splashes of worcestershire sauce, 1/4 cup of water (makes it extra tender) , 1 tb parsley flakes, basil, oregano, sprinkle of onion and garlic powder. Sauteed onions in garlic and butter.  DOUBLE or TRIPLE the sauce. Reserve some sauce for later. I used dijon mustard instead and decreased brown sugar to 1 TB.

Followed suggestion to sautee onions with garlic first.  Also, made homemade breadcrumbs by blending some toasted bread with parsley and garlic powder.  Doubled the sauce as well.

Excellent! Only changes I made was instead of salt, I used Lawreys seasoned salt. I also added 2 jalapenos and 2 cloves of minced garlic. Best meatloaf ever. I love spicy.

Awesome meatloaf!  I also doubled the ketchup.  Boyfriend said a little less sugar next time, but other than that (and the loaf falling apart because it was so moist - which I was not complaining about) it was great!

I should have read the reviews before making it. I found 1 cup of milk made it really wet. The topping, however, was excellent.

This is SO good and SO easy! This is the recipe my mother and I both use. I use either 80% ground beef, or a mixture of half 80% and half 85%. I also always use 2lbs of beef! The last time I made this I was out of brown sugar so I omitted it from the topping...in my opinion it was better-more tangy and less sweet.

I made this tonight, having never made meatloaf before, and it is amazing!  I did make all the adjustments mentioned -- browned the onion, added 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce, 1 can of chopped mushrooms, italian style bread crumbs and doubled the topping.  I also used garlic sauce to season.  It has wonderful flavor, looks great, and is very moist.

I followed ALC's compiled advice, and it all worked well, except that the tripled version of the sauce is wayyyy too much, at least for my taste. Still a great, easy recipe:)

Mine didn't seem to turn out very well. It was way too greasy and the grease spilled out into the oven while it was cooking. I would agree with another reviewer that you might need to drain the meat while it's cooking and maybe add the sauce later. An hour also didn't completely cook the entire loaf so I think I might keep trying to find a meatloaf recipe that I like.

This is very easy to make & so delicious. I modified it a little using other people's suggestions. I added 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce, green bell pepper, doubled the ketchup, used Italian style bread crumbs, & sauted the onion in 1 tablespoon of butter. My husband & I loved it!

I've made dozens of different meat loafs in 30+ years.  It's a family favorite hot for dinner and meat loaf sandwichs the next day.  This is the most moist and flavorful I've ever made.  It's now in my recipe file. I did cook the onions first and wil probably add bell  ( red & green)peppers next time

Really good. The only thing I changed was the sauce for the top of the meatloaf.  After I tasted it using the called for measurements, it had too much mustard taste so I added more brown sugar.

yummy, yummy, yummy! This was so easy and so GOOD! my husband always says that his grandfathers meatloaf is the bestever until this one. I did change it up just a little by accident.....Instead of mixing the mustard, ketchup, and brown sugar to put on top i goofed and mixed it all in. Probalbly was the best thing, it was so moist with just the right amount of sweetness. Also I added some garlic salt when putting in the salt and pepper. no left-overs. could eat this every week!!!

This meatloaf is fantastic! My husband even said that it's the best meatloaf that he's ever eaten.  I made it according to the directions but I added 1 TSP of Worsitshier (sp?) sauce (for some reason I thought that the recipe called for it & didn't realize that it didn't until afterwards) and a chopped bell pepper. I followed previous posters advice & tripled the sauce & it was just the right amount for us. I also sauteed the bell pepper & onion before adding it to the mixture. This was VERY good & I will be gladly adding this into the rotation. YUM!

This was very tasty. I added a little worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and used plain ketchup on top of the loaf. This will definitely be on the dinner menu again.

Excellent meatloaf, really enjoyed it. One thing I would recommend is that you should chop the onion really finely to avoid a chunky meatloaf.

Absolutely YUMMY. I will make this many more times. I have a nine year old and a thirteen year old - both football/basketball playing (always hungry) boys - and they loved it. And, yes, this was truly easy.

I cut the recipe in half since I don't want left overs. I didn't have brown sugar, substitued white sugar. Kept everything else as directed. It was very good.

MMMM... best meatloaf I've ever made. My hubby and kids look foward to me making it every time. And all 3 of them are very picky eater, so this recipe was a life saver. I did tweek it a bit and took the advice by other reviewers by adding 1tbs each of worchestire and A1 steak sauce. I used garlic powder instead of chopped onion. Used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, and threw in some extra seasons parsley, rosemary and onion salt instead of regular. It came out bursting with flavor and moist very delish :)

This was wonderful the first, second and third times.  :-)  My family loved it.  I have 2 VERY picky kids and they ate it.  I only used half an onion. I sauteed the onion with butter and garlic.   I added Worcester sauce. I used Italian bread crumbs. I ended up cooking it for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  It did turn out pretty wet, so next time I think I won't put as much milk in. I cooked it in a glass baking dish and it was nearly as big as the dish.

Great, easy meatloaf! I used half ground turkey and half ground beef to make it a tad healthier, but to still stick together..Love the taste, just needed to be cooked a smidge longer, like 10-15 minutes as it was REALLY juicy! my go to recipe for meatloaf now!

This was rather tasty but I made a few changes.  As I am always trying to get more veg into my kids I added about 1 1/2 of baby carrots and 1 very big pepper very finely chopped in a blender.  I chopped the onion in the blender too.  I also doubled the recipe by substituting ground pork for the one portion of beef (1 1/2 pound beef and 1 1/2 pound pork).      In the future I think I will cute the Brown Sugar or perhaps remove it completely.  The coating was tasty but a bit sweet for our taste.

Excellent texture, very moist, but somewhat bland in my opinion. I may add green peppers and cheese next time for more flavor.

This recipe is very simple and very tasty. I have made this meatloaf twice with a little change the second time. I went with half the amount of milk and Italian bread crumbs. Even with half the milk, the egg and bread crumbs still keep it very moist and the flavor of the beef comes through more.

I loved how easy it was to make and my family loved eating it all up! We just made a little extra toping but besides that I didn't change a thing.  Only down fall is that there was no left overs for meatloaf sandwiches.

I'm rating this recipe 3 stars because it was rather plain (hence the name, I suppose).  I followed what other reviewers suggested and sauteed  the onions with garlic in butter.  This would have been really bland had I not followed their suggestion.  My boyfriend doesn't like ketchup and brown sugar topping so I served with brown mushroom gravy.  This recipe is good, not great.

My husband said, "I loved it!" and I said, "Isn't LOVE a strong word for meatloaf?" - he said it was just that good.  I don't even like meatloaf and it was tasty.  It got 5 thumbs up out of our 6 - but my daughter is a vegetarian... so- 5 out of 5 actually.  VERY GOOD.  I used liquid smoke because I didn't have worcestershire sauce as some of the reviewers mentioned, and it was great.

This was a fantastic meatloaf recipe!  The only thing that I did different, was added a little Worstershire sauce, and some shredded cheese.  I also found that the I would have liked more "sauce", for the top of my meatloaf.  Next time, I will double, if not triple it.  Otherwise delicious!  Even my very picky 2 year old ate it!

This recipe just worked as it was supposed to. Wife says, "Make this again!" The only thing I changed was the topping. Substituted Honey BBQ sauce.

5+ stars! Made this for my family and even my picky little sis LOVED it. I did follow suggestions made: sauteed onion with a bit of garlic, worchestershire added, and multiplied sauce to desired amount. Also, I used crackers crumbs (club crackers work best) instead of bread crumbs...added a slightly sweet, buttery flavor. All in all, will definately make many more times

I am trying this recipe tonight for my husband and me. I flattened the meatloaf mix into a flat rectangle and sprinkled about 2 cups of grated mozzerella cheese over it, then rolled it up in a jellyroll shape. Pinch both ends to close. Yummy!

Very good base for a meatloaf!  I was not a big fan of the mustard in the topping but it was not terrible!  I only used 1 pound of ground beef so I cut down the rest of the ingredients a little (still used 1 egg) and it was very, very yummy!  I will be making this again!

This meatloaf ROCKS!  I don't normally like meatloaf but I had to work with what I already had in the kitchen.  The brown sugar and mustard made this exceptional.  Will never make meatloaf any other way:)

i followed the ingredients exactly as they were written and this was FANTASTIC!  my meatloaf took about 20 minutes longer to cook than the recipe called for and i let it sit a bit before cutting it.  it was moist and delicious.

My husband and his best friend ate this up. His friend actually called his Mom and grandma and said it was pretty much better then theirs. Trick is I used Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce, the kind you get at Menards, and Oyster Crackers.

My picky kids loved this meatloaf.  I followed the suggestions of others to sautee the onions and garlic.  I also added the worchestershire sauce to the meat mixture and doubled the sauce but only used 1 tbsp of mustard.  I also slipped in a bit of grated carrot to trick the kids into eating some veggies and it worked!

Wow! This was a great starter recipe! I did change some things: I cut up pieces of bacon and also put more on top of the loaf (amazing!), added parsley, cheddar and pepper jack cheese (in it and on top- I am a cheese lover) and used just ketchup since the brown sugar/mustard mix didn't sound very good to me. Oh, and I also used italian style bread crumbs. Luckily, I didn't add worcestershire sauce like many other people suggested because it would have made it way too juicy. I could eat this everyday! So juicy and flavorful! Thanks for sharing!

This is a great basic recipe. I use 1 lb. ground beef and 1 1lb. ground pork. I saute mushrooms onions and garlic, and add some worchestire and a little dry mustard. A family favorite!

I made this meatloaf tonight and it was really, really good! Perfect traditional recipe - nothing fancy - and very quick and easy. I only gave it 4 stars since I did change the recipe a little. I had no problems with it tasting too bland or being too mushy as others had commented. I used 1/2 cup of milk instead of a full cup, added 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, used one packet of Lipton beefy onion soup mix in place of an onion (I did not add any extra salt), and instead of breadcrumbs I used 1/2 cup of crushed saltines & 1/2 cup of crushed French's fried onions. I cooked them in a greased muffin tin so that they would cook even faster (about 35-40 min) and they came out great with a great texture. A lot of reviewers said the glaze was too sweet, so I opted for Alton brown's glaze instead: 1/2 cup of ketchup, 1 teaspoon cumin, dash of worcestershire sauce, dash of hot pepper sauce, and a tablespoon of honey. Put the glaze on the meatloaf 10 minutes after it's been cooking. Very good - tangy and a little sweet, but not overpowering.  I will definitely be using this recipe again when I want some quick, home-style meatloaf!

This turned out very nicely for me. I liked the glaze very much, it was sweet and tangy. The meatloaf was just the right consistency. The better you mix everything together, the better the consistency of the meatloaf, in my experience. I used dry bread crumbs from the store, but didn't have enough, so I toasted a piece of white bread and crumbled that in as well. My boyfriend doesn't like the chunks of onion in his meatloaf, so I put the onion through a mini food processor to mince it finely. I'm not sure if I put enough salt in (I eyeballed it) but otherwise it was tasty. I would recommend using seasoned bread crumbs, as I believe another reviewer suggested, to add a little more flavor. I poured out the excess fat as it was cooking, as the ground beef I used was high in fat, and I think this prevented it from getting too soggy. This is a good basic meatloaf recipe, and one that I will use again. My boyfriend loved it.

I didn't have 1 1/2 lbs of meat so I only used about 3/4 cup of milk, accidently forgot the onions (I won't next time) and it was still the only meatloaf my husband has eaten and ever said he liked. Until last night he wasn't a big fan, now he is. Thank you.

This is a great recipie for meatloaf.   Totally a classic...This is the one you remember from back in the day....I didnt care for the mustard....I would use a lot less next time...I always put ketchup on meatloaf anyway so im not too concerned with the topping.  Sauteed my onion and garlic and started off at 400 for 15 min, then 1 hour at 350.  made mine with 1 pound so I cut back a little on the other ingredients and it came out wonderful...Will definetly make again and again

This was ok. It was impossible to drain because the topping would have slid off into the bin.

I was surprised that my family liked this one more than the more extravagant meatloaf I made last week.  They loved this one!  Like many others, I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and a clove of crushed garlic to the meat mixture.  I did not saute the onions or garlic, and they were plenty cooked with the loaf.  I used Dijon mustard.  Yummy and so easy!

great recipe, I also added some bbq and steak sauce.  The steak sauce broke up the meat a little and added a nice flavor to it.  Added extra brown sugar and ketchup, and a bit less mustard, my family was very impressed.  Its nice to go back to the comfort foods that you can curl up to with a side of mashed potatoes.  Recipe makes great doubled and then you have left overs for the rest of the week.  My family agreed it tasted better the next day when it had the night to marinate.  Regardless, this is a nice easy meatloaf.  Also, I used less onion (purple) because we have picky eaters.  Also, it makes a difference when you take an older loaf of bread and cut it up and stick it in the oven to make your own bread crumbs.  Cooked it an additional 30 minutes (granted it was doubled) and covered it with foil and took off the foil the last 25 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe.

This meatloaf was really good. The only change I made was I doubled the ketchup and I had my brother and his family over and they love mushrooms (as does my family), so I added chopped baby portobello mushrooms. Everyone loved this meatloaf, I wish I had doubled the amount, it was gone so quick! Thanks so much Janet!

My husband and I love this recipe!! Of course we made it our own by adding extras we liked. For those to claim the meatloaf did not cook completley, all oven times vary. For me this meatloaf cooked completley at an hour and fifteen minutes. Thanks for this wonderful recipe I will be making this again and again. My kids and hubby love it!!

My husband loves meatloaf but I've never liked it. It never had enough flavor. I tried this recipe and I loved it! I did make a few changes. I left out the onions, used garlic seasoned bread crumbs, and instead of ketchup used barbeque sauce. I am actually cooking it again right now only this time I doubled the recipe! My husband finished it off in one sitting last time!

This was great!  I, along with majority of the reviewers, tweaked the recipe a tad.  I sauteed an onion and a diced green pepper.  I also threw in Italian seasoning and 1-2 tablespoons of soy sauce to the mix.  Also, taking the advice of other reviewers, I decided to use a different recipe for the glaze (one that was less sweet and more tangy).  Try this... 1 cup V8, 4 tablespoons brown sugar, and 2 tablespoon soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce.  Gave it a nice tangy flavor that wasn't overpoweringly sweet.  Next time, I will probably reduce the amount of milk used.  I served it with rosemary potatoes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love it!  Have made it several times already.  I omit the onions and it still comes out perfect!  It is my Husband's favorite dish, I always make extra topping on one side just for him too.  Fix it with a side of Mashed Potatoes (no gravy) ...it goes perfect!

This recipe was great. I substituted ground turkey for ground beef and I sauteed the onions with just a little bit of brown sugar. I also added about a tablespoon of worsteshire saure.

Very good recipe! I used an idea from a different recipe and added a bunch of mozzerella cheese, which was a great addition. I have made this a couple of times and always make sure to add a little bit of garlic and used seasoned bread crumbs for some extra flavor.

very basic recipe and yummy. I have made it several times. Either with ground turkey and pork, or ground beef and pork.  I use seasoned bread crumbs.  It always comes out great.

This was super easy and delicious.  I don't eat red meat so I used ground turkey instead.  I also added a bit of Worcestershire in the meat mixture and a little BBQ sauce to the topping.  I opted for crushed crackers crumbs and I think it gave it a little zing (they were flavored wheat crackers).  Yum yum!!

The taste was pretty good, although I found it to be too juicy or mushy. Might cut back on the milk and try it again!

the only thing I added was some worcestire sauce, but it was amazing either way!  I tend to double the recipe because my family is larger and we never have any of this meatloaf left over.

I liked this recipe and my kids loved it. I did a few changes like flavored bread crumbs and I added the worcestershire.  I also added about 1/4 lbs of sausage.  I accidentally forgot to put the sauce on while it was baking so I made it on the stove top and put it on.  It was wonderful.

This is the FIRST thing I have ever made that got three thumbs up from me, husband, and toddler son.  I did sautee the onions and add worcestershire sauce to the meat mix.  I am going to try raw onions next time, I think that would be good too.

I didn't use onions because my husband is allergic but otherwise followed the recipe as stated and it was pretty good.  I thought the mustard was a tad strong but my husband really enjoyed the flavor, he says it's not like the traditional meatloaf his Mother makes but he liked it a lot.  I give you his review over mine because it was only the second time I've ever had meatloaf but he rated it a 7 out of 10 and I also thought it was very good.  I ate mine with rice (I'm Persian so I tend to like rice with everything) he says had we made it with potatoes and gravy or something of that nature it would have been even better.

This is a great recipe, but in order for it to taste good YOU SHOULDN'T FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS EXACTLY. It needs some tweaking. The first time i made it, it was pretty disgusting how much liquid was leaking out of it. I like juicy meatloaf but it shouldn't be soupy! That was just way to much milk in addition to the worchester sauce. But since I added more seasons, garlic, onions, worchester sauce and it had good flavor so I tried it again. The 2nd time used a little less than 1/2 of the amount milk it calls for. I sauteed the onions with garlic & butter--as reviews suggested, more ketchup and less mustard. It turned out much much better.

I thought this was too moist.  Way too much liquid and not enough spice.  I did add the Worcestershire sauce like others suggested but it still needed more flavor.  I also sauteed the onions.  My husband loved it and gave it 5 stars...rare for him...but my rating was a 4 due to a little bit of lack of flavor.

Yummm!! Even my non-meatloaf loving husband liked it!  I didn't change the base recipe, only added a tangy topping to it of:  2 tbsp mustard, 2 tbsp brown sugar, and 1/3 cup ketchup, added this about half way through cooking.

Loverly, the concoction on the top made it smell wonderful whilst cooking. Update - this time around added some garlic,more onion and increased the sauce (minus the mustard and brown sugar, kept that as is) from a 4 to a 5!!!

I caramelized the onions w/ a little brown sugar and garlic before adding them to the meat mixture.  Also, I cut down on the milk by 30% and used a sirloin/turkey mixture of meat.  As noted by the other reviews, I doubled the sauce for the topping and used italian bread crumbs.  The meatloaf was very moist and very tasty!  Both my husband and I loved it.

Quick and easy. I didn't use the mustard/brown sugar/catsup sauce on the top. I just used catsup. The brown sugar sauce sounded a bit too sweet for our taste. Otherwise, it was moist and delish. I will definitely use the recipe again.

Oh My! This meatloaf was amazing!  The only thing I did different was I added the worcestershire suace to the ketchup mix only cause I forgot to add it to the meat mixture.  Oh I also doubled the ketchup mixture and that seemed plenty for me.  Great recipe!  I will definitly make this again.

This was very good.  I left out the onions, because we didn't have any in the house.  I used a little onion powder to make up for it.  My husband had seconds and my toddler ate her share.

This is a very easy to make and I usually double it so we have leftovers for sandwiches!  I started to add strips of bacon to cover the top for some extra flavor and also use seasoned bread crumbs and a couple cloves of garlic.  My husband loves it cold and 5yr old son will eat it which makes me happy!

Very yummy.  Most of the time I use store bread crumbs, but this time I used 3 shredded toasted slices of white bread and it was delicious.  I also added worcesteshire sauce and garlic powder.  Thanks!!!

Very simple and good. It's very moist. I didn't have enough of regular bread crumbs so I used japanese panko crust as well, and I think that made it more moist. I also decreased the kitchup in the topping mixture and mixed in some chili sauce. It gave it an extra zing !

I loved this meatloaf!  I did, however, make the changes that reviewers suggested which was to add the Worcestershire and cook the onions prior to adding.  I made this for my boyfriend who loves meatloaf and he was raving about it.  The topping is a nice touch and I did not make any changes to it as others suggested.  I used dijon mustard because that's what I had but it really tasted more like ketchup than anything else.  I plan on making this again and again.

Excellent. My girlfriend even said wow, we had it with a lovely gewurztraminer.  Didn't make the sauce for the top and used ketchup instead. Yummo.

I made this for dinner last night and it was really good!  I used italian bread crumbs, added green belt pepper, and green olives.  I also used a package of onion soup.  For the topping, I used ketchup, spicey mustard, a little brown sugar, a dash of soy sauce, and some tai peanut sauce. (I got a little crazy with the condiments!)  It's a great base recipe you can add too easily!

Excellent.  Perfect consistency.  I doubled the sauce, but next time I will reduce the amount of dried mustard, it came through a bit too much for some reason.

I left this recipe with my husband and asked that he make it before I got home from work. It was so easy even he could make it! Except that he made it in a 9x9 pan instead of a loaf pan. It still tasted great -- and made nice size slices for leftover meatloaf sandwiches.

I made this recipe one evening when I had hamburger meat I needed to use and had limited other ingredients on hand. My husband does not like meatloaf and he even liked this recipe. I use italian seasoned bread crumbs for more flavor. I tried doubling the sauce last time and it was a little too much, so next time I will stick with following the recipe.

I followed the recipe except I used a packet onion soup mix (which gave the meatloaf better flavor, I think. I substituted Boca meatless burger for ground beef. I also added some garlic salt, soy sauce, oregano and other spices to the bread cube/meat mixture. The mustard flavor was overpowering at first, but if you eat it for leftovers for a couple days, the flavors will blend and mellow out. Pretty good with ketchup.

I sauteed the onions before mixing them in, and I used Three Cheese Bread Crumbs for some flavor. I thought it was good but next time I will use a more lean ground beef so it's less greasy. I also would like the topping a little thicker. But overall, this recipe is a keeper and my husband thought it was great!

I made this recipe with my 7 year old niece, it was easy to make, and tasted good.  I do agree that the texture was a bit mushy and it could have used another egg or less bread.

Not only easy but DELICIOUS! I didn't have any bread or crackers but did have some left-over garlic bread sticks from Olive Garden. Just through them in the blender and in the meatloaf the bread crumbs went.

Did not care for the sauce on top AT ALL.  It didn't so much bake into the meat loaf as it sort of congealed on top of it.  Scraped most of it off as did the rest of my family.  Meat loaf itself was fine, basic meatloaf.

yummy and easy! I just finished eating this! oh my goodness! it was good! This was the first time I ever made meatloaf. I cooked the onion in a pan with butter and a clove of garlic until nice and golden. I made double the sauce for the meat loaf and added a teaspoon and a half of worcestershire sauce to the meat. I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I just placed  the meat mixture in the loaf pan and didn't press it too much so it came out loose, but good. Next time I will shape the loaf with my hands and press it together so it will come out whole when i cut it.   GOOD RECIPE! i will make this again!

I used this recipe for my first meatloaf and it came out quite good. The topping is what caught my eye. It was quite good and fast, but as I have cooked more and more, I do the meat differently now (add lipton onion soup mix, worcestershire sauce, green and/or red peppers, seasonings of choice) but I still come back for this topping. I double or triple the topping, reserving some to use in the last few minutes on broil to get it to "stick" to the loaf.

I didn't like meatloaf until I tried this recipe!  My whole family loves it, and always asks for it!  We've already made it twice!  I suggest adding about 15 minutes to the baking time because the center was a little too pink for my liking (nobody got sick, though!).

This is one of the moistest meatloafs. It also had the perfect amount of spices. Thank you for the recipe my family loved it.

My family loved this meatloaf.  Very easy to make.  I used 2 lbs hamburger and two eggs and a little extra bread crumbs. I did not use the peppers, but I did cook my onion (I also used garlic) in a pan with 2 tbsp of butter. I used a 9 x 13 pan and made two loaves. I did not make the sauce for on top because I was making gravy and mashed potatoes.  I am not a fan of meatloaf and thought it was ok.  I thought it was very good the next day cold on a sandwich.  Family gave thumbs up.  I will be making again.

My entire family loved this recipe, including my picky 7 year old daughter and my husband who has never liked meatloaf. I did make a few simple changes. I used 2 pounds of burger and I also tripled the sauce topping with adding a couple dashes of worcestershire and A1 sauce. I served mashed potatoes. 
This is a new family favorite!!

This was soooo good and easy.  I made as directed, except I saute the onions and I either add carrots or peppers (diced and sauted) in and it has been really good.  I don't make the topping though.

I make this at my school and the kids love it. I dice the onions really fine and sautee before adding to the mixture. I also use gravy instead of the making the sauce.

My family went crazy for this meatloaf.  The only things I altered were that I used catsup only on the top because that is what my daughter likes, I used lean ground beef as suggested by other reviewers and I used onion powder instead of an onion because heaven forbid my daughter should find an actual sliver of an onion in there.  I too found that it takes an hour and a half to bake.  This will be a staple around here this winter.

The search for the holy grail in meatloaf has been found!  What an EASY and truly delicious recipe.  I altered it by making it with the prepackaged 1/3 beef-1/3 veal-1/3 pork and it was succulent and delicious.  I can't wait to make my meatloaf sandwich for lunch tomorrow!

This was good. I will make it again. My kids liked it.  My son doesn't like the brown sugar in it, so I made half with and half without for the top of the meatloaf.  I like it sweet.

it could've been because my oven wasn't preheated enough, but even after an hour of cooking this meatloaf was still pink in the middle. however, once it was cooked all the way, it was quite delicious! my first attempt at a meatloaf and i was very pleased with the results.

Everyone loved this recipe!! I did follow the advice of others and it came out great.  I did change the dressing a bit, cut down the mustard, no brown sugar- instead I used Louisianna hot sauce (just a small amount) mixed with the ketchup and mustard.  Thanks!! Will make this one again soon.

This is the recipe I use. I also add a little sage. I also make mine into individual loafs instead of one big loaf. Works best for me, we live in high humidity and my meatloaf was always falling apart or not done on the inside? Making the smaller loafs works out perfect.

Great consistency & flavor!  My family loved it.  After starting I realized I was out of milk & had to use V8Juice.  Also, I mixed chopped green pepper with the onions & sauted them in olive oil before mixing.  Also used the suggestions to increase the sauce and line the pan with foil for easy clean-up.  Great!

This was very good and -go figure- easy. I do think that it should be more clear that it should be LEAN beef. I had 80/20 on hand and I had to drain it. As always, I tweaked it. I added part of an Italian soup mix... Next time I'll add Worcestershire, too. An all around good recipe, that can be easily tailored, which is what I go for. Only four stars because with regular ground beef it was soupy.

This was a good meatloaf! I agree with other comments that the ground beef needs to be lean, as my 1st attempt was very greasy. I think next time I will use more bread crumbs as a binding agent. My husband LOVED the sauce..nice and sweet/tangy, like he likes!

A perfect basic recipe.  Jazz it up however you want.  The texture is just perfect, and the glaze on top is wonderful.  We prefer the glaze at least doubled, but that's a preference thing.

The only thing I did differently was to double the topping as some of the other users had recommended.  This was very good.  Fast, simple, and delicious.
**I made this again and sauteed the onions in olive oil before adding to the meat mixture.  That made this so much better.  I recommend doing this!

Like many others, my husband is not a meatloaf sort of guy, but he LOVED this recipe! It really is very easy to make, and although I didn't have regular bread crumbs or crackers, I used Italian bread crumbs, and it still came out perfectly! Thank you!

My meatloaf usually sucks.  Or has my husband says I don't make it with any love.  Anyways it turned out really good.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and 1% milk.  I was little worried the mixture was too moist but it was very good.

Pretty good basic recipe for meatloaf, but it definitely needs a few more ingredients.  Even with lean beef, it is oily at the bottom.  There are few prominent flavors.  I am still looking for the perfect meatloaf recipe.

I've been looking for a "traditional" meatloaf recipe, and this one definitely seemed to have promise.  I followed the recipe as written but had to bake an extra 20 minutes.  It was nice and moist, but the glaze was way too sweet.  It was edible once we scraped the topping off.  Bottom line -- okay but not a search-ender.

OMG! (yeah, it is one of those moments)This is the best meatloaf I have ever had. My husband said, this recipe is a definite keeper. So moist, smooth, melts in your mouth. My adjustments: about 2-2.5 lb of lean beef; onion and half a shredded carrot sauteed in butter; one sleeve (makes a cup and 1/4) of crushed regular saltine crackers; 1 3/4 cups of milk; 2 eggs and some seasonong for beef, or meatloaf. I had to divide the mixture in 2 parts, or it wouldn't fit into 9x5 baking pan. Baked for an hour. Voila!!! Delish!!!

I added soya sauce, an extra onion, two cloves of garlic, and some thyme. I put less mustard in than the recipe called for and increased the amount of ketchup as suggested by others. I will definitely make this again! I might try adding some Worcestershire sauce if I have it next time!

This is the third time I've made this recipe, and it only gets better!
Like others, I added a splash of Worcesteshire and about a tsp of garlic salt.  
I won't use another recipe for meatloaf since finding this one.  The glaze is wonderful too!

This turned out fabulous! I had red and green peppers and some garlic in the fridge so I added those; and I used crackers instead of bread crumbs.

Fantastic meatloaf - a huge success.  Made a meatloaf sandwich for lunch, topped it with cheese and heated it.  It was excellent - especially since I never eat meatloaf sandwiches.

This was very very yummy!!! My family aren't meatloaf lovers, but this recipe was good enough for them. I put in raw onions, garlie and them worchester sauce. I loved the sauce on top. Next time, I am going to double the topping!!!

I've done bunch of little tweaks to this one, the 5 stars is with my additions/subtractions.  1. 2 lbs of ground beef 2. Garlic minced and mixed in 3. Garlic sliced and stuck all over the top and sides 4. About half the brown sugar than the recipe states, there's enough sugar in the ketchup for our taste 5. Sauteed onions 6. Italian seasoned breadcrumbs.

This was wonderful.  I tripled it (large family) and made 2 loaves.  The only thing I tried was changing the milk to beef broth.  I can't leave well enough alone.  My wife and kids (young and adult) love this!

I have been looking for a meatloaf recipes that I would enjoy "almost" as much as my Mom's recipe.. this one fit the bill.  I did change a couple of items.. I used liquid honey instead of brown sugar and also changed the mustard to French's Sweet Onion mustard.  I would reduce the honey & mustard next time... this is a keeper!!!

I chose this recipe for my first attempt at meatloaf because it was easy... and it definitely didn't dissapoint! I used less milk and added some worcestershire sauce as recommended by others. It came out delicious and moist, and the coating had a great kick/sweetness to it. I'll make it again and again!

Didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped. Next time I will probably take some of the ketchup sauce and mix it in with the meat before baking. My son (who hates meat) ate this up, so I will definitely make this again.

I used a combination of lean ground turkey and lean ground beef.  Instead of bread crumbs I used saltine crackers (what I had on hand).  This was the best meatloaf!

I've been making this recipe for a few years and still love it!! The sauce is excellent and meatloaf turns out perfect. We don't like onions so I leave that out but other than that I make it just like it says. Will continue to make for several years! Thanks.

Excellent recipe!  I would definitely make this again.  I did do a few different things than the recipe call for... I added baby portabello mushrooms, VERY finely chopped because I have to try and hide veggies to get my kids to eat them (I put them in my mini food processor).  I also used a red onion and chopped it up in my mini food processor.  I used japanese panko bread crumbs which have become the bread crumb of my choice for all my cooking.  I followed the advice of others and made additional topping (1 1/2 times) and cooked it for an hour and a half.  I think next time I will bake at 375 or 400 to decrease cooking time.  I also used parchment paper on a lipped cookie sheet and it worked perfect.  This recipe is an excellent base to adding different things to your meatloaf.  It was so good that my 1 1/2 year old ate enough for 2 adults (and he doesn't eat many things!).

I loved this, my husband who can't stand dishes like meatloaf (hence why I never make it), and who made fun of me when he heard we were having it, actually went back for seconds!  I will make this again.  Maybe even my picky toddler will eat some.

I was looking for a 'new' way to make meatloaf and have found a keeper!  My stepson went back for seconds and he's a very picky eater!  I did take a couple suggestions from some others on the site.  I added garlic and sauteed with the onions in butter prior to adding to mixture.  Also, added about 1/4 cup of parseman cheese and increase the eggs to 2.  After letting the meatloaf sit for about 10 minutes, I began to cut into slices and remembered that I didn't add the milk.  Actually did not need the milk.  Very moist and delicious!!!  Definetely a keeper!  Thanks!!

My whole family loved this meatloaf. I did add a couple of cloves of garlic and used organic whole wheat flour in place of bread crumbs. I also added chicken sausage with the ground meat. Every time I seem to cook meatloaf it always takes 2 hours instead of one. This one was no different.

As I was preparing the ingredients for this meatloaf recipe, I realized that the milk I had had gone bad. I had already mixed most of the ingredients so it was too late to wait. I had a little bit of heavy cream in the fridge and ended up using that. I used 1/4 cup of heavy cream and 1/4 cup of white cooking wine! I also added some thin sliced/ chopped green pepper- I would say about a 1/4 cup. I used shallots instead on onions just because I like them better. This came out delicious. My boyfriend moaned mmmmmmm all through the meal! Like lasagna, I think it's hard to ruin meatloaf!

This was my second attempt at meatloaf and it turned out excellent! I did make several changes - I added about a tablespoon of minced garlic, a handful of parmesan cheese, and some worstershire sauce. When I make it again I'm going to add even more garlic (the onion flavor was stronger than the garlic and my personal preference is to have a stronger garlic flavor). 

The glaze for the top didn't sound very appealing to me since I'm not a big fan of sweet foods. I made my own sauce with a can of condensed tomato soup, about a half a cup of sour cream, and some worstershire sauce. It was delicious!

I rated it 4 stars because the flavor would have been a little bland without the extra additions and it took much longer to cook than stated. Plan on at least an extra half hour in the oven.

Very easy.  Next time I will use a little less bread crumbs, then it will be a 5 star.  It was just a bit mushy from too many breadcrumbs IMHO.

Almost as good as mom's!  I also sauteed the onions, added 1 T of worcestershire sauce, used 2 lbs of beef, 1 1/4 milk, 1 1/4 cup bread crumbs.  I also used 4 T brown sugar, 1 T mustard and 2/3 cup ketchup.  It took 1 1/2 hours at 350 degrees convection oven.  My husband enjoyed it!

Delicious and simple.  I did make a few changes though.  I used ground turkey and instead of bread crubs, I crushed up premade garlic croutons.  I sauteed onions and garlic like other reviewers suggested.  My husband is a meatloaf connesiour and he loved it.

Perfect meatloaf.  I made it with ground chuck and torn up French bread.  I love it, and think that kids will, too.  Sandwiches should be great.  I've only been looking for 35 years for a really good meatloaf!  This is it.  Thanks.

Very good and easy. Softened the onions, added a tsp of garlic powder and 2 TBS of worcester sauce and combined all ingredients together.  Formed 2 meatloaves and baked on a baking tray for 1 hour. Delicious - thanks for the recipe.

Good and easy.I think I would add a tad less milk and maybe more bread crumbs.It was a little runny, the onion amt could be cut in half,also I added a little bit of barbecue sauce to the topping.But it was really good!

This is the third time I have made this. Everytime it is a hit, but I did use half the onions, and boyfriend wanted me to put tomato sauce on it instead of the ketchup mixture. He said that the ketchup mixture made it too. "ketchuppy" whatever that means.

I make my meatloaf this way all the time and there is never any left overs. The only thing I do differently is just a bit moire ketchup and mustard and brown sugar (all to taste). You can even do individual meeatloaves on top of the stove the same way. I add a little water to the sause when I make them on top of the stove. You can even top them with cheese or any of your faEvorite toppings. My family just loves meatloaf made this way.

Yummy!  This was good as far as meat loaf goes.  I omitted the onions, because we hate them in our house, and added a clove of mince garlic.  I also used buttery cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs, other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out good.  The glaze was AWESOME, YUMMY, and TASTY.  It for sure made the meat loaf.

Great starter recipe. It was delicious. My family really enjoyed it. I doubled the recipe, split it into two loaf pans and topped one loaf with sliced bacon and the other with the glaze. Didn't have bread crumbs so I used crushed Ritz cracker which added a nice buttery touch to it. For the glaze, I used Dijon mustard and it came out great. We like garlic in our house so I put four cloves finely minced. Served with roasted veggies and smashed potatoes. Will definitely be making again.

great meatloaf and easy to make variations with. like other reviewers had mentioned, the ketchup/b.sugar/mustard combo was a little sweet, but definitely tweakable when i go to make again.

Quick and easy recipe.  I used 97/3 beef and it turned out excellent.  Didn't hold together well as it was very juicy.  Topping made it great.

I cooked mine 1.5 hours.

Very easy to make and very yummy! I also made a couple of alterations: added extra onions, dried parsley, I didn't have breadcrumbs so I used garlic croutons (put it in the blender).  DH & picky eater DS (2 yo) loved it! If there's any other changes, I would double the sauce/topping. This recipe is a keeper!

Great meatloaf!  I have cooked meatloaf for years, and it was always left to chance whether or not it would stay in the form of a loaf.  This recipe held together perfectly!    I added a can of diced tomatoes with green peppers to the mixture for more taste.  Wonderful taste!

Followed the recipe exactly, and i wasn't impressed with it. The meat had no flavour, and the sauce on top didn't make it much difference either. Wouldn't try this again. Sorry!

My husband and I loved this!! It was my first time trying to make meatloaf, and I was surprised it turned out so well!! I will definately make this again, but next time with a little fresh garlic and garlic salts! This is a good recipe for a beginner cook like myself.

This is the best meatloaf!  I've made it several times; now I use a frozen onion and pepper mix instead of the fresh onion (I hate chopping onions).  Takes no time to prepare.  Also I NEVER use a loaf pan for meatloaf, this one holds its shape great without.

This was very easy to make, moist, stayed together and was great when heated up a second night, always a plus!

Easy to adapt as well! You could easily change up the dry ingredients and topping so you would never get bored!

This recipe is excellent.  Everyone in the family really enjoyed it.  I forgot to add the salt and pepper to taste, but it turned out great anyway!  It did need to be cooked a little bit longer - maybe 20 minutes or so.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

My husband loves meatloaf; I don't care for it in any, way, or form but I like to try recipes for him.  I decreased the breadcrumbs as suggested by other reviewers and feel I could have decreased a little more.  Used 85%lean.  I prepared this the night before and let it set in the fridge.  I did love the sauce.  I added some to the meatloaf mixture and on top reserving 1 heaping servingspoonful.  10 min. before finished, I added the remaining sauce.  The sauce was not too sweet, not too tart; a good balance.  I also liked the fact that it made plenty for me to put in the loaf plus on top.  Even after sitting in the fridge overnight, although good, the loaf itself needs a little something more but this serves as a good base.  I would make again.

I made this recipe and it recieved rave reviews. I did however add 3 tsp of ground cumin and 3 tsp of dried leaf oregano. It was excellent, my complements to Janet.

My husband and I loved the flavor!  Very moist, too.  Better than my old meatloaf recipe.

This was the best meatloaf I've ever had. I found it moist and sweet, but not too sweet. I had run out of milk so used some BBQ sauce and water instead. This was the first time I had made meatloaf so I think next time I would not add the water just the BBQ sauce. My husband found it a little sweet but still enjoyed it so i might reduce the sugar for him next time.

This was a pretty good meatloaf. I mixed ground beef and pork together, and it came out good. Next time I don't know if I will use as much milk though.

My husband loves this recipe.  I also just made it for a friend who just lost a family member and had a lot of guests at her house.  They all loved it, as well.It's very easy to put together with simple ingredients.  I also had no problem turning it into a meal for a lot of people.
