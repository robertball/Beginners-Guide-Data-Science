This is a great basic recipe but with a few touches it is elegant. First, make duxelles for the stuffing (sauteed finely chopped mushrooms with shallots) and then add about a couple of tablespoons of white wine and let that get absorbed. No breadcrumbs. Either slice the chicken in half horizontally or pound it flat or both before you stuff it. Roll the chicken up then brush it with olive oil or butter then roll it in the breadcrumbs mixed with grated parmesan cheese, 1/2 tsp. paprika and 1/2 tsp. thyme. Then pour the cream and bake! Yum!

I made this exactly as MICHELLECA suggested and it was absolutely a five-star, fine restaurant quality dish! I minced the mushrooms and onions, and added some chopped garlic--cooked this in the 1/4 c. butter till dark, several minutes, then deglazed the pan with a splash of wine until it was absorbed and the mixture resembled a paste (added NO bread crumbs).  I actually forgot about the nutmeg, but we didn't miss it. I pounded the chicken breasts to about 1/4" thickness, then rolled them up with the mushroom mixture. I coated the chicken with melted butter, then in a mixture of plain bread crumbs mixed with a couple tablespoons of Parmesan cheese. Poured the cream over, and then baked at 375 degrees rather than 350. I served this with green beans and "Sun-Dried Tomato Basil Orzo," also from this site. Hubby specifically REQUESTED that we have the leftovers again for dinner tomorrow night! Thanks to both Jennifer and MICHELLECA for this fabulous dish. My suggestion?....please don't ruin this wonderful recipe with canned, cream of mushroom soup. Make it as the recipe directs, by just pouring the cream over all. It might sound unusual, but believe me, it turns into something truly wonderful, and you won't be disappointed!

I followed other people's suggestions and chopped the mushrooms up very small, added chopped spinach, pounded the chicken, no vinegar, brushed on olive oil on the outside of the chicken and then rolled in breadcrumbs.  My side dish was portebello mushroom risotto and roasted vegetables.  It was a great meal!!  My husband was shocked when he cut into it!  This is a keeper!

I would give the "version" that I made 5 stars.  I used this recipe as a base, for what I was actually looking for in this recipe. 
  I ended up cooking the mushrooms, in butter and white wine, along with minced garlic and onion.  I butterflied and stuffed the chicken breasts.   And then....I put a little butter in the pan, used for the mushrooms and added some cream of mushroom soup, cream and wine.  I whisked these together and topped the chicken with the cream mixture.
  When the chicken was cooked, I poured off the cream/cream of mushroom mixture, back into the sauce pan....and added a little more ingredient to thicken it, into a gravy type sauce.  It was AWESOME!  
  I will definitely make this again...and play around with the ingredients.  It just seemed too bland, topped merely with cream.

This was the first time I tried to make stuffed chicken...I was a little nervous but it turned out fantastic!  We added fresh garlic, onion and chopped spinach to the mushrooms and sauteed.  We tenderized the chicken to make it easier to roll up, which worked great!  The nutmeg is great with spinach so don't omit it!!!  This is so good we're making it again tomorrow for my mother in-law for Mother's Day.  Thanks for the great idea!

I don't see how these could be made without first pounding the chicken flat.  I pound mine flat which made it easier to roll.  I also put my mushrooms in the food processor and chopped them really fine.  I rolled the chicken and secured with toothpicks and cooking twine.  I left out the nutmeg and the cream.  I spread a can of cream of mushroom soup in the baking dish before adding the chicken rolls.   I served with wild rice.

Easy to make and impressive enough to serve to guests.  I followed previous advice and chopped the mushrooms very finely and pounded the chicken breasts, which were valuable suggestions.  My guest loved it!

After reading all the reviews- I got so many ideas- I just went with them.  I changed quite a few things and we were very pleased with the dish.  Briefly; I sauteed onion, garlic, a vegetable broth cube, a splash of red wine, in with the mushrooms. I added a couple of tablespoons of sour cream in the stuffing mixture.  I put a slice of asiago cheese over the rolled chicken breast, and topped it with a mixture of cream of mushroom soup and cream. Also added a few extra spices here and there.  It is now in our "hall of fame" the tried and true regular recipes that we make all the time!

Oh my goodness! This is dish is so wonderful. I am really glad that I tried this tonight. It is so moist, tender and full of flavor.  I then thinly sliced the baby bella mushrooms and added it to a skillet with 1/4 cup of butter. I added some chopped shallots, i garlic, minced. I cooked this down then added some white wine. I seasoned this with salt, black pepper, a little nutmeg, and a little bread crumbs. I let this mixture cool down a bit. Next, I pounded the chicken down to 1/4 inch thickness. I sprinkled a bit of salt and black pepper. I spooned the mixture into the chicken breast, rolled it up then inserted a toothpick inside the chicken. I rolled each piece of chicken into melted butter then into the bread crumbs which I added some parmesan cheese too. I placed the chicken into a baking pan and poured some cream over it. I set the oven to 375 and baked it, uncovered,  for about 25-30 minutes. The top of the chicken was a nice golden brown with the bread crumbs giving the chicken an even coating of golden breading. The taste of the mushrooms, cheese and sauce was so delicious. Nothing overpowered each other at all. I loved the cream sauce which I spooned over onto my chicken. I served this alongside with, Sun Dried Tomato and Basil Orzo, " also from this website. This was just an awesome meal. This is defintely going to be a repeat meal in my house.

I prepared this dish tonight for a nice quiet dinner at home. Since there are only two of us, I halved the recipe. I did alter the original version and it still turned out wonderfully. 

My changes resulted from the realization that I was out of nutmeg and heavy cream. So, deciding to go in a more savory direction, I added finely chopped onion, fresh garlic, and a couple of dashes of dried basil to the stuffing. As some of the other reviewers suggested, I chopped the mushrooms up well so that they would reduce to a finer texture, which eased spreading in the butterflied, tenderized, chicken breasts.

Since heavy cream was not available, I improvised by making a basic béchamel sauce. Before adding the flour and milk, I sautéed a very thinly sliced mushroom in the butter. I finished the sauce by stirring in about a tablespoon of dried basil before pouring over the stuffed breasts. 

I served this as shown in the photo, sliced into rounds with additional sauce drizzled over them; a beautiful presentation that tasted just as good as it looked. The warm tones of the basil playing against the savory mushroom onion stuffing were absolute heaven.

This is definitely going into my regular rotation. Thanks for a terrific and inspiring recipe!

I made this dish the other night for dinner, but I modified the recipe somewhat.  I only used 3 chicken breasts, instead of 6 but I used the whole amount of stuffing.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added about 3 large cloves of garlic, a medium onion and a splash of red wine to the mushroom mixture while sauteeing.  I also added less bread crumbs (2/3 cup at most).  Before stuffing the breasts with the mushroom mixture, I put a few tbsp of cream cheese in each breast and then placed the mushrooms on top and rolled up.  For the "sauce", I combined about a half a can of cream of mushroom soup which I had leftover with about 1/2 cup of 10% cream.  I poured the sauce over the breasts and then aprinkled with bread crumbs and baked at 350 for about 40 minutes.  The end result was quite tasty and we will likely make again.  However, there was not enough sauce for us, I would double the ingredients for this next time (there was barely enough to pour over the chicken).

Very very good. However, I did add some wine with the mushrooms, as well as garlic, onions and parmesan cheese. To the roll ups I added, a can of mushroom soup, a little of heavy cream, because I had it on hand,( next time I would add some milk to make it thinner) and some more wine. Sprinkled with some fresh parsley for color. The sauce was fab and so was the chicken. I did however use chicken tenderloins and pounded them out a bit, just to absorb the great flavors. Thank You for Sharing

This is a good recipe. My family loves it. The chicken always comes out tender. I add a little powdered clove to the nutmeg. Before adding the mushroom mix on the chicken, I spread a thin layer of cream cheese on the breast (i mix fresh thyme in the cream cheese and soften it slightly before spreading). This dish is always a hit when I make it.

These were pretty good--I omitted the nutmeg and added crushed garlic.  Probably not something I would make often.

This was a really good dish.  I added a little garlic to the mushroom mixture to add a little flavor, but next time I would not use the nutmeg.  I will make this one again!

I chopped the mushrooms really fine and then sauteed then with lots of garlic and white wine. After I rolled up the chicken I dreged in a beaten egg, then rolled in bread crumbs, and browned in a frying pan before I put it in the oven.  I also skipped the cream and opted for cream of mushroom soup instead.  It was really good especially served with a mushroom risotto as a side dish. Definetly pound the chicken first!

My husband  loved this dish! I was so so about it. I changed the recipe up a bit. I sauted onions, garlic, and the mushrooms. I used baby portebella mushrooms they are usually more flavorful. Finally i substituted soy milk for heavy cream. Presentation is indeed impressive however, the chicken tasted a bit bland to my liking.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I didn't like it too much.  The chicken came out very moist, but the nutmeg was very overpowering.  I filleted the chicken almost all the way through and laid it open to put the bread crumb mixture in it; that worked out well.  If I make this again I will not use nutmeg.

I wanted to like this recipe. It was just... kinda bland. I found the technique of just "pouring" the wet ingreds made it... soggy.

Oh Lord.  We loved this one.  I split my chicken breast in half and pounded down, added fresh basil and mozzerella (not shredded) on top of mushroom mixture.  Used light cream and more nutmeg than suggested, I also added a little parmesan cheese to the cream.  Delish. The chicken was so juicy and the mushroom stuffing was excellent. "Keeper" per my family and I.

I couldn't believe that I made this!  It is so easy, and the mushroom stuffing would be perfect for lots of other meats.  I processed the mushrooms first, used garlic, and omitted the nutmeg (cause I had none), and used thin-sliced cutlets, and it was perfect!  I also replaced the heavy cream with cream of chicken w/mushroom soup, and it made the perfect gravy for potatoes.  Thanks so much for this excellent recipe!

FANTASTIC!!!!

The only tips I have are...

Pound out the chicken breasts - I don't know how you'd roll them otherwise.

Also, and I found this out by accident.  Use a Cuisinart or something to really really chop up those mushrooms to an almost paste.  Made the mushroom mixture kind of peanut butter consistency and PERFECT to spread on the breast.

This is a "company dish" for the non-cooks out there like me!!!  Impressive big time.

The recipe doesn't call for it, but I flattened the chicken breasts a little first before filling them with the mushroom mixture.  Next time I may use cream of mushroom soup instead of the heavy cream to give it a richer flavor.  Otherwise, they were good and would make a nice dinner for company.

Very much like an old tried and true Fanny Farmer recipe that I make now and again. I use Italian Style bread crumbs and no nutmeg.

AMAZINGLY delicious!!  We make extra of everything to freeze so we can pop them into the oven for easy week night dinners - they did NOT make it to the freezer, we ended up cooking them all and ate them for 2 days lunch and dinner.

I made this recipe twice now. The first time I made it, I butterflied the chicken breast . The second time around I went ahead and took a mallet to it. Either way it tasted good but something must be done in order to roll the chicken breast effectively. The cream sauce was decent but definitely needs some more flavors added.
Thank you for sharing!

I followed the suggestions from the reviewers MICHELLECA and Naples 34102 and this turned out very good.  I did cut back on the butter to 3 T (instead of 4 T) and used whole milk (instead of the heavy cream) with good results.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I did make a few changes as many others did do to dietary needs.  I added 1 clove of garlic and a splash of pino grigio to the mushroom filling and decreased the amount of breadcrumbs to just enough to bind the mixture.  I mixed cornflake crumbs and parmesan cheese for the coating and instead of using butter to coat the chicken I brushed on some olive oil.  I used 1 can fat free cream of mushroom soup, 1/3 can white wine, 1/3 can fat free half and half, a pinch of nutmeg,and threw in a handful of sliced fresh mushrooms to make the sauce.  It was sinfully good using the lower fat healthy ingredients and 1 chicken breast fed my husband and I.  I served it with a side of spinach and whole grain bread.  It was so economical, easy, healthy and delicious when you do a few change in ingredients.  I can only imagine how good it would be the original way with the butter and cream but I had way too much of that over the Holidays and now must pay the price.  Thanks for sharing I can't wait to share it with my friends.

Very bland! The mushroom stuffing was OK (I added some garlic to it) but the plain cream sauce was so boring & tasteless. Needs much more flavour added. I didn't bother breading the chicken as I felt there was enough fat without adding the extra butter.

This was excellent! I followed the advice of others and included spinach as well as onion, garlic and a little red wine to the mushrooms while they were cooking. I also added a can of mushroom soup and more red wine to the cream and poured all on top. Absolutely delicious!! You can't go wrong with this one.

This one's a keeper! I made it for my monthly "Lunch Bunch" group & everyone loved it. I did add finely chopped onions & sauteed them w/ the mushrooms for extra flavor. Next time I will also add some chopped garlic. I also added some of my favorite seasonings, like garlic pepper, instead of plain black pepper. I made sure the mushrooms were finely chopped in order to roll it into the chicken better. Definitely added to my recipe box!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I must admit that I'm not patient enough for all the pounding and stuff so I just cut it half lengthwise, laid the mushroom mixture on one half, then closed it over. No toothpicks or anything. I added garlic and diced onion. The chicken was juicy, the filling was flavorful. What else can a busy mom ask for? :)

Another Allrecipes success!!!!! I went against the reviews and coursely chopped the mushrooms. I felt by doing this the breadcrumbs wouldn't get lost in the mushroom mixture and it would give you a nice texture. Pounded my breasts to make it easier to roll. Instead of just throwing breadcrumbs on top before baking, I used the leftover mushroom breadcrumb mixture (more interesting). Upon first tasting the chicken, I was a bit disappointed but then I decided to try the sauce with the chicken. What two different tastes! Then, I added a splash of white wine and mixed it all together. Even better! I cannot wait to make this again. It was simple and elegant.

I found this recipe to be boring, but I prefer more exotic tastes.  As per other suggestions, i omitted the nutmeg and added garlic.  I probably won't make this again, it seemed to be nothing special.

This dish is delicious.  I made some changes the 2nd time I made this recipe.  Instead of bread crumbs, I used Panko with ground pistachio nuts mixed in.  Also, I added some finely chopped shallots, onions & garlic (from Trader Joes) while cooking the mushrooms.  I didn't add the bread crumbs to the mushroom mixture instead I added a small amount of cream sherry and cooked the mixture until the liquid was absorbed.   Lastly, I added 1-2 tablespoons of cream sherry and a little bit of salt to the cream before pouring over the chicken.  It is our new favorite meal.

Very good recipe.  Takes longer than it states but it is good.  Did not add the nutmeg and I used seasoned bread crumbs.  As another person said -please don't use cream of mushroom soup.  I used heavy whipping cream and it was great

Wow, what a delightful recipe!  I read a ton of review before making, and i only added a slight variation from the original.  I cooked the mushrooms in butter with a tsp of cavendar's seasoning (i put this on mushrooms regularly) instead of what other reviews suggested.  I also omitted the nutmeg.  Make sure and pound out the breast very thin if you intend to roll it up.  I attempted to half this, and i had way too much filling and so i made ugly chicken baskets stuffed full.  I thought the bread crumbs were just fine in the filling, it tasted like mushroom rolls that my family loves!  I will definately be making again.

Extremely delicious! Looks fancy without a lot of effort. I pretty much followed the directions as stated except, I used shitake mushroomas as my local grocery store is pitiful when it comes to produce. I also followed the one person who added the shallot and did the deglazing with the white wine. I put the cream on at the beginning of cooking, but would highly recommend doing it 10 minutes prior to completion in order to prevent curdling, still tasted great.   As a side note, I had leftover mushrooms. So a few days later I made the mixture again but then added bleu cheese to it and stuffed it into  hamburger and grilled them they were AWESOME!! Both the 2-year old boy and the husband liked them, UNBELIEVABLE!!

I added onion and garlic and some more mushrooms. EXCELLENT! I had to use half and half which I put in the pan I sauteed my mushroom mix in to get brown bits.  I had some personal problems with rolling the chicken halves so I pounded them a little. I had no nutmeg, which is a huge bummer-it would have been perfect in this.  Next time, I'll add some creamcheese to the chicken before stuffing and rolling for extra creaminess. In a pinch, one can of cream of mushroom soup could work, and add milk to it.  Great go-to recipe! You can do so much with this.

I thought this was a very flavorful, moist dish, however, my daughter can't have lactaid, thus, we didn't use the cream and it turned out just as great.

After reading several pages of reviews I figured my alterations and proceeded.  I give this a solid 4 stars with the changes I developed. ALTERATIONS: Finely diced 1/2# button mushrooms (would have used cremini if I had them). In 2 Tbsp butter, sauteed mushrooms with salt and pepper until most moisture cooked off.  Added 1 medium minced shallot, 3  pressed garlic cloves, and 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning; cooked about 3 minutes to lightly soften the shallots/garlic.  Added 1/4 C white wine and cooked until evaporated.  Off heat, added 1/4 C panko and 1/4 C shredded asiago.  Halved 2 breasts horizontally, salt & peppered, then filled & rolled with the mushroom mixture (4 rolls total). Placed rolls in a square pyrex dish, dropping remainder mushroom mix around them, and poured 1 1/4 C half-and-half over and around the rolls (fewer calories than cream). Topped the entire dish with another 1/4 C each panko and asiago. Pulled out after 30 minutes, removed rolls from the dish, and whisked 1/2 tsp of cornstarch to help thicken the sauce a bit.  Very, very good.

Very simple to make. The chicken came out moist and the mushroom flavor was good. But next time I make it, I will add more spices and salt... the cream really neutralizes a lot of the pop.

What an excellent and impressive dish!  It is quite time consuming, for a new 'cook' like myself, but it was well worth the result.  I made a few personal alterations, such as chopping the mushrooms in a chopper.. until they were almost powdery.  Then, I sauteed with the butter, while adding minced garlic and finely chopped onion.  This made an excellent paste and quite simple to spread on the chicken.  I also flattened the chicken breasts to make for an easier assembly.  I put a tiny smear of cream cheese on half the breast (cheese lover here!).  Once done, I sprinkled with a bit of paprika for color.  Served with steamed zucchini and spinach.  Delicious!  This has become a permanent addition to my binder!  THANK YOU!

We really enjoyed this for dinner. It was easy to prepare and very tasty. I didn't end up making all the chicken with it so I had some extra stuffing which I baked in the dish as well - and we put that on top of our baked chicken when we ate. I would surely make this again.

Excellent and surprisingly easy dish. I sprinkled the chicken with dried oregano, basil, and garlic powder which added a really nice flavor.  I wasn't quite able to make it look like the picture, but it tasted fantastic!

I love this recipie.  I do pound the chicken to flatten (this is easier if you cut lengthwise half way through the chicken in the thickest part).  However the recipie takes no time to make and is beautiful.  The cream thickens nicely and compliments the stuffing without any additions.

Presentation was 5 stars, no doubt!  What an easy way to make yourself look like you know what you're doing.  Flavor was pretty good but the second time I made this, I upped the seasonings a bit and left out the nutmeg because it just wasn't to my family's tastes (thus the 4 stars).  Thanks for the great recipe.

Yummmmm! This recipe was wonderful! I simply sliced, lengthwise, my chicken breasts instead of pounding or flattening. It worked beautifully. I, too, added garlic to my mushroom saute, in addition to some fresh spinach (for added taste and vitamins). I opted to leave the nutmeg in, and thought the extra flavor was nice. I also put the whole mushroom mix in my food processor to make it easier to "spread" the mix on the chicken. My boyfriend loved it and asked me to make this again when his parents visit! Thank you Jennifer!

This was excellant! I too pounded the breast and put mushrooms in food processor. I also omitted the nutmeg. I sauteed the mushroon with garlic and marsala wine and used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream. My husband loved and even shared the leftovers with his boss the next day for lunch!

Great by making a few changes. I pounded the chicken breats, added garlic to mushrooms, left out bread crumbs in stuffing.  Also increase the amount of mushrooms, with a 1/2 pd I only had enough filling for 4 chicken breasts.

Excellent recipe, however, I did make a few changes.  We did not like the breadcrumbs in the stuffing and just use sauteed mushrooms, but still covered the chicken in breadcrumbs.  Also added garlic when sauteeing as we are a garlic loving family.  It turned out excellent.

This recipe was very good - I made a few changes.  I used thigh chicken meat 
pounded to 1/4" thick.  This made it very moist.  Also instead of heavy cream I 
used a can of Golden Mushroom soup, and instead of butter I used margarine. 
Also I did not add any additional margarine on top.
I tried someone else's suggestion for pureeing the mushroom mixture and it was
very easy to roll in the chicken.  I served with rice.  It was a big hit with the family - 
ranging from 13-5.

This is stupendous.  Both the hubby and I loved it.  Only did 4 split breasts since it's only the 2 of us so I had some extra mushroom stuffing which I put over the top of the rollups instead of the rest of the bread crumbs.  It looked really nice and gave a great flavor to the cream sauce/gravy.  Will be serving the leftover sauce over rice when we eat the other 2 rollups.  Thanks for a great recipe Jennifer.

Oh, yum! I went into this recipe thinking that I was going to have a frustrating time getting the chicken to role up. While it didn't go awesomely, it was still pretty easy to do. The taste of this recipe is just delicious. At first I thought, "Heavy cream? Just drenched over everything. . . mmmmmm??" But it was a great idea. I added one chopped shallot to the mushrooms and added sherry, because I didn't have any white wine (as was suggested by MICHELLECA). So good! I'll look forward to making this again some day.

I made a couple changes (of course) and it was delicious. Maybe better suited for a fall dish since it was kind of heavy. I sauted the mushrooms with red onion and grated zucchini (my kids are on a zucchini kick), added about a 1/4 c of cornbread stuffing mix since I ran out of breadcrumbs, and 1/2 c of freshly grated parmesean cheese. Then before plating I topped with a melted gouda redux (don't know what to call it- butter, gouda, milk, and some nutmeg). My two picky eaters got seconds :) This recipe was a very good base. Thank you.

This recipe seems to taste just wonderful no matter what! I didn't have the chance to pound the chicken breast this last time so I just placed the stuffing in the fold of the meat--just superb! I also make a little bit more of the stuffing and use it instead of the plain bread crumbs to sprinkle on the breasts with the cream before cooking. This is such an easy fool-proof dish that I also prepare in advance and refrigerate before cooking--I only add the cream before placing it in the oven. I've also decided to use half and half cream to reduce the calorie content without affecting the taste. 5 star!

Very good recipe!!  I did cook the bacon in the microwave for a few minutes before wrapping around the chicken.  These are even better the next day, the flavors have time to mingle.  Very versatile recipe.

I was excited to try this recipe, and I had high hopes, but I didn't care for the taste. It was bland (even though I used cremini {baby portabella} mushrooms) and not worth the effort. The "sauce" was very boring, too. Neither  my husband nor I liked this one, and I won't make it again without significant changes.

Very good.  Made the small addition of minced red onion (I would have used shallots, if I had some) and sliced mushrooms in the pan.  I used a mini chopper to mince the onions and mushrooms for the stuffing.  I will make this again, for company.

This recipe was great. It had a nice flavor and I gave it to my kids and told them that it was italian chicken. They ate it up without even being aware of the mushrooms. I actually stuffed boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of as wraps but the chicken still ended up juicy and tender. I might add some cranberries to the stuffing for next time as a holiday favorite for a turkey and I served it with walnut and raisin couscous. We'll definatly make this again.

When I made these the first time, they were very bland and somewhat dry. I ended up freezing most, so I gave the leftovers a makeover when they thawed. I made cuts in each piece then coated them with a vodka sauce and sprinkled mozz cheese and baked until heated thru. It was much better this way.

So glad I found this one!  I was making a different recipe off of this site (Chicken with Mushrooms), and I remembered how tasty this one was, but I wasn't sure if I had found it on AllRecipes or not.  This recipe is delicious, definitely something you can serve to guests at a nice dinner party.  Ends up looking and tasting fancy, but it's not too much work!  The taste of it is so rich.

Very good. Added 2 garlic cloves, deglazed pan with wine, omitted nutmeg, mixed with mozerella cheese when done. Delicious! Cooked for 30-35 min at 375 Degrees.

I am a beginner cook and even this wasn't too hard to make!  I added garlic and onion to the filling as others had suggested and it tasted great!  I could not find bread crumbs so I crushed up some croutons instead.  The only recommendation for someone making this would be to slit the chicken in 2 to make sure that the chicken is skinny enough to roll.  Otherwise, great recipe!

Taste was good, but next time I'll be sure to pound it out a lot thinner... Flavors went well, but it wasn't as robust as I would have liked.  I like foods with a lot of flavor and more saltiness.  Will make it again though, and figure out how to tweak it a little.

An excellent recipe.  I put a quarter of a small onion, garlic clove and mushrooms into food processor which I spread on chicken along with feta with a tsp of poultry seasoning (basically sage).  Took the esay root and just poured heavy cream and baked.  My family ate a double batch.  Thanks !!!!

I made this for our anniversary dinner.  It was delicious!!! I seasoned the chicken breast and added some cream cheese like others said and was wowed by the recipe.  I also added cream of mushroom to the whipping cream.  This one is a keeper.

This was so good and flavorful. I used a little of the heavy cream but also addded cream of mushroom soup on top of the chicken and it was great. I added some onions and fresh garlic while cooking the mushrooms. I will definetly make again.

I'm going to have to work on this one. My family isn't used to nutmeg, so if I make this recipe again I will either cut it back to 1/4 tsp. or omit it all together. It was okay overall, just not what my family is accustom to.

This recipe was good, my family enjoyed it. As someone else mentioned, instead of adding nutmeg I sauted the mushrooms in garlic. The garlic gave the dish a wonderful flavor.

Being a mushroom lover, I thought that I would like this recipe.  However, the nutmeg was just too much.  Nutmeg and chicken turned out to be a bad combo.  My family pretended to like it until I had my first bite and commented on how bad it was.  The rest of my family at once agreed that they did not like it either.  My daughter spent most of her time at dinner wiping the bread mixture off of her toungue.  Won't make this recipe again.

Fabulous just the way it is.  Sliced shrooms work too.  And I added spinach leave directly on the flattened chicken breasts and put the filling on top of that and rolled it up.  Remember to remove the toothpicks before serving (count each one).

This was excellent, both my husband and I loved it.   We also added shallots and garlic to the mushroom mixture and only mixed in approx. 1/4 cup breadcrumbs to the mixture.   I agree with another review, use the cream and not cream of mushroom soup.  The cream picks up the juices from the chicken and mushroom and it tastes super yummy.

We loved it. For the family cheese lover, I added a bit of provolone that melted into the cream and made a richer sauce. A real crowd pleaser! I need to make more next time since there were no leftovers.

I made this by stuffing with chopping up mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and adding the white wine (no bread crumbs) as suggested.  The rest of the steps as told.  It was wonderful, my family loved it.  This will go into my rotation for sure. Thanks to all.!!

Delicious, delicious, delicious! The flavors are great. I took the advice of another reviewer and added a splash of white wine (same kind that I served with dinner) to the mushroom mixture. It turned into a paste and was incredibly tasty. I added smoked gouda to my stuffing along with spinach.I never have been a fan of canned cream of anything soups so needless to say using the heavy cream is essential. I actually used evaporated milk and still acquired fantastic sauce results with a ton less calories and fat. Regardless, this recipe is a keeper for my household especially when my hubby makes a "this is a delicious meal" comment before I've done my 'quality control (QC)' taste test.  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe!

Not bad.  I made Becker duxelles for the shroom stuffing.  I used 8 oz. shrooms for 2 breasts.  I pounded the breasts flat but I may not do that next time.  I used panko crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs, and I wouldn't suggest that because the panko absorbs too much cream and remains soggy after baking.  I added some parmesan to the panko with salt pepper and thyme.  Not bad.

This was really good. Instead of a rollup, I pounded two large chicken breasts down and placed them on top of one another with the mushrooms inside.  I cut it into two inch sections to serve.  My bf said it would go into his top three favorites dinners.

I wish I had read other people's suggestions before making this one.  I would definately suggest sprucing it up with some of the suggestions other people have submitted. I thought it was a little bit bland the way the original recipe is written.  And I would either leave the bread crumbs out of the stuffing all together or reduce them greatly.  They took away from the flavor of the mushrooms in my opinion.

I made this the way MICHELLECA recommended.  It was very well recieved and definitely something I plan on making again!  I cut up the mushrooms and shallots in a food processor so it took nearly no time at all.  I also used olive oil to coat the pan for cooking the mushrooms and shallots and to spread over the chicken before the bread crumbs (i prefer olive oil to butter, and it just seemed like so much butter!).  The nutmeg is key.  It gives it almost a middle eastern flavor.  I served this dish with cous cous and roasted brussels sprouts which both looked attractive with the chicken and complimented the taste pretty well.  When I make it next time, I think spinach would be a great addition to roll up with the chicken.  I also think I would like to mix the cream with the leftover mushroom paste to pour over the top, since many people were scooping out the pan drippings to eat over the cous cous (I didn't say anything but I winced when I watched them chow down on cream and chicken drippings!).  This recipe sounds like a weird mix but it is fantastic!

I wasn't sure exactly how to get the chicken nice and flat, but after beating it a bit it worked well! This recipe is tasty, simple, and impressive plated with vegatables and wild rice!

Yummy!!! I followed some of the suggestions made by others - added Onion, bread crumbs, veggy bouillion cube and red wine to the stuffing. I added thyme, paprika and black pepper to the bread crumbs. Rolling the chicken is a little tricky, and keeping it together was difficult until I started breaking the toothpicks in half and just tackinghte pieces of chicken closed. I used mushroom soup instead of the cream, and it was worth all the fiddling!!! I will make this one again!!

These were quite good.  I followed some of Michelleca's notes, and made duxelle, with garlic and wine.  I'm not sure that I'd make these again; what with pounding the chicken, and the rolling, it is rather time consuming.  With that much invested, I want something I am more impressed with.
