My husband and I loved this! I'm not a maple person, but I really enjoyed this! The syrup gives it a little maple zing--not too much, but just enough! We'll fix this one again soon.  :)

SUPER delicious too!!  This recipe gets all 5 stars in my book!  I followed it exactly using loin chops.  The maple glaze was so delicious, I spooned some over the chops.  I didn't have maple syrup but had McCormick's Maple flavoring, so I made my own.   The recipe is on the box.  Since I only needed 1/4 cup of apple juice, I used a portion of a box of Juicy Juice.  The smell of it cooking as the juice and syrup were reducing was awesome.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you grandmary for sharing such a SUPER recipe.

I wasn't real fond of this recipe.  I used boneless center cut chops and they were tough!  The flavor was good, could really taste the maple syrup though.  Maybe if a different cut of chops was used it they would be more tender.

I followed recipe, but baked in the even, and these chops were tasteless. I will try again and pan fry, but im not sure that will change the fact that they definatly lacked flavor

This recipe couldn't be easier to make and it turned out very yummy.  I marinated the chops in the sauce and then pan seared them to lock in the juice.

Really flavorful and light tasting. Was a quick but a very good dinner recipe. It’s just the 2 of us so I was able to cut the recipe in half and incorporate sliced apples and a few slices of onion. It was PERFECT!! Thank you

Just fixed this for dinner tonight and I could give it only three stars--I had to adjust it too much. As is, the glaze would have been too runny. You would have had to overcook the chops until the glaze reduced down enough to be thicker. 
So, I used 2T cornstarch to make a slurry with some of the glaze liquid and added it back. Also, I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp salt (could have used more) and 1/3 C brown sugar. 

After browning the chops, I added the glaze and simmered until thick. The chops came out very tasty and the glaze was thick enough to coat. With my adjustments, the glaze would go nicely with ham.

I loved the idea and got as far as browning the chops but then realized I didn’t have apple juice! So I substituted applesauce! And stirred it into the syrup and it became liquid based so I used it and it worked perfectly! !!

This recipe is very easy to make and a welcome change for me from plain boneless chops. I also used garlic and herb Mrs. Dash which added a little bite to counteract some of the sweet. The other reviews are correct. Don't not over saute the chops.

Really enjoyed this! The only thing I did different was I added 1/4 C. Brown sugar to make the syrup a little thicker because I was out of cornstarch. Of course it also made it almost too sweet, so next time I'll try the cornstarch.

A puréed apple was substituted  for the apple juice and chopped onion added a spicy taste to the dish. This is a recipe which will become a favorite for our family.

My husband and I really liked the taste of the sauce. The pork chops I used were cut thin (tying to save on the calories) and I baked them too long in the oven; consequently they were dry. Next time I'll use a thicker cut! I like that the recipe is quick and easy for those busy week-night  dinners.

Sauce was a little too sweet.  The next time, I'll substitute water for the apple juice.
