Great recipe.  We used shell pasta, and instead of plain tomatoes we added canned, diced tomatoes seasoned with garlic, oil, and vinegar.  The tomatoes acted as the sauce, and added lots of flavor to the dish.

I took some advice from the last reviewer and made some modifications.  I took ground mild italian sausage and made mini meat balls with them, ground them, and set them aside while I did the veggies.  I added about a 1/2 cup of white wine with the veggies, lots of salt, some oregano, parsley, and basil, and used a can of italian stewed tomatoes (drained) instead of fresh.  Topped it off with shreded parmesean and it was a hit!  My husband and our dinner guests loved it.   I'll definately make it again.

As the others, I found this to be a little lacking in flavor.  It needs something to tie things together so that it does not just taste like pasta with vegetables.  My reccomendation: add some itailian sausage, a quart of chicken stock and cook the pasta in the skillet.  Then throw some parmesan on top before serving.

This was good but it needs more seasoning. I am not sure what to add, but it was little bland to me.

Very good! I did add 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp basil, and 1 tsp italian seasoing. I also added 1/2 cup white wine at the same time as the tomatoes and let it warm just a couple of minutes. Will definitely make this again.

I added chicken, that I marinated all day, added fresh basil and some oregano and it still lacked flavor.  Good base recipe; was just missing something.  Thank you for the recipe!

Amazing! I made it but didn't peel the tomatoes.  We used ingredients from the famer's market and this was fabulous.  I had to saute the squash a little longer than 2 minutes.  We ate it for dinner and then I added a little balsamic vinegar to the leftovers and had it as a pasta salad the next day.

With a simple recipe that includes good, fresh ingredients, you  know you have a winner.  I prepared this as the recipe directed  but,  just as I breathe,  I gave it a good sprinkle of freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano upon serving.

This tastes like it's harder to make than it is. I definitely use a can of italian tomoatoes and add basil and oregano in for a little more flavor. Great base recipe

Sorry, but this was bland.  I added Italian seasoning, oregano, basil to help out the flavors a bit.  After a few bites I added a healthy dose of Parmesan to perk it up.  Should have tripled the garlic.  Good base recipe, but needs major work in the flavor department.

Try red pepper flakes, chopped red onion, chopped fresh chiles, sundried tomatoes, fresh herbs of your choosing, oregano and basil are my favorite. 
I can't digest beef but chicken meatballs sound like a winner too.

One of my families go to meals in the summer. It's fresh, quick, and healthy.  We add matchstick carrots and lots of garlic then omit the yellow squash (the children have built in detectors for this).
This always leaves a quiet table and full tummies.

This is a great basic. Made as is for a quick week night dinner.  And for guests, I cut the zukes and squash into smaller pieces, and sauté all vegetables in olive oil.  I add granulated garlic, dried rosemary and dried basil with enough white wine to let the dried spices come alive.  Tossed pasta with fresh parsley, basil and steamed asparagus. I let all the veggies chill for about an hour, toss with pasta, and add about 1/3 or less cup of arugula. Toasted pine nuts go good, too.

I agreed with all the writers who said it was extremely bland.  I added cheese and balsamic salad dress ing the next day to a cold version.  It was a little better.  I prefer something with more flavor

Easy and tasty recipe.  I prefer a little more flavour so I improved it by chopping up an italian sausage, an onion, and some garlic, frying it up first, then adding the rest of the veggies.  Added some cayenne pepper and italian seasoning and it was great.

This is a decent base recipe that can be easily modified.  I did not notice until the very end that I needed to add a sauce. I should have read through the recipe better before I started cooking, so that’s on me.  I would suggest that “sauce of choice” be added to the ingredient list.  We had this with chicken and some Alfredo sauce I had on hand.

I am married and have 5 kids. My entire family bashed on this meal! I did change a couple things. I sautéed 1/2 pound of sea scallops in 2 Tblsp. butter and added to the veggies. I cooked  them in a can of tomato sauce to add a little extra flavor. When the veggies were tender, I drained most of the sauce before pouring over the noodles. Then added some fresh parmesan. Thinking about maybe trying a little white wine next time.

Delicious recipe. I added some celery , onions and cilantro. Light but filling. My husband loved it.  I will definitely make this again. Very easy to make.  You can add many different veggie and different spices. Next time I am going to try some fresh ginger.

I used the penne, but I altered the recipe eliminating the squash, mushrooms and tomatoes and using four colors of bell peppers and onion with a large amount of dried parsley, dried garlic powder, kosher salt and freshly ground pepper at the end as it seemed to need some flavor enhancing.

I love this combination.  I also add eggplant. I chop all my vegetables up into bite-size pieces and add more garlic then this recipe calls for placing them in a bowl and adding the oil to combine. And I grill them in a wire basket  before adding to the pasta which adds incredible flavor to the dish.

This was easy & had great flavor!  I did not have squash or mushrooms on hand so I added onions & sliced, link sausage.

I took some advice from earlier  reviewers and made some minor modifications, for more taste.  

I added fresh basil and my dried Italian herb mix -- near the end of the cooking.   I, also, served topped w/  Parmesan Cheese (coarsely shredded) and fresh Italian Parsley (flat leaf) .  

Of less consequence, I shaved the garlic (rather chopped) and added some leftover broccoli flowerets.

I liked this recipe well enough, but no one else in my family would eat it.

I added in some tomato powder (I make my own in dehydrator), basil, tarragon wine vinegar, olive oil, sliced shallots, and sliced polish sausage. Came out pretty good. Still a little bland, maybe add in some parmesan or something...otherwise tastes good. Is becomming one of my favorite quick recipes.
