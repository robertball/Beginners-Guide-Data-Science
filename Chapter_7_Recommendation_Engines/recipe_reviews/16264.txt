This is a very tasty snack cracker on its own. Easy to do, very little time needed. I have tried others, but they used way too much oil or seasonings. We love this one!

I thought these were pretty good, but no one in my family will eat them and even the guys at my husband's office didn't eat them.

Very nice. This amount would coat more crackers than the 10 ounce package called for. I used a 12 ouonce package and still had more seasoned oil than I really needed.

Very addictive!  I made these and included them in gift baskets.  My brother horded any extra that he could find.  I poured everything into a gallon ziploc bag and let it sit for about thirty minutes so the crackers could absorb the flavors.  Very good and extremely easy to make.  I've found that the ranch dip mix is actually better than the dressing mix.  It is more flavorful.

I omitted the garlic powder and ued a 14oz. box of crackers. These were a childhood favorite of mine. (My grandma used to make them.)I decided to make some to take with me on a Women's Retreat this weekend. (my "Something Salty") 
I just took them out of the oven and my kids (5&3) each had to have a small portion. They are wonderful!

Very easy,the whole family loves 'em! I made them according to the recipe, and also made some using Hidden Valley Spicy Ranch and garlic powder. The kids want to use taco mix! If some find 3/4 cup oil too much, use 2 packages of crackers and keep everything else the same. Way less oily and still tastes great.

Have had these at many parties but just made them myself for the first time this month. I used only 1/2 Cp of Oil and only 1/2 package of Ranch dressing mix powder and this turned out wonderfully. I would also suggest letting this sit in an air tight container overnight before serving as it allows the flavors to meld.

I've made this several times and it is addictive!!  One time I had a package of Hidden Valley Harvest Dill and used that instead of the ranch dressing and dill weed so now that's what I use.  (lucky!)  It is really good exactly as written and is good with the Harvest Dill as well!!

Perfect recipe and super easy too! My four year old son and I made these together in no time. Now my entire family is gobbling them down and they'll be gone just as quickly as they were made.   I actually did use a ranch dip mix as that's all I had on hand and it still turned out wonderful. Thanks for an easy family friendly recipe!

I love this recipe! But I had to cut out the dill since I didn't have any, instead I used onion salt and lemon pepper. I should have cut down on the oil. And I used saltines instead of oyster crackers. All in all this is a wonderful recipe. It has alot of potential to be changed, and added to.

I love these but have never baked them. Stir oil and seasonings in a bowl, toss in crackers, stir well. Store in covered bowl or bag, let sit for best flavor.

Very similar to what my grandmother and I used to make.  I actually used more Ranch seasoning, but I love the seasoning taste.

Very tasty and so simple. Instead of regular vegetable oil, I substitute the butter flavored popcorn oil found in the snack isle.

I have made this for years and all the children I give them to love them. My other half and our dog share them. I use 3 boxes of crackers to 2 pkgs of ranch dressing.  The rest of the ingredients as posted with the exception of the garlic powder.  Make sure you bake them long enough and let sit when done.

I used 2 - 12 oz packages of oyster crackers.  I also added 1/4 tsp lemon pepper seasoning.  I left the other measurements the same.  My kids and are a gobbling these up as I write this review...very tasty!  I think if you only used one package of crackers, it would be too oily with too much seasoning.  I baked them in my big roasting pan for 15 minutes at 200...perfection!

my grandkids are all about ranch dip or dressing...they would put it on breakfast cereal if we let them. LOL. This is a great after-school snack, but I cut the oil to 1/2 cup, and no garlic. That's it!

I am 63 and I have had this every year since the recipe came into being. It has always been a hit!  So much so, that the batch I make each year is HUGE due to every family member who wants to take some home. Some people shy away from tryig them at the beginning, but once they try it, they are hooked. It's surprising what you can do to these little crackers.

I have been making this for years but my recipe varies slightly,- 2 bags oyster crackers, 1&1/2 pkgs. ranch dressing, 1Cup oil, 1 Tbsp. dill weed, but there is no need to bake, just stir it all up and stir  periodically about 10-15 mins. till the oil soaks in then spread out on a sheet of parchment paper to dry out a little.Then put in canister.

These are a great snack. If you go to a bulk foods store and get a
trail mix(bar keeper mix is good)or any different kind to your liking.
This makes the mix more interesting. A little cayenne pepper is also a good addition.

I make a version of this every Christmas Season for our party at work. Thanks for the addition of garlic powder. I'll add it for our wedding anniversary party in June!

My mom would make these when I was younger and I just loved them.  The crackers I bought were a 14 oz box so I just went with that, and I did not use a full 3/4 cup of oil, just a little shy.  The flavors are just wonderful and make a great snack.  Thanks for sharing.

Used 2 boxes of crackers (both 12 oz in think) and there was plenty of oil & seasoning. Added a few more sprinkles of dill & garlic and a few shots of hot sauce. Everyone loved them!

This is soo easy and really tasty.  I used 2 12oz boxes and they were all evenly coated.  I really liked that they were not greasy like I thought they may have been if i only used 1 box of crackers.  i dived this up and gave as part of a gift basket.

This is not a recipe for how to make something, it’s just coating premise crackers. I was looking for a recipe to make my own crackers.

Just awesome!! I made these with the Premium Saltine Minis. I used one box of crackers, one package of ranch dip, the garlic, 1/2 cup of oil and I added a generous shake off crushed red peppers for heat. Toasting these in the oven really seemed to lock in the flavor. Not too oily either. These are wonderful. I especially love the mini size. I could eat the entire box. (I added a pic to this recipe)

I've made this a few times and it's always a hit. Sometimes I add garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne,Parmesan cheese,  etc. depending on my guests and what I have on hand. I've also used this to flavor pretzels and it's delicious.  Very good on it's own as a snack or sprinkled over soup or a salad.

I received some of these for Christmas for last two years.  Decided I can't wait that long in between so started making my own.  LOVE them.  Use more dill and coconut oil.  Yum!

Loved These! I make them often now. We like to use the smaller oyster crackers & there always seems to be a lot of oil mix left so I usually throw a handful of pretzels in as well. Very Good!

my boys loved this and could not get enough. I used less oil and still thought they were too greasy, however, the flavour was awesome! I'll try doubling the crackers but leaving everything else the same.

This recipe works well with 16 oz of large, broken pretzels in place of the oyster crackers.  I use 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1 tsp dill weed, 1 pkg of hidden valley ranch, 1/2 tsp lemon pepper and 1/2 tsp garlic salt.  Just another variation of the above - Both are good!

I have made this recipe several times and use 2 bags of crackers.  the first time i made them i only had one bag of crackers so i added about 3 cups of cheerios.  that was really good too.  i only use about 1/2 cup of oil and that is plenty.  for those who think they are to oily this is the key along with baking them.  that takes away the oilyness.  i also add both garlic powder and onion powder.  very addicting.

These are wonderful!  I only used 1/2 C Vegetable oil and it was plenty.  I also bought the Fiesta Ranch syle dressing by mistake, but the crackers were spicy and good!!

This was a childhood favorite of mine. My mother used this exact recipe. Every once in a while I break up sourdough pretzels and use them in place of the oyster crackers. They're both always a hit at work and parties, not to mention SO easy!

These were super easy to make and had good flavor.  The kids liked them a lot but the adults didn't seem too interested in even trying them.  Maybe because they still look like oyster crackers and everyone knows how oyster crackers taste.  I don't know.  I liked them though!
