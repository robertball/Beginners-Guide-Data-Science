This is a good, a mild slightly sweet pickle taste. If your family doesn't eat radishes don't try it. It is a definite flavor here but the sweet carrot balances it well. I followed the recipe exactly but traded sugar for stevia. My biggest challenge was what to use it for or with what? Will make again later.

Have made this several times. I usually halve the recipe because we cannot eat that much. But over time I have become adventurous. I now add a sliced spicy pepper such as jalapeño or Anaheim. At first I took out the seeds, but, now I leave them in. I have used other veggies as well: fennel bulb and fronds, sliced garlic, onion, beets--glorious color, cucumbers and zucchini. Sometimes several of these at once. One time I got really adventurous and added some coriander, and anise. Maybe not traditional, but easy and delicious. We eat them with all kinds of sandwiches from tuna to egg to grilled cheese. Use them to garnish rice dishes. And put them in salad. The brine makes a great base for salad dressing.  Thanks so much for a great basic recipe.

I loved this. I used it with banh mi and even added it to an omelet and banh xeo. It goes so well with everything. The flavor is amazing; tangy with a hint of sweet. The veggies stay crisp even after three days. I had extra brine so I added it to some julienned red bell pepper. Yum!! Thank you for the recipe.

Not very good.  Tasted too much like vinegar.  Did not really taste the carrots or radish.   Threw it away

I just love this pickled combination.
It’s like a snack and great with any foods, especially hot rice topped with shoyu sauce. Yummy!
Thank You for this simple recipe.

OMG! That sounds so good and I just love banh mi and this looks like the perfect pickle for them. I’ll update when I make it but I know it’ll be super.
