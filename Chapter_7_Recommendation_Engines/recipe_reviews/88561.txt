Delicious! I plan to make it again in July, when local blackberries will be in season. A nice vinaigrette for this recipe is Mama's balsamic vinaigrette, here on allrecipes.

What a pretty salad.  I am glad I was able to make this and give it a picture as part of the Western Region Faceless Frenzy.  Thanks for sharing this gorgeous recipe.

A great simple recipe.  I adapted for ingredients on hand.  I added sliced strawberries and feta cheese and used walnuts that I caramelized in sugar. Yum.
