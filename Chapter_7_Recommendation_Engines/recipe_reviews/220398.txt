These were delicious! I cut mine into fries rather than wedges. My husband even ate and enjoyed them though he has told me many times he doesn't like like sweet potatoes.

Wowza. I cut the sweet potatos into fries. The first indication that this was the ride side dish for the evening was the awesome aroma that filled my kitchen.  I understood from the get-go that these are baked, not fried, so they are not hard and crunchy. But the flavor and the fact that these are way more healthy than fried french fries keeps these on my "must" list.  I served with a side of aioli sauce.  Nice and easy recipe!

These easy to make sweet potatoes are a great snack!  I'll be making these again soon!  If you want an interesting flavor to compliment the potatoes, add a sprinkle of chilotle pepper seasoning!

These didn't not come out for me very well. I tried them in the oven on a pan covered with foil and they stuck to the foil - even with the foil oiled. Took them off the foil and they finished  okay. Finished the batch by frying. You really have to watch them or they will burn. Part of the problem was that I couldn't get an even cut  because the sweet potato is hard. They were okay, but not great and Huny didn't give me a thumb's up to keep them on the menu.

I'm rating this for my hubby.  He loved these.  If you have problems with them sticking, just bake them on parchment paper!  That solves the problem.  I made him just one small sweet potato cut in medallion slices.  Rather than measure out the adjustments in exact proportions, I just used all the ingredients to eye but following the directions as written.  He loved them and wants them again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I did a simple variation of this recipe when I combined the Tangy Italian dressing, Parmesean Cheese, Garlic powder and pepper in a glass baking dish and mixed it all up into a slurry. I pre-cooked the potatoes in the Microwave, then sliced them into wedges or large fries. I then coated them in the dressing mix, and placed them onto a preheated BBQ grill along with the meat I was cooking at that time. It was a great meal.

Good recipe!!! Instead of wedges, I cut them into 1/4 inch thick slices and cooked them on a veggie screen on the grill at 375 degrees for 15 min. then turned and continued cooking another 5 minutes.  The seasoning is just right and even folks who don't think they like sweet potatoes will eat these!

Pretty good.  Lined a pan with parchment paper and cut them into fries.  Put them on a low broil for a couple minutes at the end to crisp them up.  No soggy fries.

Two potatoes....16 wedges, tossed in a bowl with Italian dressing and grated parmesan, and some garlic powder. Baked 20 minutes per side in preheated 400-degree oven. Delicious!

Really just didn't care for these.  People ate them but I got the feeling they were just trying to be polite.  Probably won't make them again.

There were good! The only problem I had was that my fries stuck to the pan because of the melted parmesan cheese....a small sacrafice though!

Very tasty baked fries. I simplified the directions by placing my sliced fries into a gallon sized baggie then added the other ingredients and shook well - making sure every fry was fully coated. Placed on my oiled iron pan and baked as directed.

I make this recipe once a week.  My kids who hate all vegetables even will ask for it.   I cut them into fries rather than wedges and  cook them longer, till they are nice and brown.   I love this recipe.

Cut the sweet potatoes into fried(I used two large potatoes). I mixed the salad dressing and cheese together, then tossed the fries into the dressing. I spread them out on parchment paper and turned after 20 minutes. I cooked another twenty minutes, checked them and they weren't quite done, so baked them for another 10 minutes. I should have cooked another 20 and I think they would have crisped up a bit. The flavor was good and it is a nice change from typical sweet potato fried. I think you could get away with using half the dressing and the fries might be a little less limp and have some crisp on the outside. I plan to try that next time...and there will be a next time

Delicious recipe!  I also cut the potatoes into french fries and I used a some Greek Oregano with Feta dressing (since I didn't have regular Italian) and it was very tasty!  I took the suggestion of another and used the parchment paper...good recommendation!  Served with some Chipotle dipping sauce...mmmm delicious :)

Was the first time for this recipe, I crinkle cut the fries and baked as directed, even got great caramelization  that added an added taste. Our guest who never had them before loved them so much, they had seconds.
