This was wonderful!  Made some Sprite ice cubes and froze the cherries in them so they would float.  Everyone enjoyed it ... thanks the great recipe!

I made this for my son's graduation party about a month ago.  Yummy!  It disappeared quickly and I got lots of compliments and a couple of requests for the recipe.

We served this at a Holiday Open House.  It was so festive looking because it is bright red. It was very delicious and was a big hit because it went fast!

we served this at my daughter's wedding for 250 people. We used friut punch concentrate from Costco and Ginger Ale instead of lemon-lime. It was delicious. Be aware that a serving size in this recipe is about 3 ounces. Allow two servings per cup and your're ready to go. I also froze the ice cream in muffin tins ahead of time so the servers could just unwrap and drop them in.

Very good punch!!!  I made it for a family birthday and it was a hit with adults and kids.  I made a few changes-I used cherry 7-Up instead of lemon lime and orange creme icecream insted of vanilla(it is orange sherbert swirled with vanilla I.C.)  I will definitely be making this again soon:-)

I used frozen white concord grape cocktail concentrate for the fruit punch part of the recipe and on the whole I thought it was just too sweet.  However, we gently added the grenadine to the white punch and as it settled to the bottom of the punch bowl and with the clouds of ice cream on top, the sunset effect was indescribably beautiful!!  Next time I'd add some club soda or something to dilute the sweetness a bit.  Also, we used MUCH more then 1/2 cup of icecream and that was really good!!  Also, I like the frozen cherry idea that another reviewer had, as thawed marachino cherries sink right to the bottom of the bowl.

I made this for my daughter's 14th birthday party. It was okay, but in my opinion it wasn't that great tasting or looking.

I'm thinking that maybe this recipe calls for 1/2 gallon ice cream like simular punch recipes, and not 1/2 cup. Maybe a typing error?

This was very good.  Everyone raved about it.  I used Hawaiian Punch and Squirt.  And accidentally doubled the grenadine.  Oops.  But it made no difference.  Delicious!
