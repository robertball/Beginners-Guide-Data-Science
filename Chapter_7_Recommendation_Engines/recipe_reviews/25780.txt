Don't substitute oil!! Unless you're sure you know the right proportions. This rating is only for the batch I tried to make by substituting oil as some of the previous reviewers did. Since they didn't say otherwise, I assumed a one-to-one substitution and completely wasted a whole box of cake mix. Very disappointed. I went with the oil b/c it was more affordable, If you're going to suggest substitutions, please be specific!!

Very good, RICH recipe. The cookies are not too sweet, so when filled with the caramel frosting you get a great flavor. The cookies will be puffy when first removed from the oven, but will flatten as they cool.

These Came Out great, and my little sister loved them! I used devils food and chocolate frosting per her tastes. I made them very big, so next time I will roll out the dough and make mini cookie sandwiches. I will also try lemon cake with lemon icing

Great recipe. Yumm!  The cookies turned out so deliciously moist and just slightly crispy on the outside. I used vegetable oil for the shortening and cooked the cookies on a Baking stone (I had a friend in cooking school recommend only baking on a Silpat or Pampered Chef Baking Stone; I guess they did an experiment and found those two items cooked the most evenly). I am going to try this same recipe with a different cake mix and frosting sometime, but for now, why mess with a good thing? I will definitely make this again - tomorrow in fact!

I subbed coconut oil for shortening which gave the cookies a distinctive coconut taste all by themselves. So I did half the recipe as directed, and left the other half without the frosting. A hit with the family!

I made these cookies for the raffle table at my club meeting.  I had extra copies of the recipe for anyone that wanted them.  The next month, I got 11 raves for the cookies, so they will be made again. Everyone at my house, loves Chocolate - in any form.

This is the easiest cookie I've ever made.  Just dumped the three ingredients in my standing mixer for a few seconds and that was it.  I made the balls smaller and rolled them in powdered sugar (my daughter 4 year old daughter loved helping with that part) for a different look.  I frosted mine with regular chocolate frosting but the possibilities are endless.  Good stuff!

Great easy recipe!  Would be fun to make with older children.  I recommend sprinkling with powdered sugar, because they are a little plain looking without.

Easy and quick recipe to make. Very simple, and delicious! It is important to form the balls small  to keep thier shape. If you spoon drop them they flatten out. yummy!

absolutely wonderful!  My daughter made these for me last night (she knows how i adore a bit of sweet with my evening decaf tea - such a good kid I'm so lucky to have!) Anyways, naturally we didnt have german chocolate cake mix on hand, nor the frosting - and I was low on shortening soooooo - there were changes - She used a fudge brownine mix 1/3 cup shortening, 1/3 cup margarine and a peanut butter frosting (1 cup peanut butter, 1/2 cup confectioners sugar, splash of milk and whipped with a hand mixer.  The cookies did spread out quite a bit - but were FANTASTIC.  crisp on the edges with the middles a bit soft and a little frosting ... wonderuld sandwich cookies YUM.  Cant wait to pick up the german chocolate cake mix!! thanks BLKLABB1.  Utterly wonderul

I used 1/3 cup of vegetable oil and 2 eggs.  They turned out soft and delicious!  I've liked other cake cookies better because they had a stronger flavor but it's great with the icing in between.

Easy and tasted great.  Made for a bake sale and all were sold.  I used my Pampered Chef small scoop which made all the cookies the same size.  Dusted with confectioners sugar.

I just made these a few days ago, and they were not only easy but absolutely delicious! They are a little puffy when you first take them out of the oven, but like another person said, they flatten out as they cool. I used the coconut pecan frosting for the sandwich cookies, but I had some that didnt match up properly, so I dusted those with powdered sugar. AMAZING! I think it would be too much to do both frosting and powdered sugar, though. I've already had a few friends ask me for this recipe, too! I can't wait to try it with other flavors!

Recipe is very easy to make. I didn't make into sandwiches just cookies. Hubby's words were, "Wow these are good." I myself thought the frosting was a bit sweet. Next time I'll put a thinner layer. Also to get cookies to be close to the same size I used a cookie scooper and rounded. Will definitely make again.

First of all, I LOVE German Chocolate Cake! These did not disappoint anyone. I used the frosting recipe on here by Denise. My Mother always told me "don't substitute, use Crisco, nothing else". I don't know if it's cake that eats like a cookie, or cookies that taste like cake! Thank you for a great recipe!

I made these last night for some friends that came over. They loved them! I replaced the 2/3 cup of shortening with butter ( worked fine) and I had no frosting so I used powdered sugar as a topping. They were soft, sweet but not too sweet, delicious cookies. I will be making these again sometime soon!
