I wanted to try these for a halloween party but I really expected them to be a flop.  I'm not very good at making candy.  However, they turned out great and it didn't take long either!  Thanks to those who said it took 3 bags of microwave corn and to use plastic baggies on your hands-that really helped.  Next time, I have to keep the kernels out!  Also, I think I will use a brown paper grocery bag to mix the popcorn because I had to coat the corn in shifts because I didn't have a large enough bowl!  Excellent recipe-thanks!

This was fantastic. My whole family loved them. I used an air popper instead of cooking the popcorn over the stove. I also found it very easy to make into balls;  I used ziplock sandwich size bags and put them over my hands. It kept the popcorn from sticking. This is one I will do again!

This was a quick, wonderful recipe. As some suggested, I used microwave popcorn, but I only needed 2 bags (it's probably just a personal preference of how "carmel-y" you want your popcorn balls, I like em' sweet). I used Orville Redenbacher's "Smart Pop" (to save the calories - he he). Seriously GREAT recipe! PS - I also used one of the recipes for Sweetened Condensed Milk found on this site and it worked better than the real stuff! (cheaper too!!)

I listened to the other reviews and used half of the amount of popcorn that the recipe called for and they turned out great.... I took them to a child's halloween party and both the kid and adults loved them!!!! My boyfriend asked to me to make another batch. This is a great recipe!!!

These were sooo good.  My husband had a hankering for popcorn balls so we made these last week.  I didn't have a candy thermometer on hand so I just guessed when the caramel was done.  Maybe I just got lucky but it was perfect- made chewy popcorn balls just the way we like them.  The caramel in this recipe is so good!  I wanted to eat the whole pot without adding popcorn!  We popped 1 cup of kernals and it made the perfect amount of popcorn for the caramel mixture.  Baggies on hands was also a great idea for forming the balls.  These are very sweet- you'll only need one!

I used half the popping corn asked for and I ended up with 17 popcorn balls. I still used the same amount of caramel, so they would be extra good. These will definitely be used for Christmas gifts.

These were absolutely delicious!  Lightly buttering my hands was a great idea and I just took the rest of the half of stick from the recipe to do that.  Also, I just used microwave popcorn--three bags of it--instead of fussing with popping it the hard way.  This one is a keeper.

Very tasty & simple.
I also used 3 bags of microwave kettle popcorn which made the recipe very quick.

These were very yummy!  The carmel was quite hot, so it was kinda hard to make them into balls. Otherwise they were delicious!

This is a great popcorn ball recipe. I like that it is a carmel-flavored popcorn ball rather than the traditional candy. It is also pretty easy. Be sure to keep a close eye on the coating as it cooks. It needs to cook to a 'firm ball' stage. If you don't cook it long enough, it can be a little sticky and get in your teeth. Even if that happens, it tastes good and will likely be eaten up quickly. :) As with most popcorn balls, these are best fresh. They are also still pretty good a day or two later, but their shelf-life is not very long.

This is an excellent recipe.  I did make a few changes.  Instead of 2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk, I used the whole can.  (I don't like leftovers.)  I used the Power Pop Microwave popper and did 5 batches of popcorn.  I sprayed the pans that I used for the popped popcorn with  Pam and then you don't need to butter your hands.  I also kept the popped popcorn in the oven at 200 degrees until the caramel was cooked. I also cooked the caramel in the microwave until it was a medium hard ball when tested in ice water.  This cuts the cooking time at least in half.

USE PAPER BAG FOR MIXING POPCORN AND CARAMEL!  Cleanup a breeze. We used that tip and also used plastic bags on our hands...no messy butter, no burns.  We also did let the mix sit for maybe 3-5 minutes in bag before forming into balls...any earlier and they wouldn't "moosh" well.  This recipe was loved by all.

Followed directions to the T. Very easy. Taste was great. The directions did not indicate how much working time you had to make the balls before they hardened so I made the balls when mixture was warm. I had to go back and reshape the balls as they were falling apart. I would suggest letting the mixture sit for a few minutes before shaping the balls.

Great recipe.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is that the amount of popcorn in the recipe is WAY too much for the amount of caramel that you get.  We used 1 1/2 cups air popped and it was a little too much.  A full 2 1/2 would have been tons.  That being said, air popped popcorn does end up with more volume per cup of un-popped kernels, but I still think 2 1/2 cups would be too much.

Good, not too sticky.  Greased hands with crisco helped to mold them.  Added M&M's to them to make it fun.

The flavor was good but the amount of popcorn far outweighed the amount of caramel. I made 28 popcorn balls and had two huge bowls of popcorn left with no caramel. Really easy to make though!

Wow!  Super good!  I like lots of caramel, so I used 2 bags of microwave kettle corn.  Cooked to a soft ball stage, as I also like them chewy.  Definitely enough caramel by doing it this way!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was great. Next time I would add salt to caramel mixture before pouring over the popcorn. I personally like a little bit of "salty" with my sweet. I air popped our corn, so probably if you were using microwave popcorn you wouldn't need to add salt.  Also, the caramel was very sticky on the bowl after we scraped out all the popcorn we could, next time I will spray my bowl with pam before popping the corn into it and adding the syrup.   We used sandwich bags on our hands and it worked great for keeping the popcorn from sticking!

Perfect!!! since this makes a lot I mixed it in a 13 gallon trash bag. I lined a 5 gallon bucket (just for support) then put the popcorn then let the carmel mixture stop bubbling before I poured it right in the middle of the popcorn. then I pulled the bag out of the bucket tied of the top then I just tumbled it around to mix it all over. really fast and I din't have to worry about the bowl. then I just buttered my hands and formed the balls and threw the bag out when they were done. I made about 30 balls and out them in little sandwich baggies. too many for my family so we had fun going aroung our neighborhood giving them to everyone we knew.Very Fun!!

Very easy to make and very delicious! The only things I changed was I used about half the amount of popcorn (if not less) than what the recipe calls for (we like our popcorn balls very, very caramel-y), and I only heated the sauce to 220 degrees F because we live at a high altitude and heating it to 238 degree made the caramel set up harder than we like.

These are soooo good!  They stay soft and chewy.  The caramel is so good on it's own.  We made a batch and after we tasted them we immediately doubled the recipe.  That way you can use your whole can of sweetened condensed milk.  I used just shy of three bags of microwave popcorn - two bags made them too sweet.

Please, please, please listen to those of uf who are telling you that you either need to cut the popcorn in half or double the caramel.  I had 4 big pans of popcorn sitting out and divided the caramel amongst them.  It was quickly evident I was not going to have enough caramel, so I just had to stir as best I could and ended up picking out the areas that had enough caramel to shape into balls.  I ended up with a roaster full of popcorn leftover with no caramel on it.  This is a rather thick caramel also and the popcorn balls I ended up with had more like blobs of caramel scattered throughout rather than an even coating.  I would give this recipe 4 stars for the flavor and chewiness of the caramel, but I was so mad when I was trying to shape the dry corn into balls that I felt I had to deduct.  Don't just assume, like I did, that a recipe with such a high rating has no major faults.  I ended up with 26 4" balls even with all the wasted popcorn, so something is not right with the amounts since it supposedly makes only 15 balls.

My family and I LOVE LOVED these!  I used the suggestions to use microwaved popcorn instead of popping it in the pan, and also used the baggies on my hands instead of buttering them.  They turned out wonderful and made great Christmas gifts.  Will DEFINITELY be making these again.

I loved these so much the first time I made them that I decided to try a gourmet version. I used half the amount of popcorn specified in the original recipe. Then added smoked sea salt, peanuts and a drizzle of butter to the popped corn. I also substituted a real vanilla bean in the sugar mixture (remove before adding to popcorn) YUM!

This was GREAT and easy.  Devoured by teenagers.  Definately mix in a paper bag or clean up is a big pain.

I love these, my kids love these, people wait for me to hand them out every-year!  I have made them with air-popped corn, pan-popped and microwave and all turn out well.  If you air pop, be sure to add a bit of salt though.  And do be careful to sort the unpopped kernels out though ;)

I found these to be just meh...I followed the directions exactly and found that heating the caramel for as long as the recipe called for made for very brittle caramel once it cooled. I don't like my popcorn balls to burst to pieces when you try to take a bite of it. I'm more of a truly chewy popcorn ball person. When it was still warm it was very good and it the taste is fine as well. I should have stopped just beyond soft ball stage and I've have been good. I used two bags of microwave popcorn and that was a bit too much. Three bags would have been WAY over what was needed for the amount of caramel called for.

Recipe as-is is terrific.  I added mint choc chips in at the end (for the holidays) and the chips got a bit melty, which was perfect, to make them have a chocolate-y appearance and a minty flavor.  My only complaint is about the popcorn.  Even after removing the kernels, we still found ourselves removing un-chewable popcorn pieces every other bite or so.  But that is unavoidable, I guess.  Otherwise, good recipe.

One can of condensed milk makes 2 batches of the carmel. I added a pinch of pumpkin pie spice in lieu of vanilla and added cashews to the final mix.

We didn't care for these popcorn balls at all.  I reduced the popcorn as suggested by other reviewers, followed the candy recipe exactly and they were still dry with a very hard coating.  I'm looking for a recipe similar to my grandmothers, which made a much chewier, tastier ball.

Very good. Only concern I had was that I forgot about the seeds that didn't pop and then I ended up with a bunch of popcorn balls with seeds. Some may have caught this but I would have appreciated the heads up. Thanks for the recipe!

These were great! A little stickier than I remember Grandma making, but very good!  I couldn't stand to see some of the condensed milk go to waste so, I "one-and-a-halfed" the recipe (if that's the right terminology?) ...Ended up using the whole can of milk this way.  I already had my popcorn popped, so I used about 30 cups of popped popcorn.  The best way to keep the caramel from sticking to my hands was to simply moisten my hands with water after every 3 or 4 balls, just had a bowl of water next to my work area.  I also added some candy corn to about half of the balls - yum! I ended up making 46 "mini popcorn balls."  I WILL use this recipe again! :o)

This has a wonderful flavor. I couldn't find my thermometer, so I cooked to the soft ball stage by testing with water. I used 3 bags of microwave popcorn, but may use 4 next time. The balls were a little too soft and chewy, so I put in a 225 degree oven until they were a little crispy - about 30 minutes. They could have gone longer - they were still chewy, but not as soft. I cloroxed my sink & used it to put the popcorn in and mix - hot water cleaned it right up.

You're right. Kids love 'em even they haven't tasted yet this kind of popcorn. I used to buy popcorn from a nearby store/grocery when my kids ask me to. But I guess I don't have to buy anymore.

This was a de-lish recipe. We made it for Halloween and had so much fun! Thanks for the reviewer who gave the great idea of mixing the popcorn and caramel in a big brown paper bag...that worked great but just suggest layer popcorn in the bag pour caramel mix, then layer more popcorn, caramel, mix etc. Turned out excellent except hard to get caramel to the bottom. Hopefully with layering technique should work better. DE-LISH!

Pretty tasty, easy to make. Very sticky when eaten! I used the whole can of sweetened condensed milk, maybe that contributed to the stickiness. Only cooked 1 cup of popcorn and it was plenty.

This recipe is delicious! These popcorn balls have the BEST caramel flavor. You won't be disappointed. I made them last year around Halloween for work and this year EVERYONE was asking for them again.   I used 3 bags of Microwave Popcorn instead of popping my own kernels, as recommended on other reviews.

I had been curious as to how to make popcorn balls, so I found this recipe and was pretty much pleased with the result I made these at work. There was none left of the first batch so I ended up making another batch. Good recipe.

These are easy and wonderful.  I slightly over cooked the syrup the second time I made these and prefer them to be chewy so will watch my temperature more carefully.

This recipe was awesome. I've made it several times and it's been no fail each time. My only comment is, much like other's comments, the recipe calls for way too much popcorn. We find it the perfect amount of caramel for one bag of microwave popcorn. And it's so easy to make too! Just make sauce in a pot, dump popcorn in a bowl and pour caramel over popcorn. I made it into balls for Halloween last year, but now we just eat it out of the bowl on movie nights.

Although these turned out fine, smelled like Halloween of my childhood and tasted good, they are a whole lot of work and mess for a fair treat.  There's nothing wrong with the recipe, and if you love popcorn balls, this is a very good one(love the caramel!); however, I would not go through the mess in my kitchen for these again.  I think I dirtied every pot and bowl in the place!

The popcorn popped enough for over 30 balls, so I had to double the caramel 'sauce' ingredients.  Very good.

Very tasty recipe, I made these for a Halloween party this year and they were a big hit even with the "grown ups". I used half of the popcorn called for in the recipe, and next time I will probably use even less. We like ours with a little extra caramel.

Loved it.  Cooked to soft ball stage (my thermometer was wacko.)  Stayed soft.  Only needed about 1 1/2 cups unpopped corn.  Got over 20 balls.  Yum!  Will make again.  Mild flavor.

Super Easy, use paper bag to mix popcorn and carmel sauce so clean up is a snap. Use baggies on your hands to form balls.  Oops forgot the vanilla.  Excellent Recipe!

I love this recipe!!!  Who knew that making caramel popcorn was so easy!  I made this for my kids halloween party and I kept munching on them while I was forming them into balls.  These are very addictive.  I will definitely making them again for the holidays.  My son suggested adding honey roasted peanuts next time.   Very good recipe!!

This recipe has potential.  The caramel is not enough to cover all of that popcorn though!  Either 1/2 the popcorn or double the caramel.  It is decent- my four year old loved them.  However, it wasn't something to write home about.  Still looking...

These were good, but just wanted to note that I tried the suggestion of using a paper bag to coat batches of popcorn and a lot of it stuck to the bag. It was a waste of time & messier than it needed to be. I used ziplocks over my hands which made making the balls very quick & easy.

This was the first time I have ever made popcorn balls. I made them for a party at my daughters school they loved them and they were a lot easier to make than I had thought. I also reduced the popcorn in the recipe.One of the teachers liked them so well he asked if I could make a dozen for him so that he could give them to friends for christmas.Thank you for sharing that wonderful recipe.

I don't know if I did something wrong - but mine turned out way too chewy and have very little flavor. I followed the recipe as written but I'm going to have to rate my results as a flop. Glad to hear everyone else is having more success!

Didn't use as much popcorn as noted by other reviewers... Caramel was super easy and delicious!!! Will definitely make it again for popcorn or as a sauce for apples, ice cream, etc. Yummy!

I really like these a lot, I have made them twice now and I am sure I am not doing it entirely correctly as I dont have a candy thermometer so I just guess at the right temperature, but the finished product comes out great for me.  I use less popcorn.

These were sticky and gooey!  Kids (and parents) had a blast making them!  We only popped 1 cup of popcorn and it still made 20 balls...we happen to like sticky and gooey!  Delicious and fun!!

So, I didn't read all the reviews before I attempted this recipe. I ended up making a second batch of carmel sauce.  I simply mixed the first batch in and realized it wasn't going to be enough then put the popcorn back in the oven to stay warm and made the second batch of carmel.  I sure wish I had read the reviews and didn't make so much popcorn at one time.  It was a mess BUT the result is wonderful and tasty.

I would've liked these to be a tad sweeter and with more flavor. Just a tad bland. The only thing I changed was I cut the popcorn in 1/2 and I still got a full 16 balls out of the batch with double the caramel. Had I used the full amount of popcorn that the recipe calls for, there would've been very little caramel on the corn. Oh and I doubled the vanilla. Next time I may make a little more caramel with more brown sugar.

Used only 2 bags of the large Microwave Kettle corn and mixed it in a large paper bag-avoided spills and a mess.  Used two butter covered baggies and shaped the balls firmly. VERY YUMMY

great recipe!  I agree with other reviewers that is way too much popcorn for the caramel.  I used 1/2 cup popcorn, and the recommeded amount of caramel and they were delicious and still made about 10 balls.  Baggies on the hands is the way to go, this would not have worked without them.  Fun, delicious and easy clean up.  Thanks for a great recipe

Tastes great! I didn't have corn syrup so I didn't use it. I also didn't have a candy thermometer, just boiled it for about 5 minutes and it was fine. Don't use microwave popcorn, that stuff is ! Full of hydrogenated fat (even the American public has taken notice of how bad that is). Take 5 more minutes and make the real stuff!

I could not get the mixture to form balls, but it tasted good eaten out of the bowl. I'm pretty sure it was something I did. It seemed like it was too much popcorn and not enough caramel, so perhaps I made too much popcorn.

Loved it, loved the caramel!  However, we did not make balls out of ours, just popped enough corn for our family to enjoy straight from the bowl.  Would be good with roasted almonds thrown in, too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are great.  I used 3 bags of microwave popcorn (Pop Secret 94% fat free)and followed the rest of the recipe to a "T".  It made 24 scrumptious popcorn balls.

The kids and I just made these treats for Halloween.  They were quite fun for the kids, and the caramel candy tastes wonderful!  We used 3 bags of butter light microwave popcorn, and the ratio was perfect.

These popcorn balls were very good. The caramel coating was so good and easy to make. The only change I made was that I used only 1/2 the popcorn suggested. I can't imagine if I had used all the popcorn. As it was, the coating barely was enough to coat the amount of popcorn I used! Still, a very good recipe worth keeping to make again! Thanks!

My Kids and husband loved these.  Only used 1 cup of unpopped popcorn and we still got plenty.  Warning: The carmel is really hot especially if you use extra carmel.  I found that if I kept my hands buttered it didn't burn as much.

Awesome! My guests loved this treat! I found the cleanup easy -- as long as you have hot water on hand. I also used microwave popcorn and it was a cinch. I only baked it for 1/2 hour and found that to be enough time. It was a tad salty (could have been the popcorn I used though) so next time I'll use less salt or unsalted butter. VERY YUMMY!!!

I have been making these popcorn balls since my kids were in grade school. I would send these balls through the mail to all 3 of my girls in college. Now I am sending them to my college kids. They really enjoy them every year for Halloween.
 I use 1 batch of popcorn popped in the stir crazy. I use about 3/4 cup unpopped popcorn for the popper, 3Tbs oil.
I only cook the caramel till it just reaches the soft ball stage. I then pour the caramel over popcorn in a sprayed lge bowl. Stir the caramel and popcorn till slightly cool. Then I use two baggies  over my hands and form into balls and put into a baggie and use a twist tie to preserve and rush to the post office to get them mailed to the kids. Next year it will be 4 kids in college and three different schools.

I think this recipe should read 1/2 cup of unpopped popcorn. A couple of hints would go a long way here too.  Spray your measuring cups, spoons, and the large bowl or pan holding the popcorn with vegetable spray to make it easier.  Also since you are working with blazing hot sticky candy, always keep a large bowl of ice water on your work station to plunge your hands or fingers in if you accidentally get some on your hands. Flavor of the caramel was good.

So easy and tastes great! I used about 1 1/2 cups of unpopped corn and that was plenty for the amount of caramel sauce. But that's just personal opinion. This recipe is a keeper!

The kernels didn't stick together because the ratio is off. Also my caramel was very pale despite following the directions. I ended up with a hot, somewhat sticky mess that I stirred a lot for a more even coat and called it plain caramel corn. Thanks to those who suggested adding salt. Also pretty good with chocolate chips sprinkled into the mess. Just wish it had held together.

It is very tasty but WAY too much popcorn. I cooked all the popcorn it said, and then had to triple the syrup to get enough to hold it all together. Either cut the popcorn in half or triple the syrup. Maybe double would work, but triple is better.

Very good!  Didn't have a candy thermo, ,but i just waited until it was forming small peaks when boiling and took it off the heat and stirred in the vanilla.  We used 2 1/2 bags microwave natural popcorn.  Turned out  perfect.

Ohh my goodness.. these are incredible. We put left over marshmellows from camping into the mix.  Then poured over the popcorn , when it had cooled down a bit, added mini gummy bears and smarties (Christmas colors) and mixed them all together.  These are so tasty, just like my grandmother made.  They will be a Christmas party tradition. My friend and I did 65 balls and I ate two already.

Made this for a Halloween party and it was so easy. Used 3 bags of natural flavor microwave popcorn, put in a paper bag to keep warm, then poured caramel over, needed to wait a few minutes to form balls as the caramel was too hot to handle. Next time need to figure out a way to eliminate the popcorn seeds.

Turned out perfect, but definetly go with 1/2 the amount of popcorn. Also, if you are using leftover already popped popcorn it is about 20 cups pops (or 40 cups popped per the recipe. Also doused the popcorn with a good bit of sea salt...SO GOOD.

Using 3 bags of micro butter pop corn worked perfect. We couldn't find our candy thermometer, but just heated to soft ball stage (which you get to rather quickly) and that worked fine. Thanks!

Delicious for sure but the recipe didn't make enough caramel coating, in my opinion.  I cooked butter-flavored popcorn in the microwave and picked out any unpopped kernels.  The caramel didn't coat each piece of popcorn but it did hold the balls together well.  My kids loved munching on these while on a walk.  Yum!

I tried these today to give away for Christmas.  I used 1 and 1/2 cups unpopped corn and made it in our airpopper.  It made lots of popcorn balls, so there was plenty for giving and eating!  My four children absolutely loved them, and they were very easy to make...I was quite surprised with the simplicity.  It is raining today, and that seemed to have no effect on this delicious treat.  I did cook it to soft ball stage.

2 1/2 cups of unpopped popcorn was WAY TOO MUCH. There wasn't enough caramel to go around. I made 18 very large popcorn balls and had enough popcorn left for 3 or 4 more.

It must've been my fault, b/c I used 3 bags of popcorn, instead of 2.  It didn't have enough caramel for all the popcorn and just didn't suite my taste. I maybe didn't cook it long enough, I'm not sure, sorry.

That was fast! EZ and really quick - i warmed my ingredients first (room temp) and then began adding, mixing then scooping. The whole process took about 14 minutes. The kids love them, thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't like the sweetened condensed milk flavor in these.  It just seemed obvious that it was in there when I was tasting it.  These were chewy which I liked.  I also liked someones idea about putting buttered baggies over your hands to roll the popcorn balls (great tip...made it so much easier and it didn't burn my hands).  But I think I'll stick to the caramel popcorn submitted by Brian on this website.

You only need i/2 the popcorn for this recipe. This recipe does not make enough caramel to cover the popcorn.  I had a ton of left over popcorn at the bottom of the bowl.  The caramel had good flavor though.

This is a terrific recipe.  I, like many others, used microwave popcorn and couldn't believe how simple the overall recipe is.  I will definitely make the caramel and use it in other recipes too.  My family really enjoyed these treats.  Everyone looking for something special should try this recipe.

These were wonderful! The recipe was easy and a lot of fun to do with kids. My 2 year old son had a ball with the sticky carmel. I went light on the oil and the sugar and added food coloring for a halloween theme. I will be making these a lot for the holidays. Thank you suzanne.

These were a hit!  Making them was a fun family activity.  We made all the popcorn, but only ended up using about 2/3 of it, because we wanted more caramel.  We made our balls a little smaller and ended up with 50!  Will keep hold of the recipe for next time.

Turned out good. Used air popper, reduced to 1 1/2 cups   unpopped corn. Made ~20 balls. Dipped my fingers in softened butter and spread over hands to make each ball to keep it from sticking to my hands. Did use a candy thermometer and heated mixture to 238 degrees.

I found that the 2.5 cups of popping corn made way too much popcorn for the volume of caramel sauce . I kept back about 12 cups of popped corn. Made 25 balls which were delicious & chewy.

Two and a half cups of unpopped pop corn is way too much. 1/2 cup of kernels makes 4 quarts (8cups) of popped corn. 2 1/2 cups of kernels would make 20 quarts or 40 cups of popcorn. Ridiculous. I use an air popper and measure one half cup of kernels. It makes a 4 quart  mixing bowl full.  Good recipe except the measurement.  1/2 cup kernels makes enough for this recipe. Maybe 1 cup kernels tops.

Worked alright, but the ratio of caramel to popped popcorn was a bit much. If i make them again I would either pop more popcorn or make less caramel

I have never gotten compliments on popcorn balls before, but my daughter took these to her birthday party at school and three - three! - teachers told me how superior they were to other hard and flavorless popcorn balls. And as elementary teachers, they know their popcorn balls. Great recipe!

This is  a great recipe and very easy, but I agree that this is way too much popcorn.  My popcorn balls are a little smaller, because they are easier to handle, but I get  more than 15 balls with just a cup of corn.

This caramel popcorn was delicious!! I liked that it turned out as a softer caramel popcorn rather than a rock hard one. I didn't use a candy thermometer and survived just fine but I wish there was a way to magically get rid of the un popped kernels as they made eating it harder while trying to dodge them. That's my only complaint! I will definitely make this again soon!

Very delicious! The only problem I had was this is not near enough caramel for the amount of popcorn. I made one batch and had to make another, and I tripled the second batch and I did have a lil left over. Over all very good, reminds me of my moms.

These were a huge hit for my son's class party last week. Super easy to make! I taped down wax paper on my kitchen table to mix the popcorn with the sauce, and used ziploc bags on my hands to keep them from getting sticky. Totally not disappointed with this easy recipe!

Sometimes you need that token  christmas "gift" for neighbor's and casual friends. I usually do Spritz cookies, but wasn't really feeling that idea this year. For some reason I thought to do popcorn balls and having never done them before, I needed a recipe. I went back and forth between a few but ultimately decided on this one. I was slightly intimidated by the fact that I needed a candy thermometer but I decided to forge on a conqueror my fear of that because even thought that sounded a little complicated, the recipe was very use friendly and had many rave reviews to it's credit.
The recipe was easy and yielded an awesome end result. A true winner

I made these today for my husband and granddaughters and they are wonderful. Very easy recipe to follow, the only things I changed was the amount of popcorn, I only used 1 1/2 cups unpopped popcorn and it was the perfect ratio to caramel and I also used dark corn syrup and dark brown sugar instead of light. I found it gave it such a nice old fashioned flavor. These are nice chewy, flavorful and easy popcorn balls. Just make sure you pick out any seeds left over before mixing and also to avoid a false reading on your candy thermometer do not let the tip touch the bottom of the hot pot. If you are going to use the amount of unpopped corn as stated I suggest doubling the caramel part of the recipe.  I will definitely be making these for the upcoming holidays.

I think you need far more of the syrup.  (Don't cut the popcorn.  That just doesn't make sense.)  To those who it came out brittle, it is a very specific temperature. You cannot hit 239 or 240 or you have a brittle caramel when cooled.  I probably hit 237 because I let it touch the bottom of the 238 line.  I like gooey popcorn balls.

As for the flavor...it was pretty good.
