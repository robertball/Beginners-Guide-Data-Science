I had a little fresh cauliflower in the fridge, so I decided to give this recipe a try for lunch today.   I halved the recipe, used reduced-fat/lightened ingredients where possible, and steamed the cauliflower for about 2-1/2 minutes in the microwave.   The addition of the sour cream and that little bit of sugar really make this taste different.  Honestly, I couldn't tell I was even eating cauliflower, it just blended so well with the chopped eggs and the texture was about the same.  This was a pleasant surprise, and I definitely will make this again.

Delicious and much easier and healthier than potato salad.  I added 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard and used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  Turned out great!  I will definitely make it again.

Pretty bland.  Needs another ingredient to wake it up.  I served it at a family lunch, and everyone agreed it lacked something.

I bought pre-cut cauliflower and made half the recipe, only leaving out the celery - I did not miss it a bit. The salad was delicious! I hope to make it again.

Delicious I didn't use sugar or sour cream and still loved it
