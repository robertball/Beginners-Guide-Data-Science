This recipe looks weird, but it works. It's not as dry as I'm used to breakfast bars being, tastes a lot like an amped up bowl of oatmeal. I used raisins instead of craisins because that's what I had and no nuts because I don't like them. The caffeine content is comparable to a cup of tea. It's great to have a grab and go breakfast that includes my caffeine fix!
