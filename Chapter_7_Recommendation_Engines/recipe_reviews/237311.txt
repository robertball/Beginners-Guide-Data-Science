Ok so I gave it 5 stars as a basic recipe but I use all low fat ingredients and also I can't imagine how you cook the noodles first and they dont get mushy. I use the crock pot daily and know you don't need to so I don't make it this complicated. I like easy and low mess. I take butter (I use only about 1/4 of stick) rub it around the sides and leaf it in the middle. Dump the noodles (uncooked), milk (though I use the larger can of reduced fat condensed and the less than 2 cups of skim milk),cheddar soup and salt and pepper in the crockpot. I mix 1 egg in the cup I measured the milk in with that fork and add to crockpot. Then I stir it all up. And half the cheese and walk away. After an hour and half on low I add the other half of the cheese and its done around 2-2.5 hrs and the noodles are cooked fine and its plenty cheesy. Adding the cheese towards the end allows the noodles to cook and keeps the cheese from getting that weird curdled texture. If i wanted it creamier I'd add more butter or milk I guess but its great like this. 5 stars because I couldn't have concocted it without this to start with and this with some bacon in it is my family's favorite.

I made this on Easter 2014.  I usually don't try a recipe the first time with company coming over, but it sounded like it would be good.  I wasn't disappointed.  It was perfect!  It was creamy and cheesy and exactly  what I was looking for.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used a mixture of Sharp and Medium Cheddar Cheese.  This will be the Macaroni and Cheese that I will be making for Christmas when everyone comes over.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Recipe turned out really good.  I was skeptical since there was only a few reviews (I tend to rely on them alot) but I made it anyway for a cookout and I got several compliments and there wasn't a noodle left to take home.  I used shell pasta and boiled it about 1/2 done.  I used 3/4 stick of butter (since a whole stick seemed like a lot) and I used only about 3/4 of the cheese (again, it just seemed like a lot to me).  I accidentally bought the large can of evaporated milk and noticed after adding it to the pasta.  So I just used 1 cup of 2% milk instead of the 2 cups.  I used Campbell's nacho cheese soup which gave it a little extra kick.  I will probably try using 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 pepper jack next time to give it even more spice.  Cooked on low about 2 hours and stirred a few times while cooking.  I was really impressed with the outcome.

I have made this exact recipe given to me by a friend that swore it was to die for.  I didn't like it, I prefer baked mac&c w/bread crumbs on top.  I have used the cheddar cheese soup in a baked mac&c dish to try another version of it and it turned out ok, but I always go back to my standard recipe that I like.

The thing is w/crock pots if I have to do any pre-cooking, or browning etc. to me that defeats the purpose of crock pot cooking.  I like recipes where I put everything at once in the crock pot and just turn it on, that is what makes it easy.  If I have to saute, brown, boil, items I may as well just use the stove and pots and pans.

I would give this recipe a 10 if I could!  I made this for a friends wedding, so I changed the servings to 96...yes 96!  This was THE biggest batch of anything I've ever made in my life!  I was forced to make some ingredient changes because the store I went to didn't have enough cheddar cheese soup, so I ended up using Sharp Velveeta instead and the texture and flavor were great!  I don't think there was one person at the wedding that didn't ask who made it and what the recipe was!  As you can tell I highly recommend this very forgiving, delicious recipe!  Thanks Cathy P. for sharing!

I used this recipe as a starting point. It came out great! Didn't cook pasta, used whole wheat and regular mixed. I try to avoid canned stuff, so I replaced the condensed cheese soup with 10 ounces of water and an extra 1/2 cup cheese. I used 8 oz of cheddar and about 10 oz of a combination of Parmesan, mozzarella, Asiago, and feta (I had them in the fridge). Also added 1 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp each cayenne, mustard powder,  nutmeg and paprika, and omitted the salt. Because I was home, I added the cheddar in the last hour of cooking as recommended by others. I'll probably make another batch next week! Thank you, Cathy P!

It's a very nice, easy recipe. I deleted the butter, with the exception of buttering the slow cooker before adding the ingredients.  There is plenty fat in the cheese. I replaced the eggs with 2 Tablespoons of flour.  My suggestion is to delay adding  the top layer of cheese until half way through the cooking time. Give it a stir, then add the top layer of cheese.  Old cheddar may curdle, so use mild, or medium.  Also, I mixed it all in the slow cooker to reduce dish washing.  I wish that the measures were in metric units.

The last time I cooked for a potluck at work my dish ended up being cold and therefore not as tasty as it should be.  I was asked to make Mac and cheese for today, which I usually bake but I wanted to use a slow cooker so it would be hot.  I was dubious about this but I gave it a try and everyone loved it! I followed the recipe exactly and it was easy enough to just throw together this morning and it was hot and ready by lunch.   This one is definitely going into my cookbook.  I think it would be even better with some spicer cheeses if you are into that kind of thing but for a group potluck this dish as it is was a hit!

If you follow the recipe as written, it comes out tasty but the cheese melts funny so the texture is off.

I followed the directions of another reviewer who said not to cook the noodles and only add half the cheese at first and then add the other half after 90 minutes. It worked great!

Made this recipe today,  was very very good..I do still prefer the baked taste though but this is great. One thing I had an issue with was I didn't think it was cheesy enough, but I lovvve cheese so maybe its just me lol was very good, was skeptical to try because I never heard of it in slow cooker but  im glad I did!

My friend, Jeannine, had me over for dinner and made this in the crock pot. I love Mac and Cheese and I am a big fan. I have to say this was probably THE BEST Mac and Cheese I have ever had. I HAD to get this recipe! REALLY, really yummy, probably one of the best any of us will ever taste! I like Kelsey's idea of adding some chipotle sauce to leftovers the next day, too!

My husband and kids loved this.  I however needed a much creamier consistency.  I will make this the next time with Velveeta Cheese and put it in the oven with bread crumbs on top.  However very good recipe and thank you for sharing it.

I generally stay away from dishes that include canned soup in the ingredients but based on the reviews, I decided to give this a try. The only change I made was that I cooked it in the oven. It was absolutely fantastic. I dont know if its the egg or the soup or the evap milk but it was delish. This will be my go to mac and cheese dish from now on. The only think I will do different next time is add a crumb topping of some sort.

Made this for a church pot-luck lunch this weekend. Was VERY well received. I was actually standing in line right in front of some kids who were wanting seconds and they pleaded with me not to take it all! I'll take that endorsement! And you HAVE to give it high marks for ease of preparation. I cooked the "mac" for the 8 minutes called for on the box. I probably could have gotten away with 7, but I can't say that it got mushy. I made just one tweak to the original recipe because of what I had (or rather, DIDN'T have) on hand. Since I didn't have the canned soup, I opted instead for cubing up some "processed cheese product" (about 8 ounces) and melting it into the milk by heating the mixture a couple of minutes at a time in the microwave. I might add just a splash of heavy cream to the mix if I do it that way again, just to make up for a bit of moisture that might have been in the soup.  Other than that, it's really just mix in the crock-pot and go.  And it certainly did disappear quickly. I will definitely keep this one in the arsenal.  Thanks for this recipe.

I'm allergic to MSG so I couldn't use the canned cheese sauce/soup... instead I used ricotta cheese and it turned out great :).  I am not the best cook in the world lol, and I have tried a lot of mac and cheese recipes that came out horrible, but this one is a keeper and I am super thankful because my family loves mac and cheese!

This was so good!! I made it for my family this Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I made 18 servings instead of 12, and instead of campbells cheese soup I used Progresso recipe starters in three cheese. The grocery store was out of elbow mac so I picked up mini penne. This is a great recipe.

tried this recipe and was great. My whole family loved it. Did a few modifications to it like added 24 ozs. of cheddar cheese and 2-3 pinches of paprika. I kinda messed up making it as well. Made the macaroni with butter then all the other ingredients just kinda got mixed in a bowl then added to the mac. Turned out great, everyone was raving about it. It's a forgiving recipe. Definitely recommended!

This dish was fantastic! Was the only dish that was completely gone at the end of our company dinner. I made the recipe per directions. I used an 8 oz. block of mild cheddar cheese and an 8 ounce block of medium cheddar cheese and I shredded them myself. I think this makes a creamier dish. The only other thing I did was add 2 heaping teaspoons of dry ground mustard. That''

I doubled the recipe and followed the directions exactly for doubling.  However, before putting it in the crockpot, I divided it between (2) 9x13 pans and baked for 45 minutes on 350 and then transferred it to the crock pot since there was so much. When I first mixed everything, it looked so liquidy, but don't mind that. It sets up really nicely. It is very creamy and very cheesy. We put a lot of salt and pepper in ours and even added some Parmesan cheese at the very end. Oh, I did mix sharp cheddar and mild cheddar. It would be fun to experiment with different cheeses.

The worst.
Used condensed milk, whole milk, 1 egg, 1/4 stick butter, uncooked noodles, put half the cheddar in the beginning and the rest after 1.5 hours.  I had to stop it 15 minutes later because it was already a glue-like consistency.  After tasting it, I removed all the plates and threw it out.  Taste and consistency was terrible.

I basically followed recipe but used reviewer Chijules tips for making without pre-cooking macaroni.  I also used a 12 oz can of eva milk, reduced milk to 1-1/2 C and 1 egg.  Easy assembly and cooked in my pot in about 2 hours.  For a final topping, I melted about 2T butter and tossed some panko bread crumb and toasted them before sprinkling on top before serving.  Perfectly cooked & ready to eat!  One addtl note:  this went to a potluck and spent almost 2 more hours on Low (no Warm setting on my pot).  The macaroni started to dry out although taste was still good.  I think next time I would increase milk to 2-1/2 C to keep macaroni moist IF pot will be standing for some time.  Overall a great recipe and one I know I will continue to use in the future!

What a disaster! I followed the recipe to the letter (I always do making something for the first time) and it turned out like a tasteless gluey mass of ! The pasta was way over done and it was NOT creamy, it was not cheesy and it was bland.

I read the review from another member and followed her ideas. So I used:
less butter  (1/4c)
only 1 large egg
Combination of sharp cheddar & Monterey Jack cheeses - added half of the cheese & cooked for 1.5 hours, then stirred & added the rest of the cheese for the remaining time. 
Little to no salt ( a pinch of sea salt)
Lemon pepper & Mrs Dash in addition to black pepper
1% milk 
Uncooked elbow macaroni
3 slices of bacon, cooked in microwave and drained of fat before crumbling and added to crockpot. 

Brought it to a pot lunch where it was kept on warm for 90 minutes. This allowed the flavors to blend together. 
Well received, even by my Mac and cheese connoisseur so will definitely make it again.

This was a good basic recipe. Due to time constraints during the week I assembled it the night before and then put in the oven for about an hour/hour and a half when I got home from work. It had a really good taste to it but for some reason it wasn't as creamy as I would have liked. The cheese got a little bit clumpy for some reason. Next time I will try it in the crock pot where it can cook for longer at a lower temperature and see if that helps at all. All in all it's a pretty good recipe.

This was easy to assemble and very fuss free. Unfortunately, for me, it was still not very tastey. It did curdle and I tempered the egg into it so not sure of the problem. For me, it just didnt' have that sharp good creamy mac and cheese taste. And I used 16 ounces of extra sharp cheddar cheese I personally grated. It didn't go to waste, though. I made a batch of taco meat and the next two nights I made a taco mac and cheese casserole out of it by adding parts of the mac to some of the taco meat, mixed in sour cream and more milk, and cheese, then baking it. This, my family loved.

I did not care for this recipe. I used wheel-shaped pasta for my daughter and didn't boil it first so it wouldn't be mushy. I stirred every half hour. I even put it on warm after 2 hours. The result was gluey; so disappointed! I'll stick with stove top or baked.

I made this according to the instructions and it was good, but I added some spicy chipotle sauce to it when I re-heated leftovers the next day and it was much better. I also put some Parmesan on top. Mmm. :)

I made this tonight and it was amazing! It was light and didn't feel heavy on the stomach like most Mac and cheese recipes do. Only suggestion I would make is to slightly grease your slow cooker before adding in everything.

I tried this two ways: the first was with uncooked pasta and extra liquid. The rest of the recipe I followed pretty closely (I happened to have mild cheddar on hand). It was very bland with a weird aftertaste (perhaps from the soup?) and the pasta was just al dente after about 4 hours.

I remade it today for a work luncheon and made the following changes: I cooked the pasta for five minutes beforehand. I used mild AND sharp cheddar. I skipped the soup entirely, adding a little extra milk and 1/2 cup additional cheese instead. It's perfect!

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was great.  I increased the ingredients to serve 16 people, used a 7 quart slow cooker and it took about 2-1/2 hours on low.  It was nice and cheesy, the edges were just starting to brown which is my sons favorite part.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for our work potluck yesterday and everyone liked it! I wasn't sure about adding ingredients like cheddar cheese soup, eggs and evaporated milk--and making a new recipe for a group gathering--but it came out PERFECT. It tastes like the delicious, creamy, cheesy mac and cheese everyone loves. The only thing I did differently was that I only cooked the macaroni for 5 minutes, and I cooked it on low for 2 hours. It seemed done at that point, so I turned it to "warm" and it was perfectly cooked and at the ideal temperature by the time of the lunch potluck. Also, I used a crockpot liner for easy cleanup...great idea!

This was awesome!  I would add more cheese maybe or change it up with spicy cheese.  The butter really helped it not to burn or stick to the sides.  Definitely a keeper!

Delicious but how can it not be when it's this sinful.  I snuck in 5 oz of butternut squash puree but will do more next time because I couldn't taste it at all and it didn't affect the consistency.  I used slightly less cheese and will try with less butter next time.

I undercooked the noodles by 2 minutes according to the package directions and would probably do 4 minutes less next time. My crockpot has a timer so I checked it at 2.5 hours and most of the edges were beginning to scorch and overcook. My husband is unique and likes that taste so it wasn't a loss, I'm just glad I checked it. My kids are Kraft die hard fans so I have quite a few leftovers. Overall a yummy, easy slow cooker meal to add to my rotation.

I've lost count of how many times I've made this now. Ppl request it for potlucks and holiday dinners, its definitely a favorite! I usually double it for my larger crockpot, and use four different types of cheese (four 8oz bags). Cheddar blend, Colby Jack, mozzarella and provolone.

I must have done something wrong.  Didn't have much flavor and the pasta turned out mushy.  I would cook the pasta very little in the boiling water next time - but not sure I would make it again.    Oddly enough, the rest of the group liked it - they didn't love it, but they ate it and took some home.

I forgot to add the eggs, and added sliced spam. I'd make this again, an appreciate the ease. Also, I used rotini noodles rather than elbow. I did not boil the noodles before hand, just threw it all in as a reviewer suggested, and mixed with mild cheddar the can of soup some milk and heavy cream. I set it on low for an hour and a half. I mixed, then topped with sharp cheddar cheese and left it for another hour and a half. It was perfect! Everyone loved it.

This was great! I have made it twice.  As much as I don't like condensed soup this was really easy. My changes: 16 ounce package of large macaroni noodles, one 10-12 ounce can of evaporated milk, I shredded 2 1/2 blocks of mild cheddar these and I added 2 teaspoons of dry mustard with salt and pepper to taste. I did not cook my noodles all the way, I stopped about 2 minutes shy of the package directions. This was assembled as directed and cooked on low for 3 hours.

This turned out great! I followed another reviewers advice and put the macaroni in dry with all ingredients and half the cheese. I set the slow cooker on high for and hour and a half and then added the rest of the cheese until melted. Only took about 2 hrs. total.  I will make this again and again.

The cheese coagulated. It was not creamy at all. I didn't understand what the egg was for but I didn't omit it. Yuck. Even the 3 year old birthday girl wouldn't eat it.

Family and office favorite!!
I made it as directed and it was great. I had an ofc pot luck coming up and tried out a couple of different foods on my family. They liked both but this one was the winner. My ofc devoured it and from that day foward they automatically write this down for me to make. The last 2 times I had to make 2 crock pots and bring them in. I still only had a couple of spoonfuls left. It is a winner for sure!

Tasted pretty plain with the amount of seasoning called in the directions. I cooked the noodles half way, and they came out perfectly on low at nearly 2 hours. 

The problem with the recipe is that the cheese separated which seems to be the problem a lot of people had. I added half of the cheese in the beginning, and the other half 1 hour in. 20 minutes after that I stirred, and the cheese looked perfect. 30 minutes after that the cheese was separating so I removed it from the heat. 

I'd say add in the cheese 20 minutes before you take it off the heat. It doesn't make for a good crock pot recipe since it's done in only 2 hours and needs to be stirred and have things added to it, but it can be done I guess.

I followed the instructions and ended up with a sauce that had a curdled texture instead of being cheesy or creamy.  The dish tasted fine, but I was really turned off by the texture.  I wont make it again.

Rich, creamy and cheesey- this recipe did not disappoint and was a breeze to put together! I used 8oz of cheddar and 8oz of pepper jack for an extra kick and it came out great! This will likely be my go-to MnC recipe for years to come.

Family loved this! I made a few modifications... I used cellentani pasta, still like macaroni but more fun & hearty. I used Campbell's nacho cheese soup instead for more flavor and I definitely wasn't shy with the pepper. I think next time I make this, I'll add diced tomatoes with green chiles for a kick!

Very good - I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using only 3/4 of the butter called for. The recipe made a generous amount - this would be ideal to bring to a pot luck.  Thank you Cathy P.

It wasn't horrible but it wasn't terrific either. The cheese seemed a bit on the runny side with small "curds" (if that's the word I'm looking for) in it.

1/14 very good.  i boiled the elbow almost all the way but not quite.  i used about 1 cup of shredded taco mix cheese and one whole chunk of extra sharp cabot.  i mixed in a little siracha hot sauce wiht the milk and cheese soup to give it a little kick. and i only had one egg, it was good that way, I also tried it with 2 eggs and thought it was better with 1.   turned out really good.  would make again.  to prevent the curdles, add half the cheese after halfway.

This recipe is super easy to put together. I also added extra shredded cheese and used both cheddar and Colby jack. There was quite a bit of grease on top of cheese from butter or melted cheese. I used paper towel to absorb before serving. This is really creamy and great tasting Mac and cheese. Really enjoyed!

Cheesy goodness! I would cut back on the butter, because it kinda floats on top after the cheese melts in. Very creamy sauce from the ingredients! This would be great for a potluck! I cooked my noodles for 5 minutes and the mac and cheese was done at about 2 1/2 hours on low. I used smoked paprika on top and it added in more flavor!

Do not put eggs in this!!  The reviews that say it is always a huge hit at family gatherings are just being told by family/friends it is good.  I am sorry but it sucked.  The eggs ruin it.  They give it a gritty type of texture.  Not creamy AT ALL!  And i put a huge amount of cheese in it.  The evaporated milk may not be a good idea either.

I did not add the paprika and definitely think I should have done so.  I made it for a large group though and wasn't sure they'd all like "spicy."  Additionally, I had to cook it at a higher temperature to make sure it was done in time for the gathering.

I sprinkled some breadcrumbs on the top and baked it in the oven. Then, I sprinkled powdered cayenne instead of paprika, and a little salt on top. My husband thought it was perfect. I thought it was a bit bland, but the crusty top and cayenne really made it tasty.

Made this(1.5x portion—so 24oz of pasta) for a Thanksgiving work potluck and I’m surprised at how well this turned out considering how easy it was!! Followed the advice from other comments and did not cook the pasta beforehand(added 10oz of water to the Crockpot), rubbed the pot with the butter but did not melt it, and put in a half of the cheese at the start and the rest in the last hour. Used a mix of about 25% pepper jack and 75% medium cheddar, though next time I might use more pepper jack. Because some of my coworkers don’t eat eggs, I did not include them. Seemed almost a little too liquidy, but ended up being perfect. Make sure to watch this closely as the timing will depend on your slow cooker—I was strapped for time so I raised it to high for 45 minutes.  This was a huge hit! Making again for my family’s Thanksgiving celebration.

As with any slow cooker recipe, I hate having to precook anything. I decided to just throw the raw noodles in the mix and it came out delicious. I buttered the dish and then added a few pats of butter on top. The only reason I give it 4stars instead of 5 is because the 2 times I've made it, it has this weird sweetness to it... it's still a delicious recipe, just wish I could figure out how to cut out that sweet taste.

This was a hit!  I made a couple changes as suggested by others and it came out great.  I didn’t boil the macaroni.  I used half sharp cheddar and half Monterrey Jack.  I put half the cheese in at the start, and the rest when the pasta was tender, which was about 1 hour 45 minutes on low.  Then I stirred it and put on warm until time to serve.  Everyone loved it!!

Loved it. I took it to a dinner and there were no leftovers. I did cut the noodle cook time in half before I placed it in the slow cooker.

I love this recipe for two reasons— it is very easy to put together and since it cooks in the slow cooker it is ideal for big meals when the oven is occupied. Right after it is done, it tastes excellent. In my opinion it is not as good when reheated as leftovers— it becomes thick and a little bland. Still a very good recipe and will definitely make again for first two reasons mentioned.

I didn't know what kind of cheddar cheese to use. I'll use medium and sharp next time. I also had to add a lot of salt, pepper, paprika, and chili powder to give it flavour. I added an extra can of condensed cheese soup. However, this was a good base recipe to use.

Great recipe. The store didn't have cheddar soup so I substituted cream of chicken and it turned out just fine! Will make again.

I made this for a work pot luck and it was very good.  I did not cook the macaroni and used a combination of pepper jack cheese and Mexican blend. Used half of the butter and added seasonings: garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, less salt and added paprika.  This was ready in less than 2 hours and I needed to add additional milk to keep it moist.  All in all, it was a hit even though it was just a little mushy.

This is a easy , delicious, creamy Mac and Cz recipe! My son likes it cooked a bit more to lessen the creaminess.Its easy to tweet too. Use different flavor cheese, less of one ingredients and more of another. I don’t think you can mess this recipe up. It’s good served as a main dish or as a side. 
 Today I’m making it as a side with  grilled chicken breast and broccoli . Yumm..

I shared this with my daughter and no matter when we make it and where we share it, it is a huge hit. There is never any to bring home. Even at home, we never have leftovers and if we don, they’re gone by the following day.

Turned out well, not as creamy as I envisioned more like a backed Mac and cheese. I left it exactly 3 hours because we were out of the house. In future I might watch it closer and maybe stop it sooner. Flavor was great though and we all enjoyed.

Definitely a keeper. I doubled this recipe & made it 3 times in 1 week. 1st ?? concession stand ... followed the recipe exactly (no paprika) ~ the noodles got too soggy over time but it sold out. 2nd time ?? varsity team dinner (girls insisted I make it again) - boiled the noodles for 3.5 minutes, cooked on low for 3 hours, noodles were better but still a little soft. 3rd ?? sleepover, we didn’t boil the noodles, put them in and cooked on high for 1 hour then low. The noodles got gummy and clumped together, I tried to add milk but it took away from the cheese flavor. Needless to say the girls finished the double batch. Next time I will boil them for 2 to 2.5 minutes cook it on low for 2.5 to 3 hours and make sure to serve it right away.

I made this EXACTLY as written. My kids did not like it at all. They said the texture was way too weird. I agree. The noodles were mushy and the sauce broke and was really grainy. Won't not be making this one again.

I made this last night and will make this my go to recipe for mac & cheese in the crockpot!

I only cooked the macaroni for 4 minutes because I knew it would cook more in my crockpot (which usually over heats) and I added a lot of black pepper, but I followed the recipe without any other changes.  

Before I turned the crockpot on I thought that there was way too much liquid but it turned out great!

I always make changes to most recipes  to adapt to our tastes. Looking at the ingredients and others suggestions I did alter by adding to , but not taking away from original recipe. Being a big fan of the carmelized onion and bacon  mac' n cheese recipe. I added the mustard and spices to the egg mixture and then again to the milk and soup mixture. Instead of straight cheddar, half was shredded muenster (buttery goodness). Carmelized onions and garlic during the butter and noodle step and at the end adding the milk soup mixture and cheese ... added more dry mustard, paprika, salt n pepper  and red pepper flakes with about  3 tablespoons of bacon drippings  (from bacon baked in oven for toppings during serving) ; stirred until combined.  After cooking 1-1/2 hours ... added more muenster and cheddar for last 30-45 minutes or until done.
For my first attempt to ever cook the "sanctified man 'n cheese" in a crock pot ... not too bad of a turn out.  It still needed more seasoning (Paprika, salt and black pepper) and perhaps a sharper cheddar and/or Asiago .  All in all though not bad for a crock pot version of the oven baked classic.  The oven melts the cheeses better and makes it creamier than this turned out (maybe a cup of Velveeta to help with the creaminess it was missing). It was good, needs some more tweeks for our family, but we will make again.

I followed some suggestions from other reviewers. I did not precook the pasta or add salt. I did add the onion powder, dry mustard and chili powder as recommended. My wife did not care for the texture and thought the flavor was just ok. I think it could use additional seasoning. I might make it again to modify the recipe.

This was okay.  I gave it 4 stars because like another reviewer, I wouldn't have had a starting point if not for this recipe. 
I found it to be bland made according to the recipe.  Once it was made and I tasted it, I ended up adding smoked paprika (not regular paprika) to it which was a nice flavor and took away the blandness.
I will make this again, but I think I might not just aff smoked paprika, but also a blend of cheeses.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. I boiled the pasta about 4 min first and it really only needed about an hour or so on low in the slow cooker. The cheese does want to star sort of start curdling if you keep cooking it too long. I made mine with a 12 oz can of evaporated milk and no regular milk since I accidentally bought the big can. I should mention, I halved the recipe...which still made a whole crock pot full!!! Really easy recipe and yummy!

Came out great and was a huge hit at a party I took this to.
Couple of changes I made:
1. Added 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour to give it more texture.
2. Added the second batch of cheese halfway through cooking rather than the start of cooking.
3. Cooked for 2 hours instead of 3. This gives the macaroni some great bite. Though your mileage may vary.

Was good, but I think either my slow cooker was either too hot a setting or was overcooked a bit.  Going to try a lower temp and/or cook time.

Very good mac and cheese! Gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because I cooked the noodles for a little less time (4 minutes) added a few more ounces of cheese and a small dot of mustard.  The whole family loved this!

I will definitely make it again. I only had fiesta nacho cheddar soup but everyone liked it. I would cook it a little less- I thought it got a tad overdone,

Delicious, and very creamy. My husband didn’t even eat the pork so he could have more Mac and cheese! Will definitely make this again for our family gatherings.

This is a keeper! I made this exactly as stated and it was a crowd pleaser.  This comes out very much like a traditional baked mac n cheese. What I love about making it in the slow cooker is that it frees up the oven, you dont have to watch it and it is very portable. I'm making this again because it was so easy and tasted amazing!

I just made this, followed recipe exactly.  I am not cooking it 3 hours because this seems too much cooking.  Cooking for one hour on high.  I will see if this resolves the recipe problems.

There is a big problem with this recipe for a slow cooker.  The cheese will separate and the noodles will overcook when left in the pot for 2 1/2 hours.

I used a high setting and limited the cooking time to one hour.  The cheese sauce stayed creamy and the noodles did not fall apart.

Also, the recipe will stick to the sides of the pot and it is a mess to clean.

Tasty dish although a bit dry. Next time I will use the whole can of evaporated milk. Added 1/2 of the cheese after 1 1/2 hours of cooking.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe. I probably wouldn't make it again but it turned out edible. The cheese kinda turned out super lumpy and it was super bland.

This Mac and cheese was easy to assemble and was a creamy yummy delight. Not for those days when you are counting calories for sure but well worth the calorie intake when you are looking for indulgment.

My husband and I really enjoyed this and making it in the crockpot cut down the time I needed to make it.  Unfortunately my grand daughters were not big fans.  All they like is Kraft Macaroni and Cheese with that powdered cheese.  Yulk.

After reading previous reviews, a lot of people mentioned of it turning out custard like and not creamy.  Personally, I find I need to always increase the amount of liquid with any recipe as I prefer a creamy sauce no matter what dish.  I chose to do so this time as well and it wasn't too thick.  I also chose to slightly precook my pasta as I find a lot of starch comes off pasta and I don't want that cooked into the dish which I believe would only add to the custard like state and thicken it up.  I also did not add any salt as I have salt cautious people in my family and I like people to add it only if they wish.  Nobody did though.

Just Awful..... pasta was overcooked, it was lumpy and greasy.  You can barely taste the cheese, grease floating around everywhere and why cook the pasta before if it's going to turn out all pasty and falling apart. Definitely don't recommend and will never try this one again.

Followed the recipe to a tee and it turned out very well. No amount was given for the salt in which i did add a little more after adding about a half teaspoon while combining ingredients.  I made this for a family card party and it was devoured in short time with many complements.  I don't buy shredded cheese in a bag and grated from block.  My favorite thing about the recipe was the taste and ease of preparation.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was good and pretty easy. I made the recipe as written and my company really liked it. For them I am giving 4 stars but for me only 3. It was good (and actually better the next day) but I like my mac and cheese with a little more bite. When I make it in the oven I usually add feta for an extra kick.

delicious, I added cut up bratwurst and used penne. Followed other reviewers to not pre cook pasta but it was a little too crunchy still when done. Will partially precooked next time.

Made a double batch, added an extra can of condensed cheese soup.  It was good but needs an extra kick of cheese flavour, but not sure how to get it, maybe more cheese, or sharper cheddar.

I follow the recipes except few minor changes:  I used half sharp cheddar and half mild cheddar cheese, I did reduce
the amount of butter to 4 tablespoons and used 2% milk
instead of whole.  It turned out fine!  Very easy and I will
make this again.

this was so so.  My crock pot may run a little on the hot side or something because at 1 1/2 hours this was creamy delicious looking Mac and cheese, so I put the crock pot on the "keep warm" setting but by the end of the 2-2 1/2 hours recommended cook time it was dried out, and the cheese was separating.  Everyone ate it still, it didn't taste bad, but it was on the bland side and my kids, who LOVE Mac and cheese, didn't like it.  I took the leftovers and added a little more water, milk, and cheese as well as a little more salt and pepper, and warmed it on the stove.  It did regain a creamier texture, and the kids received it much bette that way.  I would consider making it again, but I would need to kick up the flavor some, and probably serve it after an hour and half of cooking.

Holy smokes this was absolutely amazing!! Ive never cooked mac and cheese in the slow cooker and I have to say Im impressed. Best Mac and Cheese Ive had. Only change I made was 2 cups of uncooked elbow macaroni didn't seem like a lot so I used 5 cups. It was easy to make didn't take long and was really yummy. Layering half the cheddar on top is such a good idea. Really good. Thanks for the recipe.

Follow it to a "T" every time I make it. Way easier than baked Mac n cheese and just as good. I consider it my "secret recipe" because no one knows it's done in the slow cooker and no one would ever guess the ingredients (i.e soup and evaporated milk). One of my go to recipes.

Omitted the egg and doubled the recipe.  Added some garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne. This was delicious!  Making for our Christmas get together.  I need to try making it without precooking the macaroni.  Use whatever cheese you like.  I used Mexican, Swiss, cheddar, Velveeta and mozzarella. It wold be awesome with a can of Rotel thrown in at the end!

Made this for Thanksgiving for our grandkids.  Well, the kids loved it and the adults loved it too and finished it off!  The only change I made, I added 1/4 teaspoon dry mustard and 4oz more cheddar cheese.  Delicious!!  Several people went home with the recipe!

It was a hit on Thanksgiving especially with my very picky son. When I make it again, I will add more than the half a cup of cheese to the pasta instead of putting so much on the top. Other than that, I would not change a thing.

Straight out of the slow cooker it wasn't bad at all. 
After a few days in the fridge and warmed with the microwave it was below average.

I made it exactly as described, no modifications.  It was easy, cheesy, delicious and the best mac and cheese I have ever made.  My 11 year old son agrees and took it to the next level by saying that it was the best mac and cheese he has ever had.  His friends agreed!

Doubled it and added cubed ham and frozen peas so it was more of a complete dish. My adult sons weekly card game players ate every bite and can't wait for it be served again. Very creamy and tasty.

I used penne pasta because I make everything with that. I boiled it for 3 minutes because I prefer it a little firmer. The grocery store I was shopping at didn't have cheddar cheese soup so I tried alfredo sauce instead. I then decreased the whole milk to 1 cup. Set on low in the crock pot for 3 hours as instructed. It got really crusty on the bottom which I think is the best part. I made this for a birthday party that I ended up not going to. I'm not ashamed to admit that I ate all of it over the course of 4 days and didn't tire of it at all. I will definitely make again.

Unfortunately I was out of some of these ingredients, like milk and evaporated milk, so I improvised.
 I cook the pasta to Al Dente and then mixed up a can of coconut milk with the eggs, mixed it with the pasta, and then I replace the milk with whole milk ricotta cheese and mixed up with canned cheese soup, mixed it up with the pasta and added a thick layer of cheddar cheese and cooked on low for 2-3 hours. Just before serving I also added a few handfuls of crushed Ritz crackers to top.
This recipe was a huge hit! Was so delish. I had lots of people asking for the recipe and my husband has declared I need to make it for dinner for our family (so he can use the leftovers for work!)

Fit the bill as far as what I needed for a hot day's  side dish.  I didn't want to heat up my kitchen so putting the slow cooker on the deck worked great!  Flavor was good, texture was a little curdled but maybe I did something wrong?

I made this based on the reviews it had, but I wasn't very pleased. It was pretty bland. My husband added spaghetti sauce to it to boost the flavor. I won't be making this again

This is a wonderful and easy recipe. I didn't change a thing. I'd suggest stirring periodically; my slow cooker overdid it around the edges (not bad, it just tasted like cheddar crackers!).

This was pretty good. Seemed like it was kind of bland though so maybe sharper cheddar.  I think I used a little less than called for though since I was a little short.  Went over pretty good at the potluck.

I have never made a slow cooker mac and cheese that I liked as much as the baked version, but I followed these easy  directions, doubled the recipe, added one extra 8oz bag of shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese, and it was PERFECT!   My party guests raved about my delicious mac and cheese, and I loved it too  :)

Of the slow cooker macaroni and cheese recipes I have tried, this is the best.  I used chunk cheese and tried to get away with using less (16oz of chunk vs. shredded is quite different) but discovered I need to shred the entire 16oz. of chunk cheese to have it be cheesy enough.  My husband loved this!

I omitted the campbell cheddar soup mix for more cheese and evaporated milk (in a separate pot mixed/melted the two together then add) It taste AMAZING and is a simple recipe to follow/alter. Be careful with salting your water and noodles. I added salt to the water and not directly onto the noodles to avoid over salting.

I made this for a large party that was serving 90% Irish food. We had lots of kids coming so I wanted to make something that was kid friendly. Of course everybody ate the macaroni and cheese, not just the kids. I made everything and cooked it in the crockpot on low for about three hours. I only added half the cheese at first, stirred about an hour later and added the rest of the cheese. After another hour it seemed like it needed to be stirred so I stirred it. It got to its full temperature around three hours for me. I cook the noodles for only five minutes. They did not get too mushy. I would definitely add more spices or spicy cheese if I wasn't planning on serving this to kids, however it was still very good the way it was made. It did not get sticky for me.

This turned out really well.  I didn't cook the pasta in advance, and I substituted Velveeta for the shredded cheese so I didn't have to worry about curdling.  A good basic recipe that you don't have to spend a lot of time fussing over.

The recipe was made exactly as described. The macaroni was overdone, though it retained its shape. The cheese 'sauce' broke and seized instantly upon removal from the slow cooker. So my family was left eating greasy elbow macaroni and cheese bits. It was truly disgusting. I don't think I can trust Allrecipes when things turn out so badly after following the instructions exactly. If you look at most of the good reviews, people tweaked the recipe quite a bit to achieve those results.

made this last night  I followed the recipe just as it was written and it was great.  I think next ti,e I'm going to take it and put it in the oven with some bread crumbs on it to give it a little crunch on top.  Other than that I would not change a thing about it.

I thought this was just okay.  It seemed very bland and it wasn't as creamy as I was hoping it would be.  I did like the slow cooker method, but I'll either be tweaking this recipe a lot to suit my tastes or looking for a new recipe entirely.  I did follow the recipe exactly.  I'm not sure why there's so many rave reviews.

Made this because it got good reviews, and it is awesome!  I was concerned it would be mushy because the noodles had to
be precooked.  I did it in the crockpot for 2  1/2 hrs & it was great!  A little more work than some other recipes but it was worth it.

I followed the recipe, but instead of putting everything in the crock pot I put the boiled macaroni in a 1 gallon plastic bag. Then I mushed the bag around & threw it in the fridge(or freezer). Now all ready for the next weekend. Pulled the bag out threw it in the crock pot, threw in some chopped ham or mini hotdogs. Once threw in frozen broccoli -it's all good.

It was a little bland as is, so I added bacon and red pepper; it definitely made it more flavorful. I won't be making this recipe again.

It was not phenomenal, but it was not bad either. It was rather tasteless but I blame not salting the water enough. Also, when done, it was very egg-y so when you mixed it, it curdled a bit. Will try again with just one egg and mixing midway to get the cheese to incorporate better.

I tried to follow this recipe as written but I did not have the amount of butter needed, so I just used what I had.  That being said, I found that the recipe was lacking in cheese, so I added a whole lot more (I almost tripled the amount called for).  I also used a liner bag in the slow cooker so I did not have any burnt edges, etc.  I really liked this mac and cheese and it was a big hit with my Mom.

I usually just snag a recipe on here and I go.  But I registered to let you know how awesome this was!  The first time I needed to double the recipe and thought it looked way too watery for the extra regular milk, so I only did half of the soup and milk mix.  It was still awesome, but after it cooked, I knew it would have been better following it straight.  But people still loved it and they killed my batch.  No leftovers to take home. *sadface*
The next time I just made a single batch for the house.  I have a ceramic pot so I put it in the oven for the last 30 mins so the top would brown.  And OMG!  
I love this recipe!  We never ever have mac and cheese for Thanksgiving, but we will this year!  This had saved my time making, oven space saving dilemma that I have each year with cooking a decent, beautiful, and mad tasty side dish!

ETA:  Either time, I NEVER measured the cheese.  I taste as I go, and probably put more cheese in there than told.  But tasting is the key!  If it is awesome before you set it up for the crockpot, it will be awesomeR more when it's done!   Also, I didn't have paprika,  but I added a couple of dashes of ground red chili flakes in, and it was still crazy mad delicious!

On the whole it was pretty good, though it felt a little boring or bland. I didn't mind making the noodles ahead of time, just makes sense to me.

It was very easy to make, and I could see how trying different things but keeping it mostly the same (such as using sharp vs mild cheddar, or adding tiny bits of jalapeno to the mix) could help improve it for my tastes.

All in all, I liked it, especially with how easy it was to make.

My husband wouldn't touch it.  It just was not ...well for us.  I undercooked the noodles but they were still way over cooked at 2 hours on low in the crockpot.  It was creamy but, I don't know.  I don't think I'm a fan of egg in my macaroni and cheese either.  The concept would have been great for a large gathering but I didn't like it enough to try and fix it.

This was great! Easy to put together and make, as it is a crock pot item, but still maintains great flavor and texture (just be sure to turn down) I served it for my son's 2nd Birthday party, which was all adults, and they all liked it, didn't have any leftover!

It's a nice easy recipe great for a potluck. I like it as is but I typically use a mixture of sharp cheddar with co/jack. I also stir in about 1/4 cups panko bread crumbs and sprinkle another 1/4C on top.

I made this and took it to a potluck. It was delicious. I cooked it for 21/2 hours on low and followed the ingredient amounts. I had some italian cheese mixture that I had to use up so used that plus added sharp cheddar to make up the correct amount. I really liked this and it will be a go to for us. I made this again and 2 things I noted. When you precook the macaroni only cook it for 8 minutes and 2.5 hours on low was long enough or the macaroni at the bottom of the slow cooker gets a bit mushy. Still delicious and I love how I can change up the cheese variety and it still tastes delicious.

My sauce was ready to add pasta after 50 minutes on high and my the whole thing was complete after about 20 minutes on low after adding the pasta.  Cooking any longer dried this mac n chz out horribly!  My girls and I love saucy, cheesy mac n chz (shorter cook time above) not custard like (longer cook time above)!

I have made this a couple times and everyone loves it. I usually make this when I know there are going to be children to feed but the adults are the ones that go up for seconds! I have not changed anything except I usually end up adding more milk at the end so it is creamier and not dry. Yum!

I followed this recipe pretty closely, using a white cheddar and 1% milk instead of whole. I have to say, it was astonishingly greasy. I have never really had something so incredibly rich also taste relatively bland. I am not generally put off by fatty foods at all, but this was too much. I think this recipe needs a lot of tweaking.

Not the best mac and cheese I've ever had, but still pretty good. Not sure I liked the flavor of the egg in the recipe and my try it again without it, but otherwise it was pretty good.

Creamy and cheesy and the noodles were not at all soggy, which was my biggest concern with cooking mac and cheese in the slow cooker. I added in some kielbasa to make it more of a meal. Makes a ton of mac 'n cheese. I will probably try halving it next time.

I doubled the recipe, put it in my crockpot, then in a cooler, traveled ~ 3 hours, checked into our hotel, started cooking and went to the first hockey game of the weekend. We had a team potluck dinner after that game around 8pm. It was the first dish totally gone! A huge hit with the adults and kids alike. I had never made it before, so I was thankful it turned out so well. A definite addition to my recipe book. I used a combination of Monterey Jack, Colby and Sharp Cheddar cheese!

You know that dish that everyone asks for the recipe... This is one of those.. I doubled it for a party, my slow cooker barely contained it and I had some drippage but it was mouth watering fantastic. I did use course ground black pepper. They are still saying best macaroni and cheese ever. 
Update: use your favorite noodle, used penne and slightly under cooked it  it was best yet.

I was excited to make this recipe based on the reviews, however I was very disappointed. It did not taste well at all and it was a struggle for me to even eat it.

Made as is in a 4 qt slow cooker for our family Christmas. I greatly enjoyed the flavor, it wasn't difficult to make, and it cleaned up easier from the crock pot than a baked mac and cheese does from the oven. The only "critique" came from my husband who had hoped it would be a bit creamier than it turned out to be.

Tried this out for a big Christmas dinner. It was awesome and gone before I could take a picture of it cooked so I am including a precooked pic!  Would definitely recommend this!

This was amazing! Creamy, cheesy, comfort Mac and cheese! I made it just as the recipe called for but I also added some Parmesan cheese and bacon bits. This is something I will make more years to come.

This recipe was so easy, and my family loved it! I only cooked it about 2 hours and 40 minutes on low in the crock pot.

Turned out great! This is my go to mac and cheese for gatherings. It's easy because it stays in the crockpot and always gets rave reviews. Very decadent. I follow the recipe exactly,  sometimes add a little more shredded cheese, but it isn't necessary

It was a great recipe.  I made it for a group of teenagers and doubled the recipe and it still came out perfect.  Heard no complaints from any of them!

I tried this recipe today, It was really easy and good, I wanted it a little more cheesy so I added a half of a box of velveeta and because I wanted it to be the main course I added some cubed Ham! The whole family loved it and it was great to use the leftovers for lunch the next day!!
