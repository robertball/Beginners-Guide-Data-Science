This was not only my first time making fried green tomatoes, but also my first time eating them, so my first impression of the fried tomatoes themselves was that they needed some seasoning in the cornmeal.  That thought flew out the window when I tasted them with the (mayonnaise-free, THANK YOU!) remoulade!  Wow! What a great combination of flavors - this sauce is totally addicting, and perfectly suited for fried green tomatoes.  I cannot wait to have the opportunity to serve this to guests. It looks and tastes delicious, and was actually quite easy to prepare.  Thanks for sharing!

Anyone can fry great green tomatos, but the Remoulade sauce takes this dish to a whole new level.  This is really good, and do yourself a favor, follow the recipe, don't deviate or mess around.  When something works this good, don't fix it!

I live in New Orleans and took this recipe to Grand Isle with me this weekend.  I bought shrimp (right off the shrimp boat) and took fresh green tomatoes from my Mom's garden.  I made this to go with the boiled crabs we caught early in the morning.  Everyone raved over it!  And believe me, those Cajuns know good food!

This recipe is AMAZING! A green tomato is hard to find so I used half green tomatoes. I use light cream because I didn't have milk, regular mustard, and used corn muffin mix cause I didn't have cornmeal. The Remoulade is outstanding and I am not even a mustard fan! I ate this up, I only wish my camera was working cause it is sooo appetizing.  A must make.

I didn't have salad greens and I used regular milk over buttermilk (personal preference) and this turned out wonderful! This is one I will make time and time again. If you cannot find creole mustard, you can just use any type of mustard with a couple dashes of cayenne pepper hot pepper sauce. Excellent recipe!

I thought the amount of mustard overwhelmed the other remoulade ingredients but overall tasty and a nice topper for the fried green tomatoes. I will make again but reduce the amount of mustard.

I only used the remoulade from this recipe bc I found it after I was already making another fgt recipe.  I hadn't  ever had it before and I will now be  making this for any dish possible.  SO DELICIOUS!  I had to sub a few things I had on hand for items I didn't have, but it still turned out well.  Thanks!!!

This was outstanding! Everything about this recipe works and works well. The Remoulade is delicious on both the shrimp and the green tomatoes. If you want a dish that is sure to impress but not overly complicated to make, this is the one you need. Thanks for sharing! :o)

Dressing is too heavy and overpowering. It is all you can taste. Didnâ€™t care for the fried green tomatoes either. Disappointed considering the reviews...

I love the cuisine of N.O., but I can't say this is the "only" way to enjoy fried green tomatoes.  I also love them completely by themselves if made with a coating of cornmeal and flour (no batter); with a dollop of tomato gravy; or with a sour cream/mayo dressing.  I also prefer to use peanut oil as the smoke point is higher so that tomatoes can get crisp without absorbing as much fat.

Love this recipe.  The only change I made, because I didn't have Creole Mustard, was to use Dijon.  Can't wait until next summer when I have green tomatoes again!
