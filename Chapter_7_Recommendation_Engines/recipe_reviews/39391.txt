This recipe works fairly well. However, I would recommend cooking your tapioca pearls for longer... 30 minutes or more. After the said 20 minutes, just watch the pearls until they are cooked to your preference. Also, when storing your pearls, coat them with honey or sugar syrup so they do not stick together. If you want flavoured bubble tea, simply add frozen juice concentrate in the flavour of your choice. Keep adding it tsp at a time until it is flavourful enough. Chocolate syrup is also quite good.

The general problem of US bubble tea is the pearls do not have the chewness we have in Taiwan.  When I make it at home, I would cook the pearls then move the pearls into rice cooker and cook for another 15 minutes until the middle is completely cook.  The pearls aren't fully cook if it still shows a little white dot in the middle.  Once that's done.  Run cold water through it 3 times.  You'll have the most chewy pearls you'll ever taste.  Definitely leave them in honey or syrup so they don't stick together.

Definitely cook the tapioca at least 35-40 minutes. I run a bubble tea shop in Corpus Christi, TX 7314 SPID, and we use Choobees because you don't have to cook them...much easier! No cooking required!!

You cannot use American pearl tapioca for this recipe as it will fall apart and be nothing but a bunch of starch. You must use Pearl Tapioca that is made just for Bubble Tea. I recommend cooking the tapioca for 20 minutes and removing it from the heat source. Put a lid on the pot and allow to set for another 20 to 30 minutes. Rinse with warm water, it helps get the excess starch off much easier than cold water. I use Coconut Chai tea, Almond Milk and Stevia.

As others have suggested, I cooked the tapioca for about 30 minutes. The thing was, I should have stirred more, because a layer of tapioca pearls got stuck to the bottom of the pot, and could easily have burned and ruined the taste. So stir, people!!  Anyway, this works, it’s awesome for homemade bubble tea! I love the taste, I love the bubbles!  Oh, one more thing! I only used like 3-4 ice cubes. That’s enough to chill the beverage to my liking.

Good attempt at it.  Following the advice of the first review, these are my insights. - You will probably have to cook the tapioca longer than 20 minutes.  I cooked for about ~30 minutes.  Cook it until the tapioca is transparent.   - I used the smaller tapioca pearls and it just wasn't the same as the larger ones.  So I highly recommend using the larger ones.  But if you do decide to use the smaller ones, 1/3 cup felt like overkill for me.  1/4 cup seems like a better portion. - The drink didn't seem sweet enough following the original 4 teaspoons.  So you'll need to add maybe up to 6 teaspoons of white sugar, or you can add honey to add more sweetness.

I have tried this recipe several times. I found I had to cook my tapioca for much longer.  Cook it until the tapioca is clear.  Also after the ice is added the tea is a bit watered down.  I used less ice the second time to keep the tea a little stronger. The flavor was good but just not strong enough for my taste. I might try it again with chai tea. I am sure that would be very yummy.

I was pretty excited to try this recipe but my tapioca pearls fell apart when I put them in the water, so I ended up with a pot of thick goop! Not sure what I did wrong...possibly not stirring them constantly. I also read that you should use tapioca pearls that are specifically made for bubble tea. So pay special attention to this step in the directions! I'm going to try it again soon, I'm sure it's delicious

So, I tried this just out of interest, and was the at first really unimpressed.  I cooked the tapioca (I had dried pearls) for around 40 minutes, and they still had the white in them, which made them really too chewy in my opinion.  I will attempt to cook it longer next time.  I also took other reviewers' advice and coated the tapioca in honey before refrigeration. (Also cut down the sugar  a large amount).  So I tried it in black tea, and it was okay, but the tapioca was still too chewy and tasteless.  I had some tapioca left over, which I stuck in the fridge overnight.  I took it out the next evening, and tried it and WOW!  It had gotten sweeter and more tender overnight.  I had it in Rasberry tea (don't put the milk in Rasberry, mine curdled the first time, yuck), and it was delicious. For those of you with tougher "bubbles,"  try leaving them in honey in the fridge overnight-- not sure it's a real technique, but it worked for me.

I buy my pearls at an oriental market in the bubble tea aisle, and cook them what the instructions say. They are black, large, and puff up in about 10 minutes, as the package says. This recipe is pretty good. I add fruit to it, and put it in the Vita mix, then pour it over the pearls.

I have to agree with the previous reviewer, darthotto. The "bubbles" are just plain weird. They're like little tasteless rubber balls -- kinda like unflavored gummy bears. After about 2 of 'em, I felt like I was eating something that really wasn't meant to be eaten. If the bubbles were flavored, this would be quite enjoyable. As for the tea recipe, it's just plain tea with cream -- neither fantastic nor bad.

If you're into it, which apparently, thousands of people are, you will want to simmer them for 30 minutes, as others have said. Also, my guess is that you could put them into any kind of of tea that you like.  Enjoy?

I absolutely LOVE bubble tea, and I have been looking for the tapioca pearls, but couldn't find any. I still wanted to make some at home that tasted like what you get at stores, so I tried this recipe but without the tapioca. It seriously tasted just like something you could get at a store, only about 1/4 of the cost. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Loved it!  Can't get it around here and wanted to try it.  Totally addicted to the feeling of the "bubbles"!!  I had no trouble finding tapioca.  It was in the baking section of my small-town grocery near the pudding.  I used Splenda instead of the sugar and I also used Chai.  I kept my left over bubbles and hope to use them again tomorrow.  Thanks for the recipe...

This was great, but I did change the recipe a bit.  I bought Bolle premium tapioca pearl from the Asian market and cooked them according to package directions (pretty much boil gently 20 minutes...stirring every few minutes, then turning off stove and let sit with the lid on for 25 minutes more.  Then rinse several times with cool water and add honey or sugar to prevent sticking).  Also, I added a couple tablespoons of flavored tea powder also from the Asian market (I used honeydew).  The tea I brewed was a peach green tea.  The rest of the directions were straight from the recipe, and the tea was great.

getting the 100 cups of tapioca was difficult, what to brew 300 cups of tea in was quite a challenge, and the 300 cups of ice cubes took months to make.

Not bad for my first try! Initially I made this with bottled tea and added some honey, but the flavor was waaay off. I decided to rinse off the tapioca and try again with real brewed tea, and was much better. Now I just need to find a straw big enough for my tapioca beads!

Great recipe. As many said before, cook the pearls for about 30 or more minutes. Everything was perfect except for when I added some stuff. When I coated the tapioca balls with honey too make sure they don't stick together, I put too much so it ended up with a strange taste. Also, adding chocolate can come in mixed results. It really depends, I personally liked it with a bit of chocolate powder. Great recipe, watch what you add in though.

I altered the recipe a bit, but kept some of the original measurements. Also, don't forget to stir the tapioca pearls!

I used 2 1/2 cups of black tea, 9 tsps of milk, 5 teaspoons of milk and 5 ice cubes. Also, I chilled the tapioca pearls in the fridge in a bit of cold water so they didn't clump as much. The tea was cooled for awhile before the milk & sugar were added as well. 

It came out absolutely amazing and made two large glasses of bubble tea.
