There is a lot going on here and these are a lot of work but worth it in the end. All of the flavors come together nicely and also has nice presentation. The bean/truffle oil was my favorite part. I'd say these are more than just appetizers though and are more of a side dish. Great recipe and one sure to impress your guests.

As an avowed carnivore, I don't cook pure veggie meals very often, but I made this for a pot luck at work, so our lone vegetarian would have something he could actually eat.  At first glance, it seems like a lot of work, but it was actually rather easy to execute.  Someone else complained about ti being a bit runny....just remember to drain the beans before putting them in the food processor ;)  I didn't add any extra water to the beans, just what was packed in the cans with them, ( so that probably helped) and just added a bit of that in to keep the mash from coming out too dry.  They came out looking, and smelling delicious, and were a big hit.  Probably should have made more, judging by they way they disappeared.

The flavors in this were great, but there were serious problems with the execution - the whole thing was too watery/runny. I would skip the part with boiling the beans and process them without any water. I also recommend letting the mushrooms dry on paper towels after cooking them.

The bean sauce and topping would also be very good on other sandwiches (hamburgers, chicken sandwich, etc.).

I made exactly to the recipe ,  just used liquid in the beans as needed (didn't need much). My whole family LOVED them, I should have doubled. 
I think they are perfect as a side dish or appetizer. I'm thinking of trying these out with a bunch of small button mushrooms as an appetizer/side for Thanksgiving.

This recipe is awesome!!!  It has a flavor that is amazingly similar to a steak but with a different texture.  This is an excellent recipe choice for someone on a restricted diet or trying to cut back on red meat.

Since it was 15 degrees outside I skipped grilling the caps and broiled them in the oven.  Loved the whole recipe and the flavors!  I didn't add too much water to the beans - about a 1/4 cup and let it almost evaporate and the bean puree was just right!
