I found and tried this recipe today.  I made it exactly according to the directions.  I served it with saffroned rice and mixed veggies and made a sauce by thickening the milk mixture.  The flavor was delicious and the fish was juicy, flaky and flavorful.  And, so easy!  Thanks

I used whiting for this (especially because it's the cheapest of the frozen fish at my store), but think it may taste better with tilapia or even cod. The whiting was a bit fishy tasting and the combo of fishy + milky didn't appeal to us. I followed the recipe, but may try making a thicker sauce next time by adding flour and butter to the milk before pouring it over the fish. The milk remained very runny and seemed wasted in the bottom of the pan. I would probably also use fresh minced garlic next time because we love the taste of garlic. I think this has potential but didn't work great for me this go around.

This actually came out really good(minus the tomatoes), I was skeptical I must admit. I couldn't take a picture because it was gone as soon as it came out of the oven.  Definite repeat dish.

I was a little nervous making this based on some of the negative reviews but I decided to take the chance and wow did it pay off!! I diced up tomato and onion, fresh minced garlic, used salt and pepper, lemon juice and fresh cilantro. I added the milk per the directions and the fish was delicious and juicy!! Both of my kids loved it, this will definitely be a quick and yummy dinner we will make again!

I'm kind of new to cooking fish. This was very good and tasty and did not smell at all "fishy".

Great flavor and texture plus it looks great on the plate. Didn't require a stocked pantry to put together.  I was out of onion powder so I added sliced onion with the tomatoes.

This recipe is a breeze to make! Very delicious, and  I served it with Rice Pilaf and sauteed zucchini  all in under 45 minutes from start to finish.

I bought a family sized bag of whiting and then discovered I don't really care for it! This recipe makes it edible, it's easy and I'll make it again while I use up this bag! :)

This fish was delicious! My picky son even gave it a try and he loved it! This is a recipe that we will be making again.  However we skipped the tomatoes.
Thanks for sharing

EASY! Mine looked exactly like the picture!  No Leftovers!  I bought on sale whiting with heads/tails removed.  Went to Youtube to see how to remove bones from thawed fish.  Simple (keep a tub of cold water to put fillets in after boning).  I served with black rice and spooned the milk sauce over fish and rice.  My guys in the family loved it.

I used sour cream instead of milk on the bottom, which avoided the watery finish. Also I used chopped onion and skipped the garlic ( personal taste). It cooked from frozen in about 40 minutes. Yumm! I like this recipe as it seems to be adaptable to a wide variety of spices. The whiting is a blank canvas inviting addition of flavors.

Followed the directions — didn’t have lemon & onion powder,  so used lemon juice & cut up an onion.  I added Parmesan cheese to the milk.    Also used gourmet tomatoes.

Didn’t have fresh lemon so I used lemon juice. Also used about 1/4 teaspoon of salt. I added a pinch of cilantro and a pinch of Parmesan cheese to the milk. Was skeptical about the tomatoes but I added them and yum! I made 3 servings  and boyfriend ate 2 of them! Very good!

No fuss, no mess to make. Easy clean up. Hubby liked it. Will make again.  The melted butter mixed with fish juice in milk is delicious over boiled potato and carrots.

This was very delicious. I might've diced my roma tomatoes into smaller pieces than it looked on the photograph. I paired it with polenta and steamed cut broccoli for a hearty meal. Next time, I might do two fillets than one.

This was just so darn quick and easy. Husband loved this, and it's a struggle to get fish that isn't fried catfish into him. He will always have 2 pieces of fish prepared this way. This is so quick and easy. I have made this with whiting and swai. Fish nights usually have him rolling his eyes a bit, and I loved it when he's surprised. Thank you.

Last time I made Pacific whiting, I just grilled it... And if you don't like very fishy-tasting fish, I don't recommend it.  Baking it this way made it so much better, softer, cleaner-tasting.  The tomatoes were a nice little stroke of genius, too.  Even the texture on the ends of the fish was still tender instead of vaguely chewy when I grilled it.  My new go-to for baking white fish.
