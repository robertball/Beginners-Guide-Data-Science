The proportions seem to be off in this recipe. There's only 1 1/4 c flour but you use an entire bag of chips. When we bite into these all we can taste are the chips, no "cookie". The recipe for Hershey's CLASSIC Special Dark Choc Chip Cookies on the bag is entirely different from this one. I love dark chocolate and had high hopes for this recipe. Next time I'll either double the dough part of this recipe or try the recipe on the bag.

I agree with another reviewer, there isn't much "cookie" to this recipe.  Chewy, but I would like more cookie part and less chips.

It's good, but not spectacular. Best when they are still warm, but once cooled down, mmmm just average.
