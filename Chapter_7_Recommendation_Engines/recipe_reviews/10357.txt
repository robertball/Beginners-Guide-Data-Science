instead of rolling them flat, to save time I rolled them into small balls.  They came out wonderfully and easy to decorate with a frosting or in my case I used almond bark chocolate which I already had at the house they tasted great!

I thought these cookies where great and they stayed fresh for at least three days now in a zip lock bag.     We used a cookie press and refrigerated the dough overnight before we baked worked out great this recipe is going down in my top favorites Thanks Again

These tasted great, but the dough was really sticky.  It took a lot of flour to make this dough work!  It certainly didn't work in the cookie press, so I ended up rolling it out flat and using cookie cutters.

I made these cookies, and cooked them about 25 degrees below the recommended temperature. I also doubled the vanilla. The first batch I didn't freeze and did as drop cookies. The second batch I froze and cut. The first fluffed up a bit more than I wanted them to, but the second came out perfectly. I liked the cookies, and my siblings thought they were grand, but they had an odd taste of corn to them... Not sure why.

These turned out well.  They didn't stay very soft after a day or two, but were still good.

While easy, this dough was far too soft for rolling & cutting out with a cutter.  Would be far better off rolled into balls & pressed down with a fork similar to peanut butter cookies.  Won't be making this again.
