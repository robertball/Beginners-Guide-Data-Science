Made with zucchini instead of eggplant, half pork with the lamb, and lentil based pasta. Also cut out all the baking by straining or cooking off the juice. So Im not sure how similar it is to the original but still tastes like pastitsio and was amazing!

My favorite pastitsio recipe. Others' bechamel layers are too thick and starchy-tasting. This is so good.

I make a Vegetarian version by omitting the lamb and adding 2-3 roasted zucchini.
I also use the entire 16 oz of ziti because l omit the meat.
ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS
