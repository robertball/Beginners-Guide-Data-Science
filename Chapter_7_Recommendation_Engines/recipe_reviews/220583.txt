Looking for a new side dish to serve with a pork roast based on what was in the fridge.  Used fresh squeezed lemon and orange juice as I didn't have concentrate available and glad I didn't as I believe it kept the flavors more simplistic. This recipe was a refreshing change from other root vegetables!  Sweet, savory, and very pleasing to the eye. Great complement and one that will make it's way to our table from time to time....  Thanks Taddo1965!

This worked really well.  I always modify recipes to match what I have in the house and our preferences, so with this I used only 2 tablespoons butter, an orange instead of orange juice, lots of stock (2 or 3 cups), balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice and no chives.  It was great, sweet and savory.  Very sweet considering the sugar is all natural sugars in the veggies, orange and vinegar.  They taste almost candied.  They also look like they will keep well in the fridge so we can microwave them as a side for later meals.

Hubby just loved this recipe.  Have to admit though that I did not add the citrus juices.  I just cannot handle fruit and savory stuff together.  Just a personal preference.  Thanks so much for posting the recipe.

Delicious! I made exact ingredients (except subbing freeze dried chives for fresh), but had to remove lid and increase temp to reduce sauce to a glaze. No matter, the end result was great. BF agreed even though he isn't a big carrot fan.

I used 3 carrots and 3 parsnips (that's what I had on hand) and reduced the amount of butter to 1 large pat.  I cut the vegetables according to the recipe.  Melted the butter and added the vegetables.  I covered the pan and braised on a low flame, stirring every so often till they were starting to brown and were cooked through.  Then I sprinkled them with some granulated chicken broth and a splash of orange juice plus salt and pepper.  When it became syrupy, I seasoned with salt and pepper to taste.  Sprinkled with dehydrated chives and allowed them to moisten before serving.  Forgot the lemon juice but didn't miss it.  This is a great way to cook carrots and parsnips, and while I may not have followed the recipe exactly, it gave me a nice recipe to play off of.   We really liked it and will make it again.

You have to like parsnips to love this dish. The second time I tried it it turned out better because I used a ceramic frying pan and it browned nicely in the butter and then the orange juice mixture simmered away to a nice glaze. Very good

I did not make changes and we loved it with our turkey dinner. Such a great taste of citrus it will definitely be part of our traditional meals.

I cut the pieces a little smaller because my family prefers it that way.  Other than that I have really come to live this dish just the way it is.

Big hit with the Christmas crowd. Just prior to serving broiled carrots and parsnips for a few mins to add extra crisp. Lots of compliments, even from the guys!

The liquid never thickened into the syrup.   I poured off the liquid and thickened with cornstarch.  Tasted fine.  Would not make again.
