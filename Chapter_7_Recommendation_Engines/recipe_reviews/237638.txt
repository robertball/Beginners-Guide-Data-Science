Refreshing light dish that is surely made best by the toasted coconut.  If you don't like coconut then I would skip this dish entirely, unless you like strong fishy taste.  When I first took this dish off the stove and took a taste the fish sauce overpowered everything.  Wasn't sure how this dish was going to turn out. Being so far into preparing this dish I went ahead and added the toasted coconut, cilantro, and lime juice and let refrigerate I ever night.  Wow what a difference a tasty light meal.  I followed the directions entirely as chief printed them.

Calamari didn't take on enough flavor. Very easy to overcook!

Quick to do and a refreshing way to start your meal. Goes great with a glass of wine. I just love how the flavor explodes in your mouth. You must try this!

This was my first attempt at making calamari at home and this recipe gave me the confidence to give it a try.  That said we thought this salad (which we served over shredded greens) was just not as flavorful as we thought it would be.  I would have liked the juice to be thicker to coat the calamari better, but it made a nice dressing for the greens.
