I use this recipe all the time but I make it with 3 teaspoons of good quality vanilla and then there is no wait time! Instant gift!

I use this recipe quite a bit but the water is cut down to 3 cups (adds to the thickness of the finished product).  I also use 3 teaspoons of good quality pure vanilla instead of the vanilla bean.  I save small dark glass bottles (sterilized) and give as gifts.

I shouldn't review this until after it has aged. It was perfect first made so I know with time it will only get better. I followed the recipe except I used 4 cups of very strong coffee instead of water and instant coffee. I had some coffee from a loved one's trip to Africa that I used. It was ground a little more finely than domestic ground coffee. I could use the liqueur today but I'll give it a couple of months to let the vanilla bean infuse. Thanks for sharing a yummy recipe.
