The pancakes for this are perfect. I was even able to use frozen shredded potatoes so I wouldn't have to grate my own (I used 1 cup per potato called for). Mine browned perfectly in 3-4 minutes per side on medium heat. I did add a little extra hot sauce to the batter. I was underwhelmed with the tomato sauce for this. I's a little time consuming to reduce the water out of it and then you're left with a relatively bland conconction. You could tweak aroud with it and get it more interesting and flavorful, or you can skip it altgether and use your favorite salsa. I was tempted to give this recipe a 3 because of it, but I decided that the potatoes were worth a good rating. I'll make them again, thanks!

These friend up great and the directions were easy enough to follow.  I did squeeze out as much of the liquid as I could after shredding the potatoes.  Also this did not have enough heat for me next time I'll just remove the seeds, and leave the ribs in.  Quick tip, be sure to keep plenty oil in the bottom of your pan or your cakes will not brown evenly.

I prepared these to add to our tradtional latkes for Hannukkah this year as we were fixing other Mexican foods for dinner this year. I kicked them up a notch by adding chayenne pepper to make them spicier. They turned out exceptionally crispy with just the right mount of heat. My family asked me to fix them again for next year. They can be fixed ahead and frozen.

These were very yummy! I just served mine with salsa instead of making the tomato puree..it seemed like a lot of work for basically the same result. I also served with sour cream on top. The diced jalapeno gave it a nice kick. Very tasty!

Made sauce in blender - one can of diced tomatoes with chilis, one onion (quartered), couple spoonfuls of jalapenos (jarred), added to saucepan with oil.  Left skin on potatoes, used food processor with the shredding blade, added couple of spoonfuls of jalapenos (jarred) too.  Used eggbeaters, and chinese hot sauce (about a tablespoon).  The sauce was amazing.. I would put this on everything!  Not the healthiest but really tasty way to use up some of my potatoes!

So good!  A great twist on comfort food, and a great option as a side for mexican dishes.  Used canned diced tomatoes and followed the recipe as written.  I love it when a recipe exceeds my expectations as this did!  I think next time I'll make pizzas or open face sandwiches with the pancakes by topping with taco meat, cheese, and other taco stuff.

I agree with others regarding the salsa being bland, I would rather use one of my mother's authentic salsa recipes for these potato pancakes otherwise the pancakes came out delicious. (Self note: add more salt next time)

Bland and kind of boring, made sure to top with salsa and cheese, but didn't eat the leftovers. Won't make again, sorry.

The potato pancakes themselves were absolutely delicious.  It was my first time making potato pancakes and they turned out wonderful.  I wouldn't change a thing.  The tomato sauce is a good base, but needs much more seasoning.  I did add some cilantro, garlic, jalapeno and a dash of hot sauce, but it still needed more.  Next time, I will probably reduce the oil and add some more spices...but there will definitely be a next time!

These are easy to tailor to kids and adults. I make half plain and have spicy.

Good take on potato pancakes.  Somehow, these don't seem as greasy as potato pancakes usually are.

This is a great recipe. I did add a bit more hot sauce because my family and I love spicy food. The second time I made this I used frozen shredded potatoes and I have to say that although it was easier they just weren't as good. I definitely recomend putting in the extra time and useing freshly grated potatoes.

These were very simple to make and were a great side to a Mexican meal. I used frozen, thawed shredded hash browns and topped them with sour cream and salsa.
