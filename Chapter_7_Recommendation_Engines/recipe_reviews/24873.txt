I made this recipe because I started a new WW diet and figured it was relatively low in "points" (2 per serving) and sounded delish.  While the dressing came out quite well I think next time I'd cut down the cumin to 1/2 tsp (it's VERY strong), and up the cilantro.  I think I must have quadrupled or even sextupled the amount of cilantro in the recipe the second time I made it and it came out much better.  All in all people enjoyed it.

This is WONDERFUL! I have been looking for this a very long time. I use to get this dressing in those little bagged salad kits, but they don't sell it on the shelf.  This is really great to dip veggies in or chips. I added in a few drops of hot sauce, because I like it hot. Doesn't need it, wonderful alone as well. Thank you so much for posting this recipe. I LOVE IT!

Thought that this was very good.  I did reduce the amount of cilantro...per the advice of some of the other reviewers.  I don't think it was too close to the restaurant's version, but will work when we want to eat this at home.  Thanks for the post.

I make this dressing any time we have taco salads.  The only change I make is to reduce the salt to about 1/4 teaspoon.  I love the cumin, lime, and cilantro combination!

I used buttermilk and also added a couple teaspoons of taco seasoning mix.  Nice flavor.

Pretty good. I made this to toss on a simple side dish of sliced avocado and fresh roasted green chiles, and the only thing I'm going to do differently next time is to cut the salt in half. With the mayo and lime, it was just too much, and I like stuff salty. But great flavor, especially for the simplicity. I love cumin and cilantro. Thanks for the recipe!

I used this dressing on a green salad containing black beans, sweet corn kernals, diced tomatoes, red onion and tortilla chip strips.  Everyone loved it!

Just the thing I was looking for to dress my taco salad.  Something creamy, but mexican-tasting.  I had to do a little adjusting and tasting to get it just right.. and I added one major thing:  Chili Powder.  It tasted too much like mayo until I added this.  I'm sure taco seasoning would do the same.  I also added a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes-- definitely added some spice!  I will definitely make this again.. next time maybe with sour cream instead of mayo.

As always, I read the reviews before trying the recipe.  I started out with 1/2 tsp of cumin and ended up with about 2 1/2 TBLS.  This is delicious!  Hubby loved it after I added some ranch dressing (from the pack, not that gross bottled kind!).  My 6 yr old thought it was just ok.  However, will make again for hubby and myself!

This was OK, but not one of my favorite dressings.  I didn't think it especially enhanced a salad served with a mexican meal.  I'll keep looking.

Yummy!  I halved the recipe so that it wouldn't go to waste with only 2 people eating it.  Should have doubled the recipe instead.  This was fabulous!

Excellent.  So tasty.  This is especially good on taco salad.  I found the cumin taste too strong, so cut back to about half of the recommended amount.

Very yummy and refreshing! I did cheat and spice it up a little with a dash of "Mexican seasoning mix" that they have here in Germany (it contains peppers, salt, chilies, sugar, garlic, curry, mustard sees, cumin, and "other herbs", whatever those migh be). It was a little too bland without it for me, but I like spicy.

I was disappointed with my attempt to make this dressing. I used half the cumin suggested and it was still much too strong and overpowered my salad.  It was also much saltier than I expected.  However, I did love the fresh cilantro.  It was edible, but I won't be making it again.

I whipped this up in 5 minutes! Very tasty. Next time I'll toast 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds, crush slightly then add to other ingredients. That might give this recipe an even stronger cumin flavor. The fresh cilantro is really a key ingredient. Thanks!

Very nice change from a creamy dill, mild "taco" flavor -. I used only 1/2 tablespoon of the cumin and it was plenty flavorful. Also used only half the cilantro and zipped it in with the dressing with food processor. We topped this dressing on a dark green salad with kidney beans, tomato, avocado,green onions  and sprinkled cheddar cheese on top. Kids gobbled it up and asked for more.

I made it this afternoon, that way it could chill for our dinner tonight. I just tasted it after having been in the fridge for a bit. Not to say that this is a bad recipe ~ it's just that my taste buds didn't like it ~ Not one bit. :o(

I didn't have a lot of luck with this recipe.  There was something about the interaction of the salt and lime that seemed off.  I made it as listed, but then it seemed too salty or something, so I upped the mayonnaise, lime, and milk, but it still wasn't all that good.  I won't be making it again.

Outstanding dressing!  I used parsley instead of cilantro (didn't have the good stuff!) and like another reviewer, I added taco seasoning.  I also used leftover corn and black beans from a different recipe.  Thanks!

I thought this dressing was great.  However, it has a very unique flavor that not all people probably like.  I made it for some friends and they all loved it.  The only thing I would change would be to add a little less pepper and cumin.

I make a lot of dressings and this one just didn't cut it.  If I make it again, it's going to need some major tinkering.

Instead of mayonnaise, I used fat-free sour cream and I used fat free milk. I also only used a pinch of salt, as I'm watching my salt intake as well as my calorie intake. This was very good, though I did add more chopped cilantro after giving it a taste, as well as a clove of minced garlic. Next time, I'll add chopped jalapeno peppers as it seemed to be missing a little heat. It was even better the next day, so I say make it the day before you need it and serve it the next day. GREAT on breakfast burritos and any sort of mexican dish you make at home.

This was pretty tasty, but I have to admit that I ended up changing it a bit. I made it first as written, but it seemed really salty. It was okay, but the second time I tried using sour cream instead of mayo. This time it seemed like something was missing. Next time I will make it with mayo, but no salt. Otherwise it was really good and was also good with tortilla chips.

I really loved this and it is so simple.  I used light miracle whip and some 2% evaporated milk with some water (out of milk :).  Did not really measure the milk, just added enough to get the consistency I wanted.  I added a dash of cayenne pepper with the remaining ingredients cuz I wanted a little kick.  Served it over a simple salad of spinach, romaine, cherry tomatoes, and cucumber and it was the perfect completement to my black bean enchilada casserole.  Even better the next day.  I will make this often!  Thanks!

I loved this dressing!  Got tons of compliments.  The only thing that I did different was double the lime juice and added a little more cilantro.  It was perfect for a taco salad.

This dressing is the BEST it can get. You really should make it a day ahead to let the flavors meld together. Great on salads, with chips or even as a sandwich topper! My wifes loves it that way! Dip hot pepperoni rolls in it. Awesome!

Perfect for fajita salad.  My son cannot have dairy so I used a little almond milk instead.  I was happy to find a dressing that didn't have sugar in it!

Good, I added more cilantro, cumin and some cayenne pepper. I used the tube of chopped cilantro they sell at the store instead of fresh.

I have made this dressing to go with a fajita salad, and it was delicious and the perfect compliment to the salad.  Tonight I'm going to make it again to dip our Southwestern Egg Rolls (also from this site) in.  If you like cumin and cilantro (which I DO), you'll love this dressing!  I love that it doesn't require too many ingredients and they are things I almost always have on hand.

Great dressing with a refreshing southwest taste. I also made this for a party as a dip by omitting the milk and adding 1/3 cup of sour cream and some lime zest. Served w/ tortillas and taquitos.

I omitted the milk, cut back to 1 teaspoon of cumin, added a little garlic and will be using this as a spread on grilled chicken sandwhiches.  I am sure with the milk it makes a great Mexican dressing.

It was great to find this recipe!  We love salads with almost every meal and I'd just whip some sour cream, taco seasoning and salsa when I made Mexican.  This is a real keeper - it tastes good with nacho chips, too!  Thanks for sharing.

I was really excited to try this dressing and usually I really enjoy high rated recipes but this one seemed really flat to me. Like a slightly flavored mayo. I'll keep looking.

Yum, this was soooo good!  Reduce the cumin to 3/4 teaspoon.  I had pico de gallo handy (diced tomatoes, onions, lime juice, green onions, jalapeno, cilantro) and I tossed that in instead of adding the normal tomatoes and onions and it really brought the salad to the next level.

This was exactly what I was looking for. I grilled Chx with Lawry's Baja Chipotle marinade, put the chx on a basic salad and used this dressing. My husband raved...I will definitely use this again and try it with a chicken wrap. Yummmm.

I've used this recipe since I found allrecipes years ago.  I love it!  I always use light sour cream or mayo and it makes a really good light dressing.  I also just throw everything in the blender and I use about twice the cilantro.

This recipe has GREAT potential!  I used only 1/2 t. salt and 2 t. cumin, and also added 1/2 t. garlic.  I had to make the dressing twice in one day as my family gobbled up the first batch!

I thought this was simply delicious!  So refreshing, tasty, and unusual.  I only used about 1/4 tsp salt since mayo is salty enough; and I used the juice of half a lime.  The flavors blended perfectly!  It was scrumptious as a dip for bread and also as a dressing for pasta.  My family loved it.

After making this several times and loving it, I swapped Greek yogurt in place of mayonnaise to make it a little healthier. My boyfriend couldn't tell the difference. It's a great addition to taco salad!

Holy salt lick! Was this ever salty!!!!! I have to disagree with other reviewers' comments claiming this tastes like a Mexican restaurant's house dressing or those little dressing packets sold with Southwestern salad kits. It doesn't. Not one bit. And the salt wasn't the only issue I had with this.... The cumin is overpowering and the cilantro taste is pretty much nonexistent unless you triple or quadruple it. All said and done, this was a total miss for me. My search for a dressing to complement Mexican meals must continue because this certainly isn't it. Thanks anyways, Denise.

I thought this recipe was lacking some oomph.  I added some chili powder, coriander and jalapenos which gave it a nice flavor. I also did 1/3 cup low-fat mayo and 1/3 cup non-fat plain yogurt.

I've made this several times when I make Tex-Mex.  It's great for something other than ranch.  I use a light mayo and little more milk than the recipe calls for so it's a little more runny than thick.  My husband really enjoys it.

I used buttermilk in place of milk, added a little onion powder, slightly more black pepper and I also added homemade salsa that had cilantro in it. The taste was just what I was expecting. Worked great over spinach leaves.

I am giving it 4 stars because of the changes I made. I thought it needed more flavor so I added more cumin, some taco seasoning, 1/4 chopped fresh jalepeno and cayanne pepper. I also used buttermilk in replacement of the milk and juiced a whole small lime.

Absolutely perfect for a taco salad night.  Just what I was looking for.  I made it as a chicken southwest salad.  Yummy!

I browned 1# burger and added the envelope of taco seasoning to it, let it cool.  Chopped lettuce and tomatoes, onion and added some corn, then the seasoned burger and this dressing.  Better than what is ordered at a restauraunt!

Very nice! We discovered we were out of sour cream to put on the tacos we made, so I tried this recipe. It worked very nicely! It was a tad bit mayonnaise-y but I guess that's to be expected with a mayo based dressing! Thanks for a quick taco fixer upper!

Well...I had high hopes for this because we LOVE cumin and cilantro. But it just tasted like mayo. I added extra cilantro and cumin, but still tasted only mayo. I did read the directions wrong and mixed the cilantro with everything else not right before serving (I put it in the blender). I don't think thats what did it though. I tried adding onion and other spices to make it better...nothing made it stray from the mayo flavor. I still ate it because I didn't want to waste all of it, but threw the rest out afterwards. Boyfriend wasn't thrilled either. He dumped bleu cheese on top so there was some taste. Sorry.

It was mayonnaise with cumin flavoring.  I added some Lawry's Baja Marinade to it and some more lime juice.  After it "marinated" a bit it began to taste better, but I guarantee it wasn't because of the cumin-flavored mayo.  No, thanks.

too much salt!  I like my food salty and this was too much for me.  I actually had to throw it out.  Three stars is me being generous, because I realize that maybe I don't like this dressing all that much in mexican restaurant either.  But if you do, add salt gradually and to taste.

This was ok on a salad, I liked it more than my husband.  But we BOTH loved it the next day as a substitute for sour cream on a simple layered taco salad.  I heated black beans with some taco seasoning and topped with a blend of shredded cheese. When I took it from the oven I topped it with shredded lettuce/chopped tomoatoes/and chopped sweet onion.  I poured some of the Casa Dressing over all and served with tortilla chips.  It was GREAT.

I followed the recipe as directed and loved it.  It's a new favorite!  We like Miracle Whip instead of mayo, and that's what I used- tasted great!

Sorry, but I didn not care for this at all/ I reduced the cumin to 1 tsp. and still thought it was too overpowering. Wasn't a fan of the combo of flavors either.

I made this dressing to top off a taco salad that we took to a fiesta dinner party.  Everybody really liked it. Next time around I will add a little extra cilantro, and I'll be sure to double the recipe.  Thanks!
