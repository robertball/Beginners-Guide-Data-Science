The first time I made these, I followed the directions exactly and the zucchini chips weren't terrible, but seemed to be lacking something. The next time, I doubled the parmesan and added garlic powder and basil. I also experimented with the thickness of the slices, finding that thinner was crispier. I'm glad I gave these a second shot becasue they turned out much better

I truely can't rave enough about how delicious, easy, and healthy these were!!!  I was a little concerned that this was going to be labor intensive but it only took about 10 minutes to prepare. I just sliced the zucchini in rounds, and then I dunked them in Egg Beaters to save on calories and for the convenience, and then dunked them in the bread crumb mixture.  I used seasoned bread crumbs and added extra garlic powder since my family are garlic lovers.  And just popped them on a cookie sheet sprayed with a little Pam!  After 7 minutes in the oven, I flipped them around with a spatula.  Just as a side note, you don't have to be careful flipping them around, they stay together pretty well.  Then put them back in the oven for another 10 minutes.  I served them with both marinara and ranch dressing on the side.  I made 2 full cookie sheets worth of these and they were scarfed down SO quickly!!  I had men that are not at all health concsious raving about them and their wives begging for the recipe.  I am really making an effort to lose weight, I'm down 20 pounds, and recipes like this that are delicious and not obviously "health food", make entertaining and hosting really fun for me again.  These really do need to be served right out of the oven, I think you could prep them ahead of time to the point of the cookie sheet and then pop them in the oven when company came over.  Thank you for the excellent recipe!!

Thanks to the reviews of others, this recipe was a hit in our house.  I added garlic and onion powder, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes and parm. cheese to the dry ingred.  I added LA Gold (hot sauce) to the egg mixture.  Before cooking, I did spray the zucchini chips with cooking spray - and again when I tuned them over.  I upped the oven temp. to 500 degrees after flipping the chips - and cooked them for an additional 6 minutes total on second side.  They did get brown, crispy and delicious.  With these additions, the recipe is wonderful - even for those who aren't zucchini lovers.

These were great. Quick, easy and low calorie. I also add garlic powder to breadcrumbs.  To make them crispy spray tops with cooking spray before putting in the oven. After you turn them over spray the tops again. They will be crispy on both sides.

I'd actually rate this a 4.5:  4 from me, 5 from my husband.  My husband LOVES these.  These are the only food I've ever prepared (and I try tons of new recipes) that he has ever specifically asked me to make again.  I doctored the seasonings (added garlic salt, cayenne pepper, italian seasoning, while using seasoned breadcrumbs) and i actually didn't care for them.  They are in the oven now (after many many pleas) made according to the recipe, so maybe I'll like them more this time. I did use the suggestion to spray w/Pam before cooking and after flipping and they did turn out pretty crsipy for oven-baked.  Thanks for my husbands new favorite recipe!  EDIT:  I now LOVE these and make them all the time w/no extra seasonings.  I use panko and/or seasoned bread crumbs, depending on what i have on hand and I never measure anymore, just dump and go.  I also don't flip (I'm lazy ;) ) mid baking and they're still nice and crisp.  Solid 5 at the LTH house and a staple side for grilled burgers.

Used a whole egg to coat. Added freshly grated parm cheese to bread crumbs as well as a little salt, onion powder, and garlic powder. I after dipping the zucc's...I dipped and breaded again. Set in the fridge for an hour to set the breading and then baked (on a pizza stone). A very good alternative to fries. Good flavor if you want to kick up those diet taste buds!

Love fried zucchini, but hate the mess. Plus I always eat too much and regret it later. This is a great alternative. Easy, no mess and much healthier. No queasy tummy later either.

Used Japanese bread crumbs(Panko) and added seasoning salt. I cooked with a convection oven to get them a little more crispy.

i added garlic salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and used seasoned breadcrumbs (garlic and herb).  i also drizzled the pan with a little melted butter since i was out of cooking spray (oops).  i was disappointed that they weren't browned after 10 minutes, but then i remembered to flip them.  a few minutes later they were done.  still not as crispy as fried zucchini, but they tasted awesome and everyone had seconds.  i suggest double breading next time to make them more crispy (egg, breadcrumbs, egg, more breadcrumbs).  also...to coat everything faster i dump 5-6 zucchini in the bowl of egg whites, stir them vigorously to coat, then throw them one by one into the bowl of breadcrumbs and spices.  i just shake the bowl until they're all covered.  that way you don't have to do them one by one.  
using extra parmesan cheese helps with the crispiness factor too (will try next time).

I just made this recipe the other night.  I was so good. I did add basil and garlic salt to the bread crumbs.  I also cooked them on a pizza stone, which made them crispy.  Great recipe!

FANTASTIC!!!!.  I used all the original ingredients except used whole eggs instead of just egg whites.  I did change the way I prepared them for baking though.  I like things as easy as possible with little or no clean up so if I can make a recipe and get the same results with less work I go for it. First I should tell you I purchase rolls of heavy duty produce bags at my local grocery store for $15.  A roll lasts more than a year with daily misc use. Ok..here's how I made this recipe.  I broke 2 eggs into a produce bag and squeezed them around with my hands until "scrambled".  I cut the zucchini and dumped the chips into the bag with the egg.  Blew a little air into bag, twisted, and shook up to coat.  In a second bag  I added Italian seasoned bread crumbs, pepper, and Parmesan cheese.  Next, over the sink drain, cut a small slit in bottom corner of 1st bag containing zucchini and let egg drain out.  Now dump zucchini in breading bag, blow a little air in it, twist, and shake well.  I lined the baking pan with parchment paper instead of oiling.  Laid zucchini chips on parchment paper, put in preheated 475 degree oven, and baked as directed.  When I was done just threw the bags and parchment paper away and clean up was done.  Quick, easy, and delicious.  Oh I sprinked the chips with Johnny's Seasoning after I took them out of the oven and served with Ranch dressing.  Thank you for a WONDERFUL recipe!!!!!!!

I made exactly as written and am sorry to say I was disappointed. I really wanted to like these since so many from the exchange have recommended this recipe. I guess it boils down to the fact that when I think of the word "chip" I think of something that would have a bit of a crisp or crunch. That was not the case with this recipe. I think I'll just stick to roasting my zucchini with a simple olive oil/fresh herb marinade. I do appreciate, however, you sharing this recipe as I truly like to experiment with new dishes.

Great alternative to typical sauteed zucchini.  Versatile too  - change the crumbs and/or add seasonings to your liking.  In my case I used whole eggs, crushed garlic crouton crumbs and a mix of fresh herbs from my garden.  Not bad!

I found this same basic recipe elsewhere and have made it several times and really enjoyed it.  Instead of 2 egg whites I used 1 beaten egg and that also worked fine.  Also, I baked mine on parchment paper, which saved me the clean up of the cookie sheet and I didn't have to worry about sticking.      **Note: This recipe also works great with yellow crook-neck squash (summer squash).  I usually make this with a combo of both squash and zucchini.

I use the jumbo zucchini from my garden.  I sprinkle (okay completely cover) the breaded zucchini with mozzerella cheese at the end of the cooking and serve over paste with marinara sauce.  This is the perfect sub to chicken or eggplant parmesan.  :)

I have been making these for a while. I always add a little salt & pepper, garlic powder, oregano and basil. I use panko rather than bread crumbs and add more cheese than it calls for. I also mix zucchini with about 1 TBS olive oil before coating with cheese/panko mixture.

These were a hit at our BBQ. I added garlic powder and a little extra Parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs, as others suggested, and served with marinara sauce. I seem to always have an excess of zucchini from my garden, so I'll definitely be making these again, even when not entertaining, and just to eat at home!

These are outstanding, I loved them! I have to be honest, I am a big fan of breaded deep fried zucchini, and really thought I wasn't going to be fond of these. I was so wrong, I can't believe how tasty and crisp these are being that they are baked. I did add some garlic powder to the breadcrumb mixture, and I used a bit of olive oil to grease my baking sheet. I served these with marinara sauce and low fat ranch dressing for dipping. These will be made very often this summer using zucchini from my garden. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe :)

So yummy. I used plain bread crumbs and added 1 tsp of Italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. I baked them on oiled parchment and had no trouble with the crust falling off. After 6 minutes per side at 475* my thin slices were crispy.

VERY GOOD!!!  I doubled the bread crumb mixture and added powdered garlic plus extra parmesan cheese.   My 15yr old son who doesn't eat zucchini loved it!  Great with ranch dressing. Taste like restaurant style fried zucchini appetizers.

I was looking for a side dish to go along with the grilled steaks I had planned for dinner. I used Panko crumbs. I didn't have any Parm cheese so I just used salt, pepper and oregano. the tops browned up really nice but when I went to turn them, all the topping fell off. GGRRR what a waste! They did taste good but I will not be making these again.

We thought these were pretty good. Next time though I will add a little salt to the breading mix. Kinda missing something without it.

I thought these sounded like a great idea instead of the fried version. Once I made them - there was a lot left to be desired. I did it exactly according to the recipe instructions but it definitely was lacking taste. It could have used some more spices, maybe just garlic. The cooking time needs to be added to also, because 10 minutes was not enough. I kept them in for about 8 minutes on each side.. and even then they were barely done. They weren't horrible.. but I don't think I will try making them again anytime soon.. and I will read some suggestions in the reviews before I do!

THE BEST!I've always had the fried zucchini my whole life, but not after this! I did take the advice of others and increased the seasonings...I added a packet of dry Italian dressing to the breadcrumb mixture and some garlic powder as well. I also did not slice the zucchini as thick as the ones in the picture. When I baked them, I sprinkled with fresh parmesan and drizzled (slightly!) with olive oil and baked longer (20 min or so) then the recipe called for and they turned out perfect! My step daughter who doesn't like zucchini, loved these! Will definitely be making again! I would have to say the prep time is longer then the 5 min stated, but worth it. Thanks for the recipe!

These "chips" are awesome.  My husband now loves zucchini.  I've passed this recipe along to friends.  Everyone agrees -- it's the best.  I do what the other reviewers' said -- spray with cooking spray (olive oil spray) for crispiness.

Yum!!!  What a great recipe!  I love fried veggies.  This gives a similar flavor (even better depending on the mood I'm in), but leaves out all the fatty oil.  I did as A Cook in Houston suggested and sprayed with cooking spray to make them crispy.  It did the trick, and they turned out great!  This will go on my favorites list!

These turned out fantastic!  We all ate them!   I had a huge zucchini from our garden and this was great!   Used half panko/ half bread crumbs to give an extra crunch.  Also added some garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and some onion powder to the crumbs/cheese mix.  I had to make a second batch of the dry mix since we ran out half way thru.  Probably will double that part if I have another huge zucchini again!  Really yummy!

I only used my toaster oven to cook these and quickly realized I'd need a full sized cookie sheet but didn't have time to wait 15 minutes for the oven to preheat.  So I fried the rest in a little olive oil in a skillet.  Believe it or not, both I and my husband (who LOVES fried food) thought the oven ones were better.  The zuchinni was more tender on the inside and the batter was crunchier on the outside.  Unlike other reviewers (okay, I only read two), I thought they were a little bit of a pain to make BUT I enlisted my kids who had fun doing it and were a big help.  Plus, now that I see how yummy the baked ones are and relatively healthy, I will make these again.  It's so great to have a new way to make zuchinni.

These were good - a lot less mess than frying them.  The one problem I had was that when I made them as directed the breading didn't stick well at all.  The second time I made them, I dipped them in flour first, then egg, then the bread crumbs and it worked a lot better.  I also used Italian seasoned panko crumbs.  Yummy!

Wunnerful! I used panko bread crumbs with the addition of onion powder, garlic salt, 1/2 tsp cayenne, and some Italian seasonings. The kids, ages 10 and 8, are busy dipping the very skinny slices into ranch dressing. The heat in the cayenne tends to build up if you're not accustomed to it, so the ranch dressing helps cut the heat. Thanks for the post; I added a yellow squash and will consider adding a skinny Japanese eggplant! Will put in my keeper file.

I made this last night.  I followed the recipe,  although I ended up doubling the breading, and I used a whole egg and probably could have used two. I did follow another reviewers tip to spray each side with cooking spray,  which was supposed to make these crisp. They didn't get close to crisp.  They were good,  and I'd make them again,  but if you're looking for crisp,  forget it.

Fabulous recipe, great reception from 50 people for lunch today.  I used fresh grated Reggiano Asiago cheese.  I did increase the herbs a bit as per other reviews.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this last night along with the Balsamic Chicken *from A.R* and it turned out fantactic! My wife an I both enjoyed this immensely. I used whole egg instead of just egg white and added minced garlic and chilli pepper flakes to the bread crumb mixture for a little bit of extra flavour.  
Just as a heads up, make a little bit more of the bread crumb mixture that you think you'll need/than the recipe calls for. (The zucchini takes on quite a bit after being dunked in egg.)
TY for this recipe. We'll definitely be enjoying this one again!

This was a great side dish for our pasta dinner. I made a few changes. I only had one egg, so I added 1T of water to it. I didn't have enough breading to cover the zucchini. I ended up using 1C plain bread crumbs, 1t Italian seasoning, 2t minced garlic, 8 chopped fresh basil leaves, and 4T grated parm. After baking for 5 min., I flipped them over and sprinkled each piece with fresh shredded parm, then baked for another 7 min. Delicious! My 10 year old loved it. The crumbs left on the baking sheet were tasty when sprinkled over the pasta.

We liked these very much. I put a lot more parmesan cheese on them though. Don't forget to oil your pan. I forgot and they stuck, big time but we still very tasty. Will definitely be making these often. Gave these 4 stars because I save 5's for knock your socks off - to die for recipes.

These are so good! I used Panko instead of seasoned bread crumbs so just added some no salt garlic herb seasoning. I also decided to use the whole egg. I baked them on parchment paper at the suggested temp/time without turning them and they turned out perfectly crispy on the outside. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This is a good base recipe. I cut this recipe in half for a trial run and made my own bread crumbs from low-carb bread. I think this could use some spices, perhaps some homemade taco seasoning, cajun seasoning or italian seasoning. I might add more parmesan cheese next time. I like the way this recipe prepares zucchini that's not over greasy or smothered in cheese sauce. I served it with my zesty ranch dip. Very nice.

LOVED this!  I followed the recipe exactly, and only had one problem-there just wasn't enough egg or breading to do my whole zucchini(I halved the recipe).  I will make this again and just halve the zucchini and nothing else.  I may add some seasonings too, this recipe is one I think will be fun to play with!

This was a great recipe!   Good taste, great cooking method, good way to use up your zucchini and add a healthy side dish to grilled burgers or dogs.   I suggest adding about 1 tsp. dried or 1 tbsp. fresh of your favorite herb.   I tried both oregano and thyme  Rosemary would also work, as would chives.  YUM!

Very good! My 14 month old toddler managed to eat at least half of them - good way to get him to eat zucchini without having to fry it!  I also added the garlic powder and sprayed with cooking spray. If there was a crowd you may need to make quite a few to feed everyone.

I was very pleased with this recipe, but only after I took into consideration all the other tips.  I used a baking stone and sprayed lightly with cooking spray.  I also added red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and Emeril's essence to the mix and salted after baking. Using an entire egg, not just the whites, seemed to work fine for me for getting the crumbs to stick.  Also, I used a yellow zucchini--very tasty results.
Update 9-2-10: I now make this all the time for "fried" green tomatoes in the oven and get requests for it all the time. And I always add chipoltle powder too. Yummy for zucchini, green tomoatoes, and yellow squash!

I was skeptical at first about this recipe, but thank God I tried it.  Like some of the other reviews, it helps to 'doctor up' the bread crumb mixture a bit.  A little extra cheese and some garlic powder or other mixed seasoning (ie Mrs Dash or Penzey's Sunny Paris blend) gives it some extra flavor.  My family ate these up in no time and asked where the rest was!  They were so good.  I also used panko bread crumbs for a crispier texture.  Yum!  Can't wait to make them again.

After reading the reviews I made it for the 1st time...I used breadcrumbs, a package of dry italian salad dressing mix, and Parmesan cheese. The baked zucchini came out fabulous !!! Love it ! I will definitely make it again:)

Made these for dinner last night - my only modifications were that I added about a teaspoon of olive oil to the egg white mixture, used panko bread crumbs, added a wee bit of garlic powder to the crumb mixture, and didn't flip them. They were absolutely perfect - crispy & delicious!

These were simple enough and tasty. I took one reviewers suggestion and sliced them a bit thinner (about 1/8 inch) and they turned out crisp. I also used panko bread crumbs as I like their crunch better.

These were good and I'll make them again since they're pretty easy.  

I dipped the zucchini in flour first, then egg (I used Egg Beaters), then breadcrumbs.  Then I re-dipped into the egg and coated a 2nd time. So they were completely covered.

I did the same for sweet potato chips too.  Both types were yummy!

Excellent!  I used whole eggs instead of just egg whites since I didnt want to hassle with it and they turned out perfect. Crispy and very tasty! I doctored up the breadcrumbs a bit and added extra parmesan. So good--such a flashback to the 80's when we would eat zucchini sticks at happy hour. Love these!

Very Yummy!! A great way to use zucchini. After reading other posts I added extra parmesan cheese and some garlic powder and basil. Hubby and I both enjoyed them, but did not finish the entire zucchini I prepared. The true test will come tomorrow when we try to reheat them in the toaster oven. If they are just as good day two it's a winning recipe in this house!!!

Even after adding a lot of spices, these weren't very flavorful. I doubt I will make these again.

Delicious!  Followed as written.  Excellent with freshly grate Parm.  I did need to bake for a bit longer than suggested...about 22 minutes total.

These are quite good, and better than I expected!  I found the seasoned bread-crumbs a little stale tasting (it was a new container), so next time I might use plain and add my own seasoning; I also thought they could use a bit of salt despite the parmesan.  Still, though - my two year old voluntarily ate some, so I'm not complaining!  Thanks for the recipe!

Delish!  So easy to make and so tasty. I must confess like other reviewers, that I added a little garlic powder to the breading.  Baked 5 Minutes, turned them over and baked another 8 or so minutes...crispy, tasty just great!

Love this recipe.  I so look forward to my neighbor bringing me lots of zucchini so that I can make zucchini chips.  Served with a side of marinara dipping sauce, and yum.  I make these often and will continue doing so.

Nice change from the usual but I just wasn't awed by the recipe.  You will need to spice up the bread crumb mixture or the zucchini will taste a little bland.  I used Panko and mixed in pepper, salt, garlic powder and Italian seasoning.  Baked them for about 20 minutes.  I will make this again.

Everyone enjoyed these, they are light and crisp. I added more seasonings as recommended in many reviews....I think the chips would have been lacking flavor if I hadn't done that.

Great!  I only had panko bread crumbs, so used those seasoned with a garlic spice mix and extra parmesan and they turned out nice & crunchy.  My family loved these, and our 7 year old proclaimed them to be the BEST way to eat zucchini!

These were really good!  Advice used from other reviews:  add garlic,more cheese, and italian seasonings to the bread crumbs and spray when turned over. I then sprinkled about 1 1/2 Tbsp more cheese over all of the chips before putting them in the oven.  MY 10 YR OLD PICKY STEP SON ATE SOME!!!   They did get a little soggy as they cooled, so eat them like french fries - before the rest of your plate of food.:)1/16/09 update:  Used 2- 1.5" by 7" zucchinis, sliced on mandoline using 5mm setting, let set in refrigerator 30-40 min and cooked about 20 min total. (this made 1 large cookie sheet full)WONDERFUL and the breading/topping stuck very well.  Bumped up to 5 stars!  The kids (ages 10/12) polished them off BEFORE the tator tots I made as my back up plan!!!

All I can say is "YUMMY".  I could not stop eating these!  I too added hot sauce and I used panko crumbs and some parm cheese.  I would recommend adding just a little salt before baking.
Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

These were so good...and healthy! A little time consuming to dip in the egg whites and cover with the dry mix, but they turned out so tasty, especially dipped in ranch. Even non-veggie people liked them!

I sprinkled some garlic powder into the breadcrumbs, and squeezed fresh lemon juice on top of the chips before putting them into the oven, which gave them a nice tang.  This was a wonderful summertime recipe that we all loved.

I gave this a 4, because I had to read back to get tips on making them better (increasing the cheese, adding more spices, etc.).  I used gluten-free sundried tomato bread to make the crumbs and they came out very yummy.

These were awesome!  Even my picky kids who do not like veggies devoured these dipped in Ranch dip.  Yum!  I changed things up just a little bit to add flavor.  I sprinkled the Garlic & Wine seasoning from The Melting Pot restaurant into the Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Delicious!  These are a definite keeper!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Good recipe, added a few extra ingredients for my family's taste. Added 1/4 tsp each of garlic and onion powder, used italian seasoned bread crumbs, and 3 TBSP freshly grated parmesan cheese. Great dipped in ranch dressing.

They are very good right from the oven and thought I found a winner but then eating them after they've cooled and/or the next day, well not quite so great. Good way to use up zucchini but I'd say it's one of those recipes you'd need to eat right away while fresh and hot.  Thanks

Instead of using egg whites, I use that fat-free cartoned egg substitute. I add a little bit of salt (it needs it!), and I prefer the zucchini to be sliced a little thinner, more like 1/8". It's a time-consuming recipe if you have lots of zucchini you're dipping-and-dipping-and-baking, but they're pretty tasty! It also took a little longer for them to brown up. My husband liked them, our daughter wasn't impressed (pretty standard kid response to veggies, I think!), and I thought they were fine. I think they'd be better with a little cheddar or maybe mozzarella sprinkled on top and melted. Thanks for the recipe, Kris! :)

I did it exactly how the recipe states, it seemed to be a bit soggy and not enough flavor. If i were to make them again I would add more seasoning to them and cut them a bit thinner.

I mixed panko and seasoned bread crumbs and added a bit of parm cheese, along with garlic and more seasonings. I did follow the other suggestions to spray before baking and after flipping. Baked on parchment paper. Took these to party and they disappeared! Offered marinara and a fat free ranch dip to accompany - both were equally enjoyed. Will definitely make these again.

These were  very tasty.  I reduced the servings to 2 and added 1/8 teaspoon onion powder, 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/8 teaspoon Italian seasoning. Also used a whole egg instead of egg white. We enjoyed these and will make again.

I love these, I usually make these and cook them in a frying pan with oil and they are so much better and easier doing them in the oven! THANKS! I actually did them in my toaster oven on convection at 450 for approx 5 min ea side. It didn't seem to matter if they were cut thicker or thinner, I tried all different thicknesses and they were all crispy and perfect! I used the traditional breading method, dredging first in flour then dipping in a whole beaten egg and I used panko for the breading. I am sure I will be making these a lot more often now. I love having sour cream with garlic to dip them in, so very good!

Really good, but I ran out of breadcrumbs.  Slice the zucchini thinner than what the recipe says as well for maximum crispiness.  I added some crushed red pepper for a little more heat.  Next time, I'll add hot sauce to the egg mixture too.

I loved this recipe!!   I put the sliced zucchini in a bowl and added an egg white,stirring to coat.  For a gluten free coating I ground gluten free sesame seed crackers to a powder added my favourite spice (Parmesan and herb). And baked  as directed.  Yummy!!

Loved this! I added garlic salt as well as garlic and onion powder, to the breading and I used panko instead of bread crumbs. Baked at 450 for 7 minutes on each side, spraying with Pam before baking too.

Based on flavor alone, I would give this recipe a 4.  But when I take into consideration the amount of prepwork involved, I have to give it a 3. It took a lot of time to coat each little slice in egg, then in breadcrumbs, and also took a decent amount of time to flip each of them during baking.  Overall, I would be happy to eat these, but only if someone else is going to make them for me !

Made this tonight for a quick dinner,was short on bread crumbs so I added some cornmeal then mixed in Italian seasoning and garlic powder. They almost seem to melt in your mouth after you get the crunch of the bread coating, which is delicious. If you want to really have a "cheesy" hearty bite, double dip the slices back into the egg and then again into the crumbs.  They'll be thicker, but bake in the same amount of time.  I did both methods and love each! Also, it may sound a little weird, but a little avocado on top after they're baked is perfect!  I'll be making these often this summer!

My husband liked these and i thought they were decent after adding a lot of spices. otherwise they would have been pretty bland. we added more black pepper, onion powder, chili powder and cajun seasoning. sliced thin and they did not crisp up like chips but were still tasty.

As some have suggested, cut the zucchini very thin. I used a food processor and also cut up yellow squash. To the seasoned bread crumbs I added a garlic/parmesan seasoning. Scrumptious and I don't care for either vegetable!

These were amazingly good. I made a full pan of them for dinner last night, and they were all gone in about 10 minutes. 

I made a few small changes. I used whole eggs, because I was being lazy and didn't feel like separating the eggs. I added about a tsp of seasoning salt to the eggs before I beat them. For the breading I used panko bread crumbs to which I added garlic powder, onion powder, and a little paprika, and around half a cup of parm cheese. 

Once I had them on the baking sheet I sprayed the tops with Pam. I forgot to flip them, but they were crispy on both sides anyway. 

Definitely holding onto this one.

Very yummy, and a good way to use up zucchini from the garden. I ate an entire pan by myself! The reason for only granting 3 stars is because of the temperature and baking time. I found that the breading burnt, but on some of the thicker pieces of zucchini, they were still crunchy. I found that baking them at 425 for about 20 minutes worked out much better for me. Thanks for a great idea!

What a great recipe and so easy to make.  I will experiment the next time with more seasoning as we like a little more flavor.  I used spray Pam on my cookie sheet and that worked perfect.  Depending upon how crispy you like your zucchini you may have to adjust the time or the thickness of your slices.

This reminds me of a recipe I grew up with, but healthier since they're not sauteed in lots of butter.  It does help to spray them with cooking spray.  The change I made was to add finely crushed saltine crackers to the breadcrumbs (I use more crackers than breadcrumbs)  It gives them a nice flavor and extra crunch.

I've been making these for a couple of years now, and like to broil them on a dark cookie sheet.  I then top the zucchini with marinara sauce and some provolone or mozzarella, and stick them under the broiler for another minute.  Zucchini Pizzas!

Finally! A recipe that makes me *like* zucchini! I took others' suggestions, cut the slices thinner, added garlic powder and left to cook about 20 minutes (flipped half-way through) to let them get a little crispier. Husband has been put on a restricted diet, and these are a great alternative to chips!

I actually really liked these, even though I must admit I did not cook them until they were fully crispy/chip like. I tried to cut them as thin as possible, and followed another reviewer's suggestion of doubling the parm and adding garlic powder. Served these hot, cracked some fresh salt on top, with a side of pasta sauce (was out of salsa, but that would have been the lower cal option). I also opted for egg whites (eggbeaters) instead of using eggs with the yolks to cut back on fat content. They went fast, I think mostly because I couldn't stop eating them. I will make more next time. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for the first time and they were just OK.  Next time I would cut the chips thinner and season them with bread crums, cheese and chives.  I would also let them bake a little longer - The crispier the better!

I would call this baked fried zucchini.  I liked them, but they weren't very crispy, and I cut them pretty thin.  Husband hated them, but then he doesn't like zucchini either.

tasty but nothing special. Simple prep, would be a great addition to a buffet like setting, but it's nothing five star worthy.

My daughter and I loved this recipe.  So tasty!  If you want your kids to eat veggies, this recipe will do the trick.  I am on a gluten free diet, and crushed rice chex cereal is a super substitute for the bread crumbs.  Yum!

Simple and so much better for you than frying! I thought it was a bit "dry," but without oil, I think that's just going to happen. Probably will make again with a bump in spices...thanks!

These were good we dipped them in spicy mustard. My husband hates zucchini and even he liked them! They definitely need at least 5 then 10 minutes for fully crispy in our oven at least!

Very good and healthy! I too added more parm., garlic powder and basil to my seasoned bread crumbs and used a whole egg instead of the whites. Sprayed my cookie sheet with olive oil flavored Pam then sprayed the zucchini before I put in oven and again after turning. Baked for 7 minutes on one side and then 10 minutes on other side. Perfect and crispy! Even my husband and his son ate these and enjoyed them!!

Added garlic powder, extra parm and dried basil and sliced 1/8 inch instead. Let cook a little longer on each side until nicely browned. Excellent. It was gone before it cooled.

Made these with a fresh zucchini from the garden for a fmaily cookout.  I had to cook them more than 10 minutes per side and they were soggy, not at all crispy, and flavorless.

These are great because you can be so flexible with flavors - depending on taste and how it complements other dishes. I used seasoning salt, garlic salt, onion and garlic powder with whole wheat bread crumbs and dipped in a full egg. I thought they were a bit too salty but everyone else loved them. I also think spraying with oil before baking and keeping them sliced thinly is key. Definite repeat recipe!

These turned out ok.  They didn't have a lot of flavor.  I probably need to spice up the bread crumbs a little more next time.

Made these tonight for my son who IS NOT  zucchini lover.  They turned out great and he asked me to make these for him all the time.  I did add a little cayenne pepper for some heat instead of pepper, I also added granulated garlic.

These were good but needed a little more seasoning.  Next time I will add something spicy to the mix, like another reviewer said, maybe cayenne pepper.

The breadcrumb mix can use some more seasoning... like garlic powder and onion powder...maybe more parmesan. These are good though. I like that they are baked and not fried but still taste nice and crunchy. I served them with a garlicky mayoketchup dip that is very popular in PR (basically equal parts of mayo and ketchup with a pressed garlic clove or garlic powder mixed in).

I guess I would need a mandolin to make these thin enough to get crispy. My zucchini still tasted a little bitter even with the added garlic powder and parm cheese.

Yum! Used my homemade seasoned bread crumbs that I had in the freezer. Used a whole egg instead of the whites. I have an Italian Herb Grinder that has red pepper in it, gave it a really nice kick. Really good, fast & easy. Thanks!

I thought the concept of these were fabulous and when I tasted them hot out of the oven, I loved them but after setting out for a few minutes and needing to be re-heated in microwave, not so great.  My son liked the first one then, bailed out after that and quit eating them!  The key is the hot oven to crisp them up and I also added more cheese than called for b/c we love our cheese in any form.  All and all not bad but like other's have said, should be served immediately after baking oh and it was very quick which is a plus!!

I followed a few tips from previous rating. Spraying the chips with cooking spray gave a good crisp and also not cutting zucchini too thick. I added garlic salt, onion powder, smoked paprika, and extra Parmesan cheese....very good

I sliced these very thin, and added garlic powder and doubled the parmesan cheese. I baked for 10 minutes on one side, flipped them, and then baked them for another 10. I broiled them at the end too to make sure they were crispy.

These came out great! I added a little garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture, and whisked in a little water to the egg white to make sure I had enough to coat all the zucchini slices.  I actually baked at 375, since I had something else in the oven, so my baking time was about 7 minutes on each side.  Came out golden brown, crisp and delicious!

SO good! I love zucchini but have a hard time cooking it without making it mushy.  These were crisp and tasty!  I also added onion powder and doubled the Parmesan. I threw them into the broiler for the last two minutes for a little extra crisp.  Slice them thin because the thicker ones end up soggy.

Yep...this was pretty darn good! I ate one before I put them on the table and almost fishished the rest.  I had to make a second batch.  This was the perfect snack while watching a movie!

I really liked these.  What a great alternative to their fried cousins. Of couse they aren't as greasy as the fried version, but these tasted yummy and healthy.

These are great! I normally fry mine in the pan, but still very good this way and healthier. I think I may try using panko next time to see if it comes out crispier. Thanks for sharing!

I shouldn't give this recipe 5 stars because these things are so addictive, but I'm giving it 5 stars because these things are so addictive. 

For me, thinner is better...they're crispier, and I put the cut zucchini on paper towels first to absorb as much liquid as possible.

This is great. I followed the recipe exactly and they were great. I will definetly play with the spices in the bread mixture from here on out just to try new flavors but this recipe is great. My 20 month old son LOVED these so tha means it was a hit for me :-)

Made this recipe adding asiago cheese, grated parm and a little Old Bay Seasoning with the bread crumbs along with the suggested seasonings. The baking stone is a must plus a few more minutes on each side for extra crispiness. My husband and I have had these three times in the past week. We love dipping them in Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce.

Great recipe!  I didn't do anything that differently except to take other reviewer's advice to add a little garlic powder and use egg beaters.  I also sliced mine a bit thicker, as I wanted a more substantial side dish than a snack/appetizer.  Wow, this really turned out fantastic!  I can't wait to try the thinner "chip" version!  Will definitely be serving this one again.

Quick and easy. Tastes great. Don't try and substitute shredded parm (all I had)...it won't be as salty. I added a bit of red pepper powder into my breadcrumb mix and a bit of garlic powder. Great recipe.

We have used this recipe to replace our terrible habit of weekend chicken wings for this "bit more" healthier alternative. I tried a few of the suggestions on the reviews and would say you can add or take away the extras to your liking. A few musts are cut the zucchini thin, evenly coat each slice and definitely coat with a Pam before putting them in the oven even after each turn. We have added a bit of Franks Hot Sauce to the egg whites for an extra zing just like our chicken wings. We also add a lot of different spices to the bread crumbs of basically whatever is easy to grab from the cupboard but just go very, very lightly on the salt.

I found a similar recipe years ago to use up the abundance of squash and zucchini my parents always give me.  

For a little extra zing, use zesty italian dressing instead of egg whites.  I'm usually in the middle of cooking something else while these are in the oven, so I rarely, if ever, bother to flip them.  Flipping doesn't seem to change anything for me, but that could depend on your pan and how thick your slices are.

I followed the advice of others and kicked the breading up a notch by adding cayenne pepper and garlic powder.  It makes a world of difference.  This is a great and healthy sidedish; I didn't find it necessary to add oil of any kind.

These were great! I bought Italian seasoned bread crumbs, so I didn't add any additional seasonings to that mixture. I added closer to a 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese. I also sprayed the tops with cooking spray as other reviewers suggested. This made the chips crispy. These were devoured by my guests. I served with ranch dressing for dipping.

Excellent recipe.  I cut mine at about 1/8 inch so I needed more of the breadcrumbs.  I also added garlic and onion powder as someone had suggested.
Now I just need to get my hands on some more zucchini from someone's garden.

We made this for dinner a few weeks ago, and my oldest daughter loved it so much that she has to have it at least 3 times a week. We have the recipe memorized now, and I buy 10 zucchinis a week to support her zucchini chip habit, I'm not kidding. It's very filling for lunch, makes a great dinner side dish, and is nutritious too.

These were great! Along with the Parmesan cheese, I added a bit of garlic salt and a some freshly ground peppercorn. My family and I dipped them in homemade ranch dip and it was delicious! This is a great recipe because it allows you to dress it up or dress it down. You can't really call this a "bland" recipe because not everyone has the same desire for every kind of seasoning. With this recipe, anyone can turn this into a truly personal dish.  It's a keeper for us!

I had to cook my zucchini quite a bit longer, but I really like this recipe.  My husband actually ate zucchini!  We dipped them in ranch, not bad, I think some marinara sauce would be excellent, will definately make these again.  My husband used ketchup. :)

Pretty good!  They reminded me of the fried zucchini you get in a restaurant.  I did add seasoned salt and extra parmesan cheese.  You have to press them well into the breadcrumb mixture. We dipped thm in marinara sauce!

So good!!!  I love ordering this out and I absolutely love that I can make this more healthy!  I used Italian flavored bread crumbs and left over Panko (added season salt for more flavor) and used egg substitute.  I'm SURE I used more of both than the recipe called for in order to make this more breaded.  Also, make sure to press the "egged" zucchini into the mixture and then used up the remaining mixture, topping the zucchini with it.  Very tasty!!!

This recipe turned great from the oven. Next time I make this I will try an unseasoned bread crumb mixture.  There was too much flavour in the batter for me and it masked the zucchini flavour.

I used a whole egg. I think they use only egg whites in the recipe just to save a few calories. A yolk doesn't add many more calories, there no waste, and you need only 1 egg instead of 2. To save time I cut the zucchini in half and then lengthwise, into thin slices, like many restaurants do. An extra sprinkling of Parmesan cheese when they come out of the oven, makes them even more delicious.

I made this recipe with just a little more cheese and increased the bake time by 2 minutes on each side for crispier chips….FANTASTIC!  This recipe is a winner!

This recipe is very easy to put together and turned out very tasty. When these are cooked, they would make a great appetizer because they are  truly finger food and don't need any utensils, and would also make a great side dish. The only change that was made was instead of the two egg whites, we used the whole eggs.

Easy to prep and bake. Agree with others that I'd double the cheese and add some garlic powder.  Also I tried for more like 1/8 slices.  Big winner with our dinner guests!

I used egg beaters and added garlic powder and garlic salt to panko bread crumbs and fresh parm.  I didn't grease the pan I have a super stick free one and I didn't need to turn them over either.  I sliced them very thin and they cooked on both sides perfectly.  So good.  Thanks Kris.

My first batch, while tasting good, lost a great deal of its coating owing to the fact that I used freshly grated Parmesan.  Plus, the zucchini never crisped up.  I used a mandolin to cut them 1/8 inches thick.  The second batch I made, I used dry, pre-grated Parmesan.  The coating adhered much better but did not have the nutty flavor of the first batch.  I also found that  after the first bake (10 minutes), by letting them sit on the pan for a minute or two, the chips released from the pan more easily without losing a lot of crumb.  The second batch did not crisp up either.  However, I didn't find that particularly off-putting.  Next time, I will slice them as thin as possible in hopes of getting more crunch.

These were really good. I gave it a 4-star because my recipe varied a bit.  I used Italian Seasoned bread crumbs and I added a little salt, pepper and garlic powder to punch it up a bit. I also used Egg Beaters instead of egg white because that's what I had on hand.  I probably doubled the parmesan to 4 tbsp. and I used fresh graded.  I baked each side for approximately 8 minutes and they turned out wonderfully crispy. Loved them. I served as a side dish with lasagna instead of garlic bread.

I love these! They're sweet and crunchy!  They're a little bit of work, but so worth it!  I used 1/2 cup parmesan cheese and omitted the pepper.  Then, instead of egg whites, I used olive oil to coat the zucchini slices.  After making these quite a few times, I've found that if you keep all of the zucchini slices 1/8" thick, they get done faster and turn out little crispy.

Very good for a change of pace for zucchini. Since i had plain panko bread crumbs, I added garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.

I thought these were tasty.  My husband and kids, not so much.  I added 1/8 tsp paprika and drizzled olive oil over the top.  I would only make again using a small zucchini and cooking it for myself.

Really good.  I sliced my zucchini thinner for more crispiness. Cooked a bit longer.  Added a little more cheese and also garlic salt, onion powder, and basil flakes.  Prep time was a little longer since I dipped all the chips by hand.

These are yummy!  I added 1/8 tsp garlic powder & 1/8 tsp salt to the mixture.  I sprayed the tops of them with cooking spray.  They are not super crispy but very satisfying and I figured out with 60 pieces, they are only 1 Weight Watchers old points system for 10 pieces.

I've been looking for different ways to eat Zucchini, and this is perfect! It also curbs my craving for chips/french fries as well! I tried both egg whites and a while egg, but I found that the egg whites worked better as the yolk made the mixture a bit chunky and wouldn't stick to my zucchini. I added Johnny's Cesar seasoning to the breadcrumbs and did my best to 'double dip' them, but I ended up just mounting more of the breading on the top of the zucchini slice. I put them on tin foil and just didn't bother flipping them - I left them in for 20 minutes or so. They were crispy on top half, some of them stuck a bit to the tin foil, but not too bad. They tasted amazing and I have found a way to get my boyfriend to eat Zucchini!

These never got crisp but they tasted good.  I added garlic powder and a little extra parmesan.  Super yummy for me but the kids didn't like it (and they usually like zucchini).

These were excellent! My DH didn't expect to like them but he really thought they were great too. I did add onion & garlic powder as many reviews stated. I'll make these again - they're delicious!!

Really good - thanks for sharing! I didn't have some of the seasonings or bread crumbs so I subbed chili powder, garlic salt & used a mixture of dried coconut & flour. Resulted in a creamy curry flavour - amazing! For those who commented in a lack of flavour, I suspect you just need to add a bit of salt or make sure you are using "seasoned" bread crumbs.

Just made these and they are great.  I have made them before but on the stove top.  Way easier in the oven. Definitely will be making again especially with the abundance of zucchini’s we always have.

These are AMAZING!  I tried this recipe last night and was so happy to have a healthy side that tasted delicious.  I baked the chips 10 minutes per side, and used the Progresso Italian Style Panko Bread Crumbs.  I will definitely make these again!

these are awesome and easy.  I have always had fried zucchini sticks, but those have too much grease! this is a healthy solution.  I made zucchini and squash chips, they were excellent, i had some marzettis light ranch for a dip!

My husband and I love these!  I add extra parmesian cheese, garlic powder, and top with herb goat cheese after pulling out of the oven.  YUMMY!!  I also bake a few minutes longer just to give a little crispiness.

Just ran across this recipe and remembered that I made these last summer.  I obviously was unimpressed since I had forgotten about them.  I will say that if you have more zucchini than you know what to do with and need a change of pace, it's not a bad option - but definitely spice up the bread crumb mixture.

Tasty! I made these for a "let's try to be healthy" potluck and people were eating them off the baking sheet before I had a chance to get them on a plate! I followed another reviewer's suggestion to spray with olive oil before baking, and it definitely made them a little crispier. Great recipe! Thanks!

Wow, these really had no flavor! They tasted like plain zucchini with bread crumbs. When they were finished I drizzled some olive oil and salt on them to make them taste better, but had to pull off some of the crumbs because they were so flavorless. I used the whole eggs instead of the whites, because I didn't see the point in wasting 1/2 of the egg. I left out the pepper, but that would have only added heat. I wasn't expecting "chips," but I guess I was expecting something much better then zucchini slices that were bland & dry for the amount of work put in.

Great recipe!  Only addition was garlic and onion powder!  Super crispy after a quick shot with the broiler.  Will definitely make again!  Probably going to try dry mix with other veggies as well!

These were easy to make but didn't crisp up like I thought they would...I'm guessing cause their baked not fried. Like other reviewers I added some spices. I used a parm/pecorino/asagio cheese mix, and added a bit of salt, garlic, and mrs dash to the bread crumb mixture. Without these additions I think these would be too bland. They were okay but I'm not in a big hurry to make them again.

I probably will not make these again. It took forever for the chips to finish. It was a bit bland, I wasn't crazy about the taste at all. Some of my chips burnt some didnt. I find that it easier to eat when dipped in Spaghetti Sauce or Ranch.

Very tasty! I baked them for a little longer than the recipe said to in order to get them crispier. Left out the parmesan cheese because I'm forgetful, but we didn't miss it. We dipped them in spaghetti sauce, yum!

This is my new favorite thing to eat! I used yellow squash from my garden in place of zucchini and I made my own bread crumbs out of some stale bread I seasoned w/ salt, pepper, garlic powder, parsley and some dried savory. I also used egg beaters instead of whites and added a few dashes of hot sauce to the egg mix (it didn't make it spicey, it just gave the squash a super subtle, and yummy, kick to them!). I threw mine into the oven w/ the rest of our dinner @ 400 degrees so they took a little longer to crisp up but they turned out amazing. Thanks for the recipe!

These are good however, they definately need the parm cheese, otherwise they are a bit bland.  Also make sure to cook them a bit longer then recomended.  Overall though it is great for a replacement for fried food( which i can't have!)

Not bad, pretty good for a lower fat version of deep fried zucchini. I dont think I would go out of my way to make again though. Maybe if I get a craving I will make again. Thanks for the recipe

These are great!  Leftovers are good reheated and served like eggplant parmesan.  Terrific with sauce and pasta.  Also great as a snack dipped in ranch dressing.  Super recipe with many serving options.  Make sure you grease your pan well or the crunchy coating will stick to the pan.

What a great way to serve your zucchini! I really liked the fact that this recipe was health conscious and delicious! I followed the recipe as written and was pleasantly pleased with the flavor and ease of the vegetable dish...will make this again and again. I look forward to garden zucchini because I want to make this again soon:)

These are fantastic! I will definitely make these over and over again! Only thing i did differently was I dredged the zucchini in a little flour before dipping it in the egg.  They are great with some dipping sauce as well...marinara or hot sauce is what i tried with them....absolutely delicious!  And simple & quick too!  I didn't really follow the cooking time, i just checked on them every now and then and took them out when they looked crispy and done!  Love this recipe!

These are surprisingly good.  The coating is not as thick as I was expecting, but that is probably a good thing.  I sliced the zucchini very thin, and they did come out crispy tasting.  I think next time I will add just a little salt.

WOW! I didn't think I would ever be able to convince my family to eat zucchini. These were amazing and gobbled up by my hubby and daughter. I added salt and cayenne to the bread crumbs, as others suggested. I also used fresh parmesan cheese, and because I had plain bread crumbs, I added a little Italian Seasoning. Will make again and again!

I tried this using the original recipe but now that I see other reviews, I would slice the zucchini much thinner and maybe use the whole egg and add more spices. They were good but I think they could be better with the other reviewers suggestions.

I actually found this recipe on another website, we really liked it, I didn't use egg white but used a pastry brush and used olive oil and 1/4 cup of both P Cheese and Bread crumbs..the thinner slicer were of course much more crispy..can't wait to try this with my grand kids

Great for potlucks! I brought a huge platter of these in to work and they were gone in a snap!  I did throw just about my entire spice cabinet at these though. You can't go wrong adding your favorite spices to the bread crumbs. I even added some chili powder and a dash of cayenne pepper to give it a bit of a bite, and it was a nice, subtle taste since I didn't let myself go overboard. I was going to double the parmesan as was suggested by another reviewer, but I didn't have as much as I thought. I barely made the minimum amount. In retrospect, probably a good thing, since I think it was just fine without all the extra cheese.  I did use cooking spray on them on each side as they cooked, and they crisped up nicely.

I really loved this recipe! It's so simple, not to mention delicious and healthy! My one year old and my husband (who doesn't care for zucchini)liked it too! My only suggestion would be the thinner you slice the zucchini the better!

Excellent!!  My teenage son loved these.  Added a bit of cayenne pepper to bread crumb mixture.  Also baked slices of red potato prepared the same way (delicious!!!).  Made these to go with the Spinach Potato Frittata and found they really complement each other very well.  A real winner, I’ll make this one of my regulars.

Good.  Used yellow squash instead of zucchini.  Came out a little softer than crispy.  Added extra garlic powder and onion powder.  used whole eggs instead of egg whites.  In the end i used 3 eggs and over a cup of bread crumbs including extra other ingredients for 1 large yellow squash.

Fabulous! Used 2 full eggs, 1/2 panko & 1/2 seasoned bread crumbs, extra garlic & Italian seasonings. 10 minutes each side.  Best zucchini recipe I've found this summer.

Let me start out with I don't like squash, I'll eat it in zucchini bread, but that's about it. I tried this recipe, after reading reviews I sliced chips very thin, and made these changes used 4 tbs. parmesan cheese and added 1 tsp. garlic powder. They were great!!! I can make one suggestion use Kraft parmesan cheese, the second time I made them I used some other brand, they weren't good to me at all.

Here is my new favorite snack. I like to cook these a little longer and pull them just before they burn. To make them a touch healthier, I don't use the bread crumbs and they are still good.

I had a huge zucchini given to me by a neighbor, so I gave this recipe a try.  It tasted a lot like eggplant parmigiana, but I was looking for something crispier.  If I try this again, I'll try to slice even thinner.  Personally though, I think zucchini is best marinated in Italian dressing and grilled on a skewer!

I have a dehydrator and have had many yummy zucchini chips when dehydrated. This on was not so good in my opinion. However, that being said my husband and daughter liked them. I thought they were soggy and not very tasty, though.

I have another recipe for "Fried" Zucchini sticks (really baked) and it calls for a bunch of oil.  This is BY FAR better...I used Olive Oil spray like other users suggested before I baked and after I flipped.  I used a gluten free "italian herbed" bread crumb from Whole Foods Market...vegan parmesean cheese, and skipped the black pepper.  AWESOME!  Thin slices yield crispier zucchini chips...so darn good.  Definitely a keeper!

Eh. These were tasty but I am definitely not as enthusiastic as some of the other reviewers. I flavored my breadcrumbs with garlic powder, oregano, parsley and a healthy serving of parmesan. Dipped the zucchini in a whole beaten egg and then in the bread crumbs and baked as instructed. They were fine, they just weren't amazing and frankly, they were a little it dry which was surprising considering this is zucchini we are talking about here. They were good, just not great. I'd rather cook in a pan with onions and garlic.

Used seasoned bread crumbs and added some extra garlic powder and black pepper.  I tried someone else's advice of dipping in egg mixture, then in bread crumbs and then repeating.  The double dipped ones were better but it is messier and takes a bit more time.

Easy to make and great taste. They did not come out as crisp as I would have liked so next time I'll try cranking the temperature up a bit and playing with the time.

YUMMY!  I just used equal parts Italian Seasoned breading and parmesian cheese - my husband actually loved these and he is NOT a zucchini eater, except when I doctor it up.  It's a keeper.

These were okay, they didn't get crispy like I thought they would and I kept them in the oven an extra 5 minutes, they had a soft breadcrumb like taste. Maybe dipping in egg not egg white would have been better!

Really good! Kids devoured them!I doubled the cheese and used seasoned bread crumbs. I also cut them into 1/8 inch slices and then baked them on a large stone for 20 minutes. No flipping required and the thin cuts helped to make them crispy! Dip in ranch and you are set!

Thank you for giving me another zucchini option!  I took a page out of my Sneaky Chef cookbook and made the breading with wheat germ.  Also, I didn't have any panko so I used Nature Valley Double Fiber bread and threw it in the food processor.  I added parmesan cheese, pepper and the wheat germ and then followed your recipe.  I followed the hint of spraying the chips before flipping them.

These were really good!  I used half panko and added some garlic powder, salt and cayenne...nice change from the ordinary and a great way to use up extra zucchini!

I loved this method for making zucchini chips....and we have a lot of it in the garden right now!  I used a combo of panko and regular breadcrumbs and followed the advice of other reviewers who sprayed the pan and tops of the chips with some cooking spray.  We gobbled down 2 pans full and I felt NO guilt!!  I will make this again and again, tasted great with a dip of ranch and low fat sour cream.  thanks for this great idea, I love being able to control the fat and avoid frying!

They definately taste better with garlic and onion powder added.  I gave this 4 stars only because I wish they had turned out crispier but I think I just need to slice them thinner next time.  Overall very tasty!

Very good and easy!  I used one whole egg, and seasoned stuffing mix for the bread crumbs.  My oven only goes to 425* so it had to cook a while to get crispy.  My husband and I liked them, but the children didn't; thus the 4 stars.

These were so good, although my husband only ate one, and my daughter refused to even try it. I got to eat all of them and, boy were they yummy. I should have used some marinara to dip them in.

I've had this recipe saved since this summer, but last night was the first time I tried them.  They were delicious!  I sliced them thinner like other suggested and also added basil, garlic powder and italian seasoning.  And I also sprayed both sides with cooking spray.  I know I'm going to be making these again very soon!

I like these a lot but don't make them much because we usually don't have zucchini around the house.  However, I do usually add garlic and onion powder and spray both sides with cooking spray to crisp a bit more.

Thanks to the other great reviews my zucchini chips came out great!  I added some garlic salt to the bread crumbs and sprayed the chips with cooking spray before they went in the oven and after I flipped them.  I did cook them a little bit longer than 10 minutes also.  They were a hit with my friends! Thanks

This was a fabulous recipe!  You can actually bake them at 450 degrees for 5 mins then flip and bake for an additional 8-10 mins.  It was a nice, healthy addition to some football snacks!

OMG!!! Thank U 4 this recipe. I've never liked zucchini. I only made it once and hated it. Since I recently came off the MC fast, I'm trying to eat more vegetables. I thought; corn chips or zucchini chips, but I gave it a try and this is fabulous. I'm eating them right now. Crisp on the outside, tender on the inside and quite filling. I didn't even need the dip, but it's even better with the sweet and sour dip. I took the advice of other members and kicked it up a notch. Instead of using breadcrumbs I used crushed cornflakes. I didn't want to miss the corn chips too much LOL!! I added Italian seasoning, fresh grated Parmesan and sea salt to the corn flakes. I also seasoned the egg with cayenne pepper, black pepper, Some Ms. Dash Onion seasoning and a little soy sauce. I kept them the same size although thinner would have been nice too. I breaded them separately. It took some extra time but it was worth it. I used my pizza stone. I used a paper towel to squeeze out some of the moisture so each piece could be dry before I put it in the egg mixture. (Next time I'll try to buy fresh instead of frozen.) I used a round bowl for the breading so I could toss the piece around to coat it. Then I pressed it down before gently lifting it and placing it on the pizza stone. I cooked it a little longer than suggested but not more than 15 minutes. I never had to turn them over. That's another vegetable I can add to my previously veggie starved junk food diet. Now on to eggplant. :-D

I cut the zucchini a little thinner and added basil and garlic powder to the dry mix.  Cooked them 7 minutes on each side and they came out really nice.  Ranch on the side-yum!

It was ok, and I used wheat germ instead of breadcrumbs which is daring and not recommended.  Still, if you like zucchini, why not try it?

I made these as a side dish with veggie burgers for dinner, and they were really good!  Next time, I think I might make them and then place them in a casserole with marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese for a healthy and easy version of zucchini parmigiana.

Pretty good. I made a little dip as well that complimented the dish. It was comprised of low fat sour cream, lemon juice, a tiny bit of minced garlic, black pepper, dill weed all blended with a bit of feta cheese. MMMMM.

Okay so the reviewer who said you should double dip them is right on. Also these on their own are kinda bland but then again who eats fried zucchini without a dip? These I think are no different.  I made a cucumber Tzaki (dont know how to spell it) dip and my husband went nuts over these even my no veggie 2 year old ate one. We will definately make again but always with some sort of dip.

Any fan of Carl's Jr's fried zucchini will definitely appreciate this low cal, low fat alternative which is almost just as delicious.  

I took another reviewer's advice and added a few dashes of sriracha sauce to the egg whites.  So delicious but the crispiness doesn't hold up overnight so it's definitely an "eat as soon as you can get your hands on them" type of food.  They go great with a cucumber yogurt sauce or by themselves.  Will definitely make this yummy snack again!

Okay...definitely cut thin to get more breading on them.  Eat them when they're hot...after that, I didn't like them much. Won't make these again.

These are delicious!  The only change I made was that I added a little garlic salt to the bread crumbs.  I will definitely make these again (and again!)

Wonderful!  My family loves this recipe and it has become a favorite.  I do cut the wedges as thin as possible to make it as crispy as possible.

These are delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect.  The second time I made the recipe, I did not have breadcrumbs on hand so I used crushed seasoned croutons, which were also delicious.

These were pretty good.  I think I'd like a little more seasoning, so I might throw some Cayenne pepper or something into the breading, but the concept was solid and fairly tasty.  Nice work!

Great no-fat zucchini recipe!  Very easy.  I added garlic and onion powder to the Italian bread crumbs.  Fantastic.  I didn't dip them in anything!  What a great way to use up all of that zucchini! These were not bland at all.

My family enjoyed these very much- I had only plain breadcrumbs on hand so I seasoned them up with extra parmesan, old bay, garlic powder and seasoned salt.  My two year old daughter could not get enough of them!  We all enjoyed them dipped in a bit of ranch dressing.

I made these last night for dinner and they were sooo good.  I baked them a lot longer than I was supposed to just because I got side tracked, but they were still okay.  Next time I'll pay attention and I'm sure they'll be great.

After reading other reviews I added some additional spices but these were still pretty bland. I also think that the slice size recommended is too big, if they're smaller they'll be crispier and I think that's what I'll try next time.

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's not quite as good as fried.  For a healthier alternative, these are great.  You can really taste the parmesan and they brown nicely.

Really good for not being fried.  Added some Lawry's to the breading.  Make sure they are done same time as the rest of the food, they get cold very quickly.

Pretty good, unsure as to whether or not I'll make them again. A little time consuming, and I ended up having to cook them longer than suggested.  We dipped them in ranch and enjoyed it.

They were good, but it was too time-consuming dipping/coating each slice.  Also I think the spice/dip suggestions by others would have been better - it was a bit bland.  Whole egg is just fine - I made half with whites & half w/whole & couldn't tell the difference.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I could not get the bread crumbs to stick at all.  I finally just sprinkled the crumb mixture on the chips after placing on baking sheet and then sprinkled the other side with a little more parmesan cheese.  The taste was just okay.

These were pretty good!  I was really hoping they'd get crispy, but they stayed warm and moist on the inside.  It was basically a breaded piece of baked zucchini - but I liked it a lot.  I'll be making this again this summer.  Thanks!

I tried this recipe as written but must have done something wrong.  The breadcrumb mixture did not adhere to the zucchini after being dipped in egg whites.  They tasted good, though.  Any suggestions??

Rather bland - tasteless even. The bread crumbs were overkill, when they actually stuck to the zucchini - which was not that often. I doubt I'll ever make them again.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought they were very good.  I did have a hard time getting the zucchini  to end up being crispy though.  I ended up baking them for an additional 4 minutes past the 10 on the second side for my first batch and then ended up burning my second batch.  I greased my pan with olive oil and I think that was why they were not crisping up.  I am going to just use an olive oil spray next time.  Very good though!

I made a couple mods.  I used crushed cashews instead of the breading.  I didn't use the parmesan cheese, instead I added garlic powder and McCormick's  montreal chicken seasoning.  family loved it.. will definitely make again.

Quarter inch was way too thick.  I had to cook them for at least 20-25 minutes and they were still soggy.  Much thinner next time

Easy, will make again. Had Panko breading but just not enough so when in a pinch, substitute. I crushed some seasoned croutons and added them to the Panko along with some of the other suggestions,  garlic power, onion powder and a little paprika. Turned them after five minutes, used the cooking spray and just kept an eye on them. Did not separate the eggs either.

Nice way to use zucchini. I sliced them pretty thin, as suggested, and added more spice to the bread crumb mixture. I added a little hot sauce to the egg. I used one egg white and a whole egg. Very simple and delicious.

Not crispy enough, and flipping them halfway is a pain.  We made a second time to try again and only flipped half the batch - there was no difference between the flipped half and the other half.

This was incredibly good. I would recommend slicing the zucchini super thin otherwise they will become soggy. This was the perfect late night snack for the hubby.

I used this recipe as a base for what I made. Not much different than other recipes. However, i made the zucchini more like fries and made my own seasoned panko, used shredded pharm and added garlic powder. I used another reviewers suggestion and dipped them in ranch dressing. Very good. I will make again.

I was not happy with this recipe.  I followed the directions, but the breading wouldn't stay on the zucchini and the taste was very bland despite adding extra seasonings.

Zucchini always seems to be mushy so it was a nice surprise that these came out crispy.  I normally rate recipes as they are written but not this time.  I added garlic powder, dried basil, extra Parmesan and a small amount of panko to the bread crumb mixture. Next time I'll leave out the panko.

Perfect for the gigantic zucchini my mom's neighbor gave me.  I did, however, find it a little bland and will probably add more salt and pepper and maybe a bit of garlic powder to the bread crumbs next time.  And, yes, there will definitely be a next time!

I had panko bread crumbs instead of seasoned breadcrumbs so I sprinkled in a little pepper, garlic powder, and salt. I used fresh grated parmesan cheese.  The baked up crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Hubby and I loved them and am glad to have a great recipe to use up our bountiful crop of zucchini.

It was a good base recipe but a bit bland to me.    Next time, I will add more seasonings to the mix, maybe Italian seasoning, or garlic powder. Baked on a rack set in my baking pan, so no turning necessary.

I made as is but used panko instead of bread crumbs. Had a bit of trouble getting the mix to stick and next time I will cut the slices bigger as mine were too thin. Pretty good, my husband liked it more than I did

It was pretty good. The only problem I had was with the batter clumping, but I did make a double batch.

Simple and tasty - though some comments for those out there, like me, who like details :-) Use bread crumbs, I take old bread, let it dry out, then make it into crumbs in the food processor - I think this is just as good as store bought. Also, I don't add all the ingredients to the breadcrumbs - instead I sprinkle a bit of grated parm on each piece, I also added a bit of dried basil and then shook some garlic power on the whole thing - the result was very tasty. NOTE: cut your zucchini on a mandolin, I made mine less than the 1/4" mentioned, this makes the pieces consistent on thickness. I've made these twice now and find this to be a tasty and great way to add zucchini to the plate! I think it would be great as an appetizer too.

I used extra Parmesan/Romano cheese mix, 4 tbsp total.  Also added teaspoon garlic powder.  Foil lined a cookie sheet then sprayed olive oil all over foil.  Baked for 25 mins, flipping half way through, on 400 degrees since I was also cooking chicken on rack below.  I couldn't stop eating this and will make again!

Had some zucchini because I went shopping after having my eyes dilated and couldn't see I wasn't getting cucumbers.  This was a great, easy recipe and none made it past dinner!

Yum! These were pretty darn good to go along with some homemade chicken stew on a cold night. I used seasoned panko crumbs and gave a kick of garlic powder, made for a nice little side. Since I had some left over mushroom caps and left over egg and crumb mix, I decided to toss those puppies in there (waste no mushrooms!!) and boy, those were as tasty as the lovely little chips. I'll be making these again next soup night.

I made these for a nice snack and they didn’t disappoint! The only thing that didn’t work so well is that the breading didn’t adhere well.

Love these.  So simple, and zucchini is an awesome side dish.  I usually add some minced garlic to the eggs, and add some seasoning salt, more parmesan and some Asiago cheese to the bread crumb mixture.

Made this using 2 whole eggs, no parm (out of it).  Baked for 5, flipped 'em, 5 more, another 5 with oven turned off.  Pretty good.  Not fantastic, but good.  I love zucchini, but these are overwhelmed by bread crumbs.

I doubled the parm, added garlic and onion powder.  Other than that I followed all the directions exactly.  Spent time making sure that the zucchini slices were coated.  No one was impressed.  They really were blah.  Ended up tossing all my hard work into the trash.  Won't make these again.  Sorry..... I really do not know how they can be rated a five.

Very easy and very tasty. I've tried several recipes and found this one to be one of the best. I can make as much add I need all at once in the oven, no messy frying, but still delicious!

I was hoping these would be a replacement for fried breaded zucchini but I am sorry to say they are not.  I really did not like the taste nor the texture of the zucchini.

These are great. I'd suggest eating fresh out of the oven for best texture. I was expecting good results but these actually surprised me with the amount of flavor. And low calorie. Can't complain about that!

Amazing!!! One of the best vegetable side dishes I've made, EVER. I followed SAK's suggestions, and added a bit of African Smoke pepper seasoning, too. Also, I put a fair amount of sriracha in the egg mixture. Truly delicious dish! I will be making this again and again!

I thought these were the best ever and reheated nicely in the toaster oven.  A pleasingly different way to use up all that zucchini.

Surprisingly impressed!!!! I've tried kale and squash chips but was a little disappointed and I only recently tried adding zucchini to our diet and these were amazing!!! I made them for a Sunday night football event and everyone, even those who were skeptical, loved these!!!! I also just used a full egg instead of two egg whites. This recipe will become a regular appetizer for friend gatherings. Thank u for submitting!!! :)

Was looking for something to do with my larger zucchini's.  This was fabulous.  Quick, easy & tasty.  I didn't have bread crumb so I used saltine crackers & French's Fried Onions which was very tasty.  I will buy bread crumbs for the next batch.  Very good!

I've been making zucchini chips, baked, for 20+ yrs. I always double bread, then freeze. Up to 4 jellyroll pans at a time. I NEVER cook them as soon as I make them. By the time you get some crisp on the outside, the inside is mushy. I keep them in freezer bags and when I want some I cook at 425 for 7 minutes each side. They have a crispy outside and the inside has a bit mushy seeds, but crisp, firm flesh from the peel side in. You taste the zucchini. I also spray them with pam or drizzle some melted butter on them before I put them, frozen, in the oven. They're awesome with homemade sweet chili sauce. Try freezing first, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Happy cooking.

Used extra garlic powder as suggested by other reviewers. I used panko, which was ok, but didn't stick as well. I will use regular bread crumbs next time. Husband loved them too!

All 6 of us politely tasted one of these.  They crisped up nicely but needed more spices like cayenne or cumin.  Maybe a blend of cheese and more than recommended.  Seasoned breadcrumbs would have helped too.  Once again I should have taken the suggestions in the reviews.

These are amazing!! You would never believe that they were so healthy!!! I have made these so many times and they always come out great. They take a little work to individually bread each one and flip them half way but probably because I always make a huge batch! Well worth it

I would add some salt after they are on the pan.  A little bland.  Maybe some garlic as well.

Made these and loved, did use 1/4 cup reg bread crumbs and 1/4 cup of panko crumbs to give it a lottle extra crunch. Also used egg beaters for the egg. Was great diped in a little low cal ranch dressing.

I was really amazed at how well this worked! I added lemon peel, romano cheese and garlic salt to mine and coated the zucchini with a whole egg. It was crispy and delicious and a fantastic alternative to frying.

Very very bland.  I used whole egg and panko crumbs.  I added some seasoning salt since all reviews said they were bland.  Very disappointing considering the work.

I completely agree with the double dipping (egg, breading, egg, breading.) I made half batch with and half without. There was a pretty big difference. I baked at 425 for 8 min on each side.

Big hit! These were soooo delicious! I did half bread crumbs and half panko for crunchiness. I also doubled the cheese and added garlic powder and basil. I wet them down and put them in flour before the egg mix and that helped keep the mixture on them. Super yummy, very easy to make and everyone loved them. Great with fresh ranch dressing, too!

These were really yummy. I added herbs and cooked them longer on each side and they did get crispy.  I would follow others' reviews and add garlic, a little salt and more herbs next time.  Though my kids were not here this time around, I'm sure they would like these.

These lacked flavor as written.  The second time I made them I added lots of garlic powder and salt.  Much, much better that way.

This recipe was pretty good for use as a side pasta dish.  You  need to eat them right away, since they don't re-heat nicely, they get soggy.

I have been making this recipe for years now.  My daughter and I grow extra zucchini to make these.  I usually add some cajun seasoning to the bread crumbs because we like the extra spice, and we dip in low-fat or fat free ranch dressing.

Excellent!  I used 3 whole eggs and added cajun and tobasco sauce to it.  Then chilli powder to crumb mix.  Squeezed lime juice on zucchini first. Used left over with cauliflower.  Yummy!

I didn't "love" these -- not sure why.  I like zucchini OK, but these just seemed bland, and mine never crisped up! (maybe I cut my zucchini too thick?).  Also had trouble with the breading falling off of them when I lifted them out of the pan!  Although I've pan-fried lightly breaded squash/zucchini before, this just didn't seem to be anything special.  All in all, not a specfic recipe I'd make again.

Im typing this as my zucchini is in the oven. They have already been in there for over 10 min and still no browning. The batter keeps sticking and when you flip them the batter falls right off. I made sure to coat my pan in non stick spray and still they arent turning out like I planned. Oh well hopefully with the added seasonings they will turn out to be good and worth the time.

I tried these over the weekend just as the recipe states and I agree with another reviewer. They were good, but lacked something. I think I'll try the advice to add some additional spices (garlic powder, oregano) to the bread crumb mixture and will slice them thinner for a crispier version (although I thoroughly enjoyed the thicker slices as much as the thinner ones). Overall good recipe!

Excellent recipe, super easy to make and turns out great.  I had to add garlic powder and some Greek seasoning to the breadcrumbs to expand the taste.  I used real shredded parmesan too.  YUM!

We loved this. I did it with zucchini and yellow squash. It was delicious just as written. Upon tasting I decided to serve it with marinara sauce for dipping.  I highly recommend it.

These were a delicious way to get my non-veggie loving kids to eat zucchini.  They even asked me to make them again!!  Next time I will spice up the coating as other reviewers have suggested.

These were good. I used whole eggs instead of just egg whites and followed the rest of the recipe as written. These were good but next time I think I will add some spices to give it more flavor.

This turned out really well and SO MUCH LESS MESS then frying.  I added squash to mine because I have SO much of it growing in my garden and I'm pretty much the only person in my family who eats it.  Squash turned out great too and I am so excited because frying is such a pain and so not healthy.  I did add garlic powder because I am a huge fan and also Italian Seasoning.  I think I also added more Parmesan than recipe called for but that didn't hurt it a bit. I will be making this again and again!! Probably next time though it will only be with squash.

These were delicious and exciting. We felt like we had ordered deep fried zucchini at a pub! We double-dipped the zucchini to make sure it was flavorful and crunchy - and it was. Be sure to season the breadcrumbs like many other reviewers suggested.

These were nice but nothing spectacular. Second batch were better as I'd added more parmesan. Might make them again and add some garlic powder next time. My husband, strangely enough, loved them. I used Egg Beaters to cut down on cholesterol.

These were tasty.  My slices were just under 1/4" thick.  I used one regular egg, yolk and all.  I assembled these on the baking sheet early in the afternoon, covered and refrigerated until time to bake.  My baking sheet was pretty full and I thought they were pretty difficult to turn midway through baking, so I got lazy and didn't turn more than a few and put them back in the oven to finish.  Even without turning, they were pretty crispy which surprised me.

These were delicious, but next time I will add some additional seasonings to the bread crumbs--salt or garlic salt would probably do.  We dipped them in a little ranch dressing.  My husband loved them.

AMAZING!! I made with 6 zucchinis in two days because it was so delicious. Now I want more. I didn't use bread crumbs since I didn't have any, but used born meal instead it was very delicious. used with a pinch of garlic salt. I did get a little lazy and didn't flip them after five minutes. I just doubled the time and it seemed fine. (: and yes, the thinner - the crispier! I will make these for my road trip in a few weeks (:

These were good. But I did add a lot of seasoning. I admit that I did not have seasoned bread crumbs so I added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne pepper. They all got eaten so I'll make them again.

These were great.  I did make changes based on the reviews.  I added a bunch more spices - paprika, garlic powder, etc and used whole egg.  I think without the extra spices the chips wouldn't have been nearly as good, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.  I also sliced them very very thin and they came out nice and crunchy.  This was one of the few times I didn't have to push the kids to "eat their veggies".  They ate these first and asked for more!

These were a good snack, I did add some more seasonings and eating as soon as they come out of the oven is a must if you want the crispness, thanks for the recipe I will be using it alot.

These were very good - I did like the ones that were slightly thinner, since they were cooked more.  But the crust was very crispy for baked.  Next time I will add more seasonings.

EXCELLENT! I can't even believe how nice and crunchy these came out w/o having to fry them. I added some garlic powder and seasoned salt to the breadcrumbs along with the other things. I agree, the key is to slice them thin so they crisp up nicely. I sprayed the tops w/ cooking spray before putting in the oven and they came out a wonderful golden brown-perfect. The best part is that it's pretty much GUILT FREE! I will be using this recipe OFTEN! Thanks for sharing. :)

Needed just a little bit more flavor. I added salt and next time perhaps just a pinch of cayenne would do the trick. Very Good though. Will make again.

They are ok. They get soggy quickly. I cooked mine for about 7 minutes on each side. I think I'll add a little more seasonings next time I do them.

So easy and no fat......instead of black pepper I used Cayenne pepper for more zing, as some reviewers thought it was bland. I dipped them in cocktail sauce...better than a restaurant. I also used the whole egg rather than just the white...definitley will make this weekly...can't wait to try it on the grandkids. I think they will eat veggies this way.

Just what I was looking for!  I was having friends for dinner and one of them can't eat cheese (can you image) which I normally would service as an app.  So I went searching and found this!  It wasn't hard to put together and it really only took 15 minutes.  Will make again soon!  I served it with some left over pasta sauce.

I gave it 4 stars for the idea, but changed too many things to rate the original recipe a 5.  I used cornflake crumbs instead of bread crumbs, because that is what I had on hand.  Added the parmesan, basil, salt, pepper and double dipped the slices.  Also cut them thinner than 1/4 inch.  This recipe could be endlessly modified and still come out tasty.

I'm always looking for healthy (and delicious) recipes, and this one hit the spot. I added some herbs to the bread crumbs but otherwise kept the recipe as is. This were great and will become a regular addition to our meals. Thanks!

This was a fantastic alternative to frying!  I used panko bread crumbs and I thought it was a good but not necessary substitution.

Great flavor - baked about 5 minutes each side and found that to be a good consistency...still has enough crispness from the veggie. I used seasoned bread crumbs; would probably need extra seasoning if I hadn't done this. A great side-dish! Served with "Baked Shrimp w/ Feta and Tomato" for a healthy weeknight dinner!

OMG... what a great healthy way to have zucchini as opposed to the deep fried kind. I used one egg since I didn't feel like wasting the yolk. I added some flax to the breadcrumbs mixture to help add fiber and bind them better. I also added a little garlic powder after reading some other reviews. I also cut my zucchini thin so that way they would be crunchier. Good recipe!

These were DELICIOUS!  I didn't have breadcrumbs so I ground up saltines, which made it a little too salty.  I gave it 5 stars because I know they would have been perfect with the breadcrumbs.  I added garlic powder, onion powder and some dried herbs- my 8 year old couldn't get enough of these!  I will be making these again!

These are healthy, easy to make, and delicious dipped in ranch dressing or marinara sauce! I usually cut down on the parm. a little though to reduce the fat & cals! A great way to use up all that summer zucchini and yellow squash.

This was good.  I added some italian seasoning, crushed red peppers, garlic powder and doubled the parmesan cheese.  Next time I may only use 1/4 cup more parmesan cheese.  Sprayed the tops with pam.

Nice alternative to fries.. I adjusted the spices as other reviews suggested, including a couple dashes of hot sauce in the egg mixture. Also, I used whole eggs instead of egg whites, with no apparent drawbacks. I tried some double dipped, as some reviewers suggested, and I prefered the once-dipped. Twice just gave them too much breading.

Yumm-O! I really liked these and I've never been a big fan of zucchini. Used egg substitute in place of the egg whites and added garlic powder per some reviews.  I also sliced them thinner and baked them for an extra 5 minutes on each side for some extra crunchiness.  They were wonderful with some spicy ranch for dipping.  Glad I bought some extra zucchini!

I made the recipe as written, and we thought these were just ok.  I should've followed the advice of others and added some additional spices/seasonings to the bread crumb mixture.  The end product just wasn't worth the time and effort.

This was a major disappointment. Flavorless, and not nearly as good as a dozen ways I already use up zucchini.  My family begged me to not make this again.

Very good! I made these last night and we're having them again tonight. I think the secret is to spray the baking sheet really well and slice the zucchini thin.  I used Italian bread crumbs and added seasoned salt to the mix.

I've been making these for a long time now, based on a similar recipe my mom gave me. I add garlic powder and seasoned salt to the breadcrumb mix, and use a whole egg. I also slice the zucchini real thin (they come out crisper that way), and bake them at 270 C for 25 minutes, turn over and bake 5 more mins. They're really tasty dipped in ranch. Beware: they're pretty messy to make!

Very Yummy!!!!!!! I ended up needing more of the breadcrumbs mixture and egg whites and will next time add salt to the mix.  Very good though.  Great recipe, thanks!

Not great.  Kinda bland and not crispy.  If I get ambitious I may try to tweak the recipe.

These were really good. I cooked them way longer, until crispy, and ended up seasoning them alot more when they were done. I ate an entire tray by myself.

These were good, a little soggy but good with sour cream ranch dip. I think next time I will take another reviewer's advice and use panko bread crumbs.

These were tasty.  We ate them up really quickly, despite the fact that I'm just learning to like zucchini.  I sliced mine super thin to make them crispy.  However, that made them kind of tedious to dip.  So next time I think I would do lengthwise slicest to make less dipping work.

Yum!  I was going to use this recipe, but saw that I had McCormick "crusting blends" in my cupboard, and took the quick and easy way instead of mixing the seasonings.  I wish I would have followed the recipe because mine came out too salty (my husband loved it regardless). Thanks for the great recipe,  KRISRIZZIO, what a great way to utilize an abundance of zukes!

These were delicious! My husband ate the whole batch of them by himself so I had to make more for me later on! I used egg substitute and added some dried minced onion and garlic powder to the breading. We dipped them in light ranch dressing, and next time we'll try using marinara. Wonderful and easy!

These were great! I used a whole egg rather than just the egg white. My slices were about 1/4" thick and they needed to bake about 10 minutes per side.

Does take a bit of time. I put a bit too much garlic pepper, so it was a bit too peppery. Kids didn't really care for them, husband liked them. I'll give them another shot....

My mom used to make these all the time when I was younger. I guess she made them differently or I did something wrong. I was looking forward to having them again. I guess Ill have to ask her what she did and try again. My breadcrumbs didnt stick to the zucchini and it turned out bland... I guess you have to season them alot.

I had tried this recipe. I cut the zucchini thin, seasoned them, and baked them for the required time. However, these "chips" did not bake for me. After about an hour of baking, I had to give up because I had to go to work. I won't try this recipe again, why waste my zucchini, I might as well just throw them away.

Great recipe. I used fresh chopped basil and some red pepper flakes instead of cheese and sprayed with cooking spray and they came out delicious- served great with ranch dressing and some dijon mustard mixed w/ honey!

Sounded good, but overall I found the
chips to be bland. Like the others who tried this recipe, the breading did not adhere well to the chips, even after
spraying with oil and as one suggested adding a little of milk to the egg whites. The recipe needs more zip, and I think the baking allows for too much water to generate from the chips. Sorry.
Thank You for Sharing

These were okay, but nothing special. I didn't care for the parmesean mixed in. I'll stick to fried zuc, since we make it so infrequently anyway.

These were really good. My hubby even liked them and he's not that fond of zucchini. I think I should have left them in the oven just a little longer, I baked them for 6 mins. per side and sprayed with cooking spray before baking and after flipping. Will definitely make again.

These were pretty good - I would make them again.  I added garlic powder, onion powder and crushed red pepper on the advice from other reviews.  My husband did not care for the crushed red pepper in them, but also said even without it he would only eat a few of these and would not have a whole plate of them.  Since I ended up eating his, I had a whole plate of them and would eat another whole plate in the future!!!  I had some trouble getting the breading to stick to the zucchini, but the ones it did stick well to tasted great (so did the others but I wish there was more breading on them).  I ate them without sauce but imagine they'd taste great with a good marinara sauce.

Great! We gobbled them up. Served with Ranch.  Will try a little milk with the egg white mixture for better sticking.  Also seasoned breadcrumbs or own seasoning salt, garlic etc. might be good.

I was looking for something different to do with zucchini and found this recipe.  I was raised eating zucchini this way and up until recently it was the only way I would eat it.  I agree with other reviewers that thin sliced zucchini is the best.  And while of course it is healthier to bake it, it is really good fried too!

Pretty good with a little salt.  My kids even ate them.  I think I'll slice them a little thinner or bake them a little longer, though. They were a little too al dente for me.

Quick and easy side dish.  They were best eaten while hot and I definitely needed to add some salt.

This recipe was fun to make but it just wasn't what I was hoping for.  Both my husband and I agreed that the egg whites made the zucchini taste overwhelmingly eggy, and the bread crumb-combo on the chips just didn't blend well with the other flavors.  Other people clearly like this recipe; I guess it just wasn't for us.

mmmm....this one was okay i have say. i did use italian style bread crumbs for a bit more flavor but they weren't wonderful to me. much heathier than fried so that's a good thing. i have found better recipes to get veggies in.

I followed all of the suggestions including  double breading and spraying each side down in pam but they still did not turn out very "crispy" as the breading seemed to want to slide off as I flipped them. Either way they were DELICIOUS! They had a flavorful outer coating and a creamy warm zucchini center. I served with ranch and my boyfriend as well as my 2 year old could not get enough! I used 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs, 1/2 cup parm cheese, and a mix of garlic pepper, garlic salt, and italian spices for the breading and it was to die for!

What a great way to get your veggies!  I added extra spices to mine, but I did not use italian seasoning (I did not have any on hand).  I used Panko breadcrumbs, which have less fat than standard bread crumbs and are more crunchy.  Also, I think it helps to let them sit for 5-10 minutes after breading them.

The zucchini was great!  I ultra spiced up the breadcrumbs and even added some hot sauce to the egg whites (we like it spicy around here).  A few weeks later I used 1/2 breadcrumbs and 1/2 corn muffin mix and made "fried" green tomatoes (baked a few minutes longer than the zuc).  Great recipe for either!

About 3 minutes before them being done I took them out and put a little bit of leftover mashed potatoes ontop of each and sprinkled some cheese over it as well.  I them put them back in the oven for about 5 more minutes and this was a great little appetizer!

I really wanted this recipe to work but it didn't. Though the taste was great I couldn't get them crispy. I doctored the bread crumbs with garlic powder and basil, sprayed them with cooking spray and baked them at 390 in my convection oven for about 20 minutes. They turned out pretty good, but only barely crispy, and my boys wouldnt even try them. So the next time I used my regular oven at 425 and the coating turned black and set off the smoke alarm and the zucchini wasn't crispy at all (this is fresh zucchini straight from the garden). I may try it again in the convection oven but leave it in longer.

This recipe came out exactly as I expected - basic comfort food.  The recipe is mild, but oddly addictive.  I did find that the thinner slices were better - maybe because of the surface to breading ratio.  I also added garlic powder, as others suggested and cooked for 7 minutes on each side.  Overall, good for a healthy alternative to an italian craving.

The zucchini wasn't as crisp as I would have liked it to be - I even cooked it longer on each side than specified in the instructions. Perhaps I was expecting the crunch from fried zucchini instead? I think I'll stick to fried zucchini...

This is a great recipe!  I am pregnant and am trying to look for healthier recipes to substitute for fattening ones I love...and I'm a sucker for fried zucchini!  This is almost as good.  I sliced my zucchini thinner and cooked it an extra 3 minutes per side (I like it extra crispy) and the taste and texture were very close to fried zuc!  I also used unseasoned bread crumbs and just added a few spices I had on hand (garlic powder, S&P, spike, etc.) and it was delish!  

I do agree, though, with another comment that they taste much better hot than cooled--so eat them right out of the oven. YUM!  Thanks for the recipe!

I whipped this up at the last minute using some zucchini a neighbor gave me.  I used some of the extra seasonings suggested by other reviewers.  Everyone loved it, even the kids.  It was fast, easy and disappeared instantly.  This is a keeper.

I sliced the zucchini much thinner, and on the advice of others, added garlic and onion powders to the bread crumbs, and sprayed the tops with cooking spray before cooking and after flipping them over.  
Even my picky 11 year old liked them!!

These probally would have been better, if I had remembered to grease the aking sheet.  I backed them on a silicone baking sheet and they were tasty, just not crispy.  next time I will spray the pan instead.

So not worth all the work. Even with the help of my husband it took forever to coat all the zucchini, took forever to bake and it still ended up in the trash.

I love zucchini, but i wasn't impressed with it prepared this way.  I don't think i would make this again.

I thought these were just ok. They didn't get at all crispy - if I were to make them again, I would slice them much thinner than the recipe states - and the taste was a little bit bland. I think they might make a nice side dish if they were served with a cheesey sauce.

We enjoyed this for dinner last night.  Its a good, healthy way to use up zucchini.  My 3 year old enjoyed helping to make and eat them!  Next time I will add more seasonings.  Thanks for the recipe!

these weren't bad. Next time I'll try cooking them a bit longer as they weren't especially crispy. They could also use a few more spices. I added basil and garlic.
