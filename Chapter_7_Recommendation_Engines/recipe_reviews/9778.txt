I did not care for this recipe. Where do I begin? (1.) It calls for a teaspoon of water & then you are supposed to boil the dates in it? What?!!? Not possible- the best you can do is saute the dates. (2.) After mixing everything together you are then supposed to roll it into balls. Yeah right! The mixture is far too soupy to roll anything. (3.) The cookies then stuck to the pans so much that the cookies could not be removed from the pans at all! I had to scrape the cookies off the pans & then spend the rest of the night scrubbing the pans clean.

I loved these as a kid and when my mother died she didn't leave any recipes for anything, which was probably good, because she wasn't much of a cook, however, I haven't made cookies in 35 yrs.  I decided to make these to take to my Christmas party at work, everyone raved, and I am definately not a baker!   Next time I'll put the dates in the food processor, too sticky to chop with a knife.  Loved the results, though!

This was a very bizarre cookie.  The cookies never hardened and remained gooey blobs that stuck to your teeth.  I wouldn't go through the trouble to make them again.

Ah, where to begin? First, I have to say that these date balls taste delicious, just like my grandmother's. And it is the only date ball recipe I have found on this website without rice krispies (thank god!). Anyways, I found these to be quite difficult to make. I was trying to surprise my grandmother for Christmas by making date balls cause they are her favorite, but my mom and I lost her recipe. We didn't want to call her and ask, so I tried using this one.  There is something a little off about this recipe, and I think it has to do with the initial step. The proportion of dates to water to butter seem to be off, which is causing a consistency problem later. These don't maintain their ball shape very well in the oven or on the cooling rack, and they are just too soft. Granted, I haven't refrigerated them yet which will harden them considerably, but they lose their shape too fast before I can get them in the fridge!  I'm going to get my grandmother's recipe and post it on here. It is very similar to this, just definitely not as messy and difficult. 5 stars for taste though!

Non functional recipe totally agree with the other two bad reviews.  I never write reviews but had to. First reviewer was right on was to soupy, how to boil dates esp with one tsp of water?  I did it on low and kept stirring they don't break down that much. then after adding the egg whites beaten till stiff it was way to runny could not make a ball i added sugar, rice krispies, coconut and still couldn't make a ball ended up plopping on a cookie sheet kind of like bars but they never hardened after baking need to eat with spoon!!

It was way too liquid.  I kept checking the recipe convinced I forgot something.  I added a lot of quick oats - a bit at a time.  I probably added more than 1 cup and then I could make balls.  Everyone loves them!  But you have to add oats.
