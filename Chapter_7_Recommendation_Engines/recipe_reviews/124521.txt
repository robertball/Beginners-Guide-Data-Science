This recipe is very good. I followed the recipe exactly except instead of cream of mushroom soup, I used cream of chicken because my family does not like cream of mushroom. It turned out very tasty. I will definatly make this again.

My family loved this.  I did make a few changes though - I added mushrooms, garlic and green peppers.  I also doubled the recipe, so I used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of celery. I made a second time using frozen hash brown potatoes to cut down on prep time and it was equally yummy. I will definitely make this often - thanks Phyllis!!!

This was a good family meal.  My family enjoyed the flavor.  However, I have one suggestion I prefer a thicker gravy and I found that by using milk the gravy was thin and tranparent.  I suggest using 3/4 cup of heavy cream it makes a thicker gravy and taste great.

Man alive was this fantastic!  Instead of bulk sausage, I used pre-cooked turkey sausage, which is lower fat and gave it a fabulous taste!  I added sliced carrots and shredded zucchini.  I hate zucchini and shredding it into the casserole, I didn't even taste it but I got the veggies I needed!.  Great for picky kids!
Very easy to make too!  I doubled the batch and put half in the freezer.

First....its fabulous!. Its a great recipe and very simple to make. By mistake I mixed the potatoes in the cream mixture and was worried about the method afterward. I sliced one more potato (1 cup) and laid those at the bottom of casserole dish. Then pour the cream mixture(with potatoes) on top, then spread the sausage and repeat this layer once more. I used beef sausage and cut it up(1/4" thickness). Then I sautae it wid onion, touch of ginger and garlic. I exclude the salt and used black pepper. BE CAREFUL OF THE AMOUNT OF SALT YOU USED IN THIS RECIPE. Note that sausage & mushroom cream have their own season already. After all the rectifying; TADDAA!! My casserole was delicious.!! U should try it!

This was Great!! I was a little skeptical about the kids liking it, because you never know from one night to the next what they're going to like, but they LOVED it!!  I took a can of mushrooms and FINELY chopped them up, and I  threw them into the sausage meat when browning it, along w/the onions. They never knew they were in there! 
My youngest asked if I could make it tomorrow and the next day and the next day...

This recipe came to the rescue last night.  I had no idea what I was going to make until I remembered this casserole at the last minute.  I had all the ingredients except for the pork.  I did have enough ground beef, though.    I made the beef and spiced it as I would for tacos (a dash of salt, black pepper, garlic powder, ground cumin, chili powder...I don't use mixes as they are too salty for my taste) and cooked the onion with the beef.  Everything else was done according to the recipe.  It was delicious and everyone in the house enjoyed it.  My family wants me to make it again (with the sausage this time) for Christmas brunch.  Thanks for sharing, Ms Sheeley.

My family loved this casserole! My husband wanted it for dinner the next night too. My Daughter also had three helpings, no leftovers at my house! It will be a weekly menu item, very easy to make.

I try hard not to change it before I make it, and I didnt change the ingredients really, just the method.  I pre-heated the oven and began cooking the sausage in my pan on the stove top when it occured to me that my pan could also go into the oven.  And then I thought, well I could jump start my potatoes in with the sausage and not have to cook them so long in the oven.  So I added my tators, and then I thought well I could just add everything and make it a one pot meal.  So I mixed all the ingredients together in the pan, and since I already had the oven warmed, I decided to go ahead and bake it off since I figured the cheese would be better if browned up in the oven.  Anyways, it was a nice little recipe.  Quick and easy to assemble and it worked out as a one pot meal for me which I really like.  Thanks for sharing!

I liked this recipe. The sausage gave off great flavor. I omitted salt from others suggestions and am thankful I did so.  I added chopped carrots, mushrooms & green peppers to add some veggies and it tasted great together. It was a little soupy, so next time I might add a little flour in with the "soup mix".  I'm not sure if it was soupy because I added my own mushrooms to the mix? Anyways, it was a nice meal for a cold night. My 5 year old liked it too...although he said it "looked funny".

Excellent recipe.  Anytime you get a thumbs up from my grandma on a new recipe, you know it's a keeper.  I did tweak it a lil.  I used Mild breakfast sausage (next time I'll use Hot, the Mild was too mild).  I added frozen broccoli pieces into the layers after the potatoes.  I used 4 cups of sliced potatoes instead of 3.  1 can of soup didn't make very much "sauce" so after the last layers were put on, I took an additional can of mushroom soup added 1/2 cup of milk to it, stirred it really well and poured it over the very top of the casserole.  Baked for the full length of time, removed it from oven for about 5-7 minutes so it would thicken a bit, then sprinkled French's Durkee Onions on the top before adding the cheese.  Returned it to the oven uncovered for about another 10 min.  Let set for a few minutes before I served it.  Made homemade biscuits to go with it.  Very delicious!

This recipe was great! I added chopped onion, red and green peppers and zucchini to the sausage after it had browned about halfway. I also used a can of Campbell's cheese soup instead of the cream of mushroom and added some chili seasoning. My husband said it's a keeper!

FANTASTIC!! I didn't have much time but really wanted to make this so I boiled diced potatoes & heated/browned everything before I put it in the oven just to melt the cheese. I also added some garlic powder for the hubby. So I cheated a little but it was worth it..family loved it! Great comfort food after a hard day!

I don't usually eat much sausage, but I had a lb thawed out to make a meatloaf but forgot to thaw the hamburger.  oops.  So that's how I stumbled across this recipe.  I read someone else's review and followed their direction.  I made everything in my skillet/saute pan over the stove.  Instead of slicing potatoes I diced them, and added them to the sausage. Because I didn't have onion, I used onion powder.  Other than that, I used everything recipe called for-just cooked stovetop instead of oven.  From start to finish, meal took 30-40 minutes.  It's a recipe I'll be making again in the future.  Thanks for sharing! Our household enjoyed the recipe.

WOW. so good and easy to make......I used 3/4 a bag of frozen hashbrowns (which i pan fried for maybe 5-7 mins) instead of the potatoes...and only 1/4 cup of milk, since i did not want it soupy. I baked 350 for 30 minutes and then sprinkled a bit more cheese on top and baked an extra 5 mins til brown. This is going to be the 'Christmas Morning' breakfast recipe...yes, I'm making it again in 2 days...thank you for sharing:)****update: Xmas morning, still a hit. I prepared this the night before and then put it in the oven once we were up. still soooo good. :)

This is a great recipe. I was given some venison sausage, which I've never used before, and I used it in this recipe. It took nearly two hours in the oven to bake, covered, even with mandolin-sliced potatoes. I had to add 1/3 cup of water towards the end so the potatoes in the middle would cook. Shredded colby jack cheese went great on the top.  I'd definitely make this again.

WOW! This was surprisingly tasty. It was a meal made up mostly of things I already had. I cooked Italian sausage and bacon just until the sausage was no longer pink. I put shallots and garlic into the bacon grease for a few minutes. Added that and scallions to the sausage/bacon mixture. I used fat free half & half in the soup mixture.  Other reviewers claimed that the mixture was soupy, mine wasn’t. However, it was a little greasy. Be sure to drain the sausage/bacon as much as possible. Also added lots of shredded cheddar to the top. I used my food processor to slice the potatoes thin as well as to shred the cheese. I will make this again and again!!

Love this all in one breakfast/brunch dish!!! I first had it at a cafeteria and was soooo impressed with the taste that I hunted the internet soley based on what ingredients I could taste. This recipe was it!!!! Got the right one on the first try! Came out wonderfully. Next time I will try frozen hashbrowns for faster cooking. Thanks.

I think this is fantastic! I cut calories by only using 1/2 lb sausage and I believe it's still really meaty. I add garlic powder and a few dashes of hot sauce. What a great, easy dish!

This is delicious!!! I used garlic sausage cut into coins and then quartered. I browned it to give it some added flavor. I added some frozen green beans. I sauteed the onion with garlic and then added the green beans to thaw them. I did not add any salt, well I added a little garlic powder and just a little seasoning salt. I was so worried it would be a gloopy mess, but it was awesome! Reminded of me of scalloped potatoes but with added deliciousness!! Try it, its total comfort food!!

We liked this, very homey and comforting. I used cream of celery soup. It looked like it wasn't going to be enough liquid, but it was. I'd use cream of chicken next time (or a homemade bechamel sauce with a lot of garlic). Thanks for the recipe!

Had to whip up something tonight, and happened to have all these ingredients.  Didn't think it sounded that good, but my husband is great about eating just about anything, as long as he doesn't have to cook it!  What a great surprise!  This was delish and we'll be having it again.  To save on time, I MW'd the potatos and only had to heat this dish up about 30 mins in oven.  Only added some chopped bell pepper.  I also used elk sausage, since we had some in the freezer.  Yum

I just want to say me and family just finished our dinner and this dish is absolutely wonderful. Very easy to make. Think it will make great left overs to make breakfast burritos in the morning.

I made this for Easter and I doubled the recipe and it came out great! 

The only thing I did differently was I added green peppers to the recipe- I think it added an extra crunch and it tasted great! Very easy, simple recipe to do!

Too long for something that does not completely bowl you over.
Its the option for when you don't want to hit the supermarket as you'll most likely have the ingredients.

This was a great recipe!  I made it as-written, except for substituting a scallion for the onion since that is what I had on hand.  Hubby really liked it and I'll be re-heating the leftovers this morning and pairing it with scrambled eggs.

This was suprisingly good. I loved that it was easy to throw together, cheap, and can be adjusted to be healthier. (I used 2% cheddar cheese, no fat mushroom soup, and 2% milk)

Just had this for dinner. Very good, simple, quick meal! To save on prep and cooking time, I used 3 cans of sliced potatoes. Only had to bake at 350 for about 35 minutes. I used a Cheddar, Colby, Pepper Jack shredded mix for more flavor. I also cut back on the milk, using 1/2 cup. It was still a little soupy, but not bad. Everyone is full and happy, so I will make this many times to come! Thx for a simple anytime meal!

I make this weekly and I boil the potatoes before baking to cut baking time down to 20 minutes.  I leave the skin on too, just for the sake of not being wasteful,the vitamins that are in there, and it saves time.  I use Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage and chop it up as I would hamburger meat for spaghetti.  I use a can of chicken gravy (just because I didn't have a 2nd can of soup one day and it stuck)and a can of cream of mushroom soup and 1.5C of milk.  My family likes lots of cheese so I keep shredding until it looks good.  I spray a 11x15 pan and put it all in there as the recipe says and bake.  I cut the temp down a little too as my oven runs a little hot.

Pretty good.  Easy.  I half-baked my potatoes in the microwave to make the cooking time shorter.  Worked great.  My 11-month old loved it.

Very good!  I don't use canned soup so I made it with my baisc go to condensed "cream of" mix, added mushrooms to the soup and the sausage mixture.  I used ground chicken and added sausage spices so it wasn't greasy at all (I acutally had to add oil to saute the onions). Perfect for a cool winter night.  Definitely will be a staple recipe in my kitchen!

Using these directions with exact measurements and baking for 1 hour and 45 minutes, the potatoes were still undercooked and the casserole soupy.  Good flavor, but will probably not make again.

I thought this casserole was fantastic!  I added some garlic powder into the soup mixture and instead of using mushroom soup I used cheddar cheese soup....my husband went nuts over it.  As well, I threw a couple handfuls of frozen veggies in the first layer.  I also used honey garlic sausage it was amazing...I will be making this again and again!

My family loved this dish!! The hubby and kids are wild about cheese so of course I added a little extra. They went on and on about it. I also pre boiled my tators until half done and it cut the cook time in the oven to half. We hade added to my "Tried and True" recipe book.

I agree with Heidi, so I added a can of drained green chilies, and some chopped pickled jalapenos. It gave it the extra spicy heat that we love!

My Hubby LOVED this and the kids really enjoyed it.  However, I did re-vamp it a bit.  There was another casserole like this that did not have the potatoes but had eggs.  Soo....I did everything the same EXCEPT for mixing the milk w/ 9 eggs and making this my top layer.  Then added the cheese when the casserole was just about finished.  It took about 45 minutes to cook, and like I said my family really enjoyed it!

To speed the bake time up, i boiled the potatoes first until they were starting to get soft and then i chopped them into bite-size pieces.  I used turkey brats and fried them in a pan, cut them into bite size pieces and then layered into the pan with the sauce. This way I only baked it for 45 minutes and it was YUMMY!!!!!

My first casserole ever, but certainly not my last.  I used some veggie sausage and mixed an egg into the "sausage".  Also added half a green pepper, some mushrooms, parsley and rosemary.  My boyfriend loved it.  Great recipe!

I found this caserole to have a lack of flavour, even with the garlic and peppers I added. My family didn't enjoy.

I make this casserole often, except I always add a bit if crushed red pepper to it. I also omit the salt and only use a half pound of the pork sausage because I think the original recipe asks for too much. With these small changes it's fantastic.
I also make it without the sausage from time to time.

I've made this several times and we always love it! The first time I made it I didn't have any ground sausage but I did have smoked sausage, so I sliced that up and used that instead because we loved it so much the first time I've always used smoked sausage since, although I'm sure it would be equally as good with ground sausage. I also always add diced onion and depending on what I have on hand I sometimes add diced bell pepper and mushrooms. I decided I wanted to make this for Sunday lunch after church the other day but knew I didn't want to wait for it to bake in the oven after we got home. So I decided to try it in the crockpot. I doubled the recipe using cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup and mixed the soup,  milk, salt and pepper together in a bowl, then sprayed the pot with cooking spray and layered the ingredients; potatoes, onion, mushrooms, sausage, cheese, 1/2 the soup mixture, then repeated the layering with the other half of the ingredients. Cooked it on high for 4 hours and the house smelled wonderful when we got home from church! My family, who don't normally like potato casseroles, didn't leave any left overs! I will definitely be making it this way again, although I may try using a disposable crockpot liner bag for even easier clean up.

We really liked this recipe! I did modify it just a bit as I had some things on hand that I wanted to use. I added diced green pepper -same amount as the onion. I also added some garlic powder, cayenne pepper, a little more cracked black pepper than stated to the soup mixture. Used a cup of milk and also used fresh shredded sharp cheddar. A very good recipe and can have So many variations-hamburger, turkey, different veggies and spices. Very versatile.

This is my husband's absolute favorite meal! The only thing I've changed is that I found using frozen tater tots works better than peeling and dicing potatoes. Its alot faster and my hubby says it tastes better too because then it mixes more with the other ingredients. : )

I love this recipe and have added it to my supper recipes, however, I found it too salty (and I LOVE salt) I eliminated the salt, used low salt soup and upped the milk to 1 cup.

Loved it- made it for my Sunday School class, used Half & Half and added a bit of ground cayenne pepper, perfect- not soupy- nice and thick.  NOTE: because of previous comments about how oily it was, I drained the sausage in a colander and pressed into it with a bowl on top to squeeze all the oil out best.  It was not oily at all

Sausage, potatoes and cheese! Yummy!! I would rate it higher if there was not so much oil in the dish. I followed the directions as they are and made sure to drain the sausage before adding it to the casserole. Maybe it was the cheese, I let the cheese (craft shredded cheddar) melt about double the time (10 min).

Soooo yummy!!! This is very easy, and very flavorful! I added some shredded zucchini and some chopped fresh mushrooms and cooked them and the onions with the sausage. My husband loved it and couldn't even tell there was any veggies in it! I will definitely be making this again!!!

I love the versatility of this recipe! As written, it is delicious, and I have made my own variations using what I had on hand. I made it exactly as written the first time, and it did take about 10 mins longer to cook. When I make it now, I use leftover baked potatoes to cut down on the baking time.

I agree with everyone else on the amount of salt you use.. I am making this receipe in the oven as we speak, and this time i am not adding any salt , as the soup mixture and the sausage have seasoning of there own. Also i made a mistake i was in a rush to get it made for 4:30 that i actualy put the cheese on for the full one hour and 30 minutes. Hopefully it turns out great.. going to sprinkle a bit more cheese on the last five minutes.  Love this receipe

This was absolutely delicious!  I followed the basic recipe except I didn't add salt and I added a little corn starch to thicken it a bit since some were saying it was a bit runny. I also used cream of celery because I don't like mushrooms.  I used a farmer john's smoked beef sausage (it was on sale) and it came out wonderful.  It didn't need any salt because it got enough flavor from the sausage, soup and cheese.  I was a bit skeptical about this recipe but it turned out great.  I can see why kids would like it since it has ingredients kids like to eat.  As with all casseroles, it was even better the next day when I took the left overs for lunch.  The combination of flavors complement each other to make this on my list of favorites.  Thank you for submitting this delicious dish!

It tasted good, but a little bland.  My family thinks perhaps less pepper, and more onion flavor.  We prefer our potatos a bit firmer, so I would cut down on the cooking time.  I followed the recipe exactly as written up until the end, when 1 cup of cheese wouldn't cover the casserole.  Instead, I used two cups.  We are a cheese-y family.  Next time, when preparing, I would also mix the sausage in with the gravy.  Perhaps that would help the seasoning, but more importantly, it would help blend easier in the layers.    My family also says perhaps have cheese in the middle as well, kind of like a lasagna.

I made this for dinner and it was great.  I used smoked sausage instead because it's what I had.  I sauteed the sausage until browned in a skillet with onions and garlic.  I mixed the soup together with a can of evaporated milk.  I also boiled my potatoes for 10 minutes to speed up the cook time.  I baked it all together at 350 for 40 minutes and it was delicious.  Thanks for this easy recipe.

My husband was skeptical when I told him I was making this recipe, but we both loved it so I have added it into our menu rotation.  The only changes I made were to delete the salt and increase the cheese to 1 1/2 c, otherwise it is delicious as is.

Fantastic! Very easy, quick and tasty. I didn't bother to peel my potatoes and it was just fine. I sliced mine in the food processor so it made it twice as fast. Mine only took a little over an hour to bake. Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm giving it an extra star than I would have normally, because I think the changes I made probably made a difference. I subbed cream, which I needed to use the last of, for milk as another reviewer suggested.  I also subbed cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom.  The sauce came out very thick, and even in cooking did not thin out and cover all the potatoes. Also, I wanted to cut down on the cooking time so I used baked potatoes that I sliced up.  I think these changes just gave it an odd flavor.  Not bad, just different than what I was expecting, I guess. Plus I think I overbrowned the sausage (some people might call it "burnt") which probably didn't exactly help the taste or texture, since I used it anyway (it wasn't charred or anything, just overly browned). I might try this again and actually follow the directions and see how it's supposed to turn out!

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because I think it's a great jumping off point.  I did the recipe pretty much as is, and I found it a little bland.  I think it needs a little something more, some heat or something.  Definitely worth experimenting with.

very good! I made it for dinner but I think it would be better for breakfast, unless next time I use ground turkey and maybe add some veggies. I also used cream of chicken. I sauted onions in some of the left over sausage grease and then added about a tbls of flour to the onions, then added it to the soup mixture. I will make this again and try the turkey next time

I was amazed at how great this turned out! Next time I'll cut back on the salt (maybe to a pinch). I also added a bit more cheese because the 1 cup didn't cover it entirely. It was easy, and affordable for a college student's budget! Definitely keeping this in my recipe box!

This is a good casserole, very filling. My husband called it "interesting." I had sausage links so I cut them up very small and fried them along with garlic, onions, mushrooms and red/green peppers. Parboiled the slices of potatoes for about 5 minutes. Made a white sauce and then layered everything. Putting cheese on top while it cooked, which got all brown. Next time I'll put cheese for a couple of minutes at the end as the recipes says. Oops. Not sure if I'll make it again, but it's a great combo of ingredients that you don't find often in a casserole dish.

I diverted from the recipe in several ways, but it still came out delicious!  My husband especially was a huge fan.  I did not have any onions on hand, so instead I threw in a tablespoon of no salt seasoning (like Mrs. Dash) for flavor.  Also, I wanted to decrease the cooking time, so I pre-baked the potatoes in the microwave and sliced them afterward.  I may not have gotten the slices as thin as the recipe calls for, but I think it made the casserole really hearty.  I'll definitely be making this again.

At first, this recipe didn't sound appealing but decided to try it based on other reviews. I'm glad I did! It was awesome. My 3 year old even had seconds! I did leave out the salt and pepper, just to let everyone add their own. And, I added a little more potatoes (about 1/2- 1 cup) because other reviews said it was a little soupy. Other than that, I followed the recipe. My only negative comment is I should have made a double batch because there wasn't any left!  I will definately be making this again... maybe tonight!

I accidentally added the cheese right away instead of after baking for an hour and a half.  I don't think that really hurt the recipe because we really enjoyed it anyway, but next time I'll do it the right way.  It reheated beautifully and the leftovers were all gone the next day.

Very good simple, hearty meal. Omitted the salt and didn't even notice. The only other change was cooking the onions with the sausage. I cooked it for the full 1 1/2 hours and didn't find it soupy as other reviews stated. Husband and kids (3 & 5) loved it and requested that I make it again. Next time I will take other reviewers suggestions and add more veggies. A keeper - Thanks!

This was a very tasty recipe.  I used italian pork sausage since I didn't have regular sausage and it gave the dish a different "kick".  I also saute'd the onions with the meat as did other reviewers which I think added more flavor.  I doubled the recipe so we could have it for our lunches at work.  My family really enjoyed this dish.

When I tasted this recipe I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  The only thing different I did was I sliced the sausage into thinner rounds and cooked them in the frying pan that way! Excellent recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Great hardy cold night meal.  I did use cream of mushroom with garlic soup (the hubby loves garlic).  Other than that I followed the recipe and it was great.  The leftovers warmed up the next night were almost better than the original meal.  The next time I make this (and I will) I'm going to use Italian sausage for a change of pace.

My whole family loved this.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I just boiled off a long italian sausage, browned it, and sliced it into the casserole instead.  Can't imagine that that made much difference.  Will definately make this one again.  Very easy!

I omitted salt, added peppers and carrots.  Microwaved the potatoes in a little water and then drained to decrease cooking time.  However, this made for a more soupy dish. I was probably better off sticking to the original cooking time. Added seasoned pepper as well.  Gave it a little more kick.

I'm giving it 4stars because I thought it was pretty good, but DH hated it!  I layered it and with the 1st layer added some slices of velveeta to make it cheesier but that was my only change to the recipe.  Unfortunately because DH didn't like it I won't make it again!  Sorry!

The only thing I did differently was use cream of potato soup rather than mushroom, and it was great! My hubby said it's a keeper! So I'll definitely be making this again!

I doubled this recipe and served it as part of a brunch for 8 people. There were no leftovers. I passed on the recipe to two of my guests.

I made this tonight with extra ingredients from Thanksgiving, so that was convenient.  It tasted delicious! I would make it again; however, I would not put as much salt as it calls for next time because the sausage provides plenty.

This is really good!  Used 4 cups of frozen diced potatoes and a heaping teasoon of lemon pepper instead of salt and pepper.  Could easily become a weeknight staple.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  However, we are not mushroom eaters so I substituted cream of mushroom soup with cheddar sheese soup.  It was AWESOME!

This dish was just okay.  Mine turned out a bit salty, but I used seasoned garlic sausage and still added the 1/2 tsp salt and I believe there is salt in the soup.  It was also little bland.  I'd like to add something to it (veggie), but can't think of what just yet.
