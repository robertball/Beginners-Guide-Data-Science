Great recipe, easy to make and very delicious. I usually modify a bit the recipe but this time I followed the recipe as it is and the result was great.

Very good and healthy.  I added some Chinese five spice to give it a little more flavor. A touch on the bland side and I didn't want the dish overpowered by curry flavor. I put it on a bed of  riced cauliflower.  (Chinese five spice should always be in your spice rack.  It is a game changer!)
