It was ok. Took about 25 -30 min for the rolls to cook on top. The biscuits took over the taste of the sloppy joe. I would suggest doubling the meat & cheese amount because it wasnt thick enough. I think maybe a better way would be to individually wrap the buscuits around the meat & cook them that way, to me it was just too much of a roll taste.

It was good but I found the bottom crust a little doughy,  next time I think I will pre-cook the bottom before adding the meat mixture cheese and top crust.

I did not have sloppy joe mix on hand, so instead, I mixed in 2 small (8oz. each) cans of tomato paste with the browned ground beef, along with some frozen chopped onion and a few basic spices - basil, oregano, and a little salt & pepper.  I also baked the bottom crescent layer for about 5 mins. while the filling was cooking, to ensure it would not be doughy, and then I baked the whole thing about 23 minutes.  All in all, very tasty!!

I used to make this YEARS ago, when my kids were school age, (the 80's) and they loved it!  When I made it recently, I put it on a cookie sheet, and used only 1 can of sloppy joe mix. (live by myself) It turned out really nice, and I shared with a bachelor neighbor who is a BAD cook (LOL) and he really liked it! Thanks for the memory!

Made this into a pie using one can of the reduced fat crescent rolls as the bottom layer. (Pre-cooked for about 5 minutes) Then topped it with ground turkey and just used bbq sauce. To give it a little more substance and to squeeze in some veggies, I added a can of kidney beans, corn and red pepper. Topped with a blend of reduced fat gruyere and cheddar. My family loved it. There was none left.

I liked this one the first time I made it and so I made it again but the 2nd time I accidentally bought regular crescent rolls instead of the reduced fat and I dont know why but it made a difference to me.  I think with the regular ones you get fluffier dough and it was too much.  I do suggest making it with the reduced fat crescent rolls and after making it a few more times at my family's request I am already tired of this one and will probably just stick to regular sloppy joes from now on.

I like this quick and simple recipe. I added more meat because the dough overtook the meat the first time. Other than that, it's a great quickie recipe!

Pretty good! I used biscuits instead of crescent rolls to save on fat. Might make this again.

What can I say...it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  On the plus side it made a lot, but I won't be making it again.

This is really good. Re-heated in the microwave is good too. The only change I made was using the crescent seamless sheet dough, instead of rolls. Saves time for sure!

We made it for 200 so increased everything.  We pre-cooked the bottom layer of crescent rolls so it wouldn't get mushy.  Turned out great.
