I make these kind of pies a lot because my husband loves them. I think one of the problems some might be having is that the directions aren't very specific--it says to prepare the pudding according to the box. On the box there are directions for making regular pudding and then directions for making pudding for pie. When making a pie, use 1/4 c less milk. Make sure your strawberries drain on a paper towel before putting them on top of the pudding. If you do both these things, it should turn out fine. I made this with lemon pudding instead of vanilla, and that was really good.

Because of the review that said this was very sweet I was a little nervous.  So I made the graham cracker crust without sugar and only used enough glaze to cover the pie.  I thought it was truned out great.  I really enjoyed it.

This pie had fantastic flavor, but It didn't set right. I put it in the fridge for a few hours before serving...any suggestions?

This pie was a mess. You can't cut actual slices because the pudding just oozes out everywhere. What a mess!

This type of pie is one of the BEST! My mom used to make one like this when I was a kid, and we really loved it. The only thing she did differently was to use a Bisquick crust instead of graham cracker. It wasn't overly sweet that way. The crust wasn't sweet at all, and it made a delicious contrast to the sweetness of the pudding and strawberry glaze. Thanks for reminding me about one of my favorite summer desserts!
