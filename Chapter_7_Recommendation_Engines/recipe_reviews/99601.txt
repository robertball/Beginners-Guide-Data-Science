Very quick and easy although I did tweek it a bit (of course).  I brushed the asparagus with olive oil and then sprinkled it with a little salt, regular (untoasted) sesame seeds (didn't want to take the time to toast them, I know, busy, busy, busy), and a little lemon juice.  Then I grilled them in a preheated grill over indirect heat.  It took about 4 minutes.  Served this with grilled salmon and grilled potato wedges - awesome!

I used regular sesame seeds instead of black and I toasted them until they were light golden brown.  It was delicious...even my "I don't like asparagus" kid said he would eat it like that again.  I'll make it again for sure.  A small word of advice tho...if you double the recipe (I did, I had two bunches of asparagus)don't double the sesame seeds.  There was so much sesame seeds that most of it was left on the skillet.

We loved the 
end results here. And the cooking instructions were right on for our thin asparagus. What I ended up doing was adding a  bit of sesame oil to further enhance the flavor, and I didn't use black sesame seeds, just the regular ones. Will definitely be looking forward to preparing this  again. Thank you, ZOPOOH.

Very good!  I used sesame oil in place of the olive oil.  Next time I will wait and sprinkle the seeds on once I've plated the asparagus as too many seeds were left in the pan.  Great tho!

I used toasted regular sesame seeds instead of black ones, and they were great. I found the asparagus a bit overdone, and I was afraid to reheat it in the oil for too long because I didn't want it to cook any more so it was also quite cold. Next time I will cook it for 3 minutes so that I can toss it in the oil for longer to heat it up.

This was delicious! I do not like asparagus, but in the interest of cooking healthier food for my family, I tried it. I added a little bit of lemon juice as suggested by one of the reviews.

This was so good and easy. My hubby loved it. I only boiled the asparagus for 3 minutes and it was perfect. I also used sea salt instead of regular - it's healthier and I love the taste. I made this with the "Apple and Orange Chicken" I found on this site and it was an easy, delicious, and healthy meal. One of our faves!

Simple, fresh and really dressed up with the toasted black sesame seeds, with the vivid contrast in color between the bright green and black. I took the easy way out and just microwaved the asparagus for a few minutes until crisp tender. Couldn't be easier!

Nice recipe. I used only 1 TBS of regular sesame seeds, and added 1 TBS of lemon juice to the olive oil.  I sprinkled the sesame seeds over the asparagus on the serving plate since others mentioned many were left in the pan.

These were really tasty. We like our vegies al dente so I only boiled for 3 minutes. They came out perfectly and the sesame seeds gave them a really nice flavor. Thanks!

This was very good, quick and really easy. I used a bunch of thin asparagus and followed the instructions, worked perfect: result was green and crunchy. I used half the sesame seeds (regular ones) as the rest seemed to stay in the pan. I think a bit of sesame oil would help next time for better flavor.

I think this is going to be my "go-to" asparagus recipe from now on.  I didn't have black sesame seeds, so I just used regular but it was wonderful.  I did cut the asparagus into about and inch and a half to two inches before cooking just to make it a bit easier to deal with.

Excellent, I am not fond of asparagus but my husband loves it so I try to make it pretty often and it's rare that I find a recipe I enjoy.  I followed others advice and added a sprinkle of sesame oil and grilled these in a foil pack flipping half way through. Thanks for the recipe:)

I spent my childhood disliking asparagus and only started enjoying it recently.  I used this recipe for my first attempt at asparagus, and it was great!  The only change I made was to add chopped garlic and a few shakes of adobo to the oil.

We grilled the asparagus instead and it tasted great.  As suggested, we saved some of the toasted sesame seeds and sprinkled them on at the end.  It was a little too salty, but other than that it was excellent.

I have made this a few times and sometimes I dont add the sesame seeds. It is wonderful. I told my dad how to make it and he and my mom loved it as well. I would double the stars on this one if I could! Thanks for the recipe Zopooh.

Very good, but a bit too much oil.  I would cut the oil in half next time.  I also used celtic sea salt instead of kosher salt.

Not great tasting asparagus.  I found it too oily and salty.  Next time, I'll try grilling it and adding the sesame seeds at the end.

I make asparagus this way all the time, but by GRILLING it without the sesame seeds.  Toss asparagus with olive oil and kosher salt, then throw on the grill.  When it's done, I sometimes throw some freshly grated parmesan on top.

Loved it. So easy. My fiance is a great cook, and it makes me nervous to cook for him. He loved this, and so did I.

I served this recipe at a dinner party and all my friends loved it. I was worried I made too much but there were no left overs! It was easily the best asparagus I've ever had. I steamed the asparagus in the morning so it only took 5 minutes to cook at dinner, and I used sesame oil and regular sesame seeds. Yum!

I prepared this asparagus by steaming in the microwave with the new steamer bags for veggies.  Cooked for 3 minutes. Asparagus was small and should have cooked for 2 minutes because it was slightly over cooked. I used white sesame seeds upon serving on top of filet mignon for Easter dinner.

Average. I just wasn't very impressed with this recipe. I won't be making it again, though we eat a lot of asparagus and are always keen to experiment with new ways to prepare it.

This was delicious, and I didn't even use asparagus.  Thought I had a bunch in the fridge, but alas there were only green beans.  Looking forward to trying the asparagus, too.

Super easy and very good. I toasted white seeds in a dry pan until just brown adding half to the sauteing asparagus and half sprinkled on the serving bowl. I also added about tsp of sesame oil to the saute.

I love asparagus but I also changed this a bit I washed the asparagus then in a gallon Ziploc bag added two tbs of EVOO pinch of garlic powder and seasame seeds with the asparagus shook them around the bag to evenly coat and not saturate then I layed them on a baking sheet and put in oven til they started to crisp a bit at 350. Sometimes I add a bit of fresh lemon if serving with fish.All in all easy, tasty, vegetable side.

Very good.  I think you could get away with just 1 TBSP. of seeds, though. I opted to steam my asparagus. The black sesame seeds really made it a special dish.
