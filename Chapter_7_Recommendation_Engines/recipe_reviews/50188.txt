This was Very tasty. The only thing I might do differently is next time I think I'll add some jalape√±o or fresh ginger for some zing. :)

I loved this! I used 2 large mangoes, vidalia onion instead of green because that is what I had. Very refreshing, served it with a spicy steak and corn soft taco and black beans and rice. Some of us put it in our taco and some with the rice&beans. Yummy.

This was my first time "cooking" with a mango. I've never really eaten mangos before either. I saw one in the store, and bought it, then I went searching for a recipe. I happened to have everything on hand for this one, and it sounded yummy, so I gave it a try. It was really good! I liked the sweet/savory combination. And, the colors are really pretty. I just wish my picture was better! LOL!

Very Good!!  I used grilled chicken over a tossed salad (with almonds and jalapeno havarti) and put the mango  relish over top. It was light and refreshing, great for a summer bbq!

Absolutely Fantastic! I used this on chicken like suggested but I also placed it on a bed of lettuce and added a light honey vinaigrette. Yum!!

Tastes Delicious!  I used agave nectar instead of honey because that was all I had.  I also added a little bit of ground ginger spice to it.

Wow!  This is a great combination of flavors!  Served with barbecued pork chops on the grill and it was the perfect accompaniment.  Even I liked it, and I'm not usually a sweet salsa fan.

July 2018 - Love this mango salsa. Put over hamburger instead of using a bun.
Adjustment - 
- along with mango, i used a nectarine and a peach
- used red onion instead of scallion
- used parsley instead of cilantro
- did not have a red pepper so skipped it

I used mint instead of the cilantro and served it with grilled pork chops seasoned with soy sauce and Montreal seasoning. Delicious!

OH my goodness.  I had this last night with orange chicken and I was delicious. I used a whole red bell pepper and about five green onions to satisfy our tastes. Totally forgot the oil, however this was awesome!
