I wasn't able to find strawberry juice concentrate. I did find raspberry, so I used that. I also used FF half-n-half and Splenda. It's wonderful as is, even the husband liked it and asked me to make another. I think next time I might omit the water and ice cubes to make the alcohol stand out a little more. Most refreshing on a hot day and quite the treat for a girl who only has a drink every once and a while now. This one's a keeper.

Far too sweet, especially if adding liquor.  Reminded me of a cheap bar drink and the whipped cream was way too much.  My guests all passed on this one for our cocktail mixer.

I am the submitter of this recipe. It is a sweet drink, and it goes down easy. I refer to it as an "adult milkshake" because that's what it reminds me of. I hope you enjoy it!

Nice combination of flavors - be careful, though. It doesn't taste like it has alcohol in it! :)

We made this over Labor Day weekend. I thought the strawberry concentrate was quite tart so added some bar syrup instead of sugar. Just the right amount of sweetness and a very refrishing drink with enough of a difference to make them again!  Thanks for a GREAT Drink, Pam!!

I just joined so I could rate this recipe. I made it several times over the summer and I really liked it. I've even tried it with different fruit combinations and liquors. I keep coming back to this combination. I have never rated a recipe on this site, but I lurk on the Recipe Exchange (buzz?) and came here after I saw a bad review of this recipe. I hope someone else will try it and give it a better rating.

I didn't rate this originally because I didn't follow the recipe exactly - I couldn't find strawberry juice concentrate so I substituted raspberry juice concentrate and I used raspberries instead of strawberries.  We loved it and I have made it that same way a couple of times.  Thanks for a great idea, Pam!

Yum! This makes a great dessert! I used fat free milk instead of heavy cream because that was all I had.
