I made some changes, I used water instead of milk. I let the yeast mixture sit for about 10 minutes. I used less sugar so it won’t be too sweet 2/4 cups instead of 3/4 cups. It turned out great.

I made this as written and it came out great! The whole family loved it especially right from the oven. I kneaded the dough for 10 minutes. I let it rise twice. 2 hours for the first rise and 1 hour for the second rise. Will make again for sure.

I've made these rolls twice. These are very good. I used all purpose flour both times. For kneading, I used the bread hook on my mixer. The dough is incredibly sticky, so a mixer is preferable. The first time, I rolled the dough in Italian bread crumbs. It gave them a more dinner roll flavor. The second time, I used sugar and cinnamon. Both ways were delicious. I followed the advice of other reviewers and had my rolls rise twice (for 2 hours and 1 hour).  I plan on experimenting with other flavors as well. Definitely a good recipe.

Great roll for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Definetly use unsalted butter in place of vegetable oil, however since I love butter, I did use melted butter and VEGE oil in bowl during first rise, instead of a non oiled bowl. I did a 2 hr first rise and a 1 hr 2nd rise. Don't skip the bread crumb part. I used AP flour, instead of bread flour, and rise was good, but next time I have extra bread flour, I'll use and see if changes texture or height because bread flour has more gluten in it.
