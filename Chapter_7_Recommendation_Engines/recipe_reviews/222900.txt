We have a similar cocktail we call an Irish White Russian...instead of cream use Baileys Irish Cream.  Very good!

I did not have kahula. I had happened to go to the store and bought a Mio energy iced mocha java the other day, and thought it might make for a decent white russian when i was considering how to use it. Boy did it ever! 1.5 oz vodka, however much milk you wish to drink,at least 5oz for a small drink, and a squirt of the Mio. Very tasty and you cant taste the liquor, it literally tastes like chocolate milk or one of those monster java drinks. 
I know i modified this quite a bit but i thought i'd throw this review out there as a suggestion, i will probably make my own "recipe" for it at some point because i was looking online to see if anyone had tried this yet...

A bartender told me to add one or two  of drops of vanilla extract - makes it even richer and creamier.

The cream was a little thicker than I expected so I thinned it out with a little bit of milk... Delicious!

Yes I will make this again for sure! I have to say, I used Kissed Caramel Vodka, Kahlua, and instead of the cream I tried Coconut milk. I put the coconut milk in a bullet mixer and it made it all creamy! Boy was this yummy!

Even better with whole milk, rather than heavy cream. Actually, never tried it with heavy cream as I know what it tastes like.

I sub milk for the cream and only use a splash of it. Double up on the liquors. The Dude truly abides after drinking this.
Careful, man, there's a beverage here.

This is a drink recipe that just shouldn’t be messed with. It’s perfect as is, no creativity required.

I've never had a White Russian before, so have nothing to compare it to, but enjoyed this drink.  From the instructions, it looked like you don't mix it up, but I looked at pictures online, and it definitely was mixed up.  - lol  :)

Added a Halloween twist to mine. Really great drink. Can adjust the liquor to be strong or mild.
