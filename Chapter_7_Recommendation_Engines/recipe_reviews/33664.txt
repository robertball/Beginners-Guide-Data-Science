I used a frozen banana in this smoothie and instead of vanilla yogurt, which I did not have, I used nonfat greek yogurt and added some vanilla extract. This was good, though next time I think I'd cut back on the milk and use more yogurt next time.

Yummy.  I went ahead and used a full container of yogurt in this...otherwise, I probably would have let it go to waste.  I gave some to my 4 year old and added a little vanilla ice cream to his.  Good both ways.  Thanks Stefanie.

Absolutely delicious, a perfect concoction!  I used frozen strawberries b/c I was too impatient to let them thaw, and it was icy cold.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Yum!

The flavor on this wasn't as intense as some, but good nonetheless. I used strawberry rather than vanilla yogurt and frozen berries. Texture like a milkshake. Thanks Stefani.

Fantastic recipe! Simple, yet so incredibly good! I used frozen bananas that I had stashed in the freezer along with some frozen strawberries.  I used Stonyfield Farms french vanilla yogurt to round it out and what a perfect smoothie this was.  All I can say is YUM!

This is THE best home-made smoothie I've ever tasted!  To make it vegetarian, I replaced the milk with soymilk and omitted the yogurt entirely... thanks for the great recipe, stefanie!

Great smoothie! I love the combination of strawberries and banana. I froze my fruit and used fat free vanilla greek yogurt and skim milk. I did cut back on the skim milk a bit to get it to the consistency I wanted. This was perfect for a light breakfast that was a breeze to make!

very yummy. I added 2 cubes of ice to make it colder and I added a few extra strawberries and I used strawberry yogurt. But very very good! One of the best smoothies I have ever had.

Good in the sense that it is not too sweet, but a little heavy on banana flavor.

Almost perfect, but as others suggested, I would add some ice cubes. I also would add a little more yogurt and less banana. I enjoyed it with more strawberry than banana.

Hubs appreciated this as a departure from the usual thicker, more boldly flavored smoothies as well as the fact that since less yogurt was used it was less tangy.  I agree.  A nod of approval from me, and I'm not typically a fan of smoothies.

This was very good!  Even my picky 7 year old daughter enjoyed it!  I used 1/2 banana, 1/2 cup milk, whole cup of flavored yogurt, and 3 frozen strawberries.  I omitted the honey.  Creamy, smooth, and not too sweet!

I have to agree with Chelsea and spoiled.  Made as it, this is pretty bland.  I noticed half the people leaving 4-5 made some changes that would really make a difference and are not really this recipe.  Noticeably using a whole container of yogurt, or a flavored yogurt, adding more berries, cutting the milk in half, all of which I think would make a big difference in the amount of flavor.  And there was barely any flavor at all.

This was very good! My first try at making a smoothie. I had already bought vanilla yogurt so I added half milk and half yogurt. The strawberries that I bought were sweetened so I left out the honey.  My final recipe, which everyone LOVED was, 1/3c yogurt, 1/3c milk, 1/3c frozen sweetened strawberries, 1/3 of a banana and 4 ice cubes. That made 1 large glass. Awesome!

This was a yummy and refreshing breakfast treat. I used soymilk vs. milk, plain yogurt vs. vanilla, and I added some flaxseed and spinach. My dad and I both thought it was very good. The only thing I would probably change next time(there will be a next time) is to add more strawberries. Thanks for this great recipe!!

I made this exactly as stated and it was very bland. It doesn't taste like anything.  You can barely taste the strawberries, so like other reviewers I would add more.  I might eliminate the honey altogether since it didn't seem to add anything to this.  I did the full cup of milk and tablespoon of yogurt, which made it high protein, but it wasn't tasty.

Tasty, light, and refreshing. I used frozen strawberries and a few more than called for. I also skipped the honey and it was plenty sweet for my tastes. Thanks :)

Following the recipe exactly this is not a very good smoothie at all.  It is not cold, and does not have a good flavor.  I saved it by adding a LOT more strawberries, 4oz of vanilla yogurt, 3/4c crushed ice and some sugar.  Without the changes, it is warm and bland.

This is a really good smoothie!! I don't usually drink milk, so I was skeptical. But I love this! Definately a good way to get me to drink milk! I will be making this quite often I'm sure! Thanks for sharing!

This is a great smoothie!  I have it almost every morning for breakfast.  I just added more strawberries so I could taste more of the strawberries and a little less banana.  And I don't care for honey, so I just left that out. Love it!!

I used a frozen mixed berry blend rather than strawberries, froze the banana, and used a frozen yogurt ice cream rather than the regular yogurt(and a cup instead of a tablespoon). It was great!

So creamy and delicious! I added more yogurt and more honey just to make it sweeter and creamier. oh and more strawberries because the banana flavor was a bit strong for me. Well looking at my modifications I could have just cut down on the banana..

This is a good smoothie but needs some alterations.  I think all good smoothies require some ice in them if you really want a smoothie consistency.  I stock up on bananas and then freeze them  because I find that frozen bananas help the consistency of smoothies as well.  (TIP: the longer your bananas brown the sweeter they will be so wait until they start spotting a bit before you use them.)  I find that honey and sugar are optional in these sort of smoothie recipes, (personal taste,) but I can never go without some real vanilla!  Great recipe though.

I tried this recipe but add soy whey protein and a little less milk, and was pretty good. The taste wasn't as powerful as some other smoothies I have made but the consistency was really nice.

This had good flavor and taste, but it was on the thin side.  We enjoy smoothies a little thicker than this recipe.  I will make this again, only using 1/2 cup milk and some ice cubes in place of the other 1/2 cup of milk.

Yum!  I used about 6 frozen strawberries, and about 3 tbs of yogurt & 1 tbs of honey.  Very creamy & delicious.  The best part was that I had all the ingredients on hand, so I didn't need to run to the store for a thing.

very tasy smoothie. I found that I needed to add a little more strawberries with a handful of ice cubes to make it suit my tastes. I did add just a little more honey. very good for a morning start.

It was very good with some modifications i've made. I added more ice and 1 table spoon of Vanilla syrup. It was very refreshing in the hot summer day.

It was a good smoothie that will allow for lots of variation, but following the exact recipe won't give you anything special. I used soymilk and I also added 3 ice cubes and a little bit of peanut butter after tasting the final product.

This is a no brainer smoothie recipe.  Only had bananas on hand, just used that.  Didn't measure anything except the milk, added the vanilla yogurt & honey without measuring.  Tasted after blending and thought it could be colder.  Added crushed ice and blended again, came out great!

This recipe was very good, but not WONDERFUL.  I (like most raters) changed a bit.  I used 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup plain yogart,1 tbls honey, 1 cup frozen strawberries and one small banana.

this was ok, having read the reviews afterwards I would have made some changes. I used a whole banana and some frozen strawberries.
 A little on the bland side, could've used some apple or blueberries, and i would have taken out the milk entirely and used the rest of the french vanilla yogurt i had.  Otherwise very good!

Simple and easy to make.  I cut and froze our ripe bananas. Also froze the strawberries so that it has that "shake" texture.  I omitted the honey since I have a kid less than 2y.o.  Although, without the honey, it was a little bitter. So, I added 1 tsp. sugar to sweeten it up a little.  I will definitely make this at least 3x week.

This is a great base for almost any fruit smoothie drink. It is fantastic as is, but if you are feeding to a toddler under age 2 be sure to leave out the honey. I gave it to my 22 month old and he loved it. I plan to make it again and even sneak in a carrot for some sweetness and nutrition.

This recipe was average to me.  I did not read the suggestions from others until after I made the recipe and I wish I would have done so prior.  I would have added either frozen strawberries or ice cubes and reduced the amount of banana by half.  Otherwise, it was easy to make and tasted ok.

This is my favorite smoothie combo-strawberry/banana.(a handful of fresh blueberries are great in it too)  I leave out the milk and use an entire small container of vanilla yogurt. I also add 10 whole almonds for some healthy fat.  Very good for the health conscience.

We used half a banana (instead of whole). Gave it enough of a banana flavor. Cut the milk down to 1/2 cup vanilla soy milk, and used 1/2 cup vanilla ice cream instead of the yogurt. Yummy.

This was ok, but I wasn't overly impressed.  It turned out very foamy which wasn't something I was expecting. I will probably try it again, but with a change from milk to soy milk.  Perhaps that will make a difference.

I use Skim milk, replace the yogurt with a splash of OJ (cuz I think milk and than yogurt is a little redundant), use about half a pint of strawberries and it turns out much better. If you follow the recipe you can barely taste the strawberries witch makes me sad face. tear.

I thought this had a good flavor, however it was more like a slightly thick strawberry flavored milk than a smoothie to me. I also used frozen strawberries to. I did kind of think it would be somewhat thin, as it is a lot of milk for a smoothie. I might save it for when my neice and nephew visit, as it is natural and much healthier than strawberry or chocolate flavored powders they like in milk.

I actually like this recipe better without the honey.  I also added ice like some of the reviewers suggested and used only half a banana.  Next time, I think I'll use the whole banana because I couldn't really taste the banana that much.  I also used almost 1 cup of vanilla yogurt.  Yummy!

We were not impressed.  Banana overpowers the taste of this.  I added some vanilla to make it taste better.  I didn't like that it was very milky.  I like to have a little frozen, so I added some ice in hopes that would help, but we still didn't feel this was one of the better ones.  Oh well!

Very strong Banana taste.  Not bad, but not as fruity as we expected.  You could hardly taste the strawberries, although the color looked good.

Its really good, but I changed a few things so thats why it got 4 stars. I added many more strawberries, about 2 tsp splenda (in addition to honey), a dash of vanilla, and about 5 ice cubes. I also used 4 oz. strawberry-vanilla yogurt. My 4-yr-old thought it was a strawberry banana milkshake and actually ate breakfast!

This was a fantastic recipe!  I made it as said the first time. The second time I got creative and added more strawberries (I used 6 frozen strawberries) and decreased milk to 3/4 cup (I actually tried my vanilla soy milk), and added 1 extra tablespoon of yogurt.  Delic!

Wow, that is a taste smoothie.  The only changes I made were a whole container of strawberry yogurt and some ice.  I just recently have gotten into making smoothies for breakfast and I could definitely eat this every day, thanks for the submission.

Incredibly yummy!  Of course, all of us that rate these recipes have to go and change it, but at least it may help others out with the same "taste".  I used 1 tsp. sugar as I had no honey on hand, and for the yogurt I used strawberry.  To cut calories, I used half cup 1% milk and half cup cold water.  The consistency was still very thick and lovely.  I also used frozen strawberries and bananas so this may have contributed to the great consistency.

I changed the recipe slightly.  I froze all my fruit for a more slushy consistency.  I only used a 2 inch piece of banana and 5 large strawberries.  I also pitted 5 black cherries I had laying around and froze them.  I used a heaping tablespoon of cherry yogurt and lactose free milk.  My daughter and I LOVED it!

This is the best place for recipe ideas. I had similar ingredients and this recipe was a great inspiration for my own smoothie. Definitely more of a milkshake texture- nice and creamy smooth.

I was desperate to use some spotty bananas before I was forced to make banana bread and found this recipe.  I threw it all together with lemon yogurt (that's what I had) and it's excellant!  A healthy drink and one I hope my fussy son likes.

Delicious.  One of my favorite combinations for smoothies is banana/strawberry.  This does not disappoint in my opinion.

I REALLY liked this smoothie and served it too a bunch of people at a family get together but I thought it was very plain so I changed a couple of the measurments and ingredients:
1/2 a handful of strawberries
1 handful of blueberries
1 1/2 tablespoons of honey
2 large scoops of frozen yogourt
1/2 a cup of milk
1 banana
You should try this recipe!

This was heavenly! I froze the banana and strawberries and instead of vanilla yogurt I used Guava Yogurt (I'm part Hispanic so in my house there is mostly latina based foods)Anywhich way it was sooooo delish!!! =)

I used unsweetened almond milk, which tasted great in this. The only thing I would do is use a frozen banana next time. My strawberries were rather large, and this had a nice combo of both tastes.
