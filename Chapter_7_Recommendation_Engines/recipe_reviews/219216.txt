I some additional spices to this (1 tsp Italian Seasoning and an extra clove of Garlic, crushed).  Also, you can double the sauce portion and serve over pasta.

This is better than one would think. I have made it this way but  I prefer to make this with the diced tomatoes with green chiles and use Cheddar cheese. I sub Sazon for the basil and add extra garlic and onion, or salsa to it. If making it by the recipe, add a spoon of sugar or extra salt and pepper as Hunts tends to have a tinny taste.

Delicious!  I did follow another review and added a pinch of sugar and some italian seasoning.  We love garlic and basil so I was a little heavier handed than the recipe called for.  I only had shredded mozzarella so I added a little grated parmegiana and grated provolone to spice up the cheese.  All in all it was quick, easy, tasty and only used one pan!

so good!  i chose not to use the tomatoe sauce, and just topped the chicken with the diced tomatoes and seasonings instead.  if i were serving with pasta, it would be good to add the sauce as well.  i served with rice and broccoli and it was very tasty.  even the kdis enjoyed it!

Perfect for something nice 'n fancy, yet easy to make! Was worried chix wouldn't cook rightat 20-minute, so cooked a full 30; it came out perfect. Left just enough sauce to glaze the bottom of the plate and the crunched-up croutons soaked in the sauce making it delectible. Served with a loose leaf lettuce salad.

Yummy and so Easy! I made this one a Whim one night and was really impressed by how easy it was to make. I like Chicken Parmigna, but it is really labor intesive and has lots of fat, and makes Tons of dishes. So I think this Will be my dish in place of it.  I made one a few changes, since I didn't have diced tomatoes, I used stewed and diced them up a bit. I also sprinkled with Italian seasoning, just gave it more flavor.

I agree with other ratings: As it is, this is a 4-star recipe. To make it a 5-star recipe, increase the fresh basil quantity to 1 oz, lightly season chicken after pounding it but before pressing tomato mixture into it (combine 1 tsp herbs de province, 1 tsp tarragon, 1/4 tsp black pepper and up to 1/4 tsp kosher salt in a small glass dish then rub 1/2 tsp of this spice blend on both sides of each chicken breast), and add up to 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes to tomato sauce mixture. If you can't find small croutons, place large croutons in ziplock-bag and crumble by pounding a few times. Pounding is always fun  :-)

I wasn't able to follow the recipe exactly, I used a can of seasoned stewed tomatoes(with basil) since I only have HUGE cans of diced and no fresh basil on hand. But flattening out the chicken and cooking it in the garlic seasoned tomato sauce, simple perfection. Flattening the meat really helps it to soak up the tomato flavor and it stays tender(it has no choice!). As is, it is kind of like an unfried chicken parm...who doesn't like that??

 I'd say you could add in whatever veggies you'd like on top and other herbs for flavor. I was thinking I could make it an easy stove top caccitore by adding in bell peppers, onion and mushrooms and serving it over pasta.

This recipe was absolutely  wonderful and easy to make.
I baked my chicken @ 350 for 20 minutes because  I wanted the tomatoes to  be undisturbed . It was delicious .Will make again.
