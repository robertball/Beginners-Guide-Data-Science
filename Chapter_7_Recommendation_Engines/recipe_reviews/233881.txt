I can't believe how delicious these are!  It was my first time trying bison, and I definitely plan to make these again.  So good!  Also tried it with ranch dressing, cheddar cheese (and extra dry ranch added to the top).  Yum!

I made these Bison Roll-Ups for my family, and when I went shopping for the crescent rolls I noticed they made big ones, so that's what I bought, and I'm glad I did.  The bison dogs from High Plains are big and juicy, and they fit perfectly inside the big rolls.  I used Tillamook mild cheddar cheese just because I'm a fan of the brand, and I thought the bison dogs deserved something special.  I loved the addition of the cornmeal on the top and bottom also.  I didn't add the mayo to the honey mustard, but instead combined yellow mustard and honey-I tried some with the mayo, and my family wasn't a fan, neither was I.  The bison meat was rich, and I couldn't finish but half of one dog.  My 5 year old grandson only finished 3 bites, even though he loved them.  We aren't used to bison, and even though they were good, they were very, very rich.  Would I make them again?  Of course!  We all got a kick out of eating bison instead of beef for a change-maybe I would serve them with a light salad next time.  Only 4 stars because of the dressing and cheese in the original recipe.
