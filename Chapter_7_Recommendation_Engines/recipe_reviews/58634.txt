This sauce was quite tasty on Gnocchi I.  To begin any white sauce, I always cook the butter with the flour for a few minutes to eliminate that floury taste sometimes associated with white sauces, then add the liquid.  This sauce thickened a bit more than I wanted, so I thinned it with a splash of white wine.  Also, I didn't use measure the peppercorns, just used a few good turns of the pepper mill.  Omitted the nutmeg, but used cayenne instead.  Very good with freshly grated Parm... thanks!

I liked the taste of this--flavorful, but mild. I'd suggest using only 1 Tbsp of flour, since the sauce DOES get rather thick, and pepper instead of peppercorns, since I don't like eating them or picking them out. I sprinkled chicken with lemon pepper seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder, and baked it in the oven ahead of time, then cut up and put in the sauce after it was done. I served over penne.

This recipe is fabulous and easy.  It is a great garlic base that leaves plenty of room for experimentation.  I agree that it asks for way too much peppercorn, I only add about 1/3-1/2, and in my opinion that flavor can be added at the table.  I have tried this dish several different ways: firstly, marinade some chicken breasts in Italian dressing and grill, then dice and toss into the pasta (I like to use angel hair) serve with bread, a salad and a nice wine and you have a great date meal.  I have also stirred in chopped or whole grilled shrimp, or served it on the side with shrimp scampi as well as steak.  For a low fat alternative, I use 2% milk and light cheeses.  Just be creative and have fun with it!

Delicious. Cheated and used jarred roasted garlic as a timesaver. Also used heavy cream.

This is superb. Roasting the garlic is key. I usually double the recipe. Also, I cook the flour and butter together first. Very creamy and flavorful.

I used this sauce to re-create a dish that I love at a local Italian recipe.  I did not roast the garlic, but added less.  I also added only 1 Tablespoon of flour.  Finally, I used fresh ground pepper instead of the peppercorns.  I put the sauce over sauteed chicken, artichoke hearts, sauteed spinach and tomato.  I put in about 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese at the end.  I served it over gnocchi.  It was delicious!

What a delicious sauce! I didn't have any nutmeg, but it still turned out wonderful. I served it over linguine with some Cajun grilled chicken. A very versatile sauce...next time we'll try it with salmon.

I'm only giving it 3 stars cause if you follow the recipe it doesn't thicken untill it's cooled and it didn't have alot of garlic flavor and the pepper flavor was non existent, but with a few changes it makes a good sauce

Definitely rich.  But while I love spicy sauces, I thought this called for way too much peppercorn and not enough salt.

I love this recipe.  The only thing I do different is, I don't add the the nutmeg.  Instead, I add some crushed red pepper for a little heat.  YUM!

Got many compliments on this sauce. The only thing I didn't use was the nutmeg because I didnt have any on hand. I also added a little spicy seasoning to give it a kick! It was delicious! I used it as a meat topping sauce to top some deer back strap.... yum!

THANK YOU for sharing this recipe!!! So simple and o-so awesome!!! 

I modified it slightly, as I didn't have a whole head of garlic to roast. I sauteed 4-5 big gloves in butter, then added the rest of the ingredients to the sauteed garlic: 2 T butter, flour whisked in milk, pepper and salt, until thick. 

I tossed the sauce with rotini pasta and roasted veggies: cauliflower, carrots, zucchini, onion and garlic, and LOVED the results!!!!

Thank you, again, for sharing! This will definitely be my "go to" white sauce recipe!!! xxoo Jen

This sauce was very, very good. I made it with pasta and hot Italian sausage. The only change I would make to the recipe is to significantly reduce the amount of peppercorns, to at least a teaspoon. I love pepper and stuff that's made spicy with black pepper, but in this sauce it completely overpowers the garlic. So, if you want to taste the garlic in your Garlic Peppercorn Sauce, I would be very sparing with the peppercorns, or maybe even use a small amount of freshly-ground black pepper. Other than that, we enjoyed it!

We liked it and will make it again. I added parmesean cheese to half of it to see if we liked that addition. We liked it a little better with the parm added.

I was disappointed after all the work, it's a very "average garlic sauce".  Even more upset after it got such good reviews.  Normally I would give this a 3 star, but because it's rated so highly and it's just so mediocre, I rated it a 1 star, hoping to make it's score more accurate.  Don't get your hopes up!

I thought this recipes was okay.  Ther is a thin line between the perfect amount and too much nutmeg and too much ruins it.  I don't know if I will make this again.

Ok well I dont like pepper but i wanted a good garlic sauce recipe. I omitted the peppercorn and it was excellent! I was so impressed. My fiance commented on it right away and asked what it was. I hadnt told him I made it from scratch. I was tired of always making Alfredo. Lovely change.

Very good sauce.  I accidentally added too much garlic, and my wife thought there was too much pepper (she doesn't really like pepper), but my kids ate everything I gave them, though they didn't ask for seconds.

This turned into a thick, goopy, milky flavourless mess.  I have no idea how it's managed to get 4 stars, but it's lucky to get one from us.  Nothing could save this recipe (we added a really nice white wine as others suggested) but the end result just tasted like milky roasted garlic.  The only other thing worth mentioning is that it may serve 4 people (as the recipe says) as a side dish, but definitely not as a main dish.  Needless to say, we won't be making it again.

This recipe was good.  As mentioned by other reviewers, cook the butter and flour together first, then add milk.  I found that 1 head of garlic only yielded a slight garlic flavor. Next time, I will roast 2 heads and try that.  My husband who is typically not a fan of cream sauces liked this because of the heat from the peppercorns (I added extra to satisfy him).  The kids did not like this recipe.

We used this sauce in a broccoli and chicken rice dish and used pre-canned minced garlic instead of roasting a head of garlic.  It was very strong in garlic flavor but was great for our dish.  With the fat free milk it was a quick and healthy option to cream of chicken soup  for this rice dish.

LOVED this recipe. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is because I made it with 1/2 lb of whole wheat pasta and only 2 servings of the sauce. I probably need more and the pasta absorbed a lot of the sauce. It was not as flavorful as I had hoped. It was so easy and tasted great in the pan, so I'm trying it again tonight!

Definitely worth the little effort required!

This sauce is delicious!  I don't know who says it lacks flavor because the garlic is intense.  Perfect over linguine with shrimp or chicken.

I've had this in my recipe box forever and finally got to making it. Really, it tasted like any other alfredo sauce. I guess I had it ramped up in my head that it would be just a little more. Still good, but not sure if I'll make again as it didn't wow anyone.

I bet this is excellent if you follow the recipe.  Personally, I fried the garlic for quickness and burnt it by mistake, then I didn't measure my milk and had to add more flour, then I forgot to add the salt.  I'm not a very good cook.  But it tasted pretty nice anyway, so I will definitely try it again.

This recipe was easy and tasted great! I am currently very conscious about my fat and calorie intake so I used fat free milk. With all the flavor from the garlic, I didn't even taste the difference!

This is a great sauce that tastes like it includes much cream but doesn't! I agree with others who say there is WAY too much pepper- I cracked about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of colored pepper into it and it still had kick. I grilled peppers and served them with pasta, topped with this sauce. Not light enough for every day eating but very good, especially with the roasted garlic.

Yummy. The sauce was wonderful. I doubled the recipe & jarred it to be reheated later in the week. I also saved time by using jar roasted garlic. And like another review the first recipe I tried it on was the blackened salmon. But unfortunately the salmon over powered the flavor of the sauce. Later in the week I served the sauce over grilled chicken breasts seasoned only w/ salt, pepper & rosemary paired it with a simple cheese tortellini and a caesar salad. There were no leftovers!

I was very pleased with how this came out. I added 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese and one decent sized chicken breast that was grilled and chopped up. It went great on top of linguine. I will do this one again!

Mine also turned out a bit thick but it got rave reviews from the whole house.  I added more garlic to ours (we love garlic).  Served over angel hair pasta with chicken and a side of garlic toast.  It was fantastic.

This turned out great for us.  Like another reviewer I also always add my flour to the butter first.  I didn't have nutmeg so omitted and used ground pepper.  Mixed in shrimp and poured over fettucine noodles.  Yummy.  Thanks for the post.  Served witht the Cheddar Bay Biscuits from this site.

Very yummy.  I did add some water at the end so the sauce wasn't so thick, I'll increase the milk to about 2 cups next time.  I used garlic pepper instead of cracked pepper and a bit of garlic salt.  This is so much better than the box noodles and I would think a bit healthier if you used lite or ff marg and skim milk and whole grain pasta.

Lessened the pepper...cooked the butter w/the flour first to omit that "cardboard" taste and used more milk, based on reviews...still way too spicy and glutenous a sauce.  Sorry.

Very good pasta sauce, next time we would use 2 teaspoons of ground pepper rather than a table spoon and I would recommend roasting a LARGE garlic bulb, as the garlic taste can be overpowered by the pepper. We added it to linguine with chicken and brocolli....delicious!

Made this last night topped with asiago cheese and some delicious crustini's. I found the sauce a bit bland and would have liked to of added shrimp and some bacon. A good recipe to learn a sauce from.

Very nice sauce and easy to make. It was quite thick even though I took some reviewer's advices and reduced the flour to 1Tbsp. I also thinned it out by adding 1/2 cup of water and 3 tsp. of white wine. Still very thick. Next time will try to reduce to 1/2Tbsp of flour.

Was very good, although a bit bland, I added some grated asiago at the end and that really kicked it up a notch! Was certainly not too garlicky, don't think the nutmeg made much difference either. End result very tasty and less fat than cream!

This sauce was very good however i think i would prefer it with a little less garlic. I used ground black pepper to taste instead of peppercorns and served it over Chicken Katsu from this site. It was delicious however next time i will use less garlic.

I made this to serve with Famous Butter Chicken from this site. The roasted garlic blended beautifully into the white sauce and I used whole green soft peppercorns. The flavour was delicate & worked well with the chicken.

I loved this sauce. I made some changes because I did not have enough time to roast the garlic. Instead, I minced about five cloves and sauted it in the butter before adding in the milk/flour.
I would also use less pepper. I added cooked penne and sauted chicken tenders. YUM!

Way too much pepper! I would half the amount of peppercorns used. We used the exact amount, 1 tablespoon, and found it almost too strong to eat. Otherwise, it was great and very easy!

Absolutely scrumptious! Those of you that found this recipe too thick should measure your ingredients very carefully and you will get a perfect smooth, pouring consistency. For example, fill the tablespoon witrh the flour anf cut the surplus off the top with a knife.
 I poured it into a casserole containing jumbo chicken legs, that I had grilled to brown them and melt off the surplus fat. I then baked it at regulo 4 for an hour. I served it with steamed new potatoes, roast whole tomatoes, roast butternut squash, and minted garden peas.

It is just "okay."  It would be better if the author would have recommended adding something else in...such as chicken or shrimp.  Not a "WOW" sauce by itself with pasta.  Definitely worth trying if you're going to vary it up quite a bit.  I agree with most others-quite thick.    Maybe it's to hide the chunkiness of the garlic???

Very creamy and very spicy. I used less than the suggested amount of ground peppercorn, and it was still a touch too heated. But there was lots of soothing creamy sweetness from the garlic, and with the right amount of peppercorn this could be a five star sauce.

Good sauce- nice flavour, easy to make. However, while the sauce looked deliciously creamy as I was pouring it on the pasta, as it cooled it did become very gummy, as other people mentioned. By the time I was finishing my meal, the pasta was one big (tasty) coagulated lump. I will make this sauce again, but next time I'll try using less flour.

I thought this was kind of bland - I don't know how, since it had plenty of garlic and peppercorns in it, and I added a decent amount of parmesean cheese too. I might make it again, but it's not going to go into heavy rotation.

Mild sauce, nice flavor. Goes well with many different dishes. I used it over turkey and whole grain couscous.

This had a good flavor, but it took a lot longer than 5 minutes to thincken.  But it was just the right amount of bite from the pepper and the garlic flavor was amazing.  Maybe I need to use a bit more flour, because it turned out a bit runny.  I just tossed it with some shrimp and noodles though, and it tasted wonderful.

Delicious sauce, made it last night. Added some extra spices to give the sauce a bit more bite.
