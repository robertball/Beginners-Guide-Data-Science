I was looking for a very simular recipe and came across this one. After reading some of the other reviews, I came up with some alterations that turned out just as the recipe I was looking for. Instead of melting the marshmallows in with the chocolate, I mixed them in with the cereal. I only used 4 cups marshmallows, and 6 cups cereal. This way, the chocolate mixture was coating the cereal and marshmallows together. Everyone loved them.

I have been making these since I was a kid. I use 6 cups Golden Grahams and 4 cups marshmellows. Once the marshmellows and chocolate have melted, I pour in 4 cups of the golden Grahams and stir and mix well. Then I pour in the additional 2 cups golden Grahams, 1/4 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup mini marshmellows. This way the last part of the cereal tastes a bit crunchy as it is not drowned in the chocolate and the marshmellows and chocolate chips do not melt for an added flavor. YUMMY! Always a hit camping!

I thought this recipe was terrible.  Once the marshmallow/chocolate mixture melted, it hardened way too fast to get it mixed in with the cereal.  I went straight from the stove to the bowl and it had hardened before I could get it mixed in.  
I also didn't care for the flavor or texture very much.

This is awesome and every time I make them for friends, family or work they disappear instantly and the compliments roll in.  For such a simple thing people go crazy!  Don't go overboard w/ adding extra c.chips b/c the bars will be too limp to cut.  Also fine to do in microwave - just microwave the mmallows/chips/butter/c.syrup a few minutes at a time (I do total of about 3min.)until smooth, then I stir in 1tsp. vanilla and the cereal.  Rave reviews!!

I tried this without the corn syrup, and I liked it a lot better... I also added about a cup of marshmallows to throw in with the cereal so they stay whole and chewy. A really delicious recipe! (and EASY)

A very gooey treat!  I used to make these for sorority rush and it was just as easy to make enough for 400 people as it was for 5.  These remind me of rice krispi treats-they are so easy to make but everyone thinks you slaved over them.  DELICIOUS!

This is a quick and easy recipe...and very tasty!  I love chewy bars and this fits the bill.  For those of you who had problems, I would recommend melting the chocolate mixture in the microwave.  It will turn out much softer and easier to stir into the golden graham cereal.  The only reason I can think of why the mixture would harden so fast is that it's being cooked too long or too high.  If making on stovetop, try using a candy thermometer.  I also added 1 tsp. vanilla to melted mixture and then stirred in one cup mini marshmallows after I stirred the chocolate/cereal mixture up a bit.

with a few modifications this was exactly what I was looking for.
1) I melted 2c chocolate over a double boiler until just melted.
2) I mixed the marshmallows in with the cereal.

It was perfect and tasted great.

I had followed jersies review, and i'm now kind of mad that i did. She said to reduce the marshmallow mixture to 4 cups and increase golden grahms to 6 cups. i followed her advice but it didnt turn out that great. My mixture was too dry for the amount of cereal. So I made it again. And it turned out perfect the 2nd time, my way. so here's how it should be: 3 or 4 T butter, 6 cups golden grahms, 6 cups marshmallows, 1/4 cup corn syrup, 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips. Melt butter on low, add 5 cups marshmallows and corn syrup and melt completely, add chocolate to melted marshmallows stir, remove from heat, quickly stir in 6 cups cereal and remaining 1 cup marshmallows. press in 9x9 (i use square pan for thicker bars) sprinkle w/ 1/4 cup extra mini chips if desired. chill then cut into squares!

Maybe it's all the real s'mores I've been eating this summer, but I thought these were a real disappointment.  The choco/mallow mixture turned into a bland and greasy taffy.  It would have been much better to leave some chocolate chips and marshmallows to mix in at the last minute.

These are good, but almost anything sweet is okay.  They are extremely chewy.  They do not however taste like smores.  They taste exactly like the ingredients...Golden Graham cereal covered in marshmallows and chocolate.  For me, when it's smores I'm craving, substitutions just don't match up to that long time tradition by a campfire.  These bars are still a good treat though.

Tastes pretty good, but got a blister on my finger from stirring the mixture into the cereal!  I added some uncooked marshmallows, chocolate chips and grahams at the end for additional flavor and texture.

We really loved these s'mores. i made the mistake of following other reviews and used 6 cups of graham cereal, and 4 of the marshmallows.  There was too much cereal and not enough of the chocolate mixture to hold it all together.  We weren't even able to cut them into bars.  Next time i will still mix the chocolate mixture into the cereal and marshmallows, but will use 4 cups of each instead!!

This was my inspiration for a new specialty! Goldfish s'mores! I make this with the graham cracker goldfish all of the time. You can even skip out on the corn syrup, just make sure your pan is sufficiently greased, or these are a bit of a pain.

Delicious!!  I followed others' advice and mixed the marshmellows in with the cereal.  I did had to add a 1/2 extra chocolate to coat the mixture.  It hasn't cooled completely yet and I don't know if my family will leave it alone long enough.  Very good recipe.

This is exactly the recipe that I have been looking for!  I did not use that corn syrup at all or use any substitute.  I double the butter and used 2 cups of chocolate chips and an entire bag of mini marshmallows.  I read in some other reviews that other cooks had trouble with the mixture getting hard to quickly...so instead of mixing the butter, marshmallows and chocolate chips in a small sauce pan I used a 2 qt sauce pan and poured the cereal into the sauce pan while it was still on the stove.  It mixed great with enough room to stir the mixture.  I then poured it into my pan.  Great recipe!

Modified: prepared more like rice krispies treats. Melted butter and then melted marshmallows. Stirred in cereal with marshmallows. Once mixed, added chocolate chips (I used semi-sweet to balance the sweetness of the cereal & marshmallows). Pressed mixture into greased 9x13" pan. (8x8 could also be used to make thicker bars). Omitted corn syrup.

I've been making this since I learned it in 6th grade home ec.  Usually we've poured it into a big glob and eaten it that way - not even bothering for it to cool.  Yum!

After reading reviews claiming the mallow/chocolate mixture set too quickly, I made sure not to overheat it (as that was what people claimed the issue was). Almost as soon as I added the chocolate, the mixture began to set. It was nearly impossible to get it mixed thoroughly. I ended up with chocolate everywhere and most of it stuck to the bowl. I also found that there was a lot more chocolate mixture than grahams. I think maybe 6cups of grahams would be better - provided you can get the mixture through an extra 2 cups of cereal before it sets. Although it was a pain in the butt to make, it does taste delicious.

My mom has made these for us for years, but instead of melting everything, she just melts the chocolate with some butter and uses mini marshmallows and mixes them with the golden grahams stirring in the melted chocolate.

Not liking this recipe too much.  It is really sweet and too gooey, needs more cereal.  It reminds me of a tootie roll in flavor.  I like the crunch of a real smore, def needs more cereal.  My kids, 5 and 3, wouldn't eat it.  Not great.

This recipe is terrible - the ratios are backwards and the texture of the finished product is , and doesn't even fill the 9x13 pan. Amazing that you could screw up an easy treat this bad.

These are a quick and delicious treat.  I took them in to my nursing class and let me tell all you guys out there.  A class full of women plus a man with a tasty chocolate treat = gold mine!  Enjoy.

Addictive and delicious.  I recommend for a more authentic s'mores experience to not melt the chocolate chips.  Once the corn syrup and marshmallows are melted and smooth, remove it from the heat, and add it to the bowl with the graham cereal.  While mixing, add in the chocolate chips.

This tastes great!  The only thing I did differently was to add half the mmallows to the cereal and melt half with the chocolate.  The chocolate mixture was still warm enough to make the unmelted ones gooey and chewy and add white swirls to the bars.  The only thing I might do differently is add a bit more cereal next time.  I couldn't taste the "graham cracker" enough, but still delicious!

I/We loved this recipe my kids thought i was crazy when i described what i had made at work with the seniors!!This isn't the exact recipe but it tasted the same!!I too had a hard time mixing it up -it was really tough ..I only had reg sized marshmellows-so i actually chopped a few to put in at the end of melting,i on;y added the chocolate after removing from the stove-since it melted instantly...next time i will add (6cups)more cereal i found we had too much gooey(if that's possible LOL)mine look exactly like the photo !!!soooo good but i feel the reviews helped me soo much!!

I've been making a close variation of this recipe for a few years -- I can barley control myself when they're around!  The key difference is the marshmallows...I add fewer, but add them just after the melted chocolate is mixed into the cereal. That way the marshmallows stay mostly in tact, yet melt slightly against the hot chocolate.  The result is hitting additive little pockets of marshmallow when biting into the squares!  Love them!  Kids adore them too..."kids" of all ages!   I've never tried making them without the corn syrup, but after reading one of the reviews here, I might try it -- to help curb my guilt a bit!  I also add a bit of vanilla to the chocolate/syrup/butter mix after it's heated.  Oh, after a day or so, they lose a little of their crisp freshness.

I gave this recipe a three because of the difficulty in making it.  The marshmallow mixture is VERY thick and it begins to set as soon as you take it off the stove.  After a couple stirs it was nearly impossible to mix the marshmallows into the cereal.  I also had a hard time getting everything pressed into a pan - it was more like heaped into the pan.  The mixture is just too sticky to do much of anything with.  On the bright side, it tastes great.  Not really like a s'more, but good in its own right.

These were so fun to eat!  The mixture was quite sticky, but my arms got a workout while I stirred the ingredients together.  They were a hit at my camping trip!

We used the graham cereal that comes in a bag for this and we've made it several times- it's YUMMY!  It's a little messy, but definitely woth the taste!

I followed the recipe and it hardened up on the cereal so fast I couldn't stir decent or get it all out of the bowl.

I was really looking for a smore's experience, but this didn't do it for me.  The chocolate/marshmallow mixture set up too quickly so it did not coat the cereal evenly.  Then the cereal became soggy.  I let it sit overnight and it did firm back up, but the honey grahams were no longer crisp.  Also the chocolate flavor overpowers the graham and marshmallow flavors.  I believe next time I would simply spread the graham crackers on a baking sheet, sprinkle lightly with mini chocolate chips and melt in the oven on a low temp for a few minutes.  Then after the chocolate sets up I would toss in mini marshmallows.

This recipe is all wrong! It was like trying to speed a big chocolate marshmallow over cereal. I don't think the marshmallows a suppose to be melted into the chocolate. I made something similar when I was younger and it was always a hit - this recipe was a waste of ingredients!

Very good!  I was out of corn syrup and I'm glad I was since I thought they were very sweet w/o it.  I kept out some of the marshmellows and chocolate chips like other posters said, and stirred them with the cereal and melted mixture in my Thatsa bowl to coat it well before pressing into pan.  After sitting out a few hours they were not sticking together so I put them in the fridge and boy are they good!

I followed another reviewer's advice and used 6c graham cereal and four cups of marshmallows and got fantastic results! They are really messy and you have to eat them with a fork, but they are really sweet and gooey, and you can't stop eating them! They were really easy too--I used the microwave and got them made in about 10 minutes. My son and husband loved them, and I did too. Thanks for sharing.

A nice variation on ye olde cereal bar recipes.  We were even able to make these bars a dairy-free treat for our allergic sons by using semi-sweet chocolate chips and dairy-free margarine.  I added some extra mini marshmallows to the final mixture.  Highly recommend these for harvest parties and bonfires!

My friend had this secret recipe for DELICIOUS smore bars and I finally found it!!  These bars are the best and SO easy to make!  Everytime I make them, not only do they disappear before the night is over and everyone asks for the recipe.  Thanks!

Awesome! My husband and son love these s'mores bars. I add crushed cereal and mini marshmallows on top. This lets people know what's inside the bars and also makes them more fun, I think!

If your mixture hardened too fast, you probably cooked it rather than heating it just to melting. I think this is better made the day before and given a chance to set up well. Then it is fudgy but not gooey.

Way too gooey and rich.  I've had these bars made from a different recipe and they were SO much better and tasted much more like a regular s'more.  The recipe is easy to follow and quick to make though.

I made these today with my students for cooking class. They were a huge hit. Students and teachers absolutely loved them!!!
