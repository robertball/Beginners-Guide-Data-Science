I had some leftover grilled steak to use up so what better than steak and eggs.  I used some chopped vidalia onion and left out the mushrooms.  I used real eggs and added some cheddar cheese.  Great with toast and juice!

This was exactly what I was looking for, including the egg substitute. I added a little Italian seasoning and and basil for the herbs. I served with orange marmalade spread on toast for a little sweetness to balance the savory and orange juice. Will make again and again!

Yum!  Had leftover sirloin from French Dip sandwiches last night and this was a wonderful way to use the meat.  I used 4 eggs, no mushrooms (hubby doesn't like them) and a cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  Will make this again!
