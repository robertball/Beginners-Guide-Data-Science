Omg!  This marinade is SOOO good!!!  The only change I made was due to what I had on hand; no hot pepper sauce, so I subbed crushed red pepper flakes and a little of Emeril's Southwest Seasoning.  (The chipotle sour cream was a little tart for me- I think next time I would cut down on the lime juice, or maybe leave it out altogether, but that is just personal preference.)
Thanks mabcat!!  This definitely stays in rotation!  :)

p.s. After looking at a few recipes for fish tacos, I made just the corn salsa from 'Fiery Fish Tacos with Crunchy Corn Salsa', also on this site.  It was FANTASTIC with this fish!  You could even make the tilapia fillets with the corn salsa on the side (not as tacos) and that would be a wonderful entree.

This is really good...BUT!!! I would just like to add a word of caution. The first time I made this I accidently bought chipotle peppers in adobo sauce rather than just the adobo sauce.  I picked out the peppers and followed the recipe as written and holy cow it was hot! Too hot and I love really spicy food. I ended up adding a lot more sour cream to calm it down.  The 2nd time I made it I used the same sauce but strained out the seeds after picking out the pepper and it was perfect.  NOT kid friendly due to the spice/heat, but will definitely make again & pass on the recipe to others! Thanks!

Great Recipe, I followed the suggestion of others and omitted the adobe sauce.  I only marinaded the fish for an hour and then I baked it at 350 for 15 minutes in the marinade.  For garnish I used diced tomato, onion, cilantro, and shredded cabbage  - yummm.  For a side dish I made rice with black beans.  Can't wait to make this wonderful.

The marinade was great. I increased the cumin to 1 tsp, honey to 2 tsp, and lime juice to 3 tbsp. I cooked the fish in a pan instead of the grill, for convenience. Instead of making the dressing, I boiled the marinade down to a thick sauce and drizzled this over the tacos with baby greens, tomatoes, cilantro, and avocado. Very tasty!!

The marinade gets 5 stars... it's fantastic! Overall though, I gave this a 4 because the tilapia, in my opinion, is just too delicate of a fish to stand up to this recipe. Next time I'll use haddock fillets, or a similar fish sliced in thicker fillets.

I love fish tacos and have made them many times before, but wanted some ideas on a few variations so I went hunting. The marinade and sauce look very promising here and sound delicious, but I do have to question the need to cut up the fish PRIOR to grilling (I never have and never will)? Leaving it whole makes it MUCH easier for grilling, cuts out a little work and the marinade would still impart good flavor because fish is a meat which absorbs flavors very easily (and 9 minutes seems like a very long time to cook for cutting it into smaller pieces). There really is no need to cut it up prior. Leave it whole, grill it for the same amount of time and flake it into bite size chunks when assembling the tacos. They will be just as delicious and you will cut out a few steps making this an even easier recipe! :)

These are amazing. We have been looking for good fish taco's since moving from California, and this  beats all the restaurants in town by far. The sauce is very hot though, and we reduced the chili powder & chipotle en adobo to our taste.

The only reason this got 4 stars instead of five is because the sauce isn't very good. It had a very strong lime taste that overwhelmed everything else.

Not bad.... I think I liked this more than my hubs did tho (but that's the norm in my house lol!). My hubs and I both LOVE fish tacos. I've tried many grilled and battered (i.e. fried) recipes on here, but none have been to our liking. This was by FAR the best of the bunch, but is in need of some minor tweaking to better suit our tastes. For one, the sauce is WAAAY too spicy (holy socks!) and heavy for such a delicate fish. It would be much better if it were considerably toned down and paired with a meatier fish - maybe halibut or marlin. Now, onto the positives. :) The marinade is simply fantastic! I could have eaten the fish on it's own, it was that good. The sauce was also good, but again, it was REALLY spicy. All I could taste was adobo  which is a shame because the spices and lime didn't have a chance to shine thru. I recommend HALVING the adobo to start and adjust to your liking from there. NOTE: You need to cut your tilapia into chunks BEFORE grilling (if you don't, your filets will flake), but by doing so, it makes it nearly impossible to prevent from falling thru the grates of your grill. My husband found a simple solution. Reynolds Wrap sells a product made specifically for grilling. Alternatively, you can use a special grill pan if you have one. Topped with shredded coleslaw mix, fresh pico and Mexican-blend cheese. Spanish rice and tortilla chips were great no-fuss accompainments. Frozen margaritas helped cool our burning mouths ha! Thanks for sharing, mbcat! :-)

Loved the marinade. Didn't like the dressing. Had to bake in the oven because it's winter now but really enjoyed the flavor of the fish. I let it marinate overnight.

This was tasty. I marinated this overnite but wish the fish had more of the marinade flavor. I think next time I'll increase the spices up. I did cut back on the chipolte in the topping because I knew the amount in the recipe was too much for me.

Great!  We never had tilapia before, but will definately have it again.  It was a little delicate to handle, but the marinade made it so good!  I may try another reviewer's suggestion to bake it next time.  The dressing was great even though I didn't put in the adobo.  I added some Franks extra hot sauce instead.  Next time I will use the adobo since we like things very hot.  The baby greens someone suggested instead of the cabbage sounds really good too.  I can't wait to make these again, it's a great light meal!

My husband and I both really like this recipe and have made it a few times. We now make it with a simple flour/salt/pepper/seafood seasoning mix as breading, then fry it. (I know it's not as healthy but the breading is our favorite part of fish tacos!)

I had a hard time finding the adobo sauce until I realized it was in a little can of chipotle peppers in the Mexican Foods section of the supermarket. I drain the adobo sauce off, then freeze the chipotle peppers in a freezer bag for later use in different recipes. Make sure to strain the seeds out of the adobo sauce unless you like it REALLY hot!

As another reviewer suggested, an easy healthy modification is to replace the light sour cream with plain Greek yogurt. I always have some on hand anyway and tried it upon reading the review. Delicious - great idea!

Excellent recipe! These were easy to put together, and tasted great. I cut back a bit on the adobo sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe ingredients for the marinade and dressing exactly. I only marinated the fish for about 30 minutes - in 6-8 hours it would be ceviche. The sauce had a mild heat that was just a bit smoky, and the lime gave it a bright note. (Note: Don't make the dressing ahead of time, because after a few hours, it becomes "soured" and bitter - probably the combination of acid from the limes and the sour cream.) I served it on doubled warm corn tortillas, with a little chopped white onion, cabbage and cilantro on top. With pico de gallo and black beans, these made a lovely meal. Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely fabulous! I went ahead and baked the fish, since it was so delicate, but it turned out great. I have also just used store bought chipolte mayo (instead of the dressing recipe here), premade coleslaw mix, and pico de gallo from the produce section of the supermarket. That cuts some of the work down, especially if you are trying to make a quick weeknight dinner!

Delicious! I stayed as close to the recipe as possible, but did not have the adobo sauce (too expensive in my area). Added a little honey to the sauce, per the reviews. Garnished as written using tomatoes, cabbage, and lime (no cilantro). I recommend using the smaller tortillas and eating two small instead of one large. Yummy, 5 stars.

100 stars!!  I have FOUND my fish taco recipe!  I did use corn tortillas and could not use the adobo sauce because the rest of my family doesn't like spicy.  Instead, I used a tsp of smoked paprika for the smoky flavor in the sauce.  Fish tacos are my favorite food and now I can make GREAT ones at home!  Next time, I think I'll try mahi-mahi.  Wonderful recipe!!

This marinade is sooo good! My husband and his father are both fisherman, so we used monkfish, as it is what they had just cought, and it turned out fantastic! Now everytime we get a monkfish, we make fish tacos! I make two batches of the marinade, one for marinading the fish, and the other I use as a dressing for bagged coleslaw. We changed up the dressing a little too after trying another recipe on this site. I do half a cup of plain yogurt, half a cup of mayo, 1 lime juiced, minced jalapeno, 1tbs minced capers, half tsp each of oregono, cumin, dill weed, and cayenne pepper. This is definately a family favorite now, and blows away any fish tacos we've ever had at restaurants!

made this twice now, once marinating the fish without chopping into chunks first, the second time I chopped in into chunks and marinated it all day - definitely the way to go!  much more favorable.  I agree it is hard to cook the fish on the BBQ when it is in chunks but worth the work around, even if you do in the oven.

also toned down the amount of chipotle in the the dressing the second time around, I put two whole chipotle's plus juice the first time to bring it up to 1/4 cup and it was way too much.

Can't wait to try this with some homemade salsa or corn relish!  Hubby even suggested we have one fish taco night a week now :)

Very good. Like some of the others, I baked the fish. For the dressing I used a 7 oz container of plain greek  yogurt, 1 tbl. of the Adobo sauce, (because of other reviews that said the dressing was way too hot, can't imagine what it tastes like with 1/2 cup) juice of half a lime (probably 1 Tbl) and the other ingredients same measurements.  I served it with bagged coleslaw and sliced avocados. Next time I will try it with grouper. A keeper.

I used cod with the skin on since it was the same price as the tilapia and I knew it would hold together better on the grill. And rather than cubing it we just let it flake itself after taking it off the grill. I marinated it for 4 hours. As for the sauce, I took other people’s advice and started with only a tiny bit of the adobo sauce, adding to it gradually, especially since mine had been frozen so I wasn’t sure of its potency. I ended up splitting the sauce into two batches and only used about 1 tbs adobo in the mild batch and added a 2nd tbs into the other, and that was about a medium. I think next time I’ll cut the sour cream in half since I’m not a big fan of the sour taste. I used a make-your-own approach when serving so I used more toppings than listed: chopped cabbage, slices of jalapeño, slivers of tomatillo, halves of cherry tomatoes, chopped cilantro, slices of avocado, lime wedges, diced red onion and my own recipe for guacamole (I’ll probably post that later). Everyone raved about the fish by itself as well as the overall taco. It was a huge hit. I will definitely make these again, but it was pretty time, and labor, intensive so I have to keep that in mind. But still 5 stars.

This recipe is sooooo delicious. We were craving REAL fish tacos (southern Cali style!) and these hit the spot!!! I would have given it a five, except I have made a couple KEY alterations: 1) substitute sour cream with Fat Free Plain Greek yougurt - it's 0 fat, but is much creamier than low fat or fat free sour cream. Less calories and a LOT more protein. 2) Made my own corn tortillas - SO EASY, and SOOOOO worth it. Store bought corn tortillas cannot compare. Just buy Corn Masa in the Mexican food section of your grocery. Mix with water and throw on a iron skillet for a quick minute each side. These really make the meal. We love the maranade and the sauce though - we have this AT LEAST once a week and have impressed our friends - and even my personal trainer! (But the Greek Yogurt is key there!) Try it, you won't be disappointed!!!

Excellent marinade AND dressing. I make this dressing (using less adobo sauce, or chipotle powder to taste most times) and mix it INTO the cabbage with the cilantro as a sort of slaw. Many of us find it so delicious that I serve the slaw itself with Mexican meals! Next I am going to try the marinated fish alone with a cilantro chimichurri and rice!

We love this recipe.  However we just bake the fish for 350 for 15 min. in the marinade.  Plus you can adjust the amount of adobo sauce to your liking (we typically use 1/4 cup).  Thanks!!

5 Stars for the marinade but 3 for the dressing.  I read the first 20 reviews before preparing.  Made everything exactly per recipe so I could give a valid review.   The fish was tasty and moist but the dressing was lacking flavor and sour.  Not wanting to waste the sauce I added 2 teaspoons honey and upped all of the seasonings to taste.  My husband couldn't quit commenting on how great everything was.  The honey made all the difference!!

A*M*A*Z*I*N*G fish tacos.  I had a serious craving for fish tacos (definitely not the first thing I want when craving something,) and these more than delivered.  I marinated in a large ziplock and then removed from the marinade and baked, covered at 450 F for 10 minutes rather than grill them  (I'll try grilling come summer.)   The only change I made was using chipotle chile powder in the marinade (so omitted hot sauce,) because I didn't have regular chile powder, and hot chile powder in the sauce (so skipped pepper and didn't think it needed salt, so skipped that, too).   As per other reviewers, I only used just under 1/4 cup of liquid (just the liquid)  from the chipotle peppers and I'm glad I did.  Initially I thought had I ruined the sauce.  But letting the flavours marry for six hours (as long as I let the fish marinate) "corrected" the taste and it turned out lovely.  I think that is the secret to this sauce.  You just can't make it right before serving the fish.  It'll be too sour (from the lime) and adob-o-ish. These were spicy but in my subjective opinion, not crazy spicy.  Maybe because I topped them  with a fresh tomato/avocado salsa (3 large tomatoes diced, 2 avocados diced, 1/2 red onion finely chopped, 1 small red chile, seeded and minced, juice of 1 lime, 1 tbsp white wine vinegar, 1 small bunch cilantro chopped) mix and marinate for a few hours.  Everything together = OM*G.  Especially so with a lime margarita.  :0)  Thank you, thank you, Mabcat!

Loved this! I followed the marinade recipe exactly, and it was delicious! I would love this on salmon. I adjusted the sour cream sauce a little; I eliminated the adobo sauce, added a little hot sauce, and a tsp of key lime honey. Instead of the suggested toppings, I used lettuce, cheese, homemade guacamole. I heated my nonstick grill pan, and I added the tilapia chunks. Making sure the pan was nice and hot ensured the fish cooked quickly and didn't fall apart.  I used entirely fresh ingredients, and it made this the perfect recipe for an end of the summer dinner. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was delightful and a nice change of pace from beef tacos. We didn't have adobo sauce on hand, but we used chipolte Tabasco Sauce and it was fantastic! We also used Dover sole instead. Very flexible recipe; however, very time intensive.

My husband loved these and I liked them.  The sauce was so spicy (and I didn't add the full 1/2 c. of adobo) and I thought it overtook the whole dish.  That was all you could taste when you ate the tacos.  Next time I will use this marinade but look for a different sauce.  I will also add avocado to these!

Like others have said, the marinade is excellent.  The sauce was incredibly hot, and I didn't even use a full 1/2 cup of the adobo sauce.  I would use maybe 2 tablespoons next time.  I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream.

I modified this quite a bit.  I baked some frozen tortilla encrusted talapia and put it in skillet warmed tortillas.  Made the sauce pretty much as is but left out the chili powder and old bay but used chipotle Tabasco sauce because I didn't have adobo.  Filled the tacos with fish, cilantro, slaw, the sauce and a few capers.  Good meal and very simple with little clean up. A mom's dream.

LOVE these.  Thus far I have made this recipe with grouper, mahi mahi and cod (not a tilapia fan).  The marinade I make as written.  The dressing, I omit the chipotle (too spicy for the family) but if you love super spicy, go for it.  I also soft fry corn tortillas to a bend, drain well, serve with cabbage, shredded carrots, tomatoes, avocados and the dressing.  MY.KIDS.LOVE.THESE.

Loved this. I omitted the chipotle because not everyone in our family is a fan. Also I fried the grilled marinated fish in corn tortillas for a crisp taco. The flavor was fantastic! Thanks for sharing!

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I followed the marinade according to directions, but only marinated an hour in the fridge then baked 20 min at 350 in the same covered baking dish I used for marinating--less dishes!!! For the sauce, I cut way back on the lime and on the adobo per others' reviews.  I used the juice of two limes (no zest) and about 1/8 c. of adobo sauce from a can of chipotle peppers.  It gave PLENTY of flavor.   I love adobo sauce, but depending on my mood, you could eliminate it altogether and have a completely different dish, no less delicious, where the flavor focus is the marinated fish rather than the sauce.  Regardless, a wonderful recipe no matter how you slice it!

The fish and marinade were tasty.  Well received!  Even better as a leftover.  However, as a fish taco connoisseur, I must say I was not blown away by the taste.  Next time I make these, I will add more lime and more jalapeno and probably skip the Old Bay, as it didn't contribute much but saltiness.

This is a fantastic recipe; my family loved it.  I didn't have adobo sauce, so I used salsa and extra chipotle pepper flakes; also added extra honey to the dressing.
Thanks for sharing!

So far, I have only partially made this recipe, but I absolutely loved it.  I had the fish marinating (I used red snapper instead of tilapia) then during the day, some friends called and invited us to a BBQ...they already had a ton of food, so I decided to just bring the marinaded filets to toss on the grill and eat as-is.  They were so flavorful after 6 hrs. of soaking!  Can't wait to try the whole taco w/ the chipotle cream.

I SO wanted to love these fish tacos... but they were just ok. The lime and adobo just kind of overpowered everything. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of reducing the amount of adobo sauce in the sour cream dressing. Oh, and  I used plain yogurt in place of some of the sour cream (I wanted to save the rest of my sour cream for cheesecake!). These tacos were good, just not stellar. My daughter wouldn't eat them and my spousal equivalent agreed that they're not quite what we were looking for.

I found this to be a decent recipe with a reasonable mix of flavors, even if it was a bit complicated to make with that long list of ingredients.  There are, however, a few things I would do differently... (1) use far less Tabasco in the marinade, perhaps just a few drops. (It was too hot to taste the fish!) (2) Cut back the lime in the marinade, it was a bit overbearing. (3) The sour cream/adobo sauce definitely made the dish, but be aware that smoky adobo sauce can vary from medium to very hot so taste before you dump 1/2 cup of the stuff into your sour cream. Add enough to suit your personal taste. (4) I only marinated for 30 minutes. Fish absorbs flavors quickly and several hours would literally 'cook' the fish in the acid and we'd have ceviche!

These were fantastic! I used maple syrup instead of honey, cajun seasoning instead of old bay and a good dose of chipotle pepper alongside cayenne. I'm a little worried I won't be able to replicate cos I didn't really measure closely!

I didn't like the sauce. Maybe something was wrong with the adobo sauce I bought because with adding a 1/2 cup the sauce ended up being the consistency of peanut butter and dark. I wasn't crazy about the adobo flavor with fish. I tried adding a lot more sour cream, but it just wasn't helping.

***** 5 Stars for the Marinade. The Toppings complement each other very well, again 5 Stars. The Sauce is what brings everything together. I got scared and graciously bowed reading the reviews. However, I have used chipotles and adobo sauce in marinates for skirt steaks that I use for fajitas. It gives great flavor and a little bit of heat to dishes. It is a very strong ingredient to use, and a little or a lot may vary with each individuals taste preference. I am going to try your sauce because everything else was spot on! I used tilapia, grouper, mahi, mahi (the fish so good they named it twice), cod, snapper, shrimp, and halibut to see what fish I liked better with your marinade. They were all good, and I thought the mahi mahi is an outstanding fish with or without the marinade. The tilapia absorbed the most flavors of your marinade into the fish among the fish I used, so the tilapia was my favorite choice for flavor from your marinade. The shrimp I used also absorbed a great amount of flavor from your marinade. 
  The Sauce I used was the following ingredients: 
½ cup plain yogurt -½ cup Mayonnaise- 1 lime -juice squeezed- 1 Jalapeno pepper minced (deseeded) -1 teaspoon minced Capers -½ teaspoon dried Oregano- ½ teaspoon ground Cumin –
1 teaspoon dried Dill Weed-  ¾ teaspoon ground Cayenne Pepper
Mix all the ingredients together and use for a fish taco sauce.

Let me start by saying this marinade is perfect for the fish. I have made it a few times, with Wahoo and Mahi Mahi- both were fabulous. The only change I made was to use Chef Merito's Fajita Seasoning instead of the Old Bay. I used Tapatio for the hot sauce. I leave my fish fillets whole and grill them whole. Then it's easy to flake it apart and use it for the tacos as you need it. I usually marinade about 4-5 hrs.
Now for the sauce, I can't believe it calls for 1/2 cup of adobo, that's insane. I made the sauce using about 1-1/2 tablespoons of the adobo and it was pretty spicy. It was tasty but I thought it made a better dip for my tortilla chips than on my tacos. The flavor of the chipotle overpowers everything and upsets the delicate balance of ingredients. We use my husband's recipe for white sauce -- 1/2 cup sour cream,1/2 cup Greek plain yogurt, 2 tablespoons lime juice, 3 cloves grated garlic and a handful of freshly chopped cilantro. Simple and light, it compliments the taco better in our opinions. 
I served the fish tacos with white sauce, homeade fresh salsa and shredded green cabbage on warmed corn tortillas with lime wedges. 
Thank you for the perfect fish marinade for the tacos!

Fantastic! We love grilled fish tacos and these were as good as anything in a restaurant. I bake the fish in the oven rather than grilling. Warning: the adobo is very spicy! Start with less...taste and add to the sour cream to your preferred spice level. I used about a third of the recommended adobo (I guess we are spice wimps!).

These were really good. I even got my non fish eating husband to agree! Tons of flavor and I added some sweet grilled corn to complete this delicious and fresh meal!

The marinade was excellent and so was my grilled  halibut. However, the sauce is another story. The flavor reminded me a bit of key lime pie filling gone horribly wrong. The lime zest is too much. Having said that, it did spark some ideas of my own and for that, I thank you. :o)

The whole family, which includes my man who doesn't really like fish, loved it!  It's even been requested for dinner again tomorrow!

I used Alaskan Pollock and added fresh onions to the marinade...mmm

These were delishious... The only change I made was to add a blackened seasoning to the fillets that I cut into strips before marinating...then baked in the oven at 425 or about 13-15 min.  I used fresh pico for the topping.  Labor intensive but worth it for the out of this world favors.  Will make again.

This is my first time ever having fish tacos. I loved the chipotle-lime dressing. I made the marinade and dressing in the morning so it had all day for flavors to blend. I followed everything to a tee, except I didn't have chipotle sauce, just canned peppers in sauce, so I just minced up the peppers for our taste, one pepper and a tablespoon of sauce was plenty of heat for us...no way could you put 1/2 cup of those in there. We did grill the fish on the gas grill and it was very good, the marinade adds wonderful flavoring. My son who has had fish tacos, said these were the best fish tacos he has ever eaten.

Made this for my in-laws from San Diego. They said it was the best fish taco they've ever tasted. Definitely a keeper. Didn't have any Old Bay, so googled it and tried to throw together whatever I had similar.

Absolutely amazing!  We love spice so the dressing was spot on for us.  We did mix the cabbage and dressing together and it was perfect for us.  We used cod for the fish, grilled whole and then "chunked" it.  Thanks so much for sharing - this has definitely made our monthly menu rotation!

Wow and wow.  This is the best fish taco recipe ever!!!!  I didn't have old bay so added taco seasoning instead.  Also that sour cream sauce is worth the recipe alone.  Will be adding this to my taco rotation.

Okay, I just used the Chipotle-Lime Dressing recipe and I have to say, hands-down this is the best chipotle sauce for fish tacos I've ever had. I'm even disappointed when I order in a restaurant. I've not found anything to compare to it. Love it! My friends were over for dinner and raved about the dressing. If I could give this 6 stars I would. It's that wonderful!

This was perfect as is!  I was hesitant to use Old Bay, but it blended in and added to the flavor, it did not stand out on its own.  This is my new go-to recipe for fish tacos.

I used Swai instead of Talipia. Same type of fish  more economical and a little less delicate. I loved the marinade, didn't care for the sauce. The adobe overpowered the fish and marinade. I think a cucumber sauce similar to a tzatiki would be better then add some fresh jalapeno's for the heat

4-star rating for the dressing!  I followed exactly but used a few drops of hot sauce and a few drops of liquid smoke instead of using adobe/chipotle sauce.  We cheated and baked our fish (did not use this marinade recipe), but topped with shredded red cabbage, shredded carrots, black bean and corn salsa, and the dressing!  Very tasty!

The marinade was great.  I'll definitely use it for fish tacos again.  The chipotle-lime dressing was just okay.  I felt like it was missing something to really take it up to the next level.  Maybe a hint of sweetness.

Sorry since everyone else seemed to love this but the marinade was incredibly bland!!! I marinated my tilapia for 24 hours and the fish had no flavor!  Also, as per other reviewers the sauce is very hot...

At first, I thought that fish tacos would not be very good (did not sound appealing).  But we went to a little hole in the wall place in Fort Collins were they had this exact dish.  I tried it and it has become a family favorite.  I was so glad when I found this recipe.  Thanks!

YUM! I have been trying out fish taco recipes on the hunt for the perfect non-fried fish tacos for a while now and this is it!  The marinade is amazing!  I used to get fish tacos at Z-Tejas and they had a hint of sweetness to them which I loved.  These have that same hint of sweetness.  I inadvertently bought catfish instead of tilapia, but it worked great.  I marinated for 3 hours because that's all the time I had. It was too cold to grill, so I baked them in the marinade at 350 for 20 minutes.  The white sauce: I omitted the adobo altogether because I am not a fan.  I used 1 Tbsp. Lime juice and a little tequila.  I also added a little garlic powder.  I served the tacos with shredded cabbage, sliced avocado and fresh salsa.  It was a HUGE hit!

These came out delicious!!!  I loved the marinade... used Tilapia, and marinated it all day... grilled it on the gril on aluminum foil (which was a good idea because the Tilapia is so delicate it falls apart...  My 4 star rating is because the recipe called for 1/2 c adobo sauce from chipoltes.  What I bought was a can of Goya chipolte peppers in adobo sauce... thank goodness I tasted it first!  I used about 1 tbsp of the sauce and it was plenty hot for me and my boyfriend... any more would have made it inedible I think!  Otherwise, great recipe and I'll definitely make it again...

Let me start off by saying that the entire time I was eating this, I couldn't stop saying "oh my god this is sooo good!"  It was amazing.  We didn't deviate from the recipe much.  Left out the adobo chipotle stuff because we didn't know what it was, and added a tablespoon or two of Cholula hot sauce instead.  It had the perfect amount of spice.  Also, we thought about substituting the lime for lemon juice (since that's what we had on hand), but I'm very glad we didn't because the lime flavor added a lot to the recipe!  I did leave out the cilantro because I can't stand it.  We only marinated for twenty minutes (instead of six hours, whew!) and it turned out perfectly!  It was so good we even uploaded a picture of it, since this recipe definitely deserves a picture.  =)

SERIOUSLY - the best GRILLED fish tacos ive ever had!!! obviously, everything is better fried, but this recipe is GREAT!! i Taste tested a little piece of fish prior to assembling tacos and told hubby WOW THESE ARE AMAZING and he goes "are you sure you wanna talk up these tacos and set a high standard??" and then he tried them and he was blown away too.  GREAT GREAT recipe!! Only fish taco recipe I'll use.  Glad I read reviews - only used 1/4 chipotle adobo sauce (not the chipotles) as that was spicy enough and didn't add full lime in either marinade or sauce.  i cant thank you enough for this amazing recipe.  first attempt at fish tacos - and it was a homerun! No need to search for another.
PS - i used frozen swai from sams club, and that worked out perfectly!!

Very good.  Followed the marinade and instructions exactly.  Followed other reviewers' suggestions and cut down on the lime and adobo sauce in the dressing, so we used 1/2 TBSP of lime juice, no lime zest, and 1TBSP of the adobe sauce and that was just the right amount.  The rest of the dressing ingredients were the same, except we used a plain greek yogurt container (only 5.3 oz) instead of sour cream. We used corn tortillas and had cheddar cheese and cabbage mix as toppings for the fish.

This was a spectacular recipe! We chopped the fish and marinated it, then baked it in a foil-lined glass pan and covered with foil as well. That marinade is by far the most amazing one I've ever had with fish. It would be great on shrimp or mahi mahi too! We didn't try the dressing, but I will definitely do so next time.

Delicious marinade for the fish.  We grilled/smoked the fish.  I did make one substitution because of what i had on hand ... used Ranch dressing in place of sour cream,  which tasted great.

amazing! for the dressing - i used 2 whole limes & zest and put in the food processor bx my chipotles were a bit chunky.
i also used more chipotles than called for and it was hot! but it was great! i used regular sour cream instead of light, i think next time i will just use plain yogurt. i don't like tilapia so i used cod. i don't think one lb of fish cuts it for more than 2 people so i bought a bit more...next time, i'll buy even more as we barely had enough. i bought already cut up slaw mix and mixed my dressing into it...i made my own salsa with the cilantro, tomatoes, jalapeno, onion and lime juice.
i used small flour tortillas and we had 3 each.
there were no complaints!
thanks so much for sharing this recipe! this is a keeper!

Making this again.  My family LOVED it.  Used yogurt instead of sour cream for the sauce.  Also didn't have any adobo, but it stilled turned out yummy.  My son made fresh pico de gallo with cherry tomatoes from our garden.  Yum!!

Loved this. I omitted the lime juice and lime zest since I didn't have any handy and substituted cajun seasoning for Old Bay and freshly caught crappie for the tilapia. I also baked the fish as suggested. Can serve with remoulade or a creamy chipotle sauce.

I loved both the marinade and the sauce... but not together.  I followed the marinade recipe very closely only subbing white balsamic for distilled vinegar.  I marinaded flounder fillets for about 12 hours and grilled using tin foil on the outdoor gas grill.  AMAZING...would enjoy the fish plain served over rice as well.  For the sauce, I only used 1/4 C adobo sauce and it was still very spicy and bold.  When I used the sauce on the tacos, the over powered everything else and it was all I could taste - which isn't what I wanted to with good fish fillets!  The next day, however, I used the sauce with leftovers (frozen fish stick tacos) and enjoyed it very much as I didn't want to taste the fish sticks as much.

Great except id substitute a wild mahi mahi or similar fish. Tilapia is a tasteless farm raised fish full of chemicals from the extensive farm raising that occurs. Virtually no nutritional value

I  only changed 2 things:  I used cod as my fish and exchanged the sour cream for Greek yogurt.  Delicious and extremely low fat and healthy!  

I will try this with shrimp next time.  The marinade just "spoke" to me and said shrimp would be divine!

As others have stated the marinade is great. For the sauce I mixed 1/8 cup to 8 ounces of sour cream with lime juice and spices according to the recipe. I use the sauce to create a slaw to top the tacos. I mix shredded cabbage, thinly sliced jicama, and black beans and mix in the sauce about 30 minutes before serving to give all the flavors a chance to blend. This adds so much flavor, texture and color to the tacos.I served these tonight at a large family dinner and got rave reviews. I always use rock fish for the tacos, it is a little more substantial and a firmer fish than tilapia. It holds up better in the tacos with larger flakes.

The marinade for this recipe is excellent.  I would rate that at five stars.  I have used it multiple times on several different types of fish.  I have used it for fish tacos, but also just for plain old fish.  The dressing, however, turned out terrible the one time I made it.  I did not serve it and definitely will not repeat.  Thanks for the great marinade recipe, though!!!

I have not tasted these tacos, but the process reads as an extremely complicated ritual for such a down to earth stuff. No wonder the time to readiness is calculated at over six (6) hours!!!  :-)

I had trouble finding adobo. We live in the boondocks so I substituted and it was a real mess. I thought the marinade was ok for the fish but felt like the marinade and dressing were so similar that it was overkill. wish i had read the comments before cooking this because some people had some useful tips!

Quick and easy prep.  Cut the recipe for the Adobo/Chipotle sauce in half otherwise you'll have a ton of leftover topping.  Also reduced the Chipotle/Adobo in half - previous experience and personal taste told me that it would be overpowering and a bit too zippy for our tastes.  Definately will make it again

Made this for the family I Nanny for, because they love fish tacos and I needed a good recipe. They loved these and asked for them again. It has a lot of ingredients but most are things that I always have on hand.

Very tasty and not too difficult.  The sauce was super super spicy so I had to add extra Greek yogurt (used instead of sour cream).

LOVE these tacos. The first time I made these I followed the recipe and used tilapia. The second time I used shrimp and they were just as delicious! I topped them off with chunks of avocado. The marinade is fantastic! The shrimp were a little easier to grill than the tilapia was and it helped to put them on skewers.

I tried this recipe last night using cod steaks rather than the tilapia.  My husband and I both LOVED IT.  Thanks so much for a truly tasty fish taco without the frying.  I did cut back quite a bit on the adobo sauce; 1/2 cup would not be edible for me.

This has become a staple in our house.  I cut the adobe sauce due to the heat, but it is soo good.  I use the extra sauce on lots of things.  Sandwiches to steak.  I use these even for company and everyone I've ever made them for rave.  I use mahi mahi as the fish.   AWESOME!!!!!!!!

The marinade is soooo good! Salt and pepper the fish first. Had to add lots of salt after it was cooked. Served with rice, beans and corn

Totally awesome fish tacos, and easy to put together the night before. Do watch the level of adobo sauce in the sauce, though. We LOVE spicy food and thought the ratio was almost too hot. I'll scale back the next time I make it. It is important to go to the trouble of zesting the limes, though - it's key to the luscious flavor in the fish and sauce. I haven't tried it yet, but I think this marinade would be wonderful on chicken!

Made the marinade and dressing Just as in the recipe, but only marinated about two hours and used catfish. Dressed broccoli slaw with some of the dressing and drizzled a bit more over the top with an additional squeeze of lime juice. Very, very good...probably my favorite of the many fish taco recipes I've tried.

This recipe rocks! I've made it twice once in the oven and the second on my stove top. I didn't get to marinade it for the full 6-8 hrs. but it didn't matter, it tasted awesome, this is better than the fish tacos I've had in restaurants, they could use this recipe! The only change I made to the ingredients was in the dressing didn't have the adobo sauce so used Louisiana hot sauce. I also cut it down to 1/4 cup and oh my it was still really spicy, can't imagine the heat with adobo sauce and using a half cup, you have to like insane heat to use the full amount called out, I loved it though. Will definitely be making this often. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Great! I made the marinade as written except to add red pepper flakes for the hot sauce.  For the dressing, I used only light sour cream, 1/2 tsp Old Bay and 1/2 tsp chili/lime Tajin Clasico seasoning.  I baked it the first time and grilled it the next.  The grill is MUCH better.  Even my 11 yo liked this.  A new favorite at my house.

This recipe is very good. I have used it twice. The first time I did not have sour cream for the dressing so I used light mayo. I also didn't not have any adobe so I added about 1- 1/2 tsp Tabasco sauce and tumeric (to taste) The turmeric gives it a slightly smokey flavor. I also used coriander instead of cumin (I like both). I followed the remaining recipe as is. Very delicious and super easy.  The second time I followed the recipe as is. I think I liked my version somewhat better. Also another good topping is roasted corn :)

These were fantastic! I made them for my husband who loves fish tacos and has been asking for me to make them. Highly recommend. I baked the Tilapia instead of grilling. I have a feeling grilled would be awesome just didn't have time to start the grill. However, they were still super tasty!

WOW! This has to be one of the most rocking fish taco recipe ever! I made it to 9 servings for my family of 4 and barely had any leftovers! I used 1/4 tsp of cumin and 1/4 tsp chili powder since the youngest doesn't like spicy stuff. Otherwise, I followed the marinade exactly. Delicious. Will make this again. :)

This was delicious!!!!! My dad and I (I'm 10) made a menu for my mom for the christmas vacation. Tonight was Fish Tacos! My dad uses Old El Paso taco seasoning, cumin, lime zest, lime juice, sour cream, Old bay, and chili powder for the dressing/sauce. Though use  half the lime juice it calls for. We used Mahi Mahi but it was boney and didn't taste quite as good as FRESH Mahi Mahi. My uncle makes fish tacos and uses the same (enough)  sauce. According to my mom they are the best tacos in the world! My dad has some competition!

SO GOOD! I made these with some fresh tuna steaks. We had a ton of the sour cream sauce left over though. I would double the marinade and meat to match the sauce.

Delicious!  I only marinaded my fish for about 3 hours.  That dressing is FANTASTIC!  I did cut way back on it though.  I usually like sweeter sauces on fish tacos so I didn't think I would like it but it was SO good!  We loved it!

I have been looking for a good fish taco recipe, one like the restaurants serve, and this was pretty close!  The marinade was wonderful!  I used white wine vinegar instead of regular, just to give it a little more flavor.  I must admit, the dressing sounded extremely spicy, so I used Thousand Island dressing instead (believe it or not, a lot of the restaurants use it!).  I used *red* cabbage instead of green and left off the tomatoes (again, both of those changes per the way the restaurants serve them).  Thanks for the recipe!

i don't know if i should really be rating this because i made it with chicken instead of fish.  However it the marinade was still fantastic and i liked the sauce.  I let both the sauce and the marinated chicken sit overnight so the flavors could meld.  Also in the sauce i used a chipotle pepper instead of just the sauce and omitted the chili powder.  I made the Tomato, Corn and Avocado Salsa from to go with these and they very so delicious, as good as in any restaurant i've been to.

The marinade is wonderful! Perfect! The fish can stand alone with just the marinade. The dressing/sauce is good but the sour cream actually takes away from the flavor of the marinade. I marinaded the fish overnight. In the dressing, I cut the lime and adobo sauce in half per recommedations here and it was really good. But we found that it isnt as good on the fish. It could be used for something else because it is full of flavor. Overall the fish tacos were excellent, even with the sauce on the side.

DELICIOU S!!! The sauce was too spicy for my kids, so I would modify the ingredients to cool it off a bit next time.  The marinade on the fish was perfect.  I used both Tilapia and salmon and they both turned out great--kids & adults both cleaned their plates!

I used large shrimp for this recipe and it was fantasticl.  I think I will try it with some finely diced red onion next time.  I loved the flavor of the shrimp and the sauce was great.  Can't wait to make it again.

This was a winner.  Made a few adjustments based on recommendations - extra tsp. of honey, used Frank's instead of adobo sauce.  I cooked in oven in glass pan - with marinade on 350 for 12 minutes.  Very good.  Thought the dressing might have too much lime when I tested it before serving - but it was PERFECT with the meal.  Easy and very good.

Excellent marinade for fish! I didn't like the sound of the sour cream dressing, so I used the corn salsa recipe from Fiery Fish Tacos with Crunchy Corn Salsa for the topping instead. Excellent combo (and we don't normally even like fish tacos)!!

I was seeking a lighter alternative for my love of mexican food. I have never had fish tacos and this was great!I used tilapia marinated for 12 hrs and I omitted the adobo and hot sauces. The marinade was flavorful and I served mine on whole wheat tortilla's using pre-packaged cole slaw mix, cilantro and fresh lime juice for the topping. Yum

These are pretty darn good with a few minor adjustments... like another reviewer noted ~ the dressing needs a few tsp. of honey or light brown sugar to take it from just okay to restaurant quality. And definitely marinate the fish at least 24 hours.

Two giant thumbs up on this one!  My husband was really skeptical of this recipe, but ended up LOVING it.  We like to add a bit more chipotle pepper to our sour cream sauce for some serious spice.  Yum!

LOVED IT!! Since I couldn't find adobo sauce easily in Canada I used a few splashes of hot sauce (similar to Tabasco) instead. I also cooked the fish in the marinade in a skillet instead of using the grill. My husband remarked that the tacos were "restaurant quality". I will definitely make these again.

Excellent recipe. Glad I read the reviews first though, because had I put in the 1/2 C of adobo sauce, it would have been way too hot. Hubby loved it too, and he's not crazy about Mexican food in general. It was light, healthy and delicious!

Really enjoyed this reciepe.  I changed some things based on what I had in the house and effort :)  I only marinated for about 45 minutes and thought that worked fine.  Lime Juice actually cooks the fish so I wouldn't leave it too too long as it firms up the talapia making it easier to keep together in the pan which can be a problem.  I also just pan cooked not grilled and they turned out great.  Let it cook up in the juice for a bit before turning.  The fish turns this amazing deep red color that really pops against the red cabbage I used and got oohs and ahs so i'd use that instead of green.  I subbed Some regular grilling seasoning for the old bay and used saracha (sp) instead of the chipootles because I usually don't go that spicy as my lady doesn't like her food too hot...The lime dressing was a bit like Lime yogurt and would probably pass on that next time and just have some sour cream and fresh limes on the side instead.  I'm stilll on the hunt for the perfect fish taco sauce.  Anyway, I'm looking forward to making this again and thanks mabcat for the recipe!

This was fantastic! I made it for a large group and I could have used more! The marinade is really good, I will use it often for fish. I left the adobo sauce out of the dressing since we are wimpy when it comes to spicy stuff! Thanks!

Not bad fish tacos. Loved the sauce, but there was too much of it. Felt like it went to waste. I baked the fish as I don't have a grill, but I think it would be better grilled.

I use this recipe with cod, and it is a family favorite. I make the marinade (you can substitute honey with sugar), and let the fish soak overnite. Then I grill it right in the oven. I don't bother to make the rest of this recipe, so we just use normal taco toppings like lettuce, onion, tomatoes, cheese and sometimes guacamole.

Excellent fish tacos! The only change I made was using a cabbage slaw. I tossed the shredded cabbage with some vinegar, olive oil and the cilantro.

This is a fantastic marinade for fish!  I was worried that it would overseason the fish since it marinated for so long  but it came out perfectly.  I served it with salsa fresca, cabbage, and avocado. I did make the sauce to go with it and found that it was simply too strong for the taco.  If used really sparingly, it is tasty but use too much and you miss out on the delicate flavor balance of the taco with the layered flavors of the other ingredients.

Not a big fan of these because they were too chipotle. I like the ones that are a little sweeter with the spice.

These were OK. There was way too much chipotle in the recipe so I cut it by half and added a little sugar for sweetness. The marinade was good. The dressing had the same flavors in it as the marinade and the spices,(cumin and chilie powder,) in it, were unnecessary. I like things simple. Thank You for giving us the opportunity to have a good fish taco Mabcat

A new favorite, no doubt. I took the advice of many people saying it had too much lime and just withheld lime from the dressing. i kept the marinade the exact same. SOO soo good all together.

My husband raved about it. For the fish, I sub'd the chili powder for cayenne pepper (all i had), but kept everything else same. The lime dressing I liked, but omitted the chipotle. My husband ate it so fast, I barely had time to scoop up enough for one taco before he finished both of our portions!! lol.. oh, well, that means it was good!! :)

This was delicious. I only marinated the tilapia for an hour and pan-cooked the fish. I mixed the dressing with shredded cabbage and made my own guacamole on the side. I will make this again, but will probably use less oil in the marinade and fat-free sour cream or yogurt for the dressing. Oh yeah, and one other thing: I didn’t have any fish seasoning, so I used garlic salt instead. ?

NEVER HAD FISH TACOS UNTIL I WENT TO ALASKA IN JULY.  CAN'T EAT ENOUGH OF THEM NOW.  I MADE THIS RECIPE THE OTHER NIGHT AND MY HUSBAND AND I LOVED IT.  I HATE WHEN PEOPLE CHANGE THE RECIPE THE FIRST TIME, BUT I DID A LITTLE.  I USED SPLENDIA BROWN SUGAR INSTEAD OF HONEY BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE ANY HONEY.  I ALSO COATED MY FISH WITH MCCORMICKS CRUSTING BLENDS (FOUND IN THE SPICE SECTION)  FRIED THE FISH IN A LITTLE BIT OF CANOLA OIL.  IT TURNED OUT GREAT.  I AM ALREADY MAKING AGAIN TODAY FOR MY SON AND HIS WIFE.  THANKS FOR SHARING!

This was an awesome recipe. I loved the dressing, I thought it made the taco. I didn't use tilapia though, I was in  a hurry and I used fish sticks instead, and it was great. I used cut cabbage and tomatoes, plus I made my own homemade chile to add on top of the dressing.  I made the dressing and I calculated it down to serve only 3 and it came out perfect.  Next time I am going to use the fresh fish and try the marinade. Thanks for a great recipe, I like fish tacos now!

I wanted to love these tacos.  I was soooo excited to make them.  The dressing was awful.  The adobo sauce overpowered EVERYTHING.  I could have used anything at all in place of the fish as you couldn't even tell what it was you were eating other than adobo sauce.

Very good flavor. The adobo howver was not really for me. I think next time I will make the dressing/sauce from the same ingredients in the marinade, just less some of the liquid if that makes sense. I also put regular salsa that I like on it. The marinade really made the flavor though.

I made these with halibut for a group last night.  I followed earlier advice about not using quite so much adobo so I cut it down to about 1/3 cup and it was still very hot (would use 1/4 next time) but very good.  I made a version with only a teaspoon or so of adobo for the people that don't like spicy, and it was really good also.  Followed everything else exactly - these were excellent

Great recipe and easy. Excellent flavor! I used Halibut and only marinated it for about 4 hours due to time. For the dressing I used Tabasco Chipotle Pepper sauce instead of adobe sauce. My husband loved these!

Will definitely make this again and recommend this to a friend but would just caution that the proportions of some of the ingredients are extreme. Not sure if this is a glitch with the app or what but I set the serving size at 6. It called for an entire container of sour cream (only used about 1/2 cup); also called for an entire head of cabbage (only used 1 cup); only used 1/2 of the cilantro.  Other than this- it was excellent!

The chipotle in adobo sauce made this dressing great, I pureed a pepper with the sauce and used it that way.
I put the leftover peppers and sauce in my freezer for future meals, I've tried it in a lot of dishes now, it's great.
My family loved this sauce on the fish tacos, the meal was a hit.

The dressing was awesome, I used corn tortillas and grilled them first. I have also made this with whole frozen fish fillets that had a crispy crust (fish sticks) and it was passable in a hurry...
Nice recipe to rotate through family dinners - my kids enjoyed it with tartar sauce instead of the chipolte dressing

Excellent fish tacos! I made the marinade exactly by the recipe. Marinated 6 hours. I used tilapia and the fish was very flavorful and yummy enough to eat alone. The sauce I altered a little bit. I left out the lime zest and added a tablespoon of honey to the mixture. Also I only added about 1/4 a cup of the Adobe sauce.  Next time I would cut the sauce recipe in half. It makes a lot!!! Thank you for a delicious recipe.

First of all, GREAT marinade!  But, as we do not have tilapia here in the U.P. (and, I prefer a firmer white fish) I used Pollock, which is a nice, mild, white fish.  Didn't cut into chunks, just let the marinade do its work and then broiled the fish on the second rack down, 4 minutes per side.  Warmed the flour tortillas in the microwave, and, with the chopped cilantro, some pre-shredded packaged cabbage mix and chopped tomatoes, chopped green chiles in a  sour cream based sauce and slivered red onion...VERY good!  My husband loved it so, there you have it!

This was great! I used apple cider vinegar instead if white, and left out the lime zest. I also didn't add the hot sauce because we didn't have any.
I had a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, and just used the sauce from the can and not the peppers. It was spicy, but delicious! Everyone in my family loved it, and I can't wait to make it again.

This recipe reads delicious. Unfortunately the adobo dressing was terrible! It ruined a perfectly delicious piece of Mahi. It was way too overpowering. Without the dressing this would have been okay. Just say no to the dressing!

Very good, we never made fish tacos before (in 27 years) and they were like a fiesta in your mouth!
Probably more ingredients than I am used to mixing up, but well worth the trouble!

We loved this version of fish tacos!  I did make some changes, though, based on what I had on hand...Used Mahi Mahi instead of tilapia and used extra cummin in both marinade and sauce.  Because of the weather, K chose to broil instead of grill and it turned out fantastic!  I will be making this again real soon!!

I followed a few tips from others and used mahi mahi fillets and more of the dry seasonings that were called for. Everything was DELICIOUS but the tartness of the sauce overpowered the flavor of the fish a little. I would maybe do half the amount of lime juice next time and serve with a side of fresh lime wedges for those who want the extra zing.

Well, there are a ton of reviews and I don't have much to add. But as a novice cook it was easy and turned out very good. The marinade is superb.  But the dressing proportions seem to be way out of whack. Way to hot and too bitter with all the lime juice. Added about double the sour cream to mellow it out and then still seemed to be missing something. Not sure what. I'd make the tacos for sure but might look for alternate dressing recipe.

I baked the fish instead of grilling it. The sauce... wasn't very good. No real flavor, and the blandness overpowered the tasty fish. But the fish was excellent.

Loved, loved, loved this recipe. Used broccoli cole slaw instead of just shredded cabbage. Plan to make this often!

OK I have made this several times now. It's a huge hit. 

The marinade and dressing are simply fantastic! However, I found that the Talapia didn't hold the marinade as well as I had hoped. 
I know this recipe is for fish, but you gotta try it with chicken.

The marinade is great, even if you only let it set for a couple of hours.  If you don't have a grill, broil the fish 5 to 7 minutes. The dressing is excellent. Can substitute low fat sour cream or yogurt to lighten it up.  Outstanding flavor.

My husband who isn't a big fish lover requests this recipe often.  He especially loves the chipotle lime dressing.

Bleck. I'm sorry, but the spice combination with the fish just didn't sit well with me. I could hardly finish one taco, and I'm not that picky of an eater.

Honestly the best fish taco I have ever tasted. I prefer the grilled fish to a heavy batter. The chipotle added quite the kick as well. Which I loved! I will definitely be making these again.

I love fish tacos and so glad I found this recipe! The marinade smells so good and the sauce is out of this world! The sauce has a nice kick too. Ive made this recipe many times and I make it exactly as written except I leave the tilapia whole in the marinade and grill it whole. I live in an apartment so I grill the fish on a George Forman grill and it turns out great!

I've never taken the time to leave a review on a recipe here, though I've made plenty, but these were SO good I just had to take the time to do so. Look no further, this is hands down one of the best fish taco recipes you will find anywhere! The marinade is so so good and SO flavorful. The dressing is really good too, I only made one adjustment, which was cutting down the adobo like others had suggested. I added lettuce and queso fresco on top and grilled the corn tortillas for a bit of crunch. They were all gone in no time!

This was good, but I wouldn't cook the tilapia as long as the recipe says next time. It got a little rubbery.

These fish tacos were great. We omitted the adobo peppers. We used Swai fish. Grilled for too long so they were a bit blackened and dey, but still good. Probably only needed to cook for 7 minutes total.  We uses a cilantro-lime Greek yogurt dressing from Pinterest  instead of the one listed here.

The basics for this recipe are great. Loved the marinade and fish. The sauce needs some changes though. Next time I won't use the lime zest in the sauce. The lime was so overpowering,  it was all you could taste. After reading the other reviews about the adobo sauce being too spicy I added it 1 teaspoon at a time. 3 teaspoons was just enough heat for me. I will make again with changes to the sauce.

Just okay for me.  I don't think fish should be marinated over an hour, it gets mushy due to the acid in the lime and vinegar.  The marinade wasn't amazing, it needs more ingredients such as cilantro and green onions.  I would omit the vinegar next time.  The dressing was delicious!

This recipe was a tasty hit with my family and my husband in particular who is a fish taco fanatic but not necessarily a tilapia fan. I did make a few changes that better suit my family's tastes: I lightly dusted the tilapia with flour and corn starch and fried instead of grilled it; and used hard taco shells but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Definitely recommend this recipe as a delicious and fun alternative for fish!

Great Recipe and a hit with the kids!  Perhaps less lime in the sauce, but the marinade was great!  Next time I will do these over the smokey grill rather than in the oven.

OK, just  oK for a light supper.  Not impressed with the marinade, maybe I should have left fish whole.  Better reviews for the dressing, which I mixed with cabbage!  Served atop, lots of crunch!  Followed exact recipe!

This is a fabulous recipe.  Instead of sour cream, I used Greek yogurt and an the entire can if chipotle (I blended the peppers with the sauce).  I have served the fish tacos to several guests who raved about the flavors.

Holy cow!  These were sooooo good!  Made some modifications based on what I had on hand and other reviewers suggestions. I used lemon pepper Adobo seasoning in place of Old Bay seasoning.  I left the lime out of the dressing, used salsa in place of the adobo sauce and added capers, and served it in a bowl instead of in a tortilla.  I simmered the extra marinade and poured it over the cooked fish.  Used Rainbow Slaw instead of cabbage as I had it on hand, and topped with avocado in addition to the other toppings.  I'm sure it would be perfect as written too! Thank you so much for the extra healthy recipe!

I decided to make this at the last minute, so I didn't have time to marinade the fish as long as I should have. But to me, the real star of this recipe is the sauce - wow! I wasn't shy with the adobo sauce, and combined with the lime, it had a fabulous kick to it. Everyone at our BBQ loved it, even the vegetarian was dipping her Brussels sprouts in it!

Marinade is awesome, however I don't have enough forethought to marinate something for hours, so I let it sit in fridge for about 15min while my oven preheated and I was making the dressing. I baked it for 15min on 350? and it came out perfectly and super moist, (just use slotted spoon to scoop out). I also didn't do the lime zest because A) I don't have a zest thingy, and B) there's honestly enough lime juice to go around without it. I 
I found some adobo paste(?) But I didn't really care for it and only ended up using a 1/2 tsp into the dressing. Also instead of chili powder, I used chipotle chili powder because it just went better with this recipe. I'm not sure why so many are complaining about the spice level--use common sense and add the right amount of chili powder that's comfortable for YOU. I had to tone it by half because my kid can't handle spicy. Oh! And I also added about a tablespoon of honey to the dressing because it really needed it. (and if you don't love lime, squeeze one less halve into it and should be fine)
My hubby and son didn't like the original dressing flavor so much, so I added some Head Country BBQ sauce to it, and they both LOVED it. I like the original, but the BBQ was actually good, too, maybe to change it up a little.

Edit: Oh, I forgot to mention in my picture, I added sweet 'n' spicy corn for a topping..completely optional, though. I just love it so much I find excuses to eat it.

This was amazing.  I actually had corn tortillas on hand and they were great with it.  Incredibly easy to make.  I love the crunch the cabbage gave.  I didn't have the fish spice so I used club house tex mex.  I find basa worked well.  I cooked larger pieces on stove and just cut them into strips after they were cooked.  Loved it. Thanks for sharing.

I usually don't review a recipe if I have made alot of changes , this time I will . Only to help other people out . First off this was the first time I made fish tacos so wasn't sure if ths was a good recipe to start with . The changes I made was to suit our taste and nothing against the recipe it's self . For example I cut the amount of lime back , glad I did ,didn't use any lime zest.Instead of adding cumin & chili powder I used Epicure taco seasoning . I didn't have old bay seafood seasoning so I looked up what was in it and used what I had on hand .The marinade is good , could just eat the fish using it and not make tacos with it .
The sauce I don't like adobo sauce so I left it out and didn't use the lime zest just the juice and again used the taco seasoning .
Overall it was a nice light meal and a good basic recipe to start with and adjust to your own taste .
Thought the sauce would also be good on chicken .

The marinade on the fish is KILLER. I will be making fish tacos much more often now that I've discovered this marinade. I only marinated for about an hour but baked the fish in the marinade instead of grilling. I also excluded the adobo as others have said, but that did leave the dressing a little bland. 
For the cabbage - try mixing it with a quarter cup of apple cider vinegar and salt for a little more flavor. Add jalapeno and red onion for a little more zing in your toppings.

Great! I too had an issue with the dressing and here is what I did differently: instead of the adobo sauce I just added dried chipotle to taste and the lime was too strong/sour, so I added a touch of honey and garlic
I also used white wine vinegar instead of regular vinegar in the marinade just because I like the taste better. Topped with avocado and tomato. Side of black beans, corn, tomato, cilantro salad. Very good!! Would make again.

My husband is a fish taco fan and I decided I was going to give it a try. I figured I would fail a few times before getting it right, but this one (my first attempt) got rave reviews! The only thing I didn't add was seafood seasoning. My fish was thin so I definitely could have cooked it less, but the sauce was delicious and we all enjoyed it.  Even my 4 yr old had a second serving. I put a vinaigrette dressing on the slaw which I ate in my tacos and my hubby consumed on the side.

This was good; my family liked it.  I wish I had remembered to salt & pepper the fish prior to broiling.  I used wild caught cod instead of tilapia, and the results were good.  I wasn't crazy about the dressing, but my kids liked it.  The cilantro was amazing in this recipe! I think I will search out a better dressing for fish tacos before I make this again, but I definitely will make it again.

This recipe was amazing!!!!! I used 1/8 tsp of chipotle marinade sauce instead of hot sauce. The taste was really refreshing.  I also added avocado to the cabbage mixture. I would give this recipe 5 stars.

Marinade was good and it made the tilapia taste decent which is hard to make flavorful. But the chipotle "light sour cream" was bland and very unexciting. Wont ever make this again.

Only rated three stars because I did not care for the chipotle-lime dressing, which was the whole reason I tried this recipe. On the other hand, the marinade for the fish was really good. I didn't have a grater so I didn't use lime zest in the recipe but kept everything else the same. Marinated for 2 hours. Used the corn salsa from the fiery fish tacos and topped with my favorite toppings. Delish!.

I love this recipe! You can make it as hot as you want by adjusting the adobe sauce. But test it, because it heats up quick! Added some shredded cheese, and it was amazing. I've even substituted the fish for chicken, poured the everything into a pan, fried it up on medium-high heat and by-passed the marinade time :)

This is a great recipe. I prefer cod over tilapia and I tweaked a few spices here and there due to personal preference but it's delicious. Instead of the adobo sauce I use sriracha, just because we're addicted to the stuff. Yum, yum!

It was a great recipe for us first timers to experiment with since we typically buy fish tacos as opposed to cooking them. We paired it with cilantro lime rice. Next time I think we will try Mahi Mahi :)

The marinade was great! I used shrimp with good results. I did not attempt to make the dressing as-is, but instead mixed up some mayo + lime juice + chipotle powder, which was delicious. Added some cabbage and pico de gallo to each taco and it was a perfect meal.

Mother of Goodness, this is amazing! We swapped the sour cream for no fat greek yogurt and you can't taste any difference. I recommend starting with a small amount of the adobo sauce and add as your tastebuds allow.  The fish took a long time to bake and I would recommend another fish...I find Tilapia tastes dirty no matter how long I marinate it (but I only did this for an hour).
Husband has asked that I save the sauce recipe...this is really good stuff!

Being from Alaska, we end up with a freezer full of halibut and grilled the fish on a lightly oiled grate after it was cut into chunks.  Outstanding!

Good recipe. I can see why so many people wrote great reviews. I followed this recipe mostly, except I marinaded my fish for about 3 hours before frying them in a pan. The dressing was a little off... It seemed like the adobe may have kicked over powered the nice flavorful fish. Also, the dressing made WAY WAY more than enough for the 1lb of fish. I will do it again, but I will try about 1/4C of Adobe instead of 1/2C.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had to change a few things, as I didn't have the time, seafood seasoning or adobo sauce. So maybe my review isn't quite fair, since I didn't do it as exactly written. I had an hour to get dinner on the table, so skipped the whole marinading part. I made the marinade right in my grilled pan, let the fish soak in that for about 15 minutes while I made the dressing. I found the marinade too sweet. Next time I will put a lot less honey in it. The dressing was good, but definitely needed the adobo sauce to give it more of a kick. It made WAY too much dressing, though. Not sure what I'll do with all the extra. I suggest making half of what it calls for and you'll still have a lot let.
Turned out to be a yummy dinner, though. I added broccoli slaw, avocado and red peppers to the topping. The kids loved it!!

This was so embarrassing to serve, my guests could not even finish their plates it was so overwhelmingly spicy. Such a waste of ingredients.

The sauce was revolting. Over high-heat, the meat was over-done in five minutes, in nine it would've been ashes. The marinade was decent, nothing else really any good about this recipe.

This was really good although I substituted regular Greek Yogurt for the sour cream.  I think if you deleted the fish seasoning you could use this sauce for a base in different dishes.... such as deviled eggs, macaroni salad, potato salad...or even a topping for baked potatoes. Perhaps a Veggie dip....I will use it again in something that's for sure.

Made this tonight with a few modifications.  First, I left out the oil and vinegar from the marinade and used mahi mahi filets from Kroger.  I only marinaded the fish while I made the dressing, and popped them in the oven since it was raining and I couldn't grill.  350 for about 10 minutes and 3 minutes under the broiler.  Decided to gamble and use the peppers in the sauce, which was a bit hot for us but we still liked it.  Like other reviewers, I will cut the amount of peppers next time.

I've been looking for a great fish taco recipe, and I was psyched to try this one. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. It's not that the recipe is bad; it's just not great. I was looking for something that really tantalized my taste buds, but this was just so-so. Nothing popped. For the amount of work, it's easier and tastier (in my opinion) to just make regular chicken tacos in the crockpot.

Marinade was amazing.  Will use this whether I'm making fish tacos or not.  I used my vacuum sealer to "quick marinade" and for less than an hour.  Turned out great.  Makes a lot more Chipotle sauce than is really needed (1/2 it, or double your recipe if you don't like waste).

This is in the regular rotation at our house!  It has a very light, fresh taste and it is easy to put together.  It does look like a lot of ingredients at first, but it's a lot that you probably have on hand, and the marinade and sauce are mostly made up of the same ingredients.  I did leave out the adobo since I don't like things super spicy and I also didn't have any on hand.  Maybe we just go light on the dressing, but I have made this twice now, and we have had a lot of the sauce left over both times.  Next time I will probably cut the sauce recipe in 1/2.  I also make up a quick guacamole to serve with these fish tacos - yum!

This is the best fish taco recipe I have found, and over the years I have tried them all.  The only thing I would change is 1/4 c adobo sauce instead of 1/2 c.  We like spicy, but it was a bit too hot.  Everything else is SPOT on!!

I made half of this recipe (1/2 lb) for my husband and I, and I wish I had made more.  I would have liked my tacos to be a little more full!  I thought this was a good recipe, and even my husband who doesn't like fish thought this was okay. I think mahi mahi would maybe hold up a bit better for this, but the tilapia worked fine.  I baked mine in the oven at 350 for 9 minutes.  For the dressing, I did not use all that adobo sauce, as I knew it would be too spicy for us.  I just drizzled it in a little at a time and stirred until it was just right.  I served with cilantro, lettuce, and sour cream.  I think some black beans would be a nice addition too.

Wow, these were amazing. I thought the recipe looked like a lot of work because of the fairly long ingredient list, but it came together pretty quickly. I did not have Old Bay seasoning, so I used a cajun spice mix. Also, I did not have much time to marinate the fish, so I made the marinade mix, threw the talapia in it, and roasted the fish in the marinade instead of grilling. The flavors are amazing. There is definitely some heat in the marinade and sauce, but not so much as to overhwhelm the flavor of the fish. I served the fish in small corn tortillas and garnished with the sauce, chopped cabbage, finely diced onion, and avocado. I cannot wait to make this again. I think the fish could also be great on a salad, with the sauce as a dressing.

Woweee, these were good!  Be prepared - the chipotle sauce is hot hot hot, but in our house we like a lot of heat so these were just the ticket for a summer evening.  Didn't change a thing.

SO GOOD!  My whole family loved this!  I used wild cod instead of the tilapia and no-fat greek yogurt for sour cream.  I couldn't find Old Bay seasoning or Adobo Sauce at my grocery store.  Instead I used used some salmon seasoning mix and chipotle hot sauce to suit our taste...maybe one tbsp but I don't like things very spicy.  DELISH!  A definate keeper.

So Good!!!  Made them for a dinner party and everyone requested the recipe.  I did not have the Old Bay seasoning, so left it out.  I baked the fish instead of grilling it.  Great recipe.

We loved this recipe!  
I added chopped cilantro to the marinade and chopped hot pepper instead of hot sauce (we don't like a lot of heat), I also skipped the old bay since I don't like it but added a lot of cumin and extra lime and vinegar so I would have more marinade to boil down.
I agreed with another reviewer and just boiled the marinade to save time, then added sourcream to it after it was off the heat. It was also good without sourcream for a lighter dish. My picky husband and our friends loved it.

My family loves this recipe.  We make it at least once a month!  I've used tilapia, which works well, but also have used redfish and bass.  I prefer the tilapia.  We use soft corn tortillas.  I grill on a gas grill with wood chunks for smoke.  Wonderful recipe!  One of our faves!

Absolutely delicious!  Probably the best fish tacos I have ever had!  I didn't use all the adobo sauce (only 2 Tbs. which was plenty) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Really and truly amazing!!

HUGE hit at my cinco de mayo fest. I followed the recipe as is except for chili powder because I didnt have any on hand. Everyone loved the fish, but no one needed or wanted the sauce which was delicious but highly unnecessary. It is a strong sauce that competes with an already strong main dish.

I made this last night for my boyfriend who is a huge fan of fish tacos.  He couldn't stop raving about the complexity of the flavors.  We both decided that making the dressing a day or two before (but hold the lime zest until serving) would definitely add to the overall flavor.  Absoutely excellent!

I did not marinate the fish but pan fried it with  salt and pepper only. I also cut back on the adobe sauce. I served it with the avocado mango salsa which was super delicious.

Not a fan of the adobo sauce. Oddly sweet to me.

I absolutely loved these fish tacos, best I've ever had! The only thing I changed were the toppings, instead I just used avocados (smushed them up like guac), tomatoes, and cilantro. I also didn't drain the fish, I baked the chunks with the marinade in the oven. The sauce was perfect after adding a tablespoon of honey, it really balanced out the citric taste. IT WAS A HUGE HIT FOR MY 5 MEMBER FAM! can't wait to make them again. so yum-o!

I made it for dinner last night and we all loved it.  I used salmon because it's healthier and firmer fish.  I baked it in the oven because it was convenient.  I bought the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and pureed it with the sauce ingredients.  The sauce is hot but we love spicy food in our house so it was perfect for us.  I added some red onions and avocado in my tacos and it was perfect!

WOW!  These were fantastic.  I have already passed along the recipe to several coworkers and family members.  I added green taco sauce to the dressing instead of the adobo sauce.  Also left out the hot sauce as I am not a spicy food lover.  I baked in the oven uncovered in a baking dish at 350 for 12-15 min.  I served with shredded Mexican cheese, shredded lettuce, and chopped cilantro.  My boyfriend ate four tacos before he had time to breathe or blink.  Big hit and will make again in the summer time!

Awesome! Picky boyfriend loved them. I didn't marinate the fish due to time and forgetfulness, instead baked it in the marinade mixture periodically basting, and it turned out great. Warmed up the whole wheat tortillas before adding the fish, then topped with cabbage, shredded carrots, dressing from recipe, fresh lime juice, chopped tomatoes, and fresh avocado. YUM!! Definitely a hit. :)

These are also very good with shrimp. Either way, the only toppings I use are thinly sliced cabbage and salsa. The dressing is good on all kinds of tacos, but like others I use a lot less lime and adjust the chipotle amount, as well. Each time I make this, I add a little more chipotle and now I'm hooked on them. I did as a reviewer suggested and pureed 2 cans and froze them to use as needed. Thank you, mabcat!

skipped the things I didn't have handy:zest, honey and sub'd Lawrys season salt for Old Bays.  Dieting, so no tortilla.  Topped with the dressing(w/low fat sour cream).  The cabbage/tomato slaw was delightful(on the side) with added onion and dressing of olive oil and red wine vinegar.  Thanks mabcat

This was the best fish taco I have ever had; great texture, spice and deep flavors. I too, like other reviewers, baked the Tilapia in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes and it came out perfect. I added chopped white onion to my Salsa (I took all the toppings and combined as a salsa) and added additional fresh lime juice. This was awesome!!! Thank you Mabcat.

These were amazing. I was hosting a cookout for a few friends that don't eat meat, and I decided that I wanted to cook fish tacos.  Admittedly, I had no idea where to begin so I started with a google search that led me to your recipe.  I followed it pretty closely, except I didn't have any honey so I used some agave nectar. 

I was happy with the way they came out, but the true praise comes from my friends. 6 people agreed that this recipe was not only the best fish taco dish they had had, but some also Said that it was the best fish preparation period.  They keep asking me to make "my" fish tacos, but all the credit goes to your recipe.  Great job!

Absolutely LOVED these!!!  I followed the marinade recipe to the T.  Since I am only cooking for 2,  I used a 1/2 pound of tilapia but still the same amount of marinade and marinated for 11 hours.  Baked at 350 for 20 minutes w/a little of the marinade.  The dressing I also followed almost to the T.  I bought the chipolte peppers in adobe sauce and per recommendation of others, strained the sauce to get rid of the seeds.  For toppings I used a shredded slaw and made a relish with tomato, onion, lil avacado, lil fresh jalapeno, half can of southwest freshlike corn, lime juice, lime zest, splash of EVOO,  basil, salt and pepper.  I used flour tortilla shells, put a dash of EVOO on each side and broiled on a baking sheet until a lightly crisped, flipping and watching frequently.  YUM, this will definitely be a regular meal in our household!

Great ingredients that I transformed into a "faux taco" without the tortilla (see my custom recipe).  I made as is - but subbed cabbage leaves for the tortillas and made a quick salad of thinly sliced vegetables.  Really tasty and GUILT FREE.

Used this marinade with the white sauce from the "Fish Tacos" on this website.  (Didn't have any adobo in the house)  Delicious and fresh!  Tilapia took on great flavor and really stood out.  Thanks for a great recipe!

An amazing recipe! I used shrimp.   Did not add the seafood seasoning and it was still a "10" for my family.  We tried it with corn and flour tortilla's, liked the corn better.

Yum!!! I give this 5 stars on the marinade alone...delicious! I served this to my family for dinner last night to rave reviews...even my extremely picky 3 and 4 year olds gobbled it down! I marinated the fish just an hour and a half and there was still plenty of flavor absorbed. I had no problems with the texture of the tilapia (as others did); I thought it was perfect. I shredded the fish onto warmed flour tortillas topped with cabbage, tomato, red onion, cilantro, taco blend cheese, and the dressing included with this recipe. Don't overdue the dressing or it will overpower the flavor of the tacos; otherwise it's a great accompaniment. I did leave out the adobo in the dressing as I couldn't find it in the store; I added a 1/2 tsp of hot sauce instead for alittle kick. The dressing isnt amazing but I have no complaints on it either. Together, all the flavors blend to make one heck of a dish! Try 'em!!! :) (I served these with fresh homemade salsa and queso and chips...this ended up being probably one of my family's favorite meals ever!)

I love this recipe and make it all the time now. If I'm short on time (which happens often!), I'll skip the marinade and just pan-cook the fish in a little EVOO plus the seasonings (cumin, chili powder, seafood seasoning, pepper) and juice of half of a lime. 

The chipotle dressing is the key element of this, and I keep this recipe intact. I use a hand immersion blender, which makes this incredibly easy. I usually add a bit of cilantro in the dressing as well. NOTE: 8 oz of sour cream makes quite a bit of dressing (especially since you only use maybe a tablespoon on each taco) so unless you're making this for a bunch of people, I suggest halving the recipe.  I have, however, used the extra dressing on 'taco salads' the next day - yum!

My favorite toppings for this are shredded lettuce (I don't care for cabbage), avocado slices and chopped tomato. 

Delicious! Don't worry too much about the lengthy marinating time the recipe suggests... I've only done that once, and it didn't make that much of a difference from my 'quickie' cooking method anyway.

Made this recipe today exactly as written.  My family really enjoyed it.  The sauce was a little hot for me, so I was careful to use it sparingly.  The rest of my family likes hot and spicy, and they thought these tacos were great.  I can't imagine making the dressing without the adobo sauce at all.  I left the fish as fillets, and cooked them on the grill.  That worked fine, I feel that pieces may dry out and fall apart.  Made both corn and flour tortillas to satisfy all tastes; my preference for this dish would be corn.  Served with tomatoes, cilantro, cabbage, lime, chopped avocado, guacamole, and mango salsa.  Not one morsel left!  The mango salsa added a great flavor, and helped cool down the sauce.  Next time I may try ahi tuna instead of tilapia.

Made these last night using Halibut.  Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of baking in the oven for about 8 minutes at 400 degrees and also topping with slices of avocado. Delish!

Wow - this is a keeper. Even my picky kids loved it.  We don't like a lot of heat so I reduced the adobo sauce a LOT, but it still had the smoky flavor and was delicious!  I also added just a pinch of sugar to the dressing and it really brought out the flavor.

we really liked these.  I only marinated my fish (grouper) for about an hour and a half as that's all I had and in general a light marinade is more than enough on fish unless you want to make ceviche.  My husband said that they are a definite "make again".

I didn't have time to marinate the fish, so I used it like a glaze and threw the fish under the broiler. I can't believe how delicious the fish by it self was!

It was the sauce that disappointed. I don't do a lot of spicy things (It's hard on the stomach!) and cut back on the adobo, but I felt like there was a flavor component missing from the sauce. It was just blah and covered up the amazing flavor of the fish. Perhaps adding some garlic to the sauce could punch up the flavor without adding heat. I'll definitely try the fish again though!

A fantastic fish taco recipe!  I marinated for only 90 min. and the tilapia was flavorful.  Substituted non-fat, plain yogurt for the sour cream; used a med. salsa in place of the chipotle (not a chipotle fan); and served on white corn tortillas.  Will definitely make again!

These were delicious! I only gave it four stars because the sauce was really hot, so you need to watch out for that if you are serving this to children or to people who don't like hot stuff. Even as hot as it was, it was so yummy. I used fat free sour cream, which makes these tacos wonderful for my diet. Thank you!

Excellent fish tacos, and excellent dressing recipe.  DEFINITELY marinate the fish for the time specified...it gets so much more flavor that way.

To serve these, I used corn tortillas, sprayed them lightly on either side with Pam, and heated them in a saute pan or on the grill for a minute or so on each side (healthier than all-out frying).  Then, hot off the pan, I curved them into a the typical taco shell shape between two overturned bowls and let them cool.  My favorite way to serve taco/fajita tortillas.

This was fabulous and my whole family and even my in-laws LOVED it!!!  The only thing I would do different next time is cut the adobo sauce in half because the sauce was way too spicy for us.  I even put in double the sour cream so it made a lot more but still cut down on the spice to it.  I switched out the shredded lettuce with a cole slaw mix.  We also added jasmine rice as a side dish to put in or on the side and served with yellow corn tortilla chips (this is how they serve the fish tacos at my restuarant)!!!  Overall delicious and we will definitely be making it again!

The marinade was very good - I didn't have a lot of time for it to marinade (just a couple hours), so I also decided to just bake it in the marinade. I didn't use the Old Bay since I didn't have any, but I did use a seafood spiced salt we had.  For the dressing, I only made half (and still have some left over) and cut back on the chipotle adobo sauce.  I had red cabbage, so I used that - it really adds a nice crunch to the tacos :) I also added some thinly sliced avacado - yum :)  I also didn't sut it up beforehand and just used the spatula to break it up and I too used fat free sour cream.

Let me say that the SAUCE IS AWESOME!  However, my family didn't care for the marinade/fish.  Also, to make things easy, I used prepared broccoli slaw for topping instead of the cabbage.

This marinade is AWESOME! I marinated some  Swai fillets overnight and they came out very flavorful. I have made the dressing from this recipe before which is very good but this time made the corn salsa from the 'Fiery Fish Tacos with Crunchy Corn Salsa' on this site. The combo was great!

These were wonderful.  I do have to say the flavors of the fish & dressing compete with eachother a bit.  So next time I will marinade the fish like the recipe & make a simpler dressing or season the fish more simple & make the dressing like the recipe.  Regardless, the tacos were great!  Make sure the adobo sauce is from chipotle peppers, not chiles.  Went to Mexican store & learned that it would be easy to buy the wrong sauce.  You only use the sauce from the can of peppers, not the peppers.  Discard peppers or use for something else.  One can yields approx. 1/2 C. sauce.  The dressing makes quite a bit once you add the sour cream & other ingredients.  You could cut the dressing recipe in half.  Unless you use alot, you don't need this much.  We have alot left & will use it for something else.  We used rockfish & it was a great fish for fish tacos!!

This recipe was awsome!  Made a fish lover out of my husband!  I used grouper instead of talpia. We added some shrimp to the marinade too. We did not grill the fish/shrimp, tho.  We put the fish/shrimp in a hot skillet for about 5 minutes along with that delicious marinade.  Out-of-this-world Delicious!

This was a great dish! The lime and cilantro balance well with the heat from the other elements. It took a while to prepare; next time I will do all of the prep work in advance. The dressing makes a HUGE portion -- I only used about 1/4 of it.  Be prepared for the heat: if you aren't used to hot foods, use less adobo sauce and more sour cream in the dressing mix. Me and my husband got two whole meals out of this, so overall it was good for the budget too!

DELICIOUS!!! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe...I was sick and tired of restaurants advertising fish tacos and serving a deep-fried piece of fish and chips with a little cabbage and calling those the real deal. Being from So. California originally, I love fish tacos- this marinade and especially the dressing are fantastic! The only thing I did differently was cutting the fish in 2 to 3 inch cubes and grilling them in a foil boat over medium-high heat. I was worried the fish would fall through the grill and be wasted :) I used frozen talapia fillets I bought at Costco and it worked beautifully...thanks again for an excellent recipe!

This is a great recipe!  I have made it several times since I first tried it a few months ago.  As written is excellent, but on occasion I substituted the ancho chili paste with thai garlic chili paste and it is just a good.

My wife and I love this dish.  We like to use a blackened fish that is grilled.  It saves us the time on marinating the fish.  I highly recommend using a good cole slaw with a twist (such as jap mayo).

This is an outstanding recipe that I have used for years, just realized I never rated it.  I will say that now I find it easier and healthier to grill the filets (indoor or out) after brushing with a little olive oil and using Seafood Magic to season.  Just break the cooked filet into the taco and use the wonderful sauce.  You don't have to fry if you don't want to, the "sauce is the boss".  A little sliver of chilled radish on top and you have some mighty good eating ahead.  Thanks for sharing it.

I FOUND THAT THE GREAT TASTING MARINADE IS MORE FLAVORFUL IF THE FISH IS HALIBUT AND IF YOU LINE THE GRILL WITH FOIL SO THE MARINADE HEATS UP AND STAYS WITH THE FISH.  THIS ALSO WORKS GREAT WITH HALF FISH AND HALF SHRIMP (RAW UNCOOKED, AND PEELED).  BTW  I DO NOT LIKE COOKED FISH.  ONLY SUSHI BUT THESE TACOS ARE GREAT.  LAST NIGHT I MADE THE MARINADE AND OMITTED THE SEAFOODSEASONING AND CUBED BONELESS CHICKEN BREAST.  MARINADED THE CHICKEN AND MADE CHICKEN KABOBS ON THE GRILL!!!  MMMMMMMMM!!!

These were the most flavor-full fish tacos that i've ever eaten. I made the sauce with just the sour cream and adobo plus a little salt and it complemented the fish perfectly.

These were so good! We all loved them. I followed other reviews and omitted the adobe sauce. The marinade gave the fish a very good flavor. I grilled the filets on a grill pan. I made them with the flour tortillas. Next time I will try the hard taco shells.

This was so good that I just registered so that I could rate this recipe. Don't make too many adjustments. It's pretty much perfect. I made it with Orange Roughy. It's now on our regular rotation for dinners.

The fish turns out great.  The sauce is not quite right.  Worth making the fish and serve with spicy salsa, cabbage and avocado.  If you find a better sauce, please post here.

Excellent. The only change I made was to use just a little bit of adobo sauce and minced chipotle, so as not to make it too spicy. The fish had great flavor after marinating for 8 hours. Thanks! :)

This was our family's first time making and eating fish tacos.  We've been trying to get more seafood in our diet.  These tacos are delicious!!  I baked the fish instead of grilling but it was still very flavorful.  I agree with some others that there seems to be a lot more sauce than needed, but that's ok - just an excuse to cook more fish!  As written, this recipe is great, but I think next time I'll add some avocado.  Thanks for sharing this, mabcat!

This is a terrific fish taco recipe; I use it all of the time. I love the chipotle mayo- though I usually sup ff sour cream and some yogurt for the mayo. turns out great and is much healthier! I also like to make the crunchy corn salsa on this site with red bell pepper, corn, red onion, and cilantro. It is a nice mild salsa that pairs well with the chipotle. Yum!

Great recipe!  The marinade was AWESOME.  I actually threw the fish and marinade in a frying pan on med high heat and cooked the fish that way.  So tasty.  However, the dressing recipe needs to be cut in half... we had way too much dressing for the amount of fish.

Fantastic.  Check for spiciness before adding the additional chili powder to the sauce though, it was too hot for some. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

The marinade for this is very very nice.  At the last minute I used shrimp instead of the fish (at my bf's request).  The sauce I can tell you, if made as directed will be way too hot.  Adobo sauce is very hot.  I used maybe 2tbs of the sauce and then chopped up about 3 peppers.  So it was still hot and still smoky, but not to the point where you can't eat it.  I used the juice of one lime (well slightly less then all the juice) and although I really liked it, it was still a little too limey for the bf.  All in all we both loved this recipe and look forward to making it again.

Delicious. Instead of grilling the fish (way to cold outsiede to grill anything -smile) we baked the fish and assembled tacos. This was delicious. We loved it.

Okay these were simply AMAZING!!!!! My 6 year old nephew said these were better than ice cream!!! That is the highest compliment in my book!! I made these as written, minus the Adobo sauce (couldn't find it). I served it with fresh tomato, avacado, lettuce and limes. This is now a regular in my house!! Thanks!!!

The dressing really makes these tacos. I used cod and it was very good, I know it's not as good for you but we prefer deep frying the fish.

I am updating my review from a few years ago.  This is a great fish taco!  I made this recipe the first time and used the marinade and baked my fish in the oven with a little breading to give it a slight crunch.  The second time, I didn't use the marinade  and just pan fried some lightly breaded tilapia that I already had in the freezer.  Be careful with the chipotle.  It can get real spicy fast.  I add a little then taste until I get the heat level I like.  The full amount in the recipe is just too much for us.  Also I half the dressing since it makes a lot and there is only the two of us.  I also add in a whole juiced lime to the cream sauce and a bit of the cilantro to the dressing.   With the rest of the cilantro and tomato, I made up a corn, tomato, onion, garlic, and cilantro pico de gallo to garnish on top of the tacos.  I layered the tacos with the fish, cabbage, the pico, drizzled with the sauce, and sliced green onions with a lime wedge on the side to squeeze over top.  It was delicious this way and will be how I make it again.  Delicious recipe!  Thank You!

Very very good.  I didn't have adobo sauce but I used some poblano salsa instead.  Substituted cod for tilapia.  Baked fish in their marinade in shallow baking dish for about 20 mins at 350 and they turned out perfectly.  Will definitely make again!

I used the tilapia and think it cooked up great!  I only subbed out the adobe sauce (bc I didn't have any on hand) with some hot sauce and the dressing still tasted like our fav from a local restaurant.  The fish had a great flavor alone, even my picky kids liked it!

Great sauce.  I baked in foil for 8-12 mins instead of grilling.  Turned out great.  Garnished with precut cabbage slaw (cabbage and carrots) and a simple aioli (equal parts mayo and salsa) for creaminess.  Will definitely make this again!

I do not like fish at all, but my husband does.  I gave this a try, and to my suprise I can now say that I eat tilapia, but only in a taco with chipotle-lime dressing!  This is a really fun meal to enjoy outside in the summer with margarita in hand.

Delicious!! Definately a keeper! The only change I made was using curry powder, rather than the Old Bay since I didn't have any. So mine may be a bit spicier, but soooo good!

Absolutely delicious. I made a few changes though, for convenience: I sauteed the chunks of fish instead of grilling (only about 2 minutes per side, otherwise you'll overcook the fish), I used a broccoli slaw mix that had cabbage broccoli and carrot in it, worked great, and I added cilantro to the dressing, as well as a topping. Also, I omitted the adobo sauce because I didn't want to open a whole can of chipotle peppers. I heated the tortillas for a couple seconds in a frying pan as well. I served sauteed pineapple on the side. It was great and I will definitely make again--probably tomorrow!

I love fish tacos, and I was psyched to find a recipe that used grilled fish.  I didn't have a whole lot of time, so I just marinated for about an hour, and then cut the fillets into chunks and cooked them on the stove with the marinade (which I boiled).  The seasonings came through beautifully, and the flavor was out of this world!  I used ten inch tortillas, and used all of the suggested toppings and the dressing.  I could not find chipolte peppers, so I omitted the adobo sauce, and I was worried that my dressing would be too thick, but it was perfect.  My Mexican-food hating boyfried loved them.  Now, THAT'S amazing!  I bet a slice of avocado would be terrific on these.

This recipe is one of our favorites, we have it atleast once a week. I haven't had the time to marinate the fish for more than an hour and it still comes out with a lot of flavor. The sour cream dressing is amazing! I have used it for breakfast burritos and in my seven layer dip. We use whole wheat tortillas and plenty of cilantro. I have grilled the fish as well as baking it. Tilapia can be grilled, just use a lot of cooking spray and a wide spatula!

Marinade was delicious!!  I would just cook the fish in it for a meal with rice!  I didn't even marinade it for 6 hours... I was pressed for time so I let it sit for about an hour then baked it in some of the juice.  I also didn't make the dressing since my boyfriend doesnt like sauces... I just mashed up some black beans mixed with cilantro and lime juice and spread that in the shell before adding the fish.  Will definately make again!

It was pretty good.  The recipe for the sauce seemed to make too much sauce, unless some people like a little fish with their sauce taco.  You could probably cut it in half, in my opinion.

This recipe rocks!  I have fallen in love with Fish Tacos since moving to San Diego 5 yrs ago.  This is the recipe I served my family on Easter and it was a huge hit!  I used Mahi Mahi as I like the firm texture of it.  I also used a combo of white corn, yellow corn and flour tortillas.  The sauce was great and I made a quick pico de gallo to put on them also. I have made this recipe twice since Easter and have grilled and cooked in the oven and they are equally tasty. Thanks for my new favorite!

This was delicious!!! I didn't find old bay so I used salmon/seafood grilling spices.. I was running short on time so couldn't marinate. Instead I baked the Marinate for 10' @ 350 degrees. Brushing the marinade on top of fish. Took marinate out, Then I broiled low for ten min. Continued brushing.  The dressing was very spicy! I made sure the chiles were well blended in the blender before I mixed everything together.toppings; l used avocado, cilantro, tomato and lettuce I didn't have cabbage. They were amazing! It's a keeper! ;D thanx!!

This is one fabulous marinade Mabcat and now I can't wait to try it with chicken! The only thing that stopped me from giving this five stars is the amount of adobo sauce it called for. I love heat, but Chipolte adobo sauce is some seriously hot stuff and honestly, one teaspoon gave the sauce just the right amount of punch for me. With that, I thought the sauce was wonderful and didn't feel the lime overpowered it at all. It was very refreshing. This is the fish taco recipe I'll be making from now on; not only is it the most flavorful one I've made, but it's definitely one of the healthiest too. Thank you so much!

The marinade in this recipe is great. Like many other reviewers I cut way back on the Adobo sauce. I used only about 2 ½ Tbls. I also feel that 9 minutes on a grill at high heat is to long. My fish was done in about 5 ½  minutes on my Weber charcoal grill. I have cooked a lot of  Tilapia on the grill and this usually the case.

This is just the recipe I was looking for!  It was delicious and I totally impressed my family! I left the fish in the marinade over night then put them under the broiler. I left out the honey in the marinade because I didn't have any and it was GREAT!  Just like the fish tacos I've eaten at restaurants.  For the dressing, again didn't have all ingredients so I whipped up 1/4 cup sour cream and mayo, pinch of chili powder, 1 tablespoon of chopped cilantro, and the juice of 1 lime....delish!

This was just OK for me. I think the flavors were too strong for the fish.For the dressing, it definitely seems like it calls for too much adobo sauce...I just added a few teaspoons and it was enough.

Good, solid marindate. I omitted old bay, lime zest, and hot sauce and marinaded overnight. Fish baked at 350 for 15 or 20 min came out tasty. Went well with yogurt sauce and mango cabbage salsa in the tacos. Maybe nothing spectacular or eyepopping because the flavor gets covered up in the taco, but tasty and easy nonetheless.

I'm giving "grilled fish tacos with chipotle lime dressing" 5 stars but I do it a little bit differently with the same ingredients. First, I make the Chipotle-Lime Mayo, but I then mix it with a 1 cup of pre-shredded coleslaw mix.  We blacken then grill the fish (sometimes in a cast iron skillet), add shredded cheese to the tortilla before placing hot fish on it (so cheese melts) then add the coleslaw and some homemade fresh salsa.  YUM! So healthy and delicious. Just like they make at McCormick and Schmik's, only at home!  A+++++

Great recipe! I used 1" tilapia and baked 5' then broiled 3'. On the sauce, I used non fat Fage Greek Yoghurt instead of Sour Cream,,and about 2oz of chopped chipolte peppers in adobo sauce(san martino). Everyone loved it. I also used 2.5tbsp rice wine vinegar, 1tbsp oilve oil and 1 tsp sugar in 3 cups shredded cabbage. Great stuff. served with blackeye peas.

Delicious & healthy alternative to deep-fried fish tacos. Like other reviewers, i'd say go easy on the heat in the dressing (omit adobo sauce and add just a pinch of chili powder, or leave it out entirely and use dill weed instead). I think having a "cooling" dressing is a nice contrast to the amazingly good - and spicy - grilled fish. Also, Southwestern Cabbage Salad (on this site) makes a great garnish and side to this recipe. Thanks!

Im not really good at following directions EXACTLY.  I can usually read a recipe and tell if the flavors will go together. The spices in the marinade sounded really good, so I gave it a whirl.  I didnt have any honey on hand, but thought it might be good anyway, and it was!!!  Marinade was delicious on fish.  I cut cabbage into strips, & seasoned in same bowl as marinade.  It was really good!  Next day I just had  cabbage and leftover fish as a salad.  Perfect for my diet!

I was excited to make this dish. But it was just ok. the fish has to be spicier. I will play around with it. 

I actually liked the fish much better the next day. I will still add more spice to it next time.

I made this with grouper and it was awesome!  I was out of cumin so I just used some taco seasoning instead of it and the chili powder.  I also used cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce.

The sour cream dressing is absolutely amazing!  

This will definitely be a regular from now on.

I followed the recommendations others posted in their reviews and I used only 1 tbsp of adobo sauce in the dressing.  The fish still came out very flavorful.  I will definitely make this again, but may try using catfish instead.  The spices seemed to overpower the tilapia which is a very delicate tasting fish.

The adobo was way overwhelming. I agree with another reviewer that a couple of tablespoons would have been plenty. I had to double the sour cream just to make it edible.

but the marinade was delicious.

Outstanding!  We don't go out anymore for fish tacos because they taste better at home.  I have had to skip the marinade in more recent nights and it is still a keeper.  Thanks!

Delicious!  Delicious!  Delicious!  All I can say is who needs regular tacos when you have such a wonderful, healthy, light, and FLAVORFUL option.

I used Red Snapper instead of tilapia b/c that what was in the freezer.  My husband ate his w/ tortillas and I wrapped mine in romaine lettuce leaves.

This would have been 5-stars BUT there is no way 1/2 cup of adobo sauce is correct.  My husband and I love chipotle and that is the reason I made this recipe.  I would say a few tablespoons is plenty.

This recipe is awesome...It totally proved my assumption (that fish tacos were gross) wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. This is tasty enough to impress your friends with! The marinade is crucial, so give it time. And make it spicy, it's more fun that way! Thanks for this recipe; this is certainly a keeper.

four stars only because the marinade was excellent and the dressing leaves something to be desired.  I made the recipe exactly as shown, and the marinade was very tasty.  I think tilapia is not the right fish for this recipe, though.  It needs something sturdier, like salmon or swordfish.  The dressing was awful.  I have never used adobo sauce before, and 1/2 cup is WAY too much. It only needed a couple tablespoons, if that.  I ended up doubling the rest of the ingredients to try and dilute the adobo.  The color is kinda gross as well.  We ended up adding a lot of extra lime juice, cumin and sour cream.  I took another reviewer's advice and cooked down the marinade into a sauce.  I much preferred that to the adobo dressing.  Next time I will try leaving the adobo out altogether and see what happens.

This was so delicious, both me & my husband loved it! The spice was right on target - I actually would have liked a little more. I only marinated the fish for about an hour before cooking, but I opted not to grill the delicate tilapia & instead pan sauted them right in the marinade & they were absolutely delicious. Served on warm tortillas with guacamole, black beans, preshredded cabbage, and salsa, and spanish rice on the side. Absolutely the best tacos I've ever made & a strong competitor to any I've ever bought at a resturaunt.

We did use Haddock instead of Tilapia, worked out great!  My only questions is in how long it is recommended to marinade fish.  I only did so for 30min. & as it was the fish was cooked a bit by the acidity in the marinade.  Wouldn't 6-8 hours cook it completely?  Anyhow, we loved it & 30 min. worked just fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

Overall this recipe was really good and easy to follow.  Personally, I didn't feel like the marinade truly seasoned the fish all that much.  The sauce however was really good!  I'd make it again but maybe add some salt to the marinade.

I marinated the fish (I used cod) for 24 hrs - 12 probably would have been ample. The chipotle-lime dressing was absolutely amazing! So delicious. I'll be using it as a dip for other things. I served the tacos with shredded cabbage and cilantro. I think I prefer beer-battered fish in fish tacos, but this was still really good. Thanks, mabcat!

I made this recipe for my family tonight for dinner.  The fish is a little tart for me. I think I might omit the vinegar and reduce the lime, if I try this again.  I like the chipotle-lime dressing, but again a little much lime for my taste buds.  I wonder if I dried off the fish and then dredged it in corn meal would it be good pan fried???

My husband loved this!!!! I used the marinade for some tuna tacos & it was wonderful!! It had the perfect tang from the lime zest & juice & just the right sweetness from the honey. It reminded me of a baja fish taco. A keeper for sure.

I made this last night and it was very good.  I used swordfish instead of the tilapia because it's a little bit of a sturdier fish.  I loved the Chipotle-Lime dressing.  It had a nice bite to it and it was great on chips too.

I only used the marinade in this recipe for my dover fillets.  It was a very unexpected combination of ingredients that worked quite well together.  I used rice vinegar instead of white vinegar; did not use cumin, chili powder, or hot pepper sauce (used crushed red pepper flakes instead); and used some Mrs. Dash seasoning rather than seafood seasoning.  Also added some thyme.  I baked the fillets whole at 350 with a lot of marinade on top, and flaked afterwards for the tacos.  It tasted great.  Just wish it could have been more tangy, but could have resulted from the rice vinegar substitution.

Wonderful recipe. We used shrimp in place of the fish and cooked on the grill. I thought it sounded like quite a large  amount of adobo sauce and I was right. I would think just a few tablespoons would do just fine.Next time I will lesson the amount. Excellent recipe regardless!

I made the marinade and grilled the tilapia.  I used a store-bought baja sauce instead of the sauce in the recipe & topped the tacos with "Fresh Pineapple Salsa" instead of the toppings in the recipe.  Amazing combo!

I thought this was pretty darn good. I'm always looking for great foods other than chicken. I didn't add all the lime zest because I didn't have it and I didn't add the old bay seasoning because I don't like it.  I had no idea what adobe sauce was and it turns out I like it.  Jeff added Pico de gallo to his taco and he loved that. We thought the fish could have been more flavorful but we only marinated them for less than an hour. I used just over 1 pound of tilapia and that fed 4 of us with no leftovers. Next time I need to make more so husband has lunch for the next day. I made it again and used 1 1/2 pound of fish for 5 of us and  there was so leftover fish. I wish I made more.  This time I made my own fish seasoning which was awesome. I marinated it about 3 hours. The flavor was so much better and fuller than last time I made it.  I had giant tortillas so we each only got one. I doubled the sauce but that was not needed at all.  I couldn't remember what adobe sauce was so I got 2 small cans of chipotle peppers in adobe sauce. One can I kind of mushed up the peppers and the other one I  took the peppers out. It was all good.  Everyone liked it but not RAVED reviews from the family, just good reviews.

I've actually made these tacos several times and they are always a hit!  They are easy to tweak the "hotness" with the adobo sauce.

I loved the flavors.  It was a  nice strong flavored recipe.  The sauce is a really nice added touch.  I had a lot of sauce leftover.  You could probably cut it down by half for still enough for a pound of fish.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Heaven in a tortilla! For the dressing I just used two chipotle chilies in adobo sauce and chopped them up very fine before mixing in.  They gave it a great smoky flavor with just a bit of a kick. The marinade really is divine.  I used another reviewer’s suggestion and marinated in the fridge for an hour, then baked the fish in the marinade in the oven.  So so sooooo yummy

Since I’m a vegetarian, I used the “mock” fish from Quorn, so I didn’t use the marinade. I did use the dressing for the slaw, which was delicious. I, too, used the sauce from a can of chipotles in adobo, and it was very spicy, but I liked the heat. I appreciate a new way to enjoy tacos.

Very good marinade, but the sauce was really spicy. I only used 1/4 cup of adobo and that was even pushing it. I eliminated the chili powder since the adobo was so strong. I would definitely make this again but with minimal adodo sauce.

These are the best fish tacos I have ever tasted.  I make them a lot and it is always a crowd pleaser.  I was in San Diego this past week for my aunt's 90th birthday and made these for the family reunion with three levels of heat made possible by how much Adobo sauce I used.  My aunt went for  the "Devil's Den" as did most of us.

I did make a change.  I made a honey lime dressing of lime zest, juice, honey, minced garlic, salt, canola oil, with a pinch of salt and pepper and made a slaw to put on the tacos.  Slaw was savoy cabbage, julienne radishes, and adds a refreshing zip to the tacos.   The  sour cream dressing shown above is just a dollop on top of the rest.

AMAZING!  We really enjoyed these tacos.  I did cheat a little by purchasing a bag of slaw. I added juice from a lime, a little apple cider vinegar and two Tbls of mayo to the entire bag.  Perfect fresh, easy and yummy week night meal.

Great recipe. Made it with fresh porgy fillet crowd pleaser.  Better with corn tortillas vs flour imo.

Excellent!  The only change I made was to use the adobo sauce from a small can of chipotle peppers, about 1/4 cup, not the 1/2 cup the recipe called for.  Good heat, not overpowering.  Used bluegill fillets, because that's what I had, but any mild white fish would work.  As another reviewer noted, grill the fillets whole, not cut up.  Makes it a lot easier.

I only used the marinade and it was pretty good.  I do not care for tilapia so now that I have made it as written, I am anxious to try this with another type of milk white fish.

I baked mine - the recipe is good whether you put it in tacos or not. I agree that the spice is a bit much for the chipotle...even the fish was just a bit too limey - maybe I'll leave out the zest or something next time - will make it again..

Used only one teaspoon of honey.  and Garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.  added one teaspon of Taco seasoing.  During cooking, I shredded the tilapia so it looks like ground beef. Kids loved it.

Followed the recipe pretty much as is. The only change I made was that I reduced the adobo sauce to 1/4 cup based on what others said. Personally, we didn't use that much of the dip so I'll probably 1/2 it the next time. I only had about 5 hrs to  marinate the fish and it was very tasty!! I also warmed the tortillas on the grill while the fish cooked. Even my husband loved this dish and he doesn't do marinades!!!

I made this using fresh Halibut.  I only marinated the fish for about 4 hours.  I didn't put the seafood seasoning in the marinade.  I thought it had good flavor but next time I'd either use less or completely omit the honey- I didn't really care for the sweet taste it gave the fish.  I made the dressing for the tacos and also left out the seafood seasoning- it was pretty tasty.  I topped the tacos with avocado slices, pico de gallo, cabbage and the dressing.

To save time I didn’t make the marinade, just the dressing, and it was still excellent! Also, I used hammour fish (from the Arabian Gulf) and that worked really well.

I made this for my nephew, who doesn't like fish, and my neice, who does, so I used Halibut and Chicken, and I have to say, the chicken tasted better than the fish! I marinated the chicken breasts for 6 hours and it turned out moist and flavorful!  I might use chicken exclusively for this recipe from now on!

This recipe is good. However, the recipe as listed says to add the lime juice and zest to both the marinade and then the dressing. I made the recipe exactly as listed and while it was flavorful and good, the lime was overwhelming. I even tried to add more sour cream to the dressing to cut the taste of the lime but it still overtook the other flavors. I’m wondering if this was a mistake on Allrecipes part as far as how it’s written out as there are not separate measurements listed for the marinade and dressing. We will definitely make these again but with less than half of the lime it calls for.

This was fantastic. I did cut the adobe pepper sauce in 1/2. My daughter thought it was still too spicy and my husband thought it wasn't spicy enough. So I think I got it right. I used 1.5 lbs of cod for the fish and it was delicious. I would use corn tortilla's next time. The flour tortilla's were fine, but the I think the corn would add a bonus flavor.

This was so good!!! I left out the adobo sauce from the dressing and added chipotle seasoning. I also left out the lime zest and added some honey about 1 tsp. We also added red onions to our toppings. These tacos were to die for!! Couldn’t get enough of them!

Flavor was good, but it took a lot of time to make due to the amount of ingredients.  We had two of us making the marinade, sauce and veggies and it took over an hour (by the time you gather all the ingredients and put them in).  If I made it again I would triple the marinade recipe and freeze it in two other batches so that the process would be faster.

I usually add a little more lime and chili powder than the recipe calls for because I enjoy the tart and spicy, but this is better than any fish taco I've ever had at a restaurant, or any other recipe I've tried.  It's incredible.  The sauce is sooooo yummy!!!

This is a great fish taco recipe. Not overly complicated or time consuming. I used lemon juice and zest instead of lime juice because my boyfriend prefers lemon and it was great! Will be making again soon.

We omitted the seafood seasoning and chipotle with adobe due to hubby's diet, but it was still very yummy and refreshing! We baked the fish instead of grilling.

Notes for myself: Instead of following the dressing exactly I omitted the lime juice and zest and adobo sauce and added 1 teaspoon of chipolte seasoning with the chili and cumin. I squeezed fresh lime juice on the tacos as I made them.

They were very delicious! I highly suggest using less than the recommended lime juice for everything (I used about 1/2 of recommended and it turned out amazing). Also to eliminate some of the tart in the dressing I would highly recommend some chipotle tabasco sauce (you can buy it at the stores now.) Also I cooked for 6 people and I had to add a filet or two in order to feed that many mouths and I STILL ran out of fish.  I suggest getting 2 pounds of tilapia instead of 1 if you are feeding any more than 6. Otherwise, everything was delicious. Went great with corn salsa from another recipe.

Fantastic!  I followed directions as stated.  I did make the marinade and dressing the night before to help save time.  Put fish in marinade morning of to soak all day, then after work, it was on the table within 30 minutes.  We loved it, it will be a part of our regular rotation.

I will not make them again, my kids and my hub didn't like them because of the weird flavor of the fish because of the marinate.   I was very disappointed. i will never say that this is a Mexican recipe or anything close.

Wonderful find! I've misplaced my favorite fish taco recipe. :( In searching for a substitute, this one caught my eye. Usually with fish tacos it's all about the sauce, but in this case the marinade is the star! I used Alaskan Wild Cod, b/c we don't eat Tilapia for all the environmental reasons. Any hearty white fish would work well in this recipe. My kiddos eat fish, but usually don't devour it. However, tonight we didn't have any leftovers and they were asking for more!

Great base recipe. I love the flexibility the variety of ingredients gives you. My Hispanic and Caribbean upbringing (sadly) cannot be silenced. I have a tendency to make every recipe my own. However, as mentioned this is a great base recipe. I used cod, I do not enjoy tilapia, just my opinion. Used flax, pita pockets mostly because that's what needed to be used. I baked versus grilling (I'm currently located in the Midwest and it's 31 degrees out). I'm looking forward to trying it on the grill. Marinade is full of flavor. Opted not to marinate overnight. Did not want the acidity to par cook the fish. I also did not cut the fish into pieces before marinating or cooking. I felt keeping the fish whole would help keep juices locked in while they rested after removing from heat, less chance of fish drying out. I used shredded broccoli and shredded carrots to make a slaw that topped everything off once assembled. I added ~1-1.5 teaspoons of cilantro to the dressing. I'm not a cilantro super fan but it's an odd must in some dishes but I usually omit or add a fraction of what is called for. No cheese. Cardinal Rule in this Caribbean chef's daughter's house; do not mix seafood with cheese. Again, personal preference. This couldn't come at a better time, Lent just started and I gave up take-out!

A great recipe that I use at least once a week. The marinade lends a wonderful kick of flavour to any fish. I often just poach the fish in the marinade, as it seems to absorb even more of the delicious flavour. I serve it with a chipotle slaw made with cabbage, green onions, carrot, Greek yogurt, and chipotle paste. So delicious! I prefer corn tortillas, but you must fry them in a wee bit of oil for maximum flavour.

This was very good. I used it as a base for my recipe. I made my own marinade due to time constraints and to make it easier. I just marinated for about 30 mins. I baked the fish as the recipe said. It was very good, the first time I have made fish tacos. I loved the dressing. I guess I tweaked that too. I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup  plain yogurt and added lime, cumin, salt , pepper, jalapeno and cilantro. It was so good! I bought a bag of shredded cabbage (again, I needed easy!) I quickly heated each tortilla in a hot pan with oil. It was really good and healthy. I would definitely make this again! Thank you for providing me with the inspiration to make a meal that was easy and tasty.

Theses were pretty good. I used plain yogurt instead of light sour cream and the tacos were ok but lacked a little "something". I will try using the sour cream and make my own seafood seasoning the next time I make it and compare.

This is the 5th time I've been back to this exact recipe because it's THAT GOOD!!   The marinade and sauce is just exceptional. Need to stop this review because I'm making this for company coming over tonight and need to get started. :-D

That sauce!! For me, it made everything come together perfectly. I used a simpler marinade (more of a rub) and pan fried my tilapia. If you go that route, suggest keeping tilapia whole in pan and cutting into pieces after it's cooked, otherwise, it tends to fall apart. I also combined the cilantro/tomatoes with some onion/cumin/garlic/salt/lime to make a quick pico de gallo. This was delicious! My family thinks I'm a star! :-)

The marinade came out perfect! I let the fish (bathed in the marinade) sit for a day instead of 6-8 hours because my Grandma already made dinner the first day I made it.  Everyone loved it! 

I messed up on the dressing, and it didn't turn out right unfortunately. Used a shrimp sauce called Dinni's Select: Spicy Shrimp Sauce instead and it was just as wonderful. Thank you so much for helping an amateur grill user make something amazing for her family!

The marinade was outstanding (I had to use lemon juice instead of lime and no zest), but I did not make the dressing. We topped with shredded cheddar, avocado slices, fresh cilantro, salsa, lettuce and sour cream. These were a hit.

this turned out very tasty.. it made me think of carne asada.. i made my own dressing for our fish tacos so my review is only for the marinade.. there were only a few modifications: cut the oil in half and used veggie oil, used half lemon half lime juice, left out the honey (we don't like sweet), and used hatch chile powder for the chili powder.. i cooked this on our gas grill we recently purchased.. it took about 15 min's on medium-high heat but i prefer a more dry/firm fillet than a moist/soft one.. ty so much for the recipe

This was delicious!!  I didn't read the recipe ahead of time to know that it needed marinating, so I just used the marinade and baked it in the oven.  Even my 2 year old loved it!  I didn't have the chipotle peppers so I used chipotle salsa and it was still delicious!.  I also made a cabbage salsa and homemade tortilla chips to go with it.  We will definitely be making this again!

My family says they don't like tilapia -- but after marinating overnight and serving with the special sauce, they said they wished there had been more!  Only thing we added was cheese as a topping.  Plenty of dressing left over so we may have to have it again.  I may try it with shrimp next time!

Loved the sauce and the tilapia marinade! We served the tacos with black beans, corn, and cabbage, and they were fabulous. I only had the fish in the marinade for an hour, and it was still super-tasty. Loved the kick from the sauce. Will definitely make this again.

I only used part of these instructions- i  made the marinade and then I made a corn salsa from another post- and it was amazing.   My husband said the fish was delicate and was restaurant worthy!

My husband and all three picky children devoured these! I didn't use the chipotle sauce though we used a sauce from a different recipe because I was afraid it would be to spicy. The marinade took the fishy taste out and made the meat absolutely amazing.

I loved this recipe. I followed it pretty much exactly as far as the fish and the sauce went, except I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream for the sauce. I also topped the tacos with a corn and black bean salad and finely chopped up some cabbage. I baked the fish in a pie pan on foil because I don't have a grill. Served it with warm corn tortillas. Boyfriend loved it. I loved it. Super yummy!

Wasn't quite sure whether to give this a 3 or 4 because I really didn't care for the dressing but loved the marinade. I went with 4 stars because I think it's just a matter of taste and not a flaw in the recipe. My husband and sons seemed to like everything including the dressing. One thing I changed is that I cooked the fish in the oven instead of the grill.

Loved the sauce.  I had never seen the peppers in adobo so I bought the can of chipolte peppers in adobo, ran the whole can through the food processor and used about 2-3  tbsp of the mix with the sour cream mixture.  Holy cow what a dynamic flavor.  Ate way too many tacos

This marinade was delicious.  We added extra lime juice to replace the vinegar, eliminated the hot sauce (for the kiddoes) and added lime zest.  My finicky five year olds gobbled these up!   Thank you for sharing a delicious and healthy recipe.

didn't have time to marinate. Left out vinegar, heated a skillet over high heat then added oil and cubed  fish, cooked about 3 min till almost done.  Took the marinade and poured over fish in skillet and  cooked 1min. Used mayo instead of yogurt for sauce.  Added Sriracha sauce instead of adobo sauce.  These were better then any restaurant  tacos!

The only changes I made was to add the sauce to the cabbage so it was like cole slaw, which was then put on top of the fish. Took it to a dinner and even the hesitant people liked it. I used powdered chipotle since it is what I have, and only used a small amount due to the previously mentioned hesitant people.

Fantastic! I'm so excited to have found a yummy grilled fish taco recipe, since I'm always on a diet and never fry anything. I did cut back a little on the adobo sauce and line juice. Thanks so much for the recipe, will make again soon! :-)

Just like a restaurant! Yum! I only had an hour to marinate but they were still delicious. I used the Adobe sauce with peppers, took the peppers out and used the sauce and it was fine, spicy but still great. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe! Will be making again.

We really loved this recipe; the marinade and sauce were spot on. I added more garlic as we are quite partial to it. I have tried both Tillapia and Ono (Wahoo) and it was perfect! Go crazy with the toppings. I am also thinking of trying Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning as a different flavor from Old Bay. Thank you Mabcat!

The marinade was awesome but I ended up with about three times more sauce than we really needed for the tacos. Oh, and it was very, very spicy!

I did not use adobe sauce but added hot sauce. I also left out the oil. Tilapia fell apart a bit. I cooked it in my wok pan. I used mayo instead of sour cream in the dressing, and also added hot sauce to the dressing. I did not use Old Bay or Adobe sauce in the dressing. They were a big hit with my 17 year old daughter. I paired them with homemade pintos, cabbage, a dad of cheese and the dressing. Definitely will do these again next week.

Loved this!  I mixed the cilantro, sour cream sauce & cabbage together- making it like a coleslaw.  I also added a corn salsa I found off allrecipes & these were DELICIOUS!
(I did omit adobo sauce & seafood seasoning.  I don't like a lot of heat & didn't have the seasoning.)

So good! I cut back on the oil in the marinade because wherever I can cut oil I will cut oil. Also, whenever I attempt to grill fish it usually falls apart so I pan fried. Very tasty and spicy!

I agree with everyone who loved this recipe too. The marinade is awesome, the fish can be eaten all by itself, the sauce can be a little overwhelming but is easily toned down with more sour cream. I can't wait to make this again.

Fixed this tonight. Loved it! The marinade and sauce/dressing were amazing and completed the perfectly cooked tilapia. . The flavored of the fish from the marinade were surprising. I love spicy and I  was surprised with the chipotle adobe sauce flavors. Loved it !

This is my go to fish taco recipe.  

Warning, I cut back on the adobo sauce in the sour cream...and just add a little at a time until I find the desired taste.

I've never grilled the fish and have made this meal probably a dozen times.  I've always just cooked on the stovetop on med high to give it a nice crisp on the outside, and just before the fish is done cooking I'll add a little of the marinade and let it cook for a couple of minutes to give the fish a nice, flavorful coating.  (This is mainly because I always forget how long the recipe says to marinate and only marinate for about 1/2 the time.)

If you want to cut back on the sodium, put less Old Bay...I typically put the amount in the recipe in the marinade, but do not add it to the dressing.

I also add extra garlic...we are garlic lovers in my house...yum!  We've used corn, flour, and whole wheat tortillas and enjoyed this recipe with all 3!

Marinade was great, dressing was over the top hot.  And I like hot.  Not kid friendly as written and my kid likes hot too.  The dressing needs revision even though the flavors are awesome; quantity adjustment is a must on the adobo sauce/ chipotle powder if you want to actually eat this.

This was excellent. My husband and 11 year old loved it. I used shrimp because I didn't have fish on hand and marinated it for about 3 hours, then roasted it at 400 for about 10 minutes. For the sauce I used Greek yogurt (though I think light sour cream would be better). I also used Siracha in place of the adobo sauce and used less than 1/2 cup. It was too spicy so I added a few heaping tablespoons of mayo and it tasted great.

The marinade for the fish has been my favorite. These fish tacos are the best. I made the chipolte sauce and it was way to hot, Instead i use a mango salsa recipe that i found on this site and it is fantastic!

Very very good! Didn't change much except omitted all of the adobe sauce and just added a few splashes of hot sauce to taste to the dressing. We like a slight kick but not too hot!  Also 1 pound of fish (I used Cod cooked in a cast iron skillet) is just enough for two people.

LOVE THIS DISH!!! I used chipotle salsa instead of adobo sauce and I only had balsamic vinegar. I only marinated the fish for 2 1/2 hours. Turned out great!! Now I try and make this at least once a month!!

It was "ok". Could have been my fish that had been frozen. Hubby and I ate but it didn't wow either of us. I was careful with the Adobe because I know that is HOT stuff and we like hot but let's not kill all our taste buds in one night.

Awesome. Loved the marinade and sauce. Used more lime in the marinade instead of zest. Strong lime taste (just how I like it). Used a blended chipotle pepper in some sauce. I would use more next time since I prefer it to be very spicy.

I thought the fish was good, but the sauce and corn tortilla combo completely overpowered it.  Together, it was only okay. My parents liked it, but I wasn't as happy as I thought i'd be with this recipe.

Perfect
I used cod (it was wild caught in the USA and the tilapia was from some 3rd world industrial waste pool) cut into strips about 3/4 by 2 or 3 inches and it didn't fall apart on the grill.  (My fear was that it would fall apart or fall thru the grill and we would be eating cabbage tacos instead).  Way more cabbage then we needed.  Anyone gotta good coleslaw recipe?   
I only marinated the fish for about an hour.   I have to wonder - wouldn't sitting in lime juce for 6 hours turn fish into ceviche?   1 hour was plenty and if anyone says the fish was bland the must have skipped the spices and lime or have some kind of taste disorder.   The fish by itself was terrific.   The sauce by itself was great.
Will make this again soon .

These were fantastic. I followed the marinade exactly, but after reading many reviews, I halved the lime juice in the sauce and left out the zest. Also, I believe it must be a misprint with the amount of adobo sauce called for. I used only one TEASPOON, and if it were any spicier, I would have been unable to eat it. I suggest starting out with a small amount first. I topped these with pico de gallo. Delicious, and I will surely make these again.

Lots of great flavor!  On the spicy side, so if you aren't into spicy, this is not for you - or at least back off on the adobe sauce.

I substituted the abode sauce with Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and a little hot sauce. And threw in the oven, other than that, everything was spot on and it was delicious!

I live for grilled fish tacos!  I discovered them 10 years ago when we moved to San Diego.  This recipe is my fav!  I do tweak it as the adobo peppers are just waaayyy too hot for me (and I adore hot spicy food) and I half the sauce recipe as it just makes too much.  Otherwise, the flavors are wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is better than ok, but the marinade and dressing seem disjointed.  The dressing is far too overpowering for marinade.  Overall, the recipe is good, but i will try a different recipe next time.

I didn't use the hot pepper sauce or Old Bay, and it still came out great.  Marinade and sauce were delicious!  If you have time to marinate it's certainly worth it.

WOW!  This was my first attempt at Fish Tacos and I am impressed!  These are super yummy!  The marinade was great!  I wound up broiling the fish chunks in the convection oven but that's the only change I made.

The marinade is good, but the lime in the marinade made the fish too soft.  I marinated it for about 1 hour after work because I wanted to make it for dinner. Next time I made bread it and fry. The sauce was good, but again too tart.  However, I loved the power taste of the chipotle.  I will definitely make again!

This made for a nice light summer meal.  I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and left out the adobe sauce.  Topped with shredded cabbage, monterey jack cheese, and tomatoes.  I think my cabbage was shredded too fine, as I thought the taco needed more crunch.  Kids didn't care for it.

The marinade for the fish is a total keeper!!  Delicious! But we were not fans of the chipotle/sour cream sauce.  No worries...next time we will just skip that sauce and use regular sour cream instead.

This was very different and really good. I used haddock and we loved the marinade. The adobe ingredient was harder to find but tasty. I pared down the heat.

As some other reviewers said, the marinade for the fish was great. I marinated it overnight. Since I wanted the fish grilled rather than bake, I used a grill basket. This way when one side is done, you just flip over the whole basket. The fish came out great.
I only gave it three stars only because of the sauce. I couldn't figure out how to make that better for my taste. Next time I'll just make cole slaw and try topping the fish with that. Maybe to keep it more Mexican style, I'll use the chili powder and cumin and lime juice in the cole slaw.

We used two cans worth of chipotles in adobo sauce (removing the chipotles, obviously) and we didn't find it too spicy at all - we also used greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Next time I will definitely double the recipe for the marinade as it did not make nearly enough, and the ingredients for the chipotle-lime dressing made about twice as much as needed. Super easy and extremely yummz. :)

Excellent recipe.   Cooking the fish that way really gives it extra flavor.   I couldn't get enough of the Chipotle-Lime Dressing.  I used the dressing left-overs on a salad.  YUM!

Excellent recipe! I now make this recipe at least once every few months. I've used a few different types of white fish and I usually use a bagged coleslaw mix, no dressing, for the topping. It's just right. Making your own Old Bay style seasoning is not so difficult. I used a coffee bean grinder to grind seeds and mix the spice melange. Now I save it is tupperware for the next time.

Made this is Cod filets--a meaty white fish. The whole thing made us think we were back ont he beach in Mexico. Its lovely lime-scented, chipotle aroma was great. We added a bit of sour-cream to the tacos upon serving. 

FYI--I found there was a bit more fluid produced after cooking the fish, so I simply poured it off before serving to make a drier taco. Otherwise you'd have really messy tacos! IMO.

This has become a regular in our household!  I have made it countless times.  Don't be afraid of the long list of ingredients, it's still easy.  If I don't have fresh limes I just use bottle juice (gasp!) and no zest and it still comes out great!  My picky 4 and 7 year olds love it and one even had 3 servings!  We serve it with the sauce, cheese, grated cabbage, avocado, olives, limes, jalepenos and red or green salsa.  We never use all the sauce, so I'd say to half that and double the fish if you want leftovers.

We used cod in place of tilapia and Mexican-style crema agria in place of light sour cream, skipped the Old Bay, added a little bit of good salsa verde, and used white corn tortillas. They were very good.

Delicious! Definitely making these fish tacos again! Such wonderful flavor. Though next time I will cut down the amount of sauce made, for not even half of the sauce was used by my family since it has only to do with our personal usage.

Delish!! Made these Christmas eve. I cooked the fish on the stove, searing the chunks. I also tamed the chipotle lime dressing by only adding 3 peppers chopped and I like heat! Tomatoes, avocado, cabbage rounded it out. My BF gave it 10 stars!!LOL!

Our tilapia was pretty fishy, not the recipe's fault, but I also wasn't fond of the sour cream dressing. Too smoky, not enough lime zing. I'll have to keep tinkering.

My family and guests loved this!  I had this in my recipe book for a while and finally decided to try it - a bit daunting because of all the ingredients and time.
Here are my tweaks:  Adobe sauce - you can substitute 1/w steak sauce and 1/2 hot sauce.
You don't need to marinate the finsh for 6-8 hours - 1 hour is plenty.
Fish generally sticks to the grill - we wrapped it in foil and stuck it on the grill - perfect!
Once I really looked at what needed to be done, it was really easy and DELISH!

I loved these fish tacos.  It was nice that they were grilled.  I'm thinking of keeping the fish whole because you marinate them a long time and even in a special grill pan they fell apart and into the grill.  The sauce had a nice kick without killing the tastebuds.  There is a TON left over.  I used a lot on the tacos too... but I am going to use the left over as a dip for some veggies.

It was interesting!  I liked how the fish came out but the sauce was....in need of tweaking I think.  Will make again with some changes to the sauce next time.

I usually make the fried version of fish tacos, but was looking for something more healthy and thank goodness I found this recipe.  It is a winner!!!  The marinade is perfect.  I used Mahi Mahi instead and it was a great fish to use on the grill.  I didn´t have any seafood seasoning, so I omitted it and it still tasted great.  I didn´t use as much adobe sauce as the recipe calls for, but it was perfect for our taste.

This was great! I wish I would have read the reviews first though. My husband loved every bit but it was was too spice for me. 
He had his with the sauce and I had mine with lime and the cabbage salad. Yummy.

Thanks mabcat, this was delicious!  I made it with halved sea scallops and shrimp, and it was wonderful!  Only had time to marinate 1 hour, still had a ton of flavor.  On the adobo sauce, I did use sauce from a can of chiles in adobo, but of course I didn't use anywhere near 1/2 cup.  I added a teaspoon at a time, probably used about 4 tsp. Had a nice kick but not so fiery as to mask the seafood.  Also, added a little queso fresco I had in the fridge as a final touch.  Delicious!

I altered the recipe so it would make for 2 servings. I loooved these but my partner only taught they were 'good' which is why I'm only giving them a 4. 
I remade the dressing with less adobo sauce so it wouldn't be as spicy and use it on sandwiches instead of mayo etc. Its great.

I prepared this recipe as written at least a half dozen times, with the exception of using fresh Yellowtail (my husband fishes and we have ALOT!)and it is fabulous.  The fish is moist, tender and flavorful and the sauce is fantastic. My husband and friends love and request this frequently.  I even received a thumbs up from a 2 and an 8 year old - minus the sauce - too spicy for them. I wonder if anyone has suggestions for an easy way to get 1/2 cup of the Adobo sauce out of the can without making such a mess....?  Thanks so much for the recipe!

For those who are lactose intolerant, here is a recommended adjustment to the sauce (this is also a result of lacking some ingredients): replace half of the adobo sauce with prepared horseradish, and replace the sour cream with approx. 1/4 cup beer. This is a pretty spicy mix, and sour cream can be added on top of the taco to help cut the spice a bit.

OMG! This recipe is awesome! If you're thinking about leaving the dressing out: don't! The combination of the marinated fish and the dressing is just awesome. I cut the dressing in half, though, and I had more than enough.

Loved these.  Awesome marinade.  I grilled on the stove in a grill pan and they were great.  Didn't put chipotle in the dressing, not a chipotle fan but used the other ingredients.  Thanks for a great recipe.  A definite keeper and I was a hit for the Cinco De Mayo dinner at my house.

Best fish taco's I've ever had! We used king fish instead of tilapia because that is what we had in the refrigerator and it turned out wonderful. Also, I was cooking for families with young children so I divided the dressing in two bowls and made it with and without the chipotle sauce. Both were great!

I gave this 5 stars due to the Marinade - as other reviews the marinade is OUTSTANDING!!!!  My family and I really loved the fish on it's own and have decided this is how we will cook any type of fish from now on.  As for the sauce we thought it was ok, but then again I had bought the Chipotle Peppers in the can by mistake which made it too hot.  We will try whole recipe again and willl recomment. Thanks for Sharing the recipe mabcat.

DELICIOUS!!  My 8 yr old daughter could not get enough!  I would double the amount of fish for 4 people as we didn't have any leftovers.  I didn't use the adobo sauce for the dressing, but used something called "mole verde" and added a little honey to it. I also had avocado and corn available for the tacos.  They were really, really good, and the fish was the best with using this marinade.  Who needs to go out for fish tacos when you can make them at home!!!

I only used the marinade for this recipe as I really like the chipotle slaw from another one on the site.  That chipotle slaw has just enough dressing in it and I didn't want to cover up the fish with a heavy sour cream.  This marinade is fantastic. Can't wait to try it with shrimp

Awesome fish tacos. Only marinated for 1/2 hour because I was short on time, and they were still very flavorful.  I used snapper, and it was great with the seasonings in this recipe. Can't wait to try again.

LOVED this recipe!  Will make again.  the Adobo sauce from chipotle peppers (comes in a can, we use the chipotle peppers for many other things), is a bit spicy and full of flavor, so we only added 1 tsp to the dressing.  The dressing was so yummy we saved the leftover for a veggie dip.  The marinade is delish - we used a different fish, but as long as you use a firm white fish, it'll come out well.  We use corn tortillas and slightly toast them in the pan on the stove.  YUM YUM YUM!

Delicious! The fish on its own is mouth-watering. The fish could be served on its own after marinating, or with the tacos. The sauce is great if you like medium spice, however if you like mild, I advise not using the sauce on it.

Something's missing.  Not quite sure...maybe it's not being topped with guacamole.  But I grew up in San Diego and am used to the Rubio's fish tacos.  (anyone from down south knows what I'm talking about) This recipe...I almost gave 2 stars, because they were just ho-hum.  The ONLY thing that I changed was I only had 1/4cup adobo sauce for the dressing, because that's all that I had.  The marinade smelled fabulous and it soaked overnight, but once the fish was cooked...it didn't taste as good as it smelled.  Darn!  I was anticipating making this for days.   Then when I finally made it, my girls flat didn't like it, and my husband also commented that "something is missing."  However, I can't put my finger on WHAT is missing....guacamole is the only thing that I can think of that might have "spiced" it up a bit.  So...my search for a kick-butt fish taco continues.........thanks anyway for the recipe.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was great! I baked the fish instead of grilling it and the fish was perfectly tender and moist. I don't usually like spicy foods but the amount of spice in the marinade and sauce on it was perfect! Defintely a keeper!

Love this recipe. It's become a family favorite and it's super easy. It's also perfect for a BBQ or event because everything can be made ahead of time.

I've never made fish tacos before, and now I make this once a week. Its so easy and so good! And if you don't use all the dressing you can make really tastey chillimac wit the left overs.

These are quite possibly the best fish tacos I've had.  The marinade is perfect, and the sauce is a great touch!  Well done.

I have only made the dressing as I have another mariande I like for my salmon.  But this marinade is great and goes perfect with fish tacos. I never added the adobe sauce (never had any) and I even used this dressing to put on top of my chicken, onion, pepper fajitas.  Yum yum yum!

I am absolutely in love with this marinade! I've gotten so many compliments on it and I think it makes the fish (or seafood- I like to use shrimp, too) taste fantastic! I love the idea of cooking down the marinade for the sauce- I haven't actually tried the sauce on this recipe because of the bad reviews! This is one of my go-to recipes- thank you, mabcat!

Excellent! We were looking for a recipe to make fish tacos with Whiting. This worked wonderfully, instead of lime we added lemon and instead of the suggested hot sauce we added sarachia (asian hot sauce).
Great recipe! Thank you so much!

This was delicious. I ended up going with the baked method, and the fish cooked perfectly. The sauce was also yummy.

This was an outstanding fish taco! I used Key Limes for the lime zest and juice so it was a little more labor-intensive. I also halved the Adobo Sauce... maybe even a little less than that. Instead of tilapia I used Snook, and after I marinated it (only able to marinate for about an hour and a half instead of the six in the recipe), I shook the fish off and dropped the chunks into a tempura batter and deep fried it. I also backed off a little on the Old Bay for the Sauce, and only used half what was called for. I used sliced Napa Cabbage instead of regular cabbage as it has a lovely flavor which really lends itself to the tacos! After all the lime preparation, thank goodness I have leftovers for tomorrow!

We use Rock Fish instead of Tilapia, marinated in strips not chunks....then grill with the marinade in a boat made of foil right on the grill.  You get  even more flavorful & juicy fish that easy pulls apart for making the tacos.  Haven't tried the dressing listed here, we use a different Cilantro Lime Dressing recipe that's a little lighter (1/2c sour cream, 1/2c mayo, bunch cilantro, 1/2 minced jalapeno, garlic to taste, 1/4t thyme, 1/4t pepper, 1/8t cumin, lime juice to consistency mixed in an immersion blender & chilled).

I made this for my husband and some friends and they loved it. I left the adobo sauce out of the dressing and it still tasted wonderful. I used halibut and baked it with all of the marinade. I will definitely make this again!

I used this to use up some extra Cole slaw.  Though I had to add some sugar to cut the vinegar taste back a bit.

This is a fantastic recipe!  Especially the marinade.  It has become a staple recipe in our house.  Anyone I've made these delicious tacos for loves them.  Instead of making the dressing, I also bring the marinade to a boil then reduce it.  It makes a fantastic sauce to put over your tacos.   I also top them with one of the pico de gallo recipes on this site.

my BF and I really enjoyed this last night! I used regular sour cream instead of light and only had less than 1/3 cup of chipotle adobo sauce. But I used some of the seeds from the chipotle can and it gave it a nice kick! BF said he definitely would enjoy making it again! SCORE!!

I didn't have the time to marinade, so I grilled the fish with marinade in aluminum pouches. It turned the marinade into a glaze that is good enough to eat without the dressing if you're not a chipotle fan. This meal was so delicious I signed up for allrecipes just to be able to rate it.

This sauce was great with some additions.  I added a little mayo, honey and only 2 t. of the adobo sauce, wow this is some strong sauce.  I also puree one half of avacado.  It was really delicious.  I do mahi mahi strips in panko crumbs, with cabbage, tomato, avacado and cilantro, a little oil and lime juice.

LOVED IT!  In an attempt to recreate a fish taco sauce that we tasted in a restaurant, I made this chipotle-lime sauce for my boyfriend.  He LOVED it! I didnt have the old bay seasoning, so i used tony cacheres instead.  It was an instant favorite!

Awesome, Awesome flavor!!!  The Chipotle flavor - that smokey heat is the key to this recipe.  The lime and sour cream counterpoint the chipotle perfectly.
This is now a summer favorite!!

WOW! I found this recipe yesterday and decided to cook it for dinner. I wasn't able to marinate the fish for the 6-8 hours it recommends but it was still awesome! I'm sure if I had the time to marinate it longer this would've been even better!! 
My family (3 big strapping guys) scarfed them down in no time. The only thing was the chipotle dressing I made to go with it. I haven't had much experience with adobo sauce and chipotle peppers so...I just added as much of the sauce I could get out of the can...let's just say it definitely had a kick or  punch to it. So watch out when you make the dressing. I also made a salsa from a recipe I found here on allrecipes.com, it had corn, black olives, tomatoes, and avocado in it. It was YUMMY as well. Other than the little too spicy chipotle dressing, this recipe was like a Pescado Fiesta in your mouth!!

Made this tonight and my family was apprehensive about the fish.  They were so happy with this meal, they raved about it all through dinner.  I followed the recipe closely except for the hot sauce.  Will be on the  rotation.

good, cooked fish in the oven, which was my only gripe. I should've broiled or gone out in the 20 degree winter and grilled the fish. Any sauce/marinade that has zest in it, is good in my book

Made this last night - awesome recipe and my guests loved them!  Question though regarding the nutritional info - 19 grams of fat - I can't imagine that is per serving ... perhaps for all 6 servings???  Curious.  Looking forward to making these again!

My whole family loved this receipe.  It's a good way to incorporate fish into the menu for those who don't usually care for it.  We didn't have chipolte peppers so my husband substitute chipolte buffalo wing sauce and it came out great!

I picked this recipe because I am trying to eat more fish and to eat healthier.  The flavor of the fish was wonderful and I was able to load up with the veggies which I love.  Thank you for sharing.

The marinade in this recipe is VERY tasty. I thought I could just marinade the tilapia for a few hours, but the fish hardly absorbed any of the taste.. Take the author's advice and marinade for the full 6-8. Since it's mainly olive oil and vinegar, I used it to saute the tilapia on my stove, and it gave the fish even more flavor. The chipotle dressing is also very tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy and amazing! I'm in university and just tried this recipe, and i have to say that it is delicious. I used this ingredients as a guide line for the marinade, and excluded the taco instructions all together, but with no consequence. Recommended recipe!

My son was haunting me to make Fish Tacos... I tried this recipe, along with the home made bay seasoning... I made 12 filets of Tilapia thinking this would be more than enough for two people.  I tried one with 1/2 filet; when I went back for seconds... there were none.  I was furious but here was my son with this lovely contented look on his face.  Such a great recipe.  Thanks!

My husband and I loved this!  I couldn't find Adobo sauce so I got some Adobo seasoning and added that to the sour cream along with about 1/2 cup chicken stock and 1/8 cup white vinegar and it turned out wonderfully.

The fish marinade was fantastic! I used only 1/4 cup sour cream and a couple tablespoons adobo sauce and still had some left over. The sauce was too spicy and I would reduce the amount of adobo sauce next time. A definate keeper!

The marinade is what makes the recipe special. I used it, cooked my fish exactly as instructed. But I added roasted veggies, cabbage, and a cilantro table cream topping made with table cream, cilantro, serrano peppers and tomatillo peppers.

this was so tasty! i didn't cut up the tilapia before grilling because it will fall right apart after it is cooked. i also used fat free sour cream for the sauce. thanks for this delicious recipe!

These fish tacos were great! I used Mahi-mahi and grilled the fillets after marinating. I cut back on the adobo sauce after reading previous reviews, and doubled the amount of sour cream. Dressing was still pretty spicy, but the tacos were a big hit!

made these a second time with Tilapia over the 4th of July and this recipe is now a family favorite and often requested :-)!

Full flavor, except I had problems with fish falling apart, I even preped the grill with olive oil. Will make again, just suggest a hardier firmer fish.

I think I used a little too much chipotle in the dressing, but over all the tacos were very good.  I will make them again.

Incredibly tasty and pretty easy.  I did reduce the adobo in the dressing (the can was small so I probably only got a couple TB) - lots of kick anyway!  Used cod, marinated for a couple hours and then dredged in corn starch, egg and then flour and pan fried for a little crispness.  Super good!

AWESOME!!! Made these this weekend and kids ate every bite.  None made it to fridge for left overs.  I did make a minor change.  Instead of fresh lime, I used "true lime".  Also didnt have adobo sauce for the dressing, so did without.  Still wonderful.  For the fish, I had whiting in the freezer, no tilapia, which probably would have been even better.  I will definitely make these again, possibly even using the marinade for chicken on shrimp.

This is good stuff! Spicy deliciousness even for non fish lovers. I didn't marinate the fish as directed, it was frozen fillets in a ziplock a few shakes and straight to the grill. Delish! Even my Mexican critic of a husband thought is was yum! Thank you i would never have thought fish tacos were really this good, but we enjoyed them a lot.

The chipotle sauce was a little much for me... I would leave it out. Other than that- these were very full of flavor. It might be too much for some, but I thought they were okay.

Loved this!!  I hate to cook and was thrilled with how well this turned out.  And it wasn't difficult to make!  My changes were few: cod; baked the fish; no adobo sauce.  Served it with cabbage, tomatoes, cheese, avocado, jalapenos, and cilantro.  My entire family enjoyed it!  I taste-tested the sauce with a chip and was tempted to just keep eating it that way!

A-m-a-z-i-n-g. Thank you! The chipotle sauce was about ten times more than I actually needed, but it was yummmmmmmmmmy. The adobo sauce was tricky to find, though. Read ingredients carefully on other sauces until I found one made with the right peppers. Will make again and again.

This recipe is definitely one of my favorites. The flavor is awesome. I don't have an outdoor grill at my place so I marinated the fish overnight and baked them at 375 for about 30 minutes. Just as good...

The fish was super scrumptious.  The sauce was good, but super spicy.  My husband loved it, but I could only use a tiny bit, even though I usually don't mind a bit of heat. Next time will only make half as much.  The only change I made was using lettuce in place of cabbage.

5 stars for the marinade - it was excellent, even without the lime zest or the old bay (didn't have either).  I only marinated it for about 6 hours, but think it would be better if marinated overnight - outstanding flavor for all kinds of white fish.  Tilapia was tender and delicious after marinating - I cooked it on the stove top by simmering the marinade first for about 5 minutes, then added the tilapia chunks and simmered, covered, for another 5 minutes. So good! I didn't try the sauce - instead used a chipolte cream from another recipe (sour cream, 2 chipotle peppers, a teaspon adobe sauce, and salt).  A definite keeper!

5 stars for the marinade! I pan fried the fish instead of grilling or baking, using the juices of the marinade and it gave it a great color and texture. Also topped with red cabbage, red onion, green onion, cilantro, gratted cheese, and hot sauce. next time I'll add avacado. didn't bother with the dressing.

Loved this recipe!!  I made it for my family for Valentine's day.  I made the Marinade exactly as recipe suggested.  I added chopped chipotle peppers in sour cream sauce, which made it quite spicy.  My family loved this!!!

Very good, I wish I had more time to marinate but I didn't. Next time I am going add an ever so  light coating of flour or something to get a bit of crunch. The dressing was fantastic.

These were pretty good. After reading many of the reviews though, I decided to play with the sauce measurements a bit.  Many people complained there was either too much lime juice and/or it was too spicy.  SO, I used the following in the sauce: 1 tsp. lime zest, 2 tsp. lime juice, and 3 tsp. Chipotle Tabasco sauce.  I thought this made the sauce delicious!  I prepared the marinade exactly as the recipe calls for but thought it actually had too much lime juice, as well.  Next time I will only use 1 tablespoon instead of two.  I topped the tacos with shredded cabbage, monterey jack, and a little bit of salsa. Overall, a great recipe and worth a try!

This marinade is AWESOME! I used Mahi Mahi because it was all i had on hand, and it turned out perfectly. I skipped the chipotle-lime sour cream and just used sour cream on its own, lime juice, and a little taco sauce. Oh, and diced avocado, which is a MUST. Delicious - this will be my go-to fish taco recipe for sure.

Best fish tacos I've ever eaten.  I double the spices in the marinade.   The dressing was a little too spicy and I love spicy food.  I will scale down the cayenne in the dressing next time.  I used baby greens instead of cabbage which turned out better the ever.

This was quite excellent! The only substitutes I made were seafood rub instead of Old Bay and I didn't use the adobo sauce only because I couldn't find any. It was delicious and I will be sure to make this again.

The only ingredient that I wasn't able to obtain from the store was the adobe sauce from chipolte peppers. Instead, I used a bit of frank's and chulo hot sauce. I really didn't care for the dressing or marinade that came of it. The taste of the fish especially when grilled was good and also went well with finely sliced cabbage and tomato. Nice idea but wasn't quite what I was looking for.

This is the best marinade we have ever had! I even cook down the marinade while the fish is cooking and use it as a sauce. Seriously good stuff. The sour cream sauce is amazing, but I will caution you to go WAY back on the chipotle adobo in the mix. It calls for 1/2 a cup, but holy moly, that's a lot. We do it to taste, which is about 2 tablespoons, to half the sour cream (Because the recipe as written gives way more than we use). The lime makes it awesome, brightening the whole thing. We have made this multiple times, and it's always a big hit.

This was wonderful, even my husband thought so. I used Ling Cod cooked on the bbq instead of the tilapia which is a firm fish, the marinade and dressing we thought were great. Only other change was I didn't have chili powder or adobo sauce so used tapiato sauce to replace it. This a recipe worth keeping!

I thought this was fantastic!  I only made a few changes.  I cut back a little on the chipotle sauce and added a little honey to the sauce.  I mixed the sauce with the cabbage ahead of time to make a slaw and worked really well. Everyone loved it!

I'm really glad I found this recipe.  I have made these for my family and friends, and everyone loves them.  I like to use the stand-n-stuff hard shells instead of the soft, I like the crunch.  I have tried these with four diffent types of fish and it is different and awesome evrytime.  Love the dressing.

I made these fish tacos for a few of the neighbors at a dinner get-together.  It was a big hit, everyone loved the tilapia.  Served it with cilantro-lime rice.  Fun meal and easy.

Wonderful, I LOVE fish tacos and made this with mahi mahi tuna. The only thing I didnt have was adobo sauce and had no clue what to replace it with, so my sour cream mixture was a bit bland. My own fault though. We had other stuff on hand to put on the tacos, and they were just deelish.

Excellent marinade! We did not make the chipotle-lime dressing and instead put sour cream and avocado on them with all the regular taco fixings.

I used Swai Fillet and it turned out really good. My boyfriend loves this recipe. It's good for a hot day, it's light yet filling.

If I could give more than 5 stars I would!!! We did this for a nieghberhood cook out. We used halibut and sea bass OMG it was the best! Only changed the sauce a little bit. Nieghbors told me they had chipolte sauce... turned out to chipolte tabasco. I put quite a bit in there probably 1/4 the bottle still was REALLY REALLY good!! Will definatly make this again!!!

We loved these!  Very light, fresh dinner.  I marinaded for about an hour then cooked the fish with the marinade on the stove.  I made the dressing too, which we enjoyed, but didn't use any adobo.  Served with mango-lime rice.  Great, healthy dinner!  Thanks!

I'd use the marinade again, but skip the rest.  Unfortunately, I opted to use a sturdier fish to grill these on skewers - had never had cobia before and don't think I'll try it again.  Marinade would be good with a milder fish, but one that's a little more firm than tilapia.  Opted out of the sauce - too many flavors/spices winds up overpowering the main attraction.  Thanks for letting me try.

DELICIOUS! Healthier option:  Reduce oil in the marinade to 1 Tbsp and use fat free or low-carb tortillas.  With these modifications, I will definitely make this recipe again.

These were awesome. I had a hard time getting the amount of adobo sauce the recipe called for from the can so I pureed some of the chipoltes too - bad idea, wayyy too spicy! So we had to use the sauce really sparingly, but they tasted great.

I fixed these for our Cinco de Mayo dinner and everyone loved the tacos, however we didn't care for the dressing, it had way too much lime for us.  I will continue to use the fish recipe-it was awesome, but will look for a different dressing recipe.

Fantasic Marinade, the Sauce the Goes with it is not as good though.  In fact I would just drop the sauce, marinade the fish, and simply make traditional tacos out of it in the future.

We've never had fish tacos, so I searched and found this recipe.  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of reducing the cumin (not a huge fan).  Marinade is scrumptios and works very well with tilapia.  Followed the advice of other reviewers and skipped the sauce opting for Amy's Cilantro Sauce from this site and it was a wonderful meal!  Thanks!

The sauce is so good! We did add a little more adobo sauce just to make it a bit spicier though and I used fresh halibut from Alaska. Amazing!

We made this for company that came in from out of town and it was a hit. No leftovers! I had to change the dressing and use green chiles, since they did not like spicy food. I have made it both ways and they are equally great. 
I bought shredded lettuce (since I was not to sure about the cabbage) and cabbage; and the cabbage ended up being the favorite.

I agree that the marinade is fantastic. I actually had it marinating for a couple of days. This was actually an accident because we were going to have it one Sunday night and the night escaped us. So I made it the next night. It was perfectly marinated. However the dressing was way to spicy. (& I love spicy food!) I would definitely eliminate the adobo sauce next time. There is enough spice with the cumin and chili pepper. Maybe add a little mayonnaise as well as sour cream. I served it with a broccoli slaw mix and diced tomatoes. I like the idea of avocadoes, I will use that next time.

These were very, very tasty; the dressing was fabulous.

I give it 4 stars because I messed up the tilapia marinade..I added the pepper sauce to that marinade and it ended up being too hot for my bf's tastes.  I LOVED IT, however.

I used bagged cole slaw mix instead of coring a cabbage...mmm...

Also added 1/4 c black beans and used low carb tortillas and fat free sour cream.

DELICIOUS!

This marinade is amazing!! My husband and I couldn't get enough of them.  I didn't make tacos or the dressing, just marinated the tilapia fillets all day and then cooked them on an electric griddle.  They were delicious with my favorite avocado corn salad.  We'll definitely make these often!  Next time we want to try the dressing too.

YUM!  This recipe was delicious and really fresh.  The only thing I changed was adding shredded cheese to my taco out of personal preference.  Simply out of this world delicious!!  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!

I didn't get a chance to taste the fish as I made both this grilled recipe and panko breaded tilipia.  The grilled was gone so fast!  I was told it was great.  The sauce was excellent!  I couldn't find adobo sauce so I added tapatio hot sauce until it tasted spicy enough.  Great recipe.

The marinade for the fish didn't really come through for me. The only thing I got out of it was the sweetness of the honey, which I actually did not care for.  I will probably just omit that step next time. The white sauce has some great flavor, with lots of depth to it.  Will definitely use it again.
