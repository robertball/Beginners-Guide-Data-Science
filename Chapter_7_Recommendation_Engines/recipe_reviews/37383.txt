Served this at a luncheon.  Even those who don't normally like salmon helped themselves to seconds!  This is the best salmon recipe I've tried.

I'm just starting to cook salmon, and this is by far the best tasting recipe I've come across.  The horseradish adds a good punch to this marinade, which is fantastic.  I served it with some rice and dill, with a nice Pinot Grigio wine and tossed salad.  Total cooking time = 40 minutes, and easy cleanup to boot.  Can't go wrong with this one!

I expected to like this recipe, as I am a fan of soy sauce and ginger and orange juice and salmon. But even I was surprised - this was absolutely delicious. Highly recommended.

My husband and son raved about this dish. I even misread the recipe and used plain horseradish instead of horseradish mustard ... and I've continued to make it that way, because it's so tasty!  No need to cook the left-over marinade for a sauce, or even to baste with it ... doesn't need it.  My favorite salmon recipe.

Superior recipe that's tasty, fast and impressive.

I didn't have horseradish mustard on hand and substituted fancy mustard.  Still tasted great!  I also used freshly squeezed orange juice, and think this added to the flavor.

Highly recommended!

DELISH. I let this marinate for about 2 1/2 hours and it was fabulous. I used tuna steaks and prepared it the same way....so delicious...

This recipe was nice, but not overwhelimingly fantastic. I suspect it is delicious grilled, however. I had to do the salmon in a pan over the stove, and it didnt' quite have the same texture, taste and consistency one would imagine the grilled version would have. I would try this again, but only grilled! (my boyfriend did love it this way, however)

I marinated longer than 30 min and thought the  flavor was OK, but wouldn't rush to make again.  I broiled it as well.

Very easy to make, and it was delicious.  We are saving our leftover Marinade and making it again tomorrow.  It is not too sweet and has a great Japanese flair from the ginger.

My family loves this recipe.  I've already made it three times this month.  The only change I've made is to add a dash of hot chili sesame oil for a little more zing!

This remains my favorite salmon recipe - and I've made it several times since I first discovered it in 2004. We recently made it with many substitutions, mainly due to lack of horseradish mustard, and it came out as wonderful as always. Also: the left-over, reduced marinade worked great as marinade/sauce for steak the next day! You should try it.

I will for sure make this one again! There was only time for about 25 minutes of marinade time and it was still just delicious.  Because of what I had on hand I used a squirt of prepared mustard (I'll have to find out what horseradish mustard IS!) low sodium soy sauce, ground ginger spice, and a bit more o.j. than called for.  We loved it!

This was deeeeelicious. Since I don't have a grill, I baked the salmon for 20 minutes at around 360 degrees Celcius. As well, I used dijon mustard instead of horseradish and powdered ground ginger instead of freshly ground. My housemate and I were fishing around for a salmon recipe and decided to go with this one and boy were we glad we did. Loved it.

I marinated this for about four hours. I tripled the marinade recipe because I was making 6 servings and wanted to have plenty of sauce to go around. This was very delicious and got rave reviews. It also looked very pretty garnished on the plate. I served it with Bok Choy Salad (from this site) a cucumber salad and roasted potatos.

Terrific recipe - I got rave reviews. I used salmon filets and cooked over low heat. Next time I'll double the marinade so we have extra yummy sauce. A definite keeper.

Before this recipe, I thought salmon was wretched...now, I can't get enough of it!  We used stoneground mustard with horseradish and a little ginger than called for, but it was a SMASHING success.

The frozen cut of salmon I ended up bringing home smelled a little, well, fishy, upon thawing.  I was concerned about it having a negative impact on the recipe, but we proceeded anyway.  This recipe made this lesser quality slab of fish taste like it was 4 or 5 star quality!  The piquant quality of the marinade defused the not-so-fresh flavor, but still allowed the good flavors of the salmon to shine through.  And the marinade was so easy, my husband was able to put it together by himself!  Thanks for the recipe!  Hubby will be making this one regularly ;)

Great weeknight salmon recipe.  I only marinated for 30 min, and it was great.  I was sure to drizzle remaining marinade over fish and rice. (Also, I didn't have horseradish mustard, so I used a bit of both horseradish and dijon)

This was excellent--definitely a keeper! We  even had to improvise--we had to use canned salmon and we mixed the marinate in with the salmon and spooned the combination over the rice. My entire family loved it!

Good, but I've made tasted better.  I let the salmon marinate over 24 hours, then grilled on an outdoor grill.  I could barely taste the marinade, though.  Seems to me that the salmon should have picked up some of the marinade flavor more.  Oh well.

Excellent. I got rave reviews for this one. The longer you let the fish marinate, the better it comes out. Oh, I baked the fish instead of grilling at it came out great nevertheless.

I added some more O.J. to this recipe.  I think frozen concentrate would be better.  2 younger children liked it but my oldest didn't care for it too much.  Overall, it was good!

Delicious!  We have been making a very good grilled salmon recipe for a few years, but thought I would like to try something different and am so glad I found this recipe. I don't know if it makes a difference, but I marinated it for several hours.  No doubt, this is a keeper!

Very good!  I would give it 5 stars, but the rest of the family voted for 4 stars.  I admit I didn't grill it,but used the broiler instead.  I will update when I try it on the grill.  I did use liquid aminos instead of soy.  It has less sodium and a lot better for you. I thought the sauce was delicious.  I served it with brown rice. Thank you for an easy recipe.
