My family LOVED this marinade! Where I changed things: 1) I forgot to buy fresh thyme so I used 1Tbs of dried and 2) my limes were kinda small so I used three.

Some of the reserved sauce is in the fridge and I'm thinking it would be good on veggie wraps this weekend.

I used this marinade and the meat was wonderful. But I used this marinade for shrimp to make my favorite shrimp taco (all ingredients except thyme) and it worked too. The dish was absolutely great. I think you can use for chicken too, not only for flank steak.

Awesome marinade...best fajitas I've ever made...I think even better than in restaurants.  I didn't add all of the oil, used some broth in place (watching the diet) and it was still awesome.  Used for fajitas and topped with a little sour cream-Delicious!

Very, very vibrant and fresh flavors. I served this with a saffron rice pilaf and everyone was spooning more of the marinade to mix and eat with their rice.

Both my boys and my husband loved this steak.  I would have liked it to have a bit more of a lime taste, so maybe I'll marinate it overnight next time.  If that doesn't work, I'll add more lime!

I used this marinade on some chicken wings for the BBQ and it came out really good. I'll use it on steak next time. Thanks for the recipe.

Very, very good! I added the extra jalapeno to make it spicier. We used the leftover steak and marinade the next day for sandwiches and it was good in that too!

I could drink this stuff it's soooo good!  I use it on everything--all cuts of steak, pork and chicken.  The aroma alone is intoxicating.  It is hands down my favorite marinade.

Easy. Delicious! Made steak fajitas and drizzled the reserved marinade (I think it's safe to call it a chimichurri sauce) on top. I followed the recipe and used the honey even though I'm not a honey fan.....didn't 'ruin' anything...and perhaps added a little somethin' somethin'. Best fajitas ever....commented by my husband.

Incredible. This recipe is awesome! I sub brown sugar for honey, sometimes and always add lots of ground cumin, but this is tremendous anyway. I use this as a marinade for fajitas... God Bless YOU!!

This will be a 5 next time I make it and add more heat!  Delicious flavors and super easy!!  My hubby and I just like it spicier (and I used 2 jalapenos and a little bit of cayenne).  Will try a hotter pepper or more cayenne next time!  Cannot wait to use on chicken, and fish tacos!!

This really surprised me.  I had to add a little extra lime, and in tasting by itself was not too thrilled with the sweetness of the honey.  But I used on both flank steak and chicken and it was great.  Everyone complimented and thought they were two different marinades.  Next time want to try Serrano peppers to give more of a kick.

We made this for a New Year's Eve dinner. It was outstanding. We used the put aside marinade for a sauce, and it was delicious. The only thing we did differently was add some cumin to the marinade.

Delish! Only difference was that I was only able marinade for a half hour instead of overnight. It was still good but I think this would have been better if marinated for longer. The sauce on top was to die for. Will definately be making this again!!

This was DELICIOUS!!! It ended up marinating for almost 2 days, but was still great! Grilled it up quick and then used it with sauteed onions and peppers for fajitas! So good!! 
Thanks for the recipe!

LOVE THIS! Can't get enough of it! It reminds our family of one of our favorite vinaigrettes in a Mexican restaurant we dined at frequently in Los Angeles. Excellent on the steak and just as good as a salad dressing especially for a steak salad! We have been looking for a recipe like this! A definite keeper and will be a favorite summer marinade.

Yielded a very juicy, herby-tasting meat, quite good. Would suggest scoring the meat before marinating to allow it to penetrate further, and make sure you cut properly against the grain -- didn't do that and oops, that's a chewy meat for fajitas.

This was pretty yummy. I did not feel like starting up the grill, so instead I cooked it on the stove top. I also love garlic so I added some of the garlic part of the marinade to cook it in. It was soooo yummy!! We cut it up afterwards and ate it in tacos and burritos. I will be making this recipe again!

So Yummy!!!!  I decreased the amount of oil (and used olive instead of corn) to 3 tbs.  I used a little more honey to cut the lime flavor but other than that, this is delicious to use for fajitas, in corn shells, or grilled and put on a salad.

Yummy!! Great fresh and summery marinade!  My husband and I are not fans of cilantro, so I omitted it.  Also used dried versions of the other herbs.  Marinated a cheap and usually tough cut  of steak for about 2 hours in the fridge.  Made the steak so tender and juicy I could not believe!  5 stars!!

This was awesome!!!  I made it exactly as written and it was fabulous.  I think I actually like it better as a sauce than a marinade - I mixed it in with coleslaw, put in on a sandwich, put in with eggs...it was sooooo good!

I tried this on round steak, as it was all I had in my freezer at the time, and wasn't sure how it would turn out.  It was amazing! I marinated it over night and it was so tender!  It was perfect for fajitas.  We've also tried this on chicken and it was great.

This was really good.  I used a skirt steak and sliced into strips after marignating.  Great fahita meat.  Will try on a flank next.

The reason why I am giving 4 stars is because I substituted the jalapeno pepper for red pepper flakes and the honey for some Splenda.My husband and I really like it. He said "make this when our son comess from college"!!

This marinade rocks!  I'm not really sure how some of the reviewers were only able to taste onion, unless they put too much in, but this stuff is great.

I have used red, white, and yellow onion and only put a 1/2 an onion in each time.  Kicking up the garlic and using a whole head really makes a difference as well.

I have used this on steak and it was wonderful, but using it on chicken is amazing.  

I double or triple the recipe so that we have plenty to use as a sauce. 

Play around with the marinade, but the combo of fresh lime juice, cilantro, garlic, and some peppers for heat, make this a winner.

Awesome recipe! We loved it. I used it for fajitas and it was excellent. The best fajitas I had ever made at home! I didn't reserve any of the sauce, just poured it all in the bag and let it marinate over night. The only change I made was that I didn't have any thyme.

Excellent combination for a steak marinade. Very flavourful. I left out the honey and used avocado oil (personal preference to not use corn products). I used the steak in a fajita salad. Mmm.mmm. Thanks Ryan Nomura

The meat turned out really well, very juicy. The marinade was not very good. Had a moldy type flavor to it. All my ingredients were fresh so it wasnt that. I guess I am not the lime/cilantro type of marinade guy.

Thank you! OMGoodness...this is by far the BEST thing we have made from this site...our entire family loves it. It is the most flavorful, juicy, delicious thing. We eat it just sliced up with sides...but it would be great on fajitas too. We just couldn't imagine mixing its greatness with any other flavors. If there were 10 stars on here to give...you'd get them. KUDOS!!!

Had steak fajitas for dinner tonight and this was fabulous!!  Actually fixed it indoors on a grill pan (as week night and not enough time to heat up the outdoor grill) and it worked great.  I just brushed the pan with oil and seared at high heat.  The fact that the marinade was a greenish color (similar to pesto or guacamole) surprised me, but the flank steak retains the flavor, not the color.  And the flavor is amazing!  I drizzled the extra sauce into my fajita, and even used some as salsa for chips (a sweet salsa, but a good one!).  Thanks for the recipe -- it's a keeper!!  [Update: Just made again and cut the oil to 1/4 cup.  Still tastes great!].

AWESOME recipe! I made this with flank steak for Mothers Days and it was such a huge hit that I was asked to make it again for our Memorial Day BBQ. I also marinaded some jumbo shrimp in it and made kabobs. Delish!! We like our food spicier than normal so I used serrano chiles instead of jalapenos. Will definitly make this again.

This wasn't horrible, but considering all of the ingredients, I was expecting more.  The Marinated Flank Steak recipe on this site is much better.  I won't bother with this one again.

This was an awesome recipe! I changed two things - I left out the honey to make it SB diet friendly, and I used olive oil instead of corn oil. Marinated strip steak in the refrigerator for 2 hours, then grilled. Served sliced over a ceaser salad - superb! Thanks1

Great recipe. Marinaded overnight and was delicious. Made this for cinco dinner with friends for fajitas--just rice, beans and cheese in a flour tortilla and green salad. Add your favorite salsa--it was easy.

Great for fajitas. To cut marinating time I used strips of beef & marinated for 2.5 to 3 hours. Cooked up some peppers and onions and then added a little of the reserved marinade to them after cooking and to the beef strips after they were cooked. Best fajitas I ever made....reminiscent of Jack Astor's

Very good.  Flank is one of my favorite cuts of beef when cooked right and this marinade and sauce added great flavor without overpowering the meat itself.  I did add some extra lime juice and didn't have a jalapeno on hand so I went without it.  Served with the Quinoa and Black Bean recipe also on this site and the two went very well together.

The marinade was awesome! I'm curious though why it specified Flank Steak. 
There was a lot left over and i'm thinking of cutting up tomatoes and turning it into a salsa.

We really liked this marinade and did not find it to be chunky or the meat tough at all. The flavor is surprisingly subtle, which is great for those who don't want to overpower the meat.  We just ate the steaks as is, but I think next time I will probably use this for fajitas and add another pepper.

This is an excellent recipe for Flank Steak.  To the reviewer who said it was too chunky - you obviously didn't puree the ingredients properly because the definition of puree is a thick liquid suspension made from cooked food ground finely.  If Flank Steak is cut across the grain it won't be tough unless you overcooked it.

This marinade is a good start but it needs something more to give it a more complex flavor.  All we tasted were onions and cilantro.  Maybe it needs more honey since we couldn't even tell there was any sweetness at all. Way too chunky from the onions and garlic even after being pureed. Overall, not a bad start, it just needs something more - and why use corn oil when olive oil is so much better?

There is nothing better than a flank steak grilled medium-rare on the BBQ but this recipe ruined an otherwise great piece of meat in my opinion.  All we tasted was the onions and it make the meat tough.  Will not make again.

This was excellent!  I didn't have jalapeno so added a few drops of El Yucateco habenero sauce.  It was outstanding.  We will try it with jalapeno next time.

I wasn't a fan of the sauce.  Even though I blended it, it was very thick.  Overall, it was "ok".

I deleted the Thyme and put Cumin & instead and instead of Chili powder I use Aji Amarillo paste. I made extra and only used half for marinate and the other half I added alittle mayo as a dipping sauce for the steak and fried yucca.

Altered it slightly, using a blend of avocado and olive oils and used habaneros instead of jalapenos. Came out great tasting!!

This is a great recipe!  

Easy to make in minutes.

The only thing we added was some lime zest as we prefer our marinades limey:)

I didn't add a red onion and I didn't have time to marinate it overnight (only for about an hour and a half) but it was delicious.  Everyone loved it, kept walking back past the plate to pick up another piece.  Rave, rave reviews.  I put all the marinade in the bag with the steaks since I had limited marinade time.

This made for some of the best tasting grilled steak.  I used all the ingredients in the recipe, tasted the marinade and adjusted for our taste buds.  Definitely keeping this one!

I am giving this a 5 because the marinade is versatile.  I made this for my boyfriend a few months ago and we both really liked the flavor, but agreed that it tasted similar to something we'd had before.  Finally, we figured it out....a spicy pasta salad dressing.  The other day I used the marinade recipe and made an amazing pasta salad.  I added more jalapenos than called for and used onion powder because I didn't have any onions on hand.  If you make it too spicy just add a little extra honey or brown sugar to cool it off a bit.  I used rotini pasta, cubes of coldy and cheddar cheese, grilled chicken and diced olives.  It was even better cold the next day where I added some turkey bacon to give it a little crunch.

We had this for a neighborhood "Ocho de Mayo" party. It was a hit and we will all do it again, definitely.  I pounded the flank steak then marinated it overnight.  We tend to like our food a bit more spicy, so this could use a little more fresh jalapenos w/ the seeds.

Wow!  This was fabulous!  I didn't change a thing.  At first I thought that the grilling time was too long however I had to keep adding minutes and actually grilled it for the recommended amount of time and it was medium rare.  Many repeats to come on this one.

I think I would have liked this better without the honey.  Also, I like my food SPICY so next time Ill use more jalapeno.

We've used this on flank steak and for fajitas.  I passed the recipe to a friend who grilled it with London Broil for a dinner party.  It was a huge hit for us and for my friend.  We plan to try it next with shrimp.

Great recipe. Easy and quick to make.  I used English steak instead of flank steak and ground thyme instead of fresh thyme. I will make this again and share this recipe with family and friends.

This is going to be one of our favorites from now on.  I used large garlic cloves and doubled the cilantro, just because we love it, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was wonderful sauce for the flank steak.
