I used non-fat sweetened condensed milk and half and half instead of the heavy and light cream.  Excellent!!...and that's coming from someone who's favorite ice cream is Baskin Robbins Rocky Road!

We love this ice cream.  Since getting my ice cream maker last Christmas, I've discovered that we prefer ice cream made without eggs over the kind you make with eggs (more of a "custard").  The kind without eggs taste like Bryer's ice cream.  This is, actually, better than Bryer's!  I use chocolate covered almonds (like in Bryer's rocky road) in place of the pecans.  An excellent chocolate ice cream by itself (with out nuts and marshmallows) and can be used as the base of any chocolate based ice cream.  Try it, you'll love it!

Great Taste. I tried the marshmallow crème like someone else on here had suggested and it didn't work well. It stayed in one big hunk instead of swirling throughout the ice cream. Next time we will use mini-marshmallows. We used half and half instead of heavy cream to cut out some of the fat. Made the ice cream a thinner consistency, but after freezing it hardened up and tasted great. This recipe also makes a perfect amount of ice cream. I used my Kitchen aid ice cream maker.

I LOVE this recipe!!!  I make it about 3 times a month, more if I have company. I replaced the heavy cream and light cream with fat free half and half, and the condensed milk with the fat free version.  This makes a great ice cream base.  I make mint chocolate chip (just the half and half, sweetened condensed milk, 1/2 tsp peppermint extract & shredded dark chocolate), chocolate peanut butter, chocolate chip cookie dough (using the cookie dough for ice cream (eggless) recipe from this site), and birthday cake flavor (by adding about 1c. white cake mix, dry, and gradually stirring in the hot condensed milk, then add in the half and half and vanilla).  This recipe has so many possibilities!  So easy to adapt to delightful guiltless fat free/ low fat ice cream.  Perfect egg free ice cream, THANK YOU!

After a rocky start (no pun intended), the way this turned out was a pleasant and lucky surprise! As this was churning, it just didn't want to set up as it should and I thought I might be making a trip to the grocery store for the dessert I needed for dinner guests I was having tonight. Even tho' it wasn't nearly as firm or frozen as it should have been, I went ahead and added the pecans and marshmallows anyway, crossed my fingers and hoped for the best. I have no idea why, but several hours in the freezer later, it turned out just fine -  smooth, rich and delicious with perfectly balanced chocolate flavor and level of sweetness. I served this in chocolate shells with a drizzle of chocolate syrup and an extra scatter of mini marshmallows and pecans.  It was beautiful. And my guests were pleased. (I'll bet one would even have licked her plate if no one was looking)

I love rocky road ice cream but it is very hard to find in the grocery stores here in Toronto.  I was a bit concerned with some of the reviews saying that this was not too chocolately but it turned out PERFECT.  This is a great recipe.  I adjusted the recipe to make 8 servings and used macadamia nuts instead of pecans because I didn't have any pecans or almonds in the house.  I was a bit worried about heating the condensed milk and cocoa powder because it wasn't doing much on low heat but it turned out great.  I added chocolate chips halfway through and the nuts and marshmallows closer to the end.  I think I will put all the "bits" at the very end next time because I like chewy marshmallows.

Brilliant!  For an American who is missing Rocky Road ice cream in a country that doesn't do Rocky Road, I LOVED IT!  It is soooooooo rich and it was perfect.  WONDERFUL chocolate flavor.  I was hugely impressed!  Not cheap for us to make however but well worth it.  We don't have light cream in this country so I used milk and butter instead.  I may try subsituting with evoporated milk in place of the heavy cream next time too.  But definitely a keeper and it made my first time enjoyable and I look forward to making it again.  Now should I share with my family????

This ice cream is FANTASTIC!  It was my very first attempt at making homemade ice cream, and I decided to try it because my husband loves rocky road.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the end result is so creamy and yummy, it's amazing.  I'd say it's on par with anything you can get in the store (think Edy's, Breyers, etc).  I bought a package of chopped pecans, and also put in 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips.  I have to say it again, it's SO GOOD, this isn't going to last long in our house!

This was very creamy and tasted pretty good however if you are looking for an ice cream with a strong chocolate taste, this isn't it.  Other than that, pretty good.

This is my first homemade ice cream in my new Cuisinart ice cream maker. This is so creamy, smooth and rich! It is very similar to Braum's chocolate frozen yogurt in texture and flavor. I used 2 cups half 'n half and 1 cup heavy cream. I also omitted the vanilla, nuts and marshmallows because I just wanted to chocolate ice cream. I also upped the chocolate by about 2 TBS. It soft set in about 25 minutes and was delicious! This recipe is luscious, rich and smooth.

Delicious and very easy to make.  Made for 4th of July, it was loved by all.  Made the cream the night before, let sit for almost 24 hours (always do this w/ homemade, it enhances the flavor).  Got cream going in electric IC maker, added nuts & marshmallows 10 minutes into it.  After 25 min it was ready, and great!

We LOVE this ice cream!! We leave out the nuts and marshmallows for a nice chocolate base. Mmmm!  And, I use 2 cups half and half and 1 cup whole milk... turns out great and a little healthier. ;-)  If you leave the ice cream as soft-serve stage, I think it tastes like a Wendy's frosty. If you transfer from machine to freezer for a hard ice cream stage, I think it tastes like a fudgsicle.   The only ice cream we make! 5+++stars!!

FINALLY,, a homemade ice cream recipe that is both easy and delicious. I first made it using coconut milk instead of the cream and it was delicious... this is an excellent base  if u leave off the chocolate,, I just made strawberry ice cream by leaving out the chocolate, using milk instead of cream and adding about a cup of pureed strawberries,, YUMMY, my son says it is better then store bought.. I am planning peach ice cream next and it is so easy to make, if ur not using cocoa u don't have to even heat anything,, THANK you for posting this...I see a lot of different ice creams in my future..

I've been making ice cream with my 2 qt cuisinart ice cream maker for a couple of years now and this is by far the best recipe I've tried. This was the first time I've used the sweetened condensed milk and no eggs. I think I'm going to adapt this technique to all future recipes. The ice cream came out rich and thick and still scoopable. The texture was perfect, too. It was so easy blending the chocolate this way versus the double boiler and chunk chocolate. 
I would compare this to ice cream I've had at some of the more premium ice cream shops, e.g. the Marble Slab or Haagen Daaz.

Oh my goodness!  This was the best homemade chocolate ice cream ever.  I used 1 can of condensed milk in place of the 1 cup of light cream and it worked out well.  I did cut up the marshmallows into smaller bits so that they would distribute more evenly.  Some homemade ice creams aren't as good after they've been in the freezer for a day or two, but this was just as good.  Definitely will make that recipe again soon.

I made this for Father's Day and it was an immediate hit! I wish I had made a 2nd batch because late arrivals missed out. I did use all half-and-half because of the calories, but I may go ahead and try it the next time using some heavy cream. I substituted walnuts for the pecans as I already had them on hand and no one complained. This would also be great with chocolate chips, but it stands well enough on its own~  It really was nice to see adults and kids walking about enjoying their ice cream cones! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! Oh! One little tip regarding keeping the marshmallows fresh~ As soon as you bring them home from the store, transfer them to a plastic zipper bag and add a little cornstarch. Make sure to stir or shake the marshmallows to coat with the cornstarch. This will keep them from getting sticky.

This recipe is by far the best ice cream recipe available anywhere!  I love Dreyer's Rocky Road and only Dreyer's Rocky Road, but this has quickly gone to number one in my book!  I used all the ingredients suggested, but did not heat up the condensed milk/cocoa mixture.  Instead, I mixed all the ingredients (minus the marshmallows and nuts) in a large bowl with a whisk for about 4 minutes, then dumped the mixture immediately into the ice cream maker container.  After about 20 minutes in the ice cream maker, I like to add the marshmallows, either pecans or almonds, and 1 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  The chocolate chips add a nice chocolaty crunch to every bite!  And if you want the best recipe for rich, creamy vanilla ice cream, just leave out the cocoa powder, nuts, and marshmallows in this recipe.  What you're left with is the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had, served best with a warm piece of Grandma Ople's Apple Pie...a recipe you can also find here.

Way too many marshmallows in this one.  The ice cream itself was delicious though.  We may try to add Fluff instead of marshmallows next time, have more a ribbon than fluffy flecks.

I make a lot of ice cream and the first odd thing I noticed in this recipe was the instruction to mix the dry cocoa into the pot w/the thick, sweetened condensed milk. It was hard to mix and harder still to get smooth once the liquid cream mixture had to be incorporated. Next time I followed my own better instincts and mixed the dry cocoa into the lukewarm liquid cream mixture FIRST. Effortless. And no nasty lumps. So that is my only criticism of this recipe and my strong recommendation.  Someone else mentioned that problem as well.  

The choc. flavor is just right, not overbearing.  I didn't have light cream, so I mixed half cup of heavy cream w/half cup of Half and Half--voila, light cream.  Someone else mentioned using evaporated milk, good idea, bc it has a thick consistency which is needed. Overall, good recipe if you add cocoa to the lukewarm liquids first; then add the amt of nuts, marshmallows, choc chips to your own personal preference and not take the recipe amts as gospel.

This recipe is one I forsee using often.  The base is fantastic and I am going to try adding peanut butter cups next time instead of marshmallows and pecans.  The chocolate base is so rich and creamy!  I love this recipe!

This is such a delicious ice cream!!  I don't know why it is only rated at 4 stars.  Maybe some mistakes happened or maybe it just wasn't what others expected, but I thought it was absolutely fabulous!!  Very creamy and had lots of chocolate flavor!  The marshmallows were great too!

I am going to preface this by stating that I don't exactly care for chocolate ice cream so my opinion may not be relevant. I thought this was too chocolate-y.  It needed to be toned down, but if you like a strong chocolate flavor than this one is for you. I did like that I didn't have to add eggs though.

10 times better than the stuff you buy at the store and even better than the stuff at gourmet ice cream shops.  Everyone loved it and asked for more.  Will definately make again and again.  I toasted some almond pieces before I put them in, really made for a good crunch.  I also added a chopped bittersweet chocolate bar and marshmallows.  It was perfection.  I kept everything in the freezer until I was ready to add, it worked beautifully.

Great recipe! But cut up the mini marshmallows so they spread more evenly into the icecream.

I just got my Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker..yeah!!! I am so excited as this is my very first attempt at making homemade ice cream, and I decided to try it because my husband LOVES LOVES Rocky Road Ice Cream!! He was so thrilled and couldn't wait to eat the ice cream. I used Darigold half and half in place of heavy and light cream to ease up on the fat content. I followed the rest of the recipe and waited while the ice cream maker processed the ice cream. Even though my ice cream maker didn't make a solid rock hard ice cream, I was pleasantly surprised at how this turned out, slightly firm yet pliable enough. I just put the rest of the ice cream in the freezer to firm up the consistency a bit more and for flavors to blend, about 1 hour or so. In the end, a wonderfully, rich chocolately Rocky Road Ice Cream! I can see the potential to build upon this recipe and add other ingredients to this. This recipe made a good amount for my hubby until it runs out which I suspect will be very soon. Who would of thought you could make rich creamy ice cream right here at home? I cannot wait to make other ice creams, sorbets, yogurts...Now if I can just find a recipe for Almonds Prailines and Cream...

I liked the flavor of this ice cream, but I think almonds would have been better than pecans. I will make again using chopped almonds.

DELICIOUS!! I completely recommend this recipe. I read thru a few reviews before & changed/added 2 things: instead of heavy/light cream I used 3c of half & half, and I also added in some chocolate chips. All those who said this recipe was as good as something you get in the store, hit it head on!

This recipe is outstanding. After trying a few different recipes with lackluster results, I tried this one. My family loved it! Best ice cream ever was their response. I'm going to see if I can create a 'vanilla version' by omitting the cocoa powder.

The base for this recipe is FANTASTIC.  We have made several variations of this by adding different "extras" including semi-sweet chips, chopped Whoppers, marshmallow fluff (warm it before adding so it doesn't clump), and toffee chips.  We now keep a can of sweetened condensed milk on hand all the time "just in case".

This is the BEST chocolate ice cream recipe!! I like the fact that there are no raw eggs to worry about. Our 4 yr old and 1 yr old love this ice cream. I like to add some of the marshmallows to the hot milk/cocoa mix and let them melt for extra creaminess. Also, I substitute fat free evaporated milk for the heavy cream to lessen the fat/calorie content and it is still incredible:o)

Probably the best chocolate base recipe I've ever tasted...my family is addicted to it!  I made it once without the nuts and with the addition of a fudge ripple, still amazing!  Try it, you will not be disappointed. Didn't have light cream so increased the heavy cream to 2 1/2 cups and used 1/2 cup of whole milk...this is not the recipe you want to try to cut calories on!  I DID use a very good quality Mexican vanilla paste instead of the extract; a quality vanilla makes a bigger difference than most people think. My next experiment with the chocolate base will be to find a good raspberry ripple recipe, and try it with that...(I love chocolate & raspberry together)

Wonderful! I did use the can of sw cond milk, 1 c heavy cream, 1/2 c light cream and 1 1/2 c evap milk which is about 1 can. As others suggested I chopped up chocolate covered almonds, mini milk chocolate chips, and I used bits of chocolate swirled marshmallows. My family loved it.

An extra note: I used the base of this ice cream omitting the cocoa,adding vanilla, and using chopped oreo cookies to make a cookies and cream ice cream. I made it for our Thanksgiving to go with pie. There were many mmmms, and yums for the ice cream and as my sister in law said, you cannot buy  this taste  in the stores, there is no comparison! Thank you again sugar cookie for this recipe, I will be experimenting often!

I tweaked the recipe and it actually turned out wanted I had wanted in the first place a vanilla rocky road. i had searched on here for vanilla rocky road and other sites. i got tired of searching so gave in and decide to make it this way: chocolate. but I did not want to do the stove thing so I just melted chocolate bars to stir in(thinking melted chocolate would mix in with the cream and milk. so I microwaved the chocolate, but it would not mixin. Thinking this looks good this way I added walnut whole (again as shortcut measure, not wanting to chop) and the marshmallows. I think we all in my home have a new favorite. even doubled it was gone in one sitting.  We could not stop eating it.

For those of you who have complained about this not setting up well enough, you probably didn't add enough rock salt to your ice while it was churning. 

I also used half and half in place of the cream, and it was fantastic! Great recipe!

Loved this recipe and plan to use it again!  I used Dark cocoa powder instead of regular unsweetened because I like the richness of the darker chocolate.  I had the same problems with it freezing in my ice cream maker, but a few hours in my freezer got it to the way I like it!

Not only is this recipe super easy to make, it just might be the best chocolate ice cream I've ever had. I was lent an ice cream machine, so I was looking for a no-fail recipe and this was it. I used 2 cups of half and half (because the machine was fairly small) and added chocolate chips in addition to the nuts and marshmallows. Out of this world!!!

Man, is this tasty!  I made it just as the recipe stated, with the exception of adding chocolate chips.  I am also very happy that I decided to spring for the higher quality chocolate when I was making this (that could be a reason that some other people's was not chocolate-y enough).  It turned out incredible--creamy and rich and incredible!!!

OMG! delicious! I couldn't stop eating it. Even with the condensed milk it wasn't too sweet. I use this as a base for all my chocolate ice cream recipes. Don't use it for vanilla unless you like a extremely sweet vanilla flavour though. Becuase this is chocolate it covers that up. In fact I cut the vailla in half for it but you don't have to.

This ice cream was so good. I even made it lighter using Fat free sweetened cond. milk, 1/2 & 1/2 for the heavy cream and Fat free canned milk for the light cream and it tasted so rich. Used almonds instead of pecans because that is what I had. Let sit in freezer 24 hrs to harden. Very Chocolaty. Yum!

I had some trouble with this and ended up starting over and adapting my own recipe.  I heated the condensed milk and cocoa on low, but it was too thick and did not mix smoothly with the heavy cream. The cream ended up with clumps of this cocoa mixture that I could not get smoothed out.  I discarded everything and made up my own recipe - leaving the condensed milk out.

This was really excellent. The marshmallows tend to float to the top of the mixture so wait till it sets a little then stir them in twards the end of the freezing cycle. Yuuummm

I made this recipe, and I am usually really good about following recipe directions, but in this case I had already thrown all the ingredients in a bowl (except the nuts and mallows) before I even looked at the instructions so Instead of heating in a saucepan and refrigerating I just mixed all of the ingredients really well and then threw the mixture into the ice cream maker and added toppings when it was almost done. I'm not sure if it could have possibly turned out better.  It was creamy perfection.  I served it at our dinner party and got so many compliments!

I've made this multiple times and it's delicious every single time! Our family loves this recipe and if it didn't disappear so quickly, I'd make it more often.. Sadly, I just can't keep up with how fast this is eaten. I don't change a thing! Although, if I can't find light cream.. I will sometimes sub half and half. It does it's job just fine :)

Really easy, great ice cream!  Could actually stand for more marshmallows, though.  We have a hand crank ice cream maker and this is probably the best chocolate ice cream that has come out of it.  One of my kids even said that the marshmallows take away from the goodness of the ice cream.  No one else agreed, but it does help make the point that the ice cream comes out really, really good when the recipe is followed as it's presented here.  Thanks for posting it!

This was delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly as written. I mixed it for 15 minutes, added the nuts (used slivered almonds instead of pecans because that is what I had on hand) and then mixed for another 15 minutes using the Cuisinart 2 qt ice cream machine. After 30 minutes the mixture was the consistency of soup! I was nervous but stuck it in the freezer overnight and the next day it was perfect. This recipe is a great method that can be used to create many flavor combinations. We will be using this one a lot!

OH, MY, GOODNESS!  This is some good ice cream!!  Don't make the mistake of not staying with the chocolate mixture as you are cooking it... it turns into fudge.  :)  Second try was perfect and this ice cream is sinfully decadent!

I've made this recipe as a base now for about 6 or 7 batches and all but once did it not turn out the way I expected.  This was due to me not cooling the batter to 40 or lower before putting it in my ice cream maker.

I've done things like adding a shattered dark chocolate bar to the mix, marshemellows (need to be frozen to work right IMO), pecans and cashews as well as the standard dark chocolate chips.

As for the cocoa, I always use the Ghirardelli cocoa as i'm not a huge fan of Hershey and my wife loves this ice cream.  Which is unique as she's never been a fan of chocolate ice cream.

Highly recommended and easy to make recipe that I will use as a base for years to come.

This ice cream was rich and creamy and so much better than anything you will find in the store.  It came together easily and froze nicely in my ice cream freezer, followed by my stand freezer.  It was gone in 2 days!

Best texture and very easy to make! So much that I adapted this recipe to make vanilla ice cream - substituting the cocoa powder for vanilla bean and 1tbs of vanilla extract.... Delicious!!! the only problem with the vanilla flavor made using this technique is that it was a little to sweet for my taste... Next time I will decrease the condensed milk... Excellent texture!!! Thanks for the recipe!

This is excellent!!  I used light cream, half n half and some skim milk and also dark chocolate cocoa.  We added pecans and Heath bar chips only.  Outstanding consistency and taste!  It was rich with the dark chocolate, but we loved it and won't change a thing!

Just got an ice cream machine for my birthday.  This was the first recipe I tried.  Worked perfectly.  Tastes amazing.  Only change was using whole milk instead of light cream because that was all I had on hand.

This is fantastic, and the base ice cream is an excellent chocolate base.  I cut the sweetened condensed milk to fat free and replaced the 3 cups of cream with 2 cups half and half, 1 cup skim milk.  Texture and flavor are still great.    Variation: instead of the nuts and marshmallows, I added 12 tablespoons of malt powder to the base and then 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips about 10 minutes before the end of churning.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic. The only downside was that we had to wait a few hours for the ice cream to harden up, but that was to be expected. The chocolate ice cream base was excellent by itself and I plan on using it for other ice cream recipes. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I'm not a huge fan of chocolate ice cream, but the other folks in the family are.  I followed this exactly and it taste like frozen hot chocolate.  SO GOOD!  This one is a keeper thanks for sharing.

So smooth and so easy. The ice cream base is excellent as is, better than a lot of chocolate ice cream recipes I've tried (add some cinnamon to it for a nice treat). It also freezes well and stays creamy...no ice crystals.

So good, creamy and smooth.  I leave out the nuts (not a nut fan) and add some mini chocolate chips.

YUM! I didn't have mini marshmallows or pecans, so I improvised.  I melted some fluff, put it in a baggie, cut off the tip, and piped it into the ice cream maker while it was churning...it put a nice marshmallow ribbon through it.  I also added chopped walnuts and chopped chocolate.  SO YUMMY!  I'm about 7 months pregnant and this may become a staple for me!

This is such a simple but delicious recipe. Of course, I only waited 2 hours into hardening to dig in. I am sure it will be just as wonderful after it hardens overnight. I added milk chocolate chips along with the nuts and marshmallows. So good!

This one hit out of the ball park!  The flavor and texture is dead on.  Used half and half instead of the cream.  My husband has never had rocky road due to severe tree nut allergies, so we made this with peanuts instead.  Tastes just like Dreyers/Breyers but better because I can put anything I want in it.  Will try it again with a shot of espresso and bits of snicker bars....mmmmmmm.

This made me look like a rock star!  I made the recipe using half and half in place of the light/heavy cream.  I threw everything but the nuts/marshmellows into my ice cream maker for 30 minutes.  Then I poured it into a container and mixed in the nuts and marshmellows.  I froze the mixture overnight and could barely wait to try it the next day.  It turned great!

This recipe is killer! The chocolate flavor is quite intense. My daughter is allergic to nuts so I leave them out, but I simply sprinkle with toasted nuts when serving.

I followed the instructions and put the mixture into my ice cream maker before adding the nuts and marshmallows and it just wouldn't freeze.  I'm not sure what the problem was.  Nice chocolate soup though.

This ice cream was awesome!  The chocolate flavor was great, and I was able to reduce the fat some by using 1 1/2 cups of fat free evaporated milk, and 1 1/2 cups of half and half.  I used the Cuisinart duo, and the texture of the ice cream came out like a smooth chocolate custard.  I also added 1/4 cup of mini chocolate chips, and used sliced almonds instead of pecans.  Everyone loved it - I wish I had made more!

This is as good as or better than any store-bought or parlor-dipped Rocky Road you will ever buy.  It is so richly chocolately, it's just heavenly.  I added semi-sweet chocolate chunks with the nuts and marshmallows - I liked the extra texture/crunch.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

I totally agree! I don't know why this is only 4 stars! I loved it and it came out perfect! I think it would make a great Chocolate Ice Cream if you just leave out the marshmallows and the nuts. Good luck!

This was yummy!  I added 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips, and for the cream used about 1/2 table cream and 1/2 low fat evaporated milk.  I got rave reviews from my dinner guests.

My favorite ice cream is Baskin Robbins rocky road. However, there is no Baskin Robbins nearby any longer so I thought I'd try this in the ice cream maker I recently got. It was fabulous! I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa and whole toasted almonds rather than pecans. Doesn't get much better than this! Yum!

As I always do with homemade ice cream, I divide the ice cream into individual containers before freezing. Otherwise we banter about whose turn it is to scoop!

I have made this several, several times.  It is very good as is but I have found we like it best if I cut the mini marshmallows in half and use pecans toasted in a pat of butter.  Also it is good as a basic chocolate without the add ins.

So deliciously creamy...kept wishing I could compare it to a commercial ice cream, but the reality was that it was no comparison! I did use almonds other than pecans as that is what I know traditional Rocky Road to be...I will definitely be making this again!

This is a fantastic recipe! I made the base mostly as written, only used low fat condensed milk and 1 C cream, 2 C fat free half and half. Still very rich and creamy! I decided to make S'mores ice cream instead of rocky road, so added marshmallows, mini chocolate chips, and graham cracker pieces at the end. Thank you for the recipe, everyone here loved it!

This was the best homemade ice cream I have ever made. I only had large marshmellows so I cut them in small pieces and when it was time to add them, I added them a little at a time and I also used walnuts. A definate keeper!

I made this ice cream for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it. I found it a little too sweet and the marshmallows got a bit soggy and tasted strange. Perfect chocolate flavour though.

Very good and easy recipe. My first homemade ice cream and I was really surprised by the smooth and creamy texture. I wasn't sure if I should put the marshmallows, but it was good. Very rich ice cream but if you want a real treat, that's what you need! A little disappointment, I had to leave it in the freezer all night to get it set right... But the wait was worth it!

This recipe truly deserves more then 5 stars! It is perfect! I couldn't believe just how great this came out -- an egg-less ice cream that is easy to make, creamy, silky, chocolaty and oh, so delicious!! The base is perfect for tons of variations of toppings. I will definitely try the vanilla version next, by simply omitting the cocoa powder.

This was soooo good!  The texture and flavor were perfect.  The second batch, I was low on regular cocoa powder and added a bit of the Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder to make up the rest.  Delish!  LOVE dark chocolate!!

Quite possibly the best-tasting ice-cream I have ever had.  I made it exactly as it said and it came out perfect, albeit a little soft.  After about 30 minutes in the freezer, it was perfect!  I will make this again and again.

Sublime. The base of chocolate ice cream is the perfect flavour. So creamy and delicious. I used double cream and thickened cream for the light. I finely chopped up a block of Cadbury's rocky road chocolate, added a few unsalted crushed nuts and mini mallows and chopped 3/4 very finely up until I filled up two cups. The other 1/4 of chocolate, nuts and mallow I left a little bit more chunky. Very rich, but could easily rival an overpriced ice cream at the shops. No eggs as well!!@! This is great because there is no custard, no taste of egg and for some reason it freezes so much better and the method could not be easier, really, all you have to do is stir in some cream. You could easily leave out the cocoa if you wanted a different flavour and leave it vanilla and add chopped white chocolate and cranberry bits. In fact, I'm kind of inspired by this method to create a pavlova flavoured ice cream with vanilla base, chunks of meringue, strawberry swirl and chunks of berry. Easy, easy, easy - you have to try this recipe.

Nice and smooth.  Good base for other chocolate ice cream with mix ins.  Switched the amounts of light and heavy cream to make it a smidge less bad for you.

The flavor is dead on with this one.  It is delicious.  My only comment is that the texture is slightly off and when you freeze it is becomes noticiable.  I'm not sure how to correct this without making it less diet-friendly.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wowza! What can I say except that I scored major brownie points :) with my husband whose favorite ice cream is rocky road! Delicious! I did substitute whole milk for the light cream, and I added extra milk at the end to fill my 1 gallon freezer container to 2/3 full. I dumped the pecans and marshmallows on the top of the mix before freezing so I wouldn't have to bother stopping it in the middle. It came out great! You should try this recipe.

This is the Best Rocky Road Ever!!! I actually used the fat free sweetened condensed milk...it is definitely a favorite of my family and my colleages at work!!! A little tip though pre-freeze the metal freezing canister and take it out right when you're ready to use it and be sure to use crushed ice!!! These tips can save you ALOT of time. The total freezing time for a gallon of ice cream for me is 15 minutes. Be sure to add in your marshmallows and pecans before it gets too stiff. Following this advice you can enjoy your Rocky Road Ice Cream straight from the bucket...no over night freezing necessary!!! Thanx guys...it's great!!! *Kortney*

This recipe is wonderful! The thing I like about this recipe is that you can adjust it to your liking...I used a lot of nuts (I LOVE NUTS) - and added 3 different types (walnuts, almonds, and pecans)! I also added some chocolate chips to the mixture when I folded in the marshmallows. I will definitely be making this again!

Pretty darn good. I cheated and didn't cook my condensed milk and cocoa powder.  The ice cream was good, but seemed a little off.  Next time I'll break down and cook it.  I added miniature chocolate chips.  So good! I made it for guests, and they ate it all up!

Used this recipe in my new Cuisinart Duo. The recipe made more like 1 1/2 quarts rather than two but I'm glad that I divided the mixture between the two cannisters because it expanded more than any recipe I've tried so far. I used all half and half instead of light and heavy cream since it is what I had on hand. Figured I might lower the fat content a bit but still get the creaminess and I was right! I would consider this a great base recipe for other add-ins besides marshmallows and pecans, too - it's just a great chocolate ice cream and very easy to make compared to the custard based kinds.

This is the best ice cream I have ever made, and my whole family agrees!!  At first, I thought I may have chopped the Pecans too fine, but when we tasted it, there were crunchy little pecans in every bite, it was perfect!!!

Fantastic recipe, which I made as written. So chocolatey. Next time I will add twice as many mini marshmallows and a few more crushed pecans, to make sure every bite has a delicious combination of flavors and textures.

This ice cream is delicious! I made it without heating the condensed milk, sifted, whisked the 1/2 cup of cocoa, and incorporated into the condensed milk for 4 minutes. Then, added 1 cup of whole milk, 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1 cup of half and half. Stirred after each ingredient added, and poured into my Cuisinart ice cream machine. Churned for 35-40 minutes. The last five minutes I added chopped Ghirardelli chocolate baking bar, sliced almonds, and the marshmallows in the amounts that were listed in the recipe in intervals. Scooped it out into container and it was full to the top.

We do not have an icecream mixer so I threw it in the freezer and as it froze I added the ingredients, most of the chocolates sank. But loved the recipe will try again when we get an icecream maker!

This was simple and it turned out great!! The kids couldn't wait to dig in, but I saved some to pack down and freeze hard for a more firm ice cream cone. I also used half and half  instead of the light whipping cream. Yummy!

Great recipe, makes a perfectly flavored smooth and creamy ice cream.  I would wait until the very last second to add the marshmallows and nuts as the nuts seemed to make it difficult for the agitator in my ice cream machine to keep spinning.

omagaaawd! this is the Rocky Road I grew up on. This is the Rocky Road of the Gods!
 I used this for my monthly ice cream pop up...and will definitely use it again and again. Everyone LOVED IT! Sold out , with requests for more.
Very easy to make. I also loved it had no eggs (less steps). The condensed milk gives it's rich creamy texture. MY CHANGES: I suggest adding cocoa to warmed milk  vs. adding to condensed milk  and then add condesnd milk (makes it easier to blend -I used ghiradelli unsweetened coco) I then refrigerated overnight.   I toasted halve'd almonds in oven and used mini marshmallows and added it in the last 2min of churning. and...some after packing the pints.  seriously best I ever had. so easy to make.

THIS IS IT!!  If you're looking for a chocolate ice cream or rocky road recipe, look no further.  I was on the hunt for a better recipe.  Tried this based on reviews and this recipe is not only easy, it's SO YUM!!!  I used 2% milk in place of light cream.    This will become a staple in our house!

I am a Blue Bell kind of guy and it has been hard to find a good recipe for any ice cream with out eggs. This is it! What a great tasting creamy ice cream. I doubled the recipe because I could. I didn't know what light cream was so I used half and half. It turned out great. Then I had a different recipe for some vanilla ice cream and set it aside. I redid this recipe without the cocoa, nuts, and marsh mellows. WOW! Nailed it again! This is the end of my search for a great ice cream recipe. Thanks Sugar!

Tastes like fudge pudding pops! My main modification was to add 1/2 c milk chocolate chips and melt them into the sweetened condensed milk and cocoa powder. I did not add vanilla or any of the "toppings" to make rocky road ice cream. I was looking for a good "chocolate" ice cream and this does not fit the bill for that. However, I love fudgecicles and this is a perfect sustitute! Taste awesome in coffee too.

Creamy and easy, but the chocolate was a little too strong. If I make it again, I'll reduce the unsweetened cocoa by about a third. As it is, it was a little bitter.

Toast the pecans.   Add a half cup mini chocolate chips along with marshmallows and toasted pecans.  I measured these add ins altogether and refrigerated until ready to use.   Best if made ahead and put in freezer after freezing in machine.

Made it exactly how the recipe says. It is delicious. So easy to make. I will be making it again! Only tip I would suggest is slowly stir in the creams, if you just pour it in, the mixture clumps.

I didn't think the ice cream was like rocky road at all.  It was just like chocolate ice cream with some crunchy nuts. It was just---chocolate ice cream.  I don't know if the pecans should be toasted, perhaps, or prailened.  Would have been just as good without the add-ins.

My husband loved this recipe.  It turned out great.  The only thing I may do differently next time is refrigerate the marshmallows prior to putting them in the mix so they are cold from the start to assist with cooling process.

This is the perfect rocky road ice cream!  I live in Vietnam and it's almost impossible to find rocky road ice cream.  I followed the instructions exactly and substituted chopped almonds for pecans, it was delicious.  I've made this over a dozen times and it's a keeper.

Made this today and we love it. It is very chocolatey and as my older son said he mostly tasted chocolate. I find the nuts and marshmallows a nice balanced though. My only worry was the cocoa didn't wasn't to stay mixed as it cooled. I re whisked it before adding it to my ice cream maker and it recombined fine. Had to use both bowls on my ice cream maker to fit it at original amount. It set up faster then the other recipes we've been making. A keeper!

This is hands down the best chocolate ice cream I've ever made. My family is not crazy about nuts so I only add mini-marshmallows. As another reviewer mentioned for some reason it doesn't seem like it's freezing very solid when it churns. After some additional time in the freezer it sets up perfectly. Thanks for a delicious treat!

Delicious!  The only change I made was I added 1 cup of milk.  This makes about a half gallon. So if you want a whole gallon, then double the recipe.  We definitely make this again! Everyone LOVED it!

I made this for the 4th of July, but my daughter and I may eat it all before then (2 days from now).I decided to use all 1% milk rather than any of the creams. It's still setting up, but I know it is delicious and will only get better.
A few concerns:
The cocoa/condensed milk is very hard to keep from lumping. Maybe use an immersion blender at the end to smooth it out. I didn't, but I'm sure you could.
I toasted the pecans and used generous portions of those and the marshmallows. 
I put it right into the electric ice cream maker. I think next time I'll put the mixture in the frig for a few hours to start it out cold. Seems to take a long time to thicken and didn't really get as thick as other ice creams I make. 
It is delcious though!!

I rarely leave a review, whether good or bad, but this is review worthy as it is outstanding!  My 7 year old and I just made a batch for after dinner tonight and we can't keep our spoons out of it.  It is a wonderful recipe that doesn't require making a custard and the base recipe seems as if a person could incorporate many different flavors.  It is a very kid friendly recipe too.  This is most definitely a keeper!!

very easy and tasty.  we thought it was a little too sweet, so we stirred in some peanut butter which made the treat.

Excellent Rocky Road ice cream!  My daughter is allergic to nuts, so we skipped the pecans and added crushed chocolate covered pretzels and chocolate chips to the batch.  She said, and I quote, "you can NEVER have too many marshmallows," so that wasn't a problem for us like for some reviewers.

We were very happy with this even though I used 2% milk instead of light cream. Tasted during the freezing process & thought it was a tad bitter so I added 2 tablespoons of simple syrup. The mixture fluffed up so much that I had to transfer it to my stand mixer in order to add the toasted almonds & marshmallows! It was very soft but after 4 hours in the freezer it was perfectly set - not too hard, not too soft - & pretty darn good! I'm not usually a chocolate fan but this had good chocolate flavor, next time I'll add extra almonds & marshmallows....

Very delicious and creamy and EASY to make! My kids said "NO!" to the nuts so we just used the mini marshmallows and it was yummy.  I will say that I did not stir the cocoa mix continuously while on the stove and it got a little clumpy.  I added a big spoonful of marshmallow creme to smooth it out and it was fine.  So make sure you keep stirring!!

THE BEST chocolate ice cream recipe!!!  I'm not a huge fan of the marshmallows or nuts so I use the chocolate ice cream as a base and add all kids of goodies: pralined pecans, shaved dark, milk, or white chocolate, peanut butter cups....anything you want.  SO DELICIOUS!!!!!

This was my first go at making ice cream with my new ice cream maker. It turned out fabulous - really yummy! I didn't add the nuts but it was still wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe.

Wonderful reciepe!! My son is allergic to nuts to I put in chopped up brownies instead. Along with the marshmallow it's outstanding!! Also I used half vanilla and half imitation almond extract to help bring out the chocolate flavor. Definitely will make again!! Thanks!!
