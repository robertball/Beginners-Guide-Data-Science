This isnt just a Holiday food, my family tried it once on Thanksgiving and still wants it throughout the year.Who would have thought pineapples,crackers, and cheese would taste so good.

So I was skeptical when I made this dish for our family Thanksgiving and even did a disclaimer saying I've never tried it but it got really good reviews.  It was the first dish to be completely wiped out today!  Followed the recipe exactly and it is will be made again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I tried this recipe last year, and by far it was one of the favorites of the Thanksgiving Dinner.  My kids loved it.  They beg me to make it all the time.  It is a Thanksgiving must-have!

Not just for holidays..  I fix this once every couple of weeks.  And never have left overs.  I did make a couple of changes.. just to short cut the recipe.  Used the full can of pineapple and the juice, did not add sugar, cut the butter in half as well as 1/2 the flour.  Yummy!

It's interesting!  That's about all I can say.  Not sure I would use it as a side dish, it tastes more like a dessert.

I have been making this dish as a side for the holidays. I know the ingredients may sound strange, but it's super yummy. It's almost like a side dish dessert.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I wondered how it would be with the butter drizzled over the top rather than mixed in with the other ingredients.  Pineapple and Cheddar cheese together was a first for me.  Thanks!
