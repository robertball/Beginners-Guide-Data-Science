WONDERFUL!  For a perfect, soft sugar cookie, the following small modifications will get you there...use butter instead of marg, and melt it over the stove.  It helps to dissolve the sugar, and to help sugars and butters cream better. Use only 3 cups flour.  Finally, oven temp at 350 and baking cookies for 8-10 minutes keeps it soft.  Lining with parchment paper also helps.  Keep an eye out...they will seem too pale to remove from the oven, but just when the center doesn't look "wet" anymore, it is done.  They still bake for 2 or so minutes, so they will darken up a little and be perfect. FYI--when rolling these out, keep the dough nice and thick...the cookie will be crisp (still good)if it is too thin.

These cookies came out soft, fluffy, and delicious.  The dough was simple to 
make and easy to work with.  However IMO, some adjustments are 
necessary to make this recipe perfect: 1) Only add 3 cups of flour to the dough,
then use 1/2 cup to roll them out.  2) Use butter instead of margerine to give 
them better flavor and texture.  3) Bake them at 350 degrees instead of 400 
to let them puff up and make them softer.
Make sure not to roll them too thin or overbake them.  They should have only a
trace of brown around the edges.  Enjoy :)

these cookies puffed up nicely and held their shape when using cookie cutters.  Very buttery and not overly sweet. They tasted wonderful with just a bit of colored sugar sprinkled on top.  I did add some cinnamon, nutmeg, and a tablespoon of molasses and used half white sugar and half brown sugar to one batch to make snicker-doodles and they turned out great.  This is a wonderful sugar cookie recipe that can be used as base for many kinds of cookies.  I am a  professional pastry chef and have access to many recipes and this is one of the best I have come across.

FANTASTIC!  I have made these MANY times now, and they are always well-received.  I do make some recommended changes:  butter instead of margarine, 3 1/3 cups flour and sub 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup powdered sugar for the 1 1/2 cups white sugar called for.  I also use powdered sugar - as opposed to flour - when rolling them out.  These are easy to handle, and hold up FABULOUSLY . . . tasting great even a week later! I use the Sugar Cookie Icing on this site, and they always look amazing.  A side note:  the first time I made these I made a batch of this recipe AND a batch of the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies, and these were by FAR better - both in texture and taste.

I have been trying to find the perfect cut out cookie recipe and this is the best so far. Like some others I also used butter and I cut back the flour to 3 cups.  I wrapped the dough in plastic wrap and divided it in two as it made it easier to work with. I reduced the heat to 350 and cooked the cookies approximately 10 minutes. Be sure you don't roll out the dough too thin or they will be a harder crispier cookie. I used Barbara's Butter Icing for Cookies and it was excellent.  These definitely rate 5 stars

This is the first time I ever successfully made sugar cookies.  They were wonderful.  I did follow recommendations of reducing flour to 3 cups, oven temp to 350 and used butter instead of margarine.

These cookies definitely lived up to all the great reviews.  They were soft and chewy long after being cooled.  I do regret icing the cookies since they were a little sweet for my taste afterwards.  I didn't chill the dough since I made use of a cookie press, which proved to be a time and mess saver.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!  I just made these again and I had to come back to say that they were perfect using cookie cutters.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I refrigerated the dough overnight and cooked the cookies for 9 minutes at 350*F. Delicious!

These really were perfect for cut-out cookies. I had no problem rolling out the dough and they kept their shape nicely. The texture was spot on. However, by themselves they aren't stellar in the taste department and definately benefit from an icing of some sort. Regardless, I will be using this recipe alot. I may add a 1/2 tsp almond extract or some orange zest or something to spruce them up. Thanks for sharing!

These are by far the best sugar cookies I have ever had! I made Valentine cut-outs for my daughter's class and my family loved them so much that I made another batch the next weekend for my kids to decorate. I used 3 1/4 cups flour and real butter. Larger, thick cookies come out even softer. I bake just until the centers are set then leave them on the cookie sheet for a minute to "cook" a little longer before putting them on the racks. WONDERFUL! WONDERFUL!!

I'm not a fan of sugar cookies simply because I'm not a fan of crunchy cookies.  But these were really delicious. The flavor was just great. I overcooked them a bit--but I could still see the potential deliciousness of them! They looked undercooked even when I now know they were done. So be sure not to go by eye so much--follow the recipe. I'll try again and follow the recipe more closely. Hopefully I'll end up with the fabulous soft cookie I know it can be. :)

These cookies were pefect, and I have tried SEVERAL recipes from this and other websites. I would follow the recommendations of a previous reviewer who suggested using butter, cooking at a different temperature, etc. Her comments are in the second group of reviewers. Enjoy!

This is now my only sugar cookie recipe! I did reduce the flour to 3 cups and I used powdered sugar for the rolling and cutting. I also took the advice to cut them thick (at least 1/4 inch) and cooked them at 350 for 6 minutes and reduced that to 5 after batch #3 (the oven is pretty warm by then). They turned out PERFECT! Thanx for sharing this recipe! BTW: use Butter Icing by Barbara (on this site) and you'll have a cookie worthy of a blue ribbon!

These cookies were excellent! As suggested by other reviewers, I lowered the amount of flour to 3 cups, and used 1/4 cup to roll out the dough. I also used butter instead of margarine, melted it over the stove, and "beat" the wet ingredients in a food processor. I used small cookie cutters and was able to produce double the amount of cookies. After making two batches of small cookies, I found that 375 degrees worked best for me, with a baking time of 10-11 minutes for two trays of cookies in the oven at the same time. I also frosted them with an icing of 1 cup confectioner's sugar, 1/2 tsp. almond extract, and 2 tbsp. water -- the almond extract gives the cookies a great flavour and the icing keeps them soft. Additional comment: the dough was very soft and easy to roll out.
Great recipe!

After many years of failed attempts at sugar cookies, I believed that it was just not in the stars for me to be a sugar cookie maker, I would just buy store made dough and decorate every year. :( To my surprise, I tried this recipe thinking it would turn out like the rest, (too floury, bland, or just plain gross) but they didn't...they were perfect! I used 1 stick salted and 1 stick unsalted butter, 1 c. white sugar/1 c. powdered sugar and left everything else the same. And chilled in fridge overnight. I also used powdered sugar to roll instead of flour (I did NOT want floury cookies!) Baked in conv. oven at 400 for 8-9 min, cooled on baking sheet for appx 1 min then cooled rest of way on rack. Crisp edge yet soft cookie. My husband says he never wants store bought dough again! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I was extremely disappointed in this recipe!! Not only did it waste my ingredients but it wasted half of my cooking day. I would recommend not trying this recipe at all. The cookies were very dry, tasteless and hard. I don't know how anybody could rate this 5 stars. It wasn't until after I made the recipe that I read the reviews about cutting back on the flour. I don't feel a recipe should be rated a 5 star if you have to alter it to make it edible!

Excellent.  350 degrees, 3 cups of flour only, butter instead of margarine for about 8-9 minutes, and for a delightful fragrance and flavor add 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. of cardamom.  It gives it that Scandanavian/Northern German fragrance that is so welcoming at Christmastime.

This recipe was very easy and fun to make (the dough was really easy to work with).  Just make sure you cut the cookies thick, to 1/4 an inch, like it said.  I cut them to be 1/8 inch thick, and they were, but very thin and crispy.  So if you want that fluffly, soft, sugary taste, cut them thick.  Otherwise they were very good.

I really like this recipe.  The reviews say many different things about this recipe, which leads me to believe it can come out many different ways.  Here was my experience.  First of all, I am leery about making these kind of cookies, since they have never turned out well for me in the past, but my 4-year-old really wanted to so we ventured into the kitchen and at first the dough was crumbly, but after only about a minute or so of working with it, it was easy.  And my best idea for keeping them soft is not to roll them out too thin.  My first batch I did too thin, and they were fairly crispy, but the next batches I kept the dough a lot fatter and that worked well.  They did turn out soft, which was great, that never happened before for me.  I will definitely use this recipe in the future.

I really loved this cookie recipe and my family just couldn't get enough of the cookies after I baked them. I rolled the dough slighty thick and reduced the temperature to 375 degrees and only baked for 5 minutes and the cookies were great. I will make these again and again.

WoW! My perfect sugar cookie is one that is thick and soft, and good with or without icing. I have searched this web-site for "my" perfect sugar cookie and I believe I found it. I originally tried "Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" and found they were crunchy even when rolled thick and under cooked. Then I tried "Cream Cheese Sugar Cookies" they were soft with a hint of cream cheese flavor and sometimes got sticky when rolling...closer to what I was looking for, but not your regular sugar cookie. I decided to try these today and used 1/2 cup butter & 1/2 cup margarine everything else the same.  Cooled for 3 hrs, rolled out w/flour perfectly. Mine were done in 8 min w/no browning around edges. They stay very light colored, firm enough to decorate and handle, but soft and thick..yummm! I ate w/o icing and they were awesome, not to sweet like store bought sugar cookie dough, although they would be just as yummy with icing. Thanks Georgie! Will definitely make this holiday season and ice with "Sugar Cookie Icing"!

I made these for Christmas and they turned out wonderful!  I only used 3 cups of flour, the cookies rolled out nice, didn't stick and came right out of the cookie cutter.  They turned out soft and are the best cookie cut-outs I've made.  Highly recommended!  I will make these again next year...

This recipe is as good as they get.  The dough is a snap to make, and incredibly smooth and easy to roll out.  No sticky mess!  What makes them just the best, is their taste. Delicious.  I did chill the dough overnight in the refridgerator and I baked at 350 degrees.  Enjoy!

I read through the top reviews before making this recipe, just to see if there's anything I needed to be aware of before I made them. I did use butter instead of margerine and I only needed 3 1/2 cups of flour. The cookies were GREAT for cutting out and really held their shape when baking--no spreading or wonky cooking with the dough. 375 degrees for ten minutes was just right. My issue with this recipe is just.....flavor-wise, it was just too flour-y. It sounds silly, but it wasn't a perfect balance. The flour just kind of overpowered anything else. This was REALLY close but not a home run for me. It's really four and a half stars. It's almost there.

Baked them with my 6 yr old daughter. Cookies came out great, with soft texture and not as sweet. Just finish decorating them :D Thank you for the recipe.

I followed several suggestions in the reviews here: 3 cups of flour, 350 degrees for about 8-10 min., and butter instead of margarine.  Personally, I don't like it too sweet, so I also only used 1 cup of sugar.  The first time I tried it without any adjustments and the dough came out super sticky even after an overnight refrigeration (I had to throw some of it away).  I wasn't sure if it was because of the ingredients or whether I used a mixer to beat in the flour.  Second try, I made the adjustments and I didn't use the mixer for the flour and it came out perfect.  The dough seemed crumbly and hard at first, but after rolling it more and more, the texture was perfect, especially for kids.  The taste is good and I will definitely use this recipe again.  For icing, I use Sugar Cookie Icing by Janice Brubaker.

I followed some of the advice of other users and used butter instead of margarine, 3 cups of flour (plus flour when rolling them), and almond extract. I also followed the suggestion of baking them for 8-10 minutes until they no longer look "wet" in the center. These are the best sugar cookies I have ever made and they truly do hold their shape.

This recipe was a waste of my ingredients. It was so flaky that it was almost impossible to roll out. The cookies turned out hard and tasteless. Even with the cup and a half of sugar in the recipe.  Decorated with frosting and sprinkles my 3 year old still turned her nose up at them.

I had a bit of trouble rolling out the dough because it was very soft, even after chilling for a few hours.  However, the cookies came out perfectly.  They held their shape, stayed soft, and tasted great! I decorated them with a sugar cookie glaze (powdered sugar, corn syrup, water) and they taste much better than bakery cookies.  This recipe is a keeper!

Kids, 11 & 13 gave it a 5; me, 3.  Unusual texture.  Truly soft, kind of cakelike.  I want my cake cakelike, not my cookies.  If they weren't rolled (1/4"), they would probably BE cakelike.  And, the dough?  It needs more sugar unless you are frosting or sugaring the tops.  I sugared mine & didn't the last few.  Not good.  I even used half margarine, half butter.  Those that suggested 3 cups flour, must be not sifting or spooning their flour.  I went with 3c thinking everyone knew this, I kept adding more & more flour to the shelf & the dough.  Soooo, good if you're dieting & don't go for cakelike too much.  ;) They made pretty slightly puffy hearts for Valentine's day.  For taste, for me, another one.

I made these cookies yesterday and they tasted wonderful and kept their shapes. I can only give the recipe 4 stars because I made adjustments. I used real butter (margarine has much more water content and that will make your cookies spread and they will be crispy instead of soft) and I used only 3 cups of flour and I baked them at 350 degrees for 9 min.  I chilled the dough for approx. 1 hr. I rolled it between sheets of waxed paper and baked on a cookie sheet lined with parchment. They turned out perfect.  I used maybe only a 1/3 cup of extra flour to roll out dough. They didn't break or fall apart when I transferred shapes from paper to cookie sheet.  That is what makes this recipe a keeper. Oh, also, I didn't melt my butter.  I just made sure it was soft and creamed it for at least 7 min while adding the sugar gradually.  That is how my mom taught me and it works every single time.    I took these cookies to the Junior choir that I direct and they loved,loved, loved them.  They said, " Wow, these are nice and soft."  I found them sweet enough and didn't add frosting.  But next time, I will frost them just to make them more eye-catching.

Perfect!! I just made these for Christmas. I cut the flour down to 3 1/4 cups and baked at 350 degrees for 7 minutes. Everyone loved these soft chewy sugar cookies. I frosted them with cream cheese frosting!! YUM!

I think the dough for these wonderful cookies would be very difficult to make without a stand mixer, or a good strong will and some major elbow grease.  Almost all of the negative reviews complain that the dough is too dry or there is too much flour, however the large quantity of flour is essential to get a dense, soft cookie like the Lofthouse cookies at the store. You have to really work it to get all the dry ingredients incorporated (hence the importance of a stand mixer). The dough is very stiff. Before you stick it the fridge to chill, work it into a single ball/mass. Note: your cookies will turn out and taste fine if you substitute butter for the margarine or shortening, but the butter will cause them to be crisper. 

All things considered,this is hands-down the best, simplest, and easiest to manipulate cutout cookie recipe I have ever tried, and I have tried a lot. I used half butter and half shortening and chilled the dough overnight. I rolled them out directly onto parchment paper so I didn't have to add much additional flour at all, and I baked them in a convection oven for 7 minutes exactly. Beautiful, dense, soft, pale, sugar cookie perfection.

A really easy recipe for really nice, soft sugar cookies.  I like to make them on the thicker size, so I only get about 2 dozen per recipe.  I use the Martha Stewart recipe for Royal Icing to frost them.  They always have a great presentation!

I thought I had finally found a recipe for soft, sugary cookies that I could decorate with my kids. Not so. Despite the rave reviews, the dough is extremely sticky/greasy and hard to work with. I chilled it for 3-4 hours and for what? I had to warm up the dough to get it from falling apart in bits. I could have saved myself the time and just fixed the cookies straight after making the dough. Cutting out the cookies were also difficult and my kids were frustrated because their creations kept falling apart. What a huge disappointment for everyone. By the way, the end result is not very soft at all. You must make the cookies quite thick in order to get any softness and then, it is likely due to them being undercooked. I had mine in the oven for 5 minutes and the bottoms were brown whilst the tops were nearly raw. Seems like I unfortunately dudded on what seemed to be a popular recipe. Oh well!

When I was first mixing this dough I thought it seemed a tad dry... but I figured that it was okay, and put it in the fridge like it said to. I took it out of the fridge, and it was so hard that it felt like carrying a huge rock. I figured it just needed to warm up a bit, and even after 2 hours out, it was rock hard. I nuked it a sec to soften it up, and it softened up a bit, however it was EXTREMELY dry, so much so that even my fiance couldn't roll it after I had tried. We tried using wet hands on the dough to add some moisture, but it was so dry that every cookie cut out fell apart - they literally crumbled. I will definitely not make this recipe again, it didn't taste great (the dough, since I didn't get to bake any cookies because I had to throw it away) and the dough was impossible.

I've been using this recipe for my special Christmas and other seasonal cut-out cookies for several years now.  It's become a family favourite and a family tradition for us to decorate these sugar cookies.  You have to watch them carefully in the oven as these cookies can get too brown very quickly!

I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies came out perfect!  The dough was so smooth and easy to work with, not crumbly at all.  The first batch I rolled too thin and they came out crispy, but the remaining cookies I rolled nice and thick and they came out great, and are still very soft two days later.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is perfect for frosted cookies! The dough is nice, and it holds its shape perfectly! The cookies are not very sweet, but I think that works perfectly for putting frosting on them so you don't get a sweetness overload. I love the texture of these, they are soft and chewy and amazing! I will definitely be using this recipe ALOT! Thanks for posting!

Cookies are ok--kind of tasteless..really needs some frosting with flavor and decorations...used almond extract to give them a little flavor, plus used suggestion of less flour and rolling them out in powdered sugar..which was great. Will use my old tried and true recipe next time.

Finally a sugar cookie that has FLAVOR and not just flour and cardboard.  Actually tastes like a soft sugar cookie you get from the grocery store bakery. This is the best cut out cookie recipe I have found so far, and I have tried hundreds over the past 10 years! (sugar cookies are my husbands favorite)  I used only 3 cups of flour per others suggestions, and that was my only modification.  I used powdered sugar and flour to roll them out.  Kept their shape, puffed slightly, chewy goodness.  Firm enough to frost and not break.  Thanks Georgie!

My first review!  I made these last night and they are fabulous.  We can't stop eating them!  I think people who have been having trouble, might just need more practice with cut outs.  Once you put frosting on them, I can't imagine wanting the actual cookie to be sweeter and I am a sweet freak!  The cookies are soft and held the shape of my cutter perfectly.  Make sure you cut them on the thick side.  I did follow the advice of other reviewers and used 3 1/4C flour and then used a generous amount on the table when rolling out.  I also baked at 350 for 8/9 minutes.  I took them out as soon as they were dry on top!  Couldn't be better.  I am not even going to look for other recipes.  I used buttercream frosting, but you can easily use royal icing, a glaze, or colored sugar.

My cookies were not soft at all.  I followed the recipe completely, so I'm not sure where I went wrong.  But they turned out rather hard and kind of chewy.  I won't be making these again...

I've been searching for a perfect rolled cookie and I've found it.  I reduced the flour to 3 cups and used butter instead of margarine.  The dough is so easy to work with and the cookies came out so nice.  I iced them with "Sugar Cookie Frosting" submitted by Kathy Brandt.  This recipe is a keeper!

The first time I made this recipe, I was not blown away. I would have given it a 3 star review… However, I followed the suggestions of a few other reviewers, make a few tweaks and tried it again… VOILA! 5 stars! 

1- melt the butter before mixing with the sugar.
2- 3 cups of flour only.
3- bake for exactly 9 minutes.

This results in a cookie that doesn't expand/puff up too much while baking, and retains the shape of your cookie cutter. The cookies, even 3 days later are firm.. yet soft & chewy and not at all crunchy or brittle. LOVE.

Perfect!  Only used 3 1/4 - 3 1/2 cups of flour but other than that the recipe stands as it is.  I would definitely sprinkle with sugar or ice these if you want a sweeter cookie.  I personally like a not-so-sweet cookie, but my family likes them with the icing.  An easy powdered sugar, water, corn syrup icing is all you need.

I did not like this recipe at all.  The dough was crumbly and too dry to roll out.  I had to add liquid (milk/water) until it was the right consistency.  Taste was okay, though not great.  Will not make again.

The recipe is great, but I suggest some ideas to improve your cookies. Firstly, it'll be prefferrable to add cinnamon for your cookies to be not only sweet but flavoured also. Secondly, to make your cookies not so pale (if you don't use icing or topping, of course), it is good to grease them with yolk before placing in the oven or use some brown sugar instead of white.

This was so good with the 3 cups flour. I loved the taste. One trick I learned last year was to place the dough in a ziplock bag and roll it out to fill the bag. Then when you are ready, slit the bag along two sides and cut off a chunk to roll out. Didn't really need much more rolling and used powdered sugar so it would work back into the unused portion and not make it tough. Quick and easy cookies.

If you're looking for sugar cookies that are great for cut-outs (i.e. keep their shape) AND stay soft, these are them. The only thing I changed was to use butter instead of margarine and I only used 3 1/4 cups of flour. I did not use ANY additional flour for rolling the dough.  Immediately after mixing the dough, I divided it into two chunks and rolled out each chunk between two pieces of wax paper (easy clean-up and no additional flour).  I put the rolled discs of dough, still in the wax paper, in the fridge to chill overnight and cut out the next morning.  I baked at 350 for 10 minutes and took the cookies out of the oven before they looked "done." I let them continue cooking on the cookie sheet for about 2 more minutes, and then transferred the cookies onto cooling racks.  They were wonderfully soft, kept their shape, and didn't taste too flour-y.  This will be my go-to sugar cookie recipe.

I use butter instead of margarine and I also add 1/4 tsp cinnamon. I always use cream cheese frosting to decorate them and they are always a hit.

I've tried a LOT of cookie recipes and this one has to be the best!!  It was super easy to mix (my kids even helped) and the texture is great.  I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and also 1/2 tsp of almond extract.

I rarely ever change a recipe until after I try it. I used 1t. almond flavoring, and 1t. vanilla. These are perfect both ways. I am planning my next to have butter flavoring.

AWESOME!  I have been baking for over 40 years, and these are by far the best cut-outs I have ever made.  Easy to mix, easy to roll out.  I used melted butter and baked at 350 degrees.  I used to hate doing cut-outs but not any more - I will keep this recipe.

Still can't believe how amazing these are!  I have FOREVER been in search of soft, chewy, buttery sugar cookies.  THIS IS IT!  They are easy to cut out and taste phenomenal.  Normally sugar cookies are either easy to cut out but taste crunchy and bland or they tear and are too soft while cutting, but taste great, leaving an ugly but delicious cut out.  No more!  Save this recipe!!!

My go to for sugar cookies. My secrets are making sure I cut them out thick, they stay softer and chooey. Also use half flour, half sugar when rolling the dough to make cut outs to keep from sticking to counter/roller. Make them the day before you serve them, in the AM. Bake them, ice them, let the icing dry, then store overnight in sealed container with a piece of bread. PERFECT the next day. Soft, buttery. Yum.

Tasty treats! I went to a craft store and got some festive goodie bags and tissue paper to give to my friends at schoola dn made these cookies to put inside. I made 60 cookise total and they taste amazing! To add some christmas color, I put a drop of red and green food coloring at the top of each cookie after I had made them circles on my cookie tray. I put them in the oven at 375 on convection and they were ready in roughly 8-9 minutes. Some other ways I added festivities were red and green sprinkles, but the food coloring would run all over the cookie when it rose and it added a neat effect. I highly suggest it and I am looking forward to making these again for more holidays yet to come.

I have tried every sugar cookie recipe on here and so far this is my favorite. These bake up so nice and soft and yummy. I did use butter instead of margarine and took others advice and made it 3 cups flour and then rolled them out with 1/2 c. or as much as needed. Do be sure and take them out when no longer wet, let them sit on the sheet 2 minutes or so, then pull them off and they will be perfection. I can't say enough about them. For me the recipe made about 5 dozen cookies. Still haven't found the perfect icing unfortunately.

I really love this recipe. I went with the suggestion of using butter and 3 c. of flour & roll them out with 1/2 c flour. The dough was durable and smooth. I really was not at all discouraged working with it. It held its shape through baking which for me sealed the deal. I've tried other recipes that seem to melt in the oven (very frustrating). If you are a novice this is a great recipe. Wonderful taste and texture. I love a chewy cookie!

I made these with my daughter yesterday for Halloween and the recipe worked great!  I liked that all the ingredients were things I already had on hand.  I used butter instead of margarine and ended up letting it chill overnight because I didn't have time to do the cookies the night before, but it worked out great.  The dough does get soft fast so sticking it back in the fridge between rolling some out will keep it firm enough to cut out shapes. My oven runs a little hotter than it should so I had to lower the temp a little, but I just kept a close eye on them.  If they are taken out of the oven when they barely start to brown on the bottom and edges they stay soft for several days.  I don't see how you can go wrong with this recipe, its great!

This dough is very easy to work with. The cookies have a great taste, but are not as soft as I had hoped. The cookies do soften nicely when frosted and allowed to sit for a day (if you can keep the kids from eating them!)

I'm not sure how the other people's attempt to this recipe did not turn out.  I have tried this recipe a few times and it has been great every time.  Make sure you make the cookies 1/4 inch in thickness.  I noticed that it stays softer longer.  Excellent recipe!

This is just what I was looking for!!  I hate "cakey" sugar cookies.  These were crisp on the edges and soft in the center.  I added a 1/2 cup of sour cream for a bit of tanginess to the dough and only used 3 1/4 cups of flour.  Form your dough into a long log to speed up the chilling process and use it immediately from the fridge if you have trouble with it sticking.

Great cutout cookie recipe! I used wax paper to roll them out: one sheet of wax paper under and one sheet over -- that method was great as I didn't need to flour surfaces and make a mess. I lined my cookie baking sheets with parchment paper and that worked great. Cookies cooked evenly and kept their shapes. If my dough started to get too warm, I rolled it out (in between wax papers) and kept it flat on a cookie sheet and set it inside the freezer for 5-10 mins. Made it easier to cut out cookies when the dough was colder/firmer. Tastes great, too! This is my go-to recipe for cutouts.

These are amazing!!! Best sugar cookie I've had in a LONG TIME.  I did take note of the reviews used butter instead of margerine and only did 3 cups of flour vs the recommended amount. 

Also, best tip I ever had was to put the cookie sheet in the freezer for a few minutes right before putting in the preheated oven. The cookies kept their shape perfectly! Also, take them out right before they start Browning when the tops are no longer "wet" looking. 

This recipe is definitely a keeper. :)

Made this cookie today!  Came out perfect.  I made the following modifications per the reviews:

3 cups of flour instead of 3 3/4
Butter instead of margarine
2 cups of sugar instead of 1 1/2

I also took the following recommendations:

Bake at 350 for 6 minutes
Roll the dough out on parchment paper so you can just transfer the parchment paper to the cookie sheet.

I used different thicknesses for each batch...  I liked the 1/4 inch the best...  they puffed up to about half inch and are very soft.

Great recipe. I always use butter, and took the advice of a few and melted it, then adding the sugar to dissolve that a bit. I was lucky enough to have come across a baker's "vanilla butter" emulsion, and I used this in place of vanilla in both the cookie and the royal icing I made to ice them with. Rolled to 1/2" thick and baked at 345F in a convection oven. The result is utterly addictive. Love these cookies! Would make them again in a heartbeat. Thanks for posting this!

Produces an excellent cookie.  They baked up fine..I cooked them slightly longer than the recipe called for but I think that is just my oven as I didn't find they firmed up enough based on the recipe instructions. They held up nicely for decorating and everyone enjoyed them.  Will use this recipe in the future.

Followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect, well besides my 1950's oven cooking unevenly! Dough was very simple and the cookies were soft and delicious, definitely the best sugar cookie recipe I have found so far!

The cookies tasted good but I couldnt roll out the dough. It was so sticky and a big mess! I even tried to leave it in the fridge over night. so I just ended up rolling them in balls and it worked ok.

These are great!  I use butter instead of margarine.  They are really good if you bake them a little longer for a crispier cookie as well.  Another recipe I am adding to my yearly cookie baking.  Thanks for sharing!

These keep their form beautifully, bake well, and are easy to make. However, they are a bit bland and tend to be hard - not crisp, hard.  I will make these any time that it is important that the cookies look exactly the way I want, but for regular round sugar cookies, this is not it.

this recipe is really good tasting, it's just that I used butter instead of margarine and baked them for 3-4 minutes extra and they turned SUPER HARD! I have to make a new batch today because of that...well, anyway, deffenetly cook 5-6 minutes and no extra if you want them soft. and DON'T roll thinner than 1/4 inch!!!!!too crunchy!!!!!! Merry Christmas, Little Emmanuel is here!!!!

made this last night that are so good that there almost gone. im going to make another batch tonight. but if you use self rising flour you dont have to put the baking power or the salt in them so less stuff you have to measure. i only use self rising flour and it works great.

These came out pretty good. However, for some reason they tasted like flour. It wasn't obvious, but they did and after I noticed, I had a hard time eating them. Everyone else liked them though. Of course, I fed them to a bunch of college girls who probably never get to eat cookies made from scratch anyways. They are definitely better than store bought cookies, flour taste and all.

Made this at my in-laws over the holidays - and they were hard as rocks - OK maybe their baking powder wasn't fresh.  SO I made them at home when we got back.  Dough was much nicer and tasty (raw!) but they are still hard as rocks - tasty rocks, but not soft.

this was the first time I made sugar cookies and the were the star of Christmas goodies! I had big ornate cookie cutters and this recipe was perfect for them. They were fabulous even with just sprinkles. I usually buy Giannas cookies @ wfm, and had high expectations. I'd say these were even better. I did add about a tsp of molasses after everything was mixed and mushed in with me hands and add a tad more vanilla early on in the mixing. Most definitely will make this over and over again! THANK YOU!

This recipe turned out terrible for me, I'm not sure how the cookies came out so wonderful for other people because the were not good when i made them. The dough is nice an taste good too, but once the cookie has baked it looses all of its sweetness and turns very bleh. I think there is too much flour but overall I would never make this recipe again.

I followed Tara1972's advice and only used 3 cups of flour. I also melted the butter before creaming it with the sugar. The cookies are great, chewy and flavorful, buttery and sweet but not cloying. I've never been much of a sugar cookie person but these cookies are fantastic.  Thanks!

Fantastic Recipe. these are definatly the softest Sugar Cookie Recipe I have ever made. I found the batter to be very dry once all the ingredients where mixed in. this made rolling the dough out somewhat difficult. However the results were well worth the additional struggles. I will definatly makes these again and again.

I could never give a 5 star to anyone but my grandmother's recipe. I wanted to try a different recipe this year, and this was easy and worked great! Same as most of the people on this review list: cut the flour back to 3 cups.

OH MY GOSH! I just LOVED these cookies. I followed some other reviews and decreased the flour to 3 cups (I had a hard time getting that mixed in and couldn't imagine using more) I also used unsalted butter, decreased the temp of the oven to 350 and baked according to the look of the cookie I used large cookie cutters and baked for about 8 minutes. I also added about 1/4 tsp of almond extract to the batter. I am on my 4th batch today! Now if I could only find a great glaze for the top...

I loved this cookie recipe! The kids really liked the sweetness of the cookie and the rest of the family had never had such a soft sugar cookie before. I took the advice of others and used only 3 cups of flour, and melted the margarine. Thanks for these wonderful Xmas treats!

I usually purchase Pillsbury sugar cookie dough to make our  cut out cookies. No more! I will be using this recipe. I did take the advice of only using 3 cups of flour then use the rest when rolling. I also used butter. Thanks for sharing!

One word - Delicious! I always seemed to have a hard time making Sugar Cookies. Either the recipe was strange or the ingredients didn't quite taste right in it. But this one is different! It's really buttery with a crunch on the corners while still remaining soft and chewy in the center! That is what I love in a cookie. And the dough was so easy to prepare, I could have sworn I did it wrong, but I didn't! Overall a very great cookie! I'm so keeping this. Thank you for sharing it!

I've been using my spritz cookie recipe for the last several years because of the lack of a really good sugar cookies recipe. I am looking NO further. This is the absolute best soft sugar cookie recipe ever!! They remain soft and non-crumbly after baking, they are super easy to shape and cut-out, and they have a great flavor. They taste EXACTLY the same as the cookies that you buy at the local grocery store or Walmart bakery with the thick, hard icing and sprinkles. You can ice any way you like and you can't go wrong!

I made Halloween cookies with this recipe & they turned out great!  I made a few changes -I added brown sugar (1/4 cup) and only used 3 cups flour.  Be sure not to watch them in the oven.  They're better & softer slightly under-baked.

The cookies turned out pretty nicely.  I used butter and 3 cups of flour as previous reviewers suggested.  After chilling the dough, it was a lot easier to work with.  The recipe makes good sugar cookies, but not as good as the recipe for "easy sugar cookies" (also on this website).

These turned out great and have been a hit this holiday.  Be careful to not overbake- I only let them stay in for around 5 minutes.

Hands down, thee best sugar cookies I've ever had. They taste great as is, but are absolutely to die for when frosted with the "Decorator Frosting" recipe also found on this site. I can't wait to make more this year!

Thanks so much!!!

Once you make these, you will make them over and over again...no matter the season.  The thicker you cut them out, the better.  I find if you cut them thinner than called for, they get a little to crispy.  People have asked if I stole the recipe from a store or bakery!

I followed the previous advice by MARLALP, who suggested substituting butter for the margarine, decreasing the temperature, etc. 
These were by far the best sugar cookies I have ever made -- soft, perfectly sweet, and lasted about 1 day in our house! I did, however, use almond extract instead of vanilla, as I prefer that flavour. I will absolutely make these again!
Thanks, Georgie!

I may have done something wrong, but mine had a weird after taste, and the dough was awful to work with.  I would recommend to anyone to try it though.

I had tried 4 different recipes this weekend to find a really good one. I wanted to bake cookies with my son. I think I finally found it. My husband even liked them. And he is a hard person to please when it comes to sugar cookies. Thank you so much. I can now goto bed. It is past midnight and I was determined to find one tonight.

I'm very pleased with this recipe. The dough was very easy to work with and I used very little flour while rolling them out. The cookies held their shape perfectly after baking. When I first removed the cookies from the oven, they were a tiny bit crisp around the edges, but after sitting overnight in an airtight container, they were soft and tender all the way through. They're sweet enough that icing is unnecessary.

My husband was whining for sugar cookies and I wanted him to entertain our 2-year-old daughter while I got some work done, so I made up a batch and stuck it in the fridge, cleaned off all the cookie cutters that were in the Play-Do box, and set everything up for them.  They had a blast making cookies, and they both loved eating them.  Last but not least, they took some to my mother-in-law's house the next day to show off their baking skills, and she loved the taste and texture so much, she asked for the recipe.  You know it's a winner when your mother-in-law wants the recipe! 

I have made two batches and just now read the suggestion to cut down on the flour, which I think I will try next time.  Otherwise, it's a no-brainer.

Wow! These soft cookies melt in your mouth. Even the pickiest of my friends and neighbors gobbled them up! They were so good I didn't bother using icing, but I will when I make them again for Christmas. Great for the little ones, especially if you are one who watches out for what they eat. This is now an offical recipe I will use forever. 3 cups flour and 350 degrees did the trick for me. I kept flour around the dough while rolling to prevent sticking. I could't wait so I didn't even bother to refrigerate. I baked them until they were just the way I like them.Your awesome recipe has made me the sugar cookie queen. I am so glad I gave this one a try.

I didn't think that staying soft was that big of a deal for cutouts but they are really much better this way.

Wonderful!  I am throwing out my mom's recipe and replacing it with this one! If you are willing to roll out small portions of dough at a time, you can really cut down on the "chill-period"...I was pressed for time and unable to let the dough chill for the requisite period.  I just rolled out small portions at a time and there was absolutely no sticking...to the rolling pin or my counter/board.

This is the only recipe I use now for sugar cookies. These cookies are superior because they remain soft rather than crispy, just the way I like them. They also have a wonderful buttery flavor.

I just wanted to say Thank you for the AMAZING sugar cookie recipe! This is the first year ive ever been able to make cut out x-mas sugar cookies with my kids! Last year I tried with a different recipe and the dough was a disaster so sticky and such a mess than I put to much flour to get sticky off dough and it got too thick.ya it was a nightmare!  I thought I would try it again and I found this recipe after searching and gave it a try and WOW it worked!!!! Dough that was perfect NOT sticky and was wonderful to roll out. The x-mas cookies are turning out beautifully and its all Thanks to your amazing recipe I now have a go to sugar cookie recipe that I can use to make cut outs for all the holidays as its so fun to decorate them! Thank you so much!  I did follow some of the other's suggestions and only used 3 cups of flour and I used 2 cups of sugar and baked them at 350% instead of 400% and by the way these cookies cook SUPER FAST only about 5 min at most they will be very pale in color and still soft but take them out and leave on cookie sheet for 1 minute then move to cooling rack and they harden and are perfect!

EASY! I've made this recipe twice in a few days, and I'm not much of a baker. They came out perfect each time. My 10 year old nephew declared them to be the best sugar cookies he'd ever eaten! Everyone loved them. I iced them with the shiny cookie icing recipe on AllRecipes. http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Shiny-Cookie-Icing/Detail.aspx?prop24=RD_RelatedRecipes&extkb=1 I also made candy cane shaped cookies and iced them with peppermint white chocolate icing, which I made my melting down some white chocolate chips with skim milk, added a little peppermint oil and red food coloring, and piped from a pastry bag. Delicious either way! I do think these cookies require icing. Otherwise they're kind of like shortbread -  pretty dry.

Just made this with my two boys, ages 5 and 2 1/2.  The dough was very forgiving for little hands, although we had to stop and refrigerate a couple of times as it got soft quickly and would tear.
I followed the suggestions to use 3 cups flour and baked at 350 for 11 minutes (our cutouts were rather large and thick!). A couple broke while trying to remove them from the pan, so my helpers got a taste test :)  Can't wait to frost them.

I did not care for this recipe. Maybe it was something I did but they came out overly pillowy and did not taste good. I followed this recipe to a tee and was very disappointed when they turned out this way :(

Just made these cookies! Last batch came out about 5 minutes ago. Thinking I might frost them, but I tasted one and they are pretty delish! They were pretty similar to ones I've had before. Cooked at 375-F. I also had used my heart shaped cookie cutters for Valentines Day and they held their shape! Perfect cut-out cookie!

followed everyone's suggestions...3 c flour, 1 c white sugar, 1 c powdered sugar...rolled out with powdered sugar instead of flour.  Baked at 350 for 8-10 min, and they were FABULOUS!!!! I never have to look for another sugar cookie recipe again

Very good.  Bake a little underdone so they don't get too hard.

This recipe was very good and very easy!  I left the dough in fridge overnight and I had no problem rolling cookies out and shaping them.  They stayed nice and soft, even after being in the freezer for about a week!

These are perfect, soft, and delicious. Followed the directions exactly as written, turned out perfect! USE MARGARINE AS STATED! Butter makes crispier cookie. I made 15 dozen of these for my sons school, trust me-this ones a keeper!

Delicious Cookies!  They didn't last long in our house, and the kids fought over them  I frosted them with Sugar Cookie Icing by JBS BOX.

These are great cookies, light and flaky.  They remind me of pie.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because of the amount of time and effort they take to make.  The first set that went into the over opened.  For the rest of them I used two finger to pinch them closed and pinched them deeper.

These do have great flavor. I put one pan in the oven as directed (400deg. for 6 min.) and for some reason, mine would not come off the pan. Turned into a crispy, crunchy mess. For the remaining pans, I put them on greased foil atop a cookie sheet and baked at 375deg. for 6 min. They came off the foil beautifully and were soft and delicious! I put sprinkles on before I cooked them and they look great.

Fabulous cookies! I used 3 1/4 C flour and real butter as other reviewers. I also rolled out using powdered sugar. These are chewy and amazing cookies, and the dough is super easy to work with. This recipe made 53 mid-sized cookies for me. These would be great with just sugar, butter frosting or royal icing.

This was by far the best rolled sugar cookie recipe I have ever used.  My 6-year-old daughter and I made Christmas cookies which we gave away to teachers and friends.  They were beautiful and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were softer cookies.  There is no comparison between these and store-bought cookie dough!!  It is worth the extra time.

these needed way more flour to be able to cut. I chilled overnight to no avail. Had to add flour and wil try again tomorrowfinish . however they are delicious cookies but even better when cooked longer. We ate them all, none for Santa. He will get store bought.

I was skeptical because I make sugar cookies for cutting in shapes every year with my kids, and they are always cuter than they are tasty.  But these are soft and delicious!  Everyone can tell the difference from other recipes I have used.  Thanks so much for this recipe, it's a keeper!!

Amazing cookies.  Followed some earlier advice and added 1/2 cup less flour.  Only used 1 cup sugar and substituted 1/4 cup honey.  Also added about 3 Tablespoons molasses and upped salt to 1 tsp since I was using unsalted butter.

I made these just as the recipe stated and found that after chilling the dough, it was difficult to work with.  They tasted pretty good but maybe a little too much flour.  I will use the advice of previous reviewers and cut back some on the flour.  I also had to cut back on the bake time a little. Over all, it is a good recipe.  My 4 year old really enjoyed making them!

These are by far the best sugar cookies I have ever made! I did have to increase the cook time by several minutes. If you make them too big (I had 4 inch trees), the outsides get crispy and the insides undercooked. I solved by cooking 4 minutes longer at 25 degrees less. They stay soft for 4 or 5 days in a sealed container. Will definitely add to my Christmas baking rotation.

Were very yummy but the dough was horribly messy and impossible to cut with cutters... we ended up taking a chunk of dough and twisting it into little candy cane shapes as a last resort so the kids weren't dissappointed... Still gave it stars though because perhaps I did something wrong... I think maybe I needed to chill for longer than the time indicated in the recipe :(

I really want to give these 3.5 stars.  They're easy to make and my kids loved them.  Here is my complaint.  I found them too soft and they broke very easily.  For sugar cookies that I wanted to ice this was a problem.  Perhaps if I had cooked them longer they would have gotten harder and maybe not broken as easily.  I also found them way too sweet but my kids didn't.  Either way, not a bad recipe but one that I may tweak next year.

This are yummy and really easy to roll out and cut. Watch thickness because some may get hard quicker,adjust time in the oven by a minute less or so.

Good recipe! They actually are soft! I did half and half white and powder sugar, and i also used almond extract instead of vanilla, i really love that almondy taste to my sugar cookies! Baked at 350 for about 8 minutes. I might almost roll them even thicker next time, cant imagine it would hurt! they were very soft and good, still soft 3 days later in a airtight tupperware.

All these rave reviews had me exicted. I am a cut-out sugar cookie novice, as I am usually too lazy to do the whole roll-out, cut-out thing, so I am not sure if it was the recipe or just me. I didn't find the flavor to be anything special, and the dough was really hard to work with. I tried to roll the dough out on the cookie sheet (use LOTS of flour this way), cut the cookies and remove the excess. I found the last step to be a bit challenging as the dough is so sticky. I ended up dividing it into small balls and sticking them in the freezer for 20 minutes or so and rolling each shape out individually (again, plenty of flour) It was easier for me this way. The flavor was lacking, and I don't think I will try this recipe again. I have over 60 cookies that no one will eat.

I really wasn't a fan and have had much better cookies in past Christmases, but it probably was more due to the fact that I used whole-grain flour and it made the cookies taste funny. This was also a lot more difficult to make and I had to keep the dough in the fridge and take out clumps when I was ready to roll it out because it got too sticky. Sorry, but I won't be making this recipe again.

My fiance hated sugar cookies, until he had these! Before the first batch was even gone he asked me to make more! Our friends had fun decorating and devouring them at our weekly game night. I followed the recommended additions for nutmeg and salt. Delicious!

After the cookies were baked they tasted fine.  But don't use butter if they were in the same fridge with onions- they taste gross.  Add almond extract if they taste funny.

These are fabulous! I have been on a quest for the ultimate cut out cookie and I have finally found it. These were easy to mix up, easy to roll, and turned out fantastic. I used butter instead of margarine, only 3 cups of flour in the batter (then used flour for rolling) and baked at 350 for about 8 minutes. My only minor complaint was that they didn't hold the cut out shape extremely well- as they baked the edges of the shapes got blurry. Maybe next time I will try to keep the dough cooler before baking and see if that helps. But that won't keep me from making these again- this is my new cut out cookie recipe.

Very easy dough to work with.  I used less flour when preparing dough and added the extra when rolling it out.  I made dough a couple days in advance and kept in refrig, it worked great. Be careful not to roll too thin unless you like crispy cookies.

If anyone has doubts about how easy and idiotproof these are, I mixed up a batch about 20 minutes before the grandkids arrived and put them in the freezer to chill.  After 20-30 minutes in the freezer, we divided them into 4 parts, rolled each grandkid (ages 6,5,4,3) a section, and let them have fun.     They cut, sprinkled, sugared, patted and poked to their hearts content, and the ultimate result were cookies anywhere from paper thin to 1/3" thick.  After adjusting the cooking time based on thickness, every one was a work of art and very edible.

Wow. These are terrific! If your dough was "crumbly", I don't think you mixed your dry ingredients well enough. I had the same problem but kept with the mixer...and the dough was perfect. I also did the butter and 375* for 9 minutes. This will be my Christmas cookie for years to come!

Fabulous with some minor changes.  Cut the flour back to 3 cups, salt to 1/4 tsp, marg to butter and bake at 300 degrees for 8 minutes.  I roll my dough out into 2 plate size discs between parchment paper and then refridgerate for 1 hour. This makes it so easy to roll out and cut into shapes.  Let it rest on the baking sheet for a couple of minutes before putting it on the wire rack. If making large quantities refridgerate cut outs and keep the pan cold between batches, this helps retain its shape.  Thanks for a great dough recipe.

Very good recipe. I am not baker and this was very simple to do with my young daughter. I also used almond extract because that was all I had on hand.

This recipe is perfect! I followed to suggestions to bake at 350degrees and use 3cups of flour. I had a roll of Jolly Ranchers in the cupboard and decided to make stained glass cookies-- these worked perfectly! Just cut a hole in the middle of the cookie and drop a candy in, bake the same amount of time. Use Jolly Ranchers, not Lifesavers, as they burn easily and don't melt into a smooth, glassy surface.

Reduced flour to 3 cups, rolled out with confectioners sugar, used butter instead of margarine, reduced temperature to 350 and baked for 10 minutes.  These are awesome!  I'm going to be icing them with a recipe from this site and posting pictures as soon as they are done!  I'm happy with these because the shape you cut them into, they come out as!  No spreading or sides falling. These would be excellent as a cookie bouquette, I would just bake them longer so they are a bit more sturdy. Thanks for posting Georgie!

I honestly do not understand why this recipe has such high ratings. I have made these FOUR times, so I know I didn't miss anything, and they still taste like you're eating bread. They are so, very bland. It's a good thing I have a really good icing recipe to give them some flavor! I will not try this recipe again.

I just made these and they're easy and so delicious!  This will be my sugar cookie recipe from now on.  The cookies held their shape with the cookie cutters and puffed up beautifully in the oven.  But they're not too soft that I couldn't decorate them...a great cookie!

oh my goodness! Best sugar cookie I have tasted yet. I was sooo worried that they were going to turn out crispy and dry but they were soft, chewy and perfect. I also took the suggestions and used real butter and 3 cups flour. I cant' seem to keep the house stocked with them. I've already made them twice. Now to head to the store for some more icing to whip up another batch. =)

This is a really good recipe.  I also only used 3 cups of flour and butter instead of margarine.  If you want your cookies to maintain their shape, I recommend baking them at the 400 degree temp.  At 350, they puffed up and spread too much.  This would also be good with 1/2 tsp almond or lemon flavoring added.

These are truly the best sugar cookies!  Like with everything, peoples tastes are different.  I have the exact opposite opinion of reviewer Christi. (In fact today I purposely went back and read all the reviews of the BRSC recipe to find others who were not fond of it and then looked at which sugar cookie they rated higher.  The consensus was this Soft Christmas cookie.) Last week I made the highly rated Best Rolled Sugar Cookie and found them extremely bland, tasteless, and cake-like. (Thanks goodness for Buttercream Icing!) The dough was also far too sticky and therfore very difficult to roll out.  This recipe to me is far superior. I followed other reviewer suggestions and used only 3 cups of flour, butter instead of margarine, and baked at 350 for 8 minutes. Even without frosting or sprinkles these are very flavorful and roll out like a dream.  My 7 year old actually rolled and cut-out more then I did.  I will absolutely make these again.

Wow, I dont have a CLUE what I did wrong, but obviously I did not have the end result I was hoping for. The dough was so sticky, and falling apart that it could barely be handled, it had the consistency of pancake batter, it was awful! I followed the instructions exactly, didnt change a thing. I was very disappointed. My kids wanted some Christmas cookies, and they would not even hold their shape for the cookie cutters, ended up having to spoon them onto the cookie sheet. What went wrong?

I only gave these 4 stars because I had to change the margarine for butter.  I thought I had margarine but I only had butter so I couldn't rate it on the actual recipe.  
  Beside that these turned out great.  I didn't change anything else in this recipe and they turned out perfect with tons of flavor.  
 They are so easy I will make these again.

I liked this recipe. I followed only 3 cups of flour. You easily add another cup flattening the dough out and cutting. I watched them and 7 min was PERFECT. Thankyou for my first cookie cutter recipe!

Very nice cookie.  I melted the butter and sugar together before beating them and I used 2 c. white flour and 1 c. whole wheat flour.  I had to refrigerate the dough over night and I wish I had wrapped up the dough in two separate balls as opposed to leaving it in the bowl because it was hard as a rock trying to dig it out.  Baked them at 350 for 7 minutes (I'm at sea level).  Be sure not to roll them out too thin or they'll get crispy.  Looking forward to frustrating them this afternoon!

I just made Halloween cutouts with this recipe and it is the one I have been searching for. I used 3 cups of flour several readers suggested. I also used Golden Crisco instead of margarine. Everyone loved them and my boys keep asking for more. Thanks!

I like these cookies a lot they have real good flavor. Use 3 cups flour or they are harder. They arent hardy though they seemed to break apart easy. Still lookin for the perfect cut outs. Oh and if you tend to have sugar cookies that taste to floury roll them in confectionary sugar or half confectionary sugar half flour

The softest Christmas cookies ever. I followed the recipe exactly and my guests could not get enough of these yummy treats! No one knew sugar cookies could taste so good, even the ones that I did not get a chance to put icing on were eaten! I am not particularily good in the kitchen, but even I could pull these off. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, I will make it for every Christmas to come :)

I rated four for taste. But the dough is impossible to work with! I chilled it 2 hours and it was still very sticky. Then I stuck it in the freezer for a bit, still too sticky. I did put in only 3 cups flour per the other review instructions. Maybe this recipe needs all that flour? I don't know. I ended up making it one big bar cookie on a cookie sheet, even working with it to get it to cover the pan was a chore. I probably won't bother with this recipe again simply because I wanted cut outs and it was impossible to do that.

This is a really tasty cookie for cutouts.  No, it's not sweet (it's not a sugar cookie!--it's supposed to be complimented by a sweet frosting.  It's such an easy recipe it makes for a great family project with the kids.  These actually came out soft, as advertised, unlike others I've tried.  Just be sure to roll them out to the right thickness.  The second time I made them, I added 1 tsp. cinnamon & 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to "spice up" the flavor a bit.  Will definitely make again!

These are really tastey and more importantly, easy to work with.  Some sugar cookies are too soft and don't mold easy while others crumble and don't stick together.  These were perfect.

Outstanding recipe! The dough was a little too soft so I put it in the refrigerator to harden a little, sprinkled a some flour on the board and used a spatula to place them on the cookie sheet to avoid causing too much damage. This is a wonderful year round recipe and taste a million times better than the stuff they sell at the grocery store. You can also make the dough ahead, form into logs, cover with wax paper, and freeze until your ready.

Really nice recipe, but even after 2 hours wasn't firm enough to roll, so i stuck the dough in the freezer for 10 min and it rolled perfectly. makes a nice sugar cookie, i made them thin and crisp and topped with the sugar cookie frosting from this site. Perfect!

can I give this more stars?  Thank you for a fantastic recipe!  This is my new sugar cookie recipe.  I just made these, and OMG they are so good.  They are sweet and buttery, but not excessively so.  I baked them for 10 min.  Frosting will be good, but plain they are amazing.  I used butter and all the flour, and found that it was stiff enough to roll...no chilling needed!  I used the Wilton comfort grip tree cutter, and it made 21 cookies with a couple of scraps.  Thank you so much again!!!

I made these for a children's playgroup.  We used icing and sprinkles to decorate them and they were a HUGE hit.  All of the kids (and the moms) loved the taste and the dough was so easy to work with.  I'll definitely make these again!

great recipe! :) used recs of using butter, baking at 350, only 3C of flour, and also added a touch of spice (nutmeg and cinammon), let sit overnight before baking. easy to roll out and cut.

I really like these cookies. Even my 2 year old is enjoying them. I used sprinkles on top of them. I cannot wait until my daughter is old enough to decorate cookies. This will be the recipe I will use. I found baking for 5 min was long enough. I would give this to anyone needing a great cookie cutter recipe.

This is my second year using this recipe--the cookies taste great and store well.  They are plenty sweet enough, especially if you're sprinkling them with sugar or frosting them.  Just be sure to measure flour properly and don't over-flour when rolling dough (I don't flour the board at all--I use waxed paper). It is easy to transfer the cut-outs from board to baking sheet.  Even the arms and legs of our "gingerbread" people come out intact :-) Thanks for a great recipe!

These are sooooo good! I used butter instead of margerine and so added about 1/4 cup suger. Didn't have cookie cutters so I made flat balls and baked them on ungreased cookie sheets-- came out perfect! (and really pretty!) yay!

YUM!  I have never made sugar cookies before (Mom usually does) & I thought that this was a great recipe!  I chilled the dough while shopping & when I went to roll it, it looked crumbly.  After a small panic, I kinda squished it before rolling & it rolled perfectly.  Be quick, because as it warms, it becomes unruley & sticks.  I used 3 C. of flour & 1/2 C. for the rolling process.  My husband, the "rare" sweet eater said that these were very good.  Thanks Georgie!

Made dough w/ only 3c flour; possibly added bit more vanilla by accident.  Chilled over night...Rolled 10 hrs later; slightly sticky but certainly not a show stopper.  I tried to keep flour for rolling to a minimum to keep cookies tender and I succeeded.  Baked on 350F for slightly longer than 8 minutes. Cookies were great (without frosting!), even the next day!  This recipe will definitely be used for years to come!

These were very good christmas cut out cookies. While they do get crispy after they cool and are waiting to be frosted they soften up after being frosted. They rolled out much easier than others and did not stick to the counter. I added a little nutmeg to the batter to give them more flavor.

(Note: 350 degrees worked best for me)

Thee best sugar cookies ever!!!
These cookies are so soft and yummy I couldn't even believe it.
At first I was dissapointed because they were hard and crunchy...then I realized I had baked them too long.  
(Not good to bake without a timer!)

I planned on bringing these to my parents house for Christmas, but they didn't make it past me and my boyfriend!
My boyfriend also asked me if I could make some for him to bring to work.  (always a good sign)

Excellent texture, great taste, lots of dough, and unbelievably easy to work with. 
This recipe puts Betty Crockers to shame!

these were merely ok..  i found they lacked a good sugary flavour and were very bland.. they looked pretty though because i added red and green food colouring to the dough and made pretty xmas cookies... however, they just tasted like playdough with some sugar in it...

The key word here is "bland".  These cookies are soft and chewy, but have no flavor.  The dough was very sticky, even after being chilled over 2 hours.  I probably won't make them again, but we'll eat them because an "okay" cookie is better than no cookie!

This recipe was great! It was really easy and even after making them with a 3 year old and two 5 year olds I'm not tired of them.  Everybody in my house loves them!

These cookies are amazing! My kids call them 'crack cookies' because they are so addictive! I used butter instead of margarine, and took the advice of another reviewer, using one cup of sugar and one cup of powdered sugar. I also used powdered sugar to roll them out, which kept them from.getting too doughy tasting. They were soft and delicious!

Did what another reviewer suggeted,use butter instead of margarine, and melt it over the stove. It helps to dissolve the sugar, and to help sugars and butters cream better. Use only 3 cups flour. Finally, oven temp at 350 and baking cookies for 8-10 minutes keeps it soft. Lining with parchment paper also helps.

My husband said his grandma made the best sugar cookies ever, so I took that as a challenge. After quizzing him to what he remembered for the taste and texture of the cookies, I decided Grandma must have used almond extract in addition to or instead of the vanilla. I did the standard modifications that everyone else suggested, melted butter instead of margarine, 3 cups of flour, and my own substitution of 2 teaspoons almond extract with a dash of vanilla. Bake at 350 for exactly 8 minutes and the cookies are perfectly chewy with slightly crisp edges. 4 star rating for the modifications, but this is my go to recipe. I won the bake off against Grandma's cookies.

It is the best Christmas cookie recipe ever! :) I am glad that you thought of the recipe. My friends are all fighting for it when I brought it to school. So yeah, I made this cookies 3 times so far, since I just noticed it about last month.

Excellent cookie! I halved the recipe and got about 27 heart-shaped cookies. I cut back a tad on the sugar, as I usually do. Followed some recommendations of using butter and baked at the lower temp of 350 for about 9 min. Another recommendation which I followed was cutting back on the flour (by ~ 1/4 cup), since you're using some when rolling out. I rolled the dough a little thicker because I didn't want too crispy cookies. Nice flavor which you could also change out with lemon extract or whatever. I iced them with Sugar Cooking Icing from this site. This is a cookie keeper! Thanks Georgie!

I followed the recommended advice of 3 cups of flour, reduced the cooking temp to 350 and used butter.  I bake for 6 minutes, rotate and bake for 2 more minutes. This makes the best sugar cookies I've had.  I'm still working on finding the perfect frosting. They are good without frosting, but I love frosted sugar cookies. My co-workers now insist that I make these for pot-luck days.

WOW! This is the perfect cut-out sugar cookie recipe.  My girls always want to make cut-outs and I sometimes avoid it since past recipes were harder to work with.  Like other reviewers, I cut the flour back to 3 cups. They did not get too dry, are nice and and buttery and were easy to handle.  Like the Christmas cookies my Mom used to make :-)  Thanks!!

Only AFTER this turned out to crumble all over did I read ALL the reviews stating to cut the flour back.  "As it is" ...well, it's terrible.  They crumble apart as you try to roll out the dough. I followed this to the letter.

I have been making sugar cookies for over 40 years. It was tradition for us kids and our mom every Christmas to make huge trays to give as gifts. This is the best recipe I have found, and I have tried many recipes over the past decade, trying to find the perfect sugar cookie. These cookies are tender and delicious but hold up to decorating when properly cooled. Don't overcook them unless you prefer a crispy cookie. They are still good, but we prefer them soft and only bake them until they are barely golden at the edges. *I use butter, not margarine. I have also used half whole wheat flour. Since we frost and decorate them anyway, it doesn't matter that they have a darker color from the wheat flour.

I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong here.  Mine turned out the opposite of everyone...not dry and crumbly, but sticky and absolutely impossible to roll.  I tried just baking the dough to salvage some of my work, but the cookies tasted terrible.  Still looking for a good cutout cookie recipe

These cookies were ok. I thought they would be a little better... after reading reviews. They actually taste better when they are cooked just a little longer but of course, then they are not soft! (not burnt but just not soft)

Absolutely perfect! I followed the suggestions and used butter instead of margarine and used 3 cups of flour. I also baked it at 350 degrees in stead of 400 for about 10 minutes. There were no problems rolling them out or using the cookie cutters. These cookies were soft and chewy and melt in your mouth! They were gone in one day. I made them with the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe on this site, and they were great! Also tastes great with some colored sugar sprinkled on the top before you bake. I will definitely use this recipe again...and again and again!

Awesome!  this was the 1st recipe i've ever tried to make roll out cookies and i'm sticking with it!  i did follow the other reviewers and only used 3 c flour and used butter (butter is better!)  Oh, i also used powered sugar instead of flour to roll out the cookies.  i heard that tip somewhere and it worked great.  Great recipe.

I needed an egg-free recipe, and I only had butter in my fridge, so I used two ener-G egg replacer "eggs" instead of real eggs, and butter instead of margarine. I upped the baking powder to 1.5 tsp, and added a tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg for a more Christmas-y flavor. Although I did NOT change the amounts of flour or sugar as some others suggested, I did bake these at 350 for about 12-13 minutes and took them out when they still didn't look quite done. Iced them using the Sugar Cookie Glaze from this site. Two days later, they are still wonderfully chewy and soft, no easy feat for an eggless version of a cookie! I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks!

Really delicious - really soft - really easy!  I took the advice of others and cut the flour down to 3 cups, baked at 350 for 8 minutes, and they are perfect!  Don't roll them out too thin; 1/4 inch is great.

After reading the reviews, I decided to try this recipe and it is my new favorite rolled sugar cookie recipe, replacing my old favorite of 30 years!!  I took the suggestion of using melted butter rather than the margarine, and reduced the flour to 3 1/2 cups.  The dough, after chilling, rolled like a dream and I didn't have to swear even once! The baked cookies held their shapes well and were delicious!

I used this recipe almost exactly. I used 3 1/2c instead of 3 3/4c flour, fresh vanilla because I didn't have extract, added a couple of dashes of cinnamon and made them using a cookie press. They came out BEAUTIFUL. I cooked at 350 degrees and for 8 minutes until the edges were just golden brown. This is by far the best sugar cookie recipe I've  ever used.

I followed the recipe exact to the instructions. tried 3 batches and not one worked, the dough wouldn't stick. It just kept crumbling apart. I'm a super baker and NEVER had this problem before...

Love this recipe. Perfect soft cookie, with a lightly crunchy edge. I followed other reviews and only used 3 cups of flour. I used 'sugar cookie icing' recipe from this site. Made Valentine's cookies for coworkers and they were a big hit. Can't wait to make again in different shapes and sizes. I was thinking smiley faces and four leaf clovers

This recipe tastes great and the cookies do stay softer than most sugar cookies. I used cookie icing to add color to the cut outs.

These are great. I cut the recipe in half as there are only 2 adults and a toddler at our house. I baked for 5 min as they started to burn at 6. I used butter instead of margarine and chilled for only about 40 min.

a very great recipe fora soft sugar cookie!  i think i would prefer these as a drop cookie, so that they were much thicker.  when rolled thin to be cutouts, i don't love them as much.  but they are great for decoarting, the dough is extremely easy to roll out and cut out, and my kids really liked them.  i really dislike crunchy sugar cookies, so these will be my go to recipe for cut-outs now!

Great & easy recipe. Cookies were delicious!  Don't leave dough in fridge for more than 2 hours or it gets a bit hard to work with. Always put a piece of bread in tin or boc with cookies to keep them moist and chewy. Delicious!

This is an excellent cookie recipe for rolled & cut cookies.  Every year for Christmas, I use a different recipe for my cut out cookies because I have never found a recipe that I am partial to.  Well, this is it.  I have saved this recipe & will use year after year.  I made it exactly as stated, except that I found that after I mixed everything together, I needed to add a little more flour to make the batter more stiff for rolling & cutting (maybe 1/4 cup more).  The recipe works perfect in that after you use the cookie cutters, the dough cookies come right up without breaking & it actually tastes good!  This is a keeper. Thank you Georgie!

Baked these cookies for Christmas eve. I halved the recipe as we only have a couple of people over at my house. They were absolutely amazing. 

I made the dough and chilled it for three hours yesterday. I then baked the cookies, and today frosted them. The frosting went right on and they were probably the best looking and tasting cookies I've ever made. They tasted heavenly and were soft all through. We have not yet served them but me and my aunt tried a few and they were really really good. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I am new to cooking myself.  I have only made the dough as of yet, but I can tell that these cookies will be easy.  These cookies are similar to "white cookies" my mom used to make.  She recommends I used parchment paper instead of the hassle of greasing baking pans.  I love this recipe!!!!!

followed the exact recipe and these are amazing! The dough is a little crumbly and hard to work with if its very cold but once it warms up a bit its a nice easy dough. I refridgerated the cut out cookies for 15 min or so before putting them in the oven to help them retain their shape

I just made these with my daughter and they turned out pretty good.  I followed others' advice and used 3 cups flour, and baked at 350.  The dough turned out a bit sticky for cut-out cookies, but once we just started making drop cookies, things went much quicker.  Whether the cookies were shaped or not, they tasted great!

Very good recipe.  I also cut the flour down to 3 cups, and put 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup powdered sugar.  It was pretty dry/flaky when I was trying to roll it out, so I added 1 tbsp of 1% milk to the dough.  It was was pretty sticky after that, but after dusting the counter and rolling pin with flour it ended up being just the right texture to roll out and stay in the cut-out shape.  

For the frosting, I just mixed powdered sugar, milk and vanilla extract and had my 9 year old sprinkle away.

These were tasty. I thought they got a little tough after a stay in the fridge and baking, and a little less buttery than I like, but they were still delicious.

Delicious soft cookies! I followed others and only added 3 cups of flour and used about 1/2 a cup more when rolling it out. I also baked at 350 for 8-10 minutes! Will use this recipe again!

Very good cookies.  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. The best part was they did not stick at all to the wax paper and I was able to easily pick them up and set them on the cookie sheet.  I did turn down my oven to 375 degrees, but more because the sheets I used were very dark.

Not a big hit, though they were easy to work with.  I made the dough one night, stuck it in the fridge and made them the next night.  I LOVED the trick of rolling it between two sheets of parchment paper!  I thought the cookies tasted like margarine while hubby thought they tasted floury and not sweet enough.  It's hard to find a good lactose-free recipe.  I might give it another try with half margarine and half shortening.  Thanks for sharing.

I followed the advice of others and used only 3 cups of flour and reserved the rest for dusting while rolling (needed only a scant amount as this dough rolled out beautifully!).  I used this cookie dough to make the melted snowman cookie (this site) for a bake sale, and received rave reviews. Thanks for the recipe!

We LOVE these cookies!  They turned out great!  We also made the recommended adjustments. :)  Thanks for the great recipe! :)
".use butter instead of marg, and melt it over the stove. It helps to dissolve the sugar, and to help sugars and butters cream better. Use only 3 cups flour. Finally, oven temp at 350 and baking cookies for 8-10 minutes keeps it soft. Lining with parchment paper also helps. Keep an eye out...they will seem too pale to remove from the oven, but just when the center doesn't look "wet" anymore, it is done. They still bake for 2 or so minutes, so they will darken up a little and be perfect.

These cookies are buttery, sweet, and soft. This recipe is the perfect recipe for the holidays to have fun with family and friends in the kitchen. Some were frosted, sprinkled with color sugar, and left plain. The edges baked golden brown which added just a little more flavor. I divided the dough into thirds and froze the last third. Well, I just baked the last sweet morsel last night and used a fluted edge to cut squares and they tasted just as sweet and buttery as the others from Christmas. I'll be doing this again for Easter using an egg shaped cutter. Just wonderful.

I've searched for the perfect sugar cookies for Christmas eve for my family to make all season and came across this one. I also used 3 cups of flour and baked on 350 until the outside edges were brown. On Christmas eve my entire family got together and decorated this cookies & could not wait to eat them. By far the best recipe I have tried will use again and again and again!

This is a keeper. I did read and took the suggestions for 3 cups of flour, use butter, and cook at 350 for 6-8 minutes and they turned out light and crispy around the center and nice and moist inside, a dry moist though. I cut them a little thinner than 1/4 so they could be used as a coffee cookie.

This recipe absolutely deserves 5 stars.  It is so easy to make and very yummy!  I didn't change a thing with this recipe, and had no problems with it.  I put the dough in the refrigerator overnight so we could make cookies quickly today for Santa.  The dough rolled out great (although next time I might let it warm a little because it gave my biceps a workout!).  I did bake at 350 degrees rather than 400 degrees, and it took about 10-12 minutes.  I kept a close eye on them because once these start to brown, they brown quickly.  I have already had 2 (they have barely cooled), and am trying not to eat more!  I usually buy premade sugar cookie dough, but I will use this recipe from now on.

Very good! I made them with 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup pow. sugar. I baked them at 350 at first for about 14-16 minutes. BUT then baked the rest at 400 for 8ish minutes. They turned out great! My 19 yr. old son that doesn't like sweets ate one!! Thanks for sharing!

Very good cookie. Very easy to make dough and equally as easy to prepare cookies. I didn't use margarine (I never have it, I only use butter) and they came out great. This recipe is a keeper.

I have tried a few different receipes. None of them compare with this one. I absolutely love it. Thank you so much for a great new favorite receipe. I think it will be great for other holiday cookie cut outs as well. The only thing I'm doing different next time is doubling the receipe. Thanks again!!!

These are amazing and easy. They taste fresh up to 4 days old. At day 5 they were dried out. I'm making this recipe every year from now on!! Perfect recipe as written. No need to change it. (Besides real butter, I like real butter! :)

Good recipe, easy to follow.  Taste is pretty good for a sugar cookie, easy to handle too.  Mine didn't puff as much as I thought they would but they were fun to cut out and to decorate.  I made bells, christmas trees and cardinals.  Rather than make many different batches of icing, I glazed them white, and sprinkled with the appropriate color sugar then decorated with mini M&Ms.  Pretty cute!  Thanks!

As other reviewers did, I used 3 c of flour, butter instead of shortening, and baked at 350 for about 7 min. These are buttery & not too sweet, going well with sweet toppings & icing. I rolled them out using plastic wrap over the dough (plus some flour on the dough & work surface) so the rolling pin didn't stick to the dough. Cut out stars & trees, placed on parchment paper. I took them out just as they puffed up and were only very slightly brown in some areas around the edges. I prefer them a little on the soft, underbaked side. I let them rest 1 min on the sheets, then removed to cool on a wire rack. I'm glad I found this recipe! Maybe next time I'll try it with 1 tsp vanilla & 1 tsp almond extract.

I'll start by admitting I used shortening because my husband is allergic to dairy and I couldn't find our usual margarine that doesn't have whey powder in it.  I've made a LOT of sugar cookies, mostly using a recipe that includes butter and sour cream... soft and delicious and easy to work with. This dough was impossible to work with.  It crumbled when I rolled it or removed the cookie cutters.  The cookies themselves are quite tasty, although not exactly soft.  More like not crispy as long as you make them thick and underbake them. I'm going back to my old recipe and trying it with non-dairy sour cream.

WoW! These cookies were amazing. I used half butter/half crisco. Make sure you allow dough to set for 2 hours otherwise it will get soft and hard to cut out w/cutters. You will NOT be disappointed. They puff up slightly and taste wonderful.

These ended up being quite good, though I did have issues with the dough being very soft and sticky, which made it hard to roll. I just kneaded in some extra flour and all was well, though I don't understand the reviews that said they used less flour because I definately needed to use more. The flavor was great and they had a nice sweetness. While they did keep their shape, they also puffed slightly. This will not replace my usual cut out recipe, but it was nice to try something different, and on occasion, I will use this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

These cookies were really nice because they were quick, i only got to eat a few of them, but they were really good.  They are much better with frosting.

I mixed it up and refrigerated it.  My daughter rolled them out and my other daughter baked them.  They were a bit stiff straight out of the refrigerator but it worked.  I thought she rolled them out a bit thick but I would roll them thicker the next time.  They baked them for 6 mins and cooled for a bit before putting on a wire rack.  Even thinner than I like they were still soft.  We iced them with Barbara's Butter Icing (from this site).   DELICIOUS!!   Will be making both recipes again!

Fabulous, soft cut-out cookie!! I used what the recipe called for, and they turned out great( except I used butter instead of margarine because it's what I had)! I was impatient, so I just used more flour to roll them out right away! They turned out great, even with the extra flour I had to use to roll them out without chilling them!!  I made them again and chilled them for the 2 hours, and they also turned out great! 7 min. was the magic time for my oven, they look a bit underdone, but don't over bake them. These cookies stay nice and soft even days after baking and icing them. The flavor is mild and sweet, and the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe with a little orange zest added really jazzed them up! Everybody loves them, I will use this again and again, thanks Georgie!

I have made sugar cookies for years and this is the best I have found. I always substitute butter for margarine in all of my recipes, but that was the only change I made. I baked them for Christmas and again for Valentines day, frosted them with a simple powder sugar milk icing and decorated accordingly. Everyone loved them.

This was a fantastic recipe with the reviewer recommendations! I made these for XMAS. I will be making again for Valentine's Day this weekend! I did use butter instead of the margarine and I used a little over 3 cups of flour, per other reviewer's suggestions. For a soft cookie, be sure to roll out the dough per instructions. Any thinner will result in a crispy cookie.

Yum! This recipe provided me with many soft, delicious, cookies. The only thing I changed was the margarine - I used butter instead. Sugar cookies just taste so much better with butter!

I don't know what I did wrong to this recipe, but it was the worst recipe I've ever used for a cut out cookie. I used butter instead of margarine, but that was the only thing I changed. The dough was crumbly and dry, and wouldn't roll out worth a . When we baked them, we had to shorten the cooking time by nearly 3 minutes or they would get hard and crunchy after sitting for just a few minutes cooling.

The first time I accidentally baked them at 400 *F as the recipe stated and browned the edges far too much.  Definitely use 350*.  I reduced the flour to 3 cups and used butter.  The dough handles nicely if you keep it chilled.  Make sure you roll them out thick or they won't be vey soft.  I got a lot of comments about how good these tasted with Sugar Cookie Frosting on top.

These cookies turned out okay in the end but I won't be making them again.  The dough was very hard to work with even after refrigerating it.  Plus not all my cookies came out soft, it was kind of a hit or miss even if they were from the same rolled out dough and the same cookie cutter.

Wonderfully soft and delicious cookies! Rated it 4 stars as it's always best to use confectioners sugar to roll them out in as to much flour changes the way the cookie comes out. Added nutmeg as well as almond extract. Used my own icing and they turned out AWESOME!!

This recipe was very good.  I used butter and the suggested 3 cups flour as previous users did.  The only thing, I was not able to get the cookies to stay soft...but that could be that I cooked them too long.  We'll see for the next batch.  Overall, very good recipe!!

As the multiple reviews recommend, I used 3 1/3 cups flour and 1 cup butter instead of margarine.  I divided my dough into 2 balls and refrigerated for 3 hours.  I then used powdered sugar to roll out my dough and cookie cutters to cut out Christmas shapes.  Make sure to put the chilled cut-out dough in the oven right away so that the cookies hold their shape.  The cookies turned out beautifully with sharp edges (no spreading!) and chewy centers.  I can't emphasize enough the importance of cutting out thick cookies or else they will be too crispy.  I cut out super thick cookies and baked them at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes.  Be careful not to over-bake your cookies; watch the edges because they will brown suddenly.  After cooling the cookies, I used the recipe for Sugar Cookie Icing to frost my cookies.  They looked beautiful and tasted amazing!  This recipe is so much better than the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies recipe.  I'm so glad that I've finally found a sugar cookie recipe that's a keeper!

I was excited about the consistancy of this cookie  because i knew it would be perfect for cookie cutters. However, I thought the end product was  too bland. It did make beautiful cookies though.

Great recipe! I ended up making the dough on a Monday evening and then double wrapping it in plastic wrap and putting it in the fridge and didn't get to baking it until Wednesday night. It was super! It rolled out very easily. I heavily dusted the counter w/ powdered sugar instead of flour to make sure it didn't stick.  Tasted great and can't wait to decorate them!

Awesome cookies! I tried making the best rolled sugar cookies from this site and the dough was horrible to work with. This dough is so soft and easy to use. I took the advise of other reviewers and used powedered sugar to help roll them out instead of flour. I also only used 3 cups of flour and baked at 350 for 10 minutes. They are perfect. I will ice them tonight....yum!

My husband really liked them and was sad when I was sharing them. He said regular sugar cookies were nothing special but these are not regular sugar cookies and I need to make them again. They retained their shape, and were easy to decorate, and very soft. I took them out of the oven at exactly 8minutes, they didn't look done, but did after the cooling period. They were even soft the next day! I accidentally used a little more vanilla (+1/4tsp), and it went over very well.

Very good sugar Christmas cookie recipe. I frosted some and iced some others and they came out delicious. I also only used the 3 cups of flour as others suggested. I couldn't imagine using any more.

This dough worked up beautifully.  I usually have a problem with cutout cookies spreading and becoming too crispy, but these stayed true to shape and remained soft.  They seem just a bit salty, but I used self-rising flour, so maybe that is the reason.  Thanks!

I didn't have great luck with this recipe. The dough was delicious and seemed to have a good consistency, but even with using TONS of flour, it kept sticking to my cookie cutters and the table. I took others advice and used 3 cups of flour and real butter to make the dough, but I can't figure out what kept going wrong. We ended up just making regular round cookies and decorating them with colored sugar and M & M's and they were yummy. I would have liked some cute cut-out cookies though!

Cookie cutters and I were not friends until I found this recipe! Tonight my family and I were finally able to enjoy sugar cookies that actually looked like the pumpkins, moons, & ghosts that they were meant to be! I did follow other reviewers advice and baked at 350 F for 8-10 minutes and rolled the dough out thick. I started to use only 3 overflowing cups of flour, but chickened out and added another 1/4 cup. Will definitely be my "go to" sugar cookie cut-out recipe.

I have tried many different sugar cookie recipes, and this is by far the best one I have ever made!  The dough was VERY easy to work with (no sticking to the rolling pin or to the counter) and the cookies held their shape wonderfully!  And to top it off, the cookies tasted great too!  I'm glad I found this recipe in time for the holidays!

I am giving this recipe five stars because I did do some tweeking and they came out excellent.  I followed others' advice and used butter and 3 cups of flour.  Instead of using vanilla extract, I used one vanilla bean, and 1/4 tsp of almond extract. Cut them into heart shapes and sprinkled with sugar before baking.  The flavor was awesome.  I think the next time I make them, I will use 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening, that way they wont' spread as much.

I certainly have no complaints with this recipe!  Super simple, super easy and the cookies came out nice and soft! Cooked each batch for exactly 8 minutes and they all came out perfect!  Great flavor too, so these will definitely be eaten up.  Decorated with Sugar Cookie Icing and sprinkles!  We had a blast! Thanks!

Excellent sugar cookie recipe.  I used 3-1/4 C flour as another reviewer suggested saving the remainder of the flour for use when rolling the dough out.  I also frosted my cookies using the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe submitted by JBS Box on this website.  Delicious cookies.  Soft and not overly sweet.

These were the best sugar cookies I've ever had! They were easy to mix, easy to roll out, and baked up perfectly. I baked them on waxed paper on a cookie sheet. My co-workers couldn't get enough! They're even delicious straight from the freezer. I doubt I'll ever use another sugar cookie recipe again.

Followed others advice and only used 3 cups of flour and used real butter. Let chill overnight. Flavor improved from chilling, warmed up quickly when rolling out - had to make sure there was plenty of flour down to keep cookies from sticking. Easily rolled out very thin too. Worked out well and tasted fine.

Good but not amazing.  May have been better if I iced them.  I followed the suggestions of others and used 3c flour and melted the butter as well as cooked for 8-10 minutes at 350.  Not bad but I'm still searching for the absolute best

I did not care for these cookies. I was soo dissappointed! They had a strange aftertaste, and I used name brand products. I couldn't seem to nab them at the perfect time to take them out of of the oven. They were either too crunchy or too soft. Mine also were very crumbly.

Followed the advice from the other reviews -- I used 3 cups of flour, 1/2 butter 1/2 margarine, and baked at 350 for 8 minutes.  My son's allergic to eggs, so I used an extra 2 t baking powder, 3 T oil, and 3 T water to replace the eggs.  Rolled out really well after refrigerating overnight, and quite tasty too.

This recipe is fantastic.  I have a traditional butter based recipe but all I had at home was margarine and baking powder.  After doing an ingrediant search this came up and it was just what I was hoping for!  Delicious soft cookies that were fun to decorate!

These are some of the yummiest cookies I've ever made!  I used real butter (unsalted) and only 3 cups flour.  I used almost another cup while rolling them out.
I cooked at 375 for close to 10 min, until just browning.  They were crispy and soft, just the way I  love sugar cookies!

Very good and DEFINITELY use only 3 CUPS of flour and ALL butter.  Other reviewers were right on with that tip.  And bake at 350.  Soft, tender, buttery and melt in your mouth delicious and I like the fact that it stays soft.  Bake just until it's no longer wet in the middle, will look undone but will complete it's cooking once you take it out. And no need to roll if you want round cookies.  I roll them into walnut size balls right after it's mixed and push down with the bottom of a glass.  (you need to flatten them a little, or else they won't spread well).  But dough is definitely easier to work with after it's had a chance to chill.  1 hour is good for me.  Want Snickerdoodles?  Chill, than roll them into balls and then coat with cinnamon/sugar mix and bake.

Based on all the good reviews, I was expecting an outstanding cookie, but we were very disappointed in these.  They tasted extremely floury and doughy and really didn't have much taste at all.  I'll stick to my previous recipe for now.

Great recipe!  Very easy!  My first batch was good, a little crumbly but not too much.  I followed others who suggested dropping the amount of flour (I think I used 3 1/4 cups).  My 3rd batch was left in the fridge for almost 24 hours and was still easy to use and not crumbly or dry at all!  Everyone who has tried them has given rave reviews.  This has now become the only sugar cookie recipe I will use.  I frost all the cookies.

This recipe is perfect.  I have been making it for years with no adjustments.  Occasionally I add a splash of almond extract - depends on my mood.  It is a very soft dough, so chill between each rolling for ease of use.  I love to cut out big circles ( with a biscuit cutter), then small hearts or stars in half the circles -- sandwich with a high quality jam.  DElicious.  Be sure to remove cookies from oven when barely brown on edges.  Cool for a few moments on cookie sheet before removing to cooling rack.  Enjoy.

These cookies are by far the best sugar cookies ever - I love a soft sugar cookie.  My kids just can't stop eating them!  We cut out and frosted them - yummy!

These were very good sugar cookies - held their shape well and stayed soft.  I followed previous suggestions: only 3 1/4 flour, butter instead of margarine, and baked at 350.  I frosted with a buttercream frosting.  These cookies got rave reviews from all the guests at the bbq I took them to.

Turned out well.  I used Promise margarine & reduced temp to 350 (per reviews).  To those who have a problem with sticky dough: -1-try freezing it an hour or two, or refrigerate overnight -2- roll dough (about 2c at a time) between 2 pieces of floured plastic wrap.

These cookies came out really well, but I can only give 3 stars as I made changes and don't think they would have turned out right if I hadn't. I reduced the flour to 3 cups as other reviewers suggested, used butter instead of margarine, and baked at 350 (I cannot imagine anything but burnt cookies at 400!).

After cutting the flour down to 3 cups and the oven temp to 350 cooking around 5-7 min. These cookies were WONDERFUL! My family loved them with and without frosting. They were like the cookies you get at the bakery if not better. For those who had a negative reaction to this recipie, try it with the changes I and others have suggested and see how they turn out. I will deffinitly use this in the future. GREAT COOKIES!

Super easy to make and even easier to eat.  This is a recipe that will please everyone in my Christmas Cookie Excahnge.

As an alternative, I used reduced fat butter that was unsalted and it all worked out really well!

This was a great recipe!  I had never made sugar cookies before and they turned out great.  I followed the adivce of others and only put in 3 cups of flour.  And I also used real butter, of course!

Just okay. I added a tsp of cinnamon and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  As is the cookie was not to sweet. Really it resembled a thick, semi-sweet dough that was baked.  I took a suggested frosting recipe that was posted on a review and that made it a little sweeter. It was just okay.  I probably wont make this again though.

I'd given up on sugar cookies because so many recipes disappointed me.  Thanks to the tips from previous reviewers, these came out great.  I didn't have butter so I added flavor by substituting butter-flavor crisco for half the margarine.  I also used less flour, baked them at 350, and used half vanilla, half almond extract.  I took the easy way out and decorated them using cake frosting, with colored icing drizzled on top.  Fabulous and easy, too.

I made these for the first time this year for Christmas.  They turned out wonderfully and were delicious.  I'm not a big fan of cookie cutters so this sugar cookie recipe was a bonus for me, I think that they were the best sugar cookies I've ever made, I had a lot of compliments on them. yum!

This was my first try at homemade sugar cookies.  It was very easy and lots of fun for everyone.  I have a toddler and a teenager and we all had a ball.  I think I will adjust the bake time on the next try because they turned out a little too brown on the bottom but tasted excellent.  Thanks Georgie.

My sister in law forwarded this recipe to me after I had asked for her recipe.
I am a novice baker and enjoyed this recipe. It was easy to roll out and I liked
the suggestion to place the sprinkles on before baking.  Next time, I will use
less flour, both in mixing and rolling out, mine were not "soft" but very delicious.

They were a pretty good sugar cookie.  The taste wasn't spectactular, nor was the dough spectacularly easy to work with.  It took a good bit of extra flour.  I will use it again if I don't find anything better.

Great Recipe!  Love the high vanilla content.  I use butter instead of margarine.  We use this recipe all year around (for birthdays, Easter, Valentine's Day...)  My son takes these to school for his birthday every year.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I was looking for an easy recipe to do it with my daughter together and found this one. Everyhting was great except the softness of the cookies. They weren't soft at all. But my family looved it and even friends were eating cookies for the whole evening combining them with other dishes on the table which looked very funny...

This is a pretty good sugar cookie recipe. Nice flavor and pretty easy to handle. I chilled the dough overnight and found it easy to handle. I also transferred the cut shapes back into the refrigerator on a wax paper-lined cutting board before placing on cooking sheet for baking. This allowed me to more easily handle the cookies. I also added 1/2 tsp of lemon extract, which people enjoyed.

I did what the others said and added 3 cups of flour and I used softened butter, not melted! Softened! I cooked at 350 for exactly 8 minutes no more no less (For my oven, atleast!! Make sure its a 1/4 inch think, use a ruler like me! They're the softest cookies I've had and they barely lasted 2 days in my house. Then I decorated with royal icing, it was so good.

This is my GO TO sugar cookie recipe. I cut the flour to 3 1/4 cups and use real butter in place of the margarines.  I also reduce oven temp to 375.  It must be my oven, but I bake for a full 9 minutes and they are pure  perfection.No dark edges and dry on top, not brown.  I roll chilled dough between two layers of plastic wrap then place the rolled dough, plastic wrap and all  on a cookie sheet and pop in the freezer for about ten minutes. They cut perfectly without flour, so I can re roll again until the dough is gone. If the dough becomes too warm and soft, I pop it back in the fridge while I roll out the rest of the  chilled dough. The key for me  is to have cold dough before you cut the cookies. They handle MUCH easier, hold their shape better  and are not sticky.  Decorate with your favorite royal icing.  Always a hit!

I waited a few days before I left a review because I wanted to make sure that the cookies lived up to their name of being soft - they did! I prefer these cookies over another highly rated sugar cookie on this site, and I will probably always stick with this one as the other ones hardened up a lot after only about a day. Very simple and easy to make also. Thank you for sharing your recipe, Georgie!

Followed the recipe to the letter. I used colored sugar on my cookies becuase I am decoratively challenged. These cookies came out so perfect, my niece accused me of buying them from the store and setting them on a platter. No one believed I made them. Those that saw me make them vouched for me. This will remain in the arsenal forever!

After reading through the reviews I had the same outcome (Crumbly dough), then soon after I realized my mistake as I had added 1/2 of butter instead of 1 cup like it calls for. This may be the cause of the crumbly dough people are speaking of. As for the taste it's exactly what I expected, a cookie the will be great for frosting.

I love a soft sugar cookie for cutouts, and this recipe made just that! After reading the reviews, I made a couple changes. I baked at 350 for 8 minutes. I used butter in place of margerine. I only used 3 1/4 cup of flour. I did 1 Cup granulated sugar and 1 cup confectioners sugar. I added extra vanilla extract. I really enjoyed these cookies and I will make them again!

I made this recipe exactly as written except that I used 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of almond extracts.  The dough was exceptionally easy to work with, not sticky at all, the flavor was terrific and my cut-out shapes maintained their shape in the oven!  What more could you ask from a sugar cookie?  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you.  I rolled the dough 1/8" thick to make crispier cookies and I got about 3 dozen 4" snowmen cookies.

I left out a bit of the flour, substituted some brown sugar for the white (1/4 cup) and mixed in some sprouted whole wheat flour for nutrition purposes. i melted the butter completely before mixing. and a few other modifications for my family's preferences. all around as is or modified this is a great base recipe for chewy cookies i make snicker-doodles, sugar, and chocolate chip cookies with this dough. double the batch and make multiple types of cookies  in one swoop!

As written the dough was dry and crumbly and almost impossible to use. We salvaged it enough to make a dozen and cut back the cooking time. The only positive was that the cookies held their cut out shapes well.  I usually make cookies with butter but these tasted just slightly off with margarine. My intent was to make a cookie with less dairy in it.  I will try using 3c of flour next time and up the vanilla perhaps to help offset the margarine notes I detected.  Definitely follow the modifications offered by others if you want to make this recipe.

FANTASTIQUE!!! Thumbs up recipe. This recipe is the best I've tryed in like Forever! I do agree with using butter instead of margarine, preheating the oven to 350 for 8-10 minutes instead of 6-8 minutes at 400 and using 3 cups of flour instead of 4. When you make those changes it's like I'm eating a cloud. A soft, tasty cloud. Also, when you add icing onto it, it's so yummy! I recommend this recipe for any special occasion or anything even if it's just seeing friends. I definitely rate this 5 stars. And this is an old recipe from around 2002 so EXELLENT work. 5 STARS

Great recipe! I had to improvise and use half margerine and half butter flavored crisco because I didn't have enough margerine. Tastes great.  Easy to roll for cutouts or good rolled in sugar and flattened. Decorated some with colored sugar and some with icing, all were delish!

Made this recipe yesterday and put it in the fridge overnight. Thawed for 30 minutes today and cut big ball into four pieces to use. Did follow one recommendation to cut the flour a little. So only put in 3 1/4 cups in each batch. Made two batches. Reduced temp in oven to 350 degrees and 7 minutes seemed just about right. Overall made 150 cut out cookies of varying sizes and about 1/4" thickness. Love them! Soft in the middle and not hard on the outside. Will plan to frost them with a hardening frosting.

I just tried a half batch of these. I've tried several cut out recipes that I didn't care for too much. I did change a couple of things: I used salted butter instead of margarine, I used powdered sugar instead of granulated and I split the vanilla extract with some almond extract as well. I also reduced the oven temp to 375 and baked for 8 minutes.

Just love.  Followed recommendations to roll in confectioners sugar and replaced half white sugar with brown sugar.  Also added some honey to the mix.  Made them a couple of times.  Always a big hit.  I use my kids small play-doh toy cookie cutters amd made about 70 cookies for my daughters Christmas party!

Used this recipe since 2002 when I came across it. Love it! I do use butter in place of margarine. Also if you have one, a baking stone bakes them nicer than a metal sheet. Kids look forward to Christmas cut outs every year!

First time making sugar cookies--they turned out nicely, especially the second batch.  I followed the alterations that many other people did--reduced the flour to 3 cups and baked at 350.  I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I tried three different shapes--Christmas trees, stars, and gingerbread men.  The stars (probably because of their smaller size) ended up burning while the others turned out fine.

As suggested, use 3 cups flour in dough + 1/2 cup to roll.  I used 1/4 margarine and 3/4 butter as it's what I had on hand.  Excellent.

These tasted like Nilla Wafers, I did not like them. The only thing I did differently was that I used butter because I didn't have marg. Not sure if that could be the culprit!

Simple and delightful! I made this recipe 3 times and each one came out better than the last (use real butter, it tastes better). It made about 30 cookies, which was just enough for what I had planned. I brought them to a Christmas party and they were a huge hit with the children AND the adults.

I went with the suggestion to only use 3 cups of flour, and it's the stickiest dough I've ever seen--about the same as bisquick sausage balls.  Not what I was expecting.  Very hard to work with.  I got 5 cookies for Santa and gave up.

This recipe was just ok. It needed some modifications. After reading other peoples reviews I added butter instead of margarine which I agreed with. I did not add any salt, due to the fact the butter is salty. Don't cut out the extra flour, do add the 3 3/4 amount, after letting it sit overnight the dough was still so sticky and hard to work with, adding that extra flour will help, even though when you roll it out you will still add another cup or so. I think it called for to much sugar 1 cup was perfect. Also it needed more flavor so I put in 1 tsp almond extract and 1 tsp of cream of tart. Do bake at 350 for 9 minutes! And perfect.

Perfect, the dough was easy to handle and the cut outs did not lose their shapes in the oven. Also not overly sweet so will work well with the frosting! Only sugar cookie recipe I will use from now on.

Oh My Gosh! I haven't even iced them yet and they are fabulous! I just pulled the last batch out of the oven and I could not be happier. As others suggested, I used butter instead of margarine and baked them at 350 for 10 minutes. I was dubious when I pulled them out because they just didn't have that golden glow that I'm used to but just letting them sit on the tray for another minute was perfect. All I can hear from my family is 'Mmmmmm, yummmmmm, ooooohhhhhh'... If I can just keep them out of the kitchen long enough to actually ice the cookies, that would be great ;)
Fabulous recipe - will never use anything else!

Tried this with the suggested modifications (butter instead of margarine, only 3 cups of flour). The cookies tasted great and stayed soft even after cooling. As the dough warmed up though, the cookies made from the warmer dough became puffy, so watch out for that.

Great recipe!  Easy to make.  My daughter & I made a bunch to give away and they were so easy to make up.  We did cut the flour to 1 cup, used melted butter and chilled the dough.  It was so easy to handle.  Also substituted the vanilla with almond extract and they tasted wonderful.

I did make the recipe following the adjustments made my others of reducing the amount of flour and melting the butter.  These sugar cookies are by far the best I've ever made.  Thanks for sharing both the recipe and the suggestions!  This will be my "go to" sugar cookie recipe!!

My daughter & I tested these cookies today.  Other viewers suggested cutting back on flour so we did the same, they were very good! I do suggest adding more vanilla and almond extract.  Dough rolled out easily w/out adding much flour, thanks for the recipe :-)

Great, delicious cookies! I just made another batch for a Christmas cookie exchange and they came out perfect! I did decrease the flour by about 1/4 cup and I almost never bake with butter, but I do use a high end baking margarine. It's never failed me yet! So if you like butter - go for it! But if not, know that using a good quality baking margarine will yield excellent results too. Since the margarine is salted, I omit the extra salt called for in this recipe. (Something I do for almost all recipes, really. You rarely need to add more if your butter or margarine is salted.) I also often use almond extract in my sugar cookies for that extra little something that everyone seems to love. And lastly, for the sugar in this recipe, I use 1 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 cup light brown sugar. It makes the cookies a bit softer and even easier to roll out.

This has got to be your "go to" cut-out cookie recipe when the occasion arises.  My grandson's 3rd grade last year flipped out over the heart shaped cookies he shared with his classmates. They're soft with a slight crunch around the edge, just like you'd expect from a great cookie recipe.  Dough is very easy to work with and the taste is exactly what you'd hoped for; delicious. I'm looking forward to 4th grade encore presentation on Valentine's Day!!

I followed the advice from other reviewers and kept back 1/2 cup of flour (all-purpose, organic white flour). I don't use margarine, so I used 1/2 cup of soft, salted organic butter and 1/2 cup soft shortening. (This ratio makes the best pie crust, btw) I was able to form the dough into 4 balls to refrigerate for an hour, but when I tried to knead and roll it, it crumbled into a huge mess. I tried to warm it in my hands, but the temperature wasn't the problem. There was still too much flour in the dough, and in no way could I roll it out well enough to cut shapes from it. Instead of throwing this mess in the garbage, I added more soft butter along with a bit of water, and was able to salvage the dough . Another egg/egg yolk may have helped bind it better too, but I didn't have any more eggs. With those changes, the cookies ended up pretty good, but they are not this recipe. One positive thing I can say is that I appreciated how mildly sweet the cookies turned out, as I don't like super sugary foods.

Perfect! I changed only the things the other reviewers had recommended; replacing margarine with butter, reducing the flour and sugar and they were perfect! We worked with the kids and it was fun cutting out the shapes, baking, eating, decorating, eating, packing in Xmas gift bags, eating...in that order ;-) !

These were just okay. The actual cookie itself doesn't have much flavor so you have to add icing which is what I did but I will not make this cookie again.

I followed previous reviewers suggestions and used only 3 cups of flour, and these came out perfect. A great recipe for cookie cutters! I used the Royal Icing III on this website with them, and they were a huge hit!

These cookies were the first successful sugar cut-out cookies I have ever made! Usually when I attempt to make cut-out cookies it ends in a lot of ruined, deformed shapes and tantrums, but this time was different- I chilled the dough over night and the cut-outs worked perfectly! The dough was perfect and the cookies came out great- this is my official sugar cookie recipe :)

I love frosted cookies, and have spent the better part of the last 15 years searching for the perfect recipe. Friends, my search is over. I cut the flour down to 3 cups, baked them for 10 minutes exactly (in which time they did not brown AT ALL... in fact my mom saw them cooling and thought they hadn't even been cooked yet!), and they came out PERFECT. Soft and chewy and flavorful. One batch made about 48 cookies as the recipe suggests, but the cutters I used are pretty small.... maybe 1.5 x 2.5". For bigger cookies you may want to double the recipe.

These were delicious! It was my 18 month old son's first year making Christmas cookies, which needless to say was an adventure. Even with having to roll it out 1000 times and having to keep flouring the board over and over, they came out delicious. Thank you for a great recipe!

First just let me say that I do not make cut out cookies often at all. That said, I was pretty much flying by the seat of my pants, looking for a recipe that both tasted good and wasn't too difficult. I couldn't have been happier with this recipe. It was easy to put together and the dough was easy to work with after chlling. The cookie itself was not overly sweet, which was a good thing considering that they were going to be decorated with icing. I used the "sugar cookie icing" recipe from this site, which I loved. The cookies turned out soft and delicious. A great recipe!

One of the best I've tried so far.  Makes a great soft sugar cookie!  I found that smaller shapes work better, some of the larger ones broke fairly easy.

I have used this recipe for 2 Christmases now and love the flavor and texture of these cookies.  Nothing compares in my opinion.  I used 1 cup of sugar b/c of the added frosting. I love this recipe.  Thank you for sharing it!

Just took out the first batch and yum! These were so easy to make. I did let the dough sit in the fridge overnight just because I did several different types of cookies yesterday and by the time the dough was ready, I was too tired. I also followed other reviewers advice and only used the 3 C of flour. I think this is a keeper!

What can I say other than awesome!!! My son ate so many of these that I have to make a new batch for the cookie trays I am making. Think this time I will just roll them in a log and roll them in red and green sugar and slice to bake for speeds sake, lol.

Made these today & I must say that are worthy of 5 starts. I have made a few other recipes for cut out cookies but this is the best I have come across yet! I love them, they are soft & buttery. I read the recommendations and baked at 350 degrees for 10 min. & they turned out soft & flavorful. Will make again.

The cookies were good, but the dough was too sticky to work with.  If I was going to make another sugar cookie again in the future, it'd be a different recipe.

I made these cookies over my traditional recipe due to the high reviews. I don't know if I did something wrong but they just are not that good. I definitely think my cookie recipe is better and will use that from now on. I used the modifications that others did, reduced flour, lower oven temp etc.. but found that they were lacking in flavour.

These taste good but not sue what I did wrong.  My cookies stuck to my non stick cookie sheets.  I did as other reviewers said, used butter instead of margarine, used 3 cups of flour and baked them at 350 for 8 to 10 minutes. They taste good, just had a heck of a time getting them off my cookie sheets

The recipe was good although it needed some help, i followed it word for word and the cookies came out a little on the unsweet side. i think maybe adding 1/2 cup of brown sugar to make the cookie a little softer and sweeter also not using as much flour as the recipe calls for.

This recipe calls for way too much flour, which made the dough REALLY crumbly.  I added more margarine to be able to roll it out.

Made these tonight, they are perfect!!!  I used butter instead of margerine and they are awsome!They really hold their shape and puff up nicey, soft but still able to frost without issue. Only issue is we did not get 48 cookies as the recipe says you should. Our cookie cutters are smaller than averge and we still only got about 30 cookies per batch so you may want to double the recipe!

Greatest. Sugar cookies. EVER!! :) I've made more failed sugar cookies than I care to count, but this recipe is the BEST! I did only use 3C of flour and it kept them from becoming flour rocks, like previous batches. Also, take them out before any edges are dark if you like them soft with little to no crunch. Decorate before baking! I didn't know that, so I have several plain cookies, but the rest have sprinkles and such on them! Great recipe! Thanks!!

This recipe is delicious!  I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract (just because I love vanilla) and a dash of cinnamon to it.  I also, used only 3 cups of flour and baked for 8 minutes at 350 degrees, as another reviewer suggested.  This was my first time ever making sugar cookies from scratch and they turned out great...nice and soft...with just a little bit of crispiness on the edges!

I love this recipe. I have used it for 5 years now and it is absolutely perfect! Soft, but not dough-y, and easy for cut-outs. I use butter instead of shortening and add extra vanilla. Delicious!

Perfect cookies. I didn't have enough all purpose flour on hand so I subbed self-rising and eliminated the salt and baking powder. I also didn't have stick margarine so I used unsalted butter instead and added back in abt a 1/4 tsp salt to compensate.  They were delicious and the texture was perfect. Take them out right when you see very slight slight browning on the top

After trying several sugar cookies from this site and after using several bags of flour, sugar, and several sticks of butter, I finally  found my cookie recipie. These are delicious and everyone in my household loves these! I did follow other reviewers and cut flour down to 3 cups, used butter instead of margarine and baked at 350 for around 8-10 min. For those of you who think its too sweet with frosting, try adding a little bit of food coloring ( your desired colors ) to the cookie dough. then mix it in with your hands and roll out. It gives the cookie color without all the extra sweetness. I mostly frost mine, but decided to try the food coloring...i made my pumpkins orage, my bats and tombstones black and my ghosts white. they turned out cute!!

These cookies are really tasty, especially when decorated with Sugar Cookie Frosting!  I have tried several other sugar cookie recipes, and this ones is the best by far, not only because of the taste, but because you can actually cut these out pretty easily.    Love this cookie!

These cookies are amazing!  I found them while looking for Lofthouse copycats and thought I'd give them a try.  Definitely not a Lofthouse, but quite amazing cookies.  They mix up easily, roll & cut out nicely, and make a nice firm -yet soft- cookie.  I didn't do dainty shapes, so I can't speak to how well they would work for Tin Soldier cookies, but they are certainly delicious.  The only thing I changed was subbing butter for the margarine... otherwise, it's just right.

Had a hard time cutting these out.  Put them in the fringe for over 2 hours and they were still very sticky.  Maybe should have used butter instead of margarine.  Wish I would have read the reviews and suggestions first.

Great flavor! 4 stars only because after 6 hours of chilling I *still* couldn't roll the dough out at all. I got sick of waiting and rolled them into balls and flattened slightly. Baked for 10 minutes. Beautiful little round sugar cookies. They have a really light, delicate flavor. Thanks :)

Love this recipe.  Not only were cookies soft, but delicious too!  I didn't change anything in the actual recipe (except butter instead of margarine) and didn't have to refrigerate the dough at all.  I rolled on parchment paper lightly dusted with confectioners sugar.  I like to use the Sugar Cookie Icing from this website as it dries hard like bakery treats.  I used this to make heart-shaped cookies for a Valentines function and everyone thought they were from a bakery.  They were all gone withing 30 minutes!!

This recipe is a keeper! I really wanted to find a recipe for soft sugar cookie cut-outs and this is it! I do not like crispy cookies at all so I am very pleased to have found this recipe.  I made heart-shaped cookies following the recipe exactly and they were still soft the next day.  Perfect!

The dough was so easy to work with- it rolled and cut easily, even after chilling for only half an hour (as long as I could get 6 anxious kids to wait!).  Like the first reviewer, I baked them at 350 for about 10 minutes.

I've had my sisters sugar cookies which is why this is getting such a terrible rating. Hers melt in your mouth she uses cream cheese and a whole 16oz bag of powdered sugar. I'm looking for the perfect sugar cookie recipe this one was ok but I've had better.

I have tried for years to make sugar cookies for my kids, with no success. The recipes I used always left the dough cracking and flaky. After a recent trip to the US and tasting Nordstrom's Pink Sugar cookie, my quest for the prefect recipe was renewed. I think I've found it with this one! The dough held together beautiful, making rolling a breeze. The cookies are perfectly golden on the edges but soft on the inside. Can't wait to add the frosting. This recipe is a keeper!

WOW!  These are better than the "best cut-out sugar cookies"  They have a great flavor & they actually keep their shape.  I haven't had sugar cookies that taste good & keep their shape. I followed the advice of others & used 3c flour & butter.

Excellent cookies!  I've baked this many times since I tried them for Chirstmas 09.  With colourful sugar icing, kids just love them!  I also use it as cookie base, devide dough in 3 parts.  Add lemon zest in one, sesame seeds in the second dough and lightly toasted desiccated coconut in the last and I made 3 different cookies in one go! Thanks so much for the recipe Georgie!

These were great!  Flavorful and soft.  I started by using butter and only 3c. of flour like some of the other reviews suggested.  I forgot to chill the dough and did end up adding more flour to get dough to a "rolling out" consistency.  Probably close to another cup.  Dough was still slightly sticky when I began rolling it but was fine with a little flour sprinkled on top before rolling.  I baked at 350 about 8 minutes.

I made this recipe exactly as described. This was the stickiest dough I've ever encountered. I swear it wasn't a cookie, it was glue. I literally had to take a spatula to scrape it off my heavily floured countertop. After adding an extra cup and a half of flour and re-chilling it, and using a ton of flour to roll it out, I managed to get cookies. Baked at 350 for 6 minutes, they taste all right. Not the best I've had, certainly not the worst. Not as floury as I worried with the amount of flour I had to use to make them roll out. They're still pleasantly sweet. I'm going to dip some in chocolate and frost the rest. Though they came out all right, they're certainly not worth the aggravation involved. I read the other reviews and I don't know how mine turned out so sticky that I had to add a ton more flour while others thought the dough was too dry and added less! What a weird recipe. I won't be making this again.

Very good cookies. I had difficulty figuring out when they were "done." If I made them thin, they got brittle, thicker and I ended up under cooking them. However, both tasted fine. I thought they needed icing, though, as they were not as sweet as I prefer a sugar cookie to be. I think if I used real butter instead of margarine, they would have been awesome, even without icing. I'll be using this recipe again - it was really easy!

This is a WONDERFUL recipe!  I did not change anything.  They were soft and delicious.  My children enjoyed decorating them and everyone enjoyed them all through the holidays.  They had people asking for the recipe! I will definitely make them again! (I do think it is key to make sure you do not roll the dough out too thin.)

We loved these cookies!  Used butter instead of margarine, baked on a Silpat rather than parchment.  The only other change I made involved technique: instead of chilling and then rolling out with flour, I just divided my dough into two halves, and rolled out between two pieces of wax paper into a fairly thick layer.  Not only is this WAY easier to roll (as the dough is slightly warm), but it also keeps the cookies very soft without all the added flour.  Then I just refrigerated, peeled back the wax on the cold dough, and they were super easy to cut.  We just sprinkled with colored sugar rather than iced, and they were great!

This is an excellent recipe to use for frosted cookies (they seemed too bland when plain). I followed the recipe exactly and then used a Buttercream Frosting recipe from this site.  The cookies were a hit...gobbled up very quickly!  Thanks for this great recipe!

They were a little hard to roll out, the dough could have been softer. Otherwise they tasted great and the cookies held their shape well.

This recipe was great! The only thing I changed was that I used 3c of flous instead of 3 3/4.  I did this because I felt that whenever I went to roll them adding the extra flour needed to roll out the cookies would make them taste bland.  They turned out great! I added some different food coloring and they were adorable.  Fam loved em!

I read other reviews and decided to use butter instead of margarine and baked at 400 for ten minutes.  I iced them and they ended up being a big hit at my Christmas party.  I will definetly make these agian!

Fantastic recipe!! I usually do only drop-cookies.. never made a rolled cookie before but gave it a shot & they turned out excellent! The dough was easy to work with (made a few hours in advance & chilled).. I rolled small portions at a time & cut them out with a star shaped cookie cutter ..actually, the only one I had:)  Once they baked & cooled, I used Royal Icing (also from this site), dipped the tops & then sprinkled red & green colored sugars. I will definitely make these again (after I buy more cookie cutter shapes!!) Thanks!

They were good. not hard to roll and tasted fine. Not as soft as I was expecting but i think it rolled it a little thin (1/4 inch). I will try these again soon and see if I can get them softer and than rerate.

I made these last year and came back to the recipe this year for something for the kids (age 3 and 4) to help me decorate.  I wasn't extremely impressed with the recipe last time, but this time I had a better time with it, utilizing some of the suggestions noted.  This time I cut the cookies thicker and baked them in the oven at 350 for around 8 minutes - really, just until they looked barely golden on the edges.  The batch I left in longer than that came out way too dark on the bottom.  I also used butter instead of margarine.  We brushed them with egg and used standard red and green sprinkles on them.  The flavor was very good - comparable to the cookies my mom used to make when I was a little girl.  That said, I'm still only giving this recipe 4 stars because the dough is extremely cumbersome to work with.  Even after chilling for the recommended amount of time, it was a crumbly mess I really needed to work with to be able to roll easily.  This made the whole process take quite a bit longer than I'd like and it frustrated the kids who just wanted to get to the brushing and sprinkling part!  If it wouldn't be for that one problem, these are a 5 star tasting cookie when using butter and baking at the lower temp.

Excellent cookies!  I made some last night and they were a hit with my family!  I followed the recommendations from others...3 cups of flour and bake at 350 for 8-10 minutes.

Finally a cookie dough I can work with. I've tried many other recipes and they all stick and I can never get it to work.  This recipe works and tastes excellent too. I used 3 cups of flour and butter instead of the margarine.

I baked these exactly as directed, except I used unsalted butter. The cookies are soft without tasting underdone. Excellent cookies. They rolled out nicely too.

I would give this four $ 1/2 *s, but my only problem was they were two hard (as in non-soft). Maybe it was me, I could've rolled them too thin, baked them to long, or just something else. Anyway now I might have to use a recipe from Betty Crocker for Christmas.

These cookies are very tasty and perfect if you're not a huge fan of really sweet things. However if you're looking for something sweet and sugary, I'd suggest modifying the recipe. I dusted the cookies with icing sugar right after they came out of the oven, and they were amazing! These cookies are great!

I had been looking for the "perfect" sugar cookie recipe for a few months.  I tried several that just didn't work out well for me, but then I tried this one and will never use another sugar cookie recipe again!  They are absolutely perfect.  They hold their shape really well without distorting when they raise.  I followed the advice of previous reviewers and cut back on the flour and the oven temperature and they came out soft and wonderful!

horrible dough.  I made this and followed it to the T.  the dough was so dry that 1/4 of the flour was still in the bottom of the mixing bowl and would not absorb in.  I dug out my moms sugar cookie recipe and saw this receipe uses half the "wet" ingredients that hers had in it.  So I added 1/2 cup of shortening and it turned into a very nice dough!  Cookies were fabulous!  I had to hide half of them in the freezer so we will have some on Christmas day.  However, without the extra moisture I added I have no idea how anyone could even get to the rolling it out stage.

Found these to be bland.  They seem to need more sugar or vanilla.  They were decent when iced but without it, not worth the time.  The dough was pretty sticky.  Moving on to another recipe....

This is by far the easiest and best recipe I have ever made.  Only change was to cut flour to 3 cups and I doubled the vanilla!    I mixed up the dough in mixer and then froze until time to make.  Let come to room temp and sprinkled counter with powdered sugar instead of flour.  Handled extremely easily!  Delicious!

Perfect! The cookies held their shape will staying soft and chewy. I baked mine for 9 minutes at 375. Be sure to roll the dough out about a 1/4 inch thick to get a yummy chewy cookie. I would suggest icing them with homemade almond extract frosting to sweeten them up.

This is the best sugar cookie recipe out there! Don't roll too thin or the cookie will be crunchy. I only used 3 cups of flour and then while rolling out the dough, I added a lot to the rolling surface. This is a perfect "all-year-round" recipe!!

Thank you Georgie ... I love these cookies so easy, I did follow others and used only 3 cups flour and swapped butter instead of margarine I chilled the dough 24 hours and didn't have trouble rolling them out, they held their shape nice, will use this one again for sure!! They are yummy and really couldn't be easier:-)

This recipe is wonderful!  Baked them today with my 4.5 year old.  You can re-roll these and there is no problem - first cookies as great as last cookies.  (and with a 4.5 year old -- there is a lot of re-rolling as most cookies are cut out of the middle!)  Tastes great too - even without frosting.  I used the colored frosting from grocery store and they turned out great (and easy for my son to use.)  I will definately use this recipe again, and again.  Saw another recipe that had 1-2 T. OJ -- might try that and add a little more flour.

These cookies are great.  I have also tried the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies, and these were much, much better.  The dough is easier to work with, and the taste is much better.  I used the entire amount of flour, but I often have to add extra flour to cookie dough because of the humidity where I live.  I also used butter.  (I never use margarine for health reasons.)  And like other reviewers, I baked at 350 for 6-7 minutes.  Perfect!

I enjoyed this recipe very much! I prefer a softer cookie to your typical hard sugar cookie. It was easy to make and fun to decorate.

Loved this recipe. I followed a lot of others' advice of using 3 cups flour, butter instead of margarine, and cooking at 350. I'm about to make them again and am going to try using some powdered sugar in place of some of the regular sugar. Also I will roll them out a lot thicker than I did the first time and hopefully they will be even softer.

This recipe was my first attempt at sugar cookies.  They turned out delicious!  My step-father, who does not like sugar cookies, grinned ear to ear after tasting them and asked when I would be making them again.

I've never had success with sugar cookies until now. I followed some of the tips here (I went with 3 1/3 C flour, 1 C granulated and 1 C powdered sugar, and real butter, baked at 350 for 8 minutes based on knowing how my oven cooks). I also always use a Silpat (silicone baking mat). These came out so well - easy to cut, a little puffy, golden brown on the bottom. Fantastic recipe! Thank you, Georgie, and reviewers with the good tips!

I just made these and was super dissappointed. Mine turned out crunchy, just like regular sugar cookies :( They had a great flavor, but the crunchiness wasn't what I wanted. I followed the flour and temperature recommendations as well.

These cookies were easy to roll out and when you follow the instructions they bake perfectly :) The only problem I had was they taste a little salty to me, so i think i will cut the salt in half next time. Other than that great recipe

OMG!  These are the best soft cookies ever!  I can see making little finger cookies with this dough and a soft icing to spread inside the layers.  Will definitely make these again!

So tasty! I was able to finally make sugar cookies with my kids thanks to this recipe and the recommendations of reviewers (I used 3 c. flour and butter and baked at 350, use extra 1/2 c flour for rolling). Do be careful not to overbake these and not to roll too thin, as previous reviews say. Even my 2 year old could cut these out! Thanks for the holiday memories!

I made these today, and wasn't impressed at all.  I like my sugar cookies to be light and fluffy and puff up really nicely when you bake them.  These cookies don't puff up and they're overly sweet.  I deducted one star because they didn't hold their shape well and another star based on personal preference.  I'll stick with fluffy sour cream sugar cookies from now on.  On the bright side - I finally found a cookie that I won't eat.

This recipe was nothing but a big waste of ingredients. My Mom and I did some Christmas baking today. We followed this recipe exactly. When we took it out of the fridge to roll the cookies out it was a big hard rock. My kids were excited to decorate them so I managed after quite some time to roll out 2 cookies (It was hard and crumbly). I cooked them just so they could decorate them but the tasted aweful. I would never make this recipe again.

Excellent sugar cookie!  I made Valentine cookies for work and everyone raved about them!  Perfect soft chewy cookie. A couple small changes...I too used butter instead of margarine as others suggested, and cooked them at 350 for 10-12 minutes.

This makes a wonderful cookie. I just finished a triple batch of valentine cookies.  Coming from a dairy background, I only use butter, and did lower the temp to 350 since I was using a convection oven, baked them 9 min. I was sure to cream the butter until it was truly light and fluffy (having a heavy duty stand mixer is a benefit) and rolled them out on a silicon mat, eliminating the need for much flour.  They hold their shape and stay soft, a plus when making them for children.  I frosted some with Sugar Cookie Frosting and drizzled some with chocolate.  They taste great and make a wonderful presentation.

I've always been intimidated by making my own cut out cookies but these were wonderful! I agree with other reviewers to just use 3 cups flour and back at 350. Also, instead of 2 teaspoons vanilla i added 1 tp. vanilla, 1 tp. butter extract and 1 tp. almond extract. I also used a glaze recipe to top my finished product.

I made this recipe and "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" at the same time.  These were pretty good, but the other recipe was MUCH, MUCH better, both in terms of taste and dough workability.  For those of you who think this is the best sugar cookie ever, try the other recipe in comparison.

Fabulous cookies ! Very soft, light and fluffy ! I used confectioners sugar to roll the dough out with instead of flour. I made many batches and used the sugar cookie icing recipe on this site as another user suggested and handed them out in decorative baking baggies as gifts. They LOVED them !

The dough rises quite a bit so watch your thickness.  The dough looks to sticky but after you chill it it rolls out great!  These cookies were a hit at work they were gobbled up in minutes.

Fantastic!  I try and bake gluten and dairy free as much as possible, and this recipe works fantastically with Whole Foods brand gluten free baking mix!  In fact, they almost taste too good, I felt like I was cheating and eating wheat!  Great recipe!!!  We didn't use cookie cutters, just made little cookie circles and pressed some sugar sprinkles in .  YUM!  :)

These had good flavor but I think I rolled them too thin because they weren't as fluffy as I would have liked. I used 3 1/2 c of flour and baked them about 10 minutes at 350. I'd roll them closer to 1/2" next time so they actually came out softer and lighter.

These were really soft and so nice. They did spread some and I think the recipe calls for too much salt...they had a salty taste in some areas and I had tried to mix it really well.
I used 3 cups flour and Butter instead of margarine.
Turned out really well for Christmas and everyone loved them.

This was a great recipe.  I only like the cookies to be the type that are soft and thick.  They are easy for the kids to handle without breaking or cracking.  I doubled the recipe both times I made them this year. The first was as gifts.  This recipe freezes well once baked, cooled and decorated for ease in transporting them as well as keeping them as fresh as possible.  I will make these again next year as well and probably throughout the year for Valentines cookies, as well as Halloween cookies for my five kids school parties.  This type of cookie is always a hit for kids to decorate at their parties.

I cut down the flour as suggested by other reviewers.  The dough wasn't hard to work with at all but it did spread when baked and some shapes didn't hold.  The taste was ok but I've had better.

I made these cookies according to the recipe, except that I substituted butter in place of the margarine, and I baked them at 350 degrees.  Very good cookie.  To keep them soft, take them out of the oven immediately when you see the first tinge of brown around the edges, and roll them a little on the thick side - 1/4" is good.

Delicious recipe. I made the same alterations that other reviewers suggested: butter, bake at 350, and only 3 cups of flour. Perfect cuts the very first time I tried this recipe. I will definitely use this one again!

These are so-so. I found that if you roll the dough too thin and cook for 6 minutes and 15 seconds the cookies brown quickly and are crisp not soft.  My second batch I made them thicker and cooked for 6 minutes 20 seconds and they came out soft, however they just tasted "doughey" to me although they were done in the middle. My third batch I made the cookies a little bigger and cooked them for 6 minutes 25 seconds and they came out soft but still doughey tasting to me.  
For the frosting I used Duncan Hines fluffy White cake frosting and then I used food coloring (I was making Christmas cookies) so I used gree & red food coloring and colored sugar sprinkles to decorate the cookies with.  
Will I try this cookie recipe again? Probably not, I didn't find it to be anything special.  I brought the cookies to work and my co-workers loved them, but then again, they always love free cookies!

I just finished making these for my son's
first grade class. They are delicious.
I used only 3 cups of flour and added
1/3 cup of confectionary sugar, because I prefer a sugar cookie taste rather than a shortbread one. These would taste
great with or without frosting. Thanks for the great recipe.

I also took the advice from others and used only 3c. of flour and baked them at 350 degrees for 8 minutes.  These are the BEST cookies I have ever made!  My whole family loves them so much I made a batch and we didn't even frost them and they were gone so fast.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

This was an excellent sugar cookie recipe.  It turned out great.  The dough was very easy to work with and the cookies had a good flavor.  I, like suggested before, used butter instead of margarine and I only used 2 1/2 cups of flour.

I thought these would be better than they actually were. I used butter instead of the margarine and they still were a bit disappointing. The dough was easy to work with. The taste was boring (even with royal frosting).

I have made this recipe for several years now, but recently reviewed the comments and made a couple of changes.  First, I cut back the flour to about 3 cups, and I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes.  They came out much better!  I made them for Thanksgiving with the Sugar Cookie Icing, and I had to promise the in-laws that they would get more for Christmas!

Perfect and easy. I took other's tips and only used 3 c flour (used rest to roll) and for sure only cook at 350, 8 minutes for us. Plus you must use butter, it is a given in all baking

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe.  The dough was hard to handle - too sticky. 
The taste was pretty good - but too chewy for me.  
Whatever you do - DO NOT ROLL OUT WITH POWDERED SUGAR - they stick more to the baking pan but what's more is that the texture on top looks all wrinkly.  I tried rolling them out with flour the seocond time and it's a lot better without the wrinklyness.

the dough tasted good but it didn't stiffen enough for me to roll it out, and i even popped it into the freezer after the first hour of chilling, because i wanted to make them for my husband. even after over half an hour in the freezer it was too sticky and soft to cut into shapes, i've pressed it into a cake pan and am going to attempt a bar cookie out of it. we'll see how it goes

I followed the instructions exactly, chilled the dough double the time and I still had a very difficult time handling the dough. I didn't realize it'd be so sticky so I had to heavily flour my board before rolling and cutting shapes out of the dough. The result was just a floury mess. I obviously made a mistake but I don't know what I did wrong exactly...

This is a simple cut-out cookie recipe if that's what your looking for. I actually made them for St. Patrick's Day instead of Christmas and made little clovers. They turned out great. After letting it sit in the fridge, be prepared  to flour up the counter a whole bunch b/c the dough comes out really sticky. With a little flour it's fine though.

Turned out excellent!  I doubled it and got over 100 cookies, I frosted with sugar cookie frosting from the site!  I didn't really get the point of chilling the dough...

These were really good. My niece, sister, boyfriend, and mom loved them!
They do not need much frosting.

Because we are moving, I couldn't find my recipe book.  I tried this recipe and had to throw the dough away after baking one pan of the cookies.  They taste awful.  There is just way too much flour in this recipe.  You feel like you've just eaten a handful of flour.  I also prefer cookies make with baking soda instead of baking powder.

I have tried 3 recipes on this website for sugar cookies cutouts and this is by far the best!  The consistancy of the dough was perfect and easy to work with.  The bake time was right on the money. Thank thank thank you.  This a keeper in my files!!!!

Sugar cookies are like pizza - even when they're bad, they're still good! Not that these were too bad, but I found the dough extremely difficult to work with. It ended up staying in the fridge overnight because we were called away unexpectedly, but I couldn't even begin to manipulate the dough for almost 45 minutes after taking it from the fridge. Next time I think I just won't refrigerate it. I let the kiddo do the cutting and some of the rolling, so some cookies were big, some were small, some thick and some thin, which meant that some cookies were soft and others weren't. I thought this was a decent recipe; I had about as much success with this one as I have others in the past.

Not the sweetest, and only soft if you roll them thick. Not bad, but I'll be trying something else next time

I made a batch of these last night. They sure are delicious, but they are NOT soft unless you're talking about immediately after removing from the oven. The dough was heavenly to work with, so smooth and perfect for rolling. Yum! I just wish they stayed soft. That is the only reason I tried this recipe.

This were the best sugar cookie that I've made, and there still SOFT!! Did everything as said but I only left the dough in fridge for 1 1/2 hr, and still came out good. If you have a food processor this is awesome to use to mix everything up in! I also used the sugar cookie frosting on these cookies. A little messy but the kids had a good time.

These cookies are great both as cutouts and as drop cookies. The last time I made them I added dried cherries then rolled the dough into walnut sized balls and rolled in raw sugar. I flattened a bit on the cookie sheet. Really, really good.

Very good cookies, I've tried many others. I took other reviews into consideration while making these cookies. I also used butter instead of margarin,the butter batch didnt turn out so good. I also lowered the oven temp to 350deg. And also had to use a bit more flour. Everyone whom ate these cookies really loved them. :)

These were really good, and I don't much like sugar cookies.  We followed other reviewers' suggestions, and used 3 cups flour, butter instead of margarine, and 1 tablespoon vanilla just because we like vanilla.  Also, we didn't bother to chill it, just used a bit of flour to keep from sticking to the rolling pin.  Be sure to cover them as soon as they are cool to prevent them getting hard.

These cookies are great.  Very easy to make.  The only thing I had to change was the temperture.  Instead of me baking them at 400 degrees, I had to change my oven to 325.  My oven was way too hot at 400.  Other than that minor issue they tasted wonderful.

After reading the wide range of opinions on this recipe, I decided to go for it and boy am I glad I did.  I didn't make any adjustments at all and these cookies are perfect for frosting, which is what is supposed to be done with them.  Delicious!

YUMMMMMY!!!!  This recipe is one of the best sugar cookies recipes!  Taste great with or without frosting - great sugar taste.  I agree with other reviews - five minutes is a good bake time maybe six minutes depending on the thickness.  I also found that this is better mixed by hand!

I have used your recipe for over 3 years now and this is THE BEST one out there. I just drop and cook them and they turn out perfect every time and I'm convinced it's because they don't have powdered sugar in them. They are so good that my mother threw her prized sugar cookie recipe out and now uses this one. This is one I will hand down to my daughters.

Okay at first, easy to over bake.  Don't stay soft for long, even in airtight container.  Within a day or two they are hard as a rock.

These are the softest, best flavored sugar cookies we have found. This will be my only recipe from now on! As long as you watch the thickness (keep to 1/4") and take them out of the oven while they are still light, they are perfect! They taste like the cookies from Cookie Bouquet.

Great recipe.  Easy to follow.  I chilled the dough in the freezer to speed up chilling time.  I am an awful cook/baker, but these turned out great!!  I iced them after they cooled.

This was an easy recipe, but I did make a few modifications.  I cut the flour back to 3 cups, the temp back to 350, and you really need to make sure you do not roll these too thin.  I only cooked them 7-8 minutes.  Overall a good cookie.

I used butter instead of margarine, and I left it in the fridge for a couple days, so it got too hard.  In an attempt to save the hard dough, I defrosted it in the microwave a little bit, then found it wasn't sticking anymore.  So I added an extra egg, and some flour and sugar until it felt like it was supposed to.  Then I fridged it for a couple hours and came back to it.

Amazingly, they turned out pretty good.  They didn't come out soft, but I think I just rolled the cookies too thin for that.  You need to make sure you pick a thickness and stick with it, or some will burn or brown faster than others.  Most of mine turned out ok.

I frosted with Decorator Frosting by P. Oakes.

this was so easy to make and roll out. I cut the flour to 3 cups and used the remainder for rolling out. the baking time seemed a little off, so I just watched until they were JUST brown around the edges. perfect for me and my daughter to make Valentine hearts. Taste great too!

I made these for an upcoming Christmas party! They turned out beautifully and are soft, but the taste is kind of plain.Next time I might add less flour like other users have done.I used as little as possible to roll out the dough.But I will definitely make this again!

Mmmm, these turned out so soft. I actually only wanted to make 2 dozen cookies, so I halved the batch and they turned out nice.  I only used 1 1/2 cups flour (3 cups halved) and I did bake them at 350 instead of 400.  They turned out very soft and yummy!  I had to hide them from my husband because he kept eating them before I had a chance to deorate them!!

I will definitely make this recipe for years to come!

These are delicious! I did follow the suggestion to use only 3 cups flour.  These rolled out extremely well when cold.  If it warmed though--which happened rather quickly--they did not "pick up" well after cutting.  Keep it chilled!  Perhaps just a little more flour would help with that?  I rolled mine a bit thinner, anywhere between 1/4" and 3/8".  It took only 6 minutes to bake.  A winner.

Rolled out nicely, but cookies not soft. To be honest though, cut out cookies are not my forte, but I did follow all the directions and I still was not impressed. I ended up throwing them all away.

This is a very good sugar cookie recipe...the dough is easy to work with and they turn out nice and fluffy.  I just had to bake them longer than the recommended time.  
I flattened them with a floured glass and made them into just a round shape.  Then iced them with red frosting and red sprinkles on top for valentines day. :)

These cookies were terrific!  I have been searching for a good cutout recipe, and this one was perfect.  My family doesn't like overly sweet cookies, and I hate greasy ones.  These cookies were neither.  All that and easy to handle, too!  I will be making these for many more occasions than just Christmas!

I have been making Betty Crockers sugar cookie recipe for years. It was always difficult to work with but tasted good. I decided to try a different recipe this year and picked this one. It is sooooo nice to work with and tastes great. I put in the fridge for several hours and had no problem rolling it out. Thanks so much!!

Don't know about being called "SOFT" Christmas cookies.  Mine were very brittle and crunchy.  But they were still good easy cookies to make and they make so many which pleased my family, we keep them in the freezer so we will have them for a while.

Oh Darn...so disappointing. Too much flour, dough would not stay together and it might have been worth the trouble, but it was such an average tasting cookie and even at 1/4 inch thick they weren't as soft as we like them. (Talk about your run-on sentence).=) I sent some home with my sis and said "don't tell anyone that I'm the one who made them!"

These cookies came out great! This was my first time making rolled sugar cookies. I did make a few alterations: I used 3 cups of cake flour, substitute butter for shortening, used Mexican vanilla, and added 1/2 tablespoon of butter extract.

First time making sugar cookies was a success! Only used 3 cups flour, all butter melted, and replaced 1/2 ts of vanilla extract with almond extract. Glad I went with this recipe vs others on this site!

I think this may be the first review I’ve ever written, but WOW this cookie recipe is the best. I received compliments from almost every single person who tasted them saying it was the best they have ever had! I gave out the recipe to at least 10 people! I did follow the recommendation of decreasing flour to 3 cups and added almond extract to the batter.

This recipe was perfect!  I did hold back 1/4 Cup of the flour until it was mixed, and didn’t end up adding it because the consistency was right.  (It depends on how big your eggs are and how much “liquid” they add.)  I did roll it into logs and then chilled it, and used it as “slice & bake” cookies and let the kids put decorations on them before baking. Even though the dough got a bit warm by the time the kids were done they didn’t spread too much at all.  They are not TOO sweet, and are firm when baked but turn into a chewy goodness in your mouth!  Will be my go-to sugar cookie recipe from now on!

WAY TOO MUCH FLOUR!!!! I could not even get this batter to come together. Should have listened to other reviewers who suggested cutting back on the flour because I had to throw the whole thing out and start over.  Going to try again with only 3 cups of flour instead

Delicious and easy to work with. I doubled the recipe (minus 1/2 c flour), creamed butter and sugar a long time, rolled in powdered sugar, baked at 375 for 6-8 minutes. Thank you!

These were very  good! I just want to recomend the following: change the oven temperature to 375 F and bake for one extra minute. If you are doing smaller cookies, back at 5 minutes. Also, in order to get the soft taste described in the recipe's description, the cookie dough must not be too thin when the cookies are being cut out. BTW, thanks for the great recipe!!!

This has been my go to recipe and always works great. I followed the other reviews and reduced to 3 cups of flour and used powder sugar for rolling. I also cooked at 350 degrees for about 8 minutes...just until the edges started to brown. I rolled to about 1/4” thick and they are always perfect!

Every year I search for a good recipe for Cmas sugar cookies. I made a recipe that I ended up tossing out because it has way too much flour vs liquid. I knew right away this recipe (using 3 cups flour) was going to be different when I finished mixing all ingredients. Instead of being dry and heavy, the dough was soft with a touch of stickiness. Just be sure to move it along when cutting them out and placing on sheet or else they lose their shape which happened to mine due to family distractions while I was trying to finish. But they still look ok and taste great! Thanks to the author for this keeper recipe.

The kids and I thought this was the best Christmas cookies I had ever made. I did however substitute butter for the margarine. I made four batches and they were all eaten with smiles on their faces.

i did the recipe exactly how it is written. i tried follwing another reviewer by only adding 3 cups of flour but it was very runny for me so i added in the rest of the 3/4 and it was still very runny. i followed everything exact and everyone else is saying their batter is too dry so not sure where i went wrong. maybe i should get a different brand of flour? its in the fridge chilling now so maybe thatll harden it up but its like pancake batter consistency at this point.

Great recipe! Only things I changed was to use real butter. And I baked them at 375F for 8-10 minutes depending on the size cookie I was baking. I also rolled the cookies pretty thick and took them out of the oven before they browned so they were nice and soft. These cookies are not overly sweet so prefect for icing. Also these will be prefect to roll into sugar and/nuts and do thumbprint cookies with.

Do 350 instead for about 8 minutes.
Substitute 1 cup powdered sugar and 1 cup regular sugar for the 1 1/2 cup regular sugar.

I took the advice of other reviewers and used 3 cups of flour, used real butter instead of margarine and cooked them at 350 degrees for 8-10 min. I made sure not to roll it too thin. The cookie cutter patterns came out perfectly. 

They came out PERFECT!!
They were moist, soft, and tasted delicious!! 

This will be my go to recipe for holiday cookies!

As written, and much agreed with other reviews, there is far too much flour in this recipe.  Reduced to 3 C and cook temp to 350.  I set the timer for 8 minutes and watched from that point-- depending on the cookie sheet, it took either 8 or 9 minutes.  Parchment paper was definitely helpful.

I used one of the top commenter/reviewer’s modifications: butter instead of margarine and 3 cups of flour instead of 3.75. I baked for 8 minutes at 375 instead of her 350 or the recipe’s 400. They came out absolutely perfect.

Pretty good recipe!
Everything went well, except for one small thing. After I took the dough out of the fridge, it was rock hard so I had to break it into small pieces and knead the pieces until they were able to be rolled out.
Besides that, though, it was a really delicious and simple recipe!

Took a good bit longer to cook. It may have had too much butter and that might by why they ‘melted’ when baked. They may look funny, but they taste good.

I am the type of grandma that has cookie parties .  It started years ago with family.  Found this recipe and tried it.  I slightly undercooked it and let the carry over cooking time finish it.  It was so yummy.  It was also able to stand up to children decorating it.  Very nice.

My 2 years old loves it. And he asks for it repeatedly since we start making it half year ago. I substitute white sugar to brown sugar. Other than that, I stick with original recipe and it comes out great every time!

Personally, these sugar cookies aren’t amazing if that’s what you’re looking for. However, the dough was easy to work with and easy to use cookie cutters with. The reason why I didn’t like this recipe is because it tastes more like butterscotch cookies rather than sugar cookies. If you like the taste and smell of butter than you’ll enjoy this, if you don’t you won’t. I did make modifications to this recipe like others have commented and it still was not great.

My family LOVED these cookies!  I did not frost them like the picture shows.  I used colored sugar, pressed on before baking  the cookies and they were perfect.  I will certainly use this recipe again.

These cookies are super easy and yummy! I do recommend making sure that you don’t roll the dough too thin or bake them too long if you want them to stay soft.

These sugar cookies are great! The only tip I have is that when you're rolling them out, use powdered sugar instead of flour on your rolling pin and surface. It keeps them from getting dry and give the plain cookies a little extra sweetness that makes them delicious even without the icing.

I only gave 4 stars because I changed the resume based on the reviews.  I baked at 350 degrees and used 3 cups of flour plus more to roll out the cookies.  I swapped margarine for butter.  Having said that, the cookies came out amazing.  I was extremely pleased

I used 3 cups of flour, and 1.25 cups of sugar instead of the recommended amount. I also melted the butter on the stove instead of using solid butter. this was my first time having sugar cookies and it was good.

I made the recipe as is and it was delicious. The cookies held shape, tasted great, and were perfect for decorating. I baked them until they were just browning on the edges at the bottom. Definitely making these again next year.

I used ingredients as listed but baked cookies at 350 as suggested in some of the reviews.  The dough was dry and crumbly but was okay to roll out after letting it warm up a little before rolling. Taste was ok but not as good as I had hoped.  I won't use this recipe again.

Hubby loves these.  They puff up nicely.  We cut little ones and baked about 4-1/2 minutes.  Big cut outs took 6 minutes.

Made as is and am very happy with this recipe. Was easy to roll out once the dough softened after chilling. Everyone loved the cookies. Making more!

This was my first time making homemade sugar cookies and it was so much easier than I though it would be! I made it exactly by the original directions and they came very nice and tasty! They are going to make wonderful Christmas gifts once I get them iced. I only had ruffle edge round cookie cutters, so that’s what I used. I will post a pic when I get them iced!

Really good recipe- made as is except used 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine. I decided to make them into Imperial cookies by rolling the dough thin and cutting out small circles, then once baked, put jam between 2 cookies and iced the top. I took them to work - everyone loved them! Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect texture and held their shape nicely! Not overly sweet but if adding icing it’s more than sweet enough. Thicker cookies are softer and these do just as well rolled into balls and flattened to make small tea type cookies. It’s our go to sugar cookie from now on!

Followed the suggestions to reduce flour and oven temp, and substituted coconut oil for margarine. Perfect amount of sweetness, rolled and cut perfectly for Christmas cookies. Will definitely make again!

A solid recipe from my first try at it. Overall, I found that if you are cooking large cookie shapes, then 400 degrees as directed is perfect. If you are doing thinner cookies or smaller shapes, you may desire to lower the temperature. I found out, when almost finished, that I was making the cookies at half the directed thickness.
COMMON PROBLEMS: - Dough is flaky and dry/hard to work with: I too found the dough flaky upon first cutting and trying to roll it out right after being chilled. I also found out that if you work with it a little and warm it up, it solidifies and forms perfect roll-able  dough. Work with the dough a little. Once warmed up a bit, you probably wont even need flour to reroll your scraps. I'd leave the dough out for about 10 minutes before working with it, and leave it out as you are rolling out your other cookies and baking them. If it gets too sticky, toss back into fridge for chilling. - Too hard of cookies: You are probably rolling it too thin or using too small of cutter shapes. Either use larger shapes, or reduce your temps. I also suggest cooking for 5-8 minutes, and then letting it rest on the pan for 1 min to firm the cookie. This depends upon the exact thickness and shape of your cookie. Always place your timer shorter than the required time, so you may check your baking progress. OVERALL: Straight up, unchanged and as written, this recipe is not bad. The cooking temp is the only portion in question, but that's dependent upon size, shape and th

Nice soft crumb.  I changed to half white sugar and half light brown sugar.  I also added a sprinkle of ginger & cinnamon powders.  Very tasty. :)  Even with my older than dirt oven, they came out great.

I'm a respectable baker but cut out cookies have been my white whale. I have never been successful with any recipe until this one. Not only did the cookies come out beautiful, they are delicious. This is a perfect recipe, my only change was using butter since I don't use margarine. Thanks for a great experience!

These were great! I made them the first time following the recipe exactly and, like other reviewers, found them to be too floury and overcooked for my taste. I then made them a second time following other reviewers suggestions of reducing the flour to 3C and baking at 350 until no longer appearing wet. 
This is now my go-to sugar cookie recipe. They taste great plain or iced.

These turned out like . There is way to much flour. They were so dry the dough would just crumble apart and they didn't have any flavor. These are not at all what the video showed. I would not use this recipe.

I have been making this recipe for a couple years now and absolutely loved it. The temperature was a little high I think though, so I dropped it to 350 and baked for about 9-10 minutes. They came out super soft with a light golden crust around the edges on the bottom. Aside from that my only tweaking was putting crushed candy canes on the candy cane cookies once they were frosted. They are delicious!

This is a wonderful recipe that gives me consistent results. I use this holiday cookie recipe every year in the bake shop I work in. I make thousands of cookies from this recipe. I made only one change in the recipe. I use butter instead of margarine. The cookie is sturdy,  and holds it's cut-out shape, and has a delicious flavor. The cookie stays soft over time, and my customers love it! **Please see my Photo Gallery to view this cookie**

These cookies came out harder than expected. Not soft. The recipe was flavorless. Very disappointed. Going back to my good old stand by

These cookies are great.  I did follow the recommendations from another person.  I did sub butter for margarine and only used 3 1/3 cups of flour along with 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of powdered sugar for the 1 1/2 cups of granulated sugar.  Tasted wonderful and the texture was great.  Sprinkled with colored sugars.  Great recipe.

Following other reviews, I used butter instead of margarine and used 3 cups of flour instead of the 3 3/4. 
I also added cinnamon and ginger powder for added taste. 
They turned out super cute and yummy! 

Thank you for the recipe!

Great sugar cookie recipe! I used some suggestions from other reviewers. I cut back on the flour, did 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar. When I rolled out the dough, I used powdered sugar.

Finally, I found the perfect sugar cookie.  One that's easy to make, easy to roll, and tastes delicious.  The only downside, is they're going so fast I might not get to decorate them!

This is a "must-have" recipe in every baker's christmas cookie repertoire.

I changed it up a bit and they are awesome. I am a walnut lover, so I put 2 3/4 cups of flour and 2 cups of ground walnuts. I also added 1tsp of cinnamon when adding vanilla. Lastly, I put half a cup of organic cane sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of white. Cookies were not as soft as with original recipe (now more like softer biscotti), but the flavour is 10+++. Also, when dipped in coffee or milk they are extra soft and melting in your mouth.

First time making this sugar cookie recipe. Easy to follow. Ingredients are items you have in your pantry/fridge every day... no special trips to the grocery store.  Love the fact that the cookies were not sickeningly sweet.

I made these with my daughter. They turned out great.  I followed the recipe without cutting out any of the flour as some reviews suggested. The cookies were soft and had a light buttery flavor.  The only thing I did change was I reduced my oven temperature to 350 as my oven tends to cook too fast. This is the first time I’ve had sugar cookies turn out this good. We will definitely make again.

Turned out great! I was worried because I read many other suggestions to cut to flour to 3 cups after I had made it as written and had them in the oven. They still tasted great! I think I will cut the flour to 3 cups next time though. I used butter instead or margarine because I never use margarine. I baked them at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. Grease your pan super well! I had a lot of casualites in my first batch trying to get them off the pan. Next time I will definitely use parchment paper. I’m going to keep this modified recipe in my favorites!

Has anyone doubled or tripled this recipe ? I am using the "altered" recipe with 3 cups of flour - I have learned that for whatever goofy reason doubling or tripling a baking recipe just doesn't always work - which is just annoying when in stead of making one big batch, you have to make 2 or 3 separate batches to combine into one great big batch.  Appreciate any feedback

Could have used more sugar in the recipe.  Also I read someone’s comments and used only 3 cups of sugar and they recommended adjusting something else in the recipe which I did.  I didn’t put icing on them to begin with, but I guess after putting icing on, they were better.  Still the dough could have used more sugar.

Used this recipe to make and then decorate Christmas cookies. For us, it's the perfect sugar cookie recipe and it doesn't get any better than this.

Used butter instead of margarine. Followed directions to a tee (exception the butter) dough looked like floury sand. Had to add another egg and 1/2 cup more butter to get dough to consistency. Cookies turned out well. Just glad I had extra butter on hand.

Can't add much that hasn't been said already. Good flavor, easy to work with, great texture.  I used butter, substituted 1 tsp. of vanilla/butter nut  extract for plain vanilla just because I had it on hand and baked at 350 degrees.  Tasty iced or plain.

I tried this twice and both times the dough was to soft to cut out. I just rolled the dough into balls and baked them that way. The flavor was ok but definitely not 5 or even 4 star worthy.

I liked this recipe a lot!  The only reason for 4 stars is that, as written, it doesn't have much flavor.  I'll be making this recipe again today, but will add some cake flavoring to the recipe in hope of adding a little sweetness.  Otherwise, fantastic recipe for soft cut-out Christmas cookies!

These tasted terrible. I can't believe these are so highly rated for being so tasteless and dry. I used all very high quality ingredients, and followed the recipe exactly. Furthermore, the dough was hard to roll out after chilling.

Best cookies EVER! They tasted great AND held their shape for decorating.  I did use butter instead of margarine,  as I always bake with butter.  I did also reduce the flour slightly to accommodate rolling the cookies to cut.  You probably wouldn't need to if you weren't rolling.  I will save this recipe to use again and again.

These cookies look so yummy! I plan to make the tomorrow but I have a question about one of the ingredients...when the recipe calls for margarine IS IT SALTED OR UNSALTED? can someone please help me? This is the first time i will be making sugar cookies!

PS. I haven't made them yet but in doing my research and reading reviews and looking at pictures 
I'm sure I will love them. So I am "by faith" giving this a 4 star rating 8

The flavor is fine. but 3 3/4 cups of flour is too much. It came out really dry and crumbly - almost like a shortbread dough. There was no way I was going to be able to roll it out like that. I had to add another 1/4 cup of butter and another egg to make the dough workable.

We made these with a few alterations. I used coconut sugar and raw sugar instead of white. I also used the 3 and 1/4 cups of flour, and baked them at 350* for about 8 mins. I super loved the idea of rolling them out on powdered sugar as opposed to flour, and then we made traditional royal icing to decorate them. They’re thick and soft, everything we’ve been looking for in a sugar cookie. Will definitely share! Thanks!

I like these because they have extra vanilla in them for a good taste and are not hard as rocks. Can always add more vanilla or almond extract for more flavor.

Our go to sugar cookie recipe for Christmas! We only use 3 cups of flour (and it’s still a little too much after all the rolling in flour) and real butter. But in the end, great recipe!

I set mine in the frig overnight, and started cutting out, had to use a lot of flour to get the dough to stop from sticking, but they taste great, not too sweet.  Prefect for adding frosting to.

These were awesome! My step daughter is gluten intolerant so the only adjustment I made in the entire recipe was using gluten free flour. They were still very soft and tasty and we were even able to use Christmas cutouts without the cookie losing its shape while cooking-which is very hard to do with gluten free sugar cookies. It allowed us to really be able to enjoy decorating our cookies this year! I will definitely stick with this recipe! Thank you for sharing!!!!

Really tasty. I agree with earlier reviews to set oven to 350. I did use the recommended amount of flour and I thought the consistency was fine. I used parchment paper instead of greased cookie sheets and that worked well. I definitely recommend working in small batches (to roll out and cut) while the rest stays in the fridge so that it doesn't get too warm and starts to stick or tear.

I added 1 tsp. of Almond Extract and some lemon zest.  I also rolled  out the dough with confectionery sugar and baked them @ 375* for 11 minutes.  I baked them on parchment paper, they slid right off.  Great recipe!

I would not recommend this to anyone. I'm very glad I tried this recipe, but it just isn't worth the ingredients it's made of.  The reason I give this a 2 star review is because  I used the excess dough to create a cheesecake crust. It was pretty good. Not great, but not bad.

If I hadn't made the cream cheese sugar cookies prior to making these, I would have probably thought these were great, but in comparison, they are just alright.  The cream cheese sugar cookies rolled out easier and stayed thick, soft and fluffy.  These cookies taste okay and were easy to make.  I made modifications from another reviewer who said to use melted butter and to use only 3 cups flour and to set the oven at 350 and bake cookies for 8-10 minutes. These are probably better tasting for kids than the cream cheese sugar cookies.

It was so good. Very tasty, creative and festive. It absolutely put a sweet taste in my mouth and a smile on my face. I just kept eating more and more! Definitely an amazing recipe. From here on out I will use this every Christmas. Me and my family were in love. Please make this delicious batch of cookies! I did use butter instead of margarine. I feel it made it so much more delicious. Please make this !!!!

I am in a higher altitude so perhaps that is the reason my cookies did not turn out very soft at all.

I made it and it was so great it was just it was way to dry but once we started rolling out the dough it was impossible! But when we finished the cookies it was worth it. The cookies were so delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly.  Perhaps we rolled them a bit too thick, but I found them a bit doughy in texture.  Next time, I will try the tips recommended by others, to cook them at 350F for slightly longer.

So soft and melts in your mouth. Used salted butter and rounded 1/2 tsp salt for more balance of sweetness. Cut back on flour: 3c instead of 3 3/4. Baked until barely golden. Brown = crunchy = brittle. Baked at oven temp at 350 and baking cookies for 8-10 minutes keeps it soft. Lined with parchment paper. Loved. Now need to figure out how to transfer it without  them breaking. Very delicate.

Delicious! I am not a fan of sugar cookies but my son wanted to make and decorate cookies for Christmas. These worked perfectly. I used one cup of butter instead of margarine, chilled in freezer for about 20 minutes instead of in fridge for two hours because I was in a time crunch and baked 8-10 minutes at 350 instead of 400. I've never had luck baking cookies at 400 degrees so I played with the time and they came out nice and golden on the bottoms and a paler white on top.  They rolled out easily and were a cinch to make. I'm saving this recipe for next year.

Cut the flour, melted the butter and lowered the cooking temp as indicated in one of the review. Cookie stayed soft and had a good taste. Easy to roll out.

I loved this recipe! Great Texture, nice and fluffy on the inside. I was nervous at 1st because the dough was not a dough like constancy but when you put it in the fridge, it was perfect! Easy to cut out the shapes, and by the time we got them to my families party they were already gone! Thanks a lot for sharing this great recipe!

Good sugar cookie - I refrigerated overnight before rolling out, cutting, and baking. The cookies were chewy (in a good way) and tasty.

These are good soft cookies but there seems to be something missing in the taste. They were a bit plain. After icing they were better.

These were a great sugar cookie and I will defiantly make them again. They tasted great and the recipe was simple and easy to follow. I substituted the margarine for butter.

I loved the recipe.  I followed one of the earlier reviewers to make soft cookies by cutting the flour to 3 cups, warming the butter, and cooking it at a lower temperature. They were great with some holiday sprinkles, but had I left them out they would have needed a tad more sugar.  Maybe adding a 1/4 cup would be the ticket.  They came out nice and soft the day they were baked and the day after!

I followed as other reviews stated and used butter instead of margarine. I did 3 cups of flour as well but added a little extra vanilla extract because my bottle was almost empty. I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes and they were perfect. Next test will be a side by side taste test with my mom's that she's made from an older Betty crocker cookbook and I've always thought they were the best.

These were relatively easy to make and soooo yummy!  I used butter instead of the fake stuff and added 1/2 tsp. of almond extract.  My 4 year old helped me cut out and decorate them.  The cookies were a hit at his holiday show.  We even wowed my mother, who is an amazing cook :)

It was a great recipe, it made so many cookies. I have a friend that can't have gluten, so I tried it with gluten-free flour and I would not suggest it. Instead of cutout cookies, we made drop cookies

I was looking for a thick, soft sugar cookie, and this was the perfect recipe. I debated between this one and The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies, and decided to go with this one because it called for less flower and eggs. I'm glad I did because they turned out so well. 

I know some users recommended using real butter over margarine. I used Earth Balance vegan buttery spread, and that didn't seem to be a problem. Next time, I'm going to try subbing applesauce for the eggs to make them even more animal friendly.

I rolled these to about 1/3 inch thickness, cooked at 400 for 8 minutes, just like the recipe said. For my thinner and smaller cookies, they browned a little too fast, but this was perfect for the thicker, good sized cookies.

Unless I had some mutant flour the butter:flour ratio is way to small. You will likely need to add at least an extra half cup of butter/margarine to make the cookie dough useable

This was a very yummy cookie. The bake time did not work for me and I had very doughy cookies. I would bake for 10-12 minutes. The only thing I changed was that I used butter instead of margarine. Highly recommend this recipe

I love these cookies.. The dough is easy to handle which really makes them easy to roll out and cut. The cookie itself is tender and tastes wonderful. This is the second time I've made these. Delicious.

They weren't as soft as I was hoping they would be. However, they were delicious. Instead of all vanilla, I did half vanilla and half lemon. This gave the cookies a light lemon flavor. Yum!

I made this recipe last Christmas and let me tell this is the best sugar recipe. I had to make two batches because they didn't last long in my house. Can't wait to make it this year. The only change I made was I used butter instead of margarine got from other reviews. Thanks for sharing. :)

I am giving this recipe a 2 star because they did roll out nice and keep there shape. As for the taste I really did not care for this recipe very much, but I have not added the frosting yet. I hope this improves the taste.

I followed others suggestions and used 3 c flour and these still gave me a crumbly hard to work with dough. It definitely didn't need to be chilled. That made it hard as a rock. Flavor was OK but not worth the trouble.

Very tasty and soft.  Might add more vanilla or sub almond extract next time.  Also,  I rolled them a bit thicker than suggested.

Cookies turned out okay. I found the dough difficult to roll out. They were not as soft as I had anticipated. Tasted like an average sugar cookie.

I followed the directions exactly except I couldn't mix in all of the flour. It just got way too thick and I couldn't physically make it happen. I'd say I had roughly 1/2 cup  flour left over.

Despite that, they came out very nicely. Firm on the outside but soft inside with a mild taste, perfect for icing. The cookies also didn't puff up or spread out like I was afraid they might (my previous attempts in the past did, something awful).

I ended up with 44 cookies, roughly 2 inches wide each.

Disaster!  Maybe I used the wrong margarine but this mxiture was way too soft to roll out and cut.  I tried adding more suagr and flour and leaving it in the fridge overnight but it was still too soft.
In the end we made drop cookies, which were fine, but as a recipe for cookies to cut out it wasa failure

Great Christmas cookies! I always use butter, I would not touch margarine. I will roll them a bit thicker and bake them at a lower temperature next time as others have suggested.

I'm giving it a 5 even though I had some trouble with the dough. I left it in the fridge for 3 hours and the dough was still to sticky to do any thing with. My past experience with adding flour later in the recipe never turned out good. So I just used them as drop cookies and flattened them out some. Even with the problems the cookies came out great. I also used the sugar cookie frosting on here, its by far the best I've ever made. I'm getting ready to make another batch and adding the full 3 3/4 cups flour. The dough already looks and feels better.

I loved this recipe because the dough was easy to roll out and cut, whereas some doughs are so sticky.  My grandkids love them so the taste must be good too.  I used one tsp. almond extract and one tsp. vanilla, instead of two vanilla.  I also used real butter and baked at 350 degrees for 8 minutes.

This is a great recipe but make sure that, like everyone else is saying, keep they thick.  (~1/2 in.) If they are too thin they end up like an animal cracker. This recipe is easy and the cookies are perfect for decorating. Happy Holidays!

I didn't change anything about it because that was my first time making sugar cookies from scratch. I would definitely do it again. It was fun and challenging, but the best part was eating them!

Easy to make recipe. I used butter instead of margarine. I would add an additional 1 tsp of vanilla. Cookies held their shape nicely. Due to lack of time, I chilled them for almost 24 hours and the dough was still workable and cookies came out nice. Will definitely use this recipe again.

These were fun to make, quick, easy, and did not leave a mess behind.  I did not change any of the ingredients and they were not too sweet.  I did put butterscotch chips in some of the cookies for a change of taste! It was something my husband and I could enjoy.  Sweets give me headaches.  Chocolate of any kind gives me migraines - Grrrrr!

This recipe is awesome I did make some changes I only add 3 cups of flour , 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 teaspoon of almond extract and used butter instead of margarine. The oven temp I change to 350 for 7 minutes . Took them out when slitely brown around the edges. Their soft and chewy even after they cool for awhile. This will b my # one recipe for cutout cookies

These were so good! I took other reviewers' advice and only used 3 1/4 cups of flour,butter instead of margarine and baked at 350 for exactly 10 minutes. they stayed very soft even once cooled, and they are the perfect balance of sweet, vanilla and buttery flavors.

For an interesting switch,  i cut the flour by 1/4 cup, used melted butter, and didn't chill. This makes a drop cookie that is soft and chewy. All of my neighbors liked them so much, I had to make another batch as they were for a function. I used a simple buttercream frosting drizzled over the top. This yields about 75 cookies when a cookie scoop is used.

My niece and I made these for Christmas. I had high expectations for them, considering the reviews I read. However, they were much too dry, and lacked any real flavor. We had to put 3-4 layers of icing to make them taste good!

The cookies did turn out soft, but the texture is doughy and very weird. I followed some other recommendations and reduced the flour to 3 cups. Also, I used butter instead of margarine. Was there something I did wrong? I felt like it was unsuccessful.

Based on other comments, I reduced the oven temp to 375, and used butter instead of margarine. The dough was easy to work with, and the cookies were soft and tasted great. I'll definitely make these again.

These came out amazing. I did Christmas cookie cut out cookies at 5 minute intervals they cooked perfectly at the temperature listed. 

Highly recommend making these! People kept asking me for the recipe

Love love  this recipe  I've  been  looking  for  some  thing  like  this  for  years.  The  dough  is  so  easy  to  work with,  they  come  out  nice  and  fluffy  and  stay  to  true  to  size  they  don't  spread  like  some  other  cookie  dough. ,  I  roll  my  out  in  icing  sugar  instead  of  flour,  and  I  make  my  just  a  little  thicker  they  fluff  up  better,   but  the  key thing  is  (  use  real  butter  it's  a  must  )  I  had  about  3/4  of  a  stick  of  butter   left  threw  that  in  to,  I  only  had  salted  came  out  fine.  They  are  not  that  sweet  my  husband  is  diabetic  so  for  him  I  leave  them  plain,  the  rest  I  have  a  field  day  decorating  with  royal  icing  and  practicing  my  painting  skills , I  do  it  all  year  so  when   xmas  comes  my  family  think  they  are  store  bought  they  look  that  good.  Thanks  for  sharing  this  this  is  a  keeper  and  my  go  to  recipe  I've  done  looking.    Elaine

I made these cookies for Christmas and the whole family couldn't get enough of them! My only suggestion would be to cook them for a bit longer. I rolled the dough out to about 1/4 inch and I had to cook them for 8-10 minutes rather that 6-8. Aside from that, great recipe! (I recommend it with some frosting and sprinkles)

I followed the reviews and used only 3 cups flour, baked them at 350 degrees for exactly 8 mins, and rolled them out in icing sugar.  Great recipe

I used butter instead of margarine, but I still think these need a little something. Maybe a bit of flavored extract would help. They're by far the best cookies for rolling and cutting,very easy to work with the dough, but I think at the expense of flavor.  I'm going to try them again with some almond extract.

Good recipe. Great recipe, if you follow the easy prompts to 1) use 3 cups of flour, 2) use butter instead of margarine, and 3) bake at 350 for 8-10 min.

I have used a lot of different recipes over the years for rolled sugar cookies and EVERY SINGLE TIME I baked the cookies they would always lose their shape... Not these cookies. They kept their shape perfectly.  I did use butter instead of margarine and I also refrigerated overnight. I will use this recipe every year from now on. Best one ever!!!

It was a great recipe that was easy to follow! I also loved the taste of the cookies! I used the snowflake cookie mould and the effect was surprising as the ends of the snowflake were crispy yet the centre was soft. I had the best of both worlds! But for better results, you could bake it for a slightly longer time to see the brown and also use less sugar so that it is not too sweet.

Used the recipe as is and it came out wonderful. Little hard when it came out of the fridge but soften up when I pinned it. Didn't need any flour and it did stick but not much. Next time I just need to double the recipe as my cookie cutters were big.
Thank you

Great recipe made these cookies with my daughter and they were awesome!!!!

The only change I made was to cook these at 325 degrees for 20 minutes because my oven cooks very high.

Made exactly as is and they were perfect for frosting and decorating. Without the frosting, they may have been a bit bland though. The frosting added just the right amount of sweetness.

This was a fantastic recipe: but,my dough was a bit crumbly  because I added the full amount of flour. I think it would be better if I used butter instead of margarine and a little less flour.

The cookies were great! When they came out of the oven and cooled, they were fairly soft but with a tiny crunch as all cut out cookies have. I recommend adding some almond extract like what I did or lemon or orange to give it a bit of a kick if you're not icing them. Also after cutting shapes and before putting them in the oven, I recommend you refrigerate them for a few minutes to guarantee the shape doesn't spread. Overall would definitely make again!

Besides baking at 350 (about 6-7 min depending on thickness) and using butter instead of margarine, we didn't change a thing. It was a beautiful easy dough to work with and held it shape like any I've used in that past. Taste was delicious as well. Will use this recipe from now on!

Delicious! Crispy on the bottom, and soft on the top, I used three cups of flour and cooked at 350 for 8 minutes.

I'm 14 and this was the first time i've ever made homemade cookies on my own!! Instead of using 3 3/4 cups of flour I used 2. These aren't super spectacular tasting but I think a little hint of maple syrup will be good in the batter next time to add just a little extra kick of flavor :)

The dough was flakey, the cookie kept falling apart, it took a long time to prepare, was very messy and is not even edible in anybody who has taste's eyes.

These  are really good. They keep their shape and are soft another thing I prefer in sugar cookies. Eating rocks is just not my thing. I have also tried the other recipes on all recipes. This is the BEST> HANDS DOWN

Mixed results. This is the first time I've tried making this type of cookie. I followed the recipe. The dough was very hard to work with, very dry and crumbly, it took so long to roll and cut out the cookies. After 8 minutes in the oven they didn't look done at all, and since I like a crispy cookie I let them in til the tips started to brown. This however was a big mistake as the cookies turned out as hard as a rock! I was determined to try again. The next time I followed the advice of Tara1972 (melted butter, 3 cups flour, 350) and the cookies turned out just right! Soft and flavorful! I only let them chill for 50 minutes and they still came out just right and in time for the party. Happy 4th of July!

Best soft cookie recipe for icing cookies I have tried! I took the suggestions about using butter vs. margarine, baking at 300 degrees, and cutting the flour amount down to 1 cup. The cookies turned out perfectly and everyone who has tried them has enjoyed them.

I have used this recipe for the last few years, but every year I can't remember if I use butter or the margarine that is called for.  This year I tried melting the butter as reviewers suggested....NEVER again!  This made the cookies hard as a rock!  Still love the flavor and they worked great for stained glass cookies too

Let me just start by saying I don't bake. I have a hard time with directions (mostly cuz I'm impatient and want to so my own thing). So this recipe was perfect for me it was SUPER EASY. With that said, I've now made these cookies 3 times since the holidays began, each time they came out great! I found that in MY oven they only take about 5-6min (so I suggest you start off checking them at the 6min) and on the lighter pan for some reason they cook really fast so more like 4-5min. Also I don't leave in fridge for that long the dough becomes a bit unmanageable it just keeps crumbling. I leave it for like 40min

I did it today, and I really like how the drought came out, it was easy to work with it. I think that next time I would add a little more sugar because I think it needs a little more flavor. I bake cakes but it was my first time baking cookies and I think  they came out good for my first try at doing cookies.

Followed the advice of other reviewers and used 3 cups of flour, 1 cup of granulated sugar and 1 cup of confectioners sugar. These cookies were not very "sweet" like sugar cookies I've made in the past and probably will not be using this recipe again next year...

Yum Yum Yum! Soft when you take them out early enough, and didn't distort with baking! I used 3 1/4 cups for dough then a lot to to keep it from sticking while rolling out. Baked 8 min at 375! This is a keeper!

My Daughter and I have been using this recipe as is everyday. We keep a batch in the fridge and roll into little balls as needed. By rolling into balls and flatining to about a 1/4 inch thick then ad sprinkles of all and any kind. Then bake. They travel really well without loosing sprinkles everywhere. Thank you for posting this recipe. It's awesome!!! Oh I also use parchment paper ;)

I read a lot of the reviews, did as suggested i.e. cut the amount of flour, oven temp and cooking time. Flavor was fair (I added more vanilla and a touch of rum extract to taste). Cookies held the shape well but as they cooled, they turned to cement.

Easy. I just rolled the dough into balls and flattened them. Worked great.  These taste as good as my mother's recipe which is saying a LOT!!

Very good texture.  Even the cookies that I left in the oven too long and over-browned were perfectly soft the next day.  I did use butter instead of margarine and 3 1/2 c. flour.

Best sugar cookie recipe I've made so far!! One of the few cookie recipes I've ever used that I think actually tastes better using Becel margarine than butter. Very soft & nice flavour - I did have to add slightly more vanilla in second batch but that was probably because I was using artificial extract. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Kept shape wonderfully. Very good!

I used this recipe this year and they were very soft and yummy.  I made a few changes as per reviews suggested.  I used 3 cups of flour, rolled thick and cooked at 350 for 8-10 minutes.  I think next time I will try adding some almond extract too!

I think these cookies turned out wonderfully! I followed the recipe exactly (except cut in half) and had no problems! They kept their shape, came out soft and puffed up just enough. I gave them to my elementary students and they were a hit! Definitely a recipe to keep!

Followed recipe and made the minor adjustments using only 3 cups flour, using butter instead marg and used icing sugar to roll out. 350 for 10 mins. Never tasted sugar cookies before as I live in Ireland but they taste lovely. Only problem I found was my bigger snowmen ones broke when I lifted from the tray. The smaller ones retained their shape. Going to ice them now with the recipe from this site.

My version is not for someone looking for a cookie recipe to decorate and ice, BUT it does taste GREAT and the texture is GREAT.......I took everyone's advice and used 3 cups flour and used self rising flour instead of all purpose,powder & salt. I also used almond instead of vanilla flavor.....I put in the fridge for about 30 minutes on parch paper sprinkled with powder sugar. I didnt have any problem rolling them out.  I baked mine for 7 minutes. As they were baking they puffed up and out really big where you could not make out my shapes that I had cut, then they fell flat right before I took them out of the oven....They were very light, chewy and tasted GREAT.....It wasnt the receipe I was looking for since the cookie shapes I did(trees, santa, snow flake,etc) were so distorted that it wouldnt look good iced. But I will use these anyway and just do circles or squares and sprinkle with colored sugar before I bake. .....Well maybe one day I will find a sugar cookie recipe that I can use all my new cookie cutters on...

If you roll them out too thin then they get crispy. Not much flavor without the icing on top. I think a little almond extract would be better then vanilla to make them tastier. Takes more time then 8 min to cook or the dough is not cooked enough.

These make the BEST sugar cookies. I gave up on my mother-in-laws recipe a couple years ago as it was nearly impossible to work with. I used the suggestions of others here and used butter, 3 cups of flour and baked at 375. Oh, and I didnt chill the dough as I forgot about that step and didnt have time. These are by far the best sugar cookies I have ever had. Nice and soft, just the way I like them. I get a lot of compliments on them as well. Great with the Sugar Cookie icing (icing sugar and corn syrup) found on this site. But just as good without.

The flavoring was great! I followed the recipe, but my dough ended up crumbly and I had to work it with flour and water to make it stick together more. Once I did that I was home free with the rest of the process. My back is sore from working the dough like it was bread!

I followed this recipe except I had adjusted it for 35 servings. I cooked them at 375 for 11 mins, and rolled them to 1/4 in thick, but they never browned on tops at all so watched for slight browning underneath. They were cooked through but tasted like dough! I didn't like these at all. :(

Easy to make and delicious.  
 
I substituted butter for margarine but followed the rest of the recipe.  My 3 and 6 year old had a blast  rolling the dough, using cookie cutters and decorating.  I highly recommend this recipe for any baking level.

Great sugar cookie. Did have to make a few adjustments ie.. added more vanilla, adjusted the time and temp for baking. But otherwise followed the directions. These are great for special occasions topped with sugar cookie frosting by Kathy Brandt available on this site.

Ok once I cutout some of the flour.  Otherwise the dough is crumbly and hard and impossible to roll out.

I am always asked to bring these cookies to Christmas dinner.
They hold their shape really well if the dough is chilled and not over-worked. The only flavour in the dough is the vanilla, so use quality ingredients. I use a madagascar bourbon vanilla extract. 
I always frost them, but they're delicious even plain.

Ive made these cookies MANY times and with the rave reviews from friends and family have even started selling these! made 6 dozen for WKU graduation party  and also had rave reviews then. I do ulter recipe slightly. I use 1 cup each of white sugar as well as 1 cup powdered sugar as opposed to the 1 1/2 cups sugar. Use real butter. only 3 1/2 cups flour and I use powdered sugar for rolling out. Cut em thick and dont over bake and these will be the best cookies you ever made!

These were great  - so easy to work with.  I followed the advice to use 3C flour, roll the dough with sugar and I used almond extract instead of vanilla.

I followed the suggestion to bake at 350 and use butter. I did not reduce the flour and they turned out okay...a little firm, but tasty. Loved by all. I did split the extract between almond and vanilla for a little more flavor. 

We then decorated these with colored sugar. 8 dozen cookies later, we were exhausted, but we were amazed by how fast that many cookies can disappear when all your friends and family are eating them!!

These are our favorite. My family gets so excited when it's time to make our traditional cut out cookies. They stay soft and Moist and taste great with frosting on them or Plain. Absolutely the best sugar recipe, in my opinion

Good recipe. I followed the advice of others and reduced the amount of flour, and also baked them at 350 rather than 400. They turned out great.

This recipe has become a Christmas cookie tradition for my family.  We tried others from the site, but they would poof out and lose their shape.  Not these cookies; they hold their shape and keep the detail of the stamped cookie cutters.  Don't change a thing about this recipe - it's perfect!

Did as others suggested and cut down to 3 cups flour, and substituted butter for margarine like I always do when I bake.  I also added nutmeg, just a matter of personal taste.  With these modifications the recipe was fantastic.  Glad I used the suggestion of rolling the dough out between two sheets of parchment, made for much easier handling!

So I did the modifications as other users suggested. Only 3 cups of flour and baking at 350...DO NOT LEAVE DOUGH IN FRIDGE OVERNIGHT. I made that mistake and the dough was so hard I couldnt do anything with it. It needed to sit out for over an hour. I didnt bake the cookies that long and they came out really crispy. Not soft at all. Maybe because I chilled the dough for too long?

The best sugar cookie I have made thus far! I don't know that I would say that mine came out 'soft,' but they were definitely not crunchy.  I used just a bit more than 3 cups of flour and experimented with oven temps between 350 and 375- the cookies at 350 came out softer for sure.  The cookies were not too floury- a problem I've had with cutout cookies before.  After working the chilled dough a bit with my hands, it rolled out and cut BEAUTIFULLY!  I sprinkled the cookies with some colored sugar before baking.  I'll keep this recipe and try to tweak it to perfection!

I don't know what I did wrong but my cookies did not puff up.  They were flat, tasteless and hard.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used new flour and baking powder.  I'll try them again using some of the suggestions maybe.

These cookies came out perfect. After 4 hours in the fridge, rolling them out was as easy as can be. I cooked them for exactly 8 minutes on parchment  and they were just slightly brown around the edges.

I was really excited to try this recipe after reading all the reviews.  It did not work out for me at ALL.  I live at altitude so maybe that was the problem.  I could not roll the dough at ALL.  It was totally crumbly.

I followed this recipe exactly.  The dough was easy to work with after the 2 hours in the fridge.  I didn't think they were as soft and fluffy as my original sugar cookie recipe. I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't my favorite, but it was a good cookie.

What a great recipe! I did as other suggested (use real butter and only 3 cups of flour). I rolled them into balls and flattened them. Then dipped them in melted candy wafers. They were thick and chewy. This will be our sugar cookie recipe for many years to come!! Thanks Georgie!!

This is simply the BEST rolled sugar cookie recipe ever!  And they are so soft.  A huge hit with my family and are requested multiple times throughout the year-not just for the Holidays.  Simple recipe and very very easy to roll.  My niece loves making them when she comes to visit.  Will be a family tradition for years to come.

This isn't a bad recipe, i just find that they're not sweet enough. They have a great consistency though. Nice and fluffy. I think that if i do decide to make these again, i might try adding a little more sugar. Just personal preference. I think i like almost everything to be sweeter then most people prefer ;) Good recipe though!

I didnt like these too much. But it could just be my skills. I am a beginner, as I was rolling out the dough i used powdered sugar, i ran out of flour. I was very nervous not to overbake them. I think i might of actually underbaked them. If that makes any sense. I'll try another recipe as i continue to learn.

These are soooooo good! I do decrease the flour and also take care not to overbake. Take them out of the oven just as soon as they lose their gloss on top.

These cookies were pretty awesome! I didn't stray too far from the original recipe, I just added a little more milk bit by bit until I had the dough at a nice consistency to work with.  This will be my official sugar cookie recipe from now on!

Used recipe to make Valentines cookies for the kids teachers. It was very easy to make and after playing with time I had perfect moist chewy cookies. Took tip from previous post about cookies are done when center no longer looks wet regardless if browned on edges. Thanks for the recipe will be making a batch for my sons school in a few weeks.

These are very good.  I made them according to directions and they turned out wonderfully.  I overcooked a couple batches and they were a little crisp, but still very good.  Not too sweet, not too bland.  Update:  the last few times I've made these, I've skipped the refrigeration - just mixed, rolled out, and baked. I don't notice a difference other than they are so much easier to roll out.  I reduce oven temp to 350. Still my favorite sugar cookie!!

I HATE to make cut out cookies but agree to do so each Christmas with my kids because they love it.  I tried this recipe this year and loved it!  It was easy to work with after letting it sit in the fridge and after adding Barbara's Butter Icing for Cookies, they were perfect.  Even after being rolled and re-rolled by the kids, they were a great texture.  I did make the changes mentioned by others (real butter, temp at 350 and only used 3 c. flour) which is why I gave it 4 stars.  My father said they reminded him of Cheryl's Cookies!

These cookies were awesome.  I reduced the flour to 3 cups like others did and I did not use any extra when rolling out the dough(which I think made it more difficult for myself).  I also reduced the temperature to 350 and baked for 8 - 10 minutes.  Yum.

This was my first time making sugar cookies.  I mean at all, so I decided to go all out and make them from scratch.  I followed the recipe exactly and the only problem I had was rolling out the dough but I'm sure that was my fault, lack of technique.  Thank you so much.

My son and I tried this recipe this year, and really my family was not all that impressed.  The cookies were rated "ok".  I had to sweeten them up by covering them with chocolate and such.

Delicious cookie!  I followed the reviews of others only using 3 cups flour and dropped bake temp to 350.  Also, I used Earth Balance Vegan Buttery Spread instead of butter due to dairy allergies in my house.  I think that I rolled them out too thin because they are kind of crispy but they are still delicious.  The kids love them - especially my daughter who was so happy to be able to make cookies without dairy.  Thanks for a keeper...

Not sure what happened but these were NOT soft for me. I followed all the directions and was disappointed when the first batch was crispy. I made a 1/2 batch and made sure I left them thick enough (I know that is key for getting soft cookies with any rolled dough) and didn't over bake them but, again, they were crispy when cooled. I think I'll try a different recipe next time.

Good.  I reduced the flour to 3 cups like the other reviews said.  I tried both baking the cookies at 350 for 8-10 mintues and 400 for 6-8 mintues.  At 350, they were way too crispy for my taste, at 400 they were great.

These are the best sugar cookies I have ever had!  I just finished making them at 2:30am and I couldn't resist trying them - not the best pre-bedtime snack, but it was well worth it!!  I only used 3 1/4 cups flour (reading error on my part) and baked at 350 degrees for 10 minutes as a previous poster suggested and they are perfect...just a tad golden brown around the outside.  Can't wait to find another reason to make them!

This is an okay cookie.  I think sugar cookies are bland and boring so I usually add about 1tsp of Cinnamon and 1tsp of nutmeg.  That makes things a bit more exciting.  The dough is really yummy and my two year old had fun making stars and snowflakes.

These are delicious! I followed other reviewers' advice of using real butter, lowering the temp to 350, and only 3 cups of flour. Well, although this is the first time I've ever made cut-out cookies, it took forever to roll them out. That extra cup of flour I didn't use I wound up using to roll it out. Despite that, they came out tasty! :) Just keep an eye on them in the oven.

The recipe was good but the cookies did not rise. They were very flat and I like my cookies soft and chewy.

These are not the ones I make every year.  But  I brought the dough to a casual gathering, so the kids could make Christmas cut-out cookies.  The kids and their parents loved the cookies.  I think they were good, but sugar cookies with a little crunch are more my style.  THE recipe is Dora's from this site.

Amazing sugar cookies. I replaced butter for the margrine, and they turned out perfectly.

I read the other reviews before I started. I decided to use butter instead of margarine, and drop the temp on my oven. I also decided just to be flexible with the flour. I probably ended up using about 3 1/2 cups for the cookies.
They rolled out beautifully, were easy to cut and held their shape wonderfully.
I only gave them 4 starts because mine needed the icing to give them some extra taste. Don't get me wrong, the cookies were good- but I think all sugar cookies are a little plain.

great taste and very easy to roll out and make.  i did only use 3 cups of flour and only needed a handful of flour to roll out the cookies.  kept their shape completely and didnt spread at all.  the cookies were about 3" diameter, 1/4" thick and made 37 cookies. next time i will double the recipe and make them thicker so they're softer.  great taste!

The dough was really thick with all the flour. I cut it down to three cups and used the rest when rolling them out.
I made two batches for my extra large family at Christmas and all but five cookies were eaten. 
I iced them with a powdered sugar and shortening mixture and food coloring for festiveness.
They were favored by all.

These are really good sugar cookies.  I love how soft they are but how they still hold their shape.  These cookies are great with frosting or by themselves.

these are good, this is what I did, I used real butter, added all the flour and upped the vanilla to 3 tsp. I did not have time to roll out and cut into shapes so we rolled them into balls and slightly smashed them and they turned out great and had nice flavor, we used butter icing from this site and it was so good paired with this cookie. thankyou for a wonderful keeper.

A bit to sickly for my liking, all though a good combination of ingredients and sweetners. Great for puddings at Christmas time. The softness is great for that 'melt in your mouth' feeling. They are rather like 'marimite'- you either love them or you hate them! You will not want to many for that 'fat' feeling in the new year! Overall a rather good recipe!

These are the best sugar cookies. I love them. They are perfect. My family loves them. They are soft, crispy, and perfect for entertaining guests at parties. The perfect icing is a nice good royal icing. Thanks for the great recipe. Every holiday season, I will make these delicous cookies. Thank you.

These are delish! I followed the advice of some other reviewers and used 3C. of flour and butter instead of margarine. I baked at 350 for about 8-10 mins and frosted with Decorator Frosting (also found on this site.) They are melt in your mouth and just great. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I doubled this recipe. I did use about 1/3 amount of almond extract rather than the vanilla.
I divided the dough into 12 pieces before refrigerating.
The pre-k' class at church each rolled and cut out their own. 
We had plenty of cookies for mission work as well as for each child to take some home to share.
This was one of the easiest doughs I've ever worked with. When a 3 year old can roll and cut you know its a winner

I have made these for seveal years now and ice them with Sugar Cookie Icing.  I don't change anything and they always roll perfectly.  I like them after they have completely cooled and have been iced.  I always give them away in cookie exchanges.

Such a great tasting cookie.  I followed MARLAP's suggestion and used only 3 cups of flour.  Was really stickey but firmed up after chilling and using flour to roll.  Definitely suggest rolling on a silpat.  The thicker the better with these cookies.  Thinner ones didn't have the great texture and taste as good.

This is an excellent and simple recipes.  I love to just eat these cookies plain.  I do echo earlier review by saying that using butter makes all the difference and only three cups of floor.  You need to watch these cookies so they don't burn even at 350 degrees.  They are delicious!

Yummy cookie! I didn't chill or use cookie cutters, as I ran out of time. They cooked beautifully as rolled balls. Instead of vanilla I used almond extract and they tasted just like "Cookie Bouquet" cookies! Gobbled up fast!

Wonderful cookie - not too sweet, either. I chose not the chill the dough which did not seem the affect the cookies at all. 7 minutes baking time is all I did and they were perfect!

The dough was terribly sticky and I had to use a lot of flour to be able to cut out designs.  The taste of the cookie was as good as this style of cookie can get.  I've never loved the cut out with icing cookies that much but these were soft and tasted fine.  I will most likely use this recipe again next year at Christmas!

I love to bake. And I love sugar cookies. Although, I have yet to find a recipie as good as my aunt's. But these come in a close second. My aunt's are soft, chewy and tastes like cupcakes. As soon as I get the recipie, I promise I will post it. BUT THESE ROCK!!!

These cookies were great! A little less taste than sugar cookies, but perfect for frosting! I added these to my personal cook-book!

I also followed the suggestions for 3 cups of flour but I used margerine.  They turned out great!  We will frost with a very stiff buttercream & I'm sure they will be yummy.

These cookies are very fun and easy to make. I made half of a batch and only chiled if for half of the time and it did just fine. This dough is very easy to work with!

These bake up really well, and have a nice texture. Almond extract is a great substitute for vanilla if you like the flavour.

I made these on a whim Saturday night as a treat for Easter Sunday. My only change was that I used butter instead of marg, and they turned out really well and I definitely will be using this recipe again. 

Some posters said the cookies were not sweet enough - I can't comment because I didn't taste them plain. I used a sugar cookie frosting recipe I got off this site also (mostly confectioner's sugar, butter, and vanilla - plus some food coloring to make it pink) and that made them plenty sweet. My DH absolutely loved them, and I'm looking forward to making them again.

These cookies came out nice and soft, very tastey. I found it a little hard to dust them with sugar before baking, though. We ended up eating them without any sugar or frosting on top, which was actually quite good. I've already added this one to my list of favourite recipes.

these cookies were good. it may have been me, but the dough turned out waaay too dry. I added more of the margarine+sugar+egg+vanilla extract mixture to make it stick together.

Mmmm! I think these cookies are delicious!  I modified the recipe as suggested by other reviewers (3 c. flour, butter instead of margarine, 350 degrees for 8-10 mins.).  The cookies are not overly sweet, but that's what I like about them.  I am definitely going to make these again.

These were very good! I keep getting people asking me to make them again. Even the women in my husband's office have been requesting them!

I frosted some and left others plain. The frosted ones were more popular but they all got eaten! Be very careful with the thickness - I made some too thin and they were tastless. Better to make them too thick than too thin.

A good basic sugar cookie. The dough was very easy to work with, and they came out soft. I sprinkled mine with colored sugar.

These were definitely soft and the flavor was ok. I didn't use icing, but I spread strawberry jelly inbetween two cookies. I thought the cookies needed a little "something"... maybe more sugar? Next time I will try them with icing! Thanks for sharing.

I thought these were a little floury tasting. I didn't bother to read the reviews before i started or i would have made the adjustments that the other reviewers have stated. And the cooking temp and time definitley needed to be adjusted. I wil make these again just make a few alterations.

This was a great cookie. I followed the advice of TARA1972 from 6-20-03. I would also suggest transfering the dough into a wax paper lined container for the chilling process...it was difficult to remove from the bowl. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars.

Great recipe!  I used it in my cookie press and they worked wonderfully.  However, I made some of the suggested modifications: used 3.5 cups flour, real butter, and turned the oven down to 350.  My only dislike is I didn't feel they were very flavorful.

These were good. I plan on using this recipe for the holidays. Although, I will only chill for an hour. If you chill longer, let it sit out for awhile to soften. The dough was very dense and hard to roll out at first. By the time I was doing my last sheet...it was perfect. The cookies were very good.

I made these with my niece, who is 10, and we enjoyed making them. My nephew, who is 7, also helped. We made them for family Christmas and everyone loved them. We finished them in one day!

My boyfriend LOVED these cookies but I didn't think that they had much flavor. Opted to roll them into balls and flaten them with a glass instead of rolling them out to cut with a cookie cutter. Would have been to floury if we had done that! They were fun to make though!~

These turned out wonderfully - we ended up not even frosting them because they are so good and tasty on their own!  Very nice texture, and excellent, subtle flavor.
