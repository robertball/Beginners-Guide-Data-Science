I like this recipe but I omit the ketchup and dill and add 2 tablespoons of seafood cocktail sauce...I like the taste of the horseradish in the cocktail sauce...

Loved it - Every recipe of Chef John's is a hit.  Sprinkled parmigiana on top - even better.

The juice of a whole lemon??? I don't think so.  I used 2T of fresh lemon juice, and then added 1T sugar, more mayo, and sour cream to tone down the tart taste of the lemon.  I also added chopped sweet onion.  Was out of cayenne, so used 5-pepper blend.  The recipe calls for 1/3 C. chopped dill.  1/4 C. of chopped fresh dill is more than enough.  Depending on preference, add peas, bacon pieces, or even chopped hard boiled egg.  Good recipe.

this was great!  Made it spur of the moment.  Better than any deli salad.  Very easy with mostly common ingredients.  I didnt have the fresh dill but used dried instead and a shake of terragon.  Turned out great with the  dried herbs.  So if you dont have the fresh dill dont pass this one over for that reason, just used the dried.  I did cut the dried back a bit.  Added a tiny bit of finely chopped green onion to the dressing for an extra kick of flavor.  Also used a combo of salad shrimo and immitation crab because that is what I had on hand.  This recipe lends itself to lots of variety.  Definitely a keeper!

This is an excellent starter recipe. I added some things. One pound of blue crab meat along with the shrimp, one tablespoon Old Bay seasoning, capers, and as suggested four strips of crispy cooked BACON. Ya gotta love this guys recipes, he really knows his stuff.

This was the best shrimp salad I have ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly and added about a 1/2 cup of thawed frozen peas.  I will make this again.

We really enjoyed this salad.  I halved the recipe and two of us nearly ate all of it for dinner.  I followed another's suggestion and instead of ketchup and dill I subbed cocktail sauce.  I wish I'd added peas too but will next time.  I used frozen cooked shrimp which I cut into bite sized pieces.  Delicious!  I will be making this again.

Love shrimp & this recipe is the bomb!   Organized & made as advertised.  Added some green onions, but otherwise, this is delicious served on a bed of greens (with a touch of oil & vinegar).  I'll admit that I did use some sour cream in place of some of the mayo.  Just a touch of health concern.  Noticed some reviewers added peas -- yea, can do....and can think of fresh asparagus as an option also.  Yum.  Follow the recipe and you'll be pleased -- and please, please, don't omit the dill.  Shrimp, mayo and dill go beautifully together.

3-11-2016  ~Nothing fancy, just a good, basic shrimp pasta salad, which is just what I was after.  While the Worcestershire, Dijon and ketchup were all nice touches, the flavor of them was barely noticeable.  The lemon juice, however, had I used all that was called for, would have been way too much.  The mayo, not tempered by any sour cream, already provided plenty enough tang.  I totally forgot the red bell pepper, easy to do now that AR printing capabilities no longer allow for adjusting the font size. (Hint, hint, AR)  Fortunately, the fact that I added some green peas made up for that unintended omission.  Also, I left the shrimp whole – they’re too pretty to cut up and the size called for is just right to do that.

I made this for memorial day weekend and it went over with a bang. In fact, any leftovers were eaten by my boyfriend before I had a chance to have some the next day!  I didn't change a thing and it was delicious.

Make 4x  now!!!  Excellent!!!  Note:  Do NOT substitute sour cream for the mayonnaise!  Not good at all!  Make dressing "as is"!  Use all the lemon suggested and make it a heaping 1/3 cup of dill!  Amazing!  Can add to salad:  1 medium scallion and some frozen cooked peas - AWESOME!  Salad is better at room temperature  and gets batter the next day!  May have to add a tiny bit of mayonnaise coming out of fridge if seems dry.  This salad is one of the best salads I've had!  Going to make every time we barbecue out!!  Great job!!

increased this to 30 servings for a large crowd and substituted pasta shells with dry cheese tortellini (cooked of course), also used dry dill weed.  Turned out great, everyone loved it.

We absolutely loved this, I think it's going to be one of my new summer goto recipes.  I did make a couple small changes.  I omitted the red pepper (food allergy) and substituted 1 chopped tomato, and because I forgot the celery, I substituted a diced zucchini (because I had one in the fridge) and it was fantastic.  The entire batch only lasted about 3 days in my house.

You've just got to love Chef John!  Anyway, this is a great salad---better the second day!  I did season it with a little Tajin (dried lime and chili), and I am going to add a little chopped green onion to my leftovers for dinner tonight.  The shrimp I used were big ones, so I cut them in thirds. Perfect!  Thanks again, Chef!

I have made this twice now and its fantastic! The first time i used shrimp and the second time i used imitation crab. Both were great. I really think the fresh dill is key here. This is a great way to use up veggies that are in the fridge, too, because the dressing is so good with any vegetable.

This was okay, a bit on the bland side. I might have screwed up the recipe though by adding a bit much pasta and less shrimp than called for.

What a great summer recipe!  The only change I made was using 1/2 of a lemon, and it turned out perfect.  My fussy eater loved it and this recipe is definitely a keeper.  We had some summer corn on the side and homemade peach cobbler for dessert with ice cream.  It doesn't get any better than that!

I took this to a picnic potluck and it got devoured.  It's a classic summer salad.  It has quite a bit of mayonnaise though if that's not you're thing.  I will make it again.

My dressing was a little soupy.  A "juice of 1 lemon" can be subjective.  Next time I will use less lemon, but otherwise, delicious!

So good... so very very good. Love the flavor of the fresh dill in this. I made the recipe exactly and it was perfect after an overnight in the fridge.  I think this would also be fantastic with a substitution of grilled chicken for the shrimp.

Loved it.  Didn't have tiny shrimp but used 50-60/# size and cut them in half, lengthwise.     Used mezze penne pasta.  Delicious!

Awesome dish! It was the first side that was completely gone at our party! I used Old Bay and horseradish as well. 2 tbsp of lemon juice does the trick. Added both shrimp and crab meat! This is definitely a keeper :)  Thanks for sharing!

Surprised that several questioned the addition of catsup to the mix, since it immediatey made me think of "Louis Dressing" when I read the recipe prior to shopping/making it.  I think dill is one of my favorite herbs of all, so the combo REALLY rocked.  However, I had to laugh since again, it was either too much or too little lemon.  THIS is when I make my FIRST taste adjustment.  Squeeze lemon juice into ramekin, & add a little at a time, taste, add or quit, & so on.  On ANY recipe with lemon, & hot spices it is imperitive you add slow, & taste, taste, taste!   You can always add more, but it's next to impossible to correct, at least not without a lot of hassle.   HTH!!!  Blessings!!!

Just made this shrimp & pasta recipe and it turned out great.  I used wild pink shrimp from Key West and they were like candy!  I like other reviewer's idea about using cocktail sauce instead of ketchup. My lemon was very,very juicy so maybe cut back next time.  Also ... A+ for visuals.

I've been looking for a good seafood salad recipe but could never find one that suited my taste buds.  But I love this one!  Very fresh!  I used the small already cooked salad shrimp though which was more economical and a time saver, didn't have cayenne so used some chili - lime seasoning, also used red, yellow and orange peppers.

This recipe is excellent. To put a little twist on it, try adding about a teaspoon of Chef Paul's Seafood Magic, and a teaspoon of dried chives to the mayonnaise before resting in the refrigerator. Great job Chef John!

This was really good. I did omit the dill and catchup and added 3 oz of imitation crab and 1/2 cup of frozen peas thawed. I had to add additional sauce because my shells soaked up the first batch of sauce. Everyone really liked it. It also tasted even better the next day. I will be making this again.

I have made this for several parties and it’s always a big hit. It has great flavor with a little kick. Also looks like it’s more expensive than it is because of the way the shrimp is cut. I keep this on my short list of go Tom recipes.

Very good recipe! I put a little Old Bay on my shrimp and wish I skipped it. It added too much salt for me and I never added any salt to the recipe. Taste as you go! Very yummy! I did make my pasta and sauce early in the morning and finished it when I got home.

Wonderful summer salad!  The only modifications were the addition of 3 chopped scallions, and 3 pieces of crispy bacon broken up into bits. Hubby said he would have enjoyed it even without the shrimp. Next time I might add a little imitation crab but really it was great as is. Definitely keep the dill. If you need to tone down the lemon a bit, add about a tsp of sugar.

Loved it!  Added Old Bay seasoning and chopped green onions but otherwise made it as is.  Use all of the lemon and if you like dill, don’t be afraid to use more.  I refrigerated it for about 4 hours and every one loved it.

This salad is my new favorite and has become my go-to for potlucks!   The only change I’ve made is to add some sliced black olives to the rest of the ingredients.  I use about 3/4 of the dressing when I put the salad together, throw it in the fridge for a couple of hours, and then stir in the rest.. Perfect!

We liked it very much! I had some leftover boiled shrimp, so I chopped a dozen or so up, and used some homemade cocktail sauce which was basically the same ingredients as this recipe called for, adding mayo as needed for creaminess. I didn't have any dill and added a bit of cucumber and green onion that needed to be used as well. I just added the amount of vegetables and pasta with the shrimp until the proportions looked balanced to me. Turned out great! Thanks Chef!

Too much dressing. Good as is but I think I could give it a 4 stars with adjustments;  reduce the dressing by half. Reduce the dill, for me it's overpowering.  You need to really like it.  I used dried by adjusted by a great deal as you should when substituting dry for fresh.

Cooked fresh shrimp as directed on Old Bay seasoning package. Strangely we were out of Ketchup so I substituted 2 T. mild salsa and a generous squeeze of sriracha; also used dried dill mix from Pampered Chef instead of fresh dill. We will make this again and again. Should make for great summer planned overs to keep in the fridge.

I followed recipe as close as possible with ingredients I had on hand. I was hesitant about adding all the mayo since I usually add only enough mayo to bind stuff together in a salad. My instincts proved right, the salad had great flavor but way too much mayo for my taste and health. I’d cut down to 1 cup next time I make this.

I loved, I did make a lot. Honestly.  If you’re not making this for a large group of people then you might want to reduce the amount by half because it is a lot of food but those that did try loved it and even took some home without me knowing thank you so much

This Shrimp and Pasta Salad is one of my favorite summer recipes. I have made it numerous times.

The salad is best when all of the ingredients are super-fresh. (Fresh celery, dill etc). It tastes even better on the 2nd day when all of the flavors have had a chance to soak in. 

My husband absolutely loves this dish. I make twice the dressing because that's the way he likes it. 

To make things easy, I add two containers of fresh shrimp from Costco Deli, cutting off the tails and slicing each shrimp in half.  This is about twice what the recipe calls for, but I like the shrimp to be chunky and dominant in the dish. With the dill and the dressing, it tastes divine.

Made this last night and we loved it.  Had the rest for lunch today and was even better than yesterday.  Made almost according to recipe except made my own cocktail sauce and added just a bit of horseradish plus some scallion.  This gave it the zing it needed.  Will be making again.  Thanks Chef John you never fail us.

I added: one red bale pepper, two TBS capers, 1/2 tsp crushed, dry, peppers, three scallions, cocktail sauce instead of ketsup, one tsp of old bay seasoning then followed the recipe as written.  My husband, brother, and his girlfriend and myself all had seconds and raved about it! It will definitely become a regular for us. Chef John had suggested additions of  other veggies and the seasonings were suggested by other reviews.

This was delicious and a huge hit in my home. I didn't have to make any modifications (other than using medium shrimp since my store was out of small shrimp). I did add a bit more salt and pepper to taste once it settled in the refrigerator. I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make. The first time I made it I followed the receipt exactly. The second time I added frozen langostino lobster along with the shrimp and that was awesome too. Thank you Chef John. Love your recipes.

Yum! I did as another posted suggested and used cocktail sauce in place of ketchup (if you don't have any, throw together some ketchup, a bit of horseradish, a dash of Worcestershire, a bit of lemon juice, and a dash of hot sauce). I also included baby peas. I'll certainly make this again.

My husband will not eat any foods that contain Mayo in it, so I substituted 3/4 of the Mayo with sour cream and only used 1/4 Mayo and followed the recipe as shown.  He never noticed the difference and ate 2 huge helpings.  It's great for lunch or dinner.

Turned out very good. Used elbows for the pasta. Would probably use less Italian dressing next time. Will make  again

Tasted great for a macaroni salad (not my favorite side dish--made it for a family party).  Good enough for seconds!

This is the best basic recipe for shrimp pasta salad that I have found. I've made it twice for a large crowd, and people loved it. I made several changes. I used cocktail sauce as others suggested, and I also used Old Bay instead of cayenne. I used less lemon juice than called for in the recipe. Also, adding crab meat from a few clusters of snow crab legs plus some immitation crab meat gives it a great seafood flavor.

One word.......delicious!! Not just a summer salad! ! Its almost Thanksgiving and it was delicous for dinner last night :-) The only changes I made was, added chopped red onion and extra celery, but thats only because I like a lot of crunch. I also used Cocktail sauce instead of Ketshup as someone else suggested. I kept the Dill and Lemon exactly as the reciped called for and it was perfect for us.  I have saved this recipe and will definitely be making it again. AWESOME!!

Made the dressing as per instructions but found it quite bland. Otherwise it would have been good as I added lots of veggies: peppers, carrots, frozen peas celery, green onion and cucumbers all diced up small.
Jazzed the leftovers up the next night with more of the leftover dressing, sundried tomatoes, and chopped capers. Huge improvement and now we really liked it.

I have made this several times this summer and it was a huge hit. The only changes I made were 2T of cocktail sauce instead of ketchup and 2T of lemon juice. I wanted to know if anyone has the nutrition information for this.

I made this today and its very good.  I will use that dressing for many things, I love the dill and lemon, it is so fresh. The changes I made were I used larger shrimp. I boiled the shrimp and then thru it into an ice bath. I like the consistency of the shrimp better than the salad shrimp. I didn't have a fresh lemon on hand so I used lemon juice. I did add additional mayo at the end and a little more dill and lemon. Thank you for this recipe Chef John!

Did the recipe as-is, for 4 servings (everything halfed). It was good, but tasted like something my mom brought to a party in 1978. Edible, but no one in my house would eat it. 4 stars because normal people would probably think this is good.

I modified the recipe, so I don't feel right giving less stars, though it needed a lot of oomph to make it exciting enough for my taste. I used plain Greek yogurt instead of mayo, but needed an extra half cup. Juice of 2 lemons, zest of one, and 1/4 cup capers. It was still just ok. I wish I had used the shrimp for ceviche. I think I just don't like mayo based pasta salads. It made for several filling, high protein, low fat meals though.

Chef John's recipes never disappoint. I always make first pass as written. My many years of experience & other reviewers suggestions may lead me to additions/alterations. In this case, only had freeze dried dill & no red bell pepper. Did add peas & xtra celery. Used frozen, cooked , deveined, cleaned small salad shrimp thawed= perfect . Light Mayo & med shell pasta. Delicious & pretty! Thank you Chef John once again.

I made the dressing first, as written, and tasted as I went along. Too tart for my taste, (hence the 4 stars) so added a little less than a 1/4 cup of sugar to it. No fresh dill so added 2 tsp of dried dill. Added about 1/2 tsp of Old Bay instead of cayenne, then I doubled all of that for 16oz of small shell pasta, which gave me plenty of dressing for the inevitable pasta soak-up. Added the rest of the ingredients as listed. Very good after my changes.

I love this recipe, I added some grated carrots for color and sweetness.  Reduced the lemon juice in half.  The addition of Catsup, and Worcestershire sauce, may seem old, but believe me it lends a nice flavor.  You will need know it's there.  All in all, an excellent recipe.

Followed the recipe, using all the ingredients +/-. I prefer a higher protein to fat ratio so I added the chopped whites (where the protein of an egg resides) of 4 eggs (less cholesterol w/o the yolks but they are optional). Needs extra Light Mayo if using eggs. Some good ideas from other reviewers...like peas. I don't mind some diced red onion in my cold pasta salads...and/or cubed cheddar cheese. Lots of ways to go. Think I'll avoid the sour cream option, though yogurt might work in conjunction w/ mayo.

OMG it was delish! The only changes I made was that I used Medium shells and  the "zest" and juice of 1/2 of a lemon. (my lemons are large , and the other half went well with shots of tequila). and being off season here, i used 2 TBS of dry dill weed and 1 TBS of dry tarragon, in place of the 1/3 cup of fresh chopped dill. other than that , I followed the recipe pretty exact . . thank you Chef John

This was a huge hit at our home.  I made this as a salad option for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it.  I had to make a couple of adjustments for our availability and taste. My local grocery store was out of dill so I omitted it.  Also, I cut the may back to 3/4 of a cup as we were trying to make it a little healthier.

This is really delicious!    I followed the recipe exactly and it cam out just right.  The fresh lemon juice adds a light spring to the dish.  Next time, for my own taste and health, I am going to add a couple of chopped eggs.  Definitely, do it again!

This is a great pasta salad.  I used  rotini pasta as that is what I had.  I made the dressing according to the recipe but next time I will try the seafood cocktail sauce instead of the ketchup.  I doubled the shrimp and used large size to make it more a main dish.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this for a dinner party this weekend, I thought it was good but didn't get the raves I'm used to.  I added crab to the mix, and spiced it up with some horseradish and Old Bay as other reviewers suggested.  Also added peas and some other colored peppers to the mix.  Might just be my tastes, I guess I'm used to bolder flavor so, and despite my best efforts , and a good amount of money for the added crab, I was a little disappointed.  I probably won't do this again.  But enjoyed trying.  Thanks. CJ.

This was a nice change from the other vegetarian pasta salads I usually make.
I only had large shrimp so I cut them into 3 pieces and that made them the same size as the pasta, which is the point of cutting them.
Also subbed some dried dill for fresh.

Also used cocktail sauce instead of ketchup. Omitted salt, dill & cayenne. Added celery. Used 3/4 cup mayo, 1 tsp mustard. Also 2 Tbsp lemon juice & 1/2 cup frozen peas.

I did season it with a little Tajin (dried lime and chili), and I am going to add a little chopped green onion to my leftovers for dinner tonight. The shrimp I used were big ones, so I cut them in thirds. Perfect!

This dish was pretty good. I used salmon instead of shrimp. At the last minute I added cocktail sauce as another reviewer suggested, and I was happy I did because it added a great flavor. Next time I will use about half the mayo, more red bell peppers, and I will add green onions or sweet onions for a little more crunch.

1 tsp of salt is pretty salty for this recipe.  May want to start with less.

I made this the day before a Potluck.  Used rotini pasta and large chopped  shrimp.  Added more dill and cayenne before serving.  Loved the lemon with the shrimp.

2nd time - Did not have celery so cooked some asparagus and added it in.  Excellent.

Great, easy salad. Much easier than what I've been making.  I skipped the dill and added plenty of Old Bay seasoning instead, to give it that good Eastern Shore flair.
