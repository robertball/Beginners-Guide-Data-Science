LOVED it!  I did make some changes..I sprayed the inside of my crock pot with a little pam. I tossed the apples in 2 tsp of lemon juice and 1 tsp cinnamon...I used a 1 cup of crushed grahm cracker instead of the sliced bread..and I added one cup of chopped walnut to the crumb topping.  WHAT A HIT!!! kids loved it...Top it off with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream!

Oh my goodness. This is heavenly. My changes: 9 pieces of bread and 2 sheets (8 squares) of graham crackers that have been crumbled. No nutmeg. Instead I used a bit of apple pie spice. I did not layer bread mixture on top of apples. I mixed everything together and stireed about 4 times during cooking. Set on high for about 1 - 1 1/2 hours. Had it with a big spoonful of vanilla ice cream. Will make this very often for the family.

This was so good, and so easy.  I used 3 fuji apples, 1 granny smith, and a pear, just because. I added approx. 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract to the melted butter. Oh I also threw in 1/2 c. chopped pecans with the bread, was good with and would have been good without too. This one is a keeper because it is easy to prepare and most of the ingredients are things you have on hand.

Everyone I make this for loves it.  I doubled the recipe for a crowd, layering apples, bread, apples, bread.  It really fills a large crock pot.  I usually use several kinds of apples, usually what is on sale, but try to include one type of baking apple. Is best with ice cream but have used a little half and half over the top.

I have been wanting to try this easy recipe for a while, and had the chance today. I used sprouted wheat bread and 3 different kinds of apples. I also threw in a handful of granola that I had, along with about 2 tablespoons of water. It was really good, I love the way it smells.

The flavor of this recipe was good, but the texture was off.  I was expecting a bread pudding-type dessert.  However it wasn't as moist as bread pudding, and it wasn't crispy either. The topping was just dry. Maybe next time I'll mix up the bread topping with the apples.  I did like the ease and simplicity of this dessert.  I served it with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe was wonderful!  As recommended by others, I used 3 fugi apples, 1 granny smith, and 1 bosc pear.  I also used graham crackers instead of bread and mixed 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract with the melted butter.  It was a hit!  Not a drop left at my son's cub scout Blue and Gold Banquet!!

This recipe was great!!  Although, I got the directions wrong and mixed the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt with the apples.  I corrected it by mixing another 1/2 cup brown sugar with a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg with the bread cubes.  Poured butter over the whole thing and let it cook on low for 3 1/2 hours.  My family loved it!!!

Simple, easy to prepare and tasty.  I added some oats and served it with custard.  This is by no means a fancy dessert set to impress but for a simple midweek or family dessert this is ideal.

I thought this was very easy and simple to make but when eating it just seemed like to much bread.  It had a good taste but I could have also used a little more sugar.

I agree with all the rest of the reviewers, this recipe is definately well worth it!  It's very sweet and very buttery.  My change was only that I used 10 slices of Apple Cider Raisin bread available at the local grocers at this time of year.  It is a rather large loaf so 10 slices made a batch that was more bread than it was apples.  No problem.  My family loved it anyway.  The next time I make it, I think I will go 5 and 5.  5 cups of apples and only 5 slices of bread.  This recipe is going into the recipe box, there is no doubt about that!

Really good basic recipe.  I followed the measurements exactly (although I followed a variation for the bread), and the buttery spice taste came out just like I like it.  Not too strong, not overly buttery for my own tastes.  I used whole wheat pita, added a couple of handfuls of oatmeal, and some walnuts.  I don't think I'd have liked it as much without the oats and walnuts - they add some needed texture.  I had no ice cream to eat with it, but that would have been really good.  My hubby and I ate it warm right out of the crockpot and both enjoyed.  It was a little dry, but if we'd eaten it with ice cream that probably wouldn't have been an issue.  I'll make this again and probably use more apples next time - very easy, quite tasty and comforting.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I followed someone's suggestion of using graham crackers instead of bread and tossing the apple slices in lemon juice, and it tasted GREAT! I left out nutmeg bc we didn't have it on hand, and added a mixture of brown and white sugar and layered it with the apples. Great recipe--thanks!

I made this for my in-laws last week. As it was cooking my MIL commented on how good it smelled in the crock pot. When I told her it was apple brown betty she told me that she once made one that won an award at a state fair! I wish I had known that before I made it. Now the pressure was on! Well, my MIL and FIL RAVED about it! I had made the Amish white bread from this site earlier in the week and used the rest of the loaf for the bread in the recipe. I also used 3 different types of apples (mac, courtland and gala) which gave it a nice texture. I topped it with vanilla ice cream from this site. Between 4 of us there was none left! My MIL even called me the next day and was still raving about how good the ABB was!

I used plums instead of apples & this was awesome! I was just wanting to use up some plums, so I tried it. I did add the 2tsp of lemon juice to the fruit still. I also only used 4-5 pieces of bread; that seemed to be plenty. And, like some1 else I added some vanilla to the butter. Other than that I followed the directions exactly & it turned out to be delicious! The bread was perfect; not crunchy, just moist. And, we topped it with whipped cream ^_^

Was a little leary, but it turned out wonderfully.  Sub the bread for a cup of crushed cinnomon grahm crackers.  Added tsp of lemon juice to apples along with some cinnomon and stired. grahms on top and butter.  Was so yummy

I made this tonight and everyone loved it.  The only things that I did differently: I used wheat bread(all I had), splenda brown sugar, I added a dash of vanilla.  I also cooked 2 hours on high instead of 3 hrs on low.  It came out fine.  Will definitely make it again.

Very good and easy to put together.  Used Golden Delicious apples and they were just right for this recipe.  Will make again.  By the way, I followed the directions exact. Thank you for sharing.

I used 4 apples (1 granny, 3 empire) and sliced right into crock pot. Added 2 tsp lemon juice and stirred it up. Mixed 1 cup cinnamon graham crackers (instead of bread) with 1/2 tsp vanilla + recipe ingredients. It was on high for 1 1/2 hours (small slices); smells and tastes great! **UPDATE**  I doubled the recipe to bring to a meeting. I put the apples first, then the topping, then the SECOND layer of apples with its topping. This way all the apples have the cinnamon and sugar taste. Started the slow cooker at my house 1/2 hour on low, drove to the meeting, plugged it in again for an hour on low. Perfect! Not mushy, but next time I'll be cutting back on the butter to 3/4 stick because the apples all just swimming in butter at the bottom.  (By using cinnamon graham crackers, no separate cinnamon spice is needed)

This was a great recipe!  I didn't follow it exactly but, it was a great start to my finished product.  I loved the way the bread almost melts when it's done.  I used cinnamon swirl bread and a mixture of sweet and tart apples.  Serving it over vanilla ice cream is an absolute must!  I served mine hot because, no one could wait to try it.  They were all begging me to dish it up; they weren't willing to let it cool down a little.  I will definitely make this again.  It was easy and really awesome!

Pretty Easy. A good way to use up leftover breads. I used a couple slices raisin bread, a couple hamburger buns and 2 slices white bread.
(A little extra cinnamon too, because I love the aroma as it cooks). To make the topping a little more interesting a handful of large flake oatmeal was sprinkled on top,(which resulted in a lovely crunch)
Final hint...I took the lid off the crockpot after the first hour and finished cooking the final hour lid-less, which helped the top to be firm and crunchy, instead of soft and soggy. Will definitely do this recipe again.
Raymond just called...he REALLY LIKED THIS. Next day was even better he says.

Turned out very good.  Changed it up a bit, only added 8 pieces of bread, added 2 graham crackers (crumbled) and some chopped walnuts to the top.  I think I'll add a bit more walnuts next time and mix it in with the other "stuff".  Very good with vanilla ice cream!

It was tasty but I need to cut the bread cubes smaller.  Also I would have mix the butter with the cinnamon & sugar then tossed it with the bread cubes instead of puring it over them.

My family absolutely LOVES this. its so easy to make. I added a little bit of vanilla and instead of regular bread we used a small loaf of cinnamon raisin bread.I highly recommend doing this (us a little less cinnamon in the recipe if you don't want to much cinnamon). 

I didn't measure out how much apple we used but i cut up about 4 apples

I found this recipe yesterday and it reminded me of an old family favorite that no one has a recipe too. It was fantastic - I used all the ingredients it called for although I didn't measure anything. My lunch guest was -WOW - what do you call this? We served with Snickerdoodle (cinnamon) Ice Cream.. 

It's a keeper.

I made this last night and thought it was wonderful except for the granny smith apples they remained sour.   Next time I will use a different apple.  I think it would be perfect with fuji apples.

I have been making this for over 15 yrs and it is always a hit. I use whatever leftover bread I happen to have on hand (italian and french are best as they are denser they hlod up better ).  Be careful not to use  very ripe apples as they create a runnier,thinner sauce. Otherwise the only difference is that I slice my cored apples into eighths (not diced) and cook for 4 hours. DELICIOUS!!

I used half bread half graham crackers and thought it was great. I also added some dried cherries for a little bit of tart kick. It could have used some crunch as it all becomes quite soft in the slow cooker so I think next time I'll add a little granola to the top before serving or maybe some candied pecan crumbles.

YUM!!!  I made this recipe this weekend and what a hit!!  I did follow some of the suggestion and added a 1/4 cup of orange juice to the apples and some vanilla extract to the butter.  I also used cinnamin raisin bread and mixed a few times while in the slow cooker.....definitely a keeper..easy and delicous!!

loved this recipe except, i substituted quick cooking oatmeal,instead of the bread cubes. cinnamon-raisin bread will also be a good altenative to white bread. i have a "crock-ette" a smaller version of the crockpot. so i could  make half of this recipe.

Really enjoyed this recipe, both for ease of making and taste.  Ended up using about 4 cups of apples due to the size of our crock pot and did double the spices to suit our tastes.  Yum!

Good recipe easy to make yet too dry.  I added Gingersnap cookies crumbled up vs. bread cubes and for moisture added orange juice and it worked out well.  Great taste too dry.

My wife and I thought this was an excellent recipe. This dish was served with ice cream and it came out great. I noticed that some people who ate this dish without ice cream were not as impressed with it. I will definitely make this again. It is a simple recipe to prepare.

I added cinnamon sugar to the apples, then used some homemade gingerbread for the bread cubes and sprayed with butter-flavored cooking spray.  It was YUMMY especially with vanilla ice cream.

I doubled this and added an extra stick of butter - I know it's a lot - and also added a little more brown sugar. I sprinkled nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice on the apples in addition to the bread. After letting it cook a little while, I mixed in the bread making it really soft and gooey. I got great reviews.

I doubled this recipe and made it for a potluck at church tonight. After allowing it to cook as per the recipe, I tasted it and it was good but I felt like the apple to bread ratio was off,  and I didn't have anymore fresh apples so I added a can of apple pie filling, about  1/8 teaspoon of ground ginger, and 1/4 tsp of salt and it was perfect. I used 1/2 Pepperidge Farms Light Style Soft Wheat bread and 1/2 Pepperidge Farms Very Thin 100% Whole Wheat Bread and I love the outcome! I gave my stars based on the original recipe! It was not as well received at church as I thought it would be, but I didn't complain about bringing it home for my family to finish!

Halving the recipe is a perfect amount to fill up my little crockette.  After reading reviews, I used cinnamon  raisin bread, and mixed in about a half cup of chopped walnuts.  The only hard part about this recipe is waiting for it to be done.  Delicious, and so easy.

Amazing! Just like bread pudding with apples.  I took others advice by mixing all ingredients together and cooked on high for 1 1/2-2 hours.  Also used part graham cracker and part bread.  Will make again!

Just made this tonight and it turned out great. My modifications: used 5 granny smith, 4 fuji apples, added vanilla extract, reduced to 1/2 cup brown sugar, used 10 slices of freshly baked cinnamon raisin bread from our local grocer's bakery, and added another 1/4 cup of butter. I mixed everything all together in the crock before setting. Delicious and easy; this one is a keeper.

This recipe was fabulous! The only changes I made were to add a little lemon juice to the apples and I used cinnamon raisin bread instead of other suggested types of bread. We also had it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Wonderful flavor and so easy. I'll make this ofton for my family (who raved about it).

This recipe was easy and delicious. I served it last night for dessert to my company with Vanilla Bean ice cream. It's definately a keeper!

I have made this several times. I like to add chopped pecans and/or raisins to my apples.  We serve it either with milk poured over or with ice cream.  The smell is wonderful!

Good flavor. Not as moist as I was expecting. Seems to need more spice and some liquid, maybe 1/2 to 1 cup of cider. Going to do a variation for my next Family dinner, I'll let you know. Thank you and don't get me wrong, it tasted good!!!

It was excellent! I made it exactly per the recipe, merely adding chopped pecans. Do it! You'll love it.

This was great. When I read a review I want to know what THIS was like, not what changes you made. If you change it, post your own  recipe and we will rate that one!

I like to make all your recipes exactly as shown except the sugar.  I only used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar.     I really loved it.

This Apple Brown Betty is the closest I've found to the one I made weekly with my Grandma growing up in Mississippi. I make with these few changes. Today I used 2 Macintosh, 2 Granny Smith, and 1 Honeycrisp apples peeled and diced; 10 slices white bread cubed and tossed with 1/2 c. melted butter, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 c. packed brown sugar, 1/8 tsp salt. I layered apples, bread, apples, bread in a 9 inch baking dish and then slowly poured half & half over the top just until I could see the cream rising in the sides of the dish. It was probably 1/2 cup or so, i never measure. Adding cream or milk takes care of the dryness that one reviewer mentioned. Cover dish with foil and bake at 350 for 30-45 minutes until apples are fork-tender. Remove foil and bake an additional 10 minutes until top is nicely browned. Remove from oven and let cool slightly. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream. Divine!

I used graham crackers and my family really liked it.  We had it warm over vanilla ice cream.  The creaminess of the ice cream was a perfect compliment.  I do think that it has room for improvement though.

All-n-all the recipe is easy to follow. As for taste, whats not to like about apples and brown sugar. Use your favorite cooking apple and you should be happy with it. As for the bread type topping, did not care for it at all. Would like to find a substitute that has a bit more texture.
