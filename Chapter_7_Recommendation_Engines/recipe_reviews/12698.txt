This is the best!  Being a Floridian, I have had my share of both very good and very bad Key Lime Pie.  I did make a few changes to the recipe after reading the reviews.  I only used 4 egg yolks, I used 2 cans sweetened condensed milk, and I used 1 cup key lime juice.  Hint**If you can not find any key lime juice then just use equal parts lemon and lime juice (best if fresh). These adjustments will make more filling than needed, but the texture and taste is better.  I had to increase my baking time by 15 minutes.  I prebaked my redi-crust and this came out great. The new #1 key lime pie for my family.

As other reviewers mentioned, I used 4 egg yolks, 1 cup of lime juice, and 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk.  This was just the right amount to fit in the premade pie shell.  I then decorated it using whip cream and a pastry bag and garnished with lime wedges.  Let's just say, the family was impressed not only with the taste but also with the appearance.  Great pie!!!

This was so unbelievably easy to make & produced such a delicious key lime pie!  I first made it in August for my mother-in-law's visit & wasn't sure how the recipe was going to turn out.  But it came out wonderfully & my mother-in-law could not stop raving about it!  I had to print her a copy of this recipe before she left for the airport, & I have also emailed it to my sister-in-law upon her mom's request that she try this recipe.  It has the perfect amount of richness & tartness for us (a small sliver goes a long way).  The whipped cream topping was a beautiful touch!  I used a Keebler reduced fat graham cracker crust & altered the recipe according to another reviewer's suggestions.  I used 4 egg yolks, 2 (14 oz) cans of sweetened condensed milk, & 1 cup of bottled key lime juice.  i had to bake for 20-25 minutes instead of just 15 minutes.  We found out that it also tastes best when refrigerated for at least several hours.  Hope you enjoy this pie as much as my family & I did!

As written, a four star recipe--with the modifications I made, five star. First, I thought this pie deserved a homemade graham cracker crust, which I baked first, then cooled. Thinking this would be a little too eggy with 5 yolks, I used only four--perfect. I also knew the custard could stand a little more tartness, so I added 1-1/2 tsp. of grated lime zest to the filling. Perfect.  I baked it at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, then when cooled, topped the pie with 1 cup of sweetened whipped cream. Light and refreshing citrus-y pie, and the perfect complement to a spicy Mexican meal.

Great recipe!  It was a little more tart than I like, but that can be fixed by adjusting some of your measurements.  I use the following: 3/4 c. key lime juice (Nelly & Joe's brand), 2 cans sweetened condensed milk, and 4 egg yolks.  It comes out perfect EVERY time, and people constantly ask for the recipe.  Trust me... these measurements are the way to go.  I've made it this way probably 20 times at least!!!  You can also easily cut back on fat and calories by using lowfat sweetened condensed milk -- you will never know the difference.

Excellent pie.  We recommend using 1 cup lime juice, 4 yolks & 2 cans of condensed milk to fill the pie crust.  Couldn't ask for an easier, quicker, tastier key lime recipe.

For those of you like me...born without common sense.  Thoroughly mix the condensed milk and the lime juice. IN A SEPARATE BOWL...beat the egg yolks until smooth. Take a tbsp of the condensed milk and mix it into the eggs. When combined add another couple spoonfulls to the eggs. Now that your egg mix is no longer bright yellow add it to the big bowl of milk and lime juice...This is what people mean by tempering. If you just dump it all into a bowl together...you get really creamy filling with scrambled egg bits. Lime and egg DO NOT MIX ALONE. The citric acid will "cook" the eggs. Other than that this is a really good recipe:)

After reading the recipe and several of the reviews, I made an adjustment of my own that turned out great. Instead of the yolks, I used 4 whites and two cans of fat-free cond. sweetened milk. It was light, tasted great and even the health-nuts loved it!

This pie is so divinely good! I used all 5 egg yolks, and about a can and a half of sweetened condensed milk. I also increased the amount of lime juice to about 2/3s of a cup - these proportions gave it the perfect amount of sweet-tart flavor for my tastes. I also added the zest of 3 key limes for extra flavor, and 2 small drops of green food coloring for a very light lime color. While I usually prefer whipped cream, I topped it with whipped topping, because that is what my boyfriend's family prefers, (I had cooked dinner for them.) and I think it works better with the rich filling than heavy cream would. Light cream would probably be just as good. Everyone loved this pie... its easy, quick, and delicious. What more could you want?

This was the best... and so easy! I whipped this up for Christmas, and there were no leftovers! It's a must try! I followed the recommendations of 4 yolks, 2 cans of condensed milk, and 1 C lime juice... baked for 25 min with my own crust.

I've tried different versions of this recipe, but most are non-bake and don't come out. This one came out perfect. Tangy with a smooth texture. If you prefer a lighter, less custardy texture, whip the egg whites and fold into the milk/egg/juice mixture. Then, bake for 30 minutes at 250 degrees (yes, 250). It will have a very mousse-like texture. I used this technique after reading another key lime pie recipe and taking the best of it and adding it to this recipe. I like both the original recipe here AND the lighter, mousse-like version. Wonderful fresh lime flavor in both.

I have made this no less than 50 times and it is my most requested recipe!  I also use 4 yolks, 1 cup of lime juice (fresh, bottled...sometimes 1/2 lemon, 1/2 lime, you CAN'T go wrong) and 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, regular or low fat.  For the crust I make my own and I think this is the "secret" that makes it a favorite.  I put one sleeve of graham crakers (= 1 cup when crushed), 3T sugar, 1t ground ginger and about 1/4 c of coconut, toasted or regular (both work well) in food processor.  Combine until graham crackers are fine.  If you want more coconut, throw a little more in, but leave as flakes, makes a nice texture for the crust.  Mix with 5T of melted butter, press into pie dish or springform and bake for 8-10 mins @ 375.  Okay, this may sound crazy, but I promise it works.  When I have made dinners for other families, but am rushed on time, I have made two regular crusts and divided the pie filling to make two pies.  It truly works!  Yes, the pies will be a little less "tall", but it is still great and for those watching their calories, you will have fewer, but still get to have dessert :)

Yes, this is the one you want to make. Yes, that's why there's over 100 reviews for this 1 recipe - it's that good (+ easy)!
I love key lime pie and got my hands on some key lime juice (finally!). I had never made one myself before but this recipe is great - easy, idiot proof, and tastes great. Everyone loved it and the pie was totally finished.
I used a vanilla-wafer crust instead of a graham-cracker one. I thought that flavor crust would work better (vanilla-lime-cream flavors all in 1 pie).  Just for prosperity here's my crust: 30 vanilla wafer cookies, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2-3 tablespoons of butter. In food processer, blend cookes to small crumbs then add sugar + butter. Press into greased pie pan. Add key-lime-pie mix + bake. Anyhow - Loved this recipe. THANKS!

I don't understand why everyone's trying to change this recipe... if done right, it's good like it is. I made this recipe with the ingredients as written, and it came out great (only I added 3 drops of green food coloring) I used 1/2 c. Nellie and Joe's Key West Lime Juice, 1 can sweetened condensed milk, and 5 egg yolks. For the crust, I used Keebler Shortbread crust instead of graham (I like it better, it tastes like butter cookies). I tempered the eggs, meaning I mixed the juice and condensed milk together in one bowl, beat the egg yolks in a seperate bowl, and gradually mixed the milk mixture, one tbs. at a time, into the egg mixture. I think the custard comes better like this, it comes out a weird texture if you just dump it all into a bowl and mix at once, because the eggs and citric acid in the lime juice don't really jive well. Must be combined slowly. That's the key. I baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Chilled overnight. Came out perfect, smooth and creamy, not eggy at all, bursting with flavor, not too strong, not too tangy, not too sweet,  just right.. needs no alterations at all. This ones a keeper. Thank you Dinner2 for a great recipe!

I feel as if perhaps I have done something wrong with this recipe, because my family all hated it. We are big key lime pie fans, and used authentic key lime juice. The pie was extremely dense, like a very dense cheesecake. All of the KLP we have had in Florida (including very recently) has been smooth, creamy, and sometimes even very light as if whipped cream had been added. We've had some of the best in Florida. This was a huge disappointment.

For those who can't find key lime juice, it's almost always in the mixed-drink section of the alcohol aisle in your grocery store (if you live in a state where you can purchase alcohol in a grocery store).  It's by the margarita salts, grenadine, martini accessories, bottle openers... usually the brand is "Nellie & Joe's Key West Lime Juice."  By the way, this is a great pie recipe.  I did it with 4 yolks, 2 cans condensed milk, and 1 cup key lime juice.

The first time I made this I accidentally put four WHOLE eggs in. I was really worried it wouldn't taste good but it still turned out delicious! Oh, and I also used regular lime juice instead of key limes. So then I was curious how much difference there really was in flavor and texture if I were to do it the correct way. So I made two pies at the same time- one with 4 egg yolks and 1/2 cup of key lime juice squeezed directly from about 20 little key limes (very time consuming-ha!) and the other pie I used two whole eggs (as suggested by other reviews when substituting for just yolks) and regular lime juice. the latter turned out just as good as my original (I think whether you use 2 eggs or 4 it's still good) and with a mild lime taste...and the actual key lime pie made just with yolks.....was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I didn't think there could be that much of a difference but there really is! It was 100 % better than the other one in my opinion. Much more tart and bursting with flavor. I guess the regular lime pie would be better for someone who likes more mild flavoring. But there you go. That's the difference and it is a BIG one.

3 stars without modifications, 5 stars with. These are great as mini KLP.  Using a mini muffin pan w liners, use a mini nilla wafer for 'crust', fill to edge of liner (unless you want to put whipped topping after cooled, then only 2/3), and bake for 8 or 9 minutes (depending on your oven).

I made my own homemade graham cracker crust and I added two teaspoons of grated lime zest. 350* for ten minutes was just right. This is almost a five, but I think it needs the lime zest to give it that extra oomph. My kids and I especially liked this. NOTE: For those who thought this was really tart, my advice is to make this quite a few hours before you want to serve it. The longer it sets, in my opinion, the better it gets. It mellows and really gets good. If you can get it to last that long, that is. ;)

Ohhh Pat, your're my new best friend.  This pie is EXCELLENT!! My 4 year old son loves Key Lime Pie. Absolutely no modifications needed.  I guess for those who like it really tart, you could up the amount of lime juice, but it tastes great as is.  I once made this and accidentally used the egg whites along with the yolks and it still turned out great!!  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

This pie was delicious!!! Don't change a thing! In fact I have a new pet peeve.. Rate the recipe as is!!! If you are rating based on your own modifications please stop! I appreciate feed back such as "this was too soft so I might try to modify the recipe " but if you thought the original recipe needed help rate accordingly.

I always get compliments on this recipe!I actually do these as tarts in individual cupcake holders(bake time is a little less) and garnish them with whipped cream and a raspberry or lime slice.They freeze really well-great for unexpected company or for when you want just a little dessert(or snack!!!)

Have you ever taken a bite of something that is so delicious it makes your eyes close and you hear this mmmmmm noise coming from your own mouth?  After altering this recipe as others suggested, I was doing those things!  And I'm not the only one, I noticed our friends that we shared this pie with, doing the exact same thing!  I used 1 c. of fresh key lime juice (it took a lot, like 30 key limes...but it was worth it!), 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, and 4 egg yolks.  I let it bake about 30 minutes and served it with freshly whipped cream.  HOLY COW!  Yum!  I just ate the last piece for breakfast this morning and I am already craving more!

I find that 4 egg yolks was plenty and didn't impart an overpowering egg-yolk flavor.  Even with 4 yolks, it was still super thick, sillky and creamy.  
I baked at 350 for 15 min.  Perfect.

Simply delicious. Being a resident of Savannah, GA, this tastes very authentic. If you use a premade graham cracker crust though, I'd add 50% more sweetened condensed milk. If you want a true, Southern key lime pie, DO NOT ADD GREEN FOOD COLORING. True Key Lime Pie is a whitish shade, not green at all. This is as good as any from fine Southern restaurants: tart and custardy. Enjoy!

Great super easy to make pie, I had the whole thing done and chilling in under 30 minutes. One thing, I would suggest using 4 yolks instead of 5, it is just too eggy in flavor with 5.

My husband thought these were fantastic. I actually got the premade graham cracker crusts in tartlet size...this recipe was enough for 12 of them - put them on a baking sheet, baked for 23 minutes and then topped with homemade whipping cream sprinkled with a little sugared lime zest (zested 2 limes into a bowl and mixed with a couple teaspoons of sugar and a quick squirt of a fresh lime wedge)

Wonderful, classic dessert, inspiring comments from this seasoned lemon and lime meringue pie baker:  I hope "prepared"  doesn't mean the graham cracker pie crust already in the pan, purchased from the store, ready to bake. Nabisco's original graham crackers have reappeared on grocery shelves after several years' absence and are easy to transform into a crust. Small crumbs are a snap when using rolling pin  to smash and roll over the crackers while still in their waxed wrappings. To the crushed graham crackers, add just a little melted butter and sugar, to taste -- not much is needed, just enough to hold crumbs together in the pan. Spread moistened crumbs around the pan and press another pan the same or smaller size onto the crumbs for even thickness, but this step isn't necessary.   The crust, if it makes it to the oven (try not to  eat the crust right out of the pan before it's baked) is truly worth the tiny bit of extra effort. You won't go back to store-bought.This recipe is similar, but simpler, than the classic lemon meringue pie recipe found on the condensed milk can label, which I've been using since I was 11. But for those who love the sourness of lemon or lime meringue pies, finely grate some lime peel and perhaps also touch of lemon peel and a tiny bit of lemon extract to the lime pie.

easy, excellent.  Make sure to add the milk before the lime juice, otherwise it denatures the protein in the egg and you get lumps.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed. I was going to change it the way many have, but squeezing the key limes would have been even more time consuming. I'm so glad I didn't alter anything cuz it's PERFECTION! I can't see why anyone would dislike, maybe they did not use actual "key limes." I had to go to another market to find the real deal. Oh, and be sure to use fresh juice - I'm sure it makes a big difference. Thank you, Pat. A+++++++++

YUMMY!!! Light lime flavor and very creamy.
I used the variations suggested by other users- 4 egg yolks, 2 cans sweetened condensed milk and 1C lime juice.

I could see right away that the original recipe would not make enough to fill crust so I used the suggestions given by others to increase the milk and lime juice, WOW this was too sweet.  Maybe it would be best to cut back on the sweetened milk some and not use two full cans. I could barely taste the tartness of the lime. My boyfriend liked it, my sister agreed with me, too sweet!!!

The best Key Lime pie I had ever had was in Key West and it had a ginger crust, so the only thing I did differently was to add 1 teaspoon ground ginger to the crust. I have gotten many rave reviews on this pie. EXCELLENT!

I added 1 1/2 tsp. grated lime zest to give it a bit more zing.  It set up quite well after I cooled it on a rack for 2 hours, then refrigerated overnight.  Excellent flavor and texture.

I have vacationed in the Florida Keys (Marathon) every year for the last 14 years, and love to eat blackened mahi mahi sandwiches and authentic Key Lime Pie at the world famous 7 mile grill while I'm down there.  I have to say that this recipie is excellent!  I have made this pie at least 5 times now, and toured it around several partys.  This recipie gets tons of compliments!  If you use regular limes, increase the amount of lime juice to 3/4 cup and I also cut the egg yokes down to 4 instead of 5 as other reviewers had suggested.  Oh, and I bake for 20 minutes instead of 15.

I was skeptical about this recipe as it only has three ingredients, not including the crust.  I decided to make it anyway, and was amazed at the piece of velvet heaven that came out of my oven!  This is a keeper.  I will be making this for potlucks and family gatherings, holidays, etc.  It is SO easy and SO delicious.  I made it two days ago and there is only one piece left with three of us in the house!

I did my own crust by combining graham crackers and Nilla wafers with a small amount of sugar (I don't measure I just toss it all in a ziplock bag and roll over with a rolling pin to crush everything.) Had to make only one substitution. I added a little lemon juice to the lime juice as I didn't quite have enough. This gets 5+ stars for flavor. The texture, for me, could have been firmer. Like some of the commercial key lime pies I've had. My family disagreed. They loved it as it was. I will make this again with some of the changes others have mentioned. Thanks!

Absolutely perfect.  I doubled the filling recipe, added the zest of one lime, used a 10 inch spring form pan, used a pastry bag and tip and covered the top with whipped topping stars, garnished the edges with lime slices, it was BEAUTIFUL.  Brought it to my husbands work for a birthday, he said it was literally gone in minutes.  People said it was the best key lime pie they've ever had.

After making this pie quite a few times and using different variations I've found the right balance.  I only use 3-4 yolks (I don't like the eggy taste that some key lime pies can leave) and 1 and 1/2 cans of sweetened condensed milk.  I kept the lime juice at 1/2 cup!  Perfect.  Great recipe!

Four ingredients and done. 15 minutes to bake. This is a great pie for moms that need dessert for a kid banquet or something. I keep coming back to this one for emergency pies. I whip it up while making dinner. Put it in the frig when I'm cleaning up and I have it to grab the next night without the stress of finding something to buy on the way home before the event.

It was simple. I combined the eggs yolks and condensed milk before adding the Famous Key West Lime Juice just until combined. Next time I will use about 2 TBspoons less it was a bit on the tart side. I will double the recipe for a thicker pie, I used a 9 inch pie pan and it came out a little to half of what the picture shows. Other wise I think it was great.

I too adjusted the recipie after reading many comments.  4 Egg yolks.  @ cans of sweetened condensed milk.  I couldn't find key lime juice so I used 1/3 C lemon juice and 2/3 C Lime Juice.  I also used a little lime zest inside the pie filling as well over the top of the pie.  To be fancy, I melted some dark chocolate and used a fork to scatter over the top (loading picture).  THIS WAS DELICIOUS and SUPER SUPER easy!  Will be making again...

UPDATE : i Did make again and this time found key lime juice.  Added a tsp vanilla too.. Don't know if the van made a diff... But the juice did.  I love it even more!!!!!!!!!

I always read other's reviews...but 95% of the time when trying a new recipe, I follow the author's directions exactly as written. And I'm so glad I did. It is absolutely perfect and delicious as written. No less or extra of anything is necessary. It's deliciously tart and has perfect texture. My Floridian husband says it tastes just like home! :-)

I've made this pie twice-first time I used 10oz(300ml)of condensed milk, the second time I used 14oz. I liked it better the first time. Both times I cooked at 375 for 20 mins, let cool on a wire rack, and chilled overnight. Heaven...so easy, everyone loves it!

Excellent.  I used this with only four egg yolks and a full cup of Lime Juice.  It filled a 9 inch pie plate perfectly and was firm and perfect.  The color was also perfect as I dont like it colored green.  I also put ground up graham crackers on the top after it cooled and it gave it an added taste.  Easiest key lime I ever made.

I'm not a novice cook,but something definitely went wrong with this pie. I followed the recipe exactly, but when I took it out of the oven it was runny. I thought it would thicken after it cooled so put it in the refrigerator, but it didn't (I was actually making 6 pies and all were like this.) I didn't want to throw out 6 pies so put them back into the oven until thickened which was about 30 minutes. They tasted good but didn't look good. I used more whipped cream and garnish to hide the defects. I served 30 people and most every one liked them, didn't know they were supposed to be key lime pies. When asked what it was I said, "It is uh-oh pie, which I think is am accurate description. Does anyone have an idea as to what went wrong.

I've had lots of Key Lime Pie in my day & this was perfect! I do like my pies just a little more tart than others so I put in 1 cup of fresh squeezed lime juice + the fine grate of the peel from 2 limes, 2 cans sweetened condensed milk & 5 eggs & put it in a homemade flaky crust in an oval shaped dish because the 9" graham crust is to small. We topped it with a spoonful of coolwhip & it was delicious!

Bitter without much lime flavor. I had to add a lot of grated lime zest to get more flavor, but I should have added some sugar too, because this wasn't sweet enough. It also didn't set very well. I baked it for twice as long as it called for and it was still a bit runny.
Since I had 5 extra egg whites after making it, I decided to make a meringue by beating the egg whites with 1 1/3 tsp cream of tartar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and half cup of sugar. Then I put the meringue on top of the pie as soon as it came out of the oven, then baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. The meringue adds a lot!

I have a key lime tree in my yard so I have made this pie well over 60 times.  This recipe deserves 7 stars.  It is always the biggest hit.

I love this recipe as alerted by the reviewers using 2 cans of condensed milk, a cup of lime juice and 5 egg yolks.  The only change I make is to beat the egg whites to soft peaks and fold them into the mixture of other ingredients.  It makes for a lighter pie.  And why waste the whites!!!

I made this two ways. One with 4 eggs yolks and one can of sweetened condensed milk and about 3/4 cup of key lime juice. Then I made it with 4 eggs yolks, 2 cans of condensed milk about 1 cup of key lime juice. Both are wonderful and it really is a matter if you like it sweet or more tart. I did cook mine at 350 and a little longer. I also made my own crust. According to my husband, the pies were equally wonderful. I garnished with whipped cream.

This was a delicious key lime pie with a nice lime flavor, sweet and rich.  I used fresh squeezed limes and followed the original recipe, rather than doubling it as other reviewers did.  Therefore I used a smaller store bought graham cracker pie crust.  I used the 5 egg whites to make a meringue topping, baking 10 minutes without the merinque(to cook the filling) and another 10 minutes with the meringue topping.  The meringue topping made the pie look beautiful as well as taste great.  I'll definitely make this pie again when I have a group to bake for.

I've never made key-lime pie before but this one was so easy and came out great!  It almost tasted like The Cheesecake Factory's Key Lime Cheese Cake.  I put a dollop of whipped cream on top and my guest and fiance loved it!  I followed the reviewers recipes and used two cans of condensed milk.  I couldn't find key lime juice so I squeezed 5 fresh lemons, 7 fresh limes, and 5 key limes (the little limes) which was exactly one cup of juice, and used that instead.    I did make my own crust.  It is an awesome crust and so simple.  Its the same crust I use on my cheesecake.  Buy cinnamon honey graham crackers and crush up two of the packages that come inside the box (not two boxes) into crumbs.  Add 2/3 cup white sugar and 1 cup melted butter.  Stir it well.  You should be able to press this into a pie or cheesecake pan.  Make sure if you use a cheesecake pan you put another pan under it in the oven to catch any dripping butter.

I am from Florida & this is the recipe I always use, keep in mind that the juice from the key limes can be different even from year to year from the same tree.  I recommend putting in less juice, taste the batter & then add more juice to taste.  This year I needed 8 Tbsp, the limes were not as tart.

Absolutely delicious!!  And yes, it's better the second day.  4 eggs, 2 cans of condensed milk, 1/2 cup each of lime juice and lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of lime zest and baked for 25 minutes.  Perfect!!

YUM YUM YUM!!!!  I followed the recommendation to use a garlic press on the Key Limes which was fabulous!  It was much easier than trying to squeeze them.

Not bad but you can't get key limes where I live, I should have used 3/4 cup of regular lime juice instead of the 1/2 cup I used! as key limes are more acidic and have more flavour. Be careful using the bottled key lime juice, most of it is just key west, lime juice which isn't quaranteed to be key lime juice, from key west!!! if you know what I mean, manufactured in key west could be with the regular limes not key limes. People can write what they want on the ingredients so unless you can get fresh key limes just use regular but more.

I've made this recipe around 5 times already for several summer parties. It couldn't be easier. I did, however, have difficulty filling the crust with the given amounts. I used 7 eggs, 1.5 cans of sweetened condensed milk, and 3/4 cup of the Key Lime Juice. I also added 4 drops of green food coloring for appearance. It has been devoured each time - fantastic recipe! Easily one of my favorite!

Great recipe.  Made it the first time and thought I would "improve" on it by adding a little lime zest.  Big mistake, very bitter.  Who knew that you aren't supposed to zest key limes?  Made it the second time and stuck to the recipe.  Duh?  Perfect.  A couple of comments . . . key lime pie is not green.  Unless you add red food coloring to your apple pie, don't add green to key lime.  Second, the room in the pie shell is for the topping, traditionally meringue and in this recipe whipped cream or whipped topping.  If you didn't have a topping, it would be extremely tart.  This recipe is "easy" because it uses a prepared crust and doesn't require "fresh" lime juice, not because it has only three ingredients.  "Authentic" key lime pie filling is made of egg yolks (the whites are used for the meringue), sweetened condensed milk, and lime juice.  I have used fresh juice--that takes care of quick--and it takes about 16-18 key limes for 1/2 cup juice.  I have also made this once using fat-free condensed milk and 3/4 cup Egg Beaters.  It worked great.  Thanks, Pat.

This was delicious! My neighbor brought over a whole bag of key limes so I squeezed them to make about 6 pies. This makes a huge difference in the taste, rather than using key lime juice, but it will work just as well. This is so simple and so delish! Everyone loved it and said it was better than store bought or from a restaurant. I used a store bought graham cracker crust but sprinkled the bottoms of them with crushed toasted pecans before adding the filling. YUM! This is a winner! I found that after 15 minutes it was still a bit "wiggly" so I left it in for a total of about 17 minutes. Perfect! A chocolate crust would be tasty, too.

a yummy key lime pie!! i took the other reviewer's suggestions of 1 cup key lime juice, 2 cans evaporated, and 4 egg yolks to fill up the pie. however, me and my family found out that we like it better with whipped cream on top to balance out the very sweet and very tangy pie. so next time i'll just follow the recipe and then have a layer of whipped cream on top to fill in the crust.

This seemed to easy to be good, but it worked out great.  I added an extra squirt of lime juice because another reviewer said it wasn't tart enough, and it was quite tart - just like we like it.  Next time, I'm going to add a little green food coloring to it.  It also seemed like it could have filled my pie crust better, so I may up the filling recipe for the next time.

Everyone loved this!  The first time I made it, I used bottled key lime juice and the second time I used real key limes.  Both turned out great, but using real key limes gives it quite a kick.  Depending on your tastes, you might want to use less real lime juice or a little more condensed milk.  Wonderful recipe!

Went to a local restaraunt and had some very excellent, very expensive, homemade key lime pie. Since I enjoyed it so much I thought I try making it. When I saw this recipe, I thought it was to easy to be anywhere as good as the pie I had at the restaraunt. Opps!! I was wrong, it was great. Now my whole family can enjoy the pie. Thanks so much.

I made the suggested modified version (2 cans sweetened condensed milk - low fat, 1 cup lemon/lime juice, 4 egg yolks) and baked in a 9" pre-made graham cracker crust. I had about 1/2 cup leftover filling which I MAYBE could have added to the pie, but I think a larger pie crust would work best for next time. This is SOO delicious and the texture is absolutely PERFECT!

A phenomenal key lime pie that was so easy to make.  Unlike many of the other reviewers, I followed the recipe exactly.  If you are using an actual 9 inch pie plate, the recipe is perfect.  I can see how if you were using a 10 inch plate you might want to double it, as the other reviewers have noted.  I also made a homemade graham cracker cruts.  I was able to find bottled key lime juice in the grocery store and I think that was the key to it tasting so great.  I might also try it with the fat free sweentened condensed milk next time.    I will definitely be making this again and again.

Very good pie. Rivals the key lime from a pie shop that delivers pie to many restaurants in the Tampabay area. Used Nelly and Joe's key lime juice--3/4 cup, 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, and 4 egg yolks. Topped it with piped whipped cream: 1 cup heavy whipping cream, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 to 2 Tbsp granulated sugar. Chill everything, including bowl and hand mixer for 30 minutes before whipping the cream. I was very impressed with the outcome. This recipe is a star!

Folks, This is the first review I have written.  I have been a been a member for a couple years.  Follow this recipe exactly.  I did Juice my own Key limes as Kroger in my area does not have Key lime juice but did have fresh Key limes...  One bag made the 1/2 cup juice...  Probably the easiest pie I have made ever that was not out of a box...  It is great... Kroger brand cool whip is soy free btw...  This is great...  One note my oven cooks low,  I cooked 18 minutes but tap the side of the pie if it does not wiggle it is done.

Tart and tasty... great pie for the sunny spring day we have today! I chose to make my own graham cracker crust --which I parbaked--and threw in the zest of my limes (approx 1T). I was reading other recipes and decided to use just 4 yolks and was happy with the results. Topped with some freshly whipped cream to even out the tart, puckery flavor, this pie was perfect!

I've always wanted to try Key Lime Pie and this is certainly the easiest recipe I've ever run across.

The taste was great, except ... 

Juicing key limes is extremely labor-intensive for the end result;

We felt the graham cracker crust overpowered the flavor of the filling.

But, at least, I can say I've now made a key lime pie.

This was so good and easy too!  Based on some of the other reviews I used 4 eggs instead of 5.  I also couldn't find Key Lime Juice at my grocery store so I used Rose's Lime Juice (near all the margarita mixes).  It was delicious and I'll definitely be making it again!

I needed a quick easy dessert for a gathering, and this was perfect!  I did not have Key Limes or even Key Lime Juice. I used the previous suggestions of 1/4 cup Lemon Juice and 1/4 cup Lime Juice.  I did not want an actual pie, because I needed a "finger" dessert - so using a gravy ladel, I put the filling into the individual Phyllo dough Mini Shells, and baked for 15 minutes.  Then after they cooled in the refrigerator I piped a simple cream cheese/butter/powdered sugar icing onto them.  What a hit!  (I did add a few drops of green food coloring to make it appear more green)

Terrific recipe! I substituted 1/2 regular lime juice and 1/2 lemon juice for the key lime juice, since I had none available. I also added a couple of drops of green food coloring and it turned out great! I really liked the tartness of the filling.  My only caution is to watch the oven closely near the end of the prescribed baking period as a graham cracker crust can go from okay to burnt very quickly!

I tried this with 4 yolks and with 5. It was more velvety with 5. Make sure you bake it for at least 15 minutes. Definitely a keeper. Rave Reviews and it only took 5 minutes and one bowl.

This recipe is a keeper. The only thing that is hard is sqeezing a whole bundle of key limes. If you are sqeezing your key limes I would recommend rolling them on the counter to soften them up first. I followed another review. I only used 5 yolks,1 1/2 cans of evaporated milk, and 3/4 cup of key lime juice. It hard the perfect tartness to it.

I made 2 pies. The first I followed the directions exactly.  The second I cooked  an extra 5 minutes and chilled it overnight.  I found the recipe very quick & easy and delicious.  The second pie had a better texture & was more firm having cooked it and refrigerated it longer.  I also made my own crust.  Very tasty.

Delicous and easy, although my crust was a bit over-done and brittle, I timed to exactly 15 minutes.  Next time I will bake at 350 degrees.  I used "Nellie and Joes Key West Key Lime Juice".  Delicious.  I find this at my Krogers in the beer/wine department near the mixers, not in the juice isle where you would think it would be.  The recipe for Key Lime Pie on the label is almost identical, except uses only 3 egg yolks and bakes at 350,  Food for thought.

Very good and easy.  I have made key lime pie before, but sometimes it would be runny so I wanted to try this version (the other recipe I made before was the same except for not baked at all).   I read on another review that you should mix the yolks and condensed milk, well, but then add the lime juice just until blended- overmixing can prevent the pie from setting up.  I baked it as directed and it turned out perfect.  As for some complaints that it was not alot of filling, this is how I have always had it.  It is such a dense pie in that you don't need alot of filling, especially when topped with freshly sweetened whipped cream.  Next time I will whip the left over egg whites with a little sugar, and top the pie with that instead of the whipped cream.  I have had it like that before and that is good also.

This was definitely the easiest pie I have ever made and it was delicious.  I used 4 egg yolks instead of 5.  I had a tough time getting used to the colour since I am used to key lime pie being green.  Maybe next time I will add green food colouring to it like other reviewers have suggested.

I couldn't get key lime juice so I used a 1/2 cup mixture of mostly freshly squeezed lime and just a bit of freshly squeezed lemon. (I botched up the suggested 1/2-1/2 lime-lemon suggestion below). But it was very tart anyway.  Right after it cooled down, I tried a piece.  It was too tart.  But after 1 day in the fridge, it was divine. The keebler prepared graham crust was perfect, the amount of filling and texture were perfect. My husband and I loved it!  Thanks for this simple recipe.  I'm going to make this for many potlucks and holidays to come!!

I visit the Keys every other year and to me, this is the most authentic recipe on Key Lime Pie that I'd tried yet.  Excellent flavor, yet not to tart.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this pie for my family today and it was delicious as stated by many other reviewers. My 5 yr old granddaughter who won't try much of anything new enjoyed it. I was confused somewhat by the multitude of suggested "improvements" to the recipe. I followed the recipe as written and it was delicious.  I will certainly make this pie again exactly as it is written.

For some reason, I was too intimidated to make a key lime pie before. All the recipes I looked at before were too complicated and time consuming.  I found this recipe to be so simple to follow, resulting in a delicious dessert. Key lime is my favorite pie and homemade tastes way better than store bought. In a week, I made three of these pies! Friends were begging me for the recipe.  Thanks, allrecipes.com!

This pie is so deeeelicious, its almost indecent! I want to give everyone a hint, I live in CA and the only place I know that grows key limes is FLA.  I use bottled Key Lime juice and zest a regular Persian lime, about 1 and half teaspoons zest, oh and be sure to use 'large' eggs.  The key lime juice I used is carried by King Arthur Flour and I think it makes the pie taste better than regular limes.

Wowie this is good!!! I'm eating it as I type! And it was so easy! I took other's advise and doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did b/c it made a nice full 9 inch pie. 4 egg whites, 2 cans sweet cond milk, and 1 cup lime juice. I just realized that I accidentally used egg whites instead of yolks. That was an honest mistake, I wasn't even trying to do that to make it healthier..I just read "yokes" and for some reason thought of whites. Well, using 4 egg whites apparently didn't hurt anything. It made it very delicious and alot healthier! Yummy!!!!

This is my favorite key lime pie recipe. Squeezing three to four limes is enough for the juice; I rarely add the zest, and it's still "limey" enough. I also make my own graham cracker crust - it's a MUST for good pie and easy too.

I made this pie as written and I did not care for it. Key lime is my favorite kind of pie, so I thought I would give it a try for Easter.  It was SO tart and limey tasting, that no one could or would eat it. I ended up cooking a pre-made dessert from the freezer. So disappointing.

I use this recipe all the time.  It is easy, tasty and gets lots of great compliments.  I do it exactly as listed and it turns out great every time.  I will warn new bakers to always test for doneness every time you do make a pie as cooking times do vary.

I completely agree with naples34102's modifications to remove one egg and add about 1 1/2 tsp. of key lime zest to each pie. I actually took this a step further, substituting two of the yolks for egg whites to cut down the number of calories. The results were delicious. Next time, I'm also considering cutting one of the cans of sweetened condensed milk in favor of evaporated. We'll see how that goes.

SIMPLY AMAZING with a few changes. As others suggested, I used 4 egg yolks and 2 cans of low-fat sweetened condensed milk. My key limes produced 3/4c of juice, which turned out to be the perfect amount of tangy vs sweet for my tastes. I live a couple hours from the FL Keys and the critics here are extra tough, but they raved about this pie! My husband, who is not a dessert fan, even complained there wasn't any left to take home!! This one's a keeper! Thanks!

I've made this twice now....sooo yummy! My hubby loves it, and he's the key lime pie expert! Thanks for sharing such an easy recipe! I'm not sure now where I read this, but I've been taking the advice of a fellow reader to juice the limes in a garlic press. With some of the smaller limes, I just cut them in half so they can fit. If they are larger, I quarter them. It makes juicing them so easy...just make sure you point the juicer way down in a large bowl or it will squirt everywhere! Thanks again for a "real" tasting key lime pie!

This pie is sooo easy and soooo good. I get requests for the recipe all the time and make it for every bake sale, by request. By itself it is a four star recipe, but with  a couple of small adjustments based on the reviews here, it is a defnitely five star hit!   First, I only use four egg yolks, 2 cans of the sweetened condensed milk, and 3/4 cup of key lime juice. I did add about 2 tbsp of key lime zest to the mixture, and it turned out fantastic!!

This was really good but really rich!  Don't do what I did: squeeze fresh key limes for the juice!  Buy a jar of key lime juice at your local grocery store.  My hand almost fell off after squeezing 20+ key limes.

This is a great recipe for key lime pie lovers who like the pie very tart and crisp.  For a sweeter pie, I would adjust as the other reviewers have mentioned.  The modification that has worked the best for me is 4 yolks, 2 cans condensed milk, and 1 cup lime juice.

I just discovered how quick and easy Key lime pie is this spring and have been making this recipe all summer!  I hate having left over egg whites though so I beat them and fold in to the pie filling.  This makes a wonderful chiffon pie out of this recipe and I don't feel guilty about not comming up with another use for the whites.

I didn't change the recipe at all and topped it with fat free cool whip.  Found it to be tart, delicious, and incredibly easy to create.  Will be making it again.

Wow!Simple and really, really good. I like a bit more tang so I added some lime zest to the mix. Served it at a small party and people wanted to lick the pie pan.

This is for those of you who add food coloring (or other color) to this: When we honeymooned in Key West, our tour guide told us, "Key limes produce pale yellow juice. Key lime pie should be pale yellow, too. If you ever order Key Lime Pie and it's green, send it back and get something chocolate!" Something to think about as you make "authentic" Key Lime Pie! Regardless of color, I know you'll enjoy this yummy pie!!!

WAY BETTER THAN STORE-BOUGHT!!!! This pie was absolutely delicious!!! With the review suggestions (4 egg yolks, 2 cans milk, 1 cup lime juice. bake @ 350 for 20-25 min) it came out PERFECT!!! I LOVE key lime pie but this was my first time trying to make it at home. I will never ever buy it in the stores again. It does come out tart (which I happen to like) so if you want it with less kick, cut back on the lime juice. I did notice that the filling was more yellow than green when I was mixing it so I added some lemon-lime kool-aid to it to get that true lime green color. This also added a little extra punch that I dont think I would have gotten with food coloring. You can kind of tweak the amount you add to your own taste and color preference. I used about 1/3 of a pack- and then used the leftover to make kool-aid with while the pie was baking!!! If you mix the lime juice, milk, and kool-aid together first you can taste and alter it before you add the eggs without worrying about eating the raw yolks. I did not add any whip cream on top until I cut and served it (If you let it sit on the pie in the fridge it will run and be a soggy mess, especially if it is store bought and not homemade whip cream) I also kept mine in the freezer instead of the fridge so that the pie would be firm (and not quite so mushy) Anyway this was incredible and ridiculously easy to make!! TRY IT!!!

SUPER easy and delicious! I couldn't find key lime juice and didn't feel like sqeezing a bunch of them either so used half lemon, half lime juice that come in the little plastic fruit shapped containers and it was still fantastic. This is literally the easiest pie you will ever make. I forgot that most reviewers said to use 4 yolks instead of 5 and I used 5 - don't know what difference 1 less egg yolk would have made or that this pie could have been any better without it. I used a store bought shortbread ready-made crust and it came out just fine. The filling was so smooth, set up beautifully and tasted amazing. I will definitely make this pie again and again. The one thing I did remember to do was double the recipe. Good thing too because a single batch wouln't have filled the pie shell nearly enough. Make and enjoy!!

This is a GREAT recipe for KEY LIME PIE. I highly recommend using the two cans of Sweetened Condensed Milk and the four egg yolks as well. it turns out FANTASTIC! Adding a little bit of light brown sugar to the pie crust will enhance the flavor of the crust a good bit. Forget the white sugar. Enjoy!!

Delicious. I only gave it four stars b/c like the other reviewers I changed the recipe, so it wasn't the "real recipe." I made the pie with 4 yolks, 2 cans condensed milk, 1/2c fresh lime juice, 1/2c fresh lemon juice, 1tsp grated lime rind, in a pre-made graham cracker crust - baked for 25minutes. It was easy and delicious - not too tart, not too bland. I almost ate two huge pieces in one sitting!

This was an excellent recipe!  Since I've never made this before, I checked the reviews and decided to go with the 4 eggs, 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk.  I didn't have any keylimes, so I used half liquid lime juice and half liquid lemon juice.  We found that the pie tasted better after letting it sit in the fridge all night.  We had tried a small piece shortly after I made it, and it tasted like the sweetened milk. I would definately recomend waiting over night before serving it.

I made this recipe without any alterations.  It set well and was pretty good but it didn't seem tart enough.  I think I might try it again with some of the suggestions made by others, mainly increasing the amount of lime juice.

I never knew I liked key lime pie until I made my own. This is super easy and oh so good! I made my own graham cracker crust, topped it off with homemade whipped cream and it was excellent. I had to cook it longer than the stated time but it was well worth it. Very simple and tastes like you slaved in the kitchen all day. My husband and neighbors loved it. Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic. Easy. I used the recomendations from other users. On top of that,  I made my own meringue topping: (Use stand up mixer or very strong hand mixer,  high power!) beat the 4 egg whites until frothy. Gradually add 1 cup sugar, beat until stiff peaks form. I cooked the key lime pie for 15 minutes, took it out to spoon the meringue on top, and returned into oven immediately, baking the pie for the remaining 10-15 minutes.

This recipe is wonderful. Only tip make sure to use either fresh lime juice or an ALL NATURAL bottled one. Others have to much citric acid which is why it becomes so tart. I LOVE IT thanks

After reading the many positive reviews of this pie I gave it a try.  I wanted to find a style of key lime filling that was more dense/solid.  Even though this pie is more custard-like it was absolutely terrific and easily matches the very best key lime pies I've ever tasted...and I LOVE key lime pie.  Its level of tartness is perfect for my tastes.

The preparation was very simple.  I followed the directions to a tee, (I used key lime juice from a bottle), but I would have added two directions that may seem obvious to most...1) make sure to allow the pie to cool completely on a wire rack and THEN 2) cool the pie in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.  I would also think about drizzling a little rasberry sauce for occasional dipping and using a high quality whipped cream.

Enjoy!

I made this today for a awards banquet for 120 people and there wasn't a crumb left. I did add some whipped cream cheese to make more like a cheesecake. Everyone thought I worked hours on it little did they know it was only about 15 minutes.

Excellent!  EASY!  Don't hesitate to try this!  I used two cans of evaporated milk, 4 egg yolks and one cup of lime juice (I had to use regular limes) that other reviewers recommended.  I also added the zest of three limes in the pie.  The graham pie crust was the larger 9 oz. and it fit perfectly.  Very rich, but yummy!  I wish I knew how to make a meringue to put on top!

This was great and so easy.  I also used only 4 egg yolks and 2 cans of fat free sweetened cond. milk.  I used 1 cup of fresh lime juice.  It almost overfilled the store bought reduced fat graham cracker crust, so I baked it a little longer to insure the egg yolks reached proper temp.  It set up fine and was wonderful!

My daughter made this.  Super easy and came out perfect.  She used Nellie & Joe's Key West Lime Juice because the key limes were not in season.

My family really like this recipe and I liked how simple it was, but I felt that it lacked the creaminess and smoothness of other key lime pie recipes I have tried.

So easy to make and so delicious! The store did not have any lime juice, so I ended up squeezing limes to make the lime juice. It took about 2 limes to get the 1/2 cup lime juice.

Used the advice of Shrae1 and the tip shared by them as well - didn't have key limes, so used a half cup of juice of 5 lemons and a half cup of juice from 6 limes (wonderful hint).  Added that to the 4 egg yolks and blended well before incorporating 2 cans of Eagle Brand condensed milk.  Had made a no-bake graham cracker crust found on this site, using a handful of butter cookies as part of the crumbs.  My crust was made in my deep dish pie pan, so even with the extra can of condensed milk and double juice, it fit nicely.  Cooked at a preheated 375 for 30 minutes and it came out exactly as we like it!

I made this exactly as written and it is delicious!  Yes, it's tart, but it's a pie made with lime juice.  Don't change a thing!  It does not taste eggy, it is not runny, and it doesn't have to sit overnight to firm up.  In fact, mine was firm to touch as soon as I took it out of the oven.  I cooled it in the freezer for 30 minutes, in the fridge for 30 minutes and served it.  Even my picky teenage boys loved it!

Yumm! Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe. Last thanksgiving I baked this "Key Lime Pie". I was worried about my family and friends reaction when I baked it. Everybody gobbled it and praising me for baking such a tasty Key Lime Pie :) !!
I did add extra lemon Zest and topped the pie with fluffy white frosting. I will definitely bake it again :)

Usually, I follow the directions exactly the first time I make one of these recipes.  However, so many reviewers made these recommendations, that I decided to try it, and they were right.  This pie turned out great.  I used 4 egg yolks, 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, and I used 1 cup key lime juice.  The consistency turned out perfect.

This could not have been easier and is the best key lime pie I've ever had. I made it for my mom's birthday (she's a major key lime pie fan) and she loved it so much that I've since made it many many times over. It's a big hit! 

We used Nellie & Joes Key Lime Juice (don't just use lime juice, it's important to get real key lime juice) and a pre-made Keebler graham cracker crust. The finished pie was sweet with a wonderful tart lime flavor. It has a great natural color (a very pretty light pale green). Once it has cooled, I add whipped cream on top to balance out the tartness. If you bring this to a party I guarantee everyone will be begging for the recipe.

It's difficult to believe how incredible this tastes given that the recipe is so fast and easy!  I made it for a dinner at my parent's house and my mom really thought I bought this from a bakery.  I do find that the recipe doesn't make enough filling... it seems to only come up 2/3 of the way on the pie shell.  I might try making 2 pies next time and tripling the recipe.

Definately throw in the zest from the limes-4 teaspoons is good- the oven releases it's flavor and the result is a more intensely flavored, and prettier green pie (rather than yellowish). Whisk  it into the yolks(4 is plenty), then add the rest of the ingredients and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, which helps the filling begin to thicken before it is even placed in the oven. This is because the lime juice causes the proteins in the yolks and milk to bond together. Definitely try this if you are having problems with a loose or soupy filling, rather than overcooking. Then proceed with the recipe. I have found that if you can't find fresh key limes, Persian limes give a much better taste than bottled juice- citrus flavor diminishes soon after being squeezed and can turn harsh-no matter what kind of citrus juice it is, there is no comparison between bottled and fresh. Add a touch of lemon if you want. Also-a homemade crust is soooo much better than store bought ones, which are made with shortening rather than butter.  After baking the crust a bit, I cook my pie at 325 degrees for 15 minutes. Next time I am going to try a coconut graham cracker crust: 4 tablespoons unsweetened shredded and toasted coconut, 9 whole graham crackers, 2 tablespoons sugar, and 5 tablespoons melted butter. Grind the crackers, coconut, and sugar in the food processor, then poor the melted butter through the feed tube and process, scraping down. Bake 325, 15 min, let cool.

I made this today using fresh key limes from my neighbors backyard.  I didn't make any adjustments. It came out perfectly.  We just had some for dessert after dinner.  My in-laws are visiting and they loved it.  The hardest part about making this pie was squeezing the tiny key limes.  I usually use Nellie and Joe's but since fresh key limes were growing over our fence I decided to use the fresh ones.  To be honest, I didn't taste much of a difference.  But the pie is good and this recipe is perfect just as it is. More filling just means bigger piece of pie and more calories.

I modified this recipe based on the reviews.  I used 2 cans sweetend condensed milk, 4 egg yolks and 1 cup key lime juice.  I baked for 30 minutes @ 350.  Pie did not set up properly and was very tart.  I think it would have been better with 3/4 cup lime juice and at least 5 egg yolks.  This was my first attempt at key lime pie.  Hopefully my next one will turn out better.

This pie is so rich and creamy! 
I didn't have a graham cracker crust so I used the delicious crust from the milk tart recipe on this site. I also only used 4 egg yolks and this pie turned out amazing! It set beautifully :)

Good in a pinch when I wanted to make key lime pie but didn't have sour cream. Made my own graham cracker crust and baked these in individual servings in muffin tins (w/liners)! Baking time was ~10 minutes and then I was able to freeze some for later! VERY good! :)

Very easy and tasted great! Used the alterations advised: 4 egg yolks, 1 and a half cans of sweetened condensed milk, half cup lime and a half cup lemon juice, bake for a bit over 30 minutes. Perfect.

This is great tasting but it does NOT fit in a pie pan like it says.  I followed the directions perfectly and it literally only filled the pan halfway up.  I managed to salvage the filling and poured it into 4 small ramekins.  Great tasting, very rich... but needs more filling to be a pie!

I made this pie with the modifications of 2 14-oz cans sweetened condensed milk, 1 c. fresh squeezed key lime juice (roll them and use a garlic press!), and 4 egg yolks.  I got more juice from the riper key limes (more yellow in color) so it may be worth it to buy them a little ahead.  I found them at my local Harris Teeter.  It was my first time making key lime pie and it came out wonderfully!  I made my own crust using Graham Cracker Crust I recipe from this site.  I also added the zest of a few key limes into the filling for color and a little zing.  Perfect combination of tart and sweet in this pie.

This recipe was so easy to make.  Perfect for cooking with kids.  As other have suggested, I doubled the lime juice and the condensed milk which gave me a full-to-the-rim pie (Great!) but the consistency was not firm enough with just 4 eggs (another reader suggestion).  The flavor is awesome but I'll probably use 5 egg yolks next time, just like the recipe says.

Easy and Delicious. I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and only used 4 eggs, a full cup of juice and 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk. I live in a small town and no one sells key lime juice so I used 7oz of regular lime juice and 1oz of lemon juice. The pie was finished by the end of dinner. Yummy!

WOW!  Delicious pie!  I took the other reviewers' advice and used 2 cans (fat free) sweetened condensed milk, 1 cup key lime juice and 4 egg yolks.  Baked for 25 minutes and it was absolutely perfect!  I topped this off with some fat free cool whip and I would definitely recommend it as it cuts the sweetness a bit.  Great texture and just the right amount of tart.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

This pie is superb! I don't know if any of you have heard of the Historic Jekyll Island Hotel, but I live near it and one of the restaurants there serves almost exactly this same pie! There is one less egg yolk and one less T. of lime juice, but it's almost the same recipe. I recommend making whipped cream topping like they do: 2 cups heavy whipping cream, 3 T. sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla extract blended together and spread on top of the pie to really compliment this delicious recipe! I also make my own graham cracker crust to really set this pie off to another level! Combine 1.5 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup sugar and 5 T. melted butter. Bake at 350 for seven minutes and let cool before filling with lime mixture. YUM!!

I have not tried this recipe yet, however  I use Key West Lime Juice recipe which calls for 3 egg yolks.  5 yolks would probably be too much.  This is one of three pies that I absolutely love to make and gift to my friends.  5 stars    The photo is great!

Excellent version of a Florida classic.  If the only key lime juice you can find is Nelie and Joe's try adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract to cut the tartness a bit.  Key West lime juice isn't always real key lime juice, often it's just very tart Persian lime juice.

This is the Key Lime Pie recipe I have been looking for.  Easy, simple, and out-of-this world tasty!    (Used 4 egg yolks and 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk).

I put in 8 oz cream cheese and loved it - it combines the great taste of Key Lime Pie with what I love about cheesecakes - texture and the cream cheese taste adds dimension. I also like to make with a sugar cookie base.

I loved this recipe for it's simplicity and flavors. Juicing key limes can be quite a chore, but I just cut them in half and squeezed the juice out using my garlic press. Quick, simple, the press catches any seeds and it gets out every drop of juice.

I am not a real fan of key lime pie...too tart for my taste.  However, my mom enjoyed it which was all that really mattered.  I took others' advice and reduced the amount of egg by one, used an additional can of condensed milk, and used 1 cup of key lime juice.  An easy way to juice key limes is to cut them in half and press them in a garlic press.

Excellent, easy, tasty recipe! I did follow the changes. 2 cans condensed milk, 1 cup lemon/lime juice, 4 egg yolks. Everyone was so impressed with this.. including myself! I did add 4 drops green food colouring to give it that key-lime colour. Serve chilled for best texture, and to make it easier to cut.

This pie was sooo good, very rich! I kept mine covered in the freezer the whole time and just took it out when I wanted a slice... the texture stayed perfect that way.  And I don't know, are key lime pies supposed to stay in the freezer?... (This was my first key lime pie ;-))  I did put whipped cream on the entire thing which was a mistake b/c, of course, it stayed frozen also.  I would rather have had fresh whipped cream on each slice, or no whipped cream at all ;-).

I LOVE this recipe.  Instead of using a store-bought pie crust, however, I use 1-1/2 cups crushed gingersnap cookies mixed with 3 tbsp. butter (pressed into a pie tin). You still don't have to bake the crust and it compliments the tart lime custard wonderfully!  A keeper!  THANKS!

This was raved about by my husband and dinner guests. Like other reviewers, I used 4 egg yolks, 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, precooked the pie crust until golden and I used 1c fresh key lime juice. I also had to increase cooking time to 25 minutes. Juicing the key limes is a little time consuming since they're soooo small. I've got a little pie filling left that I plan on using as a filling for mini tarts topped with fresh rasberries.

Maybe I shouldn't have followed others' suggestions.  I used 2 cans condensed milk, 4 egg yolks, 2/3 cup of lime juice and the zest of two limes.  It was too sweet for my taste. It didn't have enough of that tart lime taste that I like.

Like the others I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, I cup key lime juice, and 5 (not 4) egg yolks.   THAT recipe is an absolute keeper!!!  Perfect consistency and taste.   Also be sure to keep it in the oven till it's set.... 
Enjoy!

This was my first time to make a key lime pie. It's my boyfriend's favorite dessert, and I decided to make it for his birthday.  I put 7 egg yolks, 3/4 cup lime juice and 1 1/2 cans of condensed milk for more filling. I also put 1.5-2.0 ounces of lime jello mix for consistency and color. It turned out beautifully. Everyone loved it. Eggs make this pie a bit custardy, and the jello mix made look naturally green(not the fake food coloring look). I topped it with canned whipped cream and lime zest. Definitely recommended.

I first made this Fall of 2001 for my then boyfriend (now husband).  He asks for it all the time, and so does my dad.  If key limes are hard to find, I sub 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup lime juice.  We all just love this.

No alterations necessary to this easy (not to mention delicious) recipe.  I topped the baked pie with meringue (made from 'Meringue II'), then popped it back in the oven to brown.  Simply fantastic -- thanks!

My two oldest girls fell in love with this recipe.  I made the graham cracker crust from the Snicker pie recipe on this site and covered the bottom of the crust with macadamia nuts chopped fine.  I also doubled the filling recipe  so I could fill a 9 inch pyrex pie plate.  You will have a little filling left over. Baked it for 20 minutes instead of fifteen and the extra filling set fine.  For real fun, decorate with the Whipped Cream Cheese frosting, also on this site.  Wonderfully easy, even with all the little touches and it made me a hero!  On my "make whenever asked" list.

This was an easy recipe.  I bought a bag of key limes because they were cute and decided to make the pie.  I prepared the boxed pie crust mix and baked the crust according to the directions putting parchment paper on the crust and filling it with dried beans.  After 10 min. I removed the paper and beans and baked it for 5 minutes more.  While waiting for the crust to bake and cool, I squeezed all the limes and prepared the filling.  I thought the final product was quite tasty but a smidgen too tart for me.  Next time I will add maybe a tablespoon of sugar and/or sprinkle sugar on the filling before I put it in the oven to bake. Thanks for an easy recipe.

My brother-in-law had a July 4th BBQ and wanted to make him something extra special. Being that he LOVES key lime pie, I decided to make this oh-so-simple recipe. It was a big hit and was gone within 15 minutes!

This is one of the easiest things I have ever made! I made one for my family and they loved it so much I made two more for the 4th of July. Unfortunately, for the last two I made, I didn't have enough time to cool them, so they were a little puddly, even after two hours in the fridge. I actually thought they were better the next day, so make them a day in advance!

Tis was an EXCELLENT pie! It was jus the right amount of tart to sweet. I added some grated lime zest for extra flavor. Though some people have differant flacor liking i suggest makin it it once before altering it so u know if you want to add more juice or sweetener

Great Key Lime pie.  I'm sure fresh would be best but bottled Key Lime Juice (not just regular lime juice) was great.  I made it in the throw away type of pie pan with homemade graham cracker crust and it filled it perfectly.

This tastes wonderful. I used the recommended 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk (fat-free) 4 beaten egg yolks and 1 c fresh lime juice (about 3 limes). I found it necessary to add 5 drops of green food coloring to make it pleasing to the eye. This turned out absolutely perfectly.

We gobbled this up, I am in love. So easy, I even used a reduced fat graham crackers crust, and fat free condensed milk. The only thing I changed was added white chocolate chips to the bottom of the crust before pouring in the key lime mix. Fabulous, tart with white chocolate sweet.a keeper!

I WISH I HAD READ THE REVIEWS FIRST !!! It's baking now.  I used fresh key limes - it took 16 to make a half cup of juice.  I had bought 2 cans of the milk, so I would had enough of that but I did not have enough limes to produce more juice.  I got a 10" prepared crust, so it isn't very full; I would have had plenty of room for more filling. I would have been glad to drop the eggs to 4 !!  Maybe next time. Giving it a 4 because it was easy; but I haven't tasted it yet.  Milk, eggs & lime juice, what could be wrong ?  We'll see later tonight.

Being from Cayo Hueso,I can verify that this is the real thing!!  However, if you need to spread it around a little farther, add a 8 oz softened pkg of cream cheese.

I do not eat key lime pie, but my husband does and he loved the pie. It was super easy to make, the hardest part was separating out the yolk from the egg whites.

This was exactly what the hubs was looking for in a key lime pie!  I made the filling as directed along with the zest of one lime.  Next time I will double the filling so the pie is taller.

I followed some other recommendations and used 4 yolks, 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, and a whole cup of key lime juice. I made the crust myself. It came out quite tart, but in the way that key lime pie should. I always add brown sugar to my graham cracker crusts, and the sweet crust compliments and contrasts the tartness of the pie perfectly. This will be my default recipe for Key Lime Pie. Thanks!

I made this pie as it was written. (besides a couple tsp of zest and a lot of whipped cream. :))

Firstly, I've never had key lime pie before, so I don't know how they're suppose to taste. 

I don't think I noticed any eggy flavor with this recipe; though I did think it tasted like Froot Loops, which I'm not really fond of, but I assume that's probably the nature of this type of pie.  

My reason for reviewing this is mostly because the amount seems very low for a 9" pie.  Unless you're going to lay on some serious meringue or cream.  
I don't think mine even made it half way to the top of the pie pan.

Soyeah. Just a warning.

You can't lose with this recipe.  Every time I've made it, it's a hit.  I add the juice of a regular lime too - I like it a little tart.  Easy, quick and quite tasty.  Great recipe.

Like other reviews I used 2 cans sweetened condensed milk and I only used 3 egg yolks due to the fact I had jumbo eggs on hand.  I couldn't find key limes anywhere and read that you could use half lime and helf lemon juice to acquire the taste, and it worked perfect!  This was amazing and super easy, my husband and picky mother loved it as did I!!!! Will certainly be making a lot!

I love this recipe! I have baked it many times I'm in Florida though I've tried other self proclaimed "best key lime pies" they didn't quite suffy my own palate until I baked my own. I have created/followed a few different modifications: Definitely cut back on egg yolks -5 makes it too eggy and hard-
I substituted the two cans of CM for 1 fat free CM 1/2 can of evaporated milk 4 egg yolks pure vanilla lime zest (about 2 spoons) and depending on how tart limey and sour you want it 1/3 to 1 cup of key lime juice (I've use reg. fresh lime juice about 1/3 and lots of finely zest) it's so creamy so good! 
**Tip: mix all ingredients but the juice take your time as the custard will thick out while adding the juice then putting in oven @ 375• for 20min then set for an hr or two. I use a homemade Graham crust yummy!!

I really improvised on this pie, combining two recipes, as I couldn't decide which sounded the best.  One recipe for white chocolate key lime pie had white chocolate and cream added to the Eagle Brand milk and lime juice.  And this recipe with the egg yolks sounded good, so I just added the white chocolate chips (1 cup) and cream (1/2 cup) to this recipe and added another 2 egg yolks--I know, that's a lot  of egg yolks, but I wanted to make sure it set up with the added ingredients.  I also used about 1 1/4 cups lime juice.  I baked it for about 30 minutes, too.  It did set up just fine and tasted really good, but the white chocolate flavor wasn't noticeable, so don't think I'd do that again.  Probably would just stick to this recipe as posted.

This reciepe does not specify how to "combine" the ingredients so I just mixed and I thought I mixed well. The pie never jelled in the over. After reading other receipes (and baking the pie longer in hopes of it jelling) I found that I may needed to have had to use an eletric mixer so the ingredients became firm.

I was concerned with the volume and rightly so it only made half a pie. The color was light peanut. I stopped in the middle and modified it.

the filling is delicious! I have only 2 problems with this: #1: 15 minutes is too long for the crust to cook, mine burnt and cracked on several tries. #2: I had about 1" of crust visible before and after baking.

I just made this tonight.  I followed the other reviews and used 4 egg yolks, 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk,  and 1 cup of key lime juice.  I squeezed  key limes to get the juice.  I think this would be better if I had only used 3/4 cup lime juice.  It was good, but just a little tart. Next time, I will try bottled juice (easier!) and try 3/4 cp.

Did not really care for this recipe. It was very strong tasting even by reducing to 1/3 cup of lime juice. I was looking for a light taste of the key limes.

This is soooo good and super easy.  I made it for a party and everyone raved.  I used the bigger pre-made pie crust and used 4 egg yolks 3/4 cup lime juice (you can use 1 cup if you like it more tart) and 2 cans sweetened condensed milk.  I added a little lime zest.  Came out perfect.

I was able to find Nellie and Joe's Key Lime Juice at my local commissary and it's 100% natural and really good.  I highly recommend this brand.

After reading through the reviews, I decided to stick to the recipe (and not tweak anything).  Turned out great!  Make sure to beat the eggs VERY well.  I left in oven for 5 additional minutes also (20 total).  This is my husband's favorite dessert, and he rated it 4 stars.

USE ONLY 4 EGG YOLKS, it tastes a lot better
Save egg whites to add meringue: after the pie is set let it cool a little and decorate, bake on low temp for 10 mins or until the meringue looks a little bit darker

I made this pie for my fiance and he loved it! It's such a simple recipe with great results! It's even better if you add a thin layer of cool whip and thin sliced toasted almonds on top!

Super easy!  This is a great recipe to have on hand.  I thought the first few bites were perfect but as I ate more, I began to think the texture was a tad too thick.  I will try a recipe that adds some sort of sour cream or whipped cream or egg whites in the future to see if that lightens up the texture a bit.

This was nice and limey, but it had a custard texture. I LOVE key lime pie and this just was a weird texture for me. The Key Lime Pie IX is still my favorite recipe.

If made as-is, I would've given this 3 stars. By altering it as others have done, it's 5 stars EASY! I used 4 egg yolks, and 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk. I also used the zest of 2 limes to give it added flavor. My husband asks me to make it all the time now!

Fabulous!  As others suggested, used only 4 egg yolks, 2 cans of condensed milk, 1 cup key lime juice from a bottle, and the larger prepared graham cracker crust.

This was so EASY to make!!  I did what the others recommended.  I used 2 can of sweet condensed milk, 4 eggs yolks and 1 cup of fresh lime juice that I squeezed (6 to 7 limes).  Taste great and it was a hit a the party.

I've been looking for ways to utilize the key limes from my tree and this recipe caught me as one simple to make. I followed some of the suggestions in the previous comments. I used 4 egg yolks and 2 14 oz cans of sweetened condensed milk per pie, but only used 1/2 cup of lime juice. I made two pies and cooked them at 350 for 20 minutes. I then let the cool in the refrigerator. One I pulled out the next evening for a potluck, the next stayed in the fridge for 2 extra days. The first one was very tart and my wife complained about it. The second was very smooth with a wonderful full lime flavor, but was not the least bit sour. I took it to work and my coworkers kept coming back for seconds. Definitely a winner in my book.

This is the best key lime pie! I followed others suggestions and used 2 cans of condensed milk, 1 cup key lime juice, and 4 egg yolks. If you don't have fresh key lime juice Nellie and Joes is the best to buy. Comes out perfect every time.

Made it as written (weird that I have to say that) & it came out great. Not as tart as I would've liked so I may add a little lemon juice next time but other than that it was wonderful!!

Classic key lime pie, and oh so easy!  Once the pie was finished, I cut it into thin slices, stuck popsicle sticks in the ends with the crust, froze them on wax paper, dipped them in melted chocolate, and then re-froze the pie bars.  Incredible!

This turned out even better than i expected, i used 2 cans of condensed milk, 4 eggs, 1C Key Lime Juice and the zest of 2 key limes. The Zest really made the the key lime flavor pop. I baked it for 25 mins at 350 then turned the oven off and let it set in the oven for about 15 mins.  After it cooled i made real whipped cream for the topping and coverd the pie and then added a sprinkle of Key Lime Zest...this was a real wow...but you must like Key Lime!!

This is a really great recipe.  I gave it 4 stars since I made a few changes.  I couldn't bear to waste that many egg whites, so I only used 4 egg yolks.  I also used 3/4 c key lime juice since I bought too much and don't have any other use for it.  I made some homemade whipped cream to spread on the top.  We were really pleased with the results.  This will definitely be added to our repertoire.

This pie was delicious! However, I tasted it alongside another key lime pie and liked the other one better because it was creamier and less tart.

This recipe is the closest to the one I use.  The modifications to this one are to reduce the egg yolks to 3.  Reduce the temperature to 350 and bake time to 10 minutes.  I make my own graham cracker crust and beat the whipping cream with a tiny bit of sugar to top it.  Comes out perfect every time.

Good sweet/tart combination. Love it! I made the recipe from the Nellie & Joe's Lime Juice prior to this one and it only uses 3 egg yolks. I can't tell the difference in taste or creaminess. I will probably use the 3 egg one since obviously it uses less eggs. Thanks Dinner2.

This is a great recipe , I didn't believe it could be that simple , it is , I doubled the recipe for two pies , it was a huge hit and a flawless recipe , I added a couple of drops of green food coloring paste just to bump up the color.

Five stars with the changes.  I just did this for our annual "Pie Holiday".  I had never made Key Lime Pie before and everyone LOVED this one.  I did the 4 egg yolks, 2 cans milk, 1 cup bottled Key Lime Juide (used Nellie and Joe brand), 1 tsp. lime zest, and 2 drops green food coloring.  I mad my own graham crust.  It came out great!!

I couldn't believe how easy (and inexpensive) it was to make this key lime pie. I followed the direction but with one less egg yolk. This filled my 9" pie crust perfectly. Now I just need to get this pie out of my house so I would stop eating it. I will never buy another store brought key lime pie again.

Great recipe!  I also took the suggestions of previous reviews and used only 4 egg yolks and 2 cans of condensed milk but, to cut the fat, I used one can of fat free condensed milk and one can of low fat condensed milk.  I also used 1 cup of lime juice and it set beautifully.  My husband loved it so much that he already had seconds tonight.  I also loved it....Thank you!

I completely agree that this recipe is fantastic but you do need to make some changes. 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, 4 egg yolks and 1 cup key lime juice makes it perfect!

This is almost identical to the recipe I've been using, with great results.  I only use 4 egg yolks and add 1 teaspoon of grated lime zest.  Since I don't like whipped cream, I use the left-over 4 egg whites to make meringue, which I put on top while the pie is hot and bake slowly until slightly browned.  The nice thing about meringue is that it is FAT FREE way to top this rather high fat pie.

I feel bad that i only gave 1 star when everyone is giving 5 stars. maybe it's just me, but i didn't like it at all. don't know what i did wrong, but it didn't set and end up baking 45 minutes.  Second time, fallowed  others' suggestions.   I used 2 cans condensed milk, 4 egg yolks, 2/3 cup of lime juice and the zest of two limes.  still didn't turn  right.

Great! This is a perfect key lime pie. I think if I had used 2 cans of condensed milk like other reviewers suggested I would have had to use a deep dish pie pan. *Update - this has become a common dessert at our house and always comes out perfectly. It's so easy to make and a great summertime dessert!

I read many receipes.  Decided to try this one with the recommendations made by other reviewers, 4 yolks, 2 cans condensed milk and 1 cup of key lime juice.  Hand squeezed all those little limes!  Came out a little too tart almost with a bitter after taste.  I'm going to try it again with a little less lime juice.  The consistancy is right, but the bitterness is not something I enjoyed.  Could have been bad limes, but I will reduce the lime juice to 1/2 or 3/4 cup next time.

I followed the advice of another reviewer and used 4 egg yolks, 1 can condensed milk, 1/2 cup lime juice and the zest of two key limes.  This made a great mixture for me, perfect amount of sweet and sour, it makes a very shallow pie so I whipped up some fresh cream and layered it on top.  I also made my own graham crust, it only takes ten minutes and makes all the difference in my opinion.  Delicious!

Great recipe! I am no chef by any means but when my boyfriend requested a key lime pie, I had to oblige. I love AllRecipes and stumbled upon this recipe and figured it'd be easy enough... and it was! I followed the ingredients to a T and it turned out beautiful. I'm actually going to go back and tweak it a little with more condensed milk for a less "lime-y" taste (much like all the other reviews recommend). Thanks!!!

I made this recipe exactly as directed with no modifications and I thought it was wonderful.  I used fresh squeezed key limes (boy are my hands sore from those little suckers!) and made my own crust using the Graham Cracker Crust I recipe by Carol (I left out the cinnamon).  The pie is tart, but the sweetness of the crust and the whipped cream balance it out beautifully.

Loved this as a base recipe!  I changed the recipe a little based on other reviews I read and it turned out perfectly.  I was even told it was restaurant quality!! First I used 4 egg yolks, 1/2 fresh squeezed lime juice, 1/4 cup bottled lime juice, 1/4 cup bottled lemon juice, and 2 cans sweetened condensed milk.  I used a premade 9 inch graham cracker crust and baked on 325 for 20 minutes.  using the ingredients above fills the pie crust perfectly.  i garnished the pie with lime zest, whipped cream, and lime slices.  it was a huge hit at our fathers day cookout.  great summertime pie and super easy to make.  thanks a bunch!

Simple but yet so good. I loved the texture but not enough lime to my liking. I'll redo it with 3/4 cups of lemon instead. But this is really good. With more lime it will be perfect. Note : I used lime instead of key lime and 4 eggs. (5 seems too much)

This was super tasty and impressive!  Used 4 egg yolks, one cup key lime juice, 2 cans of condensed milk and store bought graham cracker crust.  For the key limes: I found a bag of key limes (tiny!) at my local grocery store (in Massachusetts at Shaws) -- was time consuming to juice them almost all of them (with a juicer) and didn't even get a full cup (I don't think all would have made a full cup - and/or would just barely)...glad I bought a backup bottle. Also put some lime zest in the mix - maybe one tsp. This is sweet - but tasty - I liked the extra tartness from the zest.  My bake time was about 25 minutes - watch it from 15 to 20 minutes...it just started to look like it was about to get golden (that would be too far!)...clearly done. Chilled in the fridge for about 2-3 hours.  Reserved a few limes for garnish: I sliced and candied 2 of them (made about 10 slices)..basically sliced thin, blanched for 2 minutes in boiling water, pulled out. Refilled pan with one C water, one C sugar, brought to a gentle boil and put the slices back in, simmered for about 25-30 minutes. Took out limes and "dried" on a baking rack for about 1 hour, then tossed in a bowl with a little sugar to coat. Arranged on top -- Impressive and got props!  Finished with store bought whipped cream...which makes it fancier looking around the edges -- and grated lime zest on it (like the pic!) Just put it on right before serving...it wilts a bit.  This pie will make you a superstar - tastes amazing, easy

I made my own graham cracker crust and pressed them into cupcake liners. Filled 2 cupcake tins with 4 yolks, 1 C of juice (30 key limes) and 2 cans of condensed milk. Into the oven for 15 minutes and voila! Perfect portions of key lime pie. I froze a dozen of them for later snacking. I plan on serving with homemade whipped cream and toasted shredded coconut. If served plain, the key lime is quite tart.

OMG!!!! This was soooo good.  I made it for my husband who loves key lime pie. I did follow some of the changes that others did and it came out perfect.  I did use about 1/3c of fresh squeezed lime juice and the rest from a bottle but this was the best.  I will use this time and time again..  Thanks so much.

I followed the recipe but also added a little bit of lime zest. It was easy to make and very very good. If I ever have to make pies for a crowd I'll be making this one!

Pretty good pie!  Lovely flavor!  I used others suggestions: 4 yolks and 2 cans sweetened cond. milk (I used the fat free kind).  I also used a pre-baked pie crust and key lime juice from the bottle.  I baked it for 30 minutes since I had an additional can of milk.  My dad loved this pie!  My only mistake was that after it was well chilled, I topped it with whipped cream from the can -HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE MISTAKE!!  The whipped cream deflated and liquified and is now seeping down the sides of the crust, I'm sure making it soggy as I type.  We ate some to still enjoy the flakiness of the crust but I'm afraid that experience is over.  In the future I will definitely use heavy whipping cream to make my own whipped cream -it stays firm and pretty and doesn't ruin your pie!  Don't make my mistake.

This is the authentic version of key lime pie.  I made exactly as recipe stated and wouldn't change a thing.  I'm from south Florida so I know my key lime pie!  Don't fix what isn't broken.

I followed the suggestions (4 egg yolk, 2 cans sweet cond. milk, 3/4 c lime juice and 1/4 lemon) and the pie was wonderful. I chilled it for a few hours and then added the whipping cream to the top with some lime zest. Beautiful and delicious. Not a crumb was left at our neighborhood bbq.

I loved it. For anyone that likes the Publix Key Lime Pie this is your recipe. I kept the recipe the same and for lime juice I used a bottle of the key lime juice that comes in the green plastic lime shaped bottle. It was simple, quick and delicious!

This was really good! I've been wanting to try this recipe for a while because of how easy it looked.  It was easy, and delicious too. I loved the creamy tart flavor. I made the recipe as written- later I decided to make a meringue from the leftover egg whites to top the pie with. I used the meringue topping from "Lime Meringue Pie" on this site, since it called for 5 egg whites. I baked the pie alone first, and then made the meringue a few hours later.

Great Taste. However, the pie came out a bit too gooey. It has a much better "texture" if you cool it first then set it in the fridge. It'll be easier to cut and it won't fall apart.

This was yummy.  My husband is not a huge fan of graham cracker crust, so I made it with an oreo crust (crushed oreos with some melted unsalted butter).  It is the first time he has EVER wished I had made a bigger crust.  Usually, he just likes the tart key lime pie filling.  Next time I will double the crust (I will use 32 oreos with 4 Tbl butter).  I also followed the recommendation of 4 yolks, 2 can swt. cond. milk, and 1 c lime juice.  The filling was good.  Not as tart as my husband loves, but still very good.

I'm not a connoisseur of key lime pies.  But I needed to bring something to a family "pie off".  5 stars for simplicity, especially if you go with bottled lime juice.  I squeezed by hand.  Texture, nice and creamy.  Flavor, good punch of lime and good amount of pucker.  I also homemade the graham crust, but should have made a little bit more.  Went straight for the mods by other users (4 yolks, 2 cans milk).  Topped with whipped cream, but forgot to put little lime slice garnish.  BTW, won the pie off.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I followed the 4 eggs, 2 cans condensed milk and 1 cup key lime juice suggestions and ended up with enough filling for two crusts! Perhaps I made it too fluffy? I took the time to first beat the egg yolks for about 4 minutes and then slowly added the condensed milk while still beating on a medium speed. I finally slowed my mixer to 'stir' and added the key lime juice.

While the first pie was baking, I sent my boyfriend out to get a second crust and I added some more key lime juice to the second half of the batter (about a tablespoon) and some lime zest. This second one came out much more tart than the first and I think was preferred by most of my coworkers. However, both pies were pretty much devoured and got rave reviews!!

Next time, I'm going to try to half the modified recipe as I don't need two pies and modify it a little. I like the more tart version of the pie except that it didn't hold together as well. I think there wasn't enough eggs in it. SO I'm going to try 3 eggs, 1 can condensed milk and 1/2 cup and 1 tbsp of key lime juice. I love experimenting!

LOVE THIS!  Can't beat it for an easy dessert.  I bake mine for 20 min. and sometimes make more filling if I want the pie shell more full.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious Key Lime Pie.  My husband and I are living in Scotland so I couldn't find a graham cracker crust.  I made a crust with Ginger Nut cookies (basically gingersnaps) crushed and added a little melted butter and pressed into the bottom of a pie pan.  It was delicious!  Served it with freshly whipped double cream blended with marscapone cheese.  It balanced the sweetness of the pie perfectly for a great combination.

Made this for my son's 30th birthday bash it was a huge hit!  There wasn't a crumb left. I used Nellie & Joe's brand Key West Lime Juice. I doubled the recipe and used a 10" cheese cake pan.  Will use this recipe again and again.

Great for key lime pie lovers, i used a "Nilla" vanilla flavoured graham crumb crust and it was wonderful, almost ate the whole pie myslef.
If your looking for an extra creamy pie though this isnt it, this is more a pastry type pie. Best ive eaten.

Oh my word-- this is so good.I did use 7 egg yolks and one and a half cans of condensed milk for the fuller pie. I used 3/4 cup lime juice and for me it was a little tart and I will use 1/2 cup next time but it is so smooth and delicious Im already looking for an excuse to make another one!!

Was so easy to make and really tasty. I added a lot of extra lime juice per reviews, and wished I had not as the pie was a tad runny. Will make recipe 'as is' next time. Thanks!

Awesome! I doubled the recipe and made two regular-sized pies for two parties. I made meringue for the top and baked the pies for 12 minutes without the meringue, then added the meringue and baked for an additional 10 minutes. It took no time at all (especially when you have your boyfriend juice the limes for you), and it was the hit of both parties! Practically everyone asked me for the recipe and I was a bit embarrassed to give it to them because it is so easy!

Very good pie.  I followed other suggestions of doubling the recipe and putting into the 2 xtra serving graham cracker shell and it worked perfectly.  However, I reduced the eggs to 7 total and couldn't find fresh key limes so used the bottled juice and it was still fine.  Baked at 350 for 25 minutes and refrigerated overnight before serving.

Turned out really creamy even though I used reduced fat graham crackers to make the crust, and reduced fat condensed milk. Will definitely make again. So simple...!

This pie was delicious! I just happened to find fresh key limes at my grocery store and the hardest part of this recipe was squeezing them (a whole pound) for the 1/2C of juice! I will make this again (and again) for sure!!  :)

Very easy to follow recipe and QUICK!! Glad one of the reviewers specified the number of limes needed.  Also, I didn't know the key lime was a specific lime, but it is rare (may be able to easily find in California or Florida).  So, I used purely, freshly squeezed limes (Persian).  It appears to be just as good.  However, you can use half lemon juice/half lime juice to get it to be close to the key lime taste - but not exactly.  Otherwise, I hear the use of the bottled version would suffice.

yep- really easy and REALLY tasty!!!!  i also juiced the limes myself, took me about 7 of them to make 1/2 cup.  it isn't green, of course, because of the egg yolks...but if you wanted, you could add some green food coloring.  what a GREAT pie!!!

This is a great recipe!  Everytime I make it for a function there is never any left to take home... The first time I made it I let it bake for 15 minutes but now since I have made it quite a few times I let it cook for an additional 10-15 minutes so that it will firm up.. Even people who have never had key lime pie have asked me to make it for them after tasting it.. Thanks so much for this recipe!

Perhaps the little bit of additional key lime juice I added made the difference, but my pie was too tart.  I would highly recommend adding green food coloring... my pie looked more of a sickly yellow color.

Extremely easy and very authentic tasting.  I accidentally got some egg whites mixed in, but it didn't seem to hurt it at all.  I also used fat free condensed milk, and bottled key lime juice.  The only thing I added was a whipped cream layer over the top to fill the crust better.  Perfect summer dessert!

I used fat-free condensed milk. After mixing the eggs and juice into the beaten eggs, I mixed all on high speed for one minute. Made a light, extremely delicious pie. I used the "Buttery Crunch Crust" recipe and served light whipped topping with the pie.

Such an easy recipe!  The results are delicious, although you might want to forget about how many egg yolks are actually in the pie!  :)  I couldn't get any key lime juice, so I used lime juice concentrate, but it tasted fine.  May not taste like something you'd get in the Keys, but it gets a passing grade, for sure.  The amount of pie filling is smaller than most because of the richness.

I also followed the 4 eggs/2 cans milk suggestion, and it came out oh so delicious with cool whip on top.  I will most certainly make this again and may even try using chocolate sweetened condensed milk without the lime juice as a yummy variation.  Great stuff!

I followed the suggestion of using 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, 4 egg yolks and 1 c. of key lime juice.  It was the best key lime pie!  Very thick and creamy and we hate the fake green ones, so this was just perfect LOL.  Will definitely make it again and again!

Well a coworker of mine who had never cooked won a cookoff with this and I finally made this yesterday.  It is sooo good!  I used a 10" pie crust (Graham Cracker Crust II recipe) so I used the changes someone else mentioned (1 cup key lime juice - you can buy this in a bottle at Whole Foods in the juice section), 4 egg yolks and 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk).  It was awesome!  It comes out yellow, a drop of food coloring if you want it green!

My boyfriend begged me to make him Key lime pie, becuase he decided he liked the Astro key lime yogurt????....Men!!! I had never made key lime pie before, let alone any type of pie for that matter.  This recipe was so easy and so quik. I read some of the suggestions but decided to stick with the original, I figured hey if it's the winner of an award it can't be that bad.  The flavor was great, not too tart not too eggy.  I put it in a premade short bread crust and put a layer of cool whip on top and Garnished with a Curl of lime peel.  The four of us finished the entire pie within 10 min.  But DEFFINATLEY ADD GREEN FOOD COLORING!!!  The pie will otherwise be very Yellow!

Everyone was bugging me to make Irresistible Pecan Pie again (look it up and try it!), but no, I'd noticed we had a lot of limes in the fruit and vegetable fridge drawer and wanted to try something different. I don't know if these are the same as 'key limes,' they were just regular old New Zealand limes that my mother had been putting slices of in her gin and tonic. Important note for non-American cooks saying 'What on earth is a graham cracker crust?' Graham crackers are essentially the same as plain wheat digestive biscuits. I used these in the 'Graham Cracker Crust III' recipe and it turned out perfectly (okay, the edges burned a little bit because I set the oven timer wrong, but I cut those off and it tasted fine). Malt biscuits would also work well. Although a lot of reviews here complained that there was too little filling for a nine-inch pie dish, I didn't find this a problem, although my pie was not full to the brim. I think a nice way to top it up might be to cover the filling (after it's baked and cooled) with an arrangement of kiwi fruit slices (hairy skins removed!) - the colours and flavours would complement each other. I added a couple of drops of green food colouring because the original mixture was a distinct yellow colour - from the egg yolks, I guess. It looked more lemony than lime so I thought I'd help it along. And the final verdict? Everyone really enjoyed it, and I think in future they'll bug me to make key lime pie as well!

Made this last night. It went together in less than 5 minutes.  I added a little more lime juice as I wanted it extremely tart. I also added one drop of blue food coloring to get a pale green color.  Easy as pie as they say. However..... considering the multitude of rave reviews, I was a bit disappointed in the flavor. Yes, it was tart, but it had that familiar "condensed milk" pie flavor underneath.

I am a native Floridian and I lost my Grandmother's key lime pie recipe.   So many of these recipes are very similar, but the ratio of eggs to juice in this pie is perfect!  This pie is da bomb!!!  Thank you SOOOOO much!

This was a big hit in our family, though it was a little sweet for my Key Lime taste preference.  Maybe adding a little more lime would have helped.  I did use the fat free condensed milk and don't think it altered the flavor.  There wasn't any way around the egg yolks...but once in awhile some things are worth the extra fat and calories!

I made this pie last night and it was a smash.  I substituted sweetened condensed milk w/fat free and used Lite Cool Whip.  I'm really picky about my sweets and especially about key lime pie, and I thought it was delicious. The recipe calls for 6-8 Tbsp of lime juice, - I used 8, and it was just enough, but I like my k.l. pie tart!  Happy cooking!

This is the recipe passed down through 5 generations of my family from Florida and I have passed it to generations 6 and 7.  You only need 4 egg yolks, not 5 and the rest of it is correct. You can bake it or not, up to you and how you feel about raw egg yolks.  If you are going to bake it, 15 minutes at 350 and chill till serving.  If you are NOT going to bake it, after mixing, let it sit in the fridge for 8 hours to "chemically" cook it and it will set up.  The unbaked version yields a softer creamier texture but both are good, it's just personal preference.  I've been making this pie for 56 years, it never fails.

I went with the often recommended 4 egg yolks, 2 cans sweetened condensed milk and 30 minutes of bake time. Turned out perfect. Will make it again.

Really good, but my search for the best recipe continues. Followed suggestions of others as: 4 egg yolk, 2 cans condensed milk and a bag of key limes (15). Perfect lime, around 3/4C. I don't think actual recipe would make enough filling. DO NOT listen to others for cook time or you will get an over cooked pie. Try 20 minutes then add a few more if needed.

I would give it 5 but I added a cup of key lime juice and used two 300ml cans of condensed milk and that is what we have in Canada. Also put lime zest in with it. Used 4 egg yolks. 5 is good just a bit too yellow. I also put ginger in my graham cracker crust or use ginger snaps  it’s a really nice compliment. Don’t forget to temper your eggs if the temperature of the milk and lime is a lot different than the eggs as they may curdle.

I am a native Floridian and have been making and eating Key Lime Pie for literally decades.  I have eaten some that was divine, and some that was an abomination. 

This recipe is as close to mine as I can find (and of course I like mine best :)).  The only differences are that I bump up the  amount of condensed milk to about 19 ounces and the amount of key lime juice to six ounces, and I use four eggs.  I have made this pie too many times to count and it has earned some of the best compliments I have ever received.

Two pro-tips.  (1) If you can, squeeze your own fresh key limes.  It will be fresher and better than any store-bought juice.  A single one pound bag (about 20 limes) yields the perfect amount of juice for one pie.  If you can't find key limes at your grocer, then use the bottled Key West lime juice rather than Persian limes which are not tart enough.  (2)  Make your own graham cracker crust using a recipe you can find here.  Quick and easy and soooooooo much better than premade pie shells.

Last note.  This filling is dense.  It is supposed to be dense.  That is how true Key Lime pie is.  There is another type of pie that folks call Key Lime Pie that uses egg whites, often substitutes Persian limes, adds green food coloring (!), and whips it all up into a light, whipped, filling.  It is not a bad pie if done correctly (and preferably with a pastry dough crust rather than a graham crust), and some restaurants even in Florida serve it.  But I wish folks would just c

I made this exactly like the recipe said and it was pretty bad. Then I read the reviews wondering what I did wrong and saw that every positive review changed the recipe. Why give a recipe five stars and then say “oh, but I changed everything about it.” Little frustrating. I saw it was well liked and thought it would be good but it was terrible. Didn’t realize I needed to change it to a completely different recipe.

I made it once using the recommendations (two cans of milk, four eggs...) and then made it again as  written.  I liked it better as written!  It's not as full, but I liked adding a lot of whipped cream on top.  Perfect as is.

Very simple recipe ! No need to change anything, I added  2/3 lemon juice and it's just a bit overpowering so my bad. Maybe I'll add a drop of green dye, they came out very yellow. Put into tart shells and baked 18 minutes at 350 F. Great mix to Xmas baking.

Meh. I made it with the 4 egg yolks, 1 cup lemon/lime half and half juice (freshly squeezed) and 2 scm. I didn't think it was tart enough... Just not great really. Not fair to judge the recipe if I didn't follow the recipe, but I just don't think it's great at all. But it was fairly quick - aside from squeezing all the juice. We couldn't find key lime juice.... Would rather have a more complicated recipe with a better taste.

This pie is PHENOMENAL - I have such little time and this makes me look like i spent hours! I use my Grandmother's fancy pie plate that she left to me.. and it is so beautiful, and DELICIOUS! Everyone RAVED.  Consistency is thick, but that's how we like it! Has anyone tried this w/ other fruit, citrus? I love this pie, but want to stretch out... concentrated blueberry? using frozen juices?
Please let me know... thanks!!!!

The easiest and best tasting pie I ever made. I am a novice when it comes to pies. I used as directed 1/2 cup of lime juice, 5 yolks & 1 can of sweetened condensed milk. I used a food processor to mix ingredients throughly and it helped with making the filling very light in consistence (if I had s hand mixer I would have used that).. I used fresh squeezed key lime juice. I did add a touch of finely graded key lime rind to the filling. I baked the pie about 6 minutes longer until I saw the filling rise and firm up a bit. I followed the advice of another reviewer but putting the pie the the freezer for 30 minutes the the fridge from 30 minutes but I cooled it for about 15 minutes before putting it the freezer. I had great reviews and will make this again.

I am a big key lime lover! I've had so many variations and this one hits the spot! It's creamy and just the right amount of lime flavor ( I used half lime and lemon juice). Enjoy! :)

I followed the recipe and I followed the directions.  It was simple, easy, fast, and produced an excellent result.  I used Nellie & Joe's Key Lime juice.  Next time I think I will add a little zest to the mix - just because I like that extra bit of tang.  But it's not necessary - it's a great little recipe on its own and I don't think it needs the suggested whipped cream garnish.  We all ate it plain and loved it!

I'm a thrifty girl, so I didn't dare to use 5 yolks. I added only 2 eggs (not only yolks but with whites), 3/4 cup of lime juice and 1 can of condensed milk. And it turned out to be so good! Such a great bland of sweet and sour. I've never tried key lime pie before (I'm from Russia), but I'll definitely experiment on this recipe. Thank you;)

I tried this recipe based off all the rave reviews.  I did a tweak based on being lactose intolerant.  I used equal parts of cream of coconut instead of sweetened condensed milk.  First off it made more batter than I could fit in a premade 9 inch graham cracker crust. Second I baked it for 35 minutes  at 375 degrees, longer than directed & it turned out to be a flavorful runny custard NOT pie!!!!  It was browning in the middle so I didnt want to burn it...the flavor was great but the consistancy sucked!!! Not sure if I will do this one again...

I'm in college and so having my guy friends wait 4 hours for a pie is just not an option. This pie is fast and disappeared almost instantly. However,  I NEVER use a pre-made pie crust from the store, I defiantly recommend making your own using 1 1/2 cups cinnamon gram crackers, 6 tablespoons melted butter, and 1/3 cup sugar. Mix it and mold it to a pie dish. Stick it in the oven for 7 mins at 375. You can make the pie mix while it cools. It is also worth it because you don't have to change the recipe size for the pie filling, it fits the tin perfectly! Making your own crust does take a bit longer, but its totally worth it! I also chill this pie for about an hr. On hot days its much better to have a cool slice of key lime than a warm one. Amazing pie! Add extra thick whipped cream and its the bee's knees!

Simple As 123

This was my first time baking a key lime pie, and I am happy to say it was very easy. The keylime pie came out great, I did list to the ingredient instructions from some of the users I used 2 cans of condensed milk and 4 eggs. Next time I will add a little bit more key lime juice to the pie to give it a more citrus taste. I kid you not this pie taste exactly like a Edward's key lime pie that you would by in the store.

Oh Yes, And it came out wonderful we intend on trying it again next weekend. However our favorite are the key lime pies that are baked by Anita and Kutchie Pelaez's Key Lime Pie Factory and Grill. They are located near the Biltmore House in Asheville, NC. They are a very hard working married couple team, they use an original 1920'S secret recipe from Key West. We don't really know just what makes their pies so special. Perhaps it could be the love they have for each other magically transmits itself into their wonderful pies.


thanks so much.

Really delicious!  I had no implement to squeeze the key limes (tiny little buggers!), so I did it by hand, a WHOLE BAG, and my fingers were sore by the time I finished . . . but it was worth it!  Other than the lime squeezing, this was sooo easy!  I will buy some sort of device to do the squeezing before I make this again which will be soon!

Great texture but my family of 10 were not at all impressed with this recipe. In fact some of  them wouldn't eat it after the first taste or two. they usually like key lime pie. The condensed milk flavor was way to strong.

This was delicious even though I goofed and used 5 whole eggs instead of just 5 egg yolks.  Pair with a great dessert wine if you really want to make this dish sing.

Absolutely delicious and so easy! This recipie made my day as I could make this for my hubby on his Birthday. We live in India and these are not avialable in the city we live. Thank you!  I made few adjustments based on the earlier feedback by adding 4 eggs, 2 cans of condense milk. I used 1/2 cup of fresh lime juice and we felt it was sufficient. Might be something to do with the sweetness of condense milk ( I used Nestle ). 14 oz is approximately 400 gms which is what the tins are so I simply used up all of it. We don't get graham cracker so i used vanilla wafers. Crushed them really well. Baked for 25 mins. The only piece that I couldn't find was the whipped cream! Totally yummy. A keeper!

Excellent! You can make 3 pies if you use 2 cups of lime juice, 8 yolks and 4 cans of condensed milk. A little lime zest grated in also gave it a nice touch. I baked them for 22 minutes at 375. YUM! It's always nice to make extra to share.

I wasn't thinking when I read the directions and I actually used 5 whole eggs instead of just 5 egg yolks  and I didn't use fresh key lime juice I used the quickest easiest lime juice to find and I made my graham cracker crust using the recipe I found on this website and I was afraid I totally screwed the pie up but my friends and my husband all tried it and all said they loved it and my husband had it gone in two seconds and he said he wasn't going to try it because he doesn't like lime but I begged him lol so it is definitely a keeper!!!

Made this with one modification - only used 4 yolks and added a bit of lime zest. It was wonderful and my daughter was thrilled that her birthday was celebrated with a key lime pie instead of a cake!

My new favourite party dessert!!!  I followed the suggestion for 4 yolks, 1 cup of key lime juice and 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, and adding some lime zest.  I usually don't rate based on modified recipes but since there are so few ingredients and they are such simple adjustments I decided to this time.  Deeelish!!!

I've made this several times now and I also followed reviews from before.  I use 4 egg yolks, 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, and 1 cup of key lime juice out of the bottle.  I squeezed the limes before but you have to do so many, so the next time I made it used the bottle and husband said he couldn't tell the difference.  I also use the 2 extra servings graham cracker crust and it fits in there beautifully.  I also have to bake it alittle longer, between 20-25 minutes!!!

First time in all my years making a Key Lime pie!!! I followed the recipe exactly & it is just perfect!! We like ours firm but I can see how reducing to 4 eggs would be preferred by some people. It is wonderful & is going in my recipe box today!!

Absolutely delicious and easy to make! I followed the other reviews and used two cans of condensed milk, 4 egg yolks and a cup of key lime juice. The key lime juice was a mixture of lemon and lime juice depending on your personal preference for tartness. (usually half and half). Ive made this multiple times using lime/lemon juice in a bottle, fresh limes and fresh lemons and a mixture of fresh and bottled. Its always turned out great.

Well  this pie was good but I used the 5 egg yokes, 2 cans of condensed milk and 1 cup key lime juice. 
A really good topping is to make a meringue by beating the 5 egg whites, 1/2 tsp cream of tarter, 4 1/2 tsp sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla to stiff peaks pile it on the baked pie and bake in oven until the peaks brown.

It was a bit sour for my taste, even after adding a meringue topping. Maybe it was my key limes? Not sure as this was the first key lime pie I've ever tasted.

Made this pie, which got great reviews. However, I found it very sweet. I will definately play with the recipe and try to get it to the desired sweetness. Thanks

I give this recipe 4 stars for it's simplicity. However I have made it 3 times now and was only wowed once. It seems that whenever I make it with real key lime (or hand-squeezed) juice in combination with only 4 yolks it doesn't set right plus is too tart. The one time I made it with pre-bottled juice and 4 yolks it was great, however. Not too sweet or too tart. It definitely needs something creamy to cut the tartness. Eithere cool whip or a meringue.

this recipe turned out really good as it is...I wish I would have read other peoples reviews first though bc i didnt kno that key lime juice was a mixture of lemon and lime juice, when i made this i just used lime juice and I think that must have been what caused a really nasty after taste..I also think that next time I make this I will use the 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk and the lemon/lime juice combo..but over all a very easy recipe and very yummy!

This pie was quick and easy to make. I doubled the recipe and brought a pie to both of the Christmas dinners that I attended. Everyone that ate it, loved it. It was such a hit, that I'm making it for my New Years party I'm hosting.

I am not a pro when it comes to any kind of cooking, but I just love making desserts and this is a new favorite! It is super easy to make and provides for a really attractive dish! I followed other reccomendations and used 4 yolks and 2 cans of milk and it came out perfect--I will definitely be making this again!

I made this for my mother-in-law, as it's her favorite dessert.  She loved it!  I made the changes suggested by most reviewers (one less egg, 2 cans of s/c milk), and used Nellie and Joe's Key West Lime Juice as I couldn't find fresh key limes.  This was incredibly easy and delicious!

As per the advice of many other reviewers, I used 2 cans condensed milk (one regular, one light), 1 cup lime juice and the zest of 1 lime. My husband, whose favourite dessert is key lime pie, and I both agreed - it was "meh". There was a very strong condensed milk flavour overpowering the lime. Will try a different recipe next time.

I am giving this recipe only four out of five stars because I, like so many other reviewers, modified it to a large extent.  I used four egg yolks, two cans of condensed milk, the juice of one lemon in addition to one cup of (Persian/supermarket) lime juice, and a large portion (about a tablespoon) of lime zest.  Oh...and I baked my pie (in a springform pan) for about twenty-five or thirty minutes.  All that being said ... it was great.  Nice texture and nicely tart/sweet.  I had never made a KeyLime pie before, but my friend who is a big fan of the genre said it was very good.  I will enthusiastically make again (with my modifications).  Thanks!  (And thanks to all who reviewed and suggested changes!)

OMG-this is the BEST! Key Lime Pie is my husband's favorite and now I can serve him a  restaurant quality product. I made the recipe as written and realized is was not nearly enough filling (especially for the 2-extra slice graham  cracker crust I had purchased). Went back and read the reviews, scooped out the filling and added another can of sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 c. key lime juice. Perfect fit-baked 20 min. -chilled 4 hrs. prior to serving. Excellent!

This pie was so easy it almost felt like there was no way it could be good, but it was!  I followed the suggestions of others and used two cans of condensed milk, one cup of key lime juice, and four egg yolks.  It filled the pie crust perfectly.  I added some green food coloring and got a very pretty pale green color.  It set perfectly when baked for 20 minutes.  I served it with a dollop of canned whipped cream...  next time I may make some fresh whipped cream and top the whole pie with it.  It was tart and sweet and, as far as I know, that is how key lime pie is supposed to be!

First of all, it took much longer than 15 minutes, at least 30 and you cannot taste the lime. Maybe if you add MORE lime juice it would but as is, nada. I was told it was a good pie tho.

I'm not big on making my own desserts, but...this one is foolproof - I've made this twice for my bunco group, following the recipe as is - filling & crust are wonderful. The first time I piped on some unsweetened whipped cream & topped it with lime wedges, and the second time I simply used whipped cream in a can (& lime wedges). Either way it tasted great & looked pretty - definitely a hit!

Oh yes... this was great.  I did no adjust the recipe like so many others.  I this turned out great for me.  I doubled it and placed it in a spring form pan.  I did use the advise to use a garlic press to juice the limes.  A keeper indeed.

Great if you go with suggestions of 4 eggs, 2 cans sweetened condensed milk and 1 cup of both 1/2 lime and lemon juice (or 1 cup real keylime juice)....i love it...its the best pie ever...everyone will think it was store bought!

I haven't made it yet but LOVED the pie my friend made using this recipe. And I thought I hated key lime pie until this one! She "adjusted by using 4 egg yolks, scant 2 cans sweetened condensed milk, and scant 1 c. lime juice (i used regular lime juice, from the bottle. it was way cheaper and easier.)" I will try it soon because my husband loved it, too.

I like this Key Lime Pie. I don't normally care for them. Everyone liked  how creamy it was. Tried making it with 1 cup of Key Lime, 4 egg yokes, 2 cans sweetened condensed milk as suggested. But that made it to limey for me. I then made it exactly the way it says. I used already squeezed key lime juice, for I couldn't find key limes. Everyone who had some really enjoyed it. This will be a keeper. So easy and simple.

Five stars are not enough!  I brought this pie to a block party and wrote the recipe down over and over.  I followed everyone's advice and used 2 cans of condensed milk, a cup of lime juice, and four egg yolks.  I also used a regular pie shell instead of a graham cracker crust, and it was fantastic.  The texture and tang were amazing!  Seriously great pie.

I followed the suggestion of people before me (4 egg yolks, 2 cans sweetened condensed milk, and 1 C lime juice) and also added some green food coloring to give the pie more of a lime look.  I thought the taste was delicious, but my mom and I both thought the texture seemed fluffier than what we were used to.  Overall, though, I thought it was very good.

After eating Key Lime Pie in Key West Florida, I came home wanting to make my own.  This is the best tasting and easiest to make.  I make it often in the summer time and everyone loves it.

I am by far not an experienced cook. I am, however, a lover of Key Lime pie.  I found this recipe and decided to give it a shot. I read a few of the reviews and made it using the following:  Two 14oz cans of fat free condensed milk, 10" pre-made graham cracker crust, RealLime juice. I messed up and used the egg white instead of the yolk (told you I am not a cook), but surprisingly it still turned out okay.  I baked it for 25 minutes like the reviewers said and it came out perfect. I chilled it overnight and had a piece for breakfast. DELICIOUS! I was a little "puffy" (which I think may have happened because of using the egg white instead of the yolk) but it was still wonderful.  I will definitely make another one ... this time using the yolk like it says. I am also going to try to add just a little more lime juice, as I really like my pies very tart.  All in all this is a keeper. I will be tweaking it just to see if I can get it as tart as I like ... but that is all.  Thanks to all who have contributed to the adjustments. It is great.

This was excellent!  Big hit with everyone.  The only thing I did was add 1/4 cup Splenda.  It had just the right amount of tart and sweetness.

This was not only easy, but the best tasting Key Lime pie I've ever had! I used only 4 egg yolks, 3/4 cup key lime juice, & 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, as others had suggested. If not for altering the original recipe I would have rated it 5 stars.

This is an awesome recipe. I have made it two different ways, first I messed the recipe up and used 5 whole eggs and to my suprise it came out delish (had more of a cheese cake consistancy)! The last time I followed the recipe to a T and it came out really good as well(more of a gelly consistancy). Both times I made the pie I used a little lime zest in the filling. Either way this is one great recipe!

I follow the original recipe except I use half lime and half lemon juice (no key lime in this part of the world), and it tastes so good. The second time I use 2 egg york and 2 eggs, instead of 5 yorks, and it still tastes the same. I went to Robuchon today and I tried his lemon pie, it tastes exactly the same with the same texture! My family is very surprise and think I am a world-class cook (LOL). Well, Robuchon's pie has an additional layer of sweet raspberry crust at the bottom of the pie, between the pie crust and the egg/lemon custard.I am thinking how to do that,cuz his is very impressive too.

I used four whole eggs (because that is all I had), reduced fat condensed milk, and a the entire 6 fluid ounces of concentrated limade (I like it tart).  I baked the pie for 30 minutes instead of 15 minutes.  I let it cool on the counter for one hour and put it in the freezer for two to speed up the cooling process.  It was perfect.

This pie is delicious and quite tart if you use the recommended version of 4 egg yolks, 2 cans sweetened condensed milk and 1 cup key lime juice.  I would suggest using the 10" pie crust rather than the 9" though, as I definitely had enough filling left over to fill one.  I hated to throw it away.

This really couldn't be any easier and absolutely to die for!  I let it chill for about 4 hours, topped with light cream and grated some lime peel over it.  Beautiful and yummy.

This was really good. I made the recommendations of the other reviewers and it turned out fantastic! I thought it tasted a little metallic...kind of like blood? I suppose it was just the tang of the key lime juice. It was still really good though.

The filling wasn't enough to fill even one graham cracker crust. It maybe filled it halfway, so you'd half to double the ingredients to get one pie. It was tart like I enjoy it,and suuuper easy to throw together. It was very creamy, and not "eggy" at all. You can't even tell they're in there.  I think once you fix the problem with the amount of filling, it's 5 star pie!

I live in Thailand where ovens are not very common so I cooked the filling on the stove-top for 15 minutes (constantly stirring!) to kill any possible salmonella and to help thicken the filling.  I also added a little bit of gelatin to ensure a firm set.  It turned out amazing!  I love this recipe and I will make it again and again!

I followed everyone else's suggestions, using 4 yolks, 2 cans of condensed milk, and 1 cup of juice.... 
It was too sweet!
If you are normally not a very sweet person, I would just use 1 or 1-1/2 can of condensed milk. Then use 2/3 cups of juice, and 4 yolks.
Baking time needs a bit longer than recipe, so just watch it.
Other than the sweetness, I liked it. I will definitely bake it someday again.

I made this recipe Friday night ( 11/7/08) for my family snd it was fabulous!! I will absolutely make it again! The recipe was easy and inexpensive I couldn't get key lime juice so I mixed equal amts of lemon and lime and I used a premade shortbread crust-it was smooth citrusy and rich. Better than some of the Key Lime pies that I had sampled in Fla. Thanks! :-)

Awesome & Easy!!!  I took people's suggestions and used 4 eggs, 1 cup key lime juice (fresh squeezed from my sister's tree) and 2 can of evaporated milk.  It was to die for.  Just enough sour & sweet.  I put it in a prepared deep dish graham cracker crust.

This pie was delicious but for some reason it was an icky mustard yellow color.  Not sure what happened (I used regular eggs and everything - not the omega 3 eggs that are much darker colored).  It was such an unappetizing color that no one would try it.  I'll probably try this recipe one more time though, because the picture for this recipe sure looks good, wonder what happened to mine...

Fantastic!!!  This is an extremely easy and great tasting pie.  I have made it twice.  The second time was better and I followed one of the tips given.  I used 2 cans of milk (eagle brand), a full cup of keylime juice 4 eggs and increased the cook time a bit.  Great pie, THANKS

I tried this recipe using Key Limes (took forever to get enough juice) and bottle lime juice.  I prefer the Key Limes as it made the pie more tart, less sweet.  My kids and husband like it with the bottled juice.  Either way, we all agreed that it was delicious!  This was a super easy recipe with fabulous results.  It tasted even better the next day, but good luck finding a piece left in the fridge.

I had been making this for years. I lost my recipe and could remember the items included but not the measurements. Imagine my suprise when I got on here and dug through TONS of "fake" Key Lime Pie recipes! Trust me..this one is GOOD AS GOLD! SUPER YUMMY! Top with HOME MADE whipped cream and it is like HEAVEN ON EARTH! YUMMMMMMY!

Very good and sooo easy! I used 4 egg yolks, one can of sweetened condensed milk, 1/2 cup of key lime juice and 6 premade mini graham cracker shells. The mix was just the right amount to fill the 6 crusts.  Baked as recipe says. They came out great. Thanks!

Easy to make.  Loved the creamy texture and the sweet, tart flavor.  My family liked it very much.  I used limes, didn't have key limes, but was still very good. perfect recipe for those who enjoy tart, sweet treats.  Thanks for sharing.

I thought that this pie was good, but I think that it would've been better if I'd stuck to the exact recipe. Here are the adjustments that I made: 1 cup fresh squeezed key lime juice and 3 tablespoons of sugar. The pie came out a little too tart for my tastes, so I think that I'll stick to the original recipe next time I make it :)

My first attempt at Key Lime Pie and it was fabulous! It was a little too tart for me so I will cut back on the lime juice a little the next time I make it, but when I went to get a slice the day after I made it, it was all gone... my fiance got to it before I could!

I thought this was good for how quick it was to fix, but I wish it had more of a lime taste and less of the sweetened condensed milk taste.

With the suggested reviewer changes (2 cans Milk, 1 cup juice, 4 egg yolks) this recipe is perfect. It took me almost an hour to bake this but that has to do with my oven. Even so it came out perfectly: I had enough to fill one pre-made pie shell plus 4 mini pie shells.

I made the recipe as stated, except I made my own crust and I used limes( key limes not available). It was very easy and fast to put together, it filled the pie crust well and my husband, who loves key lime pie, said it was very good. Will be keeping this recipe!
Thanks

Mmm... good! This was incredibly easy and oh so tasty! I was too lazy to squeeze 30 key limes as another review had done, so I tried the suggestion of 1/2 cup lemon, 1/2 cup lime juice from the bottles. It worked great, perfect amount of tartness.  I also followed other recommendations regarding the 2 cans sweetened condensed milk and 4 egg yolks. Everyone at our July 4th celebration loved it! Oh yeah, and homemade graham cracker crust makes all the difference.

Yum!  I really think this was the best key lime pie I have ever made. Grew up in Florida but am living in Texas it is hard to find a true South Florida key lime pie.... am so glad I used this recipe, reminds me of home.  I followed recipe, I also use the super easy graham cracker crust recipe but added a little shredded unsweetened coconut to crust, so good!

This is simply the best Key Lime Pie i ever tasted myself. The secret lies in the Limes used, its bitterness and quality. We bought Key Limes imported from Mexico and wow, great choice.

Key Lime Pie is my husband's favorite dessert and he said this was the best he has ever had.  My daughters loved it too.  This pie was so simple to make it seemed too good to be true.  I followed other's advice and used 2 cans of milk (one fat free) and made my own crust with low fat graham crackers and butter.  I was able to find the key lime juice in the grocery store where the cocktail mixes were.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!  I'll be making it again soon.

This pie is great!  I made the recommended changes (1 cup juice, 2 cans milk, 4 egg yolks).  There was enough filling for one pie and six mini-tarts/pies.  I also added a raspberry sauce on top (1/2 cup rasberries, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp lemon juice).

I have never had Key Lime Pie before.I used the 4 egg whites with 2 cans of condensed milk. It turned out good. It reminds me of lemon merengue pie! Having whip cream with it would make it great! I loved it!

Excellent! I used 4 yolks and 2 cans of SCM and increased the lime juice to even more than a cup. (1 1/3 or so!). Everyone loved the tart taste. An EXTRA thick graham cracker crust, baked in the oven to get toasty brown first, is a great balance with the creamy tart chiffon of the pie. Cool the crust for 20 minutes or so in the pie pan but on a cooling rack before adding the pie filling. Homemade whipped cream and the crowd went wild.

I love this pie.  I also like the fact that you bake it for 15 mins and you don`t have raw eggs in your pie.  I make it as lemon ice box pie also and my family loves it.

i should have followed others' advice and made 1 1/2 the filling. also, i couldn't find Key Lime juice so i used regular lime juice, which was ok, but i think i'll wait to make this again until i find Key Lime juice.

I am giving this 5 starts b/c it's great. However, I made 2 different versions, this one and "Key Lime Pie VIII" for friends and the other pie won hands down. This one is smooth and creamy, but very sweet - the other is just the right "sour". In making this one, definitely do: 1 c. lime juice, 4 yolks and 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk!

This is an awesome pie and it takes no time at all.  Everyone is always impressed that I made it and are thrilled when we leave them one. We now keep key lime juice on hand at all times, just in case the craving hits.

I decided to follow others and use 4 egg yolks 1 cup of lime juice and 2 cups of sweetened condensed milk. I needed to bake mine a little longer than the recipe called for, about 25 minutes and the pie came out perfect. I also could not find any key lime juice so I sqeezed key limes by hand. It took forever but it was well worth it. My boyfriend said it was an execellant pie and was very impressed!

If you're looking for a light, fluffy pie, look elsewhere.  There seem to be a lot of differing preferences when it comes to texture, and for those who want a creamy filling, this is the pie for you.  I used about 2/3C lime juice and the zest of half of my key limes, and then baked it about 5 minutes extra, and this still wasn't quite tart enough for me, but the flavor was out of this world.  The recipe I'm looking for has a bit lighter texture than this one does though, so although this was wonderful for a creamy dessert, I'm going to give Key Lime Pie  I a try, and see if that's a bit closer to what I had in mind.  

All in all, this makes for an amazing, creamy pie.

This pie tastes great.  Mine required a longer baking time and I was slightly disappointed with the consistency after cooling.  However, after having been refrigerated overnight, the consistency was perfect.

We enjoyed this key lime pie recipe. I did follow previous suggestions to use 1 1/2 cups of sweetened condensed milk and use more key lime juice. I used a combination between "bottled" key lime juice and fresh squeezed. Those key limes are quite small! :) 

My guests thought the pie was delicious and commented that it was very rich. I cut the pie into 8 slices, but could easily have given smaller slices and served more people from one pie. Thank you for the recipe, I will use it again.

I used bottled keylime juice (Nellie & Joes).  On the bottle the recipe calls for 3 egg yolks so I comprimised and used 4.  We liked the flavor, it was nice and tart.  The pie was a bit thin but I don't have the smaller pie pans.

Made some changes: 4 egg yolks, 1 1/2 cups condensed milk, 1 cup key lime juice (from the bottle) and lime rind for aesthethics.  I needed to bake mine longer than 15 minutes and the center should be a little jiggly when you take it out, it'll set once it cools.  Served with fanned strawberries.

This was AWESOME!  I made it with the 5 egg yolks, (it did not taste too "eggy" as some suggested) but did follow the recommendation for an extra 1/2 can of sweetened condensed milk.  YUMMY!!!  Don't add the green food coloring as others suggested...even one drop makes it look too fake!

This is the absolute best recipe for key lime pie! I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was perfect! The flavor and texture was so smooth and not harsh like most other recipes. I made a ginger snap crust, which complimented the lime flavor very nicely. Each slice was topped with a dollop of the Easy Whipped Cream recipe from this site.
This is a keeper.

This is a true key lime pie recipe!  I also decided to only use four eggs, as I do not like an "eggy" aftertaste nor did I feel comfortable using two cans of condensed milk (I used one and a half). I also used two tsp. of key lime zest--be sure not to grate down to the white parts. The result was a fabulous consistency with a perfect balance of sour and sweet, YUM!

What a beautiful pie!  I had never had this pie before, however I followed the popular advice of reviewers and used the 4 eggs yolks, 2 cans of condensed milk, and 1 cup of key lime - it turned out beautifully.  I couldn't leave the counter-top as it cooled!  I also added three drops of green food coloring, which my husband found to be a nice touch - again, a beautiful and easy recipe!

This pie is simple and delicious, and a perfect specimen of key lime pie!!!  I have made it countless times since discovering it here, my husband is forever grateful, and nobody has any idea how simple it was to make this when I serve it....they just think it's so exotic.  Thanks!!!!

Very easy to make. My husband LOVES this recipe. He prefers this over anything else he has tried. I use just a little less lime juice (freshly squeezed) - between 1/3 and 1/2 cup. This is a big hit every where it goes!!!

The perfect key lime pie.  I sometimes add green food coloring to make it more "lime" looking.  It's great served with a dollop of whipped cream on top.  Be sure to use freshly squeezed lime juice.  I like the flavor of key limes best...they're the small ones that often come sold in a bag.

This is a great pie!  I have doubled the recipe, and added ginger to my crust, made it in my spring form pan.  I am from Florida and everyone loves this pie.  Just make sure you make it early enough for it to cool.

A true 5 star pie.
Used 2 cans sweet condense milk, 1 cup lime juice, 4 egg yolks.  USE A LEMON JUICER!  It cuts way down on the juicing time.

This recipe was great.  I changed a few small things though.  I added about a tablespoon and a half of lime zest after I doubled the recipe.  I ran out of eggs after 8, so I just stopped there.  We didn't miss them at all.  I topped it with extra creamy Cool Whip.  Yum-my!

This tasted wonderful and was easy to make. I added the zest of two limes, but I don't think it was really necessary. I made it with a homemade regular crust. I might make more filling next time --it looked fine with the whipped cream on top, but I really liked the filling.

Perfect!!  I was so good and so easy.  The filling does not completely fill up the crust because it leaves you the perfect amount of room to add your homemade whipped topping.  I also didn't have key limes so I just used limes.

Too sweet and didn't have enough lime flavor, but after a couple of bites I didn't notice.  Very tasty.

Didn't quite fill the crust, might need to increase the recipe a bit.

DELICIOUS!! And, so easy. Took me about ten minutes to prepare. As I took it out the fridge once cooled hubby didn't believe me that I made it. He thought I bought it. LOL. So good with whipped cream. I didn't have enough bottled lime juice but I had fresh lemons and I used just over 1/2 cup of freshly squeezed. I bought the sweet pastry base to make it even easier.

The simplicity of this recipe makes it very appealing. But the finished product didn't have the 'bite' I expect in Key Lime pie. I think this could be easily overcome by increasing the lime juice and/or adding grated lime peel, as other reviewers suggest. All in all, this recipe is a keeper.

Easy and good. Honestly, it didn't have a very strong lime taste to me. If I were blind-folded I would have probably thought it was a lemon meringue pie (especially because I used the left-over egg whites to whip up into a meringue and topped it with that instead of coolwhip.) I like this version - a few ingredients make it a heck of a lot quicker and just as good or better than doing a long drawn-out cornstarch, sugar, milk version. I know I will make this again.

My first pie and it was DELICIOUS. I'm so proud of how perfectly this came out. Just the right balance of tartness and sweetness. I served with fresh, unsweetened whipped cream.

A tip for squeezing those tiny limes: I used my 1950s kitchen appliance the "Juice-O-Mat". It's a press juicer and it took no time to get a 1/2 cup. You can get these old juicers at a vintage shop where they sell kitchen stuff. These things were built to last and are better quality than the ones today, and it's non-electric. There are tons out there and they aren't expensive(I know, I'm a dealer).

This recipe is EVERYTHING Key Lime pie should taste like!!  It was perfect and I froze the few slices left and they defrosted and tasted great!!  I LOVE Key Lime pie and am thrilled to find a recipe that matches the exact taste I look for in this pie.

I started making this pie and realized I only had 4 eggs, but it turned out great. I took one of the other reviewers advice and used a garlic press for the limes.  I made a homemade crust and added a bit of grated lime zest to the filling. Perfect.

I used 4 eggs but followed the directions otherwise. I'm not a huge fan of key lime pie, but my husband said this was perfect. He showed me a handy tip too - slice your limes into wedges and then squeeze them with a garlic press. Easy!!

The most simple and delicious key lime recipe that I have ever used! I used fresh key limes rather than a bottled key lime juice and I thought that it was a perfect balance of sweet and tangy.

SOOOOO easy!  It was a hit at a picnic with several desserts...my pie was the FIRST gone!  I had to cook it an extra 5 minutes and I added a touch of water to the lime juice to calm my fear of the "too tart" comment!  Will add a picture once developed!  Used a cheese grater on the lime peel to make a pepper like garnish that I later dried and sprinkled on top of my whip cream design...what a hit!

This is a great key lime pie recipe. Some reviewers have commented that it is tart. Well, key limes ARE tart. That is the point of using key limes versus regular limes to make a key lime pie. So if a tart flavor is a turn-off, then don't use this recipe. Otherwise, it is FABULOUS and easy...especially for us key lime "purists" ;-)

This was such an easy and authentic recipe to make - the hardest part was squeezing the key limes (it took almost one whole bag, and I did it by hand - but worth it)!  My family raved about it...it was just the right amount of tart to sweet - I will definitely make this again.  I served it with cool whipe delicately frosted on top, and a few sliced key limes for decoration.  Great recipe!!!

This is a yummy pie!  I squeezed fresh limes and doubled the recipe.  I used one of those pie crusts that has 2 additional servings and the mixture doubled was perfect.  I also baked the pie for an additional 10 minutes or so and the middle was firm.  I made redi-whip topping and it was the perfect touch to match the tartness of the pie.  I will share this recipe!  Thanks!

This pie was great!  I wasn't able to find key lime juice, but I may try to order online for next time.  It was great anyways.  I accidently used a 10" pie crust, but I liked the extra graham cracker around the pie and the servings were still thick enough.  I just spread cool whip over the entire pie to help fill up the crust once it was cooled...delicious.  I'll be making this many times this summer!

This recipe is Excellent & Easy! Using Real Key Lime Juice makes all the difference. You can easily purchase it online for about $4.00/16 oz. (It has alot of other uses too!) Try it!

I'm lucky to be living in South Florida to have access to fresh key limes. This recipe is so simple, and exactly the way key lime pie should taste (and the way it should look--no green food coloring, please!!). If you have access to actual key limes, use them instead of just buying juice at the store, because they really do make a huge difference in the flavor of the pie.

I made this pie for a change in the Easter dinner rountine, it was wonderful.  I did not use key lime juice (couldn't find in local grocery)and cooked it for 5 minutes extra like others suggested.  Also, I served with cool-whip.  The empty pie plate spoke for itself!  Thanks a lot!

This is DELICIOUS!!  This recipe was so easy and so tasty.  We actually found a bag of key limes at the grocery store and fresh-squeezed them ourselves - it took about 10 to make half a cup of lime juice.

This was delicious and extremely easy. I cheated and did not squeeze all those limes!  I just bought the juice in the little green plastic lime in the produce dept.  It worked out well.  I do plan on trying to juice the limes some day.  I also added the green food color as another reviewer suggested--a nice touch of color.  Try using the "Graham Cracker Crust I" recipe also found on this site.  It was a crust that held together very nicely.  We enjoyed our pie topped with whip cream and are thrilled that we can make this pie in our own kitchen now.

This is exactly how key lime pie is supposed to taste, and it couldn't be easier!  I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about the pie so much they asked me to make it again for Christmas! As other reviews have noted, the crust-to-filling ratio is a bit high for this pie, so if you like more filling, just make a little extra. If this doesn't come out wonderfully, you're doing something wrong!!

Excellent recipe.  Made it for my friend's birthday and now I have to make it for every occassion there is.  Easy and delicious, made as single serving tarts and topped with whipped cream.  As a variation I also used Key Lime Juice mixed with Mango juice.  It was to die for, and just the perfect combination of sweet and sour.  No whipped cream required.

Delicious!  A hit with everyone. I live in Uzbekistan, so I had to make some changes based on availability of ingredients.  

I used lemons instead of limes, as no limes are available here in the winter.  I juiced them in an electric juicer, and then added about 2 teaspoons of lemon rind to the mix to increase flavor and tartness.  

I also used a homemade graham cracker shell that was briefly baked ahead of time.  It fell apart a bit, so I will have to work on that.

In any case, this is a delicious recipe and really easy to make.

This is NOT a keeper.  Made it for Thanksgiving and it was disappointing.  Love this website and it's almost always foolproof but this pie's filling was sort of gooey which is not how I think key lime pime should be.  Looking back what can you expect when the ingredients call for a whole can of sweetened condensed milk?? The pie oozes a bit and it does not cut cleanly, which I don't like.  The recipe on the bag of key limes was almost the same but I found this pie so-so.  I will try one of the other recipes that use whipped egg whites and/or tartar or maybe take more of a cheesecake angle.  This doesn't make the cut - would not be served in a good restaurant.

This is the easiest recipe ever!  My aunt gave me a huge bag of limes from her tree and I did a search to find a recipe to use them in.  After I refrigerated this pie and tried it, I made four more and gave them to friends!  My husband LOVES this and couldn't believe it when I told him 'it's as easy as scrambling eggs'.  I read a post that said the filling doesn't fill up the crust, but if you triple the recipe and use two crusts, it fills them right to the top... I prefer it a little lower though so you can taste the graham cracker crust.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I cant believe how EASY this pie is. I was craving one after watching a special on food tv, and the famous key lime pie guy said a good key lime pie has only three ingredients. So I searched and found this! It was wonderful. The perfect combo of tart amd sweet. I doubled it right then and there, because it was so easy, and made my neighbors very happy! One other thing, I bought a huge bag of key limes and discovered it only takes about 8 limes to make a half a cup!

Super pie-- super easy.. the only thing that was a pain was getting enough juice out of those tiny limes.  Served with Cool Whip-- it was perfect.

Very easy to make. A little too sweet for me. I had half a pie left over and I topped it with plain sour cream, it offset the sweetness perfectly.  Good recipe. Thank you

Easy,and Yummy!!! My husband had never had key lime pie before and was a little hesitant to try it, and he loved it.  I did make my own grahm cracker crust which was really good after being baked because of the butter in it.

1 alteration: increase baking time by 5 minutes.
Also, I have made the recipe both with the "changes" proposed by reviewers and the original way.  Both are delicious but the changed recipe makes way too much filling, you end up throwing some away.  That recipe would be good if you had an extra large pan.

Very delicious, nice consistency (creamy, but firm enough to be cut). It was a little shallow for my pie dish, but that was easily amended by topping it with cool-whip and garnishing with lime slices. I will be serving this for simple afternoon brunch--easy and perfect for the occasion. 

The lime key juice I used had a recipe on the bottle that called for 3 egg yolks instead of 5. I compromised with 4.

SUPER EASY and QUICK. It didn't last at all. Awesome taste but I had a hard time finding key lime juice. I ended up using lime juice instead. I wish it had a more green color, maybe add green food coloring next time. Can I use any key lime juice or the concentrated kind?

This is one of the easiest recipes I've ever made, and it turned out great - very creamy and not too heavy and with a great flavor! I made the recipe as is without any modifications - just topped it with whipped topping and small slices of lime for decoration. My office devoured it in about an hour. My husband and I just returned from Key West, and this was as good as the pie we ate when we were there. I would definitely make this one again.

This is a perfect summer dessert- cool, tangy sweet and oh-so-easy.  I followed the recipe exactly and served it with whipped cream.  Next time I make it, I will top it with meringue just like they do at the Blond Giraffe in Key West.  Thanks for a great recipe : )

This came out good.  I used 3 eggs instead of 5 and added the zest of 1 key lime...yum.  Then I topped it with whipped topping.  It's a winner.

I thought I had two cans of sweetened condensed milk, but alas, I did not.  I filled the gap with whipped cream and no one was the wiser!  We can get bottled key lime juice here in MI.  Beats the heck out of squeezing all those little key limes...  Definitely a keeper!

Delicious and so easy!  Took about 5 minutes to make (aside from baking time).  I'll definitely be making this one again!

This is REALLY good pie!  I am not crazy about graham cracker crust, so I make it with equally as easy Buttery Crunch Crust, also from this site.

Since this was my first attempt at a Key Lime Pie, I did not change the recipe except to add green food coloring.
Like the other reviews warned, this did not fill my 9" pie crust, but I just made a quick meringue with the egg whites, cream of tartar and Sweet & Low (was out of sugar) & it turned out fine.  I didn't bake it as long (about 8 minutes less) because the meringue was getting too brown, but after letting it set in the fridge overnight the consistancy was great and the flavor was wonderful!  I didn't think it was to tart...the sweetness of the graham cracker crust really balanced it out.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

This is a definite chart-busting hit.  Easy, quick, and delicious.  Just the right balance of sweet and tart.  As an experiment, I'm going to try it with lemon juice too.  Wish me luck!

A HIT! I added about 4 t lime zest to the custard and let it sit in the refrigerator for an hour.  Then I strained the mixture before pouring into crust.  The ultimate touch: add a layer of grated high quality white chocolate between the crust and the custard.  YUM!

This is so easy and good.  Be sure to use fresh lime juice though.  I used bottled, and I didn't think that it was as good that way.

Very easy and so tasty. It's been a hit with everyone I've made it for. I added a little extra lime juice because I like my key lime pie to be  tangy. If you do that, cook for a few minutes longer. Excellent!

Absolutely incredible.  This pie was so easy and fast that I will definitely be making it again.  I followed the suggestions of others and used two cans of milk, 4 yolks, and almost one cup of lime juice.  I used fat free condensed milk and a reduced fat crust.  You couldn't taste the difference.  Great recipe!!!

I just tried this today, and I think it is great, but I would really prefer a Key Lime Pie with a little more substance, I didn't think it was firm enough. I may try baking it for just a bit longer next time, maybe it will firm up.

I agree that it does not fill the pie crust enough.

I too used 2 cans of milk, 4 egg yolks & 1 cup lime juice.  It was fantastic!  Everyone loved it.  I've already made 3, and will be making another one tonight.  People just can't get enought of it!  My 7 year old daughter loves the original recipe, so i'll be making both versions.

I topped this with a nice thick layer of whipped topping and served it with sugared lime slices.  Delicious, with just the right amount of tartness/sweetness.  A good summer dinner party dessert!  Thanks!

Being from Florida, I know what good key lime pie is...and this was great!  Real key lime pie is suppose to be tart and NOT green.  This recipe is right up my "cooking alley"...simple!  The family loved it.

This was so easy! I used an 8 inch graham cracker pie shell...perfect size! Some green food coloring brought it to the perfect color! I made it for Easter...it was the first dessert to be finished! My husband has already asked me to make another pie just for him!

I like my Key Lime Pie very tart, so I too used 4 egg yolks, 2 cans of condensed milk and 1 cup of lime- and it was perfect! I used a ready made shortbread crust because it's more subtle that graham and I liked the way it turned out. There's also plenty of custard to fill the entire crust made this way.

I've had alot of luck with the recipies on this site, but this was the first LET-DOWN.  It was quick and easy to prepare and would be a good choice for cooking with children.  However, add lots of GREEN FOOD COLORING.. otherwise it's a very un-attractive color.  Overall, the taste leaves something to be desired, I will not be making this again.

I followed most of Shrae1's advice: 4 yolks, 1.9 cans sweetened condensed milk (I just didn't scrape every last drop out of the 2 cans), 1 c key lime juice, and it fits perfectly into a 10-inch pie pan. As an Arizonan, I'm not sure how much my opinion counts, but I much prefer a shortbread crust (Quick & easy: cream 3/4c butter with 1/3c powdered sugar, add 1-1/2c of flour & pinch of salt, pat into pie pan & bake at 325 for 15 minutes or until slightly browned)

I had lots of limes and tried this recipe. This is a good recipe but I don't think I like key lime pie. I'm a cake person, I guess. Please, this is not a slight on the pie... it turned out well and DH liked it but I prefer cinnamon. LOL!

This is a great base recipe.  With only 3 ingredients for the filling I couldn't resist playing around.  It was so very good, and it couldn't be easier.  Who would have known I could find something so delightful already in my pantry.  Thanks again AllRecipes.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe.  It was easy to make, but was way too tart.

I'm a culinary arts major and I just made this pie with some fresh key lime juice I brought back from Florida and it was awsome! This is the best tasting key lime pie I have ever had! This is without a doubt 5 stars!

I used to buy those pies by Mrs. Smiths that cost eight dollars a pop, but this recipe changed all of that!  This pie was not only easy, and fast, but with whipped cream, it was VERY tasty!! I would recommend it to anyone who likes GOOD Key Lime Pie!

Just can't beat it! After growing up on the Keys, and eating this favorite all my life, I must recommend this exact recipe to everyone. Recently tried the recipe found on a bottle of key lime juice, which was not good and ended up a runny mess. Thanks Pat Legler!

My best friend loves Key Lime pie so I made this recipe for her on her birthday last year. Needless to say, it's a year later and she's made a birthday request for the same Key Lime pie. It's easy and delicious!

This is a great keylime pie!  Be careful if you shop from the "shopping list" feature!  It says 7 key limes.  The recipe calls for 7 tablespoons of key lime juice!  Very quick and easy and tastes wonderful!

This is a very easy and quick recipe.  The end product is creamy and smooth.  The only thing that I might change next time would be to add 1 or 2 tablespoons more of lime juice for a slightly tarter taste.  I will be making this recipe again.

I shouldn’t rate this because I did make the same changes I read in other reviews. I used 4 egg yolks and 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk and 3/4 cup lime (not key lime) and 1/4 lemon. We loved it. I think next time I will try it exactly the way the recipe says just to see.

This is a wonderfully simple and delicious recipe! My family loves it at holidays. It deserves five stars exactly as it is. It’s all just preference, people! So the great part is that after you make it once, it’s easy to tweak if you like it a little more tart or a little more sweet. Note that if you end up using a pre-bought graham cracker crust, this recipe isn’t quite enough filling,  so you will need to make more (I use additional sweetened condensed milk and lime juice, and stuck with the four egg yolks). Delicious!

Used 5 egg yolks, 1 can condensed milk, and 1/c cup juice (1/4 lemon & 1/4 lime). Very good. However next time, would increase juice to 3/4 cup if not full 1 c (lemon & lime).

I actually made this with 1/2 cup lemon juice as my key lime juice I bought was brown and didn’t smell good. Everything else was the same. I do not care for graham cracker crust so I used a regular pie crust. I intend to top it with homemade whipped cream once it cools!

I made this and used the modified ingredients.  I liked it, but it was a bit rich.  So next time I will try it without the modifications (1 can vs 2 can of condensed milk and 4 yokes vs 5.

WOW! I used 5 yolks, 2 cans of condensed milk, 2/3 c fresh squeezed key lime juice and made my crust with graham crackers. This pie turned out absolutely amazing. I was going to post a photo but it was gone before I had a chance to take it.

While I see many people drastically alter this recipe and still give it five stars, I am going to rate the recipe as it is written. 
This pie is WAY too heavy and WAY too sweet. 
The recipe says to combine the ingredients and "mix well" but with five egg yolks, lime juice, and sweetened condensed milk there's no airiness at all. Perhaps it's needs to be whipped or beaten.  As-is,  this pie is as dense as a pudding snack. But sweeter.

This is so far, my favorite version of a key lime pie; however, I only it a 4-star rating because there are some adjustments I make that I think make it a 5-star pie. 
First—personal preference, of course—I use traditional (homemade) pie crust instead of graham cracker crust. 

I also zest the limes and add about 1 1/4 tsp zest to the filling and set 1/2 tsp aside for topping.

And when I juice the limes, I add maybe a tsp or so of the lime pulp to the filling as well. 
And I increase the lime juice amount slightly, using somewhere between 1/2 c and 3/4 c.

Once it’s baked and cooled, I smear whipped cream (freshly made, not pre-made) across the whole pie and sprinkle the left over zest on top. 

It’s delicious!

Extra superlative! I am so happy to have such a fool proof recipe. So tangy, and easy beyond words. These are ingredients I keep in my pantry, so I love these kinds of recipes. Thank you for sharing  such a winner!

So delicious and super easy peasy to make! I used 4 egg yolks, 3/4 c. of lime juice and 1/4 c. of lemon juice so it can be nice and tart and 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk. Mixed all the ingredients very well and put that bad boy in the oven. I had to leave it in for 25 minutes. Next time, while the pie is baking, I'll make merigue and then put it on the pie the last 5 minutes. Sooooo good, my family loves it!

Easy and tasty. Only had 4 eggs, set fine. Valentines desert, he liked it. Tart, we ate very small piece with whipped cream. Should last, very rich along with tart. Will make again. Think this will be a favorite for family gatherings and holidays. I made the crust (super easy and use better ingredients without preservatives) and made a thicker crust to help balance crust and filling tartness. I read on Allrecipes somewhere to use 1/2 lemon 1/2 lime juice, tastes authentic. Homemade whipped cream, we don’t eat processed whip topping for obvious reasons.

I had a lot of regular limes (not key limes) left over so decided to make this pie.  I pretty much followed the recipe except for the crust as I didn't have enough graham wafer crumbs to make a crust so I added ground almonds and a bit of flour which turned out great.  Super easy pie to make and only 15 minute s in the oven!

I made this key lime pie for the first time never having made key lime pie before. I did as most all of the reviewers said to use 4 egg yolks, 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk and 1 cup of key lime juice. I did use the Nellie and Joe’s key lime juice and it was easy to find. I used an organic ready made graham cracker crust. It did need to bake 25 to 30 minutes. It was absolutely delicious. It was so easy too! I am making it for a second time for Christmas Eve dinner hoping I get the same delicious results. I did top with a little whip cream.

I did double the filling amount with 4 egg yolks but that left a lot of the filling to go to waste.
I tempered the eggs and it seemed to turn out correctly but I wasn't impressed with the taste.
I couldn't find the key lime juice so I used 1/2 fresh squeezed lime and 1/2 lemon and 1 T lime zest.
I made my own graham cracker crust but it seemed pretty thick and hard.
 I don't think I will try it again.

After I read some of the reviews, I adjusted the recipe by reducing egg yolks to 4, adding 1 more can of sweetened condensed milk and increased the lime juice to 1 cup. I let it cool and chill in the fridge for about an hour and couldn't hold the grandson off any longer!  Will definitely use this easy and tasty recipe again!.

(Giving 4 stars only because I did make changes - result was 5 stars!) I made this recipe for Mother's Day this weekend and everyone said it was the best key lime pie they'd ever had!  Condensed milk comes in 300g cans where I live so I used two of those and it was the perfect amount. I did double the lime juice as recommended, mostly because I couldn't smell the lime with just a half cup. I didn't have key limes available so I used about a 60/40 split lime juice and lemon juice (freshly squeezed). Oh I also added a couple teaspoons of lime zest, I think that punched up the flavour and gave it some green colour! Remarkably easy recipe, will make again!

If you're looking for simplicity, this is about as simple as you can get without doing the cringe-worthy powdered mix. It should be noted... If you want a finished pie, you should probably bake it for 20-30 minutes depending on your oven. Just watch the pie. Once you start seeing bubbles break the surface, it's ready to come out (the edges should be a slightly darker color than the center). Take it out and let it cool on top of the oven/stove, since it'd still be "cooking" for 5-10 minutes after you take it out.

I changed up the recipe ever so slightly by adding 2/3rd cup of key lime juice. With 1/2 cup it wouldn't have been properly tart. People really underestimate the power of condensed milk when it comes to adding juices. I was able to make 4 pies and top them with whipped cream (they were fine without it, but eh, aesthetics), all for 16 dollars. It was easy to make too, with the worst part being the egg separation for obvious messy reasons.

my very first key lime pie and came out amazing. I read the previous reviews and used 4 eggs yolks instead of 5.  I used 1/2 a cup of lime juice and followed the remaining exact recipe. Everyone loved it!!

Please READ! This recipe is only meh, unless you use FRESH squeezed lime juice and include the zest of the limes! Using bottled lime juice will yield a pie that tastes like floor cleaner. 
I’ve made this same pie several times every summer for at least a decade, and everybody loves it. If you want to make it really exceptionally delicious do the following:
- Make your own graham cracker crust (1.5 cups of graham crackers, ground fine, six tablespoons melted butter, 1/4 cup sugar, baked at 375 for 8 minutes and cooled).
- Use fresh limes and their zest (4-6 limes yield a half cup)
-  combine the filling ingredients in a BLENDER. This way the zest gets ground up very fine and the condensed milk, egg yolks and juice are emulsified so that the filling is smooth and slightly aerated.
- Do Not Over Bake. Should still have some jiggle in the middle
- Top with lightly sweetened FRESH whipped cream. NOT cool whip. Yuck.

This recipe was so easy. I had my doubts when I saw how few ingredients there were. But gave it a try and it's hands down the best pie I've ever had. And let me tell you I've had a few ;) The popular manta- "K-I-S-S" , or "keep it simple stupid" is certainly true here.

After reading lots of reviews/advice, I tweaked it a bit to my liking. Used 4 egg yolks, 1.5 cans of condensed milk, 3/4 cup key lime juice. Next time, I'll add more key lime juice. Make sure you mix very well as the eggs will leave  a trail of yellow in the pie sometimes.I increased baking time to 20-22 minutes and make my own crust. Yummo!

It was delicious! I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, 1/2 Cup of key lime juice and 5 eggs. I enjoyed squeezing the key limes with my juice presser. I baked it in an unbaked graham cracker crust and it came out delicious, very sweet and tart.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as it is and it was pure perfection. I juiced 1lb of fresh key limes using my KitchenAid mixer's juicer attachment to get the freshest juice. I did not make any alterations except adding two drops of green food coloring to make it look a little more festive. I took this pie to a work potluck and it was devoured in less than 20 minutes. Everyone raved about it and enjoyed it. This recipe, and its prep/cooking instructions, are perfect as-is and will be a go-to for me in the future.

I don't know if it makes a difference but I beat my egg yolks for 2-3 min til pale and fluffy. Gradually added the condensed milk and beat til light and fluffy 3-5 min. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the key lime juice. Poured it into a gram cracker crust and baked for 15 min. Cooled completely and covered with cool    
whip . chill for 8 hrs. Don't know if I just make it complicated for myself or not but it turned out great

Delicious! The only variation I made was using local limes (no key limes available) for the juice.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written and it was delicious! This is such an easy and tasty recipe, I can't wait to make it again.

As per reviews I used 4 egg yolks and 2 tins of condensed milk with only 1/2 cup of lime juice. The pie was too sweet for my taste and lacked the tartness of a key lime/lime pie.

 However my guests liked it. Hence the 4 stars. Next time I will use 1 cup lime juice.

Delicious. Followed the altered recipe. Used 1/2 cup fresh lime juice with the zest. One can of sweetened condensed milk, 4 egg yolks. I didn't think it would turn out as thick as it did. Held together very well. I ate it warm and it was still very good.

3 things that I changed that my Floridian husband says make it the best he’s ever had.
1. Bake a regular pie crust until almost done and use that instead of graham crackers
2. Increase the lime juice to 3/4 cup.
3. I do not put meringue on it. Instead we serve it with ice cream, italian ice, or whipped cream.

Wow- I thought this was going to be a go-to pie recipe after I read the reviews but I was very disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly, using fresh key limes, and I even made my own graham cracker crust from scratch.  Firstly, there was not nearly enough filling to fill the crust, so it had a skimpy look.  But what really got me was the flavor.  I served it with a dab of whip cream on top to hide the lack of filling, but the filling was very bitter.  I'm not sure I could alter this recipe to improve it.  The best part of the pie was my graham cracker crust.  I'll be searching for a different recipe....

I made many of the changes recommended by other reviewers.  I used 4 large eggs (all of them, not just yolk), 2 (14 oz.) cans of sweetened condensed milk, 1 cup of fresh squeezed lime juice (I did use one lemon), and a 9 1/2" graham cracker pie crust.  The cook time was 40 minutes at 375 degrees F.  It was amazing!

I followed the other suggestions and used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, 1 lemon, the rest lime juice to equal 1C of juice and 4 yolks. AMAZING.

I took the advise of Shrae1 and it turned out amazing, Thank you!!!

This is the best! Being a Floridian, I have had my share of both very good and very bad Key Lime Pie. I did make a few changes to the recipe after reading the reviews. I only used 4 egg yolks, I used 2 cans sweetened condensed milk, and I used 1 cup key lime juice. Hint**If you can not find any key lime juice then just use equal parts lemon and lime juice (best if fresh). These adjustments will make more filling than needed, but the texture and taste is better. I had to increase my baking time by 15 minutes. I prebaked my redi-crust and this came out great. The new #1 key lime pie for my family.

Solid recipe! I added a little green food coloring to make it look more green. The pie ended up a little too soft in the middle, and maybe it's just the oven I was using, but it's worth considering baking it just for another one or two minutes. Also, the recipe doesn't make enough batter to fill an entire pre-made graham cracker pie crust. I recommend filling this space with CoolWhip once the pie has cooled down. Not only was it tasty, but when you slice into it, you get a two pretty layers.

I am currently in the process of making this over (at 10:30pm after a second trip to the grocery store).  I must present words of warning:  If you have made your own crust, 9 inch pan, you MUST double the recipe and account for longer cooking time.  The standard recipe only filled half of the pie crust.  This would have been an EMBARRASSING sight to present at my upcoming family barbecue.  I baked the "baby pie" anyways so that my husband and I could eat it, and 15 minutes is nowhere near enough bake time.  It tastes great though!!

I made it just as the recipe is written. Fresh lime juice and a homemade gram cracker crust. This is a very tart pie. We loved it! You could add a whip cream topping  to cut down the tartness, but we loved the fact that is was tart. Easy to make and stays fresh with just a loose wax paper on top in the refrigerator. I will make this again.

Super easy to make.  Great flavor.  I shred some lime skin into the batter for an additional tartness.

I made this twice recently. First, I  took other reviewers' suggestion and used 4 egg yolks and 1 Cup of key lime juice. I was so loose and watery I had to bake it for 10 more minutes. Second time, I followed the recipe as written, beating the yolks well, adding the sweetened condensed milk, beating well again, then adding and beating the key lime juice. It was perfect after the 15 minute baking time. Everybody loved it. I grated lime zest as a garnish instead of using lime slices. I don't like inedible garnishes and it accented the flavor.

Wish I could try with fresh key limes but they aren't sold here so I use the bottled juice. The lime zest makes a huge difference, its worth running out for a lime. I make with graham cracker crust from the site.

So I figured i would give making a Key Lime Pie a shot.  Seperated my 5 eggs yokes, added 5 ounces of bottled lime juice, 1 14 ounce can of sweetned condensed milk.  Looking at other reviews I saw that others added zest from fresh limes so I added that to the mixture and once it was done I added some more on top.  It wasn't till after I put the pie in the oven that I realized i used egg whites and not egg yokes.  Well, it was very good, lighter version (though i have nothing to compare it to) of the pie according to my sister in law and husband who have had it before.  Topped with fresh whipped cream, it was a huge success! Now to make it for myself with gluten free crackers!!

I will definitely make this again.  Ingredients and directions are simple.  I made it almost as it.  I had regular lime juice, so I added about 1/2 of a fresh squeezed lemon to make it more "key lime".  I used the leftover egg whites along with 4 tbs sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla to make a meringue for the top. I had to cook it 10-15 minutes more after I added the meringue topping.  My husband asked where I bought it because it was so pretty.

I had never even tasted a key lime pie before making this one.  I wanted something different other than the traditional butterscotch or chocolate.  This was a perfect taste and just what I expected it to be.  Recipe is perfect the way it is.  My mom and sis even loved it too.  Yummy!!

Best recipe I've found yet! I had to used regular limes instead of key limes due to lack of availability. It turned out a little too tart so I might add a touch of sugar next time. But overall, great easy recipe!!

I made this recipe using the changes suggested. 4 yolks, 2 cans cond. milk and 1 cup lime juice. I used an oversized graham crust I found. I cook it for 15 minutes. It is very tasty and creamy. Very easy and it turns out perfect every time.

Made as suggested in the reviews. 4 eggs, 2 cans condensed milk, and 1 cup key lime. Also pre baked my crust for only 10 minutes but once cooled filled with key lime goodness and baked for 25 minutes. It was a hit even with super duper picky kids...

I have already made this recipe twice. I just loved it!!!!. The first time I used a bigger pan after reading the other reviews I decided to double the condenced milk and keep the amount of eggs. I also added the zest from one or two limes. Perfect. The second time I used 3 egg yolks and followed the rest of the recipe.. Still perfect!!! I am going to make it again and again and again......

This recipe is so easy and yummy.  I make it with a home made Graham crust - really worth the effort for the taste - (I also grate some lime zest into the crust plus add some zest to the finished pie. It gives it a zing!

I have made this pie several times, and it's a hit with everyone. I recommend doubling the condensed milk. Just added another quarter cup lime juice and it was great.  I didn't add any more eggs and the consistency was great.

This is my FAVORITE Key Lime Pie recipe. My friend who owns Rock 'n Java in Cozumel gave me the ingredients she uses in her KLPs for the restaurant and I found this one to use for the ratios. EVERYBODY loves it. I've used a hand mixer and I've used a Vitamix. I've made it so many times that I don't know what I might have done differently each time but I've had it come out fluffyish and I've had it come out custardy which I've been told traditional KLPs are supposed to be. They were ALL very much enjoyed so I have ZERO complaints. If you want a light creamy pie, I suggest you find a recipe that calls for whipped cream or sour cream or egg whites. Oh, I make the crust with almond flour instead for a gluten free alternative, when my nut allergic son is not partaking, I add a few coarsely chopped pecans to crust and er'body goes NUTS for it. -pun intended :) Unfortunately, I have not found a keto recipe that I like, so for now, I just stick to cheesecake for a low-carb dessert. Enjoy!!!

Warning: Don't over cook!  If you do, it will separate and get a grainy/lumpy,  kinda curdled texture. It still tastes great but is not smooth and creamy.

I made this three times lately from Key Limes my neighbor gave me. It was so delicious and simple to make that I took two to Thanksgiving dinner at my sister-in-law's house.

Everyone one loved them even the person who had never tasted it before

Holy tartness!  while my husband was able to eat his whole piece, this was not something that we want to make again.  If anything, I will make the changes that many reviewers did to customize this recipe.   I do hope that the other way makes it taste much better.

The only reason I'm giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is because I'm a bit skeptical of the quantity of custard it makes. I've made this pie twice- the flavor is amazing, the texture is wonderful, but I find it hard to believe that the recipe makes enough custard for a 9 inch pie pan. I've had to double it each time- once with a pre-made Keebler crust and once with a homemade crust in a standard 9 inch glass pie plate. Both times, the recipe as stated barely filled half the pie shell. Doubling it is no hardship- it's a fantastic pie and deeper slices mean more yumminess!  Just double the baking time to 30 min and watch it closely for browning (which is a no-no). Also, someone suggested using a garlic press to squeeze the teeny key limes, and it works like a charm!!

I don't know what happened but my pie came out mushy and lumpy like oatmeal. I did 1 cup of lime juice 4 egg yolks two cans of condensed milk. I left it in the oven for 15 minutes but it didn't look at all cooked so I left it for almost 45 minutes and it came out like oatmeal so I gave up

Delicious, make it all the time. I use 1 cup of key lime juice or 1/2 cup lemon juice, 1/2 cup lime juice combined ( when key limes are not in season) - you cannot tell the difference - 4 egg yolks and 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk as many other cooks recommended.

I've made this recipe 3 times and it needs a bit of adjusting. I only used 4 yolks and added 1 1/2 cups heavy cream in addition to the condensed milk. Using real key limes - app 12-14 tastes much better than lime juice. Do not be afraid to add a little lime pulp w the juice. I bake for 15-17 minutes and chill thoroughly. No complaints from my family.

Great recipe!  I like it a bit more tart, and you can add whipped cream or a dusting of powder sugar (if you're not a big whipped cream fan)as a garnish if it's not sweet enough.  I used 4 egg yolks, 3/4 cup of fresh squeezed key lime juice instead of the listed amount.  I also added 1 tsp of lime zest.  It makes it that much more "lime" intense.  Everyone loves it!

First key lime pie I ever made. Turned out excellent!  I did increase the lime juice to 1 cup and added another can of condensed milk because I was using a bigger pie plate. I think the recipe amount would be fine if you are using a small pre-made crust.

I never had key lime pie until I made this. Suspicious because it was so easy, I had some try it who loves Key Lime pie and she thought it was outstanding. The hardest part is juicing the limes. I did make this regular limes once and could not tell the difference. I usually get the Key Limes, though, as a matter of form.

I saw a review here which mentioned that this pie came out like a very dense cheesecake when they tried it, and I'm afraid I had the same problem.  The flavor is good, but the texture is not what I'd wanted at all.  I used the user adaptation that calls for 4 egg yolks, 2 cans sweetened condensed milk, 1 cup lime juice, and baking it for 'twice as long' (I did exactly 30 min) at the exact temperature suggested.  This was the first key lime pie I've made, and the recipe doesn't tell you how full to fill the crust, so I had to guess, and filled it to about 1 cm below the top.  When I took it out of the oven, the edges of the filling were slightly brown, and the middle was very elevated, jiggly, and far less cooked than the outsides.  The texture is not silky smooth like every other key lime pie I've tried all my life, so as a native Floridian I was disappointed. After looking around some websites, it sounds like some people prefer this thicker texture, but I didn't realize key lime pie even comes this way so I'm going to try a different recipe next time, perhaps even a no-bake one if it's the eggs that made the texture bad in this one.

Not bad, but I do have to agree with everyone who stated that there is not enough lime flavor.  I'll add lime zest next time, but this is easy enough it's worth trying again.  I made my own crust with leftover cookie crumbs and melted butter, then prebaked for about 18 mins at 375.  I also halved this recipe since I had half a can of sweetened condensed milk after using the first half for another recipe.  I used mini pie pans we received as wedding gifts and half the recipe made 4 pies.  The baking time was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

A super easy, fast to make pie.  I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, 1 c. of lime juice and 4 egg yolks.  I suspect 5 might have made it a bit more firm.  Then I divided it between 2 pie crusts.  A quick dessert.  Wasn't Chloe's fave, but the rest of us liked it.

I followed the recipe with one exception, I grated about a tablespoon of Lime rind into the pie filling. I made real whip cream. 2 Cups of whipping cream with 6 tablespoons of confectionery sugar. The pie was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe1

Great pie! I followed some of the review suggestions. Pre-baked the graham cracker crust for 10 minutes.  I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, 4 egg yolks and 3/4 fresh squeezed key lime juice. Added some zest on top too. Beautiful and super yummy! Key lime is my husband favorite dessert and he LOVED this pie. Our son has a nut allergy and so many of the commercial pies are processed in a factory with nuts. So, it is nice to find a delicious recipe like this I can make for the entire family. One that is yummy and safe.

I should've followed the true recipe instead of the reviews. 1 cup of lime juice made it way too tart. I will try it again but I will give this recipe 5 stars.

Amazing recipe! I made a lighter version using 2 cans of fat-free condensed milk, low fat sour cream, and reduced fat crust. It came out amazing! Definitely put some whipped topping on top. 

The tip by another reviewer to juice the key limes using a garlic press was brilliant. Saved me a lot of time!

This was a great basic recipe. However, I think it was missing some "zing." It wasn't quite lime-y enough for me, so maybe I will add some lime zest next time!

I wasn't too impressed with this myself, but everyone else seemed to enjoy it.  I too had the problem of not enough filling.  If I make it again, I will add the 2nd can of condensed milk as others have suggested.

Everyone who ate this pie loved it! I added mint and it turned out extra refreshing. I didnt even use Key-Limes, just 3 regular ones and I included the zest as well. Yumm.

I made this recipe with the following modifications: used 2 egg yolks instead of 5 egg yolks.  I thought it tasted fantastic.  I had to squeeze 1 lb of key limes to make 1/2 C of key lime juice.  I topped the pie with 1C of sweetened whipped cream.

This recipe was delicious, and so so easy! The whipped topping is a must, the pie is a bit too tangy for my taste without it. Very refreshing and will be perfect in the summertime.

it was a bit too sweet for me... and i added more lime juice, almost 1 cup of lime juice to add more tang.  it was pretty yummy overall though.  i also added a meringue topping, since i had the leftover egg whites.  it was an easy and quick recipe to use. 1/4 cup of fine sugar to every one egg white.... :)

I followed the reviews and only did 4 yolks. I did not use 2 cans of condensed milk. I added lime zest and 2 drops of green food coloring. I chilled my crust and filling before baking. Tasted delicious! Turned out awesome! I've made 4 using this combination and all were fantastic. Great recipie!

This is the best recipe for Key Lime Pie! I know it would be "better" if I had used real key lime juice but I just used the squeeze lime juice and it was great! I sometimes add a little lemon juice for an extra tartness.

Pie was good and simple to make.  I used egg whites and 2 whole eggs.  BEWARE not to use a juicer for this!  Stick to old fashioned hand squeezing.  My juicer made it taste bitter and pithy.

So simple, and one of the best key lime pies I've ever had. I didn't have quite enough lime juice, so I topped off the remainder (probably only a couple tablespoons) with Simply Lemonade, and I do think that helped give it a little bit of a unique flavor. I loved it.

Amazing! I've tried 3 different recipes, and this one is the easiest and the best! Can't go wrong with easy. I love the natural color, who would put green coloring in their pie?  I also used 4 eggs and it turned out great. I used a shortcrust instead of graham and it was marvelous!

Very easy, very good.  My citrus loving daughter loved this pie and practically ate the entire thing herself.  Great recipe when you have yolks to use up, as I did after making a white cake that only called for egg white.

I made this pie for my husband's b'day this month, and had never made Key Lime Pie before. I made it with the 4 egg whites, 2 cans of Fat Free Sweetened Condensed Milk, 1 cup of lime juice and made my own graham cracker crust. It was THE best key lime pie I have ever had,and my husband says that it was to him, also. It was so easy, lower in fat than the typical Key Lime Pie, and absolutely worth making. I am not even usually a big Key Lime Pie lover, but I loved this one.

I made this using regular limes, 4 eggs--as recommended by many users--and with adding zest. I also added the meringue topping from Lemon Meringue Pie III and the Shortbread Crust form this site. I had to bake the cake, though, for an extra 15 minutes and then left it in the oven (B/c I had to run out and frankly forgot to take it out). But even though it was still kind of warm and runny when we got home, it was still REALLY good. I made a tin foil tent over the cake for the last 15 minutes so the meringue wouldn't brown any more than it had already in the first 15 minutes. I will def. make this again. Next time, I'll bake for the first 15 min. without the meringue and then take it out, apply the meringue, and then put it back in for another 15 minutes.

wow wow wow. Amazing pie. Perfect combination of awesome taste and foolproofness. I used 2 cans of condensed milk, 1 cup of lime juice and 4 yolks as well as a bit of lime rind. I made a graham cracker, butter and oatmeal crumbly crust and the result is just amazing. I baked the crust for 6 minutes before filling and 20 min with the filling. I then refrigerated for a few hours. Thanks for sharing, definitely one of the best recipes I have tried in this website.

I tried to use this to make mini-pies in the mini muffin pan. They turned out VERY yummy, but the bottom was a little too buttery/greasy. Probably all my fault, but the filling was spot-on for a key lime pie.

Yummy! Just made it today! The ONLY thing I did differently is that I used more Key lime juice. 5 EGGS IS JUST FINE!!!! No soggy crust! Did Not  use 2 cans of the sweetened condensed milk either. Baked for 25 minutes. Great recipe!:)

Great recipe and very easy. I strongly suggest the modified recipe as described in previous reviews. Also the pie was too tart for me (but not for my guests!) I will reduce the amount of key lime juice next time for a sweeter pie. Would note that pie is still very soft after 30 min baking but solidifies nicely when chilled. Do not over bake. Make the night before and top with freshly whipped cream. Very refreshing dessert!

This was really good. I read through a few reviews and decided to make it with 2 cans condensed milk, 1 cup key lime juice and 4 egg yolks. I topped it with home made whip cream (a must with key lime pie). The only thing I will change next time is using 3/4 cup of key lime juice rather than 1 whole cup. It was quite tart. Also I like mine a little runny and not too firm and it was to that point in 17 minutes in the oven. DEF MAKE IT, IT'S AWESOME!

This pie is fabulous!! Have made it three times in two weeks by family request!  I also used 4 egg yolks, 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, lime zest and folded in 1 beaten egg white after reading recommendations.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a simple and quick dessert. Unfortunately we cut and it was not completely cooled(not a good idea, but we were anxious).After it sat in refrigerator overnite it cut easier and kept its shape on the plate. New family favorite!

This was my first time ever making key lime pie and it turned out great! I used 4 egg yolks, 2 cans of swt cond. milk, and 3/4 cup key lime juice. I also used the pre-made graham cracker pie crust with the two extra servings which gave me extra room on top for freshly made whipped cream.

Excellent as is!  You can also decrease by one egg yolk if you would like.  Either way it was the perfect blend of tart and sweetness.  The kids loved it and asked for seconds...that speaks volumes.

VERY good and tart...just the way we like it!!  We adjusted the recipe per others suggestions.  We used 5 yolks and 2 cans of condensed milk (1 fat free), and 1 cup of Key Lime juice in a bottle. Baked a little longer (25 to 27 min) in prepared crust. FANTASTIC TASTE!!!!

OK - I used 4 egg yolks, and a bit more juice (3/4 cups) of key limes, and 2 tsp of lime vest.  I then baked for 20 minutes, let it cool.  For a topping I used two cups of cool whip and added the juice and vest of two key limes, lightly hand whip together and "frosted" the pie.  It was perfect!

This was super easy and delicious! I used a cup of Key lime juice as others suggested but next time i will only use half a cup as stated. It was just a tad to tangy, otherwise perfect fool proof recipe!

I have made this twice already, and both times the pie was excellent! I followed the recipe the first time nearly exact, except I used only 4 eggs -- GREAT! But, I wanted more tart...great nonetheless. Second time, I supervised my daughter as she made it...we used the two cans of condensed milk, with 1 C of bottled lime juice, and again it turned out GREAT. I love the recipe, and am now looking at how to slim it down a bit, without cutting the flavor! Love this recipe! Thank you.

This was a great hit at my Island party! I used 4 egg yolks and 2 cans of condensed milk and 1 cup of key lime juice(Nellie & Joes Famous Key Lime Juice). Topped one with Whipped Cream, one with Whipped Topping and one with Meringue. DELICIOUS!!

I have made very few attempts at baking, and have never made a pie before - this pie ROCKS!!  It was so easy and tasted amazing, I can't properly describe the marriage of the tart and sweet flavor, I was blown away - and the texture....oooohhh Heavenly!!  I would note that I could not imagine this with anything BUT actual key lime juice -- NO substitutions with this one :)  yum!!!

I've taken the suggestions of 2 cans instead of one and add in lime zest...great colour!  And in addition, I put slivered almonds in the graham crust...it makes it lovely and crunchy!

My husband loved this but CAUTION: dont get the rind of the limes when you zest. I baked 25 min.  This is what I did (like Alexis81).  2/3 cup fresh lime juice (a lot of squeezing), 5 egg yolks and 1.5-2.0 cans of sweetened condensed milk + zest of 3 limes (about 1/2 tsp.)

We love key lime pie and this recipe makes an excellent one. It is very easy. I serve it with a little raspberry sauce drizzled over the top (seedless raspberry jelly, warmed until smooth) and whipped cream. Everyone loves it.

After making the changes so many people before have recommended (2 cans condensed milk, 1 cup key lime juice, 4 egg yolks) this pie was delicious.  It was the first time I've ever made key lime pie and the results were very encouraging.  Because I didn't have any key lime juice on hand, I did what someone had mentioned an used half lemon and half lime juice.  The color did surprise me a bit, but I suppose it is much more natural.  I did end up with a bit too much filling for a 9-inch pan, but overall I will definitely make this again!

With family in Florida, I have had a zillion key lime pies.  This super easy recipe is about as delicious as they come!  Made 50% more for a store-bought ten inch pie plate and still had room for more or a creamy topping.  Great!

Absolutely awesome! I followed a few tips. The 2 cans of condensed milk and 3/4 cup lime juice. The increase fit the crust perfectly. Yes, I used a pre-made graham cracker crust. Man, it was something else. I am stubborn about my star giveaway. Not this time! 5 stars!

SOOOOOOO easy!  And quick!  Great flavor with so few ingredients!  I used bottled lime juice and it tasted really good but I will try with fresh juice next time because I know it'll be ever better! Slices held together very well after about an hour of cooling uncovered in the fridge.

This recipe is a great base. I took previous advice and used 4 egg yolks and 2 cans of condensed milk and it comes out wonderful every single time. This recipe is no fail. I always top my cooled pie with lots of Cool-Whip. Love this recipe!!

reading reviews make this site so amazing! 2 cans of condensed milk, 1 cup of lime juice, 4 yolks and a homemade crust is the way to go. 15 min exactly in a 9 in crust at 375 degrees. and of course the whipped cream! XD

Key lime pie has always been one of my personal favorites, but for some reason, I had never bothered to try making one. I was VERY pleased with how easy and how tasty this one is.  Great "tang" and so refreshing! Will definitely be making this again (and trying NOT to think of the sweetened condensed milk  ... oh well!)  Thanks for this recipe!

This was almost too good to be true. My very first Key Lime Pie and soooo easy to make. I did follow the advice of previous reviews and used 4 egg yolks, 2 cans sweetened condensed milk and 1 cup key lime juice. I was a little confused on how long to bake it. I left it in the oven for 25 minutes and it turned out perfect. I think the key to this recipe is to use fresh pressed lime juice. DELISH!!!!

Quite good with the alterations.  But even though I am a citrus fanatic ( I believe lemon zest or juice can add so much to many, many baked goods) I still found it a tad lime-y for me tastes.  Not sour,  but lime-y.  I did not, however, use any whipped cream as topping which could easily solve the problem.  So in all, it was a delicious dessert... very creamy, smooth, and light.  It tastes amazing with graham cracker crust too!  If you wanted to add white chocolate to the crust, as a layer... I think that would make it even more amazing. ;)

I loved this pie, but no one else did, I think I squeezed in too many fresh key limes.  I also modified it according to some of the other review.  Great pie overall.

Well, the version of 2 c. milk,3/4 cup lime juice and 4 yolks worked for me but I'm not sure whose recipe I'm rating since I didn't use the recipe as listed. With that said, it came out delicious!  Thanks for a lovely recipe.

I also did the 4 yolks, 2 can sweetened condensed and 1 cup of key lime juice, baked for 25 minuts, and it was unbelievably good.  I'm fairly certain this is the recipe that one of the really nice restaurants in my city uses, but they put the filling in a macademia nut crust.  

Really great and soooooo simple.

People love me more when I make this pie!  I followed others' suggestions, 4 yolks and 2 cans cond. milk.  I also make my own crust and add 1/2 cup of my favorite granola to it.  UNBELIEVABLE.  Top with fresh sweetened whipping cream.

Fabulous!  
I did add 2 cans Sweetened Condensed Milk for extra filling as many previously suggested.  In increased the fresh-squeezed lime juice by 1/3 cup.
I added 2 drops of green food coloring for the 'green' effect.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but the filling came out awful.  It was very clumpy.  I tried the 4 egg yolk, 2 cans milk, and 1 cup of key lime juice and it didn't bake well, and the texture was bad.  My dad said it tasted okay but I will have to try again.

I took previous suggestions of 4 egg yolks, 2 sweetened condensed milk and 1 c. lime juice.  WONDERFUL!  It does make more than one pie crust full.  I used the mini graham cracker pie crusts to take to work.  This version makes enough to fill about 14 of the mini crusts.  Super easy for serving.

After returning from a vacation in Florida I was excited to try this pie.   It was way way to tart for us.   We will continue the search for a true key lime pit.

This turned out great-even though it took only like 2 minutes to put together!  Even though I live in S. Florida I could not find Key limes so just used regular old limes and, it was still fantastic! I need more recipes like this! Thanks!

I used Shrae1's alterations to this recipe, and I think it's the first time that I've ever licked the spoon and bowl. (It was great baked too, don't get me wrong!) With the leftover filling, I filled a silicone muffin pan 6 x half. I'm not sure if it would work with a regular muffin pan, but I inverted and gently poked the bottom of each one to unmold them. Only the ones fully surrounded by crust made it out in one piece, so if you do this, make sure that your crust goes at least halfway up the sides of each cup!

This was my first time making and eating a key lime pie.  Key lime pie is one of my fiance's favorite desserts and he LOVED this one.  I made one using a homemade graham cracker and ginger snap crust and one with a graham cracker, ginger snap and coconut crust (the latter is the best).  Great summertime dessert!

I also made all the revisions from the other reviewers - this was the quickest pie I have ever seen go.  Everyone was raving about it.  The only thing different I used was Williams Sonoma Margarita Mix - Meyer Lemon & Key Lime Mix.  It was fantastic!

The best and easiest key lime recipe I've ever made! I made my own graham cracker crust and used 1/2 c lemon and 1/2 c lime juice. It turned out great. No complaints here.

For a smaller pie, I cut the number of eggs to 4, used one can of sweetened condensed milk and used 1/2 cup lime juice and 1/4 cup lemon juice.  Nevertheless, as all seem to agree, the recipe revision to 4 eggs, 2 cans of condensed milk and a cup of lime juice was heavenly!

Followed recipe as is. Couldn't find key lime juice so followed another reviewer's suggestion to combine lime juice with lemon juice. My family didn't like it, tasted sour with heavy condensed milk taste, no key lime taste to it at all. My boyfriend liked it enough to at least eat 3 slices...

I have made this many times for BBQ's and summer outings. i follow the recipe as written, except I use fresh lemon or lime juice (whatever I have on hand). It's very easy and is always a big hit.

I'm giving this a four star only because of the changes. I did what others did and added an additional can of condensed milk and only 4 egg yolks. I also couldn't find any key lime juice so I did the half lemon juice/half lime juice thing. I also used bottled juices because it was all I had on hand. The outcome: a deliciously sweet/tart/creamy pie that was gone in no time. I can't wait to try it with fresh lime and lemon juice.

I used 2 cans of sweetened condened milk, a cup of key lime juice, & 4 egg yolks like the other reviewers said to do. It was good but also very strong, a bit too much lime I'd say.

Fantastic. Followed other reviewers' advice and used 4 egg yolks and 2 cans sweetened condensed milk. Didn't have key lime juice so I used lime and lemon juice. Can't believe how good it was.

This is a super easy recipe to make key lime pie. I followed everyone's suggestions and used 2 cans of evaporated milk. Since I didn't have key lime juice on hand I used 1/2 cup of lime juice and 1/2 cup of lemon juice. I baked for 25 minutes and cooled. It was a big hit with my friends. I would make this again.

This was my first time making this pie. I tried two different recipes to compare. The first was from a Southern Living cookbook and was much more labor intensive and had many more ingredients. This pie was by far the best; less ingredients, less preparation time and the taste was far superior. Sometimes simpler is better!

I made this for a coworkers birthday and everyone loved it! I don't eat key lime pie, but everyone raved about it. I have another birthday coming up and I'm going to make it again. SO EASY. I used 1 cup of the key lime juice, 2 14 oz cans of the milk and 4 egg yolks. Honestly, this is the easiet dessert i've ever made!

This is excellent!  I found a bag of key limes and it was time consuming to juice them all to get 1/2 cup, but it was worth it.  I used 2 cans of low fat cond milk and a crust made with ginger snaps.  Will be making this again, especially when I want to impress.

Everyone loves this. I make it every season and it is everyone's favorite! I squeeze one fresh lime and use bottled Key Lime juice to make the difference. If you want it more sour, add more fresh lime juice.

EVERYONE LOVES THESE KEY LIME PIES! They have become my signature dessert. I tend to like mine a little more tart so I add a couple wedges more of key lime.

Just made this for my inlaws last night and it went over well (not sure they would tell me if they didn't like it, but I thought it was good)!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great - even with key lime juice and reduced fat sweetened condensed milk.  I would definitely make it again!

This pie turned out great.  I loved it and took one to work and everyone there loved it, even my boss who is one of those who loves authentic florida key lime pies.  Highly recommend this recipe.

Made this last night for my boyfriend, a big fan of Key Lime Pie.   He loved it.  I did only use four eggs and I used a little less than a cup of the Nellie's Key Lime Juice.  I would possible cut down slightly on the lime juice but my boyfriend liked it as is.

This is delicious!!  My new favorite pie.  I never knew I could like something lemony or lime-y without thinking it tastes like dish soap but I was so wrong.  This pie is fabulous.  Yum!

This was pretty good.  I had to bake it a little longer than suggested, but it still turned out OK.  It had the tart, but sweet taste I was looking for.  Nothing overwhelming.

This is one of the easiest recipes I've ever made!  It was made even easier by finding key lime juice in one of the lime/lemon juice containers at the store.  DH (a key lime pie snob) loved the filling.

...I have wanted to make this pie for a long time now and was actually waiting until I purchased Key Lime juice..never got around to it....SO...I followed the advice of SHRAE1 and used 1/2c ea lemon and lime juice.  Made my own crust (1c graham cc, 3Tbls sugar and 5Tbls melted butter & baked for 5 mins) and did not bother with the whipped topping. With these modifications mine took 20 mins to bake...my son and his friends had two pieces ea..very creamy!  Thanks Pat and SHRAE1. Will make this again when I get some real Key Lime juice.

This pie is rediculously easy to prepare, and tastes exactly (as another reviewer mentioned) like the key lime pie you can buy at Publix Grocers in Florida, where I'm from.  I made this pie for a bbq, but my boyfriend's friends ate half of it even before it was served! Everyone who tasted it was crazy about it.   Will make this many, many more times.

The most difficult part of this recipe was squeezing ½ cup of key limes (they are so small) but I received so many complements and it was so easy.

Holy Cow!  This was the easiest pie I have ever made and sooooo good.  This was dessert for my hubby on Father's Day...he LOVES Key Lime Pies but we have not been able to get it the right consistency and the right tartness unless we were in Florida, but this was perfect.  I made my own crust but did not change anything else...I recommend making the filling as is and use real key lime juice if you want that authentic flavor.

Excellent flavor, very easy to make.  I used regular lime juice instead of squeezing key limes and the flavor was great.  Only complaint is that it doesn't make quite enough to fill up the pie crust - might need to increase it by half the original recipe to fill up the crust.

Very good if you like key lime pie. I learned that it's not my favorite type of pie, but this was still pretty good topped with whipped topping. It's nice and light for summer, and don't get me wrong...I didn't have any to throw away, so I did enjoy it.:-)  Just not my favorite.

I made this delicious pie with a chopped macadamia nut crust that was the perfect compliment to this tart pie. Flour butter & sugar toasted chopped macadamia’s baked for 15 minutes cooled and filled with pie filling, topped with whipped cream.  WOW!

Excellent pie.  Followed the recipe exactly.  My father, who lives in Florida, was highly complimentary.  Easy except for squeezing all those limes.

Oh my goodness, this was SO good and SO easy.  Recipe says prep time 20 minutes but I found 10 more appropriate.  A must try for all key lime lovers!

Wow, this recipe is delicious and really easy to make. I make 1 1/4 recipe to fill a 9" crust. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to give it a little more depth. I def. recommend making a buttery home-made graham cracker crust to really do the recipe justice.

This is soooooooo good!  My son requests this for his birthday.  It's very tedious to juice those tiny limes, but well worth it.

This is a great, basic recipe.  Ver easy.  I might try some grated lime rind next time to increase the tartness.

this recipe was pretty good. it was super easy to make and i enjoyed the creamy texture of the filling. though i found it too tart for my taste. i used 4 regular limes because i couldn't find key limes. next time i'll just use 3 limes instead.

This was rich and creamy!  I too had a problem filling the whole pan, but I topped it with meringue to solve it. I baked my pie without the meringue for 7 minutes and then continued baking for the rest of the time with the meringue.

I remember I had my first slice of Key Lime Pie when I vacationed in Miami, FL. Key Lime Pie became my favorite pie. This recipe DEFINITELY gets 5 stars from me. I searched for key limes at the grocery store but I couldn't find, so I used regular limes instead, still tasted fantastic! One thing though is I had to bake it an extra ten minutes, other then that - perfect :)

mmmm! this was so easy to make and absolutely delicious. My fiance loves key lime pie and he said this one is a keeper! Must use key limes! Regular limes wont be the same. I didnt have any fresh ones at the store so i bought the bottled key lime juice (mine found in the juice isle) I did however use fresh lime zest to give it that zing. I also baked about 5 minutes longer. I think I may make another one tonight!

Very good.  Ingredients are the key (no pun intended).  Don't get lazy with the limes...squeeze the key limes rather than  store bought juice.

I took this pie to my supper club and everyone loved it.  I used the "2 extra servings" pie crust and doubled the  filling recipe and it was perfect.  I also cooked it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe states.  I will definitely make this again!!!

So simple to make!  I thought this recipe was absolutely wonderful for the time it took to make.  It definitely had an egg flavor and that bothered me a little bit (an odd taste in a pie, plus with the texture it was a little much).  The next day it was MUCH better and you could hardly taste the egg at all. Thanks for sharing this!

No need to look for another Key Lime Pie recipe.  This was a hit with fans of Key Lime Pie.  As the cook, I loved it for it's simplicity and short prep time.

This recipe is amazing- exactly what I was looking for. Not too tart, very creamy, and so quick and easy to make. I topped with canned light whipped cream and almond slivers. It tastes just like the key lime pie from the Publix bakery (for those who live in the south).

I thought this recipe would be very good by all the reviews that it got.  However it was a little to tart for me.  Next time I will cut down a little on the juice.

Very quick to make. Kind of on the Sweeter side, but it's very yummy. Those who are watching their figures may want to work out after.

While this is an excellent and super easy version of key lime pie that my husband really liked, I found it a little too rich.  I also found that I had to bake the pie for almost half an hour to get the center of the custard filling to set properly.

This pie is the BEST! It is sooo easy, but doesn't taste like it! My entire family loved this recipe for Easter and they're already asking for it again. I added a few drops of green food color, a layer of cool whip to the top and a little lime zest for color. Then added a lime slice on the side when serving. Turned out great. Thank you!

I've been searching for the perfect key lime pie recipe for years and this is the best I've found yet!  *Perfect* texture and flavor!  If they're available, I'd definitely recommend using fresh key limes!  I also made my own graham crust which complimented the filling nicely!  Thanks for a great recipe!  A keeper without a doubt!

I could only find bottled key lime juice. Still a very tastey pie.  I am looking forward to making this with fresh keylimes I am sure it would be better.  The filling filled a traditional 9 inch pie shell.

This pie is so easy and so delicious!!  I've gotten nothing but good comments and raves about the pie.  Instead of a premade crust, I made a good but not too sweet graham crust.

Awesome pie, and very easy to make. I added about a tsp of sugar to the pie, and a drop of green food coloring. And I let it cook about 10 minutes longer as others have suggested.

Delicious key lime pie recipe.  It is a very tart pie, so I consider whipped cream a must with it.   
   I used fresh key limes.  Wonderful, tart taste.

I love key lime pie and when I saw key limes on sale in a local store I wondered if I could make a pie, so I was excited to find this recipe. I was very disappointed in the result. Waaaaaay too tart for me. It went in the garbage.

Had to find a graham cracker recipe as we can't buy them here in Australia. Lots of work to make your own fresh then crush for pie base but well worth it. The filling was easy but must use fresh lime juice.

This was amazing.  I made it for my husband's birthday, and he couldn't believe it was from scratch!  You MUST go through the trouble of using fresh key lime juice; there is no comparison.  I baked my own graham cracker crust, and that made this amazing recipe even better.  Thanks for sharing this great and EASY recipe!

I did not change one thing about this recipe and it turned out GREAT!  I think it was the best key lime pie I ever had.  It had a good consistency and has a great flavor.  It is tart, but that's how I like my key lime pie.  It is really good with some whipped cream on top.  My grocery store (Dominicks) sells a bottle of key lime juice, so I used that.  The color of the pie is yellowish, but that is to be expected as that is the natural color of lime juice.  I suppose you could add food coloring to make it more green, but I prefer it with it's natural color!

This recipe was SO EASY and QUICK!  I would definitely recommend it!

Recipes was incredible! Soo easy to make, and tasted spectacular.  I used regular lime juice, and it was did not make a difference.  I won't even bother making the other kinds that take so much time!

Oh so tasty! I did make the following suggested changes, however:
4 egg yolks
1 cup key lime juice
2 cans sweetened condensed milk
If think I would put more lime (about 3/4 cup to 1/4 cup lemon) juice, simply because I like the unique tang of the lime in my pie.  When mixing the milk in with everything else, it's like mixing milk into thick oatmeal, so make sure you mix it well.  Just a beaaautiful pie.

This was quick, easy and delicious.  I've never had "authentic" key lime pie (as so many other reviewers talk about) so I can't tell you if it is or isn't, but it is very tasty.  I made a ginger snap/graham cracker crust and it went very well with the lime flavor.  Also I couldn't find key lime juice so I used regular lime juice.

Very very easy.  I did leave the pie in the oven for an extra few minutes.  Will bake it again.

Made the pie just the other day and it's all gone.  I couldn't find any key limes or key lime juice.  Instead I used fresh lime juice (approx. 4-5 avg. sized limes), plus 2 tsp. lime zest (looks great in the pie), 2 tsp white sugar, and 2-3 drops of green food coloring.  No more yellow pie and it's nice and tart. I also used "Graham Cracker Crust I" from this site for the crust. Easy and Outstanding, the way it should be.

My friend made this today and it turned out VERY yellow. It looked almost like a lemon pie. It also was very tart. She said it was easy to make though.

This recipe is awesome. It is very simply to make but it has a lot of lime flavor in it. I couldn't get the Golden Graham crust, so I made a crust using ginger cookies...the combination was simply delicious!

Excellent! So easy my 6 year old could have made it with little to no help from me. The only thing I had a problem with was finding KEY LIMEs or key lime JUICE. I ended up just buying a bottle of regular lime juice, which made it a bit tart -- the way we like it here.

We loved this! Easy to make-make sure to find the real key lime juice.  It does make the pie more of a yellow versus green color, but it gives it a remarkable flavor. A+

As Simon would say, "It was just OK".  The ugly yellow color was a real turn-off.  Pink lemonade pie is much better.

I thought something like this would be a lot more difficult to make!  But it was a piece of cake and took no time at all.  However, this was a little too tart for me.  Some extra sugar next time and it will be perfect.

This wasnt the best pie Ive ever made, but it was ok. I found it to be a little too tart for my tastes, and we ended up throwing away about half of it. I probably wont make it again unless someone really wants a key lime pie.

This was awesome.  My boyfriend even liked it--he is rather particular about dessert. I added some fresh whipped cream to the top. I thik some people said it was too tart--I didn't think so at all. Just right.

so easy and really yummy.  made this for a 4th of july party and got rave reviews.  it's the perfect combination of sweet and tangy...very refreshing and not heavy like a cheesecake.  I also added a layer of cool whip topping that i made with a hint of vanilla flavoring.

I can never find key limes or juice, so I have invented this into my boo-boo pie.  I use lemon juice or half lemon/half lime and it always turns out great!  It is very sweet and rich, but the tang makes it the perfect combo!

Very good! I followed previous suggestions and doubled the recipe (AND the cooking time), and it turned out nice and firm. Very tasty - even my husband likes it, and he doesn't normally do "tart" foods. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this recipe over and over, matter of fact, I'm making one tonite for a party I am attending tomorrow.  This recipe is so quick and easy and it tastes delicious.  I have a few Key Lime Pie lovers in my family who raved about this pie and also a few friends who had never had Key Lime Pie before and wanted the recipe.  This one is a definite keeper!

Having never made a lime pie, this was so easy and the results were so delicious. I used the tart size graham cracker tins for the kids.

Quick, easy, and very yummy! I used all fresh lime juice and it turned out delicious. I also added two drops green food coloring and some lime zest as others had mentioned. I can't see how this pie can go wrong! Great recipe.

I'm not a fan of Key Lime Pie to begin with.  I made it for my roomate's going away party--he and his friends raved about it, so I reckon it's good for key lime fans.  I think it's not bad, but nothing I'd make for just MYSELF again.

Very easy to make, and tastes great!  I substituted 8 oz frozen limade concentrate (thawed) for the lime juice, and baked it a little longer.  Turned out wonderful!!

I used this recipe as dessert for a dinner I did at our Elks Lodge.  The kids weren't as excited about the unique flavor of Key Lime as the adults -- but NO LEFTOVERS!  I was asked for the recipe by a number of people and that's always a good sign.  I used crusts from the Dollar Store (two for a buck!) and whipped topping from a can because it's pretty with less effort.  I used regular lime peels, sugared, for garnish.  Also, I live in Wyoming and I buy Key Lime Juice bottled at the local supermarket in my town of 7,000 -- ask for it since it's much easier than squeezing the little limes!

AWESOME!! What a easy and tasty recipe. Excellent summer pie. I used 3 large egg yolks instead of 5 and it tuned out great. If you want a more custard like pie, use 5 yolks.

Excellent recipe.  All the neighbours rave about it - I'm afraid of telling them how easy it is !!!  They think I'm a genius.  You have to try this recipe.  You will never order Key Lime Pie in a restaurant again, as it will never taste as good as this recipe does.  I love it!!!

Whoa.... I made a few "adjustments" (used lemons instead of key limes) to make it a lemon pie. It was kind of like a lemon cheesecake without that whole cream cheese thing, and whoa it was pretty good. i liked it a lot better after leaving it in the fridge overnight. Me and my friend made it together, and at first we were like, "it's OK..." but then when we had it for breakfast the next morning.... WHOA. It was dang good. My dad LOVED it, which means I will be making it again and again... YAY! Way easy.

This is fantastic!!!   The quickest, easiest dessert I've ever made.. And, so delicious.  I've already made it twice and just bought more crusts so I can make it again.  I have an abudance of Mexican limes which are close to being key limes.  I've already squeezed a bunch and frozen them in 1/2 cup containers so I can quickly make one whenever I want.  I sent the recipe to my Sister and she's already made two, also.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe - it's perfect!!

YUMMY!!! My husband is picky about his key lime pie, but this is by far his favorite!!! He won't eat any other kind.  I like making it healthier with fat-free condensed milk. We do like real whipped cream on top :o! Thank You!!!

The easiest pie you'll ever make.  Has a great taste.  This is a new family favorite.  Hard to screw up.  Would add just a little more lime juice to make it a little tarter, but perfect the way it is.

I pulled this recipe off this web site a couple of years ago.  I have made this recipe soooo many times --- and it always gets raved reviews!  It is so easy to have all the ingredients on hand and make in a moments notice.   I just keep some pie crusts in the freezer, extra condensed milk, and the bottle of Key lime juice I get makes at least 5 of them.   It is perfect and so good.  

It is pretty dificult to mess this recipe up --- I highly recommend!

This recipe is easy and great.  If you're watching your waist, it's just as good using fat free condensed milk and a reduced fat crust.

I made this pie for my family reunion and it was the first thing to go.  Make sure to make two of them so that you can have a slice.  Loved it!!

I made these in minutres for a 4th of July potluck and it was gone in minutes! Unofrtunately, seving was tough because the filling was drippy and took a long time to firm up.

This is a great recipe.  I've never made a key lime pie in my life until this recipe.  I made it for my boyfriend who loves key lime pies and he thought that it was the best.  He and his family have me make it all the time now!!!  Thanks

This was really great.  I used 'heart-healthy' eggs, lowfat sweetened condensed milk and regular lime juice and it could not have turned out better--definitely did not taste reduced fat.

My husband loved this!  I used fresh squeezed key limes (I found a bag of them at Walmart Super Center).  It was tasty and cool on a hot day.  I added meringue with the left-over egg whites.  We enjoyed it!

If you're kitchen challenged (like me), this recipe is for you. I used bottled lime juice, worked fine. I also added 4-5 drops of green food coloring and used a Nilla wafer crust instead of graham cracker. Fast, easy, and downright yummy!!!

This recipe was very quick and easy to prepare. My husband is a big fan of "tangy" desserts and he loved this one. He and our 9 yr old son have been requesting that I make another, which I will gladly grant their wish. It was sooooo YUMMY.

I had never made this before and really wanted to try it.  The recipe was so easy and simple....and yummy!!  One helpful hint, if you're like me and taste the batter of everything you make, don't add more than the set amount of lime juice because it will taste better after you bake it.
Otherwise, you'll pucker more than you mmmm

You just can't get any easier than this receipe.  I've made it twice so far, once with real key limes and the other with bottled key lime juice.  With real key limes it was very delicious and had more of a tart taste.  Therefore, if you like your key lime pies really tarty and only have access to bottled key lime juice I recommend adding a little bit more key lime juice.

I never had "key lime pie" before but it wasn't hard to rate this recipe, it was extremely tasty!! My only problem was there wasn't enough filling for a 9" crust it would have fit better into an 8" shell. Otherwise delicious!!!

I added an extra tablespoon of Key Lime juice to make it extra tart then used the new cool whip in the bag with the icing tip to decorate. This would also taste great with some of the graham cracker crust crumbled on top. Scrumptious and Yummie = my favorite word I made up "Scrummie"

Thanks

other than thinking that my heart was going to stop any minute due to the egg yoks, the pie was a major success. Used Easter egg dye to make pies green and used "plain" lime juice. Worked well.

This pie tasted great and was very easy. My only problem was that it didn't even fill an 8" pie crust that someone recommended instead of the 9". I wonder if it had something to do with the size of the eggs I used...which were large. 
I did add the green food coloring someone else suggested.

The purchased 9 inch graham cracker pie shell that I used was too big for the amount of filling..it would have worked better in an 8 inch crust.  However, it was EASY and YUMMY and I will definitely use the recipe again!!

It was excellent!  I couldn't find key lime juice, so I sat with my juicer and tiny key limes and squeezed out 7 tablespoons--but it was worth it!  I added 2 drops of green food coloring to get the "right" color that you see in restaurants.

It is absolutely delicious!!!  When my family tried the first one, they loved it so much, I ended up making 2 more so some can take home!!! It's that easy.

I get so many compliments on this recipe!!I actually do these as tarts in individual cupcake holders(bake time is slightly less) and garnish them with a dab of whipped cream and a raspberry or lime slice.Perfect!!!
