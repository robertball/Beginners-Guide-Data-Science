I have never seen this recipe anywhere!  This is very similar to the recipe that my mom has used all my life and it was passed down to her from her mom.  If you are interested in a wonderfully simple but delicious homemade dressing then you must give this a try.  This dressing is one of the first things that goes everytime it is made.

French bread worked like a charm! Stuffing was tender, flavorful and moist (I included 1C additional liquid for personal preferences). I also added crushed garlic (2 cloves). Everyone was VERY shocked it was my first experience making homemade stuffing.

When I made this recipe the second time, I chose to interpret a celery STALK as an entire bundle of celery, rather than just one RIB.  When prepared this way, the dressing was perfect!

Great recipe, it’s a family favorite. The only changes are fresh un-toasted bread, fresh herbs 3 eggs and only one cup of broth. iota

This was SOOOOOO Yummy!  (Edited to condense) This year for Thanksgiving I searched out a recipe like my Grandma made (and my Mom and I still make) to get measurements. (When my mom passes down a recipe she tells us the ingredients but estimates the amounts)  Well, This recipe has the same ingredients (plus a few added spices) but it actually came out better since it was not as dry!  I did a few minor tweaks based on other reviews and a desire to make it closer to my Grandma's.  I added a little more sage, and more broth since some reviews thought it was a little dry. I used little less thyme & parsley as these never part of G'ma's original ingredients, but I thought they would make tasty additions nonetheless. It was a huge hit! Everyone that's used to my stuffing was pleased with the flavor (I think it was actually better) but love the moister version!  I'm used to my dressing on the dry side but dislike "soppy" versions so this ended up being a perfect balance for us.  i will be making it this from now on!  Thanks!!   ***2019****(this year I will be experimenting with a small batch made with vegetable broth and no egg for vegetarian) and one a small batch without egg  just because I have heard a lot of people never use egg in their dressing-just curious how it will differ)

This was Wonderful!!  I did add twice as much liquid (at least maybe more).  We live in South Korea but had an American Thanksgiving Day service.  Another American that is married to a Korean only ate this Dressing out of everything that was there.

Excellent recipe! This was the first dish to disappear at Thanksgiving last year. I was so happy to find a stuffing recipe without sausage, and now I am even happier.  This year, I doubled the recipe so I could have leftovers.

Really good dressing.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding about 2 Tbsp melted butter to the mixture at the very end.  I stuffed all but about 1/2 cup into a 13 lb turkey and it worked really well.  Unfortunately, because we brined the turkey, the dressing came out a little more salty than we would have liked, but it was still really good and I won't hesitate to make it again. I made this a second time to excellent results. This time, I didn't stuff it into the bird, but rather cooked in a casserole dish. The end result was still excellent, but a little dry. If baking on its own, I would try adding an additional 1/2 cup of broth. I made this a third time, adding another 1/2 cup of broth and baked with the lid on - only taking it off for the last 15 or 20 minutes - the end result was perfect!

This was excellent!  Although I did change some things according to my family's preferences. First I cubed my French bread and let it sit for several hours, didnt toast it. I used about 5-6 stalks of celery and 3 small onions.  I used a little over 1/4 cup fresh parsley, about 2 T fresh finely  chopped thyme and 1 1/2 tsp fresh minced rosemary.  I also used about a T of dried sage, 2 cups turkey stock (from boiling the turkey neck and giblets) and ended up using 1 1/2 - 2 cups additional  chicken broth.  We really like our dressing with lots of herb flavor and the extra liquid made it moist without being mushy.   Ths was the best thing on the Thanksgiving table this year!  Thanks for sharing.

Ok, so i have never made a home made stuffing......I cooked Thanksgiving dinner for my partners family for the first time and they were all accustomed to having his moms stuffing. Then  I made this stuffing, it all went the in the first helping! Everyone raved about it.....If you follow the recipe it will come out a little dry.....just add more stock and mix it all together and pop it back in the oven......Thank you to whom ever posted this recipe. It was the best stuffing I have ever had!

My family loves sage stuffing in the turkey and sausage dressing baked in the oven as a side dish. This was a perfect sage stuffing. Stuffing gleans juices from the turkey and gets moist as it cooks. For this reason I cut the egg to just one and cut the chicken broth to 1.5cups. PERFECT!

We made this stuffing for our Christmas dinner yesterday, and we loved it! Neither my husband or I usually like stuffing so we were surised we liked it this much. We did exchange the celery for apples and added Italian sausage to go along with our meal a little more. One thing that we really liked about it was that it wasn't really moist, we tend to not like soggy stuffings very much so this was great! Thanks for this delicious recipe!

I made this recipe excatly as it was written and it turned out dry and nobody would eat it. I guess it wasn't my family's taste. Next time I'll add more broth and just toast the bread or just let it dry out instead of drying and toasting.

This is basically a good recipe but for my personal taste I will make a few changes next time. If you are not a fan of a strong sage taste( as I am not) I would cut the sage in half, at least. Also I almost doubled the chicken broth , and glad a did because it turned out perfect when otherwise it would have been way to dry I think. Another change I made was to put alot more celery in. 2 stalks just wasnt near enough. I think with these changes i will make this my new dressing recipe  :)

For years I made dressing (we didn't stuff the turkey with it, but baked in a pan) the way my mom did.  It was a thick soup-like consistency, poured into a pan and baked, and cut into squares.  In fact, my mom used to call it 'glop' before it was baked.  It tasted wonderful, but looked less than appealing. 

I made this for the first time this Thanksgiving, and though only a couple of people, including me, like sage dressing, they went back for more and commented on how good it was. 

This is now my official dressing recipe.

Wow making your own bread crumbs from the crusty bread really brings this dressing past ordinary. I did have to substitute celery flakes for the fresh celery but honestly it worked great and It's moist and flavorful. It compliments the thanksgiving meal with its simple savory taste, and doesn't overpower the turkey like some meat based dressings can. This will be on my menu for the rest of my life.

This recipe is a great starting point for making stuffing. I started out with toasted bread from a package and the texture and flavor blew my mind away. However, the dressing could use more celery and more liquid. I used almost two times the amount of broth.

This stuffing won good reviews at our Thanksgiving table. I used quite a bit more celery and upped the quantity of herbs. I did use a dense, crusty Italian bread, which worked just great. I'd never taken the extra step of toasting the bread. For me the recipe resulted in a lighter, airy version of stuffing than was classic at my childhood home. Next time I might use a bit more liquid. For more even distribution of the seasonings, I added them to the sauteed veggies before mixing them with the bread.

Hands down the one and only stuffing (dressing) I will eat with turkey.  Sausage and cornbread make a mockery of the divine stuffing I had growing up.  (The very most I might add to this one is button mushrooms.)  I also like the idea of almost toasting the bread hunks before mixing.  The way we made stuffing in my (very large) 
family was to break day-old bread into chunks and put them in a big doubled brown grocery bag.  Poultry spice was added to the sauteeing onions and celery. Then we'd just pour the whole mess into the bags with the bread, then knead with our hands to work it through.  It was heavenly every time.

This recipe was amazing! I made a few modifications based on what I had available: I used just 1.5 onions and about half a "head," or stalk of celery (6 ribs about). In addition, I added one diced apple to the sauteeing vegetables. I omitted the parsley because my grocery store had run out. I didn't have dried sage and thyme, so I used two teaspoons of poultry seasoning in its place. I added 1/4 cup of raisins into the final mixture (before baking). Finally, I felt like the recipe needed closer to 3 cups of chicken broth, but add it to your desired moistness. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Mmmmm delicious!  Just a word of caution, though... watch the cubed bread carefully while toasting it.  One minute too long and they'll burn to a crisp, which I learned the hard way on my first batch hehehe.  Also, I added approx. 1/2 cup extra chicken broth and it came out just the way I liked it.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!!!

Not a bad stuffing.  Had to add a whole lot more liquid, I guess I'm used to a looser stuffing.  Also added a ton more of the herbs, because I'm used to my stuffing very herby as well!  Oh, and I also added some carrots.  Overall, it was pretty good, not the greatest though.  I'm used to stuffing with a lot more veggies and a lot more flavour.  I only eat stuffing a couple times per year, so I guess to me any decadent stuffing needs bacon!  Or something with that nice fatty flavour.  A good healthier version though :)

I used this recipe as a guide, since I couldn't remember how to make it after years of not cooking at Thanksgiving.  I noticed one review said it was dry.  Based on my memory I made the following changes and it turned out awesome!
I used a whole loaf of whole wheat white bread and did not brown in the oven; instead, I cut it up 2 hours prior and let it sit out to dry. I only used 1 medium onion and 4 to 5 celery stalks (size dependent).  I used an entire stick of regular butter (1 cup) to saute the onions and celery.  I used dried parsley; I put the parsley in the chicken broth (along with all the other spices) and let it soak for the 2 hours the bread was drying. I then added the broth to the onion, celery and butter in the sauce pan after they had cooked, for 2 to 3 minutes to warm them all to the same temp (stirring constantly). I then added the mixture from the saucepan a little at a time and stirred it in to keep the moisture coverage even.  I must say, it turned out fantastic!  I will make it the same way next time.  Thanks to the cook who put this recipe out there!  It helped me remember what I needed to use to make my Mom's great dressing!

This was a HIT! Read the tips and added 2 more cups of broth and a few more stalks of celery.  I wasn't stingy with the seasoning either. To save time, I made this the night before, then the next day when the turkey was done, I drizzled a little turkey drippings over it and a little broth so it wouldn't be dry, covered with foil, and put in the oven at 350 for an hour to reheat (took the foil off for the last fifteen minutes). It was perfect! My only complaint is there weren't enough leftovers for me to enjoy it today! lol

I made this recipe to stuff my turkey for my first Thanksgiving dinner hosting and doing everything. It turned out amazing. I didn't dry it for the days it said, just made sure it dried out in the oven, I added garlic suggested by another reviewer and doubled the spices since I love my dressing flavorful. Since I was stuffing the turkey with it, I left out one cup of broth. This turned out wonderfully!

I don't know why I thought dressing had to be complicated.  For years I have been putting all kinds of wacky stuff in my stuffing.  I decided to go classic this year and it knocked everyone's socks off.  Keep it simple, follow the recipe and all will enjoy!  What a concept ;)  Thanks for sharing!!!

This was great - tasted just like my grandma's recipe. I did add a little garlic to the recipe and I did not toast the bread (I forgot!), but I did dry the bread out. Very yummy - everyone loved it!

This was good! I used crutons/bread cubes because I was lazy to use the real french loaf. It worked well but I will probably use the bread next time. I made one batch and then split it, one using veggie stock and then 1 using chicken (so vegetarians could eat it). It was pretty good. I had never made stuffing before so I was impressed.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving without first trying  it and my mother-in-law said it as "perfection" and I have to say I agree (I'm usually more of a cornbread dressing kinda girl).  It was so delicious  I'm making it again tonight to serve with a chicken I'm roasting.  When I made this recipe the first time I used fresh herbs and increased to 1 TBL or so, but tonight I'm going to use the dried herbs and I'm sure the results will be just as delicious.

Excellent dressing. Very savory. I used 2T dried celery flakes, 2T dried minced onion, celery salt instead of plain and a 16 oz. bag of Pepperidge Farm brand cornbread crumbs. I forgot the eggs, as I'm not used to adding it and already had it in the dish ready for the oven, so I just left them out. This was delicious. LOVED IT!

I doubled this recipe for 12 people at Thanksgiving.  Added 2 chopped Fuji apples that I sauteed with the onion and celery.  Great flavor, however I would have given 5 stars if it was a little drier...I couldn't tell if it was too much broth or egg.  But very good nontheless!

I thought it seemed dry so added a 2nd can of broth. Oops! It came out almost like soup. Everyone else LOVED it though. To be honest, I didn't try it because I like a drier stuffing. As written though, it would have been great to me too. Smelled WONDERFUL!

Excellent!  I was looking for a recipe that used the same ingredients as my mother in law's, and this was spot on.  The only things I did differently is I added added more of the listed spices and twice the chicken broth.  These changes are just personal preferences, as everyone has differ t taste as to seasoning and moistness.  Oh, I also added slivered almonds because my mother in law always dead that.

I have used this recipe three times with my grade 5/6 class to make stuffing for our schools annual thanksgiving luncheon and each and every time it has turned out wonderful. It has been wonderful even though we make without drying the bread out first. I always have to give credit back to this site when multiple parents come and ask me for the recipe. Teams of 4 or 5 successfully did jobs to crack eggs (18), cut celery, do the stock, cut the onions, and break apart the French bread (9 loaves). We have a small school so we make 5 aluminum roaster trays for 150 people.

I hVe tried several recipes and this is the best. I used regular bread and added my own seasonings to the bread after spraying the bread with butter spray so the seasonings would stick better. I have copied this recipe and an on using it at Christmas also.

Everytime I make something posted by this person it does not come out right.  The flavor was there but it turned out soggy in some places and dry in others.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  I would say I am a good cook and have not had such issue with any authors recipes except this one.  Glad others have not had issue and I will just move on to other authors.

Very tasty.  I added some poultry seasoning and sauted mushrooms.  I didn't toast the bread as recommended because I was afraid it'd turn to mush.

Made this for a Vegetarian Thanksgiving for my family! Made my own bread, nixed the onions and celery, substituted veggie broth for the chicken, and added dried cranberries. An excellent base recipe!

This dressing was very good.  I used French bread.  I needed about three times as much liquid as the recipe calls for and even with that much liquid, the bread cubes were not soggy at all.  The flavor is very good, but if you like your dressing really wet, this is not for you.

don't make my mistake leave the bread chunks bite sized... make them quite small or it becomes a bit like buttered croutons with some flavor. Also I think a bit more liquid is necessary. Okay but not what I invisioned...

Had excellent flavor.  Loved the french bread! A little too dry for us, had to add quite a bit more broth, also added a bit more sage.  Will make again with these changes.

I've never made a stuffing like this before, and it was loved by all! I used fresh pumpkin crusty bread, which gave the dish an extra kick of flavor. Vegetable stock worked like a charm, and I also added a clove of crushed garlic. I used cilantro instead of parsley (not a fan) and made sure to go heavy on the herbs. Loved by vegetarians and meat eaters alike. We didn't have any leftovers!

First time I made homemade stuffing. It was good but the recipe says you can use croutons in place of cooking the bread but doesn’t say how much so I had to guess and it was a little dry. I used about 10 cups, next time I will use about 8 or will increase the liquid.

This was a very bland and boring stuffing, I made it as it was written. Didn’t change a thing. Very bland. Tasted like I was eating croutons. Will not make this again.

I found this dressing last year for Thanksgiving and have made it for two thanksgivings and one Christmas so far and every time it's been a big hit. 
I did have to tinker with the recipe quite a bit since I make a quadruple portion. Including turning the 2 cups of broth called for into a whopping 20 cups (!!!) added slowly throughout the 2 hours it takes to cook that much dressing. But the results have been a super moist, but not soupy, and amazingly flavorful dressing that I'm going to be making for years to come.

This is a delicious and easy recipe!  I had a little more bread so I increased the celery and broth and added one more egg. The spices are spot on and I didn’t have to add anything else. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This was okay for a relatively plain dressing, but no one was enthusiastic about it. Next year I'll go back to making more adventuresome dressing recipes. Even having increased the spices and celery, this was pretty bland.

The flavor was definitely there with this recipe, but the texture of the stuffing was not. It was way too dry for my taste even after adding additional juices to it. If you like a dryer stuffing, this recipe might be for you.

It would have been five if I had fresh herbs, but it is just as my mother made it all our lives. Of course one must adjust the fluids as in any recipe.

I added more sage & used the turkey broth from cooking the neck.  It was very dry & did add more chicken broth too.  I also added a little rosemary.  I would use this recipe again just with a few tweaks for our family desire.

I like it, I wish I would of cooked it longer or maybe broiled it so the top would be crispy.
I felt it had to much celery, and I used the whole stalk. I did add more chicken stock. About 1/2 cup more and the moisture was great. I tweaked a little of the seasonings to our likings and I feel I would make this again, had great taste!

It was ok. It was pretty dry, and needed more salt. Next time I'll add some more broth, maybe a bit more salt. And definitely needs more than 2 stalks of celery.

Just like my mom used to make.  I used fresh bread, and half of the chicken broth.  I also doubled the sage.  I will continue to use this recipe for years to come!  Thank you for bringing back the heartwarming memories of days gone by.

I have made this time and time again... it never disappoints. For years I looked for something that reminded me of my granny's homemade stuffing and now I feel I found something even better! It has become a tradition to make this for my family every single Thanksgiving. Even family members that don't usually eat stuffing, take seconds of this recipe. They don't remember what Stove Top is ;) 5 stars, hands down!

My family all agrees, this was by far my best Thanksgiving stuffing yet. My only changes (because everyone has their own flare on dressing) is the following: I omit the celery (not a fan) & added Craisins & sauteed fresh minced garlic with the onion. This stuffing was such a hit there was none left over.

This recipe is near perfect for dressing! Mushrooms and a couple cloves of garlic are the only additions/changes I make to the vegetables.

This is a good basic dressing to customize.  We doubled the celery and added apples for slight sweetness.

My mother usually makes the dressing for our Thanksgivings, but she was out of town this year, so I tried this one.  It's very close to the simple, yet delicious one she makes.  It was good, but I had to add more liquid (turkey stock).  As is, it was on the dry side.  I also thought it needed more sage/seasonings, so I threw in some extra.  However, overall, this is an easy, yummy dressy that's great for those of us who are not dressing "experts" like Mom!

This recipe was so much like what my Grandmother made, I just had to try it! I did use extra celery like another reviewer mentioned... I added 1 extra egg to hold the dressing together better, and rolled the dressing into fist-sized balls. Then I baked them on a greased cookie sheet @ 350º for 30 minutes. My husband thinks this is absolutely the best stuffing ever!
