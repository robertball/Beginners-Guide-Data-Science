This is a yummy treat! We had fun making it. We forgot to add the strawberry topping and were glad, cuz it was a bit sweeter than we wanted. Extra strawberries, skipping the strawberry topping, and maybe even adding some extra cream cheese next time. We put it in cupcake papers in a muffin pan in the freezer...and also filled some little waffle cones and froze those as well. We love the 'cheesecake-y' treat that is so easy and it has fruit so it is healthy, right?

Absolutely delightful! :) It was so good. I didn't follow the recipe exactly but I'm so glad I didn't. I just put in the cream cheese, a little extra milk, the pudding mix and the cool whip and I put it all in a blender with some frozen strawberries and it turned out so good. I crushed some graham crackers b/c that's all I had, mixed in some melted butter and made me a crust. I poured the filling over it, froze it and what a treat! :) Will definitely make it again.

I could have done something wrong, but this is a fairly simple recipe so I don't think so.  I let it set up in the freezer about 6 hrs.  My fresh strawberry pieces were jaw breakers and when I let it sit out so they would melt a little, the pudding/cream cheese/cool whip/cookie part turned into mush quickly with no crispy cookie texture.  I used my own homemade strawberry freezer jam in place of the ice cream topping and that gave it a really great strawberry taste.  All in all, I'd say this dish has an identity crisis:  Is it ice cream?  Is it pudding?  Is it cheesecake?  Beats me.  I won't be making it again and I'm not looking forward to finishing the rest of it that's still in the freezer.  Sorry.

After reading the ingredients, I simplified the recipe. In place of the cream cheese, milk, pudding and cool whip, I used one tub of Philly's Ready-To-Eat Cheesecake filling. In addition to the strawberries, I added chunks of bananas and a small can of crushed pineapple (drained). In place of the strawberry sauce, I used a jar of hot fudge sauce and swirled it in, scooped into waffle ice cream cones and then pushed the tops into chopped walnuts, wrapped each individually, in plastic wrap, and froze. This is what I call a Cheesecake Banana Split in a cone. Adults and kids alike loved them!!

Pretty tasty. Not like cheescake, but still tasty and great for summer. I used low-fat cream cheese, reduced fat pie crust, fat free milk and fat free cool whip. After 3 hours it was just barely frozen enough to cut but still soft. Really needed a couple more hours. Best thing was that it was sooooo easy to make. I love no bake stuff!

This recipe was much better before it was frozen. I also think half a cup of strawberry topping is way too much. I'd make it again with these changes.

This tastes amazing.  My only warning is don't freeze it too long or else all the fresh ingredients get freezer burned (the strawberries in particular).  I added bananas to mine and used fresh whipped cream instead of Doolwhip.  It's yummiest if served the same day after chilling only a couple hours.

This was fantastic! I used strawberry perserves and 16 oz of cool whip. I filled waffle cones and then froze. Delicious and very summer-y!

This recipe is amazing!! I even subbed low-fat ingredients, i.e. soy cream cheese, reduced fat whipped cream, etc. and it still came out fabulous!  Served the freeze in waffle bowls for Mother's Day and my friends begged for the recipe!

I used instant CHEESECAKE pudding, coarsely broken graham crackers and homemade strawberry jam instead of strawberry dessert topping. I didn't bother making this into a pie--I just used a spatula to pour it into a 8x8 baking dish, covered it with foil and froze it. Once it was firm, I used my ice cream scoop and scooped it into bowls. We all loved it--especially my husband. He had two big servings!

This was good, but not amazing. It reminded me of frozen cheesecake.  I served it in the Oreo cookie crust. I agree with the other poster who said that 1/2 c. strawberry ice cream topping is too much.  I cut it down to 1/4 c.  Also, the thing I should have done was only frozen it for a couple of hours.  I froze it for 6 hours, as the recipe called for.  We took it out to serve and it was extremely difficult to cut. Next time, I would thaw it out for 30-60 minutes before serving.  I will probably make again, but experiment with different fruits/toppings and/or pudding flavors.

Loved the filling but didn't like that the strawberries are hard as rocks on the inside of the dessert.  Just didn't capture the taste of strawberry.  I think you could leave them out of the filling, put them on top right before serving and it would be better.

Pretty easy to make, however I would suggest leaving out the fresh strawberries and add them as a fresh garnish when serving. They freeze as hard as rocks and makes it nearly impossible to cut/serve.

I made a "test" pie at home.  Then I made 14 to serve when I cooked supper at my Church.  It was definitely a HIT.  I am alway looking for something new and light in the summer and this fit the bill.  Because I did so many, I broke down and used a purchased graham cracker crust - but that is the only change I made.  Dozens of diners came in to the kitchen to brag on it and ask for the recipe.  I will be passing it along and add it to my list of "summer" desserts. I did let them sit out for a while before they were cut and served, but they were still cold..no complaints about hard strawberries. And my husband LOVES it!  Thanks

Just made this last night and wow! what a hit! So easy and so good. I used shortbread cookies but no other changes (needed). What a fabulous treat to have on hand for summeer guests. This is going in the church cookbook I am working on and in my FAVORITES as well. Thanks for sharing such a great dessert!

I make this for all 3 Thanksgivings my family attends, and each year it is a hit! Everyone loves it and requests it!! I also dont use the strawberry topping, and tried it once with frozen strawberries, didnt work. It makes it an odd color and doesnt set the same :( oh well lesson learned! This is for sure a favorite at our house!

Great light dessert for Memorial Day BBQ. Due to the diabetics in the family, made this with reduced fat cream cheese, sugar free pudding mix, 2% milk, sugar free Cool Whip, reduced fat vanilla wafers,  and sugar free strawberry ice cream topping-which I didn't even know existed- and everyone thought this was wonderful. I can't imagine how even much better the full version as listed would be. I used the muffin tins for mini-pies. Creamy, not too sweet, not overtly cheesecake-y, it was a hit!

The only reason I give this a four instead of a five is because the strawberries need to be smaller really,other than that,it's a great! dessert.

Very yummy! I froze them in the cupcake papers for around 4 hours, then took them out about 30 min. before eating. They were too soft to each as a cupcake from the papers so I put them on plate, drizzled homemade strawberry jam on top and added sliced strawberries. They were very difficult to eat with a spoon because the middles were still frozen. I think you have to find a happy medium when it comes to the freezing. Maybe if they were in for less time so there wouldn't be time for them to get so hard.
