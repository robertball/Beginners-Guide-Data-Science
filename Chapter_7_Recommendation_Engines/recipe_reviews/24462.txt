Sugar cookies are my favorite cookies to make and these are the only ones I will EVER make again! I always add extra almond extract and they are So big and delicious! I've made them so many times that people just expect them for every holiday! I don't use this icing recipe, instead I make it with corn syrup and different flavored extracts.... I let the iced cookies set overnight and the are so stackable and ship Very well. For Valentines day, I made pink icing with strawberry extract and red icing with raspberry extract. I always put them in cute printed cellophane treat bags and give them to everyone in my family and everyone at work. (and I always save a few for myself)

The recipe I've been looking for forever!  They remind me of the ones you can get at "Dutch" restaurant bakeries.  Yes, the recipe neglects to tell you to add the vanilla extract, but come on folks!  Add it with/after the eggs.  I did double the vanilla, added around 3/4 teaspoon of almond extract, and added 1/4 cup of sugar as suggested by others because I like a sweeter cookie.  Perfect flavor!  Matched great with the "Sugar Cookie Icing" recipe on this site (not the icing recipe given).  You don't need to add flour; stick in the fridge for an hour, put flour on your rolling surface, a bit on your rolling pin, and a sprinkle on the dough you're going to roll out - no sticking!  I baked them for a total of 10 minutes, turning the sheet around in the oven at 5 minutes because my oven doesn't heat evenly on both sides unless I do so.  In my case, I had to watch the bottoms carefully - a teeny bit of golden color and they were DONE.  People are always so impressed with these!  I hate reading the extremely low star reviews for this recipe...people, learn the basics of cookie making (cream your butter/sugar thoroughly, don't over-mix the flour, use fresh baking powder/soda, learn the signs of doneness, etc.) before you complain about a recipe!

These cookies were very good!  To tell the truth, I really debated whether or not to make them since a few people really did not like them at all.  I thought what the heck -- I like to bake and it would really not be that big of a deal if we didn't like them.  I cut the recipe in half and ended up with 28 thick, soft cookies.  I added a little almond to the dough, as others had done, just to give it a little flavor.  I'm not sure what those who didn't like them are looking for.  They were very easy to make, and the dough was easy to handle.  The final cookie is a little shortbread-like.  We really liked them and will make them again!

These really are soft and perfect.  I have been looking for a good sugar cookie cut out recipe and this is the one.  Upon reading other reviews, I doubled the vanilla and added about 3/4 teaspoon almond extract.  I also increased the sugar by 1/4 cup.  I refrigerated the dough for about two hours and it was so easy to work with.  When I baked them, I put them on a silpat liner and the bottoms didn't even brown.  I made hearts for Valentine's Day, and I put them, unfrosted, in the freezer.  I will take them out and thaw them when I am ready to frost them.  Yummy cookies!  They remind me of a homemade version of Cheryl & Co.

The only reason i didnt rate the a 5* was because i thought it lacked a touch of more flavor. THIS IS A GREAT COOKIE, but next time i am going add some Almond Extract and see if it fixes it. The dough is Very Easy to work with! I think one should watch the clock carefully on these and not go to or over 10mins!   PS.(THE # OF EGGS IS CORRECT)

These cookies were delicious and soooooo easy to work with!!!  I used 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of almond extract.  I also substituted whipping creme for the 6 egg yolks (about 1 tbsp. for each yolk).  If you have a hard time making sugar cookies, this would be a good recipe for you!

Awesome recipe! I was looking for the perfect cookies for my sister-in-law' babyshower, and I'm so glad I used these. I  baked these in the shape of baby carriages and bottles, and then used the icing recipe  called "Sugar Cookie Icing" from this site. I copied the colors and piping from the Cookies by Design website and they came out PERFECT!!! Now everyone in the family calls me Martha Stewart :).  If baking for a more adult crowd and using icing, only use this recipe's amount of sugar otherwise I think they would be too sweet. If you don't plan on decorating, definitly add a little bit more.

My cookies must have been mondo because I only got 30 from this recipe. I rolled them 1/2 inch thick and used a 3 1/2 inch heart cookie cutter. I used 2 tsp. mexican vanilla and 2 tsp. almond extract. I needed to cook them about 11 minutes or they were still doughy inside. They also spread a bit more than I thought they would so leave room between them when baking. They tasted GREAT! Not too sweet and with icing they were perfect. No sugar coma here. The dough was wonderful to work with. I used a floured pastry cloth to roll it out on and a rolling pin cover. I didn't have any problem with it sticking. I usually don't make roll out cookies because I haven't found a good dough that doesn't stick. This was the exception. I'll make these again. Hubby and kids loved them!!

This is THE sugar cookie recipe I have been wanting to make for years! I had received cookie boquets when my kids were born and I had not tasted sugar cookies that good since!  These are perfect.  I made these really thick and used big cookie cutters about 4-6" so I only got about 3 dozen cookies but they are delicious!  I used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheets. Thanks for the recipes

I tried three different sugar cookie recipes off this site. This one was the worst. Don't get me wrong the finished product tasted good, but the large amounts of ingredients wasn't worth it. The dough was hard to work with too. A good tasting cookie just not worth the hassle.

Wow....Excellent Recipe....I did add the additional 1/4 cup sugar, doubled the vanilla, and added about a teaspoon of almond extract, as others had suggested.  I made the dough up yesterday, and let it chill overnight, it was very easy to work with.  I used  a 3 1/2 inch round cookie cutter and got 2 1/2 dozen of cookies, which is plenty for my family.  Instead of greasing the pans, I used parchment paper, I baked for 10 minutes, I did let them rest on the pan for about 5 minutes before placing them on the racks to finish cooling.  To decorate I used the "Sugar Cookie Frosting" from this site, then just added different sprinkles.   One thing I did do is put the dough back into the fridge, while the other cookies baked, when the dough gets warm it is harder to work with, so keep it chilled. I also dusted any excess flour off both sides of the cookie before baking, I always do this, I don't like flour caked onto a cookie after it is baked, plus it doesn't look pretty.  Another thing is just take your time, don't try to rush,  have fun making the cookies, even my little guy (3 year old) had fun helping make the dough, and decorate the cookies.    My hubby said if he wasn't home to see us make them, he would of thought I bought them from a bakery.  They not only look professional, but taste it as well.   This is now our new sugar cookie recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, also Thanks to those that have given advice on "tweaking" the recipe for additiional flavor.

The people who've given this cookie one star must be inexperienced with baking, which is more than just popping things in the oven.  You have to know how to mix dough, remember to do wet ingredients first, then dry.  If you over-mix anything with flour in it you will have a bad cookie--you want to mix it just enough to incorporate the wet and dry ingredients.  I'm so glad I ignored the bad reviews on this one.  Anywho, I was looking for a Cheryl & Co. style cookie, and this is IT.  I halved the recipe, and ended up with two dozen Cheryl & Co sized cut-out cookies.  They are soft and delicious and everyone who tries them thinks they are wonderful!  If you are looking for a sugar cookie that tastes like sugar, this is not for you.  These are traditional sugar cookie cut-outs, that have just a hint of vanilla/sugar sweetness if you don't add the icing.  Great with tea or hot cocoa.  The dough was incredibly easy to work with, not messy AT ALL.  I had it in the fridge over night prior to rolling it out.  I greased the pan with butter spray on parchment paper, and had no issues at all--nine minutes in the oven.  I can honestly say it was one of the LEAST sticky doughs I have worked with.  If the dough is sticking, pop it back in the fridge until it is chilled, like the recipe says.

This is a wonderful sugar cookie dough to work with! So easy to roll out and cut and it holds its shape very well when baking so you're cookies come out the same shape they were when you put them in the oven. This does make a rather bland cookie so I add an extra teaspoon of vanilla, a teaspoon or so of almond extract and an extra 1/4 C. of sugar. As much as I love the cookie recipe, there are much better frosting recipes out there so I would recomend skipping this one.

Excellent cookie - easy to make and they come out firm but soft. Good taste too - not too sweet so goes well with frosting. This will be my official cutout recipe from now on, it's the one I've been looking for. The only thing I changed was I used 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract. One thing to note - this makes a very large batch, which is great if you're making Christmas cookies, but consider halving it if you don't want that many. Also, when the cookies are done they are still the same color as the dough - so don't wait for them to brown or you might not like the results.

I wanted to make these cookies but because of the egg confusion (10 eggs total?) I didn't. If the poster could clarify, that would be great. Thanks!

I increased the sugar by about 1/4 cup., glad I did, it has a nice sugary flavor. Made the dough 1, 2, 3, it mixed like a dream. Refrigerated it for 2 days til the weekend. Took out about 3 hours prior and then rolled out chunks at a time on a well floured board and with a well floured rolling pin., They rolled out quick and easy no problem transporting them to sheets. Rolled them out thick.
The bottoms are barely brown at 8 minutes, which is good, they are thick and puffy and stay that way and white. BUT, let them sit on a sheet before trnsferring, some of my daisy petals broke and so did the butterfly wings. So wait, they are very very soft. when dipping in icing, I also lost a few that that broke.  They are bland alone, some sugar on top or iced make them wonderful a 5 star for sure. But a little bland with nothing on them. Which they are not meant to be. If you arent up to icing, course sugar on top or sugar cystals will do the trick. This will be my new recipe, along with Sugar Cookie Icing on this site. I got exactly 75 cookies from it. Followed the recipe exactly.

Good flavor and beautiful cookies.  To answer the question of some previous "reviewers,"  YES you do add both the 6 egg yolks and the 4 eggs (which means you will use a total of 10 eggs for this recipe and have to figure out what to do with 6 egg whites - omelets anyone?).  I rolled them out to between 1/4 and 1/2 an inch.  Then make sure that your oven is right and cook them 8 minutes, no more.  2 minutes on the cookie sheet finishes off the cooking and they don't get brown edges.  They are puffy and sweet.  I added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond, but if you don't like almond, these would probably be okay with just the vanilla.  They work really well with frosting.  I made lots of Christmas trees and candy cane shapes.  We had almost as much fun eating them as we had decorating them as a family.

These are delicious sugar cookies that are perfect for the holidays. I purchased small Christmas cut outs at Sur La Table and made a homeade whipped chocolate ganache from Martha Stewart. I frosted them together with the chocolate and some strawberry jam for variety and they turned out to be sweet Christmas gifts once dusted with powdered sugar. I will definetly be making these next Christmas!

I made a batch to bake Christmas cut out cookies for my coworkers and they all loved it! I love these too! These are just what I've always been looking for in a cut out sugar cookie - easy to work with, doesn't spread a ton while baking, thick, sturdy yet still soft inside! In my oven it took exactly 10 minutes to bake perfectly so I'd suggest watching your cookies closely for doneness. And I used 1 T of vanilla extract and 1 t of almond extract instead of the 1.5 t vanilla extract because I want extra flavor. I added the extra 1/4 C of sugar as suggested but I won't do that going forward since I iced my cookies and found it to be a little too sweet (and I like sweet). I didn't use the icing recipe from this recipe (I used a different one that calls for confectioners' sugar, milk/water, corn syrup, and flavoring extract) and this was perfection! I will be using this as my "go to" sugar cookie cut out recipe from now on!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!***Update*** This is the only sugar cookie cut-out recipe with the minor alterations I listed above that I'll ever use or need. Hands down best cut-out sugar cookies for any occasion EVER!

I really had fun making these cookies.  To the original ingredients, I added some almond extract and yellow food coloring.  After chilling overnight, the dough was easy to roll and cut; I opted for a duckie cookie cutter to make thick cookies into which I inserted lollipop sticks prior to baking.  Once cooled, I decorated with yellow royal icing and sanding sugar. I put each cookie-pop in individual treat bags, then tied with curling ribbon and stuck them in a basket using floral foam for anchorage.  Added some decorative tissue paper and ribbons then presented this 'cookie bouquet' to my sister in honor of expecting her first child (and FINALLY making me an aunt!).  Thanks so much for a tasty treat as well as a fun project!

Absolutely perfect!  These cookies taste exactly lime the ones from Cookies by Design! I was having a difficult time finding a recipe that held its shape without being dry.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and added 1/4 cup more sugar as well as almond extract (I just poured the stuff in as I LOVE it!) hands down this is the BEST homemade cookie recipe you'll ever need!

Made these over the weekend. I did follow other reviewer's suggestions and added 1/4 c more sugar, doubled the vanilla and added a tsp of almond extract.  Baked for 8 mins. Flavor is good, not to sweet like a normal sugar cookie recipe.  I have eaten them plain and with colored sugar.  I plan on frosting them and am sure they will still taste great.

I scaled the recipe to 18 servings and at that size used two eggs instead of 1 egg and 1 1/2 yolks.  I wouldn't really call this a sugar cookie, it reminds me of an Italian cookie recipe I've made before.  The dough is rather soft so it can be difficult to transfer the cutouts to the cookie sheet without distorting them.  They puff up a bit.  They do stay nice and soft and taste good, they are a nice change from sugar cookies.

The cookies are wonder ful! So yummy! However, the vanilla is not in the directions, only listed in the ingrediants, so we forgot to put it in, but even without it they were spectacular. Also I had to use my own old recipie for frosting. The 4 cups powdered sugar to 1/4 cup oil did not work at all. At least not for me.

Okay, so I feel like a ding-a-ling with this recipe.  Please read the entire recipe as I added the 4 cups of powdered sugar in to my mixture!  I still make the batter as I couldn't see wasting all that butter.  Perhaps if you see this same recipe with 4 cups powdered sugar added, it will be my revised one!

I have been searching for an awesome sugar cookie with more flavor. These looke promising, and I even added a little almond extract and vanilla butter & nut extract. Still, they were very bland, except for the overwheming eggy flavor, which I did not like. I even made the cookies with one less egg yolk than it calls for. I guess my search will continue...

I have been looking a long time for the perfect "bakery" sugar cookie recipe. This is it. All others will be thrown away. I did double vanilla, and added about 1/4 tsp. lemon extract. Otherwise, just a PERFECT sugar cookie. Thank for sharing.

Made these for church. Followed the advice to add 1/4 cup sugar, doubled vanilla and added 3/4 tsp. almond extract. They were fabulous. There were none left (and we usually have leftover snacks). Got compliments big time. I chose to use the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe instead. These were the first sugar cookies I have ever made that worked and didn't spread out. Could still see clear shapes of angels, wreaths, Christmas trees.

This was a great recipe - I halved the recipe (so I wouldn't have to use so many eggs), and I still was able to get a good amount out of 1 batch. I added almond extract (2 tsp.), and that really added to this. Bake for only 8 minutes - 9 min. caused some of the edges to burn. I iced them w/ 'Sugar Cookie Icing' from this site.

This is an awesome recipe!!!!  The dough was so much easier to work with than other recipes I've tried (after chilling).  The cookies kept their shape when baking.  The description was exactly on target: big, soft sugar cookies.  Just like the bakery ones.

Great recipe for my fist time making cookies! I used a handmixer for all of the mixing even though on step one it actually says to "stir" it in the dry ingredients.  If there was a quality difference I didn't notice it.  I also added extra vanilla extract but I didn't have Almond extract but it still tasted pretty  good but I would not reduce the sugar in this recipe as sugar recommended is just right.  

The one thing I would say is that thickness of the cookies should probably be a little bit less than half inch because they really rise and lose their shape if you use cookie cutters.

I also couldn't believe how simple of the icing recipe was and I will never spend another dollar on store-bought icing again! It turned out nice and shiny. The kids had a blast decorating!

I didn't add almond extract as some reviewers recommended, and the cookies still turned out fabulous.  I am going to make this my staple cut out cookie recipe.  As is, this recipe made me 5 dozen varied sized cookies.  Delicious!  My husband asked what I added to these to make them so addicting and he is not usually a big fan of sweets :)

These were okay. I used them for special decorated cookies so they looked great, but were very dry and hard. I would be greatly disappointed if I had made them just for taste/texture. Very "animal cracker" like. They held up nicely to cutting and decorating, but I'm still on the lookout for a good sugar cookie recipe.

This cookies were easy to work with and tasted great (no nasty shortening after taste you get with so many other cut out recipes).  They stay soft which is an added bonus.

The perfect cookie for cut outs.  I have long searched for a sugar cookie recipe that was easy to roll out, easy to cut and one that held its shape in the oven that was not brittle or crispy when baked.  These cookies rolled out like a dream, held their shape and they are nice and soft.  Perfect with just a little sprinkling of sugar on top.

My 4 yr old son and I made the dough 2 days ago, then yesterday we rolled, cut out, baked and iced...They are FANTASTIC! If you like cake-like cookies then these will be to your taste.  They are moist thick and tasty.  Note that in the directions they forget to mention adding the vanilla...I added it with the eggs.

Perfect texture!  Very good cookie, I'd give it 5 stars but, the Cheryl's cookies are quite a bit sweeter (had some on hand, so I know for sure).  Next time I think I'll try substituting some 10x sugar for the regular.  Oh, and while the recipe looks massive, its a pretty normal sized.  I made them super thick and got probably 30-40 cookies.  Thanks for the recipe!  Will definately make again!

Had to look twice at recipe regarding how many eggs it called for. (Yes, it is right.)  I added almond flavoring instead of vanilla.  Dough was simply great to work with.  I was very pleased with results from this recipe and will use this as my cut-out cookie recipe from now on.

I thought this was petty good.  I wasn't paying attention and grabbed the baking soda instead of powder and didn't realize until I had added it.  I decided to go ahead and add the powder as well.  My first couple of patches puffed up a lot but in later batches, I olled the dough thinner and baked them slightly longer and that seemed to fix my mistake.  I will need to make this again the correct way to seem if it comes up to a 5 star.  I put it as a 4 star because the taste wasn't 100% what I was looking for.

THE best sugar cookie recipe EVER!  I've never cared for sugar cookies, but these ones are dangerous to have around.  They taste like the gourmet kind you pay $4 for at the coffee shop.  I'll never make another kind.

These are amazing cookies and disappear faster than any other I bake, especially when frosted.  They are identical to Cheryl's gourmet cookies and cost about one-tenth the price when you bake them yourself.  I was a long time customer of Cheryl's just for these cookies and was thrilled to find this recipe.  Thanks!

This is the easiest and best tasting recipe for cut outs I have ever done.  I've never been very successful in the past with cut outs but my 4 yr. old and I made these together very easily.  The icing recipe works great too and hardens after a couple of minutes sitting out!

I LOVE the sugar cookies this made, but more than that this is a very flexible recipe. I used this recipe as a base and filled with coconut/walnuts/cream cheese and powdered sugar to make mountain cookies. Then I rolled in small balls and indented the top to use this dough as a thumbprint cookie base and added some peach jam before baking! WOW! One recipe and I have three Christmas cookies for my party tomorrow night! THANKS!!!

This cookie alone is pretty bland, even with adding extra sugar, another teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of almond extract.  I thought more of a butter flavor would come through.  But with the icing on top, it's quite good.  I used my own decorator icing recipe, which is similar, then made this one when that ran out.  Be careful not to add too much water - it gets thin rather quickly.  I got about sixty 3" - 5" cookies.

These are my favorite sugar cookies.  I have not decided on my favorite icing or frosting for them yet.  I have tried the modifications mentioned in the other reviews and love them.  These are nice big soft cookies and everyone I bake them for love them.

These are simply The Best!!!  I read through the other reviews before making these and decided to add about 1/4 cup extra sugar, doubled the vanilla and added 3/4 tsp of almond extract, as another reviewer suggested.  They turned out wonderful!!!  We will be baking these for years to come on many holidays.  
Be careful not to overbake.  Nothing over 10 minutes and 9 seemed more appropriate most of the time.   Enjoy!  And thanks so much for the recipe!

I make a lot of cookies and was excited to try this recipe because of the reviews.  On the bright side, they do hold their shape well and appear to be sturdy; two of the things I was looking for in a cut out cookie recipe.  Unfortunately, even with the edition of the almond extract and some extra sugar, these cookies still seemed a bit bland to me.  However, they do make very pretty cookies.  I think they could be a bit more flavorful but others seem to really like them... I did not use the icing in the recipe and instead made one from the cake central site that worked fantastically.  I posted a photo.

I only had time to make one 
xmas cookie recipe and my son wanted sugar cookies.  I chose this recipe and made him do all the work - even separating the eggs.  The first thing he said upon tasting the finished product was "Ugh - these are disgusting!".  Yes - they are thick, but they are dry, bland and tasteless. My son and I prefer chewy, sweet cookies.  These were niether.  Even my husband, who prefers drier, less sweet cookies like shortbread, thought these were bad.  He said they definitely need sugar - maybe something else too.  I was looking for a cookie that tastes good on its own and doesn't need frosting.  These were definitely not it.  I would never make these again.

I wish I liked these as much as the other 8 reviewers, but unfortunately I think they are awful.  I've gone over and over the recipe, hoping I did something wrong, but I didn't.  They just taste so bland and are way too thick for my liking.  Better luck next time.  SORRY.

I was amazed these tasted like Lofthouse cookie!  I dipped my cookies and had no breakage.  I rolled to 1/2 thick and dough was smooth and silky.  I has this recipe saved and will make again and again.

Great recipe! Added extra 1/4 cup of sugar and 1 tsp of almond extract as other reviewers did.   This is definitely a keeper.  I stirred the flour in by hand and the dough came out so easy to roll out. Be careful not to roll out to thick or they will come out blobby.  I just ate those ones, especially warm out of the oven.  Made the frosting as well but substituted the vege oil for light corn syrup.  It came out great as well.

This will be my default cut-out cookie recipe from now on. I followed the advice of other commenters, adding 1/2 cup more sugar, as well as vanilla and almond extract. The dough was even delicious! (Except, we aren't supposed to say that, right?) :)
What I loved most about this recipe was that it was really easy to roll, and most importantly, re-roll. I was able to use every last bit of dough, which has been difficult with other recipes that dry out. 
I used powdered sugar instead of flour to roll the dough, and that worked just great, especially since the dough isn't super sweet. 
I froze the baked cookies to use for decorating later, and they thawed perfectly.

Absolutely LOVED this cookie recipe....I halved it because I only had 5 eggs on hand.  It still made a nice bunch of cookies.  I did not use the frosting recipe listed but stuck to my old standard icing.  Love the Almond flavor and the slight crunch at first bite but soft inside. :-)  They kept their shape so the Rabbits, chicks, and carrots stayed nice for decorating.  I rolled my dough to about 3/8 inch rather than 1/2 just so I could make more with half batch recipe and they were still plenty BIG and FAT....see my photo above.  :-)  Happy Easter baking everyone!

I LOVE the taste of this cookie! I was looking for a thick, dense sugar cookie...this is it!  Made according to recipe except that I added 1/2 tsp almond extract. I used my own recipe for the frosting and they were perfect! My only drawback is that they somewhat lost their shape when cooking, even though I chilled the cookies for 15 minutes after rolling them out. Now I'm on a search to solve that dilemma!

These cookies are so delicious!  I didn't get 75 cookies out of the batch.  I might have made them on the thicker side which made them cake like.  Very good.

This cookie was alright but it was more of a short-bread cookie and not a sugar one. It was not very fluffy or sweet. We even doubled the sugar and the vanilla. But we did dip half of the cookie in hardening chocolate and it was quite good. I would use it again if i wanted short-bread.

My friends and our five children (aged 3-5) made cutouts from this dough after letting it sit overnight.  It was so easy to work with that all the kids could cut out completely on their own.  8 minute bake time was PERFECT, and when it came time to ice, not a single cookie cracked or broke, in the hands of toddlers!  Delicious, thick, sturdy, yet moist cookies:) All my friends will be using this recipe again.

I've been looking for the best cut-out cookie recipe for first birthday cookie favors, and this is it - third time lucky! :) I tried two other recipes (from this site) which got great reviews but were not the best for what I wanted to do. The dough was easy to handle and the cookies kept their shape. I didn't make the frosting, because I wanted to use fondant. The cookies are indeed bland on their own, so I thought I would have to tweak the recipe or try yet another, but after I decorated it with Satin Ice fondant and royal icing, it was perfect! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Turned out amazing.  I also baked them on a stone so the bottom was just the perfect golden color.  Cookies were soft, but firm.  This is my go to sugar cookie recipe for now on.

I had no luck with this recipe except that the cookies cooked perfectly. Even with refigeration, even after being in the freezer, the dough was almost too sticky to work with for cut-outs. They don't hold the cut-out shape very well, owing to significant puffiness. But the real issue was the flavor - even with extra sugar, they were still very bland. I advise adding white chocolate morsels, A LOT OF THEM. Icing also did not work out, owing to being very greasy from the vegetable oil. That's kind of a lot of oil in my book. This recipe results in a cake-like consistency, which is fine, but the flavor needs triple the vanilla, add rum, orange extract, *something*

Thank you - just what I was looking for!  The cookies held their shape and were thick and yummy.  Also added almond extract to the dough.  Perfect.

These tasted awsome.  The texture was exactly was I wanted.  They remind me of the cookies at the grocery store, which I love.  All though I wish I could find a sub for egg yolks.  Makes me feel guilty when I eat 20 cookies in one sitting:)  I only made one change.  I used splenda in place of the sugar.  The dough was great and I didnt have to chill or flour my area.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!! It is so completely fail proof (which is the best thing ever when you have a 3 and 4 year old helping). They taste great and are thick and chewy.

These are the BEST cookies! I decided to make several batches to feed a large wrestling team(65 boys) I should have given myself more time cause I was rushed. But they were so much fun to make. The icing is excellant. You can choose how thick you want the cookies, the layers of icing, and double up on the batch with the same results everytime. Thanks Kelly!

I hated these, but my husband who likes desserts that aren't too sweet thought they were good.  Maybe it's because I wasn't making a cookie that I wanted to taste frosting.  Without the frosting these are VERY bland- I ended up putting bluberry jelly on mine and eating it like a biscuit.  I added extra sugar, vanilla, and some lemon extract after reading the reviews that these tended on the bland side and they are still too bland.  Maybe I should have used almond extract instead, but the recipe as written is so far from the sweet sugar cookies I enjoy that I can't even recommend this as a base recipe.  If you like to have just a hint of sweetness or enjoy the taste of icing over the cookie flavor this recipe might work perfectly for you since they do have a great texture and consistancy.

This was my first time making cut outs and this recipe was easy and tasty! I made enough cookies for a bridal shower with just one batch of dough. I had such great feedback that I made a batch of Christmas Cookies as well! Easy to follow and easy to work with.

I cut the recipe to 25 servings as 75 is too much for 2 people.  The recipe never told you to add the vanilla extract but fortunately I caught that.  The dough was too sticky to roll after hours of refrigeration.  I did as others suggested and added flour.  The cookies turned out beautiful but had no flavor.

Excellent cookies with perfect icing.  Nice, soft, moist...good!  I had to incorporate a little more flour to the dough when it came time to roll it out, it started out way too sticky to work with, but that's the only thing that I changed!

Doubled vanilla and added almond for more flavor.  Cookies turn out beautifully - will never use another cut out recipe.  I've made these 3 times now and get rave reviews b/c they are so pretty.  I didn't use the glaze from this recipe.  I use "Sugar Cookie Icing" from this site.

I just love this cookie recipe and so did my family!  This is the 1st time making them and they are great!  This will be the only cut-out cookie that I will be making!  I didn't change a thing with the recipe.  My husband said that they are very addicting!  I made them last weekend for a friend of the family who races cars.  They were perfect for cutting out in the shape of his race car and decorating exactly like his car.  The dough is very easy to work with and they actually looked and tasted professional.  Too bad I forgot to take a picture of them!  I am going to make them today for a picnic in the shape of flowers!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Five stars because I think it's really difficult to find a great cut-out cookie recipe! Like others I also added some extracts: 2tsp almond and 1/2 tsp butter - though 1 tsp butter probably would have been ok too. This has given these cookies the PERFECT flavor. That said - I haven't even cooked them yet! So far they are just dough - but the dough is amazing haha! I wanted a recipe because I wanted to make my father-in-law a nice batch of cookies for Father's Day like they have at those expensive designer cookie shops at *gasp* $8 per cookie! That's insane to me. These are going to taste even better! I'll post an update and a photo after they are finished!

Right now, this is the only cookie recipe I use.  However, I do change it a bit, so I only gave it four stars.  I add 1 Tbsp. of vanilla, 1 tsp butter extract, and I use butter flavored crisco in place of half of the butter to prevent spreading.

I was in the market for a big, soft sugar cookie and this recipe didn't disappoint.  The only change I made was to add 2 teaspoons of vanilla and one teaspoon of almond extract (per other reviewers' suggestions).  These cookies represent a big investment in time, effort, and ingredients, but I think they're worth it!  I didn't make the frosting because I already had some leftover.  They were great for Valentine's Day.  Thanks!

I love this cookie recipe!  It is so yummy and not too sweet!   You'll definitely want to refrigerate the dough.  I refrigerated mine overnight and it was perfect!  Remember to refrigerate any scraps you want to re-roll and cut out.  Once the dough warms up it's difficult to work with.  I didn't use the frosting listed on this recipe.  Instead I used the 'sugar cookie icing' recipe listed on the site.  I made these for Christmas and got multiple requests for more.  I'll be making them for Valentine's Day as well.

This is my first experience with cut out sugar cookies. It was very easy to make. I thought the thicker cookies tasted the best.Important that you dont over bake them. It should still be white-ish in color when done. I found that the frosting was not that good at all. I liked the consitancy but not the flavor. Good thing i had a back-up store bought cookie frosting. Overall it was pretty good. I will probably make the cookies again, but definitely not the frosting.

The best! For cut-out cookies, this will now be my one and only recipe. These held their shape well and tasted great. The only change I made was I substituted the vanilla for almond...just personal preference!

This dough is so easy to work with and didn't spread while baking. I only got 3 dozen from this. While this is a decent cookie and turned out beautiful and okay tasting, I'm just not sure it is worth the 10 eggs to make only 3 dozen cookies. I used margarine instead of butter. The icing was not very good though. It was lacking flavor and tasted oily. It was really easy to work with though and dried slowly so you didn't have to rush to get candies to stick. After they were iced, the oil weeped from the icing and made little beads on top of the cookies. I'll admit I'm rather inexperienced with cut outs and frosted cookies, but I don't think this was my bad, I think it's the recipe. I've always used butter, crisco, or margarine, all I know is the oil didn't work well at all, heck maybe it's just me since no one has mentioned it? Thanks, I had great fum trying out these cookies and many happy goodie/gift recipients.

Really very good, but still not the cut-out cookie I'm looking for. I found out as the process went on that rolling the dough thicker, makes for a softer and better cookie. I cooked them 8 minutes as many reviews recommended. I also added almond extract to the mixture prior to adding the flour. For icing I made a family favorite of butter Crisco shortening, confectioners sugar, vanilla and almond extract. I think I will make these again and "tweak" them a bit to see if I can get them just a little softer. If I can, then these will be the perfect cut out cookies in my opinion. By the way, the dough is really easy to work with! I really appreciated that. I'm sure my family and friends will enjoy these cookies over the holiday. Merry Christmas and thank you for sharing your recipe.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as stated...except that it does not state when to add the vanilla extract but it isn't too difficult.  This was my first time making cut out sugar cookies and I am quite pleased.  If you refrigerate the dough long enough and make sure you use plenty of flour they roll out quite nicely.  DO NOT go past the recommended cooking time...I burnt my first batch...oops! As for the finished product, I think these cookies are definitely meant to be iced because the cookie itself is not too sweet (which I like).  I think the overall flavor of the cookie is nice and my boyfriend enjoyed them also.  Don't skimp on the icing! Yum!

I thought these were alright.  I took them to a party and everyone else liked them more that I did.  I did use part vanilla extract and part almond extract and I think it gave them more flavor.  The dough was easy to work with.

Great recipe.  I added extra vanilla (our family loves the flavor) and no almond; however, I'll try the almond next time.  They turned out great even though I added an extra egg because I lost count while on the phone!

Thank you to whoever submitted this recipe. I used this for my first attempt at making cut-outs and they turned out fantastic! I would definitely use almond extract next time I make them to give them a little more flavor, but the consistency was perfect. As long as you roll them out on a floured surface, they'll be perfect! I had to add a lot more hot water than suggested for the icing...but it turned out great as well!

My search for a great rolled sugar cookie recipe is over.  I like the icing ingredients too as vegetable oil seems somewhat healthier than using the typical shortening.  Thanks!!!

AWESOME recipe!!  Perfect cookies.  I think I threw in a bit much almond extract but that was ok by me.  I LOVED it.  I read reviews saying these were very bland but mine were NOT!!  LOVED these cookies!!

I'm going to give this five stars (really 4 1/2) although I did tweak the recipe just a bit. I noted the directions didn't tell you when to add the vanilla, but I added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. almond extract to the wet ingredients before mixing in the dry..I'm sure most of you know to do this, but I thought that might mislead a unexperienced baker. These are perfectly soft and cut-out extremely well. They hold their shape nicely. Next time I think I may try all almond or all lemon extract. I frosted these with standard homemade buttercream frostings - one made w/ lemon and the other rum. Yummy!

I am the hero of Christmas.  I baked these last night. I followed the advice of other reviews and tweaked the cookie recipe with a bit of almond extract and a extra vanilla extract. Also, my oldest daughter tweaked the icing by using our standard butter cream recipe.  The end result turned out great.  

Our whole family loves Cheryl's cut-outs.  Our local Cheryl's Cookies gives out a cookie for each 'A' on a report card.  Now my daughters don't need to get A's to enjoy the same cookies (uh, oh...).

Just what I was looking for. I wanted a thick, soft sugar cookie that was easy to make, roll out, and work with, and that could be used in Christmas cookie baskets. This one was perfect. I hate making cut out cookies, but this recipe was SO easy I think I could stand to make them again. They were very sturdy and I frosted them with 'Grocery Store Frosting' from this site. I baked them for 9 minutes, took them out before they were brown and got 80 perfect looking cookies.

I belong to a woman's club and we have used this recipe twice at fundraisers. They have gone over very well both times. 1 of the fundraisers was a "Decorate Your Own Cookie" the cookies withstood decorating by young children! Durable and delicious!

The best!  Just what I was looking for.  The other reviews are right though.  You need to add almond extract.  Very soft and melts in your mouth.

This is the worst cookie recipe ever!  Me and my kids have been doing cut out cookies for years and this has to have been the biggest disaster ever.  The dough did not roll out and the few we did get to cook did not have any taste to them.  I do not recommend this recipe at all.  I suggest looking on for another recipe.

I'm sorry, but these are near to the worst sugar cookies I have come across. I added a little extra sugar and vanilla..so the flavor was ok but still somewhat bland and very dry. I iced them but with different icing because the one in the recipe I didn't like. Too much much product too little results.

This was absolutely the best cut-out recipe I have ever made.... I made them on Valentine's day for my boyfriend and he loved them. The icing was the perfect touch also, I added milk instead of hot water, and to the batter about 1/4 cup more sugar.... I'm definately making these again!

This recipe worked great! I had a little extra so I popped the rest in the freezer for a few days. If frozen, let thaw and it still works great. Make sure that the cookies are still very warm when you frost them. I put mine in the micromave for about seven seconds so that the frosting would go on better. Try adding lemon extract to the frosting. It tastes great!

These are the best sugar cookies!  I did add the extra sugar and almond flavoring.  If you don’t want the almond taste just leave out.  I used about 5 Tablespoons of hot water for frosting and added them one at a time.  Just a bit more oil too.

I made a half batch of these cookies for my daughter’s birthday party and they turned out thick, tasty, and beautiful! I did use a different recipe for royal icing. They turned out so good I decided today to make a full batch just for fun/practice and I’m starting to think that I may have forgot to put in the eggs the first go-round only using the egg whites. I don’t remember stirring in any yolks last time and the dough is so much wetter and sticky than last time. I guess we’ll see how they turn out.

Update: Yep eggs are definitely the problem. That is the only difference between the two times I’ve made these. The recipe as is results in sticky dough that is difficult to work with even after 3 hours of refrigeration and the cookies are too puffy to use royal icing. Using only the egg whites they were thick, flat and perfect

These rolled out beautifully and tasted good, but rose into a rounded mound and spread some too so lost my crisp edges.  I should have known, with 1 tbsp of baking powder!  Will try LilaLoa recipe next and compare.

Y'all. These cookies are definitely going in place of the 'Mary's Sugar Cookies' from Betty Crocker that I've made every year since I was a kid. So buttery, rich, flavorful. A real keeper.

I’m very pleased to have found a cut out cookie recipe that worked! I’ve tried many times and I’ve always been discouraged by difficult dough. Not this time! I made 1/2 recipe exactly as written and yielded 24 nice thick 4-inch star cookies. I took the advice of another reviewer and rolled the dough out and wrapped in plastic wrap before chilling overnight. This seemed to have helped as it required very little handling before cutting. I worked with about a 6x12 inch section at a time, and briefly placed the remaining dough in the freezer while I cut cookies. I iced with Royal Icing I which was perfect.

Simply the best!  This is the only cut out dough I have ever used that actually works.  The dough is very easy to work with.  Every cookie comes out of the cutter perfectly.  The texture is light and flaky, and the taste is outstanding.  My friends who ate them also raved about them.  I would definitely describe these as butter cookies, though, not sugar cookies.

Update:  I made these again this morning and this is THE MOST AWESOME recipe. The dough is so easy to work with, and the cookies bake up beautiful and tasty. This recipe is worth every last ingredient that it calls for. Don't shortcut yourself to go with a recipe to save on eggs.

This is an awesome recipe! And it is the recipe that I have been searching for for 20 years. The cookies taste great, they hold their shape just like cookies by design cookies, and the dough is very easy to work with. I have not tried the icing recipe,  as I have my own recipe that I have been working on for 20 years as well just waiting on this  cookie recipe to come along.  :)

This is a great recipe! I love love how these cookies turned out. I read the reviews beforehand and I decided to add 1 teaspoon of vanilla and add 3/4 tsp of almond extract. I also added the extra 1/4 cup of sugar for a sweeter taste. I had one a couple days after I made them and they still are so nice and soft. I will definitely make these again!! This makes a lot of dough. I ended up having to freeze some of it, maybe next time I'll just do half!

Very best sugar cookie recipe ever! When i read the ingredient list i thought this would make way too many cookies, but turned out to be about 6 dozen large cookies. I added half tsp additional vanilla and eighth of a cup additional sugar.  The dough was easy to roll and cut out and they really didn't spread at all.  HUGE hit with the family and my new go-to for sugar cookies.  Very happy, thank you for the great recipe!!

Delicious and great for decorating! I reduced the sugar by ~15% because the frosting is so sweet. Definitely will make again!

BUSY moms cooking with kiddos: This recipe is not separated and includes frosting ingredients in the main body. I suppose its common sense but with 10 eggs on the counter and 2 kids its easy to throw it all in the bowl and I wasted a box of butter, 10 eggs and all the sugar (regular and confection) on my first attempt because I didn't read carefully.  
These are good if you have the time, but like others have said, there are easier recipes that use far less ingredients- I like these only for large batches/special occasions and when I have the time. you can make a half batch and it still makes plenty, and I add 1T Vanilla extract.

For me, these were the perfect sugar cookie!  if you keep thick they get so big and soft which is how I prefer mine.  I followed other reviewer suggestions and doubled vanilla and added almond extract and increased sugar.  Next time I will double vanilla and lighten up on sugar and almond extract for the perfect sugar cookie for me!  Thank you for a delicious cookie I will enjoy for years to come!

They take me 3 days to make because of cooling times but they are well worth it.  Because of the added oil, it actually takes a good day for the icing to set.  Some people like them unfrosted as well.

Great cookies with easy to handle dough. I liked the frosting. I've never used oil in my frosting before but it gave the frosting a slight shine.

This is the recipe I've been looking for!  I halved it and that worked fine.  I yeilded 3 1/2 dozen cut outs.  The cookies keep their shape beautifully.  I had a little trouble with the points on my stars getting a little too brown.  Next time I'll do them separate and cook a little less time.  Used a timer for all of them and the bigger shapes definitely took the full 10 minutes.

No changes...perfect with the vanilla and almond extract!  Had to make two batches for 20 girlscouts that will be decorating a very large "house" cookie
8" tall and 6" wide!  I imagine each house was equal to about 6 regular sized cookies!

I left out the 1/4 part when adding flour and only chilled for1/2 hour as the dough was too hard to roll out and became crumbly. I also increased vanilla to cookie dough to 2 tsp. The recipe for the frosting was DEAD ON MATCH  and I received lots of compliments . Great combo! Easy to make!

These are good. Followed the recipe exactly, except cut everything in half. The butteriness and sweetness are perfect! I would call them butter cookies, like the danish ones we used to get in the round blue tin. The flavor is very good, not overly sweet. I would add a little almond or vanilla extract,  glaze and rainbow sprinkles, that's all they really need. If you like those Danish cookies in the round blue tin, you will like these. They are crispy on the outside and tender and yummy on the inside. They have a good "bite".  The only thing is they spread out far too much when baking, so it's going to need to be: refrigerate dough, roll and cut out, refrigerate (or freeze) again, then bake. It's this melty kitchen of mine. They also rose too much for decorating and lost some of their shape, so we ate them plain because I didn't want to waste my Frosting I spent so much time on, and we didn't have any sprinkles. I'm new to making cookies, but these were just fine plain with a cup of coffee, although for company I'd add glaze and sprinkles, of course.  Also some of the cutters we used were large ones which may have been a factor. I've since learned that to prevent the cookie from puffing up too much, try rolling out thinner, and/or use smaller cutters. 
If I ever make butter cookies, I'll make these using simple small round cutters. They're so good with coffee! Thanks for sharing!

I made half a batch. I did use whipping cream instead of the egg yolks and added almond extract. Very delicious! Only got 3 dozen heart shaped cookies which I frosted w/melted chocolate.

Hi everybody!
For the past two months I've been experimenting with sugar cookies to make the ultimate sugar cookie for the holidays. This recipe I've made time and time again, the fanily actually had to ask me to stop, they couldn't control themselves around these!
Any ways, here are some tips.
Make sure the butter is softened, it's ok if it's a little melted. You want to cream the sugar and butter together, and if you feel you've creamed it enough, you haven't! You want tendinitis! Keep going (I suggest with a wooden spoon) until it is really, really fluffy. 
Add the eggs one at a time, only use the wooden spoon and fold the egg in until it is fully incorporated, do not whisk or mix fast. Do this with each separate egg. (it's fun to do this with farm eggs, because the yolks change the color a lot.)
add the dry ingredients in increments, never whisking or stirring too fast. 
Also, when baking, make sure to turn the cookie sheet around completely about 3/4 of the way through baking, this will make it bake more evenly.
When cooling, let it cool in the still hot cookie sheet until the don't bend when you try to pick them up, and then let them cool the rest of the way on the cooling rack.
These were truly amazing, and I'm getting requests for them so often, I'd think they'd be long sick of them by now!

This is a really great recipe! I followed Nikki's suggestions and added almond extract and used a different icing recipe. This recipe made around 50 cookies for me and they definitely held together really well when packaged! Tasted wonderful also! I am absolutely going to make them again! Probably tomorrow because they make SUCH great gifts! Thank you to Nikki for the suggestions and thank you to Margo for posting this recipe for others to enjoy!

So simple and easy!!  Love the cookies!  They are perfect. Easy to roll and cut out. I added 1 tsp of almond flavoring to the batch and they melt in your mouth. I am using a different icing with corn syrup.

After I figured out how to work with the dough I really liked how these baked up.  My initial problem was I wasn't thick enough.  1/2 inch seems SO thick, at first, but it really does make for the best end result.  Make these when you're wanting soft, chewy,  sugar cookies.  I did all sorts of Christmas shapes but liked the outcome of the round the best.  Very good.  Will use again.

This was the perfect sugar cookie. I won't consider another recipe! Thanks! I've made these twice and both times turned out beautifully with no browning. Also they stay soft for several days. I roll them out and cut them directly onto parchment paper, remove the scrap, and lift the whole sheet carefully onto the cookie sheet. Zero drama from transferring raw cutouts and no sticking at all.

These were the best sugar cookies I've ever made or eaten!  The only thing different that I did was to add almond extract. They were so easy to roll out and I will never use another recipe!

Agree with most-these are easy cookies to make, but somewhat bland in taste. I added 3 tablespoons of orange juice when creaming the butter and sugar.

I'm taking 1 star away due to confusion in the ingredients and directions (maybe it'll get edited so you don't have the same problem). The ingredients do not designate what is for the cookie and what is for the icing, but after reading it was pretty easy to separate what's what, except that the vanilla in the icing directions calls for 1 tsp but on ingredients list you have 2 listings for vanilla. One for a half tsp the other for 1 1/2 tsp. Which one to use for the cookie? We'll there enters the other problem. If you follow the directions it never tells you to add vanilla in the cookie directions. So, I went through the making of the recipe, put it in the frig, and then realized she had vanilla in the ingredients for the cookie. Took it back out, but didn't know how much to add; 1/2 tsp or 1 1/2 tsp. I ended up, thankfully just reading what other reviewers said and added 1/4 cup more sugar, 1Tbl of vanilla extract and 1tsp of almond extract. Now with all said and done, the cookies are yummy.

Just like the description says.....big soft sugar cookies! I cut the recipe in half because I didn't want 75 cookies like the serving states. After halving it, I ended up with only 25 cookies! But they are delicious. I live in SD and temps have been -10 to -20 during the day, so I set my dough outside 7 min to chill. The dough was a little on the hard side, oops!, but oh so easy to work with. I've frosted them and ate 3 cookies already. YUM! I can see where adding almond extract would be a delicious enhancer-might try that next time. Thanks for the great recipe and Merry Christmas!

Love Love Love this recipe... I add almond extract ( 1tsp ) in addition to the vanilla extract.. in the frosting as well...also I roll them out to be a bit thicker so it doesn't make 75 cookies.

I made this recipe last year for our Super Bowl Party and they were a hit!!!  I never make cut out cookies because I always have a problem with rolling out the dough.  This recipe was SUPER EASY!  I had NO problem rolling the dough out and the cookies were soft & chewy!!  This time I rolled the dough into cookie sheets and cut them into bars.  Easy, only cook about 12 minutes or they will be dryer.  I then glazed them.  They are still a hit in my house.

Best Sugar Cookie Ever.  The recipe is perfect.  It's so easy to use cutouts.  Instead of frosting we added colored sugar to the cookies before baking and it was just the right amount of sweetness.

I was skeptical, and the recipe isn't extremely clear.  When it says add the eggs one at a time, I did the whole eggs, then the egg yolks. It also did not specify when to add the 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract into the cookie mixture.  Although I did not use this frosting recipe (I used Wilton's poured fondant recipe) this one says 1/2 tsp vanilla, and in the directions says add 1 tsp.  
Regardless, these were delicious, and tasted like the Cookies by Design cookies.  I did not adjust the flour or anything else.  They were great.

I have tried MANY sugar cookie recipes and this is by far the best I have found! I did double the vanilla, as others suggested. I also let the dough chill for about 3 hours, as I was baking other things. The cookies are soft and flavorful!!

For as long as I remember, my family has used the Betty Crocker Cookbook recipe for sugar cookies, and they have always come out poofy and dry. I always thought that is what sugar cookies tasted like. Then, my sis and I wanted to do something different this year. We found this recipe, and are so glad we did. Firm but also soft, they are delicious without the frosting. Glad that we found a recipe to become our new tradition!

These were excellent!  I cut the recipe in half, added more vanilla and added a bit of almond extract.  I did not use the frosting recipe.  I only chilled the dough for an hour.  The dough was a dream to roll out!  They baked beautifully and are soft but crumbly.  I am so happy that I found this recipe!

Frosted sugar cookies are my families' favorite cookie but i rarely bake them since they're so time consuming.  This recipe was worth the effort because the dough was so easy to roll out and they are delicious.  I am throwing out all my other sugar cookie recipes because this one is the best by far!  I did add 1/4 c more sugar and in addition to the vanilla, I added 3/4 t of almond extract as many other reviewers did.  I used my own butter frosting recipe.  Look no further, this recipe is a winner!

I don't think I can say enough good things about this recipe, to be perfectly honest. I made them for Christmas 2011 and they were amazing. They rolled out and cut super easy and they baked up perfect! The only change I made was I added about 1 tsp Vanilla and 1/2 tsp of Almond extract. Then when I made the icing I used only almond in it. They were so delicious and really easy to decorate.

These are fantastic!  Easy to mix, easy to roll, cut out well.  Best of all they hold a very crisp edge in the oven when the dough is well chilled!  Can be cut very thick or we preferred a touch thinner, but still on the thicker side as compared to the usual 1/4 inch. Only downside is the number of eggs required.  I also would at least double the vanilla.  Plan to add almond extract with my second batch!

These are good but don't get your hopes up if your looking for the Cheryl's Cookies Sugar Cookie recipe. Also, these are not super sweet so they definitely need frosting.

These cookies are what ive been looking for, they dont deform when you put them in the oven. However my cookies were about half an inch thick like it said in the instructions and my sisters cookies were about a fourth an inch. My cookies puffed up so much and hers were relatively flat good for decorating and icing i would recommend rolling it a little under half an inch

These are amazing!  My husband loves sugar cookies and I have tried several recipes over the years but I have finally found a winner.  Like many of the reviewers suggested, I added 1 T. vanilla extract and found that amount to be perfect.  I also baked on parchment paper rather than greased cookie sheets and had no problems with sticking.

My goodness, what a wonderful recipe. I have to admit that I forgot to add the vanilla to the cookies, but even the same the cookies tasted perfect! The next batch I make will include the vanilla, because the instructions to add wasn't in the recipe. Otherwise these cookies kept their cookie cutter shape and didn't taste too sweet. They weren't too cake-like and they weren't too crisp. They were soft, just like I like them. I will definitely be making these when I have a craving for sugar cookies.

Great recipe that makes lots of cookies.  Used 1/2 the dough for Spritz cookies (chilled only 1 hour for those), and they worked great!!!!  Tweaked flavors:  doubled the vanilla, added 3/4 teas. almond extract, and 1/4 C. granulated sugar.  Frosted them with Sugar Cookie Frosting recipe found seperately.  Yum!

I made these for my Dad for Father's Day.  I am extremely impressed by them.  The dough was super easy to mix up.  I did add some almond and butter flavoring just because others did and I had it on hand.  I refrigerated the dough overnight and just took out what I was rolling at the time and let the rest in to stay cool.  I did have to use quite a bit of extra flour in order to get them to roll well.  The dough was pretty sticky but nothing common sense couldn't fix.  Extra flour did the trick.  The stability of the cookie after it was baked was impressive.  Nice and soft and thick but held the frosting so beautifully.  PERFECT COOKIES!  I made my own icing.

Used these for a birthday party with just a basic Royal icing. Without the icing, they were just ok, but having said that, they were just right with it. Perfect really. And rolled out and baked up perfectly. I topped them with those printed cupcake toppers I purchased, and they had each child's name on them, perfect treat/place setting!

A great cut-out sugar cookie!! I doubled the vanilla, but that was the only change. When I baked these, I did bake them on parchment paper. They spread out a little bit, but kept their shape very well. The cookies are soft, but still sturdy enough for frosting and decoration. I have searched long & hard for the perfect sugar cookie recipe, and this is it!!

This cookie is so mild.  I use frosting that consists of 1 stick of real butter, 1 box of powdered sugar, 1 tsp. flavoring like lemon, vanilla or maple and then you add a little milk to get it to a nice spreadable consistancy. You can color it any desired color. I only bake the cookies for 7 minutes on parchment paper and they come out perfect every time!  I have also just sprinkled them with colored sugar before baking and that turns out really nice too.

Taste is excellent but I had a hard time getting my shapes to come out right because the cookies fluffed so much.  The stars came out perfect but more intricate shapes did not.  All in all a great recipe.  Will try again.  Maybe I did something wrong.

With the addition of 2 tsp. vanilla & 1 1/2  tsp. almond extracts  to this dough, I will never use another sugar cookie recipe. These bake perfectly without spreading (I bake on a parchment lined pan) and taste amazing when decorated with royal icing.  It's difficult to convince people you made, not bought them!  My husband is by no means a cookie guy, and he can't keep his hands off these.  Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe!

Perfect Sugar Cookie!!!  Usually I am not a big fan of sugar cookies, but these are terrific!  I made them for my son's preschool class teachers and they loved them.  I frosted mine with buttercream frosting and they turned out adorable.  We are going to be making a batch today so we can leave some for Santa!!!

These cookies were soft and thick with just the right amount of flavor.  I followed the directions exactly as written.  They are definitely meant to be frosted.  I had to add a lot more water to the frosting than called for, but it still turned out good.  I'll make these again!

Wow! Incredibly soft and foolproof! Last year was my first time making sugar cutouts and I had a really hard time with the recipe I used. This recipe is sooo much better, great instructions, easy to mix, roll out, cut out, and great without any frosting.

Easy recipe! Yummy cookies. They stayed fresh and soft for a while. I did add 3/4 tsp of almond extract as others suggested. We made it together with my 4 y.o daughter  it was lots of fun. Thanks for sharing!

Very good when frosted,very nice texture, but not much taste without the frosting.  I will use orange extract in addition to vanilla next time, I will surely make these again.

Overall I thought this was a pretty average sugar cookie recipe.  The dough mixed well and it was easy to roll out.  I refrigerated it for about two hours and it was still soft but not very sticky.The cookies baked well and had a nice texture but they didn't have much flavor.  The icing didn't have much flavor either, just a little sweet.  This wasn't a bad cookie, just not what I was hoping for.  I think I'll keep looking.

12/18 These actually tasted better the second (now third) day.  They're still soft and kind of chewey rather than cakey so this is a pretty good recipe.  I might stick with these...I'm not sure.

For extra flavour and as I don't like Almonds, I added a bit of cinnamon and it really worked out very well.

These are just okay for us.  They do make nice cutouts, no puffing ut of shape or anything, but for us they could be a little sweeter tasting.

The cookies were dry and crumbly.  They sizzled when they baked.  They're not thick and delicious.  They were difficult to roll out and form into shapes.

We love this cookie and the icing. The key is to not over-bake them. They should be white all around, not browned!

I really liked this recipe and will use it again.  It was easy to make and the cookies baked up nice and soft but held their shape well.  They were great to frost & decorate.  I do, however, agree that they could have used a little more flavor.  Maybe double the vanilla or add some almond extract, but the frosting does sweeten them up.  They sure disappeared fast!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  :)

Excellent cookies -- got lots of compliments.  Also very easy to work with for the rolling/cut-out impaired baker (ME!).  I added almond extract for extra flavor, and intend to use peppermint extract for Christmas cookies.

This recipe was a big hit when i brought them to school for valentine's day, i used a powdered sugar icing w/ red food die.  People kept coming up and asking for more. It takes a while to roll out the dough and cut and then ice, but it's well worth it.  If you want a good sugar cookie recipe this is it.
