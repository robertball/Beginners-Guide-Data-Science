Simple, easy, fast. Used apple pie filling instead of cherry. Who doesn't love pudding?! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was a childhood favorite and I lost the recipe between moves. I was so happy to find the recipe again and it tasted just like I remembered- WONDERFUL! Very easy to make and wonderful for those work luncheons as it just needs to stay refrigerated- you can make it in the morning as it takes 10 minutes and by lunch it will be ready to serve! Enjoy as much as I did- it brought back many wonderful memories!

Absolutely yummy! I did make some substitutions but the dessert turned out great. I didn't have graham crackers so I sprinkled packaged graham cracker crumbs as layers and I added a layer of sliced bananas (I think I was craving banana cream pie at the time). A cinch to make and a big hit with the family. I will definitely make this again.

I wanted a quick through together dessert with ingredients I had in house so this fit the bill, however, the graham cracker dominated the taste and it was nothing special.

Delicious and easy dessert for everyone.  This can be made with low fat options for nearly every ingredient if desired.  This is my husband's favorite dessert!  We often swap blueberry pie filling for the cherry but either one is great!

Yum!  I needed a fast dessert and this fit the bill.  I modified to make it more "romantic" - just mixed chocolate pudding with some almond extract, and layered graham crackers/pudding in martini glasses.  Served topped with cocoa powder and cinnamon.  :)

Easy and so very good!  This is wonderful for an easy pitch-in dessert. I don't make it with the cherries though.

My mom made this dessert when we were kids but substituted the vanilla pudding for lemon pudding. She also sprinkled a teaspoon of sugar over the cherry pie filling. So glad I found this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Lovely dessert.  Easy to make, easy to keep the ingredients on hand - this is a go-to recipe when you need something quick and you have a few hours for the dessert to chill.  Also, this dessert is one you can mix and match pudding flavours and pie filling.  Keep this recipe in easy reach.

Yes, it's very easy to make,  you can also make it sugar free, use sugar free pudding mix and if you can find it use sugar free cool whip.
