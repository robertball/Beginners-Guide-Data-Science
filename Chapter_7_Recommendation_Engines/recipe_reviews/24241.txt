Altho my gang likes imitation crab, I don't, so being that I was the one making the appy's for our party, I used real crab. Loved the additions of the peppers and cheese. YUM and thanks!

I made this for a New Year's party and it was a hit.  Great with sliced crusty bread or crackers.  Not quite as cheesy and rich as some others (don't get me wrong, I like cheesy and rich) but this is good for a change and the spicy kick is nice too.  I'll definitely make it again.

Very good but i did not use mayo. Personal choice. I put this in a small crock pot and i had to make a second batch. Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

This was good. I used a little extra pepper jack, cuz I wanted to use it up. It had a nice flavor. My husband loved it! I'll make again for parties, very easy. Thanks!

A little oily but good. My husband enjoyed it but you really have to like the sweetness of imitation crab to like this. I would like to try this again but with real crab.
