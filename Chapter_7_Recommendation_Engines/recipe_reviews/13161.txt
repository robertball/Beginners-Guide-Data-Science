**FIRST OFF** This is a MOCK version of true Tom Ka Gai soup. However...the taste is very close to the real deal WITHOUT needing "hard to find" ingredients. We loved the ease of the recipe. TALK ABOUT A QUICKIE.

My changes:

NIX the turmeric - it made the soup sooo bright yellow! 

I almost doubled the lime juice.   I put in the required amount and then floated a few thick lime slices on top while it simmered.  I removed those before serving it.

I probably doubled the Cilantro.  I put some in while it simmered, and put more in just before serving.  

Instead of water I used low sodium/low fat chicken broth to round out the flavor.  

I added just enough Splenda Sweetner to “sweeten it up” just a little .  I’ve had this soup served both ways ( slightly sweet, and no sugar at all).   We prefer it slightly sweet.  "Sweet" just ROCKS the flavor of the lime!  I have never found Lemon Grass locally, so I quit worrying about it.  The soup was EXCELLENT and almost a DIRECT HIT for what we have eaten in upper end Thai restaurants. 

Do yourself a favor...and DO NOT SMELL THE FISH SAUCE.  It's PUTRID AND  DISGUSTING!  However...once mixed with the other ingredients something magical happens and it was beyond wonderful when all the flavors commingled!  

I like to put a small scoop of white rice into a bowl and add the soup over that.   

Next time I make it I'm going to try using 1/2 lemon juice -1/2 lime juice.
Will definitely make this again for company!

First of all, 'Kah' is galanga in Thai. Traditionally, 'Tom Kah' soup is predominantly flavored with three essential ingredients, namely galanga, lemongrass, and kaffir lime leaves, in which this recipe lacks. For a vegetarian soup simply substitute chicken with oyster mushroom. Galanga, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves add flavour to the soup and are pretty to look at in the bowl, but they are inedible. I often remove these ingredients by straining, then cook the meat or mushroom in the soup.

When I made this following the recipe exactly I thought it tasted horrible.  Then I added lemongrass and let it infuse with the chicken and left out the tumeric (coconut soup should be white).  Finally, I remembered when I took a cooking lesson from a Thai chef, she said to always always add sugar when using fish sauce.  I forgot the exact proportion by went by taste (had to add quite a lot).  Voila!  Now it's perfect.

This recipe is awesome.  To prevent curdling of coconut milk keep soup at a lower temperature.  I kept it at 200 degrees.  Do not bring it to a boil.  Also try to stir continuously.  I added thai chili sauce instead of cayenne, canned straw mushrooms, a pinch of sugar, low sodium chicken broth instead of water, 2 tbs of soy sauce with fish sauce, lime slices.  I did not mince the ginger I cut it in visible slices so that you could pick them out.  I did not use turmeric.  It tasted just like the tom ka at my favorite Thai place.  With a brand new baby it's hard to go out to eat so I am so glad that I could recreate this soup at home with the help of this recipe!

We loved this soup!  Even my 8 year old asked for seconds.  My husband said he thought it was even better than our favorite Thai restaurant.  The only changes I made were to use 2T soy sauce instead of 4T fish sauce and chicken stock instead of water.   Do yourself a favor and make this soup!!!!!

I don't try this recipe but have some suggestion.  Normally when we cook soup which need to add lime juice, we will add it after we remove the soup from heat.  So suggest to add lime juice after you remove the soup from the heat.  Adding lime juice during boiling, making it has bitter taste.  This is Thai's trick.  This method is applied for Tom yam as well.  For authentic Tom Kah Kai version, we don't need to sautee the chicken in the oil too.  And most important thing for this dish, don't make the coconut curd.

I would give this 6 stars if I could.  My family LOVES Thai food, and particulartly the coconut chicken soup.  Imagine my surprise when I found this extraordinarily simple and quick recipe that is just delicious! My only substitutions were to use low fat coconut milk, to switch the water for chicken broth and I also left out the turmeric.  Amazing, fast, and delicious!

This is fantastic! I added a 3rd can of coconut milk, 1/3 of a can of coconut cream & doubled the chicken. VERY quick & easy. It tastes just like the soup we used to drive an hour to order in our favorite Thai restaurant. Spicy & authentic. For each new guest I've served it to I've had to make a copy of this recipe.This is the best soup in my collection!

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I substituted chicken stock for the water, and I added fresh sliced mushrooms and sliced strips of red pepper for more interest.  Plus I added more chicken than the recipe called for.  A very tasty soup (just add more cayenne if you like it hotter) that was fast, easy, and quite similar to the authentic Tom Ka Gai we've eaten many times in Thai restaurants.

Tasted EXCELLENT, but I'd use light coconut milk next time to make it less fattening. Also, I couldn't find fish sauce, so I substituted soy sauce and that worked fine.

Thanks for this recipe!  I love This soup!  I've been wanting to make this soup for a long time but the "true" ingredients (galanga, Lemongrass, and lime kaffir leaves are near impossible to find at your average supermarket!  It was really easy to make too.  I also added some mushrooms.

Absolutely not authentic. A tip for keeping lemongrass, galangal and kefir lime leaves for those of us whose love them but have a hard time finding them (and don't use them all the time)... freeze them. Put each just as you get them fresh into freezer bags (no washing or other prep). Use them while still frozen by grating or mincing finely into your cooking. Do not thaw first! The freezing breaks down the texture of the lemongrass and lime leaves so that if you use fine bits it will not need to be removed before eating. One caveat, I do strip off the tougher outside of the lemongrass before freezing. You can do regular ginger this way too.

I loved this recipe. I added cumin and coriander and substituted srirachi sauce for the cayenne, peanut oil for the vegetable oil and chicken stock for the water.

I don't understand all the rave reviews for this soup. It is lacking the most basic flavors (such as lemon grass) and incorporates weird flavors like turmeric (which does not go in coconut chicken soup at all and totally ruins it!)

Wonderful.  Like other reviewers, I used chicken stock in place of water (increased to 4 cups - didn't want half a carton of stock to go unused - and it was still creamy and tasty!) and skipped the tumeric.  
-Simmered the stock with with bruised/crushed lemongrass and large pieces of ginger (instead of minced - roughly a 1 1/2 inch cube, sliced thick).  Removed before adding chicken and coconut milk.
-Doubled the chicken.
-I used substantially more cilantro, too (1/3-1/2 cup).  
I know it's inaccurate to leave a rating when I've made so many changes, but I appreciate the recipe and how easy it is to play with.  Guests and hubby loved it.

I made this tonight and it was great!  Like some of the reviews stated I used chicken broth instead of water and it turned out well.  I added 1 tsp of lemongrass paste. No tumeric and no pepper. Toward the end I also added sliced white onion and some mushrooms with the cilantro...and about 4 TBSP of sugar. It sounds like a lot be it works.  And finally.....shrimp instead of chicken!  Add it during the last two minutes and it turns out perfect.

Terrific with leftover roasted chicken and I didn´t have to saute them in oil first, which made the recipe even easier and healthier; just dump everything into the pot and boil. Put in 3 ginger slices (quarter sized), a pounded lemongrass stalk, one whole kaffir lime leaf,  and 2 whole cloves of garlic so that all can be easily removed before serving. I didn´t use tumeric nor green onion this time and substituted chili flakes for the cayenne. It was hard to keep to the exact measurements; just tasted and adjusted along the way. Added mushrooms for bulk. This is definitely worth a try not just for its exotic flavor but for its quick assembly as long as you have most of the ingredients in the pantry.

Yum! We consumed the whole pot.  Yes, it's a mock version. But even the Asian markets here don't carry the real ingredients so I think this is marvelous.  Serve over rice.  Add some sugar- a few tablespoons- to bring it all together.  Leave out turmeric.

This was delicious! I followed another reviewer's advice and crushed the fresh lemongrass with the flat end of a knife, and added in in large strips that were easily removed. I also added a large sliced carrot and sliced up half of a red bell pepper. Served over jasmine rice and topped with fresh thai basil. YUM!

Our family rarely agrees on a five-star rating.  But this one got rave reviews.  It's worth trying!  I thought it was good without the cilantro and green onion.  But those two ingredients took it to a whole new level.
Modifications: 2TBS soy sauce instead of fish sauce.  4 TBS sugar - it tasted too salty and sharp without, two red-skinned potatoes diced.

This soup was delicious!  I recently tried this for the first time at a restaurant, and had been looking for a comparable recipe.  I substituted chicken broth for the water, left out the turmeric, and used some Thai chili sauce I had lying around in place of the cayenne.  This is a tasty base to play around with.

Excellent recipe. I fell in love with this soup at a local Thai restaurant and I think this is just as good. I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and I added the sugar. I ended up using a 1:2 ratio of fish sauce to sugar. Yep, I had 8 Tablespoons of sugar but man, it made the difference. Generally, Thai food does have sugar in it's dishes. I loved it and I did add the lemongrass. I would like to add next time, the kiffer leaves and galanga to make it more authentic. I also did not include the tumeric because this soup should be white in color, not yellow.

This is great start for a soup that tastes much like Tom Ka Gai. As stated this is a mock version, without ingredients such as lemongrass or lime leaves. But, since you can get all of these ingredients at any grocery store, it's a good recipe to keep around. After I made this soup as directed, I tasted it. It wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I then added an extra Tbl of fish sauce, another 1/4 tsp of cayenne, and about a quarter cup sugar. I wanted more things to chew in the soup so I added sliced mushrooms and strips of sweet yellow onion. In each individual bowl I added the cilantro and green onion as directed. I also sprinkled extra cayenne on mine, I like it pretty spicy. I refrigerated the left over soup, and reheated it by the bowl the next day, it was much better the next day! The flavors had blended and the ginger had time to flavor the soup. Next time I make it I will either do it ahead or let it heat on the stove longer than the 10-15 minutes in this recipe. I gave it a four because made as the recipe says, it's just not quite right (for my taste) but it is a good base for you to start with and tweak to your taste.

I followed other reviews by adding lemongrass to the cooking chicken.  I reduced the fish sauce by half out of fear, and the soup was still WAAAY too fishy, so I started scrambling trying to compensate for the fish taste.  No matter what I tried, it's not working for me.  I'm really disappointed.  This sounded SO good when I first stumbled across it!  I'm sticking with curries from now on when I want Thai.

The simplicity of this soup is SO awesome.  I used chicken broth instead of water, left out turmeric, and added lemongrass. I also added fresh tomato chunks and sliced mushrooms, because all the Thai restaurants around here serve it that way, SO GOOD!!! (throw the tomato in at the end, just long enough for them to get warm.)

I was hesitant to use 4 tablespoons of fish sauce, but I'm SO glad I did. Something would be missing without it.

Finally, I cut some calories by using light coconut milk and non-fat, low sodium chicken broth. Tastes so much like the restaurant version! AWESOME!

My husband really enjoyed this soup but the rest of my family did not.  The coconut milk was really heavy; I prefer a much more broth-ier version of this soup.  I couldn't find light coconut milk in my store or I would've used that.  Next time, I'll add a can of chicken stock and a can of coconut milk instead of two cans of coconut milk.

I split the amount of ginger noted in half and also added a T of lemongrass, raw cubed tomato, a small can of shittake, and a big clove of grated garlic, and Marisa says it needs a smidge of extra lime juice.

I really like that this has easily accessible ingredients (although it is missing that truly authentic flavor) and is SO easy to make.  We all agreed that we would prefer it without the chicken---it didn't add any great flavor so if I want to add protein to this I will use tofu next time.  Really a fun tasting soup.

I absolutely love this recipe! I have made it twice and will keep on making it. I slightly cut down the fish sauce and turmeric and added fresh kaffir lime leaves and lemongrass. I also used chicken stock instead of water (as other's suggested)and added red pepper near the end of cooking for colour. Delish!!! Thanks so much for sharing this.

First of all, I left out the fish sauce because it sounded too disgusting to invest money in, but I can't imagine I would have liked the soup better had I included it.  I would have given this even less stars but my husband liked it once I added 1/4 c of sugar.  This soup is SOUR and odd-tasting.  Won't make again.

My husband really like this but I didn't think it was nearly as good as the one we had at the restaurant.  Reduce the amount of fish sauce by 1/2.  Also, add more red pepper to spice it up.  The tumeric does indeed turn the soup a neon yellow, but it also goes with the territory.

Whoa, this was WAY too salty, to the point of being inedible.  If I made this again, I would start with 2 tbsp of fish sauce instead of 4.  I don't know if it was the particular brand I used, but it overwhelmed all the other flavors.  I couldn't even taste the coconut.  I gave this three stars because I think it would have been good otherwise.  My husband also thought there was too much ginger, and it turned out yellow because of the tumeric.  Next time I would probably use a lemongrass infusion instead as others suggested, and only use 1 tbsp of ginger.

AMAZING! I have made this soup nearly half a dozen times since I found it and have added shrip, garlic prawns and sliced mushrooms to it and everytime it dissapears withing a couple days. This is a very hard recipe to mess up and is great the day after. It looks nothing like the picture shown (much more yellow) and cilantro should not be added to the soup until it is in your bowl as it turns brown and slimy if you have any leftovers in the fridge for any lenth of time. Also it separates when chilled and left for a while but just give it a stir and it is like you just made it!

Made this soup a few days ago, and my husband likes Thai food, and said it was good. I don't care for Thai food, so I would be a poor judge. I made it as is, except it was after Christmas, so I used left over turkey.

This was the first time I tried to make this soup. It came out fantastic. I did alter a bit to my taste. I used 1/2 the fish sauce, a bit of coconut sugar, as someone suggessted and added lemon grass. I also used chicken broth in place of water. I'm making coconut rice to go with this soup! It's stormy outside so this is perfect for today. Thank you for sharing.

I have been cooking all types of food for over twenty years, and this is the winner of all recipes I have ever tried. I can't even express how much I enjoy this recipe. It's a go-to recipe about once a month or so. We often substitute shrimp instead of the chicken and it's just amazing. I can't offer anything other than just cook it exactly as the recipe calls for, and you'll be very happy. The flavor is complex while still remaining delicate. I can't recommend this recipe enough. Amazing! I truly love it!

This turned out wonderful! I am so glad my sister recommended this recipe to me, Sept 2012.  

I left out the oil, cayenne pepper and turmeric.

Things I changed: chicken broth instead of water, 1 Tbsp soy sauce instead of fish sauce, chicken drumsticks cooked in the soup instead of boneless chicken meat, finely chopped crystallized ginger instead of fresh ginger.

I think I should add chicken pieces instead of chicken drumsticks, a little more soy sauce and ginger next time.

Honey thought the soup was okay, but he would rather have the real thing instead of this version.  W thought it was good and K didn't really like it.  I ended up eating most of the soup and thought it was delicious.

I was pleasantly surprised at how close this is to what I get out of a Thai hot pot at an authentic ethnic restaurant! Absolutely delicious! After reading the reviews, I added 2TBSP of sugar and left out the turmeric.  I added a few shiitake mushrooms and 1 teaspoon of lemongrass paste. Next time I will make it with chicken broth instead of water and hope to find galangal and lime leaves to refine the flavor. Thanks for the recipe. This will be a staple in our home!

I've always wanted to try Tom Ka Gai, but always get Chicken Panang when I go to a Thai restaraunt. This was excellent! I did add 1 TBS of palm sugar. Thai food should be salty, sour, sweet, and spicy. I also added sweet peppers and rice noodles to make it hardy for dinner. Definitely going to make this again.

This is delicious! The only changes I made were adding one cup of water instead of two, adding 1/4 cup of white wine to the chicken while it was cooking, and using chipotle chile powder instead of cayenne. (The only reason I did that was because we happened to have chipotle around the house, but had no cayenne.) I will definitely make this again, maybe add some veggies.

I was so excited to try this soup and will make it again sometime with some modification....While lime/lemon flavor is essential, 1/4 cup is too much.

A-MAZ-ING! I changed a few things based on other reviews. I used left-over chicken from the night before, chicken stock instead of water, I left out the  cayenne and turmeric, I added half a can of sweetened shredded coconut to balance fish sauce, culantro instead of cilantro, 1 cups broccoli slaw, and served it over brown rice. It was so good! Pretty fast too, I would make this again!

This was absolutely amazing and simple. I even had to substitute powdered ginger for regular and it was great. I coated the chicken in flour and pan seared them so that they woud retain their moisture and tenderness, also used a can of light coconut milk and reduced the cilantro by half.

Very yummy, but made a few alterations: added about 4 tbsp of truvia to add some sweetness. Also added an extra tsp of powdered Ginger, as we really like a strong Ginger flavor. Used lite organic coconut milk. Next time I will add more chicken and mushroom as well. Overall a great base recipe. Thanks for sharing!

excellent soup, everyone that I have made this for loves it!  I've used light coconut milk to make it a bit healthier it doesn't change the great flavor.  I have also substituted shrimp for the chicken, and I actually prefer it that way now.  Very easy and very tasty!

This is a great basic recipe. I did, however, have to make a few changes to the original: 1. Chicken broth instead of water 2. Used A LOT less coconut milk (about 3/4 of a can) 3. Used only a slice of lime instead of 1/4 cup 4. Added about 1 tbsp of Tom Yum Paste 5. Added about 3 or 4 tbsp of sugar I don't know how this recipe would be good without any lemongrass. The Tom Yum paste has lemongrass incorporated into it along with other ingredients that, in my opinion, are vital to the taste of the soup. After the modifications, the soup came out delicious!

I've been craving this since having it from a Thai restaurant a couple weeks ago.  I used low fat coconut milk, cut out the tumeric, used chunks of ginger that I took out after simmering, added 4 Tbl sugar, doubled cilantro, used chicken broth instead of water.  Soo good!  I did what someone else suggested and added lime slices while it simmered and then took them out.  Next time I wouldn't do this because I think it gave it a little bit of a bitter taste.  I will also add mushrooms next time like the kind I got at the restaurant.

Stinking good!  New comfort food.  I didn't have fresh ginger on hand so I used ground ginger and didn't miss it.  We served this over white rice and wished we had leftovers for seconds.

Yummy, but next time I'll skip the cilantro and add mushrooms instead. I could see myself eating this for dessert! Substitutions: chicken broth for water, nix the turmeric, add equal sugar with fish sauce.

This is the best soup I've ever tasted. The kids were scared of coconut milk, and wouldn't taste it, but it was so good. I will definately make it again.

I really liked this recipe over-all. I made some changes that I would advise against though.  I pretty much squeezed the juice from three limes into the pot and that was too much!!  Also, it seemed a little thin to me and I think that's because I used low-fat coconut milk.  If I would have followed the recipe better I think it would have been much better.

A good substitute when you just can't get out to a Thai restaurant for the real thing.  Be sure to add mushrooms.  Works fine without lemongrass and substituting lemon for lime juice.  Add a touch of sugar, too.

I don't know how "authentic" this recipe is, but it sure was terrific!  It cooked up so fast and has a taste like in a restaurant.  I used lite coconut milk.  I didn't have fish sauce and couldn't locate my dashi, so I used soy sauce like another cook suggested.  Yum!

Just excellent.  I had about 1.5lb chicken breast that I cooked with some lime/garlic seasoning and then chopped very small.  I used the lemon zester to grate a large hunk of fresh ginger into the pot.  It needed a few cloves of crushed garlic, quite a moderate amount of cayanne, and I didn't have mushrooms so I diced up a few stalks of celery and sauteed in the same pot I cooked the chicken in, until they were soft.  It needed noodles, I used rice sticks but they had a funky texture. Today Guido is taking care of me (I just broke a toe) and he boiled up some egg noodles.  It's really good.  Oh, I thin sliced 1 jalapeno, in that went, and I used chicken stock and some extra chicken stock base.  It's missing lemon grass but who cares, it's VERY good.

My husband and I love Thai food and have had this soup at several great Thai restaurants in Atlanta.  As always, before using a recipe, I read reviews.  Based on many reviews, I doubled the lime juice and added sugar.  I also increased the cayenne a bit.  My husband and I BOTH loved this soup.  It was simple (other than having to run to the grocery to get "fish sauce") and quick.  Highly recommended.  We will definitely add this one to our "delish" box.

Delicious, but I changed things up a bit. Added straw mushrooms and chopped baby corn, 1TBSP of my own curry powder instead of tumeric, and chile paste instead of the cayenne. 

Turned out delicious. Definately worth the (minimal) investment of time.

This receipe is so close to the real thing. I added mushrooms, 1 cup extra water, cilantro(just a few sprigs for garnish,and cooked the chicken in the broth to add more favor. I wouldn't add sugar, it is sweet enough as is. Awesome and quichQ

We absolutely love this soup!  The only changes that I have made is to substitute 2 T. soy sauce for 2 T. of the fish sauce.  I also cut back on the cayenne and tumeric.  I added halved cherry tomatoes and sliced mushrooms (this is how they serve it at a local Thai restaurant)  We frequently have dinner with friends born and raised in different parts of Asia and we all contribute foods from our country- this is a great addition to represent Thailand!

Turmeric made it a bright yellow which I wasn't expecting but it tasted pretty good. However, if there was lemongrass and galangal (curry paste) in it, it would have been five-star-perfect and out of this world. NEEDED lemongrass.
*I also used peanut oil & 1 lb. chicken pieces but don't think that was a big difference at all*
Stir-fried pre-packaged cole slaw (shredded red/green cabbage and carrots) in peanut oil with ground ginger, soy sauce and cooked rice and put that in soup to make it a little heartier.

Wow... an interesting blend of flavours.  If you are not a thai food lover make sure you serve this only as a side dish.  It is very potent and has interesting after taste but I could never eat a hearty bowl of this like I could with homeade chicken noodle soup!

This is missing lemongrass. I found it bland, even though I added more ginger and cayenne. I had to put a few TB of green curry paste into it before I liked it; but by then it was a completely different dish.

I made this soup exactly as described, I get cravings for it.... 

Loved this one.

Until I make it exactly like the recipe - I don't substitute, try it with shrimp sometime instead of chicken.  I like that version too.

I added lemongrass to a chicken stock and Ginger then boiled them all together for about 5 minutes, then drained them all
then added the coconut milk and and stock to the stir fried chicken and continued as the recipe said.
The coconut milk crumbled but I'll try not to bring the milk to a boil next time.

TIP :: If you don't have coconut milk you can use unsweetened coconut flakes
¾ cup hot water + ¼ cup unsweetened coconut flakes
I did so then drained it, it tastes good for a quick substitute.

This is a great , easy recipe. Lemon grass is not always available ,so I use lemon zest. This adds to a more lemony flavor and is pretty. Add lime and coconut milk at the end with low heat. Do not boil with coconut milk. Use chicken broth instead of water. Makes for a more rich chicken flavor. In the last 10 minutes I add carrot straws just to make this soup pretty. When I serve for quest, I float one shrimp, one very thin slice of lime and green onion in each bowl. I also serve extra chopped cilantro on the side. Guest always love this soup. It looks like you have gone to a lot of trouble just for them. I don't use turmeric.

This is excellent!! The only change I made was that I used soy sauce instead of fish sauce for dietary reasons. I wish it was a little spicier, so I would add more cayenne pepper next time, or maybe some red pepper flakes.

Despite being a mock version of Tom Ka Gai, it was really good, and the taste very similar to that of the dish in thai restaurants.  I added chopped mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and chopped tomatoes to mine to give it a bit more of a robust texture.

As a previous commenter said, at first this was gross. It really needed some lemongras and sugar and then it was awesome. I added almost 1/4 cup of sugar, but it will probably depend on the type of coconut milk you use. Just add to taste.

If you have a favorite Thai Restaurant, you'll try to duplicate their dishes.  This comes close.  I used a can of chicken broth  for some of the water, 1 can of creme of coconut, 1 tbs. TomKaGai concentrate and 1 tsp. Thai chili paste.....no cayenne pepper needed with this, nor the ginger root as it's contained in the other two ingredients.  You'll need to find a good Oriental market for some of these speciality ingredients.    A smidgen of sugar is a good addition:  1/2 tsp. will suffice That fish sauce is just an imperative!  Toooooooo yummy!

Not quite the Tom Ka Gai I was expecting but delicious none the less. Poured the soup over white rice and dotted with Sriracha.  Great rainy day soup!

I don't know where I went wrong.  I followed the suggestion from one of the reviewers regarding the added rings of lime.  Then I added a 3 stems of lemongrass.  (perhaps the lemongrass was too old, is that possible)  Other than that I followed the recipe as directed.  My soup started off on the money.  It tasted so good.  Then after the 15 minutes of simmer time it went from wonderful to YUCK....very bitter.  So bitter in fact that it's inedible. I don't know what I may have done wrong. The recipe seems to be a good one.

I took the advice of a reader and used some chicken broth. I also added mushrooms since I've had it that way in a resturant, it was amazing.

Yum!  It's been 11 years since I ate Tom Ka Gai at Sailor's Thai in Sydney, Australia.  To the best of my memory this is an excellent knock off.   I know that they used Kaffir lime leaves and lemon grass- but this tasted so similar.  I did add some (2 Tablespoons) of the fresh lemongrass herb blend by Gourmet Garden.  I'll be making this again - it is especially quick to put together too!

Never tried this soup at a Thai restaurant - in fact I know nothing about Thai food - but this was a great soup, did some modifications though.  I only had one can of coconut cream, and I only used 3 cups of water which was plenty.  I added a tablespoon of lime juice, omitted the turmeric, and put big chunks of ginger that I took out before serving.  I had no green onion and replaced the fresh cilantro with dried cilantro; also added about two or three teaspoons of white sugar.  It was a rather yummy soup, all in all!  At first my family thought it smelled and tasted strange, but after a few sips they all liked it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I had a craving for Tom Ka Gai, which was strange considering I don't care for it too much. Anyway, I made this as directed but added sugar snap peas to give it some color and crunch. If I had mushrooms I would have added those as well, as others suggested. I also made basmati rice to go with it. Only problem with this recipe is that I only wanted one bowl of it, and didn't know what to do with the rest! I ate it though! :) It came out just like the soup at my favorite Thai restaurant! :D

Tasty and easy to make but not enough coconut flavor for me.  I will try this recipe again but try using cream of coconut as recommended by other reviewers.

This was really good. The second time I made it I did not have limes at hand so I used the sweetened lime juice (the type you get for Margaritas) and it was so much better than the first time. I agree with the previous reviewers that sugar adds flavor to it. I also added mushrooms and a red bell pepper the second time around for more texture. We had it with homemade warm naan and it was so good, especially in such freezing weather!!!

This is a favourite staple now in our house.  The kids like it too.  I also tested using light coconut milk, like another reviewer and didn't notice the difference in taste.  My secret ingredient is a little dash of brown sugar to soften the sour of the lime. If you do this the flavors will come out and the dish won't taste one dimesional. I also add a few red pepper flakes and let my husband add more at the table so that it's not too hot for the kids. I may try a little bit of chile garlic paste next time. I also like to cut my chicken while it's partially frozen, so that I can cut it thin like they do in the Thai restaurants.  This is an awesome and EASY recipe that comes really close to the original! If you like Thai flavors you will not be disappointed.

MY husband loved this soup.Although I put in some chicken broth and put less of the water. I also put a tablespoon of ground ginger instead of the minced. But the flavor came out very good. Thumbs up if you like spicy soup.

Made this recipe without the fish sauce, green onions and turmeric.  I was skeptical, because it didn't call for lemon grass, which is traditionally called for and because I lacked the above mentioned ingredients, but boy was it yummy.  This is better than I've had at restaurants.  A definite keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!

Deliciousness is all I can say.  For those of you who aren't into ethnic food, you probably won't like the taste of this soup.  But for fans of Thai food, this is rivals my favorite restaurant and it's super easy.  I added lemongrass because I found it at my local grocery store, plus udon noodles and mushrooms to make it more substantial.  I LOVE it.  I'll definitely make this again.  Also, don't be afraid of the fish sauce.  It doens't taste like it smells.  My husband was afraid to try the soup because of that smell, but once I convinced him he loved it too.

Awesome! So easy to make and tastes great. I followed the recipe exactly but my husband and I like it spicy so I added a couple slices of fresh jalapeno. I served it with rice as a side dish and that made it even better.

This was gorgeous!  I added 2 1/2 x the lime juice and extra fish sauce. I also added baby spinach and julienne slice of red pepper (made it more interesting to look at.) Huge hit with my husband.

I made this for my sister who has never experienced Thai food. She loved it! I also subsituted 2 T of soy sauce for the fish sauce and I added Mushrooms. I didn't add the turmeric either. Next time I may add some sugar as others have suggested. Thanks for the great recipe!

So yummy.  Made this tonight and was only sad at how fattening it must be.  Added 1 lb shrimp, mushrooms, water chestnuts and used lemon grass powder instead of real lemon grass.  Seemed to work fine.  Also added about 1 tsp of red curry paste and used japanese Dashi instead of fish sauce. (Dashi is a powdered fish stock.) Will definitely make this again!

This was not at all what I expected.  The tumeric gave it an unusual color.  I also should have used lite coconut milk.  The cayenne did not seem like the right pepper flavor, and finally, the lime juice is no substitute for the kefir lime leaves.

This tasted just like the soup we've had at a local restaurant.  We loved it!  I used soy sauce instead of fish sauce and we added more cayenne to make it spicier.

this soup is very easy to make and absolutely delicious. I will be making it again but next time I will add a little less fish sauce as it was quite salty and left us thirsty for the rest of the day.

Use chicken broth instead of water for more flavor.  Also increased the chicken slightly.

I have always loved this soup and thought it was too difficult to make. This recipe is so easy. I did add mushrooms and vermicelli to make it more filling for a main course. it was awesome!!! Oh yes, I did add lemon grass, approx. 1 tsp.  My boyfriend who doesn't really like Thai food, loved it. will make again.

I skipped the turmeric, used chicken broth instead of water and added some sugar and it was perfect. I also make the chicken in advance so I could boil it in the soup for about 15 minutes, it was very good.

The original recipe tasted a bit bland so I added more spices like cumin, coriander, curry powder, chili powder, etc. I also toasted the ginger and garlic with cumin and mustard seeds and a bay leaf before adding in the liquid. I followed the direction on how much lime juice to add and the final product was waaaaay too sour. I'd recommend adding a little at a time and stop when it's the correct amount of sourness for you. This soup is also great if you add in some rice noodles.

I usually wont rate a recipe if I have heavily modified it, but this is such a good starter and the reviews were really helpful, and the soup turned out great so I though I would share what I did.  I added chicken better than boullion to water, added thinly sliced mushrooms and green onions, used shrimp instead of chicken, added sugar and added dried Kaffir lime leaves, omitted tumeric.  I used lots of cilantro as I really like it.
 I used fresh lime slicesinstead of lime juice (squeezed them into soup then floated them in it for a bit to add flavor when off heat, then removed).

This ended up as good as any I have had out at restaurants and was made with everything on hand. :-) . Obviously we all would like to make authentic with lemongrass, etc. but I say it is a win when you can make something that tastes great without specialty ingredients.  Enjoy!

Very tasty!  I added brown sugar, lemongrass, Thai basal  and substituted chicken stock for the water.  Because i crushed the lemongrass to add to the stock (but not serve), I left it simmering for about twice the time in the recipe.

I made this exactly as written and it was DELICIOUS!  I don’t care if it is authentic or not, it is bursting with flavor. Next time I will slice the chicken very thin and add raw to the simmering broth. I will also stir in the lime juice at the end with the cilantro and onions.

Made with all listed ingredients & LOVED IT! However, I did take recommendations of others & improvised some of my own. 1T of coconut sugar, doubled the cilantro, added 2 cloves of garlic & sauteed about 1 T of madras curry powder in oil before adding other ingredients, including 1 thinly sliced zucchini. THIS WAS AMAZING!!!! I crave this flavor & HAD to attempt my own, this is as close as it can get. Will certainly get lemongrass & lime kaffir leaves for next attempt to give this the authentic flavor at my fave Thai cafe.

I made it the was the recipe was written. It's a good soup with much easier to find ingredients than the traditional ones. It lacks the depth or complexity of flavors from the traditional ingredients- that's why I gave it 4 stars. It's good for what it is :). 
I don't recommend putting it over cauliflower rice. That does add veggies, which is great, but dulls the flavor too much.

This isn’t the traditional recipe using galangal, lemongrass and lime kefir leaves. It came out tasting pretty good thought. I read through the reviews before starting the recipe. I cooked the coconut mixture on low and I added the lime juice at the end. I also added 2 teaspoons of sugar. Thanks for the recipe:)

I followed the recipe. This soup is so delicious that it has become a staple. Oh my my. 

Be aware that this is a combination of strong flavors. Don't add salt until the very end if you decide that is needed. Don't be afraid of the lemon, it blends very well with the ginger and the coconut smooths it out.

Love this recipe! Quick and easy, and the whole family likes it. I serve it with some cooked rice in the bowl, and lime wedges on the side.

This is terrific!  I followed the advice of others and used low sodium chicken  broth in place of water, doubled the cilantro and lime, and added mushrooms.  I was also able to find lemon grass in a tube with the produce of my grocery store.  I added a tablespoon of that as well.  I must admit, it was a little heavy on the citrus, but that was my fault.  I will definitely make this again, but next time I will use the recipe amount of lime juice along with the lemon grass.  I may even switch out the chicken for shrimp.  Thank you for this recipe!

The recipe is good, however I used Chicken broth instead of water and added mushrooms.  It's a quick and easy recipe.

Great and tasty, I added thinly sliced carrots, green beans, snap peas and cauliflower to make it more hearty.  I also graded a teaspoon of turmeric, and same of fresh ground pepper, for medicinal purposes.  no sugar, but wish I had a tad...

Excellent! Used just a pinch of the cayenne and added 1 tbsp red curry paste. Substituted water for chicken broth. Making this a second time with shiitake mushrooms. Served over rice cooked with a few tablespoons cilantro, half chicken broth and half coconut milk. Yum!

I agree with other reviewers. Most of us cannot find the lime leaves and other native Thai ingredients needed to make authentically. But, this is a great substitute. I didn't have scallions, but sautéed a small amount of red onion instead and it gave it good flavor. I could do with or without the turmeric, like others, I was surprised at the off looking appearance of the soup, but the turmeric wasn't a distraction from the flavors either, so it's a personal choice. I used some chicken thighs and legs and poached the pieces, poured the water through a colander and used that plus a little water. I only needed one can of coconut milk and it tasted great, but by all means add more if needed. Thank you for a great faux Thai coconut soup recipe.

This was easy and delicious! I added mixed wild rice, shiitake mushrooms, sweet potato chunks and substituted basil for cilantro. Add chopped frozen basil to the broth and garnished with fresh cut basil and scallion/green onion. I also added fresh lemongrass too.

I initially made this exactly as the recipe said.  It tasted really fishy and was bright yellow from the turmeric.   I had to add 2 more can of coconut milk and 2 more cups of water to tone it down.  I then added lime and cayenne to taste.  I think that it's better to start with 1/2 of the recommended spices and go up from there to your preference.   a lot of reviewers said that they cut the turmeric.   I left it in for the health benefits and the taste was good.  I also cut out the chicken and added frozen stir fry veggies.  It turned out great.

Very tasty and close to the authentic flavor considering how easy it is. I took reviewer's tips to cut out the turmeric, substitute chicken brother for the water, and add sugar. I added about 2 tablespoons of white sugar and could have added more.

2-26-2016  ~This had mixed reviews in our house, a matter of who disliked it more. Hubs didn't eat his at all, and I suffered through mine. The fact that I used just a third of the ginger called for was a good call as the full amount would have been waaaay too much, but then it really didn't matter one way or the other as I  guess we're just not fans of fish sauce.   I had difficulty even getting past the smell of it.

I made this in the midst of a snow storm knowing full well I didn't have cilantro and  realizing midway through the prep that I was out of onions.  I added bamboo shoots and peas to make up for the ingredients I was lacking. It turned out very well. Can't wait to make it again with all the ingredients.

This is a family favorite.  We serve it over rice.  I appreciate that this version leaves out those harder-to-find ingredients.  -P.S. I only use one can of coconut milk and always use chicken broth instead of water.

It's a good soup, but not really Tom Ka Gai - at least not like any that I've had in a restaurant before.  I added a few stalks of lemongrass, and it was a very healthy and easy lunch to make.

Wow, this was VERY good! I was hesitant about making it just seeing the ingredients, but after reading all the rave reviews, I thought I'd give it a shot. I used chicken broth instead of water, like other reviewers did, and also added a lemongrass stalk. I added about 2 tablespoons of sugar, too. I also threw in a bunch of quartered mushrooms, and some black pepper. Tastes just as good as the soup I order from the Thai restaurant down the street that I'm so addicted to. YUM! Has just the right amount of heat, too, which is always good in this household. :)

This was easy to prepare with ingredients on hand.  I did use the trick another reviewer mentioned to add some sugar with the fish sauce.  I will try to add lemon grass next time but I usually don't have on hand.

Fantastic! Didn't use chicken or tumeric and added mushrooms and splenda.  So fast and good... UPDATE: oh yeah, forgot the green onions, but didn't miss them and in place of ginger I used a ginger blend that I found in the produce section - pretty sure it's a mixture of fresh chopped ginger and sugar.

This recipe is good, but I am not a big soup fan. I noticed this is almost exactly the same as the "yellow curry" served in westernized Thai restaurants. So I omit the water and serve with rice. Excellent. I have used powered lime and ginger instead of fresh and it's still good. Altering the amount of lime really changes the flavour, so you can play with it depending on what you feel like. I also add uncooked onions in so they cook with the sauce and it's wonderful.

This was an excellent and quick dish, save a few minor changes... (1) definately use chicken broth instead of water (2) forget about the fish sauce and tumeric. I also added a few think slices of ginger as well as the minced pieces giving more texture, doubled the lime juice and include the pulp, if you can this will nicely balanced the flavor of the coconut

For my own reference later, I made the following changes.  I added about 2 TBSP of peanut butter, 1/4 c. shredded coconut, 1 small yellow onion, 1 bag California blend veggies, 3/4 c. frozen corn, 1/2 bag fancy green beans, 1 restaurant pack of soy sauce (in place of fish sauce), 2 small spoonfuls of curry paste (in place of cayenne), 1 carton of chicken stock (in place of the water), and juice from 3 small limes.

AMAZING! my wife and I were a little afraid to try to make this dish especially since we had company coming over. We followed Dungbeetle's comments and it turned out great! Our guests love it and so did we! We will definitely be making this over and over again!

Just like the restaurants! You can also add a little mushrooms, or carrots to bulk up the soup a little but it's great the way it is! I also like to add in a can of diced tomatoes and a TBSP of curry sometimes. Very easy to prepare and DELICIOUS!

I added things like the other cooks. Added 2 tsp sugar, did half lemon half lime juice, used more cilantro and added during cooking, changed water for chicken broth. One change I will make next time is to reduce the fish sauce by 1 tbs. It was really salty and a little too pungent, although still delicious. This is as good a soup as you'd get in any restaurant.

This was phenomenal, but I had to make some changes based on what I have available. I used leftover roasted chicken & doubled it (so no oil); I used homemade chicken stock for the water & I doubled that too; used 1 tbsp. ground ginger; 4 tbsp oyster sauce; doubled the cayenne; omitted the turmeric; added garlic powder, dried cilantro, a heaping tsp of dried lemongrass, & 4 tbsp. cream of coconut. I cooked my green onion in the soup & think I might use the entire sheaf next time. I kept the coconut milk & lime juice quantities the same (my husband added more red pepper & more lime juice at the table). I will definitely make this again, and I will properly double the recipe when I do. (Was afraid, this time, that we just wouldn't like it, but we SO did.) I can't speak to this recipe's authenticity as we'd never had a Tom Ka Gai that we liked, so I just kept adding & subtracting things until I reached a flavor that *I* liked.  Thank you SO much, this was so good :)

I thought this was a great soup whether actual Tom Ka Gai or a mock version of it, this is good soup. I changed it some though due to lack of the proper ingredients and a desire to have more to it. I used powered ginger and lemon juice. I didn't use turmeric, green onions, or cilantro. I did however add bay leaves, a spoonful of sugar, red peppers, and celery. Really good!

Yum!  This recipe is a keeper.  I used light coconut milk and substituted tofu and shiitake mushrooms for the chicken.  It was quick to make and delicious! Thanks.

Delicious and easy.   I used canned chicken, to cut prep time, and a can of straw mushrooms for a fast filling soup. I used chicken broth instead of the water, doubled the lime juice and the cilantro and left out the tumeric and onion. 15 minutes cook time with almost no prep.  My family said it was better than the coconut soup we get at the Thai restaurant.

I made quite a few revisions according to other reviews and a previous recipe I had: added shiitake mushrooms, carrot, 2 Tbspn sugar, 2 Tbspn soy sauce, slices of garlic, lemongrass, left out the tumeric, used chicken broth in place of water and only 1 can lite coconut milk. This recipe is a great starting point! Easy and exoticly delicious!!

Excellent!  At the very least...this recipe provides a WONDERFUL jumping off point - then tweak as needed.  I did scale recipe up to 8 servings and that made quite a bit.  Delish!  Will make again.

I couldn't give this 5 stars because it says 1/4 Tbsp. cayenne pepper. I did 1/4 tsp. thinking that must be what they meant, and personally that was still a little too spicy for my mild tastes. I also could not find fish sauce at my little local supermarket so did without it as well as the tumeric. It still tasted good to me and hit the spot for what I'd been craving after having an excellent version of this soup at a little Thai place in Boise, ID. In their soup they had little button mushrooms so I added about 1/2 c. of sliced white mushrooms I had on hand and that was a good addition. Also, I forgot to buy more limes, and depending on size you'll need 2-3 and I only had 1, so I also added fresh lemon juice to equal 1/4 c. I love lime so next time will make sure I have enough and will also search for the fish sauce before I make it again. I've never bought coconut milk before and I had one can of a more expensive brand (A Taste of Thai) and one can of a cheap brand. The more expensive one was super thick and had a lot more fat in it than the cheaper one which seemed very watery but still seemed to taste ok. The quality of your soup will depend greatly on the quality of your ingredients! I also used 1 can chicken broth instead of water. So it was good and next time I'll be sure to do it exactly and see how much different it is.

This recipe was wonderful, quick, and easy!  Like other reviewers, I added more chicken and mushrooms.  I love the tumerec and fish sauce in it.  I also added sliced white onion into the chicken and then into the broth.  I also substituted a bunch of fresh basil for the cilantro.

Was very good, almost like what I get at the restaurant! I took other's suggestions and deleted the turmeric, and added chicken broth instead of the water. I also added plenty of sliced mushrooms, a teaspoon of thai chili paste, lime zest and some fresh lemon grass. Without the extras i think it would have been a bit bland for my taste.

I made this to see how it compared to "Adrienne's Tom Ka Gai" also from this site.  It was very similar, and the lime juice is essential to this recipe!  I liked it, but I think I prefer the other recipe which seems to be more flavorful and includes bok choy for more veggie power.

I'm not sure how I feel about this recipe.  I didn't like it initially, but it kind of grew on me half way through the bowl.  I did add sugar like some other reviewers suggested, as well as lemongrass.  My husband liked it.  He thought it tasted like those frito-lay hint of lime tortilla chips.  I don't know if I'll make it again.  It probably has nothing to do with the recipe though.  I've never had the soup before in a Thai restaurant, either.

This tastes exactly like the soup we loved at our favorite Thai restaurant. This soup is going into my regular meal rotation.  We sent a bowl to our neighbor, and he called back 15 mintues later proclaiming it was the best chicken soup he had ever tasted. If you like Thai food, you should try this soup!

This is a good base for Tom Ka Gai (or a tofu version).  The addition of salt and lemon grass, with a long simmer time, make this recipe very yummy.

Would recommend adding sugar to taste to balance out the saltiness that other reviewers mention.  I believe the Thai people add sugar to their food like we add salt/pepper to ours.  At least that's how it is at my local Thai restaurant.  I added rice, mushrooms, and red cabbage for extra vitamins and color.

My husband thinks I should give is 4 1/2 stars and I thought closer to 4.  That being said, I made a few changes.  We put shrimp, mushrooms and spinach in the soup instead of chicken and I didn't add the tumeric but used soy sauce and some sugar on the advice of other reviews.  Also added fresh lime juice and a little lemon juice.  I topped with scallions but won't do that next time.  Thanks for a quick and easy - hubby wants it in the regular rotation!

This was very good! MY friends loved it. It wasn't exactly the same as what I'd had in a restaurant, but it was still quite good. I used the soy sauce and lemongrass as others suggested over the fish sauce and whatnot. It was still quite good - I recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good, hearty soup with some spice!

This soup was tasty, and has a distinctive flavor because of the lime juice.  My boyfriend really loved it.

This recipe made my stomach feel odd.  Too much lime juice makes it really difficult to eat, even the next day the flavours dont mellow out much. A waste of chicken really.

YUM! This was very delicious but I did't have any lime juice on hand, so I used 1 1/2 TBS of lemon juice. It was just as good! I also added Kafir lime leaves (shredded) and lemon grass and left out the tumeric. My hubby loved it and it was so easy to make!

I personally thought this was great. Tastes a lot like what I get at a local Thai place. My daughter thought it was excellent until she noticed I put "fish sauce" in it. Since she doesnt like fish (claims it anyway) she suddenly didnt like it either. My wife didnt like it but that shouldnt surprise me. I didnt even waste my time asking my son to try it (never do). I give it a 4 but due to the above problems, I doubt I make it again. Good recipe though. Easy too.

Super good and easy too.  I used red curry paste instead of cayenne pepper for a hotter thai flavor.

5 stars says it all.  As good as any I've had at many Thai restaurants.  I added a little curry.

Do not cut back on the coconut milk and don't use lite coconut milk.  I add a cube of chicken bouillon and it's perfect.

Very good recipe! Totally authentic! I doubled the Tumeric and added broccoli & shredded carrot. I used Veat fake chicken as I do not consume things which had faces or families and it tasted great! I'll use tofu next time however!

Yum, very good. I added some more vegetables (sprouts, water chestnuts) for crunchiness and everyone was very happy with this. I've made it twice, and the second time my boyfriend ate so much he had to lie around complaining... this stuff is utterly impossible to leave alone until it's gone.

I did not like this recipe.  You could barely taste the coconut flavor.  The whole concoction tasted like spicey water.  Lacking overall.

Adding vegetables makes it more of a full meal.
