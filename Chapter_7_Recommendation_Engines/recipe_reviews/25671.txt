This recipe really wasn't all that good. It took WAY longer than an hour to cook, so we didn't have dinner until almost 9 PM. The smell was a bit overpowering. I think there was just too much going on with this stew. Not a meal I would repeat.

Made by adding a large can of diced tomatoes & no Manhattan Clam chowder.  I also added red pepper flakes for some zip and a cup of frozen peas for color.   I served it over a bed of rice.  It was a winner & perfect for a January night!  Easy & it cooked itself.

Delicious and easy - stick to the recipe, ensure you keep the pot covered and wait for an hour - this is done and yummy!
