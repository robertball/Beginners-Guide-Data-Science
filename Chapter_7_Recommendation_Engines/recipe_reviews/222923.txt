I had never made fried green tomatoes before and this looked like something I could enjoy. The recipe is easy enough to follow, it came out the way it's supposed to.  However, I ran into a problem with taste :/  My family and I felt this was very salty and the Ranch and salt made the tomatoes taste very acidic. I am not sure if it's the Ranch seasoning or the additional salt that did it, but if you choose this recipe, I think the additional sea salt is best left out. Otherwise, it's easy, they become a nice golden color and have very good texture. I am sorry that we didn't enjoy it.
