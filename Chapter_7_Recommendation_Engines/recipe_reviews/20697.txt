This ended up being a fantastic recipe - once I gave up on the idea of trying to make it on a pizza pan! I laid out the crescent roll pieces on a pizza pan and could tell pretty quickly it wasn't going to be easy to make a circle that covered the pan. So I took the suggestion of using a 9x13 and coaxed the pieces into fitting with a little help from my rolling pin. I also took the suggestion of baking the crescent roll crust for a few minutes (6min?) before adding the toppings - VERY helpful!

Other changes I made included using Morningstar Griller crumbles instead of sausage to make it vegetarian and using a Mexican 3 cheese blend to add a little kick. I didn't brown the crumbles because they seem to cook just fine even when added frozen, but I did the brown the hash browns, just for good measure.

I still baked it for 25 min even though I had pre-baked the crust a little, and let it sit for a few minutes before serving. It was EXCELLENT!!

My son and I just threw one of these yummy pizzas together.  We used a 16 inch pizza pan and two packages of Crescent rolls for the crust.  I added 2 oz. of canned diced Jalapenos, a four ounce can of diced green chilies, (Ortega is good.) Eight ounces of sliced fresh mushrooms, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and two cups of shredded pepper-jack cheese, all added to an increased 7 egg and milk mixture. Also added an extra 1/2 lb. of ground pork sausage.  This was beyond excellant.  This one's a keeper, for sure.  Thanks Tammy.

Tasted good, but I used a pizza stone from Pampered Chef, and the egg ran everywhere and dried up at the bottom of my oven.  I recommend a pizza pan with sides for this.

This was SO GOOD! Out of 5 stars, I'd say it's about a 10!
I used a quiche pan to avoid spills. One can of (reduced fat) crescent rolls completely covered the bottom and up the sides. (Don't forget to grease the pan first!) I pre-cooked the crust for 5 minutes, but won't next time - it was a bit over cooked in the end. To lighten it up a little, I used low fat sausage and egg substitute, and no one knew the difference. I also lightly pre-cooked the hash browns and added some roasted red peppers -they were the perfect compliment! I will definitely be making this again, and again, and again! (My picky eater teenage son even went back for thirds! -but he did pick out the roasted peppers :) Thanks for a Terriffic recipe!!!  mmmmmmmmm

My son likes breakfast after his Wednesday night riding lessons, but I was tired of the same ole thing.  This was a big hit, everyone liked it.  I did make some changes.  Used pizza dough a slightly precooked it in a 9x13.  Used cubed hash browns and cooked half way adding garlic powder salt and pepper.  Added minced onion to the sausage, added two more eggs a little milk.  Finally, used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 mozzarella.  Served with hot sauce.  Easily served my family of 6.

This is a great recipe!  Everyone loved it.  I cooked the sausage the night before so I the morning I just toss it together in a matter of minutes.
Just make sure your pan has an edge.  Mine did not and I had a mess.

The crescent roll crust makes this pizza. I have made this pizza several times, including entertaining for a brunch. What a hit! I always omit the hash browns and parmesan and add some crumbled cooked bacon and it is wonderful. I make homemade sausage gravy for the "pizza sauce" as another review suggested. Also, pre-baking the crust for 5-7 minutes helps the crust to get done and not be gooey once the toppings have been added. For some cooks who commented the eggs ran everywhere: Scramble the eggs first in a skillet and then add them to the pizza. You'll be a lot more pleased with this!

Awesome, not to mention absolutely adorable!  The kids really got a kick out of this.  My daughter pretty much made this on her own.  I don't have a pizza pan (just a stone), so I used my corningware quiche pan & it worked out great!  We also subbed bacon for the sausage, because that's what the kids prefer.  Good recipe Tammy, thanks!

this was a disaster.  Egg oozed all over my oven. The potatoes were soggy.  The cheese ended up greasy.  DON'T make this as directed!

I fixed this for my crew at the fire department.  It was a huge hit.  Of course I adjusted to taste by cooking diced onions and mushrooms with the sausage.  I also doubled the ingredients and cooked on a cookie sheet.  When the firefighters want the recipe you have a keeper.

I made this for a get together with some friends. Everyone thought it was fantastic! I made a few modifications. I used 2 cans of crescent rolls to cover a 15 inch pizza pan using the same method of separating the triangles. I did overlap the points in the center, 1/2 inch approximate. I placed a piece of parchment paper to make the pizza slide right off the pan. I had enough dough to roll the edges slightly to make a pretty crust.

I also microwaved a 3 medium potatoes till tender and ran them under cold water just to cool them. I peeled and roughly chopped them placed them

This was overall a very kid friendly recipe. I did change a few things, since the recipe seem a bit bland. I made a white flour gravy with garlic. I then chopped up half of a green bell pepper, half a red bell pepper, and a few mushrooms. And add a cup more of cheese (we used sharp cheddar to add a bit of tangy). Overall everybody loved it, (potato with crescent, but nobody seem to have issues). I layered the pizza first with the white gravy, then the sausage, a little cheese, the potatos, and then the egg mixure (I only used three eggs and about 1/8 of a cup of milk), then the peppers and mushrooms, then more cheese.... We ate the leftovers the next day it seem to be even better

This would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the baking pan.  I wish I would have read other reviews first...I tried pouring my eggs and it ran all over the pan.  It made a huge mess, I wish I would have put this in a 9x13 dish.  Realize this is a rectangle pizza and don't try making the crescents into a circle like I did.  This baked for 28 mins.  I will try prebaking the dough next time, though it baked up perfectly.  I'm not quite sure this would feed 8 hungry people.  I'd say this is for 4-6 people.  This is a keeper!!!

I've made this for years - always in a 9 x 13 pan.  It is a must for our 6 am Indy 500 party.  We serve some fruit, coffee and juice and it keeps us full while we drive to the race track and wait for the start of the biggest spectacle in racing!

I made this breakfast pizza for Christmas day breakfast and what a hit it was--so easy and so delicous. I browned the sausage the day before and all I had to do was put it together Christmas morning. It is a great alternative to breakfast casseroles and the toppings really could be endless!!!

i made a mess of the dish because i didn't have a pizza pan, just a cookie sheet (with a lip), so when i poured the eggs on, a lot of them just spilled out -- what i couldn't get back onto the "pizza" just cooked or burned around the sides. despite that, this tasted just like a quiche, but with a softer crust.

This was awesome! I used Pillusbury pizza crust, used 7 eggs, 6 chopped sausage patties, 2 cups colby-jack cheese, and 1 and a half cups shredded hash browns that I microved first for 2 minutes. My husband really loved it! Great recipe! Thanks!

Wonderful Recipe!  I usually recreate recipes to suit our tastes and preferences but this was wonderful just how it was written.  The only suggestion that I have is to add some crumbled bacon on top or in the mixture and make sure that you are using a pizza pan with a lip...Pizza Stones will not work (to my disappointment) or you can use a 9x13 casserole dish...both work well but we like the look on a round pizza dish better!

Very good recipe!  I made a few changes to use what I had on hand - instead of using crescent rolls for the crust I used a ball of pizza dough that I had thawed the night before.  I spread that into the bottom of a 13x9 pan and baked it for 7 minutes before adding the toppings.  I also didn't thaw the hashbrowns before spreading them on - just put them on frozen.  Then I sauteed diced ham (didn't have any sausage), onions and red bell pepper and put that on top of the potatos.  I topped it all with the scrambled egg mixture and shredded low fat cheddar and baked it for 27 minutes.  It turned out GREAT!  My fiance loved it and ate half the pan!  Will definitely be a keeper :)

I have served this breakfast pizza on Christmas morning for the past 26 years.  There is never any left.  I too use 2 pkgs. of Crescent rolls as in my experience 1 tube wasn't enough, and I too, don't use a pizza pan but a casserole dish.  It turns out perfect every year, and my family would be heart broken if I didn't serve this Christmas morning with a pitcher of Mimosa's.

Made this with homemade pizza crust from my bread machine. Thought it was very bland. Added hot sauce which made it much better.

This is the BEST breakfast recipe and I don't usually leave reviews. Used a pizza dough and spread country gravy lightly on the dough and then followed everything else to the T. WONDERFUL results.

This never fails to disappear when I make this for my family. I use extra sharp white cheddar and add a 1/2 c. of bacon, one chopped red pepper and a 1/2 c. of chopped mushrooms. Really great with homemade biscuits and an orange smoothie.

I didn't have a pizza pan so I used a 9x13 and it worked perfectly.  I'm sure it was even easier than a pizza pan since the rolls are already in a rectangular shape.

I made this with regular pizza dough and it was good, but kind of light on the egg and meat mixture. Next time I would double the topping part for one regular size pizza dough crust baked in a 9x13 pan. Overall, good solid recipe, just needs a little tweaking for our taste.

This turned out great.  My son loved it..said it was a keeper.  I do have to admit even though i was short on cheese (used shredded provolone) and forgot to mix the milk with the eggs, it stilled turned out well.  Very easy to do.  I had to use 2 cresent roll tubes though.  This one is hard to mess up.

We all really liked this!  I did find that one package of crescent rolls wasn't enough so I had to use 1½ packages.  I also used southwestern hash browns.  When I turned on the oven, I put a pizza stone in the oven to heat it up first and then put the pizza pan on top of it when the oven was ready.  This helped to brown the bottom.  To avoid spills, I didn't put the egg mixture on until the pizza pan was on the pizza stone in the oven.  Will put this recipe in my "keeper" file!  The possibilities are endless!

I made this dish for my Sunday School class.  It was a big hit.  I cooked the saugage the night before and just had to assemble it and pop it in the oven while I got dressed.  It presented well and tasted wonderful.

This was delicious!  We did add a bit or oregano, and will probably try adding diced onion next time.  I would recommned using a deep dish, as the egg bubbled up and ran over the edge when while baking.

I wouldn't try this recipe again unless I changed it a little.  The croissants as the base didn't taste too good.  The flavor of the pizza was good, it was just too cakey for me and my boyfriend. I could barely finish one slice. I would just recommend using something not as sweet as the crust instead of croissants.  Otherwise good recipe.

You need to cook the eggs and then lower cook time; the eggs should be cooked as you would scramble eggs, making sure no more liquid but keeping them very moist, then spread over cooked pizza shell.  One layer of cheese on top of crust, then cooked eggs, then another layer cheese, along with any toppings.  Keep toppings to a minimum if possible...very good doing it this way!  As far as cook time, the crust should be golden brown on bottom, the eggs will not overcook as long as heat not too high.  I know these directions are not the clearest, and this recipe is not the easiest as they say, but if you get it just right it is the most delicious breakfast pizza.

Always Awesome!
This recipe appeared in the 70s (?) in Better Homes & Gardens in 'things men like to cook.'  Been making this for YEARS; have served it to literally dozens of breakfast guests, and they have always been oh-d and ah-d!

Like most recipes, you may want to tweak according to your tastes (and oven).  Over yrs, I changed hash brown(to 3 c,thawed) & cheddar (2.5 c). I also add bacon (6 thick-cut cooked & finely chopped) and omit salt & milk.

I've also found that first baking crust for 7 mins @ 375 is good idea.  Then another 25 @ 375 w/all toppings except cheeses and then another 10 @350 w/ cheeses.  You definitely want to use a pizza pan with slight lip.

This was delicious! I did take the advice on using a 9x13 cassarole dish instead of a pizza pan, unless you're planning on using two containers of crescent rolls, one for the base and another for the rim to keep everything in. I also pre-baked the crust for 5 minutes before adding everything to it and replacing it in the oven and the crust came out crispy and delicious. I also added 4 slices of pre-cooked bacon on top, and cooked the whole thing for 28 minutes and it came out perfect! It was a huge hit.

First of all YUMM!! Tried this thismorning. We really liked it. I did bake my rolls for 5 min before putting toppings on, and i also as suggested cooked my hashbrowns. I did add some frozed onion and peppers that i keep in my freezer to the hashbrowns. I didn't have any sausage but i did have precooked bacon so i just used that. This will for sure be a regular dish in our household. Thank you.

Not a pizza, but a great casserole. I did cook crescent rolls for 4 minutes before layering ingredients on top. I also used Jimmy Dean pre-cooked sausage, but it turned out great!

I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  ages 2-62 loved it.  the only tweeks I made was prebake the crust 4 minutes and added a package of sausage gravy over the sausage (I think it would be dry without it).  I have made it twice in two weeks.

I had to use 1 can and a half of crescent rolls to cover the 12 inch pizza pan.  Otherwise I did everything according to the recipe.  Some of the egg mixture boiled over into the bottom of the oven.  The taste is fine if you're not into a spice bump, which my family isn't.  I would add a can of green chiles is you do like the extra kick.

This is the first time I made this but my grandmother used to make it for years. I actually make more of a casserole than a pizza because all I have is a pizza stone. Instead of buying crescent rolls I bought 1 pie crust(top and bottom) and just formed them to the pan. It made one 9x13 and one 9 inch round. I just added four more eggs and extra topping (I used sausage, bacon, and sauteed mushrooms and onions) and it came out great. I also slightly pre-cooked my crust like others suggested and it was great, not soggy at all! My family loved this christmas morning. Next time I'll cook the meat and dough the pans before I go to sleep so it doesn't take me long to make it.

AWESOME! Everyone enjoyed this on Xmas morning! I took a few tips from the reviews, using a 9x13 pan and adding 1/2 cup crumbled bacon. I will definitely make this again (and will probably hold out a bit of the sausage and add some green onion and mushrooms). This is a the perfect recipe for company!

yum!  I made it in a 9.5" pie plate because I was afraid it would make a mess in the oven.  Very glad that I did that.  It turned out more like a quiche than pizza, but it was still very good.  I also added a layer of diced green peppers with the sausage (I used Boca sausage).  I also pre-cooked the hash browns about halfway.  Letting it rest about 5 min after it comes out of the oven is a must.

Great recipe!  I took the suggestion of cooking the hasbrowns a bit before adding them to the pizza, and I bought unfrozen hasbrowns that I found by the eggs.  I also added churizo sausage with maple breakfast sausage to add some more flavor.  Great idea and one slice is soooo filling which is great I was afraid I wouldn't have enough!

This was a pretty good recipe, especially after a little tweaking.  The sausage wasn't fab in this, so the next time I used cubes of ham.  It was a little bland as is and a few chopped green onions, garlic, parsley and dry mustard (just a dash) helped.  Also, I mixed about a 1/4 cup of sour cream in with the eggs.

The parmesan became too hard on top, making it difficult to cut slices for my guests, so I used extra sharp cheddar the next time.  Also, since the recipe called for just one cup of thawed hashbrowns, I grated a couple of red potatoes myself and I really think it added to the flavor of the dish.

I made this recipe and substituted refrigerated pizza dough for the crust. It was very tasty and well received, so much so I'm making it again next week for another group.

This is great for a Sunday Brunch kind of thing.. I didnt have any sausage so I used leftover Fajita meat..The steak and peppers and onions was delicious in this..I also used a mixture of shredded cheddar and mozarella and served it with some fresh strawberries... Kiki (Brampton,ON,Canada)

I prepared two pizzas for our Thursday office breakfast.  Everyone raved!  When they asked me for the recipe, however, the secret was out.  My masterpiece did not take hours of slaving in the kitchen, but rather, only minutes of preparation thanks to the frozen potatoes and refrigerated crescent roll dough.  I substituted ham for the sausage for one pizza and created a vegetarian version for the other.  Both were devoured in short order.

I have made this for years.  I always use a 9X13 glass pan and it works wonderfully.  The parmesan cheese is the secret.  There are many other recipes that are similar, but do not call for parmesan cheese.  Just last month I made 5 for a youth group breakfast and they ate them all.

This recipe was good and easy. I made it in a casserole dish instead of a pizza pan. Next time I'll add some onions and green bell peppers...the recipe could use some veggies.

I doubled up on the recipe putting it upon a cookie sheet.  I also lightly painted ketchup over the dough(chili sauce or salsa would also work nicely.)  I had some leftover fried bell pepper and onions I'd layered in with the hash browns. I also had to add another 10 minutes to the cooking time.  Let it set for 5 mins. before cut & serving.

I didn't even eat it and I knew it was awful. Why?The rolls didn't even press together to form a circle. When I forced them to It was thin, I knew it would never hold up. The eggs slimed right off the pizza when I put the on!

I am a substitute teacher. Most of the schools I work at do monthly breakfast. Each grade takes a month. When I am in a long term position I always participate.  I make this every time. I make it in a disposable tin pan and cut it before I leave the house. I make 2 trays and never have any to bring home. It's always a huge hit. Also I microwave bacon and crumble it on top before I bake.

This has been a big hit in the guest and husband department. Just remember to use a pizza pan with a good size lip or the eggs will run all over your oven.  This dish is totally worth purchasing it's own pan. Lu Ann

Thanks for the awesome recipe !  I took the advise from other reviews....Used a 9x13" baking pan, precooked the crust 6 minutes and browned the hashbrowns first....other than that, followed the recipe exactly, but added sauteed peppers to half (for the grown ups) and it turned out FABULOUS !  A keeper for sure :)

Delicious as posted. Do put it in a pan with sides, egg has a tendency to run. Next time I will experiment with mushrooms, diced ham, onions, peppers. I think you can do whatever you like to this. I might also brown the hashbrowns to crisp them up a little for texture.

I made this using grands flakey biscuits (did not have crescent rolls) that I separated and stretched to the approximate thickness of the crescent roll and placed in a very lightly greased 9 x 13 pan.  I read several of the reviews all saying to precook the crust 4 - 6 minutes; so I did that.  Made the rest of the recipe as directed and had to cook 50 minutes for the eggs to be done.  The crust got crusty and took on that overdone taste.  I will stick to my other breakfast bake; which is very similar to this less the crust and a couple more eggs.

next time i will use 2 crescent rolls on a cookie sheet.  also, precooking the crust for a few minutes helped and i loved one reviewers suggestion to add creole seasoning!  perfect for my husband who is working the night shift and wakes up at 2:00 PM and wants breakfast!

This recipe was delicious! The problem, however is it is not healthy at all. Also, the eggs ran everywhere, making a huge mess on the stove. And even though the sausage was drained the grease ran everywhere in the oven. I think, even though it tastes great, using the crescent rolls as the crust is a bad idea. They are fattening and dont make a good crust (mostly because they don't hold the eggs in, even when pressed together and with the edges turned up). It would be easier to either use a rolled pizza crust or an aleady made pizza crust. I have seen breakfast pizza recipes with country gravy as the "sauce" & that sounds like a good idea too. Also, I have seen suggestions to bake the crescent roll crust first & even scramble the eggs first. Both of those would help with the messy issue. We will make it again because even my son loved it, & he doesn't eat anything!

Very good!!! I altered the recipe a little.  I used half sausage and half bacon.  Instead of salt and pepper, I used Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning.  I also sauteed onion and green bell pepper for approximately a minute before adding it to the top of the sausage and bacon layer.  I added a tad bit of the creole seasoning to the onion and pepper while it sauteed.  Fabulous!!! My picky children even loved it!!!

This is so good. I browned the sausage with chopped onion and then browned the hash browns. I seasoned each layer so that the dish was just right. I seasoned the hash browns with seasoning salt and red pepper flakes. I seasoned the eggs with seasoning salt, black pepper, and a Greek herb blend I got from an organic grower.   I did as the other reviewers suggested and placed the dough in a 9 x 13 dish. Pre-baked for 4 min. I added the Parmesan to the crust before layering with sausage/potato/eggs and cheese.   I made another version using turkey sausage links, sliced thin. And seasoned the eggs with salt, pepper, and an organic Italian herb blend.    All my guests loved this and kept going back for seconds.

Made this for Christmas Eve brunch. It was excellent. I used reduced fat sausage, reduced fat crescent rolls and 2% cheese. Added pre-cooked turkey bacon bites (which can be found in salad section near dressing and croutons) to sausage mixture. I browned hash browns in skillet, doubled the eggs, added garlic and 1-can of cream of mushroom. One more important note I used a casserole (9x13) dish instead of pizza pan.

The whole family enjoyed this, even my picky 3 year old had seconds. I put this in my 13x9 pyrex and upped the eggs to 8. Added some diced onion and red bell pepper. It turned out to be a great breakfast casserole. Served with salsa, sour cream, and fresh fruit. Yumm can't wait to make it for company.

This was pretty decent.  I ended up making it in a 9x13 pan instead of trying to use a pizza pan.  Definitely allows you to play around with the ingredients.  Tasted good and will make again.

Very good. I used a 9x13 baking dish. I scrambled the eggs a little bit before pouring them on top of the pizza to avoid the mess that others had talked about. I also pre-baked the crust for about 5min then added the toppings and baked for another 15min - the crust was over cooked. The recipe itself was great however I am not a fan of the Pilsburry dough crust. It has a distinct taste that is not very "home made". I would probably make the dough from scratch next time. Other than that, it is great.

Very good and easy...just a few changes.  I will use 1 1/2 packages of crescent rolls to cover a pizza pan totally and to give enough for a good rim around the edge to keep the egg mixture on the pizza.  I will prebake the crust a little as it was soggy ont he bottom.  We like our hashbrowns well done, so I cooked them in a skillet a little bit before putting them on top.  We skipped the parmesean and had it on the table for anyone who wanted it.  It was really good.

A must try!! This has become a regular request by my 11 year old son's friends when they spend the night - that speaks volumes as everyone loves it!  Like others, I cook the sausage the night before to save time.  I use a quiche dish as well and it does require a small increase in cooking time.   Therefore, the crust turns out perfect and doesn't need to be precooked at all.  Great recipes that also reheats well!

This recipie has been a family favorite of ours for years!

I have always used two cans of refridgerated crescent rolls and spread them out onto a round baking stone.  Cooked up 8 to 10 eggs (scrambled - but don't make them "too done") then placed on top of the crescent rolls then add "toppings" - cut up susage links, ham, different types of cheeses, green pepper - use your imagination.  Then cook in the oven on 350 for approx 15 to 20 minutes.  Pizza is served!

My family was very skeptical about me trying something new for Christmas breakfast... but they all were pleasantly surprised.  This was delicious!  It does seem to take some prep work, but it is pretty easy to make.  I actually made a square pizza on a pizza dish... because it was easier for a novie like myslef and provided room for the egg to bubble over (like many reviewers had mentioned).  Overall... yummy, yummy, yummy!

I made this around Christmas time when I barely had time for anything. I don't know how you're supposed to lay out those crescent rolls so they neatly cover a pizza pan! I used a pie plate because of the other comments I read and added extra baking time to cook the eggs through. Regardless, it was tasty, and relatively easy to make at a time when I needed ease! Thanks for the recipe!

I have had this recipe in my recipe box since 2002 and I'm finally making it!  It was quite yummy!  I ended up using 8 eggs and instead of shredding the cheddar cheese I just put slices of it on top.  It all melts the same!  I also used about 2 cups of "Mexican spice" hash browns and browned them a bit before adding to the pizza.  Next time I think I'll add some veggies to it!

There would be no way to make a round crust so I put them in a shallow baking dish.  Very good and very easy.  If you brown the sausage the day before, then it will take only a few minutes to get it ready for the oven.  Great for busy holiday mornings.

This was just okay for me & my DH - I would have liked more of a crust, it didn't come off the pan very well and I thought it needed a bit more flavor.

I liked this.  It was easy to make and good.  I did add an extra egg and I mixed some salsa in to give it a little zip.  I also used a quiche dish and it worked out nicely.

Pretty good.  I added some onion powder, but it still needs more seasonings.  But my children devoured it, so it was just right for them.  I also added another egg.  Thanks.

I first made this recipe for my daughter's high school class.  They requested it again.  I thought that adding the 1/2 teaspoon of salt made it to salty.  The breakfast sausage and cheese already contain salt.  The second time I cut back on the salt and only used 1/4 teaspoon.

Good basic recipe.  I substituted vegetarian sausage, which worked fine.  We found the finished dish a bit bland--perhaps because of the substitution.  Next time I make it, I'll use turkey sausage and perhaps some additional seasoning.

This pizza is EXCELLENT! Everyone in my family loves it and I also use it in my family daycare. I have kids who don't normally eat eggs or potatoes, but EVERYONE eats this up. I can't say enough about it. It's easy, quick and DELICIOUS!

This was SO good.  I brought it work and had 5 people ask for the recipe.  I used a mixture of Monterey Jack and Cheddar.  Next time, I might use some Pepper Jack.  This is a sure-fire crowd pleaser!!

This was very good and very easy to make.  I think next time I will put it together the night before.  To make it a little less fattening I used lower fat rolls and half the amount of sausage.

I substituted Italian ground sausage for added flavor. One-half cup each of sautéed onions and red peppers were added also.   The breakfast pizza was for a breakfast baby shower - everyone loved it and several asked for the recipe. Next time I'll use turkey sausage, low fat cheese, and try a whole wheat dough to make the dish a little more healthy and reduce the fat.

I followed the directions exactly with the correct measurements and it was awful. The egg oozed out EVERYWHERE because there was just too much. The hashbrowns never browned and my crust burned because I was waiting for them to brown. Definitely won’t be making this again.

My kids and I made this but at the last minute so we put time potatoes instead of sausage and in a big dish, since we do not have a pizza pan and we used biscuits instead of croissants (sorry we had to improvise with what we had) and we sprinkled bacon on top and it was FANTASTIC!!!

I doubled the recipe and bought the crescent roll sheets instead of the individual rolls.  My son suggested we make sausage gravy and put that as a sauce. We can't wait to eat. It smells so yummy.

First time I made it before it was done I said “never again!”   Then I tasted it...AMAZING!  This recipe can be quite messy especially inside your oven.  Recommend that what whatever you cook it on has sides to contain leakage. I also used about a pack and a half of crescent rolls the first time (round) and then 2 the next time  in a rectangle. I didn’t even separate dough just pushed all perforations together. 
Lastly, even the first time I made it I was wary of putting raw potatoes into the the mixture and only cooking a short time so I threw them in a pan for 5 min and cooked them slightly letting them finish in the oven. This way you can control the desired crispyness of them.  This is a delicious and simple recipe. Enjoy

I made this as directed and the eggs were still runny after baking. It's probably better scrambling them first , also pre-baking the crescent roll crust helped with the texture (as per the suggestions from other users , about 5-7 mins).

A very quick & easy recipe to follow. I made mine using sharp cheddar cheese with shredded hash browns. I then added the egg mixture  & it turned out delicious! We had this as our Christmas Brunch... I will make this one again.

To make things easier I used Jimmy Dean pre-cooked sausage crumbles, worked just fine. The first time I made it I think I piled each of the layers too much and it turned out fine but way too thick.  I used six eggs because the ones I had on hand were rather small. 
The taste was great, especially with a little splash of hot sauce!

I didn't actually plan to make this recipe, so I didn't shop for it.  I used this recipe as a guide to make a breakfast casserole in a 9" pie dish this morning (I didn't have a pizza pan the right size).  I only had hash brown patties on hand, so I precooked those and chopped them up.  They stuck up from the eggs and were nice and crispy.  Again, I didn't have parmesan, so I used a mix of mozzarella and sharp cheddar.   I also added onions to the sausage when I cooked it.   Due to other reviews that also made changes, I did bake the crust 6-7 minutes before I topped it and was glad I did.  Family loved it.  Good topped with gravy!

I made it according to the recipe. I did use a crescent roll sheet instead of the triangle. I am not a fan of the Parmesan cheese on it  and I cooked it a little to long but I did like it. ! I will change up a few things on it for next time.

I made this dish on Thanksgiving morning for my wife and son. My son doesn't like sausage or hash browns. He absolutely loved it. My wife loved it too. I used the exact recipe and it was great. It was almost as good the next day too.

I never follow directions...I used the crescent rolls as the "crust". But, I had leftover sliced steak with sliced onions and bell peppers I used instead of sausage. I lightly scrambled the eggs with sliced mushrooms in a frying pan. I didn't have hash browns, so I used tater tots instead. I layered the ingredients and topped it off with a ton of shredded cheese. There were no leftovers!!

Everybody loved this!  I used a 9 x 13 glass dish.  1 can of crescents covered the bottom.  I baked it for 5 minutes but will not do that next time.  Almost came out burnt.  Needed 7 eggs.   I did fry the hash browns for a short time.  Definitely, need to bake at least 30 minutes.  Otherwise, followed the recipe and it came out great.  Good when you have several people to feed.

This was good. However, the the recipe has way to much of the ingredients for the size of the crust made by the crescent roll wedges.  Eggs and cheese overran the crust. Luckily I used a large pizza pan with sides that kept it from running into the oven. Cut everything nearly in half. Very tasty, though.

I have made this recipe for years and love it for company.  I had a problem with the eggs going over the edge so I decided to make it in a 9 x 13 glass dish the last time and came out great.  It's a recipe that my company asks for.

Great concept but why use crescent rolls to make a pizza?  It is much better if you use a prepared pizza crust, preferably thin crust.  You can even use the Weber outside to cook it.

I hve been making this recipe since the 1990's.  Made it on a pizza pan and also in a cake pan.  Both come out beautifully.  I have los substituted ham or bacon for the sausage and it's simply delish!!

I made this using a round pizza pan with edges. I used half a pound breakfast sausage and half a pound fried bacon crumbled. Also, I use one and a half cups of shredded hash browns and cheddar cheese. I make it as directed and it turns out perfectly each time. We make this ahead of time and will eat it heated up in the microwave, or make it in the camper oven and turns out beautifully. Otherwise, it turns out perfectly at home in the oven as well. Thank you!

I was really excited to make this.  It smelled good the whole time it was baking, but with my first bite I just didn't like it.  There was just no flavor.  0 out of 4 people in my family liked this.  Looks like the dog is going to get the leftovers :(  I'm sure he'll love it.

I messed up and put the cheese on top instead of on top of the hashbrowns and topping it off with the eggs.  I mixed the parmesan cheese in with the eggs and I don't know if that's what made it not cook well or what--I am really just starting to cook again after being a carry-out queen for 30 years--so the end result was my fault.  I also cooked the pizza crust first before adding the toppings and it was VERY crispy since I made it in the pizza pan.  Cooking at 4 a.m. may have been the  overall factor in the poor outcome.

I gave this one star because following the directions resulted in a huge mess of egg all over my pizza stone and oven.  I wish I had read the other reviews first as I would have used a 9x12 pan.  The recipe itself is probably good when you don't have to scrape it off the inside of your oven.

Read the reviews! Why didn't I read the reviews! It was so pretty til I added the egg and it went all over the place. I used cheese, onion, and tomato. 

Arg. It's still cooking but I know it's going to be a soggy mess

I've made this several times.  Buy the crescent roll dough that is all in one piece and spread it in a 9x13 baking pan.  Make sure there aren't any holes and curl the edges up slightly to hold the eggs in.  Bake the crust for approximately 8 minutes before adding the filling.  This is much quicker to put together in the morning if you fry the sausage the night before and partially cook the hash browns.  Then all you have to do in the morning is spread the crust and partially bake, add the toppings and bake.

This is our Christmas tradition! I partially cook (scrambled in a skillet) the eggs before adding them to the pizza, otherwise they run over the edge of the pizza pan & make a huge mess. I also add sauteed peppers & mushrooms & fresh parsley & rosemary for extra flavor. We love it!

This turned out really well! I used a glass pie baking dish instead  of a pizza tray, because I read that some other reviewers had trouble keeping the eggs from running over. About 5-10 minutes from it being finished in the oven, I brushed the outer crust with maple syrup. It was a good move....so yummy.

I like to add other ingredients as well: onion, garlic, tomatoes, mushrooms, bacon, etc. i have trouble making the cresent rolls stretch to cover my pizza pan but it works out fine. I slowly add the eggs and guide them into the crevices so they down run off the pizza.

Gave this a little twist of my own, browned the hash browns a bit to prevent sogginess and doubled this up for my family, very delish and tasty! Thanks Tammy!

This is an easy, inexpensive breakfast to make (especially when you have to feed a large amount of people). I got a very similar recipe from my mother in law and I love it. I do a few things different though. I use bacon instead of sausage...I dont really care for sausage. I also used a shredded potato that I fry into hash browns instead of frozen. I use a cake pan  (13x9 I believe) and I use 7 eggs instead of 5. If I have parmesan cheese I'll use it but I dont find it a necessary part of the recipe. I dont measure anything either. I put as much cheese as I feel like...same with any seasoning. I haven't attempted to make it in a pizza pan but that seems like it would be a mess.

All in all, excellent recipe but a "recipe" doesn't need to be followed I feel. Get the gist of it and make it your own!

As much work as a casserole, but a much faster cook time!  Everyone loved it!  Hats off to the person that said to bake in a jelly pan on parchment paper.  Super easy cleanup!

The recipe is delicious, but DO NOT make this on a pizza pan! The eggs ended up all over the oven.  I will make this again, but I'll cook it in a pie an instead.

Great dish, my husband and children really enjoyed it. I added sage to the sausage.  Removed sausage from skillet and cooked the hash browns with some dried onion flakes in the same pan just until they started to brown.  Used grated cheddar and Mozzarella cheese. Added Italian seasoning, salt and pepper to 7 eggs.  baked the dough for 6 min. before adding toppings, next time I will only go about 4 min.  Will absolutely make again.

My mother makes this same recipe every year for Christmas, and I've carried on the tradition!  This year I couldn't find Mom's recipe, so I turned to Allrecipes and luckily was able to find it.  One note, though:  DO NOT USE THAT MANY EGGS!!!!! I've had the same vexing problem every year; the eggs leak out of the side of the raised crust, no matter how careful I am.  Use about half that amount of the liquid mixture.

Too much egg!  Not enough crescent rolls!   It took 1 1/2 packages of crescents rolls not one to make the 12 inch pizza pan crust.  I used four eggs instead of five and the egg STILL ran over.  It gets the Three stars for flavor.  I will purchase THREE crescent roll packages and use five eggs BUT I will make TWO pizzas and double amount of cheese, etc.  That should make it worthy of FIVE stars!

Ok so this tastes great - BUT I couldn't fully enjoy it knowing how crazy unhealthy it was! It was just a little much for me, especially with the crescent roll crust which gave such a rich buttery flavor that somewhat overwhelmed the rest of the pizza. I think if I ever make a breakfast pizza again I will use a much lighter, thinner crust. But after this, I don't have a desire to make it again. Hubby liked it a lot so that's why I still gave 4 stars.

I have made this recipe for YEARS as our Christmas morning breakfast. (It's been a tradition longer than that in my husband's family.) For those having issues with the eggs "offloading," you can use one less egg and it still turns out wonderfully. Also, I have learned that pouring the eggs in before putting the cheese on top makes a big difference. The best pan I've made this in is a tart pan with a removable bottom--it makes it easier to cut when serving.

I decided to put the crescent rolls on top and it was awesome! Much better than a soggy crust.  My hubby decided it was the best breakfast casserole I've ever fixed.

Very good!  I made only a couple *slight* changes: first, I took the advice of another reviewer and prebaked the crust for about 5 minutes before topping.  My other changes was I added about 1/4 tsp. seasoned salt in lieu of salt and pepper and sauteed onions and red & green bell peppers for extra flavor and color.  I agree that one can of crescent rolls may not be enough, but it worked.  You do have to make sure that you seal the edges and raise up the edges enough or you will have leakage of the egg.  I suggest lining  your pizza pan with foil and spray with a little cooking spray so it won't stick.

I love breakfast pizza. I use the pizza roll dough though; it's easier than pressing the croissant rolls together. I prebake the crust, eggs, and sauage and then throw it all on top with cheese. Nuke in the oven for a few minutes for the cheese to melt and serve with hot syrup. yum!

My family has been baking this pizza for 25+years!  The boys always wanted the sausage version, but Mom & I had our own made with shrimp and/or crab (approx 1lb) instead of meat.  Definately use homemade hashbrowns from baked potatoes, it is much, much better, and don't be afraid to use a mixture of cheeses for tons more flavor.

Made this as the recipe called for, except a few minor tweaks. I used canned pizza dough in a 9x13 pan, since I did not have crescent roll dough on hand. I also shredded leftover baked potato in the place of the frozen hash browns to make it healthier. I followed some other reccomendations and upped the eggs to 6. My kids and I loved it.

I brought this to a 7th grade girls basketball spread, it was devoured! The only changes I made, I used 2  pre made pizza crusts and did not use all of the egg mix, it started to run off the crust. I made this the next weekend for my family, definitely a keeper!

The cheese near the top led to a stiff product after baking. Either put the cheese on the bottom or add it to the top near the end. It was DRY. I think a biscuit sauce would do wonders for this recipe. The potatoes should not be included. They added more blandness to the flavor. I even added onions and peppers to make it more flavorful but the overpowering blandness of the entire dish was too strong. This is also very fattening. If you watch your fat intake, use pizza crust since it has far less fat than crescent rolls.

My Mom made this exact recipe every Christmas morning for our family growing up. I decided to make it for my husband and I's first Christmas together. It was just as I had remembered.....yummy! It brought back a lot of wonderful memories.

My grandma always used to make this for Christmas morning breakfast...after the first time she made it, I requested it every year.  Now I continue the tradition.  This is DELICIOUS!

This was good, and I probably will make it again. The crust was delicious, but the potatoes were not cooked enough. I would suggest frying the hashbrowns before adding them to the casserole.

I never write reviews, but this recipe was so horrible I had to write something.  If I could, I'd give this no stars.  We used a baking sheet and the eggs still ran over and burnt.  There ended up being very little egg if any that ended up in the pizza.  Besides that, the combination was atrocious.  Needless to say, we won't be cooking this again.

Everyone I served this to said it was really good.  Used a package of shredded mexican cheese blend instead of plain cheddar.  It's what I had.  I would think any cheese you have would be good on this.

Very good recipe.  I add crumbled bacon and diced deli ham to my pizza.  I also bake the crescent roll dough for 5 minutes before topping it with everything else so that it won't become soggy.

This was very good.  I did make it in a pan with sides on it.  Next time I will use hash browns that have peppers and onions in them for a bit more flavor.  Thanks!

I spiced this up with a little premade green chili sauce. It was pretty bland. I didn't have any frozen hash browns, so I used fresh and browned them a little. I also used bacon instead of sausage, and cooked it up with a little diced onion. It tasted ok, but was soooo not worth all the effort. Sorry, but I won't be making this one again.

Not bad...I added 3 extra eggs and increased baking time to 35 minutes as dough was still soggy at 30 minutes.  Also, I omitted hash browns.

This was ok.  First of all, don't try it on a pizza  baking stone, the egg drips everywhere out of the crust once it starts baking.  That was a nightmare, but my fault for doing that; I'm not usually that airy!  But I don't have a pizza PAN, as we cook our pizzas on the stone.  Also, how do you make a circle pizza as described in the recipe with one container of crescent rolls??  I could only get a semi circle...So I rolled the dough up and flattened it out into a crust...But ended up transferring the whole thing to a pie dish since the eggs ran all over the pizza stone and stove...so we had breakfast pizza mush out of a pie dish.  maybe next time i'll try it with a pizza PAN if I ever buy one.

What a great idea. I used a pizza crust with dough I made in my bread machine instead of the crescent rolls and ham and bacon in place of the sausage. I found it to be very eggy tasting - almost like a frittata. I am personally not a big fan of eggs so I wasn't really too crazy about it but I'm sure a lot of egg lovers out there would love it.

I made this for Christmas breakfast. Luckily my husband came to my rescue when I attempted to shape the crescent rolls into a pizza shape. I won't use the crescent rolls again, but rather a regular pizza crust. I also substituted shredded hash browns in the recipe. Overall, with a couple of changes, it will be a family staple for us.

I substituted Potatoes O'Brien for the hash browns - the peppers and onions added a little extra zing.  Also, I don't like sausage, so I browned a pound of bacon in the oven and crumbled it in place of the sausage. I served it with salsa and it was a big hit!

This was a GREAT recipe!  I was so happy to finally find a breakfast pizza recipe that was easy enough.  I had enough leftovers for 4 single servings - I put each serving in its own container and just heated it up in the morning as needed.  Very handy to make ahead on the weekend for a delicious, no-fuss breakfast during the week.
