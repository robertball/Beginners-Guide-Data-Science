This was pretty good and I think I would make it again.  The kids didn't like it (but that's par for the course).  You know, anything green is to be avoided at all costs! haha  My husband and I both enjoyed it though and recommend you make Slow Cooker Chicken with Dumplings to go with it.

Our family loves this dish! I was looking for something different for Thanksgiving that didn't use fancier 'green' veggies that the kids - and hubby!- don't like. This is it! We now have it often. I like to use fresh broccoli instead of frozen, and some minced onion. Mmmm. Not usually any leftovers but if there are, it tastes just as good the second day.

We enjoyed this.  I liked the way the spices mixed together.  I will add more cheese next time because it was hard to taste, but otherwise I thought it was great!

When it starts to cool off, it's nasty.  Not sure why.
