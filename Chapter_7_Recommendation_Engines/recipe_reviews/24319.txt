i rated this  5* only because it is at least a four, and the last review did not do it justice... I added a teensy pinch of sugar, decreased the carrot by 2/3, and added zucchini, yellow squash, extra garlic and oregano, and some basil, and it was wonderful, garden-fresh, and satisfying!  Served over penne pasta tossed with olive oil, parmasan, fresh parsley, black and red pepper, and salt.  Awesome!

I was looking for a sauce to make with some of the last tomatoes of the season (from greenhouse) that was a little out of the ordinary.  This recipe was easy and tasty. Although not one I'd serve over pasta often, I can imagine how good it would be as a sauce for baked chicken and the like.  A few changes that I made:  I used about a dozen fresh tomatoes instead of canned, omitted the parsley and added tarragon, basil & a bay leaf.  I also salted and peppered to taste and added a few teaspoons of tomato paste for more of a tomato flavor.

This was spectacular! The only thing we did different was to use what we loving call the boat motor (aka hand blender)to really blend everything together. As usual with anything tomatoe based, my husband was the one to be impressed. He loved it.

This is not a tomato sauce. It's a light vegetable sauce. While it was very delicious, I was very disappointed as I was expecting a nice, thick, chunky tomato sauce. Just because it has cans of diced tomato does not make it a tomato sauce. Very, very disappointed.

Very good!  I changed the recipe a bit due to a lack of ingredients on hand.  No carrots, less celery.  I also added a bit of red wine and halved cherry tomatoes, and served it over spaghetti squash, topped with feta cheese.

The secret of all Italian mothers and grandmothers has been revealed! For kids who don't like their veggies or for a nourishing meal-in-one, le mamma e le nonne have been secretly giving this recipe (in Italian called "sugo alle verdure") topped with lots of cheese to their kids and none have been the wiser.  And hey, why not add a grated zucchine too? The secret is to blend everything or pass it through a vegetable strainer before serving. I made a double portion in a slow cooker for 3 hours on high, adding some fresh basil in the end before storing in airtight containers in the fridge. Thank you The Iron Chef Suzi-Q for this wonderful recipe.

I also added some basil, 1-T salt and 1-t pepper; but I did a double batch and also used fresh tomatoes.
