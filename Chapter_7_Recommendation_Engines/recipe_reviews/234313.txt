This was good! I couldn't bring myself to add all of the bean liquid, so I did drain the beans, but I did not rinse them. I also chopped the stewed tomatoes to make it easier for the kids to eat, and ended up adding a 15oz. can of tomato sauce to make it more 'red'. This thickened up great and had really nice flavor. Very easy to make...I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Old Mama's Fashioned Chili Haiku: "This is CRAZY thick. I had to add some water. I did simmer long." I like to let the house absorb the warm smell of chili and couldn't let this simply simmer for 15-20 min. so after checking on it at 30 min., found it way too thick and goopy (due to very little liquid that went it), so I added some water. I liked the addition of stewed tomatoes, rather than diced, along w/ the directive to cut the onion and bell pepper into a larger 1/2" dice. Made it look really chunky and pretty, and my DD was able to pluck out what she didn't necessarily want to eat in each bite. A nice, simple chili; nothing made it stand out as a remarkable chili, but it WAS good and I can only imagine that the leftovers will be even better.

It's good with a touch of cumin!  I made it according to the recipe and it came in 2nd place at a church chili cook off!  I was quite proud, and I also shared the website with all the ladies that wanted the recipe!   (I think added the cumin would have gotten me first place)    :-)

Really enjoyed the dish...thanks for sharing.  I added an extra 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes to thin the sauce a bit.  I also doubled the garlic (personal preference).  As with most chilies. it was  even better the second day!  The chili paired well with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread (recipe is also available at All Recipes).

Prepping chili is basically a requirement for camping. We always end up signing up to feed everyone for a couple meals, and this chili recipe was great!

Things I would change: add a but more ground beef. Maybe 1.5 lbs. I also drained the beans but dumped the tomatoes in without draining. I like thick chili! It seemed too thick at first but after simmering it was perfect consistency. A lot of the flavor depends on what chili mix or spices you use... the latest was too spicy for me, but that's totally my fault. We serve with Fritos and sour cream and sprinkle cheese on top. Yum! Easy!

I substituted ground venison for the  beef. Cubanelle pepper instead of green. I also used cumin, chilli powder,marjoram to taste. We loved it.
