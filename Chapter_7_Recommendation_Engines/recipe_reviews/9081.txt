I substituted dark rum for the brandy. I also put chopped pecans mixed with brown sugar on top and baked it at 350 for 30 minutes. It is delicious!

Delicious and different!  My son and I really enjoyed these.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that you have to cook the sauce down till it loses that strong alcohol flavor and develops a glaze-like consistency.  Best sweet potato recipe I've ever tried - definitely a keeper for me!

I made it three times over the Thanksgiving holiday (three different Thanksgivings... mmmmmm) and every time, people wanted the recipe. Its delicious, and I recommend cooking it longer than the recipe says by  an extra 20-30 minutes.

Delicious!  Much more sophisticated flavor than the usual candied sweet potatoes with marshmallows.  The recipe did not say to cook until the glaze thickens, but I assume that's what is supposed to happen.  It did take awhile to thicken, but it didn't require constant stirring, so I was able to work on other foods while it was cooking.

As a B.S. nutritionist, I am always looking for low-cal, low-fat options for my patients.  This is a lot less sweet than regular candied sweet potatoes.  I, and my diabetic husband, really enjoyed this recipe.  The brandy really brings out the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes and isn't masked by excessive marshmellows!!!  I've even shared this recipe with my nutrition ed. classes!

Very good - most definitely not your ordinary yams with melted marshmellows on top.  These had a distinct flavor that was not rooted in sugary sweetness.  Instead, it was much more refined and complex while the dish itself was lighter on the palette than the standard faire.

I didn't like it (and I'll eat almost anything) and neither did the rest of the family.

At first it seemed like the brandy taste was way to strong. What the recipe fails to tell you is that you need to reduce the sauce for awhile until it turns to a soft caramel texture.

I tasted the sauce after it was reduced and it was good, so I still had hopes the recipe would turn out. But the sauce (in my opinion) it too strong even after reduction.

These were the hit of Thanksgiving dinner.  It took a while for the glaze to reduce, but the end result was heavenly.  The brandy added a great taste without being overpowering.  This will be our Thanksgiving sweet potato recipe from now on!

A wonderful, easy, adult-tasting recipe.  Served it for Thanksgiving and it went wonderfully with all the other flavors.  You can just get a hint of the brandy coming through and it's wonderful.  Will use less butter next time though.  Didn't need half a cup.

I can't believe I haven't rated this yet.  I have been making this recipe for years.  It's always a big hit.  If I am short on stove top space, I have made the sauce and pour on top of uncooked sliced potatoes and baked in oven.

Having no brandy, I substituted with spiced rum and the dish was still delicious! I took another reviewer's advice and baked it.  The glaze thickens as it cools.

VERY GOOD!  I cut the recipe in half as there are only two of us.  The flavor was not as sweet as other recipes, which really surprised me.  Hubby preferred it to be a little sweeter, so next time I'll add a little dark corn syrup.  I simmered it while I finished cooking dinner and it thickened nicely.  There were no left overs!  Thank you Kathy Bennett for sharing your recipe!

Wow, so very good! I added a splash of vanilla, a little nutmeg and cinnamon too! Just enough to bring out all the flavors. This is too die for delicious! Everyone must try! And also added a little less brandy. Perfect! I will make again and again!

I've been bringing this dish to Thanksgiving for 12 years.  Last year I showed up with a different sweet potato dish and was met with looks of horror.  Later on, my mother pulled me quietly aside and told me to never pull anything like that again.

The only brandy I had was orange brandy.  It was fabulous.  I will be making this again for sure and will probably use the orange brandy again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Love this!  I substituted 1/4 C. Grand Marnier + 1/4 C. fresh orange juice for the brandy and added a bit of orange zest.

I like brandy, I like brown sugar, and I'll eat sweet potatoes if I have to.  This recipe actually made me look FORWARD to eating sweet potatoes (and the leftovers) because it smelled so good while it was cooking.  Made it mainly for my husband & father (who both like sweet potatoes) for the holidays & I think I ate more of it than they did!  This recipe can be a little sweet to some people, but with a turkey dinner it's fabulous.

I made a batch to serve 8...didn't have a way to measure out 1-1/4 pounds of sweet potatoes, so I just cubed 2.  Very light-sweet glaze, and the taste of the sweet potato was not lost.  I really enjoyed it, thank you!

This is a great recipe.  Adds a nice twist of elegance to an old favorite without being fussy or difficult.  Also, can be modified by adding Pecans or changing liquor.  I've used Irish Whiskey and Bourbon.

This is the only sweet potato recipe I use for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Gone are the days of marshmallows on top!  The brandy is perfect; over all not too sweet.  Just right.

I liked the fresh taste of the sweet potatoes.  I will cut back on the butter if I make this again.

11/10 - small changes this year.  I prepared them as directed and then spooned them into a small dish the night before, topped with small marshmallows and will reheat and brown prior to dinner.  :-9

I make this for Thanksgiving due to my family's high demand.  This year I used raw sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced (huge potatoes, cut in 1/2 lengthwise, then sliced).  Lay out in 9x5 baking dish, pour the sauce over potatoes and bake with foil on top until potatoes were tender.  (I put it in the oven while baking other things, so I am guessing 350 for an hour will be plenty.)  Remove foil, and broil to 'toast' the top, serve.

I made this recipe and took it to our Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. Thank you for the tips to reduce the sauce though, that saved me some time. Definately a keeper, will be my sweet potato recipe from now on. Very yummy.

I made this recipe for our Thanksgiving gathering of 2004 and it was a BIG hit!  It was liked by all even those that did not care for sweet potatoes.  Thank you

This is the dish I am required to bring to every Thanksgiving and Easter gathering that my family has. I've made it for years and it's always a hit! It is SO easy to make! I occasionally add a little chili powder to balance out the sweetness and it's delicious.

I made this as a side dish for Christmas dinner. I read the reviews and was a little apprehensive but decided to go for it anyhow. I should have rethought that. I made the glaze before adding the sweet potatoes so I could give it some time to blend flavors and hopefully have the alcohol flavor dissipate a little. It didn’t. I added extra brown sugar and some cinnamon but the alcohol flavor was still so strong after about 35 minutes of simmering. The idea for the recipe is good but I just didn’t care for the flavor. I won’t be making it again.

This recipe turned out fantastic. And it kept getting tastier as the days went by. A few alterations were made, but I’m sure it would have been great as is. We used half the butter and added olive oil. I used a few drops of orange essential oil plus cinnamon and ginger. It was delicious!

I liked it but my wife didn't. I think the Brady flavor was a little stronger than expected. But hey I like trying new recipes for sweet potatoes. This one wasn't overly sweet

Really nice upgrade to the traditional sweet potato recipe. Like other reviewers, I recommend letting the glaze reduce so that the alcohol cooks off - I was waiting for the turkey to finish, so I ended up letting the glaze simmer at the lowest stovetop setting for about an hour before adding to the cooked sweet potatoes. I had just over 4 lbs of sweet potatoes, and just doubled the glaze recipe; next time, I think I might dial the brandy back a bit to 3/4 cup. But there will definitely be a next time!

Sorry, but these were not liked by anyone in my family.  We all love sweet potatoes, but the only thing you could taste was the brandy. Easy to prepare, though.
