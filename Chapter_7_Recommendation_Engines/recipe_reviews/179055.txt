This was so good and so easy!  I used sweet potato, sweet onion, turnips, parsnips and carrots.  Be sure to check it before the time because mine were done early.  Use some aluminum foil to line your pan and no clean up.

This is a great recipe.  I tried it as it is published first.  Then I tried some variations.  My favorite is with small red potatoes, sweet potato, carrots, parsnips, turnips, red onion, garlic, and large red pepper strips (I had quite a bit of red pepper leftover in my crisper).  I toss with olive oil, add a touch of seasoning salt and I even tried changing the taste up by using marjoram instead of thyme.  Either way it's a winner!

I'd never tried parsnip, celeriac, or rutabaga before, but I was curious, so I tried them.  The parsnip and celeriac were excellent, but the rutabaga was too bitter.  This recipe would be a 5 if it didn't contain rutabaga. Oh, and you should decrease the cooking time a bit.

Matt made these for Thanksgiving.  I grumbled and grumbled about doing something that takes so long the day of.  Well, I was wrong!  It was the most well received veggie dish of the day.  Everyone loved them.

A great way to prepare and serve root vegetables, and just in time for the upcoming holidays! I did two things differently - tossed the veggies in olive oil and added some crushed red pepper flakes. This garlic and rosemary is a traditionally tasty combination, and with this recipe other combinations will also result in a success. Squash is another fine choice to add to the veggie mix. 

Rutabaga Tips: For those who have had rutabaga taste bitter, it is all in how to select one. Choose rutabaga that is firm/solid and heavy for its size. The skin should be free of major damage/blemishes, but the rigid scars around the top are natural. Smaller rutabagas are generally sweeter and milder. So for those who had a not-so-positive first experience with this veggie, give it another whirl! Also, keep in mind that roasting a rutabaga will bring out/intensify its flavor, whereas boiling/steaming it will dilute it.

Loved the taste of this. I used what veggies I had on hand (yellow-skinned potatoes, carrots, turnip, and yam). I will certainly try again in the future with rutabaga and parsnips. Brussels Sprouts would probably be nice in the blend, as well.

I have only just gotten this recipe, so I'll review at a later date.  This is a tip re bitter rutabaga.  It's from The Victory Garden Cookbook:  If turnips or rubataga are large or old,  first blanch in boiling water for 4-5 minutes to remove strong or bitter flavor.

Guess I have picky eaters. The family didn't care for it. I thought the flavors were good but not worth all the work for the dish. It might be a good side on a holiday dinner.

This is a wonderful way to take advantage of the winter farmers markets.  The first time I made it following the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.  I've made it a few times now.  I've started adding chunks of cabbage to it, the husband has asked that I make the "baked cabbage" again.  Before this he didn't know he liked cabbage.

I hate vegetables...but this was AWESOME!!  I used chicken broth and added brussel sprouts (amazing) and cauliflower and broccoli.  I didn't have any garlic, so I used garlic flakes and garlic powder.  VERY DELICIOUS!!  Oh, I did leave out the rutabaga because I had read they are bitter, but I may try it next time.

I used what root vegatables I had in the house, potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions, carrots.  Followed the general directions but made it for two people using dried spices.  Easy, quick, but does need less time to cook than in the recipe.  I will definitely make again, with more vegetables.

I just put this in the oven but following the recipe to a T, this will feed twice, if not more, as many people.  I only put half of it in the oven (didn't halve the oil mixture though) and I think with 5 adults and 2 children we will still have left overs.  I'll come back to update this review after we've actually eaten.

Two of us finished off a panful of carrots, parsnips and sweat potato. The man, who never eats vegetables, devoured most of it right out of the roasting dish. Delicious.

While I have never been a huge vegetable fan, this recipe was very tasty. I did have to adjust the cooking time, however. Also, I couldn't find celery root so I used turnips instead, which worked fine.

Perfect recipe for thanksgiving dinner, and even better for a take along for potlucks.   I used a combination of sweet potatos, yams, rutabaga, carrots, beets and red onion, so delicious.

Great recipe that can be adapted to your taste.  I added some beets and used sweet potatoes instead of red skins.  I also substituted chardonnay for the broth.  I was pleasantly surprised that everything didn't turn pink from beets...just nice color.

Really delicious. I was skeptical as I had never eaten parsnips or rutabagas. I didn't have potatoes or celery root, so I used parsnips, rutabagas, turnips, onions and garlic. I also used fresh thyme. It came out delicious.  My daughter snarfed almost the entire recipe - I was lucky to get a few spoonfuls!  I'll make this again.

I tried this recipe a couple times and they turned out great both times.  Any root vegetables are good, I particularly like sunchoke, celery, carrots, red onion and butternut squash.  There is no reason to put additional vegetable broth (but I also reduced the oven time).   I crushed the garlic and mixed it with the root vegetables.  The veggies are sweet and tangy, Yum!

This was very good! I didn't have celeriac, and I used a little of both rosemary and thyme. Delicious!
