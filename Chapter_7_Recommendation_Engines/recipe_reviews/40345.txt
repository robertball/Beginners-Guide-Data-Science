This is a wonderful recipe. The first time I made it just as written. The second time I didn't slice the breasts but left them whole, topped with a roasted red bell pepper, then smothered all with the sauce. I served this over rice, and it really took 30 minutes or less to make. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this and my family loved it! I definitely recommend it. The only change I made was use sour cream and half & half instead of the heavy cream and it worked just fine.

Really good and unique! A mustard & chive cream sauce...who wouldva thought? We were all pleasantly surprised by this dish! When sauting the chicken, I added some fresh, sliced muchrooms. I added some garlic/onion powder when wisking in the flour and when the sauce was beginning to thicken and it came time to mix in the parmesan and chives, I also added a small jar of diced pimentos for a little additional color. Served all over angel hair pasta. Very good and would make this tasty dish again. Thanks for sharing this Theresa!!

THIS REALLY IS AN EXCELLENT RECIPE. THE MUSTARD GIVES IT JUST THE RIGHT FLAVOR. AND IT IS ALOT QUICKER TO MAKE THAN IT LOOKS.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

this dish is really good, i added an extra clove of garlic and put a little garlic salt on the chicken when it was cooking, i like a lot of garlic... i thought my spicy mustard i have would have over powered everything else but i was way wrong, it came out perfect.. the mustard smell was strong, and you could definitely taste it in the sauce but it was not way too much mustard.. i served it over noodles as some other users suggested... i'll be making this more often.

This dish is simply delicious and simple to make.  I replaced the coarsed grained prepared mustard with your typical dijon mustard and the chives sauce turned out great.  I recommend that you accompany this dish with the gourmet mushroom risotto recipe since both dishes have parmesan cheese and chives as ingredients.  What a great combination!  My girlfriend told me that it was the best supper I've ever prepared for her.

This is a diamond in the rough. I was worried that only one person reveiwed this before me but it was great. My teenage son inhaled it. My mom who is hard to please raved about it. the only thing i did differant is add salt and white pepper. I will use this over again... and it looks Great.

I thought this was pretty good. Unfortunately, I forgot my husband is not a big fan of mustard.  I disagree with the other review that says you could add more.  I thought it smelled quite mustardy.  I also disagree about the grease.  I had even commented during dinner that I thought this sauce was a lot less greasy than other white sauces I've tried to make.  It had a nice thick texture and good flavor.

I made this for dinner last night and we thought it was pretty good.  I followed the recipe almost exactly with a few minor exceptions.  I used only 2 large chicken breasts and it was the perfect amount to feed 4 very hungry adults.  I can't imagine using 5 chicken breasts in this dish - there would be waaaay too much chicken IMHO.  The only other change I made was to add a bit of chopped Italian parsley at the end for a hit of colour.  In the end, we did like it, but found it to be a tad on the bland side (the mustard was the primary flavour).  I might try this dish again, but I would increase the amount of garlic and chives...and of course salt and pepper the chicken while cooking.

This recipe is excellent!  If you play with the ingredients a little you can flavor it towards whatever you want.  I added some salt and pepper. If the sauce gets too thick just add a little more milk.  The parmesan gave it a slight Alfredo taste which was good.  I thought the amount of chives was too much but it was fine (I used dried.)  Might use a little more garlic next time.  All in all this chicken is VERY good!

Easy to throw together with ingredients I always have in the kitchen. Yummy over penne or rotini. Would probably be good over rice as well. I usually add more cheese than the recipe calls for, because I love cheese!!

This is a great base for pasta, I tried it and found myself adding some other bits and pieces as i went along.
I added more Mustard and i also tried a squeeze of Lemon- which really hit the spot for me. I also added some fresh Herbs as i found it a little bland in the beginning.. add a handful of Corn and its a great balanced meal...

My family and I really liked this one. I had reservations about putting mustard in the sauce, but it was wonderful. You'd only be able to pick out a mustard flavor if someone told you about it. Pretty easy to make. I used slightly less than a full pound of pasta, though - I like a higher sauce:pasta ratio. I'll be making this again soon. Thanks for the recipe!

Average if you follow the recipe.  We added more mustard and it really added some nice flavor. Goes great over pasta.

I was a little disappointed with the lack of flavor in the sauce. I thought the chive flavor would be more pronounced than it was. This cook be related to the quality of the fresh chives I used because of the season. I plan on trying this recipe again next spring when I can use chives fresh from my garden. Hopefully the dish will then be as good as other reviewers say it is. If not, I won't try it again.

Excellent recipe!
I tried a whitish sauce for the first time using this recipe, and it turned out great!
I skipped the mustard and added rosemary instead. Moreover, the sauce is excellent even without the chicken,

I'm giving it 4 stars because I found the sauce to be a little bland as the recipe called for. (I made it exactly as written) So I added some salt, pepper, onion powder and oregano for more flavor. Other than it being a little bland originally, it was delicious and relatively easy to make. It took a little longer than the time stated to cook, but that could easily be my fault. I'm just getting into really cooking things outside of the 10 meals I always make. So, I'm really trying to take my time and do the recipes right. 

My guys loved it and I will be making it again. Thanks!

This tasted good.  I would never say it didn't taste good.  I think you could add even more mustard, and it would taste even better.  But it was SO GREASY!  You won't notice it as much when you're eating it fresh, but if you re-heat it, you'll be left with a LAKE of grease at the bottom of your plate.  I may try it with lower-fat mlik and half and half if I make it again.

We enjoyed this recipe.  It was a little too mustardy for me, so next time I'll reduce the amount of that a litle bit.  Also, I did add the juice from 1/2 a lemon.  This recipe was quick and easy and I will be making it again.

Loved it!  And I used freeze-dried chives.  Absolutely delicious, used with Farfalle pasta.  I cut the mustard  in half since other reviewers complained about the mustard taste, but I thought it could have used more!  This is a very HEAVY dish, you will only be able to eat a small portion, but it is definitely delicious!

Excellent dish that didn't take that much time to make.  I also added in some button mushrooms and pimentos to balance the dish out plus a small spring salad on the side.  Will definitely make again.....

I thought that this was very easy, I didn't have to buy much to make it, and it had a really unique taste.  I may use more mustard next time just to boost the flavor, but all in all I would definitely make this again.  The sauce went well over rotini.

Such a refreshing change from the old boring chicken recipes that I had.  My family loved it!
