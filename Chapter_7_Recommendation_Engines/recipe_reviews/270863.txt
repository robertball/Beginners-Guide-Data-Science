Changed this one up just a little and used twice the cheese, and had enough chicken to double the numbers of tortillas. Made a little extra sauce. Finely chopped a medium onion and mixed it in withe the cheese. Put half the cheese inside the enchiladas and the other half on top. Would have given it the fifth star but I used the lime and Iâ€™m not that big a lime fan. Will make it again (without the lime).
