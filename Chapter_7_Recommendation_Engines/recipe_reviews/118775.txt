This dish was terrific!  I made a few alterations- I don't have a dutch oven, so I just browned the meat with the onion, and boiled the diced tomatoes, celery and carrots with the noodles for the recommended time (bring to boil and then simmer for about 20 minutes, I believe).  I used about 1/2 the spinach, and then mixed it all together.  I put down 1 layer of the mix and then topped with cheddar and french fried onions, and then another layer of the mix topped with the parmesan.  Baked for the time and it came out fantastic!  Very light and healthy dish with some great flavor!
Thanks!

Very good!  I used fresh spinach, just adding it to the last couple minutes of cook time for the boiling noodles.  Easy, nutritious, and delicious!

Loved this. I had a similar idea but felt like I was missing something. When I found this I realized it was the tomatoes. I actually used a box of shells and cheese, seasoned burger, a jar of homemade rotel, a bag of frozen spinach, and mixed in a bag of shredded colby jack cheese (on top of the cheese that came with the shells) The rotel gave it a kick, but not too much. I didn't have the carrots or celery on hand but I think it was ok w/o. Yum! Thanks for posting!!

My husband loved this.  I am only giving it a four because I changed it up a bit. I did not add the tomatoes to the mix and instead added 2 cans of cream of celery and half a can of milk.Then I garnished with a little cheddar and tomato.  I don't usually add Italian spices to food and I must say it was delicious!

Wow. This is so unbelievably beige. Sure, it makes a metric ton of food on a small amount of ground beef so it's very economical, but it's nearly flavorless and, when you figure out a proper serving size, it doesn't really offer a lot of veggies per person. This is a great base, but I'm not going to be really annoying and give it a great review when this very obviously needs a lot of sprucing up to make a decent dish. I would recommend: More parmesan cheese and mixed through, not sprinkled on top; at least doubling all the spices but salt; more vegetables; adding perhaps fresh basil and halved grape tomatoes at the end and then, just before serving, drop in cubed fresh mozzarella and let it melt from just the heat of the macaroni.

Wonderful base recipe. I only made one change, I doubled the spices in the recipe! This is a great base recipe if you want to change up or add different things. Very happy with my turn out.

Delish!  Suprised how much flavor this had, i was afraid it might be a bit bland, but it was really very tasty.  i cut the recipe in 1/2, using only one lb. of meat.  it was indeed quite a bit of prep, but it turned out really good and far healthier than any box of processed "noodle helper".  My husband went for the hot sauce, but that is typical for him, and not a testiment to the flavor itself.  I'll make this again.

This was a tasty dish.  I did not have any carrots so I left them out.  I halved the recipe and it still made enough for 5 meals for me and my husband.  I thought it needed more spinach and my husband thought it needed less (heâ€™s not a big spinach fan). I hope to report later on how well it freezes.  This is not a fancy dish, but one that is filling and satisfying.

Great recipe. I added a little shredded Italian blend cheese to the beef mixture. Next time I think I will try some Ricotta cheese. Also a good way to get kids to eat their veggies!!

Yummy!  I halved the recipe and it still made a ton. I didn't have enough parmesean cheese so I grated a cup of cheddar too. I also topped my kids' bowls with marinara so they would eat it without whining!  It's just as good leftover too.  This recipe is a keeper.

Spinach Beef Macaroni Bake Haiku: "Nope, won't make again. Vegetables were too 'crunchy', too much pasta too." I drastically scaled the servings back to just feed my family, and also reduced the pasta because I'd rather get a mouthful of spinach than a starch, otherwise, didn't alter anything. The carrots and celery never got a chance to get beyond "al dente" so they provided a peculiar crunch to the finished product, whereas the pasta got overly-squishy after the recommended 25-30 min. We felt that mozzarella on top would've made more sense than parmesan, and we would've just added additional parmesan at the table. The seasonings were also way on the skimpy side and needed to be amped up significantly; overall taste was nothing extraordinary, and if I were to make it again, I would make too many changes for it to even qualify as this recipe anymore.

Surprisingly tasty! Since I didn't want a ton of food, I halved the recipe, and reduced ground beef to 0.5 lb and the macaroni to 1.5 cups.  Kept the full amount of the rest of the ingredients.

I received complements on this dish and was told to make it again!

I did alter the recipe to use ground turkey and used fresh spinach instead. With the cheese, I layered it in stages.
