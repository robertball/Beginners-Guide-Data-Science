I cooked the rice in my rice cooker, substituting some of the water for the pineapple juice in the can to give the rice a sweeter flavor, so it required little to no salt.
Also used chicken tenders because they cook up faster. 20 minutes and the whole meal was ready and delicious! Yum! :)
Be aware... the chickens flavor is quite strong.  My family liked it but I could see how it could be pretty strong for others.

Made this dish the other night for dinner and it was wonderful. The pineapple cilantro rice went well with the spicy carribean chicken. Served the chicken over the rice with a nice glass of moscato wine....the perfect meal! Felt like I had gone to a carribean restaurant to eat. 2 thumbs up!!

Very good!I grilled the chicken and I did reduce the spices (except for the brown sugar) by half and had just the right amount for three large chicken breasts. I also used the pineapple juice for part of the water for the rice and added sliced baby carrots. Good flavor--not too spicy or too sweet and very easy to make. Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved this dish. I was a little skeptical about the rice but it turned out lovely. The only thing that I would do different next time would be to back off on the amount of rub I put on the chicken. The spices were a little over-bearing for me.

I also used I bit more brown sugar as it seemed to be a bit strong in taste and I also cooked my rice in a rice steamer and used half pineapple juice and half water and it came out a bit too sticky. Over all the chicken was pretty good. Could be better with some tweaking tho.

My family loved this. This is dish is quite light, and the addition of the cilantro and pineapple to the rice makes it quite refreshing, especially on a hot summer night like tonight. Will definitely make again, though it's not our favorite dish, it's very easy, fresh, quick to prepare, cost effective, and light.

Quite delicious.  
The changes I made... sliced the chicken in half length wise, used extra hot chilli powder, cooked the rice with chicken stock and the reserve pineapple juice (about half cup) .
The quantity of the spice rub only covered 3.5. Chicken breasts.  
Will definitely make again.

My husband isn't a big fan of chicken, but I knew with my first bite, he would love this. My young girls also enjoyed it. The rice is a nice change and the chicken is extremely flavorful. My husband said he would eat this meal anytime. I 100% agree.

I did make changes and used chicken thighs in place of breasts.  The rub is wonderful, not too spicy and the rice was a nice compliment.  Will make it again.

Very good recipe. However, not enough seasoning in the rice for my taste.  I put some Creole seasoning and some of the pineapple juice in the rice.

Five stars! The chicken was flavorful, tender and juicy. Because the Costco boneless, skinless chicken breasts I used were HUGE, I had to adjust the cooking time, adding 10 minutes and finishing by basting with additional pineapple juice under the broiler.

My wife and I made this for the two of us so there was a lot of leftovers. We love spicy food so the amount of heat some here have noted was fine with us. 

The rice was excellent. There was plenty to go with both times we ate the chicken as our dinner. And then I re-purposed the remaining  chicken and rice in home-made burritos along with the usual onions and peppers, etc.

We will definitely make this again.

I made this for a large group---25+ people--so I did it in crockpots, and used thighs instead due to cost.  I did trim fat from the thigh meat, but then just rolled each piece of meat in the seasonings, and then placed in the crockpots for about 3 hours on high.  For ease in serving, I added crushed pineapple (in it's own juice) towards the end of cooking, and used corn starch to thicken the sauce for serving over oven baked rice (super easy for a large group).  Great reviews from everyone who ate it--and the smell while cooking was amazing!  Great recipe to adjust as needed for your needs!!  Thanks!

Thanks, KyleeJo06, but I did make changes as some suggested. I added pineapple juice to the rice, used brown rice and added sliced baby carrots. Had doubled the spices since I had 5 chicken breasts and 4 of them were large but didn't double the black pepper. Chicken cooked up juicy with nice flavor and liked the rice with the additions. I cooked pineapple pieces in a separate small fry pan with some brown sugar and cinnamon to serve on the side instead of on top. Very tasty and easy to prepare.

*I AM ONLY RATING THE RICE* Used the rice recipe to accompany some carribean marinated shrimp on the grill.  Had high hopes for the rice but it was just ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Will keep looking for a different carribean rice recipe for future use.

This is a fantastic recipe. It's a hit everytime I make this dish. No matter the occasion, and its so easy!! Now I use the spice mix on all kinds of meat, and they all turn out fantastically! Fish (Salmon especially), Turkey, Lamb, all of them taste so good with the spice mix in this recipe. Thanks Kylee!!

So delicious! I mixed all the spices, put the chicken in a large zip lock bag, added the spices to the chicken, shook the bag and let it sit overnight. The rice is delicious and compliments the chicken very well. Thank you for sharing such an easy, healthy & delicious meal!

The flavors were great, but the rice needed a little more WOW.  I added some butter, more pineapple and some s&p.  The chicken was tasty - I might put a little olive oil on it before the rub, or maybe more brown sugar - it was a dry rub, and didn’t glaze or crisp.  I will definitely be adding this to my menu list!

I actually want to give this a 4.5 rating, but system did not provide capability to rate on the half star. Very easy to make. The rice was flavorful. I'll probably make ity again.

This was good, not exceptional but good. I followed others suggestions and used 1/2 cup of the pineapple juice when making the rice (in a rice cooker). I also halved the herbs and spices which left plenty.

The chicken was good but not outstanding.  I dry brined it with the rub for 5 hours before grilling it on a charcoal grill.  The rice was better.  I added the minced garlic and a small can of drained crushed pineapple to the rice before steaming it in my rice cooker.  I also added the pineapple juice and chicken broth.

I was really surprised that I didn’t like this recipe. for all the spices and pineapple I felt it was bland and left a lot to be wanting. It’s actually been about 4 weeks since I made this recipe and it sticks out because it was disappointing. I will stick to the restaurants for my Caribbean cravings

Actually 5 stars from me and only 1 for my husband, so I split the difference.  I thought it was great, but the hubs ate 2 bites and said the pineapple was great. He does not like spicy foods, but I thought I'd try it anyway.   I guess this will be filed away for when he's not around.

Solid dish! I didn't have any chili powder so I used a little bit of white pepper, a pinch of cayenne, and some extra garlic powder . The chicken was delicious and super juicy (though I think I pulled it out a little bit before the suggested time, used a thermometer to check doneness). My favorite part of this dish was actually the rice...surprisingly delicious! Went well with the subtle heat of the chicken. In the future, just to satisfy my need for heat, I might use more cayenne/paprika to turn it up a notch or two on the scoville scale. 

I also served this with some bacon Brussels sprouts I made the night before, which paired well.

Loved the spice rub in chicken. Went a little easy on chilli powder as it was all I had. Taste was awesome. Chicken was moist and tender. I cheated and made Zatarains Caribbean rice and together an easy and flavorful meal for hubby and me!

Quick easy and delicious. I love this dish in the summer when I’m craving the beach. I add the leftover rub to the rice and use the juice drained from the pineapple mixed with the water to cook the rice in.

This is delicious! The chicken stayed juicy.  I did cut back a little on the black pepper and the flavor was medium spicy, just the way we like it.   I used fresh pineapple, instead of canned and added a small handful of canned black beans to the rice mixture.  My husband and I loved it!

There was a lot of spice of the chicken and it felt like you were eating spices. The second time I made it I cooked the chicken with pineapple juice in the bottom and that made it a lot better I also drizzled more juice over it when I served it.

I checked it at 30 minutes, nowhere near done. 45 minutes STILL NOT DONE. Is it because the breasts are crowded together in this 9 inch pan? Should I have used a cookie sheet?

Super easy and did not disappoint at all!  Used chicken thighs(skin on, but cut off excess fat). Marinated them in half and half, chicken stock, 1 heaping Tblsp minced/marinated garlic. Pat dry with paper towels. Rub dry mixture on both sides but under the skin as well.  Cooked it on the grill with sliced onion, and pineapple rings. Cooked slow for char and tenderness. Add sliced scallions to top of chicken.

It was amazing. I would have to dial back the rub a bit for 2 chicken breast instead of 4, but the rest can easily be put away for another day.

The rice was good.  The seasoning mix for the chicken did not taste right.  It was similar to blackening seasoning, but not quite.  You could not taste the brown sugar at all.  It needed more salt too.

This recipe had good flavor but it was a little too spicy for our taste. Next time I’ll use less chili powder and pepper. It made quick easy dinner and served with a salad the clean up was also easy

Did everything pretty much exactly as it says. Only difference was added some pineapple juice to the rice water. The rice was very plain, I would recommend adding a ton of pineapples to the rice. The chicken was pretty good, cant say amazing. Will probably make the chicken again, just find a different pairing. Thanks

I liked this, and I made it just like the recipe called but ... I thought that there would be to much Cumin and not enough salt ... I was right.... so the next time and there will be a next time some changes... I want to grill the chicken, and to use thighs, not breasts as they dried out...also the rice should be just plain, made with salt, pepper, parsley (not cilantro, to bitter), and butter.  And to use pineapple tidbits more pineapple flavor.

Very flavorful dish. I took the suggestion of some of the reviews and cooked the rice in half water, half pineapple juice. The family really liked it so we will add this in to our dinner rotation.

I had to cook it about 50 minutes total because a few of my chicken breast pieces were too chunky.  My fault.  Make sure they are uniform and not big clompy pieces.  Otherwise it was  great as well as the cilantro pineapple rice.  Thanks for this one.

I made the chicken only.  The pineapple cilantro rice did not sound appetizing to me.

I followed the recipe exactly. No substitutions and the chicken is delicious.  I will definitely make the chicken again.

easy, light and really tasty.  The only reason someone might not like this is if you don't like cilantro.  Otherwise, a great summer dinner.  We did use coconut water for half the rice cooking water and grilled the chicken. But even as written, this is a good meal!

This was nice and easy after a long day. The only changes I made were to use stock instead of water for the rice, used 2c of stock instead of 1.5 (I always do rice at a 2:1 ratio), and I added all of the pineapple to the rice instead of saving some to garnish.

Feels like something was missing for me in this recipe. It wasn’t bad but I feel as if it was just not all the way there. I may try again but with a little this and a little that to see if I can get that thing I’m missing.

Everyone loved the chicken! I halved all of the spices but left the full amount of brown sugar as others suggested. I also broiled the chicken. It results in a nice juicy chicken and the rub made a beautiful crust. The spices hit your taste buds  first and then there’s this fabulous sweetness that comes after. It’s really REALLY good. I loved the rice as well but my daughter and husband weren’t fans. But, then again I love Pineapple on pizza so it’s just one of those things you’ll either really like or think it’s blah.

The rice was awesome. I added more pineapples than called for and a lot more salt.  The chicken was just ok. Admittedly, I don’t like cumin so I was skeptical to start with.  I think it needed some jerk sauce or something to blend the flavors. Disappointed except for the rice.

Chicken came out very good after I doctored the rub a bit. The thyme overpowers everything. Next time I will leave it out, as I needed 2X the brown sugar to compensate for it. Crushed pineapple is easier. A good starter recipe, one that I will play with in the future.

We loved it. I also added the pineapple juice to the rice while cooking. I added chopped up mango, some butter and a little brown sugar along with the chopped pineapple. I left out the cilantro. My husband loved it.

I made this almost exactly as the recipe calls.  The only change was to use the excess pineapple juice in cooking the rice.  My wife and I loved it

Love, love, loved this recipe! I don’t cook with garlic salt, so used garlic powder and fresh ground sea salt in equal measures instead. The chicken was awesomely spicy (made my nose run) and the rice was extremely flavorful and a bit sweet, contrasting nicely with the spicy chicken. Like someone else said, it was like taking a break and having dinner in the Caribbean!!  Will definitely cook this again!

This was really good! I left out the nutmeg only because I didn’t have any. Cooked the rice in my rice cooker and substituted one cup of the water with the pineapple juice. Next time I will add fresh jalapeños to the rice!

Looking for a tropical themed meal for an event at church and tried this first at home. I used  chicken tenders instead of breast so only baked it for 20 minutes. The rub was very good but I did eliminate the nutmeg and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt . It was very good and I am planning on using this . Thank you Allrecipes for the ability to multiply the servings ,saves me a lot of headaches

Wow, I loved the flavors in this. I used up all the rub on 2 large breasts; really coated them well. My husband shies away from anything sweet but he didn't notice the brown sugar in the rub. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was quite juicy inside the coating. The rice was so bright and fresh, and the cilantro, garlic salt & pepper blended so well with the pineapple and it wasn't too sweet. Will make this again for sure!

The family loved this recipe, it is a keeper for sure. The one and only thing I did different is substitute parsley for the cilantro because one in the family doesn't like the taste. It was great with some sweet corn and Hawaiian bread.

We enjoyed the spice rub on the chicken. I used grated cauliflower instead of rice made with coconut milk. Added the pineapple and some jalapeño pepper. Great meal.

Wow! I love Caribbean food and honestly this may be the best chicken recipe I have had. It is not the Americanized sweet stuff. It has a complex, dirty, spicy taste. It is kinda hot. So, I do get why everyone might not love it but I do! I like my own rice and peas recipe and prefer coconut milk to pineapple juice. But pineapples and cilantro as garnish are great. I also like a healthy shot of Pickapeppa Sauce on the top to finish it off.  One thing I did a little different and thought was a good addition was to cut some slits into the chicken breasts and rubbing the spices into the slits before cooking. Anyway, ...its soooo easy and fast to make.. There is no reason not to try it.

It is very delicious, the family loved it, but found the rice a little dry without a sauce. Next time I will prepare a tomato based sauce with the pineapple and spice mixture leftovers.

This dish is amazing! I've even substituted flank steak for the chicken and I'm not sure which is better. I also recommend using fresh pineapple instead of canned.

This was refreshing & delicious, as well as quick & easy to make. Fortunately, I had all ingredients on hand, Except for Thyme. & I'm sure it would have been good with it as well. I had a 20 oz can of pineapple chunks. I was able to get 1cup of pineapple juice from it & added 1/2 cup water for the rice. I only used 8 oz of the pineapple chunks, as listed. But I'm sure you could add more to your liking. The rice was so delicious with the use of pineapple juice & cooked perfectly in 20 minutes. I enjoyed the chili powder combined with the brown sugar on the chicken. The chili powder may be too much for some tastes but my family enjoyed it. I would reduce it a bit if you don't like any kind of heat. I just realized I forgot to add the oil to the rice at the end. It turned out fine without it. Will definitely be making again.

Oh my gosh.  I made this tonight and all four of my kids gobbled it up.  At the last minute, I realized I didn't have the pineapple, so I took a chance and added canned strawberries instead.  It was a hit!

This dish was ok but a bit to spicy for most of my family. The first day it was ok the second day we could barely eat the chicken it was extremely hot to taste. If you love hot/spicy food then would a dish you will enjoy.

I made this exactly as written. My husband, who really likes spicy foods, loved this one. The pineapple and cilantro rice was a nice complement to the spicy chicken. Definitely a keeper and will become a regular at our house. Highly recommend this one.

This was really good! The flavor of the rice and chicken blended very well. I decided to cook the rice in chicken stock with pepper and garlic and then added pineapple and cilantro as stated. I also served with baked garlic sweet potatoes and red bell peppers.

This dish was a bit spicy for my 6 yr old ds.  I will make it again, but will cut the "hot" spices to 1/2 a tap.  The only change I made was to put some pineapple juice in with the rice as it cooked.  Yum!   As for me, I thought the dish was delicious!

Fantastic! For the people who said this was inedible you are either not used to cooking with Cumin and/or Nutmeg. However, if you have cooked recipes using these spices be careful as to how much you use

It was good.  Add pineapple juice for part of the water for extra flavoring.

I made it pretty much as written. There was a little too much black pepper for my kids, so if I make it again I'll  half the black pepper. Otherwise everyone like it. The rice was a big hit.

Good but not great. The rice was a bit bland and chicken was quite spicey. the pineapple to me didn't blend well with the dish. it seemed it was just there. it didn't enhance any flavors to me. I even tried adding more chunks and juice, but that did not help.
