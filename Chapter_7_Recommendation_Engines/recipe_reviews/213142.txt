Very good.  I like barbecue flavored chicken but don't care for shredded barbecue chicken....this is perfect.  A bit of different flavor with the addition of ginger.  I served this with rice and a veggie...a keeper.

This recipe has potential.  It reminds me very much of my cola chicken recipe i use.....i found the amout of cider vinegar VERY overpowering i would reduce it to about 1/4 cup.....and probably decrease the brown sugar as well.....theres lots of sweet in the ketchup.  Some other liquid would need to be added though.....it would be too thick otherwise.  Maybe just some chicken broth.  It has potential...but need some major tweaking.  The acidity was too high.

I LOVED this recipe!  So fresh and tangy with ingredients everyone has on hand.  I can see how some might think the vinegar is too strong, but I personally loved the tanginess of this dish.  It would be easy to reduce the amt. of vinegar to one's taste. I would definitely recommend this dish and will be making it often. :)

This was not good. The smell in my house was over powering, the taste also. My husband refused to even try it.  I am sorry, maybe it just isn't for everyone.

Must have done something wrong. It has an overpowering smell from the vinegar and overpowering taste. Cant put this one on my family again.

We really liked this dish. Sweet and sour is nicely balanced in the abundant sauce. I used skinless, bone-in chicken thighs, and threw some broccoli over the top for the last 10 minutes. Next time I will add even more vegetables.
