I used this on chocolate cookies with peanut butter chips.
You have to vary the water and sugar based on how thick you want it. 
It turns out great!

Delicious glaze - this was perfect for Peanut Butter Bread by Nola Laughery from this site.  I used chunky peanut butter and a little smooth.  I like this because you can control the consistency by how much of each of the ingredients you use in fact I didn't measure a thing!

I used with the Guilt-Free Chocolate Cake that is also on this website. No one believed that the cake was "diet!"

Perfect. I used about 8 teaspoons of water and a tablespoon and a half of peanut butter. This gave me a rich flavor and a thinner consistency to use for drizzling. Thanks! :)

Too thin for a cake, which is what I wanted it for. It separated a bit and soaked in rather than staying on top. Still yummy though!

This was absolutely delicious! I was having trouble getting mine to drizzle. It may have been the brand peanut butter. So, I added a few drops of water and it was fine. After I did that I realized that I could get drizzle type lines more likely by piping it on with a pastry tip slowly. I will do that next time. Either way also make sure whatever you are drizzling it on is completely cool, because it will melt some if not. I will definitely try this on some other desserts and with the other technique. Thank you submitter!

I used this recipe to top my rice crispy granola bars, and it turned out very well.  If the glaze is too thin or separates, you can easily adjust the sugar or peanut butter to make it a little thicker.  It tasted great!

I only give this 3 stars because when you follow the recipe as written, it is way too thick to drizzle, and the recipe needs to be adjusted.  However, I love the concept of it!  I added more water to thin it out, and more peanut butter to give it more peanut butter flavor - and it was the perfect thing to drizzle over our chocolate cake!!  YUM!!

YUM! I made this for the frosted banana bars from this site instead of the frosting from that recipe. Very good. It's just the right amount of peanut butter. I would have this over frosting any day.

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe! I have never thought of making a delicious peanut butter glaze by this simple method. The thickness of the glaze can be easily adjusted by adding more/less water and peanut butter. I used an extra crunchy peanut butter and it turned out to be even more amazing!! I will certainly keep this recipe, cheers!

I think a better title for this recipe would just be "easy peanut butter frosting" because made as is, it's not really what you would picture a glaze being. I was actually looking for a PB frosting recipe, but didn't want to use a cup of PB and a stick of butter and blah blah. This seemed easy, and it came out perfectly, I used it to ice chocolate cookies, but this could work for anything! Easy to adjust to whatever consistency you'd like it to be. The only thing I'm worried about is how easy it is to make, this will not be good for my willpower.

Awesome, simple glaze.  I doubled the peanut butter for a slightly thicker glaze.  I used it to top peanut butter rolls with the dough from the "Clone of a Cinnabon" recipe on AllRecipes.

Not thin enough to drizzle. I had to add a ton more water to the mix so that it would cooperate.

YUMM!!!!!! great over brownies. More like a frosting than glaze because of the solid fat(peanut butter) which is normally lacking in a glaze,which is exactly what I wanted. Thank you!

Super easy and delicious. I needed a quick cupcake frosting idea and this was less than five minutes to mix and ice. I doubled the PB since I love it. This also gave it a thicker texture. Then I scooped it into a plastic bag, cut the tip off, and piped it onto the chocolate cupcakes. Lastly, I drizzled melted chocolate over the "glaze". The best cupcakes ever!

Need to alter the measurements a little to fit your own taste (I thought it needed more peanut butter and less sugar). I also added just a touch of vanilla.

This is wonderful! I used it on peanut butter brownies and I also used a chocolate glaze and criss crossed the two glazes, outstanding!

This stuff is amazing. You could put this on an old shoe and it would taste good. I used it to glaze Double Chocolate Brownie Cake from this site. The glaze was the best part of the cake. I can't wait to use it on cookies or muffins.

it tasted great but was too thick to drizzle so I used the double boiler techneec and its were you take some boiling water and you put a glass bowl over it and it just melts right away without burning it but u have to keep stirring it unless u want clumpy glaze

Very yummy ICING. You would REALLY have to tweak it to make it the consistency of a glaze. Tasted good and worked great for Cocoa Banana Bars (also on this site).

I added more peanut butter and a bit more sugar to make a thicker consistency - tasted like a gooey version of the inside of a peanut butter cup! I put on like frosting on chocolate cupcakes, next time I'm making cookie sandwiches with this! Delicious 3 ingredient recipe, doesn't get any easier.

Love this! I needed it a little thicker for a drizzle on cupcakes. Just added a little more peanut butter and it was perfect. Will use this often. Thanks for sharing!

Perfect! Easy... and makes an excellent drizzle for any baked treats! I don't know that I followed the amounts to a "T" but I added more or less of each until I reached the desired consistency for drizzling over my cookies!

FANTASTIC!!  This was so easy to put together and depending on the consistency you require, you can easily adjust your water/sugar!  I drizzled this over Double Chocolate Brownie Cake and it was awesome!  Chocolate and peanut butter, need I say more?!!!

My son (age 9) made this to go on top of the Banana Loaf Cake I, from this site, tonight and it is amazing! It is not intended to frost a cake! It is supposed to be a glaze, or an icing. It is perfect! 
My son says "It is the best icing. Use Hampton Farms peanut butter."

Yummo! It does turn out a little thin so I just added more powdered sugar and pb until I got to the flavor and consistency I wanted(probably 1 cup powered sugar, 2tbls pb and 4 tbls water). Put it on top of some banana cupcakes I made to use up some ripe bananas. Wow! So good! Thanks for the recipe

Was okay when following the directions perfectly. I personally added 3 more tablespoons of peanut butter and splashes of water to thin it out a little, not to the point of drizzling though (was worried I’d thin it out too. Popped in the microwave for 15 seconds to thin out right before

Love the concept, but I like it better with more peanut butter and less powdered sugar.
