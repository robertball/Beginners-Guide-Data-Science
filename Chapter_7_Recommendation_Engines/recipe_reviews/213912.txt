This was the best chili mac recipe I have ever made. Although I had to "rearrange" a few things because I just didnt have them in my cupboard! The only thing I lacked was a can of the Mexican stewed tomatoes and I had a can of regular, and I also added a can of chili beans, yummy!! Didn't have quite enough cups of cheese so I had slices of real Kraft cheese. Very creamy, not dry, very yummy with homemade bread a salad!

Needed to use up some leftover spaghetti so followed recipe except left out the bell pepper and used chopped canned tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano, and poured over the spaghetti.  Husband loved it and thought it was as good as served by one of our local chain restaurants.  Will definitely add this to his "favorites" list.  Thanks for the post!

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe called for the first time through and we really enjoyed it. It was quick and easy to throw together. This is a great recipe to build on, you could add beans, corn, jalapenos, among other things to suit your personal taste. I will definitely make this again.

Can't quite see why you need to bake it for 30 min. Everything is already cooked before you place it in the oven.All you need to do is melt the cheese which can be done in 10-12 min.instead of 30.Baking it for 30 min dries it out.

This recipe was actually good there are some suggestions that I would probably change about it  such as instead of 1LB of Ground Beef I used 2LBS to give it more substance and I also added 2 packages of Taco Seasoning to bring out more flavor since more meat was added. I think its also best to mention the fact that the macaroni should be cooked while the ground beef is browning. Because this was not mentioned in the beginning it extended my prep time by 10 minutes.

Followed the recipe but ended up adding tortilla chips on top and in total about 3 cups of cheese (2 cups on the very top). Also put some sour cream on it as well. Made it more like a taco mac versus a chili mac this way.

I gave this recipe only 3 stars for two reasons.  First, you need more tomatoes.  Second, if you are going to use a packaged mix, go with chili rather than taco.  I prefer to do this with my own cumin, cayenne and a couple of diced jalapenos.  Good basic recipe though.

I'm going to give this 5 stars for one main reason - This feeds my family of 4 (two adults, two young children) for 2 nights, plus 2 lunches for my husband and myself. It tastes great and the kids eat it up! This is wonderful for those extra busy days/evenings. Thank you!

We really enjoyed this meal. After reading some reviews, I made a few changes, which really made this meal outstanding.  The changes I made were to use corkscrew pasta, I used 1 and a half cans of the tomatoes,  added a small can of diced green chile, seasoned with Lawrys seasoning salt (found it was too bland without it), and I used more cheese.  Also, make sure to cook your pasta al dente or it might get mushy since you are also cooking it more in the oven. Since all of the ingredients are already cooked when you put everything together, I baked at 375 covered for 10 minutes, then uncovered for an additional 5.  Served with sour cream. It was delicious and made amazing leftovers!

I am making this right now. But I added fresh tomatoes and zucchini. Also put taco chips on top before I put it in the oven and added lots of cheese. Served with sour cream too.

As always, I tried this recipe as is beforehand. It was really good, and with three people eating it, there ended up being no leftovers. Since the first time, the only change I made was adding more cheese to it, as the roommates really enjoy the extra cheesiness. It has become a staple and we have it pretty often as it is super easy to make.

I made just as directions said to. Was delicious! Not as great for cold lunch the next day, but I'll be making again! I ended up with more than the 11" x 7" pan.

I had some leftover homemade turkey chili, and I was looking for an easy Chili Mac recipe with high ratings. This one seemed like exactly what I was looking for, and it was. I had about 3 cups of leftover chili, so I used it along with half the amounts of macaroni and cheese called for in the recipe. I followed step 2 exactly, spooning half of the mixture in the dish and topping with half the cheese, and then adding the rest of the mixture. I baked it for 30 minutes covered and then added the remaining cheese and baked 5 more minutes. For a smaller batch, I probably should have put it in a smaller pan, such as a loaf pan. However, it was fine as prepared. I would echo the comments of a couple of reviewers that it could have used a little more cheese. That's a personal preference, though. I imagine that it would even be delicious with your favorite canned chili if you were pressed for time.

This is some terrific stuff, particularly if you have kids. My 7-year-old ate it up, as did my hubby and I. Great for leftovers, too. This one's going in my permanent files!

I thought it was okay, a little drier than I expected. But we ate it last night and tonight will reheat the leftovers with another can of tomatoes to see what happens.

Everyone loved this simple but tasty recipe ( adults, teens, & tweens)! I used Jumbo Ridged Macaroni (which holds its shape when stirred into in hearty dishes), mild McCormick taco seasoning,  mild Rotel tomatoes, and Mexican blend shredded cheese. The "extras" I added were a sprinkle of  Fiesta Ranch dry mix, & a can of store brand chili with beans. I added these just in case it wasn't flavorful enough as written, as I'd used an extra 1/2 pound of meat & doubled the noodles  to be sure there was enough for a sleepover guest. I think it would have been just as good the original way though, & I feel it could also allow for substitutions/experiments when desired. We also ate crushed tortilla chips with it, yum! Fast n' easy! Thanks for the recipe. :-)

Oh my goodness, this was fabulous!  My 8 year old, who is very picky, gave this a very enthusiastic thumbs up!  He doesn't like onions so I used 1tsp onion powder instead.  I also made homemade taco seasoning from this website, and it was a little spicy for my son but nothing a little sour cream couldn't help!  I very much recommend this recipe, especially for kids!

Very delicious, very easy. Had left over noodles from when I made too much spaghetti. Added chili beans to the recipe and took out the pepper. Since everything was still hot from being simmered I only cooked for 25 min and put the top layer of cheese on before placing in the oven. I will for sure be trying again and again.

This was very good and simple for a weeknight.  I used a homemade taco seasoning that I found on allrecipes and a mixture of grassfed beef and venison, so this was a healthy recipe.

Many years ago I had an aunt who made this and I fell in love with it.  Then I joined the Navy and this was a regular item on the menu and was often served for mid rats while at sea.  I was reminded of Chili Mac on a FB Navy Vets page and decided to make it.  To my knowledge I have never made Chili Mac so this was my first try.  I found it to be very easy and fast enough to make and I followed the recipe for the most part with the exception of adding about a tablespoon of chili powder to make the dish less bland.  In addition I only cooked it for 15 minutes to brown which is more than enough since everything is already cooked.  I will definitely make this one more frequently since it has leftovers worth eating again.

It was good, and easy. my son really liked it, my husband gobbled up two bowls before I was half way through my first, but I don't think I'd make it again.

This is a really good recipe.  I didn't have diced tomatoes so I used a canof tomato paste with 14.5 ounces of water.  I also substituted the onions and green pepper with Pictsweet seasoning blend which contained onions Green peppers and celery.  The only thing I would change about this recipe is the amount of recommended cheese.  I would suggest using 1cup of cheese to start.  Also I seasoned with salt and pepper.

I doubled this recipe but forgot to double the tomatoes and it still came out great!  I served this dish with a salad and had chopped tomatoes and scallions on the side. My husband added the tomatoes and scallions on top of the chili mac and it was even better!!! I did add a little pasta water to moisten.

I did not have the ground beef, but I did have canned chili with beans, which I used instead of making the ground beef mixture. The beans served to make the meal more substantial and added some extra protein. I also added some leftover black olives from an Italian dinner a few days ago. I garnished a serving with a dollop of sour cream on top, a few slices of jalepeno, and additional sliced black olives. It was a good "pulled outta thin air" dinner.

Wonderful recipe. I did a couple of changes. I didn’t use stewed tomatoes or green pepper. I used diced tomatoes with green chili’s. I also add corn and pinto beans. It came out great! Thank you for posting!!

I left off the cheese (not a big fan of cheese).
I added about 1 Tbs of chili powder.
It was a little dry, but still very tasty.
My next batch (next weekend) will include one bottle of Heinz Chili Sauce.

I love Chili Mac, so this simple recipe works great.  My youngest son loved it (hates green / red peppers, chunk tomato, etc), and scarfed it down without a thought after I told him the ingredients.

I essentially wanted to make a thicker chili with some mac and cheese in the mix. This was not that. This was glorified hamburger helper. I followed almost everything to a T. The only changes I made were the recommendations about cook time. Covered for 10 minutes, uncovered for 5. Other than that, as per the rest of the recipe it tastes absolutely nothing like chili. The taco seasoning throws everything off. It doesn't even taste like taco-y goodness. There wasn't enough sauce to cover everything right. Shredded cheese did nothing to help what so ever. I'm probably mostly disappointed by the fact that this wasn't what I thought or hoped it would be.

Mine was a bit dry, maybe liquid from tomatoes and 1/2 cup water was not enough. Foil was tight for baking. Perhaps 2 splashes of canned tomato juice next time.
I added just under a half of a serano pepper into the skillet for a pleasant sting.
Overall, a good recipe

I forgot to add something to my review that might help others.  I cooked the entire thing in my large, oven proof skillet.  I didn't layer the cheese.  Instead, I just "poked" some down into the mac/meat mixture in a few places and then spread most of it over the top.  Covered with the skillet lid, and cooked.  Essentially a one pot dinner - except for the pasta pot.

Very good and easy, but I had to make a few changes to accommodate what was in my pantry.   I only used one can of beans, and plain canned diced tomatoes.  I added a dash of chili powder to compensate.  I also added a can of water and cooked  the macaroni right in the same pot for 30 min.   Topped with some tortilla strips and hubby loved it.

Excellent dish.  I agree with the comment that recommends only baking 10-12 minutes, it really comes out perfect that way.  If you really want to make it good, sub chili seasoning for taco seasoning and use sharp cheddar.

I used ground beef,  1 can of hot Rotel chili and tomatoes and added 2 tbsp of diced jalapenos. (we like spicy!) I left the mixture in the pot and added the cheese and it melted while it rested. It was delicious and I will make it again. Thank you!

This dish was awesome and simple to make. I just had a 1 oz packet of taco seasoning and just added 2oz of chili powder(essentially the same minus the garlic powder, etc). Will definitely make this again and I might add some sour cream in with the stewed tomatoes or simply just add a dollop or two when ready to eat. Great recipe and absolutely delicious.

This is so good. I plan to make it for a family cook out for Father's Day. The only thing I changed was I used just plain tomatoes in a can. I didn't have the Mexican style on hand at the time. The plain worked just fine.

This is quite good.  As others had to, I improvised items from my pantry when exact items weren't available.  I used 2 - 10.5 oz cans rotel and added 1/2 can tomato paste to get a good consistency.  I used mild cheddar cheese and added 4 slices of provolone in the middle section for extra cheesiness.  We liked it.

Very good!  The taco seasoning is the ticket (I made a version from allrecipes).  I cut the cheese in half because I got tired of grating, but it is necessary to thicken the sauce.  I think some of the confusion about “not enough sauce or makes a lot” comes from the 2 cups COOKED pasta—that’s 1 cup uncooked or 1/2 a package or less of pasta (I used half a box—8 oz).  I wish I doubled the recipe because there is less than one serving leftover between my husband and I!

I used regular diced tomatoes plus a can of chili with beans plus about 1/2 can water.  I like spicy so added chili powder, cumin and paprika to taste.  Yummy!

This dish is really good! I had about 2 C of pinto beans in the frig so added them in too. Substituted Rotel tomatoes with peppers & one can of tomato sauce since we were out of regular canned tomatoes. Hubby loved it!

Made this tonight with brown rice macaroni, Rotel tomatoes, can chili beans. Instead of taco seasoning I used cumin, garlic powder/salt, chili powder and a few shakes of Joe's Stuff (New Orleans seasoning). didn't use as much cheese as everyone else, used less. Baked in oven for 20 mins. I'll be making this again.

It was good. Next time I will season the meat in the soffrito, it was a little bland. The saving grace was the fact that I am not a cheese sprinkler, I'm a cheese piler.

Delicious!  Was a hit with the entire family!  I randomly thought to look this recipe up and luckily had all the ingredients on hand.  I did make my own taco seasoning, added a little more chili powder and emptied a can of tomato paste to give it a thicker consistency.  It was a hit!

I did alter the recipe a bit as I doubled the recipe .  I was concerned the casserole might get dry.  I used 2 cans  (14.5 oz) of diced chili-seasoned tomatoes, 1 can (10 oz) of diced tomatoes with green chiles and one can (14.5 oz) of Mexican-stewed tomatoes.  The grandkids LOVED it!  We will definitely make this again!

Tasty. I recommend cooking macaroni al dente otherwise it turns mushy. I added my own touches, as most folks noted in the comments. I also made it in my cast iron skillet, just topped with cheese and threw it in the oven uncovered for 30 min.

This was very dry. Not enough sauce and quite bland. For flavor I added black pepper, and garlic powder. I would have doubled the sauce but was in a hurry so I added a can of tomato sauce and a can of pintos. Will look for another recipe.

I added a pinch of salt and two (2) tablespoons of Sugar.
and 1/2 a cup of spaghetti sauce as the meat seemed a bit dry.

I made this and the family really enjoyed it. I did have to make some small changes due to what supplies I had on hand and not cooking the pasta ahead of time. I used fire roasted salsa style diced tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes. I also added one extra cup of water to the mixture, because I just added the pasta uncooked to the mixture and still baked it for the same amount of time. The pasta came out cooked perfectly fine.

Baking time can be shorter if you cook the onion and bell pepper until soft before adding taco seasoning and tomatoes. Otherwise, great recipe.

This was good, but I wanted to spice it up a bit. I added a 4oz can of diced chilies along with a can of rotel diced tomatoes and  green chiles and a bit of frozen corn. I used ground turkey and only drained it partially, using the moisture and not adding extra water.

It was Ok. Not the best chili mac recipe. The water seemed to take away most of the flavor which made it a little bland and for some reason a weird aftertaste. I think the juice from the tomatoes would be enough liquid for the seasoning package.

I tried this recipe but changed servings to 16. Recipe was  confusing. I didn't use 4 cups of cheese. It says in the recipe to sprinkle 1 cup cheese and top of first layer. Then over remaining meat mixture. Well, if it takes 4 cups of cheese how could you only use 1 cup on the first layer?? I baked 30 minutes and added more cheese to top but not using anywhere close to 4 cups of cheese. Made it for my Bunco group and there are 16 of them so we'll see what they have to say. Will stick with 6 serving recipe next time.

This is a great and easy recipe, I used wheat penne macaroni, ground turkey, Italian stewed tomatoes and added 6oz of tomato paste with a 1/4 cup extra water.   I like to make this on Monday and eat it for the next three days.

This was very easy to make. I was able to use ingredients from my pantry. I even added 1/2 a jar of spaghetti sauce that I had left in the fridge. My boys loved it!!! Will definately make again!!!!!

I wish you could give half-stars because I would really rate this a 4.5. I always view the reviews before I try something and given the mixed ones for this particular recipe I didn't have high hopes...BOY WAS I SURPRISED I made the recipe as written (with the exception of using regular stewed tomatoes because I couldn't find "mexican" stewed ones) and it was VERY TASTY and I will definitely be making it again. However next time, I will probably use Rotel diced tomatoes and green chili's mainly because I didn't like big chunks of stewed tomatoes (I tried chopping them smaller but they were still to big for my liking) and I like my food spicy. The only thing I noticed was a 11 x 17 pan was a bit to big so I used a smaller 9" inch square pan and it was just right.

This was far better than I expected it to be. I didn't have Mexican or chili stewed tomatoes, I only had regular stewed tomatoes, so to compensate, I added a half cup of salsa and almost a tablespoon of chili powder. Also added a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce for added flavor. I let it simmer for close to an hour before adding the elbow macaroni. I followed everything else exactly. I will make this again, everyone loved it.

Found a recipe the kiddos will happily eat, minus the bell pepper and plus some minced garlic.

This was delicious but I was missing ingredients and made adjustments. I did not have Mexican or chili style stewed tomatoes, just plain, and I did not have packaged taco seasoning. It also seemed a little dry so I added about a half cup of salsa, a Tbsp chili powder, pinch of cumin, and half tsp garlic powder. I added about 1/2 cup more cheese and used 1.25 lbs ground beef. The salsa (I used hot) made it extra spicy so go with medium or mild for a more tame version. I will definitely make this again!  This comfortably served my family of four with leftovers for lunch.

Very tasty, next time I make this I'll definitely be doubling the cheese and maybe adding a little sour cream to the mix. Or at least set it out on the table for anyone that would like to top their plate with some.

I enjoyed this recipe. I used an already seasoned lean ground turkey. And the health food store that I shop didn't have chili-style stewed tomatoes so I seasoned the tomatoes myself. I think next time though I will add beans to it.
