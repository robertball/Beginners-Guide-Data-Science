Ride on the sugar train! I saw 1 cup of honey and thought holy mother of sweetness honey is quite a but sweeter than sugar so I don't know how unbearable it would be had I used the full cup. I did 1\2 cup honey plus 3 tbsp brown sugar for a molasses-y flavor and the were still very very sweet. It's still not healthy to be eating so much sugar even if it is unprocessed. Other than that the cookie was good. I didn't have ground flax only whole; so to offset the binding effect I used 1 whole egg plus 1\4 cup cornstarch. I lowered the cinnamon since I'm not a big fan, and used cranberries and almonds in half the batch and the other half I used chocolate chips.
I'll probably make again and lower the honey further. It's a good starter recipe for a somewhat healthy breakfast cookie.

It's like homemade granola bars!  Very tasty, easy to make, and mine turned out nice and chewy - hoping my kids will like them in their school lunches.  I made 2 slight modifications, I used two whole eggs (not just the whites), and used Sunflower Seed Butter instead of almond butter, since it's all I had, oh and I threw in a tablespoon or two of hemp and millet as I figured it would work will with the granola!   I really like the taste of these, if my kids do too, I'll make them again and maybe even in the shape of a granola bar for a bigger snack portion.

These are nice and chewy, lightly sweet, and quick and easy to make. I think I'd like them with dried fruit, too.

These cookies were so dang delicious! My whole family, including two toddlers, were begging for more. The only change I made was using one whole egg instead of two egg whites, because I only had so many on hand. Thank you so much for a healthy COOKIE option, Sadie!

Yuck. These cookies did NOT turn out well. The honey was so overpowering even though I used 3/4 cup instead of the full cup. They were somehow bitter and way too sweet at the same time! I am always experimenting with healthy cookie recipes, and I have found some good ones. Rarely is there a recipe I make that I hate, but this is one of those few.

The taste was really good. They are a littke soft but tasty.  Maybe its because i didnt add nuts,  I didnt have any.  I added raisons instead of the chocolate chips. I did like the raisons in them but next time I will cut down on the honey because of the sweetness of the raisons.  I added a mixed nut butter instead of the other because thats all I had.  I will make again.

Good consistency I used  dark chocolate chips & raisins both only 1/4 cup, Not a lot of flavor but they are good for being 'clean'. I added a bit more cinnamon in hopes to gain flavor. May try reducing the honey & add a couple tablespoons brown sugar. Worth working with to make it what your family enjoys!

I made a batch of these today!  I'm not much of a breakfast eater, but I know it's important to eat something to start the day.  These will work nicely with a hot cup of coffee or tea!  Like an oatmeal cookie, not too sweet.  I used chopped almonds and cherry infused craisins.

I'll be making lots of these!  I do think 1 cup of honey was a bit much, so I will experiment using a little less.  Excellent recipe.

Super moist and very delicious. Play around with what you add, raisins, dried cranberries with walnuts. Itâ€™s a good base with all of these and it keeps it fresh to try with different flavors!

The cookies are taste good and are very easy to make sure my kid gets a breakfast before the 7:00 AM bus picks him up.
I used chunky peanut butter instead of almond butter. My wife and son think the cookies are great considering they are not a dessert cookie.
Thank you for the recipe.

So how did you get them to look like the photo? They look nice and flat like a cookie should; but mine were as round as when I dropped them on the pan with the cookie scoop!!

Not for me... NO flavor, dry, and definitely not a "cookie".

Both of my toddlers ate these! They turned out really good. I did 325 for 8 mins and they were chewy! I didnt have a whol cup of honey(I dropped the first cup on my floor??) but they were still plenty sweet! I added a little more cinnamon because we love it and a little more flax because of the fiber! All in all I will make these again!

turned out very sticky.  Had to add a LOT more flour. I also used a lot less honey, and they were still sweet.  It made for a very sticky cookie, I think b/c there was no oil in it.  It got stuck to the parchment paper.

This was very good. It was a bit chewy, but after you get used to that it is good.
