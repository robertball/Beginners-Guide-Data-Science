We love this recipe. It's extremely easy to double and works just as well, so we usually make a double batch and put one pizza in the freezer to eat sometime later. We find this recipe to be equal to any typical rise-then-punch-then-rise crust we've made, and far superior to any frozen or refrigerated store-bought pizza crust.

I usually add mixed herbs to the dough - I sometimes just do a teaspoon of ground-up "pizza spice" but if I don't have pizza spice on hand I'll just toss in a mixture of approx 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp oregano, and 1/4 tsp onion powder. (The best and easiest way to add herbs is to mix them into the olive oil before you add it to the batter - that will ensure even distribution throughout the entire dough.) Then I mix a bit of garlic powder (about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp) into the olive oil that I brush onto the edge of the crust, which gives it a touch of garlicky flavor and helps the edge turn nice and golden in the oven.

Added later: I've also used this recipe to make breadsticks; I still add the herbs and garlic oil, and do everything according to the recipe. After letting the dough rise for 5-10 min, pinch off golfball-sized pieces and roll them between your hands until they're 4-5" long. Cook on a lightly greased cookie sheet, 1" apart, at 450 for 14-18 minutes. It makes 12-16 4"-5" breadsticks.

Homemade pizza crust! What a treat for my and husbanad and me. I've never made dough from scratch before and this couldn't be easier. I found this recipe over the weekend and have already made it twice. To make it even easier, I cut out the step where I beat the ingredients together. I just use my hands. So easy and good! Both times I've used this dough recipe with the Classic Margharita Pizza recipe on this website. What a great combination! Try to get a pizza stone if you don't have one because it bakes perfectly. Both times my husband keeps on forgetting I made it from scratch and didn't pick it up at a gourmet restaurant. Bravo!

This is as easy as can be. These days, I make it every two weeks, and not for pizza -- which I've used it for, as well as calzones -- but for foccaccia bread.

I've decided to stop buying baguette, which is deadly to a single girl, and now make a double batch of this.

I *do* knead it for 5-10 minutes. I raise it an hour or two, then I cut it into 8 balls. Each portion I stick in a Ziploc sandwich bag, then freeze.

I pop it in the fridge the night before I want one, let it come to room temp for an hour after work, shape into a flatbread on a floured board, let it rise until a finger indent remains, preheat my pizza stone to 450, put olive oil, sea salt, rosemary on my flatbread, and bake until it's golden-brown and bubbly. WONDERFUL.

For a pizza bianco -- a little fresh basil, fresh mozza, sea salt (add charcuterie if you like) -- and bake until happy.

For calzone, it's fabulous.

Freezing this dough gives it time to rise and get happy. It's easy to make, will freeze for 4-6 weeks, and I highly recommend it as a way to give yourself a LITTLE incredible flatbread with a barbecued meal, salad, whatever.

Just my take. :)

This recipe makes homemade pizza a simple dinner any night of the week.  I usually double it to make two big pizzas.  The only thing I change is the cooking method.  I heat the oven to 450, put the dough on a big cookie sheet, pop it into the oven on the lowest rack, turn it up to 500, and let it bake for 5 minutes.  Then I pull it out, turn the heat down to 450 again, spread on sauce, cheese and toppings, and put it back into the oven until the cheese is melted.  This always gives a perfectly brown crust that is crispy on the edges and bottom.  Even with my cheap oven and no pizza stone, baking this way gives great results!

Delicious & Easy!  I read previous reviews and also added Italian spices and onion powder.  Also, let dough rise 1/2 hour.  Great recipe.  Will make again.

This crust is just as it says - quick and easy. It's the first time I've made my own pizza crust. It is at least as good as most restaurant pizza crusts. Also it was easier to work with than most crust mixes I've used.  Others have said it doesn't have a lot of flavor but -it's pizza crust- what do you expect. I like it and my husband likes it too.

This is a good if you're REALLY pressed for time, but it didn't turn out as well as my usual recipe that calls for a dough rise.  I added Italian seasoning and garlic, and the crust still tasted somewhat bland.

This crust "makes" my pizza.  I sprinkle a bit of parmesan cheese, and italian seasoning on the top before adding the pizza sauce.  It's quick and simple and delicious!

My cleaning lady, a dough expert, changed the instructions slightly and we ended up with a beautiful, soft dough.
Instead of using the entire cup of warm water in which to dissolve the yeast, she used only a half cup, and the remaining half she added to the flour mixture.  She also took time to knead the dough and let it rest. Results were amazing!  I had her make some mini rounds to use as appetizers and some slightly larger ones to freeze to use as part of a quick meal or snack when needed.  I'll have her make more next week!  She also mentioned that, if you added more sugar (to taste), this dough would make a lovely bread.

WOW! Delicious, easy, quick, no waiting for it to rise (yea!) and the best pizza my hubby's ever had! The only thing I will do different next time is add some Italian herbs to the flour before mixing as per previous reviews. Did I mention it was easy?

I just made this crust tonight and it was so easy!  The best part is that it's quick and still tastes better than most of the pizza to go places around here. I hate when you want to make homemade pizza and then realize it's going to take 1 hour for the crust at least (w/rise time), so you say "forget it".  Now I can just use this recipe and whip up a delish pizza in only 1/2 hour. I topped mine with pineapple and prosciutto and it was so good!

Makes a wonderful crust. Dough is very, very sticky, however. I added a bit more flour, maybe 2 Tb, and although it was still sticky, it was workable. The stickiness is a big part of why it doesn't need rising like a conventional crust. With less flour in proportion to the yeast, it rises more easily and quickly when exposed to oven heat. Nice soft texture when baked. Adding 2 Tb finely grated Parmesan boosts flavor, as well as adding 1/2 tsp basil and 1/2 tsp oregano. A preheated baking stone is a necessity to ensure a crispy, well-baked crust. Just be sure to sprinkle your peel very liberally with cornmeal or flour to allow for a smooth transfer to the stone. No worries about it sticking once it bakes on the stone. It will release easily when fully baked.

Much better on a pizza stone than in a metal pizza pan.  I used all purpose flour and it tasted great.

Wow! loved it! have made about 20 batches in the last few weeks for family gatherings. Grandchildren love making own.I use King Arthur All Purpose flour and some times sub 1 cup of King Whole Wheat.  Garlic or Italian or seasonings, cheese sticks in the rim ofcrust;  cheesy garlic bread sticks; make one very very thin and crisp for 1 person, thick deep dish and chewy for another, veggie toppings for one,  meat toppings for others.  Fresh Basil is great mixed in the dough or as a topping. I do grease the bowl and the ball of dough with shortening.  Let it rest for 30 min up to 2 hours until I am ready to finish it. I do precook for 5 min before adding sauce or toppings.  One grandchild particular about his food loved it and is now making his own. Another grandchild is taking the recipe to his college dorm where he has a suite and all the guys are going to be making it. :) Nice easy, fast recipe!

OMG!  This was the very FIRST "from scratch" pizza I've made without buying a pre-made dough or pizza sauce.  It was AWESOME!  I HATE looking at reviews and reading all the changes people make......if you want to make all the changes, make your OWN recipe.  I added nothing, changed nothing......just followed the recipe and cooked for 18 mins and it was the best pizza ever!  I've definitely saved this in my recipe box!  Thanks Chef Rider!

Substituted rapid rise yeast and mixed all the dry ingredients ahead and put in jars with some dried italian herbs(Mrs. Dash blend) and spices, included instructions and used them in pizza gift baskets for my sisters. Included pizza cutter, pan, sauce, toppings, oven mitt, kitchen towel, & this crust mix. Worked great, they loved it and had good results! I also baked a pizza using this crust and enjoyed it.

The first time I made this crust, I rated it one star. The crust did not turn out well at all. After trying it again and adding 20 min to the rise time, the crust turned out much better. As written the crust NEEDS more time to rise, 5 min is simply not enough. I'm leaving my rating at one star, due to the original recipe. If you want a better outcome let the dough rise longer then 5 min. I also added Rosemary and Sage to the dough. AMAZING!!

Wow! This is some tasty crust! It was nice and chewy, not tough at all. I doubled the recipe for my large family and used rapid rise yeast. I added about 2 tsp italian seasoning and 1 tsp garlic powder to the oil before adding it to the dough. The smell was fabulous and just what we were looking for in a homemade pizza dough. Hubby usually leaves the crust behind, but he ate every bit this time and said he could eat more...if there were any left. ;)

This is a really good recipe for pizza crust and from a chef.  You don't even need the 5 minutes like it suggests.  For my third batch I used margarine instead of the olive oil.  It is alot tastier.  After making two batches, I baked the third at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes.  It was better and the cheese was not too brown.  I plan on making this again and again!!

This dough is quick, easy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except for using all purpose flour and mixing the dough using my hands rather than beating it. With no extra rise time, it was easy to work and made a nice crust for a cookie sheet sized pizza. I have made this twice. I used loose active dry yeast--2.5 teaspoons equals one package.
I will be making this often.

I USED to make my pizza crust via bread machine. That method took too long. I like to add the olive oil and the salt to the yeast mixture after the 10 minutes were up. I used 1 1/2 cups of wheat flour and 1 cup of regular flour. I let the dough rest anywhere between 20 to 30 minutes before rolling it out. The crust comes out perfect every time! Not soft in the center of the pizza and it holds up to the topping very well. Pizza in about 1 hour instead of 2 1/2 hrs. Thank you for sharing!

Good. Very bread-like crust. Will likely try again and possibly knead and make two crusts out of recipe.

We used almost all whole wheat flour and only 3/4 cup of all purpose flour but the result was still delicious. I was surprised that our pizza wasn't tough from all the wheat flour. Out of habit, I let the dough rise for 30 minutes. We will use this recipe again. Thank you.

This is so quick and easy I stopped buying pre-made or refrigerator crusts. I brush the dough with olive oil and italian seasoning before topping. It also makes great cheese sticks.

We love this pizza! Great taste and so quick! It puffs up in the oven when prebaking. Make sure to poke the crust with a fork when prebaking (5 minutes or less). Another thing I do is sautee the vegetables in some oil then add the sauce and cook for a few minutes so I don't have to burn the pizza waiting for the veggies to cook. I then put the sauce with veggies on the slightly baked pizza crust with some parmesean cheese then top with mozzarella.

Very Good, I made this tonight for supper, I doubled the recipe to make two pizza's and topped with fajita chicken, onions, green peppers. The crust baked crisp on the bottom and light and soft inside. Some crusts are a little doughy but this is perfect. I will be making this my regular crust. I did let it rest for 20 minutes instead of 5 minutes, that's the only adjustment I made. Thanks for a great recipe Amanda.

Thank you for such an easy recipe!!  I made just as listed ... used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 1/2 cup all purpose flour and 1 tsp. seasoned salt in place of regular. Also added 2 tsp Italian seasoning, 1 1/2 tsp. dry onion flakes, and 3/4 tsp garlic powder. SO YUMMY =)

This has to be one of the easiest pizza dough recipes ever.  The crust was chewy without tasting like cardboard.  Now I never have to buy pizza dough again.  Thanks!

It does NOT get any easier then this folks!  I did add a little garlic powder, and Italian herbs to the dough process.  I used my mixer to mix the dough.  Fastest pizza crust EVER.  I followed the tip from another cook and I prebaked the crust (on a stone) for 8 minutes before adding toppings.  Pulled crust out at 8 min - ... spread my base sauce, topped with goodies and baked another 10 minutes.  It was DONE to absolute perfection!!!

WAY BETTER THAN jays signature pizza crust from this site! loved it, ive made it alot now.  Ive done it on the grill to! Great dough, in the picture I posted for this recipe, I made 2 crusts out of this, but made them Very thin, for the thin crust style.  I cooked it on my pizza crisper pan and was GREAT. I love crust thin.  THanks for this recipe, LOVED IT!

This crust is great! Actually I have been using this recipe for two years now and didn't really pay any attention to this site back then. It was something I had found right away and was thrilled that I finally found a terrific pizza crust recipe! I actually add about a Tablespoon of olive oil and a teaspoon of oregeno and a teaspoon of crushed rosemary. YYUUMM!! What I LOVE about this recipe is that I can make two thin crust pizza crusts or one thick crust! Everyone eats it right up!! Sorry I hadn't reviewed this earlier! It is wonderful!!

Pretty good for being so quick and easy.. I read through all the changes.. and was discouraged as alot of people "HAD" to change and modify it to make it worth eating... WRONG... it was easy enough for my husband to quickly put it together despite my telling him to read through all the changes.. and you know what.. Keep it the way it is. Turned out great. Thanks!

It was pretty good, but I think I need to go to a pizza-making class because forming the pizza crust was VERY difficult for me (my kitchen looks like a flour sack exploded :). Overall, we enjoyed it, however, I might stick the crust in the oven for a few minutes before adding toppings next time as we like our crust a little crisper.

I like this recipe, because it's super quick, and quite easy. The changes I made are: adding herbs, and onion/garlic powder to the dough, and I brushed the crust lightly with butter, after 10 minutes in the oven, and sprinkled with parmesan. I liked a review that I read, about making flatbread out of the recipe! sounds good -- I'll have to try that! What I would do differently in the future, is let the dough rise for 30 min., instead of 5... and I might add a touch more olive oil, or something to the crust, to make it a bit less dry. :-) What I loved most about this recipe was, is that I had EVERYTHING in the house already, and didn't need to go out and buy any extra ingredients. Thank you!

This turned out just beautifully! I always put off making pizza because I always forget to put the dough up to proof, but now I can procrastinate and still have dinner on the table! The mix was a bit sticky, so I added another 1/3 cup flour to make it easier to handle. I only made one very large pizza, but you could easily split this into two thinner crusted large pizzas. My family of four devoured this faster than take out, so I am gonna have to divide it into two next time for sure. Thanks so much for this, its now on the rotation!

This was awful. Ended up eating the topping and throwing the crust away. It did not rise and was chewy and doughy after 20 minutes in the oven.

This is so quick and easy for a crust, and I love that it doesn't have to rise because I'm not always good at planning ahead.  I have made this dozens of times and will continue to.  I like to brush the crust with some olive oil mixed with Italian seasoning, a little red pepper, and some garlic.  Also, it seems to turn out better if I bake it for about 5 minutes before adding the toppings. Yum!!

Really great easy pizza crust recipe.  I love that you don't have to wait long for it to rise.  Per previous reviews, I also added some Italian Seasonings to the dough.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks!

This is such a great pizza dough & so easy.  I just use my kitchenaid mixer with the metal dough hook.  I think this is better than the pampered chef in a box mix.  I make this on average 3 times a month. I have pre-mixed the dry ingredients and stored them in individual ziplocks to make preparation quicker; works great! I like making this in Friday or Saturday with leftovers from the week. We've tried lots of different pizza variations! Friends love my home made pizza & I have this recipe to thank for that!

Perfect for quick pizza. Just made it and loved it so much I emailed the recipe to friends. I sprinkled with garlic and Parmesan for extra flavor.
Used red. oil and plain flour as I was out of everything else. Hubby had 3 helpings and claimed it a winner.
Will definitely make again.

This crust came out very dry for me. It was edible but certainly not good. It has no flavor so I brushed melted butter and herbs on the edges. There was still a piece left over so I know my Hubby really hated it. It was so solid I think I could have used it as a doorstop!

This crust totally lived up to it's name.  I do think that next time I will try some seasonings as in; oregano, basil, onion & garlic powders, & romano cheese, because it did lack some flavor, but it did bake up nicely.  I can't believe how easy this was, I don't find it necessary to go back to store bought crusts again.  Thanks Amanda!

I was looking for a quick and easy pizza dough recipe that I did not have to make time for rising when I was in a hurry..or simply forgot.  I am a mom of 3 life happens.  This was perfect!  I did not have bread flour and used A/P and it came out just fine. I did add 1/2 tsp more salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of onion powder to give it more flavor that my family enjoys.  This recipe makes 2 14in pizzas with a hand tossed thickness.  For my cheesy bread sticks I added a 1/2 of grated Parmesan cheese to the dough and it was again wonderful.  Thank you for such a great and easy recipe.

This was easy & delish.  I used all purpose flour.  I have a smaller sized round pizza pan, (? not a  12 in. pan I don't think) so it came out thicker, so I pre-baked it for 5 min. then topped it before baking another 15 min. or so.  I could have easily gotten 2 thin crusts out of it.  This will be great for free-form pizzas on the grill come summertime. thanx chef rider!

Great crust, quick & easy to fix as promised.  Be sure to use the right pan for a right crust.  My air-bake cookie sheet made a firm light brown crust; the heavy aluminum pan made a soft 'white' crust.  Great recipe ... son-in-law thought it was carryout!

This is exactly the same as regular dough and tastes the same, it's just denser because it hasn't had a chance to poof up.  This recipe works in a pinch if you're short on time, but I think we'd rather go with regular dough that has risen if we can.  It didn't crisp up as well as regular dough.

This crust comes out wonderfully soft and chewy, but still sturdy enough to support a loaded up pie. My seven-year-old (who is very particular about his pizza) has asked for my "special pizza" twice this week. It makes awesome breadsticks, too. I added some basil, oregano, parsley, and thyme (no idea how much, just till it looked right -- I learned to cook from my grandmother, who never measured anything :) to the dough, then rolled it into sticks and baked them for about 10 minutes. Brush the hot sticks with a little garlic butter and dust with parmesan cheese, and it's better than anything you can buy at a pizza joint!

THE BEST!!!  I can't express enough how happy I am that I tried this recipe!!  The convenience of it can't be beat!  I always used to use another recipe on here for pizza crust and always had to wait for it to rise which prevented us from having pizza last minute.  This one, however, is so quick and easy!  I doubled the recipe (which doubled nicely) and used all-purpose flour (didn't have bread flour).  I am hooked and there will be no need to look at any other pizza crust recipe; this is IT!!  Thank you so much!

Have you actually tied this with all perpose flour? It was the messiest gooiest "dough" ever. It was more like a batter, and we followed directions to a tee.And, we basically poured this sticky batter onto our pizza pan. So thanks a lot.

This is really easy and very tasty. I always season my pizza so I had no problems with bland crust. I brush some melted butter and garlic powder over the crust before topping it.

You will love this quick & easy to make dough for your pizza. I added the cornmeal on the bottom of the pizza pan as well as some with some herbs around the outside of the dough. Very tasty.  You can tell however, that it didn't have that real 'yeasty' taste that in the dough that we have made from scratch in the past.  But for a quick dough, it was great.

AMAZING CRUST!!!!!! It was soft yet slightly crispy at the same time. i did let it rise 30+ minutes while i was  preparing the sauce. Rather than baking at 450 degrees, i baked it at 350 degrees for approx. 15 min. it turned out absolutely delicious! the sauce was good too (i used the "exquisite pizza sauce" recipe) but the crust MADE the pizza. Thank you Chef Rider!***UPDATE*** I made naan(flatbread) using this crust, tasted kinda "pizza-ish" but very quick and yummy. :)

I tried 50/50 KA. AP. flour and KA. Bread flour. That being the Only modification. Turned out wonderful, fluffy, and crispy!
I've used it for sweet and savory fried dough, and pizza. I've tried two other recipes and they're very labor intensive and the end result is mediocre at best. Love this RECIPE!

I was honestly suprised as to how good this pizza dough was! I added some italian seasonings to the dough mixture. It came out nice and thick! I used all purpose flour. Toppings....fresh grated moz cheese, sweet italian sausage and mushrooms! Should have made more :)

I got two 12-inch pies from this recipe.  Use half, then froze half.  You have to let it thaw a day or so in the fridge before using,  then set it on the counter to "relax' before it will stretch easily, but it was even better the second time.  Made a nice thin crust, chewy with crisp bottom and edges (on pizza stone preheated to 500).  2nd use was to make  Brown Eyed Baker's 'Portobello Pesto Pizza' from her blog, and was it ever delicious! - would add a bit of thyme and garlic powder while sauteing the mushrooms next time though.

This was awesome! I doubled the recipe and added some seasonings like others recommended.  I made one pizza with red sauce, mozz and mushrooms and another with garlic and olive oil, parm and mozz cheeses, basil, and tomato.  They were both outstanding! We will definitely be making pizza at home instead of ordering out.  Thanks!

This is a great versatile recipe. Try changing out a cup of white flour for wheat or adding garlic salt instead of regular salt. I have also added 1 tsp of basil and oregano or a quarter cup of grated parmesan (adjust the salt a little as the cheese can be salty).

5 STARS!  I made it in two separate batches, as I wasn't sure how much I'd need.  I also let them sit longer than 5 minutes, but stayed with the recipe other than that.  We wanted individual pizzas, so I bought some cheap foil pie pans and sprayed them with butter flavor Crisco spray then lightly dusted them with cornmeal.  We used no more than a baseball sized dough in each.  Then we brushed lightly with olive oil, topped with toppings and baked them on the very bottom rack.  When they were starting to get done, I took them out of the pie pans and put them directly on the oven rack to crisp the bottoms.  To say they were good is an understatement!  I used the Exquisite sauce recipe on this site (with a few tweaks) and turkey pepperoni & mushrooms.  For the last two, we brushed liberally with margarine and topped with a mixture of 1/3 cup sugar & 1/2 tsp cinnamon and cut them into sticks after baking (leaving them in the pan the whole time because of the butter).  We used a bought vanilla glaze to drizzle over them.  Not a single bite was left of pizza or cinnamon sticks!  The mini pizzas were easy to work with on browning the bottoms because I used a wide spatula to insert and remove from the oven.  It was a bit of work because I had 2 pizzas in the oven continuously, while making more, and I had to keep an eye on them.  But the finished result was worth it.  2 batches of dough made eight 8 1/4" pie pan size pizzas/sticks.  SO GOOD!

I used this basic recipe but subbed about 1/2+ of the flour with ww bread flour.  Also I let it rise to double then patted it out on the pan.  After letting it rest for 15 min. I baked it for 5 min at 450 then made the black bean spinach pizzza on this site.  The crust was great.   thanks

Very good and extremely easy. I ended up with more than enough for a 12 in pizza so I decided to roll up the crust around the edges over some cheddar cheese (the ones that come in a stick) so that we could have stuffed crust pizza. I brushed the dough with olive oil infused with garlic poder and basil and baked 5 min before adding the rest of the toppings.

Title says it all. Quick and easy. Added 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour but kept everything else as is. Let dough rise in covered bowl while I cleaned the counter and prepped the toppings. Made two large thin crust pizzas with this recipe.

I've made this pizza 2 ways. First as it was intended, I made it for my kids one saturday afternoon because I needed something quick.  It was just fine for that.  Last night though, I let it rise for an hour in the bowl with oil and a warm damp towel over it.  I then put it in the pan spread it out and covered it for another hour.  I cooked it at 500 for 9 minutes, and then did the broiler on high for about 45 seconds or so, watching it most of the time in the oven.    This pizza the second way with the rise and cooked at 500 was as close to the big national pizza chain as I could get.  I also add pizza dough flavoring from King Arthur Flours website.    This is the ONLY pizza dough I will ever us again period.  It came together so quick in the bowl, I kneaded it for a short time and it was perfect. I also will never cook another pizza at anything lower than 500.

This pizza dough/crust is FABULOUS!!! I tried another "easy" dough, but it came out flat and hard.  I made it twice, and both times gave the same result.  This recipe, however, comes out thick, slightly crisp, and chewy. JUST as good as making the dough using the "normal" process of kneading/rising/beating etc.  Using a standard baking sheet/jelly roll pan, it comes out perfectly. I use this, with an easy sauce (tomato paste, tomato sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, etc. - it's on this website) and top it with pepperoni, ground beef and mozzarella.  It sounds so simple but it is to DIE FOR. We've been eating it once a week, ever since I found this crust recipe.  You MUST try it!

This pizza was fantastic.  It could not have turned out any more perfect.  I added 1 tsp of Italian Seasoning and 1/2 tsp of onion powder to the olive oil and kneaded it into the bread.  After using a rolling pin and getting it quite thin and circular I brushed on olive oil and garlic powder on the the top but you have to be very careful to not make it soggy.  I put a very thin layer on it and it was great.  I constructed the pizza (pizza sauce, mushrooms, green peppers, pepperoni, and mozzarella cheese)on top of parchment paper and transferred that right onto the preheated pizza stone in the oven.  I baked it at 450 degrees for about 16 minutes.  The parchment made for easy removal and cleaning. The pizza was devoured by my boyfriend and his two roommates and we all loved it. I will never make my crust any different.

Truly a wonderous recipe! I wanted to use whole wheat flour instead of bread flour though. In order to compensate I added 1/2 cup more water and I substituted the oil with 2 TBSP of canola oil and used only 1 TBSP olive oil. I've had nothing but great reviews. Thank you!

My husband thinks I'm some kind of genius!  "You made the crust...from scratch?"  This is the first time I've made a yeast pizza crust and this was, as advertised, quick and easy.  I used all-purpose flour, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  I am pretty lame with a rolling pin, but found this dough quite easy to roll out to fit my pizza pan.  I had a little trouble getting it onto the pan, but easily pushed it back into shape.  I baked for 20 minutes on the lowest oven rack and the crust came out crispy--I used an AirBake pizza pan dusted with cornmeal.  If you want to get a home-made pizza on the table in less than an hour, give this a try!

I used regular all purpose flour and it seemed to work fine.  I took the suggestion of adding some seasonings to the oil and also brushing the crust with some garlic powder and olive oil.  I think I overdid it on the seasonings, though.  All in all, this was a good crust that was easy to work with but I think I'm still on the hunt for the perfect homemade crust.

Oh Yum!  What a delicious crust this was!  My kids even said it was better than the pizza ordered out :)  Thank you very much!  I'm without a doubt keeping this one and btw...I froze 8 individual size pizza crusts (using double the recipe) w/wax paper in between each and as mentioned in other reviews this works wonderfully :) 
1/2 tsp italian seasoning
1/4 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder 
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper 
(The best and easiest way to add herbs is to mix them into the olive oil before you add it to the batter - that will ensure even distribution throughout the entire dough.) 

Next time I'm going to add the olive oil and garlic pwdr and or cayenne to the edges of the crust and sprinkle the pan with cornmeal (jiffy) to give it that perfect crisp bottom.  I forgot this time but normally do that.  

However I will say this crust recipe is awesome and cooking it as it is I'm sure would still be just as great the seasonings just add another wonderful flavor dimension to the already great recipe :)
Update: I make this pizza crust regularly in my house and  it always is a hit.  My family loves it and it is a permanent staple in our house :)  TY again for such a wonderful recipe.

Very easy to make and delicious.  I used 1 teaspoon of yeast because I buy yeast in bulk and not in packages. Thanks!

This was a great recipe Amanda.  I loved how quick and easy this was.  I added a teaspoon of oregano, basil, marjoram, garlic and onion powders to the flour to give the dough some extra flavor.  My pizza turned out perfect. I used this with the "Buffalo Style Chicken Pizza" recipe.  Had I known how easy this was, I would have been making homemade pizzas a long time ago.  Many thanks.

This recipe makes a thick crust for you pizza.  It's very good, and requires very little resting time.  We'll use it again!

I love this recipe! I did use a few suggestions that others had mentioned such as I added 1/2 tsp. Oregano, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp. onion powder to the OIL and mixed the spices into the oil until well blended then add to the yeast and sugar BEFORE adding the flour. I do this because before adding the flour I put my bowl with the yeast, sugar, salt and oil mix in the microwave and warm it for approx. 15 to 20 seconds in order to help the process of my crust to rise. I also have my oven on warming to temp while making my dough. I'm telling you this because you can use this to also help get your dough to rise. I after I get my dough mixed to a nice pliable ball will leave it in the bowl and set the bowl on a cookie sheet on top of the oven for about 1/2 hour to rise. My dough ball will usually rise to double the size before I start using for crust. Another note I forgot to tell you is that the Oregano, Garlic powder and such are optional it just adds a nicer flavor to the crust. I used this same recipe to make breadsticks and they turned out fantastic. Just roll out dough like pizza, add butter or margarine with garlic powder over the top of dough and add your favorite cheese ( I used an Italian blend) and bake until cheese is nice and bubbly and starting to turn a light brown on top. Everyone at my house loves the flavor of  this crust! This is a easy and no fail recipe. I will be giving this a 5 star rating.

This is my new favorite. I haven't yet used bread flour, but all-purpose works well. I have even made a whole wheat crust out of this. I also let it sit much longer. I usually make three and I bake them separately for 15 min then add another for the last 5 min. I use the air bake pans and it just comes out perfect. Most of all, this dough is a dream to work with. I don't know the reason why it is, I'm just a novice. But my teens want this pizza all the time, especially when I slice meatballs up for the topping. A decent pizzeria pizza is $18.00 where I live. Making your own is soooo easy and cheaper= about $4.49 a pie which includes the meatballs. I think everyone should try this recipe. You'll probably never buy another pie again.

Although it is quick and easy, the dough is on the fluffy side.  I would rather have a crispness to the bottom of the pizza.  There is a different recipe with honey and a little longer of a wait, it's a better crust that's just as easy.

This was very good and super easy.  I added garlic powder and Herbs de Provence to the dough before mixing. I had time to let it rise so I stuck it in the cold oven for about 2 hours. It rolled out easily.  Added toppings and baked on a stone for 20 minutes. Waited about 5 minutes before eating.... It was delicious.  Will make again for sure.

Can't go wrong with this one!   Easy, fast and tasty...what else could a cook ask for?   Threw it all in my mixer and used the dough hook and it came together quickly and cleanly.  I've passed this on to countless family and friends and all of the love it.

This recipe is perfect for a quick weeknight meal.  I doubled the recipe in order to make two pies for my hungry family.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but did let the dough rest for more than 5 minutes after mixing.  My pepperoni and cheese pizza turned out perfect.  My kids were certainly impressed.  The "supreme" pizza with lots of added veggies was a little soggy, so I will bake the crust halfway before adding the toppings next time around.  Not the best pizza crust I've ever made, but definitely the easiest!

I have made this recipe a few dozen times. Each time it's come out great. I've experienced with it (added herbs, made cal-zones, pizza pockets, pepperoni rolls, sausage appetizers). Each time it's come out the same...delicious. I've made this recipe and frozen it (original recipe and my version) with great results. This was great to be used on my pizza pan and on my pizza stone. I can't say enough. It's my GO TO recipe.

Quick and easy, as advertised!  I made 4 personal pizzas out of this crust, prebaked for 5 min, then let the kids put their own toppings on.  Afterward, I baked them for five more minutes.  They loved it.

Not the most delicious crust ever, but they were ready in no time and were tasty enough!  Next time I will try adding some garlic or herbs.

Awesome! Like others said, not super flavorful but still good. Tender inside, crusty outside. My only alterations were to add herbs to the dough- garlic, rosemary, thyme, basil and oregeno- brushing the crust with olive oil, kneading it a little (it's not really hard or time consuming, so I said why not?) and halving the recipe. That made a super tasty 8 inch pizza. The dough got pretty thick even though I spread it out pretty thin- but I loved it anyways. THANKS!

Very impressed with how quick & easy this was, and how well it turned out! I was skeptical on having a dough crust that did not involve rise time with yeast, but it was delicious and used simple common ingredients in our kitchen. One thing I had to opt for was regular white flour because I did not have bread flour on hand. I also added some italian seasonings, garlic, etc.. to the dough and brushed it with some olive oil topped with fresh grated parmesean for a twist before baking the second time i made it. That turned out great! I have yet to use a pizza stone because ours is packed away but have a feeling it would be even better of an outcome. But everyone has loved it and it has been devoured. Guests have told me it is better than the Digiorno or other frozen pizzas. Thanks for sharing this! :)

This was my first time making my own pizza dough from scratch and I was drawn to how easy this recipe was! I used 2 1/4 tsp of yeast as someone suggested, since I had jarred yeast. And I didn't have bread flour, so I used 1 C self-rising flour and 1.5 cups wheat flour. I didn't roll out the dough very flat, so it was thicker and fluffier than I would have liked, but it was still delicious. I added some parsley, oregano, garlic powder, red pepper, and parmesan to add a little flavor - as I would do when making dough from a mix. Lots of oregano and garlic really punch it up! Great experience and I will use this recipe again.

UPDATE: I wish I could give this recipe more stars! I just made this into a focaccia and it turned out beautiful! I can't wait to try stuffing the crust of mozzarella the next time I make pizza! FIRST REVIEW: This is a great pizza dough! The only thing I missed was the crispy outer crust, but that can be achieved with a pizza stone. I also used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour and it still turned out delicious. Next time I'll try stuffing the crust with mozzarella. This recipe would also work for a quick focaccia and later made into Italian sandwiches (mozzarella, mortatella, salami, tomatoes, etc). Will definitely make again! Thanks for sharing chef Rider!!

Loved this pizza dough. Doubled the recipe topped with garlic salt and paramesan cheese before topping with sauce.  Rolled out thin and baked one on a pizza stone and one a baking sheet; better on the stone.

I doubled this batch, used just all-purpose flour(it was all I had on hand),added 1 tsp minced garlic to the dough ( When I added the flour ) 1 tsp garlic powder, some oregeno, and I let this dough rise for half hour and it was the best homemade pizza we have ever eaten! You can do so much with this recipe, add this, take away that! This is AWESOME! I do not have a pizza stone yet, so I just popped it in the oven ( I got two huge 12inch pizzas ) The dough was so fluffy! Thank you so much for this amazing dough!!!

Amazing! I didn't strictly measure everything and the dough was a sticky mess. I thought it was going to be a disaster but surprisingly, it still turned out quite well! Never need to buy ready-made crusts ever again. Thanks for sharing this! (I did bake the crust for 15min before i put on any of the toppings and put it back in, plus as other reviewers had mentioned, some herbs with the oil is quite good.)

This recipe for dough is really no different from any other dough recipe used for pizza crust. The exception is you do not let it rise/rest for an hour before using. As a result it makes for a tough dense crust even when rolled thin. No fault of the recipe, just the manner in which you use it. Next time I will let it rise/rest for an hour before using and I'm sure I will have a much tastier experience even though the recipes notes no rise is necessary.

Omg...this was sooo easy!  I followed others suggestions and mixed spices with the oil, and allowed the yeast to rise for about 10 minutes before addig it to the flour.  I used all purpose flour and it worked great!  We will use this again.

This made a very thick crust that was very bread-like. I really enjoyed the taste, but next time I make it I'll likely divide the dough and go thinner.

We used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat and our pizzas were wonderful.

It costs pleanty to make a really good pizza.  You might as well have the best crust you can.  This one works every time.  I add 1 tsp of garlic powder for a garlic crust.  Perfect!

I use this recipe every time I want to make pizza (I make 12-14 servings for two 14" pizzas dep. on crust thickness pref. I also prebake for 5min and brush with oil before adding toppings to bake again). Tonight I made bread sticks with it (12 servings makes about 12 10" breadsticks)...just pulled the dough into long breadstick like shapes baked 5 min, brushed with butter, sprinkled with salt and baked an additional 4-6 min til light golden.  They're wonderful!  Thank you, CHEF RIDER for posting this recipe.

I love the fact that we can have homemade pizza without waiting so long for the crust to be ready.  This recipe was quick, easy to spread on the pizza pan, and tasted great.  Of course, you can always add your own spices to the crust as well.  I have done it as written and also done it adding garlic, basil, and oregano.  It just depends on your tastes.  Either way, it's a great pizza dough recipe!

Just made this again for the who-knows-how-manyeth time.... we love it!  Often add some dry garlic & parsley mix and some italian seasoning to the yeast mixture after it foams up to let the dry herbs reconstitute.  Tonight we made 3 1/4-sheet pans and used 4X the recipe--it comes out thick enough to hold sauce and toppings but not so much that it gives you a heavy feeling after a few pieces.  Everyone who's ever eaten this with us has really enjoyed it and there have been MANY pizza connoisseurs (aka teenagers) in that mix.  Much more economincal to feed a hungry group at home than the pizza parlor and everyone gets what they want on their part of the pizza!!

Fantastic!  Added a bit of garlic powder to the crust and topped with homemade guacamole, tomatoes, diced red onions, feta, crushed red pepper, and mozzarella.  Thanks for such a great and easy recipe!

I don't know what happened, but my crust just didn't turn out that great. Maybe I should have let the dough rise, maybe I should have baked the crust before adding the toppings...not sure, but the crust was very dense and a bit salty.

I've made this pizza crust several times now and it has turned out well every time! I use all purpose flour and vegetable oil instead of olive oil, and it's so good! I have even used it to make quick cinnamon rolls and it was YUMMY!

This is my go to recipe.  I have it memorized, and make it at least twice a month.  You can do all sorts of stuff to it as well, change it to whole wheat, press it out and let it rise again....then press it out again and you have a thin crust.  I cook on a pan until 5 min are left, then I slide it directly onto the rack.

Easy recipe!  I loved it!  I made a HUGE pizza with the dough.  I used all whole wheat flour instead of bread flour and it came out fine! (I did roll it pretty thin - as I like thin crusted pizzas).  I added about a tablespoon of Italian seasoning to the flour mix before mixing it with the water/yeast/sugar mixture.  I baked for about 25 minutes to let everything cook.  Very easy to make.

We make this on a weekly basis and it never fails!  Sometimes we get a little creative and use some rye or wheat flour.  Mixing in some fresh basil adds a great flavor too.

This is a great quick recipe.  I happen to like a thinner crust so I cut the recipe in half for one large pizza and roll it out to fit my pizza stone.  Add basil and garlic with olive oil for sauce, a little cheese, fresh toms, onion and spciy thai chicken.  Comes out great in 20mins.

This gets a 5 star from me for versatility. I get two large pizza bases out of this. If you follow the recipe as is, it gives you a quick crust thats chewy and tastes great, if you have the time to let the dough rise for a bit (45min-1 hour) it gives you a soft delicious crust. I made the dough and divided into 2 portions, rolled both out onto pizza pans and left the one in a warm oven while I topped the other. The one that i topped got baked immediately and gave me the tasty crust. The one that stood in the oven I topped 45min later, then froze. A few days later i thawed and baked it and it turned out even better than the first. So yay for a great crust, whether you are stuck for time or not!

I've been trying to make pizza for a few years now and it's always been good...but could always be a lot better. This pizza crust is exactly what it says: quick and easy. And delicious!  I love that you don't have to let it rise before forming on the pan (though I did let it sit to the side for about 10 minutes while I cut up veggies and mix my sauce. I don't think it makes too much of a difference).   It came out exactly how I love my crust; not thin but not super bready. A very good happy medium. It's also by far the best crust I've ever made. The only thing I did different was I let it bake in the oven without toppings for about 5-8 minutes. I pulled it out and let it cool for a bit. After that I kind of pressed down on any "bubbly" areas to make sure it was even. After that I spread the sauce and topped with lots of cheese, peppers, onions, feta, and fresh tomatoes. So awesome!!

Very good pizza crust! I used 1 cup of wheat flour and 1 1/2 white flour, and it was delicious! I also baked it for 4-5 minutes before I put the toppings on, and it was perfect! A definite keeper!

I was out of time for my usual recipe in the bread machine and then found this one. I let the dough sit in a greased bowl for about 1/2hr until my toppings were ready and it was easy to work with. I usually roll out my dough for the cookie sheet but this was very pliable and could be stretched by hand. Definately going to make this again!

I love how easy this is to throw together.  It made a nice, thick soft crust.  I added a few seasonings to the dough (basil, oregano & garlic) and brushed it with olive oil before putting the toppings on.  I also let it rise for about a half hour, while I prepped the toppings.  It tasted great and was so so easy to make!

Made this last night for dinner for the second or third time. This time I used just wheat flour. I must advise against this. I've made it with half wheat half unbleached before and it was great! But will all wheat it doesn't roll out as evenly and was too "wheaty" for myself and my husband...

I made this with white whole wheat, using wheat gluten for one fifth of the flour.  I made a double batch - 4 cups white whole wheat and one cup wheat gluten.  As always, when using whole wheat flour more water is necessary - about 1/4 cup.  I let my Kitchen Aid dough hook do the mixing.  It was really easy to roll out.  I made two large stromboli rolls with it.  I am definitely using this as my standard pizza crust recipe.  It was so quick and easy!

Pretty basic dough and easy to prepare.  I will say that leaving the yeast to dissolve in the water for at least 10 minutes makes a difference.  I also added garlic powder to the flour. I also let rise for about 1 hour.  Very versatile basic recipe and can be modified to your liking.

I was pleasantly surprised at how quick and easy this pizza crust really was! And it was delicious. The husband and kids loved it! Will make it again.

The reason for the "quick" part is because of the addition of sugar... allowing the yeast to react quicker. If you have more time, let it sit a while longer and you will have better results.   I also like to add fresh garlic and some herbs to the crust to give it more flavor :)

I've made many pizza doughs but this one is by far the best and simple to make too.  It never sticks and is just so wonderful to work with.

This is very simular to the recipe I use, however I use 2 tbsp of honey instead of sugar. Also I put everything in the food processer with the dough blade and dough setting. Let it run for at least a minute after it comes together in a ball. Give it at least an hour to rise

Quick, easy and tasted great!  I add fresh garlic, black pepper, oregano and whatever else I feel like to the dough.  I always use plenty of flour when I pat it out onto my stoneware (sprinkle some cornmeal on first and it won't stick).  I bake the dough for 5-7 minutes prior to topping, and then, once the toppings have been added, finish baking until the cheese is browned.  Alternately, I've made this dough into 4 calzones and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  This is such a versatile recipe - I'll never buy a pre-made dough again!

This was fantastic! Followed the recipe exactly. I did cook the crust for about 6 minutes in the oven before I added the toppings.  The crust really rises while cooking so roll out your crust thinner if you like thin crust. I will never order pizza out again. This crust is a snap to make and tastes so fresh!

Impressive to say the very least! I followed instructions exactly EXCEPT that I added Italian spices to the pizza dough before mixing in my Kitchen Aid stand mixer.  Excellent results, especially for being such a quick recipe.  Will use "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" from this site when I have a bit more time but this one during the week when the pizza bug hits.  Thanks so much for sharing this, it is GREATLY appreciated!

Followed the recipe exactly as is and it came out fantastically.   I worked for several years in an authentic pizza restaurant. Making the dough was a task that took all day. This recipe yielded a very similar pizza crust and was so much faster.   BTW - If anyone is interested, a good way to cook this up is, after spreading it to desired thickness over a sprinkling of cornmeal, spread on some olive oil, minced garlic, fresh chopped basil and tomatoes and top with mozzarella. Bake on a pizza stone, "mesh" style pizza pan, or baking sheet at 500 degrees.  Buon appetito!

Great recipe!  I only wish I would have divided the dough in half and made two pizzas - the one pizza I made (spread onto my Pampered Chef pizza stone) had a very thick crust.  But the crust was very yummy!  Next time I'll either halve the recipe or make two pizzas.

This was not very good.  It looked great but it was way too crispy.  I doubled the recipe and made two...one I baked on an airbake pan and it was still really crispy.  Also, it doesn't have a lot of flavor.  My boyfriend, who normally LOVES pizza, said it tasted like "water" and he couldn't even choke down more than a couple slices.  I'm going to stick to Jay's Signature Pizza Crust on this site.

This is awesome!!!!!! I like to make four personal pizzas out of it. You can shape into four equal parts, top, then bake at 450 for 12-15 minutes.

You can even just bake the crust bare for 8 minutes, then save the crust (like a premade crust, that you would buy) and just put some toppings on and pop in the oven for 5-8 minutes. Even make it in the microwave, the crust is already cooked! 

Great and fast, healthier for kids too! I used white wheat flour!

I've tried this recipe last week and it turned out better than I expected.
However, I was a bit disappointed because the dough in the middle of the pan didn't rise at all, so it was undercooked. But at the side, the dough rose perfectly -- very nice!
In short, I will use this recipe again and this time I'd prebake the crust first  and add the toppings afterward.

Terrific!  I followed as directed with one addition - just for the fun of it!
I rolled my dough to about 1 - 1 1/2 inches beyond the edge of my pizza stone.  I then layed strips of string (mozzarella) cheese on the dough extension, rolled the dough over the cheese and pinched it to seal it.  When the pizza was done baking, we has my version of "Stuffed Crust" pizza and it was fabulous.  The "hubs" said it was ever bit as good if not better than pizza shop pizza.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!!

I worked as a manger at Domino's for 8 years and became disabled because of RA. I haven't had a good Pizza since I left but I tried this dough and it is wonderful. I didn't add any of the extra's this time but I plan to try them in the future. Finally a good pizza, I'm no longer reduced to eating frozem pizza's because the pizza places don't know how to make a good pizza.

Worked out very well. I'm giving it four stars because it's not quite as quick as you are led to believe...however, that's not to say that it doesn't come together pretty fast! I do have a tip for using it though. If you are going to put flavored olive oil on the crust to achieve that pretty golden brown color, make sure to bake it for a bit before putting the sauce & toppings on or it will be slightly soggy. Mine came out a bit soggy because I didn't even think about baking it a bit first, but it still came out very well. Will use again and again. Thanks!!

I love this recipe. I mix up the dough in my food processor in under 5 minutes, roll it out, & bake. I like to add 3/4 t. of baking powder & 2 T. instant powdered dry milk to make the dough extra soft. Also, if you have the time to let the dough rise for about an hour,then punch it down & roll it out, it gets even better!!

Awesome crust!  Will never buy boxed again.  Didn't have bread flour(what is bread flour?) so I used all purpose and it turned out great.  Next time I will add some seasoning as the other members suggested.

This crust is very slow to cook.  Even after half an hour of varying temperatures and rack positions it still comes out under-baked.  Will not be making this again.

Wow! I have been using this recipe at least twice a month for awhile now and just realized I haven't rated it. This is a nice easy recipe and my kids love it! I usually double it for a nice thick crust and bake it on a pizza stone sprinkled with cornmeal. I let the dough rest for at least 15 minutes before rolling/patting it out. Adding herbs to the dough enhances the flavor, but it stands well on its own too. I also used this recipe for a kids "make your own pizza" birthday party.

I've made pizza for years and this is my favorite crust recipe.  After you've added your toppings, try brushing some olive oil on the outside edge of the crust to give it a nice flaky texture.  You can also sprinkle some parmesan cheese or herbs on after you brush on the oil for a little extra flavor.  Tastes better than take-out!

I changed the sugar to a tablespoon, made this with half all-purpose flour and half "light" flour (White Lily all purpose light white flour), and let it rise a half hour.  I did have to knead in more flour to make it less sticky.  Then I greased a large pie plate with olive oil, formed the crust in it, and then oiled the top of the crust again before I topped it.  It made a wonderful fluffy deep dish pizza.  Not too doughy, not chewy, and crunchy on top.  I've been looking for a recipe like this for a long time.

this recipe is great. i follow it exactly. i've made many pizzas using this and it always turns out great. i like to smear on minced garlic and chopped basil (i just thaw those little frozen cubes you can buy from the grocery store) on the crust before the tomato sauce to flavour the crust a bit more.

Very easy to make, and a good basic flavor.  Would've been better with something special added, like some parmesan around the edges, or herbs mixed in, because it does taste somewhat plain.  Also, I poked fork holes in the crust and prebaked it for 5 minutes before adding toppings, hoping it would come out very well done;  this helped a little, but I recommend prebaking for 10 minutes or so if you like a less doughy crust (this was on an aluminum pizza pan).  Much better than pre-made crusts or store-bought packages of crust mix!
Added: Originally reviewed 01/2004 and have been making this since, recently tried with whole wheat flour. Can be a little dry, but makes a nice crisp thin crust.

This recipe is so easy my handicapped daughter can make it by herself.  I keep a big jar of spaghetti sauce and a big bag of mozzarella cheese from Costco in the fridge so she can make it whenever she wants.  She makes the best pizza!

A million thanks. This is a very satisfactory recipe. The outer edge and underside of the crust was crunchy, and the inside very chewy. It was an easy dough to handle, and fit nicely on a pizza stone.  Honestly, it's not quite as good as a dough made from a recipe that requires 2 hours from start to finish (complete with rising time), but I needed a quick recipe this afternoon, and this was wonderful for the minimal time and effort; I think it took a little less than half an hour from the time I started measuring the flour to the time I took the finished pizza from the oven. I will absolutely keep this recipe on file and use it when I'm short on time.

This by far the quickest, easiest pizza dough recipe I have ever tried (and I've made LOTS of pizza in my time!)  While it doesn't have all the subtle nuances of a traditional dough (that is allowed to rise)it certainly beats store bought and even most pizza places.  This one is definitely a winner!

This crust is fast, easy, and good!  It made my first try at pizza making a breeze.  My fiancé was so surprised, as was I!  We decided to make our own pizza from now on.  I can't believe it's SO easy!  Thanks a bunch. (:

Easy!! Quick!! I love this for a quick pizza. It turned out perfectly and I wouldn't change a thing.  I followed the directions exactly and used a pizza stone.  It was a nice texture and flavor. I may add some herbs and cheese next time.

Best pizza dough I've made, and it was also the easiest! Great flavor and a good chewy texture. I pricked the dough with a fork and baked in the oven for 7 mins to get a little crispy before putting on sauce and toppings!

If you love thin crust pizza just prepare it the same way but divide the dough into two sections. You will end up with 2 tin crust pizzas just take care when you roll out the dough so you don't tear the dough. Time in oven drops a bit also. More like 13- 15 minutes with the thin crust.

Light  tender crust. Made it on a cornmeal dusted pizza stone.
Spread dough to the full pizza stone. Put on olive oil, fresh thinly sliced tomatoes, fresh garlic, green and ripe olives, Parmesan cheese, and topped with fresh mozzarella cheese. Wonderful!

This was amazing and FAST.  I had no idea you could make such a great pizza crust in half an hour.  I substituted 1/4 cup of semolina for all-purpose flour, which I used instead of bread flour.  This was excellent!

This crust is MARVELOUS!!!!  I doubled the recipe.   My Grandkids made their own pizza's, Personal pan size, and had a blast doing so.  Additionally, I made a huge Calzone and another pizza which would equate to a medium at a pizza shop.  My family LOVE, LOVEs this crust... Thank you!!!!!!!

Great recipe as other mentioned it multiplies well.  Here are some things I do that I think makes a better pizza:
Use a high-gluten flour, trust me this is the difference between ho-hum and "Oh my goodness this is amazing"
Use olive oil it tastes better--if you are making a lot (which we do) use half olive oil/half veggie oil to save money
Make sure the water used is the same rules as baby formula, warm but not hot against the under side of your wrist.  This is about 100 degrees, 110 will feel hot. I find 90 degrees not as good
Mixing (there's a trick for a better dough): 
- mix with a dough hook.
- put 3/4 of the flour in, mix for 6 minutes at a slow speed then add the rest, mix for 4 minutes. 
-- for the 4 minute stage let the additional flour combine then increase the speed, to about twice the speed
-- the dough should not be sticky so, add little additions of flour until it's silky to the touch but not sticky.
-Use the highest temperature your oven will go, a real pizza oven is 800 degrees, most ovens will only do 500.  
--The goal is to cook quickly so that you get a firm crust but chewy interior. Pizza will cook faster, and in non-convection you will need to move them around the oven to get the to cook evenly, every couple minutes.  
--Note at this temperature non-stick coatings will become poison as they melt, use only uncoated pans 
- Roll out dough use corn meal instead of flour to expand, this will give the bottom a nice texture without drying out the dough

This was my first attempt at homemade pizza crust and using yeast. This gets 5 stars for ease. I had no idea it was so easy to whip up pizza crust & this was even nicer to roll out than frozen or refrigerated pizza dough. Taste-wise, it was just ok. Mine didn't come out very flavorful & the consistency was pretty soft, not chewy at all. Maybe it needed to bake longer? IDK. You've inspired me & given me confidence to try other recipes, tho. Thank you :)

Very easy and is absolutely serviceable as written.  You will get better results if you let the dough sit for about 25 minutes before shaping it.  To make mine, I really enjoy putting in Italian seasonings, onion powder...anything I'm in the mood for.  Oftentimes I'll shape and parbake the crusts - just be sure to use a fork to poke holes in the bottom of the crust so you don't get bubbles - and bake for about half of the time.  Once cool, you can wrap and then freeze them and then bake when you like.  I like to brush my crusts with garlic butter before baking and then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese after.  I'm going to go mix up some right now!!

Loved this recipe! My mom thought it would not rise but she was soooooooo wrong! It rises in the oven making a beautiful homemade pizza crust that is much quicker than the traditional pizza crust that we usually make!

I use this recipe any time I make a pizza, but I use a mixture of white, wheat, and spelt flours to get a grainy, nutty taste, plus I like the variety.  I even toss a generous amount of oregano in there, and sometimes even cheese. Finally, before baking, I coat the exposed crust at the edges with a bit of olive oil so that it crisps up in the oven.  Gives it a nice texture and color.

Even faster next time! Using this recipe, prepare ahead a double or quadruple recipe:

1. Mix the flour and olive oil until it is crumbly with no damp spots.
2. Stir in the yeast, sugar, and salt.

Store refrigerated. Use 2.75 cups of the mix with 1 cup of 'quite hot' tap water, and stir/knead it into dough. It's that easy. 

Perfect for kids who want to cook independently. I also use it for easy rolls, deserts, dumplings, and anything else that I just want a basic, quick, yeast dough to get me started on.

A great, quick and easy recipe! My son did most of the work for it, it was so simple. Sure-the flavor was lacking a bit, but if you are needing something quick like this then no complaints! 

I will add some herbs &/or cheese to the crust next time per other reviewers tips. This is going in my printed recipe box!

Exactly what I was looking for.  It's fast and easy. I did let it rise a bit longer than the recipe stated, but only because I just happened to let that happen. Pizza was done in 30 minutes. It takes longer than that to get take-out.  Will be using this again and again.

i would give this a perfect five if the crust didn't come out so bland. totally agree that you need to season it before sticking it in the oven. besides that, this is by far the easiest and quickest pizza crust recipe out there. i love how you don't need to spend time kneading and waiting for it to rise. since i had time to spare, i did let it sit for about 30 minutes, and it had already more than doubled in size. i followed the rest of the recipe to a T - baked it on my pizza stone for 15 min, and the crust was crispy on the inside and chewy on the outside. just how i like it!

Great quick and easy dough recipe whip it out in a few minutes and can use it after letting it rise or even a day later when kept in the fridge.  Actually the flavors develop more when you use it a day later so I always double the recipe

Easy to make and delicious. It's a win-win! I will note that the first time, I used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour and it still turned out great. The second time, 2 cups all-purpose and 1/2 cup wheat flour which was also good. The second time I forgot to let it sit for 5 min after mixing and it was sticky so make sure you don't skip that part! I also just used flour instead of cornmeal on the baking sheet.

I've used it for my homemade pizzas for a long time now and I love it. I've memorized it, people get excited for pizza night when they see me setting it up, and I've had compliments such as, "Never gonna order another overpriced pizza again!"

Very easy, and always turns out great.  I personally allow it to rise since I usually have the time if I make the crust in the late morning/early afternoon... if I don't then making it with out rising (like the recipe intended) is just as good too!!  I just like making things ahead of time... anyway, I add a garlic herb seasoning to the crust every time and it is sooo good!!  I make pizza and stromboli with this recipe!!  Mmmm!

This is a very good recipe, but I would highly recommend pre-baking the crust for about five minutes then adding the toppings to cook. As a personal preference I like melting 2 tablespoons of butter in a pan, removing the pan from head and adding 1-2 cloves of minced garlic. After the butter has cooled for a few minutes, brush the crust with the mixture. The crust will turn out brown, crisp and delicious.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it was good, but mostly because there is no waiting period for it to rise.  My usual pizza dough takes about 2 hours.  I still like my regular crust recipe better, but this one can't be beat for those times when you don't prepare ahead of time.  We made calzone, and got 4 from this recipe.

Made this with whole wheat flour only, and it was quite tasty! I also added a heavy shake of italian seasonings as suggested by others. I wanted a thin crust, so I divided this in 2, and froze one half for next time. Money saving recipe for sure, and much healthier than anything from the store! Thanks for sharing!!

Delicious and easy to make. Used my kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook and turned out perfect. Used a little extra flour to get it off hook and shaped without sticking but the dough didn't get tough. Saved this as my go-to quick pizza dough, yay!

Great pizza crust recipe!
I used all purpose flour because that is what I had and it turned out fine. So easy to make,.. I won't be buying any dough from the bakery anymore!!!

I think the recipe itself is great - especially if you use it in an oven.  I tried to use this for the grill and had a hard time getting the very sticky dough transferred from my cookie sheet to the grill in a nice shape.  This recipe didn't lend itself well to moving from the cookie sheet.

While this is a great tasty pizza crust when you need something fast, the quantity should be adjusted to TWO crusts.  Even spreading it out on an 16" pizza stone, there was a LOT of dough.   I would use this to easily make TWO 14" crusts or TWO 16" thin crust pizzas.

This was delicious & soo easy to make!! I've never made pizza dough before & wanted to make calzones but didn't want to stop for dough at the store so I tried this. The only thing I did different was to add 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning & 1/4 tsp onion powder to the dry dough. Then I let it rise for 30 mins punched it down & put it in the fridge till I was ready for it & before baking brushed olive oil with some garlic powder mixed in over the top to help it brown. Absolutely perfect!!!!!! Going to make more & freeze it for even easier dinners :-)

Pretty good base recipe.  I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and added some Italian seasoning herb mix to the flour.  Maybe it's the climate here but I've usually had to add 1/3 to 1/2 a cup of extra water to get a dough that will stick together and not be separate crumbs and pieces. This recipe makes enough to cover a large cookie sheet. I turn the oven temp down a little to 425 since I use a dark nonstick cookie sheet. I've made this several times now and it comes out nicely each time. I use 2 c all purpose white flour and 1/2 c wheat flour for a light wheat crust.  Being lazy, I don't beat the ingredients, just stir, and don't turn out onto a floured surface but just turn out onto the pan, flour my hands and the lump of dough, and shape the dough there on the pan. Also, I let the dough rest 15 min instead of 5. This crust doesn't compare to the best restaurant crusts or to the California Pizza Kitchen recipe I've made before in my Cuisinart, but it's very good, fast and easy and my DH likes it alot.

This recipe was amaaaaazzing, and so easy and quick too! Definitely will be making it again. The only thing I did different was I put butter, Parmesan, and Italian seasoning around the rim of the dough. I believe using the bread flour (like the recipe says) instead of all purpose like I've done before makes all the difference.

Super easy! After mixing everything, I covered it with saran wrap and then a towel and let it rise for about 5-10 minutes. The dough was so easy to work with. It was a little too hydrated in the altitude, but after adding more flour it worked out great. Now that we've got a foundation, we'll start trying to add herbs for more flavor

In a word: Awesome. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and took the advice of other reviewers to add some spices (garlic, onion, basil, oregano). The BF said it was better than delivery!

I loved this recipe, and made a delicious alfredo spinach clam pizza with it, using wheat flour. The crust was too thick, though, and next time, I will use this recipe to make TWO pizzas.

I have been looking for a good bread stick recipe, so I decided to try using a pizza crust. This recipe results in a very soft and delicious bread stick! I rolled it to a 9"x11" rectangle (it was the only shape that fitted in my baking pan). I baked it at 450 F for around 18 minutes. It may be because I'm at high altitude, but it needed a few more minutes than that. I sprinkled mozzarella cheese and oil prior to baking. After removing from the oven, I spread some butter along with an oil mix I made (oil, garlic powder, and onion powder). Very delicious!

I love this recipe! It is very good for when you need pizza dough quick. I will say - I tend to favor chewy crusts as opposed to crispy...if you like really light airy crispy crust, this recipe is not for you. It is more dense. I love it! As many reviewers have already said, I also add italian herbs and garlic to the crust for more flavor. This dough also works for making calzones and breadsticks, etc.

All time fav! I use 1 cup bread flour half and 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and cut out the olive oil it came out amazing...the entire family loved it! Thxs so much for posting this one :) 

FYI this can make either a 14" regular crust portion or a thinner (18") pizza - either tastes great just remember slightly less cooking time on that thinner one!

Not Sure why this crust received great reviews, it is mediocre at best. We found it bland and on the dry side. We've tried some yeast free recipes on this site  when pressed for time and they were superior.

Great for quick and easy meals. I can't get bread flour where I live and it works fine with normal all purpose flour. To add flavour, I sometimes add dried herbs (oregano, basil).

This was my first attempt at making pizza dough, but I've been wanting to try for a while, so I had all the ingredients on hand.  It was super quick, fun to make with the kids, and soooo yummy!  I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups of bread flour, other than that, I followed the recipe exactly!  DELICIOUS!

so easy and so good!  I doubled recipe and made for new years eve.  we all rollled out and made our own individual pizza's. it was so fun!  dough puffs up quite a bit while cooking so thin it out unless you love thick crust.  tastes great! will definitely do again.

I made this crust this evening and it was excellent.  I added 1 TBSP italian dipping herbs to the flour.  Topped it with some organic sauce, left over ham, onion & mushrooms.  Paired it with my favorite Hawaiian lager.  Oh yeah!  Will definitely be making this again.

This recipe turned out great :) Exactly what I was looking for - great quality, less time. I switched out half the bread/AP flour with some wheat flour to make it healthier. Just wonderful :)

I made this crust, added some herbs (oregano, basil, etc), rolled it into a square about a half inch thick, filled half with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni; folded and pressed the edges together; brushed melted butter over the top; and baked for 14 min at 450 degrees. It came out great! You can fill it with any toppings you would normally put on a pizza.

There is nothing particularly spectacular about the taste of this crust, but it's easy to make and the texture is great.  Good go-to crust in a pinch.

This wasn't the best. Honestly, we didn't think it was any better than the pizza dough balls you can get at the grocery store. We did a little taste test with this & the Homemade pizza & dough recipe on this site. It was better than that recipe, but nothing fantastic. It is super easy and "homemade" but taste wise it just isn't that great. Not horrible, just not great. Also~ my oven has never seemed to run hot, but at 450 my crust had burned all along the bottom in 14 mins. Just a heads up!

I prepared this tonight with 2 of my 3 kids.  My 4 & 7 year olds.  It was easy & tasted GREAT!  A few notes on our specifics: 1) I used All Purpose Flour since that what we had & it was wonderful; 2) I added 1 tsp each of garlic powder & Italian seasoning & this added a nice flavor as well as color with the green flecks that all three of my kids mentioned; 3) I used a lightly flour dusted 15" Pampered Chef pizza stone & rolled the dough onto it & it was perfect.  Summary: GREAT RECIPE; SOME FLEXIBILITY IN PREP; HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

Absolutely delicious.  I used this recipe to make the Taco Pizza from this site and my family & I loooooovvvveedddd it.  I baked it until golden brown at 425 degrees and it came out great.  The crust was crispy yet tender.  I took the advice of others and added additional spices to the dough (garlic & onion powder, italian seasoning & parseman cheese).  I put everything together earlier today and allow to rise in the fridge until we needed it (~ 2 hours).

Should be called Super Quick Supler Easy Pizza Crust!!! 4x the recipe for pizza on the bbq.  Each recipe made 4 personal sized pizzas.   Came together so quickly.  Have extra flour on hand for slightly kneading and rolling out.  Let the dough rest before trying to form into your crust. To bbq pizzas:  roll out pizza (doesn't have to be perfect, but try for even thickness).  Brush with EVOO and put oil side down on a hot grill. Brush this side with EVOO now. The crust will not melt through the grate, I promise.  Check frequently for the desired doneness and remove (cooked side up) to a plate for toppings (precooked toppings are best because they wont cook on the bbq they will only melt).  When topped, put uncooked side down on the grill (I put them on the top rack for melting and then transfered them to the direct heat for crisping the underside of the crust).  Now that's amore!

This pizza crust was very good! I added some Pizza Spice mix from Penzey's in the crust, along with some extra garlic & onion powder. It's also a very oily dough (no kneading needed!), and I did add about 1/2 cup more flour. I like that the dough doesn't need to be precooked, yet comes out perfectly cooked, even with plenty of sauce and toppings. Yum!

this is a fantastic recipe!  I have been searching for a no-rise crust that is thick and soft and fluffy and here it is!  I did add onion powder, oregano, and basil to crust as other reviewers have suggested and it turned out great.  Will be adding this one to the family cookbook for sure!

I made this recipe for supper tonight. And WOW! I made the other quick recipe that had more reviews and it was ok; but this was fantastic for a no-rise quick crust. Because I live in the desert and it is very hot and dry right now I did increase the water by about 1.5 tbsp and added an extra 1 tsp oil. I couldn't find my olive oil so I used veg oil instead. I gave a little whisk w/ my fingers to the yeast,sugar,& water to help dissolve and spread it out. It bloomed very quick. I added the rest of the ingredients (using a dipping/shaking sifting method for flour) which I used all purpose since only had 1/4. C. Bread flour. I hand mixed the ingredients just so they were incorporated and let it sit as suggested. The other time I made this I 'overworked' the dough and it made it very elasticky b/c of the gluten and being overmixed. I formed it into a ball w/ lightly floured hands and onto a floured surface, I rolled it and trimmed the excess dough using a pizza cutter so it would fit my pan I lightly oiled; and when on the pan light brush of oil too. I used the trimmed pieces and twirled together into breadstick braids, onto parchment sprayed w/ cooking spray on top. Baked w/ pizza; keep an eye on breadsticks- mine were done about 5 mins before the pizza. I then brushed w/ melted butter & sprinkled w/ garlic salt and Parmesan when done baking the breadsticks. Served w/ rest of leftover spaghetti sauce not used on pizza.My son loved it.Thank you chef rider for a fantastic recipe.

This recipe has become my friday night special ever since I have found it.  It is easy and incredibly good.  It is best to use the bread flour as suggested.  After putting on the toppings, I allow the pizza to rise again for about 45 minutes for a deep crust.  So good and so easy.  Thanks!

This is my go-to pizza crust recipe.  I sub in whole wheat flour and it turns out really well.  It's super quick and easy and I always have the ingredients in my cupboard.  I keep pre-portioned pizza sauce in the freezer ready to go, so when I can't figure out what to make for dinner, this is usually it!

We followed the recipe just as stated, the dough was perfect and it was pretty good!  I would have to agree, it was slightly bland so maybe I will follow advice from others and add some Italian seasoning and garlic powder.  Really nice recipe!

Great recipe! Easy too!!! I needed a quick bread recipe to go with my lasagna tonight - this fit the bill.  I made the crust into bread sticks, adding italian seasionings & brushing with olive oil.  My family loved them.  Thanks for sharing!

Great! I divide the dough to make 2 pizzas, as we like a thinner crust. I prebaked the crust on a cookie sheet (lowest oven rack position) for a few minutes, then added the toppings and baked the pizza directly on oven rack until it was done. This makes a nice, crisp crust that can "stand up" to the overload of toppings we add!  This is becoming a weekly staple at our house!

Excellent! I never made my own pizza dough before. I only made one change, I used 1c ww flour in place of one of the cups of bread flour. DH still got a slightly high blood sugar reading that night (we usually try to avoid white flour but I didn't want to change this too much) but we were all very pleased with this recipe. I always have a hard time stretching pizza dough and this one was tough too but it did work :)

Wonderful. The best pizza crust I have made yet. Always very elastic and easy to spread on the pan. I add a tsp. Italian spice to the olive oil first. Usually I have to add a little more flour, a little at a time so it's not too sticky.

I didn't have any issues with the dough being sticky as some other reviews stated. It was actually a little more on the crumbly side. I rolled the dough into a ball, put it center on my pizza pan, rolled it out with a rolling pan and then with with hands just made it a little more into a circle. I like that it doesn't need to rise forever.

This crust is EXCELLENT! I read through some of the reviews and added an extra tsp of sugar like mentioned to help add a little lift to the dough when cooking. Ended up proofing the yeast for more like 10-15 minutes instead of 5 as my son and I were shredding cheese and cutting pepperoni at the same time.  Took a little less flour than called for. Greased baking stone and sprinkled with cornmeal and garlic powder before pressing out dough. Did stuffed crust pizza by pressing dough out about 1/2" past edge of stone and wrapping over string cheese (used about 8 pieces). Brushed melted butter over stuffed crust edge, spread sauce on crust and then sprinkled pizza seasoning and parmesan over all before adding cheese, pepperoni & mushrooms. Baked at 425 for about 15 minutes, then let rest for a few before cutting. Was delicious, easy and quick (45 minutes from start to finish with a 6 year old doing most of the work). Oh, I also doubled the recipe and got 2 large thin stuffed crust pizzas from it. Hubby raved about it - and he's picky about pizza. All in all - success! :)

Well, it was quick and easy, but not memorable. The dough was very thick and hard to roll out. Once it was baked the texture was closer to cardboard than crust. I much prefer the other popular crust recipe on this site.

Turned out better than I expected.  When 2 recipes I tried using a bread machine, turned out sticky and terrible, I used this quick recipe as a last resort before having to ditch the effort.  It worked!

Very good, easy, and quick. I had some trouble getting it thin enough/spreading it on the pizza stone, but the flavor was great and everyone liked it! Really would have given 5 stars, but not as good as my favorite pizzeria's crust!

I always cook it at 425 and it cooks more evenly than at 450. 

Love it!  It's a great balance between rising for a long time and putting it in the pan right away. The kids love it. It's a bready crust.

Quick, easy and scrumptious!  I needed some garlic bread to go with our pasta meal so I prepared this pizza dough and pressed it onto a baking stone.  Then I melted a stick of butter, added garlic powder, parsley and parmesan cheese and brushed it over the crust.  I baked it per the instructions and then sliced it into bread sticks.  Absolute fabulous!  The crust was crisp and chewy on the outside, soft on the inside.  I'm going to use it for actual pizza tonight -- should be excellent.  Thanks for sharing this time-saving recipe!

This is a quick and easy dough to make, although very sticky for the little bit of kneading involved.  I used a well floured counter and floured my hands generously.    I also added rosemary, a bit of dried parsley, garlic powder and cracked black pepper as I prepared the dough.  I used a large rectangular pyrex casserole dish for a dough batch of dough.  I made a hearty, homemade sauce with large chunks of tomatoes, whole black olives and fresh Spanish onions.  I went heavy on the mozz. cheese and added parmesan and red pepper flakes to the top.  I montinored the oven temperature well and checked on the pizza several times to be the crust was not burning and that the ingredients were cooking nicely.  Ended up with a 35 minute back time after taking the temp. down to 300 for the last 10 mins.  It turned out pretty darned good.  Next time, I am going to stuff the crust with cheese.  Yum!

I was craving for some BBQ chicken pizza and decided to make my own. It was my FIRST TIME making a pizza ever and I was STOKED! This pizza crust is sooo easy to make it's ridiculous! The only thing I will do different is cooking it for a little bit longer (like 25-30 minutes?). I was afraid of burning the toppings so I didn't leave it in there as long as I wanted to. I felt like it wasn't cooked all the way so it tasted a bit funny to me, but it can also be the BBQ sauce.

The best and quickest pizza crust recipe I have ever found! The only changes I have made are adding some rosemary, basil and garlic to the mix. I also have found that prebaking the crust for 10 minutes before topping helps the middle of the pizza cook though. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

We made this a gluten free casein free pizza! I used a Gluten Free All Purpose flour (rice flour, potato starch, and tapioca flour) and found I had to add 1/4 cup more water. I took other peoples suggestions and add basil, oregano and onion powder.   My daughter is 11 and has Celiac and my son is 6 and has been diagnosed with Autism.  Pizza was one thing we could never have a yummy GFCF version of until now! Thank you for sharing!

I have made this three times now and I get two pizzas out of this recipe. The first two times i felt it was a bit on the thin side but delicious all the same. The third time I made it, I added an extra tsp of sugar to the warm water.By doing this, the yeast proofed better.So as a result , the dough rose a bit bigger during the 5 minute rest period. The results were much better. Overall definitely use this recipe if you don't have time to wait for the dough to rise!!

Sooooo simple. I let it rise a little longer and the crust was thicker and lighter. I used half wheat flour once, and it was good, but all white flour was definitly better.

This was the easiest pizza crust I've ever made, and very tasty. I used two 8" cake pans, to make "deep dish" style pizza. I baked for 15 minutes @ 450 on the bottom rack, and both pizzas turned out great.

Just make sure when you roll the dough out its thin before you cook it. Otherwise it will be too much like eating bread and pizza.

This was really good.  The perfect hamemade pizza dough.  I doubled the recipe and had to add a little extra flour (about half a cup).

This pizza crust is great and the best part is I don't need a lot of preparation time. I add garlic powder, pepper and salt to the crust to add some extra taste. I also par-bake (5min at 450F) the crust before adding the toppings just so I get a really crunchy crust. You can also freeze left over dough to use another time.

I've made this recipe over 20 times, and it comes out beautiful and delicious each time. Roommates, family and hubby all say it tastes like heaven. A great pizza crust - beats out the ones that have to rise for forever every time! This is my go-to pizza crust 10 for 10. Thanks for the recipe! For fun I'll add garlic or onion to the crust and make a cheese bread by just topping with mozzarella and cheddar cheese and some more garlic powder. Fantastic!

This crust is great.  It is light and fluffy and doesn't take very long at all.  But, after you roll it out, the longer you leave it, the thicker it will be.  So let it rise after you roll it out for as long as you can.  I try for at least an hour.  But you can use it as soon at it is rolled out too which is why it is great, even at the last minute.  I also mix in some whole wheat flour, 1/2 or less.

I agree with most of the other raters - this is a great go-to recipe when you want home made pizza fast.  I might try the slower rising type to see if I can tell the difference, but this is definitely a keeper.  Thanks.

Didn't really care for this since it was a soft, bendable crust.  I would love to find a chewy crust like it cane out of a brick oven!

I just made this pizza dough two different ways.  The first time i followed the directions but i added a few spices to the dough. The result was a soft but sturdy crust.  The second time i let it rise for a while.  Although the second batch texture was slightly better, the dough expanded so much that i would have preferred making two smaller pizzas instead of one.  A very quick an easy recipe whether you let it rise or not.  This is a keeper.

Was easy to make with ingredients in my pantry already. I added italian herbs and garlic to the mixture. Be careful to mix well so that you don't get clumps of crusty flour. I'm thinking that flour mixture should be added to the wet mixture an not the other way around. I doubled the recipe and then split it up to make personal pizzas that the kids made themselves. Turned out YUMMY! We also used a can of Hunt's spaghetti sauce that is sold for a dollar!

LOVE IT!  Quick, easy, very tasty.  Have tried different herbed olive oils - all give a unique flavour to the crust.  No more bought pizza crusts for me!

My family really enjoyed this.  It was my first attempt at pizza dough and it was very easy as promised.  I took the advice of others and added some spices to it as well as subsituting some of the bread flour for whole wheat.  I also precooked it for a few minutes since we like out pizza with extra sauce and didn't want it to be doughy underneath.  It all worked out well.  I doubled the recipe so I could freeze half for later!

This crust is very easy to make, how easy alone is worth many stars. The crust itself was nothing great in my opinion though. I made as noted the first time and thought it to bland and crispy. The 2nd time I added herbs to the oil as suggested by someone else, rolled it smaller so it would be thicker and baked it a few minutes less. It still wasn't chewy like we were going for. I will keep looking, but will keep this handy when I want something quick and good enough!

This a great recipe if you like thick crust. We like thin crust, so I cut the recipe in half, except for the yeast which I cut to 1/2 tsp. Skip the first step. Mix all the dry ingredients, then add the oil and warm water and mix with a fork until just moistened. Form a ball, cover and let rest for 5 - 10 minutes. Follow step 3. Voila! The perfect thin crust.

I have used this recipe at least a dozen times now.  It is one of the few recipes I don't have to do a thing too.  I love the ease of this.  Whip it up in 15 mins and have pizza in 30 mins.  We now have homemade pizza at least once a month if not 2.  Such a treat for the kids and so much healthier w/little to no salt and no preservatives.  I have also used this recipe for fried donuts on a weekend morning.  Works great for that as well.

This a really good crust recipe and I've tried quite a few.  I added a few shakes of Italian seasoning, sea salt, and some of that Kraft Parmesan cheese, you know the stuff that comes in the shakers. I didn't use any corn meal or anything but I did roll out the dough on parchment paper then slid the whole thing onto my pizza stone. I plan to try all sorts of seasoning combos in the future and see what I can do.

AWESOME, kickin', incredible, life changing pizza crust!!! :-) The reason I say life-changing is because I usually am never able to make pizza crust since I always used the bread machine...by the time I got home, never enough time to load machine and let it rise, etc. With this recipe, I skip all that and can make last-minute homemade pizza. ** I added 1 tsp of onion powder, 1 tsp of garlic powder and @ 1 tsp of pizza seasoning or oregano, used garlic olive oil and let it rise that extra 20 minutes or so.....truly better then my old stand-by that takes forever!!

This is the first pizza crust I have ever made, I was suprised by how easy it was! I only made a small change, I added about a teaspoon of garlic salt and a half teaspoon of garlic powder to the flour mixture for a more zesty crust! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Finally a pizza crust that cooperated with me!  I went ahead and doubled it to make two crusts. While I was finishing spreading the second in the pizza shell the first was already rising. Both pizza shells were ready for toppings within less than 30min.  First time I've made pizza so quickly.  I used a jar of pesto for my sauce and then added my veggies, parmesan & cheddar cheese. Delicious!

This is just what I was looking for.  I'd never made my own crust before trying this recipe, and I was really proud of the result!  I added a little onion powder and some basil per other reviewer's suggestions, and it really made a difference.

I love this recipe! It's so simple that now I make pizza all the time. My secret to making this crust even better: I substitute garbanzo bean flour for 1/2 c of the regular flour. It makes it just a little bit heartier and textured. Thanks!

Very good and very easy!  You may want to add some spices or parmesan cheese to liven it up.

I think you need to use all white flour. I used half whole wheat and it was not so great.

We use this recipe every Friday nite for our pizza night!  I added some spices to make it more our speed, but it's great as is.  For our taste we add 1 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp thyme, and 1/2 tsp basil and substitute the salt for garlic salt.  To top our off, I add 2 tbsp Parmesan cheese while kneading the dough prior to use and it comes out spectacular.  A friend even went so far as to say our pizza was "Better than Old Chicago's", high praise indeed!

Great pizza crust! I needed to come up with a quick-fix dinner option last night. My bf was craving burgers and I was craving pizza. It was too chilly to grill, so we compromised and created a cheeseburger pizza using this recipe for the crust (viola!). I will NEVER buy a store-bought crust again (Boboli doesn't even have one up on this!!!)! I wanted to use my pizza stone, but couldn't find my pizza peel, so I just used my Faberware pizza sheet instead (but I did place it on top of my heated baking stone...). I lightly greased my pan with Pam and then dusted it with a bit of cornmeal. The dough was VERY sticky, but easy to shape with floured hands. Next time, I'll add some spices (i.e. oregano, basil, garlic powder, etc.) as others did - I just didn't think those spices would go well with cheeseburger pizza (but I did combine a little veg oil/garlic powder and brushed it on the crust)! This crust is good as is... no need for spices unless you like them (IMHO). Oh, and you've got to like thick and puffy crusts (similar to Chef Boyardee crust). This will become my "staple" crust recipe. Thanks for sharing :)

My real rating for this recipe would be 4 3/4 stars, if I could do such a thing.  I followed the original directions (no extra resting time or herbs; the only difference was that I used Kosher salt, because I always do) and got a 12 inch crust that was a nice thickness, crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside.  The texture of this crust is FANTASTIC.  The single slight problem I had with this dough is that my batch had a VERY yeasty flavor.  I like the flavor of yeast bread a lot, but the yeast was slightly overpowering, possibly because I did just some veggie and olive oil toppings without sauce or cheese.    Overall, especially for the speed and ease with which this can be made, this recipe is really great.

Pretty good as is, and a great quick alternative to traditional pizza crusts. If you plan on making a fairly large pizza (which this recipe will make) then I would suggest pre-baking it for 7-8 minutes before adding the toppings. My large one didn't get cooked all the way through before the toppings started to get burned, but the small ones came out fine after 20 minutes. I also think that I'll let the crust rise a little more next time.

What a great recipe.  I did what others suggested and added my favorite spices to the oil and then mixed it into the yeast mixture.  Then I added the flour 1c at a time and when it was completeley in (I doubled the recipe) I used the dough hook on my kitchen aid mixer, turned it on 4 and let it "knead" for 5 minutes.  Then I rolled it out and placed in stone baking pans for "pan pizza".  WOW!  The family RAVED and both pizza's... GONE.  We'll definately make this over and over.  Thank you!

I have made this crust several times now, and it always turns out great.  I did make the addition of some italian seasoning and garlic powder.  The texture of the crust is great, and I have divided the crust into two balls and rolled them out seperately for thin crust pizzas.  Worked great especially if you sprinkle your baking stone with cornmeal first. Very pizzeria notable.  This recipe is a definate keeper!

This was a boon as it was too close to dinnertime for most crust recipes today. Following the reviews, I added seasonings (1/3 tsp garlic powder. 3/4tsp Italian Seasonings.) I microwaved the dry flour/salt/seasonings before adding the liquid/yeast as my pantry is very cool and the flour is too cold to rise this time of year otherwise (30 seconds was plenty). I precooked the crust for 8 minutes before topping, and baked another 15 after topping. A bit bland for my tastes, will increase seasonings next time. Crust crunchy at edges, golden on entire bottom with a chewier texture under toppings. This is a very good recipe for the time involved!

We love this thin crust. (we roll it out to be a thin crust) 
I always mix some melted butter with some garlic powder and parmesean cheese and spread it over the top of the dough before I add the sauce and toppings.

I just made a mac n cheese pizza using this dough recipe. It was quick and easy but the yeast flavor was a little strong.  Next time I'll add herbs, etc. to the dough. My kids loved it though... thanks for the recipe!

I had a great experience with this recipe.  I followed exactly as written and used bread flour; maybe that is the problem with some reviewers since bread flour will produce a chewier crust than A-P flour. The flours really aren't interchangeable for a pizza crust because the all-purpose flour has less protein than bread flour.

Pretty tasty and easy too!  I put some italian seasoning in it, and topped it with the Pesto Sauce recipe on this site, baby bella mushrooms, pepperoni, some leftover Newman's Vodka sauce, and plenty of mozzerella.   Next time I'm going to brush the crust with melted butter before topping it, this bread-y crust was a little too flour-y.  
Usually, I'd rather order pizza, but I thought making it myself could be a good way to use up leftovers from other meals.  Taco or BBQ chicken pizza anyone?  
If you're not fortunate enough to live in in an area of the country that has decent take out - you'll be a million times happier eating this pizza than lousy greasy chain delivery.

I knew this would be quick and easy to make... but I didn't know that meant I could make an entire pizza from scratch and have it in the oven within 20 minutes. ANNnnnd, it was really delicious too! The recipe said would yeild a soft and chewy crust, but I wouldn't say chewy... just soft and fluffy and perfect! We give it 10 stars. Thanks!

Oh my GOD!!!!!  I am an avid cook and most of my recipes come from Allrecipes.com, but I can say without a doubt that this is the BEST recipe I've ever gotten from this site!!!  I'd give it a hundred stars if I could.  

I have probably tried 6 or 7 different pizza crust recipes over the years, and had finally resigned myself to never being able to have real pizza again.  Because my husband and I eat a low-gluten diet, pizza crust has to be made from scratch with spelt flour, and none of the recipes I've found created a crust that was even remotely like delivery-pizza.  This one was so good that my husband is still raving about it even hours later!!  The only changes I made were to substitute white spelt flour for the bread flour, and to add 1 tsp. Mrs. Dash's Salt-Free Italian Seasoning and 1 tsp. garlic powder.  We topped it with "Easy Pizza Sauce I" from this site, smoked mozzarella cheese, and crumbled Italian turkey sausage, baked it for 15 minutes, and devoured every crumb.  My husband spent the whole time saying that the crust was even better than Pizza Hut's, which until now, was our favorite.  THANK YOU, CHEF RIDER!!!

This is a quick and easy pizza crust, but the finished product is just perfect to show off when you have friends over for an informal get-together. We like it very much and it's now the only crust we use. I would give it a "10" but the max is five stars. :)

Excellent recipe. I will confess to a phobia when working with yeast--it seems to present too many variables for my liking, but this turned out prefect.  I will say that, when I tried to pat/roll out the dough, it seemed too sticky and soft; likewise, once rolled, I could not easily transfer the shaped round onto the baking pan (it lost its shape and I re-rolled it once onto the greased baking pan).  I pressed on despite fearing the worst at this point.  Adding to my apprehension was the fact that I was using this as a base for a white pizza--the dough seemed again too soft when brusing on the olive oil and garlic sauce. Fortunately, my fears were unfounded and the resulting pizza was just perfect!  The crust had a perfect texture (the perfect happy medium between a thin crust and a thick crust) and was perfectly done throughout. I was also concerned about the crust having a "yeasty" taste, but it tasted just right.  I usually buy pre-made crusts, but this recipe may very-well put an end to that.

This recipe is super easy and really tasty (not to mention fast).  I always add a tablespoon or two of pizza seasoning to the crust, as it gives it an extra zip.  This crust is equal to any of the double rise crusts I've tried and is ready in less than half the time!

This crust was really good. Let the dough rise longer for a puffier crust. Everyone loved the pizza. I used canned pizza sauce and pepperoni, sausage and cheese for the toppings. Great recipe!

Not my favorite pizza crust so far.  Definitely fine in a pinch for time,though. EDIT:  I have since used this for BBQ Chicken Pizza II, and it was perfect!  I ended up letting the dough rest for about 20 minutes and it was much better this time.

This was very good and so easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems.  It made enough to fill a large rectangular pizza stone for a thick crust pizza.

This is some seriously good crust. It was perfect... crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. It browned perfectly and the taste was just amazing. I think I found *my* pizza crust recipe!

I was thrilled w/ this crust.  Tender and fluffy, yet rich and dense.  Perfect!  I added garlic powder and italian seasoning to the flour.  Let dough rise 30 min, poked holes and baked 10min, then topped and baked till bubbly. My husband thought the pizza was the best he'd ever tasted!  I love this recipe!

I've made several crusts from different recipes trying to find the right one. My search is over!  I used 2.5 teaspoons of yeast since I didn't have it prepackaged.  I put it on stone and allowed to rise about 30 minutes.  I baked 5 minutes, removed it from oven, topped it and baked 10 more.  Perfect pizza!

I have to admit, I had high hopes for this recipe. I also wasn't that pleased with it. I mean, it was edible... it just wasn't great. It tasted like I had bought a frozen pizza crust from the grocery store. I added some garlic powder to the crust, but it was still rather tasteless.

So easy! I have always had a tough time making good pizza crust, but I am so happy I tried this. I also let this rise for 1/2 hour, and baked it on a pizza stone & it was nicely brown & crispy. Maybe I will add a tad more salt next time or onion powder to give it some more depth. Thanks!

This is THE BEST, BEST pizza crust I have EVER made!!!  The name says it all--it is quick, it is easy and it surely is delicious!!! I have been trying for YEARS to find the right pizza crust, and this is finally it!!!!  But even better than that is how I used the crust tonite--I made a grilled pizza on my grill pan and it was TO DIE FOR!!!!  Here's what I did--I oiled my grill pan w/olive oil and got it screaming HOT.  After it got nice and golden brown on the one side, I flipped it over, added a thin layer of sauce, crumbled FRESH mozzarella, thin ribbons of FRESH basil, coarsely ground salt & pepper. I lowered the heat on the grill pan and let the bottom get a little brown and a little charred while the cheese melted.  It tasted like a woodfired pizza--WONDERFUL!!! You got to try it!!!  I also used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups bread flour in the recipe instead of all bread flour.  I am sorry this is so long but I am ECSTATIC right now!  Thanks!!!!!

I really love this pizza crust! It's really tasty and quicker than other recipes.  It has a really crispy crust and is just the right thickness.  I altered the recipe the second time I made it, with 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour and added italian seasoning to it.  It was great!  I am a pizza fanatic and this recipe will definately get lots of use!

This is a good, quick pizza crust. Perfect for nights when you don't feel like waiting for dough to rise twice.

I rated it 5 stars for that reason, but realize that it is not the thick, doughy kind. It reminds me more of CiCi's crust.

It also has really good flavor.

Really good crust. A nice "learning tool" recipe for children who are learning to cook. I made 2 crust one as recipe reads and the other was with spices, both of which turned out great, except I didn't roll the first crust out thin enough and it was more a "breadish" crust. I rolled the 2nd one out thinner and it was perfect! Thank you for a quick meal idea!

I have made this recipe four times since I found it on this website. My 5 kids love it and don't even want to order pizza out anymore. It has always turned out well and is so surprisingly easy and fast. My husband has been an italian chef for 17 years and he even gave it the thumbs up!

I made this using all whole wheat bread flour, and it turned out great! Its not going to be a "pizza hut pan-type crust", but it makes a great healthy crust to enjoy pizza with.  And, it made supper quick!  Thanks!

It was just all right. It tasted more like a biscuit crust than a pizza crust. It will do in a pinch, but I'd rather take the time to make the real deal.

giving this 5 rating for being exactly what recipe states....quick and easy.  Hubby wanted pizza and I didn't have time to rise the dough so found this.  I did add 1 tbsp. of roasted chopped garlic, a little more sugar to the crust.  I did let it rest for 15 minutes then spread it on the pan with a spatula.  It was more of a 'pourable' consistency.  It was a fluffy consistency.  Made 1 large round pie.  I am not sure what mix or store bought crust tastes like so don't have anything to compare it to, but in a pinch this is a great recipe that is no-fail.  Of course it does not have the taste of a dough that has gone through a rising, but all the same is very good and would recommend especially for busy moms or when the family wants pizza 'now'.  ***I would recommend pre-baking this one.  I had it in for 22 minutes and it was a little light on the bottom near the middle of the pan so just stuck it back in for another 7 minutes and it was fine.***

This was pretty good. It was my first time making pizza crust, and this recipe was indeed quick and easy. I'm not sure how it compares to other crusts on this site, but it is certainly better than the store brand. I added a touch of parmesan cheese to the mix, but I don't think it was a enough cos you could hardly tell. I used the crust for the Hummus Pizza recipe on this site, and it was quite good.

This was so good and easy.  I've always used those Jiffy crust mixes, and this is much better.  The recipe allowed for me to make a pretty good sized pizza with a nice thick crust.  I did let mine rest for about 20 minutes though.  I also pre-baked it for 5 minutes before adding my toppings so I'd get a crispier base.  And I sprinkled the edges with garlic powder and grated parmesan.  Fantastic.  I'll never use the boxed mix again.

I was looking for a quick pizza crust recipe and this did a perfect job. I was a little surprised at how the crust was still a bit doughy even though I spread it evenly across my pizza stone. I would put more interesting spices in it next time to try and give it a bit more of something special, but if this is all the time you've got this recipe is a great alternative.

Three years ago my family and I started a tradition of making pizza on Christmas Eve.  Thei first year I made this crust and a crust in the bread machine.  Believe it or not my family actually like this crust a whole lot more! I like to add a touch more olive oil and dried basil and oregano to the crust with the flour.

I've made this, several times. I add seasonings, and sometimes cheese, in the crust. I like to mix flours; I'll use about half all purpose, and half self-rising. I also section off the Pizza, and use everybody's favorite toppings on their section. It's awesome!! I have also cut up different varieties of cheese sticks, lined the edges of the crust with them, and folded the edge over the cheese sticks, making stuffed crust. It always tastes awesome, and doesn't have a lot of grease!!

Quick and easy! I have made it  twice with my kitchen-aid and beat it for a few minutes, let it rest, then beat it for another little bit and let it rest again because I had some time. Dough was smooth and stretchy and filled a cookie sheet about 75% and made about 10 smallish pieces of pizza but dough is pretty filling and could easily feed a family of 4 if you have a side. I probably will try doubling this next time, but it's fast enough to make two separate pizzas pretty quickly. I consider myself slow in the kitchen and not all that great at baking, but this recipe works for me and I keep coming back to it!

Baked at 375 when using it for individual pizzas. Daughters BF said these were like a gourmet restaurant pizza! I have also used the recipe for calzones...makes 4 good-sized ones. I made homemade meatball calzones one time, and white-sauced Mediterranean vegetarian ones, too. Also made focaccia. Everybody loves the versatility of this recipe. Thanks!

Absolutely loved this recipe. I did do it two ways. Thick crust made two large pizzas, thin crust made four medium pizzas.

I made no changes. Its delicious as is! Granted, it's not the greasy awesomeness that is Pizza Hut pizza crust, but it's super quick and easy at a fraction of the price and calories. What's not to love? Sure, the other more complicated doughs might taste a bit better, but this is SUPER quick, easy and delicious all in one. Thanks so much for sharing!

We've tried quite a lot of different doughs and this is pretty good and especially it is fast. I changed the flour for 1 cup of all-purpose and 1 cup of Italian "OO" flour. If you need to ask if it is worth the difference, try it  - it is ;-)

I followed the suggestion from another reviewer for doubling the recipe and adding basil, oregano, and onion powder to the olive oil before adding it to the bowl. (I did not double the seasoning.) Yum! Also brushed the outer crust with garlic powder olive oil before baking. This was delicious! (I tore about a fourth of the dough off and made breadsticks. Shaped it into a small rectangle and topped with cheese. My five year old loved them!)

Best crust recipe I've tried to date, and I've tried a lot. We bake a lot — pies, bread, our own croissants — and this recipe is as good as they come. 

I make it in our bread maker (nothing fancy), and try to leave it at least 40 mins or so. I roll it out on floured baking parchment as thin as I can get it, then roll the edge back over to make the crust. Slide a pizza spatula under the parchment, then slide into a hot pizza stone in the oven. I bake mine at 475F using the convection cycle in our oven, so about 500F without confection. It takes 8-10 minutes to cook, depending on how you like your pizza.

I've used half whole wheat flour and half bread flour and pre-baked my crust for 10 minutes before adding sauce/toppings. I've also used 2 1/4 tsp. jarred yeast in place of the packet of yeast since that's what I had on hand. The whole wheat flour and bread flour combination is totally worth it if you have both on hand! I haven't tried making it with just all-purpose flour.

This recipe has been a huge life-saver ! We recently found out that my husband has an aversion to soy thanks to G6PD deficiency, so we can't have most pre-prepared frozen pizzas or pizzas from a restaurant since most crusts contain a soy ingredient. This news was devastating to me since I LOVE pizza, so I went on a hunt for an easy, delicious, versatile pizza crust recipe and I found this lovely recipe. I'd never made my own pizza from scratch before and was a little intimidated by the thought of it, but this recipe was SO easy. Thank you for sharing!!

I followed this recipe precisely. So easy and very tasty. My husband, who typically always finds a way to tweak a first time recipe, loved it. Even my 3 year old ate it all up and, like most little ones, only wants the cheesy toppings. Thinking back on all the premade, store bought versions, we have tried this might actually be easier. And its not loaded with ingredients you can hardly pronounce. Highly recommended. Enjoy!

This was actually very easy as the title indicates. I took the advice of another rater and put in spices (onion power, basil, and oregano I believe) and brushed it with olive oil mi Ed with garlic. Smelled amazing but I think I made the crust too thin and/or cooked it too long since it turned out overly crispy. I remaining part of the dough a didn't use raised really well, so if not in a hurry waiting the extra time seems worth it. I froze it so I'll have to see once I make it again. Great recipie!

I hate the pizza places where we lived and decided one night to try making my own. This was the first pizza crust I have made and I loved it. I have made it a dozen times. 
its very easy and I like a thick chewy crust and I can easily do that with this recipe. 
The only downside is sometimes it's aggravating trying to flatten out the dough for the crust.  Its very sticky abd it doesn't seem to matter how much flour I have on my hands or the surface. I didn't take a star off for that because I also use all purpose flour,  so maybe that's why.

This recipe was easy to double.  I think the hardest part with homemade pizza is knowing when the dough in the middle is cooked through. The pizza was best after it had cooled for a while and the dough had a chance to set up.  I will use this recipe again.

Excellent and easy. We used this crust for mini pizza's to clean out the leftovers in the fridge. I let mine rise at least 30 minutes and it turned out perfectly crisp and not too chewy.

I was looking for a quick and easy recipe using everyday ingredients. The texture was wonderful! It made a tender crust, but the dough didn't stick in the pizza screen I bake my pizzas on so that was awesome!  Thanks Chef Rider for an awesome recipe

I have used this recipe more times than I can count but I make one small change. I don't like my dough to be too thick and this recipe yields more than enough dough to make 2, 16 inch thin crust pizzas. There are just two of us in the house so I divide the dough in half to make one pizza, wrap the remaining half in wax paper and put into a ziplock bag and use within 2-3 days. I find that the second pizza tastes even better after the dough sits for a few days. I will continue to make this again and again!

I see it's been a while since someone has reviewed this recipe. It should be noted that this recipe is amazing and can be slightly altered when using brown sugar instead of white. But this recipe alone is my template.

This recipe was perfect. I changed nothing except I brushed the dough with olive oil, herbs, and Parmesan cheese before adding the sauce. It was easy to follow as this was my first time making homemade pizza. It turned out wonderful and very tasty. This was a hit for my family, and we definitely will keep this one in our family cookbook!

This is my go-to crust for homemade pizza. The only thing is that it isn't quite as fluffy as I would like, but I read the reviews and discovered that this can be fixed by letting it rise longer than the recipe says, so I will try that next time. I bake it on a pizza stone covered in olive oil, and I add Italian seasoning to the recipe. Delicious!

I use this recipe every week to make pizza for my family. Easily makes a cookie sheet sized pizza with thick crust. Our favorite! I use all-purpose flour instead of bread flour and still comes out good. It would be even better with bread flour I'm sure. 

I usually double this recipe, use half for pizza and the other half for garlic bread. I just add melted butter to the top and a little garlic salt and parmasean cheese and bake as it says in the recipe. Really good for how simple and fast it is :-)

Great pizza dough!!  I had the extra time so I did a 1 hour dough rise.  I divided the dough in half to make two mini pizzas but they weren't that mini! I had a lot of dough to work with.  I think next time I will divide the dough into 4 balls.  We like to make mini pizzas with different toppings.  This recipe will work great for that.  When the pizza came out, I basted the crust edges with garlic butter.  Yum!!

This was fantastic! It had a great texture and a nice crust on the bottom. I wish I had read more reviews and watched the video because I would have made it thinner.  I think it was just my error.  All the pictures look thinner than my end result.
I used half emmer wheat and half organic white flour which turned out to be an awesome combination for this crust!  I did let it go through a one hour rise before punching it down and proceeding.  I pierced it with a fork and pre-baked it for 5 minutes before I added the toppings. 
I also made cheesy garlic bread out of the extra dough.  Garlic butter and mozzarella! Big hit!
This will be my go to crust from now on!  Especially after reading the ingredient lists on the store bought doughs.

I love this recipe! I like to double the recipe then roll out a rectangle And top it like a pizza, but roll it And cut it like cinnamon rolls. After I bake them I freeze most of them so my kids can have pizza rolls as snacks sometimes.  The crust is perfect. I tried to create my own for years And it always turned out bad. This one is so easy, And even easier if you have a bread maker.

Liked it but, I like a crispier and more airy crust. I would make it again for the simple fact it is both fast & easy.

This is such a easy recipe! I'm not one to make stuff from scratch. I tried this and it was so easy and delicious. Better then any store pizza I've ever tried. I made some sauce to go with it and the pizza was gone quickly

Used this to make a BBQ chicken pizza and a veggie pizza. For the time it takes this is fantastic. I think if you let it rise a tad it would definitely be better but for the time spent..this is easy and good. Saved to recipe box. Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this for the first time for dinner. Me and my husband really liked it. My first pizza from scratch and its a winner! :) The only thing I am gonna add next time is a little garlic powder in the crust. Thanx so much for sharing!

This pizza dough is absolutely amazing. I've never made pizza dough before so We used regular flour (not sure if there was a difference) and it is so tasty!!! We will never order our pizza again this was so incredibly easy to make it literally took less than 30 minutes to have fresh pizza with fresh ingredients. I'm still amazed at how well this turned out!!! Yummy!!!

This recipe could not be any quicker and easier.  I used it as a base for my barbeque chicken pizza and we had a nice homemade dinner that tasted much better than frozen.  Next time I will knead the dough longer to get a chewier crust, but other than that it was wonderful.  Fresh homemade pizza from start to finish in less than 45 minutes? Yes, please! It takes that long just waiting for delivery!

I've made it many times! I find it easiest to throw everything into a large bowl, then mix hands free by shaking the bowl in circular motions first, before kneading with hands a bit. It will be very sticky and seem like it has too much water, but be patient and don't kneed too much at first. 

Let it rise while punching down occasionally. I set the bowl on the rim of a large pot of water that recently boiled, which makes it rise very quickly.

We loved the taste of this recipe and it was very simple to make. We thought it was going to be a traditional style crust so we made a double recipe because we were making Chicago style pizza (crust on top and bottom). It turns out that the single recipe split into two parts would have been plenty because the crust was so bready and thick. We will definitely be making this again but probably only make a single recipe.

I thought this was a really good pizza dough recipe!  I usually a recipe which I like to slow rise in the fridge overnight, which requires definite planning! The Quick and Easy Pizza Crust won't replace it, but will definitely be in my rotation for spur of the moment homemade pizza.  It only took about 10 minutes to mix together in my Kitchen Aid, and I let the dough rest about 20 minutes, it raised a bit as well as rested which always makes dough easier to shape and all within 30 minutes.  Due to many of the reviews I used Garlic Salt in place of regular salt (as others said it was bland), I also par-baked the crust for 5 minutes at 500, making sure to pierce crust with fork to keep the shape.  I then turned the oven down to 450 while I topped my pizza, returned to lowered oven and baked for 7 minutes.  I then pulled it out to brush the crust with garlic butter, baked for an additional 7 minutes and then 2 minutes under the broiler.  I also baked in my crisper pizza pan (the one with holes on it). Next time I will halve the dough for two pizzas as it was a tad thicker than I normally make, however it was sturdy, baked beautifully, had a nice flavor, and a wonderful texture/chew.  Killed my pizza cravings and in less time than I can get a pizza delivered!

We have a well-loved pizza stone, but I don't think it's ever actually been used for pizza, until now. This crust was super quick and easy to make. I have a feeling we will be doing homemade pizza a lot more often now.

I've always wanted to make homemade pizza, and this recipe was very easy to follow... Especially for this beginner.  I had no difficulty.  I took a recommendation from another reviewer to add some seasoning right into the olive oil, and it gave the crust a nice flavor.  Mom and I enjoyed my first homemade pizza!

This crust is great.  It makes for a nice crisp crust that is neither too thick nor too thin.  I made this on thanksgiving day for lunch while our late family dinner was being put together.  Everyone loved the pizza I made and commented on the fact that the crisp crust was what made the dish.  This is so much better than ordering pizza or buying that frozen stuff found at the grocery store.

I have tried so many recipes for homemade pizza crust. This one is by far THE BEST crust and it's so easy (and fast). As a mother of three boys under the age of 4, we are always trying new, healthy, easy, and cheap meals. I can't wait to make this again with my boys!

Followed the recipe using all purpose instead of bread flour. After mixing it up I dusted with corn meal and put it on a parchment lined pan dusted with more corn meal(corn meal adds nice flavor). I then put a little olive oil on it and pushed it out to the size I wanted and topped with favorites. I will definitely use this recipe again and it absolutely does NOT need time to rise, it rose perfectly as it baked.

I tried it. It's my first time in making a pizza. My family didn't believe me when I said I will make a pizza in about half hour. They all loved it.  It was easy.  The pizza has a thick crust and so soft . I really love it and I recommended it

Very easy and very good. As with nearly every "quick" recipe, you are instructed to skip the rise. However, why not make the dough first thing and let it rise while you are getting everything else ready? Then use whatever rise you have when you are ready to bake the pie. I usually get a substantial rise by then. I also add garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the flour. Thanks so much for sharing!

Yummy! We made this to make a dessert pizza. I added and extra teaspoon of sugar to the dough and used all purpose flour. Turn out great! Will make again for regular savory pizza. It definitely was quick and easy!

This dough is easy to make and tastes great!  I brush it with a little butter and sprinkle with garlic salt, pre-bake on my pizza stone for 10 mins. and then add toppings and cook until cheese is melty and good.

This was a great quick and easy recipe for homemade pizza and faster than delivery!  I mixed in parmesan, garlic, and italian seasoning to the dough to give it some extra flavor per other reviews.   And since it was very sticky, I sprayed lightly with cooking spray so it was easier to work with.   It will be hard to justify ordering out now that we have this recipe!

This was perfect. I cooked the crust for 2 minutes before taking it back out and putting on the toppings (just to make sure it would be cooked at the center). I spread some olive oil and pureed cilantro on the crust before spreading the sauce over that. Delicious.

This recipe is great!  It's super easy, versatile and quick to make. We like a thinner crust so I can usually get 2 pizzas & a couple of bread sticks out of a single recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!

Best pizza dough so far! based on previous experience, I tripled the ingredients for guests. The yeast grew more than ever before for me, the dough was puffy and almost rising before I finished mixing in the flour! Since I don't have a huge surface to bake the pizza on (only cookie sheet) I made rectangular pizzas and instead of making three whole pizzas I would cut each dough in half to have a nice thin crust. It rises really well. This is a great, easy recipe, will definitely use again!

Made a double batch tonight. It was quick and very good. I made the mistake of squeezing a double batch onto a cookie sheet. It puffed up a little too much for our tastes-BUT we all agreed that we loved it. We also made stuffed crusts with cheese sticks. 2 adults, 3 kids 8,6, 1 all loved it!

The best quick homemade pizza dough I have ever had.  Not overly thick and doughy but not crispy and thin either, just that perfect in between.  I made this tonight and the whole family was raving about the dough.  Only changes I made was I added just a smidge of garlic and herb seasoning, but even with that added this pizza dough recipe shines right through to show it would do just as well even without the added seasoning.

Seriously perfect EVERY TIME. I made it to freeze. I made it tonight for dinner. Its super easy. Sometimes if I over mix it gets a bit sticky, and I add 2 tablespoons more of flour but this is the best dough I have used. Has been my go to dough for years now. It freezes beautifully, cooks up nice EVERY SINGLE TIME, and you can add so many things to do the dough to give it different flavors. For a quick go to recipe this is the one.

Great crust! I like to bake my pizza in a cast iron skillet. I add a couple tablespoons of oil to the bottom of my skillet and let it heat up in my oven while I preheat. Then I roll out my crust skillet size and carefully lay it in the hot oiled skillet, put on my sauce and toppings then place back in oven till cooked through. It makes the crust "pan" crust, crispy on the bottom. Soooo good!

I was surprised that I liked this quick pizza crust!  I took several suggestions and added oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, and basil to the flour just before adding it to the yeast mixture.  I also brushed on the crust olive oil and garlic powder.  I wanted to avoid the bland crust so many complained of.  I chose to make 1/2 of my pizza chicken, onion, garlic and barbeque sauce...while the other 1/2 was ham and pineapple with the traditional tomato paste sauce.  Despite the fact that the crust "grew" larger than anticipated, we liked the pizza very well.  I used my pizza stone (preheated) and dusted it with cornmeal.  I would make this crust again when I'm in a crunch for time.  I do love my traditional crust best...even though it takes 2 hours for rising time, etc.  It's not as thick as this one.

This recipe is wonderful! I am gluten-free, so I couldn't eat it, but my husband raved about it. I did sprinkle in a bit of Italian seasoning as I always do with pizza crust and I kneaded it for a couple minutes  before rolling it out for the stone I placed it on. I let it rise for about 20 minutes. It turned out perfect. It was done in 15 minutes.

As good as takeout. QUICKER TIP: if using instant dry yeast, it can be mixed immediately into the flour mixture and ten minutes can be saved. Also next time I will double the salt, and if I have time I will let rise once first. Flat beer, I bet, would be an excellent sub for water for a yeasty flavor if otherwise following the recipe.

This crust tasted as good as any I have made and took way less time!  I didn't have bread flour, but all-purpose flour worked fine.  I let the dough rest for 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes to help it rise a little more.  To get it a bit crispier, I baked the crust without any toppings for 5 minutes, and then continued baking with the toppings until the cheese was melted to my satisfaction.

This is the best fast pizza dough I've ever made! It is now a weekly staple. I make it with 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1.5 cups of bread flour, which turns out fine with no adjustments. Also, the suggestion from other reviewers to add herbs to the dough is a great one. Thanks!

We make homeade pizzas almost weekly and we have always used the store bought crust or box crust.  Who knew there was an easy one out there that tastes great too?  We have made this twice now, and all I can say is Yummy!  It is so easy to get together!  It beats store bought already prepared crust hands down.  And the taste of it is sooooo good!  It will be used by this family for years to come!  Thank you for posting it!

Great quick pizza dough. It was a bit thick for my liking, but that is to be expected with a dough that one doesn't have time to rise. Definitely a fabulous "to go" recipe for a quick pizza. I decided to add fresh rosemary to the crust to give some flavor and omit the blandness which others complained about; great decision! Thanks for sharing, I am keeping this one!

Use this recipe a lot and it always turns out nice. I do recommend preheating a baking stone to cook it on and using a piece of parchment paper to roll it out on. (The parchment paper makes it easy to slide with all the toppings onto the preheated stone.) the stone makes for a delicately crisp crust that cooks on top and bottom quite evenly.

I followed this recipe almost exactly; the only difference is I added some seasoning to the flour. This dough still came out very bland.

I am impressed with the ease of this recipe. It truly is a quick solution when you don't want to buy a pizza. I wasn't sure if the dough needed to be cooked first so I did (brushed with garlic and olive oil) for 3 minutes prior to adding the toppings. I'm not sure if it's necessary but old habits... It didn't rise necessarily. Basically, however thick you made the dough was how it stayed throughout the cooking process. I actually like that. We made individual pizzas so some were thin and some thick with just 2-3 minutes difference on the cook time. I also added Italian seasoning and onion powder to the dough. We will use as a staple for the mere fact it is SO DANG EASY AND QUICK! My picky eaters loved it.

Followed directions to the letter, baked on a pizza stone on the upper rack. I'm not sure why some reviewers complained it didn't cook through, I can only guess they had way too many wet toppings. It baked up well, but was much more like a French bread pizza than the light, airy crust we prefer, and it certainly wasn't thin. It definitely needs a longer rise, and perhaps a change to AP flour. As written, it's tough, too doughy/chewy, and just not a very appetizing crust.  I'll stick with my day-before slow rise crust, it produces a thin crust that's light, crisp, and tender, with a wonderful crumb.

Wonderful!! I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour (my baking secret). My husband, one to typically not love my whole wheat efforts, said it was awesome!! I give credit to the ww pastry flour. Since it's finer, it doesn't have that same strong flavor as regular ww.  I also let it rise for like an hour because I had the time. Thank you for a great recipe!

Definitely quick and easy, but not the "chewy" crust I was looking for.  A small step up from the packaged mix crust, but no where near a pizza shop.  I think the key may be actually letting the dough rise.

Yum! Just made a pizza for a quick lunch for my son and it was delicious!  I didn't have any olive oil so I just used melted butter. I used a hand mixer with dough hooks and it came together beautifully in just a couple minutes. I also didn't have any cornmeal so it just went straight onto a buttered pizza pan. It didn't stick at all. I baked it for about 10 min. before adding the toppings and it started to puff up a lot, so I poked it with a fork and smooshed it down. The crust was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, and nice and thick the way we like it. Will definitely make again!

This is perfect. I love the foot notes. I made it using 1 cup whole wheat flour with the herbs. I have made about 5 different pizza dough recipes and this is the only one that turns out great without precooking. We usually don't eat all the crust but this is perfectly done.

Made this crust recipe for a pizza for dinner tonight. I give it a 5, while the hubby says he gives it a 4. We have never made crust from scratch, but we both worked at Pizza Hut for quite a few years, thereby getting lots of experience with dough in general.

It was a little dense/heavy, but tasted good and was super easy. Hubby also says he thinks it would be better stretched to a 14" pan instead. We used canola oil because I didn't have olive oil, but Idk if that would make a difference or not.

Regardless, keeping the recipe to use again! Thank you!

Thank you sooo much for this recipe!!!! It was quick and easy and just what I needed for a quick meal. The only changes I made were the addition of sea salt, basil,garlic powder and oregano. This gave the crust a nice flavor and provided a delicious base for my barbeque chicken pizza.

Simple recipe that serves it's purpose well.  My 4 year old helped, and it turned out flawless.  She's eating it as we speak, and told me that my pizza is really really good.  That's huge coming from her, being that she is an extremely picky eater.  I even added some garlic powder to the dough, and no complaints.  Very good!!

Outstanding recipe.  My results were perfect the first time.  I followed a reviewer's advice and added about a tablespoon of Italian herbs and garlic powder to the flour when mixing ingredients.  I found this recipe when I had forgotten to buy a pre-made crust at the store. When it's this easy and fresh, no reason not to have homemade.

texture is very soft but flavor is bland; to the point where we didn't even eat our bread sticks made with this recipe the first time around. second time around was much better after adding garlic powder, agave, and a bit more salt. I also used white whole wheat flour so maybe that's why I needed to add additional seasoning

Look no further. This recipe is great. I am not really a planner so making pizza dough ahead doesn't usually happen for me. With this, I can decide to make pizza at 5:00 and have two hot, personalized pizzas out of the oven by 6. The main time sink there is just that my oven takes ages to heat, too; with a better oven, it'd be more like 30 minutes. I like to make pretty thin dough and this rolls out well and cooks up crispy. This recipe also freezes VERY well. I often break it into two or four balls (four for small personal pizzas, two for bigger ones. Using it all together would be a huge or rather thick pizza). I'll freeze the extra balls and then when I want pizza another day, I can just take them out that afternoon and let them thaw in the fridge. It thaws quickly and starts to reinflate long before I even need it (so thaw it in a bowl covered with plastic wrap... it tends to escape from sandwich baggies). General pizza tips: 1. As with any dough it's a good idea to put it into a disc shape, let it rest for a few minutes, then roll it, and let it rest/roll more if you need to to be even thinner. 2. Roll it out on parchment paper on a pizza peel/cookie sheet/cutting board before you put it in the oven. You can put cornmeal under it too but the paper really helps prevent accidental calzones. 3. Use a pre-heated pizza stone for a really good crisp result. Keep that pizza stone in your oven always and it helps even out the heating, too!

I had a lot of reservations about trying this, because someone at my house is really picky about pizza crust, saying that it needs to rise and rest for at least a couple days. I tried this in hopes that it would at least be decent. To my great surprise, it got compliments. It's a nice balance somewhere between thin and pan crust. This recipe is part of my permanent collection now! Thanks!

My daughter and I make home made pizza at least once a week. We love this recipe, it never fails to make a perfect crust. We use Home made sauce that we can each year from our garden tomatoes and herbs. I also add a little bit of Italian seasoning into the crust while I am mixing it. I prebake it for 5-8 minutes to make sure it is crusty and cooked on the bottom before putting the toppings on. I recommend this to anyone wanting a fast crust that works every time.

We love this recipe - we have also used it to make focaccia, yeast rolls, Parmesan bread sticks, cinnamon rolls, hamburger buns, flatbread, you name it. Use a fast-rising pizza crust yeast or another high-quality fast yeast for super results - and oil your hands to handle the dough rather than flour to keep the dough light. If you're using it to make rolls, be sure to group the rolls in the middle of the pan with the sides touching to make them rise high and fluffy.

This wasn't bad, especially considering it was a quick crust.  If I had the time it probably wouldn't be my first recipe but in a pinch it worked well.  I added some spices (a pasta sprinkle mix I have) and some garlic powder to the crust which made it pretty flavorful.  I used it as thin crust pizza and it was good.  Like I said, good if you are pressed for time, otherwise I would prefer a dough that has to rise.

Made as written and it turned out really well.  Next time will add seasonings.  I had to add a little more flour as my dough was sticky.  This was fun although I made a mess.

This turned out great. I was able to get 2-12" pizza dough from this recipe. I also kneaded the dough by hand till smooth. Freezes excellent.

This is a wonderful pizza crust.  I have tried it following the directions and it waS GREAT! Although, we tend to like a little bit sweeter crust so, I have added some honey to it.

This is a great recipe.  For those who think the crust is bland, sprinkle a little fresh rosemary, chopped finely, onto the sauce after you spread it on top of the crust and it will really enhance the flavor.  I find it helpful to bake the crust for 5-10 minutes before adding sauce and toppings so that the cheese does not burn before the crust is ready. Then just watch it carefully and take out when top is done.  Enjoy!

I tried this recipe because I was looking for a quick way to make pizza crust. I usually make it in my bread machine, which takes almost 2 hours. This recipe is fantastic. It's very quick and easy, and the crust comes out perfect. I'll probably use this recipe from now on and save a lot of time making pizza.

Nothing but love for this recipe! Soft and doughy is just what I wanted and this recipe delivered exactly that. This was my first time making my own crust and I couldn't be happier with the outcome. I used AP flour and garlic-infused olive oil, following the recipe exactly. However, I did let the dough rise for closer to 45 minutes, only because I got distracted with laundry. I made this crust for the Big Cheeseburger Pizza, also from this site, and will use this crust as my "go-to" every time I do a homemade pizza now. I foresee a LOT of homemade pizzas in our weekend dinner rotations, now that I feel confident enough to make my own. Thanks for such an easy recipe to help first-time crust makers like me!

This crust is quick and amazing!  We grill our pizza and the crust does great cooking it that way. Just get the grill to 415 degrees and you are set.

Certainly quick...and easy. I made Gourmet Chicken Pizza using this as the crust. Next time, I will let it rise a bit longer (maybe 10-15 minutes) after putting it on the pizza pan and before adding the ingredients.

This was a great inspiration reciepe. I did make a few changes. I added 1 tablespoon each of onion powder, garlic powder, basil, oregano to oil .Preheat oven to 200 then turn off. Place dough in a slighty oiled metal bowl and covered with a plate and let it sit in oven 30 min. Then I rolled it out, added toppings, and bake 25 min. Very good !!

Awesome, quick pizza crust for when you're in a time crunch! I added a few herbs/seasonings (garlic, onion powder, and rosemary) to the dough to season it up a bit. It was great!!

Turned out perfect!!! Added basil garlic pizza sauce, monetary jack/mozzarella cheese mix, white onion, red pepper and pepperoni. Yummy! Next time I might add some more seasoning to the crust and sauce.

I thought this made good pizza dough.  I'm a novice at dough so this was less intimidating than other recipes that call for doubling and lengthy wait times.  I made exactly as stated and it was a bit sticky but just a bit more flour made it workable for me.

Excellant pizza dough recipe.  I dumped everything into the stand mixer and mixed for 5 minutes.  stretched out on a flour board, covered with warmed cloth for 15 minutes. Topped and cooked on the Big Green Egg at 500 for 14 minutes.  
This dough is a keeper and very forgiving and pretty tasty too.

Madly in love with this recipe!  I used to use my bread machine to make dough, which was super easy, but it took an hour and a half.  This, however, is super easy AND quick!  And it results in a crust texture that I like--chewy with a crispy bottom.  Thank you!

WoW!  I followed the recipe exactly, making sure the water was at the perfect temperature and using bread flour.  It was just as good and better than the risen versions I have tried.  I have sent this recipe to several friends who, like me, don't have the time to wait for the rising.  Thank you so much Chef Rider!!!  This is awesome and so delicious!!!  This is the best pizza crust recipe I have ever tried, and I have tried many.

Super easy quick pizza recipe. If you want a super thick crust this isn't it. If you want something good that you don't have to wait hours to make this is your pizza. 
I like to spice it up a bit sometimes by using 1 cup of whole grain wheat flour or spelt flour and 1 and a half cups regular all purpose flour.

Exact ingredients how I make my pizza crust  Great basic recipe.  I do make 2 thin crust pizzas (14") with it.
I also let it rise for 1 hour.  One pizza is plenty in my house so I freeze the other half of dough.  When I need it I put it in the fridge and let it cold rise.   Easy peasy. 

I bake mine at 425 on bottom rack for 10-12 minutes using an air bake pizza pan, or on my pizza stone.   Both result in a crispy crust.   I also add my own spices as I add my pizza toppings.     I'm hungry for pizza now.  
Great basic recipe you can tweak to your liking.

Great recipe! We have used a ceramic tile discard from a tile store as a pizza (and other breads) stone. Cheap (the ones we have were free) and easy to clean. They will usually cut it to size for you for free also.

So great!  I've used bread flour, wheat flour, and all purpose, and every time, this recipe delivers a great crust!  Family is sold on this one! Exclamation points are well deserved!! I should mention, I bake the crust for 5 minutes on a preheated (450f oven) pizza stone before topping and baking for 10min more. Also love brushing crust with olive oil mixed with garlic powder, salt, and parsley flakes.  Go crazy with this recipe!

5 stars for the taste and the convenience. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was. I followed the recipe exactly, no extra rising time, and it came out crisp and chewy, tender and tasty. Made enough for 2 -14" pizzas.

I'm not sure what exactly it was that I did wrong... but the dough was very hard to work with and was very sticky. I read reviews before making this, so I did make changes but it seems like it worked for other people. I used all purpose instead of bread (which i read would be fine.. maybe that was the problem) and I used 1/2 cup white wheat. I added garlic powder to the flour and let the dough rest for 30 min... oh and I didn't use a mixer, just stirred. The end result wasn't bad, but i had to pretty much spread it on a pizza stone. Next time, I think I would want to follow directions exactly the way they are written if I'm not familier with that type of dish.

Very happy how this turned out. Quick and easy. I usually make a bread maachine dough but that is time consuming. I will be using this one from now on.

I don't usually make pizza dough because you can never tell if it's gonna be any good without sacrificing the entire pie. I made this in the morning to put in the fridge for our evening meal.  The cold fridge did nothing to stop the dough from raising! In any case it was awesome! Made it 3 days ago and the family is asking for it again! I will NEVER again purchase a pre-made dough or crust for pizza! This crust even passed the next day left-overs warm up test!! Thanks CHEF RIDER!

This was great! I kneaded the dough for 5 minutes, and then let it rise for about 30 min before rolling it out. Pizza crust perfection!

This pizza dough is great! I was pressed for time and this recipe fit the bill. It was doughy and crisp and my fiance wants to eat this every day from now on.

I added Italian seasoning to the dough, and used 1/2 cup whole what flour and 2 cups white. It was very easy to double, and everyone left the table happy.

I really liked this recipe.  I added basil to it for flavor and aroma.
I found that it was a bit thin, but I did roll it out pretty thin.  My result was an aromatic, crispy crust that was chewy around the edges.  Highly edible!

Love this recipe! I made it for a quick bread as well! I use whole wheat flour (sifted) for a bit healthier crust. Excellent!

The name says it all -- quick and easy! We just had our homemade pizza for dinner, and like other reviewers said, we probably won't buy pizza outside anymore! ---- Edit: I made cheese sticks with this dough. Mixed herb and garlic salt to the dough and used mozzarella cheese blocks cut in sticks (about your finger size). Just wrap the dough around the cheese (make sure they are sealed or the cheese oozes out) and brush with olive oil mixed with herb and garlic salt. Had these with homemade spicy tomato sauce and my brother has been nagging me to make them again!

At the request of my husband I looked up a recipe for homemade pizza. I'm not a big fan of pizza till today when I made for my very first time in my life homemade pizza. it was soooo easy to make and a complete success. It tasted sooo delicious. I love pizza now! I even love making it. Thank you for posting this recipe!

Love it! I usually add some garlic and Italian seasoning and use it as the breading for my stromboli, double up the recipe and freeze half to make breadsticks later.

The only change I make is adding Italian seasoning to the dough before I mix it. I use this one religiously every week or two! I also make a double batch and make half the batch into garlic bread. The kids beg for it!

Awesome crust.  Easy to make, easy to double.  Can be made ahead, partially cooked and frozen...so easy and quick, though, why bother when it can be fresh?

Just like the title says, quick and easy, AND delicious! I did let it rise for about an hour in an oven set at 150 and then turned off. This is the first time I have made pizza dough, and it turned out perfectly. I used the "exquisite sauce" recipe from this site, and added shredded mozzarella, fontina, and parmesan cheese for me and also added pepperoni for my husband's half. The pizza turned out so good, I can't wait to try it again!

Great recipe.  Super easy.  I've tried a ton of the "let rise for 10 hours" (sarcasm) and I don't see much of a difference.  Anyone can do this.

This crust was easy to make. After reading several reviews I decided to used plain flour and flavor the dough with Italian seasoning. Next time I will leave out the seasoning because it just overpowered the pizza. Overall a very good recipe and I will definitely will be making it again.

This crust was simple and quick, but it was very sticky and difficult to work with. The flavor was fine, but I don't think I'll be making it again unless I'm in a rush.

Fantastic and so easy to make!  If you have to leave at a certain point, you can let it set for longer in pretty much any stage of the process, and I think it would be a good idea to let it set once it's formed into a round for a half hour or so if you have the time.

easy and fast!
I think I would add some spices the next time to give it more flavor, but it is delicious plain as well. 
Nice to have something easy to make as I am usually pretty last-minute in planning meals.

Very good recipe, I have never made any sort of dough before. This is super easy and delicious. I doubled the recipe and it worked just fine.  We rolled it sort of thin and still had enough left over to make a calzone -- a double recipe is really probably enough to make three 12 inch pizzas if you like thin crust. This one is a keeper!

Love this crust.  I have been using this recipe for "spontaneous pizza dinner" for the last 3 years.  It's quick to make and tastes great.  I love the no rising time.  You can do everything while you are heating the oven and getting all the toppings ready.  It's a winner!

Thank you!  Wonderful wonderful WONDERFUL and it was so "quick and easy" that I was certain I had forgotten a step lol!  I made enough to freeze for later.  This is a pizza house and I can make wonderful preservative free(make sause from scratch) good quality yet inexpensive pizza for dinner or lunch or breakfast whenever the mood strikes.

This was great!  It was my first time making my own pizza dough and it worked out so well...even though I ran out of all-purpose flour.  Oops.  I thought I had a back-up bag, but that turned out to be sugar, so...whole-wheat flour to the rescue!  I used 2 c. whole wheat and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour; brushed with herb-infused olive oil before pre-baking for 8 minutes.  Used my Pampered Chef pizza stone and the crust was the perfect blend of chewy and crispy; the hubby and I enjoyed it and it was the perfect texture for my 15-month old.  I'll be making home-made pizza more often now--thank you, Chef Rider!

Super, super recipe!  I use my stand mixer and it works perfectly.  I use the dough for focaccia, calzones, breadsticks, cheese rolls, you name it.   Actually, I thought I'd reviewed this recipe years ago.  Well, better late than never!

I've made this many times now.  It is very good and easy.  I love that I don't have to let it rise.  It makes a nice, thin crust, not heavy at all.  Very easy to roll out.  No need to ever use a store-bought crust again!

My husband wanted homemade pizza and I wanted a quick recipe...I found it! I absolutely loved this, the dough was so stretchy and easy to work with. Doubled and used half for breadsticks. Made everything in under an hour! Added garlic and Italian seasonings to crust :)

This was amazing! I made it into a Sicilian style crust and it turned out very crispy. My boyfriend would rather eat this then go out to his favorite pizza place. I wish I could give this more then five stars.

We enjoyed this and split it into 2 pies so the kids could use their own pizza fillings. Make sure you spread the dough out otherwise it will be puffy and chewy. It could have been crispier on the bottom.  Update: used a cookie sheet to get the crispy bottom!

As stated, I used the dough to make one pizza.  It was good, but very bready.  If I used this recipe again, I would make it into TWO 12-inch pizzas--thinner crust and less bready.  I think it would taste better.  Also, I followed the recipe, but put about a teaspoon of italian spices into the dough.  Also good for breadsticks!
UPDATE--I doubled the recipe and made 3 12-inch pizzas.  Worked much better!  Still a bit bready, so I may try to double the recipe and make 4 12-inch pizzas.

This is perfect if you decide you want pizza and don't want to run to the store for crust! It works great, and really tastes a lot better than purchased crusts.  I find myself making this a great deal.

love this thick crust. The fact that you don't have to let it set overnight is a nice addition as well. It is going in my list of recipes that all the roommates enjoy! Also if you add an egg you can use this crust recipe to make soft pretzels.

Fab! Super easy recipe and my daughters had so much fun helping make it! I am going to try and get a pizza stone, the crust was cooked through, but a little soft in the middle (not soggy at all, just soft).

Great for when you are in a rush.  My only changes is I season the dough by adding onion powder, oregano, parsley, and basil to the oil (so it blends in well) before I add it to the mix. I find it best to mix everything by hand - just flour up your hands and if you get any sticking just sprinkle with more flour. 

I also season the sauce that I spread on top with the same seasoning as above. My Favorite combo for toppings is fresh sliced mushrooms, sauteed ground meat and turkey pepperoni. 

I brush the dough with olive oil. all over, spread my seasoned sauce, layer mushrooms, ground beef, and pepperoni and top it off with Mozzarella String Cheese and a touch of shredded Cheddar.

For the string cheese - peel it in strings like you would as you eat it. Line the strings up on a cutting board and chopped cross wise.  I like this so much better than shredded bag cheese.

This was great.  I made calzones out of it.  While the dough was resting I got together the filling.  It's already in my recipe book as well as bookmarked.

Very simple to make.  I didn't have enough flour, but adjusted accordingly.  It was easy to work with too.  The crust was a bit tender for me, but I think this would be great with a bit of kneading.
All in all this is a great quick recipe.  I will try it for bread sticks next... YUM

We and our friends love this pizza dough! I use whole wheat pastry flour.  I bake it on a stone on the outdoor grill, but it really needs to cook for 4-5 minutes on one side BEFORE putting the toppings on the baked side--if you want a crisp crust.

My husband and I are in the Peace Corps in the back country of Costa Rica where they cook with traditional clay ovens.  We made this dough using crude measurements and it still turned out fabulous.  I recommend just shaping the dough on the pan, though; it was much easier.

Very good, quick recipe!  I made it as is, and I'm pretty impressed.  Once baked, the crust is more soft and  "bread like" vs.  chewy pizza parlor kinda fare.  Would've been excellent with garlic and herbs mixed in!

This is equally as good as the other high rated bread machine pizza crust on AR.  And this is sooooo much faster!  My first time trying this I had leftover alfredo sauce in frig so I used that as my sauce and topped it with Mozzeralla.  I have been making homemade pizza for many years and this will be my "go to" recipe for pizza crust from now on.  I agree with others, next time I will add a little garlic and onion powder to the mix for some added flavor but dough is sooo easy to work with, I won't change a thing other than that.

SUPER easy to make, and I'm normally a bit failure when it comes to anything bread-like. I admit to coming here not because I wanted to even homemake bread but because of an incident involving me using a box crust, opening some tomato sauce to realize it had botuli-tized (if that's even a word), and then two days later after buying some more pizza sauce (yes, I buy my pizza sauce -- I AM A FAILURE!) to realize I had no more boxes of crust to make. So I went in to this warily. Super easy to make and let's see--taking my first bite now...

...Spectacular. Absolutely spectacular. Tastes like a good solid crust and it holds up well! Yeah, it's bland but...I guess I've never tasted pizza crust that -isn't- bland. I might even use this over the boxed stuff now since it makes more and is even easier to do.

Made with whole wheat flour instead of bread flour.  This was thick and spongy.  Kinda reminded us of eating a piece of wheat bread with pizza toppings.

This pizza crust is great! Right now I am only cooking for two, so it works great to slice the dough into three equal pieces. I flatten out two of the balls into crusts for deep-dish pizzas that I make in two 9-inch pie tins, and then I use the third for breadsticks. It is nice and fast, and tastes delicious! :)

This is a great and easy pizza dough recipe. I've made it several times as is or adding italian seasonings to the dough. It also can be used for deep crust pizza using a 9x13 inch baking pan which I will be making again tonight!

I was really pressed for time tonight, but I had my heart set on home made pizza.  I made the recipe exactly as is and it was fantastic.  I make pizza on a regular basis and this may have just taken over as my favorite pizza dough.  Next time I'll add spices and other extras (I didn't even have time for that today).

I really liked this  dough! It was easy to make and tasted great! I added 1/4 basil, oregano and garlic powder to the dough as well.
It was my first time working with yeast, and I would say it was a success.
My husband thought it was too "doughy", but I thought it was just right. Hes a thin crust kind of guy.

Turned out well.  It's a fluffier dough, not as chewy a doughs that rest longer.

This is the best pizza crust, and quickest I have tried so far! I had to add 1/4 tsp water in order for the dough to stick together, but it cooks up fluffy and my family loved it. I will try it next time with 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour to see if it will turn out just as nice.  I did use unbleached bread flour this time though.

Super easy and everyone loved the crust.  My 5-yr. old NEVER eats the crust, but there wasn't a bite left on his plate.  I did allow 30 min. for the dough to rise, only because I had the time. Thanks for a really easy, crowd-pleasing dough!

A very quick recipe if you need a vehicle for pizza toppings and don't have much time, but it was completely flavorless and doughy. I won't be making it again.

I hate to leave a bad review but I didn't really like this crust.I thought it was very bland.My husband on the other hand thought it was pretty good.I guess I'm just spoiled to Jays Signature Crust recipe which I usually use.I just didn't have time to wait for the dough to rise so I thought I would give this one a try.I did like how easy it was to make but I'll have to stick with Jays Signature crust.

Great recipe!  I altered it a bit though... used AP flour instead of bread flour, and added some spices: powdered garlic, basil, oregano, parsley, and thyme.  Smells wonderful!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I am a baker and this one just worked perfectly.  I added garlic powder, Mediterranean seasoned sea salt to the dough and it gave it a great flavor!  My family loved it!  And me too!

Very good. I used bread flour and it puffed up a lot! Since I was also using my pizza stone, I was limited on the diameter of the pizza. This made it puff up too thick. Next time, I will either line a cookie sheet or make it into two pizzas to compensate for the puffing. Nice flavor. It was as easy as a box mix, and lots cheaper.

Works fantastic for the first time dough maker. Definitely quick and easy.  Not an intimidating recipe at all and if you following it exactly, you can enjoy pizza in 30 minutes - shorter than it takes to order!

I didn't notice the recipe stated bread flour until I got to cooking.  (Wouldn't you know it.)  I sifted the same amount of regular all-purpose flour and threw in my favorite spices.  It was great!  I would love just to have this as breadsticks.  It was super quick, and it was easy to work with the dough.  So soft!  Yummmmm!

Pretty good for a quick rise dough.  For more flavor,  next time, I will add garlic powder and parmesan, plus the italian herbs I used this time, to the dough after mixing it. thanx for the recipe!

This Pizza Crust was very easy to make had a great taste.  We had a family get together and made homemade pizzas and everybody liked this crust.  It was a nice soft crust.  I will be making this again.  We even used one's idea to make breadsticks and we stuffed some of the breadsticks with pepperoni.  All turned out good.

This is a great quick recipe.  I make 3 thin crust pizzas with one of this.  I add rosemary, garlic powder, and oregano to the flour mixture and it comes out great!!  Also, depending on the thickness of the crust, I bake it for 2 to 5 minutes by itself before adding the topping, that way is cristpy and not soggy.  Love this recipe!!

I am fairly experienced with making yeast breads by hand, and just couldn't get this one to work.  The texture and flavor were not even as good as a frozen pizza.  I guess there really aren't any shortcuts to making good breads.

Very easy and quick to make! I let the dough rise for a few hours (since I had the time). I added italian seasonings, garlic salt to the olive oil before adding to the dry. I also brushed the entire crust with olive oil, sprinkled with parm and minced garlic then baked it for 8 mins. before adding the sauce and toppings. Will make again!

Even though I'm an experienced home cook, I've never tried a scratch pizza crust.  This recipe is a perfect, easy recipe for homemade pizza.    Once I stirred the flour in and combined the ingredients, I finished forming it with my hands, then let it rest for about 15 mins.  I shaped and rolled it (with my Pampered Chef dual pastry roller) into a 16" circle and transferred it to a "mesh" type pan.  I let it rest another 15 minutes, only because I had the time.  Topped with sauce, partially cooked loose Italian Sausage, small pieces of onion and, of course, cheese.  Baked at 450 for just under 15 mins, and it appeared to me to be done, which it was.  I would split this dough into two smaller pizza crusts if not using a large pan as I did.  I'm sure it would be fantastic on a pizza stone.  I didn't add seasoning, as others have, because I think the toppings are what adds the flavor.    I am very happy to have found this recipe.

I didn't even have to roll it out, just shaped with my hands and put it on a baking sheet lined with a Silpat mat and cornmeal. ***Remove Silpat mat prior to cutting pizza or you'll end up ruining your mat and your pizza!*** Will make this again!!! Thanks!!!!

I use this recipe all the time.  Changes: I use half whole wheat flour, I use 1 Tb of olive oil while kneading the dough, but I then brush the remaining oil onto the dough after it has been rolled out.  I also let it rise about 30 minutes, and then rise a bit again when it has been rolled out.  Unless I'm in a hurry, I don't mind waiting a bit longer to have a puffier crust.

This was a wonderful recipe very easy and good.  I doubled the recipe and it made 6 personal pan sized pizzas.  In the past I would use frozen bread dought but didn't have the time to let it rise and all that found this and loved it.  Everyone loves the idea of making there own personal pizza.  I just put the differant toppings out and hand then the cast iron stillet with the crust pressed into it.  Thanks for the recipe and we will be using this all the time.

This was a super quick and easy recipe. I feel it could use additional spices as the finished product came out a bit on the bland side. The texture was nice, chewy and when reheated in the microwave, the crust remained moist.

Took other's advice and put italian seasoning and used garlic powder and butter for the crust edges....as good if not better than delivery!  I also used regular flour (that's all I had on hand)  still had nice thick crust...will make again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This crust came out perfectly - made exactly according to recipe, and my husband and I both loved it!  In fact, we had it a second time 2 days after the first because my husband requested it.

The pizza crust is really good for the most part. It rises beautifully! I have been adding 1 tsp of pizza spice like another commenter suggested. I found it was a little hard to work the dough by using the full 2 1/2 cups of bread flower. When trying to use less, however, the dough was too sticky so I had to beat the rest of it in while kneading the dough. I had my first pampered chef cooking show and my mom was making the dough at the time. I had her use 1 1/4 cup bread flower and 1 1/4 cup whole wheat flower. It turned out fabulous! We've been making pizzas with this crust for about 2 months now and I think it's the best luck we've had with it. Wasn't too sticky and we could work it really easily! Overall the base recipe is great and can easily be changed to suit anyone's taste.

Not bad at all! This was my first try making pizza. I think this crust could be a bit more flavorful. Both my kids really liked it, didn't even care it had veggies. I will probably make this again.

This is a pretty great pizza crust. Easy, chewy, fast. It could be brushed with olive oil, dusted with parmesan, and cut into breadsticks as quickly as opening a similar number of refrigerated, canned breadsticks.

This was very quick and easy!!!  Love the crunch the crust has after it was bake and it wasn't soggy like other crust I've tried.  I use pizza stones to make my pizzas on.  I always put the dough in the oven before I put my toppings on, for about 5 minutes, this gives it a head start.  Then I pile my toppings on and finish baking.

Very good!  Thanks to the reviewer who suggested spices mixed in with the crust.  Only problem I had was that it didn't stay crisp.  Perhaps I'll try to bake it for 5 minutes before topping it and then bake it with toppings next time :).

The second time I made this it was so yummy.  I used bread flour instead of regular flour.  Patted it out instead of rolling.  Used crust to make Mexican Pizza.  Baked at 400 for about 30 minutes.  Crust was light, soft, airy, delicious!

I LOVE, LOVE,LOVE this crust recipe!!! It is not very often that I can make something that my family and I can make and everyone makes their meal, their own. As I am a vegan it can be tricky to have meals that we can make together,,this is one of the few keepers!!! My husband made sure to tell me to MAKE this AGAIN he liked it so much,,, thanks for making an easy idea that makes a family meal a NO FUSS evening at home!

This is a fantastic crust recipe! I tossed in some dried oregano and rosemary and lightly brushed the exposed crust with olive oil before I baked it. Just watch your baking times if you are making smaller or thin crust pizza. Oh. and I didn't have a stone to bake it on and it turned out just fine.

Thank you for a quick, easy and failproof recipe. It turned out fantastic with toppings. I made thick and thin crusts, and the thin crust pizza was just amazing. I used garlic infused olive oil from Costco in the dough.

I made this with the pastry flour, because I had it at home. Turned the oven on, and set the dough to rise on top of the stove, which is right above the oven and was pretty toasty, did everything right by the receip and it came out great!! My 2 yr had a blast playing with the flour :) .. And my very picky husband loved this pizza better than store bought. It came out to be a very thin pizza which we like. I used easy souce with equal parts of tomatoe sauce and paste with garlic powder, salt and real garlic to taste, and we added 3 cheeses.. Delicious!!!

I would give it 4 stars except I made some of the suggested changes. Hubbs loved it, I didn't care for the density - it was incredibly thick & heavy. But easy as all get out, fun to make your own dough, so I'll probably mess around with the recipe once or twice more before giving up altogether on it. The thinner pieces were perfect but there were a few spots that were just incredibly dense - I did prebake it for 5 minutes, probably should have punched it down & flattened it again before adding toppings?

I'm rating this 4 out of 5 stars because it is exactly what it promises - a quick and easy crust.  However, it's on the bland side.  I added a bit of garlic powder, some onion powder and a bit more salt to the crust.  I also brushed melted butter onto the edges and sprinkled on more garlic and some grated Parmesan.  It was good, but not great.

I tried this recipe strictly because of the positive reviews. I was so pleased with the crust and the pizza.  It turned out so well.  Nice and crisp but still soft and chewy. This is a great simple recipe and the pizza was super fast to make.

I love this recipe!  Quick and easy and even though it's simple, I feel better making it from scratch instead of buying store bought crust..  I sometimes  make it into crunchy cheese "bread" to serve with soup as well. Thank you Chef Rider for sharing this recipe!

I'm happy to have a crust I can use on a weeknight to make an awesome pizza.  I don't understand why folks call it bland or add any spice to the crust.  It's a crust!   The flavor is in the sauce and the toppings. MMMMMMMM.

Very Easy to make!! Only thing I would change is to add 2 more tablespoons of Olive Oil to the mix and then brush with oil before adding toppings!!

Good dough; light and airy.  Not at all heavy and the crust crisps up nicely.

Deserving of a rare 5-star rating from me, because this recipe works "as is", does just what you want it to do, and tastes great. I love baking bread, and while I have no problems kneading dough, this happily brought pizza back into the "what is something quick and easy for dinner" category, instead of having to plan for rising time. It really can be done in 30 minutes, which from my experience is basically the same as frozen or delivery, but with the goodness of homemade, flexibility of toppings, and all those other wonderful things that come with baking! Don't be scared, go for it!

I made Deep Dish Pizza using this recipe because I was getting started late and did not have time to do my ususal.  It was wonderful, my family could not even tell the difference.  After making the dough i rolled it out and put it in a large black cast iron skillet with plenty of olive oil on the bottom, pressed it to and up the sides and loaded with topping. Then baked at 425 for 35 Minutes. MMmm we love Deep dish pizza at my house.

An excellent crust. Note that 1 pkg = 2 1/4 tsp yeast. I also added basil, oregano, and onion powder, mixing them in with the flour. I also used half whole wheat flour to no ill effect. For a thin crust pizza, use 2/3 of the dough for a regular pizza pan, and make a smaller pizza (or breadsticks) with the leftover. Mmmmm....

Really, really good! I've made this twice in the last two weeks and my co-workers and family have raved about it! I extended the dough past the edge of the pizza pan and used cheese sticks and made it a stuffed crust!  Instead of plain old pizza sause, I used ranch dressing and it came out wonderful!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

We love pizza at our house, and we made this today with hamburger, onions, garlic, bell pepper and topped with two kinds of cheese including mozerella and cheddar.  Next time we'll add italian sausage to the mixture.  The spices I used were oregeno and basil, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes, and duplicated those spices for the sauce and added a 1/2 teaspoon sugar to cut through the tomato acid a bit.  I left the dough just as the recipe called for, but I have a gas oven so I turned down the heat to 425 and cooked it for 15-17 min to get the crunch we like.  The corn meal tip was great, and keeps the dough from sticking.  Great recipe, thanks!  ~Laurie  :)  POOHsPSPPlace@aol.com

Excellent recipe. Sometimes I like to add just a little more salt and replace one of the cups of flour with semolina flour.

I have been experimenting with different pizza doughs trying to find the right one.  So far, this one is the best.  I do think that I will pre-cook it for a few minutes next time.  By the time the toppings were brown, the dough wasn't quite as done as I would have liked.

For a little more body I don't roll out the crust but rather stretch it into place and the crust ends up being pretty bubbly. For a little more texture still, I put in a half of a cup of whole wheat flour. This is so easy -- I hate ordering out now. It's definitely not as good as homemade with this recipe.

Tasted great but the recipe could easily be halved -- there was so much dough! I will definitely try it again but make 2 pizzas instead of one.

This came out good, but I did the following to it:  1.  I used all purpose flour since I had no bread flour and had to add an additional 1/4 cup of flour because it was too tacky. 2.  I added approx. 1 tsp of Italian seasoning. 3.  I brushed the dough with olive oil after rolling it out. 4.  I baked it for about 7 minutes in the oven and then added the toppings.  This is good for a quick and easy bread dough.

The dough came out well, but it was too thick. Our pizza came out really doughy especially in the center underneath the toppings. I think next time I will put the dough in the oven for a few minutes first and then top the pizza.

Wow! This was the first time I have ever made pizza at home and it was so easy! The crust was incredibly quick and simple to make, rose up nice and thick, and tasted great. The only change I made was substituting canola for olive oil. Will definitely be making again.

Great! The only changes I made was to add 1 tablespoon of wheat gluten to all purpose flour because I did not have any bread flour. Also I prebaked the crust for 9 minutes, I like a crispy crust. I love this recipe and will use it again!

Yeast hates me, but this recipe turned out. Delicious! The dough itself tasted a little salty, so next time I'll cut back a bit, but I think that is just me.

It was good, but I think I may have cooked it too long. My oven settings seem to be off quite a bit (an old stove).  I made two mexican pizzas; I added fresh cilantro and fresh garlic to one, and the other I added taco spices.  My kids loved them and my oldest daughter said that every pizza place should make this exact pizza.

I changed it to five stars because I figured out a way to make the crust very similar to popular chain pizzeria's.  I preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  I leave about two inches of crust plain all the way around and then I brush olive oil with melted butter on the plain part of the crust, place in oven for about 8-10 minutes.  REbrush the plain part of crust and place in oven for another 8-10 minutes.  I've done this many times and it works every time.

This was great! I decided late in the day to make pizza for dinner, and didn't have time to make my usual crust recipe. I tried this one, and was SO happy with the results. It will probably be my new "usual" crust recipe! After I assembled my pizza before putting it in the oven, I spread a little melted butter and italian seasoning on the edge of the crust. Very tasty!

This is the easiest pizza dough!I used to dread making any kind of dough because of the amount of time required to rise and knead, etc. This one is so easy, dough is ready to go into the oven in about 15 minutes! It comes out perfect!

Tried this last night and again this morning (because last night's was a superhit at the office)  Is quick, easy to make, and is nicely chewy and yummy. I took the advice of another reviewer of adding onion powder to my second batch, and it tasted delicious.  Amazing stuff.

A wonderful quick-dough recipe.  I've found that a few more minutes of rest time before baking makes a major difference within the rise of the final product.

Another alternative to adding spices to the dough...Once the pie crust is rolled out, before I fill up with sauce and cheese, I brush a thin layer of extra virgin olive oil over the crust. I normally keep a container of oil with some crushed red peppers, oregano, and rosemary in it for just this purpose. It made such a big difference!  It also makes a great compromise if not everyone likes spice.

I thought this was great as written. One change was I used instand yeast because that is what I have. My only problem is that it wasn't so chewy like dominos. Oh well...it was delicous!

i didn't give this 5 stars because i took others suggestions and added spices to the crust. i think w/o them it would be kind of bland.  i used 1tsp. each of oregano and basil, and 1/2tsp. of garlic powder and parsley. the dough looked alittle biscuit looking and didn't feel as smooth as a dough that takes time to rise, but i have to say i was impressed that it tasted as good as it did, and of course the big bonus is not having to spend alot of time waiting for it to rise.  thank you chef rider, i plan on making this alot more

Pretty good crust.  It's nice not to have to wait for the crust to rise.  We like it better when adding 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp onion powder and 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the crust when mixing together.  We also find it mixes just as well with your hands, then you don't have to get out the mixer.

I've never made my own pizza crust before and wasn't too sure I could but I have used this recipe a few times now and I love it. I took one reviewer's suggestions and added a teaspoon of italian seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon onion powder to olive oil before mixing it in. I let it rest for about 20 minutes. I also added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder to olive oil to brush onto the crust. Then I bake it for atleast 5 minutes before adding the toppings. Comes out great and either makes one thick crust pizza or two thin crusts.

Wow! loved this crust.  I usually make Jay's sig. crust (found on this site), but didn't have time tonight.  This turned out so soft and browned nicely - even though my Daughter way overloaded the toppings.  I followed the directions exactly, the only thing I was confused about was the mixing time of the dough.  I did about 3 min in the Kitchen Aid Mixer with the dough hook, then let it rest for 5 min on top of the warm stove. This one has moved to the front of my recipe box.

great crust recipe. I tried it first as directed (but let it sit for 30 minutes) and it came out alright.  Next time around I used INSTANT YEAST and mixed the yeast with all the dry ingredients together, then mixed in the wet ingredients together and added it to the dry. mixed and kneaded it together. then let it sit for 30 minutes before rolling it out for baking. --> It came out great!! Light and fluffy just the way that I like it! Great recipe!

I had been using the traditional boxes of pizza crust mix until I found this recipe. My family loves this crust. We love pizza and I could never get the crust exactly the way that I wanted it until now. I use this at least once a week now. My husband asks me all the time, "When are we having pizza again". Thank you so much for sharing!!!

I have never made my own pizza crust before, but we decided to try this the other night.  My bf is NOT a fan of home-made pizza and always prefers order-in.  Well....... I doubled it in my stand mixer with the dough hook, and added some pizza spices.  Then I made a sticky mess when I tried to shape the dough and roll it out.  tip= use a lot of extra flour!    The results were two 12-13 inch pizzas!  We used jarred sauce since I didn't have a ton of time to make sauce.  His came out GrEAT in about 15 minutes, nice and lightly browned.  I didn't know how long mine had been cooking, so I took it out a little too soon and it was still a little doughy in the middle.  The main thing though, is the taste was great, super fluffy crust and the bf RAVED about this crust!!  Looks like we will be making this often!  THANKS!!!!

This is the first time I have made pizza crust, but this turned out great.  I didn't have bread flour so I used all purpose flour, and it work fine. I also put grated cheese in the edge of the crust and turned it under to get a cheese stuffed pizza.  I used Easy Pizza Sauce 111, it was wonderful.  My husband is a big fan of pizza and I can take it or leave it, this one made me want to make it again.  I Love it.

This crust was AMAZING, even my hubby loved it and he is super picky about his crust!  I've made 4 pizzas in 3 days, it's that good!  I forgot to add in the oil, and put in 1/2 cup whole wheat flour in place of the white.  I let it rise for 5-10 minutes then pre-baked it for about 7 minutes before adding the toppings.  Since many others said it the crust was a bit bland I did put some italian seasoning and garlic powder into the pizza sauce just in case.  I can't wait to mass make and freeze these for nights when we don't have a lot of time to cook!

This was great and very quick.  I followed the recipe exactly. Mixed it in my kitchen aid with the dough hook. I used the whole dough and baked it on a pizza stone.  It was like a deep dish pizza.  Next time I try it I will divide in half and make 2 thin crust pies and add some spices as suggested by others.

This was super easy to make and is the best pizza crust ever! I coated the bottom of my pizza pans with olive oil and it turned out great! update: I added 1 tbsp of italian seasoning and 1 tsp of garlic powder to the dough and it added a lot of flavor.

So delicious! Truly a cinch!

I added oregano and garlic salt to mine and let it rest / rise for 15 minutes before patting out. The result was a really nice crust that was kind of crispy on the outside and nice and soft and moist on the inside. My boyfriend says it's the best pizza ever! Excellent recipe! Will absolutely use again!

As someone else said, this crust is more like a focaccia, but still quite good. I did as others have and used the baking powder, additional flower, and one egg. Next time I'm going to use the recommended amount of flour and see if the crust is a little lighter. Overall, we liked it a lot and I think its a good base for other recipes such as artichoke dip bread, etc. This is the first pizza dough I've made that stood up to the toppings. We'll make it again because the kids loved it.

This is the best pizza dough!  I have made many other, longer and harder recipes, and this pizza dough tastes as good, or better than all those.  Since I tried this recipe (I found it about a year ago or so) I only use this one.  So simple and so yummy!  My grandma requested the recipe, so I am printing it out for her now. :)

This is the best crust recipe I've tried!  My husband was skeptical at first because we usually use a recipe where the crust has to rise for some time...but this was the BEST!!  It couldn't be any easier.  Thank you

It was quick, it was easy.  It was a good texture, but quite bland.  I will make it again if I am short of time, but I will take others advice and add some seasonings.  Overall it was a success!

This is really quite good and you simply can't beat it when you don't have the time to wait for the dough to rise. I mix garlic powder and fresh herbs to make my crust extra flavorful. Thanks for the great recipe, I will use it regularly.

This pizza was ok for me, but my 12 year old loved it.  My dough came out too thick but I think that was my fault since I left it to rise a long time.  Easy and texture was good, I felt flavor wise it needed something more!..

Very easy and fast for a hungry family. We rarely order out anymore-I can make this faster than the delivery guy can get here! We also make breadsticks from this recipe-sprinkled with garlic butter and parmesean cheese.

This is my go-to pizza crust recipe. I make it once a week. I don't change a thing. The kids love rolling out their own mini pizzas and sometimes we top them with sliced apples and cinnamon sugar for dessert pizzas. It's perfect and so versatile!

I was looking for a quick and easy project to do with my 4 year old this weekend when it was raining. This is a Great crust, quick & easy just like the name, even the picky husband liked it.  I doubled the recipe to make it fit in my stonewear pan and added garlic powder, parsley & orgeano. Soft and chewy, Definaly a keeper!

This is very good.  It's a bit sweet.  I think next time I'll coat with olive oil and put some garlic powder on it.  It needed a little zing.

Wow!!! This recipie is awesome.  I can not believe that I made such a great pizza on the first try.  I used extra virgin olive oil in this recipie.  I drizzled a little olive oil on top of pizza and pizza crust (smoothed oil in on crust)just prior to sticking pizza in oven.  I also sprikled a little oregano and italian seasoning on dough, just before I rolled out dough.  Mmmm Delish!! Definately a keeper!!!

So quick, easy and fool-proof!  All of my other attempts at pizza crust have produced dough that is too elastic or rises too much during baking, I had no problems with this dough.  BTW, I used unbleached flour and canola oil and it still turned out great.

I will never make any other pizza crust ever again!  It was so easy to work with, and tasted great!!  I did let it rise a little longer.  I cooked it for about 5 minutes, and then took it to a friends house to make pizza for a football game.  It did great!!

I used all-purpose flour, as that is what I had.  I also didn't roll it onto cornmeal, just cut it into single serving size and pressed it into thin crust pizzas.  It was very easy, and turned out good.  I can't say it was "great", it could maybe use some Italian seasoning to add flavor.  Like I said, it was "good", and I will do it again.

I am so glad that I put the boxed stuff back and found this great recipe. It was easy and went great with my bar b que chicken pizza. This is a must have recipe on those nights when you want a fast pizza and don't have time for a rising crust.

My family and I make pizza about every week or 2 and had always used the dough mixes (in a pouch) --- not any more! This is simple, and even though it takes a little bit longer than the pouch kind, it is SO much better!  I'd say it's as good as a pizzeria.  Since we make pizza often enough, I bought the yeast in a jar - it's much more economical. I threw it all in my Kitchenaid mixer with the hook attachment and mixed in extras like grated parmesan, Italian spices and garlic powder to give it a bit more flavor.  First time we put them in regular round pizza pans, but this time, just for kicks, we're trying spreading it into half-sheet jelly roll pans to make the pizza bigger and give it a thinner crust.  But don't get me wrong - the regular pizza pan rounds gave us a nice thick, yummy crust that was oh so delicious.  I like to bake my crusts for about 5-7 minutes first without toppings, then take out and decorate and put back in til the cheese is just golden on the edges. If you try this pizza dough recipe, you won't want store bought mixes or ready-made crusts ever again!

This was my first attempt at making a pizza crust from scratch.  We were all pleasantly surprised at how good it was!  I took the advice of adding herbs to the crust (1/2 tsp basil, oregano and 1/4 tsp onion powder) and a little bit of honey.  I also used a 50/50 blend of whole wheat and white flour.  We made a pineapple pizza that my family of four devoured!

Just fabulous! Makes a great pizza dough in no time. I subbed in 1/2 whole wheat flour the second time I made it with good results. I think this will be the only dough I will make from now on.

Perfect tasty crust! I changed the flour to 1 1/2 c bread flour and 1 c whole wheat, and added a couple tbl honey. Added the wet ingredients to a center well in the dry mixture. Absolutely delicious!

This will be our go-to recipe for pizza crust from now on, replacing store-bought frozen and home-made recipes. I was attracted to this recipe because I've had many failures with pizza crust before- this was quick, easy, AND delicious! Added Penzey's pasta sprinkle to the mix but otherwise made as is. For those who like to buy the jars of yeast (instead of the packets), use 2 1/4 tsp. Yumm!

excellent recipie, turned out just like pizza hut pizza crust!!! YUM, alhtough it was messy but very well worth the effort. I just found a little problem with dough being slightly oversticky and hard to roll out, so i just place the whole dough into the pan and 'punched' dough flat. it turned out great, dont even worry about sides being too thick, it will just become the nice and fluffy!!! thanks for uploading:) will use this whenever i bake pizza. However it u are someone who like crispy and hard crust, this is not something you should try.

I used this to make breadsticks and they turned out fantastic! I did add some basil, oregano, garlic powder and onion powder to the dough and it was very good. This is my new go to pizza dough recipe!

This is fantastic for such a quick recipe. I did let it rise about 10 minutes but that's still incredibly fast for a homemade yeast crust. I cooked the pizzas on pizza stones sprinkled with cornmeal. I made one batch straight by the recipe and then made a half-batch using all whole-wheat flour with a bit of vital wheat gluten added. It turned out great! is my new favorite whole-wheat pizza crust recipe.

This dough is always easy to work with and I find it to be very versatile.  I use it to make "hot pockets" with cooked ground beef, ketchup, mustard, brown sugar and a cheese slice.  I also use it to cover a split hotdog filled with a mixture of ketchup, Nance's mustard and brown sugar and half a slice of cheese.  I bake them at 400 for about 20 minutes.
Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I was looking for a quick easy recipe that still tasted good.  This was one of the best homemade pizza crusts I have tasted.  I ended up using half all-purpose flour/half whole wheat flour because I didn't have any bread flour.  The suggetions of herbs in the crust and garlic in the olive oil worked great.  I also baked it in the oven for 5 minutes before I put the toppings on it and then baked it for 15 minutes with the toppings on it.  This is great recipe to try!

Great quick crust. I like to bake it first, then add toppings and melt the cheese. It keeps it crunchier if you need to reheat some the next day. Great for a quick lunch or dinner.

My family loves this recipe. It's so simple & quick. I'll never make pizza dough in the bread machine again. I used fast rising bread machine yeast as this was all I had, I mixed it with the dry ingredients, added the wet ingredients and beat it with the dough hooks on my electric beater for a couple of minutes. I let it rest 15 minutes to allow the quick rise yeast to activate. As others suggested, I baked the crust for 7 minutes before putting the toppings on. This worked great, except I didn't prick the first crust with a fork and it rose up like a balloon, I poked the next one a few times and it worked out much better. This crust is also great with non-traditional toppings such as Alfredo sauce and chicken, or brushed with garlic & herb olive oil and topped with vegies.

Oh wow, this was good!  I added some garlic powder, basil and oregano to the crust, added 3 Tbsp of olive oil on accident, and oiled the pan with olive oil and sprinkled it with garlic powder.  Delicious!   Paired it with Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site and it was a Quick and Easy Exquisite Pizza!  Will most definatly be making this again and again and again!

Great easy crust. Anyone can make delicious homemade pizza with this crust. I prebaked the crust for about 7 minutes to make sure the middle cooked all the way with toppings.

If you like a thinner crust go for this one. I rolled it thin and baked it was super. I added some garlic salt instead of reg salt to the dough and it is very tasty! Way easy and tastes so much better than frozen.

I tried this and we felt this is the best homemade we've had. I didn't have bread flour on hand so used regular flour and it turned out  very good.  I am excited to try with Bread flour. The outside of the pizza crust was "puffed" up but the crust where the ingredients lay on top of didn't get as thick as I hoped but it may due to not using bread flour. Would DEFINETELY do again.

I let my dough rise and this is by far the best homemade pizza crust. For a different pizza, I suggest using taco sauce instead of pizza sauce and topping with taco meat, refried beans, crushed tortilla chips, tomatoes, green chiles, and a taco blend cheese. Fantastic!

This was really easy to make, I didn't need a mixer or bread machine. I didn't pre cook the crust and I thought it turned out great. I did taste the dough first and I thought that maybe it had to much salt, but after I piled on all my toppings I didn't notice any saltiness. Great recipe will make all the time.

Very good! We like thin crust, so next time I will freeze half the dough for the next pizza! I made the crust and let my kids add the toppings - they had a blast and it tasted great! Will make this crust now instead of ordering out! Great recipe!

Very quick and easy - I used all purpose flour and vegetable oil as well as adding herbs in with the flour and it turned out quite delicious. I got my toppings ready while the yeast and dough rested and the timing was perfect. Will definitely make again.

Thank you Amanda!!! I have always wanted to make pizza at home, but never attempted to because the dough was just too much work! Well, now that I have two small children, I am so thrilled to have this recipe and be able to make personal size pizzas with them without spending tons of time on kneading etc. I use my stand mixer with dough hook and find it to be soooo easy and DELICIOUS!! (I cook mine at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes and that seems to work out perfect for me). Every time I make it it comes out better and better (now that I have figured out how to work with the yeast)and the kids love making their own pizza! I have even used this recipe to make breadsticks and brushed them with olive oil and then dusted them with garlic powder, oregano and parmesean cheese -AWESOME! Next I plan to try to make calzones. Thanks again Amanda!

This was my first homemade pizza crust.  I had a new pizza stone with limited ingredients on hand, and I thought it still turned out well. I used all-purpose flour and vegetable oil.  If using all purpose flour, you will need to have a WELL floured surface to roll out the dough.  Make sure to use plenty of corn meal if transferring the crust from a pizza peel onto a preheated pizza stone.  I will probably pick up bread flour and olive oil and make again.  A definite keeper!

We loved this crust!  It was so easy to make and it worked perfectly for a super thin crust pizza.  If you make the full batch, you get two thin crusts out of it!  We saved the second to use the next time.  All I can say is I have no intention of ever ordering pizza for delivery ever again!  This was a perfect crust for us!

Awesome recipe.  I've made it many times.  The whole family loves it.  I bake it in my cast iron pancake griddle.  Also, I use all-purpose flour, because that's what I always have on hand.  The bad review that said it "poured out" when they used all-purpose flour.... doesn't make any sense.  I'm thinking they might have gotten distracted and altered the recipe by mistake.  I wish they would try it again. I highly recommend this recipe.

I found it an easy and quick recipe. I read someone elses that gave it only one star saying they used regular flour and it turned out bad and gooey wadd of dough. I used regular flour and was great but I also used my hands to stir it and think maybe they should of too. There's no replacement for experience in the kitchen and just old fashioned know how.

Really good!  I added some garlic powder and a small amount of Italian seasoning to the dough.  It was a tad thicker than I wanted (I was trying to emulate NY-style pizza), but still delicious!  I baked it for about ten minutes on a preheated pizza stone before I added the sauce and toppings, then baked it another ten.  This is the first homemade pizza I've ever attempted, and I was very impressed with the results.  Very fun to make, too!!

not only quick and easy, but also really tasty!!! I was afraid that it would turn out super dense (especially because i never work with yeast) but despite how scared I was and how sticky the dough seemed, it turned out really fluffy and delicious!

I've tried other recipes, but this is the favorite in my house!  It was chewy without being overly thick, and was easy to shape.  This dough would also make awesome breadsticks!  After topping the dough I brushed olive oil around the edges and sprinkled garlic powder around.  I used a preheated pizza stone, and went ahead and topped the pizza on the stone.  The bottom of the crust was already starting to crisp before it was in the oven.  It think this helped with the overall end product.

Amanda, this is a fantastic recipe! I've made this too many times to count anymore and it always turns out wonderfully. This is our favorite "fast" crust. I do let my yeast foam for 15 min. and then let the dough sit for 10-15 as well, depending on the time I have available. It is STILL much faster than traditional doughs which take over an hour of rise time alone. I cook this on a perforated pizza pan on the bottom rack for a nice crisp crust. I can get 1 thick crust pizza or two 12" thin crusts from this.

It's definitely quick and easy, and delicious! The dough was quite thick for one pizza, so I split it and froze the other half.

This crust was awesome....but I did let it "proof" before baking and I think it made a difference.I have made it both ways and definately the rising helps. I also used bread flour and my husband , who managed a Papa John's while in college, hand tossed the crust.....it turned out great.Thanks!

This was my first time making pizza! It was great! Since I am originally from New York, I made mine New York style and thinned that crust! Wow!  The recipe made two pizza's. I let my fingers do the talking and added flour slowly as I kneaded/needed. However, I need a pizza stone because the bottom of the pizza crust did not brown to my taste. The recipe itself was a great success.

I just had to say thank you for the first and only pizza crust recipe that has ever worked for me and my family. Even the prepackaged stuff was horrible compared to this simple recipe. I threw everything into my little trusty food processer, blending for about a min, it was just that simple. The reason only four stars because I needed to add a few spice enhancements to make the dough just right for us. Fantastic!!! My family and I thank you.

With a great, quick & easy recipe like this around, why would ANYONE resort to that purchased "crust" (and I use the term loosely) that hangs in a plastic bag at the end of the grocery aisle?  This was delicious and my 5-year-old (who was wanting pizza for lunch after being sick for many days) and me enjoyed making it immensely. I used 1/2 whole-wheat pastry flour, by the way.  Yummmmmmmy!

I found this recipe because I was looking for something quick and easy that I had all the ingredients for.  I had to use a package of yeast that was about a month and a half past its "rises faster before" date, but it still rose OK and tasted great.  When I got to the part where I mix the flour and salt and oil in I used garlic salt instead of regular salt and I added some basil and oregano for an herbed pizza crust.  Then I mixed it with my hands and let it rise for about 45 minutes while I prepared my other ingredients for my pizza.  I also preheated the crust by itself before I added the other ingredients since that is what my pizza recipe called for and it turned out delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

It was pretty good. Makes for too soft and crumbly of a crust. Not a bad NY style crust. I'll mimic what others said about the slow cooking.

I liked this recipe because it gave me time to prepare the rest of the toppings while I let this dough set.  But I did add a tsp each of Italian Seasoning and Garlic Powder.  It was very tasty.  Since I let it sit for 1/2 hour I also got 2 thin crust pizza's out of the one dough.  My husband said that it was one of the best that he had.

I was quite impressed with the results, especially considering how easy and quick it was. I let the dough rise a bit longer (closer to 15 mins) and added Italian seasonings. Nice chewy texture.

Kinda bland tasting,and it was not chewy it was more crunchy, however, that may be because when I checked on it after 15 minutes, the cheese was very burned, but the crust wasn't. It seemed to be done perfectly. I added more cheese on top, and ate it, didn't taste burned, it actually didn't taste liek anythign at all.
Better than frozen pizza, no comparison to take out pizza. Will keep looking.

VERY good crust.  Chewy & slightly crisp on the outside.  I thought it was similar to the crusts Digorno or Freshetta (or any good quality frozen pizza) use, but better.  It was the perfect crust for me :)

So much cheaper than canned dough, store bought dough, or ready-made shells. Not to mention the taste, which blows all of the above out of the water. I'm never buying pizza crusts again!!

This pizza crust was great! This was the first crust I ever made, and it was an instant hit. I made a BBQ chicken pizza with this and it worked well. Be warned though, crust does rise pretty high.

Great pizza crust, considering how quick it is. Not as good as a crust that is allowed to rise, but great if you're in a hurry. If you can let it sit longer than 5 minutes, it seems to taste better.

Pizzalicious! I will definitely make this crust again! It came out chewy on the inside and crusty on the outside. I made two medium size pizzas. I divided the dough and rolled them thin into a pizza stone and topped it with pizza sauce and cheese. So easy to make and saves me time! Daughters and hubby love this crust. Will make it again!

Three years ago my family and I started a tradition of making pizza on Christmas Eve.  Thei first year I made this crust and a crust in the bread machine.  Believe it or not my family actually like this crust a whole lot more! I like to add a touch more olive oil and dried basil and oregano to the crust with the flour.

Awesome!  I started making a mental list of all my friends to send this to even before I was finished baking it.  Completely workable dough.  It rolls great,; no stickiness whatsoever. Flips onto pizza stone pretty as you please.  I rolled a little bigger than pan size and placed cheese around the edges and rolled them inward for a 'stuffed crust'.  Also added Italian spices to rolled out crust for a truly Italian crust. This one is definitely a keeper.  No more pre-baked crusts for me!

Excellent recipe for someone who doesn't want to wait the required time for most recipes. Useful for other recipes also, like bread sticks and such.

GREAT crust, esspecially considering the short time it can be made in! (I love the mix and bake!) The taste is very basic but good. Our homemade pizza night was a huge success thanks to this easy dough/crust! Didn't change a thing and will certainly use this again. Thanks Amanda!

I was looking for a quick but GREAT-tasting pizza dough recipe.  This was very good!  I used it to make mexican pizza.  I simply topped it with taco sauce, refried beans, and lots of cheese.  I think I'm going to try varying the recipe by adding garlic and other flavorings, but this version is just wonderful!

Super quick and very easy. The first pizza crust I've ever made and I was surprised at how well it turned out! We didn't have a pizza pan, so we used a baking sheet. The dough was nice and chewy with a crisp crust. Thanks!!

We all thought that this was a nice crust. I used regular flour and did let dough rest about half hour. I used a pizza stone and crust came out crispy with a nice center.It held up good with all the toppings. It was so easy and fast! Thanks Amanda for sharing.

This is an EXCELLENT pizza crust recipe, made even better with the use of a pizza stone.  I've not bought either frozen or restaurant pizzas since as they are not a patch on this crust!  Easy as anything, too!  I halve it, load it up with tomato sauce, mozzerella, ham, sweet red peppers, black olives and feta for a wonderful, thin crust pizza, or use it as is for a thicker crust!  Brilliant!

Found this last minute and it was so easy and fast to do. I bought the jarred yeast and followed the tip from another review. I did make the dough first and left it at the side to rise. But only while I cut up the toppings. The longer you leave it to raise the easier the dough was to stretch. I used 100% pure olive oil. Using different types like “extra virgin” will give you a different taste. It was delicious and will be our usual family recipe for pizza.

Quick, easy, and delicious.  I've made pizza dough many times before, but this was my first time making this recipe and it is definitely going to be my new go to.  I followed the recipe exactly and used my Kitchenaid to mix and knead the dough.  I was impressed by how fluffy the dough was underneath the crunchy exterior considering how fast it had risen.  I only baked my pizza for 15 minutes at 450 and it turned out perfect.  There aren't any extra spices in the dough recipe and I probably wouldn't add any as they could slow down the rising process.  We added extra seasoning to our tomato sauce to compensate and loved the final flavor.

Easy and delicious. I use a little bacon fat or crisco, instead of olive oil in the dough so that it holds its shape and resists breaking.

This is pretty much the exact same recipe I use for dough that needs to rise, except I use all purpose flour. It's my go to recipe! I think people who are having troubles arent as experienced with pizza making... if you are having troubles make sure you are kneading the dough until very smooth (I use my stand mixer) and put your pan or stone in the oven to get hot before preparing the pizza on it. Make sure your oven is  very hot. If you have the time you could let this dough rise.

Love the recipe,  only thing I  do differently is since I don't want my crust too dry (by rolling with flour or cornmeal)  is I  pour a tablespoon of olive oil in the sheet pan and spread it by hand. Coating both my palms with oil, I take my rested dough and knead it out on the pan instead of rolling.  It's just a personal preference.

This has become our favorite pizza dough.  The dough is a little wetter than I'm used to, but I resist the urge to add flour and it turns out great...crispy on the very bottom,  chewy in the middle. 

I just press the dough into a 14" circle on parchment paper, add toppings, and then transfer the paper and all to a preheated baking stone. By the time the top is lightly browned, the dough is cooked through. The dough rises slightly while I'm preparing the toppings, resulting in a hand tossed type of crust...not thick, not thin, but somewhere in between.

Perfect! Used unbleached all purpose flour & had enough to make it with edge of stuffed cheese crust. Used a well seasoned pampered chef pizza stone & had to cook for 8 min longer.

This crust is pretty good. I give myself extra time while making it to let the dough rise twice. The first time I let it rise 2 hours, and the second rise I let the dough rise for an hour. I made this recipe twice. It worked well both as a single pizza pan sized pizza and split in to two cast iron skillet sized pizzas. We will keep using this recipe in the future.

Love how easy this dough is!  It is so fast and also taste, it makes homemade pizza for lunch an easy thing!  I have even used it to make bread sticks and cinnamon rolls when I ended up with a little extra.  It rises beautifully but is also easy enough to roll out thin for those who love thin crusts.

I teach middle school FCS (primarily cooking), and have made this recipe hundreds of times with 13 year olds during our very short 40 minute class periods. It comes out perfect every time!

We don't have enough time during class to allow the dough to rise at all, and it still comes out great. We also never need to bake it for more than 10 minutes.

You can also make freezer pizzas with this dough. Par bake the dry crust for about 3-4 minutes, let cool, add toppings, flash freeze, then wrap and store! Cook like a normal frozen pizza (at 450 until lightly golden).

Followed recipe, but added to flour 1/4 tsp salt plus a dash, 1/2 + tsp garlic powder, oregano, and basil. I also took reviewer A.S.G.'s advice and preheated oven to 450° per instructions, then put in dough on my round cast iron pizza pan on bottom rack and upped the temp to 500° for 5 min, then returned oven to 450° while adding sauce and toppings, then put back in oven on bottom rack. baked for 12 min. I used All Purpose Flour. We really liked this crust. It's my new go to pizza crust, and maybe also some bread sticks. Thanks for the great recipe!

For what it is meant to be - quick, easy, tasty - it's perfect. It's not going to outperform more involved recipes, but for something so low-fuss it is remarkably good. I make it regularly and have never been disappointed.

It was good. Made no changes at all. Very easy. Baked for 20 minutes which was maybe a tad too long.  A little dry but great flavor.

It’s decent.  My kids are eating it so that’s a win.  The crust is a little dense but that might be my fault, the instructions didn’t really say whether to use a dough hook or paddle attachment or for how long to mix so I just guessed.  Maybe I did it too long and that’s why it was dense.  I’d make it again for my kids though.

I only add basil and oragano to the crust while I was rolling it out.  Instead of cornmill i used bread flour.  In addition, I made calzones with the dough.

Followed the recipe as written,  the only thing I did was allow the dough to rest for about 15 minutes after mixing.  The dough was very easy to stretch, and held its shape without constantly needing to re-stretch.  I doubled the recipe and made two portions of dough.  After topping the dough, I baked them on a preheated pizza stone at 500 degrees, the dough had a good rise, the crust was crispy.  Excellent for a last minute option for dinner, the wife and kids gave it thumbs up!

I have made it as is, and I have adjusted it.

I prefer an adjustment, but that defeats the quick and easy part. 
I do at least a 30 minute rise, adding herbs and seasonings into the dough.

My family gobbled this up!  One batch made 2 thin round pizzas.  I used all purpose flour and it turned out just fine.  I also used closer to 3 cups of flour as the dough was too sticky. Will make this again!

The. Best. Pizza. Dough. Ever! Seriously, we have tried so many different recipes. This one rises so nicely and has a good flavor. I make extra for other purposes.. we have only tried cinnamon rolls so far.. but oh they were yummy.

This is a great recipe!! Best homemade dough out there. I’ve made it a few times now. We do let it rise a bit and make 2 pizzas from it. Highly recommended. But don’t tell my friends and family... gotta keep this one to myself!

Never made any dough from scratch and this came out perfect! I used  King Arthur bread flour and followed all the directions closely. I used a half baking sheet pan and this filled up the pan making for a nice 'pan pizza' style crust. I'd half the dough and be sure to roll it out if you want a thin crust.

Followed recipe except I added some garlic and parsley to dough. I actually did let it rise for about 45 minutes prior to shaping and instead of baking right away, I premade the entire pizza, covered it in plastic wrap and kept it in the fridge until dinner. LOVED it. Was crisp on the outside and "fluffy" inside. My 7 year olds LOVED it too. All kids love pizza, but not all devour the crusts like they did! I will definitely use this recipe next time.

Easy to make, even with hurting hands (arthritis) and no mixer! The store-bought dough I had on hand only made enough for two people & I needed enough for at least 4 more asap, so I opened my AR app, sorted by popularity & crossed my fingers. Wasn’t even sure my yeast was good, but I just went with it and it was better than the store bought refrigerated crust!

It was my first time making any kind of dough from scratch and this was literally a fool-proof recipe! Super simple to make, quick, and turned out perfectly cooked! I baked it for 20 minutes and it made a large size pizza for the family. (The only tweak i made was to melt butter, garlic, and italian seasoning in a small bowl and rubbed it on the crust for an italian taste.) It was definitely a hit and i will use this recipe in the future!

Easy peasy! I added a bunch of spices. It rolled out easier than any crust recipe I've ever used before. I made two. One was roasted garlic, onion powder, oregano, basil, and salt. The second one was roasted galic, crushed red pepper, oregano, salt.  It's in the oven looking and smelling great!

I’m a novice in the kitchen so I love this recipe because it is quick and easy.  On my first try I followed the instructions exactly and pre-heated the oven at step 1.  The pizza was ready by the time the oven was up to temp, with a few minutes to spare.  The pizza came out great and the dough thickness doubled perfectly while in the oven for 15 min.  Next time I plan to cook it on the grill!!

This dough puffed up nice and quick in the oven. Was a little sticky to work with, but with a little more flour it was fine. It’s very similar to the kind of dough you get at a regular pizza place. My husband loved it, but next time I’ll add the Italian season like others suggested.

My whole family loved this and we haven’t bought another pizza crust from the store since. I followed another reviewer’s advice and added basil (3/4 tsp), oregano (3/4 tsp), and onion powder (1/2 tsp) to the dough which added some nice flavor. My husband decided to roll string cheese into the crust to make “stuffed crust” pizza and it turned out pretty delicious. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

I used a little more flour than called for. Just enough so the dough is not sticky. I used a pizza stone as well. Once rolled out I placed the dough on the flour dusted stone for 3 minutes then removed and topped the pizza then cooked for another 15 minutes. Since my stone isn't very large this made enough for two medium pizzas. Turned out great!!

The pizza crust that I made using this recipe was on the right consistency: not too soft, and not too hard. My wife even liked the crust better than her favorite pizza chain (Domino's). I will definitely use this recipe again when I make homemade pizzas in the future. Great work!

Just made this tonight with my 4 year old. The entire family LOVES it. I doubled the recipe and made mini pizzas for now and then some for freezing. 
I accidentally added 2 tablespoons of salt instead of 2 teaspoons. I also was out of olive oil so I added vegetable oil. In the dough I also added a tablespoon of Italian seasoning & 1/2 teaspoon of garlic poweder to it. 
Will be our go to recipe! So amazing - thanks for sharing

For being so fast and easy, this recipe is fantastic! My only change would be to turn the temperature down to 425 so the cheese doesn’t burn, but I’ll definitely try making this again.

Awesome crust, and super easy! This crust is a little thicker, so one suggestion I have (if you like your crust on the thin side) is to separate the dough into two parts and make two separate pizzas, or just half the recipe.  But overall, a really simple and quick pizza crust!

My kid and his friends came over and wanted to make pizzas, so we whipped up this batch of pizza dough within minutes. It was so easy to make, plus I accidentally skipped the 10 min wait for the yeast + water and the dough still came out perfect.

This is a pretty decent and quick recipe. However, the dough is much better in every way if you let it rest for at least an hour.

DAIRY FREE
I made this exactly as described then used DAIYA Dairy Free Mozzarella with CLASSICO Traditional Pizza Sauce.  Kids loved the pizza especially the crust.  It looks like restaurant grade pizza and tastes very good.  The dough was very sticky and a bit hard to spread so it came out thicker than what we are used to, but not as thick as pan pizza.  Would definitely make again.

The only thing I did differently was to use regular flour instead of bread flour (regular was what I had on hand). This crust doesn't shrink up like some do when baking. It's perfectly crispy and flavorful! Thanks for a great recipe, Chef Rider!

I didn’t have super high hopes for this but I was lazy and wanted pizza tonight. This definitely works & it’s not horrible, but it is pretty much just bread. I think if you made this and put it in a bread tin it would make great (& easy) sandwich bread. As a pizza dough it leaves much to be desired but when you’re hungry and have a hankering it’ll do the trick. I would recommend making dough the day before though! turns out 1000x better. :)

This recipe is great! It’s so fast and simple; it takes less than 45 minutes to create fresh, yummy pizza. The crust is chewy and delicious, even with normal flour and a cookie sheet.

I made it according to the recipe, although I did use all purpose flour instead of bread flour, it still turned out beautifully. The whole family loved it. I loved making it it was quick  and simple - no rising. I made it in my KitchenAid mixer, which made it all that much simpler. I have saved this recipe and will be making it again for sure!

I make this all the time. It makes a really big pie (the size of a cookie sheet) and regular flour works well if you don't have bread flour.

I loved this pizza crust.  It was so easy to make at a moments notice I can make home made pizza and even better home made pizza on the grill.  The only substitution I made is I used King Arthur Italian flour and it was amazing! Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

Excellent recipe. I have made it twice, once where I cut the recipe in half (I did not have enough yeast at home to make a full recipe) which made enough for one crust, and a second time with a somewhat thicker crust which took up the whole space on my pizza stone. Both turned out very well.

I made it to the letter and it was amazing! I cooked it the full 20 minutes because my pan wasn’t large so the crust was thicker.

Super easy, super amazing, SUPER quick!  I have a very impatient 13 yr old who actually was able to follow through making this.  She has very little experience in the kitchen and even so, she did a fantastic job!  Came out super delicious! 
For the second batch, I added seasonings to the dough, parm, garlic powder, Italian seasoning and omg it smelled like an Italian Pizzeria!  I don't know squat about making dough and I am bad at baking because I don't like to measure but this was super easy and I think I am going to try to make bread sticks next time because the dough cooks up light and airy yet crisp on the outside.  I wish I had found this recipe sooner!

I've used this recipe over 30 times  the only difference for me I cook it at 500 degrees Fahrenheit and it's done in 15 minutes and everyone that's tried pizza loves it.

So fast and so good. Really happy with this recipe. I used instant yeast, and it sat for a couple minutes before I added the remaining ingredients. I divided the dough into 6 and made mini pizzas - baked for 8 min. Oil, tomato sauce, cheese and salt on top. My  2 year old and I loved them!

I add up to an additional cup of flour because it stays so sticky. I also mix in Italian or pizza seasoning with the flour. I only let it cook for ten mins, anything over starts to burn the pizza.

FYI, the recipe makes enough for 1 pizza.  And I used 1.5 tsp of yeast (no packets).

Wife said it's the best homemade pizza she's ever had.  Might make again.

Gosh, was this the best!  I doubled the recipe (for an expected crowd of people) and let the dough rest for, oh, about an hour.  It rose beautifully.  Then I punched it down and let it rest for another 15 minutes.  I don't know why, but I just wasn't in a big hurry. Then I halved the dough and rolled out one half the length of an oblong pan (lightly oiled and added in corn meal).  To be naughty, I lightly brushed some olive oil with garlic powder on the top of the crust and then added the marinara sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni and some basil.  Wowsa!  It is an outstanding recipe and a keeper for me.  Seriously.

Super easy.  I needed more oil and water to hold the dough together, but overall it's good crust for very little time and effort.

This is my go-to recipe for pizza and calzones. Doubles easily!  I tried many recipes before this one, and have tried others since, but I always come back to it. ** I do increase the sugar and salt for more flavor. **

This works if you're pressed for time. Proportions are right and the dough it makes is of a good consistency. I was able to let it raise just a little and pre-baked it for a few minutes before adding toppings.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I found a great idea too. If you use  bread machine yeast you throw everything dry together, including the dry yeast. Mix together and add WARM water. I put everything in my mixer. It takes about 2 minutes or so mix it, then I leave it for the 5 minutes, as the recipe calls for, and then complete the process. I saute my vegetables while it is sitting. The hardest thing for me is pressing the dough into the pan.This has meant that I can make pizza once a week if I want. It is soooo easy. Thank you Chef Rider.

I let it sit in a warm place longer than the 5 minutes it said (more like 20 minutes). To make the dough go further this time, I also used an extra quarter cup warm liquid (milk this time) and an extra half cup flour (bread flour) while keeping the rest of ingredients in their original amounts. Worked great! I double the recipe when our family of 6 is all home.

First time making my own crust completely from scratch and it turned out super well!! I let the dough rise longer than stated, and also gave it time to rise for a bit after I spread it out on the pan.  Added more flour as needed and baked until golden brown before adding the toppings and it was crispy on the bottom and soft on the inside. Excited for all the flavor experimentation possibilities!

This recipe is fool proof and easy to make. I made the dough by hand and pre baked the crust for about 10 minutes before adding my toppings. I am so happy to have found this recipe. I will definitely make it again. I can do it everyday!

I worked at pizza joints all thru college, and know my way around pizza from scratch.  For a quick pizza you can’t beat this!  The texture is excellent; crisp (but not crunchy hard) crust with tender-chewy center. It IS lacking in the depth of flavor that you get from an overnight dough so it wouldn’t hurt to supplement a bit of flavor in there as others have suggested although I did not and I was still quite satisfied. What I DID do:  substituted instant yeast for active dry in equal measure (I found I was able to get a decent rise and more spreadable/stretchable dough after letting it rest for maybe 30 min while I prepped toppings); doubled the recipe; used bread flour and baked on a pizza stone as suggested (but I upped the temp to 400).  Also, I have a hard time with red sauce at this stage in life (over 40) so I used an olive oil base - homemade pesto would be fantastic but I was out. I spread it with olive oil and sprinkled Parmesan on the edge for a Parmesan crust (garlic powder would have been good too) and mozzarella in the center. Then sprinkled Italian herb mix on top and added toppings.  This was a great quickie crust recipe to help sooth the craving for a decent hand tossed crust without the $20 sticker shock of local craft pizza shops.  I will add this to favorites and make it again and again.

I made this because I was in a hurry and didn't want to have to wait for the dough to rise and I had to say the end result was there was none of my ham and pineapple pizza left. Particularly liked the texture. Ended up using an 8grm sachet of dry yeast which was perhaps a little too much? But still lived the end result and will certainly use it again when pushed for time.

I really enjoy this recipe, whenever we have pizza, I use this recipe. Often the crust comes out light when the toppings are fully cooked. Overall, I am very satisfied with this recipe.

I used the suggestion of putting some seasoning in with the olive oil ( Italian) and doubled this recipe to make 2 large pizzas and it turned out great. I usually do a thinner crust so I could have gotten away with not doubling it and just rolling it thinner. I used all purpose flour and let it have a half hour rise as well. I would recommend it!

I thought this was a great basic dough recipe, which is perfect for my picky anti-seasoning daughter.  I baked it on a pizza stone and it came out perfectly for my daughter's liking.  And making her happy definitely deserves five stars!

No texture to the dough whatsoever, was more like cornbread.  You MUST knead dough and double rise!

This is my go-to pizza crust. Once I roll out the dough, I brush on a little olive oil and bake for a few minutes and then I put on my toppings and finish baking.

Normally my grandchildren are hard to please.  They loved the pizzas I made using this crust, I doubled the recipe and made two  15" round pizzas  Not only will I make this again I will share the recipe with my friends.

I did bake the crust before putting any toppings on it.  I reheated the oven to 425 and  put the crusts in for 5 minutes. Like other people I added Italian seasoning to the crust .

It was a great dough. Originally I was going to make another dough, but realized I didn't want to wait for the rise time.  The other recipe called for more yeast so I just doubled this recipe. I didn't need that much dough, and froze the second batch. Still turned out great after freezing some dough. Would recommend for something quick, easy and tasty.

I make this pizza crust recipe all the time and it never fails. I use a perforated pizza pan and it browns the bottom like a gas oven (almost). This recipe makes a large pizza.  I used to manage a pizza restaurant so I'm a tad picky. 
The title suits this recipe!

This is my go to recipe. Super quick and easy and makes the perfect amount for a regular sized pizza and individual mini pizzas for 2-3 kids. I spread it out thin and normally use about 1 cup of whole wheat flour to get it crispy.

I hate working with yeast, but I gave this a try anyway. It was SO easy. My two year old helped me make it. It's nice and chewy, and the flavor is good but not amazing-- probably a dough that had a rise to it would be better tasting. However, if you're a yeast-hater like I am and still want to make your own pizza dough, this recipe is a great one!

Very good for a quick crust.   I kneaded the dough in my stand mixer for 5 minutes.  Rolled it out then let it rise for about 20 minutes.  It was perfect.

Fantastic Recipe!  We live in Costa Rica and if you want decent pizza here you pretty much have to make it yourself!  That being said, we are grateful to have found this brilliant fast and easy crust, so easy, in fact that my teenage son uses it nearly every day!  Add a little garlic to the flour and it is just magical!  Thank you for saving us from a life without pizza!!!

So easy and very yummy!  We used our hands instead of a mixer, per another users suggestion. The kids helped and had so much fun!

Best crust recipe I've found! I let the yeast go 10 mins with a bit of extra sugar, makes it a bit fluffier.

I make this recipe every week for movie night. It is just perfect for us. I double the recipe and always throw in a few extra seasonings (savory, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, etc...depending on what I have on hand). I read a previous comment that suggested pre-cooking it for 5 minutes before adding sauce and toppings, so I do that as well. I put the crusts in the oven and crank the heat to 500 while it's in for 5 mintues. Take it out, put heat back down to 450, sauce and top pizzas and back in for 10-15 minutes to finish it op. Seriously. This is quick. Easy. Tasty. Adaptable. Thanks so much!

was soft and very doughy.  I was hoping for more of a thin crust.  This was like a pan pizza.

I've made this a few ways. Just doubled the recipe and used 3 cups all purpose flour  and 2 cups chickpea flour. The results were a thicker soft crust that browned beautifully.

Considering how quick and easy this is, it is great, although a little too bready for me when thick. Depending on how thick/thin you form or roll it, you can get anything from Sicilian style to almost thin crust.

This crust is fantastic! Made a couple adjustments based on what we had on hand. We used all purpose flour and melted room temperature butter in place of the bread flour and oil. I buttered the crust and put garlic powder on it before it went in the oven and again about 5 minutes before it came out because the exposed crust seemed dry and hard. When it was done (took 20 mins) the crust was so delish! We doubled the recipe and got two 12 inch hand tossed pizzas. Will 100% used as a staple. Thank you so much!

Turned out great, but the toppings were done before the dough was fully cooked. Had to put foil on top to keep them from burning

This recipe is awesome. I grew up with homemade pizza crust and was PUMPED to find a recipe that is just as good. It is incredibly simple to throw together. 

We love adding spices in (oregano, basil, garlic, rosemary) and cooking the pizza on a cast iron pan.

I did it! My first pizza. I have avoided it for years, eating only whole grains, thick crunch breads. I made this recipe cut in half because I am one person not eight! The dough was VERY sticky so I added more flour while stirring it. Otherwise it would have remained goohy paste on my hands. I baked it in a metal pastry pan for at least 30 min and it turned out nice. Thick, a bit heavy not crusty but OK. What can I do to make the dough better - lighter and fluffier like a french bread with a crisp crust? 
Thanks, L

I can divide this dough and make (2) 12 inch pizzas. The dough rises well and is very moist and chewy.  My husband likes double pepperoni and bacon on his pizza.

Not the best ever, but tastes homemade, and really is quick. Perfect to throw together for a quick pizza.

I have been repeating this recipe for months! As a broke college student who's always in a mood for pizza, this is amazingly easy and a cheaper option to buying pizza for myself!

This is definitely a simple quick dough! The only things I did different was dropping the oven temp to 400 for personal sized pizzas and kneaded the dough and let it rest. Next time I’m going to add some seasoning and play around with it but still a great basic dough!

I have three teenagers at home and we live in an extremely rural area.  No delivery is available to out home and carryout is nearly an hour each direction. As I became less and less intimidated by yeast recipes I realized there is almost no need to buy things like pizza curst when it can be made so easily at home. This recipe rocks! It is easy and when laid on a Pampered Chef pizza stone creates a strong thin crust, crisp on both sides. BTW, if anyone is interested this recipe x2.5 makes four large pies....the exact dimension of the PC stone. my goal is to make 20 crusts when no one is home and actually get some into the freezer!

A pretty good crust. It takes a bit longer than the recipe says, but overall it tastes very good. A bit on the biscuit-y side.

This is a sturdy dough. Inside was “fluffy”. Not a pizza dough texture.  Not sure why it came out like this.  Maybe this receipe  needs to be separated.  Maybe this was too much dough for my 12” pan.   Pizza slice can be picked up without having that lovely  droop.

Added onion powder to my dough mix due to not having enough flour, and used maseca mix to make up for lack of flour.

This works best with bleached white flour. If using whole grain wheat flour, add 1/8 cup water due to the increased dryness of the dough.

I have been using this recipe for years now, and am actually just now reviewing it (sorry!). Over the years, I have discovered that you can take this to the next level by adding garlic powder and oregano to the dough as you add the flour. And then brush the crust with (garlic?) butter right after you pull it from the oven. It takes this wonderful recipe to the next level with minimal extra effort/ingredients. It's a go to easy dinner around here!

Totally fool proof, easy, quick, cheap recipe!!! I feel like I will never buy pizza again ??

I'm a pizza lover, and I was struggling to get a right recipe to make the dough, this one just saved the day.

I already tried with this dough recipe: bread, calzone, parmesan sticks and of course my precious ?? pizza. 

Your kids, friends, neighbors, everyone will love it!

Something with the flour is off. I needed an additional cup to make this recipe work. Delicious crust, though. Easy to execute and fast.

This dough is super delicious! If you do have some time to spare, knead the dough for a couple of minutes, then portion out if you need to, set on your work area, place plastic over it, and let it rest/prove. Even just 10-15min of proving makes the dough a lot easier to work with as the gluten has relaxed and delicious.

Followed to a tee with the  exception of olive oil. I didn't  have any.  Excellent and two thumbs up from our finicky food critics ages 14, 12 and 11.  Hubby and i loved it too!  Just put it in a 13x9 pan and used a bit of everybody's fave cheese. Delish! Easy to follow. Quick to make.

This recipe is supremely easy and so delicious! At another reviewers recommendation, I added Italian seasoning, and it does wonderful things to the flavor. I’ve also added fresh Parmesan and a little cornmeal to the pan.  A note: I used convection and made a cookie sheet sized pan at 420 degrees for 19 minutes. Perfection!

Sooooo easy to make. Suuuuper good if you slather some butter all over the crust and then sprinkle garlic salt all over it. Not the healthiest but I’m in it for a good time, not a long time. Lol

If you don't have time to let your dough rise, order out!  I tried this and the crust turned out like thin tasteless cardboard.  It's like the Bisquick pizza dough recipe.  Sorry, but this wasn't worth the trouble.

This is so easy and so good.   I couldn't resist kneading and letting it rise for a short time.   Maybe that's why it made a very thick (but good) crust.  For me, this will be 2 thinner pizza crusts in the future.  I will be making this again.  BTW, I  used 1 cup whole wheat bread flour and 1.5 cups whole wheat pastry flour.  I have always had bad luck with whole wheat pizza crust recipes but this was excellent even though it was not even written as a whole wheat recipe.

Mine didn't "rise" substantially like some of the others posted, but it was good. I'll make it again.

I halved the recipe and made it using brown sugar as I didn’t have white sugar. Oregano was added to the dough to give it extra flavor and I read the other reviews in which herbs we added. The dough was allowed to restfor ten minutes before rolling out in the pan. I’ll definitely repeat this recipe.

I've used this a few times for a quick pizza dough and it's turned out well every time. I really recommend adding your own spices for flavor as you're mixing the dough (or your pizza will be a tad on the bland side. I use garlic powder, oregano, a touch of cumin or tumeric, but really whatever flavors you prefer will mix in well), but as a baseline, this recipe works great!

It was quite sticky when trying to roll out, so had to keep dusting with more flour. But still simple and very good.

It was pretty easy. Made it a couple times and if you have the time I'd recommend letting it rise for at least 30 minutes, it's a small change but it makes the crust so much better and cooks faster so you don't burn your cheese.

This was a quick, and simple recipe with great results. We made this on a Friday night when our normal pizza delivery place notified us of a 45 minute wait. We figured we could make one faster than that. As it turned out, we could! 

It was on the table about 35 minutes from the time we started, and uur 3 kids (ages 3, 5, and 7) unanimously agreed that it was better than our normal pizza take-out place. I'd guess it cost about $3.00 to make rather than $20.00. This one is a winner for sure!

I made it as given and it was fine, a bit thick. I like thin pizza so the next time I only made 1/2 a batch. Delicious either way.

It's a home run recipe. Easy and excellent results.

I let the dough rise for an hour which created the thicker chewy crust. 

Egg wash for color but I didn't hear the timer and it baked a couple extra minutes as you can see by the "deeper" color of the crust and cheese.

It's half shrimp/dairy-free and half chicken. Plus garlic, onion, and banana pepper.

Very tasty dough!  I took this recipe and divided the dough into two balls. I put one in the fridge for later (just my hubby and I) and rolled the other thin (stretched to fit a 12" pan) . I cooked this at 500f and it cooked up crispy and beautiful.  My only complaint is this recipe is a little on the tough side.   I also added a tiny bit more salt to the dough mix and it tasted way better.  All in all it made a good pizza!

Great little recipe. From start to finish, I had hot pizza for my kids in 35 minutes. If you like thinner, crispier crusts this is a very good choice.

I made no changes to this great recipe. Have made it several times now. I like rolling out the dough as I get it much more even and no holes. I think I will try and only use half the dough to make it a thin crust next time. My husband raves about my home made pizza, and it is because of this crust. (Will post again when I try the thin crust theory.) Thank you for your recipe, we no longer have to order pizza.
4/23/19
Finally made the thin crust using only half the dough. Rolled only half the dough (froze the other half), topped it, baked it a few minutes less...we love it.

I have made this recipe many times.  The only variation is that I use 2-1/4 tsp of yeast from a jar rather than the packet.  Hardly a variation, but I must be honest.

This was easier than getting in the car and going to buy pre-made stuff.  We made this into three (large) calzones  and baked at 400 for 20-25min.   There were a couple reviews about the blandness of this recipe, so I added Italian seasoning and garlic powder right to the dough, it was delicious!  Will be using this recipe again, thank you!

Great alternative to making elaborately crafted “artisan” doughs. Made three kinds of pizza with it and they came out great. I’m going to try calzones next time.

When we made this I added about a teaspoon of garlic and herb seasoning, and I made it a stuffed crust using shredded mozzarella. It turned out wonderful, we baked it at 450 for 5 minutes before adding the toppings and we ran butter along the edge of the stuffed crust (I couldn't tell it was there so that is probably a waste of time) then we put it back in the oven for 12-15 minutes, took it out and let it cool for 5, and it was great. Really awesome easy recipe.

amazing. perfect and very easy! I left it to rise while I sauteed bell pepper, onion, yellow squash, spinach, garlic and tomatoes to add on top. I did let the crust bake first before I added the toppings to make sure it was cooked through. add pesto, veggies and parmesan cheese on top and broiled it for a few mins till golden brown. perfection.

This is delicious! I make it every time I am in pinch, and it tastes delicious. A great sauce is just Hunt's tomato sauce with a teaspoon of garlic powder, with some shredded mozzarella and cheddar cheese to top it off. One thing that I should mention, however, and that you have to use a spiky roller and go over your pizza in order for it not to rise to much and become a bread. You can also roll in your favorite cheese stick into the outside edge for a delicious stuffed crust!

I made this recipe as listed, and it is good in a pinch. Docked a star because it is a bit dense.

I tried it again and subbed a cup of unfed sourdough starter for 1/2 C each of flour and water, with only 1 tsp yeast (proofed with 1tsp sugar and 1/4 C water) and it poofed like Neapolitan pizza dough!!! So credit is due for a great starting point for a Napoli style dough.

My son and I made this dough for our "Pizza Dumplings"
We made 14 flat rounds of dough,  pressed each  into  an oiled muffin cup,
added sauce, pepperoni, sliced tomato, black olives & cheese, then pulled the dough over top the filling, pinched the tops closed and baked at 450*  for 15 minutes.
They turned out AMAZING!
Each one was thoroughly baked which surprised me, as we really filled them full!

This is a good basic recipe for pizza crust and you can also use it to make a loaf of French bread or focaccia bread.  It does need more salt, I used 1 1/2 tsp of salt. (and it only needs 1 tsp of yeast, too.  I didn't have a full packet and it worked out fine)  If you can afford the time, knead the dough for 5 minutes and let it rise for half an hour.  Better yet..make it at night before bed and let it rest overnight in the refrigerator in an oiled, large plastic zip lock bag,  It'll be ready to roll out and finish when you are.

Easiest pizza dough and a family favorite.  I always double this recipe for 2 larger pizzas or 4 personal size pizzas. Only changes I make is adding some garlic powder to the dough and also use cornmeal instead of flour when forming the crust.

Okay, at first, I thought this took FOREVER. I used an automatic mixer with dough hooks. This past time, I used a wooden spoon to mix it together. Start with just a cup of flour, mix it all up (until smooth), and then add the rest. It will look weird, but then take it out and knead it by hand. You will be left with a dough ball. Also, make sure you use water at 110 degrees and NOT the typical lukewarm water-on-wrist trick. Yes, use a thermometer if you must. I also added spices to it once I was needing it and then baked the crust a little. It was pretty thin, and next time I hope to let it sit longer to see how that affects it.

Easy to follow instructions and very tasty dough. Works well with any topping(I tried Mozarella, Anchovy and Salami and they were fantastic). One word of advice: If you're incompetent around the kitchen, please don't give bad reviews to good recipes.

I did not make any changes but I would have if I had known the crust would be so thick.  My family prefers thin crust.  Next time I think I will use regular flour.

This was my first attempt at making a pizza crust from scratch, and it turned out better than I imagined it would.  The recipe makes a thick crust if using a small pizza pan.  In the future, I would use a larger pan.

This is my favorite pizza dough recipe and it so happens to be the quickest one to make! It is a lovely base recipe just as is. I also like adding more salt plus garlic powder, herbs, etc. to vary the flavour a little bit. I make breadsticks or garlic knots with this recipe too. It is fantastic. Thank you for the recipe.

So far, I've made this twice, and this first time, it was a disaster.  I think it was because I didn't add the sugar to the yeast and water.  Also, the crust was way too thick, so it tasted like pizza stuff on top of bread.  It didn't work at all, and I was kind of ashamed of serving it to my kids.

The second time, though, I remembered the sugar, and also cut the flour down to just 2 cups.  It made for a smaller pizza, but it wasn't three times as thick as it should be.  Next time, I'll probably try 2.5 cups again, and see if the larger pizza.

Something else I did, and I don't know if it had any affect, is put a bowl of water in the oven with the pizza to make it crispier.  It was good, but I don't know if it had any affect.

Finally before I put in in the oven, I drizzled some garlic infused olive oil over the top.  Again, I don't know if it added anything, but it didn't hurt.

If you follow the instructions, this makes a great pizza dough.

I was very pleased with how this pizza crust turned out.  Recently I started making my own pizza at home, with the exception of a premade crust I bought at the store.  Now I can say I may everything from scratch!  This was easy and not very time consuming.  Thanks for the recipe!

We made this and it was wonderful. Thank you to the person who shared the spoon conversion of the yeast. I didn’t use a rolling pin. I just poked and pulled to get the size I wanted. It still rose quite a bit in the oven. I needed to bake it a little longer because it was a bit thick in the center but it still tasted great. I didn’t notice but my husband did. :) This will be our go-to pizza crust.

It is tasty. I added Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the olive oil as suggested in the comments.  It’s soft and a little too much like bread for my taste as pizza crust. Focaccia would be wonderful using this recipe. Some high quality olive oil, fresh herbs and a little Parmesan cheese on top and good to go!

No flavor. Too fluffy for my taste. But I was happy that it was very quick to make. No fuss. Might tweak it later.

I've made the longer, traditional pizza crusts before but this recipe nailed the softness I've been looking for.   Even with the pizza stone I have,  my old recipe would be too stiff and sometimes burnt.  But this recipe gave me a soft bottom and a nice crust.  Very happy!

Added herbs like other suggestions. I also added a tablespooon if sugar to the yeast. I’m a baker and know this helps the yeast grow more. Made a perfect crust that took about 17 minutes to bake

if you've got the time to let it rise another 15 minutes,  it seems to be better. But it's really good as written.

This is my go to recipe for pizza dough.  It is almost foolproof.  Everyone that we make pizza for loves my crust.  I like to put seasons in the crust itself. especially if I am using a red sauce.  With a red sauce I usually put Italian seasoning in the crust and with a white sauce I like to add garlic and sometimes butter into the sauce.  Flavoring the crust  just elevates the pizza to a whole new level.  If I am doing a breakfast pizza I coat the crust with a garlic, butter, and onion spread and then sprinkle it with a little bit of salt and pepper.  You can't keep the crowd away .

This is our go to pizza crust recipe. It does work well in a pinch if you don't want to wait that long. However, if you have a stand mixer and kneed it for 10 minutes and let it rise for 1+ hours it yealds a super soft dough with that crunch/strech just like take out. we've also made it, let it rise and then stick it in the refrigerator till you need it. The longer it sits (up to 2 days) the better it gets. So quick method or long you can't go wrong ??

This was the first time I tried to make homemade pizza crust. I used buckwheat flour as an alternative, gluten-free trial. I added onion powder and garlic powder to the dough to add some flavor based on reviews by others, but the dough didn't have much flavor. The texture when baked was spot-on, soft and chewy.  I'll try making it again.  I'm sure it would be better with the flour listed in the author's recipe. I like that there are only a few ingredients.

I've made this several times for family & friends with the only adjustment being adding a few seasonings (garlic, oregano & basil) to the flour before mixing it all together.  The comment I hear most is how awesome it smells.  Turns out perfect every time!

I really am not a patient person when it comes to cooking so I really like that this dough doesn't really have a rest time except for the time it takes me to shred the cheese and chop up the topping ingredients. I make a mix of 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, 1/4 tsp of oregano, pinch of salt, 1/4 tsp of basil and rosemary and added a Tbsp of oil and brushed onto crust. I've made this crusts many times and it's a keeper. Thanks for the recipe!

The title does not lie! Quick and easy. I DID let the dough hangout and rise a bit before portioning and rolling it out. We used a cast iron pizza "stone" which we heated in the oven at 500, put the crust down, let it crisp, flipped it, topped it and threw it back in the oven under the broiler. Great success and it will use this recipe again.

My kiddo loves pizza, like REALLY LOVES pizza
One night he was begging me for some, so I looked for a simple and quick recipe and found this one.  I made it and it turned as good as my regular crust (the one which takes over na hour to make). 
I didn't try to make it "non bland" as I was making it for my picky eaters. The biggest compliment, they ate it :)

I love this recipe!  I had originally started making the pizza dough on ths back of the Kroger flour bag.  After letting it rise and taking the cloth off to an already fallen dough I was in a pinch.  I googled this recipe and found that it only took 5 minutes to rest so I gave it a shot.  It was perfect!  Everyone loved it.  This will definitely be my new go to for homemade pizza!

I put the water, yeast, and sugar in my stand mixer and let that sit for about 5 minutes and then added the flour and salt.  Using the dough hook, I mixed on a low setting for an additional 5-6 minutes until it all came together.  Depending on the flour, humidity, and other little variations you may need to add a teaspoon or so of water.  A little water goes a long way.

yes, again! I have always used the recipes that call for a rising time but this was equally good and shorter. Topped the pizza with the EXQUISITE PIZZA SAUCE from this site and mozzarella cheese. No other toppings at my guests' request but it was yummy even without. Thanks for the recipes!   Judi David

I've made several pizza dough recipes and this one by FAR is the best!! I will always use this recipe from now on.  Perfect yeast flavor, easy to make, fast; no need to let the dough rise for hours so it was perfect for the last minute dinner. I used regular flour and vegetable oil, which turned out just right.

We just made our first ever homemade pizza and it tasted great!   The only thing that needed improvement was our dough spreading skills but our squareish/roundish pizza was yummy.

This recipe is the best that I ever made. I made it the way the recipe said but I did what one of your readers did;  which was  to put the pressed doe into the oven, turn the up to 500 degrees & cook for 5 minutes. Take out the doe, reduce oven to 450, prepare the top of the pizza & continue with the original recipe. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Thanks AllRecipes!!

This was really good. I added just a little sugar into the recipe. The baking time and temperature were perfect. Thanks for the recipe. I will be using this one!

It's not bad for as quick as it is but not my style. It's too breast and kind of tough. I'll keep the recipe for when my family wants pizza.

This pizza crust is okay. This was my first recipe I ever used and it was very bready. If you love pan pizza or just a thick soft crust then this is for you. If you like a crisp thinner crust then this isn't for you. I added herbs into this dough to give it a bit of flavor and brushed a butter herb mix on the edges. It's decent but it also uses bread flour which is more pricier than all purpose.

Made in my stand mixer.  Excellent!  Only thing i changed was adding some dried basil, garlic powder and red pepper flakes prior to mixing.  I did let it rise a little longer ( approx. 20 minutes) .  Dough was not sticky.  Easy to use.   Dusted counter with a little flour and used a rolling pin to shape into a thin crust.  Awesome and super tasty!   Love this recipe, have used it many times.  I use KIng Arthurs unbleached Bread flour.  I always pre-bake crust 7 minutes and then add sauce, toppings and continue bake for another 10 minutes.  Also, i drizzle olive oil on my pizza pans and spray them with cooking spray to insure a crispy, done crust.  Dont forget to use the cooking spray on the outer crust and season it with parm or garlic powder!!! Yum!

My family raved over this pizza crust!  I got the dough ball completely ready and wrapped it in plastic wrap and threw it in the fridge until that evening when I was ready for it.  Rolled out nicely and was probably one of the best homemade doughs I've made!  Thanks!!

It's not bad for a quick rise crust. It's a bit heavier and more dry than a traditional crust, but still better than frozen pizza and really easy and fast to put together. I think next time I'll season the dough and pile high with unique toppings and call it a flatbread pizza.

Easy & tasty. Today I'm experimenting to see if it will make 2 thin crust, using the size pans we have.  I just need to remember to have the toppings ready before starting the crust so it really only takes 30 minutes.

Loved this crust!  Very easy and quick.  Had a nice soft crust when baked on a baking sheet which is exactly the way I like mine.  Hubby likes it crispier so baked his in a pizza crisper pan and he was happy too.  And made one into a rectangle, cut into breadsticks, baked then topped with butter and parmesan.  Kids were excited to have their own crazy bread!  Made it exactly as written.  Perfect!  Thank you!

I made a change in the cooking directions from a recipe I found in a magazine that sounded interesting and it turned out great. I thought I’d share it here in case anyone would like to try it with this wonderful dough recipe. I used this dough recipe.                                                   Preheat oven to 500F. Prepare a cookie sheet by lightly dusting with flour. I rolled out the dough on a lightly floured board then transferred to a oiled sheet of foil. Topped the dough with sauce, toppings etc. Placed the foil and pizza on the bottom, yes the bottom of the oven, NOT the bottom rack, the actual bottom. Cook for about 2 minutes until the bottom is crisp. Transfer the foil to the prepared cookie sheet (floured cookie sheet) and bake in middle of oven for 8-10 minutes more until crust is golden and cheese is bubbly. Let cool and slice.         Hope you enjoy.

Super easy recipe! I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil and 1 additional cup of flour to knead the dough... since I had used 1/2 cup more of water (by mistake) but came out perfect.

We've made this crust about five times now, and it never fails! I've realised I have to roll it quite thin as it's a thicker crust, but super yummy.

This is a great crust recipe. 

After rolling out, I baked the crust on a pIzza stone at 425 degrees for 10 minutes. 

Pulled it out of the oven, flipped it, then spread the sauce, added cheese, and topped with veggies. 

Then baked for 5 minutes at 550 degrees, and it turned out delicious. Will definitely make again!

This was so easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly, with the only exception of adding Italian seasoning to the mix. I used a pizza stone, so reduced temp to 425 and cooked for 25 mins. It came out amazing! It's chewy and crispy exactly where it needs to be and it holds its shape! Made this for my husband and his friend and it was a big hit!

Great quick recipe... it's very fluffy when it cooks so recommend cutting it in half and making 2 big pizzas.....  I even rolled it very thin but it was still super thick and bready

Incredibly easy to make and very easy to experiment. I subbed a quarter of the water for beer and it came out wonderful!

I love how simple and fast it is to make this recipe. The crust is soft and chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside. I did add some garlic powder to the flour before mixing it into a dough but that didn't  hurt the texture one bit.

I needed a quick, easy crust to use up a batch of spinach and artichoke dip I had in the fridge.  We like thin crispy crust.  This fit the bill nicely!  I used half the dough and put the other half in the freezer.  It's a keeper!

I add a couple of tablespoons of sugar to the water as the yeast proofs, it makes the crust brown nicely.  I add 1/4 cup of olive oil to the baking pan to help crisp up the crust....works very think or thinker well.  this crust recipie will make a full jelly roll pan and a good sized calzone if rolled out well.  Makes good garlic cheese sticks if you add garlic butter and cheese.  For really easy cleanup, parchmenct paper in the pan and remove it to a rack right out of the oven helps to keep it crisp...

I use this recipe all the time, I suggest that when you mix your warm water and yeast you let is sit for about five minutes with the sugar this gives it a head start and wakes it up.  Also the best flour for Pizza is "00" which has a finer milling and results in a much better crust IMO. Also I'd appreciate it if all recipies would add the conversion for yeast 2-1/4 tsp= .25 oz right at the top, as I scratch my head every time on this one.

This is one of my favorite recipes for pizza crust! So easy to do when I'm tired from work and don't wanna wait for crust to rise! Make sure to add salt and any other herbs you like to the dough for taste!! Keeps well for a few days in the fridge too, but will rise and try to bust out of the container you put it in.

Such a quick and easy pizza dough that's absolutely delicious! It literally takes 10 minutes from start to finish. I let my dough rise about 20 minutes but only because I was busy prepping my toppings. It is chewy on the outside but soft on the inside. If your family loves homemade pizza then this recipe is a must save. Better than any takeout pizza!

Wow...this recipe saved my life! So, last minute my teenager asks me if a friend can stay over for dinner. Yeah...the day that I had planned for leftovers! Needless to say, this is a really good recipe and it solved my problem without enslaving in the kitchen last minute. Thank you!

I followed the recipe exactly as written but the only thing I did differently was to pre-baked the dough for 7 minutes before adding toppings. After adding toppings I baked for 15 minutes at 450 and the bottom was crunchy and toppings perfectly baked.

I didn't make any other changes besides using vegetable oil. turned out great. I had significant difficulty getting the dough to shape due to the wetness of it, but eventually got it to work. very elastic.

I will definitely be making this again. Although it can be considered a little on the bland side, it's perfect if you have a really bold sauce or a lot of toppings. Next time I'm going to try brushing the edges in butter.

The only change was to add herbs (oregano, basil, garlic salt ) and let it rise 30 mins.
I proofed the yeast in my KA mixing bowl and then added all the dry ingredients and mixed the dough and let it rise in the bowl.
Perfect!

Not near as good as  rising dough. I used to use frozen bread and would use the bread as dough, it's way better that way and I will stick to that. Also, this was way too much dough for one pizza not enough for two.

Absolutely perfect! I've tried half a dozen pizza-crust recipes before this one, and every one of them was either too hard, lumpy, thick, or just plain and tasteless. Made this yesterday and felt like I was in a pizzeria. Definitely will use this whenever I make pizza.

I'm sure there are technically better pizza crust recipes out there but I'm giving this 5 stars because it's exactly what it says it is and still tastes great.  I still consider myself a novice in the kitchen and this was my introduction to making pizza.  It really was quick and easy and I've made it many times since.  It's also something I can actually make after work and not just on weekends because of time.

Made it the day before and refrigerated it, baked it for closer to 25 minutes, holds up well to being refrigerated afterwards, still firm without being tough.

Turned out great!  First time my homemade crust could be picked up to eat.
Turned out a little dry when I mixed in the four but I added more water til it was like dough.  We like thin crust so I rolled it out really thin and it was perfect!
Thanks for the recipe!

Easy peasy! Used all purpose flour instead of bread flour and mixed with a spatula! No special tools required. Wondering if this would be okay to freeze and thaw when needed.

quick, easy and tender.   gave it  several extra turns using my kitchen aid dough hook and let it rest.  it was still sticky so I spread it out with my olive oil covered hands and then topped it with the still hot 3 ingredient tomato sauce then cheese then meatballs and onions.  it was so good.  not tough at all.   in fact my son got into the fridge later for the leftovers and only ate the crust!

I can't count how many times I've made this. It's a huge hit with everybody, and the best part is you can add almost anything for flavors and the recipe isn't exact! Add more oil for a thinner, crisper crust, more flour for thicker and chewier, it's incredibly versatile.

Amazing crust recipe ever!!! I was making tons of pizza late one night and ran out of dough but had lots of toppings left still to go. This quick recipe did not take too long to make and saved me from having to wait until the dough has doubled in size to use. I would definitely keep using this recipe next time I feel like cranking up my own pizzeria at home!

Very quick and easy... I like the no raising. The crust was soft and chewy. I made it exactly as written and used general purpose flour and baked it on a pizza stone. Thanks... I loved the ease and was good but I am still searching as my husband is looking for something a bit different but he ate it all!

This is the same as Betty C rocker's  Recipe that was published 20 years ago. It is a good basic recipe. It is better if permitted a couple of hours to rise, then cooked on either a stone or a pizza steel which works as well as a stone but does not break when dropped.

Well named. Worked well for last minute crust. Because of the five minute 'rest time', the texture was a little grainy, more so when eating the bit of leftovers.  Also, the flavor can't have fully developed fully without giving the yeast time to produce what only time with yeast can accomplish. That said, I am keeping this recipe.  Will use it in a pinch and be glad to do so.

Instead of mixing the dough with a wooden spoon, I mixed it with a fork to get everything more evenly spread through out the dough.

Absolutely love this recipe! Didnt use enough yeast, (i used jarred instead of packets) but it turned out well. Also split the dough in half and made some cinnamon buns out of it as an experiment and they turned out amazingly. 

Will make again. I just need to get a rolling pin before i do.

I doubled the recipe to make in my large stoneware pizza pan. I had enough dough to make the pizza stuff crust with cheese and pepperoni. This was the first time I've ever made my own pizza dough and it came out super good. I sprinkled  some Johnny garlic spread seasoning on the edges of the crust. It came out delicious and was way easier to make than I thought it would be. Will definitely be making this again.

My go-to crust recipe is a little more involved and takes significantly longer to slow-rise.  I was looking for a more simple dough that would still be good for a "make your own pizza" station at my daughter's slumber party.  This definitely worked beautifully!  It also doesn't have to be used immediately, I allowed some of the dough to rise for about an hour and it was great too.  Silky smooth and easy to work with.

No changes necessary. Simple, quick and relish. I use a round pizza pan, no more than three ingredients and a little sauce or oil and its perfect.

This is my quick go to pizza dough, it is tasty.  For thinner crust I cut the dough in two (froze the other half) and it worked out great.

I will definitely make this again!  It's quick, easy and foolproof!  Doesn't have tons of flavor as is, so I will take a cue from others probably try butter instead of oil next time!  I brushed some oil on a 9x13 glass dish and sprinkled some corn meal on there. Pressed the dough into the bottom with slightly raised edges. Baked for 10 mins., removed from the oven and added toppings...then baked on the bottom rack for another 20 minutes or so. Yum!

This pizza crust was super easy and quick to make. It was soft and delicious, the best quick recipe I have used. It is especially better than frozen crusts. The only way you can get better flavor is to let the dough rest longer.

Excellent recipe for a quick dough.  I really like this recipe and will continue to use it.  I did add some spices to the dough but that was just a personal preference because I like a smokey flavor in my crust. I added just a pinch of onion powder,  chipotle seasoning,  pizza seasoning,  garlic and Italian seasoning to my dough.  Results were yummy! Thank you for this recipe!

This turned out pretty good, though I think next time I'll try a different recipe that calls for letting the dough rise.  I also think there's too much flour in this recipe; I had to add a little bit of water to roll it out at all, and the final product was really dense.  I think 2 1/4 cups flour would have been better.

My 14 year old use this pizza crust recipe to make her first pizza. It was easy and delicious, the recipe actually made enough for 2 large pizzas.
Very light, cooked for 15 minutes came out perfect.
Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Very easy to make... I used 1 1/2cups bread flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour. I had to use about a teaspoon of water to get the dough to the right consistancy. Rolled it out to about a 14 inch pizza topped and baked. I used a lightly grease (crisco) nonstick pizza pan. It came out nice and Crispy, with chewy edges.

This is my second time making this recipe and we love it!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and my family loved the flavor, but the crust was a little thicker than we like.  (When I tried to roll it out, it was really spongy and difficult to thin out.)

This time, I split it into two balls to make two pizzas.  The first one was just the right thickness, but still a little difficult to roll out because of the sponginess.  With the thinner crust, 15 minutes was too long to bake.  The cheese burned on top (but the pizza was still delicious).  

For the second one, my son tried tossing the dough into the air, and it landed in my sink full of soapy water!  :-)  While the first pizza was cooking, I mixed up another batch of dough (because it really is "quick and easy").  We divided the dough into two balls and baked the second pizza for 10 minutes.  The toppings were perfect, but the crust was a little under cooked.

We rolled out the dough for the third pizza, but since we weren’t going to eat it tonight, we left it sitting on the dough board while we ate (about 30 minutes).  It was so much easier to work with after it sat out for a little while.   The sponginess was completely gone and it was a breeze to roll out to the size of my pizza pan.

This is definitely quick and easy and delicious!

Quick and easy! Used this to make dough for pepperoni rolls. The first time I used it, it was a really bland. So before I put the rolls in the oven I brush some melted butter with garlic and Italian seasoning on top.

As easy and delicious as they say it is! One tip, if you cook it in an iron frying pan (great cooked in a smoker), use care and don't use all the dough unless you have a huge pan or the crust may be thicker that you would have liked. Every time I make this pizza everyone complements how good it is and vows they'll never buy a pre-made or an order/delivered pizza again! Thanks

This is my go-to pizza crust recipe.  It comes together quickly and can be rolled out to a thin crust.  I usually make it cookie sheet size.  Quite tasty, as well!    I have used this recipe when making grilled pizza  and pizza in the oven,  as per the recipe.

I made this recipe last night for a friend and she absolutely loved it, insisting I show her how to make it. Super easy to double the recipe, and as another gal said it freezes well! I let my yeast and water sit until it was super foamy and let it rise all afternoon and I found that it made the crust that much more amazing than the first time I made it .With this recipe on hand I do not think I will ever go back to frozen store bought pizza, or any other pizza other than my own!

The recipe was easy to follow and I would make it again. I had a hard time getting the crust to brown but that could have been because I used an Airbake pan and the dough wasn't very level (first time making dough). 

I added 1 tsp of Italian seasoning, 1 tsp garlic powder, & 3/4 tsp basil to the olive oil before mixing it in the dough. I also brushed some olive oil on the crust before putting on my toppings.

It's a great crust for homemade. I don't make pizza dough normally, so this seems to work for me. I add seasoning (onion powder, basil, oregano, and dry ranch mix).  I use a pizza stone, I stretch it out and then lay it out on the pizza board on top of corn meal so it will easily slide off onto the pizza stone. It doesn't rise a lot, but the family still likes it.

The dough was easy to make, good flavor but a little soggy, perhaps I should have rolled/patted the dough thinner.  Overall very good. No complaints from my family, which is always a plus in my book.

I hadn't made pizza crust from scratch in a long time and this was the recipe I chose to try last night.  It turned out really outstanding and my husband is still raving about it.  Easy to make and I did have a little time so I covered it and let the dough rise for about 20 mins.  Turned out great!

This crust is absolutely amazing! It's super easy and takes minimal effort very kid friendly! And very fun to do! I didn't beat it but used my hands instead because it kneaded better that way?? this crust became a fast favorite in our house!

I needed something quick and easy and this fit the bill.  Not bad in a pinch, I think it would be great if I had the time to let it rise once first next time.  I will definitely experiment with this and try it out again.  I baked it on a preheated stone and the crust was nice and crisp - I also used GF flour and it came out quite well.

Yum. Make exactly as described but serve as appetizer breadsticks and a pie. Divide dough roughly in half. Dump the small half onto a floured surface as the rest rests in the bowl. Roll into a circle.  Brush on melted butter, sprinkle with garlic salt, basil and oregano. Grate on a healthy layer of Parmesan Romano and bake roughly 12 minutes. While that bakes, prepare the remaining dough as pie with desired toppings. Bake roughly 11 minutes or until crust is brown and cheese is bubbly.

Next time try pre-baking the pizza only about 5 minutes before topping and baking the remaining time.

So easy and it turned out great IF you follow everyone's suggestions - let it rest for 30 min and add in Italian seasoning. Where I live, there isn't Italian seasoning readily available so I used basil, oregano, and thyme and it turned out just fine. Will definitely use again!

After reading through the comments, I followed a suggestion to roll the dough onto a pan, turn the oven to 500, put the dough in for 4 minutes (original comment said 5, but that made it too crisp), then turn the oven back down to 450. Then I poke the dough all over with a fork to let the air pockets out, top with marinara sauce, parsley, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, basil (just to give it some extra flavor since the dough is a little bland), Parmesan cheese, mozzarella, pepperoni, and Italian sausage. It only takes 13 minutes to cook after that, and that makes it a little well done. My husband LOVES this recipe. We make it almost twice a week.

I made 2 batches of this, one thin and one deep dish in my cast iron skillet.  Grandkids loved it.  My favorite was the deep dish.  It is so easy to make that I will stop buying the  convenient frozen pizzas.

Easy go to recipe when you want pizza but do not have a lot of time for dough to rise, etc.  Next time I may precook the dough for a few minutes before adding toppings.

Wow!!!!! This pizza dough was sooooo easy and soooooo delicious!!!!!! It's soft, chewy and airy! I ended making extra dough because everyone wanted more!! Kid approved!!!! I spread a little olive oil, basil, oregano, and garlic mixture over the dough before adding marinara and toppings. After the pizza was done I spread the crust with a touch of garlic butter. No more delivery or digorno!

Considering how quick it is to make this, it's fantastic. Instead of all the waiting for the dough to rise, this is so much easier. Now I can make a pizza from scratch in under an hour without too much difference in the crust. Sure, allowing the dough to rise makes a better crust, but with so much more time and effort. This is my new go-to for pizza dough.

This is good, but it does need rising time for the best taste. I made it twice and gave it 90 minutes each time, rolled it out and let it sit for another 30 while I got my toppings ready. That worked out nicely. I will say this though, the first time I used "00" pizza flour. It came out great, like a hand-tossed, but not thin crust. The second time I used actual "bread flour" and it was more like bread. I did it on a stone both time, so the bread dough one had more of a crisp artisan crust, bread-like interior, etc. I can't say I am as much of a fan of the "bread" version.  Things to keep in mind.

This truly is a fantastic and EASY recipe. It is just fine the way it is. But two thing, make sure you do let the dough rest or your crust will be hard and chewy. And two, I know the advantage of this recipe is no rise needed, however if you DO let the dough rise, your crust is amazingly fluffy and delicious.

I make pizza a lot and I keep coming back to this one and get consistently good results. I use 2 1/2 - 3 T of SAF yeast instead of the packets since I have it on hand for bread baking, but other than that I follow the recipe with Bread Flour and my pizza stone. I like the fast bake time and chewy crust. Thank you.

I mixed this in a stand mixer with the S shaped hook-  allowed the dough to rise for about an hour. Spread it out and when it got a little tight I let the gluten relax for a few minutes and was able to shape the dough more or less into a rough circle. It's a nice quick dough.

I used regular unbleached flour instead of bread flour.  Delicious, quick and easy.  Have used this recipe multiple times and will continue to do so.

I found this recipe this afternoon and decided to give it a try for dinner.  Oh my it was super easy to make, I followed the instructions to the letter,,it was perfect. We topped it with sausage, pineapple, cheese and a white sauce. Bake it at 450 for twenty mins. My only change I will make the next time would be to decrease the time to twelve or fifteen minute.

This is good recipe for a quick dinner however I think it needs a little more flour, maybe half a cup.  I also put garlic salt, sea salt and pepper on the dough then put olive oil on it, before the tomato sauce . I rolled  the crust or so it's around a 1/4 of an inch thick and baked it for 15 min. This added some much need flavor to the crust

This is our new go-to pizza crust recipe. It's really straightforward and easy. I have yet to try it with gluten free flour, but I don't anticipate that being a problem.

11-26-16: I made it with gluten free flour, cup for cup, and it's awesome!!!

This is a really easy recipe. My kids and I love it. We use it all the time. My twins are graduating this year and plan on taking it to college with them. I use a stone pizza pan and it crusts up beautifully. We don't like a thick crust so this works perfectly. We have added herbs to the mix and that really changes the flavor of our pizza. I have give this out to friends to try and they love it as much as we do!

Love this recipe! I do add garlic, Italian seasoning and a little pepper. It comes out amazing. I also let the dough sit for ten in the bowl and after I spread it out on the pizza pan for a another 5 to 10 minutes.

I love this recipe and have made so many times! I've used olive oil, butter, added garlic and Italian herbs. Made it as written. It's always great for pizza or calzones. Make as many pizzas, as many sizes as you want. I usually add a little extra yeast ... closer to 3 teaspoons (mine's a big Costco bag I keep in the freezer). Then I partake them, maybe 10 mins, then top and finish baking. So yummy!!

Good thick, bready crusts!  I added lots of spices, garlic, and parmesan to the dough and kneaded for like 5 minutes. I let it rise for like 10 minutes. Super easy, super quick, pretty delicious. I'm contemplating using this as a basic bread dough recipe too.

It was a good crust, a little thicker than my regular recipe, but good it you like a pan pizza type. The addition of a teaspoon of Italian seasoning added a nice flavor through out the pizza.

Was surprised how easy this came together. Interesting is that it didn't rise as much as I thought it would given there's a whole package of yeast in it. I ended up over cooking mine, but had nothing to do with the recipe and just the fact that I got distracted and left it into long. Will definitely use this recipe again.

No changes made to ingredients. let it rise for half an hour. It's a great quick pizza base. I make 2 pizzas out of it because I dont like a thick base. Thank you to Chef Rider for posting it.

Very good, especially when prepared with bread flour.  You really do need a pizza stone if you want the crispier thin crust; otherwise it always seemed a little too doughy for me

What an easy perfect pizza dough recipe! The ONLY addition I made was  a tsp or so of Italian herbs to the olive oil before I poured the oil into the flour mixture.  I did knead the dough by hand for probably 10 minutes  -until the dough developed a smoothness and cohesiveness.  I used the recipe this time to make  pizzas  in two muffin tins.  Absolutely delicious!  The filling was hamburger, Italian sausage, and grated pepperoni; and the pizza sauce I made from canned Italian crushed tomatoes, green bell peppers, onions, garlic. I filled each cup and then dotted the tops with pieces of mozzarella cheese; and then into 425 degree oven for 10 minutes   Pizza crust was AWESOME as was the mini pizzas.  Can't wait to make a full size pizza with this dough recipe.

It was very tasty.  I doubled the batch and added a tablespoon of  seasonindry Italiangs and a teaspoon of garlic powder.  This would be tasty for a white sauce veggie pizza, but it over powered our pepperoni and ground beef with onion pizza.  The recipe is great as is.  I recommend this recipe for anyone who is just learning to cook.  One tip on yeast though, be very careful about the temperature of the water.  If it's too warm, it kills the yeast and it won't rise.  Have fun, and experiment.

Four tries>four successes.  Even with 1/4 whole wheat.  Airy crust.  Hint:  after forming the round to the size I wanted, I brush or blow off the flour on top so that I can smear on tomato paste and have it stick.  Eat well!

Quite good, I did use one cup of whole wheat flour, it was crispy, and evenly baked, with just a slight extra firm and browner edge than I usually like. Will probably use it from now on.

My only issue with this is that I wasn't able to get it rolled thin enough. I added the onion powder, basil and oregano to the oil when I mixed the dough which made it tasty but I like a crisper crust. It might just take practice, but it was quick and easy to make.

Simple and no-fuss, but I did let the dough rise a second time (proof rising) until the dough was doubled in size.  

Taste like a typical pizza dough, nothing special, but you can add seasonings to taste.

I doubled the ingredients except the yeast ( used 1 Tbs yeast.)  I weighed the flour, 22.5 oz. A double batch made 6 personal pizzas (about 8-10 inches in diameter). I rolled the dough thin and baked for 10-12 minutes at 450F. Turned out great, will make again. 
5/30/2017 Made this again. Increase bake time to 12-15 minutes. I also let the dough rise for 30 minutes. I think it was better.

I doubled this recipe and it made 2 pizzas and some breadsticks, enough to feed five hungry people.  The only thing I added to the recipe was 2 tsp. Italian seasoning and I used garlic infused olive oil. I used my kitchen aide with the dough hook to mix the dough until all the flour was incorporated and I did let it rest for about 15 minutes. It was the easiest pizza dough recipe and it was amazing. This will become the pizza dough recipe we use from now on.

Quick and easy!  Just as the name suggests, I was able to make this crust up fairly quick.  I used all-purpose flour.  I also, as suggested, added seasonings/herbs (oregano, garlic and onion powder).  I topped with a Mexican blend cheese (only cheese on hand) and pepperoni. The pizza kid only ate one slice (maybe due to the cheese).  I, on the other hand, ate three slices.  I thought it was pretty good. However, I did note it was more bread-like than crust-like.  Even with the additions, the crust still lacked the traditional pizzeria flavor.  I do plan to make this again, possibly dividing the dough for 2 pizzas, increasing the resting time and adding butter.  Oh, and using mozzarella next time! ??

This is the only pizza dough recipe I use (mostly because I don't plan ahead enough). I have never been disappointed by this recipe and it is a family favorite. I am not sure what the reviewer who called this recipe bland expects from pizza dough. I've never made a pizza dough that was extremely flavorful--the flavor comes from the sauce and the toppings. I pretty much never have bread flour so I used regular all purpose flour with great results.

this is a wonderful dough , my pizza was ready in under an hour. i let the dough rest for 15 minutes, added a little garlic powder to the flour. the dough was proofed a little and it baked nicely. great for satisfying late night pizza cravings!

This was super fast and easy considering I haven't dealt with yeast dough in a long time. For next the next round, as someone suggested, I would pre-bake the crust for 5 minutes before adding toppings. While the middle of mine wasn't raw it would have been better a little crispier. I now feel inspired to make my own pizza dough more often- it's not hard at all!

It's so easy! I have a family of 6 and have been procrastinating making homemade crust because time is crucial. I am interrupted every 5 minutes because someone needs me. I love you don't have to wait for it to rise. It's quick and easy and I can make it without thinking too far ahead. I'm not a great planner so this is perfect for me. I've made it 3 times now, and it's never failed. It is easy to spice up the crust for those of you that need more taste (my husband) but it's perfect for the kids and I who like to keep things simple. Keep it towards the bottom of the oven because the cheese will burn if you bake it in the middle or top. But truly this is the best thing ever for my family!! Thanks for posting this!!

Didn't have bread flour, so I used 2 cups white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour on my banking stone.  Added some homegrown ingredients and even my husband said that I had to make it again! Now that's a great review! And so easy!

I love this crust recipe! It's very simple, and didn't take very long  at all to make. I will definitely be using it again (I've already made it twice, great results both times). The only change I made was I put it in the oven for about four minutes before putting sauce and toppings on, in order for it to rise a little.

This is super easy and came out very good however it was a little more bread like than pizza crusty. Will definitely make it again but may make some changes to get the consistency more like pizza crust

We made our pizzas on the grill. This dough worked great. I did let it rise for about 20 min. Really light, crispy, good flavor.

I really like this recipe. It's fast and easy and the texture is wonderful. The first few times I made it, I followed the recipe as is and it is a bit bland but the toppings helped. I've started adding garlic powder, parmesan cheese and seasonings. It really helps. Dunno if it's the best or not but its quick, easy and easily modified.

While I don't usually like to rate recipes if I've made significant changes to them, I hope my comments may be useful to others. I added 2 tsp of Italian seasoning and 1 tsp of garlic powder to the dough. I ended up needing a bit more flour than called for. I let my dough sit for a half hour before rolling it out on a mixture of flour and corn meal. I spread out some light Alfredo sauce on the crust and baked it for five minutes, then added shredded cheese and shrimp. The crust never got quite as "crusty" as I would hope, and I believe this might be because I made it too thick. I used a 13" perforated pizza pan, and even with over 30 minutes in the oven, the crust didn't seem quite done. We ate it anyway and thought it was delicious, though, so it didn't matter ultimately.

I have been looking for the perfect and quick pizza dough and this was pretty perfect.  I cooked it on a dark metal pizza pan and baked the crust at 450 degrees by itself before any sauce or toppings and it turned out great. I would like to see if I could make the crust not be too bland but I am overall very pleased.

This is my go to pizza dough. I don't add anything  so as not to overpower the flavors in my sauce.  The crust perfect, not too chewy and not too crispy.

I love making this pizza crust because it is so simple and turns out every time.  This crust is a little too much for a 13 to 15 inch pizza so I make about 3/4 of the recipe and it works great for us.

A very good base for pizza dough, and it was super easy.  I look forward to trying different variations with herbs and spices added to the dough.  It made a very light and healthy tasting crust.  I made it on a baking sheet sprayed with olive oil.  Everyone liked it a lot and I plan on keeping more active yeast on hand to make this often!

It was very good.  I doubled it and it turned out great.  One I made with a thicker crust and my husband liked that one better but I liked the thinner one better.  Great recipe though and easy.  It was my first time making pizza dough from scratch.

I love this recipe, it's really easy. 
Changes: after you spread it on your pizza stone, bake for 10 minutes, then pull it out and top it and bake the rest of the way, otherwise you end up with doughy/soggy pizza dough in the middle of your pizza.

I have made this several times. I use it for pizza and pizza rolls. It is very easy to make and tastes amazing. I do not personally like pizza but I will eat this. My kids can't get enough of it. I have three teenagers and their friends never leave leftovers for the next day. I even make extra and put it in the freezer. The last pizza roll I made I put Italian seasoning in the dough and it was amazing! The crust is very crispy and light. I love this recipe!

I thought this turned out pretty good considering how easy it was to make. I think it could use more salt as it was bland. I did add Italian herbs to the oil and also brushed the edges in oil and sprinkled with herbs.

This was an easy and quick recipe.  I like that we could eat in less than an hour! 
I didn't have bread flour or enough white flour, so I used 1 1/2 c. white flour and 1 c. wheat flour plus 3 t. baking power and a little extra salt.  I also just used wheat flour for dusting and rolling out the dough. 
It turned out great!

I actually used regular flour AND was out of oil so I used melted margarine, and it still turned out perfect. The dough was a little dry so I added extra margarine. I put some garlic and Italian seasoning on the crust after rolling it out. Took about 35-40 minutes rather than 20, but not complaining. Turned out crispy and cooked evenly in the middle.

This is my go-to for pizza dough!  I also add some epicure dip spice mixes (sundried tomato or 3 onion) to the flour mixture before adding the water to make the dough extra special!  I love making this when we babysit my husband's younger cousins, they can each decorate their own pizza!  So much fun!

Amazing Recipe. I make it just about every Sunday. Instead of making a whole pizza, I make a few individual turn over pizzas so my husband can have a snack at work. They freeze great and reheat in the microwave (with a small bowl of water to prevent the dough from getting tough). Amazing Flavor. I use 2 C bread or white flour and 1/2 C brown flour and a teaspoon of chia seeds just  to sneak them into his diet.

First time making my own pizza crust.  It was so simple to make.  I followed the directions as directed.  Used a rolling pin to spread dough.  Had a little difficulty shaping into an exact circle, but I expect the shaping technique will improve with more practice.  I recommend this pizza dough recipe for any beginner making their own crust from scratch.

Absolutely Love it!!! I like to add some oregano to the dough before baking, and brush with olive oil before adding sauce and cheese. I will use this crust again and again! I made four crusts the first time I used it, it was so quick and easy! Thank you SO MUCH!

Awesome crust! I added a little bit of parmesan and a few spices and it was really tasty. Works really great when you don't have time to wait for dough to rise. Definitely recommend using bread flour as the recipe suggests. Will be making again!

Good for a quick crust. A little bland and not as chewy as I would have liked. However, I was able to get the crust cooked nicely - even in the middle and the dough was easy to pat out.  I would make it again if I wanted a quick crust from scratch.

Wow! I listen to some of the advice of the reviewers...not because the recipe it wrong...because it is A+++ recipe. I just prefer more of a garlicky crust. My house smells amazing. The dough was so easy to work with.

This came out great, even better than many of the no-knead dough recipes I've tried.  It works just fine with AP flour if that's all you have on hand. As some other commenters suggested, I gave it a 30 min rise in a covered bowl before baking it, which I would recommend as well. In fact, I'd probably give it a second rise too after stretching it out into the pan.

This was good, but pretty thick.  I put it on a preheated pizza stone and it got a little too crispy for our liking on the bottom.

Super easy and simple! 
This basic recipe seems really versatile. I topped it with basil-olive oil, cheese, green onion, sliced tomatoes, and bacon. It was delicious!
I baked just the crust for about 5 minutes before adding the toppings. It was so fluffy and soft, which is the kind of crust I like!!

Simply marvelous! I made this and it blows away the pizza I've had in Virginia. I moved from New York so I'm a pizza snob but this is amazing! Add parsely, oregano and onion powder to the dough when you are adding the flour because it adds some flavor. I also recommend folding the dough around the edge and pinching it to make a thicker crust. I used the back of a spoon to spread some olive oil around the crust and put garlic salt on the crust. absolutely  amazing.

I've made this dough a few times, I like to let it rise for 30 mins before rolling it out into two pizza pans. Last night my husband cooked them in the Bar Bar Q. (Medium Flame) Best pizza ever!  Note: They were done in 12 minuets.  So keep an eye  on them, as this cooking time was 8 mins faster than my oven!

Okay, so maybe it's not "THE BEST PIZZA DOUGH RECIPE IN THE WORLD!!" but it's definitely the best I-Need-Pizza-Dough-RIGHT-NOW recipe you'll find! It's also an amazing time-saver and my husband and I only use this recipe. It's great for when the pizza craving hits you in the face at an ungodly hour and you don't want to wait 45 minutes for one to be delivered to you. It's also great for when you have friends over but you don't want to cook anything that takes more than 20 minutes, but want to take the credit for it ;).

made as posted. I followed the recipe instructions perfectly. As posted in Chef Riders comments I used regular all purpose flour. The only difference, I added 1/4tsp. garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning for my taste. The recipe worked perfectly, and the end result was a pizza crust that could be made quick and taste good too. The texture was soft and airy on the inside with a slightly crispy outer crust. I did cooked it on a ceramic pizza stone at 500degrees.

Love making this as oppose to buying Dominos. I always use garlic powder, basil and Italian seasoning in the dough (as was suggested by another user). I don't use measurements just add it to taste. It makes a world of a difference.

Very good crust for the amount of time and effort involved.  You can find better crust recipes out there, but they probably won't be this quick.  I'm not good at planning ahead enough to account for long rise times, so this recipe is a good one for me.

*edit* I've made this a half-dozen times now, and it gets better and better as I get better at tossing and stretching the crust out.

I made the following changes and had PERFECT personal pizzas for 4.

To crust:
Add 1 tsp each onion and garlic powder before kneading. Let rise 30 minutes before rolling out dough; divide into 4 balls and roll each really thin (love a cracker-like crust). Brush tops of each crust with olive oil. Pre-bake crusts on lowest ove for 5 minutes @ 500°.

To prepare pizza:
Turn oven down to 450° .  Place each pizza onto the top of a turned over baking/cookie sheet or pizza stone. Add sauce and ingredients. Bake about 7minutes, and slide pizza off pan, directly onto rack (this gives you the cracker crust) for another 5-7 minutes.

Best tasting quick pizza crust; and I've made many.  I opted to replace 1 1/2 cups of flour with whole grain flour. Worked perfect.

Super easy and quick.  I kneaded it after mixing it together just to get the ingredients more fully incorporated.  The crust was on the thicker side and reminded me a bit of focaccia with respect to texture.  Would make again.  Rolled out very easily.

This is my go to for pizza crust. I've used it for everything pizza related including calzones, breadsticks and  I can even tweak the recipe a little and get a great deep dish dough.

I followed the recipe exactly, then after reading a few other reviews decided on adding more salt, some italian seasoning and garlic powder... I also let the dough rest for 30 min and it grew quite a bit. 
The dough turned out great, perfect seasoning (I didn't measure otherwise I would tell you how much of what I added). Next time we decided to make 2 pizza crusts with this much dough instead of 1 big one. It was thick for out liking. 

I can't believe making pizza crust was this easy! Will def make again

My go-to quick pizza dough to make! I've already tried this a couple of times and it never fails. I've done the basic and other variation at times (Italian seasoning, garlic, basil, oregano, etc.) as suggested by other reviews. It can be pretty versatile.  I can make two 10-inch, not-so-thick, round pizza. We eat the first and freeze the second for later. This is a keeper. Thank you for sharing.

Thank you Chef:)   Only change I made was adding a tad bit more sugar to the crust.  All the pizza dough recipes online only add a teaspoon to the dough , and they are so "blah"...but increasing the sugar in your recipe yields more of a delivery style flavor!  I increased to 2 Tbsp   It was DELICIOUS!!!!!! 

Thank you again:)

so I made the mistake of using all purpose flour over bread flour for this and ended up with a chewer crust. other than that this recipe works great. I need to try it with actually bread flour, though works fine with all purpose just not my preferred crust.

So easy, my blind husband can make this crust! AND it uses 1/2 cup less flour than my other super-easy crust recipe. This crust is tasty and light and will be my "go to" crust recipe from now on. Thanks so very much for uploading this winner! Update: I started making this crust, using a rise time of 15 minutes in my oven on WARM, after adding all the toppings. This step works great, if you like a thicker crust. I also bake at 375F for 20 minutes. Pizza perfection!

I have made this several times now and  can say it works well I add honey instead of other  sweetener in with the proof (let stand for 10 min)  before adding flour  the crust comes out wonderful with fluffy rim and the honey makes it sweet.

Great for a quick dough.  Crust was really easy for any level chef.  I would make it again for a thicker crust pizza, not a good choice for a thin crust.

Very good!  I used (1) recipe and got two decent sized square thin crust pizzas.  I added basil, oregano and onion powder (1/2 t. each) to the dough.  I brushed the pan with olive oil before placing the dough on it and then I brushed the dough with olive oil that I added garlic powder to.  Baked crust at 450 for 5 minutes then added sauce and toppings.  Returned to oven for 17 minutes and it was perfect!

very forgiving...this came out great even though i screwed up. i forgot to add the olive oil at the proper time. after i mixed it up, i set it aside to rest a little and discovered that i missed the oil. i threw it in and kneaded it by hand, then let it rest again, about 10 more minutes. other changes, then i rolled it into a rectangle to fit my baking pan and let it rest again, about 30 min. added sauce, cheese and sliced mushrooms and popped into 450 degree toaster oven. after 10 min i turned it down to 425 and cooked 10 more min. it developed a nice thick, "deep dish" style crust.  great taste and texture.

We made this last night for the 1st time.  I have made 100's of pounds of pizza dough commercially for a bar that I worked for.  This by far was one of my favorites!  I of coarse changed the bread flour to 1 1/2 cups unbleached Wheat flour and 1 cup unbleached flour.   I kept everything else the same.  It turned out fantastic!   Thank you for the recipe!

This was an amazingly easy recipe to follow. I read some of the other reviews and added some Italian seasoning and garlic powder. I left the dough rise about 30 minutes and prebaked it for 5 minutes at 500 degrees before I added my sauce and toppings. I then reduced the oven to 450 and baked the pizza for about 15 minutes. It was better than some I've had from local pizza shops. I'll be making it often when I get hungry for pizza.
Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made it twice now and added garlic, italian spice mix, and a little extra salt and sugar for more flavoring. It still feels like it needs a hint of something more for taste (but I like REALLY flavorful crusts), but it's impressive how little kneading and rise time it needs - although I always do a little of each. :)

This recipe is great as-is. I usually make pizza dough in my bread machine but didn't have the time today. Whipped this up in less than 20 minutes and it was awesome.  I will definitely make it again!   Not sure if using a pizza stone makes a difference but I did and it was great-  not tough or hard.  Now to wait for my pizza connoisseur to wake up from his nap....

I love this recipe, from start to finish my pizza is ready in 30 minutes.  The kids love it!  I sometimes add oregano to the dough and brush the edges with olive oil.  Yum!

This recipe is absolutely perfect. I made it last night and it was a huge hit. I tried 3 different recipes  before and none turned out as great as this one. I also made it by hand, kneading for about 5 minutes and sprinkling flour on the dough every once in a while to get to the right consistency. I did let the dough rise for 2 to 3 hours which is the only change I have made. Didn't even have to use a rolling pin to shape it, 17 minutes in the oven and we had a perfectly cooked and crispy pizza. My fiance absolutely loved it and I was told Pizza Hut and other restaurants and brands can't make pizza as well as I do. This is the easiest crust recipe I have ever made and by far the best.

This is my go-to pizza crust; it's easy and doesn't require raising time.  However, cooked according to the instructions here, it comes out soggy.  I made one simple adjustment:  I parbake the crust for ten minutes before putting on toppings.  I mix in some garlic powder and Italian herbs, then add a mixture of Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago cheeses right before baking.

It doesn't seem to cook all the way through when you just add toppings and bake. I recommend par-baking, then adding the sauce and toppings to make sure the crust is completely cooked. Super easy to make at home!

From 9000 feet altitude: Super easy, simple, and good.  I made one batch straight from the mixer to the oven and it was great.  Another I made in the morning, let rise, punched down, then put in the fridge until I was ready to use it.  Both made an easy, delicious pizza crust as thick or thin.  I had to add a bit of flour, just to keep it from sticking in the mixer.  Maybe a quarter cup at the standard recipe.

I've used this recipe a few times  because it's pretty easy and basic. It is pretty bland though so I either add more seasoning to the dough or brush it with olive oil and garlic powder. It's not necessary to use bread flour, I never have and it turns out great. 
Also, if you seperate into four portions and let this rise at least 30 mins you can bake it at 425 for about 25 mins and it makes a great basic French bread mini loaf! Can also freeze the raw dough. Very versatile recipe.

Used packet of  rapid rise yeast -that's what I had.  Vegetable oil.  dough rested 1 hour only because people were running late.
It was delicious.  Crust had a bit of crunch on bottom edges and soft and fluffy  inside.    Made on pizza pan.   Will definitely make again.

Great recipe. I did not have bread flour so just used all purpose flour. Followed the recipe other wise but decided to add some basil , parsley, garlic powder, and onion powder to the mix. A few shakes of each for flavor. It came out great! I wish I had a pizza stone. Just used a pizza pan covered the bottom in olive oil also covered the edges of the pizza with olive oil and sprinkled some garlic powder over it. I baked the pizza for a few mins until the middle was cooked and then put all the toppings and baked for 10-15 mins. This recipe is a keeper.

I have made this dough several times, I love it. It's quick and easy, turns out every time. I have added seasonings from times to time as others have mentioned. Garlic powder, sometimes I've cut in fresh basil etc. But it's great plain too. I'm making some right now!

I added garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the dough for some flavor. I made mini pizzas for the kids and I and they take about 10 minutes to cook, which is nice. I thought they were delicious especially considering I barely had to do anything to make the dough! Great recipe :)

This is one of the best pizza dough recipes I've tried. I usually have to use 1-2 more tablespoons of flour than this recipe calls for. I bake the dough for 10 minutes in a large cast iron pan before adding the toppings.

This was super easy, delicious crust. I actually made the crust in the oven for 12 min them took it out, added Nutella and march mellows, then put it in for 1 min regular oven then 2 min Broil. OH MY GOD:) Enjoy if you make this crust with a twist.
Note: (Nutella in the oven for too long is not good, so make sure your crust is almost or fully done before you add these toppings)

This was surprisingly good.   I did let is set about ten minutes and with no kneading it came out very good.  Will make again for sure.  Thanks

Added a little extra olive oil so not so doughy. Also, be sure dough is not too thick before cooking.

First of all don't use a pizza peel even if coat it with cornmeal it sticks.  I couldn't slide it off the peel onto the pizza stone.  It ended up being a doughy glob with cheese and pepperoni mixed.  Needless to say I'm off to look for a different recipe.

I've made this several times and it's great. Don't forget to sprinkle corn meal on the pan after oiling, poke dough with fork and bake for 10 mins before topping. I used Chicago style pan pizza (this site) for the topping. It gets rave reviews every time!
I found that if you let the dough rest for 30 mins  it rises enough to make two pizza's

Buttered a cookie sheet and sprinkled cornflour. Enough dough for a good sized rectangular rustic style pizza. Lightly patted olive oil around edges for crisping. Sprinkled salt, garlic, and Parmesan cheese on dough after ladling sauce. Baked for 30 minutes at 425 degrees. Rolled out thin and came out crisp. It's a bread crust and not flaky so you might need extra sauce but that's not a bad thing. Very easy and will do again.

Love it!  Turns out great and so easy and fast.  I love that its just basic.  I always bought premade dough from Trader Joes, but now I make a triple batch and freeze 2.  I use regular flour and either a pizza pan or a cast iron skillet.

Could be fluffier. In order to do such I added an extra 1/2 .25 packet of yeast. I also let it sit an extra 5 minutes. I do use this recipe quite often and my friends all love it. So does my nephew.

Love this, so easy!! Only thing I did different is dissolve my yeast in the 1c warm water while I prepared the rest. The dough came out fluffy and was enough for a large square pizza pan.

Make sure to add tons of seasonings to the dough. Also, this crust rises SO much. You will probably want to spread it out and make 2 or 3 pizzas. I am pretty much eating bread right now, that's how thick it is.

OMG... finally found one we LOVE!! We have just moved to new state, and no one carries good pizza dough here, so we decided its time to try homemade. after trying a few, I found this one followed recipe, only I kneaded the dough and added a dash of Italian seasoning to the flour... and it turning out perfectly!! Just enough crunch on the crust, not chewy, and the best taste ever! Look forward to making this one each week on pizza night!

It was great, super easy and quick. I made it not for pizza dough but to use the dough for herbed flat bread to go with homemade soup.  I allowed it to rise  for about 30 min because I had time, pressed it out onto a cookie pan, brushed it with Olive oil and added Italian seasoning and cheese.   Everyone went back for seconds (and thirds!). Definitely a keeper

I came on this site to find a quick Bisquick like pizza crust, when I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try. I was running late and needed a quick crust for breakfast pizza. We usually use jays crust found on this website and my family loves it. I just throw it in the bread maker and roll it our when it is ready. 

 I was disappointed in this crust. 1st there was no way to "stir until smooth". I had to fold in the flour by hand and this took a very long time! So much for fast! I still did not manage to incorporate the whole 2 1/2 cups (I probably got in more like 2c). 2nd, I expected this recipe to make about 1 large pizza, I was wrong again. I made a small ball of dough which probably would have been sufficient for a med. pizza. I have a large family with three growing boys, we really needed a large pizza crust. Not having time to make another I went ahead and tried to press the pizza dough out to fit my pizza pan. After much taring (and swearing) I almost gave up, but I persevered! I put it in oven to pre cook a bit...it barely rose..it was pretty flat (yes my yeast is good, I made bread 2 days ago with it) but everyone was hungry so we dug in and ate it anyway.

 Taste wise this was ok...it was not what I expected, based on the description. It was not at all soft and chewy. We found it rather thin and very crispy and , but I had never had this issue with jays crust. If you have time go for a

Definetively...  Very, very,  delicious crust. I made it with all purpose flour because I didn't have Bread flour in the pantry, and it came out great.  I also topped it with chicken breast and sauteé onions. My husband really liked it, I will prepare it today with Bread flour.  Thank you for this delicious pizza crust.

Honestly will never use any other pizza dough recipe. I generally make a quadrupled batch and freeze half for another night when I am stretched for time. Than I make two pizzas, one for kids and one for the adults.

I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and the rest was white bread flour.  It turned out very light and tasty

Awesome and easy! I did add garlic and Italian Seasoning to the crust for a BBQ pizza.  Next time I will make a supreme and add more garlic and seasonings to the crust and brush the edges with garlic butter when done. Thanks for the great addition to my recipe book!

This was absolutely delicious! I was trying to find another recipe I used before. (This one was close to) With mine I used olive oil, pollyo cheese, some dried oregano sprinkled on top, and nice ripe sliced tomatoes from the garden, I devoured a couple of slices. I'm trying to wait patiently for the next one made with steamed broccoli and mozzarella...Now this is my favorite! I know all ovens cook differently: I have a gas stove and I cooked pizza at 375 for 25 mins. Thank you!!!

What an easy pizza dough!!   It was very tasty .   I used all purpose flour and it turned out fine.  I did roast garlic in the oven and added it to some olive oil.  I brushed the crust after rolling it out with the garlic/olive oil mixture.  This gave it great flavor.  I also sprinkled Italian seasoning into the dough when I was mixing it together.  Family loved it!!!

This crust is an easy, tasty homemade yeast version if you don't want to bother with letting a dough rise twice.   I wanted something easy for my kids to make, too, as I am teaching them the love of cooking from scratch.

Became a member just to show my appreciation for this super excellent recipe.  Tried it yesterday. I got three super pizzas ready in an hour and a half from scratch including the pizza toppings.  The base was springy and crisp at the bottom but soft as well. And really easy.  Good bye to store bought bases.

Great recipe! I have been looking for a simple pizza crust recipe and I have found it. It tastes great and looks good too and it's not got so many ingredients and steps to make it more hassle than a store bought pizza crust

My compliments to the chef!!!!!! Wow!! I was in a pinch for dinner because my hubby did NOT want fish so I had nothing else ready. I found this recipe and thought it will be just like all others I've tried (16 to be exact) it just won't taste right.  I WAS WRONG!! THIS IS GREAT!!! Didn't need to rise  and very quick and scrumptious!                                                       CHANGE I MADE: USED canola oil instead of olive.

This is a very good pizza crust recipe!  I usually buy the pizza yeast and follow instructions on back but I was out of that and only had quick rising yeast.  So I found this recipe.  I liked it better than the other.  And our 4 kids gave it thumbs up as well!  Easy to prepare :)

I made this last night and my family couldn't rave enough.  Truly the best pizza crust recipe I've found. The dough was fantastic to work with and baked with ease, but the taste and chew feel was perfection.  Thank you so much, it's already gone into my recipe box.  YUMMY

Only thing added was garlic powder, but the whole family loved it. Also I found it was better when the dough sat out for 20 minutes. When we made the second pizza it was more fluffy.

Didn't work for me at all.  Way too much flour, I ended up with 1/2. Cup of flour, which it couldn't take.  Crust too doughy, not crisp. Big disappointment

Best with bread flour. So easy. I do not work with yeast for anything else but this because it comes out perfectly! Can be doubled or tripled as needed.

I made this crust tonight and followed it exactly (although I eyeballed the olive oil, I'm a heavy pourer so there may have been an extra tablespoon of olive oil)asside from bake time. I baked it at 400 F for 20 minutes, I use a nonstick dark pan prone to burning whatever I bake on it, so I lower the temp. Regardless, I think 20 minutes at 450 would over bake the crust. This is the best no rise pizza crust I have ever tried. Heck, this is one of the best crusts I've made rise or no rise! I don't think it needed any seasoning, unless you like that specifically, which I do not. I do think it is essential to use bread flour, you can expect a good crust with all purpose, but don't expect it to come out as good as if you used bread flour.

My family loves this recipe and ever since I first made it over a year ago haven't stopped asking me to make pizza. I use all purpose flour and haven't had a problem yet. so far the crust has turned out great every time just the way it is. 
   I normally make this crust times 8 when I make it, so no problems doubling either. It's very easy and quick to make (unless you are making 8... then it isn't quick so quick) and we will definitely be making it again and again.

Love at first bite! We made personal pizzas by dividing the doubled recipe into 5 pieces, and baking for 10 minutes instead of 15 - 20. Also, since we don't own a pizza pan, we tried a cookie sheet - works just as well.

I have used this recipe for about four years now and just made the best one. The winning combo was bread flour (not all-purpose) and Fleishmann's Pizza Crust Yeast. Excellent!

Super easy and tasty, not so easy to stretch out on a pan because it was not elastic, but great still. I replaced one cup of the flour with white whole wheat and you couldn't tell in the texture. Even better the next day for some reason

I'm not very experienced making pizza dough and need to learn how to shape it without losing the air but it turned out pretty good.  I added garlic powder to the flour for some extra flavor.  Will definitely make this again.

This was such a hit at a girls night pizza and wine party! So quick and so easy! I did add garlic powder and italian seasoning because of previous reviews and I think that made the crust! I also brushed a little olive oil on the crust and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Delish!

Tried this recipe for dinner last evening. Even though I did not have a clue on what to make for dinner, I was in no mood to spend 2-4 hours on pizza. But the "Ready in 30 minutes" caught my eye and I went ahead with making this. I had dinner ready in 1 hour. And the taste was out of this world. No mess, no fuss and ready in a flash. Perfect for any time and any day of the week.

I cooked my pizza at 500 degrees F for 11 minutes.

I've made many pizza crust recipes, usually including an inconvenient rising time. This one has become my go-to. I've made it at least 5 times. It makes homemade pizza quicker and easier than takeout, and I have to say it tastes better too.

I've been making this dough for a while now-it's perfect.  So super easy.  I love that I don't need to let it rise or roll it out.  I use white whole wheat flour and throw in 2 cubes of crushed frozen garlic.  My husband and 4 kids all like it-I always double it!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I used all purpose flour, and 1/2 c whole wheat flour,  all I had,  had to mix in more flour to be able to roll of,  but I figured it out,  will do  again soon!

I've made this recipe several times and it's so easy and very good!  I've used it with pizza and calzones and tonight I will use it to make stromboli.  I follow the directions exactly but some other suggestions here about putting some herbs into the dough sound amazing so I may try that another night.

Great recipe!  Comes out like a pretzel crust with a nice chew and good flavor.  Don't bother greasing the pan, just sprinkle some cornmeal and put your rolled dough on that.  In my oven 17 minutes is perfect.

Awesome recipe. Done in a snap. l used regular all purpose flour and it turned it wonderful. I let it rise for a bit while I made the sauce so it was thinker crust but still wonderful.

Amazing and easy! I added some onion and garlic powder to the dough and let it rise for 30 minutes. Kids and husband approved. I was to use half for a pizza and half for cheesy breadsticks. in fac5, I've made two batches of this dough today because everyone requested more cheesy bread sticks. Delicious!

So easy to make this crust! This recipe is awesome! I didn't have bread flour so I used half all-purpose flour and half wheat flour just for fun. It turned out perfectly! Definitely keeping this one!

I split this into seven 3oz balls and was going to make mini pizzas. I found that one of  these balls rolled out and baked alone for a couple minutes turned out like yummy Naan bread! I ended up using two 3oz balls to make thicker mini pizzas and folded over the edge to create a crust.  SUPERB!! I substituted one TBSP of olive oil with Greek yogurt to cut the calories and fat.

Love this, so easy just like the box, from scratch! It was really crispy and chewy, like the pizza at the mall. I made mini pizzas and the granddaughters really liked them. Thanks for the recipe that I will use again and again!

Amazing! Honestly, I'll never use another recipe again. I finally perfected this and the family loves it! They want pizza ever night! My daughter was so excited this evening that she ate the whole 2 pieces she was given... And the crust! I follow the recipe (other than adding fresh basil and oregano to the mix). Before putting the pizza in to cook I olive oil the crust sprinkle some salt, garlic powder, and Parmesan cheese and dang... It's so good. Would make excellent bread sticks as well. I did let it rise for 30 with I packet of quick rising yeast.

This is 5 stars...IF you let the dough sit for 30 or so minutes.  It came out very soft.  My daughter says it's the best crust ever.

This is 2 or 3 stars...IF you let the dough sit for only 5 minutes. When baked it was like a hard biscuit instead of a soft pizza crust.

As others have said, make sure you add your own seasoning to the dough.  I traded out the 2 TBS of olive oil for 1 TBS olive oil and 1 TBS of butter (then mixed the seasoning in the mixture).  It turned out pretty good.  Next time I may skip the olive oil and just replace it with butter.  We'll see.

Added Italian seasoning based on previous reviews. I split this into two thin crusts. Tossed a pinch of cornmeal in the bottom of my 12" cast iron skillet and baked it on the grill for 12 minutes (crust bottom was golden brown). I have baked this at least half a dozen times on the grill and it is wonderful every time. I use a volcano grill,with cover, 20 briquettes, but it would work on a gas grill just fine. Plus, there is enough heat left for a cobbler on the grill while enjoying the pizza!

After Cauliflower crust flop found this. Great and fast. Next time will add a little more sugar. Also I poked it with holes and baked it for a few minutes before I added toppings.

Loved this recipe. Husband and daughter liked how it held up for leftovers. No soggy crust. It was piled high with toppings. Was quick and easy. I like that you can adjust the amount to make more or less. Will be my go to pizza dough. Will try as a flatbread next time.

We have pizza every Sunday and this is our go to crust. I double the recipe to get three pizzas. Sometimes I will add either garlic or onion powder to it (or BOTH!).  We do pre-bake the crust at 450 until it starts to turn golden. Our family likes a lot of sauce and cheese and that keeps it from being soggy.  Fantastic recipe!

Fantastic and easy. I let it rise for an hour or so (since I had the time) and it was wonderful. Very sweet and yeasty flavor. Much easier than the 3.5-hour double-rise pizza I normally make!

Super easy and delicious! Used cornmeal instead of flour when patting out directly onto my pizza stone. Put olive oil on stone first then sprinkled cornmeal on top before patting out dough, using extra cornmeal to keep dough from sticking to my hands.

I've been searching for the perfect pizza crust recipe for over a year, and I've finally found it.  It's quick, easy, and is good and chewy and soft - just the way we like it.  Highly recommend this recipe.  I substituted whole wheat flour for 1/4 of the total flour and let it set an additional five minutes, and it was perfect.  May try increasing the whole wheat next time.

Just made this. I did oil it and let it sit  30 min to rise while I prep other ingredients. I oil and sprinkle cornmeal on pan, stretch out the dough on pan, poke with fork, oil & season and bake for 5 minutes prior to toppings. This makes and amazing pizza!

This is a great recipe and can be modified.  Sub honey for sugar in same amounts, sub some whole wheat for bread flour.  I do knead it a bit and recommend letting it rest an hour or more.  It holds up great if you freeze it too.

This is the easiest pizza dough! It's light and airy never gets too hard or chewy. I keep coming back to this dough. Can't get enough of it!

This is the easiest and most delicious crust. I add a little italian seasoning and garlic powder to my oil before adding it to the mix. My nephews always request to make their own pizzas when they spend the night. I like thin crust and it is delicious thin or thick. My husband rolled up string cheese on the edge to make stuffed crust, yum. We have even rolled hot dogs in it topped with cheese and the kiddos raved over it as well. So versatile, quick, easy, and delicious. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

This was perfect for our quick homemade pizza. We decided last minute to make pizza and I was worried that we wouldn't have time for the crust... then I found this little gem. Super easy and delicious. the crust puffed up to be really bready in some parts but that's likely due to my uneven rolling out... still delicious the kids and adults loved it. I doubled the recipe to make 2 pizza's. Edit: timing is innacurate: 45 total time from prep to eating.

This very close to the recipe I developed over 30 years of trial and error trying everything possible to change ingredients and technique in the process.  Mine comes real close but as you all may or may not know flour moisture content requires adjustments from day to day to produce consistently good results.  On a humid day flour may be much heavier with water in it.  Arid climate will produce lighter weight flour to volume ratios.  Making dough is an art form and one perfected by experience over time.  Large commercial producers use test equipment to not only monitor flour moisture content but use weight ratios to produce their dough/crust in a consistent manner.  I would simply recommend you add less flour up front and then add little quantities, kneading well between additions to get to the proper texture.  Knowing what the proper texture is the artform.  For instance, knowing that by kneading very sticky dough for a longer time will produce dough that isn't as sticky without adding anything.  The molecular structure of the dough changes over time (what some call resting the dough).  What happens is the strands of gluten bond with the water and other ingredients while it sits.  So many times folks ask me why when they use my recipe their dough is too sticky to handle.  Well it's because they don't have enough experience to understand that more kneading and resting is necessary.  How much you say?  That is the art.

First time I made a pizza crust like this, and it came out great! This is a really good recipe. I had most of the ingredients in my pantry already, so it's super convenient and simple. I tried doing what others said, and mixing in some garlic salt, onion salt, and Italian herbs. I would have added parmesan cheese, but I was out. I'm sure it would have added to it well! Overall good recipe.

This is a very good recipe. My spouse does not like sauce on his pizza, so this is great to make ahead of time and freeze for later in the week. I do brush garlic butter on the dough, and then bake it for about 3 minutes. Wrap it in saran wrap and foil, and cook it when he wants a quick treat. Yummy!!

It was great that this crust was quick, but it tasted too flour-y and was very dry.

Loved this crust! I used instant yeast & put all ingredients in my stand mixer with dough hook. Mixed on lowest speed for 4-5 minutes. Let dough rest about 10 minutes. Spread into an oiled cast iron skillet that I had pre-warmed a bit, and it turned out great! Next time I think I'll bake the crust for about 5 minutes before adding the toppings  (putting it in the skillet made for a thick crust that could use a little longer cooking time). Definitely making this again!

This recipe was fast and easy.  I had to add a bit more water, which is normal for my recipes, because I live in a very dry area.  This recipe tastes as good as my slow rise dough recipe, and it made enough for 2 pizzas!  Other dough recipes claim there is enough for 2 pizzas, but this one actually delivers.  It is my new favorite dough recipe.

Decent. The inside was slightly dough-y so I cooked it quite a bit longer than called for. I also found that it was incredibly hard to cut into pieces. Served my function well, though. I got lunch :)

I love this recipe. The only problem I had was that the dough didn't cook through the first few times I made it. I found that putting in the oven for five minutes, then putting the toppings on and putting it back in the oven for five minutes. Though my oven is generally cool and uneven in its cooking.

This is the best pizza crust recipe I have ever used, it is very  simple and if you split the crust recipe in to two pizzas instead of one it makes these delicious individual Italian style pizzas with the bubbles and everything!

This is a great recipe for in a time pinch. I made it exactly as directed and it wasn't bad, just denser than my family likes. The flavor was fine. I made a second batch, added garlic and italian seasoning to flour,  let rise about an hour and then spread on pan.(Yes, spread. This dough is super soft and doesn't require a rolling pin!) My family loved it!

Awesome pizza crust!  I made this exactly as written except used all purpose flour as this is all I had on hand.  Made four small pizzas from this one recipe.  Rolled out pizza dough on floured countertop.  Placed it on pizza paddle covered in cornmeal.  Topped pizza. Slid directly on pizza stone which was heating in 450 degree oven.  Cooked for 10 minutes using 6 ounce balls of dough rolled thin.

I liked the dough and it was simple to make, but pretty bland.  I'll add garlic and basil to the recipe next time.  Also, I found the cook time to be a little longer than necessary.  When the bottom is nicely browned, you can take it out.  My pie was nicely done in 13 minutes.

This is my go to recipe. I just started eat a bit healthier and I substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour and still use a cup and a half of all purpose or bread flour.

The dough was thick, doughy, and very bland.  The only things we liked were our toppings.  I think I will just look for a recipe that lets the dough rise next time.

I'd never made pizza crust before but this was so easy and baked perfectly. I followed the recipe exactly.  So much better than store bought and not too dense like some take-out crusts can be.  Delicious!

I love this recipe. It's a bit too bread like too be perfect, but the ease of it makes up for that! I use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups all purpose (I never have bread flour around). I usually let it rise for a little while, but only 20 minutes or so.

It is quick, and it is easy. It doesn't quite give me the consistency I'd like in a crust but so far I haven't found a homemade recipe that does. I have used this recipe several times and like to add two tbsp of grated parmesan as another reviewer suggested.

Love the ease and simplicity of this recipe. It is one that doesn't take a huge amount of time or fancy ingredients.  I went with other reviewers and added a bit of garlic powder and Italian seasonings to add a little kick. You also may need to adjust the amount of flour depending on the moisture in your kitchen. (An extra 1/4 c. did the trick for me and kept the dough from being too sticky.) One note, it makes a large amount of dough! I doubled it and got four round pizzas.

I liked this enough, especially with adding the herbs to the crust.  I am admitting that this is the first time I've used a pizza stone, and I was looking for a nice, easy dough recipe.  This definitely was nice and easy.  A little sticky, so I needed to use a little more flour when turning it out.  Again, I'm still getting used to my stone and exactly where I want to put it in my oven.  The crust cooked well when I stuck it in the first five minutes.  Didn't stick to the stone at all.  Then, I put toppings on and put it back in the oven. Took a little longer than I thought for the pizza to finish, and the crust still felt a bit play-do like.  It tasted fine, but it was incredibly heavy and just felt like it wasn't "done."  I will definitely chalk most of this up to beginner's error, but I think I'll be experimenting with other doughs as well.

Made this dough for my kids and I.  My son said it was the best pizza he had ever had.  I have been using a Betty Crocker pizza dough recipe for years but this one is quick and easy.  We are going to be doing it again tonight.  Thanks for making dad look good.

I used to make my pizza dough in bread machine which took an hour! This is just as good and quick to make, I do like to let it rise for a little time before baking!! Yummy! Great with some Italian seasoning added too!

I really like this recipe. I assembled my toppings and sauteed my mushrooms while letting the dough rest on the pizza pan. The crust was thicker the way we like it. I will get toppings ready ahead when we make it for my grand kids who like a thinner crust.

Only reason I didn't give it 5 is becuase I add a few spices that aren't listed in recipe  and that's what makes it a 5 star! My husband is a pizza expert ;) and very hard to please and he LOVED the crust. I followed the recipe but then just added dashes of onion powder, oregano, basil like another reviewer suggested! Will be my go-to crust always and forever from now on!

Maybe being from Chicago I have higher standards for my pizza lol! But this crust, just like any other I've tried to make myself, is nowhere near pizzeria quality. I didn't alter the ingredients but did let it rise for at least an hour, as some said rising helped it. I used a pizza stone as some suggested as well. I baked it five minutes on its own at 450. It puffed up like a dutch baby even though I had pricked it several times before putting it in the oven. Once I flattened it, I added the rest of the ingredients. I would have preferred using a pan because I don't find it easy to take it in and out of the oven off the stone so was standing there in the heat adding ingredients! The crust was way too thick for one pizza yet didn't seem to be enough to divide in half.  I cooked it 17 minutes total which was at least two minutes too long using a stone. It was kind of hard and brown plus chewy. As others said it was bland even though I added olive oil and spices to the top after rolling it out.  The two good things I will say about is that it can be made faster than crusts that need to rise (maybe my mistake was letting it rise longer) and that it wasn't soggy at the bottom like most homemade crusts I've tried. Though a variation of this would work in a pinch, I will be sticking with store bought pizzas for a while! These homemade pizzas take far too long and aren't good enough for all the effort involved ... In my opinion!

This is such a great base pizza recipe. To help liven it up, I spread olive oil and garlic onto the crust before baking, yum! It's such an easy recipe that I can feel confident in making pizza often in my home. No more paying for processed pizza, this tastes better and is better for you. Thanks for the recipe.

Tasters said this was my best pizza yet. I've tried several types of doughs, but this beats even the store bought pre-rolled dough. I added a small crushed garlic clove and some dried oregano as I was mixing the dough, which made it very flavorful. The dough was very wet for me, so I heavily floured the rolling pin while I was rolling it out.

I did not care for this recipe. The crust was too dense for my taste.

We make this pizza crust 2-3 times a month and my family loves it!  Sometimes for some extra pizzazz we use garlic olive oil and add oregano and basil to the recipe. 
It is also a good one to throw into the food processor to mix it up.

I made this with the "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" found here on Allrecipes and it made a great combination! I just did a basic pepperoni and mozzarella pizza.

I used 1-1/2 tsp of instant yeast instead of 1 packet of active dry, but proofed it the same anyways just because I like to test if the yeast is still good before adding to the whole recipe. 

Other than that I didn't change anything and it was great. 

The only issue I had was it was a little bit rubbery? I'm not sure if it was the pan I used though. I would really like to try this one on a pizza stone rather than a non-stick pizza pan (with holes).  But I'll have to buy one of those first. lol ;)

I will have to check out the other reviews to see if anyone else had that issue. But even if I can't figure out why it's doing that it was still very good. It seemed less rubbery as it cooled too so maybe I just ate it too fast. :)

A definite keeper for us! I love that it's SUPER easy and fast, and doesn't require a bunch of rises to make. Just perfect for making a quick pizza!

Next time I try this I will also try to brush it with a butter-garlic mixture for a little oomph of flavor. Without it is still good, but it sounds like it'd be even better with that. Will update review on how it turns out. :)

Love this recipe, so easy to make as long as you have yeast in your cupboard and pizza toppings on hand.  I have made this several times for my daughter who would live on pizza if I would let her.  I do add some garlic powder to give it an Italian taste.

As advertised - soft and chewy crust. And no waiting. 
I'll never resort to Trader Joe's in-the-bag crust again!

It worked. I liked it, but it was not exactly Pizza Hut or Papa Johns crust. It was not as light and airy. Ill try again, because it was my first time making crust and using yeast; and there was a yeast mishap. I killed it with boiling water and had to re-add fresh yeast to old dough the next day. So, maybe it is super cool that it worked at all. Ill try again. Also, I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour.

This was an easy dough recipe to create.  I put it onto a half sheet pan.  My family said it was even better than Pizza Hut.  As a matter of fact, my wife has already requested me to do it again.

Very quick and easy. I always have these ingredients on hand so it is our go to meal these days. We also add oregano and basil to the flour when making the crust. We serve it with homemade pizza sauce from scratch as well. Just tasty. There is something so satisfying about making a great meal like this from scratch. It makes it taste better.

Very easy, this was the first time attempting pizza crust.  My son likes to make his own personal pizzas and normally uses sandwich rounds, we were out so I used this recipe to make 8 personal pizza crusts for him to use.  I went ahead and made 2 of them with toppings, he loved them.  Thanks so much for such an easy recipe.

Super easy. It's great for a quick crust. Thick or thin crust it's turned out great.  I've also added garlic, Italian seasoning, etc for fun. Made a dessert pizza by adding extra sugar and cinnamon. It's not just for pizza.

We just used this recipe to make tiny pizzas(about the size of pizza bagels).  It was fantastic!  I love the taste and texture, not too soft, not too crunchy.  I'm excited to make a whole pizza with it!

This pizza crust really is quick and easy.  It is not my favorite dough recipe, but works great when you want to make a pizza spur of the moment and not have to wait for dough to rise.

4 stars for flavor and texture and a 5th star for ease of preparation and the fact that I always have these ingredients on hand. We've used this for pizza crust several times and last night I used it for breadsticks - added 2 minced cloves of garlic, rolled the dough into logs, brushed the tops with butter and sprinkled with parmesan. Baked at 450 for probably 20 minutes until the tops started to brown. Next time I'd let them rise a smidge before baking for a lighter breadstick, but they were still great!

Edit 5/24/25: I consistently use at least 3 cups of flour for this dough now, and it gives it the right consistency (smooth and elastic, not too sticky).

The crust was tasty and it was nice to have it ready so quickly.  The dough was hard to work with though - very sticky even after adding about 3/4 extra cup of corn flour when kneading and rolling out.  My son said the dough was very thick, but he loved it - ate all of his!

WOW, what a great rising pizza crust. We used rapid rising yeast instead of active dry yeast and added the yeast to the dry ingredients first like you should with rapid rising yeast and then refrigerated it after letting it sit for 5 minutes to activate. When we decided to use it a couple hours later we took it out of the fridge rolled it out with a little bit of flour and cooked it on a pizza wheel. We used a little less sauce than usual to keep it from becoming soggy. This is the best crust I have made from home yet and will continue using this recipe. Must try for a rising pizza crust from home.

This was good and quick and easy just as promised.  I did add some spices to the olive oil based on another reviewer and I would do that again (1/2 teaspoon basil, 1/2 teaspoon oregano and 1/4 teaspoon onion powder).  I think as a personal preference next time, and there will be a next time, I will bake it for 5 minutes and then add the toppings and see how that goes.  The top of the pizza was very done where as I felt the crust could have been cooked a little more.

You do need to do something to flavor the crust a little.  Next time I'm going to try adding balsamic vinegar.  That was from a recipe for quick yeast bread that I found.  My husband knew right away that it wasn't my usual crust.  Liked the texture though.  The temperature made the top a little darker than I like.  I think you probably need the baking time to cook the crust so will take it out a little sooner next time.

This was great for ease of making.  I used a rectangular raised edge cookie sheet sprayed with a little cooking spray and spread it out right on there.  I did try other reviewers suggestions of putting oregano, basil and onion powder in crust as well as sprinkle it with Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese after crust was spread and before adding sauce and toppings.  I thought it was still bland, so will next time add some minced garlic when mixing up the dough.

This recipe is amazing. I too let it rise about half an hour, but I used garlic olive oil instead of regular and added rosemary and italian spices to the water before mixing. I use all purpose flour too. My husband loves it and asks for it often. I always make home made pizza but never made my own dough. Not sure why people say it isn't as good as one that rises. Add what you want to the dough. It's amazing!!

Every time I have made this crust, it bakes unevenly, and every time it seems to rise differently too. Also, the dough is sticky-wet and hard to manipulate. I prefer the "Pizza Dough I" recipe on this website. Very slight differences in the recipe and directions, but that recipe never lets me down.

This makes a pretty large pizza. I didn't press mine out too thin, and completely covered my rectangular pizza stone.  The dough is a good base, and next time I'll likely add some herbs to it to give it some additional flavor. I'll also probably double the batch again, and then save a crust or two in the freezer for pizza at a later date.

Very easy!! Followed the recipe exactly! I made this bread for a cal-zone- so good! I drizzled oil on top and then seasoned with Rosemary. Next time I will try it with some sea salt as well.

I used this recipe after finding the Chicago-Style Pan Pizza here on allrecipes; it was suggested in several of the reviews.
It was very easy and tasted wonderful! It was my first attempt at homemade pizza crust.
I made it as a surprise on a Saturday evening and my family absolutely loved it! They request no more pizza from the local pizza places!

Excellent!  We have made a lot of home-made dough's and this one is tops, for sure!  I added just a bit of garlic powder to the dough but, otherwise, followed the recipe precisely.  Perfect dough.  :)

There's probably better pizza crusts out there, but I doubt you'll find any as fast, easy, and delicious as this one.  I highly recommend using a pizza stone, I tried baking this in a "pizza pan" and it just didn't work nearly as well as the stone.

What a fantastic recipe! I added THYME to the crust and instead of the expensive Olive Oil I just used regular Oil. I'm a real Pizza lover and since I tried this Pizza Dough I never went back to a Pizza Restaurant! It's YUMMY YUMMY!

Tried it and loved it. Roll it thin if You want a more pizzeria style or thick for that home made zing.
Slightly chewy and crunchy it came out great and could be easily molded in to a shape of Your choice.
As mentioned in a comment I did 2 tsp of yeast for 1 pack.

Will most certainly make more. =]

So far, this is the best pizza crust recipe I've tried! I made it with hard white spring wheat flour (to be healthier) and added about 2 tsp of gluten so that it would rise like normal bread flour. Tasted great, but I think this yields way too much dough for 1 pie. I made a 12 inch pizza, and the crust was about an inch thick! Next time I will probably half the recipe.

this recipe made a really good crust, I used exactly the stated amount of ingredients, and found this crust too thick, but that was only because it was only two of us eating it, so for a family 4+ this thickness would be great, will use 1/2 the amount for a thinner crust next time if it's just for two of us. Forgot to take a photo, will do next time, as there definately will be. Very easy to do and not time consuming.

This was very good! Although, the first time I made it, it didn't rise, so it was flat and didn't taste right, so the second time, I let it rise for 30 to 40 minutes and it turned out great! I also used 2 1/4 tsp. of instant yeast, (2 1/4 = .25 ounce package of active dry yeast). My mom asks me to make it regularly for the family.

Made it very quick in my KA mixer. Has a really nice chew to it. I used the conversion on the jar of yeast instead of packages. This was my first attempt at homemade pizza and will definitely do it again.

Easy and quick!  But it did not bake fully in the middle.  I think next time I will bake with sauce and veggies before I add the cheese to ensure it is fully baked throughout.

1/19/16 made it again,  and this time  the pizza dough cooked fully. Placed it on a round pizza pan and baked for 20 minutes, less ingredients on top. It  was vey firm but tasty. I added some garlic and onion powder to the dough.

Wow! This pizza crust is so far the best I've had! It really rises a lot after you roll it out. I love thick crust so i doubled the recipe ,and made one pizza from the dough. The crust turned out thick and beautiful!!! Love it!

I made this pizza crust recipe because I was in a hurry.  I didn't expect much. It was delicious. I always do a quick pre-bake with my homemade crusts before I add any toppings. I pre-baked this crust for 5 minutes then put on the toppings, returned to the oven for 15 minutes. It turned out great. If you want you could always do a traditional first rise, punch down, and then form your crust. This recipe is a keeper.

Love this recipe!! I'll never use pizza dough from a tube again. It's so easy to add flavor by using whatever spices you prefer and I love the fact that I don't have to wait for it to rise. My husband loves my homemade pizza and thanks to this recipe I can make it whenever he wants. Thank you Chef Rider!

This is our "go to" recipe every week.  It's good on its own or easy to adapt by adding spices if you like.  I  use 2 cups regular flour and 1/2 cup gluten flour to make it a bit more chewy (how we like it).  Thanks!!

I would re-title this recipe "Deadly Pizza Crust". This is just too good! I followed the recipe exactly besides for the part where it says let rest 5 minutes. I let it rise for 30 minutes in a bowl covered with a towel for a fluffier texture. I made two versions. For the first version I made golf size balls and flattened it with my fingers, brushed on some oil, arranged sliced olives-saute'ed onion-tiny strips of pickled sweet red peppers on top, and sprinkled some coarse salt over it. For the second version I added garlic powder to the dough, made finger sized logs, and brushed a mixture of chopped garlic-oil-paprika-onion powder-garlic powder-salt on top. What can I say? Heavenly stuff! My advice to you first timers? Double the recipe right away. There's no way you can just eat one:)

Love love loved it!!! Never ordering pizza again, this was great and it was very easy. Next time I'll make my crust and let it bake a little before adding my toppings to give it more of a crispy crust. Only need to do it like 10-15 min crust alone

Great pizza dough! Easy and delicious. Versatile, I've made Stromboli's with this dough too. Great for those who might be afraid of yeast or are new to baking breads.

Wonderful full crust that has the perfect balance between thickness and that thin crisp texture.  Also absorbed the sauce at just the right level for my family.. JUST soaks into the crust with NO soggy limp crust! Followed recipe exactly as given.

Quick, easy and delicious. I put the dough in the oven  for about 5-10 minutes before putting any toppings on-this ensure that it won't be undercooked and gives me time to cut up all my toppings in the meantime.

Liked this recipe a lot - super easy - my hubby devoured it. Like others, after mixing dough and forming into a ball, I let rise 20 minutes as 5 wasn't enough. Delicious - will try again with cake flour!

Good recipe but I think the yeast is too much.  Have a difficult time keeping half dough for future use.  Dough cracks up too much. However the pizza made and cooked, thin crust only (recipe enough for 2 crusts for me)was fabulous.  Will do follow-up when i reduce yeast.  My calculation conversion .25 oz equivilant to 1 tbspn.

This is the best pizza crust recipe. I make it at least once a week. I make garlic fingers with it too. I followed the ingredients exactly. Often I make it earlier in the day, and let the dough rise longer. Results in a more bready crust.

I made it following the recipe without any changes. Used some premium olive oil and it was too overpowering. Dough was sticky and had to use quite a bit more flour. I like the basic recipe but will probably change it up a bit next time.

I have returned to this recipe several times and I love it. It works perfectly and it really is a great treat any time. I love that I don't have to use half my day to make it. Anyone can do this and add their own imagination to make it theirs. We no longer order delivery pizza in our home thanks to this recipe!

use this recipe for my pizza tonight.it was nice not to have to wait forit to rise. It was a nice surprise when it actually worked. Next time I will definitely put seasoning in the batter and use only one tablespoon of oil. The crust I was a little sick and might have benefited from cooking 5 minutes at 450 before putting toppings on. My pepperoni got very burnt. But overall it is a great recipe.

This dough turned out great! The only substitution that I made was using brown sugar instead of white. I was a bit concerned after the mixing step when it was smooth but sticky. However, by adding more flour when it came time to knead and roll out it developed a perfect consistency. My kids had a lot of fun forming it onto our pizza stone and adding the toppings. Our cheeseburger/ cheese pizza was delicious.

Just used it to make a pepperoni pizza, and didn't stretch it out too much and it was super fluffy when it came out of the oven. Will definitely use this recipe for my pizza crusts.

I was having a few families over and thought it would be fun to make homemade pizzas. I bought all kinds if toppings but forgot to buy dough for the crust! In a pinch I tried this recipe! I was not sure if it was going to turn out because I didn't have enough all purpose flour so I used half cake flour and I had expired yeast! It was so fast to make! No kneading required! It turned out great! Everyone thought it was delicious! I'm sure it is healthier without all the chemicals pre made dough from the store has! I will be saving money from now on and make this recipe instead of buying pre made dough!

Very easy and quick!  And just as good as if I had made a crust that takes an hour to rise. This is my go-to recipe. I use it for bierocks, stromboli, calzones and pizzas.

Quick & easy crust that can be modified easily to compliment the type pizza you're making (Italian herbs, garlic, onion, Parmesan. BBQ rub, etc). Outstanding recipe that is now my go-to pizza crust... No more pre-made crusts for me....LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!!!!

I have made this recipe now for a while and I really like it. I like to make the rise time after mixing 30 minutes. then I roll or press into a buttered pan then cover with wax paper. then turn the oven on warm when oven is warm turn the oven off then set pan with dough covered with wax paper in the oven. then I let the dough rise again another 30-45 minutes. iv found that this way gives me the best most fluffy crust ever. other than the change up in preparation I love this recipe.

A very excellent pizza crust.  This was easy and quick just like the name implies and flavorful.  I will be making this many more times.  Much easier than I thought and it was so much quicker than thawing out the frozen dough I had purchased last week.  When you want a quick homemade pizza, this is the one.  The bottom and edges came out very crispy on my pampered chef stone.

We loved this recipe! Very easy to throw together for a quick meal. Per other posts I added: 
1. 2 1/4 tsp. is .25 pkg. of yeast  
2. Added 1/2 tsp. of basil & oregano 1/4 tsp. onion powder to oil for crust
3. Brushed the edges of the crust with garlic powder mixed in oil
We found that there was too much dough for our regular sized pizza pan, so we took out 1/4 of the crust.

I love homemade pizza dough...this was truly the easiest road to eating pizza! I also added Italian seasonings to the crust with a dash more salt. I like the crust dipped in olive oil! Super easy, super fast....most of all super good!

I now add garlic powder, basil, and oregano into the dough and it tastes amazing!  I also let it rest for a little longer when I have time which makes it a bit lighter.  But even using this recipe exactly as written, our family loves it.

This is as advertised...quick and easy. Also tasty, and versatile as listed in previous reviews!  No longer buying pizza mixes.   Divide dough in half and freeze for future.  Thaw in frig or on counter. Have made it and found letting it rise for an hour will make dough soft and full.  Press down on cookie sheet, spread lightly with pizza sauce and prebake for 5-8 minutes produces a crispy bottom crust but top is moist and chewy.  My only pizza crust recipe.  Now my whole family makes this.

My husband and I loved it.  May cut the sugar down to 1/2 tsp (may even use brown sugar next time), but will be our go to crust for sure.  Easy, crunchy on outside and soft on inside. Put on very bottom rack to ensure browning of crust and prevented toppings from burning.  Took approximately 19 minutes.

I have used this recipe a few times, trying both all-purpose flour and bread flour.  This dough comes together nicely and is easy to work with.  It isn't necessary to let the dough rise (30 minutes), but it helps.  This dough is enough for two medium 14" thin(ish) crust pizzas.  I also like to brush the dough with butter and garlic before adding toppings.  YUM  :)

Very easy, considering that it came out delicious on the very first attempt. We needed a lot more all-purpose flour than the recipe called for, but otherwise, it was a great recipe! We will be making this again, perhaps with a few more spices mixed into the dough. Thanks for making at-home pizza a cinch! P.S. I highly endorse pizza stones :)

This pizza crust is WONDERFULL!  I have made it many times since I first found it.  I use all purpose flour and let it rise for 10 to 20 minutes depending on how busy I am. besides pizza, I have used this crust for calzones, cheese filled crust, bread, and even deep dish pizza. The crust can be made to be chewy or crispy according to how thickly you roll it out. I love this especially because the other one I used took about 1-2 hours (or even overnight) to rise, and I would have to plan it about a day in advance so that it would have enough time. With this one however, I have a pizza ready and cooked in 40 minutes max. I don't think it turns out as fluffy or chewy if you only let it rise for 5 minutes by the way. If you are doubling or tripling the recipe (like I always do) then I recommend cutting it into about 4 balls before letting it rise so that it will be done sooner.  I haven't tried adding herbs or anything else to the dough, so I'll try that next. :)

Wow turned out great! I let the yeast sit in the water for about 10 - 15 minutes and after I mixed in the other ingredients I let that sit for about 15 - 20 minutes. I did kneed this a little and then rolled into a ball. I put a 1/2 tsp water and 1/2 tsp oil around the ball while it was sitting for the 15 - 20 minutes. I usually use a store bought crust that is inexpensive but makes a thin crust. We like that, but now have this recipe that is even cheaper, .30 - .45 cents, and it makes a thick pizza crust for when we want a thicker crust! Plus just totally yummy! Thanks great recipe :)

Loved this recipe!  I took this a step farther and when stretching it out on my pizza pan, I made sure it was extra thick on the edges.  I then took 4 pieces of string cheese, cut in half, and placed them all around the edges, folding over the extra crust and pinching it shut to seal it in.  VOILA...Stuffed crust!  The family loved it!  I will absolutely use this recipe again!

This is beautiful crust! Reading all the reviews, I added garlic and 1/4 tsp sea salt in addition. I used Amish roll butter in place of the olive oil. I mixed everything into the yeast mixture before the flour. It turned out absolutely gorgeous. Heavenly. Just heavenly! 

This is absolutely THE BEST pizza crust recipe in the world! I didn't have a problem with it spreading onto the pan. No ripping, no problems at all. THANK YOU!! Thank you for this recipe!

So glad I found this recipe. I was going to make my usual bread-machine pizza dough, but ended up being away from the house for hours and didn't have enough time to make it that way. My brother still wanted pizza, so I did a search to see if there was any pizza crust I could make in a hurry. I came across this recipe, and with all the good reviews, I figured I would give it a try. I'm so glad I did. It was SUPER simple to make. I love the fact that you can add your toppings and bake it all at the same time...unlike my bread-machine recipe that requires pre-baking the crust for 20 minutes before adding toppings. The crust turned out great. Not only did it look amazing, but it tasted great too. It was nice and browned around the edges and on the bottom, but still nice and soft on the inside. My mom said it tasted better than pizzas you buy! My whole family loved it. I doubled the recipe and made two large pizzas. Now we will be able to have left-overs. :) I would definitely recommend this recipe. It's my new go-to recipe for pizza crust. Easy and delicious. What more could you ask for?

I made this two days ago and gave the recipe three stars. I now suspect something was wrong with the yeast I had previously used, cause I Tried it again last night and I HAD to do over that review. WOW! was i wrong the first time! It came out PERFECT! Probably the best pizza I ever ate! Both my husband and I were in awe with every bite and had to fight not to wolf it down. I took it up a notch by adding 5 large cloves of minced garlic, 1 tablespoon of honey and 2 tablespoons of oregano to the fermented yeast mixture just before i added the flour. I ended up with more dough than i needed so i put the rest in the fridge and i plan to turn them into cheesy sticks or something tonight. My extra touches resulted in heavenly yumminess! The texture was sooooo perfect. Better than any pizza i had ever bought. I will NEVER buy pizza again! Thank you for this recipe!!!

This was extremely easy to make and very good.  I love that it uses "normal" ingredients and you don't have to really make it too far ahead of time in order to eat it.  It will be a family recipe!

Very easy, tasted good. The kids liked it. I didn't have bread flour, so I used all purpose flour and it turned out just fine!

We were trying to think of some different meals for our extremely picky kids and decided to try a pizza bar.  After finding this recipe for the dough we gave it a try.  It was a huge huge hit with everybody including the parents.  The dough is ready in minutes and the 30min given is accurate given the baking time required.  We did the kids pizzas a little thicker and ours a little thinner and both came out great, not too doughy and not too crisp.My favorite thing is the price, compared to buying a pre-made Boboli crust, this is a fraction of the price and just as good and is fun to make with the kids.  We will definitely be putting this into our regular rotation.  Thanks so much.

I made this tonight because I forgot to buy pizza dough at the grocery. It definitely is quick, came together well. I just made plain pepperoni and baked it at 500 for 15 minutes (what I usually do with store-bought). It seems a little underdone on the crust front, though the cheese and 'roni are great. I would stick to the 15-20 minutes at 450 direction, maybe this would cook the crust better while not letting the toppings get too burnt. Definitely tasted soft & doughy, but again I cooked at a higher temperature for 15 minutes.

Our family really loved this recipe. I've made other doughs that require along rising/proofing time, but this recipe makes no false promises. It's a great dough made quickly. I live in the Southeastern US and it's quite humid, so I usually need to add extra flour to make a workable dough. I just add 1/8 cup or so until it's a good texture. Also, I sometimes add honey instead of sugar.

I made this dough for my daughter's 8th birthday party. I tripled the recipe and divided the dough into pieces. Each child was able to make their own pizza. I made the dough just as written x 3 and it was perfect. The girls said it was better than the pizza parlor!

I wanted a quick pizza so I tried this... I have never made pizza crust without proofing before.  It was okay, not great. Too doughy, bready, etc.  I lost the topping flavors and only tated bread.  It was good, but I wanted pizza.   I did make the dough again right after, let it rise for 1 hour, punched it down, and let it rise again.  It smells AMAZING!  I will divide it and make two pizzas, and report back.

Very Good and really easy!!! I have made many different pizza crusts all which have failed and to be blunt, I am a really good cook but then again my standards are really high... Most crusts have a "yeasty" taste, but not this one. It was great! Follow recipe completely. Also make sure your water is 110... if its higher it will kill the yeast and if its lower it will not activate it. Use a meat thermometer to check. :) Thanks for the awesome recipe!!!

I have made this recipe a few times and I love it made in a cast iron skillet! follow the recipe exactly about but once you have the dough ball cut it in half and press half into the skillet and spread out the other half onto a cookie sheet and cut into strips for breadsticks. bake until both are golden and then brush the sticks and pizza crust with melted garlic butter. best breadsticks I have ever had

Tried making this pizza dough today! It was super easy. Did it in the kitchen aid, beat it a little with the whisk attachment till all the ingredients came together...then finished off with my hands. Followed the recipe exactly as written (and the video). Got a delicious fresh pizza in 30 minutes from start to finish!

This is great recipe! I did knead the dough for about 5 minutes, and then let it rise for about 30 minutes in the bowl, covered with plastic wrap. I also added some basil and oregano to the mix, about a tsp each.

Just made this dough and I am impressed. Easy and baked up great. I did let it rest while preparing the toppings, so it was closer to 15 minutes. After shaping I prebaked the crust for 10 minutes then added the sauce and toppings and baked for about 7 minutes more, crispy and very tasty. Thanks for sharing.

This dough was not the best as I ended up using all purpose flour (did not have bread flour).  I would not recommend this as it was very bland and had no taste.

This works!  I made a double batch and (of course) failed to read the details, so I put all the ingredients except flower into the bowl and then let it sit for the 10 minutes.  I think the sugar and yeast in the warm water worked even better than the yeast alone, because after adding the flour (and a little more to get the right consistency as I kneeded it) it really did it's thing.  Within one hour (the time it took to get the stuff out for making the individual pizzas) we ended up having enough pizza dough for 8 10" pizzas.  Nice thin crusts that rose just a little while cooking.  Just like in Italy.  Perfect.  

TIP - since the individual pizza were for the kids to decorate, we precooked the pizza crusts for about 4-5 minutes before toping them.

This really worked!  I always have the worst time with pizza crust for some reason and have tried so many different methods.  This one was fool-proof even for me!

Fast, easy, and delicious! You can't go wrong with this crust. It wasn't too chewy or crunchy and had great flavor. This is definitely a keeper!

YUM!  Excellent simple recipe.  I split the dough in 4 and rolled each out extra thin.  Topped each with different sharp flavours (sparingly) and cooked at 480 degrees for 7 minutes on a pre-heated pizza stone... simply amazing.

This is so easy compared to the other doughs I've made.  I was a bit worried it was too salty when tasting the dough before baking but it was just the right amount to go with my pesto pizza.  Yum!

I am a novice at bread making, and don't own a bread machine, so tend to seek out recipes like these. This recipe should be in everyone's rotation, it's incredibly easy, there's no major time waiting on the dough to rise and the crust comes out beautifully. Even someone as new to bread as me found this easy (and yummy) to follow. Would definately recommend. If you're just making one 12 inch pizza, I'd recommend using half the dough and freezing the other half for another day. My first pizza was um, VERY deep dish, lol, it really only needed half the amount (note to self: press thin into pan, crust will rise significantly while baking :) )

Not a huge fan.  I think the crust would have been better if it cooked alone for 5-10 minutes, then add sauce and toppings and bake a little longer, 'til cheese melts and toppings heat up.  As written my pizza came out with really dark brown cheese, and doughy crust.  The second pizza came out with cheese overdone and crust underdone as well, even though I reduced the bake time by 5 minutes.  I think I'll look for another crust recipe, which is a disappointment, since I like the "quick and easy" part.

This is the first review I have ever left but felt it had to be said. I have tried many pizza dough recipes and this was the best thus far.. I doubled the recipe added 1 tbs of Italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder to the dough. let it rise about 10 min and let the kids make their own personal pizzas.. I did precook the dough for 8 min at 470 degrees before adding the sauce and toppings then returned for 15min at 420 degrees. The crust was soft and flavorful! Will make again!!

Best pizza crust I've EVER made... tastes great with a gluten-free flour mix too! I do, however, recommend baking for about 7 minutes before adding your toppings. Also, we added granulated garlic in the dough... mmm mmm mmm... terrific!!!

So, I didn't read the recipe carefully enough before beginning and I didn't have bread flour on hand. The crust still came out good, I imagine it would be great with bread flour and will try it again. I took the advice of other reviewers and added some Italian seasoning to the flour. Very quick and easy pizza dough recipe.

Great recipe for tasty and quick pizza.  I use bread machine yeast so I don't have to proof it and all purpose flour since I don't ever have bread flour.  I split the dough into 3 pieces, roll them out to 16" circles and put on the toppings.  I also sprinkle italian seasoning on the dough before I spread on the sauce.  I like to use my grill to cook these pizzas at 550 degrees, so they are done in half the time and taste great!

This crust is awesome! I love that I don't have to wait so long for the dough to rise. It's perfect for a busy person who wants to make a "homemade" pizza but has little time to actally make it after a long day at work. Tastes great as a crust or even as cheese bread.

Amazing pizza dough!  I have been searching for a great pizza dough recipe and this is it!  I added 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp Basil, 1/2 tsp of oregano and I mixed some garlic powder in some olive oil and brushed it along the edges before putting it in the oven.  I took these tips from other reviewers and wow, was it ever amazing!

I put the first 3 ingredients in my Cuisinart without the blade, and then drop the dough blade after a few minutes, then add the rest of the ingredients and pulse until it comes together.  Let it rest for 5 and knead 'till I get a windowpane.  I oil a half-sheet pan and press the dough out .  It is a cross between Sicilian and Chicago style .  This also makes a great bread stick.  Roll out to a square, lay strips on a parchment covered sheet pan, brush with garlic parsley butter and herbs, a sprinkle of garlic then parm and mozz.  Yummy.  This is a fantastic dough of you like chewy crusts.  Thanks for the recipe.  Needs no planning. I can throw this together quicker than ordering a $20 pie...it costs me less than frozen and tastes fantastic!

This is the basic recipe for pizza dough! When I first tried it I felt duped. This is foccacia bread I said! Well, yeah. Same recipe!
The second time I left it rise, then used a bigger sheet pan, and it was--the typical chewy somewhat strechy pizza dough you'd call hand tossed.
That's what great about this recipe. You can make it in the time it takes to chop up the veggies, or wait for the rise time. Either way it's the recipe I'll always use. Better homemade pizza than take out anyday!
And yes, like every bread recipe the amount of flour is going to vary. Add herbs and garlic if you feel it's too "bland", like, pizza dough is!

Great recipe!  Added the oregano and onion spice to the crust and couldn't be happier.  Thank you for a quick and easy and delicious recipe.

This is now the ONLY pizza crust I make. It is very tasty, and I can't get over how simple it is to make! Very versatile, too; I usually make a "plain" crust and a Parmesan-oregano crust. Delicious! I make this at least once a week!!

This is by far the best pizza dough recipe I have ever made! I did as someone else did and added 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp basil and 1/4 tsp onion powder. I baked the crust at 400 degrees for 10 mins and then added my toppings and baked another 15. It was the best pizza dough I have ever made and I have made a ton looking for the perfect one!

I tried this recipe for the first time and it was a last minute plan. It was very easy to make and baked in the oven great. I coated it with olive oil (very lightly) to make the edges brown and crusty. I went very easy on the toppings- it came out great. My kids even liked it.

I have tried many many pizza crust recipes, this has been the best so far, both in ease and time. After reading the reviews, I dissolved the sugar and yeast in 1/2 cup warm water, and saved the other 1/2 cup warm water for the final mix. I used 2 1/4 c. stoneground flour (it's heavier), and the recipe still came out great. I made a garlic spinach and mushroom parmesan pizza and my husband loved it. Thank you so much for this recipe!

This is a great recipe & very easy to make.  I sometimes add wheat bran or use wheat flour for some of the regular flour.  You can add granulated garlic or whatever herbs or spices to suit your tastes.  Like many others, I let the dough rise a bit.  When ready to roll out I just put in on an oiled cookie sheet & spread it out with my fingers.  As far as toppings are concerned, I just go with whatever I have around the house.  I really like using a pesto sauce that I pick up at Costco instead of a tomato sauce.  Play around & put whatever you like on this crust the sky's the limit.

I like this recipe. It is quick and easy. I have also used Tyler Florence's on foodnetwork, but it takes all day and I will only make it on a weekend b/c of the time. So, with that said, this tends to be my go to dough. However, the first time I made it, it was a little too bready for us. My husband is a east coast italian guy, no chicago style in our house and even hand tossed in most restaurants doesn't fly around here, so we split this recipe in half and make two light pizzas out of it. I suppose I give it a little time to rise as I'm cutting up toppings and making sauce too, that might help it, I'm not sure entirely. I cook at 500 deg for about 5 min and comes out great.

The only thing I do is let it rise.  With even a half hour you can get a bit of a rise out of it, and I can get two thin crust pizzas that taste divine!  It's now my go to recipe, and I even mix it up a bit with 50% whole wheat, just to make myself feel better about eating pizza!

I love this recipe! I won't use any other dough again! Oh, and I never keep bread flour in the house, so I just substitute regular white flour and it comes out perfectly. It's so versatile--I use it with bbq chicken pizzas, buffalo chicken pizzas, and regular pepperoni pizzas because it goes great with anything I can think of!

Love this crust! Super easy to make, I just toss it all into the food processor and let it go until it’s a dough ball. It did come out very sticky and loose, so I added flour (all purpose) until it was more workable. No need to let it rise. My only complaint is that I am a messy cook and flour gets everywhere, but that’s not the pizza's fault. Been using a cookie sheet as a pizza pan and it comes out great. I also like to spray some olive oil on the pan and the crust. Helps it crisp up and easier to get out of the pan.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because it delivers what it says...quick and easy! I have to start by saying that this was my first time ever making a homemade pizza. Although I feel pretty confident in the kitchen, making a pizza sort of intimidated me. This recipe changed that! This recipe produced a perfect, thin and crispy crust for my pizza. For those who think that the crust lacks some flavor, I think this can be fixed by experimenting with a pinch of this and that. I brushed the crust with olive oil once it was in the pan, then I pricked it all over with a fork because I think my mother-in-law does that, and then I sprinkled italian seasoning all over it. I can now make homemade pizza anytime...So happy I tried this!

This is a very versatile recipe, and very good also. We use it regularly on Beer and Pizza Friday. Sometimes I make it as written and sometimes tweak it, depends on what kind of pizza we decide to make. It always turns out great. If you need or want ideas to change it up a bit just read some of the reviews, so many people have some great ideas, or just go crazy and start adding stuff. So far I have never used a mixer I just mix it by hand and cook it on an old pizza pan I stole from my parents 25+ years ago and it came from a pizzeria that went out of business so it must be at least 35 years old I don't grease it, corn meal it, or flour it and the crust does not stick. In our oven 475 seems to be the right temp.

This recipe is exactly as it say, quick and easy!! I was surprised at how easy it was to spread and it cooked perfectly, chewy yet crispy. I used olive oil for some extra flavour and cooked it the whole 20 min, definately a keeper!

I like the density and texture of the crust (but I did use whole wheat flour).

I used it for a Hummus Pizza (poodlemoluc's recipe on this site), and it was delicious.

This crust is the best! I was in a hurry and forgot to add the olive oil...so I brushed on the edges of crust and drizzled on top. Perfect texture! Also ground up some Italian spices and added to flour. Wonderful and easy! Will definitely make again!

This is pretty good, quick and easy just like the recipe says. However, mine tastes a bit like yeast, so that's not too great. But all in all, a great crust.

I've made this a few times and it always turns out great! After trying the original, I've found we like it best with 1 tsp of Italian seasoning and 2-4 Tbsp of Parmasan cheese mixed in for some added flavour. 
I just tried it with whole wheat flour tonight and used 1 3/4 cups whole wheat and 3/4 cup of all purpose. It was a little chewier. If you're used to whole wheat variations of things this would probably be fine. If you like a really crisp crust, it might be a little much for your taste so you might only want 1 or 1 1/2 cups of the whole wheat.

I prefer a thin crust so I use this recipe as is, just half it, and it results in the perfect amount of crust for a 12" pan.

My husband and I loved this pizza crust ! It was very easy and quick. When I rolled the dough out it was way too big for my pizza stone and I had one heck of a time transferring it from my cutting board to my stone. I would recommend cutting the dough in half and making smaller pizzas. I would also recommend using parchment paper, I used it under my second pizza worked like a charm !! Just for those who might not know, wax paper isn't the same as parchment paper !      

I will be making this again !!

Excellent recipe -- very quickly, very easy and tastes like you let it rise all day.  Texture is a *little* dense, as you would expect from such a quick rise, but we love that even more!

wow! what a perfect recipe! So nice to have a pizza crust recipe that does not require rising time. Perfect for a quick lunch or dinner idea that doesn't take up much of your time. I used spelt flour due to some allergies in my house and worked out well. I like the flavour of spelt and it still rose to be thick crust. Very tasty. My 'go to' pizza crust recipe for when i'm in a rush!

We used this recipe tonight since my hubby did not buy pilsbury crust from the store as I had asked him to. This is my pizza crust recipe from now on. It is good and quick and easy. It is very tender.

First ever crust I've made and it was a hit. I did NOT add/change anything, and overall the bread taste is a bit plain/yeasty for me, personally. But I highly recommend making this and then determining if you want to add a dash of this or that to suit the pizza you're making. So quick and delicious!

This dough really IS quick and easy! I made mine with all purpose flour, then with bread flour, then with whole wheat flour, then with whole wheat bread flour--it turned out beautifully each time! I added a teensy bit extra water and olive oil when using the regular whole wheat flour, just because the variety I use can be quite dry, but otherwise, I didn't change a thing about the recipe; each time, the dough came together into a soft but not unmanageable ball. I'll admit, I cheat on the "handmade" part by mixing up my dough in my stand mixer, but I have a feeling that the dough would come together just as nicely when kneaded by hand. I like to make a batch (or double-batch) of the dough, and then divide it into smaller portions, setting aside one to use right away and wrapping and freezing the rest. I thaw a portion of dough overnight in the refrigerator, let it hang out on the counter or in a warm place for about an hour before baking, and then stretch out, top, and bake. Delicious, simple, fast = GREAT. Thank you for this recipe!

I had burned a pre-bought crust for a veggie pizza...ended up being a good thing!  Pressed for time, I tried this recipe using whole wheat flour, a glass pan, and reducing the heat to 400 and eyeballed it til done (sorry, didn't time it).  Turned out to be the best crust I have ever had on a veggie pizza...the company raved over it!

I just used this recipe to break in my new baking stone, and man was it delicious!!  Hubby came home early from work and he was HuNgRy.  Found this quick recipe and I (accidentally) doubled it, and added a little garlic powder less sugar.  Off the chain!!!  And he loved it!  I am totally using this tomorrow when we hang out with some friends.  Crispy, crunchy, chewy, bubbled up nicely!!

This is a great recipe. I left mine sitting for an hour before I kneaded it (I had unexpected company). I also added a dry parmesan spice blend, garlic powder and fresh parmesan to the dry ingredients before mixing in the olive oil and yeast/water. This turned out great! Cooked it on a pizza stone for 15 minutes with toppings and it was awesome!

Crust was delicious! Never made pizza crust before, and only worked with yeast once or twice. I used garlic olive oil which gave it a nice flavor, but next time I would add more herbs--basil, oregano, onion powder, and some garlic, as well. I imagine it would also make delicious breadsticks.

I didn't have bread flour when I tried it, so used unbleached flour and it came out great!  I stuck to the recipe as written and my family loved it.  This will be replacing the recipe we've been using.   We had extra dough (made a double batch), so we used it to make breadsticks with melted butter and garlic salt w/ parsley and melted cheese.  Those were great, too.   Thanks for the great, easy recipe!!

I love this recipe and use it all the time. It's great for those nights you don't feel like making a big meal-- from start to finish it takes only about a half hour.

My oven runs very hot, so I cook it at 350 for 15 minutes and it's perfect. The time and temperature here would burn it to a crisp.

I tried this receipe and it was good. The pizza crust was thick and chewy. I did add some garlic powder, oregano, and basil to the flour before I mixed it. I had some time, so I let the dough rise for an hour.  Baked it for 15 min and it came out just right.

Here's a quick pizza dough for those days when you don't have a lot of time after work.  I made this with the BBQ Pulled Pork Pizza recipe on this site, and the combination was superb!  Sometimes, when I eat pizza, I eat the crust extra fast, because it is not good, but this crust is great!  After reading reviews, I suggest adding basil, oregano, parsley, & onion powder to the olive oil before adding to the dough.  Also, let the dough rise in a warm dark place for a 1/2 hr (if you have the time), and spread a mix of olive oil and garlic powder along the outer crust for extra flavor.  Also, I used a pizza stone, which always helps pizza cook evenly.

For a no-rise recipe, I thought the dough turned out pretty darn good. Great flavor and thickness, just a tad chewy. Will definitely use again when I'm short on time.

Still looking for a quick(or any good)homemade crust recipe. I followed the recipe and baked my pizza on a stone. Crust was bland, heavy and rubbery. So many of these(DIY)pizza crust recipes tend to turn out more like biscuit dough. Oh, well...on to the next!

I have never reviewed a recipe before, but felt compelled to rave about this one. I have been making this dough for over two years with no modifications. It is truly fast and easy! For better or worse, my family eats pizza a lot more often than we otherwise would! My husband is italian and he enjoys it too!

A great crust that is great rolled. Out thicker for a thick crust, or even used as a calzone. I have also added 2 tbsps of sugar to the dough after adding the flour to be used as a rust for a dessert pizza

Just didn't work for me...consistency and taste was closer to a drop biscuit made with bisquik, not any sort of pizza crust.  I imagine using all-purpose rather than bread flour was the reason.

This is the best pizza crust! It is so soft and chewy. Next time though I will add about 1/2 c flour more at least and then knead so it's not so sticky trying to roll it out and adding flour at that point.

LOVED this recipe and so did my husband. I've made quite a few homemade pizza crusts and this is by far the best to date. I've written this down in my recipe book and will be using it from now on! I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder to the flour, delicious!

Very thick yummy crust for 12-inch pizza. We LOVED it! I did omit the cornmeal dusting on the pan out of sheer laziness, and I agree that would have given a bit more flavor, but was very good as is. We loved it!

This is exactly as the title suggests: quick & easy! I've been using it now for almost a year and we've developed our own pizza, made the way we like it ~ better than takeout any day!! I add 3 generous teaspoons of dried minced garlic and 4 generous teaspoons of dried minced onions to the crust for a super savory crust. By using lard on our pizza dish, the crust comes out crispy on the bottom and yet, soft and chewy. We top it with about 2 cups of shredded mozzarella, 2 cups of shredded Monterrey jack, 1/2 cup grated fresh Parmesan cheese, fresh tomatoes (seeded and chopped), oven broiled mushroom slices (to extract the juices), and whatever other toppings strike our fancy on that day. The result is a fresh-tasting pizza everyone loves and asks for the recipe. Many thanks, Chef Rider, for this great recipe!

I really enjoy this crust!  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I altered the recipe slightly adding some garlic and other spices to the crust to make it more flavorful.  It is a nice soft dough, easy to make and takes no time at all.

This recipe was a dinner saver for me tonight.  I had purchased refrigerated pizza dough from the deli case and accidentally glued it to my waxed paper!  I had recently bought yeast at Sam's, and had everything but the bread flour so I used all purpose.  Went together great (thanks to other reviewer Robyn for letting me know how much yeast to use!), made a thicker crust than I normally like, but it tasted great and cooked up in exactly 15 minutes topped with my Buffalo chicken pizza toppings!  In case you want to know those, blue cheese dressing as the sauce, diced chicken sprinkled with dry ranch dressing and sauteed in butter then mixed with wing sauce; crumbled blue cheese and tons of mozzarella (oh, some of the mozzarella goes onto the dressing first!)  Will do again since I have 2 pounds of yeast!

I seasoned the bottom of the dough by slathering margarine on the bottom of the dough round, then I sprinkled 2 tsp cornmeal,1 tsp oregano and some seasoned salt. Then I placed the seasoned side down on the pan, topped it and baked the pizza as recommended and it was pimpin :D

Doubled the recipe to use in my 16-inch pizza pan and l.o.v.e.d it! Doing it this way created a nice, thick crust that baked perfectly at 15-minutes.  My husband went so crazy for it that I made pizza two days in a row.  I did need to add more flour than the recipe called for by doubling it as it was way too moist and sticky, but the flavor was great, it baked up beautifully, and I'm definitely not looking for another pizza crust recipe.

Very easy to make, my two preschoolers helped me. I made no changes and it came out great. I used parchment paper and cornmeal to slide the dough onto my pizza stone. Yum! I will definitely make again.

a good base, i tripled it, we have a lot of kids, mostly boys and they all like things different. i went ahead and added a little more salt, just a pinch, and a good 1 and 1/2 tsp. of italian seasoning.it made it really yummy, and the smell while it baked was making our mouths water! i lightly kneaded the dough, put it into a oiled bowl (olive oil) covered it w/ plastic wrap and let it sit maybe 10 minutes or so, divided it. i placed it on a lightly oiled baking sheet with corn meal scattered on it, and it spread nicely, no holes! that's one for the books for me!! and it was great. i prebaked the crusts until they were just starting to brown, sauced them, cheesed them and topped them how the kids like and cooked them for another 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the pan. it was great.

This pizza dough was great! My dad used to spend 2-3 hours making homemade dough! This only took about 15 minutes to make! It was so delicious that it was hard to stop eating it! The crust came out light and bread like, quite soft. It was not too dry and chewy like some crusts. It is better to let it rise for a few minutes in a warm oven though. But not a problem...I simply prepared the other ingredients while my dough rose. I used to work at Mountain Mikes Pizza for several years and this dough recipe is just as good or even BETTER than theirs! This dough is certainly easier to work with. This dough isn't so "springy" and keeps it's shape well which makes it a lot easier to form. I will definitely keep this recipe handy for many years to come! We really enjoyed having it for Christmas dinner!

Excellent! This is the first time I have ever made homemade pizza (and it's Christmas Eve).  I had a little trouble trying to press out the dough with my hands, so next time I think I'll use a rolling pin.  Thank you.

I Added baking powder to all purpose flour to make it more like bread flour.  Also had to add a bit extra flour to stop the dough from sticking.  Came out great though.  I will definitely make again.

I'd give it 3.5 stars. This was a good pizza dough for dinner in a hurry. My kids loved it, but I didn't "love" it, the texture reminded me of a homemade buttermilk biscuit...
I'll keep this recipe for future use when I'm in a hurry to make dinner and don't have much time.
If you have one of those counter top rotating pizza ovens, this really isn't the best dough for that since it rises A LOT! It would be fine for an oven or a larger than 12 inch dough.

Found this one night when I wanted to make pizza but was pressed for time, and I'd never go back! I did find that for only one pizza the crust was a bit thicker than I'd like, so I divided it to make two crusts instead. Thanks!

Who wants to wait an hour for dough to rise on a weeknight?!  This is a PHENOMENAL recipe. I don't keep bread flour on hand & the recipe works just fine with regular flour. I've used the dough with red sauce, white sauce...just about everything.  As one reviewer suggested, use half the amount of water with the yeast and then add the second half while mixing..seems to fine tune the consistency of the finished crust. Since initially trying this recipe about 3 weeks ago, I've gone to it 4 times since! You won't be disappointed.

I made this for a party.  It turned out great the first time and I've never had luck with bread.  My guests were impressed with homemade pizza.  I used a thermometer to make sure the water was the right temp.  I don't have a pizza stone and used regular flour.  I did sub 1 cup with whole wheat.  The bottom edges were nice and crunchy.  Yum.

I make this in my food processor. Blend the dry ingredients, proof the yeast in the warm water and sugar, stir in the olive oil and drizzle into the running machine until it forms a ball. I form the crust on a sheet of parchment paper right on my pizza peel, then when it's all ready, I slide paper and all onto my pizza stone and just wait for the brown, gooey goodness that IS homemake pizza! I've also added a few dried herbs into the dry ingredients for a different take, basil and oregano are naturals!

First time I've made dough from scratch.  This recipe is perfect for impatient people like me!  I made a pan pizza in a cast iron skillet.  Next up is a Chicago style deep dish pizza in aforementioned skillet.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and will be used REGULARLY!!

I used this recipe when I was short on time for a breakfast pizza. It was awesome. I got a lot of complements on it! I used it again for regular pizza and it was super! I did modify the recipe by baking the crust untopped for 10 min and I also used all-purpose flour. This is a keeper when you are short on time!

Easy and awesome. Added spices to it of course, and a little beer for flavour. Also, I cooked my pizza on 500 F at 15 minutes. Try it!

This was good, it rose a little too much, causing some toppings to slide off, and was very filling, more than restaurant pizza, but it was very tasty and easy to work with.

Love it! This is so simple and has a great texture. I add a bit of granulated garlic, oregano, and basil to add flavor, and I also use half whole wheat flour. Super easy and quick.

This is the best recipe for pizza crust. I was hesitant about trying a yeast recipe that doesn't require much rising time, but the times are correct.  While the crust varies slightly from time to time (depending on temperature, etc) it always turns out very well.  I introduced this to a friend who doesn't cook much, and she has never had it fail on her either.

Been trying to bake yeast goodies (dinner rolls, cinnamon buns, mexican bun) to no avail. All ended up hard all the time. But this recipe is superbly fool proofed for an amateur like me. I used purpose flour and lessened the measurement a bit, the crust turned out soft and nice. Going to make this as my basic bread recipes. 

Yet, still looking for that thin crispy crust pizza.

Wow. Best crust ever. I've made other recipes from this site and others. You would think using the longer recipes that require you to rest and let rise, punch it down etc. would be a better option, but i not even necessary. I made some adjustments bad on trial and error. I used a thicker pizza pan lightly sprayed with oil.  I used 1Tbsp only of garlic oil, instead of 2T . I think its important to really have yeast that has about an inch of foam on top, be patient and have fresh packet. I poked it with a fork and at 325 in my oven, it worked perfectly. After about 20 minutes, it was browned lightly with amazingly even baked fluffy crust.
 My favorite is 1T softened butter and 1 1/2 T garlic bread seasoning spread over the crust. ( don't use too much!) Fresh diced tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella , sprinkled with basil and black pepper before and after baking.

Used this to make grilled pizza on a weeknight. It's as quick and easy as a boxed mix crust but way tastier! This is going to be the only recipe I use from now on.

I really love this recipe, very tasty and relatively easy. 

I don't quite agree that the prep time is 10 minutes though, it's closer to 25 minutes. There's 15 minutes solely of waiting.

This was excellent!!!!  My neighbor popped in while I was preparing dinner, so the dough sat for about an hour.  It was easy to work with, tasted delicious and got rave reviews!  I WILL use this crust recipe again!  Very good!

So easy; I use this for pizza or halve it to make one panzarotti. Only problem is that it puffs up a bit more than I would like for a crust, but you can't beat the time it takes to make.

So awesome and so easy!  Turned out perfectly. I took another reviewers suggestion and added 1/2 t basil, 1/2 t oregano, and 1/4 t onion powder. Also I sprayed the pan with Pam and dusted with corn meal. The only thing is after 15 minutes the cheese on the top was starting to brown in spots but the crust could have stood to cook a tad longer. I think next time I'll turn the heat down to 425 and see if that helps.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  Quick and easy to make, it takes 30 minutes or less to make and bake - just as quick as delivery - and you know what's in it and it's cheap!  I will never pay for pizza again!

Substituted half of the bread flour for whole wheat (I actually substituted in a little wheat germ too, but my crust was a tad more biscuity than my ultimate preference, and I'm thinking that's why). Also substituted garlic salt for salt. Kindof forgot the olive oil altogether. I added dried Italian spices and a little carraway, too. The flavor was magnificent...and so aromatic!!!
On the pizza itself I mostly used ingredients in my kitchen that really needed to be cooked up or eaten soon: 5 or six cloves of chopped garlic, onion, very ripe tomatoes, the greens leftover from my radishes, kalamata olive spread, fresh basil from the garden, fried and chopped up bacon pieces and bleu cheese scattered all over the top with what was left of my tiny bit of parmesan. Overall, the pizza was FABULOUS!!! I only give the crust four stars because it looked a little plain without the substitutes (though it was a great, basic recipe to doctor up).

This pizza crust recipe was so easy to make and so delicious! After I had my dough on the pan with the toppings on it, I let it stand out for about another 15 minutes and brushed the edges with olive oil. I think the dough was able to rise more and got a little crispy from the oil. Simply delicious! I will definitely make again!

I let mine rise up both times I made it.  What I love about this is that it is no-knead so it really is very easy.  Just let the yeast sit in the water than throw in the other ingredients and stir.  Its good to know that if you don't have time you can use it right away instead of letting it rise.  Put enough oil in the pan, sprinkle with corn meal and let it rise twice and it tastes just like pizza hut crust.

Easiest and tastiest crust ever. I use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose or bread flour, and honey in place of sugar. Add some spices to the batter and bake. So good.

For what I wanted, this was perfect.  I was looking for pizza crust that could be made at the last minute and not have to rise for a couple total hours.  This was it.  Simple, common ingredients, tender results.  Flavor is no better (or worse) than the crust you make from a pouch.  Will make this again.

Wow - this couldn't be more easy! I have never made pizza crust in my life and it turned out perfect. I used AP flour and topped with basil pesto, cooked chicken, peppers and mozzarella - i will definitely be making this again.

This is the greatest thing. Not so much because it tastes good (really it's kind of bland... I can see why other posters have suggested added herbs or spices to it). What I love about it is how quick and easy it is! There's no planning ahead involved!  You want pizza? You can have a hot pizza ready in under an hour.  I've never had a whole lot of luck with yeast breads but this is so easy, I can't believe you don't have to let it rise and knead it. It's very easy to work with, a little sticky but a small handful of flour makes it very easy to stretch in the pan. I find the recipe makes a very thick crust, but I prefer thin.  The recipe as stated easily makes two 12 inch pizzas with thinner crust (though I usually do mine in a very large rectangular pan). So easy and way better than any of the "instant pizza crusts" available at the store! Thanks for the recipe!

I have made a lot of pizza crusts. While this one is not my traditional, crispy, New York style, for the ease and speed, it will now be my go to pizza crust! It was so easy to work with, and it tasted great. I used it for a taco pizza, and I will definitely be using it again soon!

This was very simple, and no waiting for dough to rise :D I doubled the recipe, and made 2 pizzas with it.  I think it was slightly too much flour but it still came out fine. I'm not very good at tossing / stretching out the dough, so my pizzas were more thick-crust haha.
*update* Using a rolling pin (well I used an empty skyy bottle lol) def helped. I made this dough recipe again and spread spinach/artichoke dip on top of it for a nice side dish with pasta:)

This has been the best tasting crust I've made so far.  It's chewy and delicious.  I did bake the crust about 10 minutes before I put the toppings on then baked it another 10 minutes after I put the toppings on.  This is a keeper!

This is an awesome pizza crust recipe. I make it even faster by using rapid rise yeast so I can skip the proofing step. Just mix everything in a bowl and let it sit for 5 or 10 minutes and it's ready!

I absolutely love this recipe! My boyfriend is a pizza fanatic and usually grabs a frozen pizza since he's hungry and in a rush. We decided to make our own pizza together on a budget. Instead of bread flour we used all purpose flour, organic pure cane sugar, and Hormel's uncured pepperoni. We tried to reduce the amount of chemicals from frozen or fast food joint type pizzas. The dough came out perfect and soft, airy, and puffy. It's better than frozen or chain type pizza brands. Thanks!

Pizza crust was OK.  Texture was more like bread then a pizza dough.  On the positive side it was quick, easy, and crispy.

I was looking for something different for a snack for my kids. I found a recipe for a peanut butter and jelly pizza problem was the crust was alot of work. So I found this one, it was simple and fast.  My kids are still talking about it and asking when I'm making it again. I just added  some cinnamon and flax seed to jazz it up.

This works like a charm.  I added extra salt, onion powder, rosemary and cracked black pepper.  I rolled this out  to about a quarter inch thickness, and it easily covered my entire pizza stone, so it makes a lot.  Delivery pizza is a thing of the past.

I added some seasonings to the flour before mixing. It was pretty good, I made 2 pizzas with it (I like a thinner crust). I was hoping that being thinner, it would be a little bit crunchy, but that didn't happen. Still, a good start!

I love this crust recipe. I hate making pizza if the crust takes too long. I want to decide to have pizza, make it and have it ate within that 1 to 1 1/2 hour range. This works with my schedule, and tastes great! I have made in 2 times in the past 2 weeks. I love it, won't be looking for any other recipes.

I needed more oil. It was pretty dry dough. It was quick and easy though. I like to use butter in my pizza dough and garlic. The kids tend to like mine that was better then the delivery. I will reuse though, just a tip to add an additional couple tablespoons of oil or butter.

Great quick dough recipe. I was surprised at how thick the dough became after cooking, but it tasted great. I cooked it about 18 minutes @ 450. The only down side was I apparently needed to add even more cheese and pepperoni (I had covered it) b/c after rising so much it looked like it had hardly any pepperoni or cheese. I will definitely use this recipe again though!

My kids loved this crust! It was so easy.  I used my food processor with the dough blade.  I did add a some of my kids favorite spices to the flour mixture, but that would not change the quality of the recipe at all.  It was so simple to roll out my 10 year old formed the crust.  Thank you so much!

I was concerned it wouldn't work bc I didn't have bread flour.  It was a little dense, but still really good.  I used my Kitchen Aid to kneed it for 5 minutes...may have been too much.   I love how quick, easy and cheap it was.

excellent crust.  I eat gluten free, so I used half tapioca starch and half rice flour and added 1tsp of xanthum gum as well.

Excellent...read some reviews and added some more flavor to the dough.  Used 1 tsp Italian seasoning and 2 tsp Paula Dean's House Seasoning (in place of the plain salt)  I made 6 batches of this for a pizza slumber party...delicious!

Super easy and delicious! Made 4 crusts tonight in a taste test and this is #1 in my book. I probably let it rise 45  mins. Was easy to roll. Baked up perfectly! Will definitely add this to my weekly rotation! Want to add I rolled it really thin and it rose just enough. Not too thick, not too thin.

Good for a fast crust. But this does not have the same taste or texture as a crust that takes more time. Still, it is good for a fast one. Thanks!

Awesome pizza crust!!! It bakes so evenly and perfectly; I've never had to worry about an overdone bottom or an underdone center. My only note is that it rises fairly significantly as it bakes (I like a bready crust though), so don't be afraid to roll it out quite thin before you put your toppings on.

This is a great recipe that I've used several times.  I use garlic salt (instead of plain salt) to add a bit more flavor, and my partner and I both agree that this crust is the best for a quick pizza.

Very good crust, although a tad sticky each time I've made it.  I just dump the ingredients in my bread machine, and let it do all the mixing/kneading for me, then turn the machine off before the rise part of the cycle (since the recipe only calls for 5 minutes of rest time).  I always need to add a bit more flour in the kneading cycle, but no big deal.  We love this for our grilled pizza on the BBQ - leave it on a lightly greased pizza pan, place on grill over indirect medium coals, cover, and leave alone for a few minutes.  When it starts to bubble on top and firm up, I flip it off the pan directly onto the grill.  When the first side is golden, I pull it off again, put sauce and toppings on the browned side, then slide it back onto the grill to melt the cheese and brown the other side.  Absolutely to die for!!  I've never seen my kids eat so much pizza, and that says a lot!  LOL!

Was too nervous to place the toppings while the dough was not baked. I'm actually waiting to add the toppings when it's closer to dinner, with the pizza crust already spending some time in the oven (will definitely try it as recommended next time, with all the people's successes). Very easy to make. Had trouble with the dough not being ready to work with, so had to add just a touch of flour. Looks great and will definitely remember other people's advice over flavoring the crust or putting some herbs with olive oil before the rest of the toppings:) Thanks for the recipe!

My family loves this pizza crust and I love how easy and quick it is to make. I use whole wheat flour and I do bake it on pizza stones as the recipe suggests. I also use a brush olive oil along the edges of the crust, topped with a little garlic salt, before I bake it. Yum!

My husband and I have been using this as our go-to pizza crust recipe for about 2 years now. It is excellent and so easy! We've found that the pizza comes out best when baked on a hot pizza stone for about 18 minutes.  We sometimes spread a mixture of melted butter and garlic powder around the crust before baking. Yum!

Excelent EASY crust. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added some herbs and spices to my crust (oregano, rosemary, onion and garlic powder). Beats store bought any day.

We used to make pizza crust with frozen bread dough, but it's so hard to work with (not to mention a lot of stores don't even sell it!). We tried this recipe a few months ago and it has been wonderful! My husband won't let me go back to the frozen bread dough. It's so pliable and really hard to mess up! You can add all your favorite seasonings. We add garlic powder, oregano, and basil. We also coat the entire crust with garlic powder and olive oil. It's so good! And don't worry about "failing" at the yeast. I've used water that was not warm enough and the dough was fine. I just had to add a little more flour. The consistency was just fine though!

This is just as advertised.  Quick and tasty.  Has a nice texture.  I used beer for half of the liquid and that turned out great!  I hadn't made it with just water but it seems to have a nice yeasty taste this way.

This is a great base recipe... I added garlic powder, onion power, basil, and oregano to the olive oil.  I also used the same amount of olive oil and spices to brush over the edge of the crust before baking.  I cooked it on a pizza stone with a liberal amount of cornmeal and it turned out nice and chewy with a little bit of crunch!  Very quick and easy.

This recipe is quick and easy it really can be made in half an hour. I use it even when I am not in a hurry. To improve the flavor a easy thing to do is brush the rolled out dough with a mixture of olive oil, garlic and herbs before topping.

This is the only pizza crust I make. I've tried others with marginal success but this recipe actually makes a better tasting pizza than the restaurants. I actually cringe when someone mentions ordering pizza because I know that I can make it better at home. And that is saying something because I live in Chicago the Pizza Mecca!

It was already late, and I needed something quick: this was easy and helped me overcome my fear of yeast. Kudos to Chef Rider, and to all who have made this their own. I've got lots of ideas for next timie!

Crust can be very bland. Needs more salt or flavoring, or a strong sauce to pair it with.

the 1st time I ever made pizza crust other than dough packets.  was very good and easy to make.  I made it in my stand mixer,  and added italian season and garlic to the crust.  Gonna try adding ranch seasong to it next time.

This is my new pizza dough recipe!  I've been wanting to make my own rather than buy (health & cost reasons) and this is fantastic!  Super easy, fast, and tastes really good!  I did add about 2 tsp of pizza seasoning.

I love this quick and easy pizza crust! I add 1/2 tsp. black pepper, 1 tsp. dried Italian seasoning, and 1 tsp. garlic powder. It is simply delicious and very easy to roll out. I'm short on time and rarely have time or patience to wait for dough to rise. Perfect alternative.

Yum-o.  Making this all the time now!  So quick and easy and cheap!  Plus, I usually take some of the dough and make into breadsticks-- sprinkle with a little garlic salt!

This is the best pizza crust recipe I have ever tried!  My family loves pizza but I always dreaded how time consuming it was to make my own dough.  I double the recipe and now we have pizza night once a week!  The topping options are endless.  Thanks so much!!

This crust was great! It was quick and easy just like it says and easy to double too! The picky adults and kids were happy alike and it was great the next day cold just like from a pizza joint. I used to rely on the bread machine to make my crust but when it broke I was so happy to have this to fall back on!!! Thank you for a great versatile recipe I will use forever!

Absolutely wonderful!  I literally make this once a week for my family of 4.  It makes a VERY large pizza so I usually make a pizza from most of the crust and seperate off the bit extra to make breadsticks (dip in extra pizza sauce).  I also add flavorings to crust like Italian Seasoning, minced garlic, even a little Parmesan cheese.

This was really easy to make, so I liked it for that reason.  The flavor was okay, but not the best I've had.  However, I did use wheat flour for 1/3 of the flour so that may have made the flavor more bland.  I will try it exactly as written next time.

Consistently decent pizza dough with little fuss. I recommend adding a pinch of oregano, basil & garlic powder for a little more flavor.

Wow! I just tried this and it's fantastic! I can't wait for my husband to get home so he can have a slice. I have tried all the pre-mixed dough packets out there and they are always flat,non-tasty and hard to chew. YUK! I mixed this with my hands,& let it rise about 20 minutes,and I even cooked it in a toaster oven (my big oven is broken right now)...and it still turned out tasty and chewy and fluffy! I did add some Italian seasoning & a little onion powder & garlic powder to the dough before I mixed it up. Thank you SO much for sharing this with us! It's really great. No more take out for this couple! ;)

This simple crust went perfectly with the tuna melt pizza I concocted.  It's light enough and crunchy enough.  The crust isn't too dense of too chewy.  My girlfriend raved about this creation.  Only thing I did differently was to  some italian dry spices to my dough.  I allowed the dough to rise about 30 min. then worked dough into pizza form (building up edges for crust.  I baked using a cookie sheet, which worked out just fine.  I applied my topping about 10 min into the baking process.  I topped with basil pesto, perpared tuna salad mixture (to liking) and topped it off with cheddar cheese.  This was a BIG hit for just the 2 of us!

This is really good! I've never made a punch/rise dough but I don't feel the need to now. I should note that it makes a very thick doughy crust, which I like but some don't.  I give a hearty second to the suggestion another reviewer made to mix some italian seasoning with the olive oil before adding it to the mix. All-purpose flour works okay but I really think the bread flour is the way to go.

The crust can be a tad dry and the remedy I use is to rub a little olive oil over the crust and, if you're feeling particularly decadent (which I almost always am), sprinkle some parmesan cheese on it too. It adds a fantastic flavorful crisp and makes me glad Boyfriend doesn't like the corners as much!

I like this crust. It works. It just needs about two hours of rising time for best results.

This pizza dough is easy and tastes fantastic! I add in some parmesan and italian seasoning and I'll let it rise for 9 hours .

What a delicious time saver.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion to add 1/2 tsp. basil, 1/2 tsp. oregano, and 1/4 tsp. onion powder to the oil before adding it to the crust.  Although I thought that would be too much spice, it was perfect. My dough hook on my mixer mixed it all together perfectly and after letting it rest the 5 minutes, it rolled out beautifully. I also brushed the edge of the crust with olive oil before baking.  Since I had a commitment after rolling out the crust, I covered it and put it into the refrigerator for an hour before adding the toppings.  Worked out great.  Thanks submitter for this great and easy Pizza Crust recipe.

This IS the easiest and best crust I've made. Used it for pizza on the grill with friends and it was a BIG hit. Worked in cast iron, on a pizza pan and as a calzone wrapped in foil. AWESOME!

Fabulous!!!  I added a touch of italian seasoning, onion, and garlic powder for added flavor.  It was great.  The dough cooked evenly into a crust, even throughout a large pizza.  We also used a pizza pan, because we don't have a stone.

This pizza crust was ok. I made two pizzas, one was cheese the other white. The crust was a little too doughy. Will make again with some changes.

I went ahead and let this rise a couple times simply because I made it early in the day and had the time to do so.(rise=flavor) I added Italian spice mix and a touch of onion powder when I added the flour. It was good. Not as airy and bubble as I personally like but it baked up really crispy and golden. Nothing worse than a soggy bottom pizza and this was anything but. I would defiantly use this recipe again but my hunt for the perfect homemade crust continues.

This is a pretty good dough recipe.  Not super special but pretty darn good for something so simple.  Something I would make again.  However watch the cook time.  I did 15 mins like the directions said but the cheese on my pizza got very dark. I'd probably try less time next time.

We liked this. I used it for the bread machine, and did a slight pre-cook of the shaped crust before loading it with our favorite sauce and toppings and putting in for final bake. That hot oven browned the cheese, and made this thick crust done through and through. 5/15/10 Made again. This time by hand...used 1/2 cup wheat germ for 1/2 cup of the flour. DH actually requested that I make this one again, and he seemed satisfied with the tweak. Still gets thumbs up all the way.

I added dry Italian seasoning to dry ingredients and it rose in my warm oven for about 2 hours cause I wasn't ready yet. It was fantastic and everyone is raving. Made it in a 13X9 baking pan for thick crust. Baked it for about 5 min before toppings and sauce. Came out perfect. I will def use again!!! THANKS!!!

Quick and easy. I actually thought it had a good flavor (I brushed it with olive oil before baking).  The dough seemed to take a long time to bake, however.  The next time, I will bake the crust for at least 10 minutes before I put the toppings on.

AMAZING!!  We just had this last night.  I was in a hurry so was looking for a no rise recipe.  This was so amazing, I don't really have words.  Delicious!  I used half whole wheat flour and it was wonderful.  The crust didn't really brown, I put in on the bottom next to the flame for a few minutes at the end to crisp it up.  SO DELICIOUS!!!  And SOOOO EASY!!!  Thank you thank you!

So delicious! I was a little nervous about using all-purpose flour instead of bread flour, but it actually still turned out beautiful! Next time I will have to try it with bread flour and compare. This really was very quick and easy to make.  Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is finally THE ONE! I have made other recipes but the crust was not as crispy as I would like.  This crust was crispy and very easy to make.  Thank you for posting a great recipe that I will make over and over again!

This crust is super easy.  I split in half to make two thinner crusts and my family loved it.  I added some parmesan and herb seasoning to the crust while it was in the mixer and it was fabulous.  I cooked it at 425 and it turned out great.

My whole family loved this crust!  We didn't have much time to make our crust in the bread machine so I found this recipe.  My husband made it and it was perfect.  Golden brown on the bottom, crispy crust, and soft middle.  This one's a keeper for sure!

I just love this recipie! It's so quick and easy and it works if you don't have time for it to rise, or if you do have time. I usually start it when I decide I want pizza for dinner and by the time I have all the other ingredients ready it is ready to use. It's a great time saver!!

As written, this recipe was a usable pizza crust.  If you aren't too picky about your flavor and texture and need dough in a pinch, it's workable.  However, when I go to the effort of making pizza, I want it to taste fantastic and this was not it.  Admittedly, I've got very picky taste buds.  I am an experienced cook so I know it wasn't my skill that was lacking in this instance.  I look for my pizza crust to be light and airy but have enough structure to hold up the toppings.  This was more like eating bread dough rolled out under some toppings.  Pizza crust and bread dough aren't supposed to have the same texture and consistency.  I'll keep looking for my perfect recipe.

This crust really is quick and easy, and the end product has never been anything less than amazing!! I have made pizza from it, and it also works great for pepperoni bread. (just make the dough as directed, roll it out, top with pepperoni, 8oz mozzarella and italian seasoning, and pop it in the oven at 375 for 40 minutes)  The last time I made this I used the quick rising yeast and let the dough rise for about 40 minutes... it TRIPLED in size and the result was a THICK crust!! WOW!! it was amazing!! From now on I'll be doing it that way.

We use 50% whole wheat and 50% white flour for a healthier crust.   Our Kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook attachment makes mixing a breeze.

This was pretty good. I liked the fact that I could make it in a jiffy and without much effort. I did, however, add an extra sprinkling of salt, some garlic powder and a dash of Italian seasoning to the dough, hence the 4 stars. I also used AP flour since I don't have bread flour. I spread the dough out super thin since that's how I like my crust, and it baked up nice and crispy with a slight chewiness on the thicker parts. I will definitely make this again!

This is a good, easy basic crust. It made a medium crust pizza that completely filled my 15" diameter baking stone. OK, so it wasn't quite as yummy as delivery but it's probably healthier and definitely cheaper.

Easy. Made a great pizza at home faster than I could have gotten one delivered for practically nothing. I gave a slice to my toddler and he ate the crust, leaving the toppings, a pretty funny compliment. I will absolutely make this again.

This crust was very easy to make and held up well. I was especially impressed with how crispy it stayed -- even in the middle with lots of sauce and toppings. I added some herbs and garlic powder and also let it rise for about 20 minutes.

My husband and I really enjoyed the pizza.  I will add an addtl 1/4 c. bread flour next time as the dough was very sticky.  The middle of the dough was still soft after baking it with all the toppings so I would recommend to do a short prebake or lower the temp of the oven.  The cheese was getting a bit dark so I pulled it out of the oven.  I will definately use this recipe again...........still better than any pizza I've come across in this part of the country and as a New Yorker, I grew up on good pizza!!

THis is the best pizza crust I've made in 10 years!  I like a thicker crust and this delivers.  I've made this crust 4 times in the past week.  My husband agrees that this is the best homemade pizza crust we've had to date.

Wow! easy and fast.  Taste is yummy with added spice in batter, I used garlic bread mixings it was pretty decent.  Suggestion for toppings, shredded pork, hot cherry peppers, and mushrooms.  A little spicy but tasted better than a lot of the  they serve out there in public.  Kids loved making their own basic pies as well.

YUMMY crust!  I used Prego spaghetti sauce as my pizza sauce.  Very good!  Beats the pizza places here! :D  I will say that next time I'll try cooking this at a lower temp., as the crust didn't cook through as well as it should have.

Fantastic recipe that I will definitely make again.  However, will use at least 1/4 cu. more flour since I found the dough very sticky.   We like lots of toppings so we needed at least 10 minutes more of baking time to get a crisp crust.  My DH thought we should bake the crust first and then add the toppings and bake for another 15 minutes depending on topping.  We will try that next time!  All said, great taste and recipe will become a standard in my collection.

This made an ok pizza crust.  We added 1/2 teaspoon of basil and 1/4 teaspoon of onion powder to the dough.  The crust still did not have much flavor and was a VERY soft and doughy.  We prefer a more chewy crust and will keep searching...

Use this all the time!!  Even make pizza on the grill with this recipe.  But be sure to use bread flour NOT all-purpose!  The last time I added parm cheese and italian seasoning and mixed it in.  It was very good too.

This was so easy to make, although I did have a hard time shaping the dough but thats my fault. I made breadsticks too but they were a little bland. The crust is great with the pizza toppings with it but it could use a little something etxra. Overall great recipe, I look forward to using it again and again.

Good. A bit dense, but for the simplicity, well worth it. You can't really beat the ease and the taste is great. Definitely not buying pre-made crust ever again!

This is an AWESOME crust. I made it for my buffalo wing inspired pizza. The crust was so fast and easy. No additional flavorings needed. I was impressed how it stood up to all my heavy toppings. I was also able to stuff my crust. It rolls out really easy. I will use this over and over.

I pulled up this recipe in an emergency: I had 50 minutes to get a pizza ready from scrath. The recipe was simple, fast, and the dough was easy to work with. It was not the best crust I've ever had, but it was good. We'll be using this recipe again!

I love this recipe! The crust turned out great, the dough was easy to handle and best of all, it was all ready to eat in 30 minutes! Thank you for posting this recipe, this will be my go-to recipe for pizza crust from now on. I had some extra dough left so I made a calzone, turned out great too!

This crust is so yummy. The first time I made it, I made a big batch of it and just separated it to make personal pizzas for a party I was throwing, but I've made it just the normal way twice since then and all 3 times I've just loved it. It comes out soft and fluffy and it's so easy to make. I'll definfitely keep making it again and again.

I am NOT good with yeast, so I was a little nervous. This ended up being very easy and VERY yummy!  As others suggested, I added Italian seasoning to the dough and mixed it in. I will definitely hang on to this recipe!

I really like how fast and easy this pizza crust was to make. I made a Hawaiian style 16 in pizza. I would cook it for about 5-10 minutes extra to give it a less doughy taste. Very tasty and not too thick.

This has to be the best pizza recipe I've tried... and I've tried a lot! I used all purpose flour because it's what I had here, and I added a little Italian seasoning to it, and it turned out delicious!! This is my new "go to" recipe.

Awesome and easy, pretty much a no-fail recipe.  Excellent to make stuffed crust with too....just line the edge of the pizza crust (once on pizza tray) with cheese and fold over, sealing in the cheese.

followed other peoples` instructions and added the following: 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp onion powder (this goes into olive oil before adding to batter) as well as the garlic powder/olive oil brushed on just before adding toppings. I also let the dough stand about 1/2 hour in the fridge, which was apparently way too long--the bread turned out spongey. But I guess that was my fault! I`ll make it again, but next time I`ll only let it sit for 10-15 min.

If I'd known earlier how easy it was to make, I'd have started making pizza at home for my grandchildren long ago.  Tasty crust, easy to make, can't ask for much more.

I usually use Hot Roll Mix for my pizza crust.  When I ran out, I searched this site for an easy alternative and I found it!  This crust tastes exactly like the hot roll mix.  It comes out fairly thick for me (the way my family likes it)because I roll it out in a 10x15 pan.

Is the crust supposed to be thin or thick??I love the taste of the crust and it is very easy to make but by the picture I thought it would be thicker. Mine came out very thin.I thought the dough would rise some in the oven but it didn't.I will make this again but maybe I just rolled out to thin.

awesome!it was so quick,easy,and tasty. I didnt even need my blender. the biggest challenge for pizza night is timing. with my other recipe planning a couple hours ahead is a must.  i used a little wheat flour and it was great. pizza always makes for a great end of the week  or in my case end of the month dinner idea.  i like to use leftovers as toppings. last night we had baked pepperoni ziti pizza. this recipe definitely makes last minute pizza night so much easier.

This is the first time I've made my own pizza crust. I can't believe how fast and easy this was to make! I will be making this many, many more times. I baked it on the bottom rack of the oven so the crust would be nice and crispy.

I was amazed how quickly I had this done.  When ready to shape the dough onto the pizza pan, I took flour between forefingers and thumb and quickly shaped the dough to the pan.  It worked so well. It's in the oven now, my husband dressed his pizza to his liking, and I to mine.

My family and I LOVE this recipe! My mom thinks it's better than pizzeria crust. The only thing I do differently is to divide it into 3-4 personal pizzas and then grill them. The dough is usually extremely sticky, though, so you have to be sure to use lots of flour when rolling it out. I love how quick this recipe is without sacrificing taste!

I've tried several different pizza crust recipes, and this one is by far the easiest, AND the yummiest! My 4 1/2 year old daughter helped me make it, and we had the greatest time...I did use the bread flour instead of regular flour, and it really made a difference w/ texture - MUCH better w/ the bread flour!

Wow, this was really easy and so good!  I've used pre-made crusts before (like Trader Joe's dough) and have had trouble with them cooking all the way through before the toppings burned.  No issue with this one. I let it rise for about 10 minutes while I prepared toppings and grated cheese.  It was REALLY easy to spread the dough to the edges of my pizza pan, and it cooked up perfectly chewy/crisp.  I used pesto sauce, fresh tomatoes, black olives, and mozzarella cheese.  YUMMY!

Thank you! Love this quick and delicious dough.  It made enough dough for two thin crust pizzas or one thicker crust.  I added a tsp of Italian Seasoning and 1 tsp of oregano to the dough and mixed with a wooden spoon.

Fabulous pizza crust! I honestly wasn't expecting it to turn out as well as it did. I made it using the Chicken Avacado Pizza recipe also on this site and it turned out great.   Added some garlic salt and oregano, like a few other people have mentioned. Perfect!

Excellent flavor for such an easy and quick recipe.  Made into a large crust for our huge cookie sheet.  On the advice of other reviewers: mixed by hand; added 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp oregano and 1/4 tsp onion powder to the olive oil before mixing into the flour/yeast.  Let rest 15-20 minutes.  Great flavor and cooked up fine in 20 minutes. Thanks for sharing

this is a very good pizza dough.instead of 2 and 1/2 cups of white flour I put 1 and 1/2 cups of white flour and 1 cup of kamut flour.This makes a very tasty crust,but the dough is very soft and a bit hard to handle.But the taste of the crust is worth the trouble.

My brother and I essentially live off this. We make it about every second day. It's so easy to make and it turns out beautifully every time. I honestly enjoy the pizza we make at home more than any pizza place's. I only wish there was a whole wheat equivalent!

Agreed with another poster that adding a bit of herbs and or seasoning makes it even better. This crust has made Friday night pizza a weekly tradition in our house!

Terrific and tasty crust. I was in the mood for cheese pizza and didn't want to wait for the crust to rise - I also didn't want to clean up a lot of dishes :) So I whipped up this crust following the recipe, but replacing white sugar with brown and adding onion powder, garlic powder and mrs. dash seasoning to taste. Baked on a pizza stone for 15 mins at 400 degrees and the result was a crunchy bottom crust with a surprisingly soft center. It didn't rise as high as Jay's Crust (also on this site) but it came pretty close.

This was quick and easy, as well as tasty.  I did add 2 tsp. Italian seasoning and 1 tsp. garlic powder.  I may add a little whole wheat flour next time.  UPDATE: I tried this 1 c. whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 c. bread flour with great results.  I don't think I'd add any more wheat flour, as I'm afraid any more would

This is a very easy and yummy pizza crust! I did have to add extra flour as my dough was very sticky. I used some whole wheat flour in my dough as well, and next time I make it, I will probably add more, as no one even noticed. Thanks for sharing such and easy and tasty recipe!

Great recipe! I've never been satisfied with homemade pizza crusts until this recipe.  Like other reviewers I added Italian seasoning and onion powder to the olive oil before mixing in.  I let the dough sit for 20 minutes and brushed with olive oil after rolling out.  I baked the crust for 5 minutes before adding the toppings. Truly quick and easy and a big hit with my family.

My recipe books are all packed since we are moving and I was happy to find on here that is the exact one I have been using for the past 15 years.  Definitely a staple at our house.  I make it first and let it sit for 5 minutes while I get out all the toppings.    It is fabulous to use for grilled pizza, as well.  I also like to make extra so we can grill the left-over dough and eat it with "dipping" oil/seasonings.    This dough is very forgiving and great to add spices to.  You can use it as a great jumping off point for many uses.  Thanks for posting this here!

This was a wonderful fast option. To make a little healthier I subbed 1/2 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup spelt for 1 cup of reg flour. Very tasty...will make again.

Super easy. Adding herbs to the crust gives a lot of flavor as others recommended. Next time will let the dough rest before baking so it gets a little lighter.

Definitely as the title says, quick and easy pizza crust.  This recipe was enjoyed by everyone that ate the pizza that night.  Will be using this one again and again.  Some had suggested doing butter and parmesan cheese, or other flavorings on the crust.  I may try that next time, but it was yummy all the same.

This was a good recipe if you are pressed for time. I am more of a fan of a crust that rises. I added the herbs and the crust had great flavor. I will try this recipe again and allow the dough to rise and see if I get a better texture to the crust.

My family actually likes this recipe the best of all pizza crusts I have tried. They like that it gets crisp on the bottom, even if baked on a cookie sheet.   I usually add some seasoning to the crust, such as garlic powder, Parmesan cheese, and sometimes some Italian seasoning.   It is very good, no complaints from me and it is ready FAST!

True to its name!  But I would also add tasty!  I used this crust to make "Chicago-Style Pan Pizza" from this site and it was one of the best I've ever had!

Great crust recipe!!!  loved it!  It was super easy and delicious!  I found it helpful to parbake the crust for about 5 minutes before adding the toppings.  It helped the crust cook all the way through without overcooking the cheese!  Thanks!

GREAT SUCCESS!!  I didn't have the bread flour it called for, but it turns out the same when you use all purpose flour and a tablespoon of wheat gluten.  It had great texture and was most certainly effortless!! KUDOS!

Who knew pizza crust could be so easy? I didn't have bread flour so I used all-purpose and it came out very light and delicious. I made my pizza a sicilian style and topped it with ground sausage, mushrooms and green peppers. I also used a thick home-made sauce. 2 cups of shredded cheese were enough and 20 mins later.. yummy home-made pizza! Will definitely make this one again. Very easy!

This crust was passable, but too hard and chewy.  I think in order to get a genuinely good crust you need to let it rise.

This has changed our pizza eating forever! I have never been so impressed with a recipe as I am with this one. It not only makes great pizza crust (I like to add spices as other viewers suggested) but it also is versatile, making great breadsticks as well! Love, love, love it!

Best quick pizza dough recipe I have come across!  I usually make whole wheat pizza dough, but didn't have the 2 hours required to make it - found this recipe and it's definitely a keeper to use when crunched for time!  Cooked this for 10 minutes on a pizza pan, and 8 minutes on my stone - came out perfect with a crunchy crust my family loves!  Thanks for posting this recipe!!

I think this might work better to cook the crust for a bit before adding toppings. I will keep working with this recipe. I liked how quick it was for Friday night pizza. I will also try to add garlic to the curst next time too.

Very easy and great results.  We will use this often! Edit: Made this again this week, having my parents over for dinner and they raved that it was the best pizza crust they'd ever had!  I'm on my way to email the recipe to my mom now.  Thanks again for a great recipe!

Excellent!  It's a perminent Friday Pizza Day recipe.  I like to put various things in the crust to change it up.  Very easy and yummy.

WOW!  Quick and Easy and makes everyone in my house happy - at the same time!  I add a little garlic powder and oregano and it's perfect!  Roll it thin for a crispy crust or leave it thick for a fluffy crust - it's a great recipe - and so simple!  Thanks!

My husband and I wanted pizza but didn't want to shell out all the money from a restuarant.  This crust is better than a restuarant.  It was so quick...took about 15 minutes to make.  It didn't rise alot but that could be my water temp..it tasted so good..not yeasty at all.  I added parmesan and oregano to the dough and sprinkled the bottom of the pan with corn meal.  I rolled it out on the pizza pan...so no mess.

This recipe makes homemade pizza possible even on a worknight. The dough was not as pliable as other pizza doughs I've made, but with a bit of work I got 2 8 inch crusts from it. It baked up beautifully in the oven and made the slightly chewy crust my family prefers. I may follow other reviewers and add some herbs to the crust next time. Many Thanks.

I have made this 8 times so far. It's really great. I roll it out really thin and poke holes in it with a fork. I like thin crust. I put cornmeal down on my pan underneath crust - tastes great! I have used this for large pizzas and individuals. I get three individual crusts out of one recipe.

This was good and SO EASY! But I must've written it down wrong cause I wrote 1TB (not 1TS) of sugar, but it came out great anyway. I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar with instant yeast and warm water in a bowl til foamy (about 10 mins) added the salt, evoo and ap flour and kneaded by hand maybe 2 mins. We used 2/3 of the dough for 2 personal hawaiian pizzas, topped raw dough and baked apx 17m. The middle was a little soft, but still quite good. Refrigerated the remaining 1/3 dough in a ziploc overnight (kept just fine) and used for a breakfast pizza, this time pre-baked dough 10m and it was perfect. Topped with hollandaise, lightly sauteed onion, red pepper, mushrooms, then scrambled eggs, canadian bacon and cheddar and baked add'l 15m. Sooo good! One thing though, press or roll it really thin, as thin as you can without making holes, or it'd be too bready once baked cause it did rise up a bit in the oven. And definately pre-bake the crust 10m before topping. I actually think this is better than the more time consuming recipe on this site with like 1000+ good reviews!

I'd never made a pizza crust before today and this was SO easy and SO YUMMY!  I doubled the recipe and used half unbleached regular white flour & half whole wheat flour & it worked great! The picky eater kid even liked it!  I was so excited I took pictures! http://www.flickr.com/photos/wmshc_kiwitayro/sets/72157614359067247/

My picky boyfriend really enjoyed this crust (we also added pizza spice). Made two smaller pizzas, his with just olive oil and sea salt, and mine a NY white pizza. Cooked smaller pizzas for 15 minutes each on a pizza stone and we were happy!

I personally found this crust yummy, but not chewy, more of a chruchy tast.  The crust edges puffed up really well, but overall it was a really crunchy taste.  I'm going to continue on my quest for a really chewy crust.

I subbed 1/2 the flour with whole wheat to make it healthier. Also added flax seed. I halved the recipe since I was just cooking for two and it came out great. Loved the texture, could have cooked it a little longer. I think next time I will bake the crust by itself for 3-4 minutes and THEN add the toppings so that the crust has more of a crunch and the cheese won't burn. Overall, it was great.

This is ok, but only because the short prep time sort-of makes up for the taste.  It's really quite blah:  Dense, and not much flavor.  But ok, it doesn't take any time at all.  I was desperate, so thanks for a quick recipe.

It really is quick and easy. I added herbs to the flour and it was very tasty. I used to use a bread-machine dough that was too elastic to get nice and thin. This recipe is easy to work with because the minimal kneading means not much gltuen gets worked up. This is my new pizza dough!

I followed other suggestions to add herbs to the dough and it was pretty good.  I don't have pizza pans so I used a 13x9 pan and I had more dough than needed.  Next time I will see if I can make 2 thin crusts.

I really like this recipe. Adding the olive oil to the dough gives it a nice flavor though I doubled the salt to punch it up a bit.   Once I rolled the dough out I also brushed it with more olive oil, and than drizzled a little bit of honey over it before adding the other sauce and toppings. (Topping the crust with honey was very typical where I lived in Spain.)   I also cooked it on a pizza stone so it came out nice and fluffy.   Very good recipe!!!

Easy and turns out great.  Perfect size for a large pizza too.  I substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour to give it a little fiber.  Turned out great.

This was really easy to make.  I did put a little italian seasoning into the dough.  I think next time I will cook the pizza crust for about 10 minutes before I put the toppings on.  I will make this again for sure.

This is my "go-to" crust recipe because it is so quick and easy to make. I usually use whole wheat flour to make it healthy and soooo delicious! My family members keep asking me for this recipe because it has become that popular with us!! This is by far the best crust recipe you will find.

I love this recipe! I know the crust could be better if more time was taken, etc. but in our household we don't have tons of extra time and we really like pizza. To meet the demand for pizza in the past, I've just bought high quality cheese pizzas from the grocery store and topped them myself before baking. This quick and easy recipe allows me to pop a pizza in the oven in no time and make it 100% fresh. I also add whole wheat bread flower to my pizza, so it is way healthier than a regular frozen pizza. Thanks for the recipe!!

Great recipe.  Wondered about the sugar, but was good, not overwhelmingly sweet at all.  I've never liked homemade crust that I've made, but this one was really good.

I really like this crust!  Not too thick and not too thin.  It also does NOT have a strong yeasty taste.  I never really cared for homemade pizza because the crust that my grandmother uses has a strong yeasty flavour. This crust has lead me into the light :)  A+

This gets 4 stars just for being easy. I would only give it a 3 for taste, but if you're in a hurry to feed a few people this is a very acceptable crust. Husband really liked it and I thought it was fine.

I'm not a big fan of premade pizza crusts so when my 14 year old nephew wanted to make "personal" pizzas, I had him try out this recipe.  It turned out awesome!  5 people made their own, thin, thick, chewy, or crispy pizzas.  Even my 2 & 6 year old's turned out great!  Very workable and it tasted great...thanks for this easy recipe!!

This recipe is so easy to make! The texture and taste makes it a perfect pizza dough. I didn't notice the lack of flavor that was mentioned in previous reviews but then, I loaded it up with hamburger, cheese, tomatoes, bell pepper, jalapeno and banana peppers. YUM! So maybe that made the difference. Anyway, deffinitely adding this to my counter recipe box!

Truly quick and easy!  I usually double the recipe, and even if I let it sit longer and raise a little it is still great.  I do often have to add a little more flour - maybe my flour, the weather, etc.

This was perfect! So glad you don't have to wait for it to rise. I used my stand mixer and it came together so quick. The texture was perfect- soft but crunchy too.Got rave reviews from kids and hubby. Thanks!

It didn't have a lot of taste, but it was a pretty good base.  Maybe adding a little more salt and some italian seasoning mix would help with that. Overall, pretty good, and I would use it again.

I baked the crust for 5 minutes like another reviewer suggested, and then I brushed oil on the outer crust and added toppings and baked until the cheese was golden. It was pretty good!

The recipe makes crust with a nice texture, AND it is easy to work with and makes a good sized crust. Many recipes I've tried are hard to stretch and don't make quite enough. I agree with another reviewwer that it's a bit bland, but you can add things to it to make with more flavor to suit your family's taste. I also bake the crust at 450 degrees for about 5 minutes BEFORE topping it, then top it and bake about 8-10 minutes more, depending on the toppings.

Lightening fast, so easy, and tastes very good.  Can you make a better crust by exerting more time and effort?  Yes.  BUT for a FAST crust, this is the best one!

This is a great pizza dough recipe!  It is really fast and works pretty good.  I also made some of the dough and used it for scones.  The scones were just as good, and I didn't have to wait for them to rise.

This was a great recipe, with a couple of additions: I added some onion power, oregano and garlic power to the dough while mixing it.  I then topped it with some leftover homemade bolognese sauce instead of pizza sauce.  It was definitely the best pizza I've made at home.

Great recipe! I love pizza I don't have to wait that long for :) I added some garlic powder to the dough for a little extra flavor. I tried this recipe because I hate waiting for pizza dough to rise and also because dough with yeast makes me sneeze.

It's good. I made this recipe because I was short on time. I doubled the recipe, made two pizzas (baked the crust for a few minutes before topping) - and I also added a little oregano to the dough. The dough was very easy to work with. I'll certainly make this again because it's just so darn easy - but if I have the time, then I will stick with my regular pizza crust that has to rise - this recipe is pretty good when your in a pinch for time or just want something fast.

This was my "first" pizza crust using yeast and it was very easy!  I made the Buffalo Chicken Pizza from this site and found the middle of the pizza to be either soggy or undercooked.  I did pre-bake the crust 10 minutes, then baked it 10 more minutes with the topping.  Maybe I had too much sauce???  At any rate, will definitely use this recipe again.

I really loved how easy this crust was to make. I mixed all the ingredients with my hands once it was time to add the flour. My hubby and I put it on a rectangle baking sheet with some flour on the pan, then spread the dough out into a rectangle not completely covering the whole pan but most of it and then we put it in the oven for about 5 mins. It rose a bit high but I flattened it down with a spatula before adding the toppings. We also put some olive oil on the crust. I was worried about it cooking too slow in conjunction with the toppings but it came out PERFECT. I'll be making this again, definitely!

I kneaded the dough for about 15 minutes before letting it rise for around 10-15 minutes. I recommend turning the oven higher, I cooked mine at around 500 degrees F. The dough was really good and the pizza turned out crispy and delicious.

Exactly what it says and a good one at that. Great texture, easy to make and quick work for that last minute homemade pizza. I added a butter and garlic salt spread to the edges for some flavor. =)

This is such a great recipe if you don't want to spend a long time making dough. I suggest pre-baking it for about 7 minutes before you add sauce and toppings-- maybe that's just because I live at a high altitude, but otherwise it's too doughy.

Really great pizza crust! This was my first time making pizza and it was GREAT! My husband loved it! This is so easy and quick, just like it says. Thank you!
*UPDATE*6/10 I still use this recipe EVERY TIME I make pizza. Which is usually 2-3 times a week. We love this recipe and it has never failed me! I am going to try it for breadsticks soon.

PErfect for my lifestyle - very quick with little prep time needed.  I put it in a small Jelly roll pan and it was a thicker crust.  I added a little parm to the dough and it was good too.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

This recipe was pretty good.  Definitely very easy, and quick!  The only things I would note are that I had to add almost a half cup of flour to get the right consistency, I added some chopped garlic and pizza seasoning to the crust, and I wouldn't bake it for 15 minutes.  It might be because I only put cheese on mine, but it was already overdone after 13 minutes (good thing I checked it!).

This crust is delicious, and super easy!  I never made my own crust before, but homemade pizza is now a weekly dish.  I use a pizza stone + sprinkle a bit of corn meal on it to prevent sticking.

Success! Followed the recipe through since I usually have had bad cooking experience when it comes to using yeast. My hubby loved it. As with the other raters I used spices to make the crust more interesting. I will use this for our next dinner on the grounds for my local church, we're having Italian!

I have officially thrown away all the other recipes I have for pizza dough because - THIS ONE IS A KEEPER. the recipe comes together very quickly and tastes amazing everytime. I always let it rise for at least 20 minutes-its easier to work with if you do this.

I saw a buffalo chicken pizza recipe on here and decided I just had to make it.  I hate pre-packaged pizza crusts, so I started looking for an easy pizza crust recipe.  I found this one right away and I'm so glad!  Not only is it SUPER easy, it's also yummy!  I used a touch more flour than listed, but I really doubt I needed to... it just seemed a little sticky, but I think it really was fine.  I layed it out and cooked it on my Pizzazz and it was great!  Try this one!!

I use this recipe all of the time.  Sometimes I add a little Italian seasoning to the crust but it's fine without the extra additions.  Try a pesto grilled chicken pizza with sun dried tomatoes or bar-b-q chicken pizza with corn...YUMM!  Can't get that at most pizza places. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this tonight for three different pizzas and every one turned out fantastic!  The first was simple pepperoni & cheese for the kids and it was completely gone.  I also made this as a deep dish pizza in a stoneware pie baker with the "exquisite pizza sauce" from this site and it was my favorite.  Last I made a chicken, spinach and gorgonzola white pizza that was also completely eaten.  Like others recommended I baked the crust for a few minutes without the toppings (the deep dish for 10 minutes, the others for 7.)  I made two batches of the dough and it made all three pizzas.

***UPDATE!  This is a never fail crust for me!  I always add 1 tbsp of sugar to it, and always add some Italian Herb seasoning and parm cheese to the flour before mixing.  the longer you let it rise the softer the crust will be.  And I do still prebake the rust before adding the toppings.

This is awesome!  For my first time making this, it turned out beautifully.  I did add an extra 1 1/2 tsp of sugar, but I doubled the recipe.  I also added some parm cheese, and italian seasoning to the crust before baking it.  Out of the doubled recipe I was able to make 2 individual sized pizza for the kids, and 2 cookie sized (a little thinner crusted) pans.  The bigger ones, I baked the crusts for a few minutes before adding the toppings.  A big hit here...will be making it again!!

I have tried this recipe a few times and each time have had a little trouble getting the crust cooked enough without burning the toppings.  I think the trick is to roll it out as thin as possible and bake on the bottom rack.

This is a great base recipe! I also add garlic, basil, and more salt to add more flavor. Do use the bread flour as the recipe states- it does make a difference! Thanks for a great recipe!

Definitely a recipe to use when you are in a pinch.  The crust came out a little too bland for me though, so I'm not sure how often I'll use it.

I love this recipe the only good pizza crust I have come across yet. I use it from pizza to pepperoni rolls and Stromboli. I follow some other reviews and add in some basil, parsley, and garlic. I also let it rise an extra 45 min. Makes a great flavorful, fluffy crust. Thank you for this recipe, I was close to giving up on homemade pizzas.

Wonderful! I loved the taste. My hubby said  that he was "very impressed with the crust". He doesn't really get excited about anything home baked, so you know it had to be good! I plan to use this as "my" pizza crust recipe.

I've always been afraid of making homemade bread/pizza dough, until I joined this site!

I started out with this before I branched out to something a little more complicated. This was super easy and pretty much foolproof. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer which helped. (I sure am loving that I have an excuse to use it as much as possible!)

I used half for my kids' basic pepperoni
and the other half for a Blue Cheese Appetizer Pizza I found on this site. Both turned out great and I couldn't be happier. I won't spend $2 on Papa Murphy's pre-made dough anymore.

This was really yummy pizza dough. We doubled it to make 2 full size pizza's, each yeilding 8 slices. Daniel added chopped up basil, itallian spices and a few others I'm sure. : ) It was delicious, and especially good when cooked on the pizza stone.

This was awesome crust.  Easy to mix up in my kitchenaid mixer and very easy to handle.  Let it set for a few minutes before putting on toppings and it rose into a nice puffy crust in the oven.  Thank you for this great recipe.

This worked great for me.  I made it in my kitchen aid and left the dough in there covered, until i was ready to use it.  (about an hour) My pizza stone was perfect for this.

This recipes is awesome and so very easy.  I took another reviewers advice and mixed italian seasonings with olive oil (I use more like 3-4 Tablespoon) before mixing in with the rest of the dough.  

I have also done variations using whole wheat flour and mixed honey and italian seasonings with the olive oil.  This turned out awesome as well, gives a healthier crust with a sweeter twist!

What a great easy recipe!!  And tastes great.  We used a 12" round pizza pan.  Next time we will make 2 pizzas out of this recipe just becuase we prefer a thinner crust.

I felt like this dough had very little flavor and a really heavy texture.  I was hoping for a soft thick style crust.  I've had good luck with other dough recipes, this one was just ok.

Ive modified this recipe by increasing the salt to a tablespoon and adding a little extra olive oil. I use the rapid rise yeast and add about 1 tablespoon of italian herbs. After the dough rises for about a half hour, i halve it and make 2 thin crust pizzas. Delish! Im glad we finally started making our own crust! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I would give this a 5 for quickness & easiness and a 4 for everything else. I added some herbs to the dough as I'd seen other reviewers had done and I think next time I may add even more.  I'm happy to have a quick home-made pizza dough recipe - I will definetly be making this again and playing around with ingredients and toppings.

This was a great recipe! I've made it twice, and will make it again. It turned out awesome for being so quick and easy. It baked well and was the perfect crust. I topped it with sauce, mozzarella & parmesan cheese and fresh garlic.

So quick!  The way pizza should be.  I usually use frozen dough from the grocery store, but this came out with a far crisper bottom than that does, even when cooked on our pizza stone.  Also it was great to be able to use whole grains (I used half whole wheat flour, half kamut flour).  Worked out fabulous.  I added about 1/2 t of italian seasoning and about 1/4 c romano to it.  For my taste,  the dough was a tad sweet, so I will add just a bit more salt or cheese next time.

GREAT! I love how quick this is to make and it is very good. If you prefer thinner crust, you may not like this as well, however. It turned out very bread-like for me, and the dough was springy enough that I couldn't press it thinly into the pan, it just sprung back. It's not a heavy or greasy crust though, so it was good.

Added 1 tsp ground garlic and 0.5 tsp "italian seasoning" to the oil.  It was fantastic.

Good basic recipe. Just as the title suggests its quick and easy. I make this whenever I am making pizza. Sometimes I add  herbs or cheese right in the crust for extra flavor.

Good basic recipe.  Easy to make.  Ijust feel like it may be lacking somethingin flavor.  Try mixing herbs in with the dough.

This was a great crust! My fiancé and I used this for two pizzas, and both of us and his family agreed the crust was fantastic. We also read Robin's review, and tried adding herbs to the crust of the second pizza, which was also great.
Will definitely use this again!

This was the first time I'd ever made a pizza crust from scratch, and it was excellent. I took the advice of some other reviwers and added some spices, let it rise for about 45 minutes, and then brushed it with olive oil before baking. This will be the only recipe I use for pizza crust. I used all purpose flour, and it worked perfectly. One reviewer said s/he ended up with "gooey" batter, but I don't see how that's possible. I initially thought mine might be too dry and was tempted to add a bit of water, but I kneaded it with my hands for about 5 minutes, and it ended up being the *perfect* consistency. I'm wondering if the reviewer who ended up with gooey batter sifted the flour, which would cause him/her to end up with less flour than there should be... Also, mine cooked perfectly done in 15-20 minutes, so I'm not sure how people are ending up with uncooked crust either unless they haven't spread out the dough enough to resemble a pizza. Mine was spread out on my pizza stone to be the size of a large pizza (and it still ended up being a thick crust once it cooked.)

Perfect 'as is,' no changes. Works just fine with all purpose flour, without a pizza stone, with or without additions like herbs/spices, and with or without rising first. This is the recipe we use all the time for regular pizza and Chicago style.

This has become my standby pizza crust - we have homemade pizza every Saturday night, made with this crust.  The bread flour makes a BIG difference in the outcome, so be sure to use it if you can.   I've made it with both bread and AP flours, and the bread flour crust comes out with a texture similar to restaurant pizza.  I usually make it an hour or so ahead and let it rise, but it works just fine without that step.  Very good, very easy.

This was an amazingly easy pizza crust.. I didn't have the typical packet quick activating yeast but I did have some quick rise bread machine yeast.. used it and it worked wonderful. I made my own pizza sauce. Will be using this recipe again!!!

This recipe was a great find! It tastes just about as good as a typical homemade crust...without the wait for rising and kneading! Hooray! So now I can decide to make this for dinner and it's done in no time. I have used all purpose flour and half wheat flour. A couple of times I made breadsticks instead: sprinkled the dough with garlic salt, a bit of olive oil, and parmesan cheese before baking. Cut into strips. Yum. Thank you so much for this recipe that fits right in to a busy life.

What a spectacular recipe for pizza dough. I followed the recipe exactly, and man.. what a pizza! As a transplanted New Yorker living in Texas, I've been searching for an acceptable takeout/restaurant pizza here, and it hasn't happened. I will be making this many, many more times.
One note- it's kinda important to mix the sugar with the water, then sprinkle the yeast over the top for an even coating. And if the water is too cool or too warm, it won't activate the yeast.

I double the recipe when I make it and freeze half the dough for another day.  I bake it without toppings on top of corn mealed stone for 10 minutes before adding the toppings and baking for another 10 minutes.  From start to finish it takes about an hour.  I also found I need to roll it really thin because it does rise a lot in the over.  So a really thin crust does not come out thin but the normal thickness of pizza.  I also found I needed to knead it for a little longer than suggested.  Not much longer, but until the dough was smooth in texture.

Worked great! Didn't rise as much as I would have liked (only let it proof about 15 minutes). Next time I'll let it go a little longer. Otherwise, it's easy and the flavor is there!

I just love how fast this is ready!  I make  pizza all the time now.  I just use regular flour.  Also, I use a big dollop of molasses instead of white sugar.  The molasses gives it a better flavor and color.  I think with sugar or honey it ends up tasting like funnel cake, which I don't like.

Next time for more flavor, I would brush edge of crust with olive oil and sprinkle with garlic salt, parmesan cheese, and italian herbs before baking. Otherwise, super easy recipe that reminded me of the quick pizza crust mixes from the store.

this is a great crust. i brush olive oil and garlic salt over the crust before and halfway through baking. also, the crust tends to puff up a lot so i try to only leave a little dough uncovered. thanks for the tasty, timely and user-friendly recipe.

I've been making pizza at home for 13 years-- since I was eleven. I've always been lazy, and made the dough from a mix-- but today, I discovered I was out, starving, and desperately in the mood for pizza! This was the fastest recipe I found. Time was of the essence!
I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I added a small amount of extra flour (I was using all purpose) because the dough was more sticky and thin than I was accustomed to with the mixes (to which I also normally add more flour).  I also added oregano, basil, garlic powder and onion powder to the mix with the flour (I didn't measure, but around 1/4-1/2 of a teaspoon each).  The dough smelled incredible.
I don't pre-spread the dough, just spread in a pre-greased pizza pan.  The dough was still quite sticky, so I put a little olive oil on my hands to spread it, which worked fabulously! 
I used my normal cheese blend and put jalepenoes and turkey pepperoni on top-- it was so good that my parents ate half the pizza, which was supposed to be my work food for tomorrow!  Oh well, a definite, delicious success!  Highly recommend!

I made this for my family a few nights ago.  They said it was the best homemade crust they had ever eaten.  It was very good, but it didn't seem to have that chewy texture that I really enjoy.  All in all, I would use this recipe again.

This was the first time I have ever attempted to even 'think' about making a pizza crust.  This one sounded so simple, so I gave it a shot.  It was really pretty good.  It rolled out very nicely, and since we like more of a thin crusted pizza I rolled it on the thin side, and cooked it in a cookie sheet that has raised edges.  I made one of the chicken ranch pizza recipes with this..and it turned out really tasty!

Thanks for the easy pizza crust recipe...I impressed the heck out of my husband! :)

I love this recipe.  I've used it several times - always with all-purpose flour.  I do add my seasonings (garlic powder, oregano, basil) with my flour and let it proof for about a half hour.  I've even doubled the recipe with no problems.  This is very tastey and light and fluffy.  Or you can roll it out to make a large, thin crust pizza.  Thanks for ending my quest for a wonderful homemade pizza crust!

I couldn't believe how good this was, considering how quickly it went together. I added some garlic powder and some basil to the dough. I spread it with jarred pasta sauce and topped it with slices of ham, pineapple tidbits and mozzarella cheese. Didn't take much longer to cook than a frozen pizza, but tasted sooo much better!

This seemed to be doing well until I baked it on my pizza stone.  The crust was a bit too hard on the bottom - think crispy crust. I probably won't make this again. :-/

I am so glad to have found this recipe! This is so quick and easy, and so much better than ready-made pizza dough at the store. I followed the directions exactly except for using all-purpose flour instead of bread flour. The only thing I would do different would be too roll the crust out thinner next time; it rose more than I expected and was a bit too thick.

This was so easy and delicious!! I let the dough sit for about 30 min, instead of the 5 in the recipe. I also added a few seasonings to the dough and brushed it with an olive oil and garlic powder combo. Wonderful!

Turned out to be very thick, thicker than bobili when I shaped into a 12" pizza.  Next time I will make larger.  The crust had great texture.

This is the best and easiest pizza crust recipie!  I've always been hesitant to make homeade pizza crust because of the time it takes.  This was so easy and my daughter had so much fun making it with me.  The crust turned out soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside; it was perfect..

This pizza crust recipe was exactly what I was looking for!  I was craving pizza, and I needed a recipe for a yummy pizza crust, but I didn't want to take hours making it.  I was able to make this home-made pizza crust in just a few minutes.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, allowing it to sit/rise while I prepared my toppings (about 15 minutes).  It tasted way better than any crust I could have purchased at a store.  I made my crust thin, so I froze my leftover dough in the freezer for breadsticks later.  I recommend this recipe to anyone who may be looking for a fresh baked pizza crust, but does not have the time or does not want the complexity in making a traditional pizza crust.  Very nice flavor and texture!

This was pretty good, and it certainly is easy. I used half whole wheat flour and added oregano, Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the dough. Make sure to spread it out very thin - I didn't like the the thicker parts.

Not the best pizza crust, but allright.
It needs more salt. Put it in the oven for 25 minutes, but in the middle it still was not done. I made two pizza's out of the dough.

My daughter wanted pizza and I didn't have time to make a normal crust and wait for it to rise, so when I found this recipe I was so glad.  It turned out delicious and was so fast and easy.  Katie ate half the pizza and even my husband ate quite a few pieces even though he wasn't hungry.  We'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!

Crust was very easy to make, but was not very flavorful.  Adding spices might help. It is definitely a soft crust and cooked well all the way to the center. I would use this again if I were short on time.

WOW! This was a very quick, very easy, very delicious alternative to frozen or delivered pizza. I did add some herbs (rosemary, basil, oregano). My one problem with it was that the pizza never quite crusted up underneath the way I would have liked. I suspect this may be in large part to my oven and plan on lowering the temp the next time I make it. There will be many opportunities to experiment, since it was such a hit with my friends.

This is OK for a prebaked pizza crust.  The ease of pulling it out of the freezer for a quick meal is great.  Overall, it lacks flavor, so spices are a must.  Also, I would bake a shorter time so that it isn't so hard when the pizza is finished.

This is a great recipe. I love the fact that you don't have to wait all day to enjoy it. I love to make it just as crust with a sprinkle of italian seasoning, parm or fav cheese and a little garlic salt drizzle olive oil and dip in fav marinara sauce.

I enjoy this recipe because I can quickly make a real, rising crust from scratch.  However, it usually comes out denser than I would like.

This was really good!  It is very similar to my regular "quick" pizza crust recipe, but without the 30 minute rest time.  I did prebake the crust for 10 minutes.  Whole family loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!  Will use this one from now on when I'm in a hurry...which is quite often :)

This is the only pizza crust recipe I use lately. Even when I make it with whole wheat flour it does not deter from the taste. I also add some dried herbs to the dough. Just as the name but "quick, easy and tasty"

This was a great recipe.. I added a little more seasonings to mine but didnt take a whole lot.  The only thing i found is that it needs a little more flour so it not sticky.

This pizza crust turned out great. While it doesn't taste as good as the dough that takes time to rise, it made up for that with how quick and simple it is to make.

This is the greatest!!! My family uses this allll the time for pizza night.. for any time my kids want a pizza.. Unless we are eating pizza out, we use this recipe. I NEVER buy frozen pizzas for my kids anymore. I even use this for Focaccia bread, I just add tons of herbs & garlic & roll out into a rectangle shape.  ;]

I tried this last night and it was the best! I added just a hint of italian seasoning. Take out just can't compare for cost, freshness or taste.

Thanks for an easy recipe that helped me make dinner in a pinch!  I'm not good with dough, but this came out really well.  It was very sticky at first, but I added flour as I shaped it and it came out fine.  Thanks again! :)

Added minced garlic, garlic salt, onion powder, italian season and grated parm cheese... no tossing needed.  As a matter of fact, I did not even roll... just took from mixing bowl and 'spread' onto our cooking stone.  Simply Fab!  TY

This crust isn't as "bready" as some other homemade crusts.  It tastes really good, and can be done completely in one hour.  Be careful when transferring it from counter to pan; it's very tender!

This is a good quick pizza crust.  I made it without a stand mixer and just kneaded the dough for about 5 minutes.  I also added 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and it turned out great, I'm going to add more next time.

This was good. I would use it again, when time is a factor; otherwise I would make a 'regular' crust. It was a bit too salty for me.

Excellent! Very quick and simple and comes out yummy. I used Rapid Rise yeast and allowed to rise for about 30 mins, then prebaked for a few minutes first, and it was awesome. This will be my new standard crust. Why work so hard for the others when this one is so easy and good?

For a quick pizza crust, this is excellent. My husband prefers thinner crusts (this ended up being ~ 3/4 inch), but I liked that it filled us up with more bread than the less healthy toppings. My new default crust recipe. Thanks, Amanda!

Homemade pizza for me is a 'quick' meal, but finding a good, quick pizza crust is always difficult- until now!  Except where I over-worked the crust, the dough had a great flavor and had just the right amount of chewiness.  I look forward to trying it with bread flour as suggested.

This recipe is amazing! We use it all the time when we need to make a quick and cheap meal-- we mix a can of chopped tomatoes with some ketchup, pile on some sauteed peppers and onions, cover with cheese, and bake. Yum!!

Awesome!  I've tried many homemade crusts and although they've been much more trouble to make they haven't been as good as this one.  The dough is so easy to handle and the end results are foolproof.  We like to stir in our favorite seasonings - garlic powder, oregano, and basil.

Quite excellent for as quick and easy it was.  I agree with others that the traditional (with rise time) crust would be better, but when you suddenly have a craving for homemade pizza, this will work very well.  Best of all, all three of my kids gobbled it up happily, and that counts as true success around here.
