I made this early today so that I could get a picture of it, and some of it ended up in my coffee!  Yum!  This is a wonderful dessert drink!  Definitely 5 stars!

Yum! This is so good.  I decreased the amount of Hazelnut as I think it's a bit strong of a flavor and used cake vodka and added a but more cream so it wasn't as strong.  Perfect!
