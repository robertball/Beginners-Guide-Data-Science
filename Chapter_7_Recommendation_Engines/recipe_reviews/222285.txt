This is one of my kids favorite treats because they can make this almost by themselves. Instead of using magic shell topping, I melt a cup or so of semi-sweet chocolate chips with a couple teaspoons of butter or shortening in the microwave until smooth and dip the marshmallows in that. We like using cinnamon grahams or chocolate grahams to roll the chocolate covered marshmallows in. GREAT cheap treat made with ingredients that are in most everyone's pantry.

My 13 and 5 year olds made these for our BBQ yesterday. Quick, easy, and all of the kids loved them! Doubled the recipe and I was able to find the jumbo marshmellows. I also bought a bottle of Reese's peanut butter topping and on some the kids put some of the pb topping on and then quickly poured the Magic Shell over it and then rolled in the crushed grahams. A fun treat and some with a chocolate and peanut butter twist! Great for the kiddos to make and I've already passed the recipe on to a few of my Girl Scout Leader friends! Thanks!

These were very good and so easy to make! I used melted chocolate chips instead of the 'Magic Shell' because that's what I had available. My family gobbled these up real quick! I will make these more often.

I kept my grandkids recently and ended up making these S'mores Pops every day. They loved making them AND eating them. We made an accidental happy discovery one day: We left the pops in the freezer for about 15 minutes instead of 5. We loved how chewy they were. This is a great little dessert or treat even very young  kids can make with a little supervision.

Super easy to make, my 3-year old and 5-year old made these themselves while I was making tortillas. Tastes yummy too. 5 stars for being super quick and easy to assemble.

Tasted delicious, fun for the kids but not easy to make. The chocolate automatically slides straight to the bottom and pools there.
