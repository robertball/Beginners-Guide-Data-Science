This was an interesting dip.  I liked the flavor, but the color looks very similar to pimiento cheese.  Be sure to let your guests know that it is not!  My crackers had a very slight sweet taste, and I liked the combination.  I'm giving 4 stars because the delicate crab flavor nearly got lost.

Very good crab dip. I made it as indicated, but cut down on the amounts of everything but the crab.

The recipe as shown is incorrect.  It's NOT 1 1/4 cups mayo, it's 1/4 cup mayo.  Huge difference.  It's no wonder it came out like soup for those who used 1 1/2 cups of mayo.  I use miracle whip for just about everything that mayo calls for.  Gives dishes a bit of zip.  Next time I think I'll add some pimento!  There's 2 pictures shown.  One is chunky, the other one is like soup...

My husband's Aunt and Uncle owned the Sea Captain's restaurant in Murrell's Inlet.  This was the recipe they made expect they used much less mayo.  This only needs 1/2 the amount (or less) mayo than this calls for in the recipe.  The crab is meant to be tasted!

This was a nice addition to our cheese and crackers snack board during the holidays.  I used a much lighter hand with the mayo, adding only 1/3 cup and a slightly heavier hand with the crab and horseradish.  The horseradish gives it a nice zing!

I only added 1/2 cup of mayo, otherwise it would have been mayonnaise soup. It was just okay.

Added 2x the crab meat, and it was still waaayyy too much mayo. I'd cut it down to maybe a 1/2 cup, tops.
