This is Charlotte and I should have mentioned that the reason I cooked the seafood in the stock in the directions and then removed was to be sure the shrimp and crawfish had a good flavor. Nothing worse than bland seafood. Also didn't want to over cook them.
As I said in cook's notes, you could cook seperately but be sure to add good seasoning. I also prefer using as few pots as possible.

I much prefer angel hair pasta with this recipe.  I used 1/2 & 1/2 but I think the recipe can do without milk.  The trick to this recipe is all of the herbs & spices, they really brighten the recipe.  I used ProgessoÂ© brand  Lobster Sauce (3 12 oz cans) as seafood stock. And yes cook the seafood separately to keep from over-cooking it. Good Recipe!!
