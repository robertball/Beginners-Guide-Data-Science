Fantastic!!! Love, love, LOVE this recipe! The ancho and cayenne work wonderfully with the richness of the devil's food cake. As written, I found it to have just the right amount of kick - not overwhelming at all. It really is a great 'adult' cupcake. The frosting is KILLER and compliments the cupcakes perfectly. I will definitely make these again. Thanks! :)

WOW...these were AMAZING!!!! Made them exactly as written and feel there are no changes needed...just the right amount of 'heat', not a hot, spicy heat, just a warm heat that you can feel in the back of your throat....SO YUMMY! The icing is definately the star of these cupcakes, and would go great on a variety of cakes, or from a spoon as I was doing, lol. Even my little guy LOVED these, but he is partial to spicy foods, so I knew that he would be ablr to handle this. Can't wait to share these with my family and friends. Definate repeat recipe! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was quite interesting! I just made this for my husband & our neighbors whom were over..  These were a hit with all the guys for sure... very different, but worth a try..  IMO the frosting didn't look too appealing because of the spices, so I topped it with  caramel sauce to help. Regardless, by the time everyone left they had eaten them all gone!  They are an adult cupcake, I wouldn't recommend these for kids, unless they have a eclectic pallet & can tolerate heat..  I will note that I used tofutti non-dairy cream cheese & earth balance butter.

This is my recipe and I was requested to make 50 for an event in Eugene. I amped up the Ancho and Cayenne ground pepper per request to two teaspoons Ancho and 1/2 teaspoon Cayenne in the CC batter. Actually, I thought it tasted good and was still not too hot for this wimp. That's why I like this recipe. Make it as you like... less pepper powder or more. Of course I made some for hubby too! He liked the spicer version too.

Fantastic!!Made these according to the recipe as written mainly out of curiosity!  WoW!!! They were a big hit at a party I had tonight. I made them as minature cupcakes and served them as a "Guess the ingredient " dish.  Only one person out of 22 came up with the  Ancho chili and cayenne pepper.  Highly recommend this recipe.

These cupcakes were good, just not great and my opinion is it's because of the box mix rather than from scratch.  I couldn't find ancho chili pepper, but a friend brought me dried pasilla chilis, which I ground myself.  The cupcakes could use a little more heat, so don't be afraid to bump up the peppers if you like spicy.  I will make them again from scratch.  I think a dark chocolate cocoa would be great.

Excellent recipe.  I tasted the batter and loved it, I tasted the frosting which would have been delicious with no spices and decided to add more of each type of chili per personal taste.  They are just delicious and I love how they look. Thank you for posting.

These cupcakes are such a surprisingly fun treat! Just the right amount of heat. They make your tongue tingle but are very delicious. I used pillsbury's moist supreme devil's food mix and the cupcakes without frosting were noteworthy. After adding the frosting, they were outstanding. I highly recommend this recipe and I plan on experimenting with a little extra spice for more heat.?

In honor of the Kentucky Derby on Cinco de Mayo, I substituted the vanilla in the frosting with a splash of bourbon. These are really flavorful!

I made these for my mexican party and they were a HUGE hit!  I'm not sure if I am an under-icer but with 24 cupcakes, I still had half the icing left over...so I just made a cake and finished the icing off.  Win win!

Easy and delicious!

I'm diabetic so I made a couple changes to suit my diet needs, using a no-sugar-added cake mix (Pilsbury brand) and cutting the confections sugar in the icing in half.

They're still fantastic and you'd never know they were lower sugar.

That being said, I imagine adding the full 4 cups of confectioner's sugar would make the icing even better (it was darn good with half!). I did think the heat was a little mild and added just a bit more ancho and cayenne to the mix. I don't think I'm brave enough to add chopped bits of pepper though.

Definitely making these again, and definitely going to go eat another right now!

These were a hit in our house and with the co-workers!  You can easily add more spice to your taste.  Very mild flavor as written.  Frosting is awesome and would be great with the cinnamon alone for use with spice cake or pumpkin cake.

Good recipe. But if want spicer simmer dried chiles in the water for 15 min then let cool. Use the water as directed in the cake batter. It activates true heat of peppers and really gives a kick.

Keep these for just a few hours before eating them---if you can!  I think the flavors set much better when you give them a little time.  These were just delicious!  I used a Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate Fudge box mix (and I hardly ever use box mixes!), and made 52 mini cupcakes, baking them at 350 for 14 minutes.  Everything else was done just as the well-written recipe stated.  I took them to a school for the teachers' first day back, and they were a total success!  I can't believe I waited so long to make these cupcakes!  Thanks, Candice!

Made recipe exactly as stated (as much as I avoid using box mix because I hate the taste, I thought the spice would counteract the 'chemical' tones). Box mix just tastes like normal box chocolate cake, no spice tones to it, and the frosting tastes like spicy cream cheese. Maybe it's because I don't like cream cheese that much, but when I bit into a cupcake to try it I had to throw the rest out. If I were ever try to remake these, I'd make the cake from scratch and possibly double the spice, and either add a lot more powdered sugar or vanilla to counteract the strong cream cheese flavor of the frosting. Or I just won't try to make these again! Also only made around 15 cupcakes, same with the amount of frosting (might have been me over pouring into the paper cups though). Really disappointed and I'm almost ashamed to bring the rest into work since I've made a multitude of other recipes on this site for my coworkers, all of which were a hit. Hope this doesn't leave a bad taste for my baking in their mouth - live and learn!

I made these last night for a party at my house.  My husband LOVED them, I thought they could use a ittle more heat - I was slightly disappointed.  Overall - good cupcake.

This cake was delicious and moist and easy but I have one gripe. It was NOT spicy. There was a slight aftertaste of chili/cayenne but you kind of had to be looking for it to taste it. I had even added some extra cayenne but if I make this again I will double or triple the spice it calls for.

Absolutely fantastic - the best cupcakes I have ever made and I have made a lot of cupcakes!  Moist and light and the slight kick of heat, felt like I bought them from a gourmet cupcake bakery!  Definitely a recipe I will make again and again.  Made recipe to the letter, just doubled ancho and cayenne spices for a little extra kick.  Thanks so much for this recipe - SIMPLY AWESOME!!

Just made these this morning for a small gathering. I wanted to try something new and different for my guests. Very delicious. The sweet balances the heat perfectly. As another reviewer said; I didn't need all the frosting. I used about 2/3 of what the recipe yielded. Will make again.

I was disappointed after reading all the reviews, with how lame these were.  I followed the recipe and they tasted fine - but I didn't tell anyone what they were and everyone guessed they were plain chocolate cupcakes.  Certainly not enough 'kick' and the frosting was not that appealing.

Great recipe.  I thought it needed a bit more kick though so I added more ancho chile pepper and cayenne to both the batter and the frosting.  D-lish!  BIG hit at my brother's 40th birthday which also happens to fall on Cinco de Mayo!!

I had to try these because they were unusual.  I love them!  They're not spicy at all...just a hint in the finish.  The frosting is super-yummy! It was a hit overall at work, and I'd definitely make them again.

One word: AMAZING!  My college-age son and I made these a few days ago and they were a huge hit!!!  We followed the recipe exactly, with one exception - we added 2 tsp. cinnamon to the batter.  We liked them the day we made them, BUT the flavors developed more overnight in the fridge and the next day, BOOM!  Awesome!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!!!

I really enjoyed these. I'm not one to typically use boxed cake mix, but I did for this and it saved a lot of time and still tastes great. I like more spice than the average person, so I added more ancho chile powder and cayenne pepper and also some cinnamon to the cake mix. They turned out pretty great!

I used a non-box Chocolate cake recipe and couldn't find ancho chile powder so just used regular chile powder and entered into a "chili" cook off...didn't win but got some good reviews :)

These were ok, nothing special.  If you didn't know what was in them when you tried them, I'm not sure you would think they were anything but chocolate cupcakes.  My box of cake mix was 15 oz, so I reduced the water to 1 cup but kept the other items to the amounts written in the recipe, including the spices. The heat was very subtle, barely noticeable.  Everyone at our work party tried them out of curiosity, but they weren't a hit.  I did like the addition of cinnamon in the cream cheese frosting, and that flavor paired well with the chocolate cupcake.

I tried this last night & these are fantastic! Just the right amount of kick. Even my 9 year old loved them! The cream cheese frosting is a good compliment to the heat of the chocolate.

Made a cake with this recipe for my chili head husband's birthday. I added extra spice for his taste and we all loved it.

These are delicious! I tested them out on a CIA grad for her approval to use for a Mexican themed wedding shower. Five people gave them rave reviews! I couldn't find ancho chile pepper and used a half and half combo of pasilla and New Mexico chiles.  I'm going to look again for the anchos today.

I made this for work and it was a total hit! That said next time I make it I'm going to add more pepper to the cake to kick it up a bit.

I really loved these, they were good! But they fell apart so easily, and were very doughy. I felt pretty terrible after I served them to a party and no one liked them, and I don't think I'll ever make these again anytime soon. I really hate to leave a bad review, but I was thoroughly disappointed.

These were amazing! I made them for my daughter's Spanish class to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. They were a huge hit with a bunch of 7th graders. I substituted Chipotle pepper, left everything else the same. They are moist and perfect.

These are awesome!!  As suggested by Candice and others, I upped the Ancho Chili to 2 tsp, cayenne to 1/2 and added 2 tsp cinnamon.  Left the frosting 'as is' tho only made 3/4 recipe as others suggested.  Ended up having to make more.  I think if you pipe the icing it uses more than if you just slather it on.   Recipe made almost 50 mini cupcakes.  This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing Candice.

I made a GF version but I'm going to rate this anyway because this is really two recipes in one. I used a "from scratch" GF dark chocolate cupcake adding the ancho and the cayenne as in the instructions. I made the frosting and thought it needed to be spicier, but I like spice. I made these for a group of people so I made some fire hot and some not. In the tweaked version I tripled the ancho and quadrupled the cayenne but I also fiddled with the cream cheese amount. I wouldn't change the cupcake amounts, they bake up zingy enough. The frosting at first was too sweet for me and so I added more cream cheese to balance it out. Once I had let it sit for a while in the fridge, it became more mellow and so I suggest making this as written, wait and let the flavours meld, then make any adjustments. I think I was too hasty to change the frosting immediately. The outcome though, is a delicious double whammy recipe because both are wonderful on their own, and together they were the hands down winner at my get together. Everyone asked for the recipe. I even used the extra frosting as a filling for crepes....yummmm....Thank you Candice for sharing your recipe!

Well, I thought they were great, but I didn't love the boxed mix I chose. I went with Betty Crocker bc Box Tops for Education, but I wish I'd gone with Duncan Hines. Sorry Betty Crocker, but it's true: You come in dead last even after Pillsbury. But anyway, I thought these were great. They made exactly 24 with quite a bit more frosting than I needed, but I didn't pipe. I do think it'd have made enough to pipe and maybe even core and fill them, which would've been super tasty too. I added a sprinkle of cayenne to the tops for decoration. These are show-stoppers and conversation pieces, for sure. Can't wait to hear what DH's coworkers think! P.S. I added quite a bit more cinnamon to the frosting just because it seemed like a tasty idea. Go with that if you love cinnamon, it doesn't override the pepper or the chocolate!

Very good!  I followed the recipe except that I subbed chili powder for the ancho because I didn't have it. I do think it needs just a little more heat/pepper flavor, but maybe that's because I used regular chili powder. When I make them again, I will just use a teeny bit more of the spices.  Thanks!

I made recipe as is, only adding vanilla to the box mix. But I do that to all boxed mixes. I love cream cheese frosting and it was really good with the extra kick of spices. My family and friends loved them little change in cupcake flavor. 
Will definitely make again. Nice cupcake with very little effort.

Excellent! The heat is subtle and sneaks up afterward.  The frosting is very good as well and pipes smoothly.

This recipe had so many good reviews, but I was disappointed.  It is a good basic chocolate cupcake with cream cheese icing.  In addition to doubling the hot spices in the cake recipe, I tripled the cayenne (and at least x5'd the ancho pepper and added a few dried chopped red chile peppers), but even my spice-wimp boyfriend couldn't tell that it was supposed to be a chocolate chile cupcake.  I ended up sifting Penzy's Hot Chile Powder on top of the iced cupcakes; that helped a little and I was worried that I overdid it, but nope. I should have sifted on a lot more, because the chile flavor was still pretty subtle. Note: the recipe says to beat the batter for 2 minutes, but that's way too long and makes a tougher cake. Just beat it enough to combine it, which was about 30 seconds for me.

This was the 2nd time I've made these and they were a hit each time.   I followed the recipe exactly and the heat is subtle enough for all to enjoy.  You could add a bit more chili powder or Cayenne pepper but be careful.  I made mini cupcakes - baking 12 minutes - and made 48.  Perfect for a dessert tray with bite size treats.  Big hit.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made these for Cinco de Mayo dinner, so good and moist. I used half the Chili pepper for the icing as one guest is not a heat lover, SO DELICIOUS. Next time I may add a bit more. Could be my new favourite cream cheese icing. I will definitely make again.

I did not have the ancho chili powder so modified by grinding red pepper flakes into regular chili powder per an on line suggestion.  I work okay but I am sure if I had the ancho chili powder it would have been even better.  I will need to get to Penzy's where I am sure they will have it.

I love these cupcakes! I’ve made them three or four times now and they’re always a hit...that is, with the people who are adventurous enough to try them. Every time I make them for a party, people always ask for the recipe.

That being said, I did take into account the helpful advice from multiple other reviewers for this recipe, so I’ll reiterate—
1. I always taste-test the batter before I divvy it up to make sure there’s a noticeable kick, and every time I’ve ended up putting in about double the amount of spices that the recipe calls for, otherwise I can’t taste the spice at all. This is consistent with a lot of other reviews and is coming from someone who doesn’t have a high tolerance for spice. I can assure you I haven’t had anyone complain about my cupcakes being too spicy yet from doing this. If you aren’t reckless enough to continually taste-test the raw batter and run the risks, though, you may just have to season this blindly and hope for the best.

2. I've always used Duncan Hines cake mix, since many reviews plugged that brand specifically for taste quality, and while I can’t give a comparison, the cupcakes have turned out amazing every time so far.

3. The icing is excellent and really completes the cupcakes, which end up coming out super moist. You definitely have to pipe the icing, though--as I've learned, trying to spread it on with a knife will inevitably lead to a crumbly, sticky, disastrous failure. Fragile, moist cupcakes like these are no match for thick,

I have made these cupcakes one time. I followed the instructions exactly (minus the chile pepper garnish.)

The flavor was very good. A nice bite of heat, but not overly spicy. 

The reason I'm giving three stars is that when I tried them, I thought something just didn't seem right. Then, the more I thought of it, I figured out what it was. They frosting and cupcake are not balanced. The cupcake is incredibly light and fluffy; the frosting is very dense. Both are very good on their own. I would recommend using the frosting on a denser cupcake or using a fluffier frosting on this cupcake. Some people might like a dense frosting on a light, fluffy cupcake, but that's not my preference. Hope that this review will be helpful!

simple and tasty--I would add a little more spice the next time as I didn't think it had enough "kick."

The cupcake that bites back! They can really mess with your head. They're not extremely hot, but, they have a little kick. My granddaughter's 13th birthday party was on May 5th. These for right in and she loved yhem.

The recipe states to use an 18.25 cake mix and 1 1/4 cup of water, I only found 15.25 ounce cake mixes and it stated to use 1 cup of water  other than that I followed the recipe and they were excellent.

This was ok, and certainly different. I've had chilli chocolate before and loved it, but these cupcakes weren't quite as good. Needs to be more dark chocolatey I think. I found half the amount of sugar in the icing was quite sufficient, and I prefer my cream cheese icing without butter - the butter doesn't add anything but calories to it. I'm not likely to make these again, but I am glad I gave them a go.

I absolutely LOVED these! I bumped the spices up just a little due to my personal taste, and I found it to be just right. Even the kids liked these, and didn’t find them too spicy, and they went over wonderfully at a Thanksgiving party I took them to. I will definitely be making these again; that icing especially is to die for.

I was hesitant to use cake mix but figured I'd try the original recipe as is.  It is absolutely delicious and was a huge hit at my chili cook off.  I didn't feel the cream cheese & butter to icing sugar ratio was sufficient though as they got quite soft at room temperature.  I'd change that next time.

This recipe is perfect! I brought these cupcakes to work for a  cinco de mayo carry in and they were a huge hit. The frosting is so good! I made the recipe exactly as written, and its the perfect amount of chile pepper--not overwhelming or spicy, just enough heat to let you know its there. I'll be making these again and again!

Excellent!  Baking up a batch right now for the annual Cinco de Mayo party at our club.  well, not that I have a choice - I'm not allowed to attend without them!  As another reviewer stated, not to hot.  Just feel a bit of warmth in the back of your throat as you swallow.  Perfect!

The cutest, best cupcakes for our Cinco de Mayo party. Only change made was to an extra half teaspoon of ancho chili powder to the cake mix based on other reviews. Everyone loved them. Will make again.

I thought the flavor in the cupcake part was too subtle and the cake was a little on the dry side, but really enjoyed the frosting flavor.  Half the recipe was plenty to frost 2 dozen cupcakes although I would never recommend actually topping them with dried chilies.

These were the most amazing cupcakes & frosting EVER! I didn't have the ancho chili powder so used regular (and added extra!) but they were sooo good. I will definitely make these again. Every one loved them & they didn't last long!

They had the perfect amount of spice (sort of a cozy heat in the back of your throat). I'm going to make them for an upcoming cookoff party. Only change I mades was in the type of pepper. I couldn't find ground ancho pepper so I got dehydrated costeno peppers and ground some up. Yummy!

These were really yummy!  I used a dark chocolate fudge box mix instead of the devil's food.  I love hot & spicy food, and I think I could have doubled the spices, but everyone else said they were fine as is.  If you pipe the frosting on with a decorator tip, you will need almost all of the frosting; If you just spread it on, you could probably half the amount of frosting in the recipe. I will definitely make these again!

The cupcake was fine although no one I served them to could taste the pepper even though I added more than what the recipe called for. I thought the icing was particularly bad. I think it probably would have been better with a simple whipped cream topping. I wouldn't go to the effort to make these again.

I made these but used my own chocolate cake recipe since I didn't want to go to the store. I used the spices and milk. I only used 3/4 cup milk but think I could have gotten away with 1/2 cup. 
Frosting is the bomb. Taking these for a cinco de mayo event. Mmm!
Next time I will add more spices. No kick!  Great recipe.

The use of a box cake mix really hurt this recipe as it was generic and tasteless.  The chocolate needed to be deeper and richer.  There wasn't enough required spice to give it a kick to stand out as a "chilie" cupcake.  Recommend adding extra spice to the chocolate.  The icing as written was yummy.

I followed the recipe exactly. The frosting was amazing. The cupcake itself had minimal heat. To add extra heat I made a chocolate ganache with 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream and 1 cup milk chocolate chips. To the ganache I added almost 3tsp. Ancho chili pepper powder and about 1.5 tsp Ceyenne pepper. I heavy drizzled it over the icing and what a difference! I got rave reviews and will definitely be making more soon!

Very good recipe, just too much heat for our taste. I would normally have cut the cayenne and ancho chili in 1/2 but  I made these as is based on the reviews. Lots of people said the heat wasn't very strong. Well, they must have used old spices because the heat was too strong for my entire family.

Pretty good recipe, overall.  The cupcakes are fine (cake mix, so nothing to shout about!), but I didn't really notice the spice in them.  Maybe I'll add a bit more, next time.  The icing is good, but not overly spicy.  I only noticed it in the back of my throat about 30 seconds after a bite.  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of caramel extract to the icing,  which made a nice difference.

I didn't use a box mix either, I used the recipe for Devils  Food Cake I on this site.I also used chocolate pudding, and Patrón Incendio, and substituted Mexican chocolate for the unsweetened chocolate in the recipe.  The cupcakes turned out really moist and really rich, and I'm totally addicted to this frosting now.

If you live in Mexico, this will not seem at all spicy to you. It has a tiny, tiny kick. My kids wouldn't even notice the spice in this. It just leaves you with a little burning sensation in the throat, but not enough to really know that it was from the cupcake. I will make it again, but I'll add more spice next time.
At some point in the future, when I am not at high altitude, I'll make my own chocolate cake to go along with it, but for now, I'm quite comfortable with boxed mixes.

I made these for a church gathering and they were awesome! I used a gluten free betty crocker devil's food and they turned out perfectly. Didn't stray from the recipe at all. Even the kids loved them! I don't like spicy food but these had just enough kick and perfect flavor. Every single one was gone in no time at all!
