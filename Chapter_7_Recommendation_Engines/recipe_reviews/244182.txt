This is a great smoothie. I used fresh squeezed orange juice instead of water. Yum!! Thank you for the recipe!

This was great. I modified a little and used 1.5 banana, and walnuts instead of pecans (because I didn't have any)! I topped it with some chia seeds and a few frozen raspberries! Loved it, will definitely make it again!

This was fantastic! I didn't have flax seed meal or dates, so I replaced them with shredded coconut and peaches. I absolutely love this smoothie!
