This will make them better:
Drain the beet liquid into a small saucepan.  Add 1/4 c. sugar and 1/4 c. of cider vinegar.  Simmer while stirring for 5 minutes.  Put eggs into container and top with onions if using them and then beets , add liquid.  Refrigerate for at least 48 hours, 4 days is best.  Be sure to stir or shake container once or twice a day for even color.  I usually use a max of 8 eggs with this recipe.

I have been eating these my whole life (68) and they have always had a couple tablespoon of cider vinegar in them. Maybe this is a Pennsylvania Dutch thing

The easiest recipe I know of...to answer Donnadeety's question, no you don't add cider vinegar as the pickeled beet juice contains it already

My family has been making pickled eggs with beets for as long as I can remember, So this was a easy substitute. One down fall it did have was the longer they sat the sweeter they got. I'm sure that has something to do with the pickled beets I used, so be aware of how much sugar they have in them.  To balance out the sweetness and put back some of the tang back in them I did add some cider vinegar to them.

Well, it was really difficult to wait 2 days but I did!  We thought these were very good, I did add minced garlic.  These make such a great 'on the run' snack for me!

I tasted one after 24 hrs, and decided to add some apple cider vinegar as I like a bit of a twang to my pickled eggs. They were ok. I doubt I'll make them again.
