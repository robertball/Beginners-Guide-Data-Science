I made this recipe using turkey chop meat and I also added mozzarella cheese. It tasted like a low carb lasagna with the eggplant taking the place of the lasagna noodles. This was delicious and tasted even better the next day. I can't wait to make it again.

This has great flavor!   Note:  I did not mention eggplant when serving this - everyone loved it.   I used a 9 x 6" baking dish, which made it a little thicker than probably intended - it worked well for us.  (I did have a little sauce leftover, but that was OK)  The beaten egg on the top was a bit different for us but worked just fine.  Warning, this does not cut as pretty as I would like but the taste more than makes up for that.  Thanks!

I've never cooked eggplant but I know that it tends to take on oil when you cook it. Even though I drained really well with paper towels it was still a little greasy, but when mixed in with everything else it was fine. My family loved this dish and so did I. We just served it with some crusty garlic bread. One eggplant was not enough probably bc I used a slightly bigger casserold dish. Probably would be fine in an 8x8 dish or just buy an extra eggplant.
Oh and the key is in a good quality sauce!

My husband doesn't like eggplant but he really loved this dish! Instead of using jarred spaghetti sauce I used a a can of stewed whole tomatoes, smashing the tomatoes up with a fork. I also used basil instead of oregano because that's what I had. The recipe fit nicely in a 9x6 baking dish. Definitely a keeper!

This was delicious, I put some sliced portabellos on top of the first layer of eggplant and breaded the last layer of eggplant on top with just a few dollops of sauce with no meat on top of them. Before dinner my husband said he did not like eggplant and after dinner asked if there would be some leftovers!

Really great idea. I altered mine slightly. My parmesan cheese had gone bad so I used vegan mozzarella. And I added baby spinach so it more like a lasagna. It was delicious. Even the kids gobbled it up. I think next time Iâ€™ll do thicker slices of eggplant and more layers so it more like an eggplant lasagna.
