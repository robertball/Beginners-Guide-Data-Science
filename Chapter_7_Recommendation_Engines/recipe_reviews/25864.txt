Thank goodness for this recipe!  I wanted to make a Seafood Thermidor and was having one heck of a time finding any recipe at all.  I served this to a bit of a crowd so I doubled everything.  Instead of the crawfish, I used 1 pound of crabmeat, and about 1/2 pound each of bay scallops and cooked shrimp.  I used 1/2 the amount of red pepper flakes, since some of my guests do not like too much spice.  For the wine, I used a bit of sherry and white wine for the balance.  Delicious!  Thanks Kathleen, you are a life saver!

I was barely able to get this into the oven--I kept eating the sauce straight from the skillet!

I made Lobster Thermidor and it was the BEST ever. I have had lobster thermidor in the caribbean and it's always been my favorite. Having the lobster with just butter just never seemed good enough. I was happy to come across this recipe. I made it and my family loved it. My fiance never eats seafood and he tried it and he LOVED it. This recipe rocks. You will not regret making this.

This was a pretty good recipe but I thought it was a tad bland, so my wife and I put a little spin on it ,after everything was in the skillet we added a couple of teaspoons of minced garlic 2 teaspoons of onion powder and a teaspoon of lemon pepper put the mixture in the ramikens and baked it for 15 min, while it was cooking we boiled pasta drained it and then made a picatta sauce out of 1/4 pound of butter 2 tbl spoons lemon juice and capers (to your taste) put that on the pasta and served it with the thermadore it was awsome, especially mixed together

Delicious! I was looking for a sauce for some Orange Roughy I had and used this recipe. I served it over rice. Definitely a keeper - my husband asked me save this recipe.

I changed this recipe to Lobster thermidor and it was great.  I've been looking for this flavor for 30 years, ever since I had it in California.  It's the best.

Yesterday I bought a lb. of cooked crawfish because it was 2.99 as opposed to 1 lb. of shrimp for 4.99. I knew I'd find a recipe from this site. I didn't know the cooked crawfish had to peeled which revealed very little meat. Although I didn't have a ramekin, I just kept adding the ingredients in a large skillet to make a crawfish sauce. It has a mild spicy taste. I served it over brown rice (it looks better than white rice since the sauce is white). I saved a whole crawfish to put on the dinner plate for decor.

Pretty good! I used Chicken Broth instead of White Wine and I used .75lb of Crawfish and .75lb of Turkey Kielbasa without changing anything else and I think the Kielbasas really added to it!

This is decadent!! The sauce is amazing, so thick and rich. I can't get crawfish where I live so I went with a combo of shrimp, bay scallops and the meat from one crab claw.  I did cut the portions back to two, wish that I hadn't.  In step two I added the shells from the shrimp, the shells add a lot of flavour,  and removed them before adding starting step 3.  I added the raw scallops and cooked crab just before putting this in the oven. I won't make this often but I will make it again!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This  dish was easy to prepare and let the crawfish be the star as it should. I did not find this recipe bland whatsoever. The flavors were good and this is one I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

Followed recipe. Bland. Not a single one of four at my dinner table liked this.
