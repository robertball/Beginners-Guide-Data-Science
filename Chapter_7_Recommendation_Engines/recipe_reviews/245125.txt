I used egg roll wrappers as submitter mentioned in the footnotes. These were great and had a ton of flavor. I do think fresh bean sprouts would be better than can but the can worked too. The one thing I did think this recipe was lacking was cabbage. The meat/cabbage ratio seemed off and I would double the amount of cabbage next time.

I made this recipe for my Korean-American professor and she loved it! I followed the recipe except for a couple of replacements. My professor doesn't eat pork so I used only beef and instead of bean sprouts I used finely chopped  green beans.  Also, I used egg roll wraps instead of wonton wraps and they turned out so delicious that everyone who tried them loved them. I will definitely make them again :)
