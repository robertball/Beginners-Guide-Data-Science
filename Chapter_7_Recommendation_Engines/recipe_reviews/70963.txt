In a word...yum! I switched the recipe up just a little bit by lightly breading the tilapia with homemade bread crumbs for a nice crunch.  I served the fish "soft taco" style in a flour tortilla and left the anchovies out of the sauce. This meal was a real hit at my house and my visiting friend raved too.

Knowing how bland it can be, I sprinkled the tilapia with lemon pepper and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours. Husband enjoyed them, and particularly loved the feta sauce (he doesn't like anchovies, so I didn't tell him they were in it). This was a great way to get some fish into our diet. Thanks!

This was awesome!  I did substitute diced cucumber for the lettuce, and it was so good that way, I can't imagine it being quite as good without.  Still, what a great recipe, I am so glad to find a new way that we enjoy serving tilapia.  I used naan instead of pitas and served it like tacos.  I also substituted some anchovy paste for the actual anchovy fillets.  I used the Italian salad dressing mix recipe from this site to make the dressing, which was really good.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We love fish tacos, so decided to try this easy and healthy recipe. It is an easy dinner to make. I was pleasantly surprised by the sauce.  The fish was ok. Tilapia can be a little bland if not seasoned well. I prefer more of a fried flavor, but it is very healthy this way!
I am considering using my favorite fish sticks in place of the tilapia next time. We also used some hot sauce and that gave the pitas a real kick.

We LOVE tilapia and I agree that this was a very quick and easy dish. My husband couldn't get over the sauce, he raved. But neither of us have ever preferred the taste of mayo so i substituted low-fat sour cream in the sauce. Good Eats!

Very good recipe, but I made a few changes, and it was delicious.
1) I didn't add salt in the sauce (feta cheese is already salty)
2) I've added 1 teaspoon of oregano in the sauce as well 1 teaspoon of caper.

WOW!!!  This is soooo great!  My husband and I have made this at least a dozen times since we came across the recipe about two months ago.  We use butter lettuce in the pita and the flavors together are perfect.  Everyone we've made this for loves it and asks for the recipe.

i was actually looking for a fried tilapia recipe. i sprinkled mrs. dash southwest chipolte  with dredged in cornmeal for some crunch. made the sauce without the cheese, used a balsamic light vinegarette with mayo. would be awesome as pita or taco, love the idea of butter lettuce or baby greens.

This was excellent!  In fact the spicy mayo was so good, we have made a bowl full and used it for different sandwich/burger recipes!  I couldn't find anything but white pitas, so opted for the 100 calorie, 12 grain thin buns.  I also shredded fresh spinach as a healthier choice, than the lettuce.  What a great light meal for steamy hot days!!t

Great! I hate fish. My goal this year is to eat fish once a week, so I can be healthy and teach my kids good habits. Anyways, I didn't do anchovy's  because that just sounds gross. I followed everything else, and to my suprise it wasn't fishy at all. My husband and I both agree this is the best Talapia recipe I've tried so far. Thanks for sharing!

What a fabulous way to flavor a pretty bland fish. Husband turns up his nose at tilapia but LOVED these (made with the Peppy's Pitas recipe from this site). We were not able to use the cheese but used all of the other seasonings and loved it! Keeper!

Yum! These were delicious and a great way to eat tilapia, which can sometimes be bland. I used romaine lettuce instead of iceberg and tomatoes instead of the onions because I don't like onions but otherwise kept everything the same. The sauce was what really made it stand out. I was a little worried about using anchovies since I'd always thought they were kind of gross but you don't really notice them in the sauce. Definitely something I will make again.

Delicious. The sauce was great. I used lite Italian from Kens and olive oil mayo along with Mrs. Dash original seasoning for the salt & lemon pepper it called for. I did use anchovies and didn't notice them being there hardly. If your pitas are a pain to open, serve the stuffing mix on a plate and put the pitas on the side. Also, kids may not like Cayenne on their fish, so you can just omit that on their fish but it won't effect the sauce if you use it there. Will make this again for sure!

The only tweak that I recommend is flaking the fish into chunks, and mixing the fish, onion, and chopped cucumber (if you picked that up from other reviewers) WITH the sauce to create a yummy tuna salad-style mixture to spoon into the pitas.  Would make these a bit less messy!

I loved these! I skipped the anchovies and cayenne pepper. I also breaded the tilapia, since I served it separate to my kids.  Easy and really tasty!

SO good! And easy. However, next time I won't add salt to the sauce.  The feta cheese is salty enough.  My friend had the suggestion of using Greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise which would make it more healthy and might help the saltiness.

Exceptionally good. In fact, one of the best recipes I've ever tried from this site (and I've tried many!). Even my 12-year-old son wolfed one down and asked for another. The combination of flavours -- the zing of the cayenne, the sweetness of the dressing, the saltiness of the feta -- is scrumptious. Wow -- this one's a keeper!

Excellent sandwich.  I substituted Balsamic Viniagrette for Italian dressing and also added about 1/2 teaspoon of dill.  I dislike the taste of fish; the dressing does an awesome job of masking it!

Was good, but have to say that I didn't like as much as I expected.  I was a little nervous about the anchovy, but decided to give it a shot.  It actually added a nice flavor that wasn't super dominant.  If I were to make again, the one thing that I would change is the amount of Italian salad dressing.  It definitely was the strongest tasting out of all the ingredients.

This is the first time making this dish so I made the recipe "as written".  The fish was wonderful but my family didn't care for the sauce or the cayanne pepper.  Next time, I will probably leave these two items out.

This is suprize treat!  I didn't have anchovies or onions on hand, but none the less, was delighted with this pita sandwich.  I used light mayo and fat-free italian dressing. Yummy.  Will make again.  Thanks!

My husband said, what a delicious medley of flavors!  Used canola oil, can't stand the taste of olive oil.  I don't like fish, but this was good, and filling.  Good job, we will use this again.  The sauce was delicious!

I was a bit skeptical of this recipe as I'm not a big fan of fish.  I'm trying to eat fish at least once a week instead of a red meat.  The only change I made to this recipe was used tomato basil feta cheese, Thomas' Sahara whole wheat pita pockets and omitted the salt.  This was FANTASTIC, I will definitely make it again!!

AMAZING! I never had a fish taco before this and was kinda grossed out by the thought of it, but I wolfed this down so fast because it was just that good. I only left out the anchovies and everything else was the same. So good - thanks for making fish fun!!!!!

Different . Did not use feta , or anchovy as we do not care for them . I did use  1/2 cup parm. cheese instead. I bread & fry everything . Guess I don't like the true flavor of fish .......so this seemed a tad strong w/o frying in breading . But still good enough to eat . The sauce really added something but I kept feeling like ranch might be good . 2 out of 3 kids and 2 adults like this pita enough to eat again . Reminds me of something from a resturant . Thk you LAWOODE70

I thought the tilapia was very tasty but I wasn't crazy about the sauce. I think the anchovy made it too fishy and salty. I would recommend leaving that out to anyone who chooses to use this recipe though I probably wouldn't make it again.

Tried it tonight and loved it.  Will certainly serve to my next guest or my family.  I did not have pita bread on hand and used Nann but it was awesome.

This was OK.  I thought the sauce was overpowering and my husband didn't care for it.  It needed something more.  I did add sliced red bell pepper strips for added crunch, but I'm not sure I would make this again with the dressing.  The fish was cooked perfectly.  As a fish taco or wrap, maybe a drizzle of light sour cream or ranch dressing instead.

Excellent. very tasty and the sauce is great with it.  I used a flatbread instead of the pita and I used fresh spinach. I make lunch for a large group of people for extra money. Everyone 20+ people loved it.

I hate fish but the rest of the family loves it.  I made this as a compromise hoping I might at least like it, well.....I loved it.  I doubled the sauce (did not add the anchovies) so I had some left over.  The next day I used the sauce on a spinach salad....yummy.

If I could give this ten stars, I would.  It was absolutely wonderful.  I made it exactly as written, and seasoned the tilapia generously with the lemon pepper and cayenne.

This was very good.  I used way more lemon pepper and red pepper and left out the anchovies.  It makes a lot of sauce.  3 tilapia fillets weigh over 1 pound, so it's not a lot of fish for all the sauce.  I think I might half that next time.  I used balsamic instead of Italian because it's what I had.

My teen boys loved this! Thank you for an awesomely filling yet light dish. I used baby spinach instead of iceburg and grilled the pita pockets on my Foreman grilling machine. I even applied the anchovy fillets to the sauce.

The fish tasted great! My husband really liked this, too, which is always a bonus with any fish recipe. It was a little hard to know how much fish to put into each pita and so some had a little less in the beginning because of that. However, there weren't any complaints on taste, and that's what's most important. I'll DEFINITELY make this one again!

This was very good! I was surprised, because I don't like feta. But the sauce with the fish is amazing. I used RF mayo, and RF feta to lighten the calories. And I don't usually care for lemon pepper, but that was really good on the fish as well. Def. adding this to my weekly meal rotation. In fact, since I have leftover sauce,I'm making it again tonight!!!

I enjoyed these.  The feta, italian dressing, mayo combination was pretty good.  I seasoned the tilapia pretty heavily in lemon pepper, to give it excellent flavor.  The only thing I did differently was to use finely chopped spinach leaves instead of iceberg to make it a bit more colorful and nutritious.  I will definitely make these again.

I liked this dish, but if i were to make it again, i'd change up the sauce.  the combination of feta, anchovy, and italian dressing isnt bad, just a little odd.

My husband and I are not big fish fans, but I like the mildness of tilapia.  When I saw this come across my inbox, I decided to give it a shot.  Hands down, these were a HUGE HIT.  My husband LOVED them - the flavor in the sauce and the seasonings on the fish blended together perfectly.  We were both wary about the anchovies (our cat was my best friend while I was chopping them), but they just added to the flavor.  I also used diced cucumbers instead of lettuce, and used the "Peppy's Pita Bread" recipe from here for the pita pockets.  Hubby surprised me the next day by packing the (very few) leftovers for my lunch.  We will definitely be adding this to my recipe book at home.  Thank you for sharing!!

This was a great and different way to serve tilapia! The whole family loved it, and they had no idea that anchovies were in it! I used romaine lettuce instead of iceberg and I used a bit more lemon pepper. We will definitely have this again.

Delicious!!!  I didn't have anchovies so I used capers.  But the flavor was amazing!  Curious to try anchovies next time.  And didn't have pita but used tortillas so it was more of a fish taco.

I just couldn't add the anchovy! I tried, but when I cracked open that can I knew there was no way I could chop it up and eat it! Despite my inability to use that 1 ingredient, we loved the dish. We eat a lot of fish so I'm always trying to find a way to change it up. This is a definite keeper.

I made this for husband today and he loved it! I only made a few minor changes to add some flavor. I seasoned the tilapia with lemon pepper and lemon juice and let it marinate for a day in the fridge. Then when cooking the tilapia, I added Boston bay seasoning and cooked the onions in with the tilapia. I chopped up the onion and tilapia and added it to the mayo mix like a precious review mentioned and added some sriracha (since my husband adds it to everything). I also used spinach in the pitas instead of iceberg. He loved it so much he finally said I officially can cook! :)

Wonderful!  What else to say?  I love Greek styled foods - probably because I love most any Greek salad, and other Greek foods go so well together with Greek salads - perhaps especially when homemade pita is on the table.  The salad fills the plate and overflows into the pitas along with  - - - well, whatever is on the table.  This fish dish fits the bill in a light and wonderful way.  Fish is always quick to cook, and it is a nice change of pace from things like Greek-marinated chicken, seasoned lamb, or even ground beef sauteed with toms and sweet spices (with a touch of sugar - though that might be my second favorite pita filling - then again, the red been and cabbage and feta salad from this site is a great pita filling in a vegetarian sort of way....... hmmm......, do you think that I might really be learning to enjoy Greek food, even though I didn't grow up with it???? but happily, there are more Greek recipes to try....!!!  yum!  I can hardly wait, but I'll have these again!!!).
