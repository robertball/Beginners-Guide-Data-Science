I sprinkled the fish with a creole seasoning blend and browned it for a minute or two per side in olive oil before adding the stewed tomatos with a crushed clove of garlic and some basil, oregano and marojam.  Was delicious and super simple!

Great combination but I had to add to it. I added garlic, basil, oregano, salt and pepper. First time I had Tilapia with tomatoes and it worked very well!

Used Stewed tomatoes with Italian Seasoning, seasoned the fish with sea salt & old bay, and served over whole wheat rigatoni. Amazing! My husband and Son are not fans of tomatoes but loved this dish. Will make it again

I was lured to this recipe by how easy it was. I made it exactly as directed, and oh, my, was it bland! Like almost everyone else, I added to it -- to salvage it, I removed the cooked fish and added lime juice, salt, and pepper to the sauce to brighten it up. Mr. Pickypants and I are hardy souls and will eat the fish, anyway, but I won't make this recipe again.

I had some tilapia in the freezer that needed to be used up, so I decided to try this. I’m glad I did because it’s quick, easy and very tasty! I read other reviewers’ suggestions and added basil, oregano, salt and pepper; extra pepper for a little kick. I’ll definitely make this again!

I didn't have Tilpia but I had haddock fillets. I made it with fire roasted tomatoes and fresh garlic and dried Italian seasoning. I served it with rice . Easy to prepare and inexpensive. The recipe is bland and I didn't have to make it as written to guess . This was okay, but I am  undecided if I am going to make it again.
