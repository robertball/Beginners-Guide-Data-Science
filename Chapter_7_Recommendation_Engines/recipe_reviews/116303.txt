We had some people over last night, and I made this on a whim, and it was really good!  I usually make my green beans with bacon, but wanted something different.  I was afraid the honey would overpower the beans, but it was a very nice light sweetness that went really well with the cashews.  I also added a little fresh garlic (1 lg clove, pressed) and LOVED the outcome!  I was afraid it wouldn't turn out quite right b/c all I had was canned beans, but it still turned out really good.  Guests seemed to like it, and my picky BF (who doesn't eat many veggies) liked it also!  Will make again!

Simple to make and wonderful to eat!  I took these to a family dinner.  I sauteed the nuts, butter, and honey beforehand and took it in a bowl.  I used frozen green beans and put them in the bowl and heated it all in the microwave for several minutes until it was hot.  The recipe as written only makes 2 servings so I had to quadruple it.  Also it takes longer than  2 minutes to cook the cashews.  The green beans just have a light flavor to them, nothing heavy.  My husband even had seconds and he doesn't usually like vegetables with anything on them.

Pretty good, but I prefer the beans get a little softer than just steaming them.  Sauce was good.  You can definately switch around what kind of nuts you use.  I would make again.

Tweaked it a little bit - sauteed some sesame seeds along with the cashews. Absolutely delicious!

I didn't have cashews, so I used pecans instead. What a unique concept.  I also added in some black pepper and a small amound of garlic powder, it was a perfect accompaniment to the rosemary pork roast & garlic roasted scalloped potatoes.  Thanks for sharing :)

I served these with the maple salmon recipe from this site for dinner tonight and it was a perfect side dish.  I steamed the beans in the microwave and over cooked them a teeny bit, otherwise I would be 5 starts. I coarsely chopped the cashews by gently pounding with a rolling pin.

Excellent recipe!  My entire family, including my picky 6 and 7 year olds who never claim to like green beans, loved it!  My husband is a firefighter and can't wait to bring this recipe to the fire station.  I did add a little less butter then called for and it was plenty and I used pre-packaged plain salad topper sliced almonds instead of cashews since that's what I had on hand.

LOVE this recipe!   I almost always make green beans  this way now, especially for company, because it is simple, quick, and yet look and tastes so sophisticated.   I even made it for my mother-in-law, and she liked it so much that she started using every time SHE cooks green beans for company, too! 

I frequently decrease the butter, though, to cut down on the fat.   Only one or two tablespoons are absolutely necessary to help toast the cashews.   Otherwise it's not necessary.  The flavor of the cashews themselves eliminates the need for any more fat in the recipe. 

Thanks so much for sharing it!

Loved it! Who would have known sweet green beans would be so good. I gave it a four instead of five because I made some changes. I changed out the cashews for coarsely chopped almonds (what I had on hand). I sauteed about 3 Tbsp of chopped yellow onion before making the honeyed nuts. Then mixed it all together while the honey was still warm. Delicious! My husband kept saying how much he loved it, even the kids ate it!

We really enjoyed this. I melted the butter and honey ahead of time and just set it on a warm burner for a second before pouring it over the beans. I had roasted pecans on hand, so that is what I used. This is a winner in my book and I will definitely make this again. Thank you!

We thought these were just OK.  They were very buttery but the honey and cashew flavor was not as strong as we had hoped.  Not bad but not mind blowing.

I make this recipe about once a week using fresh green beans. It is sooo good! I usually at least double the recipe. Even my two year old loves these.

I made 2 changes and my non-vegetable eating kids actually licked their plates.
1. Blanched green beans in salted water instead of steaming them.
2. Use canola oil to saute and add 1 t. minced garlic 
Never thought of using honey with green beans before but it turns out superb!!

Exceptional! Made it for just me and hubby. We licked it clean! I did change the recipe somewhat to suit what I had in the house- olive oil instead of margarine/butter, and almonds instead of cashews. delicious!

This was very good.  I used a combo of pecans and walnuts as I don't like cashews, but otherwise made as written.  Next time, I might add a dash of salt to just highlight the flavors.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe enhances the taste of fresh beans so much. 
Somehow they are light, sweet and savory at the same time. I sometimes do the nuts with bacon drippings and toss the bacon pieces into the beans, omitting the butter and keeping the honey. This is also really good with brussels sprouts. A definite keeper, thanks Donna!

I was having a hard time finding a recipe for my fresh green beans that don't involve cans of condensed soup and loads of cheese--this is PERFECT! The nutty cashew flavor, the butter and the slight sweetness from the honey really compliment the green beans without overpowering the fresh veggie taste. Even my children enjoyed it. A definite keeper!

I make it as written and this is the only green bean dish my 7 year-old will eat. It's become our go-to green bean recipe and is even making an appearance on our Thanksgiving table.

all my life beans with mushrooms. This is most tantalizing especially to compliment other side dishes or main dish.

Pretty Good, I steamed the green beans in the microwave to make it easier. I liked the cashew/honey mixture but I don't know if I liked it with green beans.

Unique flavor! Husband usually does not prefer sweetness in the flavor of vegetables, but this was an automatic favorite with him.  Used slivered almonds to cut down on cost.  Also, instead of steaming the beans, I threw them in with the almonds, butter, and honey.  Yum Yum!

This was just the "middle of the road" for me. I like it and will probably make it again, however, it wasn't like "wow, oh my goodness, this is great!" It was a very nice alternative to the usual. I served is with teriyaki pinapple chicken sandwiches and the sweetness of the honey was a nice compliment to the meal. I forgot to add the butter, but it was still good.

I never could have imagined pairing green beans with honey- but it works!  I love the sweetness.  I used roasted & salted almonds cause I didn't have cashews.  It turned out great.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was okay when I served it, but the second day as leftovers, it was really good.  Next time I may marinate the greenbeans(honey, salt and pepper) overnight and then cook and add cashews.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I used 2 cans of canned green beans instead of fresh and it was still outstanding. I could have eaten these for the main dish alone and been fully satisfied. This recipe will definitely go into my recipe box to be used over and over again.

These are good, not great, but good.  A little strange with the sweetness of the honey, but a good strange I guess.  :)

This is definitely a keeper.  I didn't have fresh green beans so used frozen haricots verts.  Simple to do but good enough for company.
