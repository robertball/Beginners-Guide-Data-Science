Excellent recipe as written. I didn't change anything. Doubled the batch so I could freeze some. Hoping that freezing won't change the consistency of it. Will make this again. Great comfort food for cold chilly weather.

We loved the flavor!!  My second batch I used a vegetable stock and some crisped tempeh bits(to replace the bacon fat and butter) and olive oil for the vegetarians in the family.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

Made this just as written and delivered to the shut-in elderly at my church. Got rave reviews from them all- might be the most popular soup I've given them so far! I'm going to try freezing some this time so I'll some on hand for myself!

Hubby and I really liked this, but 2.5 year old wouldn't eat it. Made some minor changes: all bacon grease instead of butter, 1/2 tsp dried thyme (total) instead of fresh, 1.25 tsp ground ginger instead of ginger paste, about 1/2 C OJ, and omitted the half-and-half (needed to make this non-dairy).

I've made this a few times now and love it!!  Didn't make it quite as spicy as I have before because hubby had a tooth out and needed something to slide down easily and it's so quick & easy - I thought I'd lay off the spicy this time .... before I use butter and olive oil (instead of bacon grease)  I MUST remember I have coconut oil in the cupboard (I put spoonful on pooch's food and his coat is really soft) - I didn't have onion so I used 3-onion spices from the cupboard  and powdered ginger instead of paste .... no other changes - absolutely delicious and is definitely my go-to soup recipe

This was delicious! I followed it almost to a tee except I used dried thyme, didn't have fresh, and I omitted the cinnamon because I thought it might overpower it. I think you could go without the bacon grease to make it healthier. I'm glad I doubled the recipe, made a big pot.

Loved it! Had to sub a few things based on what I had around - fresh grated ginger (3T), 2T butter (no grease), cream instead of half and half, and no red pepper (picky child doesn't like spice). This was very flavorful and filling, wonderful combination of flavors. It's a keeper recipe for me!

Yummy!  I didn't have fresh thyme so I used 1 tsp dried.  I had fresh ginger so I used about 1tbsp minced and added it half way through the saute of the onions.  I would double this next time!

Very good recipe! I added a bit too much fresh ginger as I did not have ginger paste. Yum-o!

Absolutely delicious. I forgot to buy cream so I swirled a spoonful of sour cream on top, but it didn't really need it. And instead of orange juice, I threw a quarter of an orange into the mix before blending. Wonderful meal with an arugula salad and whole wheat bread.

Beautiful autumn soup! Nice blend of heat from the crushed red pepper mixed with zip of the ginger paste. I added the leafy green bits from the carrot with the thyme leaves. Simple recipe to make.

A great base for a soup. This time, I did substitute butternut squash for the carrots, and used dry thyme instead of fresh. And I used too much red pepper flakes! But I love the base, and the layers of squash, sweet potatoes and ginger and thyme are awesome.

Tasty but be careful how much ginger you add.  I used fresh ginger . . . way to much fresh ginger!  My husband thought it was fabulous but I couldn't eat it.

THIS IS SO GOOD. I am vegetarian, so I snuck some chickpeas in for protein and made some adjustments. 
- Vegetable stock instead of chicken stock
- more butter instead of bacon grease
- extra ginger 
- half a can of chickpeas in at the same time as the sweet potatoes

This was really good. I felt like something was missing but not sure what... I didn't add bacon grease as I didn't have any so maybe that's what it was. I also added a can of coconut milk instead of half and half just per my personal taste and used fresh ginger instead of ginger paste. I will definitely make it again and try the bacon grease next time.

I  made this recipe  as posted  and would make it again but with fewer red pepper flakes. The flavour was great but the heat really  sneaks up on you!

I doubled the chicken broth - way to dense otherwise.  Used dried Thyme and ginger.  1 tablespoon of fresh orange juice was plenty.  Oh, and I added garlic.

Great recipe. I used a half inch square of fresh ginger root instead and 1/4 cup whole milk instead of half and half.  I put a dollop of greek yogurt in the middle to serve.  Great mix of spices in this soup!

Honestly, I made this just to add a pop of color to a meal I was preparing. Everyone loved it! I omitted the butter (but still used the bacon grease)  and because I had heavy whipping cream on hand for another dish I used a little of that instead of half and half. It's a wonderful balance of savory, sweet and a tinge of pepper. It was a hit. Upon request, i'm making it today for the second time this week!

Excellent soup, very flavourful and beautiful texture.  I replaced the brown sugar with honey. Next time I will omit the orange juice, I think it was distracting more than enhancing the taste but this is a matter of personal taste.

I love these flavours! I made a couple of small changes. I used about a tbsp of coconut oil instead of bacon fat. I didn't have any brown sugar, so I used a tbsp of maple syrup. I also added 1/4 tsp of tumeric for the health benefits, not the flavour. My only issue was that I should have took another reviewers advice and doubled the recipe!

Wonderful flavour. I did add 3 cloves crushed garlic after sauteeing the carrots and onion. Served with a dollop of full fat sour cream and crumbled bacon it was very very good.

I have to admit that as I was making this recipe I was questioning if I had chose the right recipe for what I wanted (used butter because I didn't have bacon grease, dried thyme, and grated ginger). However, once I added the orange, cinnamon, and brown sugar I was convinced that it would be delish. It's missing a little something to take it over the top - but I haven't figured out what just yet. This really is a nice soup!
