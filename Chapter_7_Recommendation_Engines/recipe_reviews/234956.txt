Made this for fun this weekend and although it tasted pretty good, some adjustments need to be made. The recipe as written needs to be used with a 10" Bundt pan or two smaller pans.  Using a non-stick spray is not usually a good idea for a pan and cake like this so I suggest butter and flour instead.  Cook time will be between 75 and 90 minutes.  Stand mixer is nice but not necessary though I do suggest using a hand mixer to thoroughly combine the ingredients.  The Kit Kats should be doubled or they get lost in the batter.  This really isn't a Kit Kat cake, more like a vanilla cake with Kit Kats.  The frosting is okay and does pour nice over the cake.  Over all, the flavor was pretty good and making it was pretty fun.

We all enjoyed this cake. It is very dense, and like the other reviews, it is basically a vanilla cake with crushed candy inside. I agree that you can double the candy if desired. The candies do take a back seat to the dense cake. I used Kit Kats, Whoppers, and Twix- basically a bunch of leftover Halloween candy, which is what I wanted to use up. You can mix and match with any chocolate candy to your tastes and it won't ruin the cake.

This is not a recipe that I would go out and buy Kit Kats for to make over and over again throughout the year, but I think this will be a yearly tradition for us to make out of Halloween candy.

Thanks for the recipe! Very tasty!
