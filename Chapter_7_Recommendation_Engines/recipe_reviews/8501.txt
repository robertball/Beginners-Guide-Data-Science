5 stars with my modifications: I marinated the chicken strips (we cut up 4 boneless, chicken breasts that I got on sale for 1.79/lb.) with a cup of hot sauce in a ziploc bag for a few hours before preparing. I doubled the flour mixture and barely had enough of the bread crumb mixture to cover the chicken. After baking, we tossed these in a mixture of 1 stick of melted butter and 1 cup of hot sauce, simmered together. These were spicy hot and outstanding! My 13 year old son remarked that he no longer needed to go to the local Ruby Tuesday's restaurant for their buffalo chicken tenders - that he would prefer to make ours! Thanks for a recipe that was fun for my son and I to make together and is not fried and more economical than eating out!

Ok, the recipe "as is" isn't bad... but it certainly wouldn't cure my craving for buffalo wings.  I think it only deserves three stars.  However, with some of the additions suggested by some of the reviewers, it is definitely a five-star (plus) recipe!!  I used Frank's instead of water in the egg mix.  When everything was cooked, I tossed the chicken fingers in a sauce made of 1/4 c melted Smart Balance Light margarine and 1/2 c Frank's Red Hot Sauce.  I also used panko bread crumbs (my first time cooking with them - I loved them!!  they made the chicken fingers so crunchy! -- and they looked fried after they were all covered with sauce...tricks the brain :).  These were AMAZING and I will definitely make anytime I get a craving!  (By the way, with my additions, this is still only 3 g fat and 97 calories per serving.)  UPDATE:  I brought into work today and have already gotten several requests for the recipe -- even the non-dieters love them!

These are really great chicken fingers. I make these every couple of weeks.  I do, however, make a few adjustments.  First, I use chicken tenderloins, just so I don't have to cut the chicken breasts.  Second, I melt 2 parts butter and 4 parts Frank's hot sauce.  I like my sauce hot, so use more butter if you want a less fiery sauce.  I dip the tenderloins in the buffalo sauce when they have about 1 minute of cooking left.  After they have been dipped, they go back in the oven for the last minute of cooking.  I then serve them on a bun for a lower fat buffalo chicken sandwich.

Tastes great for being low fat!!!  Very tender.  I substituted whole milk for the egg.  Also, I REALLY kicked them up (SPICY HOT) by coating them in authentic buffalo sauce after they came out of the oven and serving with blue cheese dressing.  The simple buffalo sauce recipe is 1/3 cup melted margarine + 1/2 cup Franks Red Hot Sauce (MUST be Franks) - Try this sauce if you like TRUE buffalo fingers (spicy).

I thought this was really good!  The chicken fingers came out nice and crispy.  I like mine saucy and hot...so I took a 1/4 c Crystal Louisiana hot sauce, a dash of cayenne, a dash of garlic powder and 1 tsp of butter..then microwaved it together till hot and poured it over my chicken..then tossed them.  Serve it right away..and it tastes just like the really fattening wings you get at restaurants!

Made these last evening for the SuperBowl. Everyone enjoyed them a lot. The changes I made: I didn't add water to the egg, but I DID add about two tablespoons of Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Sauce to the egg. Gave the fingers a little kick!

Great recipe. Based on reviews, I added Frank's hot sauce for the last 5 minutes of cooking. I used the leftovers the next day and made a buffalo chicken salad. Yummy and healthy.

This was sooo yummy with two alterations. I used crackers instead of bread crumbs (bread crumbs can get too sweet) and I maraniated the chicken in Tabasco Sause all day until it was time to cook dinner. My husband really liked it too!

I liked this recipe because it's a lot lower in fat than the many chicken strip recipes that require dipping the chicken in oil or butter, or that are fried.  It's not as crunchy as the high-fat versions, but still good.  I served this for dinner, so I just cut each breast half into 3 strips, instead of appetizer-size fingers.  I also used only a total of 1/4 t. cayenne, because I thought it might be too hot for my 8-year old otherwise.

OMG!  Five PLUS stars!  One reason I use Allrecipes is because of the reviews.  I usually read a handful of the positive reviews, and a handful of the negative.  Then, I read several of the most recent.  I enjoy the " most recent" reviews because these folks have seen enough reviews to formulate their plan for the recipe.  I accumulated several reviews, used their recommendations, and loves the results!  We are avid HOT chicken fingers connoisseurs and know what we like..  Here is what I learned and loved from the other reviewers:  1.  Double the bread crumb/flour mix.  2.  Use Panko brand bread crumbs. 3.  Marinate the tenders in Frank's (or comparable brand) sauce.  4.  Bake twice as long as recipe suggests (12 minutes at 400, flip and do 12 minutes more). 5.  Use the egg white ONLY (not the whole egg)  and beat it well. This will make them more crunchy.  6.  Bake on a rack on a baking sheet.  7.  Bake at 400 for 12 minutes, brush with more Frank's sauce, flip, and bake 12 more minutes.  8. To make the final marinade sauce for the tenders, melt 1/4 cup butter to 1/2 cup Franks sauce in a sauce pan.  Use this mixture to brush onto the tenders during the last 5 minutes of baking to add that extra hot flavor....  We loved this recipe, especially because it is more healthy than the deep fried chicken tender recipes. These come out HOT!   Thank you.

I cut boneless, skinless chicken breasts into strips and marinated them for 4 hours in Frank's Hot Sauce. I then added a tablespoon of Franks to a beaten egg, dumped the egg mixture in with the chicken(drained), dumped in a cup of panko bread crumbs and shook until covered. I baked in the oven until tender, drizzled wing sauce over all and baked another 10 minutes. They were a little hot for me, but my husband loved them. Next time, I would marinate them less, otherwise do the same. Great for game day!

I would just like to add my low fat version of this recipe that I get rave reviews over every time I make it.  Take plain chicken breast and cut into pieces that you want to work with.  Poke holes in the breast w/ a fork and pour Franks hot sauce on top of them and marinade for a short amount of time or long whatever you have time for.  Grill, bake for broil until done then serve w/ more Franks and blue cheese dressing (love Ken's unless you make your own).  Also good cold, as an appetizer or in a garden salad.

These are definitely not "buffalo" chicken fingers.  It is a nice start for a regular breaded chicken piece, but even then it lacks flavor.  I made some as is, and then followed suggestions of other reviewers:  make a sauce of 1 part melted butter, 2 parts wing sauce- after the chicken is mostly cooked, dip pieces in the sauce and cook for another 3-5 minutes.  I will keep the recipe for the procedure on breading which was good, but will continue to try to improved the flavor.  My non-buffalo chicken eating children liked them with sauce of some kind.

These were great! They came out VERY spicy (which I like) and crispy out of the oven. I tossed mine in some Franks Buffalo sauce after they were done cooking too. Just as good if not better than the finest pub food I've ever tasted! Thanks!

These are a super healthy substitute for fried chicken tenders, but the original recipe needs slight tweaking. i eyeball the spices and add/subtract to my taste- this recipe is super versatile! for buffalo tenders, definitely use hot sauce in the egg mixture instead of water, and dip the tenders in buffalo sauce before the last 5ish minutes of baking (buffalo sauce = 1 part butter, melted + 2 parts franks red hot sauce). i also make a bbq variety for those who dont like spicy food- beat your fave bbq sauce into egg mixture instead of water, and dip the tenders in 1 part butter, melted + 2 parts bbq sauce before last 5ish mins of baking.  These dont come out super crispy like the fried version, but they're still really tasty. I always use panko instead of breadcrumbs, just because thats what i have on hand. Have already made these twice, and will def. make again. Thanks for a great, easy, and versatile recipe!!

These were delicious! I made some of the modifications listed in the reviews and loved them! 

Modifications:
-Used chicken tenderloins (pk. of 7) instead of whole breasts. SO much easier and the perfect size.
-Doubled the flour mixture and bread crumbs. I had a lot left over and could have made more chicken fingers if I had more chicken. I will probably always double it, just to have enough.
-Mixed Frank's Hot Sauce with the eggs (two eggs, 1 tablespoon of hot sauce). LOVED this! I might use a little more hot sauce next time, but was cautious the first time because I don't like things too spicy. 
-Used panko bread crumbs instead. YUM! So nice and crunchy.

Cook time was spot on. Yay! Next time, I will marinate the chicken in hot sauce (might try buffalo sauce...) just to get the flavor all the way through. Once you got past the breading, it was just the chicken flavor. Not bad at all but want to try again with marinading it.

Paired with the perfect Ranch dip and these were a hit!!

These were good! I did as other reviewers and added hot sauce to the egg mixture instead of water. I couldn't decide between reg. breadcrumbs or panko, so I mixed them both and used that. I'm glad I did because the panko gave a nice crunch to the chicken. My only complaint is that I wish they would've browned more, but other than that this was a tasty recipe. Thanks for sharing. :)

These weren't bad at all! As a matter of fact, my hubs and I actually thought these were quite tasty. :) While we both prefer fried tenders and agree that nothing compares to the original deep-fried version, these were a darn good considering they are baked, not fried! Having said this, I do think I'll (pan) fry my chicken fingers next time (personal preference).... I must admit, I made several changes. Without my changes, I'm not sure these would have been as good. As another reviewer did, I also marinated my chicken in (Frank's) buffalo wing sauce (for 24+ hours because dinner plans changed). My second change was to use tenderloins instead of cutting chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces (seemed more appropriate and less time consuming). My next change was DOUBLING the flour / breading mixtures (an absolute must, IMHO). My final change was subbing Panko crumbs for plain ones and Frank's wing sauce for the water called for in the egg wash. My fingers baked up perfectly in the suggested 16 minute timeframe. NOTE: I feared that I marinated my chicken far too long (it looked somewhat cooked when I took it out of the Zip-Lock bag), but to my surprise, it was just fine. Turns out, marinating for a VERY long time produces the most AWESOME, melt-in-your-mouth, fork-tender chicken!!!!! Loaded potato skins rounded out our casual meal. I felt like I was eating at the famous chain (ambiance aside haha)! Thanks for sharing your easy and yummy recipe, Bobbi Jo! :-)

What a great recipe. It's even easier if you use chicken tenders. Japanese Panko bread crumbs are extra crunchy and my family loves them.

Easy quick and we made sandwiches with this chicken. The amount of Hot was just right for someone that is not a fan and we did cook them about 15 min more.

I was pleasantly surprised at how easy and great tasting these were.  I followed the recipe without modifications.  Only thing different I did was to raise the rack and broil the chicken for a few minutes when done baking to brown and crisp them up a little bit.  Nice to make something that is so yummy without being tons of calories!!

These are delicious! The recommendations of other reviewers bumped this bland (sorry!) recipe up to five stars. I like the flavor of buffalo sauce, although I can't handle too much of it. As suggested, I marinated the chicken in Frank's Buffalo Sauce, substituted the water for sauce in the egg wash, and covered one side of the chicken pieces with a Smart Balance and buffalo sauce mixture towards the end of baking. If you prefer more heat, definitely coat both sides. Cooking time was perfect. This is a keeper for sure!

Pretty good chicken fingers. I didnt think they were very much like buffalo chicken, i guess you need to add more spices or add hot sauce to your egg. I put some butter on the bottom of the pan because i do not like dry breadcrumbs and the butter helped keep the breading on. I will make these again.

Very tasty! I took the hint from a couple of other reviewers and added buffalo wing sauce. Instead of using the egg whites, to moisten, I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wing sauce and it was amazing! Pretty spicy but exactly the taste I was looking for. The men in my house went nuts over these. Will make again.

Really good and even better because low fat. I end up making these every other week, they are great with low fat mashed potatoes and a salad.  I marinate the chicken in some buffalo sauce and cayenne pepper beforehand and then add buffalo sauce onto chicken after it is done. I like it super spicy though!

This recipe is delightful. Four stars as is, though it is a five-star recipe with one easy addition. I used half the amount of cayenne (she did say to use more or less to taste) as a whole teapoon of cayenne kinda scared me a bit. The addition that I'd make -- and that other reviewers suggested -- was to add the hot sauce. I used 1/4 cup each of Louisiana Crystal Hot Sauce and no-transfat margarine and heated them together (also added about 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch to give the sauce some body) and tossed the cooked chicken fingers in it until the fingers were coated. Serve with bleu cheese or ranch dressing. It was a huge hit at the dinner table. Thank you for the recipe, Bobbi.

My family really didn't care for these. The seasoning is WAY off from traditional "Buffalo-Style" seasoning, and that's coming from someone who is from Buffalo!!

Very good flavor!  Made these per the recipe and will make again.  Only problem was the coating sticking to the sheet when I turned them, even though I greased well.  Once I figure that out these will be perfect!

This was fantastic! I was wanting buffalo wings but didn't have chicken wings so decided to try this. I marinated the chicken for a day in hot sauce then followed the recipe as written except I used the full egg not just the whites. The flour mixture wasn't nearly enough so next time I will double it. I was worried they wouldn't be very spicy without a butter hot sauce mixture on them but boy was I wrong! Woo were they hot & just the way I like them! Awesome & healthy it was a win win!!!! Will definitely make them again!

We simplified the recipe and just slathered 2 sliced-up chicken breasts in 1 egg, rolled the breasts in Italian bread crumbs, then dipped the breaded chicken in Frank's RedHot Buffalo sauce. Amazing! We poured a little cup of the buffalo sauce for dipping, but barely needed it.

I actually marinated them in a texas pete buffalo chicken wing hot sauce for about two hours before hand. The breading was a little fragile but these were absolutely amazing. my husband is having me put this on the "definitely make again soon" list.

Amazing!!  Like some of the others, I added Franks sauce to the egg mix (skipped the flour mix and used the whole egg, not just the whites only because i'm lazy) and added some Franks sauce to the Panko bread crumbs too (maybe a tsp?).  I wanted the sauce to bake into the fingers.  It took more bread crumbs this way, but was a thicker coating and they stayed on better since i didn't use the flour.

loved them!

My whole family loves this recipe...even my 4 yr old. Only change I make is don't add water to the egg...too thin and 50/50 mix of Italian bread crumbs and Italian Panko bread crumbs.

Good with some tweaks, i added hot sauce to the egg mix instead of water and basted tenders with hot sauce during last minute of cooking. Had a problem with keeping them crispy though, even using panko

I made these last night just to try them with pizza.  They were really good.  I did however, double the cayenne and garlic powder.  After they were done I drenched them with hot wing sauce(from the bottle) no butter so as not to change the fat content and only a few more calories.  Overall a good low fat recipe....... I made them again tonight!!!

I was going to give this 3 stars, but upped it to 4 because it was the only dish to be completely devoured by the end of the night!  I wish I had read some of the other reader recommendations before making this.  They were great as plain chicken fingers, but were definitely lacking with the buffalo.  I mixed hot sauce (next time will try Frank's!) into the egg mixture which helped add a little kick.  Next time I make them I will make a few alterations per other suggestions here. I will marinate them in a hot sauce mixture for a few hours.  Then with a couple minutes of cooking left, I will dip them in hot sauce and put them back in the oven.  I did serve it with blue cheese dressing and everyone loved them.  My friends were so surprised to find out I made them from scratch!

I have my own wing sauce recipe so I did use that for the sauce but the breading method outlined in this recipe is excellent! It is a much lower in fat that most deep-fried chicken finger recipes out there. I will be using this method again for sure!

Very good! Not at all greasy. If you drizzle some of the wing sauce on afterward and dip in blue cheese dressing, it's very yummy. Will make again.

I took the advice of another by coating the chicken with Franks hot sauce before serving and, WOW! They tasted like restaurant style buffalo strips. (with a lot less fat) Next time, I will make this with the chicken breast pounded thin to make a buffalo chicken sandwich!  Yummy!

I did marinate my chicken in wing sauce, I used panko for the bread crumbs, and brushed them with more wing sauce the last five minutes of baking. Thank you for all the reviews that gave this advise of the wing sauce...makes it a five star recipe without all the calories of frying. The chicken did take twice as long to bake than the directions specified.

5* with modifications/added 2T FRANK's brand Louisiana sauce to the egg mixture and removed the cayenne pepper. It made it spicier. Served with Blue cheese salad dressing for dipping. Yummy!

When I make this recipe I do exactly what it tells me to do  Then I combine Franks Red Hot sauce, Tabasco and butter in a sauce pan on a low flame. Or you can use which ever hot sauce you have in the house. The I brush on the hot sauce mix on the chicken, bake for another 5 mins and then remove from oven. Let sit for 5 mins to cool off and serve. With the left over cutlets I cut them and add to a salad for lunch the next day. Yummy!!

This was a great, the key is Panko Bread Crumbs (Parmesan Herb) for a crunchy texture. Awesome for sandwiches. Definitely a keeper.

I did what other reviewers did:  used panko crumbs, used Frank's hot sauce instead of the water.  I needed more flour and bread crumbs than the recipe called for.  The recipe is flavorful.  I will use it again.

Quick and easy chicken to make, had a nice crisp.  I used way more cayenne pepper than called for and if I make it again will use even more to get it nice and spicy.  I like it HOT!!

I really was not impressed with this one.  I read reviews, took suggestions and applied them such as doubling up on the flour mix (you really need to) I used a whole egg, not just whites, that worked fine, used hot sauce instead of water,  and the bread crumbs I made myself.  Chicken turned out moist and good but this did not turn out crispy at all.  There was only a slight hint of flavor it it, and I actually added more of the seasoning by accident to the bread crumbs.  I could possibly try another suggestion to let the chicken hang out in some hot sauce prior, and maybe use panko or cornflakes for a more crispy crunch to it.  I will try it again, but not this recipe.  Just too much to change to get it to a 5 star in my book.

Absolutely heavenly. I made this for my boyfriend as a tasty snack and he gushed over how amazing they tasted, claiming that they were far better than anything he's had in a restaurant. I definitely agree. The key for me was to refridgerate the chicken after coating it in the crumbs for about 20 minutes. Some breading still stuck (woe is me, always happens with me!) but it was still by far the best wings I've ever made. I recommend this to anyone who has the extra time to put into it, from novice to experienced cooks. It's a keeper for us, thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe as prepared as written exactly is a 3-star.  The "buffalo" flavor is very faint.  However, the recipe as written is a great base recipe to build from because it is much healthier than something you would order in a restaurant.  I would definitely make this again and add Frank's Hot Sauce to the egg whites instead of the water.

These are perfect!  My boyfriend and I have made them three times in the last month.  We use Frank's in place of the water in the egg wash as well as coat them in a mix of half Frank's and butter after they come out of the oven.  They are spicy and crispy!

This was tasty! I took the advice of other posters and added more bread crumbs. I was a little disappointed with the level of crunchiness. The flavor was delicious

Very good!  Did not follow directions properly.  Dipped in dry ingredients, then whole egg with Franks, then dry ingredients again.  Dipped in buffalo sauce and ranch.  Will be making again!

These turned out great. I did as others suggested and did part planko and part bread crumbs. Also substituted franks hot sauce instead of water in egg mixture. We all loved them.

We thought these were great!  I did replace the breadcrumbs with panko and definitely needed to double the breadcrumb mixture to coat all the chicken.  These had a nice spice, though I like it hot so I used Franks as a dipping sauce afterwards, rather than cooking it in as other reviewers suggested so I could serve to my 13 month old.  They were a hit all around!  Will definitely make these again!

My husband LOVED this recipe!  I made it the first time without adding any sort of sauce to it and it was a little bland.  Tried a reviewer's suggestion of making a 'buffalo sauce' of butter and hot sauce and dipping the chicken before serving and it added the perfect amount of heat.  Also substituted the 1T of water for hot sauce.  Definitely a 'keeper' in my house!

Very good.  I took another reviewers advice and basted them with Texas Pete's hot sauce and let them cook another minute.  Would be perfect in a buffalo chicken salad!!!

I needed some chicken fingers for sticky fingers and decided to go with this recipe. These turned out great! We will definitely keep this recipe for the future whether it be for for regular fingers or sticky fingers. I don't know if it was because my chicken breasts were huge or because I used panko bread crumbs, but I had to make 3 batches of the bread crumb mix to cover all of my chicken. Otherwise I had no problems. I did take the tip of substituting the water with Franks hot sauce and thought that was great... definitely adds to the "buffalo" flavor

Overall, this was a pretty good recipe.  I made my own changes to make it a FIVE STAR.  After I baked the chicken tenders I tossed them in a mixture of Franks Red Hot Sauce and melted butter.  IT was AMAZING!  My entire family just LOVED them.  I will be making these over and over! Yummy!

Awesome, awesome awesome!  I loved these and will definitely make them again!  I did make a few modifications.  I doubled the flour mixture and bread crumb mixture and used panko.  I was pretty liberal with the cayenne seasoning and cooked them five minutes longer in the oven then finished them for one minute in the broiler on each side to add cripyness.  Then I tossed the ones my husband and I were going to eat in frank's buffalo sauce mixed with a little melted I can't believe it's not butter.  Served with a salad!  It was too spicy still for the kids but perfectly hit the mark for my buffalo chicken craving without all the bones and added fat!  Thanks for submitting!  Really great!

I read all the reviews and decided to try this.  I even made the hot sauce using butter and Frank's.  I just didn't like them, they tasted like cayenne pepper to me.  Not at all like buffalo wings.  Def did not satisfy my craving for wings.  Sorry

The chicken was juicy and delicious, but even with adding tabasco sauce, there was no flavor at all.  More like baked chicken fingers, not buffalo chicken fingers

This is one of the better chicken finger recipes I have tried, and I have tried MANY!  I did make a little sauce on the side (Frank's hot sauce, melted butter and little cornstarch) for the adults, but my eleven year old loved it "as is".  Came out nice and crispy and golden from the oven.  Will definitely be making these again. Yum! :)

This was really easy and really good, fed a party.  We didn't toss them in any sauce, but had an array of things to dip them in.  Alrdy in my recipe box and in regular rotation.  Only change I made to the recipe was a few dashes of tabasco in the egg whites, and it made a nice bite.

I skipped the garlic powder and marinated the chicken in buffalo wing sauce for 2 hours prior to cooking. I mixed some of the left over wing sauce in with the egg whites to add in even more flavor and drizzled the rest of the remaining sauce over the breaded chicken before cooking. It turned out wonderfully!  Thanks to another reviewer for the marinating tip! :)

I used a whole egg and subbed Franks' hot sauce for the water. Pretty good, took longer than stated time.

You'll need a bit more of the flour mixture and probably DOUBLE the crumbs.  I tried 1/2 w/Panko and 1/2 seasoned bread crumbs....both were good; the Panko is def crunchier.  I sprayed the strips w/Pam and baked on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet to keep them from getting gooey Then dipped in Frank's and baked last 3-4 minutes.  In order to be "buffalo", it does need the Frank's, but next time I'd try the Franks mixed in w/the egg.  It was VERY powerful when soaked into the crumbs and took away some of the crispiness.   Otherwise...great idea for a healthier take on one of my fav's!

I like the crunchiness of these, but they really don't have much flavor. They're only a little bit spicy, so that's the only real flavor I get. I would add more spices next time.

It makes me sad to say that we really didn't care for these at all. I found them too dry and the texture wasn't crispy enough. Maybe if dipped in hot sauce to coat the crumbs? But definitely need hot sauce/ranch to dip them in afterwards. Not for us thanks.

Overall pretty good. I tend to like things spicier so it could have used more in my opinion but also, I had to think of everyone else that was eating and it was a mixed bag of people. Some did want it spicier, others thought it was fine. Rather than put the sauce all over it at the end, I did serve it on the side for those that really wanted to douse their chicken. Certainly was easy and I will make again.

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I did make some buffalo wing sauce (1/2 margerine, 1/2 buff. wing sauce simmered together) and dunked mine in the sauce at the end of baking. The rest of the fam deosn't like things too spicy so they opted out of the sauce. To make this recipe prep time go quicker I made a few alterations. I used chicken tenderloin strips. I put the flour mixture in a ziploc baggie, then placed all the chix inside. Shake to coat. Then I took the egg mixture (which I substituted the H2O for hot sauce) and dumped it in the bag and shook to coat. Perfect amount. Then I dumped in the bread crumb mixture and shook to coat. Perfection! Using a fork, or tongs I placed them on a greased cookie sheet and cooked per recipe instructions. Prep time was cut in 1/2 and they came out great. Crispy and tender. Yummy!

The only problem I have with this recipe is the name. I'm from Buffalo, NY and if you want a true "buffalo" chicken fingers you need hot sauce. Without it it's just a spicy chicken finger.

My husband and I love this recipe. I add smaller pieces to salad to make buffalo chicken salad. The only thing I do differently with the recipe is about 1/4 cup hot sauce to the egg mixture. It enhances that buffalo chicken taste.

I replaced the egg w/ hot wing sauce. I tried the egg, but it just made the hot sauce come off and the flour mixture was getting wet enough. I used Panko bread crumbs. I just made a small batch for myself, and plan on having the leftovers over a spinach salad for lunch today. I think my family will love this recipe too! I've been craving hot wings, and this is definately on my diet!

Love this recipe! My husband and I are on a diet and this is our new go-to recipe to satisfy our cravings for buffalo wings.  (But obviously if you want real buffalo wings you should just make those-- these are not the same.)

My only change is that I added some paprika to the flour and bread crumb mixtures (out of habit) and I added a healthy dose of Frank's Red Hot Sauce to the finished product.  Also, I had to cook our strips for about 5 minutes longer than specified, but our strips were pretty thick ( I made 8 from about a pound of chicken breasts). Thanks for sharing!

This recipe really has nothing "buffalo" about it.  Its a good base recipe for strips though.  I made them and then dipped them in buffalo sauce (franks and butter) and served them with blue cheese and celery.

These are the best chicken fingers I have ever made.  The breading didn't come off, it was a good way to make them.  The chicken remained very tender, and juicy.  Very Good!

I agree, kind of a bland coating, but it is much healthier and easier than "true" fried buffalo wings or tenders.  Next time I will try adding Frank's Hot Sauce to the egg mixture and see how that works.

I put a sauce made of lots of hot suace, butter, brown sugar, and fresh garlic on top of these for the last 8 min. of cooking and they turned out great. Everyone at the superbowl party loved them. For the extra healthy people I made a batch with I can't believe it's not butter light and they turned out good too.

Bland, dry, and not very good at all by itself. I guess I was hoping for more of the actual "buffalo" taste. These would be good with actual buffalo sauce, but the sauce would make the dish more than the chicken.

This is a perfect quick and easy recipe when your in the mood for appetizers for dinner!  I used crushed corn flakes in place of the bread crumbs and also added black pepper to the garlic powder, salt, cayenne mixture.  The corn flakes give it a great crunchy texture!  I served them with a buffalo and blue cheese dipping sauce.

I gave this recipe five stars, but only because I followed the advice of some of the other reviews. I used crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs and I tossed the nuggets in a mixture of Frank's Hot Sauce and melted butter with a minute or so left to bake. They were spicy and delicious and way healthier than fried buffalo chicken.

My boyfriend made these the other day.  I didnt try them, because I am a vegetarian, but they looked good to me! ^-^  He said they were a little salty but not flavorful, and dry.  We added a little more cayenne pepper than called for, but maybe the peppers didnt have enough time to heat up.  Overall they were good, and we'll make them again, but with a little flavor modification! Thanks!

This was a very easy recipe.  It seems like it would be much more healthy than regular buffalo chicken strips.  I made the strips and then used them in a pita sandwhich.  My husband (who is VERY picky) also loved them.

Very good. Nice served w/icy cold celery and a quality bottled or homemade blue-cheese dressing.
My family enjoyed...we'll have it often.

This wasn't quite spicy enough for our taste, but I'll definitely be making it again, with a few alterations.

I only gave this 3 stars- not because it was bad, but because it was alot of work for a pretty bland taste.  I did use crushed red pepper b/c I didn't have cayenne and maybe that's why. (is there a difference??) If you buy a good quality breast meat chicken nugget you'll have a better taste and it'll be much easier.  Not a keeper for me.

This recipe was really good! A little too spicy for us so next time we will reduce the cayenne. We will be making again! Thanks Bobbi Jo!

This is fast and easy to make, but they tend to be dry. Just remember to serve them right out of the oven, and serve different sauces also. I have made them twice now, and I prefer to use less cayenne pepper.

This was so easy and delicious!  Definitely double the breading ingredients.  I used two chicken breasts instead of four, but kept the breaded part the same and I had just enough flour, egg mixture, and breadcrumbs to go around.  I used panko and these were crispy and moist.  Great recipe!

Really good chicken fingers. I couldn't resist someone's suggestion of brushing with a mixture of butter and frank's hot sauce mixture, popped back in the oven for about 5 mins.

I agree with the RedRobynNAU. The panko and adding the hot sauce to the egg mixture did the trick. I did not toss in the butter/hot sauce, but wish I did, as mine were not hot enough for my taste. Finally, a good baked alternative to fried buffalo chicken!

Im only giving this two stars cause the recipe it self is plan boring not much taste. I also had to use more flour . Its good base recipe (flour,egg,bread everyone knows the basic breading) but def change things... tired again but my own way. I like things hot so I let the chicken sit in hot sauce and bbq over night after i beated the chicken and cut the chicken. That gave the chicken a whole new flavour that wasnt bread. I also just used the whole egg not just the whites. I then changed the pepper to plain pepper added a special epicure spice and used premade seasoned bread crumbs also cooked lower at 350 for longer time   CAME OUT AMAZING

I always marinate my chicken in a buttermilk/Franks hot sauce mixture overnight then pat dry before coating. Make sure to beat the egg white until foamy as this helps make an extra crispy coating. I use Panko instead of bread crumbs and used more seasoning than the recipe calls for. I place my coated chicken on rack over the cookie sheet and spray with chicken with olive oil from my misto just before baking. I bake at 450 for 12 min, flip and bake another 12 min!

Excellent! I made Gluten Free so I could eat with the family and it was superb! So, instead of flour....i used corn starch.  Instead of bread crumbs, I used crushed Rice Chex. Add a little more hot sauce to the egg mixture (i used whole eggs) and my family raved about this recipe.  I will definately make again!!!! Thank you!

Loved this recipe.  I did take the suggestion someone else made about marinating the chicken in Frank's Hot Sauce for a couple of hours before preparing this dish. I also brushed the chicken with melted butter & Frank's Hot Sauce for the last 2 minutes while they finished baking.  These were even good reheated.

These were SO good. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is they were a little spicier than I thought they would be. But I will definitely make them again, and just use a little less of the spices.

Per many of the comments I tossed with favorite buffalo sauce and small amount of melted butter mixture after baking.  Will work as a healthier version of a family favorite.

These were very yummy!  I read some of the other reviews and added in some of their suggestions, I DEFINITELY would double the coating, I barely had enough crumbs after doubling it.  Flour mixture doesnt need doubling.  I tried half of them plain as the recipe instructs and the other half I dipped in a mixture of 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup buffalo wing sauce then put back in the oven for the last 6ish minutes of the bake time.  I found that the ones that I dipped were not as crunchy, kinda mushy, and the ones without the dip were still spicy but nice and crunchy.  I think next time Ill make them without dipping them in the hot sauce mixture and use the hot sauce as a side dip instead.  Great recipe though and I would definitely make again!!

Love! Love! Love! This recipe is a hit in my home. I followed the recipe yet made a few modifications after reading other reviews. I seasoned my chicken, flour,and bread crumbs. I marinated my chicken in one cup of hot sauce and	half an onion - chopped. I also used more flour and bread crumbs than stated. Instead of mixing the egg with water I used milk. When the chicken was almost done, I mixed a half cup of hot sauce and a stick of butter together and poured it over the chicken. Cook for about three more minutes. Eat with Ranch  Dressing.

I made this tonight and it was really good. I might add a little more hot sauce but thats my personal preference. Really enjoyed this tonight. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I think I would call them 'spicy' rather than 'buffalo,' but my 6 year old eats them up and so does my husband!  Good stuff.

I made a double batch of these.  First one exactly by the recipe.  It was good, tasty but not quite as strong a buffalo flavor as my family hoped for.  Second batch I added Dry Buttermilk Ranch Seasoning (AR recipe) to the flour dredge.  I also added Franks Wing Sauce (not the plain hot) to the egg wash.  I added a bit of celery salt to the bread crumbs (homemade fresh - not pre-toasted).  They were much more flavorful!  We had them served on my Good-n-crusty roll recipe (in my recipe box) with blue cheese dressing and some thinly sliced celery.  Will be making these again with my changes.

WOW - really good and I like the fact that they are not deep fried. I would like them to be crispier and will try broiling and maybe panko crumbs but the flavor is right there. I did pre-soak them in wing sauce and once cooked I coated them with a hot sauce/butter mixture and baked a few minutes longer.

Good recipe. I didn't have any problem with the amount of flour the original recipe calls for. Panko breadcrumbs and using Frank's instead of water were the directions I went. My only problem is that I didn't find these to be very crispy so will need to work on that some more. Perhaps finishing under broil will do the trick. Thanks for sharing this.

This is a simple recipe that is easy to make your own. I made half of my batch of chicken strips plain for my 3 year old niece and the other half I tossed in Frank's Red Hot Sauce after cooking. It was inexpensive and easy to make.

I've made this recipe 3 times so far. The first time I used another reviewers  suggestion to use panko bread crumbs instead of bread, use melted smart balance and mix that with franks wing sauce  (dip them last few minutes of cooking.) Came out better than any restaurant I've ever had! Second time I didn't really cut the chicken breast into small enough strips so it ended up being really bland. Then the third, the same way i did it like the first.. fantastic again! Love LOVE this recipe.. my husband craves it! Now instead of pizza and wings .. we have these with pizza!

WOW THIS WAS AMAZING... Only additions I made was like what others wrote about marinating in red hot sauce 1st and I also used the whole EGG not just white... Also added butter to top after cooking in oven for 7 minutes so that it did not look too dry on outside.. I like the crust to be crunchy... I am going to make this ALL THE TIME...

Having a Sunday, Monday, Thursday...Saturday football party, make these! I like making regular buffalo chicken wings, but I hate the frying and mess it causes in the kitchen. Thank God for this recipe. Spicy, tender, and a great finger food for any party occasion. One note I would make is to brush the chicken fingers with some butter or margarine while cooking, flipping them over half way baking and giving the back of fingers a little coat of butter as well. This will make the fingers a little more crispy.

When the pieces were nearly baked, I dipped them in a mix of melted butter and Frank's hot sauce (1/4 C each) I think they would have been pretty bland without that. I thought they were still just o.k.

DELICIOUS!  I was out of eggs so instead of the eggs and water mixture, I used about 1/4 cup milk and 2 tablespoons of Franks Buffalo Wing Sauce.  I also used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs for the coating.  I used the idea of other reviews and while the chicken was baking,I melted together 1/4 cup of Smart Balance butter with 1/2 cup Franks Buffalo Wing Sauce.  I dipped half of the strips in the sauce and placed them back in the oven for another minute.  This definitely made them more like boneless wings.  The others were delicious chicken fingers with a kick.  I will definitely be making these again!!

These are great - as good as a restaurant! I followed the advice of some others: I did not use cayenne pepper (kids were eating them); used 1 T hot sauce in eggs instead of water; used panko bread crumbs instead of regular. Baked chicken on wire racks to keep the bottom crispy. When about 5 mintes left to bake, coated chicken in hot sauce mixture (1/2c franks hot sauce & 1/4c butter), then put back in oven for remaining 5 min. They are delicious!  I've made as chicken tenders as well as bonesless breasts (thin cut). Both ways are great! My kids have already asked to have them again! *Note: I also make one breast with BBQ (for 7 yr old) instead of the hot sauce (coat chicken w/ BBQ sauce last 5 min instead of hot sauce) Good this way too!

Based on other reviews, I did substitute the water for 2 T of Franks Red Hot...These are just perfect!  Without the Franks, I do not believe these would have had enough "zing", but tonight they were just buffalo enough, without being too hot for my 20 month old.  Cut each breast into thirds.  I am a calorie counter, so when cooking, I usually pair my meals with something "calorie ridden" that the hubby can still enjoy, and myself a small serving.  We had these with steamed broccoli and HIGHLY reccomend pairing with Pioneer Woman's Perfect Au Gratin Potatoes...they cook at the same temp!  Already copied this to the recipe book!

These were excellent and my husband love it, and he doesn't normally care for buffalo styled chicken anything.  Just changed a few things.  I added ½ teaspoon pepper and ½ teaspoon paprika to the flour.  After baking the chicken for 10 minutes on each side brush Frank's hot sauce on both sides and turn after 5 min.  (Use approximately ¼ cup of hot sauce), Ended up cooking for almost 30 min. Served with sour creaam.

Good as written. Although not similar to what most people think of when they think of buffalo chicken strips its more like a healthier cheaper version of shake and bake (though not as crispy in my experience) with a mild spicy kick. If your really into spicy food I would definitely recommend increasing the cayenne pepper or adding something as others suggested like franks red hot hot sauce. Also although it also defeats the purpose of trying to stay low fat, rather than baking I think this would be great if it was fried with a little olive oil in a pan. This recipe was pretty easy to do even for a beginner and not too time consuming. I would make this in the future If I was frying it otherwise I'd probably just save some time and just use shake and bake.

Excellent. I did use milk and a little Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce in the egg instead of water. Dipped my husband's strips in aforementioned sauce mixed with melted butter and then baked a few more minutes. Both ways were delicious. Thank you!

OMG yum!  with a couple small modifications - use Panko for a real restaurant-like crust, and double the breadcrumb recipe.  When a couple minutes of cook time remain, toss the fingers in sauce (1 part butter or marg melted with 2 parts Franks or your favorite buffalo sauce), pop back in the oven for the remaining cook time, and voila, you'll never need to go out for buffalo tenders again.  THANK YOU for this recipe!  UPDATE: the cold leftover fingers are awesome, either by themselves or on a sandwich. Yum!  make a double recipe just to have the leftovers.

SO simple and delicious! I made the same amount of breading, flour, and egg mixtures but had enough for 6 breast halves.  Also, I like a bit more SPICE! So, once they were done cooking, I tossed these chicken fingers in a mixture on 1/3 cup melted margarine and 1/2 cup Frank's HOT sauce. Absolutely DELICIOUS! My favorite way to eat these it to wrap them with lettuce inside a whole wheat tortilla and dip in ranch/bleu cheese dressing-YUM! Thanks SO much for the great recipe! Definitely a keeper :)

These were pretty good. My husband never had "dry" buffalo fingers and wanted to put a sauce on them. But I encouraged him to try them as is and overall he liked them. I appreciated that these were lower in fat and they came out crispy even though they were baked. We will make these again. Thanks.

So yummy! I didn't have cayenne so I used a Cajun seasoning, and only had garlic salt not powder so I didnt add any extra salt. Used crushed up crackers instead of bread crumbs. SOOOOOOO moist and tender! Reheated leftovers in the oven on broil the next day so they wouldnt be soggy- still really good but not as good as right out of the oven the first time. May make them a little less spicy next time and leave most of the hotness/ spiciness for a sauce.

I used a splash of Tabasco sauce mixed with water, and Panko Bread Crumbs (it was all I had) and my family LOVED them…they were great!!!

Very good.  I used wing sauce in the egg mixture instead of water.  Very good on a salad.

We thought these were ok.  I added some extra spices to give them more flavor.  I also marinated them for a couple of hours in hotsauce/ranch dressing, which was good flavor, but then the crunchy bread crumbs basically fell off the chicken.  I won't marinate next time.

this is a really fabulous alternative to fried fingers. i don't have a deep fryer, so if we want chicken fingers i usually have to use a cast iron skillet full of oil. needless to say...it makes a huge mess! the only thing i have done differently to this recipe (after the 1st time) is use a bit of olive oil on the baking sheet and a bit to drizzle. i definitely appreciate the recipe for the 0.05% fat factor. however, the breading was a but too dry for my taste.

My kids liked these but I thought they lacked flavor.  I'll make again because they are easy but I'll add a lot more cayenne.

This is 5 stars when following other reviewers tips:  Replace the water for Frank's sauce and make the sauce with Franks and butter.  Will take these over the top!  Also, increase the amount of breadcrumbs to 1 1/2 cups.  There was definitely not enough for all the chicken, and I even used 1 full cup.

A wonderful, healthy chicken fingers recipe. I wouldn't exactly call it "buffalo," but it's good. I make them normal to feed my kids and then coat mine and hubby's in Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce - YUM!

Really good.  The only change I made is that when the chicken was almost done, I put a buffalo sauce made with Franks hot sauce and a little butter (cooked to combine flavors and thicken a little) on top and put back in the oven for the rest of the time.

Awesome!  I used panko bread crumbs and frank's hot sauce.  Otherwise made them exactly as written.  DH raved over them.  You MUST like hot, spicy food though.

I have been searching for a specific buffalo chicken. These weren't what I was hoping but they were very good. I drizzled a mix of butter and hot sauce over them to make them more like "buffalo" chicken. FYI mine did not brown, as I expected. If I had waited (I used a temperature probe)until they were browned, they would have been overcooked.

This recipe is similar to one in a Rachael Ray magazine I have.  I left out the cayenne pepper for my kids. Added some salt and pepper to the breadcrumbs.  You could omit the flour step and just dip twice in the breadcrumbs.  I made a sauce of 1 Tbsp melted butter and 1 Tbsp hot sauce.  After browning the chicken in a skillet for about 5 minutes, I finished baking it at 350 for 10 minutes in the oven.  Drizzle the sauce over the chicken.  I really liked this recipe since my children could dip theirs in ranch or bbq and my husband and I could enjoy it buffalo style.

I used about double the garlic and cayenne than the recipe called for.  Mine also baked for about 10 minutes per side (maybe I had thicker chicken.) They were spicy and tasted great with some spicy honey mustard and ranch to dip them in.

This recipe was very simple and didn't require much work. It uses ingredients that I always have on hand. I used fresh chicken tenders instead of breasts. I baked them for exactly 8 minutes on each side and the chicken came out very juicy and full of flavor. I am a buffalo sauce fan so I heated up 4 tablespoons of butter and 1 cup of Frank's Red Hot Chicken Wing Sauce and spooned it over the strips upon serving. I dipped the strips into homemade blue cheese and it tasted amazing! I took some to work today and ate it inside a wheat pita pocket. Delicious!!!

I wanted to like this so much better.  I took some of the suggestions from others and bathed the chicken in Red Hot before coating.  I LOVE Red Hot, but I couldn't even finish these.  I'm not sure why, but I really did not like them.

Very good, I used chicken tenderloins so I didn't have to cut anything.  I added some hot sauce in with the egg mixture for some added kick.  They still weren't very spicy, next time I'll add more.

Definitely use the butter/Franks hot sauce mixture but if you are only cooking for 2, use less than the 1/3 cup:1/2 cup ratio (we had tons of extra sauce)  EXCELLENT!

My husband and I thought these were fantastic! However, I did make one change. Before breading the chicken, I soaked it in buttermilk mixed with a generous slurp of Frank's for about an hour. Ever since I was given that tip, I find breaded chicken comes out not only tender and juicy, but with an extra little kick!

First, I'm rating THIS recipe, NOT Frank's sauce!  Sigh.  Calling it buffalo is definitely a misnomer.  I thought they were flavorful and crunchy, but not hot.  The idea here was a low-fat version, and hot sauce would help w/out adding fat.  But adding the butter starts ruining that concept.  They were a bit dry baked this long, and that's considering my oven is usually slow.  The flour & egg were a bit on the sparse side for this amount of chicken & I had to be careful not to over-use it.  They were a bit of a pain to make.  I think they're a good low-fat chicken finger type thing but would not refer to them as buffalo.

This recipe is very tasty!  I like it because it gives the taste of chicken wings without all the frying in grease of regular wings.  I spray a little Pam on the top of them so they get crisper and browned.

These were delicious and easy.  Rumaging through the kitchen the other night, and found this recipe that I had printed off.  Made it on a whim and it was perfect, totally hit the spot.  Made my own honey mustard sause to go with them.

This recipe is on the healthier side, so it meets it's needs there.  And the prep was quick.  However the taste was just average.  No real Buffalo taste, in fact no outstanding taste at all.  Just like breaded chicken fingers.

We should have bought some stock in Frank's Red Hot company  -- we've been going through their Buffalo Wing sauce like crazy since we discovered this recipe! We brush FRH on the chicken strips a few minutes before they're ready to come out of the oven to kick up the spice even further. 

More often than not, we use this recipe for chicken breasts, then top them with Buffalo Wing sauce, and serve them on Kaiser buns as Buffalo chicken sandwiches. 

Either way, this recipe is fantastic!

As this recipe is written, there is nothing "buffalo" about it.  Where is the hot sauce, where is the blue cheese dressing?  I dipped my chicken pieces in Frank's hot sauce and melted butter, then dredged them in the breadcrumbs.  I served them with blue cheese dressing as a dipping sauce.  I gave it 2 stars for the submitted recipe - - to be "Buffalo", you need to add a few ingredients.  Just my humble opinion.

Made these for hubby...who loves buffalo wings.  These are good for a "heathlier" version.  Of course nothing beats deep frying these things.  I didn't change much of the recipe except for using Frank's Red Hot sauce....hubby loves the stuff.  Thanks for a healthy recipe of one of our favorite treats.

Followed the recipe exactly. Near the end of cooking, I melted 1/2 stick of butter with 6 oz. Crystal hot sauce. I then tossed the chicken with this just before serving. With this change, I would up it to five stars! It tastes great. If spicy is your thing, do not put as much butter in the hot sauce. A 1/2 stick of butter and 6 oz. of hot sauce gives that "buffalo chicken" flavor without the very spicy taste.

This turned out great!  The only thing I did differently was to marinate the chicken - which I cut into nugget size pieces- in Texas Pete's Buffalo Hot Sauce for 1 hour prior to coating.  The chicken was very spicy and had some heat.  Putting the hot sauce on the inside also helped the chicken to remain crispy.  I also provided additional hot sauce and fat free ranch for dipping.  These were a bit hit at dinner!

This was wonderful. They came out of the oven juicy and crispy. I then tossed them in the hot sauce/butter mixture as suggested by another reviewer, and they tasted heavenly. It did make them mushy, however, so next time I think I will pour the sauce on right before eating, or use it as a dip.

I would consider adding more cayenne to this recipe. I like the fact that it was low fat. I would make it again but definitely add more cayenne. 3 stars for children because I did not give it to my children so I really had no opion on the part.

Instead of baking, I fried them only because I needed to shorten the cook time. I didn't read the cook time right at first so that was my fault. I loved dipping this in hot sauce!

This was very good but I'm only giving it 3 stars because I had to make several adjustments. I felt like there wasn't really much spice to the flavor so I doubled the cayenne pepper. Also, I used the advice of others and mixed buffalo sauce instead of water with the egg mixture. I had to bake for 9 minutes per side because the bread crumbs weren't quite as crispy as I would have liked them. With the adjustments we still liked it very much and will have it again.

Just blah.  I used tenders, and they were tender, but breading was dry and bland.  I soaked them first in buttermilk and hot sauce and used 1/2 regular bread crumbs and 1/2 panko but still didn't do much for me.  Sometimes things just need to be fried....

I've been making these for years now. A n absolute favorite. A few years ago I switched to using Panko crumbs and never looked back. Panko gives a by far better texture and flavor. 
The only thing I didn't care for were the sauce instructions. To get that real buffalo wing flavor you absolutely must add a tablespoon of vinegar to the melted butter and hot sauce. The vinegar is what gives the buffalo wing zing to what would otherwise just be chicken strips, or wings, with hot sauce.

I followed the directions exactly up until the baking was done. Melting 2 T of butter and mixing with 2T of buffalo sauce, I toss the chicken tenders in the sauce, then bake an additional 5 minutes.  I also used chicken tenderloins vs the chicken breast, just a personal preference as it's quicker and price is relatively the same. I have made this quite a few times now, and it's perfect I like spicy, my daughter does not. I only toss half the tenders in the buffalo  sauce. Satisfying each of our cravings for chicken tenders.

Keeper! As suggested I marinated the meat in hot sauce, proceeded and brushed with butter/hot sauce before and after cooking.
 I have also prepared 1inch meatballs (chicken, turkey or pork ) with the above method and recieved rave reviews. Thanks for a good recipe.

Really good, solid recipe.  We originally made it as written and quite liked it, although it was a bit hot for the kids.  We cut the cayenne in half and it's become a family favourite.  So, great recipe and easily adjustable to suit your spicy tastebuds!

The recipe is great - but the amount of flour mix and bread crumbs worked for 2 chicken breasts.  Be ready to double it if you want to use the full 4 chicken breasts.  I tossed in buffalo sauce and they were great!

Loved this a lot!!  I got a carton of egg whites because I felt that the egg whites from two eggs wouldn't be enough. I cooked the chicken at 375, 10 minutes on one side and 10 minutes on the other side. They came out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Made this twice in less than three days :) made honey mustard sauce for dipping - definitely a keeper!

I was shocked at how easy this was and how good this turned out. Only downside was a little messy preparation The one thing I did differently was broil on both sides for a few minutes at end. These were certainly not soggy before but I like them very crunchy. I'll be doing this again for sure.

These were remarkably tasty!!  I used chicken tenderloins, and then I made a Buffalo sauce with 1 c Frank's hot sauce + 1 stick butter (melted down) to pour over them.  Served 'em with celery sticks and a side of Ranch dressing.

I just tried this recipe and it is an okay basic recipe. It definitely needs to be dipped in buffalo sauce because it's pretty bland. If you prefer to eat it without dip and want to taste any degree of spiciness, I recommend that you double or triple the amount of cayenne because you will get no kick from just 1 tsp. I recommend tripling the amount of cayenne, doubling the amount of salt and dipping this with some nice, cool sour cream. I also added a tsp each of onion powder, paprika and dried parsley.

I cut the meat from four thighs and followed the recipe. Then, following other suggestions, at 8 minutes into cooking and before I turned the pieces I painted them with Texas Pete's Buffalo Sauce and let them go another 2 or 3 minutes. Turned them, painted the other side, and cooked for another 12 minutes. Very tender, nice kick. Might try it without the TPBSauce next time, just to see.

I used 3 large breasts cut into 12 strips, I added 1 tsp Tabasco to the whole egg (not 2 whites) and added about 1/4 cup milk, I marinated the chicken in this while I was getting the rest of the things organized. I had to use at least 3/4 cup of flour which I seasoned with chili powder, black pepper, poultry seasoning, onion powder and garlic powder. I used Italian bread crumbs which I did not season, I needed about 1 cup. I baked the chicken fingers on parchment paper for 20 minutes at 500 degrees, turning halfway through. I served with Buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing for dipping, family really enjoyed.

We really like these! They're not the same as deep fried, but they're close enough, and so much healthier. I feel like the breading gets soggy though, and I don't know how to fix that.

I love these chicken fingers!!  The only modification that I made was after the chicken was done, I melted 1/2 cup of butter with as much hot sauce as desired and poured them over the chicken...this gave them the wet texture and made them mouth watering...I also used hot sauce with the egg rather than the water that was recommended...I either bake or fry these and then pour the marinade over them after done...I have made these time and again and they are a huge hit!!

This is a good recipe but not really buffalo tasting. If you want a nice spicy, not gooey strip/tender do as others have mentioned and marinate the strips in your fave hot sauce (I like French's). I then replace 2 eggs with one, mixed with 1/2 cup of hot sauce, then dip in the breadcrumbs mixture. And if you really want to simply things, use shake n bake instead of breadcrumbs. Quick, easy and delicious!

These were great except I made a few changes, based on other reviews.  I marinated overnight in hot sauce.  I omitted the flour and water (used hot sauce instead) and used panko bread crumbs.  For baking, I placed a rack on my baking sheet so that they would be raised off the baking sheet.  They were too salty for my taste, so next time I will reduce the salt in half.  Served with ranch dip.  Good substitute for fried.  Will make again.

Made these tonight and they are very good, just enough kick for my taste.  Made 4 servings, was enough for myself and my husband with a few left over.  Will reheat those and use in a sandwich.

These are a new family favorite. 

This recipe as written has a spicy flavor without being overpowering.  Want more kick...just add more spices, some hot sauce, serve with a sauce, etc. So easy to customize.

Make sure to spry/oil your pan well so you don't lose half the breading when turning.  Recipe is quick and easy- my 10 yr old son actually made them the other night (except cutting up the chicken.)  

Thanks for a great recipe!!

*edit: I made these yet again tonight. We love them. Anyway, I made the breading a little differently: 1/2 c Panko and 1/4 c seasoned bread crumbs. I thought the recipe as written was excellent- this minor change was amazing!!!

I agree with other reviewers that there is nothing very buffalo about this dish. However, it is still quite a good tasting finger dish. I will definitely be making this again and perhaps the next time round, I will make some buffalo sauce to go with it.

5 stars only with the reviewers addition of hot sauce.  I tried these without and it was very plain.  I cut this down to 4 servings and used 1lb of chicken already cut into tenders.  I used Panko bread crumbs and they were a great texture.  I went for equal parts hot sauce & butter for a mild taste (1/4 butter & 1/4 cup Franks Ret Hot).  Pour the sauce over the cooked chicken fingers and enjoy.  I served this with Oven Fresh Seasoned Potato Wedges found on allrecipes.

My husband devoured these tasty chicken strips! I used just a touch less cayenne (because I'm a pansy) and when they were done I discovered that 1 tsp would have been just fine without being too hot. I will definately be adding this recipe to my favorite recipe folder. It is perfect the way it is! I served them with asian cole slaw and celery sticks with ranch. Delicious!

Good, but not nearly enough heat. Next time I will add additional cayenne to both the breading and flour mixture and some hot sauce to the egg mixture.

My family loves this recipe.  My 11 year old is very picky but he even eats the leftovers from this meal.  I use panko breadcrumbs and dip the chicken in franks hot sauce after it's done baking.  This recipe has such great flavor, just like boneless buffalo wings out.

These were good but not very "buffalo-y!" My suggestion would be to marinate the chicken overnight in hotsauce. I did substitute the water for 2 tbsp of Franks Hot sauce but still did not give them the kick I was looking for.

I have made this twice in the last ten days and I think it's a keeper! I love buffalo chicken wings, fingers, etc. I made it low carb by using a low carb flour mixture called Carbquik, and then I used bread crumbs that I made from two slices of low carb bread (toast your bread in the toaster, let it cool, then tear it up and put it in a coffee grinder. You will have great bread crumbs in seconds). About five minutes before they were ready to come out of the oven, I tossed them in Frank's hot sauce and returned them to the oven. For a fresh and easy bleu cheese dip, I mix one part sour cream, one part mayo, one part bleu cheese crumbles, and add some diced scallions for added flavor - yum! Thanks for this great, easy recipe!

These were alright as the directions state, but better once I cooked them longer.  I had to do so  to get them to the level of crispy I was looking for.  Also, I too doubled the flour and breadcrumb portion because there was just not enough.

Very good for a healthy, low fat dish. In response to the many reviewers who slathered them in butter to make them taste better, doesn't that defeat the purpose of making a healthy version of fried chicken fingers? I think they're good just the way they are. The amount of heat is a personal preference...you can always add more red pepper to suit your taste.

I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.  I made a few modifications.  I did not have eggs on hand so I used a stick of butter mixed with about a tablespoon or a little more of franks red hot sauce.  I do not like anything with the buffalo taste, but I love spicy---so I didn't use much of franks.  I made about 2-3 pounds of chicken, so I doubled the breadcrumb and flour mix and it worked out perfect!  We served them with spinach salad, carrots, and celery and dipped them in ranch.  They had just the right amount of kick!  (We added a little bit of "Slap Yo Mama" seasoning for added heat).  We ate them two nights and just broiled them the second night and they came out pretty good.  Will definately make again!

We followed other reviewers suggestions and dipped into mixture of Franks and butter before last few minutes of baking. This gave them the spicy buffalo flavor that we like, but I think the original recipe would have been too plain, so that's why I gave it 3 stars.

Needed more heat! This was good, and my son loved it, but for my taste, it needed more heat. Next time I plan on marinating some of the chicken in hot sauce, and saving some out for my son who doesn't like super spicy food.

Was really good with modifications suggested by other reviewers. I marinated in Frank's Red Hot for a few hours, doubled both the flour and the breadcrumb mixture, and added hot sauce to the eggs as well. I had trouble getting the breading to stick on especially after flipping them. I tossed them in buffalo wing sauce after cooking and used them to make crunchy buffalo chicken sandwiches. They were great! Thanks!

I was surprised at how good these were! Not that I expected them to be bad of course, but I always have trouble with getting the breading to stay on.  with these, the breading stayed on perfectly and they were crispy and delicious. Thank you!

These were really good.  I used olive oil in the bottom of the pan instead of cooking spray to be sure they crisped up and it turned out perfect.  I cut them into strips and served over a salad.  Yummy!

After baking the chicken, I poured a mixture of 1 cup  franks hot sauce and 1 cup of melted better over the chicken. The bread crumb mixture wasn't fully cooked but the chicken was. Maybe i'll try to fry his next time?

These are quite yummy and healthy, but I wouldn't label them as buffalo chicken at all. I followed the recipe and the flavor was a lot milder than expected. I would make again however, as these were quick, healthy and good. They would definitely need hot sauce as others suggested in order to taste more like buffalo chicken. Next time I'll try with Frank's Red Hot Sauce.

We really loved these. The only criticism I have is that rather than calling them Buffalo Chicken Fingers, I would call them Spicy Chicken Fingers. When I think of Buffalo, I think of the sauce. They are delicious though. I dipped them in Buffalo sauce and Ranch dressing to get the Buffalo effect. Definately a keeper!

These were outstanding. I didn't change a single thing in the recipes ingredients or measurements or directions. They definitely have a bit of a kick if you use the recommended amount of cayenne, but I loved it. I shook some Frank's Red Hot sauce on all of the pieces before baking and then again on the other side after flipping them over. I then tossed the chicken fingers/nuggets into a salad of romaine lettuce, chopped tomatoes, chopped red onion, peeled carrots, crumbled blue cheese, a bit of crumbled well-done turkey bacon, crumbled up tortilla chips and topped with light ranch dressing. It was fantastic.

I felt it was missing something.  They turned out dry, and didn't have the usual chicken finger taste.  I may come back to this recipe though, because it is more healthy than the fried version.  I will try adding a little butter and hot sauce to the recipe to give it more flavor.  My family did not like this recipe and they love chicken fingers.

i dont feel guilty!! thats the best part for me. it sucks being weight conscious, having to watch what i eat. everything i eat shows on my body. i felt like this was an alternative to something i loveeeee, fried chicken wings! the only thing i did differently was substitute water for hot sauce. its not spicy at all, it just gives it a nice flavor .. not bland. what was also great was that it wasnt dry! i didnt have to go out and buy any ingredients because they common ingredients that everyone should have in their pantry.

This was a pretty good base recipe and allowed me to cut some fat from my Super Bowl fiesta.  I did make some Buffalo Sauce from scratch to pour over and then continued baking.  I would've liked then to have come out a little crispier but that's a trade-off I was willing to make when I decided to forego any sort of frying.

these were awesome!  I also as a last step tossed them in some FRANKS Buffalo Wing Sauce and melted butter then back in the oven for 5 minutes.  Served on a bun with lettuce and blue cheese dressing...will never order a buffalo chicken sandwich at a restaurant again.  Thanks for the recipe

These chicken tenders were so good. My family really loved them. I will admit however that I hate touching raw meat so instead of getting breasts and cutting them myself I always buy the chicken tenderloins. The only thing that I didnt like about this recipe is that it doesnt reheat very well and we usually eat a lot of leftovers.

They were easy to make and tasted ok (definitely not like buffalo though more like spicy chicken fingers).  Something that you could buy at the grocery store and save the hassle.

My family pigged out. They in no way reminded me of buffalo strips but they were still very good. The chiken was very moist. My 10 year old daughter dipped hers in bbq. My husband and I dipped ours in buffalo sauce and blue cheese. Thanks for the post!

I made these with about half the cayenne as my kids dont like spicy. My son thought I had bought these, and ate half of them! I will try next time with the buffalo sauce and dip in bleu cheese, I am very excited!

Prepared as the recipe directed these are only ok. They werent very flavorful and really needed the suggested sauce of the other reviewers. For two servings of sauce I melted two tablespoons of butter and stirred in one heaping tablespoon of Franks Red Hot sauce. Despite using Panko breadcrumbs I still wished they were a little more crunchy, but I will definitely be making these at home as opposed to going out for Buffalo Chicken strips. Thanks for a healthy recipe!

I can only give this recipe four stars because I changed a few things, but they tasted excellent! First, I put the chicken in a zip lock bag with some Tabasco sauce for about an hour. I also used Tabasco sauce instead of water with the eggs. And after reading some reviews, I decided to dip the chicken fingers in a mixture of melted butter and Tabasco sauce before the last few minutes of cooking time. I didn't have any Franks on hand, but the Tabasco sauce worked fine. Thanks for the recipe!

These were VERY good with the suggested addition of sauce (made with 1/4 c. butter and 1/2 c. Frank's Hot Sauce) poured over them after baking. With the sauce, it is a definite 10 star, but since the recipe actually doesn't call for adding it, I can only rate it 4. These just weren't that flavorful plain, the way the recipe calls for.  These taste just like our favorite restaurants'  Buffalo Chicken Strips (with the sauce)!

Very tasty, although they looked strange - dry looking on the outside but moist and flavorful inside. I doubled the flour, bread crumbs and seasonings. I poured Red Hot Buffalo Sauce on half of them and served them with ranch dressing.  The other half I served with bbq and honey mustard on the side. I think my husband was pleasantly surprised. He did NOT want baked chicken strips. But I forced him to try them and he ended up loving them. Great recipe and good for you - thanks.

These were pretty good - I think the problem was I just had really high expectations.  The simple sauce (Butter & Frank's BUFFALO WING Sauce) did make 'em better - but still, not quite what I was expecting.

Absolutely fantastic recipe! I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it came out perfectly. I served the fingers with Frank's red hot sauce on the side for extra kick. The fingers disappeared quickly with my family, so I know they were a huge success!

I'm always looking for healthier versions of my favorite foods, and these chicken fingers were the perfect substitution for the calorie-laden chicken wings I love.  I like super-spicy food, so I made a few changes to up the heat level.  I used chicken tenders (that's what we had in the fridge) and marinated them in a mixture of tabasco sauce, Open-pit barbecue sauce and cayenne pepper for about 2 hours.  Based on the other reviews, I doubled the flour mixture and had more than enough, and almost tripled the cayenne.  The results were really tasty, but still not quite spicy enough for me.  I'll definitely make these again and try to up the heat a bit more.  Thanks for the recipe, easy to make, a great, healthy week night dinner!

I just made these & they were fantastic. My only problem is that my family found the garlic a bit overpowering. Maybe it's because I used garlic salt not powder, I don't know if you should adjust the amount if you don't have garlic powder, I thought they were basically the same. I did cut back on the Cayenne, it really wasn't necessary, should have used full amount. I made this with a Potato Mustard salad & a warm homemade sweet & sour sauce. My 3 1/2 year old son who loves my Potato salad didn't even touch it because he ate so many fingers. Thanks so much for this recipe (love that they're baked) this one is a keeper.

This was very good with the suggestions of other reviewers- primarily the addition of Frank's Buffalo Hot Sauce over the fingers after baking.  I will definitely try getting a hold of those Panko breadcrumbs, as suggested by another reviewer, 'cause ours came out kinda soggy (but still tasty w/ the hot sauce over it + blue cheese dressing for dipping).  Will definitely try making "Buffalo Chicken sandwiches" next time, too!

These were great.  I used Texas Pete buffalo sauce instead of the egg I then tossed them with additional sauce before eating.  HOT HOT HOT I wasn't crazy about the bread crumbs though they were a little soggy.

YUMMY!  I made this the other night and my boyfriend and I loved it.  I used turkey cutlets instead of chicken breasts and added ranch dressing mix instead of garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe.  The cooking times are just right.  I made two little batches and tossed the first with buffalo sauce right before serving, and the second batch I coated the strips with the sauce then baked 5 minutes longer.  I liked the first way better and my boyfriend preferred the second.  Either way, these are awesome and we'll make them again!  Easy, too!

Good, but not really "buffalo" chicken fingers since there's no sauce.  With buffalo sauce served alongside, they were good, but without it, they were just too plain for us.  It was a lot healthier than wings, so I appreciated that.

My family really likes these. A great healthy way to make chicken. Yes, I'd prefer them spicier but we have two kids that would've been upset if they had any more heat. When I make them again I may try the saltines just for a change. Thanks.

This was a good alternative to the traditional fried chicken fingers.  I did modify it as other reviewer suggested and brushed them with Franks Hot Sauce and butter prior to serving.  I'll make these again.

This has been the third time I have made this in about 2 months. When my kids have  a sleep over they ask me to make these, all the kids that have come here love these. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. My fiance and I enjoy them just as much.
                      Thank you,

I like the IDEA of this recipe, but I can't imagine how bland the original recipe would have been.
I put hot sauce in the egg mixture and dipped them in mostly hot sauce and little melted butter before the last few mintures of cooking. They still weren't spicy enough for me.

Great recipe. I used panko bread crumbs to coat and tossed the fingers in buffalo wing sauce when they were just out of the oven. A nice change from greasy restaurant hot wings.

These were good especially for being low fat baked.  I needed more breadcrumbs though and that was for 3 chicken breasts. Will make them again and spice them up more.  I served them with BBQ sauce but I liked them with just plain tomato ketchup.

I made this for my husband for our first married Valentine's day; the entire dinner he kept saying "you can cook!" I followed suggestions from other reviewers and marinated the chicken in Red Hot, then laid the strips on paper towels before putting them in the bag with flour.  The breading stuck quite well, even on the reheated leftovers, which we also enjoyed.  This version was the perfect spiceness for him; I could take more, but enjoyed it.  We'll definitely be making this again and eating it with our favorite wing sauces.

Great Recipe!  Every time my husband & I go somewhere, we are asked to bring these!  After baking the chicken, i toss them in a mixture of 1/2 butter & 1/2 Franks Red Hot Sauce and stick them back in the oven for another 5 minutes, They are a big hit!

This was pretty good. I marinated the chicken in buttermilk and hot sauce, as suggested by Zipporah. The only drawback was that it wasn't quite as good as good ol' greasy fried chicken fingers. A good alternative, for those that are trying to eat healthy. I served with blue cheese and celery.

Everyone loved these - will probably add more cayenne and take the advice to marinate them with some Red Hot sauce first - otherwise they aren't that spicy.

I love this recipe for the fact that it's baked chicked and it still tastes like it's fried!  Also, my house smells really good every time I make it.  I just add a little more cayenne that the recipe calls for and it's perfect!  Thanks Bobbi!

Excellent recipe!  Marinated for 30 minutes in Frank's hot sauce before breading.  Served with low-fat ranch dip and chili con queso dip!  Husband devoured plate & asked if there were anymore & wants them again tonight!I like them as they are low-fat & will be making them regularly from now on!

Mild but I quadrupled amounts of garlic and cayenne, added some salt and achieved a decent Buffalo Chicken taste. The cooking times are much too long. I used 6 minutes and 3 minutes.

I think this recipe is terrific. I deviated a little bit, not much. They came out fantastic. My kids loved it, and boy are they picky. The only thing I deviated on was the following; I used 2 parts Panko bread crumbs and one part regular bread crumbs. I think this is the perfect blend and you get the best of both worlds. Panko is crunchy but usually flakes off and the regular bread crumbs cover great, but aren’t as crunchy. To make the buffalo sauce I just mixed 2/3 cup hot sauce, half a tablespoon of brown sugar, 1tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp cayenne powder, 1/2 cup butter and 2 tbsp of white wine vinegar. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It’s a keeper. I wanted to take a picture by they disappeared that quick.

For a keto version of this recipe, replace flour with almond flour and replace bread crumbs with crushed pork rinds (no kidding).

The changes people have suggested make it so good! Use Franks instead of 1T Water, and make your own buffalo sauce for after it cooks! My husband loved this!

I was excited to try these. Not sure why these didn't turn out.  I followed the suggestions of many reviewers (doubling the flour and bread crumbs, using hot sauce instead of water with the egg whites, cooking 12 mins per side, melting butter and hot sauce to add on in last 5 mins etc.)but they were soggy.  They were way too hot for everyone in the family except me,but I didn't enjoy eating them.  Maybe it was something on my end and not the recipe?

Really like these - have made them several different ways following other reviewers' advice.  I also marinate them in a lot of Frank's hot sauce for a few hours, so I don't need to add it to the egg wash, but I would say my main contribution to this great recipe is to spray them with butter flavor cooking spray right before putting the in the oven to get a more crispy coating.  I use organic.  I also have to say they are great fried too :>).

I add more cayenne than it called for and cooked it about 5 minutes total longer and they came out very crispy, my family loved them! The flavor was incredible we even dipped them info buffalo sauce.

I enjoyed this easy dish.  But I adjusted  quite a bit as I did not want a very hot dish.  My family likes smoky food, so I replaced the cayenne pepper with smoked paprika.  I followed many suggestions to marinade the chicken.  I  poured smoked chipotle sauce over them and add the sauce to the egg white.  Also made a buffalo sauce, replacing hot sauce with chipotle sauce and melting butter.  brushed the sauce on 2 minutes before tenders were done.

I found the oven temp was not hot enough and did not crisp them at all. The only thing that made them ok was all the buffalo sauce I put on. I would recommend a hotter oven.

This turned out very well.  I used chicken tender and doubled the flour mixture as suggested.  The part of the flour mixture that was left over I thru in with the bread crumbs.  The only change that I made was mixing some Franks Red Hot was butter and putting it on the chicken before and during the cooking.  The chicken was full of flavor.  I will definitely make it again!!!!

I love this recipe!...
Although I made a few tweaks to it.
 
1) I used the same measurements but I swapped out the all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour, the breadcrumbs for cornmeal and I added other peppers such as cajun and paprika.
 
2) I used (2) Ziploc bags for both coatings.

3) Instead of baking them, I brushed a tablespoon of Olive Oil on them -on both sides- and Airfried them at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes. Once finished I dipped them in BBQ sauce.

The end result was a nice, golden brown coat with a soft and moist center. This dish was delicious!

I used 2 boneless, skinless, thin-cut breasts and marinated in Frank's Red Hot Sauce all afternoon.  I wanted to use panko crumbs, but was out so used bread crumbs.  I used 1 egg with 1/2 tablespoon of Frank's sauce instead of water.  I baked them on a baking sheet covered with foil which I sprayed with Pam.  They came out perfect.  Nice and crispy.  I don't think I have ever had such crispy chicken or fish come out of the oven like that.  I thought they were a little spicy, but my husband who is not big a real spicy food though they were great and loved them.  Will be making these again and also breading a lot of food this same way.

Great quick and easy choice instead of greasy fattening chicken wings! I used half Panko  and half bread crumbs also hot sauce with the egg wash instead of water after reading the reviews. It is excellent !!

This was scrumptious. I'm trying to lose weight and this seemed to work with my diet. I did as others recommended. I melted a little butter in Frank's Red Hot and dunked the chicken in a few minutes before done then returning to the oven. Some of us made sandwiches and some just ate as tenders but all of us enjoyed it. My hubby said that this didn't even taste like diet food. Ha! A few leftovers but my son said that he wanted it for lunch tomorrow. Thank you for sharing!

It was just OK, really didn't have any flavor. The crunch and texture was nice. All the cayenne pepper did was create a hotness that you don't really feel until a solid 30 seconds after a bite. It really needs different spices (perhaps Cajun?) or some kind of dipping sauce, because this chicken on its own is blah.

I will do it again adding more cayenne, garlic and add tabasco instead of water to the egg. Also try with 12 min in the oven each side.

I used the red hot in the egg white as pr other reviews but you couldn't really taste it.  I salted the flour but not the panko and that was a mistake.  I think they would have been good if properly salted.  As I made them 2 stars but that isn't the recipes fault

I made this for 3 grown young hungry men. I used Frank's original wings sauce with melted butter drizzled lightly over the fingers.  They all loved it!
This is a good alternative to frying, but keep in mind the cooking time is for small fingers. Add at least 5 more minutes for large fingers or a double quantity.

Yesssssss!!!! This is awesome!! I am a chicken tender junkie and this totally satisfies my craving without  feeling like I should sign up for biggest loser afterwards. Unless I eat the whole batch.....which could happen, they are THAT good.  I did replace the water with Frank's red hot and the breadcrumbs were homemade croutons that took a spin around the bullet.  They aren't very spicy, pretty mild, but I just dip them in more hot sauce as I do with just about everything.

'Didn't scream buffalo.  I sprayed with oil before baking in hopes of crispy, but it didn't help much.  These would probably be at least four star if panfried, but baking is the main reason I chose this recipe - to get out of that standing over the pan & mess after.  This reminded me of what would be a decent frozen chicken strip - if there even is one.

I love that this is healthy AND tasty. I did the same as many users and substituted the water with Frank's then dunked the baked chicken pieces in wing sauce (1/2 cup Frank's mixed with 1/4 cup melted butter) with one minute left to bake. We like our spice, but this was not too over the top- reminds me of a healthier version at a popular chain restaurant. Thank you for the recipe!

These were lacking in flavor and texture. Even added extra cayenne and still wasnt nearly enough. Had to get out sauces just to taste anything.

This was a good chicken recipe but I sure wouldn't have called it "Buffalo" chicken. It really doesn't resemble a traditional buffalo chicken wings for instance. I served it with a cool dill dip that worked really well with it.

Good option for chicken.  Not sure they should be called buffalo though.  Next time try other readers suggestion about dipping in hot sauce before they are finished baking.

Tried this, followed the recipe exactly and will not make again.  Doesn't look at all like the picture, just tastes like breaded chicken, nothing like buffalo chicken.  Leaves a lot to be desired.

These are ok.  The original recipe is missing something.  I used the advice of someone else and dipped them in Frank's hot sauce for the last few minutes of baking.  That made them better but still not my favorite.  There is still something missing.....

I make this with tweaks like other reviewers have suggested as is for kids and adults. Flour in a bag worked well, so did whole wheat Panko bread crumbs. Used  1 to 2 large eggs, as didn't have egg substitute and didn't want to separate eggs. Added Franks red Hot Pepper last 5 minutes of baking on some pieces for adults. Made Blue Cheese dip from Buffalo Chicken Strips II recipe  on this site and served with celery sticks - reminds me of restaurant appetizers - Yum!!!!

These were good, but needed some tweaking. I cooked mine about 13 minutes per side instead of 8. I also need more bread crumbs and egg mixture than called for. It's pretty inconvenient to run out of these things when you're elbow deep in chicken. Next time, I think I'll try a panko coating. Overall, an alright basic recipe.

Delish!  I marinated the chicken strips in Franks.  I also agree that there doesn't seem to be enough battering ingredients.  I did about half the chicken and then had to re-up the flour and breadcrumbs.  When I tried to flip the strips, the coating started to come off, so I decided to just skip that step.

Not really buffalo chicken, but they are good spicy chicken fingers.  Ive made them a few times with replacing hot sauce for water when beating the eggs.  Good reviews from everyone, very tasty.

These were really good.  I used panko bread crumbs which really makes them a lot crispier.  I used Franks Wing Sauce instead of making my own and they turned out amazing. They definitely aren't as crispy as the fried version - but the taste is great and I don't feel guilty! My husband even wants them again next weekend while we watch NASCAR.

This is the first time I reviewed.  I just want to say I loved this.  I made a some changes (as suggested by other reviewers - why only 4 stars) & it was delicious. My mom had some & loved it as well & my friend tried a piece the next day & raved & asked for the recipe & demanded it by the end of the day!

These were pretty good- they got nice and crisp; however, if you aren't going to dip them in something, I would suggest adding more seasonings as they were a little on the bland side by themselves. I wouldn't really call them "buffalo" though- they taste nothing like buffalo style chicken. One more thing- this will cover 2 large breasts of chicken. The recipe calls for 4, but make them small ones if you do that. One more tip: grease your pan even if you are using one that is non-stick!

This was a great recipes.  I used some butter melted with a little no name  brand hot sauce and poured it over the chicken fingers when they came out of the oven.  I don't think the spices alone would have made it hot enough, although it might have been good for kids.  These are good dipped in ranch also.

Great recipe!  I made two minor modifications to please my family.  In order to kick up the flavor, I marinated 1/2 the strips in Franks Buffalo Sauce for me and my husband.  To make the other 1/2 of the strips kid friendly, I left the cayenne pepper out of the flour mixture and rolled their 1/2 of the tenders first before adding the cayenne to the second 1/2.  My kids loved these which is wonderful because they are huge fried chicken nugget fan.  They really gobbled these up!  My husband and I mixed lite ranch dressing with Franks Red Hot for dipping.  YUM!

Definately needs the addition of Frank's to make these really taste like buffalo wings.  I mixed Frank's with the egg white and they turned out very well.

Very good, used saltines and marinated chicken in tabasco all day. After baking, I heated J.B. wing sauce and pured over the chicken. Nothing beats them fried, but a good alternative for a lighter version.Thanks

I followed this recipe with the advice of another reviewer on using Frank's Hot Sauce and saltines,instead of Bread Crumbs.Turned out great!

I didn't have Cayenne Pepper or Garlic Powder so I used Black Pepper and Garlic Salt.Tasted just fine with those alterations.

Great recipe!I will recommend it to others as well as bring it to outings!

These were fine, but tasted nothing like real buffalo chicken.  I wish I had read the reviews before I prepared it.  Hot sauce will help and it's an interesting idea to use crackers instead of bread crumbs!  Next time I will try that!

We really liked these - so much cheaper than having chicken fingers in a restaurant, and healthier, too!  I added some hot sauce to the beaten egg white, too, for extra zip, and I used panko bread crumbs for coating.

Great recipe. I followed others's suggestions and after cooking the chicken, coat each piece with butter and Franks hot sauce mixed together. Adds extra kick.

We made this as a snack for the football game and last Nascar race. We thought that it was very good.  There is only one thing I might have cut my breasts a little different but there wasn't even breadcrumb mixture for the amount of chicken and had to make more.

It was good but didn't quite cure my craving for real buffalo wings.

I LOVE BUFFALO CHICKEN WINGS SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY THESE..THEY WERE PRETTY GOOD. I USED CAJUN SEASONING BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE ANY CAYENNE. I PUT THE CHICKEN ON TOASTED BUNS WITH RANCH DRESSING. I JUST WISH I WOULD HAVE READ REVIEWS FIRST AND I WOULD HAVE MARINATED IN HOT SAUCE.

I used this recipe as more of a guideline.  The only real change I made was to use whole eggs instead of just the whites, and instead of adding water to the eggs, I added hot sauce.  My 6 year old who hates anything spicy ate these, so even with that change, they still really didn't pack much heat.  These are a basic chicken finger recipe.  They're still good though!! Just a bit dissapointed at the lack of heat in them.

I made these for dinner last night and everyone really liked them.  I substituted ground chipotle for the cayenne because we like the smokier flavor.  They were a big hit!

What a wonderful and easy recipe!!  I love chicken fingers, but am always looking for low-fat versions of favorites, as I try to take care of my health.  These turned out very tasty, and moist!  Dipped them in a little BBQ sauce mixed with a little lemon juice, and what a tasty dinner!  Nice change from regular baked chicken!  Thanks!

I used this recipe as a starting point for my chicken tenders.  I did fry them up after coating them in this breading.  After draining on paper towels I salted with some Cajun seasoning.  Just before serving I poured the Buffalo Sauce from this site over, and baked for about 5 min. to warm and crisp up.  Delicious!!

This was pretty good.  I used another reviewers suggestion of marinating in hot pepper sauce and butter and putting back in to back for 5 more nminutes and it was pretty good.  It's not quite as good without the greasiness of frying, but it did save calories so probably worth it.

These were pretty good, I used a LOT of Tony Chachere's (I KNOW that spelling is wrong :)and they were tasty.  They weren't really buffalo-ish to us though, more like regular chicken fingers.  We dipped in ranch and barbecue.  I'll make again and maybe play with the spices a bit.

Definitely needs more spices than the recipe calls for.  But they are very tasty, nonetheless. It is a great quick recipe to make as either a main dish or an appetizer.

I love these!  I marinated them overnight in Texas Pete Buffalo sauce and they came out great!  Not too much breading!  Just Right! Thanks Bobbi Jo!
