I didn't have the canned onion soup so I substituted a package of dry onion soup mixed with 1 cup of water and a tsp of beef boullion.  Since my cubed steaks were very thin, I only baked for 30 minutes.  My family loved them!

We had a nice and tasty meal with this as our recipe base. I used 8 cube steaks, 2 cans of beef broth, 1 can of mushroom soup, one onion (sliced) and 1 envelope of dry onion soup mix. I sprinkled the steaks with pepper and garlic powder and placed in skillet with onion rings to brown on both sides. Meanwhile, I mixed the beef broth, mushroom soup and dry onion soup mix. After meat was browned I placed it and onions in a 9x13, poured the soup mix all over, covered with foil and baked at 350 for 45 minutes. Served with mashed potatoes and a salad. These steaks were tender and certainly not dry. The gravy was delicious. A tasty, yet inexpensive meal since I got the steaks for $1.99/lb.

I browned 6 cube steaks with granulated garlic and seasoned pepper. Then I added the condensed French Onion Soup, along with a can of Cream of Mushroom and half an envelope of Lipton's dry Onion Soup mix. Covered with foil and wow... the meat was tender, and the gravy was delicious over mashed potatoes. True comfort food for a pittance.  This will definitely be on the monthly rotation, and thanks, Amy!

I've used this same recipe (with a few variations of course) since long before the computer was even a dream. I coat the meat with flour and seasons of choice and beat the flour mixture into the meat.  THE BEST TIP I EVER GOT: THE MORE FLOUR YOU POUND INTO THE MEAT, THE MORE TENDER THE MEAT WILL BE.  Put onions in with meat to saute after you have turned the meat once.  Use cream of (your favorite) soup along with a packet of dry onion soup mix.  I make this all in a cast iron skillet so I don't have to transfer to another pan or cook in the crock pot.  Covering the dish to cook also helps tenderize the meat.  This works GREAT with venison steaks too or any other steak, be it tough meat or tender.

Easy as it GETS... Comfort food to a 'T'.  Didn't change a thing (not sure why people find it necessary to change everything & make it nothing of what it was...) Thanks for a super simple dinner!

This is really good.  I dredge the steaks in flour and brown.  Also add beef broth to the french onion soup, and cook longer at lower temp.  Turns our really tasty and tender.  Have used mushroom soup with beef broth as well.  Also add sliced onion on top of steak.

Delicious, easy, and inexpensive... who could ask for more? I season mine with garlic salt and fresh-ground pepper, then when they have browned I just pour the soup in the skillet, put on the lid, and let it simmer over low heat for at least an hour, if not several. Comes out wonderfully tender and leaves my oven free to bake some potatoes for a side dish.

Great recipe! And so easy! I made it using the dry onion soup mix with 1 cup of water. I also covered the casserole dish with tin foil to keep the moisture in. My family loved it.

This was very, very good.  My Family loved it..and my husband usually isn't too fond of any form of steak!!  I made a few changes  as posted by other cooks.  I first dredged the cube steaks in flour,seasoned with pepper, garlic powder and one of my favorite seasonings called Vegeta. Also instead of the French Onion Soup, I used mushroom soup, beef broth and dry onion soup mix.  I also added fresh sliced mushrooms.  Everything was delicious and I will definately make this recipe again!!  Thanks sooo much for sharing :>)

This is so easy and simple to make, and the meat turns out tender.  I seasoned the meat first with garlic powder, onion powder, celery salt and black pepper, lightly floured and then browned.  I had only one pound of meat, so I used one can of french onion soup, but would use two cans if cooking two pounds.  Covered with foil for part of the cooking and then removed to finish.  I also added a small, drained can of mushrooms (would use fresh if I had them) to the soup.  Made plenty of gravy for my mashed potatoes.  I will definitely make again.

This recipe is a good idea but needs important adjustments.  Water HAS to be added to the soup because otherwise it all dries up, plus the flavor is too condensed anyway.  Also, I would suggest using a pan in which the meat just fits, so it will get the benefit of the liquid.

I would probably give this a 3.5 if I could. It had a good taste but the meat was still rather tough.

The meat has wonderful flavor and turns out very tender. I browned mine in the skillet and then cooked in the crockpot on low for about 4 hrs.

This was great! I used the tip from "Radiating Mom" for mushroom soup, beef broth and dry onion mix. I served it over rice and there was not one crumb left. Would make this for a group anytime.

After seasoning with garlic salt and pepper, I browned the steaks, then drained the grease, lowered the heat and added a can of condensed onion soup, a can of cream of mushroom soup, and a small can of sliced mushrooms. Lowered the heat and simmered for about two hours. They were nice and tender and delicious.  The soups made a pretty good grave for mashed potatoes but I probably should have thickened it some.

I am not a cube steak person, but they were on sale & I figured it was would be something different. I found this recipe, I took the advice of another reviewer and added cream of mushroom soup to it..OH MY YUMMY was it good! It was so tender you could cut it w/ a fork. The entire family was so happy and the gravy it made was so good over potatoes!

I was unable to find condensed French Onion soup in a can and didn't want to make it from a dry package, so I used good ole Mushroom soup and did it in an electric skillet. Cooked for 1 1/2 hr at 200. Came out so tender we didn't need a knife! Also did mashed potatoes and green beans with hot rools. Great meal.

I made this last night for dinner using round eye steaks and subbed the canned soup for Chicken stock and a packet of the Lipton's Onion Dip and came out pretty tasty. I also dipped the steaks in some all Gluten free All purpose flour. Next time i think i will create my own onion seasoning mix, so my son with food allergies can try it out if he is daring! I only baked it for 45 minutes after browning because we were hungry, but next time i will cook longer and hope it is more tender.Will definitely make this again.

Thank you for this recipe.  Our family has been making cube steaks on the stovetop in a skillet forever and while they have a fabulous flavor, there is always a little "chewiness" to them.  These steaks cooked in the oven, however, absolutely melt in your mouth.  You don't even need a knife to cut them.  I served with a garlic parm rice and a salad and there were no leftovers!

My husband & I loved this recipe. The steaks tasted so different from the same old fried recipe, that dinner was gobbled up in no time. Even my picky 10-yr-old loved them. I had all the ingredients on hand and it was super easy to prepare. Served with rice for the kids and baked potato for the adults. Any side veggie will go with it, too. Thanks for a winner!

Super easy and super delicious. I resisted the urge to change the recipe like the other commentors did, and I am glad I did. It was perfect and extremely tender. This one is going in my perminate recipe book.

I only gave this 4 stars, but it is really very good. To make it 5 stars I dredge the cube steaks in flour and browned them first before putting in the baking dish. Also I add a can of Mushroom soup with the onion soup. You can really put this in the crock pot... Yummy on Mashed potatoes! This is a wonderful base recipe that can be easily change for your taste to make it 5 stars for you

I absolutely loved this recipe. I seasoned the steaks with some garlic powder and pepper before browning... Then I added one can of french onion and one can of cream of mushroom soup. There was plenty of "gravy" left after cooking and it tastes delicious! I served it with mashed potatoes and corn.

I dredged the steaks in flour and seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Finished as written except covered with foil for the first 45 mins. or so.  These turned out great.  Really tasty and so easy.  Not dry at all with the addition of the foil.

I've made this many times now.  I love the ease!  I rated this 5* before just like it is, but now I only make it with adding a can of cream of mushroom soup with the French onion.  Delicious.  I also wanted to say that I made it in the crock pot and cooked it for 6 hours and it was even better.  The meat was so tender!  Try putting in on before work for an easy dinner.

This was really good. I used Cream of Mushroom soup though because I didn't have any of the French Onion.

I have made this dish a few times over the last couple of months. My husband is a huge minute steak fan and I wasn't so I was a little afraid to try it, mine has always come out dry and lets say a little chewy :), until I tried this recipe. It really does come out fork tender and has an excellent taste. Thanks so much for this one!

Easy meal.  I fixed as directed except that I put a few slices of onion on top of the meat before pouring on the soup.  Served with baked potatoes that I put in the same oven.

I have never cube steaks before - I must admit for the price, these came out AWESOME!  I don't think you need to cook them for a whole hour though...  They were borderline dry.  Might just be my oven so I'm still rating this a 5 star recipe!

This was a great basic recipe!  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  My husband and 3 year old loved it.  I did not have the condensed soup so, I used a packet of french onion soup mix with 1 can of cream of celery soup and about 2 cups of beef broth.  Made a wonderful gravy with the sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

Easy? Yes. Tasty...not so much. We were disappointed, but to be honest, this kind of food doesn't appeal to us. I tried it anyway b/c I wanted something different to do with the meat, and had the ingredients. I think people who like stew would like this. We didn't like the consistency, all the gravy, and the blandness. But the meat was divinely tender. Not sure we'll eat the leftovers.

This was very good with a few minor adjustements as suggested by others.  I added the cream of mushroom soup and Lipton dry onion mix.  Cooked for 1 hour and it was perfect.  Great over rice.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

This recipe is definately easy.  I think it turned out well.  I do like a bit more flavor and the meat was still a bit tough...so I do think I will keep this one and tinker with it a bit.  Thanks for the post.

I love this recipe and have made some changes...am having it at least once a week...just like Mom's country style steak but it's always tender and less hassle.  I coated the steak with flour, browned and threw them in the crockpot.  Couldn't find condensed french onion soup so I used 2 cans cream of mushroom soup (with lower sodium & fat), 1/2 pkg onion soup mix and about 1/2 - 3/4 cup water.  Cooked on low about 6 hours or on high 4 hours.  LOVE IT!!!

It was a little salty for me, but it has great flavor.  Everyone in the family enjoyed this. I especially loved the fact that there were only two ingredients; both super easy to find in any grocery store. Next time, I will add a little water to cut down on the saltiness somewhat (maybe about 1/2 can worth), add some mushrooms, and cover with foil during the baking time as some others have suggested.  Great recipe.

I really like this, I used the dry onion mushroom with 1 cup of water, it was really good next time I will try this with a T-bone steak. Instead of cooking this in a stove, I used my toaster oven cooked it on 380 for awhile covered with foil and broiled for the last 10 minutes and it was so moist.

This was just okay.  I cooked it as the directions said, but it burnt and was way too dry.  I was almost choking it down.  It definitely wasn't the best recipe.  It needs less time in the oven or to be covered with foil.

My supermarket didn't have cube steaks, so the butcher reccomended sirloin tips (tender and cheap). I don't make much money on a summer intern's salary, and I've been craving flavor like this on a budget for about a month now. So. Yummy.

Very good basic recipe!  I made it just as stated except I added garlic powder, salt & pepper before browning.  I also covered it while cooking because the reviews stated that it was dry.  I ended up with very tender steaks.  As stated the recipe does not give much au jus, since the steaks soak it up.  Next time I will double the onion soup so I have extra for the mashed potatoes.  I personally felt it was a bit bland for my tastes so I will add some seasonings also, but as stated the recipe is still very good.  Thank you Amy.  I will be adding this to the save files!!

A little on the bland side.  Also, 1 can of soup left the meat a bit dry.  Worth trying again, after tinkering with the recipe.  Maybe adding an extra can of soup, more spices, etc.

I have never been a fan of cube steaks, but my husband loves them. I tried this recipe and I loved it. It makes the steaks so tender, and the soup gives them such a wonderful flavor. Will definitely use this one over and over...

Pretty good recipe.  I dredged in flour before browning and used beef broth also.  Even my pickiest child ate it!

Perfect for needing something in a hurry.  I coat the cube steaks in flour and season with salt (plain or garlic) and pepper, then fry in a little oil. I saute mushrooms in butter and add to the top of the soup mixture.

My family liked this recipe really well, though, I did make a couple of changes.  I cooked 6 pieces, added a can of beefy mushroom along with the french onion soup.  I also dredged the meat in seasoned flour before browning.  I put foil on the pan for the first 45 minutes of bake time.

Next time I will pound the meat out a bit thinner to aid in the tenderness and cut back just a bit on the cook time.

Very yummie recipe!  The gravy is awesome.

This is a delicious recipe and a nice change from country fried steak, which is all I ever knew to fix with cube steaks.  BTW, I used deer meat.  This method of cooking made them taste just like beef.  I did make a few changes--I seasoned my steaks with salt and pepper then dredged them in flour before lightly browning them in some EVOO in an iron skillet.  Then I used a packet of dry "beefy onion" soup mix and a cup of water instead of the canned soup.  I also covered the pan with foil while the steaks baked in the oven.  My husband and I both love this recipe!

Yummy!  This was so easy.  I did make some adjustments.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of french onion.  I put some worchester sauce on the steaks before browning them in some olive oil. After browning the steaks I sauted sliced mushrooms and onion in the same skillet with olive oil.  I put the mushrooms and onion on top of the steaks and added the mushroom soup and a can full of water. When done a added some flour to the sauce and it thickened up. Next time I will make it with mashed potatoes because I had a lot of yummy gravy left over.

Very very easy and delicious...perfect for those nights where you don't want to cook but don't want to spend the money to eat out either.

I used some Durkee's tenderizer on both sides of meat before browning.

This is not a critique of the recipe so much as it is of cube steak. I made this for someone who has difficulty eating rare meats. Couldn't believe how bland it was: I pounded the steaks to 1/8-inch thickness, marinated them in garlic & seasonings for about an hour at room temp, dredged in flour & browned in hot EVOO/butter (they looked beautiful), pan-grilled onion slices & layered on top of the meat, deglazed the pan with wine, then added & reduced a savory home-made brown stock with mushrooms, poured over the meat, covered it & baked @ 350 for an hour.  Served with garlic whipped potatoes.  The potatoes and gravy were devoured, lots of cube steak left on the plates. :-(  I do not use canned soups because of the sodium, preservatives, and other undesirable ingredients, and the sauce was delicious. I seriously doubt that was the problem. Don't think I'll waste so much effort on cube steak again.

Since I used over a pound of meat, it needed water added. The soup gave it wonderful flavor! I made biscuits and green beans to accompany.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I covered it in the oven since a lot of the reviews indicated it would be dry otherwise, but I think next time I won't. The soup was very thin when it was done, not a good gravy consistancy.

These were okay. They were a little tough. I did add a can of cream of mushroom and some onions and canned mushrooms on top. Not sure if I would make again or not.

I made this for my 3 picky eaters and they LOVED it! They never ask for seconds so I only made 4. They were upset when there was no more! Like other reviewers, I did not have the condensed french onion soup, so I substituted with onion soup mix and 1 cup of water. I also only had to cook for 30 minutes. Soooo easy and soooo yummy!

This recipe is really tasty if you dredge the steak in a little flour first, brown in a pan with onions and a dash of Worchestershire sauce. You can then add any kind of stock: I've used chicken stock, beef stock or vegetable stock. Bake the meat in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes and it makes its own sauce. Serve with rice or mashed potatoe and use the sauce as gravy..yummy!

I made the original recipe, except that I didn't take beef out the skillet. I just poured the soup over it and let them simmer for 30 minutes or so. My husband ate it, said he liked it. My picky teenage son hated it. It was a little tough, but I thought it was still pretty good. Nevertheless, I doubt I will make it again unless I put the meat in the crockpot and let it cook all day.

I didn't have the canned onion soup so I substituted a package of dry onion soup mixed with 1 cup of water. 4 steaks or 1/2 lb not enough.  Since my cubed steaks were very thin, I only baked for 30 minutes. Will Certanly make again with modifications as my family loved them!

My steaks turned out okay but I felt like they were missing something.  Instead of serving them as-is, I made some homeade brown gravy, which added more flavor. The  brown gravy also made a better presenation.

The meat is very tender.  The flavor was good.  The only changes I made were I added some sliced onion and minced garlic.  Bake uncovered.

I 'lightly' seasoned and dredged steaks in flour and browned in olive oil. I also sprinkled half a packet of lipton's mushroom & onion mix on top of the steak before pouring the french onion soup ontop.  I also covered the dish while baking.

This was great. My kids even liked it which suprised me since they don't like onions. Only thing is it turned out a bit dry so I might tweak it a bit next time. Thanks for sharing!

These were very easy to make. I made some modifications though. I mixed beef broth, cream of mushroom soup and onion soup mix and poured it over the steaks.  Fabulous served over rice.

I really wanted to try this tonight, but I didn't have cube steaks on hand. What I had were "thinly sliced top round steak"....they sort of looked like thick "steak-ums". I seasoned the steaks with garlic pepper seasoning and quickly browned them in a skillet before putting them in a shallow casserole with the soup, a can of mushrooms (w/ their juice) and some water mixed with 2 teaspoons of corn starch. 

It is cooling on our stove top right now and it smells and tastes WONDERFUL!!!

I liked this however mine came out dryer...I'm thinking that since the cooking causes most of the soup to evaporate by the time it's done that some water should be added. I only added the contents of the can which didn't completely cover the meat to start with (lying flat as directed). Also, do not use extra salt on the steaks like when you brown them. I found that there's plenty in the soup to salt the meat while it bakes.

Putting cube steak in the oven is new to me, so thought I'd try some of the suggestions on this board. First dipped meat in milk then lightly floured before browning. For the gravy, I sprinkled one packet dry Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix on top of meat, then poured over half can Golden Mushroom soup mixed with a cup of water. Tasted great but not nearly enough gravy, next time will use whole can of soup and at least one more cup of water. Easy and good. Thanks.

We really liked these, made this with mashed potatoes and used the soup/sauce as a gravy, may thicken it next time. Reminded me of Salisbury Steak.

I didnt have any condensed french onion soup, nor do i think it exists around here so I put in a can of condensed mushroom soup and a little less than a packet of onion soup mix. I mixed those 2 together and added about 3T of water.  I put the steak and the soup mixture in a Look Bag (Glad) or an oven bag, sealed the bag and put it on a cookie sheet in the oven for about 45 min.  The outcome was good but the steak was a little bit dry(I will probably put the meat in for 30 min next time) and the soup didnt seem to have gone thru the meat at all but it was still really good when we put the soup on the meat and we were having mashed potatoes with it so we put the soup on that too.  Delicious!

This is a super-easy recipe that has become a regular at our house. I often use just plain old beef broth to cook the cube steaks in. Makes a good "comfort meal" with mashed potatoes and gravy.

GREAT RECIPE!  I dredged in flour and salt and peppered the steaks.  I browned in a pan.  I used the Lipton dry packaged beefy onion soup mix and 1 cup of water.  I also covered with foil.  I still cooked this for about an hour.  The steaks were very tender and you have a great gravy for your mashed potatoes too!

Love this recipe - very easy and very good. I usually make 6-8 steaks due to family size so I use 2 cans of soup and an extra can of water. I also sprinkle a package of onion soup mix on top. My husband actually went to the store and bought the steaks and brought them home for me to cook this way - that's how much he liked them.

Excellent way to enjoy cube steaks that are not all dried out.  Like others, I used Onion soup mix with a cup of water and added sauteed mushrooms on top, Covered with foil for half the cooking time.

These steaks were very tasty. Having to brown them coated with flour took more time that I'd have liked and it stuck to the pan terribly (even with a small amount of oil to start off with). So my clean up time was increased.

This was real good, not the best I've had... I think I'll add some of my own sautéed mushrooms and onions to add just an extra bit of flavor. But I will make this again, the steaks came out real tender.

"Mmm,Mmm,Mmm"...to quote my roommate.  I didn't have French onion soup so I carmelized some finely chopped onions and added them to a can of beef broth.  Makes a great sandwich.

I don't think the hour cooking time is long enough, mine was still very tough.  The taste though was great and I will try again. (Makes a yummy onion gravy.)  I think I will either try 250* for 3-4 hours in the oven or in the crockpot.  Definitely a good recipe, just needs some adaption.

Extremely easy and good recipe. don't let the lack of ingredients fool you.  The onion soup is a good alternative to fatty gravy.

Fast and easy to throw together. Sprinkled meat with garlic powder and black pepper before searing it.  Used a packet of Lipton onion soup with a cup of water and threw in 1 tsp of beef soup powder.  Covered it while cooking.  Took about 50 minutes to cook.

A minute steak is not the same thing as a cube steak so this description is incorrect.  Cube steaks are round or chuck steaks that are run through a tenderizer thereby cubing it.  A minute steak is a thin cut of round or sirloin that is pounded at home or by the butcher to less than 1/4 inch to tenderize it and allow it to be cooked in appx. a minute per side.   I enjoy both but the description is wrong so 1 star for that error.

It's quick and easy and alright. Just don't cook longer than 30mins. Steak will be way too overcooked and tough. This steak is very thin and doesn't take long to cook. Not sure why they say "over an hour".

This came out very well.  I used the Lipton Onion Soup instead.  Placed steaks in oven only for 40-45 minutes. Would most certainly use this recipe again.

I made this easy recipe for supper. While cooking it smelled great. I did dredge the minute steaks in flour, garlic powder and pepper. I used 1 can of creamy onion soup and 1 can of water   After browning the meat I placed I 13x9 baking dish and covered with tinfoil. Cooked exactly 1 hour and served with mashed potatoes. It was delicious. I wish I had thickened the gravy before serving but there were NO LEFTOVERS at all. I'll make this again for sure

Everyone in my family gobbled these up and thought they were very good.  I dredged in flour, pepper, and garlic powder first and browned in a little oil.  Then put meat on a plate while I drained the grease and deglazed the pan with the French onion soup.  Placed meat back into pan and covered before baking in oven.  Towards the end of the hour, I added a little water.

I made this tonight, and it was really good.  I coated my steaks with flour, and browned them in garlic and herb olive oil.  The flavors mixed well with the french onion soup.  These were also the most tender cube steaks I've ever had.  My husband and 5 year-old loved them.  I served them with herbed new potatoes and veggies, and there are no leftovers!  I will definitely make these again.

We usually only eat Chicken and this was my attempt at being bold. It worked.  We all loved it.  I also did the trick with mixing water and french onion mix.  I'm trying it again tonight with the actual can of soup.  I'm sure it will be great.  My kid needs iron so I'm glad to have found something easy.

This turned out to be the quintessential comfort food for us together with mashed potatoes and homemade bread. I browned them with flour before putting them in the crockpot. The soup made a perfect gravy.

Wonderful, low-budget weeknight meal!  My husband LOVES these incredibly simple steaks and I love how quick I can throw them together!  We call it "Wilson's Poor Man Supper" because it's that inexpensive, but super good!  :)

I too used the dry onion soup mix with one cup of water however instead of putting it in the oven (I'm trying not to overheat the house in the summer), I simmered it on low on the cooktop for 45 minutes and it was very, very good. My family loved it. Will definately do it again.

Pretty good recipe. I doubled the amount of steaks for my family and used 1 can of the french onion and 1 can of cream of mushroom all mixed together. The meat came out pretty tender. Will probably make again, but increase the gravy/soup. I made it with mashed potatoes and my family likes a lot of gravy for the potatoes.

A very easy recipe with ingredients you'll most likely have on hand.  This dish tastes as though all you did was add a can of onion soup.  However, it's good and quick and something that I'll be going back to.  Serve with mashed potatoes and broccoli for an excellent, quick meal.

Are you supposed to cover the steaks when you put them in the oven? Ours were very dry! Maybe an hour was too long? I may try to make these again and cover it with foil for less time.

What a delicious and tender way to enjoy minute steak!
I didn't have any condensed soup in the house so I used a couple of packets of Chinees soup that had been in my cupboard - the kind of soup that you add an egg to. 
So I put 3 sachets of beef based Chinese soup into an oven-proof pan, added the water and eggs per directions. Next I cut 8 pieces of minute steak into very small pieces and added this to the pan with salt and pepper and a dash of a mild Thai sauce for additional flavoring.
I baked it in the oven at 350 for one hour and it was done! The soup had turned into a lovely gravy - not too thick/not too thin (must have been the eggs) and you know what? I served it over scrambled eggs with a slice of buttered toast on the side. Having cut the steak up so small meant it didn't smother the scrambled eggs. 
And there you have a different version of steak and eggs! We had this for supper but I think it would make a great and unique breafast for a special occasion.
Thanks Amy for a great recipe!

This was a good recipe for our family.  The meat was a little tough but that's the fault of the cut of meat, in my opinion.  We seasoned the flour with salt, pepper and garlic salt.  We didn't have French Onion soup so I used Cream of Mushroom and onion soup mix in the baking pan and covered with foil as others have suggested.  We ate with rice.  We will make this again.

This recipe is easy and simple, however my steaks turned out tough. I bought them from my usual grocer whose steaks usually are tender. I added pepper, salt and garlic powder prior to browning them. If your in a bind for a quick meal, this is a good recipe but I wasn't very impressed with the end result. Sorry :(

I was looking for a recipe for minute steaks since I recently purchased 1/4 cow and didn't know how to use all the meat.  I thought this recipe was great - with a few alterations.  First of all I seasoned the meat with salt and pepper before browning.  Then I just used french onion soup because I didn't have any cream of mushroom, but would like to try it in the future, per other people's suggestions.  Then I added some fresh mushrooms before baking it at only 325 for an hour.  The meat wasn't dry at all.  I'll make it again.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I breaded my steaks prior to browning them and added some mushrooms, bell peppers, and thin sliced potatoes on top and then baked.  Its become a favorite with my family.

The flavor of the soup with the meat was good, but by following the directions, the meat becomes very dry.  The tempature should be lower.

Don't know what happened, but mine turned out incredibly dry, and I followed the recipe exactly.  Sorry, but will not be making this again.

This is a great recipe for a quick meal!  I season the meat and also add a can of mushroom soup for more gravy.  Simple and tasty!

I would suggest that the recipe be cooked longer than a hour,if the meat that is used is thick. I cooked mine for 2 hours and added fresh mushrooms along with some beef bouillon. My 7 year old just commented to me, that it didn't look nice but tasted so so good. Thank you for this recipe.

I will give this recipe 4 stars because it wasn't incredible but it did save my life last night. It is indeed fast, easy and cheap, the taste is very strong, oniony and beefy like my hubby said.

Added more water included some condiments like basil and it was good, excellent sauce but a little too oniony for my taste.  

It doesn't go great with mash potatos, rice and a good french beer made the trick. My hubby said " it is good".

My husband thought it was just okay.  Our picky eaters ate it without complaint, so that is a plus. I think next time I will add some beef broth.  No one ate the left overs.

Meat was dry, but adding cream of mushroom soup to the french onion soup made the most wonderful gravy.  Will make again using thicker steaks!

This was not the best recipe, but have to give it 4 stars because you cant get any easier than this. It was kind of boring and need something else. I added garlic, a few crushed hot peppers to kick it up.

I tried this recipe using the suggestions others had made, and the meat still came out too dry.  I probably would not use this recipe again.

This was good and easy.  I took other reviewer's advice and mixed my onion soup with mushroom soup at the end of baking to make gravy for the meat and potatoes.  Unless you really like salty food, you may not want to salt the meat since there is enough sodium in the soup(s).  I also added some baby portabellas in the pan to bake with the meat and soup.

Nice recipe.  Next time, I think I'll use all the onions and only some of the sauce.  I ended up with cube steaks in a small "lake" of hot soup.  But tasty nonetheless, w/mashed potatoes and snap peas.

Made this last night.  Absolutely awesome!  And soooooo easy.  Made 2 changes - added 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup and covered with foil as had been suggested by others.  Served with the "Whipped Mashed Potatoes" recipe on this website.  I definitely will be making this again soon!

I dredged these in flour before browning as others suggested, added no extra salt and used 1/2 a can each of golden mushroom and french onion soup. Tasted great to me and hubbie. Thanks for a new recipe!

My boyfriend found your recipe a few weeks ago and surprised me with dinner when I got home. It was WONDERFUL!! I love how the onion soup and steak juice makes its' own gravy as it cooks in the oven. He made it with garlic mashed potatoes and the gravy was great to pour over them. Tonight I am making the steaks, but am going to put mushrooms over top along with the onion soup. I'm sure it will taste great! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Very good flavor, but thought the meat turned out a little dry.  Next time I make it, I will try covering the pan with tin-foil to keep it more moist.  We used the soup drippings as au jus, it was yummy!
