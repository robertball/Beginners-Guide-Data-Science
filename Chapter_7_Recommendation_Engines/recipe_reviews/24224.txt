This is an excellent main dish.  In my opinion, it is not a side dish as I saw someone else thought it should be used for.  
But, I do make it a bit different and don't know if it's better because of the changes.  
I fry the bacon seperate from the ground beef and cook it until crisp, but not burnt.  Then I brown the ground beef.  It will take longer then cooking them together, but recipe is very good when the bacon is cooked crisp.  I also mix the brown sugar (1 C) with the ketchup to form a sauce.  I then mix all the ingredients.  I also do not use mustard or vinegar and it is always a huge hit!
I saw some commented that they disliked the butter beans.  Although I like the butter beans I always try to find baby butter beans since there not so big.  Really much better in this dish then regular butter beans.

Wow, awesome recipe.  I made this for a BBQ I went to and everyone wanted the recipe.  I used 2 cans of baked beans in chile sauce which I did not drain.  I drained the two other cans of beans, one was kidney, one was pinto. I used a pound of bacon, fried it crisp and crumbled it into the beans when everything was mixed.  In the bacon grease, I sauteed 1/2 cup onion, 1/2 cup green pepper, and 1/2 cup red pepper.  My family loved it and I am making it for the third time in two weeks.  My older sons fought over who was taking the little bit of leftovers home. You have to try it!!  Easy and delicious.

I have a very similar recipe that I have been making for years.  It was given to me by a friend.  It is the best potluck/barbeque recipe!  Everyone loves it.  I usually use this instead of traditional baked beans.  It is a meal in itself.  Very good in a crock pot too, however I still like to cook it mostly in the oven then finish in a crock pot for potlucks.  The taste is better in the oven.

Great recipe, however you don't need to use nearly that much sugar.  Also drain your kidney and butter beans slightly or you will have too much liquid. BBQ beans work great in place of baked beans with pork...something I can't find here in Africa.  Make extra and freeze, you will be glad you did.

I have this recipe from a church cookbook that is really good, the only differance is to use only 1/2 c. brown sugar & instead of baked beans use a can of chili beans that will make a differance in the sweetness

This is a great recipe.... can also be made in a crock pot (cook approx 4-6 hours on high) instead of being baked.  Provides a great aroma through-out the house all day!

i also add to this recipe cut up red and green pepper and I use what ever beans I have in the cabinet.  I have made it with ground turkey and turkey bacon before and it came out just as good.  I have made this recipe for years for hunting camp and picnics and it always disappears even if people swear they don't like beans!!!!

these beans were absolutley delicious!!! we've made them three times already! they are flavorful, easy , and are always eaten up super fast! the only thing i would suggest is to bake the beans for the half the time, covered, and the other half take the cover off and let some of the liquid drain off. if u leave the cover off the whole time they will be to thick, and if it is on the whole time there will be to much liquid. another suggestion, this casserole works great with any kind of bean, so don't bother with specifics, just use what's on hand. hope this helps

I only had 1/3 cup of brown sugar and I forgot to put in the mustard, but this dish still turned out very good. I drained my beans for a thicker consistency and served it as a main dish with cornbread.

I printed this recipe up several years ago and finally got around to making it.  It is delicious.  I didn't change a thing.  The kidney beans didn't cook up as well as the other beans but still quite tasty.  This is the perfect dish to take to a gathering.  Just be sure to serve with a slotted spoon as it is quite juicy.

I've eaten variations of this dish countless times at barbeques, etc., but I'd never made it before.  I had a bunch of people expected for a very informal, quick dinner and this seemed a good entree.  I doubled the recipe and put in a full pound of bacon, cooked crisp and drained.  I used kidney beans, great northern beans and canned baked beans.  Lean ground beef.  The vinegar and dry mustard were indispensable, in my opinion: they provide the tang.  I added some chopped garlic to the chopped onions; garlic can play a wonderful starring role, but it also does amazing things in a supporting role.  Didn't put much in.  Also added a little ground cloves, not enough to recognize, just enough to add the deep complexity cloves has.  I used white sugar and molasses as I was out of brown sugar, but only about 1/3 C. for the whole double batch.  If I added 1 1/2 C. of sugar to this, I could have just sliced it, added a dollop of whipped cream and served it for dessert.  Don't understand the taste for overwhelming sweetness in main dishes.  Anyway, it was fantastic: meaty, thick, tangy and DELICIOUS!  Thank you for the recipe.

A recipe that you really can't mess up and you can substitute as you need.  I doubled the recipe as I was serving at least 12 adults.  I used 2 28 oz cans of Bush's Original Baked Beans, 1 can of northern beans (drained) and one can of red kidney beans (drained).  2 lbs of ground beef and one pound of bacon.  1 cup ketchup.  I used some yellow mustard - a good couple of squirts, 1 tsp. liquid smoke, 1 cup of brown sugar, and 1 tbsp white vinegar.... browned the beef and baked the bacon in the oven.  I threw it all in a crockpot for about 4-6 hours.  You could use whatever beans you have on hand.  Sub BBQ sauce for some or all of the ketchup.  Delicious - as a side or as the main dish.

This particular version of Calico beans is way too sweet. Cut down on the sugar most definitely. The origianl recipe calls for about 1/4 cup of sugar. I've been making this for about 30 years. I can no longer have the sugar, catsup, or beans (diabetes), and this is one recipe I really miss. It's always a hit at picnics. Do drain the beans. The original recipe calls for undrained beans. This comes together quickly, so it's not a pain to make.

I think it behooves people to act like ladies and gentleman. No matter how old we are, we must remember our manners. It is helpful, too, to actually try a recipe before judging. Otherwise,  it makes one look like a nasty, inconsiderate oaf. This was a decent stew, quick to make and perfect for a cold day.

Up the bacon a tad...cut brown sugar to 1/2 cup, and add a couple good squirts of maple syrup....it takes it over the top.

I worked for 8 orthopaedic doctors and took this, in a slow cooker after letting it do it's thing on a low setting overnight, into work for a potluck luncheon.  I only had pinto beans on hand so used that in place of kidney beans, added a can of Bush's baked beans with pork, reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and these were the only changes I made.  After the luncheon I had 18 requests for the recipe, 5 were from the doctors, 4 from RN's;  big success?  I'll say!!!

I've made this recipie for at least 12 years. My sister in law gave me thier family recipie. This is so easy and hearty that this and a break of french or sour dough roll, or your favorite bread choice.
I personally add 1 tablespoon of the vinegar, 1 cup of crumbled bacon, 4oz is not enough and 1 can of Garbanzo beans. So I would say add ingredints to taste and Enjoy.

This is the best recipe using a combination of canned beans that I have found to date.  No need to change any of the ingredients.  I liked how it came out so thick--a lot of similar recipes, for me at least, turn out way too saucy.  Good BBQ-y flavor, too.  My main suggestion is that if you want to skip washing that extra mixing bowl, use a large pot to fry the ground beef/bacon/onion mixture; then after draining (if you need to--I found that I didn't), mix in the cans of beans and then mix in the remaining ingredients.  Then you can pour it directly into your baking pan.  I also decided to use a large (28 oz.) can of baked beans, and I baked the casserole for a total of 50 minutes, until it was bubbling around the edges.  I let it sit for 10 or 15 minutes after taking it from the oven while I made some biscuits to go with it.

This is a good recipe, but much better if you substitute a pound of good bulk sausage (Jimmy Dean Country Mild is our favorite) instead of the ground beef.  Much more umpf!  We also add a cup of frozen corn.  Then add a good hearty dash of Hot Sauce.  Yum!!

Johnsonville recently challenged some of us to pick a favorite recipe and do a make-over utilizing one of their products.  Although I have a family Calico Beans recipe I’ve been making for many years, I selected this one based not only on the number of reviews, but also the 4-1/2 star rating.  No offense to the recipe author, but here’s how I changed her recipe.  First, I substituted half of the ground beef with Johnsonville Mild Italian Ground Sausage which worked well.  I cut the brown sugar back to 1/2 cup and next time would cut it back to 1/4 cup.  We’re not big “sweet” eaters, so this is totally personal preference.  I drained all cans of beans but reserved the liquid, and after combining everything, added some of the reserved liquid back to the pan, but not all.  Finally, I used garlic salt instead of regular salt and baked for about 45 minutes.  My family recipe calls for regular yellow mustard, but I will say that I liked the dry mustard MUCH better.  Dee Dee, I’m sure your recipe is excellent because 173 people have tried it and given it high reviews.  But this version turned out really well, too.  Either way, I still LOVE Calico Beans.

This recipe has been in our family for decades (my aunt gave it to my mom probably 30+ years ago) and it is always a crowd pleaser at potlucks and BBQs.  I usually substitute canned lima beans instead of butter beans, and sometimes cook a gourmet bean blend with a variety of beans, peas and lentils, instead of the canned beans, and that is great too.  I don't eat beef now, so I use ground turkey instead of beef, and cut back a little on the brown sugar, but any which way you make this dish, it turns out wonderful and people want the recipe.  Can't go wrong....

I have been making this dish for years and it is always a hit wherever I bring it. It is one of those forgiving recipes...no ketchup? Add salsa? Don't like butter beans? Add black beans. As long as you keep the ratio close it is a winner. I have even left out the ground beef and added a pound of bacon and I like that best of all. Can easily put in a crock pot but I think comes out best when baked.

I had a similiar recipe years ago...that I just loved. Used five different beans...all drained, kidney, butter beans, french cut green beans, pork and beans, and lima beans.  I used half pound of bacon cut up and fried crisp...drained. lb of ground meat browned a chopped onion. What was great was the salty sweet taste, and all those beans ...well has to be good. I think as long as you use the ketchup, vinegar and brown sugar..you can use whatever beans you have.  Great with cornbread or rolls.

soooo good!  i grew up having this casserole at family reunion potlucks and always loved it.  my mom isn't a fan of beans and didn't make it, though.   i used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and cider vinegar instead of white, and i didn't have any dry mustard so i used a big squirt of french's regular mustard.  came out great!

I browned the ground beef and fried the bacon until crisp, then threw everything in the crockpot on high for 5 hours...perfect!

Used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and topped with shredded cheese and scallion on individual servings. Kids were in heaven. Great BBQ potluck dish!

I would give it more stars if it used less sugar. I also have made it on the stovetop with out baking and cooked it in the oven by adding biscuits on top in the winter.

This was good...changed two things. Reduced the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon and used ground turkey instead of hamburger.  Next time will substitute baked beans for something else.  Even with the reduced sugar, it was still a little too sweet my my tastes.

I doubled this recipe and froze a couple of dishes for later.  I used 6 different kinds of beans and a double sized can of baked beans.  It was delicious, my only suggestion would be to stir it and let it sit a few minutes after taking out of the oven for the sauce to thicken up a bit.

Love this recipe!  Last time I made it I fried the bacon separately and I used 1/2 lb. of sausage and 1/4 c. red pepper, 1/4 c. orange pepper, 1 stalk celery and 1/2 chopped onion.  I lowered the Brown Sugar to 1/2 cup.  Oh my was this good.  I brought home about 3/4 c. and that quickly disappeared.

We LOVED this recipe. Followed the recipe almost to the T...I did cook the bacon by itself, and sauteed the onion with 1/2 of a chopped red pepper. I would consider this a main dish. Husband said to put it on the list!

This is a staple at all family gatherings.  My version of the recipe calls for 1 tblsp liquid smoke.  I always drain and rinse my beans to remove as much salt as possible.  If your mixture is a little dry after rinsing the beans, add more ketchup and prepared mustard.  We add Dijon.  The flavor of this dish is even better the second day after the ingredients have been allowed to marry overnight.  This is an easy casserole to prepare a day ahead and put into the fridge to bake the following day.  Take your casserole out of the fridge 1/2 hour before baking so it comes up to room temp.  Great as a topper on baked potatoes topped with shredded cheddar cheese.  Kids like to add sliced hot dogs or Wranglers to make it a main dish for them.

This has been a dish that has been a favorite in our family for many years.  You can substitute many different types of beans. Our original family recipe called for lima beans with the pork-n-beans and kidney beans. But you can pretty much use any three been variation.  As a time saver I have found that you can use a good ready cooked microwave bacon instead of cooking the bacon from raw.  It tastes exactly the same.  I also like many others do not cook the bacon with the hamburger.  Its been everyones favorite for as long as I can remember!

I have been making this recips for years and it is a family favorite. As another reviewer suggested, I fry the bacon separately from the hamburger so it crisps and sweat the onion in the drippings.   I use  three cans of pork and beans in tomato sauce made by a company beginning with C who also makes soup.   When my son visits from overseas, this is his requested homecoming meal.

A tweak that I use in this is to use smoked sausage cut in 1/4 inch rounds instead of the ground beef.  I also use 4 cans of beans-usually add black beans to what recipe calls for and drain and rinse all but the baked beans-Bush's of course!  Reduce the brown sugar but sometimes add a little molasses, use more onion and a little green or red or both adds to the flavor levels.  Great recipe-for us it's a meal and add some corn muffins-perfect!!

I've made this recipe 3 times already and every bit is always gone. You really can't mess up this recipe & its so easy to substitute the ingredients. Great as a side dish or main meal with salads & bread & butter. I always prefry the bacon separate so its not soggy.  A real crowd pleaser :>)

This is a great bean bake.  We have had it as a main dish with fresh crusty bread and it is a wonderful meal.  My Mother makes this as well for family get togethers.  I do scale back on the sugar a bit, but otherwise love it.

These beans are awesome!  Even if you are not a fan of beans, you'll like this dish.  I've made this recipe many many times, frequently for new groups of people, and I'm always asked for the recipe.  If you are rushed for time and don't want the mess of frying the bacon, do like I do - buy the pre-cooked bacon that you can find with the croutons and salad dressing at the market.  Just make sure it's really bacon and not that fake stuff!

It's really good. I slow cooked it for six hours on low instead of using an oven and it turned out well. TOO well. Now my mom wants me to make it for every family outing. There's a birthday in the family, make the beans. We're going on camping trip that you're not going on, make the beans. I'd give it 5 stars, but  it loses a star for being annoying. 4/5

I have made this for many years.  I also cook the bacon separately (make it crisp) but reserve the bacon until ready to put in the oven.  Just lay the bacon on top of the casserole.  When serving the casserole, the bacon breaks up but stays crisp.  Unfortunately, the more bacon you add, the better.  I use half a pound.

I usually don't make Baked beans but was asked to bring to a party.  Found this recipe and after all the comments and empty crockpot, I will put this in my use column.  My grown son wanted to know where these beans have been all his life!!  I used elk burger instead of hamburger and only added a 1/4cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of ketchup as I am diabetic and it still was great.  That was making a double batch!

I've made this recipe for years and I do nothing but brown the ground beef & onions then dump that and all the rest of the ingredients in to the crockpot and let it go on low overnight or ALL day.  I don't precook the bacon and I don't even drain the beans!  I double the recipe and use 1 can black beans, 1 can white beans, and 2 cans kidney beans.  Couldn't be easier or tastier!

I have been using this recipe for years. When I ask, "what can I bring" this is always the request. The only think I do differently is I usually use half pound of bacon and I use slice green beans rather than butter beans. The green beans are a really nice contrast in color and I think much tastier and less dry than butter beans.

Very delicous dish!  I was skeptical but it really is fantastic.  A few modifications- i added chopped green pepper and garlie to the meat mixture and only used a 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Really a great dish!

Wonderful summer staple for outdoor grilling.  I've made it three weekends in a row for a side while entertaining this year.  I actually double the recipe and have copies of the recipe ready to hand out.  The only change I've made is to add a chopped green pepper per pound of ground beef .  Yummy!!

this is a wonderful quick side dish OR main meal too. I have made it as written and is a 5 star. I usually leave out the vinegar (there is enough in the ketchup and mustard) and use prepared mustard instead of dry..which I don't always have on hand. I sometimes add green and red pepper too.  Lots you can do with this. sometimes black beans or pinto beans....what ever I have on hand! Don't always bake it either. GREAT hot OR cold!!

It was good. I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and next time I would only use 1/4 cup. With the can of baked beans it was already pretty sweet.

I have been using this recipe for years, my family loves it, we substitute french style green beans (drain and rinse) for butter beans and barbecue sauce for ketchup, makes it a little more spicy.  It is great!

I agree that it is too sweet even substituting tomato soup for the ketchup.  I think it has great potential though.  I tried making this recipe with Pork and Beans instead of Baked Beans.  That did the trick!

This is the best baked bean recipe I have ever tried!  

I used great northern beans instead of the butter beans because of family preferences.  I doubled the recipe and added 1/4 cup more brown sugar, again because we like a little more brown sugar in our beans.  Everyone raved over the beans. 

I would highly recommend this recipe!!

This is so delicious!  We changed it up a bit.  We used  tomato paste instead of ketchup and left out the brown sugar and bacon.  We figured this would save us some un-needed calories plus we don't like overly sweet beans.  We also added about 1 tsp chopped rosemary!  So good!  There was enough sweetness from the can of pork and beans.  I can't imagine how sweet these would be with all that brown sugar.

A quick throw together kind of recipe, I like. While I made this 2 ways, to suit me using Johnsonville Sausages. It worked out in my favor. While both have distinct flavors because the seasonings in the sweet italian sausages, I noticed one stand out flavor above both variations....is that it has too much dry mustard powder in it, causing a slight twang, that was not so kosher with my husband. Reduce the mustard in this recipe to nearly half the recommended in this recipe and you will find it to be a whole lot tastier. I also loved the Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausage in this better then the ground beef. The recipe in the 2nd batch had more sauce, even though I made them extactly the same with the directions. My kids loved both. Will make again with the adjustments to the mustard.

I have made this dish for years, but I've always called them "Cheater Beans." In place the of kidney beans (not a fan), I use pinto beans and Bush's Bourbon & Brown Sugar Grillin' Beans in place of the baked beans with pork. Instead of 1/2 cup of ketchup, I use 1/4 cup and another 1/4 cup of chile sauce with a dash of hot sauce for a little kick. I also use a pound of bacon and cook it separately from the ground beef and onion, to give it a crispness. Cooking it chopped with the beef/onions can make some of it burn and not cook uniformly. I cook the bacon in strips, then crumble into the rest of the mixture after it cools and drains a bit. And I use a whole sweet onion. This dish is wonderful for potlucks, BBQ's or just a simple, delicious mid-week meal!

I have been making this recipe for years, the only difference in the recipe I use is that it calls for chili sauce instead of ketcup...gives a little zip.  Gets raves everytime, and there is seldom any leftovers.  Adapts well to the Crockpot too!

My Mom has been making this recipe for over 30 years, she got the recipe from the Grass & Grain newspaper.  We lived on a cattle ranch and she usually had 7 - 8 cowboys to feed a day.  We always called it Cowboy Beans, always a hit no matter where I have taken it.

My husband's Grandma made a recipe very close to this that was always a huge hit! She fried the bacon separate as someone suggested and mixed her sauce separate. ( lots of times she made them without the bacon and they were still nummy) She used 1/2 cup ketchup, 3 TBLS molasses, TBLS vinegar. In addition to the beans mentioned she added a can of pork n beans. she did hers in a crockpot.

I use the recipe is a base for a lot of different things. A great go-to recipe when I don't know what to make. It's a little too sweet for my taste so I usually cut out a bunch of the sugar. I never have cans of porknbeans or butter beans, I usually use just pinto, kidney and black beans. Sometimes I throw in some sliced up hotdogs or bologna. It's definitely a recipe that you can play around with and not have to worry about messing it up.

This is really sweet. Oh my gosh; crazy sweet. I didn't use the bacon, but I can't imagine it mattering that much; even if it were slightly smokier, it would still be crazy sweet. I even decreased the brown sugar by a third. Not bad - we did eat it - but I don't think it'll make a repeat appearance. Thanks anyway!

This is delicious! My modifications: I only used black beans cuz they're all I had on hand. I didn't add onions cuz I was lazy. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, but did add a smidge of Pampered Chef's Maple Honey Mustard Sauce and a shake of PC's Smoky Barbecue Rub. The beans are fantastic! I'll be making this again and again. Thanks for a really easy peasy health recipe. I ate it over jasmine rice for the perfect protein (beans and rice mix).

Who would have thought beans could be so tasty?  They were great as a main dish.  I used more bacon than was called for.  I believe that they made the dish.

I've been making variations of this recipe for many years.  You can do it on the stove top in a heavy stock pot...or slow cooker.  Great to use kielbasa, chorizo or ground turkey.  Use Real Bacon bits for less fat..and be sure to add Hungarian Paprika and then some red pepper flakes if you like it a little spicy.  Best made the day before serving to really blend the flavors.

Great recipe! There are several variations out there. It is a hearty meal all by itself and always goes over well with guys.. I use ground turkey, omit the ketchup, vinegar and sugar and add lots of spicy brown mustard and garlic to taste.

Looks really good but was reluctant to consider trying because I don't eat/use ketchup and don't like beans with pork. After reading all the reviews I am looking forward to making my own small changes and enjoying this as a main course.

I made this just as written, except that I used extra onion, and it turned out great--very flavorful.  I also cooked it on the stovetop instead of in the oven.

Just made this yesterday for the Super Bowl in combination to my Mother's recipe. Everything was the same except the amount of brown sugar was cut to 1/2c & hamburger was at 3/4lb. I did add 1/4c of white sugar. Not sure why others were saying too sweet, I love it!!!  Good & thick. My husband is not a huge bean fan but thought this was similar to chili, and consumed two HUGE bowls. Will definitely make again.

Cut back a bit on the sugar and it's great.  A definite keeper.  Will try next time with some green pepper.

I have been making this recipe for 30 years.  It's always a crowd pleaser and I do serve it as a "side" dish.  I use Bush's Original Recipe baked beans and fry my onion just till soft in the bacon grease, then add it to the bean mixture.

my dear elderly aunt makes a similar recipe and at every gathering, everyone always expects her to bring 'her beans'.  This served as a nice base.  I doubled the bean amount and kept the meat amounts the same (had 1.30# ground round) This fits very nicely doubled into a 6 quart crockpot.  I used 2 packages of lipton 'beefy onion' soup mix, as well as 1 large onion and 2 cloves garlic.  Used honeycup sharp mustard for the powder, worstershire, and less brown sugar.  Used a bag of the 15 beans, limas, black beans, kidneys, garbanzos.  The larger variety of beans give it more eye-appeal.  Just play around with this recipe and you will be pleasantly surprised.  Since I cooked my own garbanzos and 15 beans from dry, I added a little more liquid to help them not be dry once they had absorbed more liquid during cooking.  I put them together the day before because I remember these taste even better the next day.

Great in the crockpot and as leftovers.  I used a mixture of beans and extra beef.  I also through in a can of diced tomatoes.  Yummy.

This is the best baked bean dish I have tasted. It is hearty and men especially like it. Very Good to take to picnics, potlucks etc. Tastes good with potato and macaroni salads and grilled meat.

Very good.  I drained all the beans except the pork and beans.  I also used more sugar (I've got a sweet tooth) and more onion.  I've had a similar recipe where the person also used lima beans... I might try adding that.  Next time I will also cook the bacon separately like another chef recommended.  I don't like soggy bacon.  With these changes it is a 5-star recipe.

Something was off about this for me. If it’s supposed to be eaten as a meal, it’s too sweet & I’d prefer it be seasoned more like traditional chili. If it’s supposed to be a baked beans side dish, it doesn’t have that flavor profile either. I tasted it after adding each ingredient from the recipe. It started tasting off to me after I added the vinegar (and I love vinegar). Even before I added sugar I wasn’t a fan, so I don’t think it’s the sweetness. I wanted to like this, but it just didn’t make sense to my taste buds.

We like this as a side dish so I use only about 1/4 pound ground beef--just enough to make people wonder what's in it. Honestly, it's just the right amount! I also drain the beans, otherwise too soupy. Beans can easily be swapped out per individual taste preference.  Great recipe. Have been making it for decades!

For the beans I substituted three cans of tri-bean blend (kidney, pinto, black).  I pre-cooked the bacon just a bit to ensure it was done to my liking (just sky of crispy) at the end of the cooking time.  We ate it with rice,  and sealed the leftovers in lunch-size servings.  Delicious!   Definitely will make again.

It is baked beans made more substantial with ground beef.  It would be a great pot luck item.  I happen to love baked beans so this recipe makes it something I can serve as a main dish.  It is a great dish to put in the oven when you've got a lot to do because if it cooks longer it only gets better (to a point).

This is a mandatory dish at our family reunion. I rarely measure anything and change it up every once in a while, but even though they never come out the same way twice, everyone loves them. I use all of the listed ingredients with the exception of dry mustard, I use prepared and I use cider vinegar instead of white. I also cook the bacon until crisp and remove and drain it leaving some of the bacon grease in the pan to saute the onions in. I cook the ground beef separately so that I can drain the grease off of it. With the exception of the pork and beans, I drain and rinse all of the other beans. I use dark red kidneys, baby butter beans because they are closer in size to the others and pinto beans. I always add lightly sauteed red and green bell peppers and sometimes hot Hungarian wax peppers. I also sometimes add sauteed matchstick cut carrots. If I have an opened bottle of barbeque sauce in the fridge, I put some of that in as well. I have made this with all ground beef and with beef and sausage, either way it is alway a hit. I take it to the reunion in a six quart slow cooker and I am disappointed if there is not any leftover since it's just the two of us and it makes too much to be practical to make regularly at home. You really can't go wrong with this when you adapt it to suit your tastes. If you don't like really sweet baked beans, use less sugar. If you like a little heat add hot pepper. The key to a successful recipe is to taste as you go and adjust accordingly.

Amazing and hearty. I didn't have any kidney beans so I substituted black beans. I did drain the kidney beans and black beans first but not the baked beans. I also added some boneless pork ribs. Definitely a keeper!

Dee Dee this was a great dish.  I am sorry that I didn't follow your recipe exactly because I listened to others and added less brown sugar, when it definitely needed what you recommended.  However my husband and I and my grandchildren really loved it.  I will definitely make it again for my barbecue this weekend.

Absolutely delicious!  Can never make enough!  The only thing I changed was to use the whole pound of bacon (I know) and I let that cook by itself a bit first, then added chopped onion and cooked both until bacon crisped up a little.  Then I added the beef and cooked until brown, and only then did I drain off the extra fat.  Obviously not the healthiest, but certainly the tastiest!

A huge hit with my family!!  Used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup because I was low on ketchup.  A bit watery the first night but beans seemed to absorb the liquid by day two.  Edited addition - since husband isn't fond of mustard, I reduced that to 1 teaspoon.  Also, drained the butter beans & kidney beans and reduced brown sugar to 1/2 C.

Note to self:  My version of this dish located in MS Word.

I have tried calico beans at a cookout before & loved them.  This Independence Day I decided I'd make one after running across this recipe. I made it the night before as recipe stated but instead of baking in oven, I made stove top.  Before I set it in fridge I tried it.  It was good, but I felt as if it was missing something...  I'm not sure what flavor could be missing and that is why I only rated a 4*.  It's good, but not the best I've tried.  I agree with others, it can be a meal in itself.  It can even be served over rice or baked potato if you have leftovers.**REVISED**I learned the reason for the difference of taste is that I am used to a recipe that has 1/2 beef, 1/2 pork sausage meat blend.  I did have people tell me they enjoyed this bean recipe.  I will try the sausage/beef blend next.

I forgot the mustard, but it was still delicious. I used beans I had on hand, baked beans, kidney beans, and Great Northern beans instead of butter beans. Very delicious recipe, my kids all gobbled it up so there were no leftovers. Thanks!

I have been making this for ever, it is def a 5 star!!  Great for potluck or BBQ's, rarely have leftovers!! I use 1 1/2# hamburger and 1# bacon, 2 lg cans of Bush beans, 2 cans each of kidney and butter, drained and rinsed, 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar and 2T molasses.  Oh, don't forget the garlic.  Adjust the proportions to meet your own taste. Yes is does have a lot of sugar but oh, so yummy!!

I love this dish. I make my own variation with venison OFTEN... and bring it EVERYWHERE I need to contribute a dish. If they like venison they love it if they don't, they won't even try it which is too bad because it really is a tasty dish.

I know everyone hates it when you change the recipe however since I need to watch I am always looking for how I can replicate the delicious recipe but with healthier options substituted. So, for those who are in my boat: This recipe is GREAT and hard to mess up. I substituted ground turkey, turkey bacon, vegetarian baked beans, reduced sugar ketchup, and honestly did not think it needed the brown sugar. Depending on your canned baked beans, you might want a little sweetness but if so add it T by T at the end .... you don't need much. Also, since veggies are a dieters' best friend I added way more frozen baby limas, corn, and would have added green pepper too if I had some. Also, more onions ( I always use shallots) and a little garlic paste. So good I can hardly believe it's not decadent. Even with the substitutions, this recipe still wows a regular crowd.

This recipe is almost identical to one I've used for over 25 years, the only difference is the addition of the butter beans, which can only improve this recipe if that is possible.   Every time I make it, someone askes for the recipe.  When our children were still at home I made a triple recipe just to have some left overs!

I received almost the exact same recipe from my Mom years ago, the only difference is that in place of white vinegar her recipe calls for 2 T molasses.  I have modified it over the years and in place of bacon I use turkey bacon and in place of ground beef I use ground turkey breast.  I also changed out the butter beans and use white cannelini beans, reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and omit the onions and they taste great this way, too.  It really is an easy recipe that you can make adjustments to according to your preferences.

I've made this main dish for years.  It makes an excellent "dish to pass" but be prepared because everyone will ask for the recipe.  You can truly use any beans you like as long as you use some pork and beans.  My original recipe came from my mother many, many years ago and used all pork and beans.  I like to bake up a batch of Boston Brown Bread to serve on the side.  Also works well in a slow cooker.

This is a good recipe but to me it's better with some ground sausage in it too. I have made this for years and years. I use equal amount of bacon, lean ground beef and lean sausage. I don't use vinegar and after trying it, I'll be taking it out. It was too sweet so I'll cut way back on the sugar and I like to add some molasses.

I like this recipe for Calico Beans - another recipe called for a can of green beans too and I liked it even better with them added.  I put in the crock pot and they were delicious!  I served with a baked potato and it made a great meal.

Always a hit - I use pork-n-beans, black beans and garbanzo beans, sub ground breakfast sausage for ground beef, leave out the sugar all together and do not drain the beans.  It is excellent over rice!

This is a really good recipe, it was a huge hit at a Coast Guard BBQ I went to. The only thing I did differently was I put 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar.

Got this receipt from a friend and had to make it myself! I doubled it for a party and it was a hit.  I sub butter beans for navy beans.  As others have recommended , I strained the beans to make it thicker.  Next time I will fry the bacon first to get it more crunchy.  I did bake this but the receipt didn't call to cover it.  BIG Mistake..had some crunchy Kidney beans-YIKES!! Will either cover or try crock pot next time. Excellent keeper receipt!

I've actually been making this recipe for about 20 years. It's very versatile. You can substitute different beans (keep the baked beans, though). I leave out the onions - picky eaters here. Delicious!

Yummy, just like my mom made when I was a kid.  I took it to a pot luck, I should've put a label on it though because people thought it was chili and were shocked when they took a bite.

I am vegan and easily adjusted this recipe  using Yves veggie ground round and soy bacon bits.  It makes a hearty dinner that my whole family enjoys for pennies.  We like it on baked potatoes.

Okay so this was too sweet for me...I don't mind sides this sweet but the main course!?  Maybe it was the type of baked beans I used or something.  It did taste a lot better after adding chili powder and some jalapenos to give it some spice and tone down the sweetness.  I did drain half the juice in each can of beans and it was the perfect juicieness (SP?)  If you use all the juice it will probably be soupy.

This is similar to a recipe I have been making for years.  It is good, but when I make it again, I will increase the ketchup, sugar and vinegar to give it a little more flavor.  I think I will also drain and rinse the canned beans, which I didn't do this time as I was in a hurry.

I just made a double batch of this recipe in the slow cooker for a family party.  My brother called the next day to say how much he liked it.  It was easy and delicious.

The beans needed to be drained a bit, but otherwise, really excellent. We used Boca Ground Burger instead of beef. It tastes a LOT like a meatloaf recipe that I really like, only more filling and healthy due to the beans.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I am a big bean fan in general.  I cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup (because I've had sugary beans in the past), I exchanged butter beans for green lima beans. I cut out the vinegar because I don't ever have any (!?) But it was Very TASTY. I said to my husband: this was really good, but it'd probably make a great side dish in smaller portions.

This is wonderful!!! I doubled the amount and added green peppers, red peppers and minced garlic. Next time, I think I'll added some diced tomatoes and perhaps, some mild chili powder. Thank you for a great comfort food dish!!!

This was REALLY easy, but it bombed at our house.  It was too sweet.  Because it is so easy though, I think I'll try it again, using only 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.

My boyfriend LOVED this recipe!! He loved the sweetness (just right) and the ground beef.  He looked at it funny at first.  With the bacon pieces in it-it looks kinda nasty...but once he knew it was bacon and tasted it...OH MY GOODNESS, HE CLEANED THE WHOLE DISH OUT-WITH MY HELP--IN TWO
NIGHTS--and I made a LARGE casserole dish of it.  Thanks!  It was just what I was looking for.

I was very excited to try this and thought all the ingredients are tasty on their own so together would be great. Wrong. Wayyyyy too sweet and I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I love sweet things, but not this. I think in order to enjoy this recipe you have to remember 2 things. 1-this in no way is reminiscent of ham and beans & 2-if you make this you better like pork and beans. Sadly I doubled recipe so it was a waste of time and ingredients.

I made this as the main course rather than a side dish. It was hearty and filling served with bread or biscuits. I followed the recipe as shown and it was very good and easy. When I make this again, however, I will reduce the amount of brown sugar because it was too sweet for me. For my taste, I might even skip the sugar altogether or maybe substitute molasses, and throw in a half cup of cut green beans just for color and crunch. Otherwise, a great recipe!

It was a simple but good recipe.  I made it as written.  If I make it again I will cut the amount of brown sugar.  It was a bit to sweet for our preference.   Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe!  I sprinkled some flour over the ground beef   For browning at the end and to thicken the beans up a bit.  I also added a packet of McCormick mesquite grilling packet to the mix.  I didn’t have any bacon, and it was still awesome!

Made this for the Super Bowl; it was the best part of the night. Left out the beef. Sautéed small onion and three garlic cloves.  Used (drained) black, navy and red beans with 2 cans barbecue beans. Add a finely diced, seeded, jalapeño and a diced green pepper. Cooked in a slow cooker on high until they boiled then turepned to low. All other ingredients the same. Excellent.

At least one person makes a version of these at every potluck I've been to. I like to add a pinch of cayenne or chipotle chili powder to mine. Just can't pass up the hint of heat.

I followed the recipe except that I cooked the bacon separate, and changed kidney beans to chili beans.  I couldn't find butter beans, so I also subbed that with great northern beans.  All other ingredients I used in the amount provided, and this was a winner for all in our family.  Served as main dish with side of Trader Joes cornbread.  Next time I will double, as this had just enough for a family of 5 and everyone was wanting to claim the leftovers for their lunch.

I love this recipe, make it all the time when the weather gets cool.  I use northern beans instead of butter beans and the light kidney beans.  Throw everything in my crock pot and let it simmer all day. Eat it as a meal with corn bread and a salad.  Delicious!u

I made it using about half the sugar it called for and it was still very sweet.  If I make it again I will probably leave the sugar out.  I realize that this recipe should be sweet but that isn’t for us.

I have made this a few times, I do a vegetarian version that I really like with veggie burger crumbles,  cannellini beans instead of baked beans and bacon bits (from soy).

In both versions I found that the bacon becomes soggy and I really don't like that, so I either omit or use as a topping when serving to retain the crunch

Just like my Grandma's. Only she used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 TBSP molasses. Not sure that would even make any difference.

This is an excellent recipe. I made it in my slow cooker. I combined all the ingredients in the slow cooker exactly as written, but didn't add any extra salt. I cooked for 3 hours on high.  Perfect results!

First time making this and the children loved it. I did make a change to speed up the making i used already cooked bacon and crumbled it into the meat and onion pan. I found this easy and less grease.

This is wonderful!  This was also my grandma's recipe and probably made for 50 years in my family.  I decrease the sugar a bit and add about 1/2 cup water to thin it slightly.  Always loved by all!

I had this many years ago at a moving party. It was filling and delicious so I'm so happy to have found this recipe! Very versatile as others mentioned.... I used two cans of Pork & Beans, w/one can of kidney and 1/4c Sweet Baby Rays BBQ for extra liquid... YUM! We'll be making again for sure.

Very good. I didn't use all that brown sugar.  The bakes beans themselves are sweet.  I think next time I make them I will add another can of beans.

I made this for a family gathering.  I used lima beans instead of kidney beans and doubled the recipe.  The only thing I would do differently next time is drain some of the liquid off the beans because it was runnier than I like.

I've made this for years. I use ground turkey and once it's mixed together we can't taste a difference. I also use pre-cooked bacon to cut down on prep time. I chop it and toss it in with the ground turkey and there's no difference. This is my oldest son's favorite dish.

I cooked bacon separately and instead of butter beans I used great northern beans. I also added 3 sliced hot dogs. I got so many comments at the 4th of July party. Definitely my favorite recipe for baked beans.

Next time I will cook the bacon until done, it does not render down very well as directed, then sauté' the onion in with the bacon.  I would probably cook the hamburger separately in the bacon drippings after removing the bacon and onion.

No large change but once in awhile I lay strips of provolone cheese over the top and allow it to melt and turn golden brown. Seems to hold moisture in and enhances the flavor just a bit. Most times I make large batches and freeze in advance of a barbecue or seasonal gathering at work. Always a hit.

This is an easy and wonderful bean/beef barbecue for a one dish meal with a salad, or a take-along to a picnic.  I added less brown sugar.  It depends how sweet you like it.   I would think this would taste nice with ground turkey as well.

My family raved about these. Didn't stray from the recipe too much; may have put a little less catsup in.  Will definitely be making these again. Served alongside cheeseburgers made on the Foreman grill. Awesome!!!  Thanks Dee Dee!

Made as directed. Super Flavorful, family loved it. Next time I will drain at least one can of beans. Too much liquid.

I substituted fake ground beef and fake bacon.  the main problem was that it was way too sweet.  If I make it again I will use half the sugar.

My family really enjoyed this dish. I was asked to save the recipe to make it again. 
I made a small modification tho,  I thought I had dry mustard in the pantry, but didn't.  I substituted the dry with a teaspoon and a half of regular yellow mustard.

This recipe is delicious! Although, we substituted baby beans for the butter beans. This could definitely go on a bun-sloppy Joe style.

Very good and easy! I never have dry mustard on hand, so I use 1/2 cup yellow mustard. Other than that I make it the same and it is great to take to a potluck or to have as a main dish.

I made this recipe tonight and enjoyed it very much.  I did make one change; cutting the brown sugar to 1/4 of a cup.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was vey good, and my guests loved it. I would only change one thing, and that would be frying the bacon ahead of time, rather than frying it with the hamburger. It didn't get done mixed in with the ground beef., at least not to my liking. I will make it again.

I've made this several times. It's great as written or with variations. Great dish to bring to a potluck, or to serve on buns as sloppy joes. I drain the beans and often add jalapenos, liquid smoke, a dash of hot sauce, and less or no sugar. If you want to make this without ground beef, just add an extra can of beans.

I used to make something very similar to this as a side dish without the hamburger, but I like the idea of adding hamburger to make this a main dish.  I also reduced the amount of brown sugar.

Haven't tried this particular one yet but its the same ingredients for my Big Boy Beef n Beans recipe I've used for years (got from my ex-MIL). Our recipe calls for Liquid Smoke however, which really gives the dish some yummy flavor. Been awhile since I've made it, now I'm craving it lol.

I have been making this recipe for at least 20 yrs.  I do use Hot It. sausage as my favorite but I will divide 1/2 hot & 1/2 sweet It. sausage. Much more flavor over ground beef. Always requested for picnics & large gatherings.

This was a bit too sweet for me. Sugar depending on your sweetness preference.  When I am serving to people who enjoy some heat in their food I often make a jalapeño cornbread or even add some diced jalapeños to the casserole.  All in all this is a nice winter casserole that lends itself to a bit of doctoring to fit your own tastes.

This exact recipe was in a slow cooker cookbook I bought a few years ago and it was called Mrs. Grady's Beans. It has been a staple in my house for years. Real crowd pleaser. I use as a main dish, not a side dish as it is filling.  Sometimes I lighten it up by using turkey bacon (or less real bacon) and less sugar to reduce the calories a little. It's really delicious. It doesn't reheat very well though. If you microwave leftovers it just doesn't taste the same as when you eat it the first time.

Really easy.  I use 1.5 lbs of burger and 0.5 lb of bacon.  If going to transfer to a crock pot after in the oven, double the recipe because it only fills the crock pot 1/2 full.

Good, but really good the second day.  Only changes - added a bit more bacon and fried it first as someone else mentioned.  First day was a bit too soupy but after sitting overnight, is now perfect.  Great find for me as I like to cook on weekends and have things ready to pull from fridge and heat during the busy weekday evenings.  Thanks!

This was pretty good, although for personal preference I think I'd cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup next time.  I did not think there was enough volume to warrant a 9x13 dish, so I used a significantly smaller baking dish.  I felt this could have used a little spice of some sort to offset the sweetness of the dish.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Dee Dee!

I made this dish vegetarian by using Soyrizo only. Also sprinkle some Parmesan cheese on top, and it was really delicious! Baked whole wheat tortilla and put the mixture and wrap it as you eat it, with sauteed spinach on the side.

I thought this was sensational!   It's very hardy and very easy to make.   It's like a chili, without the spicy kick of chili sauce.   Or maybe if you were to take the usual baked bean recipe and kick it up a notch, this is what you'd get.   I did fry the bacon separate to get it crispy.   YUM!

This turned out to be a nice surprise, very tasty. I drained the kidney beans and lima beans and used a can of pork and beans, then followed recipe exactly. Husband loved it and suggested next time I throw in a sliced hot dog with the hamburger. Only change I would make is the next time I will use real bacon bits.

I have tried many different bean recipes and thought I'd give this one a try because my most favorite bean recipe has vinegar in it.  I liked this recipe but am going to give it a four only because I have other favorite ones.  Some interesting changes I made was to use Italian sausage because I didn't have any hamburger. I loved what it added to the dish.  I also only had two slices of bacon on hand. I would do this again because it is quick and easy.

This was fantastic, very hearty!  My 3 year old liked it too. I did cut the brown sugar by half.  It was still a little sweet to me to be a main dish, I'd probably cut the sugar a little more next time.

This was a good recipe, but we'll probably half the sugar amount next time. It was a little too sweet, but maybe because of the ketchup were using?

Delicious!!  I did reduce the brown sugar to 1/2 a cup and it still was just a bit sweet for us.  Either way, we both enjoyed it very much with cornbread. I made this as a meal, but it would be great as a side for a potluck.  This will be a regular in our house! Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty. I couldn't find baked beans with pork so used baked beans with maple syrup and bacon. I cut down the brown sugar to 1/4 cup as other reviewers suggested. I also used Hormel's 50% less fat bacon.

great recepie, just folowed it the best i could, but love bells peppers and onions in mine and bbq sauce. also some garlic, any beans i have work, kidney, baby butter beans, and pinto beans, baking worked better, that crock pot used 3% fat hamburger, drained after cooking, cooked bacon alone until crips, added a little vinegar, dry mustard, 2 tbs of brown, do not like my beans tasting like a sweet desert w/meat

This sounds so much like my Grandma made in the 1950's but she added drained lima beans and drained the kidney and butter beans. The baked beans was added.  I put it in the crock pot the morning of our cook outs and that leaves me plenty of time to prepare for the guest.

Excellent recipe!  I did make a couple of changes, simply because of what I thought I had in the pantry compared to what I actually had.  Instead of pork/beans and butter beans I used a large can of baked beans.  Because of the sauce already on the baked beans, I didn't use as much ketchup.  I took another reviewer's advice and served it over cornbread.  My husband, 3 year old daughter, and myself loved it!  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!  Next time I plan on trying it in the crockpot for a few hours.

This is my family's favorite baked bean dish. I always triple the recipe for picnics, and I never have leftovers. It is much better to bake in the oven, and also drain the beans, and then you can keep it in the crockpot to keep it warm. Found this in a church cookbook.

Love this recipe and I am not usually a fan of beans! But this comes out a little sweeter with the brown sugar and types of beans. I didn't change a thing but I did double it and put it in the crock pot for a post football game celebration and there was none left...it was a huge hit. The first time I tried it was at a baseball party...it was used as a topping on hotdogs and hamburgers and the baseball dads loved it that way too!

We have been making this recipe in our family for years. It is always very popular and goes quickly. All the beans, bacon and meat make something different then just plain baked beans.

I made this for dinner tonight & we loved it! I left out the butter beans & used pork n beans instead of baked beans. And a little less brown sugar as my hubby doesn't like food that's very sweet, unless it's dessert...LOL. I will be making this again for sure!

I thought it tasted like baked beans out of a can.  The kids wouldn't eat it. My husband (who hates beans) thought that it was really good...  So, I'll give it his rating.

I sliced and added a pkg. of pre-cooked roast beef.  We also like diced celery cooked with the onion.  It was a hit at a dinner I hosted.  My husband requested that be the entree as it's one of his favorites.

This is a good basic recipe for an easy dish to take to a pot luck dinner.  Just pour it into a crock pot to keep warm and it travels well.  I cut the amount of sugar in 1/2 and always add a can of drained, cut green beans.  Think you can use almost any combination of beans you have on hand and it is still good.

I uesd two lbs. of ground beef along with a can of rotel tomatoes for some added kick. I used 1\2 cup of brown sugar and used navy beans instead of the butter beans. Turned out to be tasty and better yet was quick to make. Fed all seven of us easily with some left over  for lunch the next day. Serve it with a green salad and cresent rolls or corn bread and you have a quick feast.

Our family loved this recipe.  I had some extra variety ofdried beans, which I soaked overnight, and added them to the recipe as well.  Serve with some homemade hearty whole wheat bread and you have a delicious wholesome meal.

Outstanding.  A nice change from standard baked beans.
