Here's the deal.  Use great ingredients to get a great drink.  I used Absolut Vanilla, Kahlua Mocha and WHITE Creme de Cacao.  After shaking, I splashed with 2% milk.  I served this to about 30 women and almost all of them loved it.  It is sweet, but so is Tiramisu.

This recipe was pretty good as is, but if you add 3 jiggars/shot glasses full of half and half it gives it the creamy flavor you're looking for. As other reviews have said.....be careful! They are very addicting!!

I don't think this was either a chocolate martini or a tiramisu martini. Unless you like something very sweet and heavy this is not something you would want to have before dinner, in spite of the fact I cut back on the creme de cacao in the hope it would be less sweet.  That being said, this makes a very good after dinner treat which nicely mixes the flavors of vanilla, cocoa and coffee together. Tiramisu martini implies this would be creamy, which it is not. More in keeping with its name, then, I garnished it with whipped cream but more would have been even better.

Very syrup-y. Little on the sweet side. I added a little half-n-half to cut down on the sweetness a bit.

Nice smooth drink, I agree with the others who rated this, you need to add a bit of milk or half n half to get that creamy flavor.  I'll be making this again!

My favorite part about a tiramisu is the creaminess- this drink lacked that.

Pretty good, but I think it would be better with less vodka and a splash of cream.

This was just o.k. for me. It is missing something. I think a splash of creaminess would help.

This is delicious!  Like others I used a splash of fat free half and half and white creme de cacao.  Shake and pour into glass.  Added a sprinkle of cinnamon on top!  Will definitely make more!

Not really tiramisu flavor to me......Try 1 ounce cold coffee or espresso, 1.5 ounce Van Gogh double espresso vodka ( you can use vanilla vodka, but ), half ounce of Godiva white chocolate liquor( or creme de cocoa, white ), and a splash of heavy cream, build in shaker over ice, shake well, pour into martini glass and dust the top with cocoa powder. That's how we do it at the restaurant I work for.
