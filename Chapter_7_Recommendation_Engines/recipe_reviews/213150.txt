This was very easy to make. I didn't have chive and onion cream cheese so I added a tablespoon of chopped chives and a teaspoon of onion powder. I also used reduced fat cream cheese. Using the pastry blender is key for a fluffier biscuit. I mixed these up according to the directions, only I carefully patted the recipe into a circle and cut them into triangles, like I would scones. I thought the cream cheese in this recipe really set these biscuits apart from others, it gave it a really unique flavor and they were delicious. This was one recipe in a full Take-Out Fake-Out meal when we couldn't afford a local take out chicken resteraunt.

Very nice recipe. Left the cream cheese part out. I made them to go with a chicken stew, and it was a perfect combo.

These biscuits are so simple to make and the results are very good!  I followed the recipe except I did not use the cream cheese.  They are a lot like the cheddar biscuits from a major seafood restaurant (RL).

I was surprised by how hard it was to find a scratch biscuit recipe on this site!! Finally I came across this one and they are perfect! I used margarine, which worked fine as well as put extra cheese on the tops, and skipped the cream cheese. Only problem is the batch is quite small. Would likely double it if we had guests.

Simple and Delicious!  This the best cheddar biscuit recipe I have tried. I was glad to find that it really was only 10 minutes of prep for this recipe and with a quick cook time, I added them to a meal at the last minute. I am looking forward to trying out the suggested alternatives in the footnotes.
Editing to add-  I adjusted the flour by doing half and half white and whole wheat.  It was just as good or even better.  I just love this recipe!

This was an awesome recipe, my 2 year gobbled up a couple as soon as they came out of the oven. My husband loved them and I had to double up the batch

very very very good biscuits! I personally left out the cream cheese as i wasn't quite sure how that would taste. Clearly not a risk taker! But even without the cream cheese they were wonderful, i would definitely make again!!

These are very easy and make a nice small batch.  I would suggest adding some extra cheese to amp up the flavour. I also omit the cream cheese and spread a little bit of butter on the warm buscuits.  Make these tonight!

I wish I could give it more stars.  This recipe is now among my most beloved ones.  It is good enough for company but yet quick enough for a mid week diinner.  The biscuit is flaky and has the perfect blend of cheese and dough.  I doubled the recipe with no problems.  When cutting them into squares I divided the dough in half and followed the instructions provided.  The only thing I had to change was that I didnt have butter handy so had to use shortening.  Can't wait to try it with butter.  Either way is fantastic.  I am going to make them a little bigger next time for mini biscuit sandwiches.  Thanks for such an amazing recipe!

Excellent and easy to prepare, a nice way to add an extra touch. I added chives and garlic to the dough, patted it out a bit flatter into 8 inch square and cut it into rectangles 1 inch by about 2 inch.

I was planning to freeze these, but sampled one right out of the oven and it was all I could do not to eat them all. Very cheesy, very soft and fluffy. Didn't fool with the cream cheese; a pat of butter was all it needed. Will have to double it next time; nine of these aren't nearly enough.

I love these biscuits!  They are so easy and so delicious!  

I double the cheese and add some Old Bay Seasoning and they taste exactly like Cheddar Bay Biscuits!

Made exactly as written, except used old cheddar since that is what I had.  Delicious!!  Perfect crispy in the outside, flaky and soft in the inside biscuits.

Yummy. I doubled the recipe... but with four men and a guest in the house, I would quadruple it next time. Didn't bother with the cream cheese topping. Tasted delicious. Can't believe how many recipes I had to go through to find this one, one without "biscuit mix". What's the point of a recipe site if you  use "mix"?? Great recipe. A keeper.

Easy to make even for someone who doesn't know how to knead....me! Made a few mods to make it more chedder bay like. A little garlic powder and some old bay seasoning. Made it onto a circle to cut as i didn't have a cutter for biscuits on hand. Check cooking before time is up add mine were a tich browned on the bottom. Rave reviews but will make a double batch next time as i got 8 wedges from this and they weren't big. Thanks for the recipe!!!

These were DELICIOUS!  Followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect.  Did not need the cream cheese at all.  Definitely double it - my husband and I ate almost the whole batch!

This was so easy and yet slightly more complex tan the typical baking powder biscuits. My children and husband and I loved the light, flaky texture  and delicious flavor!   Thanks for a great recipe I'll use over and over!

Super easy and very tasty.  More of a batter than a dough, so don't panic when it doesn't look like bread dough.  You spoon it into the muffin tins.  Don't try to roll it or form it in any way.  Excellent recipe.

Sooo easy to make on a whim! I doubled the batch and mine weren't dry at all, very moist(over kneading will make them dry). They came out light, airy, flavorful but could use some garlic of some kind next round. I topped with some shredded cheese after they came out of the oven, but no one bothered to put the cream cheese spread on them at all. They were satisfying just as they were.

My family loves these biscuits.  I add a teaspoon of garlic to the dry ingredients as well as dill herb.  I also use the Kraft TexMex or Habanero cheese instead of the Cheddar.  Very, very easy and delicious.
