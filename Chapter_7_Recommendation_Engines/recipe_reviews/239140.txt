These are absolutely delicious!  I think there must be a trick to keeping the coating on the butter though.  We kind of had to scoop it up with a spoon and squeeze it back around the partially melted butter pats.  Good luck!

I went light on the eggs and ended up needing to add an extra 1/4 cup of flour to make the batter less runny. Even still it was very hard to get it to completely coat the butter, which melted out of any holes in the batter. My hollow batter-spheres tasted great though!
