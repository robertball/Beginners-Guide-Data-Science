I tried it and I like it. I used half and half instead of whole milk and I spiced it with a very few drops of Paula Deen's Hot Wing Sauce. I like celery and so added a bit, chopped up, at the end to give it a little crunch. Delicious meal.

I made this chowder and it was such a hit with my guests that I am making it again this week for a new round of dinner guests.  Just serve it with crusty bread and salad and it makes a great meal!

Made it with canned corn and regular white potatoes, and I also added a little heavy cream. Turned out great. Had it for lunch with some nice crusty Italian bread - perfect for a chilly Fall day. Thanks!

My DH and our friends gave it an A+. I didn't use fresh corn on the cob, but used 1/2 bag of "birds-eye"frozen petite white corn, and I had to improvise on the Old Bay's Seasoning. I pretty much knew  what spices to put together,  so I'm confident it was pretty close to what it would have tasted with the "Old Bay". I will be making this again. Thanks for a great easy recipe.

Loved it!  But did also thinly  slice and sauté a half of a large fennel bulb along with the onion to round it out. The Old Bay really gives it just the right amount of kick. It has become a family favorite!

Although the flavor was terrific, we like our chowder a bit thicker, so I will probably make a roux next time. I did not have any white potatoes, so I used sweet potatoes and it turned out great.  Also - I set aside the bacon until I was ready to serve the chowder, crisped it for a few secs in the microwave, crumbled it, and used it as a garnish on top. Excellent recipe!

This is my first attempt at a fish chowder and I'm very pleased.  I didn't have any cod so I used a combo of salmon and scallops.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried parsley and added it with the Old Bay.  Also, I didn't add any salt since I used bouillon & water instead of canned broth and it was plenty salty.  This is excellent--very hearty and filling.  I will definitely make this again.

There isn't much you can do to wreck this recipe.  Just take your time.  If you want, add some shrimp, chopped sun dried tomatoes, and turmeric or curry or both for a little more color to the broth.

Love this chowder! Made several times last winter while the wife and I fought off a cold. 2nd time we increased Cod and decreased redskin potatoes. 3rd time we went 3 lbs. Cod and one potato - our favorite version. Key too is making sure bacon's crispy, this minimizes it from re-hydrating.  So  good!!!

Absolutely delicious! Big hit. I added 1 cup of cornmeal with the potatoes to give it a nice thickness.

We will definitely make this again. We had fresh trout that we used in lieu of cod and it was so delectable that we almost finished the pot. Just before serving we checked our traps and added fresh blue crabs (we live in FLA.) This made it even more decadent. It is not too rich... just right for a satisfying and totally spectacular meal.  If you invite company you had better double the recipe because it is bowl licking good!

My husband and I loved this!!  I made my own "Old Bay  Seasoning" and I think it was saltier than expected, so I will  be careful with that next time. It is a great way to get people to eat fish when they usually don't like it!  My husband said I can make this again anytime.

This was terrific and I don't say that lightly- I grew up on Cape Cod. I used half and half. I didn't have any parsley so left it out without substitute. Used canned corn for convenience. This is better than anything I've had in a restaurant.Thanks for posting it.

Made this for supper tonight and the only change I made was using celery tops because I had no parsley.  Served with garlic bread  this recipe is great.  My husband loved it and suggested mushrooms and celery. This is a versatile recipe and easy to make

this soup turned out  amazing. I  only had 1%milk so I added 2 tbsp of cream cheese with the butter. Instead of cod I used walleye and added chopped shrimp, baby scallops, and a can of crab meat.
