I used Lipton onion soup mix instead of condensed.  With 3 cups of water with the soup mix we had oodles of gravy.  Quick and easy dish that tastes excellent.  Family says "keeper".

This recipe is great if fixed in the crockpot.Some people complained that it was dry. I put the cut up steak in the crockpot and mixed the 2 soups and water and poured it over the meat.About an hr before serving I mixed 3T. of flour with ice water and whisked it in. The entire cooking time was 7 hrs on high adding flour mixture at the 6th hr. It was tender and the gravy was fabulous!!!!!

I make this recipe ALOT! This is the only reason I buy round steak. I sometimes add two can of the french onio soup, instead of a can of water, just to have more flavor, and tenderness. Thanks so much!!!

This was delish!! I slightly altered recipe as others suggested and used a pkg of Lipton onion soup mix (instead of can French onion) as I keep that on hand. Also used 1 can beef broth instead of water, and put in crock pot for 2 hrs on high and 4 hrs on low. Meat was tender!!! Did not need to add flour or cornstarch because gravy was a good consistency as is. Also added a few dashes of black and red pepper, garlic powder, and Creole seasoning, so would not be bland. Served with rice and stemmed broccoli.

I made a 1-3/4# thin round steak in my crock pot.I salt-peppered the steak and lightly dusted both side with Garlic Powder. I threw the steak in a pan with a little oil on the bottom and cooked it on both sides for about1-2 minutes on high heat just to quick brown it. Then I put it in the crock pot and added the 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of French Onion soup but did NOT add the can of water. I cut up a few slices of onion and spread them over the top. Cooked on high for 2 hours and 2 hours on low.  Then I put the gravey in a pan over medium high heat and sprinkled in a couple of tablespoons of flour to thicken. Awesome taste and meat fork tender.There is no way your meat can be dry or tough. This is fool proof. I made mashed potatos and put gravey over it too! If your meat is thicker and the top of it is exposed you might consider adding the water to it, but if it is thinner leave the water out. A much richer taste.  Either way you will probably want to thicken it up by whisking some flour into the gravey. Enjoy!

GREAT!  This is true comfort food...and it is ridiculously easy to make!  All I had was regular steaks (not round) so I wasn't too sure how it would turn out, but it was just incredible!  I seasoned the steaks with pepper and garlic salt and then browned them in a little olive oil in a skillet.  Instead of cooking the steaks in the oven, I just simmered everything on the stove, covered, for an hour.  My steaks were not dry at all...so flavorful!!  I only had 2 steaks, so I used 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup, and 1 whole can of the french onion (no water), and added in a 4 oz can of sliced mushrooms.  I also added a bit of flour to the gravy at then end to thicken it up.  I mixed up some instant potatoes, microwaved some frozen veggies and had an incredibly easy, GOOD, and well-balanced meal.. .and the best part, I only put in about 5 minutes of active work.  I will definitley make this again and again when I'm looking for a good home cooked meal, but don't want to cook!!

This was good. I used the slow cooker and the meat cooked over 8 hours. 
I only had a pound of round steak, I used cr. of mushroom and then Lipton Onion soup mix plus 2 cups of water. I also added about 1/2 cup of mushrooms. About 30 min before serving, I stirred in 3 tbl of flour dissolved in water. Served over mashed potatoes. This gravy was very flavorful and this seems to be a very budget wise meal. The gravy will be reused to serve over biscuits on the weekend. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is a delicious recipe.  I used dry onion soup mix and added two soup cans of water, instead of a can of French Onion soup. It's less expensive and the flavor is wonderful.

I made this in the skillet. I cut the steak into small chunks and seared as directed. I then removed the steak and added the two soups and the can of water. I brought it to a boil and then returned the steak to the skillet. I simmered for about an hour and 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. In the last 20 minutes I added a tablespoon of flour dissolved in 1/2 cup water. This thickened the gravy perfectly! Great recipe! Will make this again.

Kids & family loved it. Easy! I subbed dry onion soup mix with 1/2 can of milk for the french onion soup. I didn't even sear the meat. I don't think you can tell.

yum!! i cooked this in a deep old time cast iron skillet. i seared it without oil on both sides with garlic, pepper, and seasoned salt, then added the soups, water, then added chopped onion, scallions, and threw in some sliced portobellas. baked it at 375 for 1.5 hrs with cast iron lid on and wow! great dish! it reminded me kinda of beef tips without all the flour and cornstarch and that other carb stuff! great dish! i will make again! oh, but i do suggest trimming all the fat as suggested by recipe. i made mistake of biting into a piece with some fat on it and it was not pleasant at all! lol! great dish otherwise!

I'm not sure if it was something I did wrong, but my meat was very dry and the gravy dried up as well.  The flavor that was left was very good though.  I think I may try it again, it had to be faulty... maybe shorten the cooking time.

This recipe is great.  I have an iron kettle so prepared the entire recipe as follows:  I seasoned each piece of steak with salt and pepper, lightly dusted with flour and browned in a small amount of olive oil with 1 clove of minced garlic. I put a layer of sliced onions on top of the meat. I mixed a can of Campbell's Cream of Celery soup (that's what I had on hand) and a can of Campbell's French Onion Soup and a full can of water (rinsed the cans with this water) and poured over the browned meat.  Put the lid on and baked in a 325 degree oven for 2 1/2 hours as instructed.  This came out tender, delicious and supplied plenty of just-thick-enough gravy for our mashed potatoes.  I think searing the meat locks in the juices of the meat and that's the way my mother taught me to do with any roast, steak etc.  I do not understand how any of the steak could be dry or tough if the liquid completely covers the meat during the cooking process.  I was also taught to cover any meat (with foil or a lid) while it's cooking.  However, those inexperienced cooks may not be aware of these helpful hints so it's always a good idea to read the comments when preparing a new recipe.  I don't think there'd be any problem putting this in a crockpot.  Little preparation time is needed and the results are delicious.

Very good, based on other reviews I made the following changes -- I sprinkled each steak with garlic powder and fresh ground pepper, cut the steak into cubes and browned it in a frying pan -- added the cream of mushroom soup, lipton french onion soup mix and beef broth to that and added a mushroom medley to the pan and poured it all into a covered casserole dish and baked as directed. The only thing I would do differently next time is to add some onions to the steak as it browned and add those to the mix as well.

Man pleasing, tasty comfort food with no effort at all. I skipped the searing and just placed the steak in teh baking dish and poured the soup/water mix over the top, covered with aluminum foil and baked this for 2.5 hours. This turned out steak so tender it fell apart during serving and this got raves from my husband. I served this over rice but it would just as well with pasta, potatoes, or biscuits.

A little salty, but good.  I dredged the tenderized round steak in a little flour, salt & pepper before searing.  I used a can of mushroom soup, 1 envelope Lipton soup mix and 3 c. water (since I didn't have any french onion soup).  Just the right amount of gravy.  My 6 year old loved it!

I am not a "recipe rater", but this recipe was so good, I couldn't NOT rate it.  I followed the recipe AS IS with only one addition, as suggested by another reviewer.  I added 3T of flour dissolved in about 1/3 cup water 45 minutes to an hour before serving and the whole thing came out amazing!

This was very simple to make and very tasty and flavorful.  I did follow others suggestion and used 1 package of the dry onion soup mix instead of the can that was called for.  After dipping the round steak in flour and browning it in a dutch oven, I mixed the can of cream of mushroom soup the dry onion soup mix and two cans of water and poured it over the round steak.  I added 1 beef bullion cube and baked at 350 degrees for two hours.  The round steak was tender and I had to add nothing to the gravy.  It was the perfect consistency.  I will certainly make this again.

Wow, this was wonderful.  I didn't have any french onion soup so I sliced up one medium onion and carmelized it, added some salt and then added 1.5 cups of water instead.  I only cooked it for 2 hours because I ran out of time but it was so tender and flavorful.  I will make this again.

This recipe is awesome, soo easy and so delicious! I did make a few changes. I cut the beef into very small pieces, seasoned with pepper, onion and garlic powder. I then seared it in a pan with some diced garlic and a bit of olive oil, I also added a small can of sliced mushrooms. Then I baked for 1 hour and 20 minutes. I thickened the gravy with a bit of cornstarch and served with cheese mashed potatoes and corn. It was super easy on prep time and it was delicious. My husband and I had a friend helping us paint and he said we should open a restaurant!!! So, it was definitely a hit with him!!! Thanks, Nancy for a great recipe!

I was wondering how you can cook a piece of round steak.  I used the crock pot suggestion and it worked out great.  I have done this before with a chuck roast with the same great results.  

I did not use the french onion soup since I didn't have any, but will put it on my shopping list.  I think that it will have a nicer, more subtle onion flavor than the dry soup mix I used.  

Because I used the dry soup mix, I did add 3/4 can water.

I always dredge my meat in flour and brown it before putting it in the crock pot.  Otherwise, I find it kind of boils the meat and it can be more rubbery than tender-juicy-fall-apart meat.

I would suggest adding some garlic for those who like it, too!!

THIS RECIPE IS VERY SIMILIAR TO ONE I HAVE HAD FOR YEARS CALLED "PORK STEAK DINNER IN A DISH". TRY ADDING PEELED QUARTERED POTATOES, SLICED CAROTS AND A CAN OF PEAS. YOU'LL HAVE A COMPLETE MEAL.

I make this a lot and enjoy it.  However, I do prefer a couple of changes-  I use Golden Mushroom soup, and I add sliced onions and mushrooms on the top of the steak before adding the soup and water.  I like this flavor better.  But this is a good, simple recipe.

I'm writing this down now so I don't forget what I did (grin) - if it tastes as good as I'm sure it will, it'll have saved me from making any mistakes in the future.  Only had 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix, so (after dredging and frying up meat) sauted 1/2 an onion.  In meantime, rehydrated dried porchini mushrooms in boiling water.  Added them and liquid (little over a cup) to sauted onion and cream of mushroom soup. Returned seared meat back to pan, covered, and they're all happily singling along at a simmer on my stovetop. UPDATE:  The sauce/gravy was fantastic.  The meat, while tender, was horrid .  Not changing rating as I'm sure it was because I used tenderized round steak.  Don't recommend dredging in flour either as it gave a mealy taste to meat.    Next time just use regular round steak.

Really good and so easy.  Used golden mushroom soup, half can of milk, 1 package of lipton soup mix and a cup of water.  Good, but a little salty, may only use 1/2 a packet of soup mix.

I have made this for years...just in the crockpot, mix the soups and pour over the meat in the morning and cook on low 6-8 hours.  It makes it's own gravy.  EASY!!!

We raise our own beef and have them custom processed.  We always have the round tenderized, even so this lean cut can still be tough.  This looked good and it turned out wonderful and super tender!!  I did turn the meat halfway through cooking and it was done in 2 hrs.  The family says it's a new favorite, I agree!

My hubby and I thought this was pretty good.  When preparing this dish, I did substitute a can of Campbell's Roasted Garlic and Mushroom Soup, for the cream of mushroom soup. I think it helped to add some flavor to the gravy. I took blondie1's advice, and before searing the steak, I seasoned both sides of the steak with McCormick's Grill Mates Montreal Steak Seasoning, and also with some garlic powder, then I proceeded to dredge both sides of the steak in flour. The flour also helped to thicken up the gravy a bit, so ne need to thicken the gravy before serving. (To also thicken up the gravy a bit, I think you could just add half a soup can of water.) The directions didn't specify to bake this covered or uncovered. I baked ours (covered), and exactly for 2-1/2 hours in the oven. Someday I would like to cook this in a crock-pot. I bet that would taste good cooked that way too!

I used the flip steaks and the soups and 1 cup water.  I also dredged the steaks in flour before I browned them.  It came out perfectly.  I cooked for an hour and had to add a little water towards the last 15 minutes.  The gravy was thick and tasty.

My family loves this recipes.  My picky teenage daughter gets totally excited when she comes home from school and smells this cooking in the crockpot.  I however, use an cream of soup that I have on hand - 2 cans different kinds; any Lipton soup mix, and 1/4 can of water only.  Everytime there is a slight different taste, but always good.  I have used cream of onion, cerlery, mushroom, garlic mushroom, lipton beefy mushroom, onion - all turns out good.

Using what was on hand, I combined the small can of French onion soup with a large can of cream of mushroom, plus a big dash of garlic powder for my family's taste.  I cooked it on high for 2 hours and then low for another 3. The meat was perfect. I made a gravy out of what was left and its flavor was fantastic. This was a big hit and I'll make it again.

This recipe is excellent and easy to prepare. I made it in the crockpot. I cooked it on low for seven hours. Used the advise of previous reviews: used additional seasonings, and substituted beef broth for the water. The meat fell apart when touched with a fork which is hard to imagine with round steak!

Tasty and easy recipe! I followed the recipe except added some crushed garlic to the soup mixture. I cooked it in a large-ish roasting pan which, because of the size made a thin layer of soup, it cooked the liquid off so the gravy was super thick. I may actually add more water next time for a thinner gravy.   Only 4 stars because it was a little salty for me (and I generally love salty stuff), and the meat was a little dry and overcooked after 1.5 hours. My meat said 'tenderized' on the package so perhaps that's why. Next time I'll cook 1 hour or less.

I really enjoyed this and so easy to make. I did make a few changes. I used a can of beef broth and the dried french onion soup with water. I also thickened it up just a bit by adding some flour and milk at the end of the cook time.

This was absolutely delicious!!  I used the cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic soup and onion soup mix with 2 cups of water, pepper, mushrooms and an hour before it was done I added some flour - the steak was so tender we didn't even need to use a knife!  My family LOVED it!  I served it over egg noodles...I will definitely be passing this recipe on to my friends!

Sherri (who posted on 3/3/03), you absolutely MUST let the round steak cook for the entire 2 1/2 hours or your meat will be tough and dry.

I have made this a few times. The first time I followed the "instructions". After reading the reviews I decided to cook it in the slow cooker. I use Lipton onion soup mix, cream of mushroom with garlic soup, 2 soup cans of water plus some mushrooms (either can or fresh) and some chopped onion. If I'm home cook on high for 2 hours + low for 2 hrs or just on low for 8 hrs if I'm not home. Plenty of gravy to put over the steak and potatoes/noodles. Super easy and my family likes it.

What a terrific flavor this has!!!  This is almost dead on the same way my Mom &I used to make "Swiss Steak" although most folks make that with a tomato base.  

I use a thin cut of " round", but I have the butcher run it through the tenderizer.  If he can't, I tenderize it myself.  Then, I flour & spice it, before I sear it.  The flour helps to thicken the gravy, & searing it brings out the " cooked meat " flavor.  Deglaze the pan, & pour that in too.  Then, I add the soup & water, & one package of Lipton  (Registered Trademark) onion soup & continue with Capco's directions.  

Thank you Capco for sharing this recipe.  So nice to see this recipe already printed, because it was a favorite of my family, & I'm working on a "Family Favorites" cookbook, so my girls will have them in one place instead of loose in this cookbook or that.

HTH!!!

This recipe was sooo good my 3 boys loved this. I changed it up abit an used 2 each of cream of mushroom soup with garlic and condensed French onion. I seasoned the round steak with monterey steak seasoning and garlic powder dipped the meat in flour and browned the meat in olive oil. There was a lot of gravy that I served over mashed potatoes. Excellent recipe. Thanks Annie

Would have liked to see the gravy thicker and like a gravy, but it was pretty good otherwise. I sliced the meat into thin strips and put in the slow cooker. Smelled heavenly throughout the day. Served with side of rice (which is why I wanted a thicker gravy) and broccoli.

Loved this gravy.  Added garlic powder, onion powder, black and red pepper to one can of cream of mushroom soup, a packet of onion soup mix, about a can of water and a touch of milk.  Toward the end I did add a couple tablespoons of flour mixed with a bit of water due to wanting a thicker gravy.  Will be using for other cuts of meat as well.  Thanks!

I made this in my Nesco slow cooker and it was outstanding.  My husband is very picky and he absolutely raved about it.  I added a can of sliced mushrooms, and had to use cream of mushroom and cream of celery because thats all I had, still great.  Ive made again following the recipe exact and it is wonderful both ways.  I cooked in the roaster on low for 7 hours......cant wait to make again.......

My goodness this was excellent.  I also altered a bit using a pkg of the Lipton onion/mushroom soup mix, 1 can of mushroom soup and 2 cups of water.  Braised the steaks quickly and added the flour at the end for thickness.  The family loved it.  Will make this over and over again.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion, searing the round steak pieces in a cast iron skillet & then cooking them in the crock pot for about 6-7 hours on high.  I used about half a soup can of white wine to deglaze the skillet & then added that to the crock pot along with the two soups.  Since I added the wine, I decreased the water to about half a soup can.  The meat turned out very tender & the gravy was thick enough without adding flour (but I admit I'm not a fan of thick gravy).  We had it over rice.  I will probably think about ways to add a little more flavor, but as is, it is a good solid meal & perfectly edible.

Definitely a keeper!  I used a thick cut, so cut in large cubes and increased oven time.  I seasoned it, sprinkled a little flour, then seared it in a little oil in a pan. I ended up cooking for about 4 hours in a covered baker - very tender.  Gravy was great!

made this at my in-laws house who unfortuantly know nothing about cooking or proper food storage.  I didnt have a can of french onion soup but i did have a packet of a ju, added 3 tbls spoons of butter and 2 cups of water and heated didnt have fresh onion but found some onion powder I used 6 tbs which should equal about 3 cups of onion (a ju packet called for 3 medium onions so I just guessed) used 1 14.5 oz can of cream of mushroom (my in-laws like giant cans of things) other wise I followed the recipe exactly.  I will defiently try it the real way next time. I did find it helpful that you can make a quick french onion soup with just a ju, butter, and onion in case of cooking emergency.

I loved the recipe. I did alter it. I seasoned it with steak seasoning, tenderized it with a meat mallet, dredged it in flour, I fried my steak in a half of inch of oil for 3 mins on each side. Then pat dry excess oil off. Then placed in casserole dish, I then mixed two cans of mushroom soup and 1 jar of Heinz savory beef gravy in a bowl. Stirred and mixed well, I poured it over the meat in cassorole dish. I cover with foil (couldn't find my casserole top) and baked on 350 for 1 hour. Came out very tender, like country fried steak. Served with rice and used the extra gravy to pour on top of rice. Delicious. Thanks for the mushroom soup & gravy combo. Much easier than gravy from scratch and thicker & richer than gravy in a jar.

Very good basic recipe.  I had this in the oven in literally ten minutes.  It came out flavorful and tender.  I would make this again.  There were no leftovers.

Wow, this was delicious. We used the "healthy request" cream of mushroom soup and you couldn't even tell the difference! We also added 1/2 teaspoon each of black pepper and garlic, cooked in the crock pot on low for 8 hours-ish. It was SO easy and warm and tasty! Will definitely make again.

Only complaint I heard was there wasn't enough so next time I'll double the recipe.  (There were 4 men and 2 ladies and everyone would've liked more.)  Served with mashed potatoes, fresh green beans and rolls.  Yummy!

very good and tender. I used half a bag of lipton onion soup mix and stirred together with a can of mushroom soup and 2 1/2 cups water. Cut up the meat and pour over. I used the crockpot and put on high for 7hrs. of total cooking time. Checked at 6hrs. and noticed the gravy a bit runny. Mixed 3T. flour with ice water and mixed in- it thickened right up. Great recipe!

Mmmm.  Made as directed except used more meat than called for.  Will probably add a little more water next time as we love our gravy!! Very tender and good way to fix an ordinarily mediocre cut of meat.

Very good.  I didn't have French onion soup so I used dry onion soup and beef broth.  I also cooked it in the crock pot.  It was a little salty, but I'm guessing that was due to the dry soup mix.  I will try the recipe exactly as written next time.

Been making a recipe similar to this for years. I like to add sliced bell pepper, onion, and mushrooms when I prepare it. I also throw in a fair amount of black pepper.

Mine turned out good.  I would strongly suggest putting the gavy in the pan first and making like triple the amount of gravy.  Good flavor, the house smelled great.  I add onion soup mix also.

Very good and easy dinner.  I seasoned the steak with pepper, garlic and onion powder.  Also, I used lipton onion soup mix instead of condensed but did not increase the water.  The gravey was thick (like we enjoy) and tasted great but I think next time I will double.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  I made to sure to bake for the entire 2 and a half hours.

I didn't have onion soup so used 2 cups of water + onion and mushroom dry soup mix along with a can of the cream of mushroom soup.  I also used garlic, chopped onions, and green pepper when browning the meat.  I covered the roaster with foil and then put the lid on to seal in juices.  This was a great fall-off-the-fork meal.  I served with mashed potatoes --- to take advantage of the delicious gravy.  I didn't have quite as much gravy as I expected, will add more water next time.  To compensate, I made gravy with the browned bits in the pan, water from my potatoes, and a little cornstarch. Delicious!

This looked like a great recipe as written...but I did change it a bit in order to make it fit my schedule and ingredients that I had on hand.  I had 2 1/2 lbs round steak and used a packet of lipton onion soup mix instead of the can of onion soup and about 2 cups water and a small can of mushrooms.  Since I was going to be gone most of the day and needed it ready for dinner, I decided to cook it in the crock pot for 2 hours on high and 6 on low.  When I got home the aroma was wonderful!  The meat was fall-apart tender, moist and delicious.  I served it with mashed potatoes and had plenty of the soup mixture to use as gravy. Thanks for a "souper" easy and great tasting recipe!

I also cooked this in the crockpot all day long rather than the oven. I used other raters suggestions and used Mushroom Soup with Roasted Garlic. I really liked this flavor. Not long before serving I added a little corn starch in cold water to make the gravy thicker so we could spoon it on our mashed potatos. I had also added a can of mushroom slices and a little bit of pepper. Overall, a good meal. I suggest that you serve this with some type of bread. I neglected to make any and my husband and I both commented about how if we had some to sop up the gravy, it would have been yummy!!

Really good and pure comfort food! My husband absolutely loves this. I used cubed steaks, reduced fat soup, one envelope of dried onion soup mix, 2 cans of water, added some fresh mushrooms and served with egg noodles. This is a keeper.

I brought 2 1/2 pounds of round steak and didn't know what to do with it  until I saw this recipe. My steaks  were already seasoned overnight. I didn't have all the ingredients. I floured the steaks and brown them in a pan. Took them out and cut up an onion and a couple cloves of garlic,  brown them and added 2 cups of water,  onion cup of soup, beef buillon and  add flour to thicken up the gravy. I put the steaks a crock pot and pour the gravy on top with some mushroom for 6 hours on low. Made some brown rice and green bean. OMGoodness came out  good and tender and the gravy was so tasty. Will be making this again

We loved this.  I also used a packet of dry onion soup mix and a can of beef broth, since I had both of those on hand.  Added some potatoes to the slow cooker, and then all we had to do for dinner was open a can of vegetables.  Thanks for sharing!

It should be covered with foil when you put it in the oven.  That is why some people had it dry out.

This turned out pretty good...I did the 3 cups of water like someone had done but mine was way too much water as it turned out very runny.But it was good other than that water...I will be making it again but will only use the can water like the recipe had called for...

So simple and yummy! No crockpot. I S & P'd the meat, dredged in flour and browned. I then added 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, 2 garlic cloves minced, one chopped onion and of course, some red wine! I let it simmer on very low in the same pan for about 2.5 hours (until the meat broke down and became a part of the gravy. I did end up adding more salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to taste and threw in a pinch of cayenne. Boiled some rice and voila! The entire meal cost $6-$7 at the most and there is plenty. Will definitely make this again!

Delicious. Made in crock pot . Used beef broth instead of water and soups. Meat was falling apart. Kids loved it. Low for 6 hrs. Makes its own gravy, but I did add some flour last hour to thicken up. Made with mashed  potatoes

I'm not one to use condensed soup to cook with, but I had a round roast in the freezer and wanted something easy so I gave it a try.  I sliced the round roast into thin pieces and made it in the crock pot with a dry onion soup mix, a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of water.  It was so easy and turned out really good!  Made lots of gravy.  You almost have to make mashed potatoes to go with!

have cooked this 2x now. Cut off all obvious fat before cooking. Did not cook in oil, just put in raw. Didn't have the right kinds of soup so I used 2 cream of chicken, added 2 beef flavor packs, poured some dried onions in, heaping Teaspoon of minced garlic, and no water.  Used my slow cooker and WOW! Awesome and had tons of great gravy that I didn't have to make or drain fat or anything!

The gravey this recipes makes is very good. It's a little onion strong for us but good.  The meat I did find to be dry, but very tender. I think next time I'll pound flour into the meat and brown it. The flour will thicken the gravy a bit and then continue to use CAPKO recipes and simmer  on top of the stove instead of the oven.  I think the oven dried out the meat.

I started with really nice round steaks, about 1/2" thick. Although the gravy turned out plentiful, easy, and good, the steaks were ruined. Dry, even with gravy. Disappointing. I notice that others cooked it much longer, in a crockpot, and maaaaybe I'll try that when I have time; but I needed it done in a couple hours and was glad to find this recipe, but it just didn't work for the beef.

Tasty AND easy!  A flavorful, simple meal for those cold winter days.  I did add some garlic powder before searing in a bit of oil.  Put the meat in the crockpot and poured the soup (like others, I used dried french onion w/ water because it was what I had on hand). Served over mashed potatoes.  How easy is that? Entire family loved it!  Thanks CAPKO!

Great recipe.  I modified and made a richer type meal.  Instead of French Onion soup, used cream of onion, with 1 can fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and then served the gravy over egg noodles.  It was comfort food at it's best.

My guys were crazy about this. I served it with egg noodles. I made it in the slow cooker, but I will not do that next time.  I took the meat out to thicken the gravy a bit, ended up having to transfer the gravy to another saucepan to accomplish what I wanted, and I ended up getting too many dishes dirty.  Also, I will be a bit more meticulous in removing the fat. But the recipe was excellent and I am told that I must make it again.

I've made this a few times now and I'm never disappointed! This is the only way I will make round steak. It's so tender - hard to get when dealing with this cut of meat, I feel. I use the crock pot and it makes it even easier!

I made this in the crockpot as others have suggested. i ommitted the can of water, since my meat was very thin. cooked on low for about 7 hours. the meat was incredibly tender, and the gravy was incredible. i wanted to serve this over mashed potatoes, but served over no-yolk egg noodles instead. my picky boyfriend has already asked when i was going to make this again.

This recipe was so easy and now one of the family favs at my house.  I didn't have some of the ingredients, so I basically used thin cut steak, seasoned it with garlic salt and pepper.  I then lightly coated the steak in flour, to thicken the gravy.  Browned the meat and flour and added the 1 can of sod. red. french onion soup-progresso.  So delish! U must try it

It was delicious and so easy! I used 1/2 packet of generic onion soup mix because that was what I have, 2 cups water. Saute some mushrooms and quartered up some onions and dump it into a pot to cook/simmer for 2.5 hours. Will be making these again and again!

this was great!! I followed the recipe rather closely, gave it 2 1/2 hours at 325, and it was just fine.  Not filet, not NY stip, but just excellent home-cooked round steak and gravy.  I added about 4 oz of sliced canned mushrooms for the luxury, and served it over mashed potatoes with butter, rosemary and a sprinkle of lemon pepper. For an economical, delicious family supper at home, it's ready!!

This is the BEST and easiest recipe I've found for round steak.  My family loved it.  I didn't sear the meat and I used dry onion soup mix too but didn't add more water.  The gravy wasn't too thick and it didn't dry out.  I used a small glass baking dish so the meat was covered during cooking.

I made this for dinner last night and my family loved it.  My husband said it was a keeper and my 9 year old who is a picky eater said she would rate this recipe a 5.  I had some fresh mushrooms in the refrigerator that I sliced on top that added some more flavor.  I also used lipton onion soup mix instead of french onion soup because that is what I had in the house.  I will be making this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing.

this turned out great...someone gave me some round steak and i didn't know what to do with it so i tried this recipe. i did make it in the crock pot...2 hours on high 4 on low. used beefy onion soup mix, 2 cans water, chopped up onions and garlic as well. thickened with cornstarch at the end. meat was good and tender and there was tons of delicious gravy! oerfect with mashed potatoes. a little on the salty side...definitely doesn't need any extra.

I have made this dish a number of times and my whole family loves it every time.   Instead of canned French Onion Soup I always use the soup mix in all kinds of varieties and use broth instead of water. I do bake it on a higher temp and less time, then add cornstarch in the last 1/2 hour (and water if necessary) to thicken the gravy.

This was an excellent 'stick to your ribs' kind of meal. I used a packet of Golden Onion dry mix instead of the canned onion soup & it worked fine.  Just upped the water to two cans. I mixed 2 TBS of cornstarch with some cold water until smooth & stirred it into the crock pot (I cooked it on low all day) during the last hour or so & it made a perfect gravy - very flavorful. Meat was fork tender after a day in the crock pot & everyone, even the picky 5 y/o, liked it. Thanks!

Perfect recipe as is, but to save time, I used the slow cooker.  This might sound weird, but I also added left over Cheddar Ranch Dip from this site.  I needed to get rid of it, and it turned out really good.

I tried this in the slow cooker and made it for 6 people. It turned out to be the beast I think I have ever had! When I tried to pick the steaks up, the fell apart. So would say be aesy and use a big utensle.

This was really yummy!  Very flavorful!  I cooked it in the crockpot all day and the meat turned out great.  The gravy was a little thin, but we liked it that way.  I've had it for lunch the last several days.  Very good as leftovers.

Great recipe to make an inexpensive cut of meat taste great. I used a packet of onion gravy instead of the onion soup. It made the gravy nice and thick, but was a little salty. The meat was very tender.

Very good! I have had this in my Recipe box
for over a year and thought I should rate it..I, like others, just throw the ingredients in a crockpot and let it cook all day...yummy. I usually throw some mushrooms in the bottom as well.

I used a boneless chuck steak, didn't have round. I sauteed onion and mushrooms, browned the meat, poured the onions and mushrooms over it, then mixed 1 can mushroom soup, 1 packet Lipton Onion soup mix, and 1 can of water.
I also put a buillion cube in with the onions and mushrooms.
 I cooked it in the oven, instead of the crock pot, and I think it was alittle tough for that reason.
 Otherwise, it was awesome-gravy was just thick enough.

This was great with Lipton onion soup mix and water along with the cream of mushroom soup!  Thickening wasn't necessary as the gravy was perfect.  Baked it for two hours which was long enough.  Will definitely do this one again.  Thanks!

I thought this was very good and my husband loved it - thought it was pure comfort food.  Made a few changes but stayed true to the basic recipe.  Had 3 to 4 lbs. of marinating steak so used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 2 pkg's onion soup mix, 2 cans undiluted beef broth and an extra half can of water, 2 cans sliced mushrooms drained, and 3 bell peppers - red/orange/yellow.  When I browned the meat I sprinkled the meat with ground black pepper and garlic poweder - no salt needed because of the onion soup mix.  I then removed the meat and added the broth, water and removed the brown bits from the bottom, then added the mushroom soup, onion soup mix, mushrooms, peppers - mixed well and then returned the meat to the pot.  Then put it in the oven and cooked it for 1 1/2 hours - it was done by then and very tender.  I used a cash iron pot which can go from stove top to oven to freezer and cooks beautifully.

Excellent, fast AND easy!!  Doesn't take much effort to make this taste like fine restaurant cuisne!! 

Good call on using dry French Onion soup mix--worked out well w/out the additional cup of water (didn't need to add any flour).  Go easy on adding salt; you really don't need to.

And try adding a can of your favorite canned mushrooms to the gravy mix.  

You, family and guests are going to LOVE this recipe!!!

Talk about cleaning out the pantry!!  I had no onion soup of any kind and no fresh onions.  So I used 1 pkg of beef gravy mix, 2 beef bouillon pkgs, 3 c water, and a generous amount of onion powder instead.  It turned out great.  As suggested by a previous reviewer, I coated the steaks with pepper, garlic and onion powder, and seared them in olive oil with fresh garlic.  I also added carrots the last hour.  I baked it the whole 2 1/2 hrs and it was very tender, but I think if I'd kept in another 20 minutes it would have been even better.  Gravy was really good!

This was very good and very easy. I had to reduce the cooking time as it looked like the gravy was burning on top of the meat. Still very tender and tasty. I will make this again.

My husband liked this and it was easy to make.  I browned it in a pan then put it in the slow cooker on high for 5-6 hours. I mixed a can of soup, one soup can of water, and one package of onion soup mix together and pured it over the round steak.  It came out very tender and I did not need to do anything to the gravy.

This recipe was very easy and very good. I tweaked it just a little, instead of 1 soup can of water I used 1/2 a can of strong brewed coffee and 1/2 a can of beef broth. I cooked it on high for about two hours turned it to low for about four or five hours. Just before serving, I mixed two Tbsp of coffee, two Tbsp of beef broth and Three Tbsp of flour in a small bowl, added this to the crockpot and turned pot to high for about 10 min. stirring every few min., this thickened the gravy just right. I served this with mashed potatoes and a green salad on the side. My wife said it was the best roast I'd ever made.

I ? this recipe! I have made this at least once a month for the last year! It is so yummy. The sauce makes a wonderful gravy, and I serve with homemade mashed potatoes!

I made this recipe in the crockpot and it was very tender. My husband liked it more than I did, the gravy was good but I didn't think it had enough flavor. I don't know what it needed added but I felt like something. Its a nice recipe to try.

This is a great recipe!  I can never get any meat to come out tender, but I did with this recipe.  Don’t change anything on this one- it is so easy to make and the gravy is delicious.  As someone else has suggested- I do think it is important to cook it the entire time in order for the meat to tenderize.

Tasted great. I followed the exact recipe, except I cut the round steak into strips.  I served it over mashed potatoes. I would make this again, even though my 5 yr old wouldn't eat it. I will try egg noodles next time.

This recipe was okay.  The length of baking time was too long and the steak became a little dry.  I have better recipes that took less time.

This dish had a very nice gravy to serve over mashed potatoes.  I didn't like the round steak, perhaps it was too thick.  I will try this again with blade or maybe short ribs.

Very tender meat, the gravy needed to be thickened and seasoned, though, next time I will coat the meat with seasoned bread crumbs prior to seasoning. Especially good using cream of mushroom soup w/roasted garlic.

This is a very good, simple one-dish use for round steak. I slice the steak into thin strips, add 1/2 pound of fresh sliced mushrooms, and cut the water in half. I then bake it at 350 for 1 1/2 hours so the steak isn't so dry. No complaints from anyone. I've served it over noodles, mashed potatoes, and rice. It's great leftover as a sandwich.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I like others adapted this to my slow cooker.  I seared the steaks in my cast iron skillet, then set them aside.  I added the soups to the skillet to get the drippings incorporated, then dumped it all in a slow cooker.  Like others, I used Lipton's onion soup mix and beef broth to add some flavor.  I cooked it on low for about 7 hrs. and the meat was falling apart tender.  I added a few spices, just because I wanted a little more depth of flavor (cardamom, thyme, basil, and Worchester).   It was delicious!  I'll definitely do this again as I have several round steaks in my freezer and this is a very easy recipe that turns out great.  Thanks!

I 5 starred because of the ease and flavor of this yummy dish. I did pepper the steak before searing, (I just cannot cook any kind of meat without flavoring first. I didn't salt due to Dr.s orders). I also didn't portion the steaks before searing as I wasn't sure who would be staying on board when we go back in. 
Ease of a recipe while sailing is important, especially in rough water.
Also I used the whole can of french onion soup, 18.5 oz. and used the the rest of my leftover chicken broth to make up the rest of the liquid.
Definitely a keeper!
I wonder if CAPKO has other easy recipes?
ENJOY!

I had 3 and a half lbs or round steak and decided to add 3 potatoes, 6 carrots and an onion,  1" pieces. Instead of mushroom soup, I added a 6 oz can of steak and mushroom sauce from kroger and a can of beef broth along with the french onion soup, and 3/4 to 1 cup water . It cooked  on the stove for a couple of hours, be careful if doing this, some stuck to the bottom. So carefully pouring it into the crock pot, not scraping any burnt food, if that happens just the top, cooked it on the auto setting for 4 more hours. Turned out to be the Best Beef Stew I ever made! Steak and mus hroom sauce will be my go to for many recipies from now on.

My expectations weren't too great considering I was using top round.  This recipe was fabulous and made the meat pretty tender.  I used very thin blade cut and we ate on it for several days.  Left overs were just as good as the original meal.  Will be making this one again.  So easy and tasty.

Easy and tasty - a winning combination. I made this AS-IS and am rating it as such. No need to change this at all, in my book. I grew up on swiss steak exactly like this - thanks for the trip down memory lane and I'll be making this again and again.  ** Let 'er rip in the slow cooker, just brown first. Thanks again!

This is probably one of our most favored dishes.  It is so "home cooking" and just awesome!  It is great with mashed potatoes and noodles.  Many people have never had such a wonderful meal in their life, esp. young people today who eat on the run and their hard working parents just didn't have the time.  I sometimes add a dry onion soup mix and adjust with a can of water if I don't have the canned French Onion Soup.  Also, adding mushrooms is great.  Reminds me of a good old fashioned Ky hillbilly dish.

I loved this recipe but I had to  make it my own for tonight's dinner and it was fabulous. To make  more a flavorful gravy I added chicken broth to the ,to the onion soup and cream of mushroom. I also added sliced onions. To get a thicker gravy I dredged the tenderized steaks in little seasoned flour then browned on both sides. I popped it in the oven for a little under 2 hours at 325 the I could  actually cut the steak with a spoon. There was plenty of gravy so no problems with dryness however I did wrap the pan with foil. I will make like this again and again. I usually braise meat like this on the stove to and I started to today until I found this recipe.

It was good, however, the flavor and texture reminded me of a roast rather than steak. I love roast so I was okay with it but it wasn't quite what I was hoping for in a steak

I followed others' suggestions and used onion soup mix, which was great since I always have that on hand. I used a can of beef broth and added just enough water to get the sauce to completely cover the meat. I also added a sliced onion and a good bit of black pepper. The gravy was just the right consistency, and the meat was fork tender. My husband cleaned his plate and gave me a high five, which made me very happy as I am still learning to cook. Thank you for this tasty and super simple recipe!

This recipe is nice and easy, but the cook time is a little too long. Though I didn't let it bake as long as the recipe called for, the round steak hardened. Also, the soup made the gravy a bit too salty. I will make this again, but will tweak the time and gravy ingredients, and will perhaps cover with foil to hold in moisture.

Everyone loved it!  I used what I had on hand to make this recipe with a few changes.  I used round steak, a larger can on mushroom soup, beefy onion soup mix, and a can of beef broth.  I placed all of the ingredients in the slow cooker for 6 hours.  I made egg noodles and peas to go along with this. This will be made again.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The gravy was delicious and the meat was tender.  I started out with a 2 1/2 pound round steak that was about an inch thick.  I cut it into about five pieces.  I brazed  the meat with a light spray of olive oil from my Mysto oil sprayer (great device)  in a non stick oven roaster.  I like others used dry onion soup mix instead of the canned onion soup and the low fat cream of mushroom soup.  I put in a total of 2 1/2 cans from the mushroom soup of water.  It looked a bit watery, but the sauce came out perfect.  Where I changed the recipe is:at about 1/2 hour into cooking, I added three peeled and cut up potatoes, and a couple of handfulls of baby carrots.  I also added some dry shitake mushrooms I had.  The meat came out super tender, and the potatoes and carrots were perfectly done.  The gravy was just great, nice and thick and well seasoned.  Next time I might salt and pepper the meat before searing, and I might add some garlic. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was a great recipe.  I did have to alter simply becauseI didn't have all the ingredients. I used beef boullion, a cut up onion the cream of mushroom soup and it turned out tender and delicious.  I did sneak a couple tablespoons of sour cream in too.  My picky sons loved it!  I made egg noodles for it to go over but I would also make it with mashed potatoes. Thanks for the great recipe!

I heated a skillet on top the stove and browned the meat. I mixed the soup mix and cream of mushroom in a bowl with the water and poured it over the meat in the roaster. I added peeled carrots and potatoes and seasoned the entire pan with parsley and pepper. increased oven heat to 350 and cut 1/2 hour time. YUMMY

This recipe is so good and so easy.  The only thing I can say is that I used the onion soup mix because I didn't have the canned soup and I also added a little salt to the steak.  Don't add salt, the soup provided enough salt, it was too salty.  Otherwise, great, tender steak.  Ate it over rice.  Will definantely make this again.

Very easy -- had enough gravy left over to freeze.  Will definitely make again. Great for a family on a budget.

Very easy and tasty recipe. I used onion soup mix instead of the canned. Also added 10 oz. can of mushrooms.Did have to add some cornstarch to thicken gravy. Served with brown rice. Very hearty dish

The flavor of this dish was exceptional, but mine came out a little dry and tough, and I cooked it only 1.5 hours (would have been leather if I had cooked it any longer).  I think I'll try it in the crock pot next time, as many others did.  My grocery store was out of French onion soup, so I substituted one envelope of onion soup mix plus one can of water - the gravy was just wonderful!!  I served this with homemade mashed potatoes and glazed carrots.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is very easy and the meal is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly with the exceptions that I sauted onions, bell peppers, and garlic and added it to the pot.

Excellent recipe.  Instead of adding water to dilute the soup I added some red wine.  Just added a little extra to a great dinner.

I bought round steak because it was very cheap. My husband said I would'nt be able to do anything with it. I searched for a recipe and tried this because I had all the ingredients. My husband and kids loved it!

This was SUPER good!  The meat was so tender that it kept falling apart.  Even my picky 7 year old son LOVED it!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was okay. I used dry onion soup and a lot more water to make sure the potatoes were covered.  When it was done I added some corn starch to thicken it back up.  My boyfriend loved the recipe!  I thought is just tasted like roast and I roast isn't my favorite meal.  Was very flavorful, though!  Meat was very tender, but dry.

Gravy was good but too thin, so took about 1/2 cup gravy out and whisked in some cornstarch, added cornstarch mixture and rest of gravy to a saucepan to thicken.  Meat was OK but little tough, could have just been the meat.

The steak was really tough. It could have been a problem with the meat or the cook, but I just didn't like this!

It is easy and the taste is pretty good, but the gravy was thin and too much. Some pieces of meat at top dried out a bit. Needs work.

Quick and easy!  Next time I'll season the meat with a bit of onion salt prior to searing but everything else was great!  Our meat was fork tender in an hour and a half and very good.  I did use a thin cut as suggested in the recipe.

Awesome flavor but my steak came out dry...I think this would be perfect done in a slow cooker or else using a more tender type of steak.  I didn't have french onion soup on hand so I used cream of mushroom and golden mushroom.  Great Gravy!

Excellent way to prepare round steak.
Not many ways to serve this without the meat being dry or tough.

Extremely easy and tasty.  I made this using my crock pot per other reviews and will add this to my "standards" list.  I will thicken the gravy next time but other than that...very good!

Enjoyed very much. Cooked in crockpot 10 hours on low. Meat tender and delicious. Added a few sprinkles of dill and ground thyme. Thanks for the recipe.
