This is such a cozy, homestyle dessert.  Perfect with a scoop of ice cream.  I've also made this with blackberries.

YUMMM. This is a fantastic, easy dessert you can make any night of the week. And I did use frozen blueberries and they really worked beautifully - I just made sure to add a little extra cornstarch and simmer until the mixture was fairly thick before topping with the biscuit dough (I also didn't bother with the kitchen towel, my lid has a vent and I didn't have soggy biscuits). I loved this. A warm bowl of this calls for a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Delicious.
