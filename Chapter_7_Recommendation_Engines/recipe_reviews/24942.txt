These were pretty good.  I had a problem because the first time I made them the powdered milk stayed in flakes and it looked like moldy tootsie rolls.  So the next time I crushed them a little finer and it worked much better.

The kids ate it because they made it and it was chocolate, but the flavor and consistency was like soft, generic fudge.  Quick and easy, but not something I'll make again.

Pretty good, although I would say the texture is much closer to fudge; they don't stick to your teeth like Tootsie Rolls! I didn't use up quite all the powdered sugar before the dough got too hard to work with, so I would say go scant on the last cup and add more only if you need to.

I made these candies to put in baskets for the ones with sweet tooths...didn't last the evening before they were ALL gone!

The dough didn't work out for me.  I was watery and sticky.
