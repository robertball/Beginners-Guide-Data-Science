Very good side dish, but excessive amount of green beans for four people.  Prepared the green beans as directed and sauteed the onion and garlic in butter vs margarine.  Helpful Hints:  in place of 1/2 cup of soy sauce, sub 1/2 cup low sodium beef broth to pan and let simmer for the indicated time.  Last 3 minutes of cooking add cornstarch/cold water to thicken and 2 turns of low sodium soy sauce to the pan and continue reducing.  No need to season with the salt as the recipe indicates as the soy sauce replaces it.  For presentation toast sesame seeds and sprinkle on the beans prior to serving.

On a quest to find a recipe which mimicked the local chinese food restaurant's green beans, I chose this look-a-like. Luckily, I didn't read any of the most recent review before making this recipe, as the beans ended up being absolutely delicious. (yes, it's salty but there's a freaking 1/2 cup of soy sauce! That only makes sense!) I didn't have any of the problems that the other cooks experienced, and I did not find the beans to be very "labor intensive". My only complaint is that I halved the recipe (for 2 people), and the cook time ended up being a little too long.  If you like your beans a little crunchy, I recommend cutting back the simmer time. Otherwise, they are a perfect side dish for a weekday or weekend meal.

I modified this a bit just to suit my tastes, and to use the frozen French-style green beans I had on hand.  I cooked the beans till nearly done, and while they were cooking, sauteed the onion in butter, rather than margarine, with some fresh minced garlic. I added a little chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon, which I assumed meant bouillon crystals.  The amount of soy sauce, as directed, seemed excessive, so I just gave it a couple of shots. To this mixture I added the nearly cooked green beans, tossing to coat. Very good!

These are in fact tasty.  I decided to use my best judgement, I subbed Worcestershire sauce for the soy, because I agree with the previous reviewers on the salt issue.  Oh, and I also sliced the onion so that it would be easier for the kids to pick them out.  This made a lot of beans, 1/2 lb. per person is a bit much (tomorrows lunch for me)!  Thanks Carol ;)

I was curious about what the concoction of liquids would taste like, so I mixed in the soy sauce, bouillon and water but found it to be too salty!  I increased the water to about 1/2 to 3/4 cup, added some sugar to give it dimension and then cornstarch (with cold water of course) to thicken the sauce to give it more cling, thereby providing more flavor to the green beans.  With these modifications, it turned out great!

After a couple of tweaks, this will suit my tastes.  Not a cooked bean lover, but it's bean season, I needed something to add variety to my abundant beans.  This recipe fit the bill perfectly!  Taking tips from previous reviewers, I cut the bullion to 2 tsp. but still thought it salty. I'll omit it next time.  I used 3 cloves of crushed garlic but will increase that to at least 4 next time.  I only needed to simmer for 10 minutes so they were still a little crisp.  The whole family enjoyed this and there were no leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe!

My kids loved this recipe.  I've even made it with chicken broth when I was out of beef bouillon, and it's great that way too.

I did enjoy this, but it really takes all the goodness out of the veggie and that's 
the reason why you eat veggies!!  It also had way too much soy sauce and will
remember to cut back on the butter and the soy sauce next time.

I made these tonight to go with a roast and they were very tasty it was a good change from the regular green beans. I did not however have fresh greenbeans so I used a bigger can of caned green beans I drained them well and put then in a sauce pan. I then took some of the other cooks advice and only added half of 1/4 soy sauce. I did not have beef bouillon cubes so I took the beef broth from the roast and added it instead. I did everything else that the recipe called for and it turned out perfect not too salty and just enough flaver. Thank you for sharing this recipe and all the inputs too. :)

The ONLY way to eat green beans!!! The changes I made was I only added 1 TBS butter and I don't boil the beans before hand. I melt my butter and minced garlic and onion then add my frozen green beans, let those cook for a few minutes, then I add the rest. I have made these over and over!!

I've never had better green beans. I went with Worcestershire sauce instead of the soy sauce (way too salty!) and it was Fab-U-luss.

These were good.  I made them just as written, and I think there was too much soy sauce.  I will make them again, but with less soy sauce.  The garlic was a nice touch!

I scaled the recipe in half, used butter instead of margarine, and broth in place of the bouillon/water and this worked great for us.

This has got great flavor and it's not smothered with creamy stuff like most of the other recipes. My husband loved it and he doesn't really care for green beans. I recommend cooking the green beans for only 10-15 minutes, though, because they will get too soggy otherwise.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!
The only changes I made was to use 1/4 cup of low sodium soy sauce and 1/4 cup of worcestershire. 
These turned out great! Tasty and delicious! I will definitely be making this recipe often!

These were totally delicious! But I won't cook them first anymore. They were very overcooked by the end of it. I like 'em crunchy, so even 20 minutes in the broth is longer than necessary. But they were delicious!

I loved the asian flavor on these. My DH prefers the southern style simmered with bacon and onion, so he really didn't care for this dish. I could have eaten double my portion though. Thanks for a nice side dish!

I made a vegan version using homemade vegatable stock and vegan margarine.  By far the best green beans I've ever made a home.  They've always been a "just okay" vegetable to me.  Now I actually want more.

4 1/2 stars.. I used frozen green beans, but thawed them first. I started with frying bacon and cooking the onion in the bacon grease and butter. I used half the amount of soy sauce as suggested by other reviews. Made it twice to get it right! Took them to a BBQ and everyone loved them!

Good recipe.  It's very salty if you use all of the soy sauce, so I would use a third of what the recipe calls for.  Very tasty.

Very nice change from plain old green beans.  My picky boys ate seconds! The only change I made was to back off on the soy a little.  It just seemed like a bit too much.

I thought these were very, very good.  As suggested by others I cut the soy sauce in half and it tasted just great to me!  Not too salty at all.  This is a wonderful way to use those beans from the garden.

These beans are awsome! We have fresh beans growing now. I followed the recipe except I used chicken bullion 
instead of beef. Will make these again while the beans are in season and will make Brazilan White Rice with them. This is a must try and a keeper!

Even my boyfriend who HATES green beans loved this dish.  I cut the recipe in half (left the garlic the same) and just threw in one beef bouillon cube.  The soy sauce added great flavor to the beans.  I served this with steak and roasted red potatoes.

These greenbeans are very good.  I used half the soy sauce as instructed.  Using the whole amount of soy sauce was just too much sodium.  I might even use a quarter the next time.  But I will surely will make this recipe again.

Way too salty but you can correct that by reducing the amount of soy sauce or use a lower sodium one and leaving out the salt. Added a dash of worchesthire as well.

This was sooooo good!  My only regret is that I didn't have more beans!  This "side dish" took the crown for the whole dinner, even over pecan crusted salmon and rice pilaf.  My kids and DH were bummed when it was all gone.  Will definately make again, soon!

This was a delicious way to fix green beans and make them kind of different. I halved the amount of soy sauce because that was all I had, and it came out fine. ADDENDUM: I made it later and forgot to halve the soy sauce and it was terrible! Remember to reduce the amount of soy sauce. It was very salty and gross!

We liked these beans.  I simplified it alot though.  I cooked the beans to the way I liked them, then put them in to saute with butter and soy with a little garlic too.  No other ingrediets were used .  The sauce thicken and coated the beans and they were done.  Two of the four kids liked them and my husband and I really liked them.  Will definately do again.

Very easy to make and truly tasty. We didn't have a problem with this being too salty at all. I did cut the recipe down to just one pound of beans.

I usually read all the reviews of a recipe carefully before preparing it, and I wish I had this time.

As the recipe is written, this was way, way, way too salty for us.  Soy sauce and bouillion both contain quite a bit of salt, so I think I will purchase some low-sodium versions and try this one again.

I still gave the recipe a good rating, because I am sure these will be very good green beans once the salt content is adjusted.

What a difference in the taste of green beans.  I don't care much for this kind of bean, but adding the soy sauce made me change my opinion.  I probably will cook them more often at my house now that I have this recipe.

These got rave reviews from my dinner guests.  I did cut the amount of butter in half and used veggie broth instead of beef bouillon/water.  They still tasted fantastic.  The sauce was very runny at the end, so I would recommend cornstarch.  But I made this with mashed potatoes so just used the extra sauce as a gravy.  Can't wait to make these again!

This recipe was a hit!  I think from now on I will pair this with Asian cuisines because it does have a strong soy sauce flavor to it, and I think it would complement Asian dishes.  For four people, I used about a pound of green beans and that was just enough.  I halved the recipe, and it turned out great.  This recipe is a keeper and I highly recommend it!

I halved the soy sauce & bouillon cause I know it would be too salty. There was still leftover sauce/marinade even though I did that, so I saved it & used it on some broccoli a couple days later.

Easy, fast and tasty! Made this for the 1st time last nite & substituted fresh green beans for a bag of Birds Eye Steamfresh Green Beans along with low sodium beef broth. Was a HUGE hit with hubby. Definitely putting on my recipe rotation!

While better than tired old plain green beans, I didn't find these exciting enough to make again.

Very tasty.  Took some others' advice and cut down on the soy sauce.  Turned out wonderful =)

I used low sodium soy sauce but it was still too salty for the kids. I think over steamed rice it would have balanced better

This was not our favorite but was OK.  I don't think I will make this again but if I do I will use only 1/4 cup of lite soy and low sodium beef bouillon adding no additional salt but lots of cracked black.

Like Lucy says: 'It's so tasty!' hehe! This was good and I did like the taste. I just used a different sauce other than soy because it is so salty but maybe next time I will try soy. Made it with a chicken pasta dish.

Cooking time was too long for my tates - would've taken them off earlier were I not distracted by other pending disasters.  I omitted the boullion simply because I didn't have any on hand and thought they were a little salty, but not too bad.  I mean, the sauce is basically soy sauce and butter, both of which can be quite salty...

Made this tonight and my boyfriend raved about it! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and halved the reduced sodium soy sauce.  Still tasted salty to me - but if you really think about it,  salt is the first ingredient listed on the boullion, so common sense would say you practically toss in  2 Tbsp of salt right there.

I really did like this recipe a lot, my only complaint is that it is a tad too salty. I even used reduced sodium soy sauce, and half the amount of bullion, next time I will use a little less. I used shallots instead of onions, and frozen steam in the bag green beans and it was still very good.

Too delicious!  Everyone loved these. Even my 6 and 3 yr old.  I did only use half the soy sauce and boiled the beans a little longer. UPDATE: Just as good with 1 cube chicken bouillion.

I make this recipe all the time with canned french style green beans.  I just dump the beans (water and all) into a pot and add the onion, garlic, the beef bullion, and 1/4 c. worcestershire.  I simmer for about 10-15 minutes and then drain and top with a little butter when serving. They go great with grilled steak.  Wonderful way to dress up canned grean beans!

These were very tasty. They presented well too. I chose to use only half the soy as suggested from others, it worked great and I do believe anymore would have been overpowering.

Yum!!  These beans were very tasty.  So much better than plain ones.  However, I did make some changes.  I used less margarine, cut the soy sauce in half (and used low sodium) and for the other half I substituted worcestershire sauce.  Also I had no onions, but it was just fine with out them.  I may have added extra garlic as well- we love our garlic around here!

I served these on Christmas alongside prime rib and whipped potatoes.  They were fabulous... the favorite part of the meal for most of us (even those who don't really like beans!).  My only change, thanks to other reviews, was to use half the soy sauce.      To save time, I boiled the beans the day before and stored them in the fridge without any liquid.

Excellent recipe. I halved the recipe as it was just for my hubby and myself, but followed the ingredients exactly. Neither of us found this recipe to be too salty as some other testers have. Great flavor overall. Will definitely make again.

Fantastic green beans!  I omitted the butter and the salt.  Used olive oil only to saute the garlic and onions and simmered  for 15 minutes after boiling the beans for 5 minutes.  I also used a combination of soy sauce and worcestire sauce to cut down on the salt.

WAY too salty even with cutting down the soy sauce and boullion and the cooking time is too long. Seems like it would be a nice recipe with a few adjustments so I will try again - cutting down soy sauce even more and I'll try steaming the beans but not adding them back in until the last 5 minutes.

I thought the soy sauce would all cook out, but it didn't.  These just tasted like soy sauce....not like green beans.  I thought soy sauce was supposed to be a condiment, not a side dish!

These were interesting.  We used 1/2 the soy sauce and 1/2 water.  They were not overly salty this way, but the kids didn't fall in love with them.  Thanks for the recipe.

Not too sure about this recipe, the end flavour was quite good, but it was a bit messy.  I kept having to put a little water in the pan so that the beans would cook.  Eventually when they cooked I put the oil in and the end result was that the onion and garlic flavours disappeared and just tasted like burnt bits.

This recipe was good, but extremely salty.  The green beans were also not as crunchy as I would have liked them.  Next time I will use less soy sauce and decrease the cooking/simmering time.

This recipe is AWESOME.  This recipe works great for Royal Prestige cookware.  What a wonderful way to cook fresh green beans.

These green beans were wonderful.  Do not use anything but low sodium soy sauce and do not add any more salt.  I usually add salt to everything on my plate but these diffenently do not need any more salt even with the low sodium soy sauce.  The beans were great over rice and served with the Grilled Asian Chicken (also on this web site).  I also used "shallots" (please note change from previous review), and onions instead of garlic because I didn't have any on hand but I'm sure they would be just as good with garlic.

Very good.  My family really loved these beans.  I used only 1/2 of the recommended soy sauce as other reviewers suggested.  The beans had a sweet taste.

We didn't particularly care for these beans. Wasn't quite the flavor I was looking for. Must just be a taste preference thing.

Sorry, we didn't care for green beans cooked this way. Even though we like fresh beans al dente. These were too hard at this cooking time and the soy sauce just made them taste like salty, hard beans.

Really good. Husband thought something was missing (suggested adding sugar or honey) but I served it as is. Thickened the sauce with water and cornstarch after removing the beans and served on top. My picky 9 year old (who likes plain green beans) said is was "good." Certainly a new twist to add to the rotation!

Turned out very well and was a big hit as a Thanksgiving side dish. My only comment is that we used half of the soy sauce and an 1/8 of the bouillon and I thought it tasted salty but in a good way. I think the full amount would be unbearable.

I've made this several times, and it always delivers. The ginger, garlic and soy make a terrific sauce.  Like others, I add a little cornstarch slurry in the last minute or two to thicken the sauce.  I also use the low sodium soy.  Finally, to make the dish easier (and because I like the taste better), I use 3-4 chopped scallions instead of an onion.  Especially with today's steam-in-bag green beans, this is such an easy and tasty side dish. Thanks for sharing!

I think these are the best beans I have ever ate. I just grew my first garden and picked some tonight. I only had maybe 10 beans to work with. I ended up guesstimating on the measurements but it came out AWESOME! Thank you

This is a really good recipe. I did cut it in half just because I didn't need such a large amount . The only other change I made was adding about a teaspoon of cornstarch mixed with a little water. This thickened the sauce a little (I didn't want it too thick) and helped it coat the beans.

This is a good recipe with a few exceptions. Do not add salt. Use a little less than 1/2 cup of soy sauce. I also use unsalted margarine. I find by doing these things the beans are not at all salty for my taste

After adjusting the amount of soy sauce and making a few changes due to time and personal preference, this recipe is 4 and half stars easily.  Like many other cooks suggested, I cut way back on the amount of soy sauce. First off I just threw everything in a crock pot to save time.  I also added a couple of beef neck bones and sliced mushrooms to the mix.  Instead of beef bullion I added what was left of some all-natural beef stock and topped off with water.  The neck bones completed the 'broth' for me.  I cut the soy sauce down to 1/4 cup and used a low sodium version.  I also added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, a few Tbsp. of olive oil (in place of margarine) and lots of fresh cracked black pepper.  Cooked everyone on low all day and the beans came out great.  I usually cut the sodium back in crock pot veggies b/c I always seem to have difficulty with getting the perfect amount esp. since you have to add liquid.  Everyone loved them, and they made the whole house smell great.  I imagine you could make these with a beefy onion soup mix as well in place of the bullion.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved the blend of flavors.  Low sodium soy sauce is an option if it seems too salty.  I nice twist to the traditional bean side dish.

If you want a healthy side dish this recipe is not for you.  But if you have a family that will only eat beans or corn & you're looking for ways to dress them up because you just can't take beans and corn any more, then this recipe is for you!  Seriously, it's very good.  I use one beef bouillon cube dissolved in about 1/2 cup of water.

I'm not a green bean person, but I have to say this was pretty good and my family raved about it.  I cut the soy sauce to 1/4 cup and increased the onion and garlic just a bit.  Very flavorful. Will be making this again and again.

WAY too salty! I even cut back on the soy sauce and it was still all we could taste. I am going to try these again, using only a tablespoon or two of low sodium soy sauce next time. I like the idea of the garlic, onions and beef boullion with the beans.

I make this recipe all the time. It gives my family a break from traditional old green beans. My family loves it and I have now shared it with others.

Great Recipe!  I only modified a few things to "lighten" it up.  Changing the butter to margarine and using low sodium soy sauce made it more to my liking.

This was really excellent, I just reheated the leftovers and devoured them. I reduced the soy sauce by half as others have suggested and could easily have used less or low-sodium, but the resulting beans were sensational. Definitely making these again!

First try: Tasted good. Stick w/ whole cut beans (avoid French cut ones). Adding 1 8oz can cut mushrooms was a nice touch. I cut down soy sauce (used low sodium) and still came out tasting a bit salty.  I'll try Worchestire sauce next round.

This recipe model does have several good dress up options.

A good Chinese/Asian side dish to compliment main dish of same.

By far the absolute best green bean recipe I have ever prepared.  We used olive oil instead of butter and used canned green beans to reduce the cooking time.  Fantastic!

I thought this recipe was good; however the soy sauce was very overpowering and made it taste very salty.  I will try this recipe again, but with a lot less soy.

Great. I didn't use as much soy sauce as other people, I dont like too much of it. I simmered for about 30 mins and it still turned out great. My husband loved these green beans. I will do my bean like this more often. YumO.

I made these for my family's Christmas dinner. It was a GREAT new green bean recipe...I'm always looking for new ways to make vegetables that don't involve a casserole! Everyone in my family is asking for the recipe now.

These were good, but way too salty.  I'll follow other reviews and try them again since my kids liked them, but I didn't feel good about them eating so much sodium.

My husband never wants to give any recipe 5 stars...but he gave this one 5 stars!!!  Easy and delicious.  I scaled down the recipe to 2 servings, and did not add any additional salt or pepper.  I know this will be requested repeatedly from now on.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am definately making this one again. I like salty foods, so this recipie was PERFECT for me. However, if you prefer less sodium, you might want to reduce or water down the soy sauce.

This is the best green bean recipe I've tasted!  Zesty w/ lots of flavor.  Much better than the usual salt and butter.
