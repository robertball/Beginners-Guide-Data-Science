The flavor of these cookies are delicious, but, a little sweet for me.  I did up the lime juice to 1-1/2‚Äù tsps and I am glad I did because it had a beautiful lime flavor.  The texture was crispy in the outside and chewy in the inside.  It reminded me of a macaroon.  I cooked at 350 because the first batch was too dark at 375, but, it might be my oven.
