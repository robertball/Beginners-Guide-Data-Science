5.12.18  First, a few suggestions on preparation.  Coat your baking pan with cooking spray, melt your butter, and beat the egg.  I did zest the lemons and added to the batter.   The cake batter was VERY thick, and I thought barely enough to spread into a 13x9 pan, so I used a pan that was a little smaller.  Of course, what this meant was that the topping would be deeper and just may require a bit more cooking time.  I checked at 27 minutes, and the center was still very jiggly, so I put back into the oven, checking every 3 minutes.  It was starting to get very brown around the edges, so I took it out at 35 minutes.  Even with the addition of the lemon zest, I think this was lacking lemon flavor.  This is ridiculously easy to make, and that’s definitely a positive.  Although these were OK, I still prefer the traditional bright yellow lemon bars with the filling that’s similar to a lemon curd.

I didn't make any changes the first time.
Next time I will add 1 tsp lemon zest. I would like it a little more lemony.  I will probably tweak this each time I make it.  My honey loved it.

Easy and delicious.  Tip:  make ahead and store in fridge before serving.  Cold storage provides a more dense, decadent consistency and flavor!

The topping was too sweet and we didn’t really like it.  Took the advise of other reviewers and Added some lemon zest about 1/4 which made cookie part good and lemony. Next tome I will do without the topping

I only had a golden butter cake mix, so I added a box of lemon cook & serve pudding, mixed well into the dry mix.  An unexpected bonus was it allowed me to add more liquid to the batter. It was about 1/8 cup lemon juice, which was needed for flavor. I  added gradually and kept the batter thick and dry  enough to be pressed into the pan. Lemon zest was added to the batter and icing  (1 tbsp. total) and it turned out great! It was lemony enough, but just for my taste, next time I'll use  lemon cake mix and more zest.

Very good with a few changes, added a little more lemon and refrigerated before cutting. Sprinkled a little powdered sugar on top.  Next time a Graham cracker crust would be nice and some cream cheese icing on top.

Added zest and a little lemon juice to the batter

I will add a bit more lemon juice to the batter next time 
But overall easy and yummy

These were great, but the top was sticky. I made them a second time and topped with coconut before baking. They were perfect!
