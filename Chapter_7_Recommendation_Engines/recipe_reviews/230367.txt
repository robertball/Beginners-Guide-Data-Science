We started with a 5 bone rib roast, about 11 lbs to feed 12 card carrying carnivores. Words just don't fully describe how delicious. I think one of the secrets to a good prime rib is to have your meat at room temperature before putting in the oven. We covered it with paper and set at room temp for 18 hrs. The second is to have a good meat thermometer. Most don't realize how quickly the temp goes up once it starts cooking. I think 130Â° is the magic number and then let it rest for up to 20 minutes. The delicate taste of the Rosemary in the au jus was incredible. We added 3-4 bullion cubes as a tablespoon of butter and some water to make additional au jus. Cleanup was easy because they licked the platter clean.

I used this recipe for a New York roast.  It was easy and my husband really loved it.  I definately will use this again.

I have never cooked one of these by myself, but picked this recipe because I have a Rosemary bush in my yard. It came out great. My guest like their meat medium rare, so I cooked the roast to 125, I could have taken it out at 120, but 125 satisfied my guest that like their steak more towards medium. The garlic, salt,  Dijon and Rosemary combination had all of my guest raving about the flavor of this roast. I did not even needed a horseradish sauce that I had forgotten to prepare. Everyone thought the roast was perfect.

Simple and easy to make. Favors were superb - came out very tender. If not a Rosemary lover - just go a bit lighter : we used only one sprig and flavor was stupendous!!!!  Highly recommended!!!

Wow! This was easy AND great - a winning combo. Made it exactly as the recipe said, but took mine out when the meat thermometer reached 120, since we all like our beef rare. Definitely a Keeper!

My prime rib was boned and great!  I will make this again without any changes to the recipe.  Everyone loved it!  I did age the beef in the frig for a few days.
