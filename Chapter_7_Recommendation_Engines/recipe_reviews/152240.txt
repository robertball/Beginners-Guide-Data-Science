Kids and I decided to deviate from the usual smoothie today and instead made this.  I had leftover peach juice from a can of peaches that I used instead of buying peach nectar. Other than that, I followed the recipe, only doubling it because I knew my daughters would not want to share.  I was right - they wanted even more after they drank the first one.  Great refreshing drink that I am sure will get many requests in this house.

It's good. It reminds me of the bath tub punch that you make, then put sherbet in it.
