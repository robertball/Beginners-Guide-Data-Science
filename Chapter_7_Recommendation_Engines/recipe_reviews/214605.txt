Generally weird taste and I like Balsamic.  Really watery sauce and even with a 2 lbs roast, 6 hours was way to long and made the meat tough and stringy.

This was very vinagery.  Didn't really like it at all.  My boyfriend added some white wine to it and said it made it a little better, but I don't think I will make this again.

This is a pretty good base recipe.  I cooked this as recommended and then after cooking I added 1 heaping tablespoon of sugar, about 1 tsp of salt and 1/4 cup flour dissolved in 1/2 cup water to thicken.  The sugar takes the edge off the sourness.  The salt was just needed, and the flour/water thicken.  In order for gravies and sauces to be thick, they require some sort of thickening agent.  There aren't any thickening agents in this recipe, so reviewers who complained about the sauce being runny should understand why the sauce is runny.

The recipe called for it to cook for 6 hours on high. I thought that was extreme for a 1 1/2 lb roast so I cooked my 2 lb roast on low for 7 hours and it turned out very dry. If I would have cooked it for 6 hours on high, I think it would have turned into a rock. The liquid tasted good though.

this is a great recipe- I had to make a few adjustments- nothing big- as my garlic was dried out- I used 4 teaspoons- jarred- and had no tomato paste- I used 1/4 cup homemade tomato sauce- was perfect for my slowcooker at exactly 4 hours- suggestion was pasta- hubs is not a fan so I boiled cheese tortelinni  and tossed in a light gravy I made from  the great juices of the roast (thickening with flour-milk and white and black pepper)- served with a tossed salad and garlic bread-wish I had known it  would be so great I would have doubled for another meal:-)- I used 1.75 pounds sirloin about 1 1/2 inches thick- thanks for a great recipe:-)

It was very delicious! It was a little on the oily side I think because of the olive oil but overall, it was juicy and had lots of flavor!

It wasn’t inedible but it wasn’t good, either.
