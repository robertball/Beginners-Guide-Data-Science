Brought this to a potluck and had numerous compliments and requests for the recipe.  The only thing I changed was that I added some fresh carrot shavings to give it more color.  I used standard dark raisins and it was great.  I am looking forward to trying it with red grapes as others suggested.

I am always seeing these tasty shredded cabbage salads at holiday pot-lucks. I just know they are loaded with fat, with all the crispy ramen noodles, and tons of sugary dressing. I was on the hunt for a healthier version and found this one. I used a 10oz bag of finely shredded cabbage. For the dressing, I followed it as is but used rice wine vinegar instead of red wine as it was what I had. I tried to make the dressing with less sugar, but it was too tart. I added in the amount of sugar suggested, but then only put half of it on the cabbage mixture to reduce the sugar dressing even further. I figured the other half could be added if really needed later. Although, this one definitely has less oil and sugar to begin with than other similar recipes. I used 1/4 cup each of sliced almonds and the sunflower seeds. Both were unsalted so I added a dash of sea salt and black pepper. I left out the raisins by choice and realized after the salad was done I had forgotten the green onions. It was fine. Also, I would definitely mix in dressing before serving if a crunchy salad is desired. It will completely wilt down within an hour. The recipe does not make a ton anyhow. Made as written I got 5, side dish servings, vs. the 8, at 144 calories each. ty

Wow this is delish! I wanted to take a pic but do not know how to get it small enough to add it here. Don't be afraid to try this recipe. It is so much better than mayo based dressing. Thank you Sharon!

I really liked this salad especially with the sunflower seeds. The oil dressing was a welcome change from the mayo based dressings. I used 3 stevia pkgs and some honey to my desired sweetness (instead of using white sugar) I will be making this again.

I loved this salad and will make it again.  I used craisins instead of raisons.  I also shredded my own cabbage and used 2/3 green and 1/3 red plus peppers and carrots to give it color and taste.

This is a GREAT recipe. Big hit at the family table. So nice to have coleslaw without the mayo! It did have a strong "chinese" flavor b/c of the soy sauce and sesame seeds - didn't fit super well with the ribs and baked potatoes that I made with it. I'm going to try making the slaw without those ingredients next time and see if it will be a little more versatile. Thank you for a great recipe!

Love this!  Easy and delicious and not mayo based.  The raisins sound odd, but are actually very good mixed with the crunch of the almonds and sunflower seeds.  Even my husband likes this recipe!

Reduced sugar to a few teaspoons, and subbed toasted pine nuts for the almonds I didn't have. A wonderful, easy & quick salad!

The dressing is delicious! I always cut my own cabbage, as there have been too many recalls on ready bagged cabbage, lettuce, etc. Will use this dressing over and over!

Delicious and easy! I halved the dressing and it seemed like enough. Just sprinkled a few raisins on each persons plate for garnish. Love the toasted almonds and sunflower seeds. Thanks for sharing!

Used a 16oz  bag of cabbage and the sauce was WAAY too much still. Cut sauce in half next time for a 16oz bag. Used peanuts instead of the other nuts and it was really good! Lots of compliments and easy to make.

This recipe was delicious and a huge hit with my family.  I made up the dressing but only used about half of it.  I also added shredded carrots and a few crunchy chow mein noodles on top.

I liked this much better than a similar recipe that uses 1/2 cup vegetable oil. Really enjoy the simplicity too!
