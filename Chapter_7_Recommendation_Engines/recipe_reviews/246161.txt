I had my reservations when I started but I thought I would give it a try. For the amount of sugar they are not very sweet but I did use unsweetened applesauce. The amount of batter it made it should go in a larger pan to produce a more normal height brownie. My husband summed it up best: "They don't really taste like anything".

Very good; moist and luscious! I did a couple of things differently: I did not have any applesauce so I instead pureed some peaches canned in their own juice (drained). I also added 2 eggs (for fear the peaches would not act as a binder like apples would)Maybe an egg or two would be a good idea even if you use applesauce? Also added about a cup of walnuts just because I try to feed my family nuts as much as possible. I baked it in a pyrex dish that measures about 7 1/2 x 12. Seemed too much batter for that dish so I also put some in a small 6x6 inch pyrex that I am going to freeze for my husband and I. Only baked them for 25-30 minutes or until it sprung back when touched. We farm and the guys are in the field now so I will be taking these to the field as a treat! (also wonderful with a dip of ice cream alongside)

I like these... they have a different tang to them from the yogurt and the coffee. I do think some nuts would improve the texture. I am chilling them to see how that works as well..
