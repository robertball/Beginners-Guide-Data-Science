I have to admit that I did not shape the tenderloin into the heart shape, but it tasted great despite the traditional round shape.  I don't pound the tenderloin at all, I simply pop a small (and very fresh) tenderloin in the freezer for a short time to solidify it a bit and then I take it out and slice the slightly frosty meat very very thin.  By the time you lay it out on the platter and top it with the remaining ingredients for serving, the meat is no longer frosty, just mouthwateringly buttery and cold.

Excellent!  I didn't make it in the shaped of a heart, but the dressing is perfect, and so easy too!

The dressing is unusual for carpaccio but it takes great! I'll definetley make this again. I couldn't find arugula so I used baby spinach instead.

I can’t personally say how this turned out. I can’t stomach the thought of eating raw meat (it’s a texture thing), BUT the friend I made it for is Parisian, VERY Parisian and he doesn’t give out compliments easily. HE gave this 5 stars which says a lot. Made exactly as written and it was a hit. The only thing that didn’t get 5 stars was my attempt at making it heart shaped. LOL Great job again Chef John!

I actually made this for a group event so I did not make hearts but followed the rest of the recipe. It was excellent and I was surprised how many people would it the raw meat. The combination of meat and Arugula and dressing is perfect. A great high end appetizer if you are trying to impress others
