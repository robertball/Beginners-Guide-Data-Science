BEWARE: put the tinfoil wrapped pork in a baking dish! The recipe didn't say to do so. I put them on my oven rack, the oil leaked out and started a fire in my oven that smoked up the entire house.

I put olive oil in the bottom of a glass casserole dish just to coat, then arranged the chops in the dish. I dotted the chops with a little butter, added the seasonings (including a little garlic salt) and sealed the dish with foil before baking. Tender, easy, and good!

This recipe was great!!! I did all the steps but added a few extra things: 2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce instead of 1, salt/pepper & seasoning salt, and I added freshly minced garlic to the top of all the chops. That with everything else...Mmmm delicious!

I liked this recipe!  I was concerned about the amount of olive oil and butter for each chop since I was using boneless chops, so I halved the amount of olive oil and butter for each foil wrapped chop.  They still turned out tender and delicious.  Thanks!

This was very good. I made it using the exact ingredients and cooking instructions, except I browned the chops first. I cook on 350 for 30 minutes, then lowered to 200 for 15 minutes, because I was afraid of overcooking them. They came out very moist, almost too moist, and the bottoms had a nice thin brown crust from the butter and oil. Yum! My kids ate it up quickly, my husband and I thought it was good as well, but were a little thrown off with how tender they were. They almost had a tender fish consistency, which is why I am rating it 4 stars. I will definitely cook these again, experiment with seasonings, and cook them in the oven for less time.

This recipe was simple & tasty. For 8 thin cut chops, after seasoning them I put 4 T of olive oil in a glass pan & rubbed the pc's in it. Then in the same pan put 2T of melted butter mixed w/worcestershire sauce & a bit of garlic, again rubbed the pc in this mixture. Then baked covered in the same pan. Made lots of juice, didn't dry out at all, perhaps even less oil could be used. The pork chops cooked in less time maybe 20 min and were very flavorful.

Easy and simple recipe!  Make sure to put the wrapped chops in a baking dish to catch the leaking oil.  I halved the oil and butter--next time I will 1/4 the amount.  You just don't need nearly as much as the recipe calls for.  Flavor was good...I used soy instead of worchestershire like some of the other reviews suggested.  I also baked at 350, but I found they needed 45 min at this temp not 35 min.  I think the lower temp helps keep the chops tender. I will use this recipe again next time I'm in a rush and need something simple.

I let the pork chops marinate in some lemon pepper and worchester sauce for a few hours before baking.  I added some more lemon pepper and w. sauce before baking and they turned out GREAT!

Not at all awesome, other than for its simplicity. Despite the generous amount of lemon-pepper I used, the taste was rather bland. My husband had to add a dash of barbecue sauce to give the stuff some taste.

I have made this several times...but do cut the amount of evo and butter.  Best advice I have...use bone in pork chops...boneless just don't come out as tender.  An easy recipe and you can cut the fat!

I didnt give it a 4 because it could be tweaked as follows:  Rub lemon pepper (fresh is better!) on the chops. Sear pork chops with oil until golden brown on both sides. Place in buttered cassarole dish. top with pad of butter and worcestershire. top dish with a piece of foil. Bake in preheated oven until to desired doneness.  The dish will turn out moist and delicious and not that icky white looking piece of meat in the picture.

Awesome!  If using very thinly sliced pork, cook for much less time.  I cooked mine for 20 min and they were very dry.  I also put fresh dill on top before baking and it was fantastic.

This tasted really good, but when I put the parcels in the oven within 10 minutes the oven was smoking so I had tdo pull them out.  At this point what i did was take everything out of the packages and put them into a shallow dish, cover it with foil and finished baking it.  It was great!  Next time I think I will just do it all in the dish!!!!!

Very good, tender and SIMPLE. I followed the recipe exactly and placed the foil-wrapped chops in a glass baking dish for 35 mins, came out perfectly! Next time I'll try fiddling around with more ingredients and see what comes of it...just wanted to try the original recipe 1st.   Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have lemon pepper and I didn't have Worcestershire sauce...but I did have paprika, oregano, basil leaf, and thyme....and these babies melted in my mouth! I like all the people who rated this recipe and didn't add their own seasoning or a "little bit of this and a little bit of that". Heated up some mac and cheese and green beans...yum yum!

A nice recipe for a change.  Not a personal favourite.  It was a bit bland.  I think if you add more spice and herbs it would be great... like the oregano and rosemary suggestions.

Found this recipe when I was looking for something that didnt require flour.  I was just cooking for myself and only making 1 chop.  It was very easy to do and the pork chop was quite juicy.

I had to change this just because I couldn't imagine eating pork chops that hadn't been browned before going in the oven. I browned them in a skillet then put them in the packets. THe flavor is good and they are tender.

Nice and flavorful. Used the full amount of oil and butter, but I have a sneaking suspicion the recipe would be fine with a little less. But didn't want to chance it. Shaved 5 minutes off the cook time for 3/4 inch boneless chops.

eck! I followed all directions and these chops were not good at all. My husband will eat anything so he said they were ok but my parents and myself were not impressed. It reminded me of fish while I was eating it.

Very easy and delicious alternative for pork chop recipes...I put these wrapped pork chops on a foil lined cookie sheet for easy cleanup!  You definitely need something under these as they leak no matter how carefully you wrap.  I followed the recipe exactly but added several rings of raw onion on top prior to baking.   Served with stuffing and corn.  My two and three year olds who are usually fussy about eating pork chops gobbled these right up as they were that moist.

We added  more ground pepper to the lemon pepper and rubbed it into the chops, then grilled on the bbq.  Tossed the butter, olive oil and W sauce into a pan with sliced mushrooms and onions, spooning over the grilled chops.  Served with smashed garlic potatoes to help your tongue deal with the pepper:  yummy!

It´s REALLY important to put it in a pan so the juices don´t spill out into the oven. But we loved this dish! I changed it up a little because I didn´t have lemon pepper, I just rubbed salt, garlic and cilantro into the chops before wrapping them. Delish!

I am not a fan of pork chops, but these were delicious. I used thin pork chops, so I should have cooked a little less time. I think next time I will use less oil/butter and more Worcestershire sauce. Overall great and quick meal!

These chops are TERRIFIC!!  I prepared them exactly as the recipe instructs and they came out so tender and juicy.  I think the next time I will add sliced onion, but only because we love onion.  Thanks for a great pork chop recipe.

Simple, yet awesome! 
I did take some of the suggestions and added some garlic powder on both sides of the pork chop. I put 1/2 tbsp on butter on the foil, placed the chop, and the other half on the top of the pork chop, then added the oil and Worcestershire sauce. I prepared this 1 hour before and let the packets sit in the fridge to marinate before putting it in the oven.   It was great on white rice. The liquid was absorbed by the rice perfectly!  A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing!

Turned out moist and flavorful- absolutely delicious! Tried adding garlic per some reviews but I didn't really  feel like it added anything to the recipe which is odd because I generally find everything is better with garlic.

Decided to pair pork chops with my go-to summer salad tonight instead of chicken.  This recipe seemed like it would be flavorful and easy enough to throw together for an impromptu visit at my grandparent's house.  Turns out... I was right!  Not only is it quick and downright delicious, there's virtually no mess to deal with afterwards.  I literally balled the foil up and was done.  Not to mention, the ooo's and ahh's over the unexpected tenderness.  There's always a small victory to be had when no knives are required at your table!  Thanks so much for sharing these chops!  This one's a keeper.

I wasn't overwhelmed.  That being said, I used less than 1/2 the recommended butter and 1/2 oil.  I just could not stomach all that fat.  Perhaps that is why.  I've had marinades that worked better.  I will say it was really easy.

I would recommend cooking them a little longer. Also, put them on a baking sheet or in a casserole dish because the oil leaks out of the foil. Over all they had a good flavor and were very simple to make.

Pretty good, I added a little salt and a couple shakes of onion powder to add flavor. P.S. It's a no-brainer that you would probably need to place the foil packets on a baking sheet, for you who need the obvious stated:)

Delicious! I marinated the pork chops overnight with W Sauce, Soy sauce and lemon pepper so as to let the chops absorb more flavor. I used a ziploc bag to marinate them. I also sprinkle some dried basil leaves on the chops before I close the foil. Next time I will try to bake the chops in a glass dish as suggested by another reviewer. Thanks for sharing this great recipe. This has become one of my regular dishes.

I made this last night with the worst cut of pork chops (if you want to call them pork chops) and it was GREAT!!!  My husband ate 3, and all three of my kids ate 2 each!!!  I did however marinate the chops overnight and the flavor was AWESOME!!!

Very juicy and tender! Some modifications made included: substituted chicken breast (removed skin) for pork chops; added jerk seasoning as another reviewer suggested; and eliminated Worcestershire sauce and reduced butter and olive oil by half. Cooked chicken on 350 for about 35 minutes. I made slits in the chicken breast before rubbing in the spices. This is a very easy dish to make and tasty also. My husband liked it because it had a bit of pep to it.  For easier cleanup place a pan underneath the breasts as the oil and butter leaks out of the foil.

This was a great recipe! I rubbed the pork chops in the lemp pepper and marinated it in melted butter, olive oil and worchestershire for several hours.  I then baked at 350 in the foil packets (adding the marinade)with a slice of lemon on both for 35 minutes.  I served with carrots and broccoli I boiled in chicken stock and mashed potatos.  Excellent!

Outstanding!!!  Because of complaints of blandness (I hate nothing more), I used a lot of garlic lemon pepper and added seasoned salt as well.  Used more worsh, sauce and voilla!  This was great!  Will make it again for sure.  Word to the wise....only use more lemon pepper if you are one that enjoys pepper!!  It is very powerful!!

I thought the chops were bland and way too peppery.  My husband liked them.  We both found them a little dry even with all the oil and sauce.  If he makes them again I'll suggest adding some actual lemon squeezed over the top.

I didn't have the lemon pepper in the pantry, so I improvised with Italian seasoning, garlic, and steak seasoning from Mccormick. I used two tbsp of Worcestershire sauce on each and cut the oil in half for each chop. They came out wonderful and extremely tender. My family loved it! We wil be doing this again soon! Can't wait to try it with the lemon pepper!

I had great hopes but no. Liquid/butter spilled out of the pockets and burned on the bottom of my oven - smoking up my place.  Then, when I took the chops out, they were steamed in their juice and dry with little flavor. Total waste of 6 big pieces of tin foil too.

My Family Loved this recipe. I took a few notes from other peoples reviews. I made sure I put the wrapped chops in a baking dish and glad I did because the juices really leaked! I also added a few garlic cloves and an extra tsp of Worcestershire sauce. And this was awesome! Really easy recipe with little prep, which is always a plus because I don't always have a lot of time. I definitely will be cooking this one again!

Delicious!!  My family is not big fans of lemon pepper, so I used a mixture of equal parts garlic powder, seasoned salt, and parsley in place of the lemon pepper.  Other than that, followed the recipe and it was awesome!

Good, but nothing spectacular.  I almost forgot the worcestershire sauce but remembered at the last minute and added it in.  I didn't really notice any flavor standing out to me, which is surprising bc this dish has some pretty strong flavors.  Relatively easy, so something worth tinkering with.  Thanks for the recipe!

I wanted to like this recipe; it sounded SO good.  We live at high altitude, and because of that, it seems whenever we bake pork chops, they are DRY!  I even tried lightly browning these first, then doing everything exactly as the recipe says, and my chops were still dry.  They were thick, boneless pork chops, and I baked them at 350 for 30 minutes. Once I figure out how to bake my pork chops without drying them, I will try this recipe again.

I liked that this recipe was simple, I also customized it a little. I used regular black pepper, salt, & onion powder. I didn't have lemon pepper, and I didn't use Worcestershire sauce because that just sounded awful to me. I didn't have olive oil either. We had veggie oil and country crock butter at home.   I didn't have foil either, and I only had two bone pork chops. It turned out juicy, and tender. It helps if you don't wrap it and can keep an eye on it, I started cooking at 400 but lowered it to 375 and it took 45 minutes to cook.  Don't use too much oil & butter, I only used 1 tablespoon of oil and 1 of butter. You can add more as it cooks if you want. I basically had to substitute because I didn't have certain things, and because I didn't like the idea of using Worcestershire sauce.  It turned out juicy, tender and best of all the recipe is simple enough you can make it your own. If you're looking for a simple pork chop dinner then this is. We had this with mashed potatoes and veggies.   Even my bf liked it, I think it helps if you use bone pork chops. I really think that the bone makes a difference. I really loved the recipe didn't call for too many ingredients and that you can add or subtract to it and make it your own.

very good and very easy (the kids helped me make this).  The only problem was that the butter leaked out the foil, but I just put them in baking dish and they were good to go.  Will definitely make them again.

This was delicious. I substituted bacon fat for the vegetable oil and A-1 steak sauce for the Worcestershire sauce (I can't stand the idea of eating anything with anchovies in it and find that Steak Sauce can be substituted drop for drop for Worcestershire Sauce.) The drippings from each packet was drizzled over rice...wonderful.

Make sure you put a pan under the meat. The juices did make it out of the tightly wrapped foil and would have started a fire if I had not followed the piece of advice. Other then that, very good, even my husband liked it and he is a meat know it all! :)

Followed the directions except used 1/2 the oil.  The pork chop was swimming in oil and butter.  Certainly won't make this again, and I love pork chops.

I don't know what I did wrong, but i wasn't at all impressed with this dish.  I made it exactly as it was laid out, but when it came time for dinner, i didn't taste it in the least.  My girlfriend said she loved it, but i found the most tasteful part was dripping the leftovers from the aluminum foil onto rice.

These turned out great for me! I first seasoned them generously with lemon pepper and garlic powder and then halved the amount of butter, olive oil, and worcestershire used. I put the packets on a baking sheet and followed the cooking directions as in the recipe, 35 mins at 400 degrees. They turned out very tender and flavorful! Will be adding to my repertoire.

Fast and good, but a bit too chewy. Will try another reviewer's suggestion to bake at 350 for 30 minutes, then lower to 200 for another 15 minutes.

When we fix pork chops, we typically grill them.  I found this recipe and tried as an alternative - it was wonderful.  I did not use any oil and I used only a sliver of butter on top and below the pork chop.  Very tender!

Delicious!  The only change I made was to add some minced garlic before closing the foil.  YUM!  Will definitely do these again.  I used two bone-in chops and cooked for 35 minutes. Terrific with mashed potatoes.

I made these tonight for dinner and I wish I had made more for leftovers! They were fantastic! Truly tasty and could be cut with a fork. I did cut the oil and butter to half. Also mixed 2 Tbsp of worchester sauce with 2 Tbsp soy sauce and then mixed 1 Tbsp with the halved butter/oil and it was plenty of liquid. SO yummy! This will be a regular from now on.

we make this recipe all the time!  we love how simple and easy it is and the taste can't be beat.  We have also modified the recipe for the grill... we just drizzle some olive oil on both sides of the chop and then use the lemon pepper as a rub... awesome!

Excellent, moist enough to cut with fork, very easy to make, the small amount of worcestershire makes a great flavor-not over powering.  My husband raved about them!

I loved these pork chops - they are melt in your mouth good.  Juicy and flavorful.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 is that my husband didn't like the lemon flavor with the worestershire sauce.  I did it a second time with just salt and pepper instead of lemon pepper and he loved it.  I also do not use the olive oil and butter - just the butter as I prefer that taste.  Thanks Matt for sharing!

I liked these more than my boyfriend did.  I think I used too much lemon pepper, because even though the chops were tender, they tasted a little too strong, too salty.  (It could have just been the brand of lemon pepper I used.)  If I do make these again, I will make sure to use lemon pepper with no salt added, otherwise, they are just too salty.

This recipe is a keeper.  We all liked every bite!  Even my extremely picky 10yr old!  Here's how I did mine.  I cut down on the butter and olive oil as others did.  Then, I put a few fresh basil leaves(chopped) on top and sliced a small onion and layered the rings on top, also.  Then I poured the worchestershire sauce on top.  They turned out very juicy and good!

These pork chops were good but quickly descovered one layer of tinfoil isn't enough.  Once I put the second layer on they cooked ok withough leaking.  Besides that it was great and I will be definitely be having it again.

After reading the reviews on this recipe, I had made several changes to it.  I added garlic powder, seasoned salt, and a dash of cayenne to the chops. I also cut the oil and butter down to HALF. After all was said and done...they were just ok. I don't think I would make them again..I just don't do bland. For anyone looking for a tip.....maybe try pan searing them first to get a good flavor on the outside.  Just a thought!!

The taste was very good, but I used boneless pork chops and even though I cut the cooking time down to 25 minutes, they were very dry. I might give it a try again though, because we really liked the taste, and I'll cut the cooking time down even more.

This recipe was quick and easy for us(which is always a help in this house!)  It was very tasty and very different from how we usually eat pork chops!  I served this with a baked potato and green beans. I will definitely be making this again!

I didn't get much out of this at all. Sure, the recipe is fast and easy, but my chops were sort of bland - there was hardly any flavor at all (I even put on more lemon pepper than the recipe calls for.) I don't think I'll be making this again.

I have no idea how, but mine came out dry and my oil/butter leaked out even though I sealed the foil tightly. Use a cookie sheet!  If not for being dry, these would have been yummy!

These turned out really great!  I have been looking for a simple but good pork chop recipe for a while and this will be the one I use from now on.  They were moist and full of flavor.  The only problem is if there are any cracks or small tears in the tin foil olive oil will leak all over your oven!  Halfway through I but them on a cookie sheet and that worked just fine.  Otherwise they were awesome!

This recipe is super easy to prepare, and that's why I loved it so much.  I did exactly as the recipe stated, except I added some minced garlic on top of each pork chop.  Also, the package of pork chops I had on hand were of different thickness/size, so I adjusted the butter/olive oil to each size.  The pork chops were very tender.  Next time I may add a little bit of chopped onion and mushroom with each pork chop to add a little bit of extra flavor.  Also, yes, place the tin foil wrapped chops in a baking dish of some sort, because liquid will leak out.  I will make again!

I had to substitute the lemon pepper with lemon garlic but it still tasted great! Will use this recipe again but probably cut back the time a little because the chops were a little too over cooked.

My husband is not one to compliment my cooking, but he absolutely loved these pork chops.  I followed the directions exactly and he just raved about them. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I would definitely not agree with the reviewers who claimed their chops were bland, because they were not at all. I would suggest being very generous with the lemon pepper and adding some minced garlic and onion slices on top of each chop. That really made a difference in my chops. I also cut the oil/butter in half, and would probably use even less next time to cut the crazy amount of fat.  I am giving four stars instead of five because while my chops were tasty and juicy, they weren't as tender as I'd expected. Not sure what I could do next time to make them more tender? Overall, I will make them again.

The concept of the recipe was great....putting the chops in aluminum foil with the butter and olive oil definitely made them tender.  However, the lemon pepper didn't seem to compliment it well.  Next time I make this I will not use lemon pepper.

This was easy and yummy! I marinated the pork chops in the mix for a few hours before. I pan seared it with a lid and it was just as good as in the oven. Very tasty and will definitely do it again! Yum!

I have to say this is the first time I have ever rated a recipe this low.  I did cut back on the oil/butter and cooked on grill at 350 and they were so dry and bland that we had a couple then had to stop eating them.  Sorry, would just be much better cooked right on the gril, pan or even oven.

For some reason they came out a little dry (this is what was told to me since i am a vegetarian). They were still enjoyed and I will probably used again if I need a quick pork chop recipe.

Messy, but VERY tasty...

Though the chops were extremely tender, they ended up sitting in a puddle of butter/oil/juices - which might make some people think twice about trying them.

Depending on your personal tastes, you might have to add a little extra seasoning.  By mistake, I picked up Lemon Pepper SEASONING SALT - and this gave it the extra bit of kick it needed.

All around, a great recipe - but nothing too fancy about it ;);)

I make these at least once a month on a weeknight! They always come out tender and flavorful. I always place a layer of tin foil on the oven rack to prevent oil from getting on the heating coils or you can put them on a cookie sheet. Best pork chops ever and no cleanup!

These were very tasty chops. To cut down on some of the calories i put the olive oil on the bottom and a pat of butter on the top. I really don't think you need both on top and bottom. Came out very tender and juicy. Will definately make again.

Over all this was very good.  What I did was mix the oil, worcesteshire and lemon pepper, poke some small holes in the chops and marinate them for about 4 hours. Baking them in foil was great, they came out JUICY and fully cooked, no drying out or burning. The only complaint from my husband was not enough pepper. I will definitely make these again and probably even marinate them overnight next time.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Be sure to use bone-in pork chops.  Also, I recommend pan searing until lightly golden brown before baking the pork chops.  It seals in the juices.  You don't need to bake them nearly as long as the recipe states.  I would say 15-20 minutes at 400 is plenty.  Absolutely place the foil wrapped chops in a dish or pan to avoid the juices running off and burning!  Quite a bit of juice came out of the foil, but this was great as I was able to reserve the pan juices and pour them over the chops for extra flavor.

Pork chops are one of the few things that I really struggle with. Like many people, I find them hard to cook without drying them out. This recipe prevents that problem. As for the person who threw the tinfoil packages straight in the oven, and then was surprised that they leaked. . . Please! That was an error on the part of the person who did it, not the author of the recipe. Sometimes you need to think logically and not expect a recipe to give every possible minute detail.

Simple and delicious! Mine came out a little dry, but I think that's because I used less olive oil than the recipe called for, and I had very thick pork chops. I didn't have any lemon pepper, so I simply peppered the chops and laid a slice of lemon on top. I also added a clove of minced garlic to the top of the chop! Wonderful!

My husband said that this was the best pork chop he had ever had.  He is not a huge fan of pork and he was very impressed.  Followed the recipe for the most part, but added a 1/2 teaspoon more Worcestershire and a 1/4 teaspoon of chopped garlic on top of the chop.  Thanks!

It's a RARE occurrence when the side dish is better than the main one, but that was the case this time. :( Prep couldn't have been easier, but the chops themselves were nothing to write home about (sorry!). Although seasoned nicely, my chops were SUPER tough. I recall thinking that I should either reduce the temperature or adjust the baking time, but didn't. Now I'm wishing I had trusted my gut.... I also regret not cutting the butter / oil by at least HALF. This recipe calls for FAR too much liquid! Despite sealing my chops REALLY well (I even DOUBLE sealed them), most of the liquid oozed out. I had to place everything on a cookie sheet to collect the juices that were dripping down into my oven. My husband and I rarely ever share the same culinary point of view, but we both give this a thumbs down. Maybe this will float your boat, but it did nothing for us. Thanks anyways, Matthew.

These were perfect.  They were tender and tasty!  I used a spicy pork rub in lieu of pepper and they came out just right.  As one review-er pointed out, you'll want to place the foil-wrapped chops in a foil-lined baking pan keep things clean.

I made this because I couldn't get to the store, and I had all the ingredients on hand.  Also, I was curious about the cooking method. I followed the advice to cut down on the oil and butter.  Overall, it was a pretty good quick and easy meal, but nothing spectacular. The chops came out pretty moist and tender, so that was a plus.  I think the ingredients and method might actually work better on fish, so I may try that. I also think it's versatile in that you can change up the spice rub, so I may play with that too.

These are definitely simple, but not particularly awesome.  I just don't think lemon pepper and worchestershire sauce go that well together.  Also, you simply MUST cut down on the amount of butter and oil prescribed, or you'll have a greasy mess on your hands.

Would have given it 5 stars but mine was a little dry. I used boneless chops. Next time I will brown on both sides first in olive oil and garlic. I used 1 tablespoon total of butter (with 2 chops) and 2T of Worcestershire sauce on top of each. My husband loved it (his was thicker, i think it stayed jucier). Will definitely make this again. Very easy

So simple to make.  Totally great to eat.  37.5 minutes at 400 resulted in perfect tenderness.  The Worcestershire sauce really mattered!  And it seemed like a lot of butter and olive oil, but it resulted in the perfect cooking medium.  Complimented the dish with steamed asparagus and rice pilaf (SF treat!).  A good buttered wheat roll complimented it nicely.  5 stars and favorited.

yummy and easy. I didn't individually wrap the pork chops - I made an envelope of foil in a glass pan that held all four. I also used a lot less butter and oil. Turned out great. I did cook them 35 minutes at 400 but that was a few minutes too long - so keep an eye on them!

Made this tonight and it was a hit.  I followed the advice of others before me:  I marinated the chops in Worcestershire and EVOO for a few hours, and I added minced garlic on top of each chop.  I also spread the butter (only about a total of 2 tsp per) on each side of the chops.  I did not add any additional oil or Worcestershire sauce since they still had marinade on them.  Then, to prevent the packs from leaking/getting holes in them (I used bone-in chops) I lined each piece of foil with a piece of parchment paper.  The last change I made was to cook them on the grill.  I used a med heat and put the chops on the top shelf.  Delicious!

These were the most tender chops ever! You could wrap some new red potatoes and fresh veggies in the foil with each chop for a complete meal!

These were good and everyone liked them. That being said, I could barely taste the lemon or pepper. Like other reviewer said, they were bland, but when cooking for kids that is fine. They were tender and no chewey.

I made this and it turned out pretty good. There is something though that I don't like and its grey porkchops! I had a couple of chops left over and the next day I browned them on the grill. I would say after making these, put them under the broiler for a minute or so. That seems to make them "pop".

I found this very bland and very dried out even though it was sitting in a poole of moisture that accumulated inside the foil. Visually they were not appealing either. I wouldnt make it again.

It was okay, a little bland for my tastes. Definately simple and I followed other reviewers suggestions to put foil wrapped chops in a baking dish, but found the oil/butter mixture just swimming around the chops and just didn't get the flavour for all that fat so I won't make this again, sorry.

I made this as a slight change to my usual pork chop recipe, and it was good, though I would not necessarily say awesome. It´s incredibly simple and quick, so that´s always hepful. I have to say that I didn´t use nearly half as much butter or oil, so I recommend using less to save a few calories.

After reading the reviews, I changed this up a bit.  I only used 1 T of olive Oil on bottom of foil (Use Generous piece of foil) and I added chopped onions and fresh sliced mushrooms on top of my thick boneless pork chop.  I added a seasoning salt and less lemon pepper with the worstershire sauce.  They were tender and juicy.

Loved this recipe!  My husband went back for seconds.  This was so easy and the chops were so tender they melted in your mouth. I did use a different seasoning though.  I was out of lemon pepper (don't know how that happened) so I used Montreal Chicken seasoning by McCormick instead. Turned out fabulous. I will try the lemon pepper the next time I make this to see if I like the flavor just as much.  Thank you for posting this.

I made these using a sliced pork tenderloin instead of the bone in chops. I also used an 11x7 pan instead of the foil. I went by the recipe except I did add some garlic salt as well and they turned out yummy! I think you could get by with a little less butter and oil, but you have to have a good amount so that the chops stay tender. I might try a couple tablespoons less next time. The meat had a great flavor and was very tender. My husband even used the leftover marinade for his potatoes! Thanks for the yummy dinner recipe!

I made this as the recipe stated (I used garlic pepper instead).  The porkchops were gray-colored and chewy even though they had tons of liquid in the aluminum packets.

I'm not crazy about lemon pepper in general BUT this is an excellent way to cook the pork chops! No need to brown in advance - just wrap up with your preferred seasoning and you have a great meal, easy and quick to make.

I'm not a big fan of lemon pepper, but this was sooo good. The first bite i was kinda iffy but once i ate it w/ my vegtables it was wonderful and VERY easy to make. My husband is a VERY picky eater and he to loved them! I cut down on the butter and oil by half and added a little garlic salt to give it a kick!! GREAT taste easy cleanup will totally cook again!

The pork came out tender.  Thats the only nice thing I can say, unfortunately.  I know this sounds stupid, but it was way too peppery for us!  I guess that should be a given, but NOBODY else said it but me.  And I LOVE pepper.  Also, despite the extreme pepper taste the chops were bland.  I poured on the salt but still... maybe adding garlic would have helped?  Well, at least I have a new way of cooking chops, I could see doing them the same way with the butter, oil, garlic, seasoned salt, etc,.. just not lemon pepper!  Sorry.

This recipes was delicious.   I can't get my husband to stop asking for it.  He went to the grocery store and bought more pork chops just for this.  Quick hint, however, I didn't add as much butter as they told me to and it still turned out good.

This wasn't outstanding, but it was simple, and worth trying again. I used both chicken breasts and pork chops, and I think the chicken was better. Also, I cut down on the oil a bit.

Very very easy and super yummy.  Make sure you have some warm bread & butter for this.  The juice makes a good dipper.  I only used 1 tablespoon of oil and butter to cut back on calories.  And it still came out juicey.  It goes great with corn.

As is, this recipe is very bland. I tweeked it by using white creamer potatoes & a lot of salt, pepper 7 garlic to the pot. Then it came out wonderful.

I made this last night for my fiance and i as we watched movies.  It was awesome.  I thought it would be too spicy because of all the papper I put on it.  But he loved it! and so did i.  Thanks so much, it was quick and easy.

These were good. I didn't have as many porkchops as I thought. So I used two chops and two chicken breast. I actually like this on the breast better, because the chops were a little drier and tougher and didn't absorb the flavors as well as the chicken did. But they were still pretty good. 
Thanks for the recipe.

The title of the recipe says it all. The only changes I made was to lower the butter and increased the lemon pepper other than that I followed to the t. It's a nice change from the everyday chop.

Both my kids and husband liked these chops and asked that I keep the recipe and make them again. They came out very juicy and tender if not a bit messy. Easy for a beginner cook like me!!

I was a little nervous when I saw the great range of reviews for this recipe. My husband encouraged me anyway, because he loves lemon pepper. This recipe was awesome. The meat was so tender. I added extra salt and pepper to give it a kick as well as dried basil. I also eyeballed the amount of olive oil and butter needed, cutting it drastically. There was still alot of juice, but every time I've cooked with foil packets you get that anyway. My husband said its a keeper!

This was excellent!  I will definitely make this again.  The only thing I would recommend with this is to close the foil tightly.  Lots of juices seep out and it can get messy.

This one flopped. There was too much liqiud even after I scaled it down as reccommended by others. It was in fact bland and kind of salty. My husband did not even finish his which was a first. I would not advise trying this one.

Awesome!  I also reduced the butter and oil quantity.  Marinated the meat with seasonings and then added more of the same seasonings prior to wrapping in foil.  Will be making this for my New Years Eve get together.  Thanks.

I was not crazy about this recipe. If you are not careful, the juices will drip out of the package and into the oven which causes a big smoky mess. I would put a cookie sheet or something underneath to catch the drippings. Still, it didn't have too much flavor, even after adding more seasonings before cooking. Would not make again.

So simple and delicious.  I used more lemon pepper than called for (the kind with garlic in it)and also a touch of crushed sage which I think gave it a little extra something that earlier posters said was missing.  5 year old declared it to be her favorite-she thought it was chicken.

I liked that the chops came out tender.  The flavor was pretty bland, and it made a greasy, oily mess in my oven.  Guess I need to work on my "wrap each chop tightly" technique.  Would like to try again, but with less butter/oil and some other flavor, like onion or garlic.  Will try again sometime.

I thought that this recipe was very easy. It turned out surprisingly good, better than i thought it would. I didn't have any worchestire sauce and had already gone to the trouble of getting everything ready to i continued on and used lemon juice instead. I also didn't have any lemon pepper so i just used normal pepper instead. It turned out really good although it may have been because i was starving because i hadn't eaten anything all day. This recipe is definitely something that i will try again.

The pork chops were almost braised when I opened up the foil packets. There was SO MUCH liquid.  They didn't brown much, unfortunately, and I think most of the lemon pepper may have "washed off" because I thought they were a little bland. However, the meat was very moist! And the no-cleanup with the foil was FABULOUS of course. Next time I'll use half the butter and oil and see what happens. It would be interesting to add a few veggies in each pouch... something to try!

This was pretty good. Very tender. I personally dont like the flavor all that much, but my husband really liked it. I think I might have put too much lemon pepper, But I also think it might need a veggie in there. Maybe some green or red peppers, or carrots or something.

First I made up a mixture of 1 tablespoon of lemon pepper seasoning, 1 tbsp of garlic powder, 1 tbsp onion powder, 1 tbsp of ground black pepper and mixed together.  I got a bowl and poured in some olive oil and set aside and a stick of butter cut in 1 tbsp pats.  I rinsed off my chops and let them dry.  the mixture did about 6 chops before I had to mix another batch I had 19 chops to do.   Process the next step one chop at a time so you don't hamper each chop being well seasoned.

Pinch up the seasoning mix and liberally hand sprinkle over both sides of the chop.  Dip a basting brush in the olive oil and brush over both sides of your season chop.  Put the chop in the center of foil paper top with a pat of butter and a tsp of Worchester sauce.  Fold packet closed tightly.  Do next chop the same way until you're finished.

I placed the foil packets in a bowl or pan overnight in the fridge.  

Take the packets out about 30 to 45 mins before cooking.  Preheat oven to 400 and bake the packets for 35 to 45 min depending on your oven on a cookie sheet just in case packets leak.  

Take out and unwrap to let cool and serve.  Put any leftover or make more to set on the table for those who want to add more to their chop.

I made just as is except I put them wrapped in tin foil on a cookie sheet and glad I did. Would’ve burned my house down. One step that definitely should not have been omitted.

Since the recipe didn’t specify, I used bone in chops per the photo. 35 minutes was too long making the chops tough. I would have preferred more lemon flavor - the pepper was overwhelming drowning out everything else including my side dishes.

Left out the butter and worcestershire sauce, but doubled the olive oil.  Absolutely love them.

This recipe was easy and pretty tasty.  I took some other reviewers advice and  just lightly coated a glass pan and both sides of my boneless pork loin chops with olive oil.  I then drizzled 2 tablespoons of melted butter mixed with 2 teaspoons  of Worcestershire sauce over all (5 - 1/2 inch chops).  I then sprinkled both sides with lemon-pepper- salt/seasoning, covered pan with foil and baked at 400F for about 20-30 min.  The chops were "swimming" in plenty of liquid by the end, may reduce butter/oil even more next time.  I rated this 4 stars for  ease  of recipe and because my whole family, including picky eaters, liked them.

I'll definitely make it again. But next time, I will add some cumin to the dry rub and marinate overnight . And I would bake for 30 minutes instead. It was slightly dry.

I've made this twice now and it turned out perfectly both times. The only change I made was adding a couple crushed cloves of garlic to the packets. The lemon will turn the garlic a bit green, but it really enhances the flavour.

I did put the chops in a glass dish, instead of wrapping them in foil, but followed all the ingredients to a "T"_ juicy, scrumptious pork chops!!

These are definitely not the "shoe leather" pork chops of our youth.  Tender and delicious.  DO NOT put the foil packets onto the oven rack directly, instead use a rimmed baking sheet or baking dish, to avoid a visit from the Fire Department!

I love this recipe.  However, like some other reviewers said, YES make sure to put the foil in a baking dish so the oil stays in the dish.  Also, I have cut the butter/oil by half before and it still works fine.

Great Recipe, made a change, it wasn't practical to individually wrap each pork chop, so I lined a glass pan with tin foil, overlapping the sides, made the recipe and covered with tin foil, let it marinate for a few hours, then cooked as called for.

The worchester sauce was intended to make the chops darker and in this case it didn't but there is nothing wrong with the taste and the presentation is not just about the color of the chop.

Highly recommend!

I'm going to try this recipe as per the directions someday. I didn't have the worcestershire sauce so I used soy sauce, I also threw a garlic clove in there. It was yummy and moist and had good flavor. The only thing I'd change is to use a little less of the lemon salt. It was pretty salty. I would make this again and I plan to...the right way next time. ;)

HUGE disappointment. I was looking for a last minute entree and thought I had found it because of the ingredients listed. I did not have time to read reviews and how others had tweaked the recipe. Followed the recipe exactly and ended up with grease leaking out of the foil and very plain tasting chops. The only seasoning we could detect was the lemon pepper so I am not sure why Worcestershire sauce was included. With all of the recipes available, I will not be trying this one again.

Not sure what went wrong. I followed the recipe exactly. The chops turned out boring and tough. Perhaps I should have followed the advice of other raters to tenderize the chops or to marinate them. The taste was okay, but nothing to rave about.

these were actually very good I did follow some of the suggestions from other users I am only giving 4 stars because I thought they were not quite tender enough but still very good.I hardly ever rate any recipes going to try to do it more often. overall they are very good and I will be attempting it again very soon.

I followed recipe to a tee- and although they were tasty, they werent as tender as I would have liked.  Too much oil I thought.  I also used thin cut pork chop which probable made all the difference.  I might try it again with thick cut chops and less oil.  I also used half the amount of butter.

followed recipe exactly.  it was very easy, definitely no frill cooking,  but the meat came out very tough and not worth the extra calories i had to add with using the butter.  Try the grilled lemon herb pork chops on here..still my favorite!

This recipe is very good! My fiance and I really enjoyed it. The reason I only gave it 4 stars though is because it tasted very similar to chops that I cook regularly. The seasoning was very good, the only thing I added was salt and pepper and minced garlic on the top. Next time I will add slices of onion for that litte bit of extra flavor.

This was incredibly easy and delicious.  My only comment is that if you don't wrap them well enough in foil, they will leak all over your oven.  I double wrapped mine and the oil and butter still boiled out.  I recommend putting them on a broiling pan.

Very easy.  I did add garlic powder as others had suggested.  I do suggest putting them on a sided cookie sheet as the packets did leak.  Will definitely prepare again.

I cooked this last night and it came out great.  Very simple and easy, I added some Tony Chachere's seasoning to them for a little extra zest as well.  Definitely take heed of the use of a dish under the chops though, they do tend to leak.

These were okay- they were pretty pale and lacked flavor.  I had to cook them 15 minutes longer as well, and they were not that tender.

This was not a success. I don't know, maybe I just don't like lemon pepper, but I really disliked the flavor of this. My fiancee didn't mind it, he ate his chop, but said I'd made better before. Even if the flavor had been okay, the chops were extremely tough. Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

I really like lemon pepper, so I really liked the flavor on these chops.  I added some chopped garlic in the packets. It did turn out a little drier than I wanted, even my 6 year old mentioned that they were dry.  I think the temp should be lowered or cooked for less time to make them perfect. I poured the extra juice that was in the packets into my mashed potatoes.

This was just OK.  My chops came out dry but it could be because my oven's not working correctly and cooked them at 450 instead of 400.  I'll reseve judgement until next time....

Simple, but GREAT! The way to cook a pork chop is to keep it wrapped to hold the moisture in. It was very tasty & moist. My kids actually loved it. My young son asked for seconds!

This was very good.  I just prepared tonight with corn and mashed potatoes.  My husband liked it alot.  It was not too peppery at all and very tender.  The slight variation that I made was a mixed 2 tbsp of soy sauce and 2 tbsp of worchestshire sauce and it was really good.  I will try again.  Thanx

I thought it was very good.  I had the problem with the oil leaking out of the tin foil as well, but I thought the taste was delicious.  Didn't have any lemon pepper, so I just marinated the pork chops in lemon juice for a few hours and then rubbed freshly ground black pepper on them.  Very good recipe.

This was okay... I cooked it exactly as stated -- but the oil boiled out of the packets all over the bottom of my oven and stunk up the entire house.  They were rolled tightly and sealed.  I'd recommend putting them in a baking dish just in case this happens to you.  It was okay, nothing phenomenal but easy enough.

Considering I am not a pork chop lover, but like to add variety to my diet, this wasn't too bad.  I did cut back on all that butter and oil though, I thought that much was a little unnecessary.

All in all a good recipe, I would reccomend using about half the butter as it calls for... and put them in a baking dish also to catch leakage.

I added garlic to the mixture for some more flavor as some of the reviews complained that the taste was too bland.  I think it's important for the chops to sit for about 5-10 minutes after removing them from the oven in order to make them tender.  My first chop was kind of tough, but the second one was quite tender after sitting in the foil longer.  I'm not sure that I'd make this dish again because of the smoky, greasy mess it left in my oven.  I think way too much liquid is called for if you're only using 4 chops as the recipe indicates.

This is an easy recipe that my family enjoyed.  I didn't use a lot of lemon pepper, but seasoned both sides of the chops with onion salt for extra flavor.  The meat was not as tender as I expected, so next time I will bake them at 350 degrees to see what that does for it.  Also, there was enough extra juice from the packets to mix in with the vegetables I served.  Very yummy.

My husband loved this recipe.  He said it was nice to have something different done with pork chops.

This recipe was a little too tangy.  My husband didn't really like them.  I thought they were okay.  If I make them again, I'll probably make some adjustments.

This is a great, easy recipe. They were very tender and a bit spicy. I froze the leftover juices for later use since the flavor was so good.

This needed something.  IT was pretty bland.  I probably won't make it again.

This was really tasty, and the pork chops turned out soooo moist and tender!  If you have someone in your house who doesn't really like lemon, I think it would be tasty with other spices or garlic as well.  Next time, I think we'll try them out on the grill!

The pork chops were a bit on the dry side, and I added a touch of garlic to each one. The kids did enjoy them.

The pork chops were very tender!! But, the taste was very bland.  I don't know what could be added to the recipe to make it better.
