HELPFUL TIPS FOR SHAPING: 1st, know they make 39 using a med. cookie scoop (2t), so you'd need 78 candy corns! 2nd, very important to use room temp butter because this is a dry recipe and you need it to mix smoothly. 3rd. To be honest, I used my hand with disposable plastic glove and felt this was best w/this dough. Then I added eggs. As long as the dry ingred. are mixed well, you really don't have to worry about it being that playdough consistency it should be. When you roll into balls, it will turn into smooth perfect balls. 4th, I only fit 6 at a time on the cookie sheet. 5th, Dip tops with sugar then use a glass cup to flatten dough. Then use hand to continue to flatten it to about 1/4-1/2" consistency. 5th, for whiskers, use a toothpick (ran through then rolled toothpick a tad before pulling out). 6th, I used a 1/3C measuring cup to flatten these. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, do not give the ears any "width" when you pinch to make them. I made mine very thin (basically pinched as thin as I can make it) because they spread to the perfect width). It's best to bake just a couple to see how they turn out, and then you're set with the rest! Oh, and 8 min was perfect. Anything more would have cracked them making hard to put candy in and I recommend putting them in AFTER you bake. EDIT: DON'T be scare by reviewers who said cookie was a 3. It IS a 3, but 3 tastes good not bad!! Just wouldn't win a cookie contest BUT would be something you'd serve ANYONE and IS good (fudgey)!! Oh & I us

Great recipe!  The cookie is very moist and chocolaty, and the dough rolls out very easily!  I used a biscuit cutter for these, which is the best thing to use if you have one; otherwise a glass works fairly well.  One tip to anyone planning to make these:  Bake each tray for about 4-5 minutes, then take them out, quickly put the candies on them and return them to the oven to finish baking.  If you wait to put the candies on when they come out the oven, you will end up with cracked, messy cookies!  I know this because I did it, and my first tray became the "rejects" that stayed home- the rest went to my son's school and were a big hit!

Because of previous reviews stating the flavor was lacking or not chocolate enough, I added 1 oz melted semisweet chocolate, and they came out perfectly! Dough is a dream to work with when forming the ears - no problem with its being too sticky. These come out soft and yummy, with a full chocolate flavor. I followed Muffinmom's advice to par-bake, remove and decorate, then finish for another 5 minutes. Could not have turned out better! And when Halloween's over, these are excellent cookies all on their own. They're not just another pretty face! No rolling out and cutting. Just scoop, flatten with the glass dipped in sugar, and bake. (It's best to use an actual scoop or "disher" if you're aiming for uniformity.) A buttery, tender chocolate fix any time of the year. Thank you for the great recipe!

These cookies turn out absolutely adorable. I made them for a first grade class party and they were a hit. I did not use butter. I used margarine and just refrigerated the dough an hour or two before forming the cats with no problems. I rolled the dough into a ball in my hand then smashed the dough with my hands instead of the glass, then layed the cookie on the cookie sheet to pinch and form the ears.The dough looks like chocolate mousse and tastes like icing. After the cookie is baked it tastes a like chocolate cake but in the form and consistency of cookie. I did not use the popsicle sticks because I didnt have any and they were just as cute. I also used M&Ms for the nose instead of red hots, and used a pink YoGo for the mouth. Will definetly make this recipe again.

This cookie was good and fun to make with the kids, but i didnt think it had that good chocolate taste that i was looking for. It seemed a little bland. If you want a really chocolatey cut out cookie try  the Best Ever Chocolate Cut out cookie recipe from this site.

I thought this recipe was fantastic! I'm a huge fan of anything chocolate, plus I loved making the cookie into a work of art! The only thing I did differently was instead of using candy corn and red hots I used reeses pieces for the eyes and nose. I love that peanutbutter and chocolate combo. I just cut the pieces in half and inserted them cut side down into the dough before baking. That way the eyes still have that slanted look. But that is just a personal preference! Thanks for this fun recipe!

With regard to flavor, these are perfect for small children  or adults who don't like a real cocoa hit in their cookies.

Doubled recipe with no problem. Dough texture was similar to play-dough.  Made sure to chill for an hour so it was easy to handle, and in between batches the dough went back into the refrigerator. 

Took advice of another user and baked for 7 minutes, removed from oven, decorated (quickly!) and placed in oven to bake for another 2 minutes. 

With the leftover dough, I just rolled it into cookie-sized balls and put them in a bag in the freezer.  When it's Christmas, I'll thaw, flatten and decorate like tree ornaments! 

I'm an American living in the United Kingdom and we don't have candy corn here, so I had it shipped over from America.  It really was worth it as it gives the cats spooky Halloween eyes.

Fantastic recipe which got rave reviews from 40 first-grade children and their teachers!

These are easy and absolutely adorable.  Other reviewers are correct that the cookies are not a “five”, but they are still quite good.  Definitely better than the traditional Halloween cookies with 2 inches of sugary frosting on top that I’ve made with my kids in the past.  I added some melted semisweet chocolate to the batter (as suggested by another reviewer) to increase the chocolate flavor.  I also added the candy after 8 minutes to avoid the cracking cookie problem.  Finally, I lined the cookie sheets with Reynolds parchment paper, which in my opinion really helps with even baking and helps stop cracking.  These will be a Halloween tradition in our house from now on!

The cookie itself is good, but don't smash it down too much.  I like this cookie a little thick, so smash it til it's about 1/4 inch thick.  If you smash it thinner then you get a crunchy cookie, I like it softer.  It is very yummy. Thanks.

Oh my gosh! I've never had so many compliments about a cookie! This recipe is wonderful, easy to make, and tastes better than any store bought cookie. I'm going to try this recipe with chocolate chips for extra chocolatey goodness.

A Very easy and yummy cookie! These took no time at all and were delicious.  The batter is thick and I agree with the other reviewer kind of mousse like or fudgey. The cookies are more cake-like which for me was a bonus.  I shaped them with the bottom of a glass and found it made perfect little "faces" because the edges curled up slightly.  I too used M&M's for eyes and red hots for noses (couldn't find candy corn at the store) Just adorable and again, so easy.

Great recipe so cute and so fun! I followed the directions and everything went really well. I used mini m&m's for the nose, this recipe made 30 good sized cookies. The taste was great, almost a brownie/cookie taste. I baked for 5 minuted then took them out put my candy pieces on and baked for an additional 5 minutes allowing them to cool for 1 minute on the cookie sheet before placing them on the cooling rack. I also sprinkled them with a little extra sugar, It really made the whiskers stand out. Great recipe it really got my family in the Halloween spirit, we will be adding this to our Halloween traditions;-)

These turned out SUPER cute! My kids loved them. They were really pretty easy to make and made a lot more than I thought- about 40 good sized cookies. The batter is pretty dry- requires a lot of work-only complaint!

Wonderful cookies for kids, and they taste good too!  We didn't put on sticks, and found using a fork not working well for whiskers.  Made the whiskers with the edge of a butter knife.  Pull out after about 5 minutes and put the eyes on - but don't bake too long or the eyes will melt.  Refer to the photo showing this.

I've made these cookies for several years.  While they take a bit of time to make, they aren't difficult and they taste fantastic.  I make the recipe as written and there's plenty of chocolate flavor.  Also, these can easily be made into owls.  Just put the ears closer to the center of top of the head and use M&M's turned on their side for the eyes and a candy corn for the nose.  Delish and super cute!!

It was a bit of work and slightly time consuming but I loved the results. I added the candy corns and red hots half way through the baking process. The cats looked really cute and they tasted great.

So Cute and delicious too!  Big hit at my son's Pre-K Halloween party.  I baked them on extra large kabob sticks and stuck them in a pumpkin...the kids swarmed around the pumpkin as soon as they announced it was time for dessert!

I liked this, but it was a little bit annoying that you had to refrigerate them throughout the whole process in order for them to keep their shape.  Took a lot of trial and error to stop it from losing the cat shape.  Maybe less butter next time.

This recipe was great! I made these with my two sons, ages 5 and 8. They had lots of fun making the little cat faces and the cookies were soft and chocolatey. This recipe is perfect as a family project and I will definitely be bringing them to the boys' school next year!

Okay, for a fussy, detail oriented recipe (no offense, but there are a lot of steps in this recipe to get them cute!), the directions are easy to follow and the cookies are decent tasting.  I actually made the entire recipe of these--a rarity for me in recipes like this where you have to do several steps for each individual pieces.  I stopped putting in the craft sticks about 3/4 of the way through--not because of I was tired of doing it, but because I was running out of places on my cooling rack to place the cookies.  It's much less difficult to place them on the rack without the sticks in them!  I made these for my coworkers kids and I think they will get a kick out of them.  I, too, parbaked these to 5-6 minutes then added the candy and baked another 5 minutes.  Be careful, though, and watch them, as I overbaked the first batch (I did a total of 12 minutes on that first batch) and the candy corn melted.  5 min before candy and 5 min after candy seemed to work perfectly in my oven until the last batch--not as many cookies then, which made the cookies cook faster anyway.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made these cookies for two years now and have followed the recipe.  I'll be making them again this year (I'll get in trouble at work if I don't).  Dip your fork in sugar so it doesn't stick when you make the whiskers.

These are cute, tasty, and easy to make.  We used the tip from another reviewer to press a toothpick several times lengthwise to make the whiskers.  The photo shows leftover dough - frozen in balls, thawed, and pressed to about half inch thick before baking.  Attractive and yummy.

I've had this recipe in my home files for quite a few years but hadn't used it in a while.  I was pleased to see it here and decided to try it out once again.  After reading some of the reviews, here are a few tips that have been helpful to me when making these delightful cookies.  The recipe, as printed here, does say that it serves 12.  If you read further, the ingredients (48 candy corn pieces, 24 popscicle sticks, 24 red hot candies) indicate that the yield will be 24 cookies.  I have found that the dough does not need to be chilled.  It is, as one reviewer notes, playdough like in consistency and very workable.  If you have a 1/8 C measuring cup, it is the perfect size to measure out each dough ball.  I fashion the cats as described in the recipe directly on parchment lined cookie sheets.  I have always placed the candy decorations on each cookie after baking and never had a bit of trouble.  Just be sure not to overbake the cookies and to decorate them immediately when removing the trays from the oven.  One more thing;  I seem to have better luck creating the cat shape I like, by inserting the popsicle stick into the dough after, not before, flattening with a glass.  As to the taste of the cookie, they do, as many reviewers have already noted, have a wonderful fudgy, brownie-like flavor.  You can make these any time, not just at Halloween.  Just roll into balls and flatten.

These cat cookies taste just like a brownie and were simple to make.  I thought they would be a pain, so I decided to roll and cut them out with a cookie cutter, but then I tried a few on my own and it was much easier that way.  They turned out so cute!  Definitely par bake and then add the candy corn/red hots at about the last 2-3 minutes.

These are the cutest cookies.  I took them into my daughter's school.  The kids loved them.  They are easy and they are very tasty.  My kids helped make them too.  M&Ms are tastier for a nose, but the cinnamon looks better.

These were very cute made but a pain to shape.  I made the recipe exactly as written but it was very dry and kept crumbling.  I kept having to press it all back together.  I was so frustrated I ended up tossing about half of it.  I may try it again with a bit more moisture (maybe a 3rd egg).  It tasted good when cooked, just hard to get it shaped.

Absolutely scrumptious.  I had to put them in the freezer to keep my family out of them!  I followed the tip of other reviewers and added the candies 8 minutes into baking, then put back in the oven for the final minutes.  They turned out perfect.  Next year I plan to make these again, only into an owl shape.

So fun and surprisingly tasty. I made these last year without the sticks so no one would get hurt and everyone has asked that I make them again. Kids and adults love these cookies and you don't have to be an expert to make them look nice.

this is a super-easy recipe. my four year old daughter helped me make it, she loved pressing the cookies down, making the whiskers and adding the eyes & nose. we followed the recipe exactly & thought it was delicious. we used someone's suggestion, baked them for 8 minutes and added the eyes & nose. fantastic!!!

These were a huge hit!!! They were really delish too! I would just make sure that you bake them long enough to make sure they stay hard....The first batch I baked 7 minutes and they were nice and fudgey but they cracked and crumbled easily. I then baked them for 8 minutes, put the candy in and then baked for another 2 minutes.  This way turned out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

My son and I made these yesterday. We initally followed all directions and the ears disappeared while baking, the candy decorations melted, etc. The first batch was trash.   After that one, we followed the recommendations of baking first for a bit, then adding the candy decorations. That worked much better, though it made it harder for my 4 year old to make the cookies with me since we were worried about him being burned. Overall, these were ok, but we were bummed that because the orginial baking directions didn't work we couldn't make them with the kids.

These cookies were good and cute! I found it hard to make the ears so after my first batch didn't turn out, I skipped the ears. I also did not make the cookies on a stick; I stuck with the more traditional style. The cookies were cakier than expected but still a hit. I used M&M's instead of red hots just because it's a personal preference and I put the 'nose' on before baking. This made it faster to put the eyes on... you have to do it quickly before the cookie cools too much.

I give this 5 * for the cuteness factor, but wasn't at all impressed with the taste of the cookies.  I agree they seemed bland.  They tasted like chocolate, no doubt, just had no "interest" to them, if you will (I do, however, freely admit to being a cookie snob LOL).  I followed the recipe exactly and had no issues with stickiness...actually seemed a little dry to me...so I didn't refrigerate at all.  I made 44 3" diameter cookies...didn't use popsicle sticks.  I baked 8 minutes, popped on the candies, and then baked for another 2-3 minutes.  It was a fun little project with my kiddos though.  Thanks for the idea!

Edited: I made these a second time and with the following changes they were great.  I added about an ounce or so of melted chocolate chips, about 3 T of water and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  This made a nice, soft, tasty cookie.  It made them a tad sticky for shaping, but the sugar on the glass took care of that.  Overall, much tastier!

Made these for my daughter's class for Halloween.  This is some awesome tasting chocolate dough!!  I will defiantly be using this recipe for all my chocolate rolled cookies!  I had no problems with the cookie spreading - however, I did have problems with the corns spreading at first.  Then I baked them without the corns for the first 5 minutes, took them out and pressed the corn into the dough, then baked another 5 minutes and let cool on the pan for a couple of minutes.  They were perfect.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!!

These cookies were easy to make, my girls had a great time helping to make them, too! We made the balls too small so they looked more like owls than cats, but that was fine! I thought they were tasty too, although I did feel like there could've been a little more flavor. I couldn't find red hot candies, so I used a little dab of orange frosting for the noses after they were cooled. A very fun cookie for the little ones for Halloween!

I love this! My friends and I have a thing for cats and I figured it would be the perfect thing to bring to our Halloween party tomorrow -- our twelfth year of dressing up and handing out candy! I am SURE these will be a hit. I followed the instructions as written, but added shaved Cadbury milk chocolate to the dough before shaping. I like how they harden outside but keep a chewy consistency. I didn't have popsicle sticks, so I used barbecue sticks and they still held up perfectly. I also used pink droplets/chips for the noses. I'm so happy with how they came out! Thanks!

Cute idea.  The cookies quickly got hard.  Was hoping for something that would stay chewy and soft.  Not much on flavor.  Made these for my daughter's Halloween party and many got sent back home as they did not get eaten.

These cookies were not the best cookies, but my kids loved making these.  They did not hold well on the sticks.  But I am giving 5 for taste and fun factor.  If you have kids they will love this cookie.  Thanks.

I think this cookie gets 5 stars for taste and cuteness.  I give it 3 stars for difficulty.  I found them to be too time consuming and troublesome.  I don't agree with the other reviewers that the cookies weren't chocolaty enough.  They tasted like fudgy brownies to me.  I also used M&Ms for the nose.  My preschoolers loved them and I did too.  I will make these again, but maybe only once a year since they were kinda hard to make.

After reading the reviews I decided add the candy corn before they were done baking and then return them to the oven. It was a mess they bubbled and melted which makes sense. The rest I added the candy corn eyes after they were through and it worked out great. I used M&M's for the noses and made 4-6 whiskers on each side (8 was over kill) I also used the side of the fork and made them individually and they turned out much better. They taste was great sorta like a brownie cookie. After trial and with the baking time I came to 7-8 minutes in the oven, my only complaint is they were a little to hard when they cooled. This however didn't stop the kids at school from digging in, neat idea.

I thought this recipe was really good and really easy to make.  However, the recipe said it makes 12 cookies.  I started making them bigger because I thought the ones I made were going to be too small.  The smaller ones were much nicer and the recipe will actually make about 24.  They tasted good.  I know some of the reviews said they weren't chocolatey enough but I thought they were fine.  My three year old loved them.

These were very easy to make. The cookie dough was easy to work with. Taste was nice, sort of a milder chocolate taste...next time I'll add more chocolate.

These were so easy to make and so much fun to serve.  Even my husband helped me in the kitchen because of the ease of the preparation.  They were not super chocolately or too sweet.  They looked wonderful at my niece's Halloween birthday party and everyone commented on how festive they were for the occasion.  I noticed how the kids at the party really enjoyed eating them!  The only change I might make next time is that instead of using red hots for the nose, I will use red M&Ms.  This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

These cookies are so cute!  I didn't use the popsicle sticks, but everyone who saw them thought they were great.  They were not difficult at all - I made them about an hour before I left to a Halloween treat exchange.

Five stars for the "cute" factor and Four stars for the actual cookies overall taste.  This is a good cookie.  I rolled the dough into balls and then chilled in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.  You won't be able to flatten and shape them if the dough is warm.  Make sure you make the "whiskers" pretty deeply with the fork or they will disappear when baking.  Big hit with the kids.

Good flavor, but the dough was very sticky and hard to work with. I even chilled the dough, and it was still hard to shape. Very "cakey" cookie.

These are sooo cute as a decoration but the taste is not good.  They aren't sweet enough, very bland, next time I will add more sugar and see if that helps.  I will make them again because they are soo darn cute, but with some modifications, as the recipe stands it's a 3.

I'm giving this a 5 because the cookie was very good, tasted like chocolate cake. However I thought the whole process was tiresome! If you leave the candycorn in the oven too long they explode! It was good enough to make again

I give this between a 3 and 4. They are cute and taste alright, but I think they were just more trouble than they were worth. I followed the recipe exactly and the dough was pretty hard to shape. It was also very crumbly.

These are really cute.  I think these are very fudgy.  I did prebake about 4 minutes and then added the candy and baked an additional 4 minutes.

wonderful,although I used a toothpick to add the whisker prints instead of a fork;also when pinching the ears? dip your fingers in sugar 1st,so they dont stick to the dough.

I substituted pre-made brownie mix to save on time and just decorated them the same way.  Very tasty and cute.  If I try again, I think I'll mix cocoa and/or flour into the dough to make it a little less gooey, but otherwise, a great Halloween treat!

I am giving thesea five because they are very cute, quite easy, and pretty darn good.  I did make some changes though, because I realized while making the recipe that I was short on some ingredients.
I used 1/2 c cocoa powder and 1/2 c melted 60% cocoa chips (I ran out of the cocoa powder).  I added the melted chocolate to the sugar/egg/butter mix.  I chilled the batter for about 10 minutes before shaping into balls.  Finally, I used chocolate chips for eyes and nose, as my kids don't like candy corn or red hots.  They were  so easy and cute and quite easy to alter.

Excellent recipe!  Use Dutch Process Cocoa and you will LOVE the flavor.  These are both tasty and adorable.  Great for sending to school with the kids for Halloween!  Thanks for the recipe.  We will definitely make them again!

These were so great!! They really did stay on the sticks, no matter how big I made them. They were really cute, too. My brothers couldn't help themselves and were eating one after the other. 
I also brought some to a couple of friends and they thought they were great!! :D
The whole thing was quite easy, whew!!! I did sub the nose for mini M&M's instead. You got to make sure they are in there. Or they will fall off and squish if you try to put it back on. Anyways..This recipe is AWESOME and I would love to make it again!! THANKS.

These were really easy to make. It took no time at all to make them. And my kids love them too. They don't like the red hot "noses" but thats ok they just don't eat the candies.

These cookies are fun and easy to make with anyone over 5 years old. They are not as time consuming as they look. My son loves them and is bringing them to class on Halloween. Enjoy.
