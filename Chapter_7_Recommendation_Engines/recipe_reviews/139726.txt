I did this is in the oven instead of the microwave method. We didn't use sour cream and I added a couple of tablespoons of taco seasoning to the meat when cooking it. Turned out great.

I have been making this for years to raves from my guests!  My sister got the recipe out of the newspaper and thought it was good enough to send to me.  She was right!  I cook it in the oven as I prefer not to use the microwave.

I grew up on this recipes, it is one of my favorites.  The only thing I do differently is I mix the sour cream and green onions together with a can of sliced black olives (drained) and spoon on top after shells are done cooking then I sprinkle the Monterey jack cheese on top and microwave for another 2 minutes or until cheese is melted.

This recipe was a life-saver! Who says you can't have a home-cooked delicious meal when your oven goes on the fritz and your stuck with just a microwave & one working stove top eye? Not me or my boyfriend :) Great time saver if your needing dinner fast, with minimal clean-up.

The manicotti were a bit under cooked and the filling came out a bit dry from the refried beans so next time I will add some sauce to the filling mixture and bake in the oven.

My mom made this for me as a kid and now I make it for my family. We bake it in the oven at 350 for an hour. I don't precook the meat. It cooks up perfect in the noodles. I also add half a pack of taco seasoning to meat and the other half to salsa mixture. I melt the cheese after I add it. One of my family's favorites!

I have made this recipe for years the only difference is I put the filling in a Ziploc freezer bag cut off the tip and I pipe it into  the shells makes it go a lot faster and easier!

This was good, different.  I had to combine ground beef and pork to have make enough.  I also threw it into food processor with beans after cooking, added the seasonings and processed it to a smoother consistency for cooking.  I added the stated seasonings amount and thought it a little under seasoned.  I'd double it for personal taste next time.  I'm going to try it with a queso sauce also.  It was good, but needs tweaking to work for our family.  Thanks for the base recipe, I never would have combined the ingredients without this recipe.
