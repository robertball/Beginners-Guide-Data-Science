Very good, but I did add to it which I think made it better. I used a yellow cake mix made following the directions on the box and added 1 tsp lemon extract, did the poke and pudding thing after taking it out of the oven, but with the remaining pudding I mixed half a container of cool whip in and used that to frost the cake. It was great.

I made this for the people in my office and it is awesome! Everyone raved over how good it was. I am a huge texture person so I only used about half of the half of bowl of pudding to top the cake. The cake was moist and not soggy, and the lemon pudding is great as icing.

As written this recipe is a 5 star recipe. It is super easy and soo good.I was confused with the directions for a minute, the directions should say substitute cake box ingredients with these ingredients but mix it together following the box directions. Makes you pause for a second, but no big deal.   Make sure you poke your holes big enough (I used a straw and felt the holes were too small) and very soon after the cake is out of the oven, don't wait. I added half the pudding pushing most of it down in the holes and left a light layer on top, then I mixed the rest of the pudding up with some whipped cream and topped it with that. (My only alteration and done the seond time, hte first time I made the cake I followed directions to the T, both are good, whipped cream adds more lightness to the cake).    The result was a fantastic light, airy, wonderful lemon cake.   I will try this with a white cake and chocolate pudding, chocolate cake with chocolate pudding, strawberry cake with vanilla pudding, the possiblities are endless and all sound good.

Very, very good.  I started thinking of the different flavors for this cake.  For the chocolate lovers out there.  Chocolate cake with chocolate pudding and coolwhip frosting?  Just think of the possibilities.  mmmmmmmm

Fast, easy and delicious recipe. Very light and refreshing end to our meal on this 95 degree day. Followed the recipe with the exception of folding 1/2 container of Cool Whip and 1 tsp of lemon extract into the top layer of pudding and garnished with fresh blackberries. We will make this again. Thanks for sharing!

We loved this cake and so did our neighbors.  It was so moist and delicious.  I followed the directions to the "T" and it turned out great.  I wouldn't change a thing.  It's perfect for a bbq on a hot summer day!

I wish I could rate this recipe better but there were a few flaws in it.  First off, the recipe states the ingredients you need to make the cake, but in the instructions it says to prepare and bake the cake as directed on the box.  Well the two aren't the same so that can make it confusing.  Secondly, 2 pkg. pudding is WAY to much.  I had to scrap some off the top. Thirdly, the recipe says to add the 1/2 the pudding to the cake immediately after taking it out of the oven.  Doing so makes the cake slightly mushy.  To avoid this slightly cool the cake first.  And lastly, the cake needs to be refrigerated so you end up with cold cake.  This may not be a problem for you, but I don't like my cake ice-cold.  I won't be making this again.

this is an awesome recipe. Very versatile and can use any combination of cake mixes and pudding. I prefer the cooked puuding over instant and use a pastry bag with an eclair filler tip to put the pudding into the cake...very easy that way. mmmmm  Tonight we had yellow cake with banana pudding with cool whip mixed into one third of the cooled pudding for the frosting. Thanks for the great ideas here

The possibilities are endless! I've used yellow cake mix (any brand will do!), poke the holes, then pour on orange jello made with about two-thirds the required water, cool, cover with vanilla pudding, then add mandarin oranges, then cover the whole thing with Cool Whip. You can use strawberries with strawberry jello, or peach, or a berry combination... Be creative! But the cake-jello-pudding-fruit-Cool Whip blend is hard to beat!

Extremely refreshing and tasty! The whole family loved it, even the non lemon fans! Added a tsp of lemon extract to the cake mix and used half a tub of cool whip on top. Yum!

I used about 3/4 of the batter from a box of French Vanilla cake mix (all I had on hand), and frosted with 1 pkg of lemon pudding mixed with about 2 cups of cool whip & 1/2 cup of sour cream. I turned the cake out onto my cake plate before poking & adding the pudding, then let it sit in the fridge while I beat the "frosting". Chilled the whole thing for two hours before adding candles! Beautiful & delicious!!! Thank you!

Most of the family really liked this cake, but I didn't care for the lemon pudding.  It tasted artificial to me, and I much prefer a homemade lemon curd.  Overall, this was a quick and easy dessert and nothing went to waste.

I've made this cake several times and you can use any flavor pudding or cake.  After layering the remaining pudding, I always top with cool whip.  Makes it more yummy.

I made the cake using the directions on the cake mix box, using the whole egg option (vs. egg whites), plus I added 1 tsp of lemon extract. The baked cake was high in the middle (maybe because of the whole eggs?), so I used a knife and cut it down so the top was fairly level and even across. I wanted to leave it in the Pyrex 9x13 dish I baked it in (vs. plating it and turning it upside down, though I guess I could have put it back in the baking dish after flipping it; oh well). I thought the pudding would cover up the cut area and it wouldn't be noticeable. The pudding was opaque and you could see the cut area through the pudding. So, I spread a layer of cool whip over the top, "icing" the cake, which hid the cut area. I refrigerated the cake overnight and took it to an office lunch the next day. Everyone really enjoyed it. I made a simple raspberry sauce served on the side as an optional topping and the tartness of the sauce went well with the sweetness of the cake. May make it again, or a variation using a different flavor mix, pudding, or both.

I made this for the recent July 4th celebration and got rave reviews from everyone.  It's moist and delicious, with just the right amount of lemon flavor without being too tart.  I used half a container Cool Whip to "ice" the top after it had chilled overnight.  Also, make SURE you cover it in the refrigerator, because it will dry out quickly.  I will make this again!

This cake was moist, light, and delicious!! Upon reading other reviews, I added 1 tsp lemon extract to the cake batter. I spread 1/2 the lemon pudding on the hot cake. Then mixed the rest of pudding with 2 nice-sized dallops of lite CoolWhip. Spread that mixture on top of cooled cake. Then, i drizzled some thickened blackberry pulp over it all. We all loved it!!

I have made many versions of Poke Cake. The ones made with pudding are not the same as the ones with Jello, but all are excellent. Unlike many reviewers I am not fond of artificial whipped topping but prefer to mix the remaining pudding with 3 or 4 ounces of cream cheese... creamy, rich and fabulous! (Soften and whip the cream cheese before mixing in the pudding.)

I made several changes to the recipe; first I used a lemon cake mix, I followed the box direction with the addition of fresh lemon zest and and extra egg added. I Baked the cake and set aside to cool. I used 2 packages of stove top cook lemon pudding and added lemon zest and a couple squeezes of the lemon juice to the pudding mix as it cooked. Then used the end of a large wooden spoon to poke my holes in the cake (lots of them) then poured the warm pudding mix on the top of the cooled cake. I tapped the cake a couple times as I covered it with the pudding to make sure all the wholes where filled. Put the cake in the fridge to setup and just before I severed it I frosted the cake with whipped topping. I added a fresh raspberry and small fresh mint leaf to the top of each slice. Rave reviews from all!

Easy to make but definitely bland.  This needs more lemony taste so a little extract might help, in the pudding.  Texture was decent but, all-in-all, just a mediocre recipe.

Family loved the cake. Had intended to add lemon extract  into cake batter as others suggested, but I forgot until the cake was baking.  Wasn't pleased with tools I had to put the holes in the cake.  I am ordering a cupcake corer for future poke cakes and filled cupcakes.  Added about 1/2 container of Cool Whip into remaining pudding for the "icing".  Also, I used sugar free yellow cake mix and pudding.  Keeping cake refrigerated.   Look forward to making other flavor combinations in the future.

Very light and tasty! I made this according to the recipe except I grated a little lemon zest over the pudding "frosting" and served it with a little whipped cream on top.

Read reviews before making this cake! I wish I had.  It needs help. Pudding tastes artificial (instant), poke with wooden spoon handle (straw too small), definitely needs a whipped topping, 2 packages of pudding is overkill.  Based on reviews, I may try again but would use lemon jello instead of pudding for glaze, add a layer of noninstant lemon pudding, top with cool whip. Sorry......

True review.  Made exactly as recipe stated.
Very easy recipe to follow and make. 
Thought 2 packs of pudding was too much.  
Lemon flavor was very faint and not tangy at all.
If you are a lemon lover this will be sure to dissapoint.
This recipe definitely needs some help.
Would not recommend or make this again.

I love recipes with lemon, and this one was pretty good. I made a few changes, however, using a lemon cake mix and only 1 lemon pudding packets- not 2. Then topped with cool whip.

Because there are only two of us and we can't eat a 9 x 13 cake before it gets stale, I make this with a lemon poppy seed muffin mix. Instead of using a 9 x 13 pan, I use a 8 x 8 square pan and halve the rest of the ingredients. I also fold Cool Whip into the rest of the pudding before topping the cake. Delicious and the perfect size for hubby and I!
