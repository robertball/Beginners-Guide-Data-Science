I was looking for a recipe for beet jelly and finally found one from my sister.  Instead of sugar in the recipe, I used 4 cups of Splenda (could be less), and I used a package of Raspberry JELL-O Light.

I wonder how the review from bailey could possibly be correct that says the green color is unappealing? Green with beet juice and raspberry drink mix as the main ingredients? I believe the sugar could/should be cut down, but be careful changing jelly recipes as too much change and they will not set properly.

Too sweet and the green color is not appealing.

I made this to yield one cup and subbed cherry mix because the store was out of raspberry.  Overall, it's a great idea to make jelly with beet juice, so I'll be trying this again, but it is way too sweet.  The color is to die for, though.  I'm going to eat this batch with crepes and cream cheese to cut the sweetness, and next time, I'll try honey or molasses and less sugar.
