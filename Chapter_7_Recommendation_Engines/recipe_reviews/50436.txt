Wow. Wow, wow, wow. My husband and I actually just finished these and he told me he just ate the best burger he's ever had, and he's had a lot of burgers! I'm so proud. I halved the recipe and the burgers were enormous. I didn't have fajita seasoning, so I used some Mexican chili powder, garlic powder and season salt. I also used fresh minced white onion instead of dry. I didn't measure the spices, but I was careful not to over season. Since I halved it, I used 1/8 cup A1 in the beef and then just a little more for basting at the end. I didn't have canned mushroom so I sauteed some fresh ones with garlic, butter, and onion. I did use the green chiles and they were fantastic. They were canned serranos, and I seeded them first because they were a bit too hot. I also used a bit of lightly beaten egg to help bind the meat, but still it was difficult getting the patties to stay together. I grilled them on higher heat to sort of give them some char and then I switched to a lower heat to ensure they were cooked through. Enjoy, these are great! Thanks to the poster!

Very good recipe---I only stuffed burgers with mushrooms and cheese.  I used shredded cheese instead of slices.  My guests really liked this recipe!

Yummy! I made this one night and I had absolutely no leftovers! They were so filling and delicious I was amazed. I even left out the fajita seasoning and it still tasted good. I put bacon in with the cheese. It was nummy. Defidently making again.

These were very good...and a buper hearty burger.   I made a half recipe, but I'm not sure about the fajita seasoning.  I think next time I may skip it all together.  I found that and the steak sauce to be a little much.  The chiles and mushrooms were exceptional.

Excellent.  I didn't have any cheese but blue cheese on hand and didn't want to go to the store, it was great.  The blue cheese just gave it more zing.  I have also done just as directions said and the whole family loves it...

These were very good, definitely a splurge on calories but worth it if you really want a treat!!  And by the way, the rating process is for people who actually try the recipe.  Don't bring down the overall rating by giving one star to a recipe that you just don't like the looks of. Anyway, I'd try these again- and I know my husband would!

I believe the fajita seasoning mixed with the bottle of steak sauce (A1) made it too salty.  Shredded cheese was easier for me.

I put the cheese slice between the two patties of meat.  I also used half as much mushroom and green chilis as otherwise I couldn't keep the meat together.  We liked them very much and will make again.  Since I used a Foreman grill I did not put cheese on top when the burger was done.

These sound really good, but they are kind of difficult to eat without a knife and fork handy. They can get pretty sloppy and hard to pick up successfully.  Finger-licking good, though!

This had a great flavor but was way too salty. I think that was the fajita seasoning. I used some frozen roasted Hatch green chiles instead of canned. I left the mushrooms off and this burger was stuffed really full as it was without them. It didn't trun very well though and the center cracked open after I turned them. Very filling though. Thanks for a great burger overall.

Made pretty much exactly to the recipe.  Did use fresh sauteed mushrooms rather than canned and white cheddar on top rather than American, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Thought they were good, and everyone else ate them up.  Thought there should be more green chile flavor, and I'm not sure I loved the steak sauce.  Might try it again with a BBQ sauce and more green chiles.

This was one of the best burgers I have made at home. It had lots of flavor, was easy to make, and my husband and I woke saying...."that was a good burger last night". I forgot the minced onion when mixing the meat, but sprinkled some on both sides before and while cooking, I didnt have fajita mix so I used taco mix, and it still turned out great. Thank you!!

Simply delicious!!   To make the burgers thin enough, I put the formed balls on sprayed waxed paper and rolled them thin.  I didn't have fajita seasoning so I used Taco mix instead. I used Cream of Mushroom soup instead of actual mushrooms and I put a dollop of the soup on the bottom burger before putting them together.  The grilled burgers fell apart pretty easily but, that's OK. They were great!!!

I don't like A1 so they were just ok.  The stuffed mushrooms and cheese were good.  I think if i was to do it again i would just put the stuffing ingredients on at the time i served.  A little labor intensive considering you could just add it at the end.

I made these for a group of six of us on a propane grill over medium heat. I used thick slices of Pepper Jack cheese in the middle along with the mushrooms and green chiles. I sprinkled Jamaican Jerk seasoning across the top of both sides of the patties as they cooked on the grill. Everyone raved about them and demanded the recipe before collapsing on the couch with the need for naps!

These were pretty good. They were a little too dry though, next time I will mix more sauce in with the meat.

Great recipe! I have never though of stuffing burger, but my whole family LOVED it! I made them for our Labor Day cookout. You could even switch up the ingredients--there are endless possibilities for this recipe. Thanks!

This recipe was wonderful... I tweaked it on my first try and it was perfect and I cooked it on the stove top instead of the grill. It came out juicy and flavorful. Onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, black pepper, crushed red, pepper, steak sauce and onion soup mix. Stuffed with banana peppers and mozzarella & cheddar cheese..

These were excellent-- a huge hit in our family! Thank you! Wouldn't change a thing and followed it to to T. I do have one bit of feedback though:  our hamburgers didn't stay sealed... next time I will add an egg to help with this problem. I noticed no one else had this problem on the reviews that I read... just wondering how you folks prevented the hamburger from becoming unsealed.

We thought it tasted great. Members of my family thought I could have cut down on the steak sauce.  It was hard to keep the edges bound together, the recipe could use a binding ingredient.

I made these with the "Stufz" burger press that you can get at Kitchen Stuff Plus. I filled the burgers with shredded cheddar, green chilies and small pieces of bacon that I cut. I didn't bother with the mushrooms and didn't baste with the steak sauce as I had already put steak sauce in the meat mixture. I then grilled them on the BBQ. These were really delicious burgers, my family said they were the best I'd made yet! Thanks for the recipe.

Skip fajita seasoning. Diced white onion instead of dried. Sautéed fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Cream cheese instead of slices. Seriously. Amazing.

Really good burger. They come out very moist and flavorful. I used meatloaf mix instead of ground beef and burrito seasoning instead of fajita seasoning because that's what I had on hand. I also used shredded colby jack cheese and omitted the peppers so my daughter could eat them too.I served them on onion rolls. We enjoyed these and will make again. Next time will try some other variations for fun. I think I would prefer fresh sauteed mushrooms instead of canned.
