This was really good. Very close in taste to a tamale.  I slow cooked the pork roast in a crockpot until tender, and used the juice from that for the cornmeal mix.  I do think I will make it without adding the corn next time.  Possibly serve corn as a side as I don't think it is needed for this recipe.  I also layered the recipe. Put the pork on the bottom and then poured the cornmeal mixture on top of it, topped with mexican cheese.

Hubby says this is definately "A Make Again" recipe! YUMmmmm!
About the only changes I made was: 1.) Added an extra egg, 1/2 c. more cornmeal & 1/4 c. more milk. 2.) I substituted 2 t. of 40% less sodium Taco seasoning for the spices, 3.) Used 1 can of lower sodium chicken broth, 4.) added a can of drained black olive slices (the little can) and 5.) Topped with shredded cheddar. 
VERY tasty! Will try again with beef chunks and another time with shredded chicken!

I enjoyed this recipe but I wasn't clear on some directions. Do you drain the corn or not? I think next time I will drain corn and reduce amount to 1 can since the corn added a certain amount of sweetness that I didn't care for. I also increased amount of chilli since we like our food hot. I also topped with cheddar cheese and baked till cheese melted. Overall, good recipe that I will make again.

This was absolutely delicious!  I had leftover pork roast so I didn't have the 2 cups of juice to simmer the pork in so I just used chicken broth.  It turned out wonderfully but I would recommend cutting back on the cayenne pepper if you don't like things too spicy.  I used diced tomatoes with jalepeno peppers since my family likes things really spicy.

You may want to cut back on the Cayenne and Chili Powder unless you are a huge fan.  Cook the pork a day or two ahead or you'll be cooking all day...

My boyfriend is Mexican, and he absolutely loved this recipe. He ate almost half of it himself. The only thing different I did was added a little more garlic and chili powder.  I served it with warm corn tortillas.

Excellent. I used left cooked pork roast, so I could skip the roasting of the cubed pork. It was really quick. Instead of chili powder and cayenne pepper I used 1 packet of Lawrey's Taco seasoning. I also used 4 large fresh diced tomato's instead of canned. Even my two little ones loved it and they do not care for most Mexican style food. Thank you!!

This recipe takes the cake.  It's a foolproof, quick, and a tasty filling meal.  But I did cheat a little on the meat by substituting sliced then fried Bratwurst.  I also kicked the spices up a notch with some Taco seasoning, and Frank's Red Hot.  Topped with some grated Cheedar & Mozzarella then a dollop of sour cream to chase the heat.

I really liked this recipe. It was easy enough to modify for my family. I wouldn't really say I changed it much. My pork was alredy previously roasted, I had to use frozen corn, and I plopped a little minced garlic in with the pork and chicken broth to simmer. Also used taco seasoning. I also added a small can of chopped green chilies when I mixed the pork and corn meal mixtues together. Also, I didn't use the juice from simmering the pork. I just put the pork in the mixture. Good recipe. my whole family loved it.

I made the roast in the crock pot overnight.  I used half a mexican beer (in place of the water) and added a pinch of cinnamon and a can of diced green chiles with the other spices.  In the morning I shredded the pork and put it in the fridge for later.  The casserole went together so fast that evening, I love that!  Yum, thanks for the recipe!

I added olives as suggested by some reviewers but I found it to be too strong and overpowered the mellow tamale taste.  I dont think I'll add it into the tamale next time.  I thought there was way too much pork so i will halve the amoutn of pork next time.  The meat did come out very juicy and I was happy with that.  I utilized the 18cm cristel pot to cook the meat and water in an oven until the meat was thoroughly cooked (I put the water in half way as the recipe stated).  The amout of the water left over from the pork for the tamale mixture was not enough, so I needed to add 2 cups more water before adding the pork water.  The texture came out fine since I listened to other reviewers but if I had followed the original directions then I think i would have a really dry dish.

Easy and tasty. Was a great way to use up some leftover pork from a roast. Since the pork wasn't cooked via this recipe, I added in some cumin, chopped jalapeno, garlic and other seasonings to make it more flavorful in the tamale realm. Topped it with cheese prior to baking for a crunchy topping. Served with rice and beans.

I made it and had to throw it away.  Sadly, I admit that I might have done it wrong, but the flavor wasn't great and it was a little dry.

This was good.  Since I'm used to tamales where the corn mixture is separate from the meat mixture, I layered the pork and tomatoes first, and then topped it with the corn mixture (from which I omitted the tomatoes).  Better would have been more varied spices in the pork and in the tomatoes as well.  Be sure to bake it covered so it doesn't dry out.

I'm in the process of making this dish right now.  I am kind of frustrated though, with the cornmeal mixture.  I don't know what consistency I'm supposed to be looking for as it cooks for 20 minutes on the stove top, and what constitutes "too dry?!"  I see that some other reviewers had the same question(s) as me.  I am hoping that I did not just ruin a whole lot of wonderful tasting left over pork by trying this recipe.  I took another reviewers advice and added 1/2 C more cornmeal and 1/4 C extra milk and 1 extra egg to the cornmeal mixture.  I've been tweaking the recipe as I go along here (adding salsa per another reviewers advice.) I'm just afraid to mix the pork with this weird cornmeal concoction, because I don't know what the cornmeal is going to do once I put this in the oven...not impressed so far!

I hate to be a party pooper here but this recipe was one of the most awful concoctions I have ever..well, concocted!  I did follow it exactly, and it turned out I suppose as it should...but honestly, it not only tasted awful it looked even worse. I had high hopes.  Maybe just not for us.

I LIVE ALONE SO I USED THE CALCULATOR FOR 2. UNLESS YOU ARE USE TO COOKING WITH CORN MEAL IT COULD BE A PROBLEM (NOT KNOWING   WHAT TO LOOK FOR AS THE MEAL COOKS). IT CAME OUT GREAT!  WE ALL ADD OUR OWN TOUCHES. BUT AS WITH ONE PERSONS IDEA I ADDED CHEESE TO THE TOP BEFORE BAKING.  THANKS OF THE TIP!

Very good. I used leftover crockpot pork roast, and mixed ingredients into the leftover gravy.  I also used salsa instead of the tomatoes- we like spicy!

This was fantastic. My family says it should be a staple meal of ours now! I slow-cooked my pork overnight (they were boneless pork chops), and I also used chicken broth like others recommended. YUM!

I was a bit disappointed by this, but I fear I may have misunderstood the directions.  It isn't clear how to use the broth.  After you simmer the pork, do you remove it from the broth, or put the entire thing into the cornmeal mixture?  I did, and it came out too wet.  Next time, I'll only use the broth to wet the cornmeal if it becomes too dry, but otherwise will remove the pork from the simmering broth before adding to the cornmeal mixture.  I should also say that I made this with chicken and chicken broth instead of cooking the pork, to both save time and effort.  I'll try again, but not terribly impressed with the first attempt.

Pretty good.  Probably would not make unless I had leftover pork roast from a previous meal.  Not fantastic, but good.

This recipe was ok. Not having cooked with pork very often, I had no idea that this type of roast is very lean, which means very dry.  

I will definitely try it again, but will use a fattier roast. I also recommend adding liquid to the cornmeal mixture as the recipe says. I didn't add enough so in addition to the meat being dry, so was the cornmeal mixture. 

A previous contributor suggested adding a cheese. This is a must.

It was OK the first day, I gave it 4 stars because it was better as leftovers.  I might make it again if I had some leftover pork.  I added extra chili powder, it would be better with black olives and cheese topping.

Very good - used left over pork loin and took previous advise to use chicken broth.  The broth is definately needed as the corn mixture becomes dense almost instantly when cooking.

I made this for the first time today.  It was okay, but the directions were a bit vague.  How dry is too try (when told to add more broth if the cornmeal mixture gets too dry).  What is the finished consistency supposed to be?  We love pork and we love spicy so to that end it was good (and filling!).  I served it with salsa and that helped moisten it up a bit.  It was tasy and I will most likely make again on a cold, dreary day.

This was a great alternative to making actual tamales.  I did reduce the amount of cayene pepper which helped it to not be too spicy.

I used leftover shredded pork from another recipe.  We didn't care for this at all.  Even though I covered the casserole as it baked, the end result was very dry.  Unlike other reviewers, we did not find the leftovers to be better tasting, just drier.  Would not make again.

Quite a tasty dish and super easy to make.  After slow cooking the pork roast a few days before and making bbq pork sandwiches for a left over lunch, I usually have just enough pork for one more meal.  The pork tamale pie was yummy.  Even my picky eater son enjoyed it.  However, I did change a few things.  I didn't have tomatoes, so I used a 15 oz can of pinto beans (drained) and added a can of 16 oz tomato sauce.  I used minced garlic and paprika plus salt for taste.  I added chopped black olives to the mixture and shredded cheese and remaining olives sprinkled on top before baking.  I used taco sauce and sour cream as a side with jalepenos.  Definately a make again meal.

I thought this had way too much pork for the amount of cornmeal in the recipe. Seems like I will be sticking with restaurant tamales as opposed to making this at home...

I was looking for a change from the usual chicken or beef and was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  My husband loved this as did our two boys.  It tastes even better the second day.  Being very busy, leftovers are my friend!  I took the advice of Sunnyrutter and added extra egg, cornmeal and milk.  Thank you Connie for submitting such a delicious casserole recipe.

It was a little dry so I’ll cut down the cornmeal next time. I used leftover pork roast and frozen corn. I used two cups of beef broth but maybe should have used chicken. I served it with salsa which tasted good.

I took the advice of another person on here and put in another egg 1/4 cup more milk and 1/2 cup more corn meal. I also used 2 packages of taco seasoning to the meat after it was cooked and added the tomatoes to the meat along with a little enchilada sauce.  Tossed in some black olives and black beans also.  Holy cow how yummy.

I found the corn bread a little dry. I'll try it with oil, the next time.

Thanks Connie! Overall a good recipe and I am guilty of changing thing around but not so much as to compromise the original recipe. I didn't add the corn (we had corn the previous night) but will try it next time, cut back on spices maybe to much (1 tsp chili powder and 1/4 tsp cayenne).  I layered the dish as stated in the notes.  Since I didn't add the corn and its liquid I had to add broth to keep the consistency a little thicker than you started with which I felt was the goal. That information was missing from the recipe as well as what it should be like when done (dry, wet, personal preference).  I cooked it for 30 minutes added cheese and baked for about five minutes more. It was still on the wet side but tasted good (add a little more information and I would rate it 5 stars). I will try this one again cause it is another way to use up leftovers pork roast. Served it with salsa and black beans. 

Since you can no longer add notes to your saved recipes I am saving them in my review.  From other reviewers: Because the recipe didn't state to drain some of the canned goods; I didn't. That seemed to work out just fine.  I also took the suggestion and layered the pie: meat, corn mixture, and then topped with shredded mexican cheese (because we love cheese).

I made it for dinner tonight and like several others I didn't quite know how much liquid  to use.  I drained the corn but not the tomatoes and even after 45 minutes it was still very soft set.  It held its shape but was more like a spoon bread.  We still enjoyed it, the taste was wonderful and we like polenta which it had the consistency of.

I haven't yet sampled the cooked result, but it is in the oven.  I did make a few changes.  I cooked the pork  with 6 cloves of garlic n the oven a day ahead, and removed the fat the next day.  There was a lot of fat.
I recooked the cubed pork in the broth and added half a bottle of Heredia tomatillo simmering sauce, and 2 chile de arbol , 4 cloves, and black peppercorns. 
I added comino, cumin, oregano, achiote and raisins to the cornmeal vegetable mix, along with diced onion, and diced red and green bellpepper and some jalapeno pepper. I was short on corn so added these vegetables. I used the liquid off the corn as part of the cooking liquid.
I doubled this recipe for a potluck dish, but used only about the original amount of meat.  Three pounds of meat is a lot of meat.
Also put it in the slow cooker on  low for about 6 hrs.  We like spice in our house.

I made this with HelloMe's recommendation, no corn. I added cumin and a little lime juice on the meat before I topped it with the cornmeal mixture. It really does taste like real tamales, without all the work! :)Yum Yum! everyone liked it from my six year old grandson, to the picky daughter and the hungry son! Good stuff!

My family loved it. I changed it a bit because of what I had on hand. 

I had leftover Dee's Roast Pork for Tacos and used that to simmer in beef broth. I used a can of Rotel tomatoes because we like it spicier. I didn't have a can of corn, so I used frozen. Because the recipe didn't state to drain some of the canned goods; I didn't. That seemed to work out just fine. 

I also took the suggestion and layered the pie: meat, corn mixture, and then topped with shredded mexican cheese (because we love cheese). YUM!
