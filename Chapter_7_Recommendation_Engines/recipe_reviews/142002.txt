This recipe was great, but needed a couple of changes. I added about a 1/4 lb of hamburger to bacon mixture and that turned out well, also gave me more shells to fill. With the shells, I would cook them for atleast 10 min instead of eight. They weren't all the way done and after baking they were hard on the edges. Also I wasn't too big of a fan of the tomato puree. Not too much flavor. I think next time I will just use ragu or prego sauce of my choice for extra flavor. Overall this recipe was pretty good!

My family LOVED this recipes!!! My 2 year old can be hard to please but it was no problem with this dinner and my husband finished off the leftovers by the next night! I made a few changes of my own which I felt made the recipe that much better. We're not big fans of bacon so I substituted the bacon for 3 Italian sausages. I removed the skin of them and chopped the meat up. Same cooking time and everything...just different meat. I found that using the sausage helped yield more shells as well. I also added a bit of shredded cheddar cheese on top since we're all such big cheese lovers. But this recipes is DEFINITELY one I will be making again real soon!!!

This was really good.  I did make some changes (I used ricotta cheese instead of cream cheese.  My bacon-crazy kids really liked this one.

I liked this recipe..made it as is the first time except I used shredded cheese instead of Buffalo and wished I had used Ragu instead of tomato puree.  The second time I tried this I got creative and added some shredded cooked chicken breast to the bacon/cream cheese mixture, used jar alfredo sauce instead of tomato puree and I used fresh shredded parm instead of mozerella on top and then backed the same.  It was delicious.

Mostly made as is.  I didn't care to hunt down whatever 'Buffalo' mozzarella is so just used regular.  (I'll have to check that out since I'm a cheese lover.)  And I don't usually have smoked bacon -- meant to add a bit of my 'smoke in a bottle' but forgot.  Not sure how much difference that would have made, because I didn't much see the point of the bacon.  May be one of those things you notice more when it's missing, rather than when it's there.  And this only filled I think about 2/3 the shells called for & that was not even stuffing them really good.  They were pretty good, but not "great."  Been quite some time since I've done large shells, so it was certainly something different.

Did not like these at all.  The taste of breadcrumbs was too overpowering.  I didn't use fresh breadcrumbs but dried which may have been the reason.  Per another review I did add cheddar cheese with the mozzarella.  That was a good move.  Other than that I can only suggest cutting the amount of breadcrumbs in half.

pretty good.  I used dry bread crumbs and it was too much, couldn't even taste the cream cheese.  so more bacon, less bread crumbs.

I had high hopes, but it just didn't work out.  I thought the taste of the tomato puree was way overpowering.  Using spaghetti sauce instead would've been a much better choice for our family.  I subbed Italian seasoning for the rosemary since I don't care for it, and couldn't find Buffalo mozz so I used shredded.  Nearly burned it since it was shredded and not chopped!  (oops!!)  I didn't have near enough filling for the pasta shells.  Bummed, bummed, bummed.  How many shells has everyone else used?  I weighed out 8 oz but it was too many for the amount of filling.

Wow, were these ever rich! I made one change, I only had prosciutto in my freezer, so I used a couple of slices, but it ended up being incredibly salty (my mistake). However, I also thought the amount of cream cheese was almost overpowering. We ended up being able to stretch these quite a bit, only having two shells each per meal with a big salad. I think next time I make these, I will sort of borrow Cindy's idea below and sub half of the cream cheese with ricotta.

I changed the recipe a bit, I am allergic to onions so I left them out. I cooked the bacon and garlic the night before and mixed the bread crumbs and cream cheese to the pan. Let it sit in the fridge overnight so the flavors combined. Warmed the mixture to make it easier to stuff the shells with. Added Italian seasonings, sweet basil, fresh ground pepper, a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar to the puree. I didn't have fresh mozzarella so I added shredded for the last 5 minutes of cooking time. I need to try this again but with Italian sausage next

We love cream cheese but that flavour dominated the dish.  Might try again with ricotta to bring out the taste of the rest of the ingredients -- bacon!!!

It looks and sounds better than it tastes. It wasn't horrible but defiantly not was I was hoping for. I added more bacon than the recipe called for and couldn't even taste it. The sauce needed more flavor for sure. I'm thinking I will try this again some alterations.

well tried, used 3 sausages that some one sugested, and ricotta cheese, used jarred tomato sauce and reg mozzerella, it made enough, but i will probably not make again due to the caloric intake, very artery clogging. good-but no good for me personaly, i know kids will love this. i can make this for the kids and i'll make a low cal fish  w/vegies for me

I thought these were okay. It was my first attempt at stuffed shells, and I made this recipe primarily because I needed to use up some about-to-expire cream cheese. I thought the recipe was a little one-note. The cream cheese flavor was very dominant. I could barely taste the bacon, and I thought the tomato puree could have benefited from more seasoning beyond the recommended rosemary (I used even more rosemary than suggested and still felt that it was under-seasoned). 
This would be a hit for someone with a more limited palate; my toddler really liked it.

I didn’t drain all the bacon grease out, used whole pack of bacon instead of only 4 slices (4 slices were saved to crumble on top for garnish) and used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain one. I also used sausage marinara. Family loved it.

I've swapped cream cheese out for ricatta, the traditional stuffed shell cheese. I left everything else is the same and this has become a holiday favorite in my house. Left overs are also great, because anything with red sauce is better the next day. Freezes quite well too!!

Not much taste as written.  I think if I try this next time, I'll try ricotta, decrease the amount of breadcrumbs, and maybe crumble the bacon a bit more.  Hubby seemed to like it, and he's not big on pasta-type dishes.

Followed the recipe for the 1st time.  It was edible but needs more flavor.  Will spice up next time and add more bacon.

Used turkey bacon, skip olive oil. Cooks beautifully in non sick fry pan. Instead of cream cheese I used low fat ricotta cheese. This dish does not need fat to taste great...Herbs add flavor w/o fat calories..

Great dish.  Easy to prepare and I substituted ground turkey for the second batch.  I left out the rosemary and used oregano.
