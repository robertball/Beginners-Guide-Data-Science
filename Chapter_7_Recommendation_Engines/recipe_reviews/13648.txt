I almost left the butter/sugar topping off due to one review, stating that it was gross. Well, I'm so glad I followed the recipe as is, without any alterations! We had 13 people for Thanksgiving dinner and EVERYONE raved about it. I'll make this again and again!

Nice flavor, but I think I'll make it a smaller casserole dish next time. It was such a thin layer.

I tried this for the first time on Thanksgiving, and it was awesome! And so easy to prepare, I think I will make it for regular meals as well.

Left out the last step. Used four cans of corn, instead of milk, I used heavy whipping cream and increased the eggs to four (needed enough for a crowd). The pan was cleaned out with no leftovers from our Easter dinner.

I used a slow cooker with this recipe. I put everything into the slowcooker (leaving out the sauce) and let it cook on low for about 5-6 hours. Then I added the "sauce" and let it cook for another hour. It came out pretty yummy, but it was quite bland to me before I added the sauce. O. and in case it's not obvious - use clarified butter (it'll look better, not like an oily mess).

This is very very good! The only thing I would do different, is cut the amount of butter and sugar for the topping, it was kind of sweet for me. My mom loved it! I will be serving this more often then just Thanksgiving.

Yummy! The bigger the pan, the thinner you spread it. the thinner you spread it, the faster it cooks.  I overcooked mine- be careful!  Use extra pam- it sticks bad!  Was soo good though will make again when I decide to cheat on my low carb diet lol

I followed this recipe exactly, except I halved the sauce.  A 9X13 pan is obviously way too big for this quantity - my corn pudding squares were less than an inch thick!  The pudding tasted good, but the sauce was disgusting, and there was still way too much sauce even though I made only half.  I recommend you use the corn pudding recipe, but double it for a rectangular pan and disregard the butter sauce entirely.

I didn't do the final butter-sugar topping and it was delicious.  I think it would have been too sweet with anymore sugar.  I doubled the recipe and used cream corn for one can.  Also I added green chile and a little cream for 1 cup of milk.  Everyone loved it at the Thanksgiving table - even the children (ages 1 through 5).  Will definitely save and use again.

The flavors were awesome! I added jalepeno to the baked mix which kicked it up a little. Cheese and sour cream would also taste good if added to the mix. I loved the topping it was like a sweet buttery pudding. After heating the consistency of the pudding top was like lemon cream pie. Will be making this dish (doubled) for thanksgiving. I would grease the pan before baking as my corn pudding stuck to 9 x 9 baking dish. Keep in mind that this is a pudding; similar to an egg custard.

I found this recipe some time ago and since then I have been using it whenever I have a gathering. So many people compliment this dish. I add a hint of nutmeg and cinnamon to it!

Very good!  I also thought about not including the sauce, but I did pour it on anyway and everyone at Thanksgiving LOVED it!  I look forward to making it just for us at Christmas.

Made this recipe for a church potluck tonight and it was wonderful.  Every drop got eaten.   The topping kind of stayed on top so when I put the dish out I mixed the topping with the cake so it didn't look so soupy.   Definitely a keeper recipe and the great thing about it is that the ingredients are items most people have on hand.

I found the texture of this was more like scrambled eggs then custard. It didn't taste bad, but wasn't anything special.

I was skeptical about making the Corn Pudding at first cause I dont really prepare many sweets, so I made just enough for 2-3 servings. I was amazed at the simplicity of this recipe and loved the way it came out. Not a desert by any means. I cant wait to add it to my endless amount of dishes I serve during the holidays. I dont know why other reviews say the the topping is no good, i think they may have burnt the sauce topping and or undercooked it. Mine was great. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Oh yea one more thing i did do was I doubled the recipe so that my pudding was not just a thin layer in my 9x13 pan.

I love corn pudding! My mother shaves her homegrown corn off the cob and freezes it. Its sweet and I'm wondering if it will be too sweet for this recipe. I love her fresh corn, especially during the holidays. Thank you for a great idea!

This is a great recipe!  My grandmother used to make it when I was little.  I made it twice in the past two days.  I didn't make the sauce either time and the second time I added a little melted butter to the mixture...probably about 2 tbsp. It give the dish a hint of a buttery taste and it was excellente!

Absolutely deeelicious- I cant cook worth a dime and it came out perfectly. Next time, I may use just a tad less sugar as I couldnt find whole kernel corn that wasnt already sweetened.

The pudding was good enough, but I didn't like the topping. It was thickened by the flour, but it was a weird texture. Maybe it would have been better without flour, which would have been just a buttery simple syrup. This one's not a repeat for me, but I may have done something wrong with the topping.

Cooked in round soufflé casserole to get a little deeper base. Only disadvantage to this method is that you’d be hard-pressed to get more than 6 servings from it unless you were to double the base portion of the recipe. However, it was absolutely delicious, creamy and rich.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly; except for my addition of black beans to add protein. This dish was delicious! I will definitely make again.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving.  It was a little sweet but not too sweet.  Recipe was easy to follow and I would definitely make it again.

I have made this on Thanksgiving for three years in a row. Now i say ill never look at canned corn the same way again. This recipie turns a simple can of corn into a gourmet masterpiece. I love it, and would sacrifice having the turkey, to have the corn pudding.

I added 1/2 tsp salt to the bottom corn layer. 
NOW the top layer..... It turned out to be this clearish yellow sweet butter jelly.  the look of the jelly turned my stomach. I tried a small portion and couldn't take another bite. It was so strange. I can't explain it.

Delicious! For the reviewers who said it's too sweet...it is called "pudding" so expect it to be sweet.  Don't leave off the topping.  I cooked mine in a 9x9 casserole dish and left it in until it looked good and set.  Yummy!  My kids loved it.

A big hit! I would make a few changes, though: make it in a smaller casserole dish or just double everything but the topping. Also, I never got the topping to become clear, but it still tasted great, if a bit sweet. Everyone loved it.

The pudding was at best 1/2" high.  It was so sweet (and I didn't even add the topping). I didn't care for it at all.

I did not think this was good if you know corn pudding well. It was edible and not unpleasant to taste but my aunt has the best corn pudding recipe and I was trying to find one to compete. This just wasn't it. I LOVE corn pudding but there are better recipes out there.
