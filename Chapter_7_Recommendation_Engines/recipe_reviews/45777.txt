"Death by cheese" is a good name for this sandwich--VERY fattening and probably not the healthiest choice, but YYYYYUUUUUUUMMMMMM!!!!  This was FANTASTIC, and TOO easy to make!  I'll have to restrain myself from indulging too much!  Next time I'll try a little sliced tomato in the sandwich.

I wish I'd had the same experience as the previous reviewer of this sandwich. My husband and I both felt it was too greasy and not tasty enough to warrant the hassle of making it. I'll stick with plain old grilled cheese sandwiches.

my boyfriend and I made this on a whim, but they turned out to be terrible. I followed the recipe exactly and it didnt dawn on me that the oil soaks into the bread. We normally eat very healthy foods, but this was  too heavy and too greasy for us. I wouldnt suggest this recipe to my worst enemy!

Holy cow, I don't want to even begin to think how unhealthy this snack is... BUT, all things in moderation, right?? This is just DELICIOUS!!! I tried to do my best by using low-fat mayo, and also gently frying them in a skillet sprayed with butter-flavored Pam. I also enthusiatically patted the sandwiches with paper towel before we ate them. They really were delicious, but I would not feel good about eating them more than once every 2 months.... If you're going to make them, use the strongest cheese you can find. If you're going to load up on calories, you might as well be able to taste them....

A little drive in where I grew up made these and called them cheese fritters. The drive in has been gone for several years now and I was very excited to find this recipe.  My first batch didn't turn out too well, however because I used a slice of American cheese and the sandwich did not have enough cheesy flavor.  Also, be sure and don't soak the bread in the egg/milk mixture more than a second or two or it will be soggy.

Taking all other reviews into account I made this, using a George Foreman Grill, which reduced calorie amount considerably. To a previous reviewer, who objected to the mayonnaise and cheese:  2 teaspoons mayonnaise per sandwich really seems very  minimal!

After a sudden illness that almost cost me my life a little over a year ago I've lost a staggering amount of weight. I still have a difficult time eating much because of no appetite. So my doctors' goal now is to get me to take in protein to build my muscle mass back up. I saw this recipe and added a slice of ham to it. I then soaked my single sandwich in an egg with milk, until it was fully absorbed. Then I coated it with the breadcrumbs. Deep frying adds unnecessary calories. All that's needed is a thin coating of oil in a skillet, and I fried it until golden on both sides, then blotted on a paper towel. For many, the relatively high caloric content might pose a problem, but for me, it was just perfect. Although I could only manage half of this filling sandwich, it was excellent! The soft, egg-soaked bread contrasts with the crispy exterior. I used a slice of Jarlsberg and a slice of American, with a slice of ham in between. The meal had a nice, high protein content, with 2 slices of cheese, ham, milk and an egg. I'm going to try to reheat the rest later. I'm sure adding a couple of salted tomato slices would make this even more delicious. Thank you for posting this yummy vehicle for regaining my strength. Edited to add: Although it's impossible to retain the crispy exterior when reheated in the microwave, it was still tasty a few hours later on.

DELICIOUS! What a treat! My family and I loved it - it wasn't soggy. I added a little "crunch" to it...  My modifications:

*used very little mayo
*used two types of cheddar and a slice of American
*quickly dipped it in the egg mixture, but then I crunched up some of my favorite crackers and dipped it in that too...it was battered and coated/breaded - not soggy at all
*did not deep fry - I used a seasoned cast iron skillet with very little oil.
*added a tablespoon of butter the last few minutes of cooking to add some flavor and brown the bread a little.

I turned out PERFECT  - YUM!!

I really, really, really wanted to love this recipe.  It just didn't have much personality.  I will definitely make this again but I think I will add onion, tomato and maybe bacon.

This recipe wasn't horrible, but since we didn't have a deep fryer we just fried it in a pan. The sandwich was way too soggy and we had to eat it with a fork since it was so heavy. It sounded great, maybe if we had a deep fryer it would have come out differently.

I am giving this five stars but I must say that I cheated by adding a few ingredients like mortadella, capicollo and dijon mustard.  An important thing was the bread I used. I always get my bread at the bakery so it's nice and fresh, more dense than commercial bread, and I slice it almost 1 inch thick.  I also reduced the oil to about 1/2 cup for frying.  The sandwiches were crispy and warm, a perfect There's nothing to make for supper, supper.

All I can say is YUM!!! This sandwich was heavenly!!!! It is quite rich and "indulgent". Perfect to curl up with on the couch on a cold and rainy afternoon or evening. My husband and I ate ours with a bowl of homemade veggie soup. 

Since I liked these so much, my friend and I also made these over at her house for out "movie night", and since she doesn't have a deep fryer, we just fried them in a skillet on the stove. They still turned out wonderfully. So for those who don't like as much grease (as one reviewer remarked), you might want to try this way. :)

Ok, I saw this recipe and I *had* to try it. I used wheat bread, italian seasoned bread crumbs and put a little parmesan in the bread crumbs. Also, I thought the frying it in oil was a little much, so I cooked it in a pan with a little 100% canola margerine. It really was good, but I won't be making it too often because of the unhealthy factor. I think some tomato on it would be really good.

We had a drive-in that used to make these and they were my very favorites.  I was excited to find this recipe but not so excited to eat them.  I probably did wrong when I used processed cheese slices.  As my mother says "everything tastes good when someone else makes it" I'm not sure if I will go to the trouble to try again.

Great recipe!  My husband and I loved these.  Super easy and a nice change of pace from traditional grilled cheese.  Must admit tough, rather than fry the sandwiches in oil, I melted margarine in a nonstick pan and toasted them that way.  Not nearly as greasy and the salty margarine taste was a plus.  Leftovers were a hit on the second day, too.

My 10 year old daughter and I loved it. I added jalopinoes to mine before frying it. Yummy I loved the spiciness. I will never make these again due to the fat content. But it sure was good to try at least once. Thanks for posting!
