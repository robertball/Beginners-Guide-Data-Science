This is a great recipe for people who don't like HOT wings.  I didn't change the recipe at all, but I did change the cooking method.  I marinated the chicken wings in the sauce for three hours.  Then I lined a cookie sheet (with sides) with the new non-stick foil.  I put the marinated wings on the cookie sheet and baked them for approximately 50 minutes.  They do brown very nicely.  I did not baste them.  When the wings were almost done  I brought the marinade to a boil in a large pot.  I boiled it for about two minutes.  I mixed 3 tbs. corn starch in a jar with some ice water, about 1/2 cup.  Slowly mix the corn starch mixture into the boiling marinade until it is the thickness you desire.  Adding the cold cornstarch mixture to the hot marinade keeps it from getting lumpy.  I don't know why this works, but it does.  (Also works for gravy).  When the marinade is the thickness you desire, turn it off.  When the wings are done, add them to the pot and mix to coat with the thickened marinade.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve.  Great recipe.

I don't know why people change so much in a recipe the first time they make something and then rate it less than it should be!  These don't need a change..they are yummi and gooey!! Take the freedom to be sloppy..and you won't be able to resist the finger lickin! One person mentioned cooking sauce seperately for basting...but if you fill your tinfoil lined pan with 1/4" of the sauce while baking the wings, you just baste with that..it's hot and yummy and available for dipping in the end.  Husband loved these!

Fantastic wings and loved by the whole gang. Did not have molasses in the house, which didn't seem to make a difference because they turned out great! I marinated for three hours, took the chicken out and broiled for about fifteen minutes to crisp them up, and then baked with the wonderful sauce. Yummy!

I made these wings and added 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 2 T vinegar and 2 T Franks Hot sauce and a dash of chili pepper.  They turned out perfect like the ones at wingers, not hot but perfectly spicey!!
Don't worry if your sauce is a little runny, it gets gooey when it cooks.  I also did not bother re-bastinging the wings or turning them, but be sure to grease your pan! Better yet use foil over a pan and grease that.

These wings were amazing.  I made them for my Christmas party and there weren't any left by the end of the night.  And I made a lot!!  If you want them to be a little bit more spicy I suggest increasing the chili sauce.  I cooked these on a baking sheet as opposed to a dish.  I think they come out more crispy that way and I turned them once half way through cooking.

I used drumsticks instead of wings but first I skinned them to remove some of the fattiness. The only other change I made to the recipe was using a tbp. of chile paste instead of the sauce. I think it added some extra heat but we liked it! Ooop's there was one more change, I put the marinade in a saucepan & cooked it down some because you shouldn't use sauce you marinaded raw chicken in to baste with unless you cook it @ a higher temp to kill the bacteria. I reduced it some & then thickened it up w/ cornstarch mixed in cold water before basting the chicken.  These were fantastic...like a spicy asian BBQ. Normally if I have leftovers, I either make something different out of them or send them home w/ my son but he is going to miss out on these ;o) ...we are going to turn around & have them for dinner again tonight. They are soo good! I served them w/ microwave corn on the cob (topped w/ garlic parmesan butter mix) & sesame green beans (both from this site) but I'll make different sides tonight to shake it up some.

Absolutely the best recipe ever for sweet chicken wings! I did add about 20 shakes of "hot sauce" to them too. My friend who doesn't like hot wings was blown away. He couldn't tell I had added it...he wants another batch tonight. I also used about 1--1 1/2 T. of powdered garlic instead of the garlic cloves. Cooked them for the 50 minutes at 375 and then kicked the heat down to 350 for another 20 minutes and the meat just fell off the bone. I did what another reader suggested...I fixed rice and poured the marinade over it...awesome! You have to try this recipe!

GREAT CHICKEN!
The first time I made this, I found it to be very mild, so the next time, I baked the chicken IN most of the sauce and turned it frequently (every 10 minutes or so) and it was really flavourful!

I am not a big fan of chicken wings, but these definately won me   They were a hit at a recent dinner party.  The marinade is incredible.  I'm going to try it on ribs next.  Only 1 suggestion, use a disposable pan to cook these on, I think I ruined mine!  Excellent recipe!!!!

These were really good.  Almost tasted like teriyaki chicken..which I LOVE!!  I do not like wings, so I used chicken tenders.  I didn't have any molasses and so I substitued maple syrup like a previous reviewer and left out the ginger since I didn't have any.  I left the chicken in the marinade for about 8 hours and pan fried them in a little oil.  I boiled the sauce to serve over rice.  The sauce is very forgiving...especially when you leave out a couple of the ingredients.  Thanks Christinet.

Ok, am really beginning to see this recipe as a community effort. I actually read thru about 3/4th of these reviews today, then made what I came up with, keeping everyone's comments in mind.  True the sauce is forgiving if you have to make substitutes, but bottom line  .  .  this is a great recipe!! I was looking for a great SuperBowl recipe for this Sunday and decided this was going to be it. I was out of honey so followed the recipe using maple syrup and molasses. It sounded important to thicken the sauce, so I just made the sauce first, thickening according to suggestion with a little cornstarch stirred into ice water. I used half for the initial marinade and the second half to glaze the chicken when I put it into the oven. Pamming and foiling your cookie pan is important. In the oven, I turned the chicken twice, glazing with the sauce each time, and in 50 or so minutes, the chicken came out beautifully done, extremely tender and flavorful. I didn't especially want mine to taste Asian, but I know that I like gingerbread, so I thought, how can I miss with molasses and ginger?  But I cut back on the ginger to 1/8 teaspoon.  And I liked someone's suggestion to add a little orange juice to balance the molasses.  I am here to tell you that doing these things, there was no distinct flavor of molasses, ginger, soy sauce, garlic, no distinct anything, only amazing flavor that held in the chicken juices, so it was incredibly tender.  Will be doing this on wings for the Superbowl!

I used chicken legs for this, as I found a discounted package of legs yesterday that needed to be used. Only thing I did was add in a little black pepper and half of a package of sesame seeds at the end. Everyone loved it.

TIP: You can find cheap seasonings if you look in the ethnic section of your supermarket. Most all spices are under a dollar and you get a ton.

Me and the li'l chef (my 8 yr old son) wanted to make some tasty wings, and we had all the ingredients, so......  prep time was about 15 minutes, we then let the chicken sit in the fridge for 45 minutes, plenty of time.  Put the wings on a cookie sheet w/ aluminum foil and broiled first for 3 or 4 minutes to crisp them up, then cooked for about 55 minutes at 375, basting w/ extra sauce we made in a different bowl every 10 minutes.  These turned out fraggin' sweet!!!!!!  Literally just like Christinet's picture..... I will admit, we used all the ingredients, but I rarely measure, so we used more molasses and ginger and garlic, and a little less soy sauce and we added about 10 good dashes of Tabasco.  The li'l chef liked the minor heat kick, so if you want a little more, I'd say double the dose for a good zing.  Wish we had bleu cheese......  but ranch dipping sauce was all we had, and it was pretty good.  These are very sticky if you baste them as we did throughout the cooking process, so be prepared to lick you fingers..... a lot.....  We're going to try boneless wings/chunks next time, so the other li'l chefs in the house can eat them too without getting toooooooo messy from the bone-in ones!!!  Thanks for reading,

This recipe turned out well.  I made them as an appetizer for Thankgiving and everyone loved them.  I made 5 pounds of chicken wings & marinaded them as instructed.  I followed the recipe exactly and came out with great results.  I was weary of using the molassess and the honey, but I am glad I followed the instructions.  If you like things spicy, I would suggest doubling the amount of hot sauce. 7/2/07 UPDATE: I made these for a grad party and everyone loved them.  I went through 8 pounds of wings.  My new suggestions are to turn them every 10 min. (especially if your oven is older like ours.  The temp is all off)  This really helps keeping them from sticking too much and getting covered in a blackened mess.  Also Pam works much better than butter or margarine.

These were amazing and I didn't even marinate them in the sauce....only glazed them before cooking and then again halfway through. I learned on a cooking show a great way to bake wings.  Steam them for 10 minutes.  This removes fat and oil that can make them soft.  Refrigerate them for an hour.  This dries them out on the outside a redistributes the juices inside. I baked them in a 425 degree oven. I dipped them once in the glaze,too them out halfway through and glazed them again and flipped them and cooked for another 20 minutes. AMAZING.  Three pounds went in five minutes.  Great Super Bowl food!

These were terrible. I did exactly as the recipe stated and they looked like bland chicken so I put them under the broiler so they would get crisp and browned but they had NO flavor.

I made this exactly as recipe calls for except I used 9 pounds of chicken wings - put it in a crock pot and let it cook. I brought it to a Christmas get together and everyone loved them -There were no leftovers to bring home.

This is a HUGE hit whenever I take it to potlucks.  I usually replace the full amount of soy sauce with equal parts soy and Worchestershire sauce and kick the heat up a little with extra Tabasco.

These are great, mind you I don't even care for eating chicken off of the bone (something with the tendons ect. turns me off)!  I brought them to a family Halloween gathering & they LOVED them, I finally picked some off with a fork & they really are so tender & tasty.  The only regret that I have is not making a second batch using "hot" chili sauce to spice them up (which has been requested)!  Oh yeah, I also baked them in the sauce as others suggested.  Thanks so much Christinet, my 9 year old nephew thanks you too!

Yummy BETTY CROCKER recipe!  I had no idea that published cookbook recipes were accepted.  I have been making this for many years out of one of my first cookbooks that I got in the early '90s.  I was very surprised that nothing is changed.  Not even a little bit.

my concern is that you're basting the chicken wings with sauce that raw chicken marinated in...I put the leftover marinade in a saucepan and bought it to a boil before I basted my chicken.

Excellent.  I doubled the recipe and marinated the wings overnight in the sauce.  I then baked on a cooking sheet for about 30 minutes to cook off some of the juices so as not to thin out the sauce.  Then I threw the wings and sauce in a crockpot for a couple of hours.  Really, really good!

Really nice recipe. They were very popular at an appetizer and dessert party. I marinated the wings for 2 days to maximize flavor. I brushed the wings with half of the marinade and cooked down the rest until it was thickened. The concentrated glaze was poured onto the wings just before cooking was finished. I suggest cooking these in a disposable foil pan. I didn't. Big mistake.

GREAT WING CHANGE.  ALTHOUGH I LIKE A LITTLE MORE KICK.  NEXT TIME I WILL ADD SOME CRUSHED RED PEPPER ALONG WITH SOME FRESH GINGER TO GIVE IT A EXTRA BOOST.  ALSO I USED PARCHMENT PAPER AND THEY DID NOT STICK OR LEAVE A BIG MESS FOR ME TO CLEAN.  THANKS FOR THE GREAT WING CHANGE.

I took these to a family picnic and they were a bit hit.  Everyone assumed that I had purchased them because they were just perfect!  I took the advice of a couple of different reviewers.  I marinated over night.  I also broiled just the wings on each side for 5 minutes before I baked.  I baked on disposable cookie sheets to keep clean up to minimum.  The first half of the baking, I just poured the marinade over the wings and let it bake in the marinade, but I realized that I really wanted a thicker, stickier coating. so I took another reveiwers recomendation.  I poured the marinade off, boiled it on the stove for 2 minutes and thickened it up with 3 tbs of corn starch, then brushed it over the wings and continued to bake.  Next time I might add a little tobasco sauce for a hint of heat.

Try this recipe with skinless chicken breasts! It is excellent! You can use either bone in or boneless. Another version I am temped to try is to precook my chicken, marinate it with the sauce and then cook it on the grill, bet it would be wonderful! Phoenix.

Made this for an appetizer at Thanksgiving.
These taste so good and you can't eat just one.
Excellent chicken wing recipe will be making again especially during football season.

One of the best non-Buffalo wing recipes.  They're not hot at all so perfect for those with delicate tongues.  I serve them from a crock pot so they're nice and saucy when people take them.

I marinated, baked, then refrigerated the wings the day before I planned to serve them and they were just as delicious "cold." To baste I simply turned over the wings every 15 minutes while baking them but would like to see if basting with pure soy sauce as per the recipe would make a big difference next time. The wings are very much like my mom used to make - thank you for posting!

This is an awesome recipe. The only variation I have is that I used chicken legs instead of wings. I have had nothing but compliments on these. Reheated? They are even better.

These are amazing!  I made a few minor changes to suit my family's tastes, but overall this is a winner.  (Doubled up on the garlic, used 1 tsp ginger puree, and added a lot more chili paste for added kick.) And I took one review's advice and baked them in the sauce.  Also, I removed the tips but didn't split the sections.  They were very moist and tender and the tops were crispy.  This is a new family favorite!

For a change of pace, I was looking for a wing recipe as far away from hot Buffalo-style wings as possible and found this. YUM!!  I love the predominant molasses flavor and the way it blends so nicely with the ginger and the garlic (might add a little extra garlic next time.) Marinated about 4 hours, which was just right. Also, I recommend using a low-sided baking dish (I lined my jelly roll pan with heavy duty foil) for even crisp-ness and browning. Can't wait to make these again. VERY good; will use this often!

I made these for the Superbowl this past weekend.  Quite possibly the best "sweet" style wings I've ever had.  I marinated mine overnight.  In addition to the ingredients listed, I used fresh grated ginger, a teaspoon of red chile flakes, and about 1/2 cup of oj.  I too boiled the leftover marinade down and tossed the cooked wings in it.  Sooo oooey, goooey, good!

I made these for my kids lunches(they get bored with just sandwiches all the time) and they love them, even cold.  I did not have chili sauce so I used some chili powder.  I also let them marinate for about 3 hours.  I did not have the problem of the sauce sticking to the pan like some of the other people did. I used pam on the pan before cooking.  I will be making this again.

My husband loved these wings. The only thing is they could stand to be a little more cripy. Next time I think I will take the advise of a previous reviewer and broil the wings. Overall a great recipe.

I used this recipe on boneless, skinless chicken that I sliced into thick strips.  I bought the Chinese chile paste (thinking that was what was intended for in the chile sauce) and I have to admit, it was awesome! I hope that was what this recipe had in mind for chile sauce.  It added the right amount of heat and regular chile sauce might get lost in the flavor of the rest of the ingred, list.  I also used low sodium soy sauce.  This was a hit with my family and pretty easy to make.  I lined my pan with foil for easier cleanup. Made for an easy to put together dinner that was tasty-winner recipe!

Excellent wings recipe. Perfect balance between sweet and spicy. You can vary the ingredients depending on how hot you like your wings. I removed the wings from the oven after 30 minutes and finished by grilling them on medium-low heat for ten minutes to crisp. Nice recipe. I'll definitely use this one again.

These wings were a huge hit our latest party!!  I tripled the recipe and cooked the wings with the sauce in multiple pans, raising the temperature to 400 after an hour to really brown the wings.  I then transferred them to a crock pot with some of the sauce to keep warm.  These were popular with young and old alike - not spicy at all.

Great recipe!  I made these for my boyfriend and he loved them - he thought I had gone to all this trouble to make a romantic meal for him (when really, I was just using up some wings I had in the freezer).
I lined the pan with foil first, it made cleanup a lot easier.

Great flavor! I also baked the wings in the marinade and turned them once.  I liked another reviewer's suggestion of adding sesame seeds and broiling them for a few minutes at the end.

Slap-yo-mama good! Awesome recipe. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they were not that great after being frozen/thawed...but still worth eating. I always like to make extra to freeze for later in the week or following week. But still a GREAT recipe. I will probably try the sauce on other things like ribs and chicken. Thanks so much for sharing!

I made this last week for movie night and it was a big success.  They disappeared really quick.  I did season my chicken first with garlic powder, italian seasoning, lemon pepper and then marinaded overnight.  Yummy!!!  Also used low sodium soy sauce!!!  Highly recommend!!

I made skewered chicken by slicing breasts into strips and marinating in the sauce. I threaded the chicken on sticks and grilled, brushing and basting while it grilled. Excellent appetizer!

I prefer to use drumsticks and thighs so we can make a real meal out of this yummy recipe. I now bake the chicken in a jellyroll pan. The shallow baking pan allows the outside of the chicken to crisp up nicely.

These were pretty good.  Almost like a honey bbq, but not quite.  Not the best wings I've ever had, but good. Will probably make again.

Game day wings. I give this only 4 stars because of sweetness but don't let that discourage you from trying. I will make these again but will cut back on the sweetness. Didn't have any complaints in fact they were gone with in 10 minutes.

Faaaan-TASTIC. And so easy! I didn't even let mine marinate because I was starving, but I'm sure it would have been even better had I let it sit in the sauce. I made some modifications because we had five pounds of wings and my hubby wanted chicken tenderloins for his portion, so I altered the quantity of the sauce. (I baked everything together at 375 in a 9x13, and when I flipped the wings halfway through, I simply removed the tenderloins at that time and they were juicy and perfectly cooked.) I thought the sauce was missing something at first, so I added a little ketchup and a touch of Worcestershire sauce until it was perfect.  I put everything in a 9x13 with 3/4 of the sauce covering the wings / allowed the wings to swim in the sauce as it baked, then at the halfway point when I flipped the wings, I added the remaining 1/4. Perfect! Juicy, tender, and I think baking it in the sauce really helped keep the chicken moist. Using the remaining sauce the chicken baked in as a dipping sauce for the tenderloins was awesome. 5 stars!  Oh, and for the people who were leaving the molasses out, it simply will NOT be the same recipe, in taste nor appearance. That's the mahogany aspect of the mahogany chicken wings!

I don't like chicken wings if the skin is soggy and I have tried similar recipes like this and the skin was soggy.  I substituted pork spare ribs for the wings, followed the recipe exact and then cooked for 1 hour.  They were GREAT.  The flavor was very nice and the sauce thickens up and is delicious.  May even try them on chicken wings and grill them to crisp the skin.

very good.  notes:  use enough sauce to cover bottom of pan-otherwise, it burns (soy sauce). use tinfoil w pam. use 1 - 2 T chopped ginger,4-5 chopped garlic cloves, green onions minced fine(6 whole!). use more honey & add water (a little) to fill out bottom of pan, can be broiled, add wings *after* the sauce (the little chunks and bits burn easily), turn after 15 min, 30-35 min @ 425, make chicken breast for M, wings for me!...yaayyy!

Incredibly good and really easy. I did this with legs and thighs and left it to marinate overnight in a ziplock bag in the fridge. In the morning, I flipped the bag over and left it alone.  My daughter threw it in the oven and it turned out great.

Yum! I made these wings in a crock pot, cooking on high for one hour and on low for eight. They were perfect - bursting with flavor and pretty too. I didn't have chili paste so I used 2 T. of bbq sauce and 1 tsp of chili powder.

So awesome! Took these to a party and everyone loved them!  Very easy to make.  I put them in a crock pot and covered them with the cooked marinade.  For a garnish, I topped with sliced green onions and toasted sesame seeds.  I also added a little sesame oil to the marinade to add more flavor!

This is a great recipe. I often fry my chicken wings - but hate the mess and smell afterwards. Now I am never frying a wing again - baking is the way to go!

This makes for a nice wing that satisfies people who like sweet sauces - but also has a nice asian flavor to balance it out. I didn't have molasses on hand and figured I could save some calories by omitting it - so followed the recipe without it. 

They turned out great! I did pour off the excess liquid in the last 15 mins so they could crisp up a bit more - and maybe the molasses would have made it stick better - but the flavor was in no way dimished. 

I served with a wasabi ranch dressing (just bottled ranch and wasabi powder mixed in) and they were a hit. Be sure to have lots of napkins on hand if serving at a party - these are messy! :-)

Pretty good, but should be spicer.  'Tastes spiced (ginger) compared to being spicy (hot).  I'm okay with the ginger, but I personally would reduce the sweetness.

This was not at all what I was expecting. By the ratings I thought...these are going to be amazing but they were not at all. I have made another recipe for wings from this website that just blows these away! For the person that said to add..3 tbs of cornstarch to 1/2 cup cold water...all I can say is...how did you enjoy the paste that it made? Needless to say...that sauce was not even edible. Major waste of time and ingredients and would not reccomend them to anyone.

Per other suggestions, I substituted maple syrup versus using molasses, and also lined the baking pan with foil to ease up on the cleaning.  These wings are wonderful and a nice change from hot wings.  During the last 20 minutes or so of cooking, I kicked up the roast mode on my convection oven and this brought out the deep browning and glaze of the marinade.  I reserved 1/4 of the marinade for sauce on the side, but next time I see no need to do so and will use the entire batch of marinade for the baking process.

These wings are a great alternative to spicy wings and very easy.  I marinate them longer than called for and the meat falls off the bone.

This was excellent... the combination of honey, molasses, soy, lemon... and don't forget the ground ginger... was a perfect combination!  I marinated my wings for about 24 hours... my guests loved them!  I will make this over and over.

This is a true story. I called my best girlfriend who was throwing a get together for superbowl football.We started discussing the menu.  I was making my own food as I decided to stay home with my family. My friend started talking about the wings that she was going to make.   I told her that it had the same exact ingredients... I found out that we were both making the same recipe.  At both homes this recipe was a hit. My friends disappeared instantly. I had left overs & they tast even better leftover. Thanks for sharing this.

This recipe was perfect.  The only thing I did differently from the directions was I put the sauce on the wings in a ziplock bag, in the morning & the wings marinated all day - I knew I would not be home from work in time to allow them to marinate for 1 or 3 hours.  My spouse actually put the wings into bake about 20 minutes before I got home.  He did not include the sauce with the wings on the pan covered in parchment paper.  When I got home, I poured the sauce onto the pan, turned the wings  to coat them & continued cooking for remainder of the time. The sauce thickened & glazed the wings perfectly (no cornstarch used at all).

I wasn't going to write a review but then after 12 hours I realized I was still blown away. About 3 months ago I realized I needed/wanted to start cooking more. my fiancé hadn't been extremely enthusiastic about my newfound realization because well, lets just say I don't think the food was up to par with his wants. I would always ask him how is the food and he would always say "pretty good" and eat it when in reality he was probably choking it down, until the mahogany chicken wings.  Right after his first bite he grabbed my iPad asked where the recipe was and saved it himself!!! Thats definitely a win in my book!!!I added 1 cup of brown sugar,about 15 shakes of franks hot sauce and used garlic salt instead of garlic cloves. I however did not use any chili sauce because I didn't have any on hand. I baked at 375 for 45 minutes and then dropped it down to 350 for 20 more minutes. I couldn't have asked for an easier /tastier recipe. I guess from here in out my finances standards will be raised. Lets hope I can find some other great recipes that I can be successful with :)

I like this recipe. I used 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup dark soy sauce instead. It is easy to prepare and taste great. Next time, I will broil them a bit  as I like craspy skin. I also follow other cooks, bake with all  sauce at once, no  brushing with sauce.

We really enjoyed these.  I transfered the wings to a foil lined sheet and baked them for another 25 minutes.  They were crispy and delicous!~

Great recipe!  My husband refuses to even try Buffalo wings so this was right up his alley.  I baked mine on parchment paper on a jelly roll pan at 350*.  No burning problem at all. Brought the remaining marinade to a boil and simmered for the 1st 25 minutes the chicken was baking.  Then basted and baked another 25.  Taking them to a party tomorrow if I can keep my husband out of the fridge.  :)  Will just wrap in foil and reheat.  May take the leftover marinade as a dipping sauce.  I know they will be a hit!

This is one of those recipes, that after reading a number of the reviews, you realize that seemingly everyone did something different!  It was difficult to know which way to proceed with this.  But I forged ahead and marinated my wings for 4 or 5 hours and when ready to bake I put them on a baking sheet.  I boiled the leftover marinade for about 10 minutes to kill any bacteria and reduce it a bit.  After the wings had baked about 20 minutes, I basted them and continued basting about every ten minutes.  I also turned them over about half way through the cooking time.  After 50 minutes my wings weren’t as crispy as we like them, so I broiled them on both sides to crisp them up.  The flavor of the wings was good, but for me this recipe requires way too much babysitting.  I would much prefer to bake the wings naked and then throw them on the grill and use the marinade as a basting sauce.

I only had 4 wings so I cut the ingredients down to fit and used fresh ground ginger, also I didn't have the time to let rest in the fridge so I put it in a baking dish with carrots, onions and yellow squash from my garden and baked accordingly. Served with brown rice and a nice cucumber salad , my wife loved it and said we should makes some wings by themselves for our superbowl party.

I followed the recipe exactly and then boiled and thickened the remaining sauce, dipped each piece in the hot sauce, and baked at 500 for a few minutes to caramelize them a bit. I packed them up to take to a potluck so didn't eat them right out of the oven but unfortunately after all that work there just wasn't much flavor.  Needed more heat.  And even though I used half regular soy and half lite they weren't nearly salty enough.  Disappointing.

Made these per the recipe except used chicken breasts cut into 1X3 strips (husband doesn't like wings). They had a very nice flavor. Followed the directions, think next time I'll reduce the cook time if using breasts, they were a little on the dry side. The sauce remained watery but that worked well as I served the chicken w/the sauce over rice with soy sauce on the side. The chile sauce left me stumped, didn't know if it was heinz (ketchup w/chili pepper), mexican (green or red chiles) or asian (rooster sauce). I used rooster sauce since the recipe called for ginger, it was sweet w/a little kick which we all liked. Step son had 3 servings and he eats like a bird! Think next time I may add some chopped onion, would be a nice addition if making it this way. Thanks for the unique and awesome marinade!

I have 8 of my own recipies for wings that whomever tries them says they're the best wings they've ever had.  I tried these and they taste identical to my own favorite recipe but much less lebor & time intensive to make.  These have replaced my own favorite recipe that I've been making for almost 30 years.  That's saying a lot.  Definitely give them a try, you will love them.

Really great!!! I substituted chicken legs for wings and let it marinate 6 hours. From reading the reviews I used the left over sauce, added corn starch, heated well, and poured it over the cooked chicken. Served with sesame seeds. Really really good! I will be making this a lot! Next time on the grill.

I was a little disappointed when I made these.  If I do make them again I will definitely use low sodium soy sauce as I thought these were much to salty for my personal taste.  They also turned a lot darker, almost black than the picture shown.

I followed the ingredients exactly, but marinated for about 8 hrs instead. After the 50 minutes, my wings looked pale and the skins were soft. I don't find that appetizing at all but did taste one and ... YEP! Bland and yucky soggy skins. So... I moved the wings to a cookie sheet, reduced the marinade and brished it on the wings, then broiled for about 5 minutes to give them color and a crispy skin. Much better after doing that, but still...not the best wings out there.

My husband made these and he is a follow everything to the letter kind of guy.  The flavor was really mediocre. It seemed like it needed some sort of citrus, maybe some orange juice or lime or something to counter the molasses.  Overall the flavor was uninspiring and considering how good my hot wings are, I consider this a waste of good wings.

These were very good.  I did a combo of wings and drumsticks on a baking sheet, used ingredients as is, and I didn't marinate, was short on time. Still tasted great. Next time though I will definitely marinate as it could only get better.  Don't forget the wet-naps with these!

Not liked by anybody in the house.  The sauce flavor didnt seem to penetrate the chicken.  A true waste of chicken wings.  Good thing I made a batch of our "normal" wings.

Well it is not often I find a recipe on here that is terrible but this one was not to our liking. Yes that is strong to use but it describes it perfectly for us. We found it to be over powered by the soya sauce. I am rating it exactly as it is suggested without change. I in good conscience can not even give it a 1 star but this system makes us. We found it to be not to our liking.

Wings were delicious!  I, too, thickened the remaining sauce and simmered it to use as additional sauce after baking them.  They were a big hit.

Super-yummy!  But, watch them carefully in the oven.  If they're in too long, the sauce turns VERY sticky-- like glue!  But, the flavor was still out of this world.  :)

I made these for Halloween so did not remove the tips and left them whole. They did not all get eaten but that was probably due to my addition of black food colouring to the marinade which transformed them into bat wings. They made for an awesome plate of food for the Halloween table and I will definitely be making again :)

I am making these for the second time.  I am not doing anything different to it except I don't brush my meats in their own marinade.  Besides I don't think it needs it.  The juices from the chicken can be poured off into a sauce pan and mixed with cornstarch to thicken it up and use for a dipping sauce.  Otherwise its good as is.  10 stars for it!  Delish :-)

I love the sweet and sour flavor.  I didn't have chile sauce so I used chili poweder instead.  It tasted great!

These wings are good, but are not sweet. I could be the blame for this since i did not have any molasses on hand. Also, instead of chili sauce i added crushed red pepper and a few dashes of hot sauce. I will most likely make these again!!

FAN-FLIPPIN-TASTIC! They look great too- an excellent alternative to hot wings. I baked them until they were well done and then threw them in the crockpot without the lid to keep them warm for guests. They were a hit!

Delicious wings!  I was out of molasses, so I left it out.  Also, I added a sprinkle of five spice powder and a drizzle of sesame oil.  I started them the day before I needed them and let them marinade overnight so they really soaked up the flavors.  I will definitely make these again.

This recipe is soooo good!  I used fresh ginger and took the advice of cooking down the marinade, it came out nice and sticky.  I didn't have the chile sauce on hand and there are a lot of options in the grocery store so I went to the chinese section and bought ground fresh chili paste.  (Be careful, the sauce didn't taste all that hot until after it was cooked down.)  I used 5 teaspoons and the wings had great kick to them...perfect with a nice cold beer on Superbowl Sunday.

Very yummy.  I omitted the molasses (my husband doesn't care for things to be extra sweet), and I was out of chili sauce so I just used some chili powder instead.  They turned out wonderful, and I'll definatly be using this recipe again!

These came out so tasty and delicous that I couldn't stop eating them.  I used the skinless gourmettes.  I did not have molasses and just left it out.  I put 4 cloves of garlic, fresh ginger, and added 1/4 cup of Red Devil hot pepper sauce (gave it a zing - not too spicy).  After marinating for 2 hours, I baked the wings with only 1/4 of the sauce.  The rest I boiled on the stove for 15-20 minutes and added a little cornstarch (w/ cold water) to thicken it up.  I poured the thick sauce only for the last 5 minutes of baking.  YUMMY!!!

Nice wings! I was looking for a wing recipe that didn't include frying and this caught my eye! I didn't have molasses and used Five Spice instead of the ginger. I added extra garlic and marinated the wings for about 24 hours. Like Linda, I wanted to crisp them up a bit, but did that at the end of baking and turned on the broiler, turning them after about 5 minutes. Following ADLEVINE's suggestion, I sprinkled with sesame seeds. Yum! Thanks Christenet!

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts strips and I put them on the grill. My husband and son really liked them. I'm no a fan of bird but I did think they were pretty good. I think I would like to try them in the oven as directed just to see if they are any better.

I thought this was going to be an awesome recipe by all the great reveiws or Maybe I just didn't make it correctly but I did follow the recipe as stated and my husband and I didn't care for it at all. Very bland tasting and mostly all I can taste was the chicken meat itself not really any of the flavoring.

These were so good - definitely not spicy though if that's what you're looking for. I marinated them for the whole morning/afternoon, and then baked them on a cookie sheet lined with foil. As suggested by other reviewers, I took the extra marinade - boiled it for a couple minutes, added a little cornstarch dissolved in cold water, and thickened the sauce. When the wings were almost done, I poured the extra sauce on top and let them bake a little longer. Yummy! I did substitute pure maple syrup for the molasses and added a tablespoon of tabasco.

These wings were really really good.  I made about 8 lbs of wings, so here's what i used:  1-1/3 cup soy sauce, 1-1/3 cup honey, 1/3 cup chili garlic sauce, 2/3 cup molasses, 1/2 tsp ginger (we don't really like ginger), and 3 cloves garlic.  I made this like so:  I baked the wings with a little garlic salt and pepper on them at 375 degrees for 35-40 minutes (make sure you use fast-release foil).  While the wings were baking I made the sauce with the above-ingredients.  I boiled in a pot.  Make sure you don't allow this mixture to boil over (it makes a mess!!) and simmer for about 10 minutes.  Put the cooked wings into a crock pot and add the sauce mix.  Stir, and keep on low till you need them.  I had them for a party today, and they were on low for about 2 hours.  YUMMY!!!  Everybody at the party loved them!!

I guess I was expecting something great from all the rave reviews...so I was a little dissapointed.  The wings were good, but not sensational.  It just seemed like a lot of ingredients, work, and time could have been saved by buying a good bottled teriyaki sauce.  I made the recipe exactly as written, and found it tasted like ordinary teriyaki wings.

When I first took the wings out of the oven I was disappointed, they looked burned and dry. After I tasted them I realized they were supposed to look that way !! They were delicious, I made them for my daughter's B-day BBQ. Several people asked for some to take home and for the recipe. However, when I make them again, I will try a deeper pan to see if they don't look so dry next time. Looks are decieving, tasted great.

These are quite beautiful when they're done, but I found that the flavor didn't penetrate the meat as much as I would have liked. I'll probably give them another shot and marinate them a little longer before cooking them.

Excellent and simple marinade. The addition of the seasame seeds was a great suggestion, as was the initial browning in the broiler. Terrific flavor that won rave reviews.

Made as directed except I let them marinate for a few days in a Ziploc. They could've been a little crisper but I know to just stick them under a broiler for a few minutes next time. The flavor was savory and not spicy at all.

These wings were amazing! A friend made these at a Christmas party and they were a hit. I made them again at home and everyone loved them!

This recipe is awesome and, my family constantly asks me to make these wings. I altered the recipe only by adding Srircha sauce as we like them very spicy.

The dish was delicious and very easy to make. The only changes id make would be to let the wings marinate maybe an extra half hour for them to really soak in the sauce. Maybe even use a fork to poke a few holes in each wing for the flavor to get right into the meat. Rice is an excellent side with this dish as it fits the style, and taking the left over sauce that was cooked and putting it into the rice, delicious! Will definitely make again :)

I looved it!!!! I cooked it last night for my bf and I and my only regret will be not cooking a lot lol. I didn't have molasses so I couldn't add that and I also fried my wings because it was too late to bake.but after I fried them I mixed them in the sauce then broiled them for 10 minutes!! I will definitely use this recipe again! Thanks

I used chicken tenders, boiled the leftover marinade on the stove, so I could baste them. Just the right amount of heat.

These were such a hit at the Superbowl party!  And I actually got to see the game while they were cooking, I made the marinade in advance, so easy.  I split the marinade in half and added and extra half cup of chile sauce to one half for some who like it spicier, but both varieties were a hit with everyone! The chicken was so moist and juicy, the molasses is key. I'll be making these again this summer, this recipe is a keeper.

This wings recipe is perfect for those who don't want hot wings (just like the other reviewer said). If you want your wings a little spicy, you may want to add more hot sauce, the 2 TBP of chile sauce that the recipe calls for, cannot be tasted at all.

These are really good. I don't even marinate them, I just put them in the oven on a tin foil covered baking sheet. When they start getting done I turn them and baste them several time with the sauce.
I don't keep molasses or fresh ginger, so I use 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of the molasses and powdered ginger in place of fresh. Then I put a couple of drops of tobassco for a tiny little spice. 
The is one of my most requested recipes for game day!

I marinated the wings for about 5 hours before baking which really infused the flavor. Next time I will marinate over night.   Changes I made due to preference was that I added siracha for head and omitted the honey.  Seemed like the recipe had enough sweetness without.  I thought the wings were delicisious but need to figure out a way to make the skin crisp. Mine were a bit soggy.

My daughter and I made these last night and we thought they were fabulous! My husband loved them also. We did have to change a few things because we either ran short or did not have. We added a small amount of teriyaki sauce as we were short on the soy. We did not have any chili sauce, so we used some red pepper flakes and hot pepper sauce. We definitely ended up marinated longer and maybe that is what makes them so good. I tried to keep brushing more marinate on while baking as well. I liked them so much I ate more than I normally do!

I never seem to plan ahead enough to marinate so instead I make double the sauce and cook the wings in the sauce in the oven.  They come out FABULOUS every time!  These are a favorite every time I bring them.

These were pretty good.  Smells great while cooking.  Made exactly as written.  They came out golden and sticky and my kids loved them.  My hubby and I thought they were a little too sweet, may add something next time to balance out all the sugary flavor, like char-grill seasoning.

Cooked these for SuperBowl party ... used 2 tablespoons of Frank's Sweet Chili sauce instead of recipe chile sauce and did not add honey ... sweet and spicy wings were a hit !  Also good for leftovers....serve with rice.

Just made the marinade....used lite soy sauce and used a bit less then called for; had to add extra chile sauce, brown sugar, a little onion powder, cayenne pepper, and some red pepper flakes to get it just right for us...tasty so far.  I'll update after we bake them.  Baked in a bit of the sauce, which never got "gooey", so poured that off, boiled some on the stove w/cornstarch added, brushed on wings and put under broiler for about 5 min's.  Perfect!!  With the (very minor) tweaks we made, this one's a keeper!

Sooooo good!  I followed the cooking directions and then about 5 minutes before they were done I made a dipping sauce using soy sauce, honey, molasses, chile sauce, garlic and brown sugar. Used corn starch/water mix to thicken it. Wonderful dish! My kids want me to make it more often.

This recipe was excellent.  I prepared 40 pounds of drummettes and wings for my daughter's grad party and they were all gobbled up.  Had many requests for this recipe.  I prepared the drummies the day before and put them in large foil pans in refrig.  I boiled and saved the extra sauce also.  Then reheated drummies in the oven about 2 hours ahead on low and transferred to large roaster for buffet, pouring on extra sauce (need to reheat).  They were the hit food of the party.

YUM!! I'm not into hot food - so was happy to find this recipe. Made them exactly as stated. I used 5 lbs. of wings so I doubled the sauce. This gave me extra to drizzle on top of some brown rice. I also made "Mom's Cole Slaw" (next time I will try the healthy version) - "Juicy Grilled Corn on the Cob" (which by the way is great) and some breadsticks It was a ALLRECIPIES.COM night!!! I LOVE allrecipies and I'm very thankful to all the people that share!

My hubby loved thes. I marinated these for about 3 hours and then baked them. I also added 2 tblsp. of cornstarch to cold water and added that mixture to the marinade after boiling it and thickened the sauce so that i can pour it on top of the chicken after baking! Very yummy!!! Thank you!!!!

Sorry, but these wings just didn't taste!  I had to fumble around with the sauce to add something before I took them to a Super Bowl party!

AWESOME! I was a little apprehensive at first about this recipe, but it was amazing.  My husband is a picky eater and was licking his fingers and our bar rat neighbor (who I'm sure has he eaten his share of wings in his life) said they were the best he'd ever had.  I did marinate for four hours and set temp to 450 F for the last 15 minutes otherwise followed recipe exactly!

My husband and I thought these were bland.I marinaded them overnight. I baked them in the extra marinade. The meat was tender, the flavor just wasn't there. I gave it 2 stars because the meat was tender and they did brown nicely.

These wings are the best I have had. My family and friends devour them! One thing that I might add to make the clean-up easier is to bake in a disposable aluminum pan. I marinade them then put the chicken with all of the sauce in the aluminum pan and bake all together. They end up absorbing all of the marinda and develop a deep "mahogany" color...hence the name! Thanks for this great recipe!!!

This recipe is very easy and has some Great Taste!! I added a twist to it once the wings were almost done I put them in the crock pot for the last few minutes of cooking. I have fixed it twice and both times I got great reviews.  LH

I think these were so easy to make and a yummy recipe for a change to the standard fried chicken wing!  I did bake them in the marinade and turned them several times during cooking. It kept them moist and yummy! Thanks for sharing!

Followed the instructions- PERFECT! I added a few dashes of Louisiana hot sauce for a bit of heat.  I also baked the wings with a bunch of sliced jalapenos!  OMG they were great.  My wife ordered me to cook them once a week now! haha    Just a side note: if you are crazy about Sriracha "Rooster Sauce" like I am, it is PERFECT with these wings!

This was one of the first recipes I tried from allrecipes. My husband loves wings and loved them!  Didn't change anything the first time, but have since added more chili sauce or chinese 5 spices to add more of an Asian taste to it. Great!

I made these this weekend for my sister's baby shower and they were a huge hit! I followed the recipe exactly, but I did marinate them for several hours before putting them in the oven. I might never fry wings again! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! I would recommend 'fancy' molasses as opposed to other types. Makes the wings a bit sweeter and compliments the spice very nicely. A family favourite!

These were very good! During the last 15 minutes of cooking time, I took out most of the sauce and put it in a skillet. Then I added a little flour and water to thicken it up. Then I poured that over the wings and then broiled them until nice and crispy. The sauce was very flavorful and sticky!

These are a hit every time. We have made them for several cookouts and parties. We spice them up with extra chili sauce. We also like to bake them the day before. Refridgerate and then cook on the grill with low hear. Very good!

These wings are fabulous!  I doubled the amount of wings and tripled the sauce.  Once the wings were done marinating, I boiled it up, thickened it and used it for basting and also to put over top of rice.  You can not go wrong with this recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us!

Everyone at our super bowl party enjoyed these, they are very sticky but the flavor has a nice kick and they were quite easy so I will probably make them again.
I marinated them overnight and then baked them for 3/4 of the time, broiling the last few which crisped them up a bit. I also boiled the marinade like others did and added a bit of orange juice (it needed some kind of citrus). Reducing the sauce and tossing it with the wings makes all the difference, otherwise they lack the kick from the flavoring.

I LOVE this recipe. I have made it for years. Its a special super bowl meal I make every year. Everyone loves them. I marinade them over night and grate up the ginger. I've also used all the same ingredients but instead of wings, put them in a slow cooker with chicken breast. The result is a succulent and sweet chicken for a great dinner.

Love this! I prepared these for a bunch of girlfriends last summer, and they gobbled them up. My finicky husband even ate these and agreed they were good. I prefer drumsticks personally, but wings are great too. We didn't have chile sauce, so I substituted it with 1/4 c. of Sweet Baby Ray's Hot Wing sauce. Turned out great.

This was a hard one to review. I would honestly give it 4.5 stars.  The overall taste was good, but seemed sort of muted.  Next time my husband and I agreed that we would remove the skin before marinating and add a couple of shakes of red pepper or hot sauce.

As others have stated-this is a keeper!!! I used boneless breast of chicken cut into stips.  Prior to cooking the chicken I drained the sauce/marinade in a saute pan and boiled for 30-40 min untill it reduced to a nice thick glaze-it is imperative that the glaze boil to this thickness or you will not obtain a "wow" taste.  Then when the chicken was done I poured that thick yummy sauce over the chicken coating all the pieces.  This was a huge hit!!!

These were good just coming out of the oven but by the next day they were just okay.    2nd attempt (8/25) - The taste is very good but the problem I have is that the sauce does not stick well or thicken up.  I finally let them cook for quite awhile trying to get the sauce to thicken up and then I also ended up putting them on the grill.  That worked but not quite sure it was worth it.

Loved this marinade.  Use it all the time. My favorite cut of chicken to use it on are thighs (skinless - trying to be somewhat healthy and retain the most amount of flavor).  Marinate over night and it is the best on the grill!

Very easy to prepare,and the taste was wonderful.It was a big hit with my family.  I actually used drummettes, and it turned out just as well. You may have to shorten the bake time if using drummettes. I'll definitely try this recipe again. It was a tasty change of pace. Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made this many times and every time was a complete success. I have used wings and breast tenders cut in half. I marinate overnight and bake. Everyone wants the recipe. Even children love it. I would never change a thing.  YUMMY!!!!

The first time I made this I didn't have molassas, and used brown sugar instead, and it was just as delicious as when I used the molassas.

Every time I make this I add some DRY SHERRY and would highly recommend this addition! It is just fabulous!

I serve this over brown rice (cooked w/ chicken broth) and spinach. I also do this in the crock pot! 

Yummy...and great for company!

Didn't have wings so used boneless skinless thighs and marinated for 10 minutes. I used Kikoman chili-garlic sauce, all other ingredients as listed.  I poured the remaining marinade over the chicken as I turned it, I cooked the thighs for a total of 30 minutes.  The result was moist and delicious - we absolutely loved it! (served w/white rice and a little of the juice poured over)  Will make again and again!  Do try this recipe!!!

Extremely tasty and easy recipe.  Due to time constraints we were unable to marinate the chicken so I cooked the chicken in the sauce for first 30 minutes turning occasionally then broiled at the end to make the sauce nice and sticky.

When I tasted the sauce before cooking the wings I was worried it had too much of a molasses taste,but they were wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!

The marinade/sauce was tasty.  But I felt the skin was rubbery.  Maybe grilling this chicken would be better, or use a skinless cut of chicken.  Or even cooking on broiling pan instead.  I did simmer the remaining marinade and added cornstarch slury to thicken.

I actually tweaked this recipe a bit and my husband said on a scale from 1-5 it was a 7!  I basically just added 1/4 cup oyster sauce, instead of chilli sauce I subbed in Sambal Oleke and added 4 tbsp thai garlic chilli sauce.  Then I kept the wings in the sauce after marinading for cooking for 40 minutes. At that point I put them to a separate baking pan and drizzled only a little sauce on them and baked for a further 20 minutes.  While baking those I took the remainder of the sauce and heated it on a burner.  I then added some cornstarch to water and then added that to the sauce pan and stirred until thick and served this as a dipping sauce with the wings.  PHENOMINAL!  Thanks for this recipe.  Hub asked that I make this for everyone when they come out.

I thought these turned out great!  I have been looking for a good recipe for Teriyaki Wings and these are it!  I didnt have any chili paste but that is the only thing I left out.  I also marinated the chicken all morning and afternoon.  I followed other posters advice and added cornstarch to the leftover sauce.  I then basted with it and there was no need to have extra for dipping because it got nice and sticky and clung to the wings.  If you want a change of pace from hot wings and like the taste of teriyaki, try this.  But I really would suggest the longer marinade time to really infuse the taste into the chicken.  Thanks for a great recipe!

wow this sauce is really good!.  I used it on chicken legs and not wings, and i think this sauce would be wonderful on large pices of chicken and put on the BBQ.  Which we will be trying next.
Some posters say that this sauce is a waste of time and can be easily bought in a bottle.  I don't think anything is easier then this sauce, takes 2 minutes to mix together, and you don't get all the additives and junk that you would get from a store bought sauce.
This is realy good, DH and I both love it a lot.

This is an excellent recipe and very easy.  My fiance requested this for the SuperBowl and I started marinating it the day before. The ingredients can be changed and the taste is still good. Make sure you lay aluminum foil down and PAM everything down before you place the chicken in.

The was my first time making wings, they looked spectacular! and the taste?  well, i had to beat the kids off to save some for my husband.  I didn't have the molasses so i omitted it and increased the chili sauce accordingly.  I put them under the broiler for about 5 mins at the end of the cooking time.  Almost too beautiful to eat!

Just tried these out and they were fabulous.  However, since I grill most everything I cook, I grilled the wings with indirect-medium heat for approx 40 minutes turning over and basting every 10 minutes.  Then for 10 more minutes I grilled the wings over direct-low heat basting one more time.  This made the outside of the wings very gooey with an intense flavor.

I made this for my office potluck and it quickly disappeared.  I wanted something meatier than wings so I substituted drummettes instead.  I added 20 minutes longer cooking time to compensate.

Excellent. They had so much flavor. I drained the marinade (after 7 hours or so) and then boiled it and thickened as another reviewer suggested. I found we really didn't even need the extra sauce. What was left on the wings was perfect. Really good. Will keep this recipe for a long time!!

I made these last week  and I thought they were pretty good. I marinated them overnight so they had a lot of flavor, and I decided to bake them in their sauce.  After reading the ingredients and mixing everything, I was hoping the marinade would be thick and make the wings kind of gooey, but after cooking it was clear that it was just a flavorfull liquid not meant to coat them.  So overall I thought they had good flavor, but next time I'll try to thicken the sauce.

I was a little concerned with the smell after mixing all of the ingredients, but before long my kitchen smelled just wonderful.  These wings were .......mmmmmmm good.  My husband loved them as well!!  This is a keeper, will use again with other parts of the chicken.

These wings were wonderful!  My husband barbecued them though so they weren't as good as I think they'll be when we do them in the oven next time.  Our guests enjoyed though!

These where really good but I also would recommend using a disposable pan. I lined mine with foil, but the marinade seeped under it and coated the pan. I soaked it for 2 straight days changing the water and soap at least 3 times a day and still not clean. Had to throw away a perfectly good (and one of my favorite) pans.

These were very good; a nice change from Buffalo style. I did double the sweet chili sauce to kick it up a bit.   Just wish the sauce was thicker.

I did not marinate these near enough and I already like these. I am sure it will be even better when I marinate it long enough. Love the depth of flavour imparted y the molasses. Good change from a regular teriyaki type wings.

Followed the directions exactly as follows and they turned out great! I used crystal hot sauce in the crock pot and used franks red hot after baking  because that's all the hot sauce I had in the house. I pulled the wings out 5 minutes early, make sure to keep an eye I'm them. Meat was fall off the bone!

I love this recipe because it is so fast to prepare.  For the chili sauce I used my favorite Siracha.  I also had to bake it much about 30 minutes longer than instructed.  They came out slightly caramalized and the meat just pulled off the bone.  It was delicious!  This recipe is a keeper!

I made these to take to a get together and they were a hit. I would have preferred for them to be a bit sweeter, but overall the flavor was very good. For presentation, I put them on a platter and sprinkled with green onion which I cut on the bias.

This was really tasty.  I used it on chicken thighs and legs instead of wings.  I reduced the chile paste to 1 Tbsp. because I don't like things spicy, but in hindsight, I could have used 2 Tbs and it would have been OK.

The sauce is good, just a few tips: After baking the wings for 50 minutes in the oven, I then transferred them to a cookie sheet and threw them back in the oven for about 5-7 minutes. It gave them an extra crunch. I sprinkled sesame seeds to on top before serving as well.

Fantastic wings!  I added some extra garlic and subbed 1/4 c of the honey for real maple syrup (because I was running low).  I also used franks red hot sauce for the chile sauce.  They were pleasantly sweet, with just enough of a kick from the hot sauce.  :~)

This was abig hit with the harvest crew this year. my only suggestion is cook the wings in the marinade then you dont have to worrry about basting them, and add corstarch so that it is a bit thicker that way, when it coats the wings it stick to them a bit better.

These wings were really tastey. However, I couldn't bare to use the left over marinade as a dipping sauce...much too sweet. Although to my surprise, that extreme sweetness did not over power the wings I would make this again...but altered by way of cutting down on the honey and molasses. I loved the color of those wings. Thanks for the recipe!

I was skeptical when I put these in the oven. The glaze was bland looking and thin and didn't appear to be sticking to the chicken. But during the baking process, the glaze thickened and browned and created a delicious coating for the wings. This will become a new regular on my menu rotation.

I thought these were delicious even though I felt the molasses taste was really strong. I will make these again using less molasses and fresh Ginger, as I had used dry ground ginger and thought fresh would probably be better

Made as-is.  My oldest two kids really liked it.  The sauce was fairly runny, so next time I may try boiling the sauce with some cornstarch to thicken, after the chicken is done.  With thicker sauce, I would give it 5 stars.

I was looking for a way to serve gluten-free chicken wings, and found this recipe.  I used the San-J Gluten-free soy sauce in this recipe, and it worked great (if you weren't aware, regular soy sauce has wheat in it).  I made these for Superbowl Sunday, and the whole crowd gobbled them up.  I saved a few for my husband and me to enjoy later (since I had a feeling they'd all be gone during the football game), and they reheated beautifully - very moist and flavorful.   I did take the advice to boil and reduce the left-over marinade, then I poured it over the wings right before I served them.  The sauce was thick and fabulous.  This recipe is going to be used a lot.  Thanks for making it available here!

Wonderful. I served them at a dinner party, and they were devoured. Definately take the time to add the sesame seeds. It's a visual dish. The hardest part was cutting up the chicken, although I heard you could buy those already cut.

I tasted the sauce prior and agree with others, too salty, had to add a lot or brown sugar, and a little sesame oil to give them a kick, even then the proportion of sweet could be better, I am going to try  it again though.

Delicious sauce.  I didn't use molassas (didn't have any) but substituted dark corn syrup (about 1/4 cup) and just added an extra 1/4 c honey.  My entire family loved this.  My boys especially like the sauce over their rice.  I'll be making the sauce frequently I think

I followed the recipe exactly and they were fabulous! The flavor reminded me of some chicken I ate in Hawaii once. I served them with fried rice but I think they'd pretty much go well with anything such as steamed rice or some kind of potatoes.  One reviewer here added Franks Red Hot and some other ingredients to this recipe and that sounds good too. I may try that next time. I can honestly recommend this one.

Great recipe - everyone loved the wings. I added a couple TBSP sugar to the sauce because my taste test left me thinking it may be too salty. I also breaded the wings in flour and browned them in a frying pan before putting in the oven just because I prefer wings that way. I will make them again.

Delicious. I did not have any molasses but the sauce was still excellent. Instead of deep frying...I shook my wings around in a mixture of flour, onion pdr, garlic pdr and cayenne. Then put on a baking sheet and refrigerated for an hour. Then bake at 400 for 45 min. Take wings out and toss in sauce and then bake another 10 min. Delicious!

WOW - Great.  I cooked the wings at 375 for 1 hour naked.  Flipped them over and cooked for another 10-15 min.  Then tossed them in the sauce.  I did mix the sauce over heat on the stove and added a little corn starch to thicken the sauce so it would really stick to the wings.  My husband said not 'really good' they were 'excellent'.  I cook every night and I have never gotten an excellent!!!

scrumptious!!! The whole family loved them! I didnt change anything until the end. When I took them out of the oven, I removed the wings and poured the sauce into a saucepan and added a tsp or 2 of cornstarch and brought it to a boil (then reduce heat) while whisking constantly. After thickening for a couple minutes I poured back over the wings for a thick sticky yumminess!

These were good. They did not quite have the specific flavour I was looking for, as I was looking for a very sweet flavour. These were sweet, but had some kick to them. The sauce turned out very well, nice and thick and sticky. I marinated the wings over night and then baked on a cookie sheet with the sauce poured over them. I will probably make these again.

I had such high hopes for this.  The marinade smelled and tasted great when I made it.  I let the chicken marinate overnight.  The taste was just too dark for me.  I'm sure it was the molasses. At the same time the flavor needed some kind of kick, it was a bit boring and it did not penetrate the meat of the chicken whatsoever.

Excellent! I doubled the marinade recipe and reserved 1c. of marinade.  When the wings were almost done cooking, I put reserved marinade in a sauce pan and thickened for about 10 mins on low heat.  When the wings were done I put them on the serving dish and poured thickened marinade over the top! Wow!

I made these last night for dinner and we loved the flavor, but I had an issue with cooking time.  I marinated the wings all day, lined a baking sheet with foil, which I greased, and cooked them for 25 minutes.  I then turned them, basted them and returned to oven for an additional 25 minutes.  After about 10 minutes, the marinade started to burn.  The wings were done (some burnt).  I guess if you put all the marinade in a deeper dish with the wings it would help with the burning issue but I would think the wings would be soggy cooking in liquid.  To serve with this, I reduced the remaining marinade and sauteed onion and diced red bell pepper.  I added the marinade and pepper/onion sautee to a pot of cooked white rice along with toasted seaseme seeds which I also sprinkled over the finished wings.  Overall, very good meal and I would definately make again, adjusting cooking time.    August 27, 2009  I made these again tonight, thinking I had found a new recipe until I started to review and saw my review from June!  So consider this an update.....I must have decided by reading the recipe I needed to adjust the cooking time this time around.  Marinated wings about 3 hours moved to baking dish and cooked 40 minutes basting about half way through with marinade.  Removed wings from baking dish, placed on baking sheet and broiled for about 2 minutes....they were not burnt but the marinade does make the wings darker in color than my 9 year old liked.  I did add a splash of orange ju

these wings are great. super sticky and messy in a good way. i never have molasses around so i just add a little simple syrup (2 parts sugar dissolved in 1 part water) instead...it probably doesn't even need it to taste good though.

A very good recipe for chicken wings.  I didn't have chili sauce so I substituted ketchup instead.  This worked out for us as my kids don't enjoy anything with a 'kick'.   Good to know ketchup can be used if necessary.

I found these a bit too "goopy".  Maybe that is how they are meant to be with the thick sauce, but not our favourite.

This was very good.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because only one hour in the marinade was not enough.  It didn't have much flavor, but what it did have was goon.  Next time I will put it in the marinade several hours before or maybe even over night.

The Mahogany Chicken wings are awesome.  It is a great way to spice of baked chicken. I followed the recipe exeactly and I am so glad I did.  This is truly a dish that will become a regular in my home.

We were looking for a wing recipe that wasn't fried, wasn't BBQ or buffalo.  We made one pan of these, and one of Candied Garlic Wings.  Everybody preferred these, our 15 year old son ate every one he could find then asked for more.  Amazing, and I'm not much of a fan of wings myself.

Ohhh sooooo good! This recipe is fun and forgiving. I didn't have molasses either but used maple syrup instead.  Added a couple drops of hot sauce too.  I cut chicken breasts into strips and marinated them in this for 3-4 hours. Baked them off in the oven and served with rice and steamed snowpeas.  You must try this recipe!

Well they were gone before I could even have one so that should tell you.  I did try one when they came out of the oven and it was good.  I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter except I used Ginger/Garlic paste instead (2 Teaspoons).  I also cooked the sauce down after I took the chicken out and took about a 1/4 out and mixed in 1 Tbsp of corn starch with that and then added it back to the sauce to make it think.  I used this for basting the wings while they were cooking and for dipping when I served them.  I also cooked them on a foiled lined cookie sheet with a lip and put a baking cooling rack over that and out the wings on the rack so they would stay crispy.  I cooked them the allotted time and turned/basted them every 15 minutes.  Really good.  Not too sweet.  Next time I may add some crushed red pepper flakes to give it a kick.  Happy Cooking

I appreciate knowing how long to bake wings and at what temperature, but I probably won't use this marinade again. The wings were nicely glazed and sticky, but I found the molasses flavour overpowering (and I really like molasses, even ate some with bread 'n' butter while I waited for the wings to cook!) Also found them a bit too salty; perhaps low-sodium or less soya sauce?

These were fantastic! We made a few adjustments:
:: Added 1 extra TBLS of chili sauce for a bit more kick
:: Marinated the wings for 3 hours, instead of 1
:: Broiled for 2 minutes at the end

Be sure to use foil or some other lining - the sauce really bakes on to your dish towards the end.

Thanks for sharing this dish!

These were the best.  The only change I made was I did not brush them in the end.  I just took them off the pan & served them.  They were a great hit here.  Thank you for great recipes.

The taste and color of these wings is superb. This recipe is  a great option when spicy buffalo style isn't appropriate. I'm sure these will become a staple for me.

Finger licking good!!! I made it with chicken the 1st time.  2nd time around I tried it with country style pork ribs  and cooked it in the crockpot on low for 1 1/2 - 2hrs (and reserved some marinade aside).  Then drained it afterwards and bbq'd for a couple mins  coating it with the rest of the marinade on each side. Wow!!!  Both chicken and pork go great with these seasoning ingredients.

These were good.  I did add about 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes for a little zip, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I found that they needed to bake for one hour at 400, then I broiled the wings for a couple of minutes to crisp them up a bit.

I stumbled upon this recipe a few years ago. It's always a big hit at parties. In lieu of Heinz chili sauce, I now substitute an asian chili sauce (plastic jar with a green lid in the international aisle). The flavor from the molasses and the heat from the chilis is well balanced and "makes" the recipe... Fantastic!

Lovely sweet and sticky wings!  I substituted dark brown sugar for the molasses, and reserved half of the marinate for brushing over the wings while they baked.  This way they weren't in contact with the raw meat.  Great recipe.

I don't know, I usually really enjoy Asian influnced dishes but the soy sauce was WAY overpowering.  I couldn't taste the honey or molasses at all all I could taste was soy sauce.  Very disappointing considering the time and ingredents used.

The only change that I made was that I didn't have any chili paste, so I added brown sugar.  It thickened the sauce a bit and the wings were sweet and tangy when they were finished.  A big hit with the family!

Excellent!  I always like to make a couple different kinds of wings to suit people's different tastes and this recipe has been added to the list. I used fresh ginger (just put a chunk through the garlic press) and baked on a foil-lined baking sheet.  Very flavorful and messy - just like chicken wings should be!

I made these exactly as directed.  They were good, but not "the best!"  They need a little something in the sauce, and the skin was a little rubbery.

Wow these were wonderful.  I used skinless chicken legs and added orange juice to the marinade.  I also cooked the sauce down and added corn starch to thicken, and poured the sauce over the legs when they came out of the oven.  My daughter who ignores the meat on her plate at the meat first.

These were fantastic ... cooked them on the grill while tailgating at a football game ... they disappeared very quickly and I had requests to make them again next time.  I used hot chili sauce instead of sweet and it gave these the special kick they were looking for!  You won't be disappointed with this recipe!!

These are fantastic!!! I would probably next time double the batch of the marinade so the wings are submerged in the sauce. I also let them soak overnight and I think gave them more flavor. They go fast so make plenty!

I thought these would have more flavor, especially from the smell in the house when I cooked them.  They were pretty good, just not flavorful enough.  I doubled the recipe and used 6 pounds of chicken.  I may double the recipe and use 3 pounds if I ever make these again.

Great recipe! I made this with boneless, skinless chicken thighs, marinated for about 1/2 hour; baked one side for 15 minutes at 375 degrees, turned, baked other side for 10 minutes. While baking for the 10 minutes, I boiled the remaining marinate and added 3 T. cornstarch/1/2 c. icewater mixture to thicken sauce as suggested by others.  Turned the chicken back to the first side, spread a thin layer of thickened sauce on top of chicken and broiled for 3-5 minutes.  Yummy!  Thanks for a great sauce!

These were super easy to make. I marinated them overnight. Other reviewers remarked on the mess so I used pan spray and aluminum foil in the pan. I took them to a Super Bowl potluck and they were enjoyed but no rave reviews.

Did not like this at all. Had a funny taste to it. I did follow the recipe exactly. Out of 6 people in my family, only 2 ate these. My husband who eats anything, and 1 of my children. Will not make this again.

I modified this recipe in the following way.  Instead of chicken wings, I used drum sticks.  I also cooked them in a deep fat fryer, instead of in the oven.  I used the rest of the ingredients to make a dipping sauce.  This came out very tasty!

These were very very good, very easy and quite tasty. I used asian chile sauce with minced garlic and still added the full amount of garlic. I used ginger paste. My husband and son LOVED these. So much so, that this only fed 3 of us with no leftovers. They had a little heat from the chile paste, but these aren't really "hot wings" in the traditional sense. My family suggested I thicken the marinade and turn it into a dipping sauce. I agree, it would make this dish even better! This would be perfect with some rice to soak up the wonderful sauce. Will keep this one in my file for sure. Something different than hot wings. Thanks, these are awesome!!!

These were great! The sauce is bold and flavorful. I made them for a potluck and they were gone pretty quick. I will make these again!

This is different but in a good way.  The kids loved them but my husband on the other hand says it was okay.  I took advice of another and cooked down the remaining marinade and basted the wings close to the end of cooking.  Very good.

I used chicken thighs and served this with rice and green beans. Great- dh really liked it. Next time I would thicken sauce with some cornstarch and serve over chicken - would be five stars for me if stuck a little better, kind of ran off a bit. Thanks - will use again!

Had to modify a bit out of necessity.  Ran out of soy...only had 2 tbsp. so added enough oyster sauce to equal the soy portion of the recipe.  Also added 1 tsp. garlic powder as well as the crushed.  1 tsp. sesame oil to the marinade(love the taste) I did make a cornstarch slurry to thicken sauce to serve on the side.  I loved the smell of the marinade and the house smelled wonderful when they were in the oven.  Threw some sesame seeds on top the last 10 minutes or so.  Really great recipe.  I let them marinate all day.

Fantastic.  I followed the recipe just as written but let the wings marinate for about half a day, and they were outstanding.  A nice combination of sweet and spicy.  Thanks!

This recipe was so easy to follow and it turned out great! My husband loved this one. I think next time I would double the sauce and cover with foil the last 15mins so it can be a little more tender. I will make this one again, it would be perfect to serve at parties. Thank you so much for this recipe.

The marinade for these chicken wings is
exceptional.  I made these wings for a football party today, and they were a huge hit.  I marinaded the wings overnight for extra flavor.  The only change I made to the recipe was to grill the wings instead of baking them in the oven.  While grilling, I basted them with the marinade. These are truly delicious!

This recipe was okay, but I was hoping for a more sweet and savory flavor. I marinated overnight, used maple syrup instead of molasses, but the flavor still didn't 'pop'.

My husband LOVED these.  After baking, I poured the sauce into a saucepan and thickened with cornstarch, then poured it on top of the wings.  I wasn't sure what "chili sauce" they wanted me to use, but I used Tobasco sauce and it was PERFECT! It gave them just enough kick without being too hot.

Great flavor.  I marinated it for a couple of hours and used chicken legs.  They soaked it up very well.  I also added a little cheyanne pepper and crushed red pepper for some spice.  I grilled the chicken legs instead of baking for about 20 minutes on low temp.  They turned out terrific.

These came out looking nice, but just too sweet and not enough spice for our taste.  Might try again with more chili sauce, 1/4 cup honey, and some hot sauce.

I thought this was good.  I prepared it pretty much the way the recipe called out. I used a disposable, shallow roasting pan. And at the end of baking I turned on the broiler for a few minutes on each side.  This made them crispier. I also thickened the sauce with cornstarch and water mixture.

These are delicious, and the recipe is a good  cooking guideline for trying wings with other sauces. Do yourself a favor and be sure to line your baking pan with foil, since some of that sauce can be a chore to scrub off later.

I marinated the wings for 3 hours and still felt like the flavors didn't get into the chicken meat. I initially browned each side of the wings in the broiler (5 minutes per side), then reduced the heat to 375 F for about 50 minutes. I thickened the sauce with cornstarch (as suggested by one reviewer) and used it for basting. I reserved some sauce for dipping. The cooked sauce was just too sweet and all the marinating, basting and sauce thickening wasn't worth it when you can buy some ready made sweet/spicy wings in the supermarkets.

This was really good, I doubled the recipe and added 2 tsp. cayenne pepper and doubled the chili sauce and 1 tbsp of Tabasco. I didn't have molasses so I used maple syrup which worked better as it did not make it as sticky as the molasses did. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe for sweet wings.  I too altered the cooking method as noted in a previous review.  Cooking the wings without basting them and heating the remaining marinade on top of the stove.  You will need a ton of napkins.  I also ran out of honey last time and substituted maple syrup -- they were great.  There is never a wing left with my kids (5,7,9) eating the most!

This was a great recipe!  Next time, I probably won't put as much ginger.  Used chicken breasts and it still turned out pretty good!

I made these to copy a recipe my mother used to make as an appetizer for holidays and parties when I was a child. They came out good but a little too salty for my taste but I will try them again

I made the recipe exactly as  written.   Simple, straightforward and delicious. The meat was tender, the sauce was delicious. After baking as the recipe states, I finished them off by putting them under the broiler to give them a bit of crispness on the skin.

I made these for Super Bowl Sunday.  Having never...I mean never made wings before, I was impressed how easy this was and delicious.  Not too sweet/ not too spicy.  A hit!

This was totally awesome! I've never done chicken wings before...usually go pick them up at Buffalo Wings or Albertsons. But this time, I was looking to do something with the wings I found in the freezer (musta been the wife's purchase) and I chose this recipe. It was better than ANY wings I've bought from people who make wings for a living! I've got me a new favorite recipe!

It was delicious. I substituted maple syrup for molasses because I didn’t have any molasses. I also Added 2tspns of Worcestershire sauce to mixture. And before I coated the chicken in the Mahogany marinade I seasoned the chicken wings with: garlic and onion powder, Thyme, Paprika, lemon pepper but NO SALT (the soy sauce is salty enough) and about 5/6 shakes of Crystal hot sauce. I also baked the wings in the sauce,. So  good! My family made me make this for two nights in a row. My only caution, if you bake these in the marinade, is to make this in one of the throw away aluminum pans because clean up on this (I covered my glass baking dish in tinfoil- still had to soak for 3 days) was MONSTROUS.

What a disappointment! I followed the recipe closely after reading a number of reviews. I used parchment paper as one reviewer suggested as I've found food sticks less to it than foil. I turned the wings over midway through as directed. About 40 minutes into the cooking time I checked again and each wing was surrounded by a pool of burnt goop. I considered moving them to a fresh piece of parchment but it was too late in the game. Not only were the wings lying in the burned marinade - it was stuck to them and could not be removed- leaving a nasty taste. Some of the wings fell apart while I tried to remove them from the mess. 

I am fully aware that any marinade with a sweet substance will burn after a certain amount of time but I didn't see any mention of that in the reviews I read. Maybe someone has a solution? Lower temp? Shortened cooking time? Reduce amount of honey/molasses? 

I loved the idea of these wings but the reality left a lot to be desired.

I went out on a food voyage and tried these the other night. About 5 minutes after eating them, i felt a sharp pain in my lower ab. I think it's the sauce or something. Either way my  was spitting straight goo... DON'T recommend.

I really enjoyed this. I used chicken legs instead of wings. Basted them about 20 mins in and then at the end when resting. I’ll make them again.

Finally, a recipe that truly makes STICKY chicken wings.  Other than baking the wings longer than indicated, I followed the recipe exactly, and the wings were delicious.  This will be my go-to recipe for wings from here on out.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Sorry - not a fan of this one. I used it on chicken tenders instead of wings given I have young children so boneless is easier for them, so maybe that was part of the problem. Made a platter with a variety of options for a get together and these were pretty much untouched. Won't be making again.

I used ingredients exactly as stated. I put the wing pieces in a large ziploc bag and dumped the sauce into the bag. Marinated in the fridge for several hours flipping the bag periodically. Lined a large sheet pan with heavy duty foil and then dumped the whole bag into the pan, sauce and all. I single layered the wings skin side up. I roasted for 20 minutes then turned the wings, roasted for 20 more minutes, turned them again and removed about 1/2 of the remaining sauce from the pan. 10 more minutes and the wings were done, sticky and yummy. Clean up was a breeze because of the foil.

Loved the flavor of this sauce, but found it too thin to stick to the wings. So I cooked it separately, adding 1 T cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cu. of sherry (or water) long enough to reduce it somewhat. Then I poured it into a bowl and used tongs to dip the wings.  I also removed the wings twice during baking to re-dip them.  I baked them for 1 hr and 15 min. @ 350 degrees. They were beautiful and delicious.

I didn't have the full amount of honey, so used ½ tbs. of molasses. Also added one tsp. of soy sauce. Baked for the suggested amount of time, but then placed the wings in a bowl with the sauce, and stirred gently to coat. Placed back in the oven for 5 minutes. Reserved the sauce in the bowl for dipping. Very good!

I made these for Super Bowl 2016 and they were a big hit. I broiled them for a few minutes after cooking for about 1 hour to crisp them up. I also turned the several times during cooking. I will definitely be making these again!

I doubled the recipe and adjusted it slightly. I marinated the wings for several hours (with half the marinade), then cooked for about 1 hour (whole wings) turning halfway through cooking time. I actually refrigerated the wings overnight. The next day, I boiled the remaining marinade to thicken it. About 20 minutes before serving, I poured the thickened marinade over the wings, and broiled about  2 minutes on each side. This will be my go-to for sweet, sticky wings!

Delicious recipe! My Hubby, who is not normally a fan of chicken wings, asks for these often. If the boys are home for dinner I will make half the batch with some hot sauce added just to give it a kick because the boys love spice, but you can't beat the flavour of this sauce!

Great recipe. I use chili powder instead of chile sauce and I double the quantity of chili powder, ginger, and garlic. Also, I use dark brown sugar instead of molasses (I just add a little more of it). I also add some Cajun Seasoning to give it some extra spice. I tend to let it marinate in a ziploc bag in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. I preheat the oven to 430 degrees and cook the wings for 45 minutes. I turn the wings over after being in the oven for 22 minutes. I don't brush the wings with the mixture, I cook them with whatever stays on them when I take them out of the ziploc bag. I sometimes broil them for 2 minutes on each side so that they are a little crispy

Made these for a "wing off" competition at work. Cranked up the heat with hot chili pepper sauce. Prep wings by baking them 30 min. then grilled. Happy to say I was unanimously voted "Wing King" with the best tasting wings! Thanks for the recipe.

I was in a hurry so I used garlic powder and chili powder so I could marinate them as quickly as possible.  These were really tasty.  I have no idea how someone could say no flavor.  They browned nicely too.

Delish!  Didn't have molasses so just omitted that, and it was still wonderful.  I baked at 430 for 45 minutes.  Sprinkled with chopped green onions.  Very tasty.

Very good! Everyone loved them! I added some smoke flavouring for an extra dimension of flavour, and did as others suggested by bringing the sauce to a boil after marinating to kill bacteria and to thicken the sauce.

I just whipped up another batch of these and decided to finally rate this delicious recipe -- we LOVE it! I'd been searching for a baked wing recipe and thought this looked yummy and it didn't disappoint. I always have the ingredients on hand (except the chile sauce which I've never used) so it's hardly any work to make these. I marinate the wings in a gallon storage bag & flip occasionally.

This is a nice alternative to Buffalo-style wings. I used the stated ingredients without making changes. I placed wings and marinade in a gallon size Ziploc bag and marinated several hours. I placed a sheet of non-stick tin foil in the baking dish prior to adding wings. I boiled the marinade and basted wings periodically while baking, turning wings once. Served with blue cheese and ranch dressings. Yum.

Yes, I made the recipe without any ingredient changes...and it was very good. Since my family likes a drier wing, we baked them at 375 for 1 hour and put under the broiler for about 3 minutes.....yum

I made these wings for a tail gate party and were a huge hit. They keep asking me to bring them back each home game. I didn't change a thing. That was unnecessary. I hate it when people change the recipe and then rate their own. Great wangs!!!!

This recipe is amazing!!!!  I used chicken thighs and pan fried them until the skin was crispy, mixed the sauce ingridients and added that to the skillet of chicken and cooked on low until done. Also I added an additional 1/4 cup of honey, only because I didn't use low sodium soy sauce and it was a bit too salty.  The extra honey solved that and it was delicious! Added some chopped scallion and sesame seeds for the finish and the family loved it!

These were pretty good, and different.  I made 3 types of wings for the superbowl and I stuck these in a large ziplock bag overnight to marinate.  They were so gooey and yummy.  They do get pretty dark brown so the name is very appropriate.

Chicken turned out great I used thighs instead next time I'll remove the skin. I followed everything in the recipe but used 1/2 cup light syrup instead of molasses I had none, I added 1 tsp crushed chillies, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 1/2 tbsp of dehydrated onions, and zest from one orange to the recipe. Chicken was marinated over 5hrs. I ended up making another batch of this for the basting. All the chicken was placed on a foiled cookie sheet sprayed with Pam and broiled for about 1hr (turning them occassionally) I had rice going just before they were done and had the 2nd marinate in the saucepan thickening with cornstarch & ice water mix. It came out great it tasted like orange chicken it would've been great on wings or ribs w/ the extra sauce for dipping I'm gonna try that next time. Was pretty good on the plain white rice too. Chicken would've been excellent done on the bbq giving it a smokey taste.

Loved it! For those of you interested in doing this on the grill, just make the sauce on the stovetop and add a bit of cornstarch to thicken, lay aside. Cook your wings on the grill, making sure to char the skin nicely, then reduce heat, cover and bake in the grill until done (15/20 mins). Place on a tray and brush on the sauce generously on both sides. YUUmmm! thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe! What a great flavor this gave my chicken. I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs. Also, I didn't have ground ginger so I used pumpkin pie spice instead. Served the chicken with steamed white rice & poured the juices (left in pan) over the rice. Yummy!!!

My husband liked them, although he thought they could be spicier. They burned very quickly in my oven, although that may be the oven's fault and not the fault of the recipe. Thanks!

We loved these wings.  I wasn't sure what type of chili sauce to use so I left it out for the recipe but served them with asian chili sauce on the side

This recipe made for a  dish at a graduation party. We made one mistake though I think and that was using a crock pot to keep them warm and after awhile it became soupy. The flavor was great and the color a nice brown. I like my wings like from the oven, we made a bunch and my wife was  concerned about keeping them warm- may try it again.

So-so...next time I'll sking the chicken legs before I marinate.  Flavor was pretty good- but, imo, needed a little something more.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was okay.  I didn't love it, but I think it was because the molasses taste was too strong for me.  We ate it anyway, but I likely won't make it again.

I made these for the first time tonight and they were incredible!!!  The only change I made was using chicken tenders instead of wings but I can't wait to get some and try it in them!!  Thank goodness I read the reviews before making them so I used foil to line my pan!!

I loved the sweet taste. Simple ingredients make for tasty wings. I used asian chili sauce instead of a north-american variety.

The flavor was just right for these wings. I enjoyed their tenderness and "fall off the bone" quality, while my boyfriend said he'd like to have us try finding a way to make them "crispier and more like deep fried wings." (I think it's a man thing, wanting to pull the meat off the bone with his teeth? lol)...I will have to fish around in everyone's comments and try a new cooking method. The marinade is delish, though, and easy!

This is one of our favorite family recipes, and I was not a wing eater until we found these.  We usually marinate overnight for the best flavor.  We usually bake in the oven, but have also used the crock pot.  Every time we take these somewhere we get lots of recipe requests!

We really liked this recipe (kids and all).  But my husband said if I had made chicken wings he wouldn't have liked them.  He likes his wings hot-n-spicy and has no desire to try a new marinade.  Luckily, I made chicken legs.  I added 2 TB cornstarch to the sauce and  heated it up until it was thick.  Then marinated for about 4 hours.  I then cooke the legs in the marinade--about 30 minutes covered than 20 minutes uncovered. I served with rice, cooked carrots and cornbread.  My husband said they tasted even better the next day for lunch.

Very, very good. You can really taste the molasses in it, so if you dont really like that flavour, you probably would not like these wings! But if you do, then these are for you!

THIS WAS AWESOME! I made this recipe and i swear the wings did not last 10 minutes. I ended up using ALAGA syrup in it to, I also made extra sauce for dipping with some brown sugar and chhinese five spice added. GREAT as it is!

Very easy, great taste. I did not have the time to let it marinade which was a mistake. The taste I am sure would have been even better if I had. I added a tablespoon of hot oil to the mix for some heat, but it was not enough. I will add some tabasco next time. I baked these almost all the way then threw them on the grill for the last bit.

Excellent.  Did not change the recipe at all. It was so tasty.  The black colour did alarm me when I went to turn them, as they almost looked burned, but they were perfect.

I tried this recipe with bone-in chicken breasts, marinated for 2 hours then cooked in crock pot on high for 4 hrs.  I didn't have enough soy sauce so I use 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce and 1/4 cup fish sauce and it turned out great.  It was very moist and had a mild bite from the sriracha.  The flavor was unique and the house smelled wonderful.  I served it with curried rice and my teenagers loved it!

Tried this recipe last nite for dinner. As mentioned before way too much soy flavor drowned out all the other ingredients. My wings did not even come close to the picture posted with the recipe. Do not think I will fix these again, without adjusting. Thanks anyway

Fantastic... I was looking to try a new, relatively simple chicken wing preparation and came across this one. They came out great, sauce was sticky and flavorful (kids gave this 5 stars all around) and I didn't even marinate for the hour. Highly recc.

Sorry this sounded really good but when I mixed everything together it didnt taste that great and I knew my picky family would turn their nose up to it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe though.  It seems to be fairly popular with others!

Beautiful color and flavor.  I marinated mine overnight.  Like others, I boiled down the sauce and basted the chicken with it and I kept turning them.  I only used 1/4 of soy and used garlic powder because I was too lazy to chop fresh.  My wings only took about 45 minutes.  These will be made again and again.  Thanks

This recipe was awesome!  It had a great flavor with the right amount of sweatness.  I would recommend pouring some of the liquid over the chicken before placing it in the oven to avoid sticking.

This is a really great sauce for chicken.  I had 1.6 pounds of wings but I made a full recipe of the sauce.  I made no changes to the sauce, except I did thicken it to a thicker, syrupy consistency.  I turned once and basted three times.  The sauce has a very good Asian style flavor.  When thickened with cornstarch and cold water, the sauce makes a wonderful mahogany colored coating on the chicken and adds a sweet/spicy Asian flavor to every bite.  Sprinkling with sesame seeds is a very nice addition.    I still like HOT wings the best; however, this is now a staple for grilled chicken breasts.  Many thanks!

This recipe is a definite keeper I'm sure I will make this many more times.  My daughter who is picky ate every bite and was saying yum between mouthfuls...and then there was my 3 year old son who ate his then stole away everyone elses who hadn't downed them so fast...he wanted every last one for himself.  There were no left overs.

Way too much soya sauce (and I like soya sauce).  If I try this again, and I probably won't, I will definitely reduce soya to 1/4 cup and maybe increase honey.

I have never liked chicken wings my whole life. Thought that they weren't worth the time to try and eat them. I thought this was awesome. I have made them 3 times this past month. I have changed it up everytime but I think it is a great recipe. I do boil the chicken before hand and then just pour half the sauce that I thickened up with some cornstarch onto the chicken. Then I bake it as suggested. Halfway through I turn the chicken and spoon on more sauce. This is by far my kids favorite dish. Thanks for the awesome recipe. I am now super mom.

This was pretty awesome!  I used fresh minced ginger and didn't have (and couldn't find!) chile sauce, so I used hoisin sauce.  Clearly not the same thing, but I wanted to stick with the Asian influence.  I used this recipe mainly for the sauce, but I used skinless boneless chicken tenders and then broiled on low for 8-10 min on each side.  Also added cornstarch to the marinade and boiled down to make a sauce (and added a little Chinese Five Spice to it).  I served with brown rice and some veggies and my boyfriend loved it and said he wants me to make it again.  Next time I'll hunt down the chile sauce and I'm sure it will be outstanding!

I found this recipe to be just "ok".  It was good but missing something.  I am not sure what would have made this go from "like" to "love", something with a little spice maybe, to counter all the sweetness.

Pretty good flavor, although after a while the smell of the cooking marinade began to be off-putting. I think if I made them again I'd reduce the molasses to a tablespoon or two--it was responsible for the smell I didn't much care for. Made these for a superbowl party, and they got rave reviews. I followed the recipe until the baking process. I cooked the wings on wire racks in foil-lined cookie sheets, hoping that the elevation would crisp the skin up. I also reduced and thickened the remaining marinade to toss with the finished wings. This worked pretty well--good flavor and texture, but I now have a sink full of sticky dishes. Definitely a special occasions only recipe. One last note--the recipe doesn't specify what kind of chile paste one should add, but Thai chili garlic sauce works well and gives the wings a nice subtle burn.

2/7/10 - Made these again - I cut the molasses down to about a tablespoon, and I thought that was plenty.

These were great!  I did change things up a bit.  I used fresh grated ginger and garlic chili sauce.  I also marinated chicken legs (did not like the look of the wings at the store) over night.  Then I cooked and thickened the marinade and brushed over the legs during cooking.  Nice and sticky and yummy! Thanks for the great recipe!

These were great!  The marinade is very rich, but it caramelizes very nicely.  These were a hit at our Grey Cup party.

Used cocktail sauce instead of chili sauce, everything else exactly the same. My husband loved it, but loves molasses, I thought they were o.k. Biggest complaint is the burned sticky saucy pan.

fantastic alternative to fried wings.  husband and i loved the sweeter taste.  i substituted fresh minced ginger and cooked the wings in the marinade using a pressure cooker for 4-5 minutes at high pressure (15 psi).  wings came out moist and incredibly flavorful.  thanks so much for the recipe!  it's a keeper for us!

Great Recipe! I used boneless skinless thighs, marinated them in a ziploc bag for a couple hours and grilled.  I did not have chile sauce so I substituted 1T garlic chili paste(in asian aisle)  I reduced the marinating liquid and used it as a dipping sauce. (Be sure to cook any liquid which had been in contact with the uncooked meat)

This recipe is great! Perfect for a beginner like myself. Per suggestions, I marinaded it for about four to five hours, and then I boiled the extra marinade. I didn't have shortening to add, so I added a tablespoon of flour and used that to baste the chicken many times while it was cooking. They turned out perfectly sticky, I'm not a fan of baked chicken that comes out overly-greasy. I'm so happy this turned up on the recipe of the day, we will defiantly be making it again.

Yum -- very, very good.  Sticky... but good!  I used Thai chili paste and it gave the wings quite a spicy kick!  Since we didn't have enough wings, I also used some boneless chicken breasts cut into strips, which worked fine, but the sauce definitey sticks better to actual wings/drumsticks.  I would make this again sometime!

These are yummy! I made them for a party and all but two disappeared, and the boys all complimented me on them throughout the night.  Very easy.  I let them marinate overnight because I had the time, and when I was baking them I forgot to turn them at all, but they turned out fine.  I used a disposable foil cookie tray that I put in my pampered chef bar pan.  Delicious!

Our family made four different types of wings for the Super Bowl and this was one of my favorites.  Really good blend of spices and very tasty.  I added just of bit of hot sauce....not much to make it just a little hotter!

Other than using fresh ginger instead of ground, we followed the recipe
as written.  (We also switched to a lite soy sauce.)  We were looking for an alternative to fried wings and were pleased with the results.  Marinate the wings for at least a few hours as others have suggested.

Delicious and a nice alternative to those who are looking for something other than spicy buffalo wings.  I made these for a dinner party that had children in attendance, thinking the kids would like them.  Turns out the adults liked them very much too!
I would suggest spraying the pan with cooking spray, prior to baking, to make cleanup a bit easier.

I substituted in this recipe. i used chili powder and spaghetti sauce. It was still okay-good. I think it would have been a true four ( i couldnt do three and a half so i did four) if they were marinated in the sauce for a longer time.

I made these for my friend's bridal shower for the first time and they turned out awesome and were preferred by everyone over regular hot wings. People thought i was such a great cook! LOL! 

The second time I made these, the molasses burnt even though i followed the recipe very closely. Although I was using a different oven this time so I am assuming that was the culprit. I will definitely try these again.

Good recipe. Good balance of sweet and hot. I pre-fried the wings just a bit. Put in the crock pot and wow pretty good. I did use tobasco instead of chili sauce. I bet this would be wonderful as a steak marinade or like another reviewer said Chicken "big parts" in the crock pot.

These were great.  I marinated over-night for even more intense flavor, cooked on my pampered-chef bar pan (No "turning over" required) for 50 min and they turned out awesome!

These were to die for. I have a great wing recipe that I've enjoyed for years, but these mahogany wings just took their place! Perfect blend of sweet and spicy-- I might even add a little more chili sauce next time. I actually marinated the chicken in the sauce for a few hours, but when I cooked them I forgot to baste with extra sauce. They still turned out marvelous. Will definitely make them again!

These were amazing. I marinated them overnight, the kids gobbled them up the next day. I used maple syrup instead of molasses and I skipped the honey. I also used powdered garlic and 'fresh' chopped ginger. Thanks for the recipe! I'll marinate a batch for the freezer - they were actually fighting over who ate the most wings!

Great recipe !!! Disappeared on New Year's buffet faster than anything else. I thought it was great that I could set these up in the marinade and leave them while I got other things ready. Will make again and again. Easy to prepare in the morning for busy day meals - just come home and pop into the oven.

I used chicken legs instead of wings, doubled the sauce and cooked on low all day in the crook pot.  Didn't use the ginger but added sesame seeds.  Everyone loved it...4 because it really didn't smell very good while it was cooking so maybe this isn't the dish to make for company.  Will make it again though.

Not as flavorful as I had expected from reading all the rave reviews.  The carmelized baked chicken recipe has much more zip to it and I would rather make that one that this.

This recipe is the perfect recipe for people who love chicken wings but can't handle all the hot sauce placed on them in different recipes.  I love Buffalo wings but in the restaurant I often have to order them mild.  This recipe was a good sweet alternative to Buffalo wings.  I used mild chile sauce.  Ortega makes a chile sauce which is made from sweet ancho chiles.  Needless to say the recipe came out superb!  The wings were sweet and tangy with a great ginger smell.  My husband and I loved it!

This was very, very delicious!  I used thighs and the meat just fell off the bone.  I prepared the recipe and ingredients exactly as stated, except used 1 Tbsp. garlic powder instead of garlic cloves.  Definitely use a disposable pan for this one.  Served over rice. I didn't think it was too sweet at all.  Just right! A keeper for sure!

I added a few drops of tobasco sauce to add a little kick to the sweet taste.  Turned out great!  Will use others suggestions on cooking methods next time around.
