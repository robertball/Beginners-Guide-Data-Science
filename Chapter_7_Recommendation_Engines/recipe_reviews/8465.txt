Absolutley fantastic and that is coming from a fan of traditional buttercream icing. I thought the taste of this was delicious and even better was the texture.  It's like a thicker, stiffer whpped cream.  Not as pudding tasting as bavarian cream but not as thin as a whipped cream icing.  Perfect for a strawberry shortcake.  I used it on the Coconut Cream Cake I from this website and the taste was to die for.  My husband brought that cake with this frosting into work and every co-worker asked for the recipe.  And the fact that it takes about 2 minutes to make makes it a 10 star recipe in my book. Another reviewer commented that this is "artificial tasting."  Let's be honest, if you like cool whip you will LOVE this recipe.  If you are expected this to taste like real heavy whipped cream, you are being unrealistic.  I love cool whip; it's light, it's not as fattening and this frosting really holds it's shape well. Not runny at all.

Quick? Yes. Easy? Yes. Sets up well and can be used to frost layer cakes? Yes. Artificial tasting? Yes. With the first bite of cake I frosted with this, hubby said, "Cool Whip." I was embarrassed, and only glad I didn't serve this to anyone where I wanted to make an impression. Just substituting 8 oz. of fresh, whipped cream for the Cool Whip would be a vast improvement. There are few instances where there are any acceptable substitutes for fresh ingredients.

This was exactly what I was looking for.  No one in my family likes the store bought icings which are way too sweet, and I never had any luck with just using whipped cream as it melts away way too fast.  This recipe was just right in between.  Not too sweet and held up well on the cake even icing it the day before and leaving it in the fridge over night.  I used it for a home made birthday cake for my son's 7th birthday party and all the kids loved it. It tasted delicious.  I will definitely use this for all cakes in the future.  Thanks!!

This is one of the best frostings. I got two puddings and 2 cool whips in hopes of making two cakes.  The first batch I made was way too runny for piping so I decided to make the second batch with only 1/2 cup milk.  This was too thick for my liking.  So I combined the two batches together and it was perfect. I found out very quickly that I could not frost the two cakes I panned on making.  I made a two layer cake and also used the frosting for the filling.  I had to go very thin on my cake so I had enough to pipe with.  This worked for this cake because I used crumbled cookies for the sides and cherry pie filling for the top.  So other than desired consistancy and the amount wanted, this frosting tasted fantastic.  When I read other reviews I had to laugh.  If you dont want your frosting to tastes like cool whip or pudding, then do not pick a recipe that only has cool whip and pudding as its ingredients.  Just a suggestion :)

I used this frosting in a double layer chocolate cake.  I used it in the middle and on the outside.  It was so good and very light.  I used half of the amount of milk becuase I wanted it to stick to the outside layering.

I made this with home-made whipped cream...made from mixing (on high) 2 cups of heavy whipping cream, 1 cup powder sugar and 1 tsp or so of good vanilla...and it was sensational.  The only reason I rated this a 4 instead of a 5 is because I made it with real whipped cream instead of nasty store-bought cool whip.  I added red food coloring and refrigerated before frosting my strawberry cake.  It was soooo smooth and easy to handel.  Made a beautiful icing with the perfect whipped consistency.  My guests who ate the cake could not get over this frosting and said it was the quality of a fine bakery.  Thank you so much for this recipe, I will be using this from now on and am looking forward to playing with different puddings and flavors!

This is a very good and easy recipe - thank you.   You can also use different flavors or instant pudding - my latest being white chocolate.   Can also be put in small baked tart shells.   Use your imagination.

I made angel food cupcakes. Then I took this frosting idea and added 2 tsp of strawberry extract and filled the cup cakes then sliced a strawberry in half and put it over the filling hole looks cute and tastes delicious.

This is very good.  I used FF/SF pudding, skim milk, and fat free cool whip. I frosted a two layer cake with it which didn't work too well because the icing doesn't harden but it would be great on a sheet cake.  It also was very yummy on its own:)

I used this recipe for a cookies and cream cake.  I used plain cool whip, and french vanilla pudding, then folded crushed cookies into the frosting.  I put this onto a devil's food cake, made from a mix.  It is very simple and tastes great!  Next time, I'm going to try chocolate flavored cool whip and chocolate pudding.  I'm sure it will be amazing as well!

YEA!  FINALLY!  I will never buy a store-bought cake again due to their whipped frosting.  This is it!  It was perfect on my son's birthday cake, and I'm mixing up another batch for cake tonight.  I'm using chocolate pudding and chocolate whipped cream.  I'll let you know, but I'm POSITIVE it will be fantastic based on past experiences.

This was the traditional topping for Jello poke cakes at our house.  Its terrific on all kinds of cakes though.  I like to use cheesecake pudding with French vanilla Cool Whip.

We LOVE this as the topping to all our cakes! I've read some of the reviews where there has been a  problem with the consistency of this, but I have seemed to solve that. I use beaters to stir the pudding mixture and then right when you can tell its starting to thicken I put in the cool whip. The recipe says "gently fold it in" but I use the beaters to whip the cool whip in also. Perfect every time! I get a nice thick whipped topping. I am so happy to have something in the place of too sweet frosting.  THANK YOU!

yummy!  i've been wanting to make this for a while now, and tonight, I finally decided to do it.  I am a die-hard homemade whipped cream woman, no cool whip for me, so I used heavy cream, 1/2 cup sugar, and about a tablespoon or 2 of dry milk powder to keep it from getting runny (that is the worst!) for mine.  I whipped the cream first, then made the pudding mix, I used french vanilla, and only 3/4 cup of whole (hey, i'm already using heavy cream, why not go all the way?!) milk so it would be thicker.  I chilled the pudding for five minutes, then added to the whipped cream.  I am eating it as I type, and man is it good!  
I love the cakes Wal-Mart has, only for their whipped cream frosting-ha ha!  No more Wal-Mart for me!  Seriously, this is GOOD!  
For those of you looking for a "traditional" frosting, this may not be the right one for you, this is a very light, creamy frosting.  Think Cool Whip-as the name implies.  Wonderful, wonderful recipe!!!!

This is the easiest to make, yummiest frosting recipe I have ever come across.  I made it to top a birthday cake and everyone just RAVED and gobbled it all up.  Will definitely use again (and again and again...) Thanks Shirley!!!  **UPDATE**  I used this to frost the "Strawberry Cake II" from this site (the BEST strawberry cake EVER!) substituting chocolate pudding for the vanilla for a work potluck...my co-workers couldn't get enough of cake or frosting and are still following me around and asking when I can bring in more...this frosting is just fantastic - fool-proof, versatile, not overly-sweet and positively yummy.  You MUST try it!!!

I have mixed feelings about this. First off, it's not a frosting AT ALL. Positives: the taste is definitely better than canned frosting, it's not too sweet, and the recipe is versatile. I think it would work fine for cupcakes and sheet cakes, but for layer cakes...I don't think so. While I was frosting them, my layers kept sliding. Then, when I served the cake, everyone's layers slid apart as soon as the forks hit the cake. I will try to work with the recipe, and add only half the liquid next time.  UPDATE: I made this again for Easter using only 3/4 cup of milk, and it worked MUCH better.

This is a good recipe.  I vary the recipe with different flavors of pudding.  Chocolate is great.  Been using this recipe for 5 years now, and am currently using it on homemade ice cream cakes...yummy!

This is the same recipe I have been using for years! It is always a hit with my family and friends. Guess my frosting secret is not so much a secret anymore! I have tried many different combinations, but my favorite is mixing the whipped cream with a package of vanilla pudding and a can of crushed pineapples. I got it from a magazine and it is de-lish! :)

I am a food snob & everyone I know knows that about me but even I know that if you're making a recipe that includes cool whip, it's going to taste like cool whip! It's entirely unfair to rate these types of recipes as if you expected something gourmet. This is a great, easy thing to whip up that you can top cupcakes with or use as a quick mousse. I'm not a fan of cool whip at all & rarely use it but my daughter likes to bake & she loves mousse so we've done this one several times & it's always a hit & so versatile too. We used it to top the Simple White Cake from this sight that we made into cupcakes & we have also subbed the milk for dark chocolate almond milk & it's great!

I hate making frosting, I don't like separating eggs or cooking it and waiting for it to cool, so I love how easy this recipe is. 
It is very fluffy and creamy and delicious!
I make it all the time using different pudding flavors or extracts depending on what I need it for.
I start out with 1/2 cup milk and then increase it if needed to prevent runny frosting. 
The recipe works best when using brand name Cool Whip and Jell-O Pudding. I've used off brands a couple times and it comes out runny and grainy.

Not sure what I was thinking to believe these ingredients would make a frosting I would feel comfortable giving to friends.  I had to make a different recipe.  Nothing like Bavarian Cream.  What a shame to waste money I can't spare and food.

OMG!!! was the first thing out of my mouth after my first bite. Soooooo good!!!. I followed directions exactly only to discover in the end that I had bought sugar free/fat free pudding, You would never know, this was so lite and good,  I will be using this recipe  often. I used it this time on a sheet cake. 10 plus stars!!!!. Update I can't tell you the amount of times I have made this, truly addictive, I change the pudding mix from time to time, choc is the bomb!!!.

This is a very versatile recipe. I use many different flavors (whatever is available in instant puddings) butterscotch, and toasted coconut have been well received. I have added toasted coconut to it for variety. Also it is not too sweet as some frosting tend to be. You couldn't ask for anything simpler.

I made my own whipped cream instead of the tubbed kind (too many additives).  Easy, versatile, and not too sweet!  This is my frosting of choice.

This is such a terrific frosting.  It's creamy and smooth and not too sweet.  It's easy to spread too.  Another great thing is that you can make it any flavour you want.  I used lemon pudding mix on my little girl's butterfly b-day cake... yum yum.

This is delicious!!  I made chocolate-mocha frosting by using chocolate pudding mix and ading a touch of coffee extract.  It was absolutely delicious!  I frosted a 2 layer 9" chocolate cake with it and there was enough to frost and fill the entire cake.  I highly recommend this!

I altered this recipe just a litte by using chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.  This was a big hit with vanilla cake.  It is cool and refreshing on a hot summers day.  This one's a keeper for me!!

I made this topping for a 4th of July cake.  I thought the recipe couldn't  have been written properly cause mine turned out with the consistency of soup. When I added blueberries to the top they immediately sunk into the "frosting" and disappeared! I questioned if I should have blended (with a mixer) the pudding mix and let it chill/thicken before adding it to the cool whip. I had followed the recipe which only stated to "mix" the ingredients and stir gently. I went back and read others "least positive" comments and realized this had happened to many others. I put it in the fridge hoping for a miraculous recovery and I got it! The soupy mess, although light became fluffy enough to hold my berries. The taste was absolutely delicious. Everyone came back for seconds. Don't let first appearances fool you! I'm so glad I didn't overreact and throw it out.

Awesome recipe.  You can change it up so many different ways.  I usedseveral kind of pudding. The cream cheese pudding ended up being our family favorite.  This frosting is very light and whippy.  I did use slightly less milk so that it was a little thicker. Even with doing this it is not a dense heavy frosting. Also added 1tsp vanilla to bring out flavor a little more.  Piped different variations of this frosting on different kinds of cupcakes for my daughter's birthday.  Everyone loved it.

Quite light and fluffy. After a couple days it seems to yellow and get a sticky finish. 2nd time I made it:  I used coconut extract instead of vanilla for frosting the Coconut Cream Cake 1 from this site. Very yummy.

An excellent alternative to sickening sweet frosting!
This was just perfect!
I used on a 2-layer cake and it held up nicely. Followed the recipe exactly and still had some left over.
Thanks.

Awesome and easy. I used 3/4 cup milk and it was a perfect consistency for piping on cupcakes. Used name brand cool whip and jello because some people had problems with the consistency and I know their is a difference with the store brand jello and cool whip. I like to use a large swirl of frosting on cupcakes but nobody needs that much buttercream (especially hyper little kids). I hoped this recipe would be perfect and it was. It's light and not too sweet but still looks impressive.  Also, I mixed everything with the mixer instead of hand folding the cool whip. It took 2 minutes to make, no lie.

I never rate recipes but just had to rate this one!  This is the best frosting I have ever made or eaten!  My daughter, who hates traditional frostings because they are too sweet, loved this one too!  I used cheesecake flavored pudding and used it on chocolate cupcakes.  I was a little skeptical because some reviewers complained it was too runny...if your final product is too runny, you did something wrong! I piped this onto cupcakes and it held perfectly!!  I will be using this recipe from now on!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Super frosting...light and not too sweet.  Great way to shake things up and get away from those butter cream frostings (which to me are overwhelming).  I used this with "Barb's Chocolate Cake" for a birthday party and was pleased...lots of compliments and people eating seconds (people who asked for a `small piece' originally : )!   I refrigerated the cake and frosting before serving, as I didn't want it to get runny...the consistency was not as firm as a traditional frosting, but stayed put and was easy to spread.

This was extremely easy to make and tasted okay if you have some extra cool whip to get rid of.  It tasted like fake frosting.  My toddlers liked it, but I will stick with more traditional frosting next time.  You could really taste the vanilla pudding mix... a little too much.

This is sich a quick and easy recipie, I just love it! Frostings that are made from scratch are often too stiff, not to mention, practically all butter, I hate canned frostings because they tast so artifical. This is awesome every time. Super light, tasty and much better for you! A wonderful alternative for those who dont have a standing mixer to make butter creams, and awesome for the heath conscious too. Plus, there always enough for filling and coverage for a whole cake. Fast and easy too! Youll absolutly love it!

Very disappointed after all the reviews. Have to agree with those that said it is not frosting...it's not. A topping, filling, maybe, but not frosting. It does taste good, but not sure what I would use it for. Would be very nervous to put it on a cake that had to sit out at all.

Not really one for whipped topping on cakes, but this one is ok.  It was incredibly easy to make and my family thought that it was good.  I guess I am too picky, though.  I still prefer buttercream on my cakes, but if you are looking for smooth, creamy, light and cool, then this would be great.  (If you are looking to fill and frost a cake, I would recommend doubling the recipe as this did not make as much as I thought it would.)

I love this!  Made it 3 times now.  I used 8 oz Lite Cool whip, small box chocolate pudding mix, 3/4 cup skim milk, & 1 tsp vanilla, used on my usual rich chocolate sheet cake.  Family loved the frosting, couldn't tell what it was made of, only that it was light tasting and good.  Way better than canned frosting, which is too sweet (that's saying a lot as I have a sweet tooth!).  I can't taste Cool Whip in it, but I do like Cool Whip to begin with.  (Oh, I made this once using sugar free chocolate pudding mix, didn't care for that one as much myself, but Hubby loved it)  Those of you who want natural ingredients and don't like Cool Whip, well, you probably shouldn't be trying this recipe.

This is the only frosting recipe I use now, and everyone always raves on how good it is!  It's light but doesn't have the over-powering cool whip taste, I think the pudding mix adds extra flavor.  I also found that after you frost the cake, if you refrigerate it for an hour or so, it helps the frosting set up a little thicker.  You can also add food coloring if you want to make it a color other than white- I once used lemon pudding mix and added a few drops of yellow food coloring and frosted a lemon cake.  It was delicious and the light yellow frosting was very pretty!

I love this whipped cream frosting. It's the beat one I  have ever made. For a long time I was looking for the perfect whipped topping for my bizcocho de tres leche (three milk cake) and I finally found it. This was perfect. I used half the milk because I wanted it to stick to the sides of the cake. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

I got this recipe from a friend and usually make it with white chocolate pudding and no vanilla (she didn't give me that option), I ALWAYS get rave reviews (I always get asked what kind of frosting I used because it tastes so light and fluffy)- it does set up very well and decorates beautifully. I usually blend the milk with the Cool Whip in a mixer first, then sprinkle the pudding in little by little which helps result in a smoother frosting. I have also used chocolate flavored pudding, cheesecake flavored pudding, lemon, the possibilities are endless. Such a malleable recipe!

I use this on the Coconut Cream I cake from allrecipes and it is so good. Instead of vanilla pudding mix I use cheesecake flavored pudding. The vanilla pudding is sort of yellowish and the other is whiter in color, making for a prettier cake. I just add 1/4 teaspoon coconut extract. I have used this many times and it's so quick and easy. I let the pudding and milk thicken up a bit before gently folding in the cool whip. It holds up well and it's even great with fat-free, sugar-free, pudding and cool-whip. Thank you!

4 stars for the recipes AS IS. I think it could be a 5 star recipe if you use these modifications.
1. Like other people said, use whipping cream and whip your own...makes a difference.
2. I used white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla...deliciously rich tasting but also light feeling...good.
3. chill it after you ice whatever your icing, and it will be BEAUTIFUll.

This is very good and very light. I could eat it plain or surely as a fruit dip! Next time I will leave out the vanilla extract as I feel the vanilla pudding is enough. This would be great leaving the milk out and substituting in a can (with juices) of crushed pineapple. I used this to frost "Whipped Cream Cake II" from this site. FYI: It is not as thick as a regular frosting!!

Really good when you want something other than sickening sweet canned frosting.  Lot's of different flavor combinations possible.  I used this on a Coconut Cream Cake and used white chocolate pudding with a squirt more of the coconut cream instead of the vanilla extract.  The pudding takes away the Cool-Whip flavor very nicely.

i loved this frosting! i made it recently for my boyfriend's birthday. he and i do not like overly sweet frostings, so i hoped this would be perfect. and it was! it does help to let it refrigerate for a while. while my cake baked (i used a cookies and cream cake mix cake from the duncan hines website. also excellent!), i prepared the frosting. i let that get icy cold in the fridge (about an hour) and took out about a cup to color with food coloring to use for piping "happy birthay" on the cake. i put that in a seperate storage container and colored it with coloring. i than let that set up in the fridge for about 30 mins. after the cake was cooled, i frosted the cake and than i let that frosting set up for about 20 mins. and than piped the wording onto the cake. it is time consuming, but it's so worth it. the frosting complimented the cake well, without being too sweet. it's also light and fluffy, and not heavy at all. this will for sure be my go-to frosting from now on. what i also loved is that the ingredients are easy to find, and you don't have to have any special ingredients from cake shops or specialty food stores! no more canned frosting for me!

So easy to make, yet so very delicious! I love how it's not too sugary sweet... this recipe actually allows you to enjoy the taste of the cake, too. Four of those who tried my cake said they aren't cake people, but they loved mine! They kept pointing out how light the frosting was. Those compliments made my day.

I didn't care for this as much as I'd hoped. We ate it, but I didn't think it had authentic flavor. I think the whipped topping made it taste a bit artificial. It was really fluffy though. Next time, I'm going to try it with fresh whipped cream, and I think it will be delicious.

Absolutely loved this frosting! I used it on a double chocolate layer cake and it filled and frosted the cake nicely with even some frosting left over! One suggestion to those users who would like a chocolate twist: add a little Hersheys chocolate syrup to the chocolate version of this...fantastic! Will definitely use this frosting over and over and over! I also might add that if once you make this if you'd like to store it before you frost your cake, the frosting fits perfectly back into the Cool Whip container!

This definitely has limited usefulness as a frosting. As other reviewers have said, you can definitely taste the Cool Whip-like taste even after the pudding and milk have been fully incorporated. Also, it doesn't hold it's shape well enough to use as anything other than a simple topping - you won't be using it through a pastry bag or making designs with it, probably. That being said, it's very fast and easy to make, and if you wanted a simple and sweet tasting dessert topping this would probably work well for you. I probably won't set out to make this again, but if I'm ever in a pinch I might make it.

It is really a misnomer to call this "frosting" since it does not conform to anything you would normally have in a frosting recipe.  Better to call it a "topping" because that is what it really is.  

That said - I've been making this for years - always with good results.  I use it to top a lemon cake that has been poked with holes and then had lime jello poured over it.  Mix the cool whip with instant lemon pudding in this case.  It is very refreshing on a hot summer day.

I'm with a few others on "I don't get the buzz on this frosting."  I made the chocolate version, with chocolate whipped cream and chocolate instant pudding and milk.  It was just "ok" - it tasted greasy and the consistency was very runny after  20 minutes or so.  My intention was to use it as filling for a chocolate/strawberry layer cake, and then frost the outside with regular chocolate butter-cream frosting. I did just that - but when I set the cake down after frosting the outside, the top layer completely slid off because the filling was so slippery from the pudding being in the mix.  

I'm a baker, I bake all the time and I've made dozens of cakes and dozens of different kinds of frostings.  I will try the vanilla recipe, simply because it's the original recipe and the one everyone raves about - but I just don't see it as replacing any type of traditional frosting, especially for cupcakes????  Why would you want something that is semi-runny, pudding-like on your cupcakes?  I certainly would not frost an entire chocolate layer cake with this recipe.  Maybe a sheet cake, that is still left in the pan, but not something that needs to last for any length of time. 

My slices of cake that I save in the refrigerator are now more like "pudding cake" than frosted cake.

My family wants to celebrate everything with a cake just so they can eat this frosting!!  It's fun to experiment with different flavors of instant pudding.  Our favorite is cheesecake.  I'll add food coloring to little bowls of it and let the kids decorate.  The result can get a little sloppy, since this is so fluffy and creamy, but it tastes SO good nobody cares.

This was just OK.  It tasted decent, but was nothing to write home about though.  The 3 stars I am giving it are for being quick and easy.  If you are low on time, this is a good way to go.  If you have more time however,I would explore other options.

In order to have it stiff enough to pipe, I reduced the milk to 3/4 cup.  After folding in the cool whip I refrigerated the frosting for about twenty minutes--after that amount of time the consistency was perfect.  This tasted great and is a lot lighter in calories and fat than if you used real whipped cream.  If you don't like the taste of cool whip, then you'll want to use real whipped cream in its place.

Nice light frosting.....I use a little less milk, and have no problem frosting a layer cake this way. My family really appreciates the lightness this frosting adds to a dessert. Not to mention that it is far less sweet than most icings. I sometimes use a chocolate pudding mix in this on a rich chocolate cake to cut the heaviness. Using a lemon pudding mix is also really good on a white or lemon cake.

I read the advice on several of the reviewers notes and decided to try another flavor.  I used Coconut Cream instant pudding and Coconut Milk (half the milk for thickness) and omitted the vanilla because the flavor was already there.  It came out a good consistency and combined nicely with the red velvet cupcake.  I will try other flavors and definitely use this easy recipe again.  It does hold up in the fridge and tastes yummy!

the idea of this recipe is good, but i didn't want the store-bought cool whip taste so i improvised.  i followed the directions but replaced the cool whip with  homemade whipped cream, which i made by whisking 1 cup of heavy whipping cream with 1 tablespoon of sugar.  then i used coconut pudding in place of the vanilla since i was frosting a coconut cake.  it was perfect!  not too sweet and the perfect consistency!  i kept the frosted cake refrigerated until serving.

This is not a favorite. It's easy to make and tastes ok. It's just too plain jane for me. You can automatically taste the Cool Whip. Tastes fine on its own though. Also, you might want to lessen some of the ingredients since mines came out like water even though I followed the ingredients and instructions step by step. Less milk would probably help. Sorry but only 2 stars for me.

So good but I modified it. I used 1 1/2  container frozen whipped topping (12 oz total) --- 2 (3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix --- 2 cup milk  --- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract --- 1/2 can (6 oz total) Betty Crocker Whipped Vanilla Frosting.

SO yummy! VERY tastey, not very rich (I am not fond of rich, heavy frosting) and light in taste. Perfect on gelatin cake! However, it was not stiff like some reviewers said. It turned out rather sloppy. This recipe would be five star HANDS DOWN... IF it was lighter and fluffier. I think it was partially because I used generic whipped topping... Use the real deal!

I thought this tasted very good. Not exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a replacement for the whipped type frosting that the deli makes. After reading a review that stated it was like Walmarts I thought I had found it. But alas I'll keep looking. This would be a great topping for angelfood cake. I used it on my sons birthday cake. The frosting held up well, but the icing writing I used spread out into huge blobs in the frosting. I'll use it again, just not on birthday cake that requires decoration.

Nice, light flavor.  Mine was a little runny and didn't work real well for a layer cake.  It would've been fine for a sheet cake, though.

Wonderfully light and oh so delicious! BUT, if you like coconut you must try coconut pudding instead of vanilla and use coconut extract instead of vanilla extract. Try it on a white cake and you get a delicate, fluffy, coconut dream!

Found this recipe in time for Easter. I made vanilla filling for a chocolate cake and it was so delicious.  A few days later I dedided to test the chocolate pudding version and it was great, too.  Can't wait to test with other flavors.  I did let the pudding set up before folding in the Cool Whip as another reader suggested.

Good recipe!  I made this one twice, once with French vanilla pudding and once with chocolate.  It was so simple and yet tasted so good!  I doubled the recipe the second time because my husband and son loved it by itself!  As a side note- I used one box of sugar-free chocolate pudding and one box of regular, and it still tasted great.  Thanks for a nice alternative to the usual frosting!

I didn't know this was an icing as we don/t eat cake often-Use French Vanilla Pudding-wait until the pudding is set before folding in the cool whip and it has a wonderful custard texture add cookies and sliced banana for a great homemade (you can't tell the difference)Banana Pudding

I used this as a filling for the whitetexassheetcake and the texassheetcake V. I put the chocolate cake as the bottom layer and the white texas as the top layer of cake. This recipe in the middle, and the chocolate icing from txshtck v everywhere else. Then I chopped up all the chocolate bars from my daughters trick-or-treat stash and pushed it around the edges...mmmmmmmm good.

I made this today with store brand cool whip and instant pudding.  I mix the pudding mix with 1/2 and 1/2 -( 3/4 cup) then folded in the cool whip.  Perfectly fluffy and tastes great.

Well, I think this was exactly the icing I have been longing for when  I go to the nearby bakery.  I, however, messed up a bit.  Instead of using the recommended 3.5 ounces of pudding, I used 1.34 ounces (leave it to me to miss something so obvious)!  I still used 1 cup of milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Being the first time I have ever folded whipped cream into anything, I was somewhat hesitant, even though there was really no need to be.  I was able to mix all the ingredients to perfection.  I decided to use a sugar-free pudding, because when I got home that was apparently what I absentmindedly picked up (another thing overlooked by yours truly).  Like I stated before it turned out awesome! I  could not be happier with it and it is now my go to recipe for icing. No more store bought stuff for this gal.  Thank you so much shirleyo.  I am indebted to you, eternally. :)

I was looking for a whipped cream frosting that was lighter than traditional buttercream...but I should have substituted the vanilla pudding with white chocolate, because I wanted a pure white frosting, and this, while yummy, is a butter yellow due to the vanilla pudding dye.  

However, I found the taste to be certainly much better than one previous reviewer noted, and I didn't think it tasted artificial...it's a frosting!  I could also see this being a great cream puff filling.

I made this to frost an angel food cake and it was just what I needed! Something cool, light, fluffy, and pretty tasty! I used french vanilla pudding mix instead of plain vanilla and it turned out good. The color tint turns out a little more yellowish than plain vanilla, just a heads up, but my family didn't mind. Very nice recipe but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like cool whip.

Super easy and delicious too.  My family doesn't like traditional frosting.  This is the perfect recipe for us.  I used this for a double layer cake.  Holds up well to decorating.  Also works well with the natural food coloring that I used.  Will use this recipe again and again.

Love this so much! I can't stand traditional frosting (too sweet for me), so this was perfect! Also like how versatile it can be.... you can make a ton of different flavors with it, or easily make it sugar-free! This first time I made it I put it on pumpkin cheesecake bars and it was perfect for them!

I notice that at least one person kind of shunned making icing out of a cool whip base. But I have to say, if it tastes good, then what difference does it make? I made this to frost my boyfriend's birthday cake (the cake was chocolate), as he hates the store-bought icing. We both thought it was quite tasty, and it wasn't so heavy like the pre-made icing. So I say, if you're short on time (or if you don't have a hand mixer to whip your own cream at the moment), there's no shame in taking a short cut, especially one that has good-tasting results. This recipe also inspired me to try out other flavors of icing in the future by using a different flavor of pudding, like pistachio. Yum!

This was delicious! I love it! And I'm not an icing person. Regular ones are too sweet. Yours was a bit too watery so I changed it a bit. Here's the ricipe I used:  1 container cool whip, thawed. 1 Package instant white chocolate pudding mix. 1/2 cup milk

After reading reviews I was kinda hesitant to use this recipe. I made said frosting as directed and after tasting it, realized what previous reviewers were referring to as "artificial" taste :P -- It was not a pleasing flavor. BUT!  I added the entire 16 oz. tub of cool whip....VOILA! Perfect frosting for a poke cake! :)

I topped a cake with this for July 4th.  I have a chronicly overweight extended family and decided to try this as a healthy option for them.  I chose to use cheesecake pudding mix for variety and fat free cool whip.  I am not a fan of fat free concoctions, but this was very very good!  They thought so too!  I was the most popular of the 3 cakes we had.  I will definitely keep this recipe as a healthier alternative!! It may not be buttercream frosting, but it sure as heck doesn't have tons of shortening in it!!    I read other reviews about it being watery??  It is soft... maybe not a good idea for layered cakes.  I had my cake sitting at room temp (around 72degreesF) throughout an entire day and the frosting held up just fine.

I would give 4.5 if I could... very yummy... and VERY easy!!   I tried to make it taste a little more "fresh" by adding about 4 ounces of cream cheese (melted and mixed with a little bit of milk) to the mix. It worked great! It made it a bit thicker, but didn't taste like cream cheese at all (I used french vanilla pudding mix instead of regular vanilla, which helped)...   The only drawback is, if you like it pretty sugary, it did counter the sweetness a little bit, although I suppose you could add a bit of powdered sugar if you need it a little sweeter...  Also made a great fruit dip with the cream cheese added! :)

wonderful light frosting. I used 7/8 cup of milk, made my own whipped topping and it turned out great. Easy to spread and decorate. If not eaten immediately need to store in fridge. I also made sure I had chilled my bowls before making my own whipped topping. I will use this again, great alternative to the heavy sweet frosting that is used most often.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!  This is exactly what I was looking for to top an orange cake I made recently!  I am going to experiment with different extracts (orange, almond, etc).  Very light texture and truly delish :)

This was allright. I like it, but don't see the point in making a recipe of it (it's just too basic IMHO). This didn't mimic "bavarian cream" at all (trust me, I've had the REAL stuff in both Germany / Austria). This is what it is - Cool-whip and pudding mixed together, nothing else. I would rather save the $'s spent on pudding mix and milk and just use whipped topping instead. I must admit though, this did pair nicely with the Jell-O poke cake recipe on this site (which is what I used it for). Oh, and  if you DO decide to give this a try (and are watching your waistline also... lol), using fat-free, sugar free pudding / Cool-whip and fat-free milk makes no difference at all. Since I was cooking for a diabetic friend, I did, and no one (including him) could tell they were eating lighter :) Thanks for sharing your recipe, shirleyo!

Fantastic recipe. A light but creamy and tasty frosting. I followed the directions and ingredients as listed and it can frost 2 small cakes, or 1 bigger, double layer cake. I used the original cool whipped (not the low fat one) which I think may be what is changing the consistency of some of the other reviewers frosting.

I didn't have time to run to the store to purchase a can of frosting, but had all the ingredients for this recipe.  It was awesome!  My 8 year old LOVED her birthday cake!  I added red food coloring and mixed in sprinkles to add to the sweetness for the birthday girl!  Good tip - refrigerator before spreading.

I thought it was wonderfully different from the regular sugar icing and frostings. I don't like things that are too sweet so i just fell in love with this frosting. Deliciously light and wonderful.

I used this frosting on a cake I made for my God son's brithday yesterday and it looked wonderful. It held together quite lovely.

I made a strawberry shortcake using this recipe as the whipped cream layer and brought it into work.  My co-workers absolutely loved it.  I can see this recipe as having a lot of uses (a topping for cakes, cupcakes, a topping for a nice fruit salad, etc..)  It is very, very yummy.

This was great as chocolate icing too!  Just change the pudding mix and use almond extract instead of vanilla.  I used it on my 3 year old son's strawberry birthday cake.  It truly added to the flavor instead of overpowering it like most icings tend to do.

This is a good recipe as written.  My favorite is using chocolate or lemon pudding.  I also use a variation of this recipe with Dream Whip, sub in 1 pkg of dream whip for the Cool Whip, and use 1 1/4 cup cold milk (everything else the same).  Good if you don't happen to have Cool Whip on hand.  You do have to beat this version longer and let sit for a bit before spreading.

I fixed cupcakes made from a mix & used this frosting.  I served them for a family birthday party.  The frosting received rave reviews!  It is so easy (which I love) and tasty.  I used chocolate pudding, and it was WONDERFUL!  I will definitely make this again.  :)

This is AWESOME!!!  There are so many variations that you can do with all the different cakes and pudding flavors.  The first time I made it I used a Devils Food chocolate cake and used vanilla pudding in the frosting.  It was fabulous.  This time I used a white cake and cheesecake pudding.  It's really good!  I will NEVER buy another can of frosting again.

I used this for a strawberry layer cake.  It got rave reviews.  My only criticism is that I found it somewhat difficult to get onto the cake.  It's SO light that it doesn't seem to want to stay where it's put and cover the cake.  Just takes a little extra effort though.  Overall, very good.

This frosting is perfect with the Black Magic Cake. It's simple to make and has a wonderful flavor without being too sweet. Double the recipe to frost a 2 layer cake. I added a little Almond extract to the vanilla. Everyone loved it!

AWESOME frosting.  I can't stand heavy buttercreams so this is a perfect choice.  So versatile!  I made it for my boyfriend's devil's food birthday cake and he couldn't stop eating it.

Resembles Bavarian Cream is a good discription of this frosting. It was easy to make and very good. I was surprised that it held up so well on a two layer cake.

I made this frosting on a box cake  2 weekends in a row and didn't do any alterations. The taste is so heavenly, they cannot believe I made it. Last night I brought my heavenly cake to my in-laws and they asked me "What's the occassion?". Again, the response was "This is sooo good , where did you buy this? Everybody went on seconds and even  my husband's niece and nephew (both were picky eaters)agreed that "This is the best Vanilla Cake they ever had!". Shirley, thanks for making me a STAR!!!!

This is a delicious, light frosting that isn't overly sweet and can be adapted to a variety of tastes by changing the flavor of pudding mix. This is enough to frost and fill a two-layer cake. You won't be able to pipe with this frosting (I found that it's just not stiff enough) but for standard frosting it's fantastic.

This is a very easy and tasty frosting.  It goes awesome with orange cake.  I used vanilla pudding and added just a small splash of orange juice.  This recipe is a keeper and I will be sure to make it again and again.  Thank you!

Oh and it came out looking yellow... not sure what happened there .... but next time I make this I will definitely go out and get me some whole milk

This recipe was a total fail for me.  I followed the instructions exactly, but it was a runny mess.  I started adding powdered sugar to try and stiffen it up, but it was beyond saving.  After 4 cups of powdered sugar, and it was still runny, I gave up.  I used regular Cool Whip, Jello brand pudding and 2% milk.......I gently folded the cool whip in after mixing the other ingredients.  It tasted yummy but was useless.  I was very disappointed.  I put it in the refrigerator to see if that would help but it stayed runny.  This photo is of it AFTER I added all that powdered sugar and tried to put it on a cake. I threw the strawberries on top of it, trying to do anything to salvage my pitiful cake with no luck. :(

I Made strawberry chocolate chip cupcakes for a work party.  I used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla pudding.  I added about 1/2 teaspoon cocoa. Let that sit for a min and then folded in the cool whip.  Tasted great with the fresh strawberry chocolate chip cupcakes.  Will be making this again.

I was a little hesitent to make this, but I was looking for something a little less fattning.  It turned out great.  Everyone loved it, even the kids.  I iced chocolate cupcakes with it.  It was a little runny so I put it in the fridge for a while.  One batch was way too much for my 24 cupcakes.  Might have to make more cupcakes today:)

This is a very good, quick frosting.  However, I like it even better with homemade whipped heavy cream.  You can do so much as far as flavoring.  It's great to use flavored coffee creamer in place of the milk and/or any kind of pudding you want.  Endless possibilities.  I agree with the review that said if you don't like Cool Whip and pudding for your frosting, there are many others to choose from without those ingredients.  Enjoy :)

My husband and son love this icing.  It's not as sweet as store-bought.  I omitted the vanilla since I used vanilla pudding and wanted the icing to taste like cool whip- not like vanilla.  Fantastic!

I used this recipe to make icing for a lemon cake for my daughter's birthday and everybody loved it.  I used lemon pudding mix and lemon extract instead of the vanilla and I used real whip cream instead of cool whip.  This is so easy and you can change the flavour just by changing the pudding mix.  By using real whip cream you have more control over the sweetness as you can add as much sugar as you want.

This is a great frosting.  I used cheesecake pudding mix and it almost had a cream cheese frosting taste, but without the heaviness.  Everyone agreed it's much better than traditional frosting.  This will be my go to now!

my family loved this i thought it was pretty good 5 stars because its really easy and really light. i don't care for frosting that's heavy and too sweet this one is perfectly a moderate amount of sweet i use it for white almond wedding cake on this site which is a dense cake so it pairs well. yes, it does taste like cool whip but thats basically what it is. im sure it would be betetr with fresh whipped cream but i dont have a hand mixer so i had to do withh coolwhip but it turned out great bc everyone loved it.

Nothing special, but it did the trick.  I used less milk and it was good that I did, still a bit runny.  But a piped buttercream around the edges to hold it in before filling and stacking my cakes.  It was light, which is what I wanted to break up the richness of my cake.

This is wonderful on top of jello poke cakes!  Great summer frosting for sure.  I also make this for my icecream cakes.

I was pleasantly surprised by this simple recipe. My husband loves whipped frosting and I searched high and low for a good recipe, and I found it! I personally leave out the vanilla extract and think it's phenomenal!

I used this frosting on my coconut creme cake. It came across as slightly cheesy, which I didn't really understand why. Once I sprinkled toasted coconut on the frosting it wasn't too bad. After allowing the frosting to sit for a couple days in the fridge (it was on the cake), the frosting not only tasted cheesy, it also became somewhat salty. Thus, I am assuming this frosting is not meant to sit for long but is meant to be eaten quickly.

Great frosting, so easy.  We had the cake in the fridge for days, and the frosting held up really well.  Much better than just using cool whip on its own and tastes better too.

Tastes great. I used Jello brand sugar free vanilla flavored pudding mix -- it yielded a light yellow color. Just an FYI. I have no idea how that color compares to the regular sugar version. Thanks for the recipe :=)

Another great frosting recipe that I have found on this site.  I used to buy canned frosting, but never have to anymore since discovering these recipes.  I used this to frost a strawberry cake, and it worked just perfectly.  I did as previous reviewers did and only used 3/4 cup milk.

Perhaps it was my ingrediants, but this did not hold up well.  I beat the pudding, milk and vanilla until thickened, and then folded in the cool whip.  The cool whip loosened up the mixture and thus it was difficult to frost a layer cake.  I ended up letting my 5yr old frost his cupcakes with it instead.  After letting them refidgerate overnight, I thought they would've hardened up or set a bit, but the frosting was still soft.  Overall the taste was okay, but I would not use it for cake.

This is excellent served as a dip for fresh fruit (I also found this recipe originally as an icing for a "Very Berry Cake' on the side of a strawberry cake mix).  I've used this type of icing recipe for years.  Everone I've made it for, loved it and wanted the recipe.  A quick hint for the one that said it tasted artificial, if you use a good vanilla, that usually takes the store bought artificial flavor out of the whipped topping.  If you use a cheap artificial vanilla, thats what you get for flavor.  Just something to think about.  Love the easy variations you can make with this recipe, a very good recipe base to use to expand your imagination with.  Thanks for sharing.

I've tried both cheesecake & chocolate pudding (both sugar-free, fat-free) and I used sugar-free cool whip.  Both were good but we preferred the cheesecake.  I followed dkritinar's tips on mixing the cool whip & milk first, then adding the pudding a little at a time.  I prefer to use 1/2 c of milk to make it a little more firm.  It is wonderfully light, fluffy, cool, fresh and not too sweet but if you're looking for something close to the typical buttercream frosting then this is NOT it.  We love it on summertime cakes!  I can't wait to try it on ice cream cake!

I used this on an angel food cake.but used 2tsp strawberry extract & red food dye to make it pink. It was light cool & delicious. However, as soon as you taste it- you know its cool whip. I think I will use this recipe again BUT I will make the whip cream myself. This is so versatile I would love to try this with chocolate & other flavors!!

I chose this as a less-sugary option for my one year-old's birthday cake, but it was a huge hit with the adults too!  Two of us were caught eating the frosting with a spoon out of the bowl!!  I used vanilla flavored cool whip (generic probably), vanilla pudding mix and vanilla extract - and it wasn't overly vanilla.  So yummy.  I am doing this frosting again for my son's second birthday.  Easy enough for a non-baker!

If you are not a fan of the thick, super sweet frosting, this is the perfect recipe for you.  I love cool whip and this frosting tasted much lighter.  I used jello cookies n/ cream instant pudding (the 4.5 oz), a little more low fat cool whip than the recipe called for, 1/2 the skim milk, and the vanilla.  It tasted very good.  However, I will say it doesn't stick to cake/cupcakes like a normal store bought frosting, but it still stays on pretty well and tastes fantastic.  For how simple this recipe was, I would highly recommend it.

Love, love, LOVE this frosting.  I used it on a coconut cake and everyone asked me what the frosting was.  It literally made the cake!  *I actually forgot to add the milk, which is why I didn't get the runny mess.  Just use the pudding mix and cool whip and it'll be good.

I reduced the amount of cool whip, and piped it into the center of cupcakes for a fun little surprise (with a little more of a pudding consistency).  Then, I made it according to the recipe to frost the tops of the cupcakes.  Frosting is going to be soft (no surprise) but it piped well and tasted great!  I also used chocolate pudding for half of my cupcakes.

My cousin gave me this recipe last year.  Since then that's all I've been using on my cakes.  If you don't like that sickening sweet icing, this is the recipe to use. It's light and tasty.  Tonight I used chocolate pudding.

This was YUMMY!  I used it to frost Coconut Cream Cake I from this site (instead of the one in the recipe).  I doubled it (because I made the cake in layers and wanted a lot of frosting) and had some left over.  I spread the leftovers between chocolate chip cookies, stuck them in the freezer, and gave them to my kiddos (who don't like coconut) and they were super happy!  This frosting is delish...and versatile!

Simple and quick!!! I substituted chocolate pudding mix and frosted a chocolate cake for my son's birthday.  It was light and delish!  It makes a lot of frosting....enough to fill and coat a 3-layer cake.

What a great, Summer frosting!  Quick to put together and delicious.  I've also made it with lemon extract and it was great.  Edit to review:  I also made this icing using instant chocolate pudding.  It was just as delicious!

The cake I made it for didn't turn out...but everyone still scraped all the frosting off by the next day and raved about it.  I just kept the fact that it was super easy to make to myself and let them think it was from scratch.

I used this frosting on top of a double layered lemon cake. I was looking for an alternitive to the butter cream i usually decorate with. I had thought about subsituting the vanilla pudding for lemon pudding but i wasn't feeling that brave.  I am confident now that lemon would taste wonderful too.  My cake turned out a little sloppy but i'm sure with practice it could be as beautiful as other birthday cakes i've made.  People loved it and the frosting got a wow.. WOW! from my husband.  That's pretty dang good.  Thank you for a great recipe.  I will be using this one again :-)

Yum!  This frosting is fantastic.  It is creamy and light and not too sweet!  I am not a huge fan of buttercream and I enjoy the texture and flavor of this frosting because it is lighter than buttercream.  I would like to try this with chocolate pudding mix as well.

This was soooo good!  I divided it into four bowls and added a different drop of food coloring to each. Then I made the cutest cupcakes ever with it!  BIG HIT!!!!  Not too sweet like buttercream.  I did refrigerate overnight before serving the next day and the icing seem to firm up better!

I loved this frosting.  I don't like frosing that is too sweet so this was perfect for me.  I used it on the coconut cream cake that went with this recipe and instead of the vanilla I used coconut extract.

This is a very good recipe, but I can't really think of any other cake I would use it on, except the coconut cake. It is a perfect compliment to that cake!

I used this to make the icing for my son's train cake!  the icing was so delicious and was less sugary than regular frosting.  The kids loved it :)  I also made some with chocolate flavoring (chocolate pudding and a little nestle syrup) for the darker colored train cars... yum!

Love this!  I have made it several times, experimenting with different pudding flavors on different cakes (e.g., vanilla pudding on an orange cake, chocolate pudding on a cherry cake, lemon pudding on a lemon cake, etc.).  I prefer Dream Whip brand (doesn't have that "Cool Whip" artificial taste so much).  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't usually make recipe reviews but I had to comment about this recipe. This is a wonderful alternative to the usual sugary frostings. I love Bavarian cream and it really does taste similar. I used it on top of an applesauce cake for my son's first birthday. Besides being delicious, it was very easy to clean up because it wasn't greasy. Awesome recipe!

I always frosted my jello poke cakes with just plain cool whip.  When I saw this recipe I thought I would give it a try.  It added a nice flavor to the frosting and it thickened it up a bit.
I took it to a outdoor party and the frosting held up to the heat well. I used the instant cheescake pudding because that was all I had.  I am wondering if anyone has tried to use the chocolate pudding and frosted a chocolate cake with it.

This frosting is good and I didn't have any problems with it getting hard like another reviewer mentioned. I kept the cake in the fridge when not serving, which I think is a no brainer since it IS made of cool whip. I used this frosting on the coconut cream cake just as another reviewer for this frosting did; recommend that cake highly (not the bundt version -- it's further down the page if you search coconut cream cake). This frosting worked very well for that cake. Would also work well on easter cup cakes with coconut on top. I only gave this recipe four starts because while it was super easy to make and tasted pretty good, it didn't totally knock my socks off. I will certainly make this again when I need a light frosting. I passed the recipe along to family members who requested it after trying. So, thanks!

Yum! I had bought not-instant vanilla and ended up using instant white chocolate-it was still yummy.=) I had been following another revier's advice to use this on the coconut cream cake so I also added coconut flakes and left out the vanilla. I only used a total of 3/4 cup of milk and it came out good (not too runny). It just can't be out of the fride long. But thankies for this awesome recipe.

This was pretty good. I could personally do without the vanilla extract. Here's what I did. In a medium bowl I mixed the vanilla pudding mix with 2 cold cups of milk, as the box on it said. I put that in the fridge for a few, the added the extract and then the whipped topping. I made 24 cupcakes and had *plenty* left over. So we took some double stuf oreo cookies and crushed them up in the mix, and we all ate it like a pudding. Yum.

I just used this frosting to frost vanilla cupcakes, and it was a success! It was very light and not overly sweet, and provides a very generous amount per cupcake!  For half of the cupcakes, I put mini chocolate chips in the batter, and swirled some melted chocolate into the frosting.  Very good!

This is my favorite recipe for frosting.  It is much less sweet than the store bought stuff and is so light and fluffy.  My whole family asked me to never buy store bought again the first time I made this.  To change up the flavors and colors, I sometimes substitute other flavors of pudding and it always turns out great!  Thanks for sharing!

i agree, with the other reviewers about it being runny it has a nice light refreshing taste... but its a bit too runny for a frosting maybe it would be better as a filling?

I normally don't like whipped cream frostings because I prefer a denser frosting - but this was perfect! I forgot to add the vanilla - but we didn't miss it. Served on white jello cake, topped with berries. Got rave reviews. Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

Great cake frosting! I dont care for 'too sweet' frostings so this is a wonderful, lighter change. I use different kinds of pudding mix depending on the kind of cake I'm making, and it always turns out great!

My mom and I found this recipe years ago and use it almost anytime we make a cake anymore.  It's easy and so yummy.  It's a great frosting during the summer when you're looking for something light to top off your cake.  Great Recipe!

I make something just like this, but with just a slight difference - I use 2 small boxes of white chocolate low fat pudding mix, stir in 3 cups milk (use skim for a healthier treat)and blend until it thickens, then I add in an 8 oz tub of thawed fat free cool whip. Tastes delicious plain or you can serve with angel food cake or strawberries or both! With this recipe you can't go wrong.

This is so good, easy, and tasty. I made one batch with 1% milk, and fat free sugar free pudding, and fat free cool whip. You could not even tell it was diet. I made the other batch regular. 
I will only use this from now on.

Easiest recipe ever!!!  I used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.  I use to make something similar to this, however I didn't even need a cake!  I'd place the mixture in dessert bowls, added a wafer and called it chocolate mousse.

This is delicious!!! I used the larger sized pudding box and 1 and 1/4 cups of milk and an 8oz tub of the extra creamy cool-whip( this is what i had on hand) and it came out beautiful!  Delicious flavor and texture. I will never use another frosting again- i can't wait to try chocolate and coconut cream.

i don't usually rate things, but this is great.  my friends mother wanted a white cake with lemon filling and coolwhip topping.  i experimented on july 4th party.  it was a big hit. i'm going to put lemon pudding next time to compliment the "lemon filling" and "creamy white layers" on this site. i also made mine the night before and it seemed the frosting softened (not make it soggy, just more moist.) my cake which was great because i overcooked it just a little and before fridge tasted a little tough. everyone loved it and i'm looking forward to making it again. (just have to not eat too much frosting before i get it on the cake. :-)  thanks

Hi! I used this frosting atop the "Pistachio Nut Bundt Cake" recipe listed on this site. I made one modification to this recipe, I used pistachio pudding instead of the vanilla flavor this recipe calls for. This cake turned out to be a tasty birthday surprise for my mom. Turned out great!! Thank you.

What a great way to make a quick light topping! I used vanilla pudding to top pumpkin crunch cake (another quick one!); can't wait to try some other flavors.

I used light Cool Whip, sugar free chocolate pudding, and 3/4 cup unsweetened almond milk.  The flavor and consistency were fantastic but I had little chunks of pudding mix that wouldn't mix in.  Next time I'll add a little Cool Whip when mixing the pudding and milk to make sure it mixes in.  Otherwise, I'll stick to vanilla pudding and add cocoa powder.  YUM!

I make this probably about 75% of the times that I actually make frosting and don't just buy a pre made one from the grocery store. My kids are the ones that I usually make cake and frosting for and they love the store bought ones as much as the ones that I have made. I love Cool Whip and instant pudding so to me this is one of my favorites and if you want a different flavor just add a different flavor of instant pudding mix and you have it in no time. I make butter cream and real whipped cream frosting as well but to me this is just as tasty and very easy and quick.Thank you for posting.

It turned out too liquidy to spread (pour maybe, not spread).  I am currently refrigerating the mixture to see if it thickens.  Maybe I can use is on another cake in the next day or two ... or just eat it ala carte, since it is tasty.

I made this frosting for the Coconut Poke Cake on this site.Instead of vanilla pudding mix I used Cheesescake pudding mix and let me tell you it was so wonderful! I could have ate the entire bowl of it!Next time I will toast some of the coconut. The way this frosting sets up with the pudding mix in it, you could easily pipe it on cupcakes or the cake. Very good stuff!

This is awesome. I've been looking for a nice, light frosting that doesn't taste (and crunch) like pure sugar. This is perfect.

This recipe was sooooo yummy!  I loved it, I frosted cupcakes with it and everyone loved them!!  My ONLY complaint was that it doesn't make that much.  Other than that, I loved it soooo great!

I was able to ice the cake, but the frosting was soft and that made it a bit more challenging. I did not enjoy the flavor, but I did get compliments on it. I will continue to search for a better recipe.

Points for being an easy recipe, but this tasted odd to me.  Be aware that if you substitute evaporated milk for regular milk, as someone suggested, the frosting will have a definitely peach undertone in terms of color.

This was excellent! My husband has to watch his sugar intake so I changed a few things. I went with sugar-free cool whip and sugar-free french vanilla pudding. He wanted a peanut butter frosting so I added about 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the pudding after I mixed it with beaters. I then folded in the cool whip. It tasted so good! I even had a small bowl left after I generously frosted the bundt cake I made. It will be great to enjoy as a rich bowl of pudding, too!!

This is by far my new favorite recipe.  Very simple and quick to make, can customize flavor depending on your dessert just by changing pudding mix, consistancy was perfect and everyone LOVED it!  I made recipe exactly as is and will use it again and again.  Thank you

Soooo easy and yummy. I substituted white chocolate flavored instant pudding instead of plain vanilla and it turned out delicious. The consistency made it easy to frost cupcakes quickly.

This is a fantastically easy recipe! I wanted to make a light, fluffy frosting to use on some cupcakes. I wanted to use my decorator bag to make a swirl on the tops with the frosting and this fit the bill. As I was making it, I realized I made a huge mistake! I didn't wait for the cool whip to defrost completely, I just put it in a bowl with the milk and mixed it with a hand mixer. So much for gently folding it in! Oops! I just added the pudding mix (only had chocolate) and it still turned out great. Not sure if the consistency would be any different had I done it properly, but this worked for what I wanted it for anyway. We even splurged and ate TWO cupcakes which I NEVER do!!!

This was really tasty and creamy.  I used chocolate instead, because I prefer it.  I had a hard time getting the cake to not get in the frosting as I was spreading it, but i don't blame the recipe for that!

I followed the recipe as is.  Ended up with a bitter after taste from the vanilla extract. Had I not used the vanilla would have given 5 stars.  I was hoping the vanilla would give it and extra vanilla flavored punch.  Overall, great recipe, I'm just not going to put in the vanilla next time!

I iced a homemade strawberry cake (recipe found on Allrecipes, of course) and EVERYONE loved it. I doubled the recipe and had extra! Guests got the brilliant idea to dip chocolate chip cookies in it, fruit, brownies, topped Jell-O with it, etc! Definitely way more than just a cake icing! I could've eaten the whole bowl by itself! Does not taste artificial! Tastes awesome!

I whipped my own cream but otherwise this was pretty tasty.  I'm not big on frosting at all, I usually scrape it off.  So I think this is a perfect substitution.

I used recomendations from other reviewers and reduced the milk to 3/4 cup and since my husband has allergies to nuts I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla. Next time I might try lemon. I loved it and will definately use again. I used it to cover 3 8in round cakes. Thank you!

Very good taste but I needed more of a "white" color for Strawberry Shortcake.  I used a little less milk for thickness 3/4 cup.

I have used this recipe mutltiple times I have used it on my sons first and second birthday cakes and plan to use it on his third, it was such a big hit with my family and coworkers, the only thing i did different I used two 8 oz containers of cool whip it sets up on the cake better and I like a more fluffy frosting other than that this recipe is absolutely wonderful!

Great versatile recipe. It was perfect for the Coconut Cream Cake from this site. I used cocnut cream pudding mix instead of vanilla and it was perfect! I can't wait to try this wil other flavors. Will make again and again. Thanks for sharing!

I am not a fan of sickly sweet frosting, so this is perfect in my book! I used chocolate pudding, and added about a quarter cup of unsweetened cocoa. It dried a bit unevenly, but it tasted great!

YUMMO!  I used this frosting on cupcakes for my son's 2nd birthday.  It turned out great and tasted so yummy some kids came for a second cupcake.  Not sure what happen to some of the reviews that say they got a runny mess.  Make sure you mix it up enough so that the jello/milk and vanilla mixture can form (like you were making pudding), then fold in the whipped topping.  I love the idea of this frosting because you can make it into so many different flavored frostings.  Want it to taste a little like banana... use banana flavored pudding mix.  Oh.. and if you want it a true white frosting...use white chocolate.  It comes out true white.  The vanilla pudding mix does come out a pale yellow.  I didn't mind though, cause I colored mine with food coloring.  So many different options to use and try.  Loved it!

Great texture, fantastic flavor, we use this a lot and people always ask for the recipe. I was thinking about trying it with chocolate pudding just to experiment.  Make sure you follow the mixing order to the tee or you'll end up with gunk.It's good tasting gunk though!

Delicious ! I had left home to get the ingredients, and came back to pull up the recipe, and the website wouldn't load for me all day ! But the fact that I had just glanced at the directions and remembered how to make it makes this recipe that much more incredible (so easy!). Delicious ! I used lite whipped cream. I doubled everything except the milk because I had a stacked White cake. Topped with strawberries and blueberries :)

I used this on Root Beer Cake II and it worked well on it.  I did use slightly less than the called for amount of milk, to make it a little more firm.  I probably wouldn't use it on a "regular" cake, but it was good for this particular cake.

Love this recipe!! I added pink food coloring to it for a bridal shower cake. It turned out beautifully. But, word of advice, do NOT leave the cake out for too long, as the frosting will melt. Take the cake out just prior to cutting it.

I made this w/ the Coconut Cream Cake from his site & they complimented each other really well.  The only change I made was to substitute the vanilla w/ coconut extract.  This is not your traditional frosting recipe if your looking for something resembling the store bought types.  It's a creamy, fluffy topping that would go well w/ a lot of cakes, cupcakes or even to top cream pies.  I'm looking forward to experimenting w/ different versions.

I made this yesterday with chocolate pudding for a french vanilla cake.  This is really good.  Nice change from the canned frosting.  I am going to try this makeing my own whip cream as some others have suggested.  Thanks for the easy frosting.

I goofed on this and accidently used 1 oz pack of pudding instead of 3.5 ( white choc flavor) but it was STILL the best easiest frosting I've ever worked with. I'm the wierdo that hates frosting in general, esp. the thick buttercream sugar/ butter concoction...I like my cake plain, but since cakes don't look very pretty plain and I was making this for my parents b-day I needed a frosting. Light, not too sweet, and went with my stawberry cake. can't wait to try it with the right amount of pudding next time to get more pudding flavor.

My husband loved it; me...not so much. It sets up nice but stayed too soft for my liking. The taste was very good.

I made this to go on the one bowl chocolate cake I. I made chocolate frosting using the same idea. I used chocolate pudding and added 1/4 c of melted chocolate chips and followed the directions. So good!! I ate all of the left over frosting by itself.

This recipe is quick and easy, and is NOT so sweet that you can hardly eat the cake!!  I add a packet of jello or Kool-aid to give it a particular flavor.

It is good but it does taste like cool whip which is why I gave it 3 stars. It is a good alternative to regular frosting and it is light and fluffy. As cool whip does it melts in the heat so keep it in fridge or a cool place.

Good recipe when in a hurry since cool whip is fast and easy, but it definitely tastes like cool whip.  I doubled the recipe and folded chopped strawberries into 1/3 of the frosting for a filling.  Frosted a white cake and topped with strawberries, it was good!

This is my go-to frosting recipe whenever I either want to make a cool summer dessert (like pop cake) or a quick dessert for a get-together.

I always get compliments on it whenever I make it. I used it with the Pink Princess Cake today, and it was perfect.
Nice complimentary frosting.

I used this recipe to frost my mom's birthday cake and it was great!  I used cheesecake flavored pudding mix.  It was nice and light and not overly sugary or fattening like some frostings can be.  My mom loved it!

This frosting is so easy and great if you don't want a heavy, sugary icing.  It spreads easily and the recipe makes more than I needed for my daughter's birthday cake.  I used the leftovers as a fruit dip.  It was delicious with grapes, strawberries and cherries.

AMAZING frosting!!! I used fat free whipped cream and it turned out great! I may never use another frosting, homemade or store bought except this one!!! I used it on top of "Strawberry Cake II" here on this site. I chopped some white chocolate chips and topped the frosting with them!

Good and creamy! Pretty low in fat/kcal. I put it on a chocolate layer cake. It should be put in the refrigerator a bit so it sets up a little better, especially if using it for a layer cake. The flavor was light and not overpowering. Will make again :)

I used this frosting on a chocolate layer cake for my daughter's birthday this weekend and it was AWESOME. I generaly do not like cake and frosting I hate but this I loved. It was just right. I did refrigerate it for 10 min. before frosting to let it become thicker.

This was great. I typically scrape off most of the icing from cakes because I find them too sweet, but this "icing" is perfect. It was a great complement to a strawberry cake. I think it would also be good on a chocolate cake if chocolate pudding was used in place of vanilla.

This frosting is super easy to make and really delicious, especially if you are a Cool Whip lover like I am.  I used this frosting for my family's traditional pineapple cake, which we have every year for our Christmas dessert.  The cake has always been frosted with a simple vanilla icing, but this year I wanted to try something different, not so sugary sweet and this worked out great.  Since this frosting is lower in fat, it definitely cuts out a little of the guilt, which I love!

Thank you for posting this recipe!  My grandma used to use this frosting all the time at Easter on her angel food cake.  (That is the best cake to put this on!)  I made the angel food cake with this topping (I'll call it that because it definitely cannot be compared to frosting, although I think it is better) for a function and work and have been asked to make it again by numerous people.  Super easy to make and DELICIOUS!

This is basically the same recipe that I've been using for several years. The only difference is that my recipe doesn't use vanilla extract. Many people have complimented this frosting because its not too sweet.

Perfect alternative to super-sweet store-bought frosting. Easy to make, no electric mixer needed, inexpensive and delicious. I used it for cupcakes for my son's fourth birthday. Both the kids and the moms ate it up! I got several compliments on my "homemade" icing :)

Awesome frosting!! I didn't add the vanilla because I wanted a lighter taste.  I will never use store bought recipes again. I'd like to try it with chocolate pudding sometime. Thanks for the recipe!

This was just the cool whipped frosting I was looking for! It's got that extra something besides plain ole cool whip! Very light and refreshing for summertime! Will definately make again!

Love this topping/frosting!  I used it with lemon pudding in a layered angel food cake and fresh fruit.  Friends and family gave it rave reviews! Definately use again with different flavors.

Wow!  This is a really great recipe.  Very easy and much healthier than most frosting.  I made a two-layer strawberry cake and used this to frost the outside.  I didn't use it between the layers of the cake after reading other reviews that it doesn't function well between layers.  This is an excellent fluffy and light frosting.  Definitely a keeper.

I used this frosting to fill chocolate cupcakes and it was stellar! The only thing I didn't like about it was the lack of shape it held in rosettes on the finished cupcake. The taste is lightly sweet and rich, but not at all overwhelming. As a filling for cupcakes, it's spectacular and goes quite well with dark chocolate.

Very simple and tasty. I made a few changes simply because I didn't have vanilla pudding and I was making a chocolate cake. I used chocolate pudding mix and it wasn't chocolatey enough so I folded in some spiced hot chocolate. It turned out light and yummy but I don't think as good as if I had used vanilla pudding. Will do that next time.

Very easy, and very good. It was a great light frosting to go with the chocolate chip cake I made for my husband's birthday, and would work well for numerous different things. I will definitely use this recipe again in the future.

This was by far the easiest recipe ever, and not to mention YUMMY! I even realized (after the cake was frosted) that I had forgottend the vanilla extract but you would have never known. This is a definite keeper!!

So easy to prepare.  Was a big hit with my family.  I made this for my 4 y/o son's birthday cake.  He asked for 'pink' cake with whipped cream.  Who knew there was actually a recipe for whipped cream frosting.  I think I might even try it with other flavors of pudding mix.

This is my favorite frosting--good for all cakes. I recently used this to frost an ice-cream cake, and it was wonderful, and not so heavy with butter, everyone enjoyed this one much better than regular frosting and it's better for you too. And so easy!

Absolutely divine! I used fat free sugar free chocolate pudding and skim milk and it was incredible. This doesn't even need to be put on a cake, it's so good. I put the extra in a small glass and added some sliced bananas and it was like low cal mousse. I can't imagine ever using a buttercream frosting again!

We just got back from a Memorial Day work weekend down the shore and were requested to bring a dessert.  I used this reciped on a vanilla layer cake.  Out of the 15 desserts brought, our cake was the first to go AND on the first night.  The rest were "picked over" the next night.  VERY DELICIOUS, LIGHT and EASY to make. Next time, I will try adding coconut as suggested by a previous reviewer.  5 star YUM!

Wasn't able to go to the store myself so instead of vanilla pudding, I ended up with Godiva White Chocolate Vanilla Bean Pudding in my frosting. Oh my goodness, I will never EVER use plain vanilla pudding in this!! It was SO good!

made this recipe with yellow cupcakes and Pina Colada pudding. topped a few with extra coconut and added food coloring to half the batch. Generously frosted 21 cupcakes. ( I never get 2 dozen from a cake mix lol). Made sure to mix milk and pudding for 2 min as package suggested. perfect!! Will be making again.

I made it as directed, it tastes good, but is like whipped pudding.  No where near stiff enough to use to frost a cake and decorate.  I very much doubt some of those pictures are made with this recipe.

I made this frosting for my Strawberry cake and it was the best frosting.I followed what one reviewer said was to add 3/4 cup milk instead of one cup to keep it from being runny.The frosting came out perfect.I didn't have a full package of Vanilla pudding mix.I just mixed up what I had and added some Whipped cream.I will be making this again.

I always make this cool whip frosting, summer and  winter etc.  it’s not too sweet the only drawback is that it must be refrigerated. Don’t worry, the cake is eaten quickly.

The only thing I did differently was to omit the extract. I followed the recipe as written and it was great.

Please help!
I have made this frosting 3 times and follow directions exactly and use the tips from other bakers but this frosting doesn't pipe like shown in the picture.  It's soupy.   It does taste good though.

Delicious!  I made some ahead of time to practice making colored cupcakes.  I took them into work and every person who ate a cupcake commented on how awesome the frosting is!   It is “whippy” frosting with great texture and flavor.  It held up really well in the fridge.  So much better than store bought frosting.  I will definitely make this yummy frosting again.

I'm trying to expand my baking abilities and focusing on filled cakes. I made one and instead of going with canned frosting which I cannot stand, I went with this. It worked well, though at the time of frosting it was a bit thin but nothing too awful. I did find, in my case using a vanilla pudding mix and sugar free Cool Whip, by adding a cap full of lemon extract you get a very nice flavor.

I made chocolate frosting. It’s Easy to make & the family loves cool whip. I did reduce milk to 1/2 cup  since It made the frosting firm and I could  add a teaspoon  of milk at a time to change the consistency.

I followed the recipe, did not make any changes, came out great. Definitely tastes like cool whip but I do like cool whip. I made this for the coconut poke cake. Recipe for coconut poke cake just call for cool whip on top not the pudding part. I was making this for a cook out on a very hot humid day and thought the pudding added to the recipe would help the cool whip not melt all over the cake. It worked. I kept the cake refrigerated until ready to serve but the cake was out in the hot weather on a table in the shade for about 2 hours and it did not melt all over the cake, success. Everyone that tried the cake said it was very good.

Made this to top a strawberry box cake mix from the store.  The consistency is great, but I couldn’t get over how much it tasted like the instant vanilla pudding (I know, I know - it’s the main ingredient!).  I ended up adding about two tablespoons of regular sour cream and that helped.

The 1st time I tried this I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really good! The next time I tried cheesecake pudding instead of vanilla because I wanted my frosting white and I also omitted the vanilla this time. It was delicious and I received so many compliments on my cupcakes! Also, I felt like it was thicker and much easier to pipe the cupcakes. Held up really well! I will definitely be using this recipe more often!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was so runny. After reading reviews, I should have doubled the pudding or used heavy cream instead of milk. Unfortunately, I made the frosting then read the reviews. It does taste great, just super runny.

Ok so I thought this was a different recipe that I looked at, and started making it when I realized the mistake I was too far into it to turn back, and I was doubling it! So I continued and it wasn't thick enough , I added 8 oz heavy whipping cream and beat it on high for a few minutes and it turned out to be one of the most delicious icings I've ever made!! Perfect for strawberries and chocolate cake!

Pleasantly surprised. 
I have been looking for Pastry Pride to no avail and my boy's birthday was near. I decided to give this frosting a try, and it is great for kids' birthday cakes. I didn't pipe it, but I think the consistency may hold up to it. Will try again.

We LOVED this frosting! I do think it does have it's place, though...I made a rainbow gelatin poke cake for the girls' Birthday, and I think it was perfect for that. I am curious to try different flavors too, particularly chocolate. This would be AMAZING on a strawberry shortcake-style cake. I don't think I would use it in place of our favorite buttercream icing, but if you want something lighter and more 'refreshing', this is the way to go. I will definitely making this one again~YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

It tasted very artificial at first but for some reason like an hour after I mixed it it tasted better.

Followed instructions to the letter. 

Super soupy.  WAY too much vanilla flavor. Nearly inedible.

Very light and added a little almond flavoring. Only problem is you have to keep in frig before serving. Easy to add color to it also.  Wish I could add a picture of completed pull apart cupcake Barbie cake I made with this.

I only used 3/4 cup milk and this turned into a runny mess. It tastes fine and luckily it's for a 2-year-old's cake so he won't care that it looks pretty terrible. I'm not sure what I did wrong. I was really excited to try this!

Good frosting recipe. I used 4oz of cream cheese, only a half packet of vanilla pudding and a little cream to make it spreadable.

Absolutely delicious!  Used this as frosting on an angel food cake with strawberries. Used the leftover topping to dip strawberries in and LOVED!  This could be used as a fruit dip alone. Definitely something I'll make again!

Tasted too much like cool whip. I used it for a cake, but maybe it would be better on cupcakes.

This was easy to make and really light tasting. I made it with white cake mix...did 2 circle pan cakes, put a full layer of cool whip alone in between the two cakes, then this recipe's frosting, with strawberries on top. It tastes like strawberry shortcake. It was a big hit at the bbq!

My only comment/suggestion would be to refrigerate the frosting for about 15 minutes before applying to the cake. Or if you know how to thicken a frosting, do that...I don't know how to do that.  It's a little soft and started to just barely slide down the edge of the cake. My cake was cool so I know that wasn't the issue. But other than that, no complaints. I'm really happy to have found this recipe.

Strawberry Jello, berries and piped frosting.

 I used half and half. I added fresh raspberries on Strawberry Jello that was firm then made topping stars with frosting piping bag. Looks good.

I used 3/4th cup of milk to make it thicker and one and half tubs of cool whip. This taste great, not like Bavarian cream or plain cool whip. Everyone loves it. I sliced strawberries on top . Could also add in finely chopped fruit directly into the topping! Great find.

I used less milk (3/4 c)  based on the "runny" reviews but I think that made it a little too thick and the consistency doesn't look as smooth.   I thought the taste was pretty good, but not fantastic.  Since I altered the recipe, I'm giving it an extra star because the consistency would have been better with 1 c milk.  Tip:  Do not use FRENCH vanilla pudding unless you don't mind that the frosting is yellowish.  Also, if making a double layer cake, you might want to make a larger portion of this.  I barely had enough to cover the cake and I think it would be great with a thick layer of frosting in the middle and top.

I made the frosting with two tsp vanilla, common brand tub of whipped topping, and 1lg package of instant vanilla pudding. I frosted a 9x13 cake, and refrigerated it for one hour before serving. Everyone loved it! So many compliments!

i use chocolate pudding instead.. im a girl who loves me some chocolate.. 
so i used chocolate pudding and i also did this .. once i did everything as instructed i put it back in the cool whip container and put back in the freezer for around a half hour or so just to let it get a tad bit firmer.. so when spreading its easier .. love it dead simple and fast

Just made this for the American Flag cake from this site. Very easy, quick, and good with out using straight cool whip.  I normally make everything from scratch but being 38 weeks pregnant I was looking for something tasty yet quick. The texture is thicker than just whip and the vanilla flavor really comes through. Excellent & exactly what I was looking for!

This is exactly what I was looking for, a homemade version of the whipped (not whipped cream) frosting used in place of a butter cream by bakeries.  If you enjoy the whipped alternative from the bakery,  and if you are not opposed to cool whip, you will likely enjoy this as a frosting.  
Made exactly as written with brand name ingredients, stuck with regular versus diet products for texture, no skimping.  I would like to see it just a little thicker so rated 4 stars.  (Used for cupcakes, not sure it would have stayed well on layers.)
I believe a 5 star recipe requires no significant alteration of measurements or major ingredients when tried exactly as written.  Made again with half the milk and a tablespoon more powdered sugar, and was even more pleased with the results.   Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy, quick, and delicious!

I used French vanilla pudding mix & 3/4 cup of milk. Mix it thoroughly so it won't be grainy. Set It aside to thicken. My family is spoiled so I whipped a pint of heavy cream to stiff/medium peaks to replace the cool whip but I didn't add any sugar. Add the thickened pudding by mixer for a smooth and even blend. Cover and refrigerate until it's showtime! 

It's smooth, fluffy, pipes well and doesn't run. Just what I needed for this birthday cake!

So light and not too sweet. I used heavy whipping cream in this recipe and added small amounts of milk at a time to get it to the consistency I wanted. I used chocolate pudding mix on devil's food cupcake. Delish!! I'll be using this recipe for now on. THANK YOU!!!!!

I wanted something light and not so sweet for my son's cupcakes for a class party.  This was perfect!! So easy too! I did follow the advice from other comments and only added 3/4 cup of milk. it was sturdy enough to pipe.  My only gripe is that it's kind of yellowish in color where I was wanting more of a white color.  Perhaps next I'll use clear vanilla  extract.  Overall very very tasty  and will be making  again!

I love this recipe.  It helps if you beat with wire whisk for 2 minutes before you fold in the whipped topping.

I made a double batch and instead of using 16 oz of cool whip I used 8oz of cool whip and 8 oz of heavy creamer . Tastes amazing and is slightly thicker.

Frosting is easy to make and holds up much better than traditional whip cream. I found it was enough to frost the tops of two round 9" cakes with a few extra swirls on top and a little around the edges, I made  a12oz tub of cool whip worth plus 2/3 cup milk and 1 and a half pkg of pudding mix. I think next time I will double the recipe so I can cover the whole cake.

So easy! I used a sugar free white chocolate pudding mix, 1 1/2% milk, and left out the vanilla. It came out really tasty, and now I am thinking of other flavors that might be good. This was really light and fluffy, perfect for the chocolate cake I put it on.

I made this w real whipped cream for a lemon cake and I found this to be tasty, but very runny.  Maybe i will use less milk next time.  Or maybe it was the lemon juice that I added vs the vanilla extract?  I would love some advice.

made this following the directions to a T.  Was very runny even after sitting back in the fridge for a while.  I added about 1/4 cup powdered sugar and 1/4 block of cream cheese.  Rather than fold them in I tried whipping it in my kitchen aid to make it fluffier.  Finally it worked...however, the taste was very bland and almost flavorless.  Not to mention it was still a bit on the soft side so there's no way I could have piped anything!! I used it on top of my son's strawberry birthday cake and really wish I just bought something instead.

Maybe sometime when I'm in a pinch I will follow the recipe and use Cool Whip - but since I used this for Easter I decided to use Heavy Whipping cream. This was so good. Since I had some left over I made chocolate cup cakes for (the neighbor kids) and filled them with it - I had to get it out of the refrigerator because a spoonful every now and then was so tempting!!

I made this for coconut cream cupcakes.  Turned out great.  I did substitute coconut cream pudding for vanilla and coconut extract for the vanilla extract.  After missing, I let is set in the frig for about an hour.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for sharing.

FINALLY! Finally I've found an icing recipe that's not too sweet and still very fluffy. Perfect for cakes that need icing that doesn't overpower the taste of the cake itself. Yes, I could have used plain whipped cream but it's too bland without the vanilla pudding. :)

I didn't want anything too sweet on my strawberry cake. I added this as the frosting and before mixing in the cool whip I added mashed strawberries. This was delicious, light and not too sweet. EXACTLY what I was looking for. Thank for this recipe!!

This is now my go to for frosting!! I've never liked the heavy buttercreams you usually get on cakes or store bought but this light & fluffy & delicious!! I used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla cause it was for a chocolate cake but I can't wait to try other flavors. It tasted like a chocolate mousse, everyone at the party adored it!

I made this with light cool whip, skim milk, and added half a scoop of vanilla protein powder to counter the carbs in my cupcakes. What a refreshing alternative to sugar laden store icings! I will be using this for years to come. A+ recipe!

I did this recipe, and follow the instructions to the T. I did fold the whipped cream with the pudding mix, and it water down, put it in the freezer to get harder. Not great icing for on the run or last minute put together.

Easy! Delicious! But if you need it to be white, choose a pudding flavor like coconut (or maybe French Vanilla?) because regular vanilla pudding is distinctly yellow. The cool whip lightens it up a bit, but not completely.

Great basic and quick recipe. You can also make your own whipped cream of course if you don't like the artificial taste of cool whip. I happen to like cool whip sometimes as it reminds me of my childhood! Any type of pudding flavor and extract can be substituted to coordinate with your cake flavor. I like to use lemon pudding with lemon or vanilla extract. The possibilities are almost endless!

This was very good and SO easy.  Once the Cool Whip thawed, it was mere minutes and piped just fine onto cupcakes.  I used white chocolate pudding because that was in the pantry.

I love this light and fluffy frosting!  It tastes FABULOUS, and it's not so heavy--I don't feel as bad about making my huge swirls on the tops of my cupcakes. I also love that I can make this sugar free, if I need to.

This is the best frosting. I replaced the vanilla extract with coconut extract and put it on Coconut Cream Cake I by GPAIN on this site. Perfect! I think you could change the pudding flavor and make all kinds of frosting with it.  Thanks

Best Frosting Ever!  Experiment with different flavors of Jell-O to make different flavored frosting.  Lemon seems to be a hit for people I make it for.  This frosting is so light that it makes a great dip for fruit.  Just add more cool-whip, and use fat free cool-whip for a healthier version.

Absolutely wonderful! The possibilities are endless. I used SF/FF lemon pudding and SF cool whip becuase my husband is a diabetic. It tasted delicious! A new fav in our house.

Delicious!! I have made this a few times now using different flavors of pudding and everyone loves it. I frosted cupcakes with the vanilla version, and used it as a fruit dip with a cheesecake version. Always using sugar free, fat free ingredients!! This is a keeper.

This recipe was good overall, but I wonder if it could somehow work with regular pudding.  The instant pudding leaves a almost metallic taste to the frosting...I'm just not a fan of instant pudding in any fashion.  I liked the lightness of the frosting, but will experiment with puddings and fresh whipped cream.

We loved this light cool icing.    I enjoyed this recipe because it is not heavy like a buttercream and is perfect for the summer.  After folding in the whipped topping, I refrigerated it for a couple of hours to stiffen it up.

This recipe made great frosting for my confetti angelfood cupcakes! I used white chocolate pudding and almond extract instead of vanilla pudding and extract and it was wonderful! There are so many possibilities for altering this recipe that it can almost be put on any dessert! Yummy!

This was good, but I would recommend using regular whipped topping instead of low/non-fat because it doesn't keep its shape as well.

Like everyone else says, it was perfect, not too sweet.  Plus, it held up well, unlike all other whipped cream frostings.  I used it on Jenny's Black Forest Cake and I got raves.

Loved it!!  My husband made a mistake and brought home low fat Nurti-Whip.  It was still great.  I put in a bit of meringue powder and, without chilling, used a piping bag.  It held it's shape perfectly.  Thanks.  Can't wait to try it with non-low fat nutri-whip.

We had this frosting on chocolate cake last night...and it was good. But not excellent. I was hoping for more of the whipped frosting you get on a cake when you buy a cake from a bakery. I will use again but it won't be my "go to" frosting.

Awesome!! Just what I was looking for. Not sure what some are talking about when they say it was runny. I did use whole milk and whipped it with a whisk until completely mixed. Great texture and flavor. Even better once chilled. Can't wait to try chocolate.

Tastes a lot like cool whip only and I love cool whip . Not sure if it's best for a cake. I even doubled the recipe with only one tub of cool whip. I just hope it holds up until party time.

This was good, but not quite what I expected. "Vaguely resembles Bavarian cream".....not exactly. Tastes pretty much like when you mix your pudding up with Cool Whip and eat it. Definitely better for you than some of the other frosting options..I put it on a coconut cake and the combination was good, but I'm not sure it will be a regular in my recipe box.

The frosting was quite good.  What really impressed me was how versatile it was, you can pretty much use any kind of pudding to make that flavor icing.  So much better than store bought because it's not as sweet and is very light and fluffy.

great flavor and makes a generous amount of frosting.  the only downfall is that it comes out yellow because of the vanilla pudding so when you dye it the color doesnt come out very clean.  i was hoping for a pure white frosting and was dissappointed so i put red food coloring in it and it turned orange/pinkish.  everyone loved the flavor tho.

this is a lovely recipe!  my teenage daughter and I are experiencing the world, this year the fourth of July was spent in Japan, we are dealing with high humidity so I was concerned about our traditional frosting recipes but after reading the reviews for this one we decided to go for it, we frosted a two layer white cake but like other reviewers we chose to use a blueberry filling rather than try this frosting. I also used a vanilla sugar free pudding and Watkins double strength vanilla and only 3/4c milk, this was fabulous!!! light and fluffy held its shape well only catch...I was hopping for a more "white" frosting and ours was a tad yellow, No matter the weather this is a winner!!!

This frosting ROCKS! I am not fond of most frosting but this one was light and fluffy and not too much on the sweetness. I didn't use any vanilla extract and I only used 1 1/2 cups of milk. Put on angel food cake... MMMM I think I am going to eat the last peice now. Two thumbs up!!
