I tried this recipe and was very pleased with the flavor and texture of the mushrooms, baste several times to be sure the marinate stay on the slices, do not over cook.

We thought they were great.  But then, we love tequila!  Wish I'd had a margarita with them....

This was delicious.  But if don't like tequila, then this is not for you.  My only change was that I marinated the mushrooms in the sauce for about 30 minutes instead of brushing it on.

Very simple and tasty.  I didn't slice the portabello's but grilled them whole.  No leftovers!
