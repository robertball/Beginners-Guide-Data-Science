Very good and one of the easiest bread recipes I've come by. One negative is the yeast amount should be increased to 2 1/2 teaspoons.  I followed the recipe the first time and it took way too long to rise. I did NOT use a bread machine. If making by hand, just throw all the ingredients into one bowl and mix. No need to proof the yeast, it will still rise (make sure yeast is fresh). I've kneaded this both by hand and using a dough hook for a good 5 min. This dough comes together well and is not sticky, so kneading by hand is a cinch. Instead of using extra flour when kneading, which can toughen and dry the finished product, spray your hands with PAM or oil and knead that way.  No sticking and no extra flour needed.  I let this rise in a warm oven until doubled, then rise a 2nd time in a (9x5) loaf pan.  Baked at 350 for 20 min. Brush with butter when it comes out and cover loosely with foil to soften the outer crust. Great crumb and texture. I will make again.
TIP - I use 2 cups white flour and the rest wheat flour.  As a general rule, I always add one tablespoon powdered gluten for every cup of wheat flour I use in any recipe. This keeps the bread nice and chewy.

This bread came out very nice.  Instead of using  bread machine I mixed all the ingredients together in a stand mixer, let the dough rise and then baked in the oven at 350 in a loaf pan.  I used white wheat flour so came out very light colored.

This bread is wonderful! I put the ingredients in the bread machine set to dough cycle, after it finished I put the bread into a 9 by 5 load pan, let rise for 30 minutes, and then baked in the oven (350 degrees) for 27 minutes, I had the timer set at 30 but pulled it out a few minutes early, it probably could have baked the entire 30 minutes and turned out fine.  It almost has a sourdough taste to it but it is very soft and light.  I love it and so does the family! Can't wait to make some sandwiches with it.  Just for clarification I used reduced-fat cultured buttermilk that comes in a little jug like regular milk.  Thanks for this great recipe!

If I didn't have a favorite Italian bread recipe I generally use this recipe could easily become a staple.  I thought it was short on salt and yeast so I increased both without straying from the recipe too much - 1 tsp. salt and two tsp. yeast. I kept the measurements of all else the same but used bread flour for the all-purpose flour by accident (it's called making assumptions and not reading the recipe carefully - again).  In any case, this is all you'd want in a basic, everyday bread.  It rose, baked and sliced nicely and has great flavor (I DO think it needed that extra salt).   I'm not a big fan of whole wheat bread, much preferring white bread, so this was perfect for me with its mere 1/3 cup of whole wheat flour.  So if you're thinking this is a hearty whole wheat bread, choose a different recipe - or use this one, with half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose (or bread flour).  No matter how you slice it (ha!) this is a great bread, one of the better ones I've tried from this site.

This has become one of my very favorite bread recipes. My family and friends can't seem to get enough of it. Sometimes I substitute 1 package of Lipton Onion Soup mix for the salt to make a great-tasting onion bread.

Great recipe ! I drink buttermilk but didn't have any on hand, so I added one tbsp white vinegar to the milk - instant buttermilk ! Also used honey instead of sugar. First time using my Breadman - my husband and daughter really enjoyed it. Thank you !

This bread was awesome! I added a hand full of cheese to the bread machine. My boys ate the whole loaf. Delicious and yummy, thanks for the post (we ate this with the Roast Lemon Herb chicken recipe on this site).

This made a beautiful, light-textured, perfectly shaped loaf of bread.  I have a 25 lb. bag of bread flour, so I subbed that in place of the all-purpose flour.  Another reviewer recommended 2 1/2 tsp of yeast which I followed with excellent results.  I will make this again when I have extra buttermilk, however, my personal preference would be that this recipe needs a little more salt.  I usually make breads with more whole wheat flour, but I think the ratio of white/wheat in this recipe makes for a really nice light texture.  I made this using the bread maker dough setting, then I rolled it out, let it rise in a regular loaf pan, and baked it at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes.

I don't usually have buttermilk in the house, so a lady I work with told me to buy the powdered buttermilk.  I used(with the correct amount of water that  the buttermilk powder called for) it and it seemed to work fine.  Overall,I wasnt really impressed with this recipe, considering that it got 4 stars.  Maybe  I should have used real buttermilk.  I also am never really happy with anything I make with my breadmaker. So who knows!

I love this bread!  I love the tangy flavor from the buttermilk.  I used bread flour instead of all purpose and it turned out soft and fluffy.  I also used 1 tsp salt and 2 tsp yeast.  Such a nice loaf and a great way to use up my buttermilk.

This bread is light and delicious.  I increased the yeast to one full package, and used more wheat flour and less bread flour.  I used powdered buttermilk, and it came out fine.

Very tasty.  I didn't use my bread machine, I used my KA mixer instead but I think I should have let it work a little longer on the bread hook as it was kind of dense.  After I took it out of the oven I spread honey on the top.  I think I've finally found a good copy of the bread one of our favorite restaurants on Chincoteague Island makes!

Taste was good and texture fine. Had to add more flour because it was very sticky with amount given.

This bread was fabulous!  Excellent recipe!  I made using the ingredients listed and in their original measurements.  I don't have a bread machine, so I mixed with my Kitchen Aid mixer, let rise and bake.  It was wonderful!  Thanks for sharing.

WOW! Soft. Moist. The little bit of wheat flour made a big difference in making the bread a little more tasty. I increased the yeast and sugar as others said. I kneaded it for 10 minutes, mainly using oil on my hands. I only needed a bit of flour on the surface towards the end of my kneading.  I let it rise covered in a warmed oven until my 2 fingers pushed into the top left an indentation. I dont have a loaf pan so I decided to make a freeform loaf.  So I pushed the bread with my finger tips into a big rectangle, letting the air out ("punching" dough is not literal). I rolled it like an egg roll, put it seam side down in a lightly oiled pyrex, and I put it back in the residual heat in the oven for a half hour. I took it out, cut slits on top, brushed with milk, and baked it at 350 until the top was lightly browned. Next time I would put cornmeal on the bottom or oil it more than I did. I buttered it when it was finished to keep the crust soft, but next time I wont because the slight crust on the bottom was so good. Im proud of my work-this is what allrecipes is about! I just had pb & j....and I am looking for an excuse to have another slice. :) 11/1/10: I am still making this. Recently I used the yeast specified in the recipe. It didnt rise much after I shaped it into a ball, so I flattened it and let it rise an additional time before shaping it for the third rise. It actually came our better this way (original yeast amount, extra rise in between). Check b4 and after photos.

LOVE LOVE Love this bread!  The texture is just like store bought sliced bread.  I can't believe it but it was just that soft and lovely and sliced up so nice.  Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 10 is I increased the yeast to 2.25 tsp since the written amount just doesn't seem to be enough to do the job, based on other breads I have made from this site.  I also used olive oil instead of butter just cause I didn't want to dirty the container to melt the butter

Really, REALLY easy. No bread machine, just a Kitchen Aid mixer and oven.  I proofed the yeast with the buttermilk and honey (I used honey instead of white sugar) for ten minutes in my mixer bowl, then added the butter, then the combined the flour and salt.....I used all whole wheat. I needed no extra flour to get the dough into a ball but my dough hook had a heck of a time grasping on to this dough. I kneaded it with the hook as best I could for five minutes, then set it to rise in a greased, covered bowl until it doubled on a warm heating pad. When it doubled, I formed the dough into a loaf and set it in a loaf pan and drizzled it with butter and set it to rise again on the warm heating pad. It was a slow riser but the bread smells amazing. Even using all whole wheat, the bread came out soft and springy and the smell when it's baking.....amazing!

Wow, this bread is amazing!  I was short of buttermilk, and replaced 1/2 cup of buttermilk with skim milk, and it was fantastic.  Even my kids asked for more.

This is a great recipe, easy and deliscious. I did substitute 2 Cups all-purpose flour and 1 and 1/3 cups whole wheat flour instead of the measurements provided. I had to add another tablespoon of flour while the dough was mixing as it was a littlel wet. It didn't seem to matter that the buttermilk was cold. (I usually place room temperature ingredients in the bread machine, which may be the trouble people have when their bread turns out like a brick!)

Great bread. I took the advise of other reviewers and increased the yeast to 2 1/2 teaspoons and used 2 cups all-purpose flour and 1 1/3 cups of whole wheat flour. I also used ony 1 tablespoon white sugar. I did not use a bread machine, and just mixed all ingredients and kneaded until smooth and elastic, let it rise, knead again and put into loaf pan and let it rise again. Baked it 20 minutes at 350 F. 
My family loves it. This recipe is worth keeping.

Nice, soft bread with mild flavor.  We had it for breakfast this morning and it was delicious with almond butter.  We are looking forward to making sandwiches with this great loaf.

A delicious, soft bread.  I had buttermilk to use up, and someone on the Recipe Buzz suggested this recipe.  So glad they did!  I used 1 1/2 teaspoons Bread Machine Yeast and white whole wheat flour and both worked out just fine.

Excellent bread. Loved the tang that the buttermilk gave it. I used 2 cups white flour and the rest whole wheat. I used the bread machine to make the dough, then put it in a loaf pan and baked for about 25 minutes @ 350º. The second loaf I made, I let it rise a second time, punched it down then put it in the loaf pan. I think it came out a little better.

We had some leftover buttermilk so I thought we'd try this bread. My husband is the master of the bread machine, but not always a recipe master. He used 3/4 TABLESPOON of salt instead of 3/4 teaspoon! I thought it'd be ruined, but it was great! Don't know why it says 6 hours start to finish. It was 3 hours in our machine, set for a 2 lb loaf.

This bread was so good! I had forgotten to check and see if the dough was too wet in the bread machine and it wouldn't rise properly, so I took the dough out when the bake cycle was just going to start and placed it in a bowl with a little extra flour then placing it in a buttered bread pan and letting it rise for about 20 min. in a 175 degree oven loosely tented with foil. When risen I lightly brushed the top with melted butter and baked at 350 until browned and done. In the dough itself the only changes I made was using 1/4 cup honey and only 1 rounded tsp. of sugar, about 1/4 cup less all purpose flour and using wheat flour in its place, and using melted margarine instead of butter because that's all I had. The bread was very moist and flavorful!

This recipe works really well for me.  I use my Kitchenaid mixer to make the dough, using slightly less flour than called for and adding until I have the correct mixture.  I also use the buttermilk from our cow, so it is not sour yet.  I add a splash of vinegar to the liquid.  Use it regularly and substitute different flours in addition to the whole wheat( buckwheat, sunflower seeds, semolina....whatever is handy)

Oh my, very good bread!  Soft and fresh tasting.  Makes great toast.  I did adjust the yeast to 1 Tbsp. and the salt to 1 1/2 tsp.  Also, used bread flour.  Perfect.

I love this bread recipe!  The texture is so light and fluffy!  I substituted bread flour for the all-purpose flour and also used 2 t. yeast and 1 t. salt as recommended by another reviewer.

For years I have searched for a recipe that compares to my Nana's dinner rolls. When she passed away, she took her recipe with her as she never measured ingredients nor wrote anything down. I made your dough in my bread machine then divided it to make pan rolls. Once I removed them from the over, I smeared butter on the tops like Nana used to do. Delicious! Thank you for sharing.

I've made LOTS of bread and this is one of the best. Has almost a french bread flavor. I made no changes to the recipe.  Great taste. Great texture. (UPDATE) Used all whole wheat flour and added 2 pkts of instant grits. Sounds strange but the flavor was awesome.

This was fantastic! I made buns using this recipe (for slow cooker italian beef for sandwiches) and they were perfect! Delicious, light, tasty! I did as many others suggested, used 1-1/3c whole wheat flour and 2c a/p flour.  we ran a 'quick' errand while i left it for a 2nd rise, and we took longer than expected which made me nervous but they were fine - i might have to let them rise longer next time too, well see, but we're defintely having these again!

Very tasty!  I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour  and the rest unbleached white.  I warmed the buttermilk, butter,and sugar on the stove, then poured it in with the yeast.  The dough was pretty stiff to knead, but rose beautifully on each rise, and baked up into a very tall, soft loaf.

I made the dough for this using the bread machine, let it rise in a 9x5 loaf pan and baked it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. Very yummy with jam :)

I use 1 1/3 c wheat flour and 2 c white bread flour. Turns out amazing every time - soft with nice crust - and lasts much longer than the recipes from the bread machine manual.

I don't have a bread machine, but it turns out great when I make it by hand.  The first time I made it, I stuck to the recipe, and though I liked it, I thought it was a bit bland.  So because of that I make the following changes:  2 T butter, 2 T honey (in addition to the sugar), 1 tsp salt, and 1 cup whole wheat flour (the rest white).  I think these changes made it tastier.  I've also made them into rolls (12), and we liked those even better.

I cook this in a bread machine and it works great. I also replace the buttermilk with 1 cup of plain yogurt mixed with either water or milk to make 1.5 cups. I don't normally have buttermilk in the house, but I always have plain yogurt. It works fine.

This is a wonderful, hearty bread that I will bake over and over again.  Instead of baking in bread machine, my sister instructed me to remove after the dough cycle, knead gently and allow bread (covered with towel)to rest on sprayed countertop for 10 minutes.  Place in greased loaf pan, score, cover with towel and allow to rest 20 minutes.  Proceed baking in preheated 350 degree oven approx. 25 - 30 minutes or until golden brown and crusty.  I create steam in oven which makes bread nice and crusty but this step is not necessary.  This bread is always a BIG success.

Wow, this bread is great!  I used a package of yeast and made the dough in my bread machine.  When the dough was done, I took it out, punched it down and put it in a buttered bread plan covered with saran wrap.  I let it proof in a cold oven with a warm bowl of water sitting on the rack under the bread, for 40 minutes.  When it was done, I took it out, removed the saran wrap and water from the oven, preheated oven to 350 degrees and brushed the top of the bread with an egg/water mixture then baked for 30 minutes. This is one of the best breads that I've made.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great bread.  I had done a couple of adjustments.  Instead of butter I used vegetable oil.  I also used only 1 1/2 cups white and increased the whole wheat by 1 1/2 cups (also used the 1/3 cup recommended in the recipe.  Set the bread maker to whole wheat setting.  Will make again.

Fabulous bread!  I followed the recipe exactly except used bread flour instead of all-purpose.  The bread was light and fluffy and soft.  Our family loved it!

I make this exactly as written except as one review stated it needed a lot more yeast.  I use about 2 1/2 tsp quick rise yeast and make it in the bread machine.  It also makes great buns!

Very nice bread.  Good, full flavor from the milk.  I used sour milk instead of buttermilk and it worked well enough.  I don't think this bread needs toasted or buttered or anything--the flavor is wonderful all on it's own.  But it does work well as toast--had some with my omelet this morning.  I did the dough in the breadmaker and baked at 375 for about an hour.   Thanks for the recipe!

I make this bread at least twice a week. I do not have a bread machine so everything is done the good old fashioned way-by hand. I do warm up the buttermilk a little to help activate the yeast. Other than that everything goes in the bowl and the result is a fast rising dough. I bake it at 350 and it comes out perfect every time. Family favorite for toast, sandwiches or just plain.

I've made this bread several times and really like the texture and flavor.  The recipe is a tad too big for my machine - the top overflows and is undone.  I'll get around to experimenting with yeast and flour amounts one day, but until then, I just cut off the top and enjoy the rest of the loaf!

I just got a bread machine and am a novice to cooking in general. I had some leftover buttermilk and decided to try this recipe. It was the easiest thing in the world and the bread came out perfect!! Light and crunchy crust, moist and chewy on the inside - Delicious!!! Oh, and I did warm up the buttermilk first.

I don't have a bread machine, so I bake mine in the oven at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes (or until a toothpick inserted near the middle comes out clean).  We absolutely love this bread!  I've made it twice now and it comes out somewhat heavy, but I'm using mill-ground Wheat Flour, which probably makes a difference.  However, I made this for Thanksgiving with my boyfriend's family and out of the 3 loaves I made, this was everyone's favorite.  I almost made it the following weekend for a get-together and even the kids were getting third helpings!  I will continue to make this bread since everyone keeps requesting it!

Great tasting bread!  I was looking for a recipe to use up some buttermilk and came across this one.  I'm so glad I did!  I used 1 1/3 cups wheat flour & 2 cups white flour.  Baked in out my basic white bread setting in my breadmaker.  It turned out so moist and light!  Can't wait to make again!

Very easy and straightforward recipe that results in a soft, light bread loaf.  .  I followed the recipe exactly, including the amount of yeast (unlike other reviewers) and did not have any issues.  The bread smells delicious while cooking in the bread machine.  Note that there is only 1/3 cup of wheat in this bread, so I would not describe it as "wheat bread," in terms of either nutrition or consistency.  It is a white bread that reminds me of light potato-based breads.

Really good! I was out of bread flour so my normal recipe wasn't an option - this is the only non-white bread that didn't need bread flour or vital wheat gluten. It came out excellent!

I did add the full tsp of salt and the 2.5 tsp yeast, I think it would have been too bland without it. But it rose fantastically!!!!  My children loved it too, so that's 8 thumbs up. :)

Easy recipe. Very tasty! Made twice. First time I made a loaf. Second time I made 5 rolls and a small loaf. First loaf I added crushed pistachio's. So good. Second batch I added poppy seeds. Both breads very good. Will make again.

Very good bread. I used 2 1/4 tsp of yeast (1/4 oz) and the dough cycle on my bread machine. Baked in a 9 x 5 bread pan at 350 for about 40 min. Worth a space in my recipe file.

Excellent bread. Followed the recipe and agree it needed a bit more salt. As for the yeast, depends on your bread machine. Mine is a longer program so 1 1/2 t yeast was perfect. Great use of leftover buttermilk. Loved it enough that I will have to buy some for bread making

This bread was a thumb's up from my picky son! I did make two needed changes-- I upped the salt to 1 teaspoon and the yeast to 2 1/2 teaspoons. I mixed in the bread machine and baked for 30 min at 350 in my oven. Perfect.

Great flavor and so easy! I used only AP flour, as I didn't have any wheat flour on hand. I also used the dough setting on my bread machine, and then baked it in a glass loaf pan in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes. Turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

So fluffy and delicious! We loved this bread; I shared with my sister and her family and they loved it too! I opted to use all white whole wheat flour and was glad I did, since it made it a little more wholesome and didn't negatively impact the texture or final results.

1st strike is that the directions only work for a bread machine.  2nd strike is that the recipe calls for 6 hours of cooking time.  This has to be a mistake.  Finally, there's no instructions on what order to put the ingredients in, it just says to check with your manufacturer, not very user friendly especially when other bread recipes are so much more helpful.

Very tasty bread... I had no buttermilk on hand - used lowfat instead with a little bit of vinegar and it came out fine.  Will definitely make again, would love to try with buttermilk.

My best attempt at bread to date! Everything I wanted in a bread; soft, great tasting, good crust! And without the use of a bread machine. Thank You MSACEBAKER

I only had all purpose flour, and my machine has a max allowance of 4 cups of flours, so I used 4 cups. When it was done I brushed it with butter, and it's without a doubt the best bread I've ever had, and certainly the best thing that's come out of my bread maker.   Thanks for the nudge in the right direction.

Definitely the salt needs to increase to 1 or 1 1/2 tsp. Made into baguettes and mixed the dough with hands. Good recipe.

I just made this in my bread machine - turned out GREAT.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I just added vinegar to skim milk, let it sit for 10 minutes, and then used it.  I used only 1 c regular flour, and the rest whole wheat.  It was delicious!

I used 2 C white flour and 1 1/3 whole wheat, and it was still very moist and yummy.  I think I'd have the buttermilk at room temp next time as I had to let it raise longer in the bread machine that my dough cycle allows (took it out and baked in reg loaf pan).

I had some leftover buttermilk so I decided to give this recipe a try. I doubled the recipe to make two loaves and made it the old fashioned way (without the bread machine). It turned out beautifully. Rose very well and the finished bread is very tender and light. One tip that works well with any bread is to butter the tops immediately after removing from the oven, take the loaves out the pans and cover then with a wet tea towel to cool. The wet towel adds moisture to the crust and makes it very soft and tender when done. Enjoyed this recipe very much and will probably have to buy buttermilk in the future for the purpose of making this bread. Thanks for sharing.

Delicous Flavor!! The bread was a little dense. I think it needed more needing time. Next time i will try heating the buttermilk to see if it cuts down on the rising time. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This bread was excellent, and has now replaced my old favorite white bread recipe. I use the powdered buttermilk instead of fresh, and it comes out soft and delicious. Next time I'm going to try adding a little honey!

I didn't use a bread mixer for this.  I wanted a wheat bread recipe with buttermilk and this was great.  Thanks!

Absolutely my go-to recipe for the older model (upright) breadmaker my cousin picked up at a garage sale. The recipe fills the pan perfectly, smells divine while baking, and when I have buttermilk on hand I always make sure to bake a loaf.

I also used the powdered buttermilk as described in a previous review and the loaf turned out beautiful but it didn't have a lot of flavor.
