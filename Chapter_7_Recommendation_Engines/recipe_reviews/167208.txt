Great combination...however, the turkey with a half of an avacado is better.  Yum!!

I altered it a bit to fit what I had on hand, so I used Swiss cheese and potato bread.  I also decided I was in the mood for a warm sandwich, so I broiled it open and then put the two halves together.  Super sandwich.  I enjoyed the mild flavor of the cheese and apple (macintosh) as you were able to really taste the mustard/honey/mayo mixture.  Will do this on a regular basis.
