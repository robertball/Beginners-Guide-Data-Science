The directions for cooking the frozen peas are wrong. Cook peas according to package directions except reduce the cooking time to 2-3 minutes. Peas should be crisp .  Allrecipe.com  edited the original directions  and this is the correction. Also be sure to drain the rice if there is liquid left after cooking. Do not over cook the wild rice.

I found the original directions easy to follow...also very accurate.  The finished dish was lovely and well received.

Not sure why a big deal was made of the boiling of peas.  Two minutes seemed to work well.  Isn't that  the time the original poster suggested???  It does depend on what type of peas you are cooking as well.  Early, sweet peas cook faster that the larger variety.  Two minutes was perfect for me.  Loved it and will continue to use this.  Thank you for sharing...very lovely, crispy crunchy and thoroughly enjoyable.

Extremely good recipe.  Nice and light tasting.  I added some halved green grapes.  I will definitely make the again.

A great base salad that you can add or delete ingredients according to taste or what's on hand.  Omitted tomatoes and added quinoa since I didn't have enough rice and it was good. Will make again!
