Just a couple of changes to a tuna melt, but its nice when someone writes it down.  We use some "Finlandia Rye" pitas, there about 4" to 5" across, but the extra flavour and nutrition is great.  Like many others, I now omit the salt, or I use a pinch of sea salt.  My favourite change is to replace the tomato with red/yellow/orange bell pepper.  Just cut the pepper into 1/2" strips, put about 4 on a pita, between the cheese and tuna.  Bell peppers have three times the vitamin c of an orange.

On a whim I tried this for a family visit today.  Not only were there no left overs, but my 2 year old daughter loved it!  A nice variation is to add two hardboiled eggs chopped.  Very delicious recipe!  The best part was how quick it is prepared...I was able to spend more time visiting than cooking.  A+ in my book!

Very good and enough for two lunches actually even when you cut the recipe in half!  I used "Barbie's Tuna Salad" from this site instead of the tuna salad with the recipe because one Tbsp. of mayo for a whole 6 ounce can of tuna just doesn't cut for me.

I've made something like this for a long time.  Make the tuna the way you like it, then add some sunflower seeds and raisins (YES its GOOD!!), use the pita or very sourdough bread and then top with very sharp cheddar cheese....melt as directed!  AWESOME!!!

I LOVE tuna, so this made a great lunch! I never thought of using pita bread and it was a really nice change. Unless you're a saltaholic, leave it out as the tuna has plenty by itself. I'm not crazy about relish in my tuna, so I omitted it but added some chopped red onion along with garlic and onion powders and black pepper. Thanks Glori!

I haven't made these for dinner but am trying to find new things for hubby to take to work since he works 12hrs and is on nights.  He loved these.  I mixed the tuna mixture and put it in a bowl in his lunch box with freezer squares to keep cold.  I sent his cheese and pitas in seperate ziplock bags and he assembled at work then microwaved.  He loved them.  Put his diced tomatos on top after everthing was heated up.  Thanks for the great post.

This recipe was so tasty and a snap to make.  I didn't have any dill pickle relish, just sweet relish, and thought it still tasted quite good.  Don't bother putting in the 1/4 tsp. salt, there is so much in the tuna and cheddar cheese already.

Very good and very healthy.  I will definitely make this again.  I didn't leave the pita's in the oven after adding all the ingredients.  I think you need to leave them in for about 8 minutes to get the tuna inside hot and the cheese to melt all the way.

This recipe is very yummy!  When you're in the mood for something a little different than just plain old tuna.  I didn't have cheddar on hand so I used shredded velveeta and it was really great!!!  Thanks for posting this one!

Shazzam are these good!! Followed recipe exactly, 'cept added a little diced celery and red onion, black pepper and minced garlic to the tuna. Did 1/2 the pitas w/ cheddar, & other 1/2 w/ jarlsberg, the latter gobbled up more quickly. My 3-year old blurted out, between big bites, that these were "tasty fish pizzas!"

This was tasty, but I didn't like the tomato in them.  It made them too moist.   I would also salt the tomatoes before putting them in - I like my tomatos with salt.

I haven't eaten tuna in 4 years due to food poisoning from tuna fish. I thought I'd give this a try for my first attempt back to tuna and was glad I did! I followed the recipe, except omitted the salt. I sprinkled the tuna mixture with sea salt. I warmed the pitas on 400 F for 5 minutes as directed, then added the tuna mixture. I put the pitas back into the oven for 5 minutes, but the tuna was still not hot. I recommend 8 minutes in the oven to fully heat through.

This is a nice simple tuna melt.  I used sweet relish for my husband (because he doesn't like dill) and dill for myself.  I think it is much better with dill! I also added lettuce and red onion. Yummy.

I didn't rate 5 stars because i made mine a bit different... To make it less fattening i did not use mayo, instead once i toasted the pita for the first 5 minutes, pulled it out and spread a layer of Atheno's red pepper hummus over the pita, then topped it with plain tuna, which i diced dill pickles in and placed sliced tomato on the tuna then topped with cheese and put back in the oven for another 5 minutes. ABSOLUTELY delicious! Quick and easy, great for lunch!

The recipe didn't state if the filling was to be put inside the pita.  However, the picture shows it as an open-face sandwich so I split my pita and then toasted it in the oven.  You would also be hard pressed to get 6 servings out of this.  Some reviewers commented that it was too salty.  I made the recipe exactly as specified (except I used a slice of provolone cheese) and didn't find it salty (and I'm not a salt person).  I couldn't really taste the dill so I would either leave it out next time or maybe add more.  I would probably also increase the relish--I could taste it but it was pretty mild.  I would add onion to give it a little kick.  This was very easy to make and I will do so again (although I will probably double it), perhaps tinkering with it just a bit.  It would also make a great cold sandwich--stuff in a pita and top with chopped tomatoes, shredded cheese or anything else (someone mentioned raisins and sunflower seeds were good).

I'd Great suggestion!! I am a tuna lover and am always looking for different ways to try it. I added some jalepeno's to the top and a bit of garlic powder for a little extra kick. So easy in the toaster over. Last but not least very low in calories and filling.

I had great expectations for this recipe after reading all the rave reviews, but it came out disappointing.  The toppings were good, I even added slivers of onion, but pita bread just did not work out being baked in the oven.  It came out way too crispy and hard, especially after following the suggestions to bake the sandwiches a little longer to make sure the tuna mixture was hot enough. I used 3 cans of tuna and increased the mayo, relish, and dill weed accordingly to cover 6 pitas.  I also sliced up two tomatoes and used 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese.  However, I'll be sticking to tuna burgers (made with hamburger buns) from now on if I want to make a hot alternative to a cold tuna sandwich.

My husband asked for seconds & that's a first!! I didn't have any dill relish so I just finely chopped two tiny baby dills and did add just a bit of red onion and a dash of garlic powder. Yummy! & sooooo fast!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Pretty good, although not kid-friendly in our house.  The mixture turned out a bit dry and chewy - I might try plain pitas next time instead of whole wheat, and add a bit more mayo.

Thought this was different.  I must have cooked the pitas too long.  I would make sure to keep a closer eye on those next time.  The outer edge was a bit hard for my taste, but overall a good recipe.

I thought these were delicious! I did not add the tomatoes. My husband thought there was too much relish, but I could barely taste it. I only used 4 pita rounds, and it seemed to work perfectly.

A nice twist on the tuna melt!  I used albacore tuna, 1/4 tsp. onion and garlic powder, eliminate the dill, and sliced grape tomatoes.  I really like the addition of pickle relish!

This was a great recipe.  I didn't have any problems with pita getting too hard, I just made sure to cook it as directed.  I used the suggestion from below to replace the tomatoes with red bell pepper (fiancee doesn't like tomato).  Also didn't used dried dill and I think it was fine just with the relish.  Overall, tasty recipe and very easy and quick to make!

OK, so 2 cans of tuna made 2 pitas for me.  Maybe I'm weird, but I like a lot of tuna on my melts!  So for me it was 4 servings (with the pitas cut in half).  I used sweet pickles instead of the dill relish and left out the salt.  I also used way more than 2 Tbsp of mayo - again, I gotta taste it!  Love the tomato!  Nice alternative on the traditional tuna melt.

I used this recipe with homemade pitas and, although it was very good, I was more impressed with the pita than the filling.  Plus, it only made enough for 3 good sized pitas.  I like tuna, but this recipe is just not that great.  I probably will not make this again.

Same as a regular ol' tuna fish sandwich. I do use mustard instead of mayo though because I can't stand mayo. Good but not really a new recipe.

This is a heckuva good sammy!  I wanted something fast before running off to softball tonight, and found this!  I didn't have pita's, so I actually used regular bread and just buttered the outsides of the sandwich - cooking for about 5 minutes per side.  Very quick and yummy for those on the run kind of nights!  Thanks!

This is pretty dope, and that's coming from someone who is ussually repulsed by tuna. Would make again. 

Criticisms I have are that the pita is a bit too crunchy after all the time it spends in the oven. And the dill is a bit overpowering of the other flavors.

Nice and simple.  I use potato bread instead of pitas because I tend to let pitas languish in our home without using the rest of the package (whereas potato bread is easy to use for lots of other things.)  I also cooked it in my panini maker.  Simple dinner that even my toddler will eat!

Made it for dinner. I had fresh dill on hand, which I mixed with the mayonnaise (left out the dried dill). Added on Gherkins and spring onions (had it in the fridge) Needed a bit of taste - next time I might add some chilies.

I didn't add the dill or relish to this because I didn't have them on hand.  I did everything else as written and I sprinkled the top with seasoned salt.  Excelente!  I've been wanting to find some easy, healthy meal alternatives and this made a delicious and fulfilling lunch.  Thanks so much! Will make again.

Wow..this was very good! I 'can' a lot of fish and am always looking for new ways to serve it.  This was a winner!  Next time I might toast the pita's over our gas stove top burner to make them crispier.

These were very good and a different way to enjoy a tuna melt.  I added an extra Tbs of mayo to the mix and topped it with more cheese.  I also only toasted the pitas for 4 minutes and they were just fine.  Thanks.

Great sandwich! I decided to take advantage of the pita's pocket and stuffed everything inside rather than laying it on top. My whole family liked these.

Pretty good, minus the relish.  The pita came out too hard also.  Other than that, pretty good.

Really good! Just made it for me, so I used a whole wheat pita pocket and mixed 1/2 a can of tuna with nonfat mayo, coleslaw mix, 1/2 tsp. dill weed and 1/2 tsp. all purpose salt free seasoning. Topped with nonfat cheddar cheese. I think I would use more seasoning next time. Easy and very tasty. Thanks!

These Tuna Melts are so quick and easy to make. My husband and I love them. I leave out the salt like others have suggested. It doesn't need it. I also never thought I would like dill pickle relish because I don't like pickles but it tastes good mixed in with everything. Thanks for this recipe.

Tuna melts on pita bread is a great idea - I would just recommend toasting the pitas a little longer for a crispier "crust" and 2 cans of tuna make about 4 servings, not six.  Also, no need for extra salt!
Any cheese works great - my husband loved his with jalepeno jack.
Thanks for a great idea!

Very tasty- I could eat this for dinner a lot!  I melted the cheese in the microwave to speed up the process, and it was still excellent.

Really tasty.  Even my 2- and 3-year-olds enjoyed these.  Next time I would omit the salt.  I had to add more mayo to get rid of the really salty flavor.  They are a new favorite.

I heated the pitas but did not reheat after adding the tuna mixture and it was wonderful.  I will try again as a melt.

Yum!  What a delicious, fast meal.  I added some chopped red onion and omitted the pickle relish (because I didn't have any) and it was still great.

VERY good!  My husband used to make this but on a Hmaburger bun, using pita bread is SO much better!  This was quick, easy and tasted great!

These were GREAT! I’ve never added salt to anything, let alone Tuna fish, but it made it much better. I will add more mayo next time b/c it seemed a LITTLE dry to me. It was really, really good. It would make a great lunch. We discovered that my fiancé doesn’t like pita bread, so I might try it on normal bread, but other than that, I love it and will definitely make it again!
