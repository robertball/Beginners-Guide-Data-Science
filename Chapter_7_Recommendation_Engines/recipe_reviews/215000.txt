I submitted this recipe and would like to note that the oil can be cut back.  I made a batch about 1/2 the size of the original and only needed about 1tbs of olive oil.  I also added some fresh lime juice for a little more moisture.  Happy cooking!

Absolutely fantastic! I actually reduced the oil to just a couple Tablespoons, and I added some lime juice.  I just couldn't get enough of it.  Absolutely yummy!  I also suggest white corn instead of yellow.

I served this in a baked toritlla bowl, with romaine lettuce and grilled blackened chicken.  It was excellent!  I don't care for red onions and left them out of the recipe.

This is super quick and easy and healthy! I sauteed all of the veggies and added green chiles. Great recipe to make big batches of and portion it out for snacks at work! Also a FANTASTIC filling for Quesadillas!

Really phenomenal.  I was hesitant at first about all the different kinds of oils and vinegars going into it, but it really all comes together.    The normal recipe barely fit in my largest mixing bowl!  But it's a very versatile dish -- I've put it with risotto, baked potatoes, salad...  Make it on Monday and it will last you through the week!

GREAT flavor!  Yeah, the oil can be cut back to taste, and I like a lesser bean-to-corn ratio, so I only used to cans of beans and a full can of corn.  But it's awesome as is.

wonderful! i thought i love Pampered chef's version of confetti but this is better. more of a kick! making this for my daughters wedding reception as the color scheme is black red and white and the beans and peppers tie into that. Great for a Texas appetizer or side. thanks and will try to submit a pic for you too

Great salsa!  I was going to double it, but then I realized that 16 servings IS A LOT OF SALSA!  The only thing I adjusted was the black beans. I used 3 cans, and it worked out perfectly.  Fair distribution of all parts---just how I like it.

Very good! I only had green bellpepper on hand and it was still delicious. Reduced the oil as suggested by others. Thanks for sharing this recipe I am sure this one will be used many times.

Very good.  I use much less oil, I just eyeball it.  It has a nice flavor, I've made it 3 times this summer.

This is a delicious salsa! It makes a LOT and it's just me and my husband at home, so I froze most of it. My only tip is to freeze it without the black beans, and add those when ready to serve. (They get really mushy when they thaw and really affect the look of the salsa, although it still tastes great.)

I cut up yellow and red cherry tomatoes since I had an abundance in my garden and added it withouth the oil.  Then I just used salsa dry seasoning for a low cal dinner.  I crunched up tortilla chips into it an ate it like a salad.  Very filling, good and low cal

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it! Used this recipe as a layer on a Southwestern Salad and it was a huge hit!!!! Simply layered cold items; shredded lettuce topped with this recipe then topped with warmed items;  ground beef tacos filling that I reheated & melted cheese on top. Finished it off with crushed taco shells ....everyone had second helpings!

Made this for a party at work and everyone loved it. It made a big batch so we had some leftover for the next day and it was even better!  Definitely a keeper.  I did cut back on the oil as suggested and used only about 1/3 cup olive oil and it was perfect.

Recipe is great as is! For me, decreasing the Olive Oil would only need to be done if you are making a smaller batch.  I did not see any other type  of oil to be added as one reviewer mentioned and I imagine a good olive oil is key to this recipe.  Healthy and delicious!

i quartered this recipe and it made a LOT.  i used 2 ears of fresh grilled corn (leftover) instead of frozen, and added two fresh tomatoes that i lightly smashed in the food processor, which made it moister so i could skip the oil.  

this is not a great "salsa" but it is a GREAT filler for quesadillas or juevos rancheros, so its a keeper for me.  and my 19 month old loves to eat it straight (he's a bean eater).

Love this recipe because it is healthy, tasty, and so versatile!  You can basically add whatever you like...I added a can of drained Rotel diced tomatoes and chilies, and cut back the beans to 2 cans (one of black beans, one black eyed peas). Also, if you don't have time to make the dressing, you can use bottled Italian dressing (even the fat free kind tastes great)  I make it all the time, especially in the summer.  We serve it at parties with tortilla chips, but you can eat it as a salad for a side dish or I like to wrap it up in a tortilla and top it with cheese.  Very tasty.

Love it!! I made just a couple of modifications. I cut the oil back to 1/4 cup.  I left the vinegars pretty much the same. Maybe not 2 T. but close. Not with the balsamic, though. I ran out. I also substituted a diced jalapeno for the green pepper and omitted the hot sauce. Love it love it love it!! I made it last night and it did not have time to sit. Still very tasty. Even better this morning when I tried it.

Huge crowd pleaser!!! My suggestion: ADD AVOCADO CHUNKS BEFORE SERVING :)) 
My family and my husbands family requests this EVERY time we get together. Since finding this recipe in 2012 - I've made this countless times to the point I know it by heart. Sometimes I find the olive oil drowns the spices and vinegars. I keep the olive oil amount but double the vinegars/spices/garlic. I use a lot of cilantro and add a few dashes of Sriracha hot sauce. This makes a lot of salad but its very versatile. It can be added to your tacos, chicken, salad - even to your pasta sauce. It keeps long and it tastes fabulous !!!

I halved the recipe, since there is only 2 of us.  I didn't have a green or yellow bell pepper so I just used my orange one.  I also doubled the cilantro. Didn't have garlic so I used garlic powder(proportionally), I want to use real garlic next time. I gave it a 4 and will make it again, my 23yr old gives it 5 stars, she loved it.****Just made this again at our beach vacation and my niece(14) liked it so much she asked if I'd make it again for her birthday.  So here it is a few days later, I let her make it and she has an entire bowl (for 8) to herself.  lol.

Perfect base ingredients, but after I made it, I felt that it was missing a flavor burst, so I added a small packet of Goya seasoning mix (orange packet) and that did it!

While I typically make things as written the first time and then modify if I want, I did use two cans of black beans, and one can each of pinto beans and black eyed peas. Everything else was exactly as written. We all really enjoyed this! It does make a lot, and I do think the oil could be cut back some. I like the idea of adding jalapeños, and I do think it helps to let it sit for a while to let the flavors all meld.

This was very good. I used it for shrimp tacos, nice flavor, enough crunch. It does make a ton, I quartered the recipe and still have a lot left over.

Really liked the ease of this. Tasty, Easy and cost effective.
The only change I will make is to add some jalepeno to it for a little heat.

I love the apple cider vinegar in this!   I added Dijon mustard instead of hot sauce and cilantro.

It’s very good, although after tasting it I changed a few things to up the flavor. I increased the onion, garlic and hot sauce slightly, and I probably tripled the cumin and the cilantro. I used 1/4 the oil and added a little salsa for moisture, as well as lime juice to taste.  Oh, and I probably doubled the amount of corn. I agree that this seems more like a salad than a salsa.  I did make only 1/4 the recipe to use it as a side with the excellent Chili-Lime Kabobs from this site.

I cut down the serving portion to just a quarter size of the original.  I didn’t have bell peppers around but diced up some cerrano peppers and a jalapeño for some heat.  It’s great for tacos and garnishing main courses and topping on burrito bowls.  Added to the menu whenever we do taco night!

This is dish fantastic, easy to make & the leftovers keep a long time in the fridge.  It is more like a very healthy, low calorie side dish or salad than a salsa.  Bright flavors & fun colors make it an instant hit at any pot luck!

We really liked this except that I felt it needed just a little more ummphh.   I added in the juice from 1/2 of a lime and I used at least a Tablespoon of Sriracha, if not more.   Otherwise a perfect recipe for our tastes.

I made this salsa as an appetizer for both Thanksgiving and Christmas. I followed the recipe exactly as listed. The salsa received many compliments!  This was a perfect app for my son who is vegan. He happily took the leftovers home. The recipe makes a lot.  It's very healthy and I served a couple different kinds of tortilla chips with the salsa.

This was amazing!! I don't follow recipes exactly, i usually tailor to my taste, which is why i don't leave reviews. I hate when people alter recipes and review.... That being said... I was skeptical because I'm not a huge lover of beans. I don't dislike them. Just not my favorite. The only major change i made was using only two cans of beans. Three would've been a little too much for me, let alone four! The sweet of the corn, texture of the beans, sweet peppers, heat from the hot sauce, and cumin made this the perfect combo. My friend looked at the sample i offered him (he's my Guinea pig), and put exactly two pieces in his mouth (one corn kernel and one bean). He always gobbles my food up! Then he proceeded to scoop it into his mouth and came back for thirds! Haha! We actually finished a huge bowl within two days.  I don't think I'll ever eat tacos again without this salsa. Maybe next time there will be leftovers for lunch... Haha! Oh, i did follow the posters suggestion to cut the oil.

Few changes! Per other reviews only used 1/3 c olive oil, 1 T each of the vinegars, splash of lime juice, extra hot sauce( we like it a little hotter), 3 cans black beans, 1 can of black eyed peas, 3 or 4 slices of canned jalapeno peppers and green onion instead of red onion! Looks great! Couldnt wait  to try it so put in frig for an hour-- Wonderful!!

This recipe was a huge hit at the fire station. It was the perfect addition to fish tacos! I used both white and yellow corn, and also added a fresh chopped jalapeno to the mix. Very well received.

Yummy! I doubled the cumin, and used 1 yellow bell pepper along with 1/2 of a red bell pepper. It was a little heavy on the beans, but with nice corn chips, it's great!

This was very good!  And easy to make!  We ate the whole bowl!  Didn't have any peppers so I just used one can of black beans and one can of corn.  It only had a chance to marinate for about 2 hours before we ate it, but it was really yummy!

Love this recipe!! I've had something very similar at my favorite fish restaurant in Atlantic City, NJ. Make this to accompany anything we throw on the grill and love to eat the leftovers!

I make this all the time, and everyone who has ever had it loves it! It's great with chips, in tacos, or right off a spoon. I never put in the hot sauce (I don't love spicy), and I always half the amount of oil and each vinegar. This way the flavors of all the vegetables really stands out, and it isn't quite so greasy.
