They turned out great. Ended up cooking them for about an hour and just as Chef John did covered them with foil for the last 15 mins. Served it with Chef John's version of  beef tenderloin in caramelized pan sauce and a side of broccolini on hot cast iron serving platters. A fancy meal for sure and it was amazing. Thanks Chef John for another great recipe......keep em comin!

Presentable and very tasty. My Easter dinner guests  were very impressed. Mandolin came in handy. I used disposable muffin tins for easy clean-up.  Will definitely make these again. Thank you CJ.

They turned out so cute and fun to make. I found if I stack the potatoes up above the edge of the cupcake cups, they turn out better with more of a flower effect. They are yummy as well as lovely.

Very nice presentation.  I had to exclude the cheese as I needed a non-dairy side dish.  It still was quite tasty.  Next time I will arrange the potato slices on more of an angle in the muffin tray...the ones I merely stacked didn't look as "flowery" as the ones I put in on an angle.  I also covered the muffin tray for the first 4o minutes and then uncovered for another 15.  This ensured that the potatoes cooked all the way through when covered and then added a very nice golden colour with them uncovered.  No burnt bits at all.

For anyone interested in how these reheat, I tried one in the microwave and that was a little soggy. I tried one in the oven for about 12 minutes and that was better, but became a little too hard - difficult to cut through with a regular knife.  I think the best way is to microwave to get the middle hot, and then stick in the oven for about 5 minutes to get just a touch of that crispiness back.

Sooo good! The texture is perfect, crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. They are also beautiful and impressive. Cooking for 2 so we had leftovers which I froze and then put back in the oven to reheat--not amazing like the first bake but still really good. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this twice and the second time was better. It does take a bit of practice getting them to look even a little like roses. I actually put the potatoes on edge instead of stacking them, and it made them very pretty but a little dry.  My family really enjoyed them both times, probably as much for the variety as for the taste. I love Chef John's recipes.

I seasoned the potatoes with white pepper, and a lemon herb mix. Cooked for one hour. Didn't need to cover it with foil, as the potatoes were actually cooked inside before the "petals" acquired the proper color. They were relatively easy to remove from the pan, but I caution other cooks against pressing the potatoes slices against sides of the pan cups when forming the rosebuds; they'll burn and stick to the pan, making it hard to remove the roses from it. I served this dish with roasted lamb shoulder at a Christmas party. Big success. Simple, a  little time-consuming, but totally worthy.

These were delicious, and really not that much work for something interesting and impressive.  My potatoes did start to accumulate moisture while I was slicing them (maybe I'm just really slow) and it made for some discoloration in the centers once they were cooked.  Next time I make this, I will definitely give them a quick salt water soak and pat down before tossing in the oil.

I used two foil liners for each cup. The potato goes in the top tin foil liner with a little hole poked in the bottom. Between the top liner and the bottom liner I put a small ball of tin foil. This allowed liquid to drain out. I made some with and some without the double liner system. The double liner did not leave the a potato slices sitting in a puddle of liquid and stuck to the bottom. Very tasty though. I put foil on top after 25 minutes as suggeste to keep the edges from burning. Took longer than 45 minutes. I  kept adding 10 min more. Probably took closer to an hour.

I used Yukon Gold and Red Bliss potatoes, and the salt seemed to draw out a lot of water from the potatoes before I was able to finish shaping. I wasn't sure if the butter layer of the potatoes took but everything came out well. I cut the potato slices mostly in half and layered standing with cut-side down. Brushed with butter before baking and decided to dust with cheese after baking, not before.

We loved it-did a dry run today, will make it for X-Mas dinner.  We all like garlic so I will add a little garlic and use a little less rosemary, and possibly add a little butter or cheese to the top when they come out of the oven. They did look like roses, I put the larger slices on the bottom and smaller ones on top.

These were excellent.  Don't skip the rosemary; it really adds great flavor.  The only change I would make next time is to add less salt, since the Parmesan cheese itself is salty.  Yum!

This is good. It wasn’t as spectacular as I had hoped, but it is good. Good texture, but it tastes like plain potatoes with a little seasoning. I don’t think the parm added much. Also, 3 pounds of potatoes made 18 muffin cups worth, not 12. I made it exactly as the recipe was written. Also watched the video.

Way to much salt. I will reduce to 1 teaspoon. 
Also I will fill each muffin tin farther over the top then I did. Great flavors and pretty presentation

The wife and I really liked these. I would recommend cutting rec. in half for two people, also if you don't have a mandolin to get extremely thin slices the only way to get the rose shape would be to perhaps steam the slices in a microwave to get them to bend and shape in to the muffin tin.

Loved these roses! A little too salty for my taste and I'm a huge salt lover so I was a really surprised by this but I will make again, just with less salt.

Another Chef John great!  Took a walk on the wild side and used dill versus rosemary and smoked Gouda versus Parmesan.  Just fabulous! It's a keeper!

I made these vegan by substituting Miyoko's butter, and using a vegan parmesan cheese.  They came out great!  We ended up with 16 roses from 3 lbs of potatoes.

This is another great recipe from Chef John.   The seasoning is perfect and it is as beautiful on the plate as it is to eat.  The mandoline makes this an easy recipe.

I made this according to instructions and it was way too salty. Next time I'll omit the salt. Maybe to better "glue" them together I'll add some cheddar cheese?
Beautiful presentation with a little paprika.

Prep time depends on how precise you are with the potato slicing and how picky you were in the selection ( did not get just the right size but the Golden Yukons were only in a bag and some were much larger and were cut in half which produced a reasonable appearance.  The cooking time was over an hour to get the right doneness. Tastes delicious!  My wife has over 50 rose bushes and she was delighted AND wants them again.  I'll cut the slices a bit thinner and with practice, it should be even better.

I added minced garlic and it was delicious! A little on the salty side, but I maybe didn't use quite 3# of potatoes. 

The only drawback was they didn't stick together very well. I'm thinking  a tablespoon or two of flour might help with that. 

I'm freezing tonight's leftovers to see how they reheat. Will definitely make again.

This tasted great, but I my execution could be better. Since I don't have a mandolin, I think next time I'll just use my knife skills and slice them by hand. It's only my wife and I. We only need about 4 potatoes. Mine shrunk down quite a bit. It probably had to do with my pretty thin slices. I think an 1/8 slice might work best.

I halved the recipe and baked 6 of them using my toaster oven. I left out the rosemary because I had none and added some dried parsley.They were delicious and will certainly make them over and over again. They would be great for a dinner party and/or buffet. My husband and I ate all 6 with meat and vegies for dinner. 
Next time I will put less melted butter in each muffin cup and more melted butter in the mixture. I will also add some onion salt. Many thanks for this recipe.

Delicious! Effort required, but worth it. Took these to a holiday party and they were a hit. I added a sprinkle of garlic powder and onion salt to the tops right before baking. They cook down a little, so be sure and fill the muffin cups. Thanks to others who suggested using disposable muffin tins.

The "roses" didn't hold together after removing from the muffin tins (perhaps the over-sized muffin tins were too large and the potatoes too small?) -so I ended up combining all of the thinly-sliced potatoes in a serving bowl. Tasty side dish!

I did make a few changes only because I did not have the recipe in front of me. The ingredients were similar to those in the recipe.  They were absolutely delicious!!! I sprayed my pan with olive oil cooking spray prior to adding my potatoe slices. They were a wonderful addition to my dinner.

I have made these a couple of times.  If you cut the potatoes very thinly you can arrange them on their edge around and around and makes a much nicer presentation.  I also finished mine with a scoop of sour cream and some paprika.

Incredible tasting potatoes! Didn't make any changes. Will try thyme instead of rosemary but really like the rosemary. My "roses" didn't come close to looking like roses. Must have done something wrong. Will keep trying. Still tasted great!!

Presentation is beautiful but they turned out a little dry. I think if I make them again that I will cover the potatoes until the very end and put them under the broiler to brown the top.
