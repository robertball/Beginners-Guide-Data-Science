I altered this recipe. I turned it into soup and added two cups of chicken broth, two cloves of garlic, and some soy sauce. I used shiitake mushrooms.

Disappointed. I had to add ketchup and cheddar cheese in order to eat it.

I used chopped, canned mushrooms (yes, sacrilege, but our vegetarian doesn't like mushrooms), and left out the pepper. Added 1/4 c. chopped parsley for color and served it for dinner.  I thought it was a great use for tofu that hadn't survived compression in a pretty block for slicing.  It was a side dish for the rest of us with fish.  GREAT!

This is a good start, though the carrots seem out of place to me. I omitted the carrots and added nutritional yeast to make the scrambled tofu have a cheesy/eggy flavor.  I made this into tacos and it was delicious!

The recipe is a good start, but I would add chipolte peppers (or a good hot sauce) and some diced oven roasted potatoes next time.

Surprised how edible it was the first time I made it. Now I make it all the time with whatever vegetables I have on hand. I like to put a scoop in a tortilla with some hot sauce, maybe add some avocado. Great thanks!

This is truly delicious! I highly recommend, especially to vegans who desire an "egg" substitute entree.  Since first finding this recipe, I've made it two or three times per week. The seasonings and spices make this an amazing dish. Thanks for sharing.  PS. I sprinkled nutritional yeast on top to finish th recipe and give it a little"cheese" flavor

i'm a fan of tofu but like Kag824, i was disappointed.. i doubled the mushrooms and added some garlic salt and cilantro.. but this still tasted like it was lacking something.. in my experience tofu needs to be highly seasoned otherwise it's pretty bland.. i ended up eating this topped with jarred salsa

I made this on a smaller scale, and used regular mushrooms.
This was a great light dinner served with warm pita and some tamarind chutney.  Will definitely make this again.
