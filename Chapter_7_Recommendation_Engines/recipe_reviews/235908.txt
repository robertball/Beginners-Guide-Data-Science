What a fantastic recipe!  I changed it up and made this as a main dish for dinner.  I used bone-in chicken thighs and baked them in a 425 degree F oven for 35 minutes.  Spooned the sauce over top when they were done cooking.  I didn't have any peppers for the sauce, so I used a healthy tsp of sambal oelek (chili paste) for spice.  The sauce is just amazing!  Thank you Marion@Life Tastes Good for this outstanding recipe!  I will be making again and again.

This was so very good! I used 4 chicken cutlets instead of chicken wings! I cut the 4 cutlets into 36 strips then followed the directions as written using 2 sleeves of Ritz crackers. I baked them instead of frying. 400 degrees until cooked through...about 20 minutes. My family gobbled these up super fast! Perfect for a snack or a main course.

Oh a DEFINITE keeper!  I made these for dinner and since it was just two of us I went with chicken legs.  I skipped the frying because the chicken legs were pretty big in my opinion to do that - but followed the recipe to a T and instead, baked at 375 degrees until done (about 35-40 minutes).  Before baking I did spray with some cooking spray.  If I were to make the wings themselves I would follow the recipe.  However, the legs were crispy skin (just look at the photo!) and man, the skin, that was almost the best part of the recipe (with the sauce of course!)

These wings were simple and tasty. Love the sauce. Since we are heat wimps I cut the amount of peppers in half but they could have used more.  I didn't have high hopes of the cracker crumbs staying put during the deep fry process. Quite surprisingly they did!  I was a little overzealous with the addition of the sauce - I added a little too much making it pool around the wings which in turn made them less than crispy.  Next time I will add the sauce at the tail end of the baking time. Hubby liked them so in my book that's a win!

This was awesome! I loved the way the RITZ held up to frying...the sauce was fabulous. However, hubby said it was slightly too sweet for him. But that can easily be squared away, I thought it was fine myself. However, when serving the sauce with the chicken wings I strained the sauce of the bites of Serrano peppers and ginger due to a kid that has a gag issue...it's something that is not necessary but in my house it was. The whole recipe was just a knock out winner and believe it or not but after the wings were coated and baked, they still had a nice crunch to them. No one walked way from these babies. Will totally make again and again. Thanks Marion!

Omg so delicious! I change the ritz crackers to fine saltines as ritz are too buttery for me. Also the next time I do them I am changing the serranos to habanero,hubby wanted spicier. But his review was better than anything Buffalo Wild Wings makes by far. I also bought ginger paste instead of fresh ginger. Fried them a lil longer and baked less time. Thanks for the recipe! I will be handing this one down to my kiddos :)

We aren't big wing people so I used chicken breasts that I tenderized. The flavor was great! I also did not fry them I baked them and then broiled them on each side. I would make the wings for a get together though!!!!

My wings turned out to be a mushy, sloppy mess and left me with a mountain of dirty dishes. Based on all of the 5 star reviews, it must have been something I screwed up. Possibly my wings were too large, or the recommended amount of time in the fryer was not long enough because the skin on the wing was still mush (gross) and I was hoping for a nice crisp skin, or the sauce should not be added during baking because even with a light coating it caused the breading to become mush. Next time I will fry much longer than the recommended 1-2 minutes to crisp up the topping and the skin. I also see no need to add the sauce to the wings during bake time since you are dipping them anyway. If I did add the sauce I would add during the last 3 minutes of cook time. Like other reviewers said the chicken itself was very bland, as were the crackers, so you needed to drown it in the sauce to give it flavor. Next time I would season the chicken and the crackers crumbs with salt, pepper and garlic. The sauce was delicious, and definitely makes this recipe worth trying again!

I did not care for this. Here's why. I didn't fry, I baked. The sauce was too sweet. The Ritz didn't add a good flavor. For me, not a keeper.

These fried up a nice beautiful golden brown and the sauce was excellent. The chicken stayed crispy even though I basted them twice during cooking.Though the sauce was tasty the chicken was a little bland. I wiil definately try this recipe again marinating the chicken first or at least seasoning it. The star of the show was the asian american slaw recipe from this site that I served with it. Sooo good!! I'm hoping the leftovers hold up for one more day.

Tried this recipe exactly as written.  Absolutely awesome!  Only recommendation for future cooks...wear rubber/latex gloves and ventilate your food prep area.  Chopping the Serrano chillis was tuff!  Coughing fits and chemical burns on my hands!  Live and learn.  Sauce really made the chicken special.  Highly recommend.

We loved the breading on these! So good! The sauce was a little on the sweet side but we loved it all the same. I will decrease the brown sugar next time and then it will be perfect for us! Thanks Marion for a great recipe!!!
