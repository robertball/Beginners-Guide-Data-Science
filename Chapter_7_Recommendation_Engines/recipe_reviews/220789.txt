I just won the parboiled brown rice lottery hence my love for this recipe.  I used 3/4 cup of rice and 3 cups of water plus added 2 tablespoons butter, dried parsley, 1 tablespoon olive oil plus salt and pepper. Everyone in my house loves brown rice now plus it is healthier!

The footnotes about changing to long-cooking rice also have relevance to different brands of instant rice. I followed the cooking directions on my instant rice as it called for nearly twice the water of minute rice brand.  As summer hits, I don't care to stand over a boiling pot for 45 minutes so I generally switch to instant rice. This is a nice way to dress it up and I used the author's suggestion of changing the herbs and juice to go with our meal. I used a dry cilantro, a small amount of ground coriander and lime juice as the subs.  This was pretty good, cooked itself while I was outside, and went well with our grilled tropical chicken and fruit salsa. My only disappointment was that the lime juice and cilantro didn't really come through as much as I'd like. I would use fresh cilantro next time and a little more lime juice.

A good basic, but not sure what was semi-indulgent about it. Needed a lot more flavor and I wish I'd followed my instincts and added more herbs and lemon.

I added the pepper. It gave just enough spice to it. Love it. Will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe as-is and it was quite good. Just a nice, basic yet flavorful side dish. I'll definitely make it again, experimenting with herbs and flavor accents.

This is exactly what I was looking for - just a little oomph for brown rice! We love this and I don't change a thing. Thank you, Jarrie, for sharing just the recipe I needed!

Doubled the recipe to feed a large family. Definitely needed to almost triple the time in the microwave using brown rice! Came out pretty good though

I used brown rice, cooked in rice cooker. It was ok, needed something more.

I made this using cilantro and lime juice.  Also used water, didn't have any chicken broth.  Worked out well since I was adding it to black bean chili to extend it.

Definitely makes brown rice better!  I did on stovetop, so probably could have used more liquid.  Liquid absorbed but rice was not completely tender after 10 minutes.  Not the fault of this recipe!  Flavor was very good, will make again.

Tried with instant organic brown rice. It was pretty tasty! I did it stove top, though.
