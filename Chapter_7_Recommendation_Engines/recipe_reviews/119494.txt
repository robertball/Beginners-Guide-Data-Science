i would give it 5 stars but that's only because of the few changes that i made. i used beef broth instaid of water and doubled the spices and also added some fresh garlic. i cooked mine on low for 5-6 hrs and it was perfect, any longer and it would of burnt.  good recipe. will make again.

I altered the recipe so it's difficult to rate the recipe as it's written.  However, it's too basic to warrant a 5 star rating.  I added a cup of cabernet sauvignon, several dashes of chipotle hot pepper sauce, 1 tsp of worchestershire sauce and 1/2 tsp of thyme.  It gave the recipe a wonderful subtle kick.  The leftovers are quite tasty as well.  I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is great.  Wonderful with a good french bread.  I forgot the Tapioca and added flour and water at the end.  It was no where near thick enough before I did that.  I added leeks and a lot more basil too.

My husband wasn't sure he would like this recipe because he hates vegetables.  He ate two bowls last night and went on and on (and on) about how much he loved it!  Great Recipe, I highly recommend!!

Easy, basic, mild, and light stew.  Hubby described it as "just stew" but he rated it 5 stars.  I think that means that although nothing really stuck out, everything blended well.  Insteaed of the water I used beef broth.

I loved it! These were my changes 4 cups of water 2 cups of chicken broth. Organic beef cut up to bite size, Worcester sauce, crushed red pepper, minced garlic, and sea salt.  Towards the last few hours I added the floor (at the end for thickening, but still was a little watery) but soaked up nicely w/ bread! Cant wait to taste the left overs tomorrow... It should be way better!   The only change I will make next time is to saute the onions, and garlic, and cook the meat just a little (just to try and see if it gives it a little more flavor)

Bland.  What makes it French?  Nothing-- I made it as directed and was very disappointed.  With lamb instead of beef, and some nice wine, it could become more French.  As is, it's too boring to make again.

We enjoyed this immensely.  There are only two of us, so we had a couple days' leftovers, and they were great, too.  I didn't change a thing, and we really liked this recipe.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

Dont really know what makes it French vs regular beef stew but it was good. I followed the recipes as stated but when it was done the sauce was still very soupy so I ended up adding some flour shaken in water to it to make it more stew like. Everyone enjoyed it though.

This stew was not so great.... I even added fresh garlic, hot pepper sauce, and many other seasonings as suggested by other reviewers and it just wasn't that flavorful...It didn't taste bad, but it was pretty bland. I won't be making this again.

This is a good crockpot stew.  The only change I made was to substitute half of the water with red wine.

I really liked this recipe and it was so easy. I increased the vegetables and seasonings to accommodate my family's size and used a can of tomato soup and a can of tomato sauce since I didn't have tomato juice. Since my two year old decided to turn off the crockpot some time during the day, we ended up having this for dinner the day after we were supposed to. I just put it back on the warm setting after refrigerating it all night and it was perfect. I will be putting this into the rotation. Thanks for the recipe!

Love it! I use V8 for the tomato juice and throw in a beef bullion cube.  I cannot imagine someone calling this bland.
