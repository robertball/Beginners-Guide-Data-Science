I thought this recipe had potential, plus it's a slow cooker recipe that doesn't involve a can of cream soup!  As written, I give it 3 stars, but with my changes, I think it's a 4 star recipe.  I added a handful of fresh cilantro and 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper for some kick.  I used low-sodium chicken broth and then added salt to taste (about 3/4 tsp).  I didn't have instant rice, so I added 1 cup regular rice about 1 hour before the chicken was supposed to be done.  I then served it with fresh chopped cilantro on top.  We loved the rice, but the chicken was DRY.  I think chicken thighs would be a much better option for this recipe.  The dark meat would stay more moist.  I will make this again with my changes and using chicken thighs!

If you want to use regular rice rather than instant, put the rice in for much longer, maybe even at the start.

Easy and delicious recipe. This would also work well with pork. Had frozen, boneless, skinless chicken tenderloins on hand so that is what I used and will use again, they came out tender and moist. It needs more seasoning which I will experiment with the next time I make it. I used brown rice because we cannot have the white. Maybe that took away from the flavor. It took 3 1/2 fresh, squeezed limes to make the 1/3c needed. Will make this often. Thank you Lisa D for a great recipe.

My family really liked this recipe!  We  cut the chicken up into large chunks before cooking so that we could serve it easier! And we added fresh tomatoes, cilantro and jack cheese on top.  We served it with black beans (canned) and a green salad!  Great summer dinner!

YUM!! I only gave it four stars because I changed a bunch of stuff, but it was delicious! The things I changed were: chicken thighs, brown rice, homemade seasoned chicken stock, and fresh thyme. I added to the recipe: diced peppers and onions, and one can of diced tomatoes. The rice was really creamy and the flavor was great!

Delicious recipe! I made this using one an older model crock pot that cooks slower than the newer models but I still found 8 hours on low to be a bit too long (chicken was a bit dry).  Other than that, we thought the flavor was excellent!  I resisted the urge to kick it up a bit because I knew my kids wouldn't eat it if I did but I bet this would be good with a can of Rotel or other spices added.  It also seems like it would work well with pork.  Yummy!

This recipe was really good with a little tweaks.  I added extra garlic about 4 cloves, extra lime juice, and a can of mild rotel.  I also salted the chicken because my family likes their food with salt.  They loved it.  The kids gobbled it up and my boyfriend didn't even get any.

We liked it but it was a bit bland for us so  I did add a bit more of the spices to it and I used brown rice instead of white.  It is one we will add to our recipe book.

This was a little bland, but it's a keeper because it's so easy.  I used coriander instead of thyme, and I thought it gave it a nice sweet taste.

This was super tasty!  Next time I would not put the rice in the slow cooker though, I would cook it seperately as it was mushy, but still tasty.  Will for sure be making this one again!

This was a great weeknight dish!  It was quick to prep and with a few additions, really tasty. I followed the directions as written, but read a few other reviews and decided that it might end up too bland, so I added the following: one can diced tomatoes with chili's, dried minced onion, dried minced bell peppers, a dash of coriander, a dash of chili powder, a dash of sea salt, and about 2tbsp of dried cilantro.  I added the instant rice in for the last 15min and that worked out perfectly.  The chicken was flavorful, moist, and shredded easily into the rice.  I cooked mine on low for about 10hrs and it worked out just fine for me.

LOTS of lime flavor in this, I might actually cut down on the lime juice next time, but definately try as written first! Spice proportion is good as written. I really liked it, but next time I think I'll have it in summer with a margarita at my side!

Delicious and really easy!  I didn't use thyme and used chili powder & cumin instead, to spice things up a bit.  But this chicken was so moist and it turned out really well.

cooking time is way off...at least for my slow cooker.  5hrs on low for fresh chicken breast made them dry dry dry!  I added 1 cup regular brown rice with 2 hrs left.  The rice turned out perfect.  I did add 1/8tsp of red pepper...just enough for some flavor but nothing the kids noticed.  Overall great recipe!

Too much lime flavor for our taste, but we "tamed" it and added  can of black beans and some sour cream, and then we liked it! :)

I really liked the lime flavor, not too strong but just right.  I mixed up everything but the rice ahead of time and let the chicken marinate in it in the refrigerator overnight.  I cut up the chicken since my son prefers it that way, and 1" cubes were done in 3 hours on high.  Per another reviewer's suggestion, I used the broth to cook the rice separately instead of in the slow cooker.  I followed others' suggestion to add some cilantro.  I agree with some who suggested a little more seasoning would be helpful.  I will make this again, thanks!

I thought it was a great alternative to cream of mushroom blah blah blah..I added more lime juice and I would def. recommend if you are using brown or white non-instant rice to put in maybe 1 hour after starting. Also I think 8 hours is a bit too long if using chicken breast.  We used some jalapenos cut up and a can of diced tomatoes. It was very good.

Very easy and everyone liked it!  I made it as the recipe called for and it was good.  However, after we started eating we added some green onions.  Steamed broccoli would have been good in it also.

I used thigh filets, and had brown rice on the side.  I might add chilis next time.  Leftovers were great to make into quesadillas.

I thought this was ok. I did think it was missing something but it was a crazy night and I didn't have time to play with it. But I think some cilantro would be a great addition in here. My husband thought it had to much of a lime flavor to it. Also I used regular rice and put it in the crock pot an hour before it was finished. 45 minutes would have been better.

This recipe was very easy to prepare but did not take as long to cook as the directions called for. I'd say it was ready to eat in under five hours. I will also add a little less lime juice in the future. But overall, a fine and quick meal!

I thought this was very good.  I increased the garlic, lime juice (slightly), and added tarragon and rosemary. I was short on time, so I cut the chicken and browned it, and cooked it in the crock pot on high for about 4 hours.  I'd like to try it with less rice.

We so enjoyed this dish thank you for sharing it. I never use instant rice but wanted to follow your recipe so tried Uncle Ben's and it was as good as regular rice in this recipe. We will be making this often!

Make sure you follow the recipe exactly, unless you are making changes on purpose.  I missed one word - "instant" - in the last line, and had to cook the rice for quite a bit longer.  That's my mistake.  Otherwise, the recipe came out great, and didn't take much time to prepare.  Slow cooker recipes take some getting used to, since you will probably be preparing dinner before having your breakfast.  But, at the end of the day, IF you have followed the directions, you can relax, keep watching TV, and just let everyone know that dinner will be ready in 15 minutes.

I used lemon juice from the bottle cuz I didnt have lime..  I also added a bay leaf, more seasoning like rosemary and garlic spice from tones that I have and steak seasoning.  cooked on high for 2 1/2hrs.. I pound my breast out so they're about the thickness of a deck of cards.  used 2 breast.  I took the chicken out, cut it up about45min til end. put brown rice in then some frozen peas n carrots and some canned pinto beans, then put chicken back in.  didn't stir it for bout 1/2hr.  cooked it until the veggies and rice were cooked.  will buy some lime juice for next time!  yummy

I won't be making this again. The chicken came out dry and bland. I had even added extra garlic, and some lemon pepper to add more flavor, so I can't even imagine how much more bland it would've been without them. The rice was mushy, too. I'm disappointed, because it smelled really good! Thankfully, my hubby offered to bring home dinner.

loved this recipe!! I wanted to spice this up a little, so I used coriander instead of thyme, added some cayenne pepper, a can of rotel and instead of instant rice I used brown rice and put it in 2 hours before serving (cooking it on my slow cookers highest setting). Also since I'm serving less I only put in 2 chicken breasts (partially frozen) but left all the liquids the same. When it was all done I was able to pull the chicken into shreds and mix it in with the chicken. My husband absolutely loved it!

My husband and I enjoyed this dish, but I made changes because of reviews and my cooking intuition. I made the following changes: 1) 2 cups of water and three chicken bullion. 2)  kept the butter, thyme, pepper, and lime juice the same. 3) 4 frozen boneless skinless chicken breast (I think I will make these into 1 inch cubes before placing in the crock pot next time) 4) added half a chopped onion, half a chopped green pepper, three sliced jalapeños with seeds, 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro, and 3 large garlic cloves. 5) I added cumin, chili powder, and red pepper flakes (maybe 1/2 tsp each?) 6) added one cup of brown rice with 2 hours left (It was mushy but we liked it that way. I would say an hour before if you don't want it over cooked.) 7) also would add fresh cilantro at the end next time.

This is so simple that it is definitely a keeper. Not to mention not a fattening cream soup slow cooker dish. I squeezed my own limes and add 4 fresh sliced cloves of garlic. Be sure to add the butter to temper the tartness of the lime. Will make again and add chili powder next time to be lime chili.

Love this!  Only thing I didn't do is add rice.  We don't like soggy rice so I just cooked the rice separately in a rice cooker.  I also rub the chicken with a little bit of garlic salt before putting it in a slow cooker.  My In-Laws loved it!....especially my husband!

I'm sorry but I have to agree with those that said this dish was bland and dry.  I even added an onion, as someone suggested.  I usually use these recipes as a guide and then add my own extras.  But in this case, it was something I never made before, so I obeyed the recipe.  But thanks anyway:)

Tried this because I had most things on hand.  Had to use oregano because that is all I had. Added an onion because of the reviews about being bland.  I do not understand how people had dry chicken?! I could have doubled the chicken and still had plenty of broth the keep it juicy.  Came out tender and falling apart - delish!  Didn't have instant rice so did that stove top. Yes, a bit bland but so easy and most things are staples so will make again.  Good base recipe to customize. Maybe with some carrots and potatoes?

LOVED this recipe!!  I took a reviewers advice and added some fresh cilantro and some crushed red pepper and used regular (Jasmine) rice.  Used thighs and a few white meat tenders.   Cooked it in the pressure cooker for 10 minutes on hi and let it depressurize for 20 minutes. Served with fresh cilantro and lime....but you really don't need it.  SO amazing!  I will reduce the liquid by about 1/2 cup next time.

Tasty and easy, but better with more lime juice and garlic, and use long grain rice instead of that instant stuff.  I also prefer boneless skinless chicken thighs as chicken breasts always (at least for me) get too dry in the slow cooker.

Tried this tonight....was so very bland!  I added additional thyme, s/p, can of crushed basil tomatoes, a can of rotel.  The rice took longer than expected.  Don't think I will try this one again.  Really ended up being my own recipe.

This dish had way too much lime in it. The only thing the chicken tasted like was lime. I suggest if you make this dish that you use less lime then what the recipe calls for. But keep the rice how it is, that was really good.

Added a can of Rotel with lime and cilantro, otherwise followed recipe.  Very salty - next time will drain the tomatoes.  I also added jerk seasoning since I heard from many this was bland.  Rice cooked on the side, not in the cooker.  this was SO EASY, so that is why I gave this a 4 star.   Will make again and will continue to modify.

It smelled delicious but when I tasted it, there was NO flavour. And the rice was too soft and mushy. However, I will try it again but with the rice as a side dish and add more seasoning.

I loved this one. The chicken was still very moist and full of flavor,  and so was the rice. Definitely a dish for those who love lime. Surprisingly light and springy for a slow cooker meal.

Recipe was very easy to follow. The chicken came out tender but didnt have a lot of flavor in my opinion. I added some onions, lime juice & cilantro the the rice & on top of the chicken to try & add some flavor. Good but to plain for my taste

Love this recipe, pretty much as-is, other than tripling the garlic ;)
My daughter adds a large squirt of sriracha.  I make it at least once a month.  I like using frozen chicken, seems to not dry out.

This dish is very flavorful! The chicken pulled apart and was very juicy. I felt it was lacking something. I might add a veggie or something crunchy or crispy. I also suggest making the rice seperately.  The slow cooker cooks it too much and made it mushy. I will make this again.

I am giving 5 stars. Me and my family thought this was delicious. I used 4 limes and some pepper flakes. Cooked on high for 4 hours. Came out great.

Kind of Bland. It just tasted like limes. The chicken was tender, but I felt it needed something more.

I really liked this recipe. It did not have an over powering taste but was a nice warm meal after a long day! When I make it again I may add some vegetables in the end too.

I'm sorry but the recipe as written is very bland.  My teenage son that eats everything put the bowl down after a few bites and I ended up cooking a second dinner. With much tweaking this could be a 4 star.

A person would definatly need to add some flavoring to this dish, it was way to bland. The chicken turned out a little dry as well.

Although I did add garlic and onion powder and salt, this was wonderful. I had a ton of leftover cooked bowtie noodles and threw those in for a bit just to warm them up. I too used frozen chicken breasts. I was lucky to get some for myself!

I gave it 5 stars after adding to the recipe.  Instead of instant rice, I used Rice a Roni Wild Rice Cheese & Broccoli and added it 1/2 hour before.  I also added a little extra lime juice (bottled) because I love lime and lemon.  Also added some nuked Green Giant Broccoli. Think this could be changed up with Spanish Rice, etc.

The chicken was lacking in flavor even though I threw in so other spices to liven it up. The instant rice however did soak up all that flavor. I've never used instant rice before and it did cook in about 20 minutes absorbing all of the liquid. After we sat down to eat we all agreed the chicken need some sort of a gravy so I quickly heated a can of cream of mushroom soup with a smidge of garlic, minced onion and a few splashed of half and half and nuked it for 2 minuted then spooned it over our chicken. This made it so much better and probably a 4 star in my book.

Yummy, with a few changes. Added cilantro, a little crushed red pepper, garlic salt, and was very generous with the amount of lime juice. Cooked on low for 4 hours 30 minutes then added 2 1/2 cups instant rice, 30 minutes later - Yum! Topped the final dish with Monterey Jack cheese and more cilantro. (The rice reminded me of Chipotle’s white rice). My pup was watching every move hoping I’d drop him a morsel. Ha

I have made this routinely for over a year, we really enjoy it.  Changes I have made over time include: use boneless chicken thighs, double the garlic, add a chopped sweet onion, add 1/2 c. cilantro shortly before serving, per another reviewer.  I often use my own veggie stock, in that case I add a teaspoon of salt.  I make this with brown rice, which I add after my chicken is falling apart, approximately 2 hours before serving. The onion caramelizes on the rice and the flavors are delicious.

It is totally delicious. Not your everyday chicken and rice. It has a unique blend of flavors. My family got seconds and had to force themselves not to go back for thirds.  They have already asked me to make it again soon. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Added cilantro at the end. 3 out of the 4 of us liked it. I used frozen chicken breasts, which shrunk like crazy and then broke apart when I stirred in the rice. So, it looked nothing like the picture but was still good.

Only one change because I did not have the orange juice concentrate and  used the O.J. from the bottle.  This recipe was 
a winner. My family loved the taste .  It is easy and simple to make and then leave in a croc pot till done .   I will make this again.

I think I may have used too much lime juice.  I rubbed the bird down with some of it to help my seasoning stick.  I, too, added fresh cilantro and used regular rice, which I added at the start as another person suggested.  Very awesome.  I also used a little fresh jalapeño pepper for some kick.  All in all, it's been added to my regular rotation it was so good!

This was good, however the lime was mostly absorbed by the rice and cooking it on low for eight hours was too long; the chicken was dried out.  Flavor is lacking somewhat in this recipe and seems like something is missing.  Would potentially make this again, but add flavor, such as a cream of mushroom soup and even possibly add onions and/or fresh mushrooms to this.

The only change I made to the recipe was I used regular long-grained white rice, and added another 2 cups of hot chicken broth when adding the rice, since the water-to-rice ratio is 2 to-1.  This was done during the last 1 1/2 hrs of cooking time to allow the rice to bloom and cook.  Also, this would be great to try with thigh meat, or pork tenderloin or boneless chops.
I also added 3 Tbsp of freshly chopped cilantro, as well as 2 tsp of lemon pepper to boost the citrus flavor.
Great recipe!  I'll do this one again!

Great flavor.  Super easy to make.  I used black rice.  It tasted great with black rice but the black rice released its color and made the entire dish look like black beans-- not as pretty as what you probably get with white or brown rice.

After reading all the comments I made the following changes when I made this the first time:  instead of chicken broth I used chicken stock (store-bought), I cut up the chicken into cubes instead of using whole chicken parts, 2 tsp of store-bought minced garlic (equivalent to 4 cloves garlic), 1/4 tsp dried thyme, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/8 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp ground black pepper, 1/4 tsp sea salt, and 1/3 cup chopped onion.  Towards the end I added 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken it up.  Served it with brown rice in a bowl.  Used a bowl because it was still soupy.  I thought it was fair but my husband and son really liked it a lot and want it again in the future.  With the changes it definitely had some kick to it.  We live in Louisiana and eat food more seasoned and spicy than in other parts.  It came out medium spicy.

I think this is a great starting off recipe there's a few things I changed first of all I brown the chicken in the pan before I added it to the crock pot.  since we are moving we don't have a lot of extra stuff and I substituted cilantro.. 

 I also added broccoli you can never sneak in  too many vegetables !!

 I followed the directions if I were to make it again I would change it by sautéing onions and adding them and then maybe garnishing it with avocado or maybe an avocado sauce because the dishes a little bland for my tasting !

Very bland as is, and really not amazing enough to tweak. This one won't be in my rotation!

Total disaster and the end result wasn't salvageable.  It was all great going up until adding the rice. The chicken smelled awesome, looked moist and had I cooked the rice on the side I would have been in for a real treat. Once I added the rice, dinner turned into a mushy, unappealing, bland mess and the rice never really cooked even after being in there a REALLY long time and then   Needless to say I was not able to serve it. Looks alone it was unappealing.

This recipe was really easy to put together, but there was a flavor neither I nor my husband was all that thrilled about. I think for us there was too MUCH lime juice. I also tried to add regular brown rice from the beginning of the cook time. It came out too mushy, but I'm not holding that against this recipe as that was my mistake. I didn't have instant rice so I tried it to see if it would work. It was the flavor that was the problem.

REally great.  Made it today and it was fantastic.  I did add more garlic and salt for flavor, pre cooked rice at the end, then topped it with fresh cilantro.  The chicken came out moist and flavorful at 4 hours low heat crock pot.

added a lemon, quartered. it was a bit on the bitter side, but possibly due to the lemon. simple though, and the chicken felt apart after cooking for 8 hours.

This chicken was so moist, it broke apart before I could even get it on the plate.  I followed the recipe, but added more garlic and some fajita seasoning (just in the shaker) to add more flavor, it turned out awesome!

This recipe was very bland and lacked the punch of flavor I thought the lime would bring.  I even added fresh cilantro and extra garlic.  I will not be making this again.

Very, very bland.  I even added garlic, poultry seasoning, salt and pepper and a bay leaf.  Still so bland that I just can't eat it.  Too bad.  Not sure of the point of the lime juice, I couldn't taste it at all.

It smelled great but it wasn't as flavorful as I had anticipated.  I accidentally over cooked the chicken so that definitely could have ruined the flavor.  However I won't make a second attempt at this recipe.

I was very excited about this recipe because I am a huge lime fan! But I, like many others, found the chicken to be very dry. The rice really soaks in the lime flavoring and it does seem a bit too strong, though I did double the amount of lime juice. As someone else suggested, maybe throw in a can of Rotel- that might help.   I won't make this again.

I made a vegetarian version of this using vegetable broth, vegetarian "chickn" strips, and a wild rice blend.  I adjusted to give the wild rice enough time to cook.  Otherwise, I was true to the recipe.  This was delicious, and I will be making this again!

Very easy to make but lacking in flavor. It also turned out very dry. I probably won't make it again.

Chicken is cooked perfectly.  I liked the flavor of the dish, but may add a sauce of some sort to kick it up a little bit.  Very good!

This gets 3 stars for how easy it is to prepare, but I thought the taste a bit bland, and I could barely taste the lime juice. I added corn to the mix, but other than that followed the recipe. Next time I'll have to mix it up with spices.
