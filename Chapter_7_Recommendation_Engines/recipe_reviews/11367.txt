This recipe wasn't all that I thought it was going to be but it wasn't the worst.  I found them to be rather dry and rather tasteless, definitely needs the frosting.  I probably will not be making this recipe again.

This recipe was great and to give it a festive christmas touch I sprinkled red and green candies on top of the frosting right after spreading.

My maternal grandmother made these every Christmas.  To me it is not Christmas without these tasty cookies.
