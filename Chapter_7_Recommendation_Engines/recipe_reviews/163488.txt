We actually cooked the marinated snapper on the grill tonight so didn't mess with the flour etc.  The only thing that we added to the sauce was some garlic.  Turned out very very good.  Thanks for the post.

I took a few liberties with this.  I used salmon because it's the only fish I had on hand. I cubed and pan saut√©ed, skipped the flour. When I pulled out ingredients for my dinner I noticed I was short of fish sauce.  Since both my intended recipes used it I had to portion what I had left. I used about a tablespoon for this.  After simmering sauce I dumped it in the blender and used half and half instead of cream.  This was just fantastic!  Every bite was a symphony on the tongue, each element is available and noticeable yet blends together to a fantastic result. This recipe would be well suited to anyone that doesn't really care for the taste of fish as the other flavors really explode and hide any fish flavor.

EXCELLENT! I left out the shallots because I forgot to buy them and used brown flour. Really is restaurant quality.

Other than omitting the flour, I made this exactly as written, which is quite unusual for me. I fried the fish on the burner beside my barbeque to avoid the house smelling like fish for days.  It was very flavorful and my husband said it had a gourmet feel.  I'm going to try the sauce on noodles with roast chicken this weekend.   Thanks for the recipe.

It was too citrusy... followed measurements for 2 servings correctly but perhaps the lemon juice, lime juice, and grated orange peels should be halved.

I use any type of white fleshed fish. Also leave out the fennel, just a personal choice as we don't care for fennel.

I think it was the fish sauce that ruined it for me.

I have gotten alot of recipes off this site and all have been excellent but I did not care for this recipe at all. The fish sauce was overpowering and it has too much citrus flavor. It was a total waste of good fish. Unedible !!

This sauce was excellent with very strong flavor. I used salmon (because it was on sale) and rice instead of linguine.  Also, I omitted fennel seeds and thyme because I didn't have them.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and I was very pleased.
