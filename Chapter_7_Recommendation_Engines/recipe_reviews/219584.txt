This was very easy and my very picky boys ate it all up!  I didn't use the toast ( we're gluten free) and used the sauce we had in the cupboard, Classico- tomato and garlic.

So simple and delicious! My three-year-old loved it so much that he wouldn't talk at all during dinner, he just kept shoving food in. LOL. I used Rinaldi Three cheese because it's what I had on hand. Also, my husband asked me to throw in some spaghetti so we had that with the garlic bread (our garlic bread was Peppridge Farm's Farmhouse White - I slathered on butter, sprinkled on garlic powder and then threw in the toaster oven).

Super easy and quick! The chicken came out just a little dry, but there was plenty cheese and sauce. It tasted great.

I didn't care for this recipe.  The chicken came out tough and the sauce was all watery and ran all over the plate.

Solid recipe. Points for being super easy, and lighter than a breaded and friend chicken parm. I do think the chicken came out a little tough. Next time I will try pounding it thin first to see if that makes any difference.

Kudos for simplicity. I used thicker breasts and cooked for 45 min. Chicken tasted great, but the sauce could have been thicker. The wife and the 5year old gave the approval to make it again.

This was an easy recipe to make--especially since we wanted to make something quick just in case we lost power because of Sandy.  I added a few of my own spices because we take everything a little spicier than most and it turned out really tasty and good.

I've made this 2x. The first time I forgot to add Parmesan cheese to the sauce before I added the chicken. I ended up coating each breast with Parmesan cheese and garlic powder and it turned out better this way then the second time I made it according to the recipe.

Very good.  You can use any sauce you want, though.  I used hunts.  And only because we're mushroom fanatics, I added sauteed baby portabello mushrooms.  Even without, I would make this again.  My grown daughters words "This is really good, mom."

This was great!!! Others have said the chicken was dry.... Mine was very moist and great! Only thing I changed was I used 1/2 Prego 3 cheese and 1/2 Prego tomato, onion and garlic. Served with Texas toast and asparagus. Didn't get a chance to take a picture... Was eaten to fast. Will post picture next time!!! A KEEPER!

My husband really liked this dish. Quick, easy, fast, serviced it with a side of penna pasta. I had big chicken breast,cut in half and baked at 350 for 20 minutes then kicked heat up to 375, after cheese was added cooked for additional 10 minutes. Great dish.

I tried a few Chicken Parm recipes recently. This one is the winner so far. Quick, easy, healthy... my kids and the neighbor kids loved it! The garlic toast on the side, or placed under the chicken when serving was a hit with the kids. Will be making this recipe from now on.

It is good, but very rich.  The next time I will try it with a little less cheese
