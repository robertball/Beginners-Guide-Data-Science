I think next time I make this, I will try it before adding the coconut milk. I don't know if coconut milk is supposed to be slightly lumpy, but it changed the appearance of the soup which put me off. It tasted good though. I used just a little ginger like someone else said and a splash of lemon juice.

Very smooth and creamy.  I used slightly less ginger root because I've used too much ginger before.  Love the coconut milk.  This is a make again.
