I don't like chicken salad sandwiches but my fiance was hungry for it, so I gave this recipe a try (being the good little woman I am). This was very, very good and very addicting. I put my chicken salad on croissonts. Delicious.

at 8 months pregnant, i was craving chicken salad... unfortunately, i found this recipe to be on the salty side.  i wish i'd added 1/4 teaspoon of salt at a time to better determine how much was necessary.  i tried adding additional pickle relish, but really couldn't save it.  if you can get past the saltiness, the crunch of the almonds and celery is really good.

Yummy! I did change it alittle. I did not add the olives. Everything else is good, but the green peppers overpower the recipes. Next time will use less. I did put it on english muffins, but added a slice of white american cheese on top then broiled it for a few minutes.

This is a good, basic chicken salad. I was hoping the olives would add a Mediterranean taste, but I couldn't really find them too much. The relish and mustard were good additions and may have overpowered the olives. I'll probably make this again.

Yum! I made these for a camping trip. I just threw all the ingredients (minus the muffin, lettuce and tomato) into a ziplock and placed in the fridge until we were going to eat it!  Very, very good!

Didn't use the olives.

these were really good!! Made just the smallest changes. Used a red bell pepper instead of green, nixed the olives, and only added salt and pepper to taste. We used ciabatta and croissants for the bread, but I'm sure the english muffins would be great as well. Whatever bread you prefer would work. Only other difference was using Miracle whip instead of mayo because someone used all the mayo and didn't tell me. =)  I used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken and just pulled/shredded the meat from it. Much easier than cooking and cubing for me. thanks for sharing, I'll make this again!

Excellent!!! I was at first skeptical because the ingredients seem unusual, but they work very well together.  I did substitute red pepper for the green pepper.  Very good, you should definetely try it.

Great flavor!  I made a few adjustments based on what I had in the fridge- I used dill relish instead of sweet, no green pepper, olives, or almonds.  Celery and onion gave it enough crunch. It was very good and I'm looking forward to eatting the leftovers tomorrow.

This recipe was great!  I was really skeptical, but I wanted to try something new.  I used baked chicken left over from another meal, cut into small cubes.  Instead of mayo, I used Miracle Whip (it was all I had in the fridge).  And I did not have any nuts, so we didn't add those either.  But it was still amazing!  My two little picky eaters (21 mos and 18 mos) devoured it!  Thanks!

This turned out very good - I will definately make again!  I served on toasted hard rolls which used more filling.  I would probably double if serving more than 4 people.

I was skeptical to try this recipe because the combination of ingredients seemed odd to me; but, this is chicken salad kicked up a few notches! It was a virtual party in my mouth. I couldn't stop eating it (forget the bread, just give me a fork!). I love the nutty flavor from the toasted almonds, the saltiness from the olives and the crunch from the celery.  All the flavors blended very well together. I decreased the salt to 1/2 t. due to the saltiness of the olives.

Very good!!  I loved it!  I had never made chicken salad before and it was a hit!  The only thing I did different was omit the almonds and olives and chopped up a sweet pickle and added some of the juice instead of the relish.  Definitely on my "make again" list.  :)

Oh yum! I made this almost exactly as written. Had to use red pepper instead of green but that's the only change. LOVE olives so they had to go in! So good! Will make this again and again!

Outstanding recipe, I LOVE it!  My husband is not a chicken salad lover at all, and he thought it was out of this world.  I omitted the olives, green pepper, salt & pepper, and added about 1 1/2 Tablespoons of honey...and oh MAMA, that put it over the top!

Very delicious!  I made this and was hesitant because it had ingredients I had never used in chicken salad.  I omitted the nuts & served on Italian bread but followed it otherwise.  Very yummy.

Very good! One tip though: use a good mayo, and you won't need that extra salt. I used a dash of salt on the chicken as I cooked it, then Blue Plate Mayonnaise, and the salt level was perfect!

So delicious! I skipped the olives (even though I had them in my fridge) because I thought they wouldn't be good with the sweet pickles. It turned out great. I only used half the mayo to save on calories and it worked out perfect! It will be a new staple since all I have been cooking whole chickens and making two different meals out of them...

I made this with only the chicken, celery, olives, mayo and mustard, but it still turned out fantastic! Added a slice of cheese for a simple sandwich.

We love this. The only change I made was to sub chiopped Jalapeno in place of the bell pepper out of personal preference - we like spicy, and the mayo, I used the reduced fat mayo from Olive Oil, and left out the olives b/c DH isn't a fan of them. This was wonderful. I will definately keep this recipe for future use!

I made this recipe for my VERY picky family and they LOVED it!!! I agree with other reviewers that it has an odd assortment of ingredients but it works!  I followed the recipe pretty much. I used a store-bought rotisserie chicken and a red sweet pepper instead of green.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Good as is, but to many competing flavors.I omit the olives , add very little salt,and use a sweet red pepper for a more subtle taste.Also the red pepper adds a nice color to the finished salad.
I have made this salad a few times, and added curry powder and soy sauce once....delicious!

I've made this twice now, both times with different variations of what I had on hand. This does make a lot though! I made mine on toasted bread instead though because I didn't have the muffins.

This chicken salad was delicious.  Even my husband who doesn't typically like chicken salad raved about it.  I made it exactly as written except I used leftover grilled chicken breasts cut up and instead of putting on muffins, I lined the inside of pita bread with tomato slices and stuffed with the salad.  Perfect for a picnic!  You rock Judy!

I made this recipe for my mother in law's 94th birthday party luncheon. What a hit! Everyone commented on the flavours and textures. It became a guessing game as to what the "secret" ingredient was that gave it that extra something special. Everyone was asking for copies of the recipe! A definite keeper and now a family favorite!

This was different. I think it called for too much mustard and it ended up very crumbly.  Maybe if the chicken was shredded rather than chopped it would've stayed in the sandwich but I doubt I'll try it again.

Love, love, LOVE this recipe! I was a little wary, I have to admit, about using pimento olives because my family is definitely not a fan, but it added a really nice kick to the flavor. This has definitely become a family favorite. I recommend the recipe as is!!

This is a great recipe for a sandwich or on lettuce for a salad.  I used red pepper as I did not have a green one.  I used a couple of green onions instead of a regular onion and dijon mustard.  Instead of tomato and lettuce I used a slice of swiss cheese. But~~ it did not change the overall taste of the recipe.

Loved it! Used 1/2 the amt of salt and no olives (didn't have any). I also used canned chicken. I want to try adding olives next time! Served on whole wheat bread and shredded lettuce. I will definitely keep this in my recipe box. Thanks for sharing with us Judy!

Loved this recipe! I changed a few things tho..I didnt add celery, pimentos or green peppers(because I didnt have them on hand) and would use less or no salt next time..I also didnt use tomato or lettuce and put it on one of those new Orowheat sandwich thins (100 calories) and it was GREAT!

I made this for a baby shower and they were a big hit.  I didn't add any extra salt and I only added about half the pepper and it was great.  I think that a lot of the ingredients could have been omitted like the almonds and it would have been just fine.

I am NOT a chicken salad fan, but was looking for something quick to make with chicken I had on hand.  This came out so good and for me to actually really like it was surprising.  Next time I think I'd keep the onion to a minimum though.  It was a bit overpowering, but that may have just been the onion I used. I also took a previous person's suggestion and added the honey BBQ sauce.  Although I liked it, I actually think it may have been even better without it.  I think it would depend on your mood, whether you want it with a twist or not.  Glad I have this recipe now.

this is GOOD!!!  i make it weekly just about!

like another reviewer i also just use toasted bread, not muffins.  

the recipe does make a lot.  

because i don't want a LOT of crunchy in my chicken salad, i omit celery, green pepper, and onion.  and i use extra olives, b/c that is the best part, second to the almonds!  i also do not even use lettuce and tomatoes.  just the chicken salad and the bread.

thanks for an AWESOME recipe!

Very yummy.  I made as is, but added a secret ingredient.  A couple tablespoons of honey bbq sauce.  I discovered this when using left over bbq chicken which left a hint of bbq sauce in the salad.  It makes a great recipe even better.  I challenge you to include some bbq sauce! (I used Jack Daniels honey bbq sauace)

I liked this recipe, but i did alter a bit.  I made the serving about half of the recipe, and added about 2 slices of swiss cheese cut and diced, and also a few dashes of Paprika.  Mayo, to my taste.  It was great on toasted Bread!!!

Do not add salt if chicken is already salted. Was a little dry, so added  some honey. Had a lot of flavor. Served on rolls.

Delish. Was craving a chicken salad sandwich and wanted to try to make my first after visiting mr pickles (local sandwich spot). I don't like olives so didn't add them. For the most followed the recipe. Added a tad more mustard and a dash of paprika. Didnt need to add any salt. Dash of cayenne for a little kick. I impressed myself.

I was searching for a different chicken salad recipe and thought I would give this one a try! I made two changes - substituted green onions for green peppers due to personal taste and added more mayonaise because it was just a little too thick for us. Needless to say it was so yummilicious that hubby and I are "fighting" over who gets to take the rest of it for lunch today! Thank you for an excellent recipe!

The best chicken salad recipe.  Didn't think so looking at ingredients, but it's a must try.  I sauted the chicken w/ onions in butter and chicken stock and substituted dill for sweet relish. We served them on croissant rolls (changed the calories) .  Very good!

Great inspiration!  I tossed about a shallot's worth of yellow onion and equal amt of red bell pepper into a mini cuisinart, then chopped some kalamata olives the same way.  Mixed with diced/minced chicken from rotisserie leftovers.  Added healthy amt of mayonnaise, a few dashes of Old Bay seasoning, celery seed (had no celery), and red pepper to spice it up a bit.  Wife and I loved it!   Thanks again!

The ingredients of this recipe sounded very good and I thought it would taste different.  To me it tastes the same as most, or all, of chicken salad.  I'd like to thank you for making this recipe available.

Nope, not for me.  I am reviewing based on the exact recipe (drives me crazy when people change it and then review).  Too much stuff in it for me.  It had a very strong green olive taste and the almonds were annoying.  I think next time I want chicken salad I'll just use my tuna salad recipe.

This was a hit at my party. I didn't use the almonds and will probably try them them the next time I make this. I will also decrease the amount of relish the next time to make it a little less sweet, but it was great!
