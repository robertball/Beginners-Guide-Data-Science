NOTE FROM RECIPE MAKER: When submitted, my instructions said to "boil till fork tender". Allrecipes added to that sentence "about 20 minutes". Now that I have see two reviews stating the fries/wedges are too "mushy" I am thinking cooks are boiling for 20 minutes and not until fork tender. If you boil till fork tender, the "mushy" quality should hopefully not be an issue. Remember, recipes are a guideline to discovering what you like best. So learn, practice, experiment, and don't be afraid to mess. Happy Cooking!

Fabulous flavor, though making sure they're only fork-tender is important! I used 1 tbsp table salt instead of kosher, and will decrease it to 2 tsp table salt next time.

followed directions exactly - make sure you use sea salt it really puts it over the edge. Big hit at our picnic. Shame on the reviewer who gave 1 star for something the submitter can't control.

I made these twice. As directed the first time and didn't care for the texture. Second time I cubed the potato, tossed them in the oil and seasonings, and oven roasted them. We normally like just plain sweet potatoes but this seasoning blend is a really nice contrast. I did not use the cilantro the second time and we likes the flavor both ways.

Yum! Only change I made was to microwave the potato wedges in a bowl with a tiny bit of water for a couple minutes instead of boiling them. Very good. Thanks! :)

Wow, absolutley delicious! I mixed all of the spices except for the lime zest and cilantro in a big ziplock with the EVOO and tossed the potatoes in it before baking, then coated them with the zest and Cilantro after taking them out of the oven.  I can't wait to try these in the summer time on the grill! Thanks for the recipe, this is going to be put into regular rotation!

Great....never made sweet potato fries before...my only change was to use smoked paprika instead of regular and I omitted the cilantro since I had none on hand. Delicious, spicy, smokey and sweet all at the same time....will make again!

The recipe reminds me - I put salt in my blender and grind it small.  Makes for a nice coating with less salt.  If you grind salt in a blender don't smell the fog of powder that hovers at the top of the blander - you don't want it in your lungs.  Good on pop corn too if you buy your own kernels and pop them in the microwave.

I did not have cilantro.  Other then not adding this ingredient I followed the recipe as written.  The sweet potato's were not boiled long enough (should have cooked longer) Baked for 20 min. as stated and they were still not fully cooked and started to have a burnt look, turned them several times!! The seasoning mixture has a  unique flavor especially with the grated lime.  Too much salt though! I might try this again and boil the potato's until fork tender and cut back on some of the ingredients.  Will not give up!  This recipe sounds good and I love sweet potato fries.

This was really good.  Instead of boiling the potatoes, I put them in the microwave until fork tender (about 10 minutes) Then I let them cool and sliced them in wedges and baked.  Another family favorite.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good! I would have given 5 stars except the original recipe has far too much salt (and I *love* salt). I halved the salt and added 1/8 tsp granulated garlic and 1/16 tsp black pepper to the seasoning blend. I didn't bother pre-boiling, just cut the potatoes in smaller wedges (I've also done slices and both work well), and I didn't salt/pepper them before I added the oil and seasoning blend. The (altered, less salty) blend is very tasty and smells beautiful. I saw a few reviews saying these were bland or that there wasn't enough seasoning...all I can say is that they must positively *load* their seasonings on! I use lots of seasonings and almost always have to add extra to any recipe I make, and this recipe made *twice as much seasoning blend as I needed.* I had to make an extra batch of potatoes to use it all up (which wasn't a huge issue, since they are so tasty). At the full salt level with the original number of potatoes, the saltiness would be extreme and I can't imagine how anyone could find it bland. It just goes to show how subjective cooking can be.

These are really good.  It's a lot less work if you cut up the potatoes, toss them with all the seasonings, and roast them in the oven.  I cut mine into bite-sized pieces and baked them uncovered at 450 F for about 15 minutes.  They were perfect, moist and flavorful.  Use Japanese sweet potatoes, which have a milder flavor on their own, if you really want the seasoning to shine.  These are very good the next day (I could taste the lime more than on the potatoes fresh out of the oven), and also good served cold.

I must have boiled my sweet potatoes for too long because they never crisped.  I really do like the seasoning and will try again with a different hand on the baking/boiling part.

These had a really good, unique flavor.  The majority of my family really liked them, with the exception being the kids who just don't really care for sweet potatoes in general.  If there were a 4 1/2 option I would pick it.  My only complaint is that they were mushy as other reviews have stated and I didn't boil them ahead of time after reading them.

While it's a little tricky to get the texture just right, I am in love with this seasoning blend.  I tried to double the recipe the first time, which I think is what made the oven too steamy to get the crisp brown texture.  Second time I gave them their space and baked on a darker cookie sheet - SO yummy!  Also try putting your tray nearer the heating element if you're having trouble getting them brown and crispy.

Delicious seasoning! the lime zest was so good. Cooking them took twice as long, however i have a gas stove so it generally takes a bit longer anyways. I chopped up the sweet potato (in the recipe it doesn't say how big the potatos to be used are) so that it would saturate more evenly, and next time i'm going to do it for less time and use smaller potatos. I dipped these in miso gravy and they were SO GOOD. i'm going to make them again tomorrow and use smaller potato's, and cut the fries smaller, and bake for longer. yum yum!

After reading the reviews, I give this recipe five stars for two reasons.  The first reason is because I love sweet potatoes and they are more healthier than potatoes.  The second reason is because after I baked them, they were very tasty and healthy!!  I even don't feel guilty! I skipped the step---boiling the potatoes.  I didn't have lime and cilantro on hand.  I used the lemon with the juice to squeeze over the potatoes.  My  husband and I enjoyed them with the hot dogs.  My 9 years old son said it was okay as he rather have regular fries.   Very yummy!!  Two Big Thumbs!!

I thought these were really good.  Probably my new favorite seasoning for sweet potato fries.  I didn't boil mine first.  I cut them a little thinner and I cooked them for 30 min until crispy.  I served them with the Spicy Chipotle Burgers from this website.  I will make these again for sure!!!

My sweet potatos were rather large, so I cut them into chunks rather than wedges.  They were wonderful.  My husband said he'd be happy if we had these more often.  Our friend turned to her boyfriend and said she'd be happy if he learned to make them so they could have them. They really are great!

Way too salty. I doubled the recepie and now I am thinking if I make it again I probably should not have doubled the salt. I also would not call it "tropical". It didn't taste tropical. The ingredients are not really tropical flavors, they are more spicy southwestern flavors: cilantro, chili pepper, paprika, etc. Also my potatoes were too soft too so carefully watch to make sure potatoes are not too soft when you remove them from stove.

Did not care for this too much. It was my first time trying sweet potato fries and I was very disappointed. For some reason I didn't like the tropical flavor paired with the sweet potatoes. I will not be making these again.

Seasoning was great! Boiling the sweet potatoes before baking them made them too mushy and they never crisped up. Next time I will just slice them and bake them without boiling them first.

These were soooo good! The "fork tender" clarification was helpful.  Don't over-boil-that's key. I added a little granulated garlic and instead of sprinkling the spices, I put them in a bowl and tossed the "fries" in the bowl for better coverage.  We all loved them and I will make them again!

I thought the flavor was great, but my fries were a bit mushy.  I was careful not to over cook them before going into the oven.  Next time I may cook at a higher temperature to try to crisp them up.  I will also bump up the seasoning because I like really pronounced bold flavors. Thanks for sharing your tasty recipe!!

I have always made my Sweet Potato Fries this way but the seasonings you posted were an excellent change! I almost ate the batch all to myself!

This is a great recipe!  I left out the red pepper flakes because 2 of the 3 kids are wimps.  Most would know to cook until fork tender when baking them again.  Messy Cook hit a home run with this recipe.  We dipped them in sour cream with a little garlic & Tabasco added. YUM!

I'm afraid that we weren't crazy about these.  I think that the boiling time was too long as they were kind of mushy after being baked.  Also, the seasoning was too strong.  Too much lime and salt taste.  Sorry.  We won't be making these again.

These are very tasy but were a bit on the soggy side. Maybe cutting back on the boiling time or microwaving instead of boiling would help. They flavor was wonderful - they just weren't really "fries" to me. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Tried this the way written first.  Takes too long, boiling makes them mushy, reduces nutrient content, and seems an unnecessary step.  Second time cut potatoes into wedges, rolled them in the seasoning mixture (without cilantro), and roasted for about 35 minutes (turning once).  Perfect!  Added cilantro when serving and there were no leftovers.

Made this last night for a side dish for supper...It was awesome!! I've made sweet potato fries before, but this seasoning blend you add afterwards, made all the difference! My husband ate 3/4ths of the pan and he usually doesn't like it when I make sweet potatoes! Following the recipe makers review, I decided to not even boil them at all. I just sliced them into wedge/fry shapes, coated them with oil, salt & pepper and baked them on parchment paper. I decided to flip them all over after 25 minutes...I don't think it is a must-do task, I just wanted them to be more crunchy. I baked them for 5 more minutes and done! Oh, I didn't have cilantro so I didn't get to taste them with that, and I don't have a zester so I just squeezed fresh lime juice over them before I coated them with the seasoning blend at the end. Thanks for a delish recipe! We are gonna be having this quite a bit!

This is great. It's not greasy like sweet potato fries can be. The combination of the heat of the spices and the tartness of the zest is unusual and delicious. We thought the texture was good, too. The larger size of the cuts made it tender on the inside but a little crispy on the outside. I did bump up the oven temp to 425 for the last 5 minutes or so to brown them. Will make often.

I didn't see the note about boiling till only fork tender and they came out mushy. Next time I will skip the boiling entirely and just peel, cut into thin wedges and increase baking time. The 1 T salt seemed like a lot so I added only 1 t sea salt to the seasoning and they were still too salty after salting before baking as well!

Really Yummy! I used 1/2 tsp of salt and it was plenty. I didn't have cilantro so I used scallions instead. I'll try the cilantro next time because it sounds great with the lime. I'm pretty sure this would also make a great rub for chicken or fish.

wow. Thanks for an AWESOME recipe. We LOVE sweet potatoes and have them often. I'm always looking for interesting ways to serve them and this one is a keeper for certain! Don't change the seasoning at all. It's fabulous as written. As for the cooking method...I opted to roast them like I do with other recipes. I peel and cut the raw potatoes into 1 inch-ish cubes rather than larger wedges then roast them at 400 for about 30 minutes, stirring every 15 or so minutes. This way I dont mess with the boiling part at all. Don't skip the zest or the cilantro. Its superb! I served it with a grilled steak with chimichurri sauce and polenta. :)

I found these to be too salty for my liking. I found them to be a bit mushy after taking them out of the oven, so i put them in the frying pan (with some non-stick cooking spray, as to not add any more oil) for a few minutes on high heat to crisp them up a bit. they were still a bit mushy, but tasted fine other than too much salt. next time i might bake them at a higher temp for a shorter time to make them more crispy. i also served them with some sour cream with some peprika and chili peppers mixed in.

Even my slightly picky son loved these. He actually asked me to put the leftover ones in his lunch the next day. They're even good cold! A very good recipe. I didn't have lime so I used lemon.

I am still trying to get it right with sweet potato fries! I boiled these a little too long, then looked at the skins and decided my family would never eat these if I left the skins on so I peeled them, and cut the mushy stuff into slices more or less. I used veg oil then baked them 20 minutes. The topping  is delicious though, the best part! I will make these again and will leave the skins on so they will be crispy.

I didn't boil first and just roasted in the oven for about 25 minutes at 400 degrees. Also,  I love salt but the amount called for seemed a bit much so I reduced it to 2 tsp for double the amount of potatoes listed in the recipe and it was still really salty for my taste. Next time I will not mix the salt in with the seasoning mixture and simply season to taste right before serving. I really loved the seasoning mixture otherwise and with a reduction in salt this is a great recipe!

Way to salty for my tastebuds. And the potatoes were hard to cut after they were boiled first. Mushy and fell apart. 
Liked the lime seasoning on the sweet potatoes though!

yes, I like it, used it many times and find the cooking prior to putting in the over makes them less soggy.   just use paprika and salt and garlic salt on mine but a personal preference, nice change.

Excellent spice!  I'm not sure about the boiling though.  They came out a little mushy for me.  I'll have to tweak it a little to avoid this next time.  Otherwise, these are surprisingly tasty!

After reading all the reviews, I took the advice of boiling the potatoes till what I interpreted them to be fork tender.  However, in the end, they were very mushy and unappetizing.  I even tried baking with and without the olive oil, but nothing could save them.  There wasn't enough spice mixture for all the potatoes either.  Sorry, won't be making this again.

Whole family loved them.  Especially enjoyed the lime zest.  Did find that two large sweet potatoes was enough to fill up a jelly roll pan.  Instead of brushing them with olive oil I sprayed them with the aerosol olive oil.  Was careful not to over boil.  Took a little monitoring.
