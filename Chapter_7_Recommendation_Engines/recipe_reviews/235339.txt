Loved this recipe! I made muffin size oat cakes and they are great (I used a 360 degree oven for 30 minutes and that worked well). Thank you for sharing this

It's defiantly a 5 star recipe. I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips instead of dates for sweetness and 1/2 cup of pumpkin seeds. I didn't have any pecans. I am not buying packaged granola bars anymore. Thank you for sharing the recipe!!

I have been wanting something like this for the last year or so. Something healthy I can make at home, then have ready to grab and keep in my purse to give my 2 1/2 yr old to snack on. I've been relying on packaged stuff, but now I can proudly offer these, and feel awesome about how they are homemade and preservative free. :D

I used olive oil instead of coconut oil and craisins instead of dates. I actually made them for my niece who just had a c-section, but doubled it and kept some for myself. I can't stop eating them. And I goofed and mixed the honey in, instead of drizzling it on top. I bet that would make it even better.

This is a great snack - packed with flavor, and very filling. I cut the recipe in half, because I had two overripe bananas to use up. I also added about 1/2 cup applesauce. I subbed sliced almonds for the pecans and raisins for the dates (what I had on hand). I think the recipe is really forgiving and you could easily substitute some pumpkin puree for some of the mashed banana and swap in your favorite nut butter, oil, seeds, nuts, dried fruit. Can't wait to experiment with my next batch!

I love this recipe.  I have made it now about 4 times.  I have changed up the ingredients a bunch of times and it had turned out awesome every time.  I love making them in muffin tins so that each one is crispy on the outside.  I have it for breakfast every morning and it keeps me full until lunch.  I store them in the freezer and heat them in microwave so it is a warm meal.  I am allergic to nuts so I add more pumpkin seed and sunflower seeds to the mix instead of the pecans

I have been making these for several months. Was buying protein bars for my husband to take to work & eating high sugar cookies to have with my coffee. Those days are gone. I have made multiple variations to allow for a variety, using this recipe as the base. All have been great. Have added dark chocolate chips, used spices found in gingerbread recipes, added molasses & walnuts, etc. Thanks for sharing!

They are awful! I feel like I'm eating the healthy pellets we feed farm animals. I followed the directions exactly as printed.

We made this for the Daniel Fast and just removed the honey and vanilla extract and it still came out well.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these twice. The first time I followed the recipe, no changes. I have to say, Iâ€™m not a big fan of the steel cut oats, they make the bars too chewy. This time I just use rolled oats, and I did change the water for apple juice. Wow! What a difference! This batch is WAY better!

I really liked this recipe! I only baked them for 40 minutes. The oat cakes are filling and nutritious. They also pair well with fresh fruit. I added some spices of my own and took some liberties with the recipe. I'll definitely make this again!

Have made it several times now. I put in raisins, coconut flakes and chocolate chips. I freeze them, and take them in my lunch every day for work. A great meal bar for those on the go. No more store bought granola bars for me. I have control over what goes in them. A very versatile recipe. I can put in extra nuts, seeds, or fruit according to my taste.

This recipe has been a breakfast and snack lifesaver for our family on the Daniel fast. Omit the honey to make it Daniel-friendly. Double the natural peanut butter and you won't even notice the lack of honey. On our second batch this week!

Nice and moist.  Don't over-bake.  If you aren't on a salt restricted diet, a 1/4 a1/2 tsp. of salt will give it that little something it needs.
