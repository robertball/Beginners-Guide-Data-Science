Fabulous sandwich! I love anything with Swiss so I had to give this a try. I opted for Hellman's light mayo and low fat Swiss. I added some thin sliced tomato and a couple of slices of bacon which proved to be wonderful additions. No matter what you add, you can't go wrong. Perfect with a side of fresh fruit!

I spread dijon on the second bread slice. Instead of cooking this in the oven, I made this into a grilled cheese by melting a little butter in my cast iron skillet and cooking the sandwich in the skillet. Very good.

Didn't have any rye bread, so I cooked this as a panini using a baguette I had on hand.  Did add a little dijon as well as some sliced tomatoes and saut√©ed sliced onion.  Nice sandwich.

Not sure why it has grilled in the title when it's broiled?!  Anyway, I loved this and I do like the broiled method, no butter or oil needed!  I added a couple roasted red pepper slices.  Tomato would be good too :)

So good. I didn't want to turn my oven on so I warmed them on the stove.
