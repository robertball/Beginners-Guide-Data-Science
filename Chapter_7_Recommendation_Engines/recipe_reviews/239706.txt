I made this as a side dish with salmon.  I also added more asparagus, and added it to the quinoa during the last 5 minutes of cooking.  This was an outstanding recipes, quick and simple.  I will be sharing this with others!

Really easy and really delicious. I used Trader Joes harvest grain blend and left the basil in. I also upped the arts so I could have a leftover. A little extra goat cheese might have just made its way in but it was a great, simple and healthy (extra goat cheese notwithstanding). I will definitely make this again.
