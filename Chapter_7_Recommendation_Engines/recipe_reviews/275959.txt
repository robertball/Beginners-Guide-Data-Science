I loved this. I added oregano to give the thyme more depth and also added a healthy sprinkle of cayenne pepper to give it some zing.  I also doubled the Farro mixture because it was great later served as a side w Rosemary-grilled chicken.

Loved this dish!  My daughter is vegetarian so I'm always looking at vegetarian or vegan dishes to make when she comes home for a few days.  This is a winner!
