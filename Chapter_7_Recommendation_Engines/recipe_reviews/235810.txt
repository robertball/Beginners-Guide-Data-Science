I make snow ice cream every winter and I just love it I have made it since I was a kid. same Exact recipe. Except I use 1 gallon snow,1 tbs Vanilla Extract. You can also put it in an air tight container and freeze for the hottest part of the summer. Just have to break it up add 1 - 2 tbls milk to blinder or food processor its still great. How many people can say they eat snow ice cream in the heat of the summer? I do all the time.

Just made this with my girls & they LOVED IT!! I didn't use near as much snow as called for tho. I also used a whole tablespoon of Vanilla instead of just a tsp. Def. something fun to do with your children. My Daddy made this for us all the time when I was a little girl. It's so wonderful to know that my girls will have great memories of this as well. Thanks for posting this!

Soooooo good!! Can I rate this a 10?! Made this exactly as stated for the family, but made me a little bowl separate using a little rum extract instead of vanilla and shredded coconut.I put out my bottles of food coloring and let the kids make theirs whatever color they want. This recipe is such a keeper!! Thanks for sharing amanda!

We got 2 feet of fresh snow for Christmas and I was craving eating the snow and was curious if I could make ice cream out of it. Thanks to allrecipes I found that I can! I only wanted to make a one-time serving for myself and husband, so I use a small 3.5 oz can of sweetened condensed milk, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, skipped the sugar, little splash of milk, and added snow until I got the consistency I wanted. I served it right away without requiring freezing and tasted great! My husband's favorite ice cream flavor is vanilla and he loved it. I had some egg nog on hand too so added a splash of that to mine and made it Christmas-flavored. We look forward to enjoying this all winter, with other flavor additions to experiment with.
