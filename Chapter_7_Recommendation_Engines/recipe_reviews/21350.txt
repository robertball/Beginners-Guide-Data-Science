I love chinese, and had some left over ing's that this recipe called for, so I thought I'd give it a try. I've never had mou shu pork before, so I can't really say if this particular recipe makes a good mou shu pork. Personally, none of us liked it. I don't know if it was the soy that's already in the Hoison sauce, and then more soy added to the recipe that did it, but it left a bitter aftertaste. Perhaps if the 2 T. of soy called for was left out, it might be passable. I used low salt soy too.

I'm Chinese, and Mu Shu Pork is one of my favorite dishes. I didn't think this tasted quite authentic, though. I would definitely cut back on the ginger next time, and I used cabbage instead of bok choy. I would also suggest using rice pancakes from an Asian grocery instead of flour tortillas. We tried wrapping ours in lettuce leaves, that was good.
I can't quite put my finger on what was wrong with the taste, but I know that in Chinese restaurants, they put either hoisin or plum sauce right on the rice pancake before serving the pork. This way made the dish a little too saucy.

I was looking for a recipe that I could sneak in some vegetables in my husband's dinner and this is a great way to do it.  Next time, I will cut the ginger in half as he said that the ginger was too overwhelming.  I would also cut the pork into thin strips to have it cook faster and I would do the meat in two batches as it cooked, but didn't brown.  Not a bad dish, but I think it might need some tweaking.  I am just not sure how to accomplish that. Hopefully, someone else here will have great ideas to offer. :)

I wanted to pare down the time it took to make this recipe, so I purchased a bagged mix of shredded asian veggies (in the bagged salad section) instead of slicing all the vegetables myself.  It worked out great, and saved tons of time I would have spent chopping.  Omitted the sake, as I was feeding this to the kids, and used dried ginger powder instead of fresh.  I definitely recommend using egg-roll wrappers instead of tortillas - they have the right "asian" texture and taste.  Steam them for a few minutes before serving, or microwave a few at a time wrapped in a moist paper towel, for 30-seconds.

Really easy!  I used apple cider vinegar instead of Sake.. seemed to work fine.  Loved being able to use some different ingredients than what I am use to.  Tasted great too!

This was real easy and a big hit in my house.  I did not use pork though. I used chicken and it was still wonderful. I will make this again...

Very tasty- my husband really liked this.  We added some plum sauce to the tortillas before putting the meat mixture on them since that is how our favorite Chinese restaurant serves them.

NOTHING ever tastes like Chinese from a restaurant, but I think this one is pretty good.  The only part I followed exactly was the sauce, which was good but we added more soy at the table.  Didn't have ginger or mushrooms, and used napa cabbage, shredded carrots and thinly sliced snow peas instead of bok choy and red pepper.  I also added scrambled egg and a little sesame oil.  The sauce was kind of soupy, maybe next time I'll add some cornstarch to thicken.  Not sure how to kick up the taste without more "sauce".  Served over rice instead of with wraps.

This recipe was just GREAT!  I used basic cabbage (because it was already in the frig!) and I used Eggroll wrappers.  We put hoisin sauce on the wraps as well, then rolled and ATE!  It's easy, quick and ABSOLUTELY delicious!

Nice Asian influenced wrap.  I did add a little sesame oil to the pan before adding the pork, onion, ginger and garlic.

This was just okay.  If you can imagine a egg roll with a soft shell, this is it!  Very americanized. Buying good sake was a waste of money.  Too much work for the results.

I didnâ€™t have bean sprouts but hardly missed them. MY Husband asked me to put this recipe on the make it again list. That is high praise.

We LOVED this!!!  The only change I made was that I marinated the raw meat (we used chicken) in the spices and sauces in the recipe--strained the liquid off, and then cooked as directed.  YUMMM!!!

I had some pork chops that were cooked the night before that needed to be used so I made something based on this recipe.

I started with the onion, garlic, and ginger (which I used about 2 TBSP. of the kind in the tube).  Then I added the pork (since it was already cooked).  I added pepper (I only had green), the mushrooms, and I didn't have bok choy so I used bamboo shoots from the can.  Cooked all of that until heated.

THEN, I considered it done.  I didn't add any of the sauce ingredients.  INSTEAD, I put the filling on a tortilla then topped it with plum sauce.

I thought it was pretty good this way and my kids actually ate it.

I don't know what Mou Shu pork is supposed to taste like, so can't say if it's authentic or not - but I enjoyed this, it was tasty but there was too much sauce - I'll halve it next time.  I didn't bother with tortilla wraps, just served it as a stir fry and it was great.  Used less bean sprouts than the recipe specified, will add more next time.

I think this is a good recipe.  But I'll cut the
bean sprouts half and also the ginger. Instead of using hoisin sauce I'll use soya sauce and add up some sugar and few drops of tabasco sauce(optional) as a replacement. I'd try chicken also to replace pork.
