Will definitely make over and over again. I used a 13"x9" pan.

Very good! Will make again. I added the vanilla after the chocolate/confessed milk mixture was melted. Vanilla is too expensive to cook out the flavor.

My second time and it came out as good as the first time. Very easy to make, and no need to alter it.
