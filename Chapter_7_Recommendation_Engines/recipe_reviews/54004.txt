I never made egg rolls before, so I expected some problems.  The only problem I had was that the first batch unrolled when I put them in the hot oil.  I found that when I put some water on the wrapper near the end of the roll, they stayed together beautifully.  My husband raved over these.  I used salad shrimp that I chopped in the food chopper.  I also used bag cole slaw mix and added some onion and garlic.  Really a great recipe.  Thank you Cindi.

I'm sorry but these were not to our taste at all.  I had a strange feeling about adding green pepper and should've left them out.  I like peppers, but don't think they belonged here.  Nobody would eat these, we had to order pizza.

I coarse ground 3/4 lb.pork stir fry meat,added 1 tsp 5 spice to the meat and browned.More than enough meat.. I used a whole bag of coleslaw mix for cabbage and carrots,worked nicely. I used 6 garlic cloves minced and 2 Tblsp peanut oil in place of the olive oil and 1 tsp Hoison sauce..I omitted the cornstarch it didnt need it. These egg rolls flew off the platter. My SIL loved them ( thats saying something, he loves Chinese food.)Thank U Cindi!!

These were excellent.  I put about a half an inch of oil in a frying pan and just kept turning them since I did not have deep fryer.  they turned out really well.  Thanks!

I made these for an office luncheon and everyone loved them (including me!). I used minced celery instead of bell pepper, and like cookinme, I used bagged cole slaw. I didn't have molasses so substituted brown sugar and added Chinese Five Spice in lieu of the ginger. Great recipe. Thanks Cindi!

Bake them at 400 degrees for 7-10 min.  Spray pan then add egg rolls and spray them too before baking.

Oh my goodness.  I have never liked Egg rolls but my culinary arts class made these today for a chinese dinner.  I am going to make them at home.  I could not believe how good they were - We used Pork.

Wow these were so good!  I have never made egg rolls before.  They were time consuming.  But worth it.  I used bagged coleslaw mix instead of shredding the cabbage.  I kept everything else the same.  I made them with Chinese Happy Family, from this site.  I know I will be making these again.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this vegetarian using scrambled tofu and marinating it with the cabbage mix.  The eggrolls were a huge hit at a recent potluck.  It is time comsuming to roll your own, but well worth it.

The first time I made these and it was a learning experience---Must not overfill the wrappers and must roll them pretty tightly with a little water to seal the ends also the oil must be the proper temperature or else they will fry too long and taste greasy (like my first try).  After learning from our mistakes the second time we made these, they were great!!!!  ..and the coleslaw mix works great!

I sauteed some cole slaw mix in a wok and added the 'sauce' and just used that to fill my wrappers.  I was really surprised with molasses in the sauce and I loved the flavor.  These were the most flavorful egg rolls I have ever made, my husband likes them as well.  You do not even need a sauce to dip them in, they taste wonderful by themselves.  I'm sure meat eaters would love the complete recipe but it works just as well to make with just the veggies!

These are great!  My first attempt at egg rolls.  It was fun.  I didn't have molasses, so I used 1 tsp of brown sugar.  I also baked mine at 425 for about 10 minutes.

I minced my cabbage.  I should have kept it shredded.  That being said, these were delicious.  Easy to make and flavorful.  I'll definitely make these again.

Delicious egg rolls!  I did make a few changes.  I didn't use the pork, which we don't like and I didn't add the pepper strips per a few of the reviews.  Otherwise I kept everything else exactly the same.  These are fast and easy and a definite keeper in my house.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the !st egg roll recipe I ever used, I made few adjustments to these 2nd and 3rd time around, omitted green pepper, used brown sugar in place of molasses. Used 12-14 oz classic coleslaw, broccoli slaw and bean sprout bags all found in produce section and mixed them all together (saved prep time and we prefer more of the veggie "crunch") (The wrappers are in produce section I buy 2 packs. makes 42 rolls ) Added more soy sauce and no cornstarch, I don't drain the small amount of pork fat and seems they hold together better and adds a little more flavor. I add 1.5 to 2 Tablespoons filling in wrap and dab a small amount water on end to hold together.These are also great served with Hot mustard! After cooling them down I freeze them they reheat easily in the oven and maintain the crunch. Thanks Cindi for sharing your recipe was a wonderful inspiration to a food I didn't know could be made at home so easily!!!

Made these without meat.  Husband even commented how good they were!  I used the microwave to cook the vegetables slightly...to cut back on prep time and the oil content.

Really quite good!   It's quite a lot of work, but not quite as complicated as I thought it would be.  I wouldn't do these often, but I would definately use it again.

I have made these several times, and while I admit they are not like the ones in my favorite chinese restuarant, they ARE very good, and the most important thing,  my family,  including all 7 grand children in ages from 3 to 16 LOVE them,  I have to make a double batch just so they can take some home with them.  They are easy, yummy, and well worth the LITTLE bit of work involved, which takes no time at all---Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I don't know where Cindi lives that these egg rolls are better than the ones in Chinese restaurants. These are good but not THAT GOOD. I'm in New York where there are plenty of good Asian restaurants. The eggrolls are good but nothing impressive. I baked mine at 375 degrees for about 15 minutes (to cut down on the fat). The Baked Pork Spring Rolls on this site are fabulous if you really want something to compare to the restaurant rolls.

Bloody excellent!! I rate this really highly. Perfect balance of everything. Lovely aroma and complex taste. Couldn't have been better. I just couldn't find the egg roll wrappers anywhere and ended up using rice wrappers which kind of split and fell apart. Didn't matter, licked the plate clean anyway.

Very good recipe, even if I did make my own modifications. :) I'm not a fan of bell peppers and I didn't have cabbage on hand, so I used finely chopped celery instead, lots of soy sauce and powdered ginger.. finally I used brown sugar instead of molasses. These were so juicy and tasty they didn't need dipping sauce, they were perfect on their own.

These were very yummy! I did make slight changes. I used a bag of coleslaw mix and left out the pork and the green pepper. Will definitely make these again.  I did have a minor problem with my first (test) one. It didn't want to stay together. This was solved by brushing an egg wash on the finale loose end. The rest came out perfect! **Update** I finally made these with pork. I used about 3/4 pound ground pork (still omitted the green pepper). Everyone LOVED them. Served with Sweet and Sour Sauce II (from this site), they were declared the best egg rolls ever eaten.

These are delicious!  I have a housefull of picky eaters and we all devoured these!  I made mine vegetarian and substituted 2C bean sprouts for 2C of the cabbage mixture.  YUM!  Thanks Cindi!

These are pretty good. I have to say that green pepper does not belong in egg rolls and I certainly would advise against using them here (has anyone ever had a chinese egg roll with green peppers in them?). Instead of the molasses (I was out) I substituted a nice teriyaki sauce. Came out well and my family enjoyed them but if I rated this recipe with the addition of the green pepper, the rating would have been much lower.

Excellent receipe.  However, I did change it just a bit.  I left out the ginger root, and added a heaping tsp of brown sugar to the molasses, soy sauce, and corn starch.  I also bought pre shredded cabbage and carrots to save time.  Very easy receipe and will share it with others.

I think this recipe would be fine if 2 things were followed. #1 Do NOT listen to ANY reviews suggesting Chinese 5 Spice. Who in their right mind (obviously me ) would put Cinamon in Egg Rolls? Second #2 Do not overcook the cabbage. Should only be a couple of mins. ,otherwise the mixture has too much liquid. Like a fool, I doubled the first batch. Now I have 40 Cinamon Pork Egg Rolls. I think you should follow the original recipe the first time & shoul be fine. 5 Stars because it was MY fault. Thanks

I enjoyed these pork egg rolls.  I omitted the green bell pepper because I have never seen an egg roll with that as one of the ingredients.  Do not be afraid that you are getting too much cabbage because when it cooks down, you want to make sure you still have plenty of vegetable to balance the meet.  

We served ours with a little store bought sweet and sour sauce and really enjoyed our egg rolls.

These are soooo yummy! I used ground chicken, and added about 1/2 tsp. of chinese 5 spice and some soy sauce to the meat while it cooked. I also added a bit of soy sauce to the veggies while they were stir-frying. Best egg rolls ever! Thanks, Cindi! :)

These were very good. My brother asks me to bring them to every family gathering now. I used bagged coleslaw mix and left out the green pepper simply because I don't like it, and they were delicious.

This one I found a whole lot better. I do say use the bag slaw mix, shaves off a bunch a time. There was something missing, don't know what it is yet, but something none the less. All in all, in this is a good one.

I personally feel that while I love green bell peppers and they are good in stir-fry but not in egg rolls. Once I eliminated the peppers and exchanged the strong flavor of the molasses for honey, the recipe was wonderful.  My husband and I prefer to eat our egg rolls by biting off the end and pouring good soy sauce into them so we don't eat the sweet & sour sauce but many of our family members enjoy it.  The only other thing to say is that I only use peanut oil to fry them but I know allergies prevent this for some diners.  If you can use it, it will really enhance the flavor of the finished food.

I always cook the recipe, as written first. I did this and loved these egg rolls! The first ones came apart in the fryer and after a short temper tantrum on my part, I used toothpicks to keep them closed. I read some of the reviews that said just wetting the wrappers with water is good enough. LOL So, a little overkill on my part. LOL I made the sweet and sour sauce from Nana Nat and now I can't wait to do them again. I might try shrimp next time!! Thanks for making this white girl a chinese hit tonight!!

I followed the recipe as written except I used a package of raw coleslaw cabbage. I also nixed the green pepper as since we don't like it and it seemed like it didn't belong. This cut my prep time which is always a plus. Otherwise, it was "as written". I was so pleasantly surprised when everything came out perfectly. I served this with "Sweet and Sour Sauce I" from this site. It was divine and since I had help rolling them it was done in no time. Pretty simple recipe. Will definitely this make again. I'll add more veggies and a little mushroom too, next time. Its a Keeper!

First time making egg rolls and we loved them. We baked them at 400 f for about 7 minutes each side since we don't have a deep fryer. These also taste fine cold, I had two on the way to work (easy to grab and go). If anyone is wondering, the egg roll wrappers are in the produce section of the grocery store we go to. Thanks for the wonderful recipe and opening our eyes to the world of egg roll making!

Fantastic.  I made half with the ground pork and the other half vegan with tofu.  I also added a small can of sliced mushrooms and a handful of fresh bean sprouts. Other than that, I followed it exactly.  They came out sooo fresh tasting.

These were great!  I just grated the cabbage, bell pepper, and onion in the food processor to simplify things.  I found that the mix was a little watery to put in the wrappers so I transferred it to a colander to let the extra liquid run out.  Great reviews!  I used red bell pepper rather than green.

Excellent recipe!  I broke my own cardinal rule about only rating a recipe that I've made exactly as written, I did leave out peppers.  I personally don't think of peppers when I think of egg rolls.  I was spot on with the rest of the recipe though, except I pan sauteed them to brown instead of deep frying.  Delicious filling, this recipe is now in my recipe box for a go-to!

For some reason I am not able to edit my own recipe, and I wanted to state that the temp to deep fry these egg rolls should be 375º, not 365º.  Also, when ready to seal the egg rolls, I'll add a bit of cornstarch to warm water to make a paste, which helps to seal the wrap a bit better. This recipe can make 20-25 egg rolls (or possibly 30-35). With this recipe, you can also use: 1 lb. ground beef, or 1 lb. seasoned pork sausage, or 8-ounces of medium-size precooked shrimp in place of the pork steak. You can also leave out the meat, and make them vegetarian.  Cindi (aka DomesticGoddess)

I was feeling ambitious, so I gave these a try. They were wonderful! Just like the egg rolls at a Chinese restaurant. I also made wonton's the same night with similar filling from another recipe on here.

I've made these several times and the whole extended family loves them! Even my 87 yr. old Dad was convinced to eat them with sweet and sour, not ketchup. I am making a double batch this weekend. I have never varied from the recipe, but need to try the shrimp. Sounds just as wonderful.

We made this with some leftover pork sausages and instead of using the larger sized egg role wrapper, all I had was the small ones so we made them the size of rangoons.  Sorry to say, but the hubby and I ate the whole batch.  It was delish.

We made these exactly like the recipe and they were so delicious! There is just the 2 of us so I frozen the rest. I pulled some out last night put them in the oven . To heat up and still...Yum. I will be making another batch to freeze when these are gone.

Pretty good.  I reduced the servings to 9 so I would just need 1 package of egg roll wrappers and I left out the bell pepper--didn't seem like an egg roll ingredient to me.  I did add 3 green onions, sliced (green and white) and 1 rib of chopped celery for more crunch.  Only used 1 clove of garlic.  I like it but it hurts me if I use too much.  Used 3 heaping cups of coleslaw mix and could have used a little more.  I used a 1/4 cup measure to fill the wrappers and still ran out of filling for the last 2 wrappers.  Grabbed a little leftover coleslaw mix and mixed up with a Tbs. of Hoisin sauce to make 2 vegetarian egg rolls to use up the last 2 wrappers.  Will make again but use 3 Tbs. of Hoisin sauce in place of the molasses mixture and a little more coleslaw mix.  Good recipe.

Wowee!! Made with precooked shrimp and added bean sprouts. Omitted green pepper. Baked at 375 degrees for about  12 minutes. Served with hot mustard.  Super yummy.  Sauce was the key.

Was not what I had hoped for. I have made far better egg rolls. They were ok. Even added small shrimp to kick up the flavor.  Froze 8 ski we will see what happens when we hear them up.

I left out the green pepper, added bean sprouts (substituted about 1 cup cabbage for 1 cup bean sprouts), and subbed brown sugar for the molasses. Baked on a sprayed cookie sheet; used brush to brush canola oil on top.  About 15 minutes at 400F but turn them over - I didn't think they were getting crispy until I turned them over and the bottom was very crispy. Very tasty with well balanced flavours. Baking made them less greasy (my biggest complaint about purchased egg rolls). Ate them with plum sauce. Planning to freeze some.

These are awesome! What a great recipe. I followed the core of this recipe-I used pork, onion, carrot, cabbage and garlic. But due to availability I skipped the ginger root and instead of using molasses, I subbed in a pinch of dark brown sugar. The cooking process for me was totally different than the submitter because I don't have a wok OR a deep fryer so I had to use a large sauté pan which worked well for me. I just had to cook the pork longer than three minutes and instead of cooking the veggies in batches I just threw all of it in at the same time. The key to filling the egg rolls is to keep it minimal so the stuff doesn't poke holes in it, and you have to really work hard to use too much water during sealing so be liberal with it, and your roll will stay. In a pan and not deep fryer you just have to watch to make sure they don't burn up...about 4 minutes per side for me. Cindy, thank you sooo much for this recipe. It is time consuming but so rewarding to know I put my own effort and love into making this for my family...and THAT is what make these better than any egg rolls from a restaurant!

Definitely greasy with all the oil, also meat is not necessary. Molasses did not add much to the flavor. Will not make again, but thanks for the recipe!

These egg rolls were good, loved the sauce . I eliminated the green pepper and used cole slaw mix for a shortcut instead of grating cabbage and carrots.   I didn't deep fry them.  I just used a few tablespoons of oil and browned them on each side.  I am sure we saved quite a few calories cooking them this way.  Great side dish for chinese dinner.  Thanks Cindi

Simple recipe that really needs sauce to be good.  Be to sure to not overcook the cabbage mixture.  Mine made exactly a one pound package egg roll wrappers.

Two things I did different.  I used some sirracha to heat it up a bit.  Instead of chopping the cabbage and carrots I used the prepared cole slaw to save time!  Yum!

I made these and they turned out great, I like the use of all fresh veggies and the ginger, next time I just will add more soy sauce.  A real hit with the sweet and sour sauce
