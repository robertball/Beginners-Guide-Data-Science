Perfect!! But with a few changes... I used condensed milk instead of evaporated, because I like thick, creamy pumpkin pie, and I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned. I followed others advice and increased the vanilla, added some nutmeg, and replaced a third of the white sugar with brown. It turned out great, and is my new favorite pumpkin pie recipe! Thanks a lot!

this recipe is extremely simple. however, it does need some tweaking. after following the directions exactly and reading the reviews after, i would say definitely wrap the crust in foil (mine burned and i only had it in for 28 minutes of the specified 40 at the end), do up the amount of vanilla, and do use more spice. not a bad recipe, just not as flavorful as you might expect from pumpkin pie.

it turned out great. my first time making pies. the crust burnt on the sides but i learned to cover the sides w/foil before baking. vanilla flavor is best for those who don't like the spicy flavored pies like me.

You have to adjust the sugar/vanilla level according to what kind of filling you use, and according to your taste. When using "pumpkin pie filling", you can leave the recipe as it is or reduce the sweetness. If using "pure pumpkin filling" or fresh pumpkin, you might want to add more sugar/vanilla or spices. Just do a taste test before baking. I think that the recipe, as written, is best for "pumpkin pie filling". Also, I baked the pie in a water bath and with foil around the rim to prevent burning, and used the recipe "Best Ever Pie Crust" for the crust.

This pie is excellent. Tastes fresh because there aren't too many spices overpowering the pumpkin flavor. It's creamy and bakes high, not flat and hard like some pumpkin pies. Received many compliments on this one.

Really easy and came out delicious.  The vanilla flavor was very subtle so if you want to truly taste the vanilla I'd add a little bit more. The crust almost burned though...I recommend covering it with aluminum foil.

Very easy,esp for beginners like me.  It was good, better chilled than room temp.  After reading the tips I used Pump.pie filling, dbled the vanilla and cinnamon, subbed 1/2 sugar with brown sugar and used a mix of evap. milk with sweet. cond. milk.  Very creamy and mild tasting-sweet enough but no big WOW factor. Next time I will add more spice.

This pumpkin pie is absolutely phenomenal!!!  I have made it countless times now & the recipe has never failed to amaze!  It is the absolute creamiest, dreamiest pumpkin pie I have ever eaten.  I did cut the sugar down to a half cup.  It was still amazing!  Thank you so much for this amazing recipe!!!!!!!!!!!

By the way, I am now craving this pie while pregnant with my fourth child!  OH DEAR!

I made this at Thanksgiving and while I thought it was good - I'm not usually a big pumpkin pie fan, so I like that it didn't taste like a traditional pumpkin pie - my husband wasn't as keen on it. He said it "didn't taste right", which is vague, but that's my husband for you. So four stars averaged out between us ;)

AB70, thank you for a wonderful recipe. I regularly make this pie throughout the fall and winter. The only change I make is to reduce the amount of sugar from 3/4 cup to 1/2 cup. For health reasons I've had to cut back on the amount of sugar in all the recipes I make. I've found that for any given recipe I can usually reduce the sugar by 25 percent without affecting the outcome or sacrificing taste.

I made two different pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving this year and this one was by far the favorite.  I doubled up on the vanilla as suggested by others.  I had to bake an extra ten minutes, but that might be my oven.  I was really glad to see this turn out so well - when you're baking at higher altitudes it's always hard to know what you're going to get, but this recipe worked great!

This recipe is great but I am only giving it 4 stars because I altered it so much. I used sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated, doubled the vanilla and added 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice and one teaspoon cinnamon. It help up beautifully and cut very nice. It wasn't runny at all.

This was a very easy and really good recipe.  Nice difference from the spicy pies. Used 1 can of Sweetened Condensed Milk in place of the evaporated milk and sugar. Turned out great.

Fantastic use of pumpkin!  I will definately make this one again.  My boyfriend said it is his favorite pumpkin pie which is saying a lot since he used to be a chef!  This recipe makes enough for 2 9" pies.

This pie is one of the best pumpkin pie recipes we have eaten.  We liked that it was not over powering with spice.  We followed the recipe as it was written, doubling for two pies.  We used fresh pumpkin.  Yum.

i like all pumpkin pies...but i would skip the unnecessary step of adding flour to the batter.  since discovering pumpkin chiffon pie, all others seem, just okay...

Very good pie!  I have to admit no one in my family makes pumpkin pie....we never have it at any holiday functions....my family prefers sweet potato pie...but I wanted to give it a try...this recipe was fine for those that do not like a spicy pie....however, i did want to taste some spice but I didn't want the pie to be overpowered by the spices.  The only thing I did differently was add 1/4 of brown sugar, only 1/2 white sugar, and a little bit more of vanilla.  I think next time I will make it a tad sweeter but that's just a personal preference....heck my 4 year old liked it and asked for more.  The only test is my husband...he doesn't like pumpkin pie...so we'll see.  But overall, i will make this pie for Thanksgiving.

Yum!  This was a bigger hit than the traditional pumpkin pie.  We all loved the addition of the vanilla, more of the pumpkin flavor was able to shine through.  I replaced the white sugar with Splenda.  And, added just a touch more cinnamon.  Bake time was perfect.  Will definitely make this one again next year!

Love this recipe!  No tweaking required unless you want more of something than the other.  For instance, if you LOVE vanilla flavor than add an extra tsp or if you love pumpkin spice then add 1/2 tsp.  This recipe is fools proof and delicious!

Loved how this pie came out!  I used a fresh sugar pumpkin to make the pie by cutting the pumpkin into cube and peeling then boiled till tender and pureed in blender.  I also followed some of the review suggestions; doubled vanilla, substituted 1/3 of the sugar with brown sugar, added extra cinnamon and a pinch of all spice.  This is definately the best pie I've ever made or tasted!  Thanks.

Pumpkin pie is normally not my favorite so when I decided to make this I wasn't too enthusiastic. To my delight it turned out to be absolutely delicious!! I used fresh pumpkin pulp, whole milk, and corn starch instead of flour. If you don't like pumpkin pie try this and you'll be converted!

It is a good recipe.  I was expecting something with more of a vanilla/less of a pumpkin pie taste.  I am  just not a pumpkin pie person, I guess.  It does bake up smooth and creamy, and I covered my crust, so browning/burning wasn't an issue.

this pie tasted great. The vanilla really gave pumpkin pie a new and interesting flavor. The only thing was that 20 minutes in a 450 degree oven really burned the entire edge of my crust so i had to break that part off. But other than that, everything else turned out great

As I type this review I am eating this DELICIOUS pie. I particularly liked how easy it is to make. My husband loves it too. It was my first time using fresh pumpkin. I took others advice and adjusted the sugar and increased the vanilla.

This was my first pie. It came out great. I used Pillsbury uncooked pie crust. I used a whole cup f sugar and two teaspoons of vanilla. My husband was really surprised how good it was considering it was my first pie..THANKS

Great pie.  We exchanged 1/4 white sugar for 1/4 brown sugar.  Increased both salt and cinnamon by a mere 1/4 tsp. each.  Great base from which to cook a perfect pumpkin pie.

I made this today from a pie pumpkin I bought over the weekend. After cooking the pumpkin in the oven, I pureed the pulp in the blender, and decided to just add all the ingredients in there (liquids first, followed by spices, then sugar, then flour). The pie is incredibly smooth. The only change I made to the recipe was adding a 1/4 tsp nutmeg and a bit more vanilla. It's plenty sweet without any additional sugar. So far, I've only eaten it warm, but I have a feeling I'll like it even more once it's cooled all the way... if it makes it that long!

I really wanted some pumpkin pie and I was going to use the recipe off the back of the pumpkin can (I used pure pumpkin puree, not pumpkin pie filling  BTW) I decided to just browse through all recipes just to see if there was another simple recipe that I liked better. I found this one and it seemed really simple and I liked the idea of adding vanilla which wasn't in the recipe on the can. I admit that I did add the ginger and cloves though. I just didn't want to risk missing the spices. Every thing else I kept exactly the same. It tastes fantastic. What I don't get is that I baked it according to the directions; 20 mins at 450 and 40 mins at 350 and the edges didn't burn and I ended up having to bake for an additional 20 mins at 350 to get it done in the middle. I don't know why that was. maybe just a fluke. That never happens so I'm pretty sure it isn't my oven!  Fantastic though!!! thanks for the recipe. The in-laws are coming for a visit in a few weeks and I think I'll make another one for them!!!

I only made 2 changes, Instead of white sugar I used Splenda, & I increased the vanilla to two and a half tsp. of PURE vanilla extract. WONDERFUL!!! If your looking to cut back on a few calories, try the splenda, still very sweet. Place a nice size dollop of cool whip & VIOLA!!! So easy to make & yummy!  ENJOY

I loved the creamy consistency of this pie!  The only thing I would change would be to add some extra pumkin pie spice.  I added it instead of the cinnamon and more than the recipe called for and it was still pretty bland although everyone seemed to like it with cool whip.  The extra spice would make it awesome!

This is one of my favorite pumpkin pie recipes! I don't like the taste (or smell) of cloves or any of the traditional pumpkin pie spices. I have even made this with the vanilla extract AND a little bit of almond extract to slightly change the flavor. Delicious either way!

We love this pie. Not really into the real spicy pies. I made pie as is and it was real good. Decided to put my own twist on this. Changes I made: 1/4 brown sugar and 2/4 white sugar. Also used 6 oz evap milk and 6 oz 1/2 and 1/2. 2 t cinn. 2 t vanilla, 1/4 t ginger and a dash of nutmeg. Like I said...pie is good as is, this is just my families personal likings. Will try with fresh pumpkin next time.

Best recipe for a fresh roasted pie pumpkin, I haven't tried it with canned.  The finished pie is a gorgeous creamy light orange color, and the taste is very custardy.

I don't know what happened with this recipe but it didn't work for me at all. The mixture was very watery and I followed the recipe down to the last bit. My crust burnt BAD and there was so much more filling then the regular 9 inch unbaked pie crust. I had plenty left over and the pie spilled over while baking. Something went wrong but I will keep trying. I love vanilla pumpkin pie.

I have used this recipe for a few years now. I only sub whole milk for evaporated as I can not get it in Korea. I often am lazy and make it with out a crust. Again, that is due to the fact that I live in Korea and there is no ready made crust available. Great easy to make recipe.

This was a pretty good, "unspicy" pumpkin pie recipe!  I ended up using the filling, as described here, but I used a homemade graham cracker crust, to line a muffin tin - to make mini pumpkin pies.  They were so cute!  For the mini pies, you must start out with a 350 F oven temp for 15-20 minutes, and then reduce to 300 F for the remaining 30 or so minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. :)

I made this pie, and it came out delicious. I tweaked it a bit, as well. I used 1 can of sweetened condensed milk, instead of evaporated and omitted the sugar. I added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1.5 tsp of cinnamon. I also added more vanilla, I used bourbon vanilla - 3 tsp. I loved the taste of the vanilla and cinnamon. This was a delicious pie. I covered my pie edges with foil as well, or it would have definitely burned. I suggest using a water bath so the pie would be aestheticaly pleasing. Great recipe, even though tweaked.

This was really good.  My husband, who does not especially like pumpkin pie, complemented me on this on Thanksgiving.  The "best you have ever made" he said!  I did add about a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  I am making it again for Christmas Eve.

this recipe calls for pumkin puree, and i wasnt sure what that meant... so I just went ahead and made it with libbys canned pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling.  it baked beautiful, but wasnt sweet enough and kind of bland... i just read DetectiveL's review of this recipe which explains that this recipe probablly intends for pie filling, otherwise its not sweet enough. i wish i read that review before i made the pie.

Excellent!!
I didn't have any cinnamon in the cupboard, so I used 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice (instead of recommended 2 tsp on the bottle).  The pie had the subtle hint of vanilla and spice.

I thought this was good but I like pumpkin pie with more spice to it. I used a milk substitute for the evaporated milk and in one batch used brown sugar and make it with white sugar for another batch. I used this to make both pies and tartletts. They both came out lovely. No cracking with this recipe. The brown sugar batch came out tasting like a vanilla caramel pumpkin pie....really nice flavor. This had a nice smooth texture and was very light. I will use this recipe again but with some more spices like nutmeg and clove. I may even try it with cadamom.

Turned out great! My dad adores this pie... shhh! don't tell my mom but he said it was better than hers!! The only thing I found was that I couldn't fit all the pumpkin filling into the deep dish pie crust. I'll have to play with it a little to find out how much less of everything I need.

I served this pie at a family get together last weekend and everyone loved it. I just just a little more vanilla extract and the best ever pie crust recipe with this.  This is definitly becoming a staple in my house.

Very yummy, i added more spice because that's how i like it...everyone loved it! big hit, especially with a homemade crust. I baked a pumpkin and pureed that to use in this recipe, but make sure it's the right kind! Sugar pumpkin has the right taste and texture, and it makes the pie come out rly well.

LOVED this pie! It's perfect for people who love the taste of pumpkin but don't like pumpkin pie because of the overbearing spices. My 14 year old son HATED pumpkin pie until this year and I have converted him with this one! He has requested this pie for all holidays for the rest of his life! The only change I made to this recipe was to grate some fresh nutmeg into the mix.

Thanks for this recipe!  I love pumpkin but don't love all the spices that usually accompany pumpkin recipes - blech!  Nice to see a pie that features fresh pumpkin flavor and is not overwhelmed by "pumpkin pie" spices!

So, my husband and I were both craving a pumpkin pie.  I went ahead and make this one, it was ok.  I wanted something a little more creamy.  But it  hit the spot for now. I have until Thanksgiving to try and find something better!

Delicious and very simple recipe!!  We really enjoyed the flavors of this pie.  It came out a little too "liquidy" which is the only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  Otherwise - fabulous!  Thanks!

A good recipe. Very simple and easy to make, and is very adaptable to flavouring. I needed a recipe that didn't include cinnamon, and wasn't sure how to go about making it. After reading the reviews, I increased the vanilla to one tablespoon and added two teaspoons of a combination of: dried ginger, allspice, cloves and nutmeg. I got the idea to try the spice combination from some of the other reviews I read. This is now my go to pumpkin pie recipe, and I can't wait to use maple syrup and a touch of hazelnut oil the next time I make this!

This has become a family favorite each year at Thanksgiving.  I usually substitute 1/4 tsp. maple extract for some of the vanilla, and put in a whole vanilla bean if I have one and I kick up the spices a bit with a bit of nutmeg and more cinnamon.  In my experience, even people who don't like pumpkin pie love this one.

PLEASE READ BEFORE MAKING:  If you use fresh pumpkin in the above recipe you will end up with a soupy liquid.  You either must strain the fresh pumpkin puree (fresh pumpkin holds a ton of water) or use less than half the amount of evaporated milk the recipe calls for.

Best pumpkin pie I have ear had. I made two changes, I used sweetened cond milk instead of evaporated and I used  all of the can of pumpkin not just 1.5 cups.  It was too much filling for the reg 9" shell. I put  the rest in a small ramekin and it was cooked in about 15 min, gave a preview of the pie to taste.  This pie is very sweet, not a spicy pie at all which is what we like.   The bake time was exactly what the recipe calls for.  I won't make any other pumpkin pie again.  I made this to see if it was good enough for Christmas next week, I will make it again next week for my family.

I have made this recipe for the past 10 years and it's by far my favorite pumpkin pie.  It is perfect exactly the way it's written.
The pumpkin really tastes fresh in this recipe with the addition of vanilla.  I also use sweet cinnamon which has a lighter flavor along with homemade whipped cream.  Very good recipe to try!

The vanilla gives this pie a wonderful flavor. Living in Venezuela, I used our common pumpkin vegetable, auyama - kind of a cross between pumpkin and butternut squash. The pie had a good texture - moist, but not too moist.  The cooking directions seemed perfect.  This recipe is a keeper and probably the only one I'll use.

Great recipe, there was a bit too much filling for the 9" pie tin I had, so I used the 2nd pie crust I had and made mini-pies in a cupcake pan. They came out great. Some other changes I made were to add some other pumpkin pie spices (ginger, nutmeg and cloves), 2 tsp of vanilla and I'm lactose intolerant so I substituted the evaporated milk with vanilla soy milk.

This pie allows you to appreciate the pumpkin in the pie. Imagine that, tasting the pumpkin in a pumpkin pie! I make it multiple times every fall season and my family loves it! I use non-fat condensed milk and make my own pumkin puree.

I really like this pumpkin pie.  I don't like all the spices in more "traditional" recipes so this was just what I was looking for.

This recipe is a great alternative to the one on the back of the pumkin mix can.  I did have to more than double the sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg to get any kind of taste, but it came out great in the end!

Great texture! Best pumpkin pie recipe I've tried, so I made it for Thanksgiving. It turned out great in a crust, and even better in individual crust-less ramekins that I made for some folks with gluten allergies. (I did use a little less sugar and fresh pumpkin). Beautiful and simple recipe; thank you very much!

I will never make a standard pumpkin pie again.  The best ever!! Used fresh pumpkin with a whole can of evaporated milk and the no roll pie crust.  Delicious!!

Good recipe, the flavor was ok, I added more vanilla and nutmeg to it. However the edge burned quickly. Are you sure that this is right oven temperature?

I've made this a few times and now add more vanilla, b/c the flavor doesn't prevails so much other wise. It's really yummy and the only pumpkin pie I make any more.

Everyone at my house was in love with this pie.  I did up the cinnamon and vanilla by half and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar, but those were the only changes I made.  Its funny, because I always thought I adored "spicy" pumpkin pies (lots of cinnamon, clove, ginger, nutmeg...), but this was out of sight.  Who knew vanilla and cinnamon were all you needed!

By far the best one I've made.I am not a fan of pumpkin pie but everyone else in my house is.However this one had Great flavor,great texture,and great presentation.Using just cinnamon is better than the all spice that goes into these pies.The only thing I didn't like staying put to change  oven temps. But overall what awonderful pie!

I combined it with the "Best Ever Pie Crust" recipe from this site.  Although my crust turned out to be one of the worst ever, the filling was ok.  I don't think the flavor merits the use of fresh pumpkin, as I couldn't foresee a significant difference when using canned in this recipe.  As others mentioned, the lightness of the pumpkin pie is what makes it different.  I'll stick with a pumpkin custard pie from the freezer section of my grocer though.

My daughter made this pie and no one in the family liked it so I was very surprized to read the reviews.  We did not use "pumpkin pie filling" but used reg. canned pumpkin.  Maybe that was the problem. It was so bland, not enough spice or sweetness. I think it's funny that a lot of people rated it high, but most people also changed the recipe!

Excellent recipe!  It was hit at Thanksgiving dinner and was eaten up by bedtime.  I used an extra large graham cracker crust.  I made a foil tent to go over the pie to prevent burning on the edges.  As many suggested, I also used extra vanilla, condensed milk, and a 50/50 mix of brown/white sugar.

This pumpkin pie is fabulous.  It is the perfect consistency and has an excellent fresh pumpkin flavor that gets lost in traditional spice pies.  I had no hassles cooking it--the measurements, cook times and temperatures can be followed without adjustments.

My grandma used to make the best pumpkin pie.  All I know is that it had vanilla in it.  Her recipe was lost when she passed away.  This is the only recipe I have found that has a similar taste.  It is awesome.  Thanks!

I wasn't a fan of pumpkin pies. Maybe because my Filipino taste buds weren't used to it. But then one day a friend of mine tasked me to make one. I said I don't make pies but he wouldn't hear no for an answer. I saw this recipe and bam! It turned out great! They loved it and I loved it myself.

Definitely a more mellow pumpkin pie than the traditional spicy... The combination of pumpkin, vanilla and cinnamon is delicious. I ended up with a little more mix than could go in the pie crust, so next time I might make 2 small ones or 1 big one. I'll definitely be making this one again!

Delicious pie, i added a pecan streusel topping just for some extra oomph. There are so many recipes for pumpkin pie it's nice to try a new one for fun every now and then. Very tasty!

I've never been able to stand pumpkin pie - until now. I made this for Thanksgiving, in a water bath, and it came out perfectly. Everyone enjoyed it, and preferred it over traditional spiced pies.

Good for kids, I prefer a little more spice though.  I made tarts out of this and topped it off with cream cheese icing.  Needless to say the kids gobbled them up and requested another batch.

Made this for Thanksgiving...and everyone liked it.  They did say that they liked the traditional pie that I normally make better, but this was still good.  I am glad that I tried this, but according to the relatives I should stick with what works...so I guess I will have to keep with mine.  Thanks for the post.

Everyone loved the pie, but I wasn't as excited as them. It tasted good, but is there a vanilla flavoring that woulda made it taste great? I added sweetened condensed milk instead and used McCormicks Pumpkin Spice Seasoning instead of ground cinammon. The biggest hit regarding the pie... I used a grahm cracked pie crust instead.
