I made this for my friends on Superbowl Sunday.  They loved it!  I made only a few minor tweaks... Added 1 extra clove of garlic.  Added 1 teaspoon of italian seasoning.  Added 1 teaspoon of Aleppo pepper (for that extra kick).

Recipe needs at least one more clove of garlic.Pasta water needs to be salted. I tossed it with angel hair pasta, but it needed fresh ground pepper to give it a little more umph.Next time I'll use thin spaghetti.

Not much taste when combined with pasta.  But the shrimp tasted great even without a lot of seasoning.

something  I have been making for years. I use frozen shrimp the largest ones I can find peeled, deveined with the tails on. I steep them frozen in with the garlic, oil and spices very low so they don't cook, just want them to thaw and make their own juices....YUM.  Toss with Linguine and some Parm cheese.  One of the best dishes.

Very simple to make. Flavor was good, but not great. I served it skewered (after cooking) as a side to a main dish with meat, and I think it works that way. May use again, but won't go for it as a main dish unless I'm in a rush.

Considering the ease of preparation and the few ingredients, this was delicious. I did not have Italian parsley so I used curly parsley, and this worked fine. My husband found it a little less than satisfying, but only because it was light and relatively low-calorie. It is a beautiful meal, and I would consider serving it to company in the summer.

Very good! I changed it up a bite, but same Idea. I pelled the shrimp about 5 hrs ahead and put Shrimp, 2 tblsp Olive oil, 1 tblsp lemon juice, garlic powder, some green onion, parsely and added some Chipolte and put into a ziplock back (take out extra air) and put in refrigerator until I was ready to cook it later, then followed the directions.  Added extra garlic, green onions and parmesan as well.  But very good!

This had a nice, clean flavor and is an easy week-night meal.  I added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes and next time might trade feta for the pamesan.

I'm not the biggest shrimp fan, so saying that I loved this is surprising to me.  I've made it twice and liked it better the first time I made it because I used a freshly shredded Romano-Parmesan cheese mix instead of grated Parmesan.

i made this recipe without the parsely because i forgot to buy it.  however, i did take the other user's suggestions and added more garlic.  it was wonderful.  the cheese really added some kick to it too.  next time, i'll try to remember the parsley and will definitely be making this again.

This was pretty good.  You have to enjoy the flavor of parsley if you're going to make this dish.  I followed some of the suggestions here and used 4 cloves of garlic, some Italian seasoning, ground black pepper, and a splash of white wine while it was all cooking.  It turned out pretty good and took no time to make.

Easy, yes. Delicious? Not so much. The flavours were too bland, and as a poor student who can rarely afford seafood, I found this dish to be a waste of money.

My suggestion is simply to disregard the measurements,  use all ingredients to taste, and you'll love this simple preparation of shrimp. What's missing is salt, pepper and maybe a squeeze of lemon. (And I don't add the Parmesan)

it is easy, but as others suggested I changed this to give it some umpf--therefore the rating.  I used tons more garlic, garlic chives for half the parsley and cayenne pepper sprinkled over all.  Then it was pretty tasty!

I thought this was good, but was missing a little something to make it really special.  Maybe white wine while cooking?  I think I'll keep looking.

After adding a little salt and extra garlic, we really enjoyed this.  If you can get the seafood shoppe to peel the shrimp for you, this would be an extremely easy dish to prepare.

I loved this! A great meal for Atkins dieters. Because I love garlic and onion, I used extra garlic and lots of green onion. As a result, my shrimp were very tasty. Good with or without the parmesan-- I personally like it without.

I thought the taste was rather bland.  The next time I made this dish, I tweaked it with some veggies, green, red and yellow or orange, cut in strips, and added 2 lbs of asparagus.  It was super delicious, my significant other loved it!

This recipe was good, but I did follow the lead of another reviewer by using freshly grated Romano cheese instead of Parmesan.  I think no matter which cheese you used, 1/2 cup would be WAAAAAY to much.  I will probably make this dish again, but will only use 1/4 cup of cheese which would be more than enough IMHO.

This is very similar to a dish that I make. Except I use half butter to the olive oil and since I'm not very fond of parsley I use cilantro, which I LOVE. After I dish up the kids servings (they love it too) I add some red pepper flakes and sometimes jalepeno. YUM!!!

As an Atkins dieter, I found this recipe to be tasty, satisfying, and 100% Atkins friendly!  I added lots of parmasean and some extra garlic.  This may become a regular dinner in our house!

Not exciting at all.  The flavor was blah and there are several other things I would rather do with shrimp.  I would probably not make again.

Oh wow was this awesome!  I only used a few sprinkles of parmesan because I didn't want a big cheese taste.  I also added a few splashes of white wine at the end.  Tasted like a dish I'd pay a lot of $$ for at a restaurant.

This turned out very nice.  Did make a few changes, added 4 cloves of garlic and since the family prefers a sauce, I added a cup of white wine and the juice of 1 lemon. Made a very nice sauce that went well with the shrimp over angel hair pasta.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except that I did not have fresh parsley so used dried.  We had recently had  a lot of pasta, so I served it over wild rice.  It was delicious, and I will certainly make this again!

Great base recipe.  I added 1 more garlic clove like others recommended.  Then added 3 TBP butter, 2 TBP dried parsley instead of fresh since I didn’t have it, 2 TBP garlic herb seasoning.  Mild and flavorful!

Really good....but I made some changes.  Cooked up a few slices of bacon and crumbled.  Extra garlic and added a good amount of black pepper and some salt.  Used olive oil and butter to saute and then added a good splash of chicken broth (would have used white wine but I was out).  Served on a bed of whole wheat pasta.   Really good!  DH loved it too!

Used frozen, peeled shrimp. Made the recipe exactly as written. The liquid from the shrimp combined with the other ingredients making a nice sauce that combined well with the pasta. The light touch on the ingredient combination let the shrimp flavor come through. Good, quick recipe for shrimp. Will make again.

Made this for my hubby and I and served it on wild garlic linguini.  It was very easy to make and the taste was very good.  The only thing I would change is make more sauce to go onto the pasta - but this is a preference as the recipe is fine as it is.  If had had more sauce, would have given this 5 stars.  Will definitely make this again!

Excellent main dish! We're adding more fish to our diets and that can get boring in a hurry. When I searched for shrimp recipes, this was the first I tried. We loved every bite. The flavours poured from this dish. A true success!

This was so simple and easy to make.  I used about 1 and 1/2 pounds of medium sized shrimp and served over angel hair pasta.  Additional parmesan was on the side for each individual to add to their own taste.  A great meal with a simple side salad to serve on a very busy day.  Thank you for posting, Maggie Gee.

This was a very easy and fast recipe.  I didn't have green onions so I used white onions and it still turned out great.  I definately will make this again.
