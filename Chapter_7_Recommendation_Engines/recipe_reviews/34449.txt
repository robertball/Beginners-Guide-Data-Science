Thanks so much for posting this! I had an empty container of storebrand IS, and I had all the individual spices, but didn't know the proportions to mix and refill it. My attempt has generated a few tips: 1. grind just the coarser spices first; my food processor was just flipping the rosemary around and the finer stuff created a cloud of dust. 2. Wait a while before opening your machine until the dust settles. 3. If you have a coffee grinder (I remembered later that I have one set aside for spices,) that is a better machine to use.

This is really good. I did mix and match this recipe w/ the Italian Seasoning I, since the only difference btwn the two seemed to be the red pepper flakes, the use of Savory, and the use of sage.  I didn't have any Savory so I just added the sage (only 1tbsp) and the red pepper flakes  Only problem was that it was too spicy for my daughter.  So when I run out of what I made I will make it w/out the red pepper flakes and add it separately.  I used this to make two items.  The first was the fanned Potatoes recipe on this forum and the second was to make a spaghetti sauce.  I've always made my own, but used the store bought seasoning and this is by far much better.  My husband is not a huge Spaghetti sauce fan and he raved about it.  Will continue to use this in all of my Italian cooking endeavors.

Great italian seasoning mix. I add crushed red pepper flake to mine. I like to make big batches of this in a pint Ball jar. All I have to do is increase the serving size to 50, throw the seasonings in the Ball jar and slap a lid on it. Then I hand it to one of my kids to shake up. Way better than anything you can buy pre-made.

So quick and easy, you'll never buy the prepackaged stuff again.  You can also add any other ingredients you like - especially garlic powder.  Very nice!

I don't recomend eating this alone, lol, not that I tried. It goes great in a lemon butter seasoned vegetable recipe on this site. Much better than buying the seasoning in a package. I like this one better than the other Italian seasoning found on the site since the other one has a few ingredients I rarely have

For me personally, this was just okay.  It had too much sage in it for MY tastes, so if you are not a sage lover cut down on the amount by at least half.  Or even replace the sage with something you like more.  That is just my personal taste opinion.

Perfect combination of herbs and spices. I keep this on hand all the time. Great to add to olive oil along with some garlic powder, salt and fresh cracked pepper in which to dip hot bread served with a great Italian meal.

Great ! Now kick-it-up a notch with a table spoon of Fennel seed and now you can make your own version of sweet Italian Sausage, or kick it hotter by adding a teaspoon of red pepper flakes or more to suit your taste.

I have never bought Italian Seasoning after discovering this recipe!  Instead of a food processor, I bought an inexpensive coffee bean grinder that I use strictly for spices!  I think it does a better job than a food processor and because it's only used for spices, you don't have any coffee odors that you might get by using a dirty coffee bean grinder.

I didn't have quite enough sage (only had about a tsp) but I'll just add some when I get some more. I don't know that I could tell a difference between this & a name brand. I didn't want too fine a grind so I just crushed it all up a bit w/ a mortar & pestle. Thanks for the recipe!

This was fun to make and super easy, not that I would abandon ready made Italian seasoning mixes for it, though. It was great for the Italian seasoned bread crumbs I had to make for the Fried Mozzarella Cheese Sticks recipe on this site.

This is awesome. I didn't have any Italian seasoning for a recipe i was making so decided to try this. Didn't have the marjoram but it was great without. Can't imagine how much better it would be with it. Thanks Denyse for getting me out of a pinch.

Great for when you want to make your own seasoning blend. Next time I will cut the amount of sage in half, I thought it was a little too overwhelming.

I was really disappointed with this one.  Because of the rosemary, you can't use a shaker top or it won't come out.  But the sage comes out so quickly it just seems to coat everything.  I kept reducing and reducing the amount I used but never ended up liking this one.

I also buy my basic herbs in bulk.  This blend is perfect.  Will be my new stock mixture.  Makes you feel good knowing there's no fillers or sodium in the seasoning mixes, huh?

So convenient! As I'm getting ready to make another batch I realized I never rated this - this blend works very well for us.  I mash all the ingredients with a ridged mortar and pestle set I have mainly because my husband doesn't like the texture of rosemary. I don't keep mine in a shaker, but by doing that you could easily store it that way (I just use a ziplock baggie and measure as needed).

I make this all the time--a perfect way to make your own seasoning instead of paying through the nose at the grocery store.  Especially since I have all of these spices in my kitchen.  I don't bother mixing in the food processor; I just mix together, then place it all in a spice jar to use as I go.  The only herb I might want to crush is the rosemary since it can be a bit tough.  Otherwise, the rest works perfectly well.  thanks for the recipe!

Only difference is, I have fresh herbs growing outside and on my porch, the difference in flavor is like night and day. Plus sometimes I add a little grated Parm/Romano cheese mix to the seasoning. Awesome!

Excellent blend and almost perfect, except I prefer more rosemary than marjoram. I will swap those two measurements and use that for my go-to Italian Seasoning. Thanks for this recipe!

Any time, I don't have Italian seasoning - this is a fast substitute.  I reduce it to use teaspoons instead of tablespoons and I usually use it in a day or two.

Very good!  I didn't have any IS and this saved our dinner tonight.  Thank you for sharing!  There is one spice note that was kind of sticking out to me - maybe the rosemary so I will tweak future batches a little to adjust for our tastes.  I used teaspoons instead of tablespoons because I don't use Italian seasoning very often.  This was simple to follow and worked beautifully.  Thanks again!

This is a good basic Italian seasoning, for sauces and gravies.

1 1 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/34449/italian-seasoning-ii/ ... This was good.  I always halve thyme, but that's the only change.  Just used mortar & pestle to crush them for this ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/8709/roasted-lemon-herb-chicken/ ... which is one of my favorite "whole chicken" recipes.  :)

This is a nice, base blend for recipes needing "Italian Seasoning" for personal tatses I left out the rosemary. Also, I added a small, crushed bay leaf- I've yet to meet an Italian grandmother that didn't toss one in for good measure.  Thank you Denyse for your recipe.

I really needed this recipe today! Five stars as written but  I added a Tbs. each of garlic and onion powder because I just had to. This was perfect for my homemade Marinara sauce. My guy was duly impressed. So was I. :o)

I love this receipe.  I stopped using precreated spices about a year ago when I was out of "taco" seasoning and thought I was in trouble.  But sure enough, I have all the spices in my pantry to create my own.  I use this Italian seasoning in with my italian beef recipe and it turns out perferct every time.  Thanks!

I was so happy to find this recipe. I had already browned 2 lbs. of ground beef and put the entire recipe for spaghetti sauce in the slow cooker when I went to get the Italian Seasoning out of my cupboard. I had none! Allrecipes to the rescue. I love this site! And the bonus is that I have almost a full spice jar for many more uses.

I added a tablespoon of garlic powder, then applied my immersion blender. Second time making it, and so much easier than trying to remember generic Italian spices individually.

I use this mix for a creamy italian dressing.  I followed exactly except didnt add sage.  Works perfectly for my dressing.  Note:  I did not use a food processor.  Just mixed with spoon and store in a mason jar.

Thank you so much for getting me started making my own Italian seasoning!!  I'm so pleased to be able to do this.  I did make some changes, but its a preference in taste.  I added 1 T garlic granules,  2 t black pepper, 1 t ground red pepper and 2 t fennel seeds (ground a little) into this and I cut back to 1 t the Rosemary, Sage and Thyme.  I may put more Marjoram the next time (because I love the taste)  I am not a shaker, I pinch or spoon seasonings out. Again my preference!  but I'm so glad to get started on my own seasoning!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It take another cook's encouragement to be bold enough to do this!!

Made no changes. Better than the store blend IMO. AND because I can use up individual seasonings that I use for other things as well, and keep those fresher by rotating through them faster!

I don't really care for the already mixed italian seasoning, but this was really good. I didn't have the thyme so I had to leave that out. Used this in best ziti ever from this site and it worked great! Will use the seasong mix from now on when I need italian seasoning! Thanks.
