The dressing is quite good, although I would suggest omitting the salt since the feta is salty.  It can be added at at the table if needed.  I would like another flavor or crunchy element too. Maybe some sliced red onion.  I'll play with it and report back.

This is a phenomenal recipe! I have made it for a few people who claim not to like avocado or feta and they are very surprised! This is the second time I have made it. I tend to be fairly casual about measuring, but if my goal is to cut it in half, so what if I add a bit more garlic or feta, both very high on my list of favorite things.

I love, love, love this salad.  I was hoping it was similar to a avocado salad I had here in Frisco TX.  It met my expectations and then some.  I keep it handy in the fridge because it's become my new "go to " salad.  I did not add the feta, I left it as is.  I serve it on a bed of greens with pita bread on the side.

My husband is not a big fan of avocados, but he loved this recipe.  The dressing is outstanding.

I'm subbing blue cheese and adding fresh cilantro. Loving the cilantro, the blue cheese is a little strong. Great recipe!
