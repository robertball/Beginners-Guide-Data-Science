My husband and I both thought this recipe was delicious. Because I like my pasta saucy, I pureed about half the veggies, making a thick sauce, and chopped the other half. A little extra salt, pepper and parm on top and yumm! It's rich and unique, I never would have thought of it myself. Thanks!

A great recipe! You dont need a food processor. I just chopped everything finely. Parmesan cheese adds more flavour rather than dumping salt into it.

I felt the sauce was a very creative base or foundation to which to add, making it quite versatile. If it would have called for more seasonings I would have given it a 4. I chose to add fresh ground pepper, garlic salt, a pinch of paprika and a pinch of dry mustard. It was quite tasty. Next time I would saute the veggies with evoo before putting them in the food processor for more depth.

This dish is terribly short on visual appeal, and that's a shame, since we first feast with our eyes. There is just no other way to describe this sauce other than it was a sort of chunky, odd-colored, creamy mush, definitely not something I wanted to photograph. But boy, oh boy, did this TASTE good!  Hubs and I both loved it and believe it or not, weird combination as it is, he actually requested that I pack the leftovers in his lunch tomorrow along with his rotisserie chicken sandwich!  We just loved the rich, earthy flavor of this, tho' that was helped along with a specialty porcini mushrom orzo blend rather than farfalle. I found the flour to be totally unnecessary and didn't use it.  In fact, I even found I wanted to add a little more half-and-half just before serving. Creative idea, tasty and compatible ingredients, and simply delicious, even tho' you'd never expect it from the looks of it!

I grated the zucchini and sliced the onions and mushrooms and added red bell pepper.  2% milk with an added tblsp of butter made this plenty creamy for me.  Thyme, salt, and black pepper and a garnish of chives made for a very tasty pasta sauce.

A good basic sauce.  Could be tweaked a little to give it more "kick" (red pepper?).  I pureed all the zucchini and my squash-hating teenager never  even knew it was in there; she loved it.

Good recipe.  I had alot more sauce than I wanted on the noodles so I just froze the remainder and used it later for a quick dinner.  I also added a half cup of chicken broth to the garlic and vegetables while they were cooking- that added good flavor.

I give this a 3, but it has more potential! 10 zucchini is a ton- I used 2 large zucchini and 2 small yellow zucchini instead and it was overflowing in my large skillet.   I love chunky veggies, but I chopped everything very fine for this.  I would suggest to puree the veggies.  But flavor was definitely there, just needs some tweaking! I added garlic salt, pepper, parmesan and served with fresh tomatoes.  (That really helped to compliment the mushroom flavor!)

I added onion and carmelized it first, yellow pepper and parmesan cheese.  Need the pepper and cheese to make it more tasty and not as bland. I also used cremini and button mushrooms and only 4 zucchinis.  Not bad for a vegetarian dish..

One of my husbands all time favorites. I slice all of the veges instead of chopping them in the food processor, this makes them more noticable. I only use 1 zuccini and usually try to put in a couple types of mushrooms totaling 1 lb or so (crimini and shitake are both excellent).

I pretty much concur with the assessment of naples34102. Great flavor, but hard to get past the look of it, which is about like something a cat coughed up. To help in that department, I waited until within a couple of minutes before serving, and tossed in a handful of fresh, chopped spinach leaves, and garnished with julienne of fresh tomato. Then, dusted liberally with parsley after plating. In place of the flour, I pureed 2/3 of the vegetable mixture in the food processor, which thickened it perfectly. Also, to streamline the caloric content, I used 1 cup skim milk, 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup half-and-half. Much trimmer profile this way. All-in-all, it's tasty, but just be prepared that it's a gold medalist in the ugly-duckling cooking contest, which knocks it out of 5-star contention.

I chopped the veggies by hand to make it more visually appealing and added some white wine while sauteeing.  Also added about 1/4 cup of sour cream.  Delicious!  Was like a vegetable stroganoff.

This had a unique flavor and was very easy to prepare. I used the same ingredients (except I subbed a mix of almond milk and coconut milk for the cream, and I used spelt flour), but my process was different. I sauteed the veggies before pureeing them, and I pureed only about 3/4 of the mixture. It was much more thick than saucy, so I think next time I'll puree half, add some veg broth, and omit the flour. I also added fresh oregano and thyme--yum! I'll definitely make this again.

This sauce was okay. It was definatly different. I accidently pureed the veggies, which actually turned out to be quite a nice sauce once I added the cream. It made way to much. Maybe zucchinis are bigger where I'm from, but 10 is alot. I only used 4 and it still made a huge pot full. I probably won't make this again.

This was EXACTLY what I was looking to make. I chopped the veggies small because I prefer chunky. Added 2 carrots and a tomato for some color and more flavor. Also, while simmering it was getting too dry so I added some Worcestershire sauce & a few dribble of chicken broth. After I added the cream & parmesan to complete the sauce. Served with sea shell pasta. Nice rich flavor so that even husband didn't mind it being meatless. Will make this again.

Wow!  My husband and I loved this.  Next time I make it I will add sugar snap peas too.  I used portabella mushrooms this time and they added a very nice full flavor.  Thanks for a recipe that will now be one of my regulars.

This recipe was a hit for all the veggies it packed into the sauce, but needed a little more flavor for my  house. I ended up added a southwest seasoning &  fresh thyme and we ate it for a few days! Over pasta one day and over a piece of toasted bread with cheese melted on top the next! I used milk instead of half & half and it worked out fine, just needed to simmered for a bit longer but the reduction in calories was worth it!

Maybe I did something wrong, but I found this very bland.  Granted, I don't have a food processor and tried to use my blender, but I don't think that would have made much difference.  I probably will not try this one again.

It is nice, but due to health reasons I did go with low fat/low sodium version simply putting yogurt instead of cream. and adding a pinch of Italian seasoning.

I loved this!  The only flaw is that it needs a lot of seasoning to spice it up.  Salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, etc.  But it was delicious!

A quick and tasty recipe.  We used green onions and a store bought alfredo sauce to use it up.  Will try next time with the listed sauce.

Wonderful! I chopped the veggies instead of putting them in the food processor (afraid I'd have veggie soup instead), and we ate them with homeade orrechiette. My husband isn't much for vegetarian dinners but his plate was so clean it could have skipped the dishwasher :) I made it 2 nights in a row and it's now a #1 meal in my weekly menu. thanks helena!

I made a few changes to this recipe but my results were delish!  I only used 2 zucchinis.  I sliced my mushrooms and zucchines into thin slices as opposed to food processoring them.  I did not use an onion or garlic, just added 1/4 tsp of onion and garlic powder to my butter while it melted.  I added 1/2 cup of freshly grater parm. cheese to the sauce during the last few minutes of cooking.  I also added quite a bit of salt -- probably 1 teaspoon + all together, but it needed it and was not salty at all when finished.  I used rigatoni pasta (I had it on hand) and it was soooo wonderful!  It's one of my new favorite base recipes for a creamy sauce, you can really add any veggie you want, I think it would be wonderful with a few different types of mushrooms and no zucchini for a creamy mushroom pasta.   Yummy!

I was a bit hesitant while I was cooking this...it didn't seem like it would make a good sauce.  But it actually turned out quite well.  I added quite a bit more garlic and pepper, and I used skim milk instead of the cream.  It is a very thick, chunky sauce...so make sure you use a pasta that will hold onto the sauce, like the bow ties or shells.  When I'm craving creamy pasta without the fat, I'll go for this again.
