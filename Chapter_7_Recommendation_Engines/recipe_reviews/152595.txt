This was a fair recipe. It tasted like chocolate cream cheese, which wasn't so bad. The thing I really didn't like was the "truffle" never firmed up, even after 24 hours in the fridge. It was still very soft.

I made them about 1 inch in diameter, next time I will make them smaller. They are very rich.

I made these, and I find the chocolate flavor to be too strong. I'd add more cream cheese or a bit of light cream.
