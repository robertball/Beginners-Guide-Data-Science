Perfect texture, and nice and creamy, just like gelato should be. The only adjustment I made was to use more cream - probably 1-1/2 cups to 1-1/2 cups of 2% milk (no whole milk on hand). The espresso powder adds a nice mocha flavor, and the hazelnut spread is just subtle enough to tell that it's hazelnut, without being over-powering. My kids are in Italy right now, and when they get back, they are going to LOVE this as a treat to bring back those memories of their Italian summer.

This was amazing! I have to admit that I was concerned during the cooking process because I was afraid that the egg was going to cook into pieces even though I had already introduced the milk mixture into the egg mixture. Also, it never became thick enough to coat the back of a spoon which also concerned me so I cooked it for longer than it said because I kept waiting for that to happen. It never happened. I did remove it from the stove because I was afraid to overcook it. I was going to skip the straining step but the mixture seemed grainy to me (again I was afraid the egg got cooked) so I went ahead with the straining. Donâ€™t skip this process! The ice cream was so smooth and flavorful! Everyone who tried it loved it! The one suggestion I have is if you like less of a coffee flavor to maybe use less coffee in it but for me I loved it just the way it was. We finished it last night and my kids are already asking me to make it again. I will definitely make this again!
