This was very good.  The cinnamon added nice flavor.  I used the brown sugar and it was wonderful, but my husband liked it with syrup also.

Hmmmmmm......these were interesting. Whipped up the batch, looked ok. Dunked the bread in it, plopped it on the griddle, seemed fine. Added a little cinnamon decoration, no problems yet. About eight minutes later, after I had done some flipping and rearranging, they began to burn. My stove has "lo 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 hi" settings and I had it on 7. By the time I had made the last piece I had switched it down to 3. Watch these do not leave them alone they get very messed up! It probably depends on the stove but we needed low medium heat. These were funny- not sure I'll make them again. Big French toast fan-but not really of these.

DELICIOUS! Lo-cal with 1% milk.  Freeze leftovers.  Be sure and use the brown sugar-no syrup

I would agree that this needs more egg.  I looked at the mixture and added 2 more eggs.

I was a little skeptical of the milk/egg ratio, but decided to go with it anyway - that was a mistake. These were so bland and insubstantial, and the texture was just plain weird. There are much much better French toast recipes out there. Thanks anyway.
