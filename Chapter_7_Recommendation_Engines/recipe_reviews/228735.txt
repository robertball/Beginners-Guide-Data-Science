Yummy!  Just don't use all the milk it calls for, maybe try half a cup and add more if needed, or you will have batter instead of dough!

The owners of this recipe either need to edit the ingredients or take it down. If you follow the recipe it will absolutely not make a dough, it will make a slurry which you have to doctor so drastically itâ€™s no longer what you intended to make. Whatever you do, do NOT use 1 cup of milk.
