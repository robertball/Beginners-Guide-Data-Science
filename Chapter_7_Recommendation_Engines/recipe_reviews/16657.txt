A wonderful recipe!  The only thing that I did different was stirred half of the cheese into the potatoes and put the other half on top.  It added some cheesy flavor throughout.

Very good. I made a few changes. I was making this just for the Hubby and myself, so I cut it down drastically. I added chives like another reviewer. I also used shredded mozzerella inside the potatoes, and sliced american over the top. Very easy and makes instant potatoes taste great!

I left out the bacon in this recipe but otherwise I followed it exactly.  My family really liked it.  My husband said it tastes like the inside of twice baked potatoes.  Really good.

I substitute ricotta cheese for sour cream and use fresh bacon.  If you want to spice it up a bit, use pepper jack in place of cheddar.  Add some finely chopped chives and you're set!

THIS RECIPE IS GOOD FOR WHEN YOU'RE IN A PINCH AND DON'T HAVE TIME TO MAKE TWICE BAKED POTATOES. I ADDED SOME SPINACH AND HERB SEASONING TO SPICE IT UP A LITTLE.

Salut, nous avons apprécié ceci. Pouvoir de vrai travail de pomme de terre plutôt

(Hi, we enjoyed this. Could real potatoes work instead?)
