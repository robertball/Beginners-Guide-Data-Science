This was the best home-made ice cream I've ever had.  I used skim milk and only 2 cups of strawberries, and it was still delicious!

This is so easy, and if I half it, it's just the right size for our little ice cream freezer.  Our favorite is peach, but we have also tried strawberries and various other fresh fruits.  I like the texture best if I put the fruit in a food processor rather than chop it, but I still leave it a little bit chunky.  It's smoother, and the fruit juice really gets into the mixture this way.

I have been searching for an easy, delicious, and fail-safe ice cream recipe.  I think I've found it. We all devoured it.  I didn't have any fresh strawberries so added 1 tsp mint extract and some shredded chocolate.  It was the best!!  I have a small ice cream maker, so I halved the recipe--still worked great!!!

While I make ice cream often, this is the first time I made it with sweetened condensed milk and with a higher proportion of milk to heavy cream.  It most likely will also be the last time, as the quality of the ice cream suffers for it.  Unlike the fresh dairy taste, richness, creaminess and velvety-smooth mouth feel you get from using using heavy cream and half-and-half or milk, this is more like ice milk and has somewhat of an icy graininess to it by comparison. Also, I found the little frozen chunks of fruit (I used strawberries) and the "canned" taste of the sweetened condensed milk unappealing - and I can think of nothing to support using it. This experiment with making ice cream with the condensed milk proved to me once again that using fresh ingredients is almost always best.

I made a scaled down version of this ice cream (slightly changed the proportions) over the 4th of July weekend and served the fruit over it instead of in it. Very creamy and delicious - a hit with 4 different families so far. Thanks

I had never liked banana ice cream till we made this recipe.  It was delicious, very creamy, not grainy like some homemade ice creams.

I made this recipe with peaches - they were a bit underripe, so it wasn't very fruity.  And I found the sweetened condensed milk flavour overpowering.   Next time I'll try a vanilla recipe and add fruit.

We made this ice cream with fresh from the orchard peaches and it was DELICIOUS!!  I just hope the two quarts we made lasts long enough for my husband to try it when he gets home from work!  This will be our next family reunion ice cream!

It should have called for more fruit.. mine didn't taste especially starwberry-ey.  Possibly the addition of an egg would make it more creamy.

I made strawberry ice cream and it reminded me of Breyers.  I would suggest mixing the ingredients in a bowl and then chill for at least 1 hour (if not 4)before using the ice cream maker.  The cooler you get all tools and ingredients, the less ice crystals you will have leaving you with a creamier product.

This ice cream was absolutely delicious!!  The texture was so creamy and it melted wonderfully in our mouths.  We used blueberries in our ice cream and next time we will make sure to mash the berries first instead of having frozen blueberry balls in our ice cream.  Yummy!

I would give this 10 stars if I could! The whole family LOVED it, the best strawberry ice cream I have ever had! The one thing that I forgot to do that I will do next time is chop up the whole strawberries, otherwise they're just frozen chunks, I did use frozen strawberries by the way. I substituted sugar-free coolwhip for the heavy cream. It turned out really soft and creamy, even after a day of being in the freezer!! Every other ice cream I have ever made turns out pretty hard after being in the freezer. I'm wondering if the cool whip had something to do with that...either way I'm going to keep making it that way!! I like how this recipe didn't call for any extra sugar or egg. Can't wait to try other fruit!

After making this a second time, I had to add one more star to my previous rating.  I used 4 cups of fresh, very ripe peaches from my father-in-law's trees.  I mashed them pretty thoroughly to avoid the icy chunks of fruit I encountered the first time around.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I did sub almost 2 cups of half and half for some of the whole milk, as I needed to use it before it expired.  It was very good the first day, but did get pretty hard in the icebox overnight.  This is pretty typical for homemade ice cream, and I kick myself every time I forget adding a little vodka (or peach schnapps, maybe?) to prevent it.  I just removed the ice cream from the freezer a few minutes before serving.  I'd like a little more peach flavor, so I'll add a little more fruit next time, and maybee a little extra sugar.  I also used one tablespoon of vanilla and one teaspoon of almond flavoring.  The hint of almond was nice, but I might try one and a half tablespoons of vanilla next time.  In summary, this is a very easy recipe that yields pretty good ice cream.  This would be a great choice for anyone new to making ice cream at home.

Our family really enjoys this.  I have only made strawberry so far-I mix all ingredients and with a funnel pour into an milk jug (or pitcher) and place in fridge for the flavors to work together-over nite is great.  I mashed the berries (processor would do the same).  I have a iceless freezer, with 3 canisters- Just take out of fridge, shake well, pour and freeze- a perfect texture everytime.  Letting the flavors come together takes away any of that Sweetened condensed milk flavor.  Great Recipe and will work with so many differnet variations!

If you're going to make this, you better like the taste of sweetened condensed milk because it is really strong in this recipe.  It even overpowered blackberries, which are a very flavorful fruit.  It's also more like ice milk than ice cream.  Maybe needs half and half instead of milk.

Such an easy recipe & the ice cream is wonderful!  Instead of chopping the berries, I pureed them in my blender with a bit of sugar to taste.  Then, instead of large chunks of berries, the flavor spreads throughout.  Delicious!!

This is a fabulous and insanely easy ice cream recipe.  I used strawberries (pureed in the blender) and it turned out so creamy and delicious.  I'm pregnant, so not using eggs was great.  My husband said it was the best homemade ice cream he ever tasted.  Can't wait to try it with peaches, blueberries and other summer fruits.

I did this icecream twice. Taste was great but we did not like texture. First time I followed rec exactly but the mixture did not freeze(we did not mind too much and made some slushies). I thought it is because of strawberries so second time I added them to icecream maker when mixture was already frozen. However icecream still ended up being watery, not creamy enough.

This ice cream was delicious and easy to make. I used bing cherries and almond extract in place of the strawberries and vanilla. Half the recipe is about right for my 1.5 quart ice cream maker. I will definitely make this recipe again.

EXCELLENT!  I was looking for a banana ice cream recipe and you couldn't get more of a banana taste than this.  I substituted 3 bananas for the strawberries and left out the vanilla extract.  Thank you NELL 2 for sharing!

If you use this with peaches, cut back on the vanilla as it overpowers the peaches.  Worked well with blackberries, but may overpower other fruit.  Easy method and I found it fairly creamy.

WOW! Great ice cream recipe. I've got cantaloupes growing all over the place, so I thought cantaloupe ice cream would be an interesting version of this recipe. I chopped the cantaloupe and added 1 cup of skim milk to the blender. It purred up nicely! Since I halved the recipe, I ended up using 5cups (with the 1 cup skim milk included) cantaloupe puree, another 1 cup skim milk, 2 cups heavy cream, 1 tbsp vanilla a pinch of salt and 1 (14oz) can sweetened condensed milk. Made sure it all all blended well and put the mix in my small ice cream maker. 20 mins later we had the most flavorful cantaloupe ice cream! I picked the fruit straight off the vine and within an hour had ice cream. Dang good ice cream, too. WOW.

This was the first time we've made ice cream and it came out really well!  (I scaled it down to 1 quart with no problems.)  I took another reviews advice and put all the ingredients in the food processor.  It was extremely easy and the results were great!  We made strawberry Sunday night and peach last night.  The strawberry was better, but I think that is because the fruit was fresh and my peaches were frozen.  Will use this recipe a lot this summer.  Thanks.

I liked this recipe because it was so much easier than the custard-based ones we usually use -- this took literally two minutes to mix up and toss into the ice cream maker -- and it was really tasty as well.  However, it's not quite as good as the more labor-intensive recipes; leftovers stored in the freezer will be a little grainy.   Two recommendations:  one, half the recipe, because the leftovers don't taste as good as the original portion.  Also, puree or mash your berries instead of chopping them.  As another reviewer pointed out, the texture of the frozen fruit bits is a bit off-putting.  But on the whole this is really worth trying, especially if you want some home-made ice cream at the last minute.

Wow!  ***BUT!***  Know that you can EASILY make or break this ice cream recipe with the quality of the fruit you use!  I highly recommend that you do not use frozen/bagged fruit or imported fruit because the flavor will be SEVERELY lacking.  I used fresh, local, organic, juicy, super sweet and shiny, bright red strawberries-pulsed in the food processor a few times into a pulpy, chunky goodness- and added a touch of sugar, omitted the salt- TRUST ME!  And this came out phenomenal!  S'berry ice cream is hubby's favorite and he LOVED it!  Me too!  Yum!  Thanks for the great strawberry ice cream recipe!  What a winner!!!

I used whole milk (recipe doesn't actually specify fat percentage to use) and this had just the right amount of creaminess for me, not overly rich. I think using anything less than full fat milk would yield an 'icier' texture. I followed the recipe save for pureeing my strawberries instead of chopping them. I made sure to use super ripe, sweet berries. The amount of vanilla extract called for is perfect and added a beautiful element of flavor that matched perfectly with the strawberries.

My whole family really enjoys this recipe.  I have made this 3 times so far, once with raspberries. After we made the strawberry icecream I thought it might be better if the strawberries were mashed a little, although I have not tried this yet, but I will.  I have also tried once using FF half and half in place of the milk and FF sweetened cond. milk, and the heavy cream and no one could tell the difference. I thought it froze well too both ways fine. If you want the taste more like Breyers(which I love), is to heat the milk, take a vanilla bean, slice it open lengthwise, scrap out the inside with a spoon or blunt end of knife, stir it in the milk mixture,then toss the whole bean in the milk, chill.  Before mixing, take out the bean, rinse it, dry it, and you could put in a sugar container for vanilla sugar later for your coffee, tea or use the sugar for cooking. If you do this do not add as much vanilla extract, I only put about half.
  But made just like the recipe states, it is very good, and my family all voted we like this one the best so far out of about 6 recipes.

I substituted pineapple for the berries.  It was easy to make, but not the best ice cream recipe I've used.  The texture was a little bit more icey than creamy.  It was good out of the machine, but didn't freeze well.

Very easy.  But it's more icy than creamy.  If I make this again, I'll try using half-and-half in the place of milk.

I used fresh picked blackberries instead of strawberries and it was amazing.  It turned out really creamy, just the way we like it.  I guess my ice cream maker is on the small side, because this reciped yeilded 3 batches!  I would probably half it next time, but I wouldn't change anything else about it!

Best homemade ice cream ever! The lack of sugar meant no grainy texture that some other recipes have. I halved the recipe to fit the ice cream maker attachment for my Kitchenaid and it was perfect. Will make many, many more times with all kinds of variations!

Great easy recipe that I'll be sure to try again.  Loved the flavour but found the chopped strawberries were too chunky.  I'll either puree them next time, or will simply serve them on the side.

I love that this ice cream doesn't need to be cooked!  I've made it now with strawberry and peach and it's equally delicious and creamy either way.  I like my ice cream more fruit and less cream, so I increased the fruit and decreased the milk, used fat free sweetened condensed milk and it was perfect for our tastes.  Also, when the leftovers (if there are any!) are frozen, the ice cream doesn't thaw from rock hard to soupy like many recipes do, but remains creamy.  I think I've found my new favorite ice cream recipe.

This is just like my Daddy's recipe. I couldn't get him on the phone to get amounts, so here I am. We make ours with mashed bananas. Delicious! I do love the egg/custard ice creams you cook on the stove first, but this one's so much easier and less heavy which is perfect for hot summer days. 
P.S. If you omit the vanilla, you get a "sweet cream" flavored ice cream for those that don't love vanilla. The sweetened condensed milk adds the perfect amount of sugar, so you don't miss the flavoring that much!

Very creamy & delicious!  Just to note:  we didn't have enough fresh strawberries so we used some frozen, too.  The frozen are noticeably "frozen" in the finished product - with the fresh tasting better and having a better texture.

Halved all the ingredients so that this would fit into my ice cream maker.  I used blackberries in place of the strawberries.  First time I have ever used condensed milk to make ice cream, very pleased with the results and love the colour!  I know I will be making this again...

Loved it. I grew up eating homemade raspberry ice cream and have wanted to make ice cream for years with my own family. My mother was not home to give me here recipe so tried ths one. Never made ice cream with sweetened condensed milk but this was great. Made peach ice cream and was worried about it being a little bland from reading other reviews so add a little over 1/8 cup sugar. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it. Thanks

I would have a hard time finding a recipe that was more disappointing, I think.  I am still very upset I wasted my time, ingredients, and all that money! I followed the recipe, exactly, except I wasted some very delicious peaches.  I even used top of the line ingredients!  It was icy, not creamy AT ALL.  Not sweet and the delicious peach flavor was somewhere in there but I couldn't find it.  I have no idea what kind of ice cream everyone else likes but this one produced something that was no where near what I enjoy!

This is a great basic ice cream recipe. I used one 16 oz package of frozen strawberries, thawed and crushed, instead of the fresh. I also wanted to cut back on the fat so I used skim milk and half and half instead of the whole milk and cream, and everyone loved it.  I'm sure that it wasn't as creamy as it would have been otherwise, but it was still delicious!

I made this twice so far , i love recipes that allow for creation a bit . First was with 'Triple Berries " (frozen) , they were raspberries , blueberries and marionberries .They gave the ice cream a wonderful purple color .The second time was with (frozen again ) strawberries , and i added a few drops of red and a drop of blue food dye to give the color . 
Everyone who tasted them loved them , there's only few things i want to say : 
I have the Cuisinart Ice cream maker , 1 1/2 quart , i halved the recipe the first time to fit in it but it was still a little too much mixture for the machine to handle and the berries ( i hadn't chopped throughly because i wanted texture in the ice cream )kind of clogged  it , unfortunately i didn't remember this next time and did the same mistake . So the the walls get frozen but inside isn't churned perfectly . Just a reminder, maybe i should do 1/3 of the recipe next time and chop the fruit throughly .
Also , the batch with strawberries came out better (sweeter and creamier) and i think that's due to the tartness of the other berries maybe ?  
I'm thinking about making this with pie filling as well , (peaches ?) and i will update my review then . 
I agree the texture is more icy then creamy , but i let the ice cream sit on the countertop for 5 mins before serving it , that mostly solves that problem .
And although i half everything else when making it , i keep the berries ( fruit) the same amount and it hasn't hurt the ice cream so far .

This might be a 5-star recipe, but I was forced to make a substitution; our grocery store was out of heavy cream, so I used light cream, half and half and just a little milk. It's a little icy- is this why? The taste is amazing- not too sweet. My husband and I made peach, and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon- really really delicious.

I cut this down to 1/4 of the original quantity to fit my 1.5qt ice cream maker.  I made it with peaches, using 1.5c of fruit and am glad I used more fruit for a more intense flavor; but if I make it again, I'll increase the peaches more and decrease the sweetened condensed milk as it was a little on the sweet side.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Nell!

Wonderful!  Have gotten nothing but wonderful comments about this recipe.  It's even great without any fruit.  Easy as well.  No cooking and no eggs.  I have even made it with skim milk to make it less fattening.

Yummy!  Followed the recipe exactly, using fresh strawberries, and it turned out perfect.  I did mix it all up in the blender, then poured in the ice cream freezer.  Delicious - Thanks for the recipe!

We loved this recipe.  The only changes I made was to put half of the strawberry in the blender with the cream, vanilla and salt.  I also substituted one cup of milk with 1 cup of half & half.  The result was amazing.  I had no problem whatsoever with the ice cream setting.  Great recipe!!!!

This was great!  I cut the recipe in half because I have a small ice cream maker.  I only had 3/4 cup cream, so I made up the difference with 1% milk, and used 1% for the milk in the recipe.  It was a little more like ice milk as a result of the 1%, but I like it that way.  Still creamy enough for me.  I used really ripe strawberries and chopped them really small in the food processor.  So easy and good!

I just bought an ice cream maker and this was the first ice cream I made in it.  I subsituted ripe peaches for the strawberries.  The ice cream was very good and only one dozen people ate the entire gallon!  I can't wait to try it with strawberries or bananas.

This was a great find!  My 7-year-old son and I wanted to make some ice cream together in our electric ice cream maker.  Most of the recipes I had used before involved eggs, double-boilers, and more cooking than I wanted to get into with him "helping" me.  This was the easiest!  We both had a great time.  We used roughly pureed peaches, and 1T almond extract in place of one of the Tablespoons of vanilla extract.  It took a little longer to harden, but it was worth the wait, and was so good!  Great fun to do with him, so we plan on trying new variations together over the summer!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was ok. Next tine I would omit the salt and mascaerate or purée the strawberries first.  The big chunks of strawberry turned into chunks of ice when frozen.

I've been making this recipe for 5 years. It has yet to fail me. I've done many variations including replacing the fruit with girl scout cookies and most recently grapenuts. Every batch is perfectly delicious. Thank you for sharing!

We used peaches and it was really good. Not enough peach flavor though. I would probably double the peaches next time. It might also be good with almond extract.

This turned out so amazing!! Everyone at the 4th of July party I made it for loved it. It was a mixture of frozen yogurt and sorbet. I put mine in the stand mixture to mix the ingredients together before I put it in the ice cream maker and that made the ice cream really creamy. I also will puree 1/2 the strawberries before I put it in. The maker didnt like all the big chunks of strawberries very much and I chopped them up pretty small. Overall a must try recipe!

I used low fat condensed milk; and 1/2 half and half, and 1/2 fat free half and half in place of the milk and cream and it came out great. I also used snickers bars instead of the fruit, (so much for a healthier version) I halved the recipe and it was still too much for my 1 1/2 qt mixer so I used half and saved the rest for tomorrow. I loved it but my FH said a little too sweet and too much vanilla, but again I loved it.

It was an okay recipe... I think next time I'll use a vanilla-flavored ice cream base and then simply add strawberries (or whatever fruit). Mine wasn't very creamy - In fact, after freezing a batch over night, it was rock-solid with what looked like a lot of ice from so much water. Eggs would probably help that. And it wasn't as fruit-y as I wanted. All and all though it wasn't bad.

Fantastic!  And you have so many options!  I first made peach ice cream and tonight I making blueberry.  I put all of the ingredients in my food processor, pulse a couple of times & pour straight into my ice cream maker.  It's so easy that my 8 yr. old can do this with supervision.  Thanks!

FANTASTIC!  I made with chopped cherries (make sure to chop or you will have frozen hard round balls)  Followed the directions exactly but halved the ice cream because there was no way that all the ingredients would fit into my machine.  Can't wait to make again.  Thanks Nell

I loved this recipe! I modified it a bit when I realized that my Ice cream maker couldn't accomodate the portions...I used 2 cans of S/C milk, 2 C Cream, then I chopped some 2 fresh peaches (small dice) and 'cooked' it in Amaretto liquer for about 15 min. and then added it to the mixture! It was a Big Hit!

This recipe is quick, easy and delicious!!  I chopped the strawberries a bit in my food processor so the ice cream would have a smoother quality.  I brought it to a party and everyone raved about it.  I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

this was yummy!  I heated the milk first, then added everything but the strawberries.  I blended the strawberries with about half the mixture to get it nice and smooth (my little boy wanted 'no lumps!'). . . then chilled all before using in my freezer.  We enjoyed and will keep.

Yum, Yum, Yum!  This was such an easy recipe!  I halfed the recipe due to that it really made a lot-now I wished I'd made the entire amount and put it in the freezer for summer!  The only thing I did different in this recipe is took the advice of others: I wanted creamy strawberry and not chuncks in the ice cream, so I put my strawberries in a pot over low heat, added a few tablespoons of sugar and smashed the strawberries with a fork, this made them more pureed and that is what I wanted in my ice cream. It worked great! It was so creamy-thanks for a great recipe that I will for sure make again this summer!

I made this without the fruit, and it was great, but I bet with fruit is good too. Ease of prep and the great flavor makes this my new standard recipe for ice cream!

OMG, this is sooo good. Hubby came home and asked what I did today. Oh, nothing...just made some homemade strawberry ice cream! He loved it, and he doesn't like a lot of sweets. Used fresh strawberries from our garden. Delicious! Will try with peaches next. Really easy, great recipe!

Even though I messed this recipe up, it still turned out wonderful!

I'm new to my ice cream maker and didn't read the directions, so the sweetened condensed milk froze to the bottom instead of mixing with the other ingredients (live and learn!). We scraped out everything we could, added a little more cream, blended it all in the blender and stuck it in the freezer.

It tasted a little more...crystally? than creamy and I imagine that was due to it not having much of the sweetened condensed milk in there.

Even with all that, everyone said that it was the best strawberry ice cream that they've ever had! Even my eldest son...who generally doesn't like strawberry ice cream!

I will definitely be making this again! :)

Excellent homemade ice cream!  One of the best I've tried.  I prefer smooth ice cream to chunky, so I used frozen strawberries and blended them with the milk in the blender until smooth.

This is the easiest and best ice cream recipe I've tried. I used my blender to combine all of the ingredients, but I used cherries instead of strawberries. I only blended those for a little bit at the end, which gave the mixture a great color and still left pieces of cherries in it. I left the mix in the fridge overnight and made the ice-cream the next day. Hubby really like this one as well!

WOW is all I have to say.  I think it is the best strawberry ice cream I have ever tasted.  I cut the recipe in half because I have a small ice cream maker but didn't change anything.  The strawberry flavor is great, I don't think you need any more.  Great, yummy!

My husband said this tasted like Haggen Dazs. Very good. Used peaches. I think something more juicy would be better, like blackberries or strawberries.

I was able to use this recipe with my clients at work.  It was easy and REALLY good.  I also liked the fact that there were no eggs.

I absolutely love this recipe. I have made many variations and all have come out great. I always cut the recipe in half to fit my cuisinart. I have omitted the fruit and used instant espresso powder and mini choc chips. I have also made chocolate by melting a 5 oz bar of dark chocolate and mixing it with the condensed milk before adding the other ingredients. This is a great and easy standard recipe.

I used a fresh picked berry mixture and followed the recipe as written but cut in half. The flavor was amazing! I made it in a Hamilton beach counter model ice cream maker. *I should note this is my first go at making my own ice cream.

As a substitute, I used a many-berry blend of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries from frozen. Put them first through my food processor then the Foley to remove seeds. It was really easy and tasty!

I should have halved this recipe, but didn't. That may have skewed my results, as it didn't set-up well, in my ice cream mixer and took more than 24 hours to freeze.
Once frozen, it was delicious. Next time, I will make half at a time.

Made this today as a full recipe.  Then I poured it in half and made half strawberry ice cream and half butterfinger ice cream.  I did puree the strawberries with a little sugar first.  Came out great!

This is marvelous ice cream!! We halved the recipe for our ice cream freezer and everything worked out perfectly. We used the ice cream attachment for our Kitchen Aid mixer. I love the idea that the sugar in the sweetened condensed milk was all the sugar required for the recipe. Fresh peaches never tasted so good!! Thank you for submitting this recipe.

I think next time I will leave out the salt.  I made it with peaches and did not think salt is a good addition.  I like the recipe otherwise.
