The nutrition info on this cannot be correct.  Only 2.5 grams of protein per serving seems low if you are adding protein powder.  Most powders have at least 20 grams of protein per scoop and this calls for a 1/4 cup.  The eggs alone will give each serving 1 gram or protein.  Thanks for submitting it!

I wrote this recipe. (1) The pancake does not need to be cooked brown for a full 3-4 minutes, just whenever you see bubbles form. (2) Flip and cook only for between 30-60 seconds (or until however brown it gets to your liking). Cooking the other side for another 3-4 minutes will burn the pancake and make it dry and tough rather than soft and moist. (3) Please peel the skin off the potatoes before use!

This batter was basically pure liquid. I had to triple the oats and added some ww flour. They tasted purely like sweet potatoes so I added some cinnamon and vanilla extract. Even after all the additions they were still very soupy but actually able to be made. Will not be making again, although it is a very interesting idea to get your protein. I really wish this had worked better.

Overall, I loved these pancakes. The batter starts out very thin, but add 1/3 cup of flour and it fixes it right away. A dash of cinnamon is a nice addition too.

I really liked this recipe.  Instead of 4 eggs, I use 1/2 cup egg whites and it creates a lower calorie, higher protein pancake. My grandson loves them too. Sometimes I don't even put in the protein powder and the recipe works great.

So good!  I used leftover baby food for the sweet potato.  Much more satisfying than regular pancakes and they taste the same!

I upped the protein to half a cup, and did not use the oatmeal or milk.  Lightly coated my cast iron skillet using  coconut oil.  Yum!

It was far to runny, so then we added some whole wheat flour and baking powder

Love the taste....just takes a long time to cook due to the heavy concentrate of liquids.  Cook on really low heat to avoid burning before it is fully cooked.

This was very good! I used a little soy milk and egg whites, and also added some nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla. Thanks for sharing this.

I just don't like the taste of my husband's vanilla protein powder and that is what came through for me and our kids.  Hopefully my husband will make pancakes in the morning for himself and use up all that batter.  I also put some flour in b/c the pancakes were were thin.
