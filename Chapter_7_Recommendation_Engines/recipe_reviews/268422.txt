Very good!  I will be making this again.  Please make sure you do use the low sodium soy sauce. I used 1/2 aminos and 1/2 regular soy sauce ( did not have enough of aminos for the full amount)...it was still pretty salty.

I didn't make any changes to this recipe but after making it I would.  I liked the pickles very much.  If I make it a second time I think I would double the sauce and remove the cooked ground beef before thickening the sauce as my meat was overcooked by the time the sauce had thickened. Loved the flavor though!

We're not  big fans of traditional sloppy joes but I thought I would give this a try. I reduced the soy sauce a bit and added water to make up the difference since I was concerned it might be too salty. I also skipped the sriracha in the quick pickles and added a sliced jalapeno instead.   We really enjoyed it. Hubby told me to not lose  this recipe which is high praise from him.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks Nicole.

Nice change of taste! I made it  exactly to the recipe & wouldn't change a thing.
