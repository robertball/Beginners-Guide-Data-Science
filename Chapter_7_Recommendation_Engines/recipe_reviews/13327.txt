Delicious! Perfect for cold winter nights with hot buttered bread.  The "homemade noodles" just didn't work for me, so I ended up boiling some egg noodles and adding them instead.  I used steam in bag baby carrots and chopped celery along with the chopped onion. Instead of water, I used all chicken broth and this turned out to be very good.

The soup was wonderful, but my cheese dumplings did not turn out. Next time I think I'll make some sort of pasta to drop in instead. My kids loved the flavor, and it was easy to put it on in the morning and have it ready in the evening.

I honestly try to make the recipe as close as possible to the way it's written when I'm rating it.  I really hate when people make all types of adjustments then rate a recipe low...what are you really rating then!?!?  Anyway, I did not have celery and I used fresh baby carrots instead of frozen other than that, I followed everything else exact on the ingredients list.  The "drop in" noodles are more like dumplings so I made mine much bigger than pea-size to represent more of a dumpling than a noodle.  I also cooked the dumplings in some broth I stole from the slow cooker and boiled instead of in boiling then dumpped it all back in the slow cooker.  I think it gave a bit more flavor to the "noodles" a.k.a dumplings.  Over all I though this was pretty good and would definitly use it again.

I may have given this soup 3 stars if it wasn't for the "noodles."  They didn't work at all.  The mixture quickly turned to a dough and had to be rolled and cut to be salvaged.  My husband said they added a different texture to the soup, but nothing more.  The dogs ate the rest of the noodles and I will add some boxed pasta to the soup.  If salt if the taste you want, then this is the recipe for you.  I omitted the bouillon and used reduced salt canned broth for all the liquid.  Even so there wasn't much flavor other than salt.

Marvelous! I love homemade noodles and dumplings.  It can be a bit tricky working with the dough.  If you don't get the pea sized bits with this recipe, I think you need to add a bit more flour - and if you do find yourself having to roll the dough out even then.  Just cut long strips, let dry and wallah! you have homemade pasta for the next time.  This recipe is just lovely, its comforting and home-y. The taste is heavenly, simple flavors for comfort and not what I would call bland besides, you can always punch it up a bit for different tastes.

Just wanted the noodles - what a huge FAIL.  I ended up using 4 eggs & 5 or 6 Tbl. milk.  my "noodles " ended up like dumplings.
