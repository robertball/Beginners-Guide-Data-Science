For those who have burned out all the taste buds on very spicey recipies, this recipe is not for you....for those who want an excellent soup for those chilly fall and winter nights this is it. I doubled the recipe, and used one can of diced italian flavored tomatoes, and one can of the reg. type.  I also added some chopped celery.  The ham bone was quite meaty.  This soup was so good I didn't even need to add any salt or pepper!!   Jerri

Yummy!! Perfect for busy moms. Great way to stretch that left over ham. I added some carrots & potato in stead of just potato. The Tomato add a perfect flavor. I used reg canned chick broth, my ham & ham bone was a hillshire farm and those never seemed to be as salty to me.  I also used garlic and bayleaf. No green pepper on hand but I am sure it would taste even better with green pepper. We had french bread with it.  It was hit and I have 6 kids that loved it. Thank You!! Will be passed down to generations.

I used this recipe for a nice, meaty ham bone I had left over from a Hillshire Farms spiral ham. It was very easy and delicious.  I only had a large sweet potato on hand so used that instead of the potatoes and it really added a wonderful flavor.  Also added an extra can of beans (pinto), a couple of bay leaves, some garlic powder, and a touch of Golden Sherry toward the end. Wonderful soup!

AWESOME. I used a really meaty ham bone for this soup. I added chopped carrots, celery and a can of green peas in addition to everything else the recipe called for. After reading the reviews I opted for low sodium chicken bouillon. The soup was seasoned perfectly. I had to cook the soup longer because of my additions... overall I cooked it for about 8-9 hours on low. Absolutely fabulous! 12/09: I actually bought and baked a ham yesterday solely so that I could make this soup with the leftover ham bone today (although the ham was delicious, I was really craving this soup)!

OK, I gotta story.  Anyone who is familiar with the show "Everybody Loves Raymond" can surely appreciate this because with the exception of my in-laws living 5 minutes away & not across the street.....they ARE Frank & Marie, and hubby & I are Ray & Debra.  I'm not at all kidding, really.  The in-laws called last night 4 TIMES, not leaving a message, and then came over to give me a.....yes a ham bone.  Not only did I think the worst, as my husband is (again) in Monterey on business, but..it was just a hambone.  Anyway, I was able to make the soup with it, and it turned out pretty good.  I subbed green beans for the peppers, and if I make it again, I will add some sort of pasta.  Nice & low cal.  Thanks Charlene.  If ever you get a chance to see the show...do, you'll get a peek into my life (HA) ;)

This recipe was AWESOME!  I didn't have a slow cooker, so I just put everything into a 12 quart soup pot and brought it to a boil.  Then I reduced it to low and simmered for about 4 hours, stirring occasionally.  The ham just fell off of the bone!  I modified slightly, 4 boullion instead of 6, and 5 cups of water.  I also added some diced leftover ham that was in the fridge.  I sent this recipe to everyone. Yum!

To those who referred to the salt content, that is going to happen since it's ham. I would suggest using chicken broth instead of bullion. However, I think if I decide to make this, I will be sure to use twice as much water as broth I use. I don't worry about it being watered down too much as there will be plenty of flavor from the broth and ham combination.

This is one of the easiest soup recipes I have ever tried. The family loved it and I now have another wintry night soup. Very hearty and tasty. Would highly recommend to friends.

My family really enjoyed this soup. I added cubed ham, used 4 c. of low-sodium chicken broth & added one cube of bouillon....it wasn't too salty.  I had a bit of celery on hand so I threw that in & then I also added a 1/2 can of sliced carrots, I also added a couple of cloves of minced garlic, as well as two bay leaves. The soup was very hearty...more like a stew really. I served it w/ homemade bread & it was a wonderful filling meal for a cold winter day.

Excellent soup.  I used crushed tomatoes instead and omitted the peppers and beans.  This was still a great tasting soup and perfect for that left over ham!  Thanks!

As is, the recipe was a 4 star - yummy and easy to fix.  To turn it into a 5 star for my family's tastes, I deleted the green pepper and used canned tomato's that included them.  Added some garlic, a few red pepper flakes, salt free seasoning, and some cubed carrots. used canned broth rather than cubes, and as I had cooked my own ham, could stir in 1/2 cup or so of the juices.  Bought Applewood Smoked Half Ham at Costco - delish and not too salty. Thanks for posting this - family enjoyed it and will make it often this winter. I encourage new cooks to use this as a base, and add spices or vegetables that your family will enjoy.  Making recipes your own is what makes a great cook, and is half the fun of cooking!

I made this with a bone from a ham that my husband smoked.  I made a few substitutions based on what I had - minced carrots for the peppers, pinto beans for kidney beans.  Also added - 2 bay leaves, minced garlic, a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, & extra pieces of leftover ham.

I was not immediately impressed when it was time to eat (it seemed too watery), but my husband dove in & he enjoyed it.  I left the lid off the crock pot & let it cook it down a little, & found that I liked the texture much better.  It's more like stew now.

For us, adding the extra ham was essential.  We'll freeze some now & I'm sure we'll have it again (we've always got a ham bone).  Thanks for the recipe!

I was very skeptical about this recipe, sounded too simple to waste my nice meaty ham bone on.  But it was delicious!  I omitted the green pepper and added carrots and celery.  I used a can of cannellini beans instead.  The leftovers have been great for lunch!  I'll definitely made this again when I have my next ham bone to use!

I just signed up to be a member or else I would of rated this before. I love this soup and have made it for about 5yrs. I save my hambone fron each  holiday and use it in this recipe. The only subtitutions that I make is I add cabbage at the end of cooking and let it get nice and soft! Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome soup/stew! Substituted/added some things per some of the other reviewers suggestions and some of my own. Substituted the following: Italian seasoned diced tomatoes for reg. diced tomatoes, canned pinto beans instead of kidney beans, yellow potatoes for the potatoes and diced instead of cubed, 4 cups of chicken broth instead of water/bouillon cubes (no msg that way), 1/3 each of yellow, orange, and red bell pepper instead of the green bell pepper and also diced. Added the following: 2 bay leaves, garlic powder, white pepper, salt, and sugar to taste( only about 3 teaspoons of sugar). Also added mashed potato flakes at the very end to thicken it per the request of my family. They like stews better than soups. The result was wonderful! Everyone like it, even my husband who lately has been adding hot sauce to everything for extra flavor. Also all the kids ( 4 of them) even the ones who won't touch veggies with a ten foot pole! Thanks for a great recipe and thank you other reviewers for all the suggestions.

Warm, hearty, and delicious. Will make again next time I have a ham bone.. nothing quite like the flavor. I made this in the crock pot while I was at work (10 hours), but this apparently gets better the longer it cooks.

This soup has excellent flavor. I had to stretch it for unexpected guests so I added 2 cups of vegetable stock. It was a good addition. I only used 4 cubes chicken bouillon as I thought it would be too salty with 6.I also used black beans instead of kidney beans only because I had to use up the black beans. When I make this soup again I will make this substitution as the black beans were a bit smaller than kidney beans with a better taste. (Personal preference)I cooked it in the slow cooker for 8 hours and cooked the pasta a bit in a separate pot. Then added the pasta at the end for about 1 hour. The pasta swelled up a bit too much so be sure to add it only at the end. It was like minestrone. I have been looking for a good ham bone soup and I found one with this recipe. This soup is very forgiving as you can add any kind of vegetables you like and add or omit the pasta. I don't usually like to rate a recipe that I made changes to. It bugs me when the recipe is changed and then rated but I think this recipe would be good without my changes. Thanks for sharing.

Cooked in my slow cooker for about 4 hours on low, I ommitted the green bell pepper, only used half of the can of tomatoes and added barley, along with various pre-packaged soup greens (a leek, fresh parsley and a celery root). I also used chicken broth instead of bullion cubes. I will definitely make this again. SO GOOD! Very hearty and great with crackers on the side.

My family and I love this soup!  Now when we have it, I  make it the day before.  I leave it in the fridge (in the large pot) overnight.  Chilling it brings the fat from the ham bone to the top.  I scrape that off and then re-heat the soup on the stove top.  Yummy!

This was a really, really nice soup.  The only thing I did different was use carrots instead of peppers and I added about 1/3 cup rice during the last hour of cooking.  I also cooked it on Low right from the start....at total of about 10 hours.  Next time I'll add 5 bouillon cubes instead of 6.  The house smelled amazing and everyone gobbled up the soup.  Delicious!  Thank you very much!

For a fairly basic soup, I thought this was very flavorful.  I subbed chick peas for the kidney beans and added corn and celery.  I might have added another can of tomatoes in retrospect.  Also, when I first cooked it, the fat from the ham bone left a thick layer of oil on the top which kind of bothered me.  After I refrigerated the leftovers overnight, that layer solidified and I was able to pull it off and pretty much get rid of all the fat.  Peeling it off was kind of gross but I'm better off with it in the trash than on my hips.

Yahoo! I've been looking for an alternative to lima beans and ham for my leftover ham bone and this is it! Delicious, nutritious and very easy to make. I hardly changed a thing. I just added a couple of carrots and used chicken broth since that's what I had. Like other reviewers I also added a bay leaf and one whole garlic clove. The broth in this soup was wonderful. Very filling and perfect for a cold winter's night to warm the family. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great soup!  A wonderful change of pace and great use for ham bones.  I used tomato sauce instead of chunks as my family prefers no pieces of tomato.  Really good & easy! I've already made it several times.

This is by far one of the best ways to use up that leftover ham!  It's very easy to do and flavorful.  I have made it several times and my family of four really enjoy it!

I made the soup according to the recipe except that I used grandulated bouillon instead of cubes, 1 teaspoon = 1 cube.  It was so salty we couldn't eat it.  I removed about 3 cups of broth from the soup and replaced them with 3 cups of water and it was edible but still a bit salty.  If I made this again, I would use just half of the bouillon, then taste, and then add more if needed.

This is a great starter base.  My changes wer're I used 2 cans of organic fire roasted tomatos, no potatoes, no green bell pepper, 4 cups of chicken stock and 4 cups of water, added celery.  Left it on high for most of the day.  1 1/2 before we ate I added carrots and 3/4 cup of barley.  OMG was it delicious!  Having left overs tonight.  Thank you so much for the starter.

This was good, but I like vegetables and lots of ham in my soup. I use 3 large cans of crushed tomatoes with 5 cans water. I Add a large bag of mixed vegetables just before done I add 1-1/2 cups of elbow noodles. Yum......it goes along way.

This soup is absolutly fabulous!  I made it on the stove.  It took only about 2 hours cooking time this way, and was still great!

I bought a pack of ham bones the other day and needed to do something with them and of course I came here. Didn't really care to much for the taste.  I guess I'm not much of a ham person, but my company really enjoyed it.  Thanks anyway.

DELICIOUS!  Perfect meal when the ham is almost gone.  My toddler who rarely eats dinner was asking for fourths, and my husband was getting concerned there wouldn't be enough for leftovers!  I didn't do bell peppers (I don't like them) and instead added carrots and celery.  I used preseasoned tomatoes (it had parsley, oregano and a few other spices already in it, I believe it was the 'O' Organics brand from Safeway).  It turned out amazing!

Good recipe.  I agree with other reviewers when it comes to adding different veggies.  I added celery, and a partial can of corn that needed to be used up.  I recommend removing the bone after cooking, and allowing the soup to cool so that you can skim off some of the fat.  My ham bone must have been pretty fatty, because I was able to remove 1/2 cup of fat after cooling.

My husband and I normally disagree when cooking soups.  I like broth with chunks.  He likes smooth puree-type soups.  I like 2-3 ingredients plus flavorings.  He likes throwing everything possible into his.  So I didn't think we would ever find a recipe that we both loved.  But this was definately a winner.  Even our 3 kids, who don't normally like soups ate this.  I made the recipe exactly (I always try a recipe straight the first time and then make any needed changes the next time) and it was terrific.  Although I may try adding a few more veggies next (for my kids' benefit), no changes are actually needed for the recipe.  Very tasty!

A delicious way to utilize that ham bone! I hate split pea soup, and when I saw this recipe, I had to try it.  I have made it a few times, each time a little differently.  But I would agree with the others who said to use low-sodium bouillon.  Any more salt would be too much.  I had quite a bit of ham left on the bone and after slow cooking all day, it just fell off and was so tasty.  I added a can of mixed veggies instead of the beans. And I just used one large potato.  My kids even liked it, and they aren't big soup eaters.  Will make again every time I have a ham bone leftover!

Tasted like something very familiar... and it took us the whole meal to figure it out.  Campbell's Vegetable Soup!!!  With kidney beans.  A lot of chopping when I could have just opened a can.  Used 3 bouillon cubes and added sliced carrots.

I don't like chunky tomatos in my soups so I just used half a can of tomato sauce. I'm pleased with the substitution. Also, rather than cutting up carrots, I just threw in half a bag of sucatash (peas, corn, carrots, greenbeans) and that made it so tasty and colorful. I think kidney beans give the right flavor for this soup. It is a little on the salty side. Either use no-sodium chicken boullion, or cut it down to half the amount, perhaps even less. I needed to pour in extra water after a while or else it would have become really mushy. This is a hearty meal and I'll definately be making it again the next time we're left with a hambone.

This recipe is a great starting point and the perfect "leftovers" soup!  We made quite a few modifications from the original recipe (mostly due to what ingredients we had on hand).  We used the ham bone from Christmas, added some carrots, only 3 little red potatoes (that was all we had left after the holiday!), celery, green onions, 1 shallot, a cup of Uncle Bens, some garlic, black pepper, and green beans.  We didn't have any diced tomatoes or kidney beans in the pantry so we left those ingredients out.  We also used canned chicken broth (5 regular sized cans because the rice soaked up some liquid to cook).  The rice really added some "meat" to the soup.  Just like most other reviews said, don't add any salt - there is plenty!

I got a late start & didn't have time to do in the crockpot.  Worked fine on the stove.  I used a ham hock which is what I had on hand.  I meant to use chicken broth as reviews said but forgot to buy it so I used the water & chicken bouillon cubes.  I added thin sliced carrots, celery, garlic 2 bay leaves & a couple shakes of red pepper flakes + 2 tsp. of sugar as suggested by other reviews.  I sauted the onion, carrots, celery & garlic a little in the pot with the canned tomatoes then added all but the potatoes and brought to a boil.  I used 2 cups of diced ham I had in the freezer to use up.  I simmered it for 1 hour then added the cubed potatoes and brought to a boil again.  Since it had cooked down some I added a can of veggie broth I had in the cabinet & gently boiled for 1/2 hour then turned off & let sit till dinner time.  Hubby loved it & it was SO easy to throw together.

Thank you TootSweet13 for an awesome recipe! With the exception of adding a bayleaf and using low-sodium/no MSG chicken broth I followed the recipe as written. I was nervous since my hambone was from a HoneyBaked Ham (thought maybe any remaining glaze would interfer) but no need to worry. This was the BEST ham soup I've ever made!

The ham bone put 2 large bones and several smaller bones in the soup, along with gristle and fat.  It was tedious getting this all out and I was afraid someone would discover a missed piece of bone/gristle/fat.  The taste was good, however. My ham was a spiral cut, high end ham.  I must of used a different kind of ham than everyone else!

I've never cooked a spiral ham before, but there was so much meat on the bone I had to try to make something with it.  This is a great recipe - very simple, using items easily on hand.  I made a few minor modifications - added carrots and red bell pepper, reduced number of potatoes to one large one and added two cloves of minced garlic and a little crushed red pepper to spice it up.  It ended up being kind of a soupy chili - really, really great for a cold wintry day. I wish they would change the picture on this one, though ... mine didn't look anything like that!!

I was afraid the simplicity of this recipe would make it dull but on the contrary, it's fantastic!  Doesn't need herbs and spices because of the wonderful smoky flavor from the ham.  I left out the green pepper.  Had to substitute beef boullion for chicken.  This was really hearty.  Got thicker and better after being in the frig a couple days.  Didn't know if the beans were supposed to be drained first - I did not drain them - put entire can and liquids in slow cooker.  The ham bone I used was from a spiral cut ham with just a little meat left.

This is a favorite recipe with a regular baked ham bone, but we hated it when I tried it with a bone from a smoked ham. It gives it a totally different taste.  Also, it's quite salty so I always use less bouillon cubes.  Awesome served with crusty bread, ceasar salad, and sweet tea.  YUMMY.

Great recipe! I added lots of cayenne pepper to give it a little kick, and substituted the bell pepper for a small can of diced green chilis.  I recommend a less starchy potato for a smoother taste.

Just made this great soup yesterday with a leftover spiral ham, lots of meat on it. I noted that the ingredients as listed may have turned out a little bland so I added some garlic, lots of pepper, a can of mild chile peppers and some cayenne pepper along with some hot pepper flakes. Cooked it for the full 6 hours and the aroma was heavenly!
My wife and I really loved it and look forward to the frozen remains.

I almost threw out the Christmas ham bone, then I decided to look for a suitable recipe for it.  This is it!  I was pressed for time, so I cooked this on top of the stove for about an hour or less. I added fresh chopped carrots and celery and a bit of garlic powder and black pepper, and a can of corn. I didn't have kidney beans, so I used a can of Great Northern Beans.  Don't add any salt, it's just perfect the way it is. Wonderful flavorful soup!
I will most definitely make this again.

This soup got rave reviews from everyone who had it. The only change I made was that I used "Italian Style" diced tomatoes. Absolutely wonderful.

I followed this recipe except I subsituted a can of pinto beans because I had them on hand.  The soup turned out delicious but second day, was much too salty!  I do not know what caused this, because I did not add any condiments to the original recipe.  I can only blame it on using the six bullion cubes which I think may have contributed to the saltiness.  I will try this recipe again, but may just used a can of low salt chicken broth instead of the cubes.  If anyone else has had a problem with this, I would like to know their "cure"!

Fantastic! what more can I say. My 6 and 11 year old grandchildren are not soup eaters. When I told them this was all I made they tried it,  said nothing while they pouted, 
  BUT ASKED for SECONDS  I think that says it all.  I used only chicken stock instead of water added sweet potatoes and celery along with everything else. Deboned the soup once it was done and served with French bread.

This soup was so delicious and simple to make. I almost gave it four stars because it seemed like one onion was so much that it seemed to take over the pot and after the soup was done I took out half the onion and threw it away so that it wouldn't look like onion soup. I also changed it up a bit by adding two more cans of beans, pinto & white, added ham, and more broth. Wonderful recipe to go off of.

Ok, I feel like I figured this thing out. First, the cook time totally varies. If you don't cook it long enough, it is going to be way to watery and not as flavorful at all. Although 5-6 hours was plenty for others, I doubled the recipe and after 8 hrs on high in the crock pot it was still not cooked all the way. A little time on the stove -brought to a boil and then simmered and it thickened WAY up - made it go from 2 stars to 4+ stars. I also think how salty your ham is has a lot to do with the outcome. If you find (only after you cook it ALL the way) that it is not flavorful enough, just add some salt! I added salt before it was done all the way and I probably over did it, but I still got rave reviews. I totally understand the low ratings as well as the high ratings. Before I simmered it on the stove, I was really disappointed in this soup. Afterwards... DELISH. Gave 4 stars because it was so finicky with the cook time, but end result was 5 stars.

Made this yesterday, but added black pepper to taste, bay leave and omitted kidney beans and replaced with split peas and white beans.  Kids LOVED it.  It's been -30 or colder here.  The warm soup hit the spot.Thanks

I made this soup  5 months ago and for Easter I made an extra ham just for the bone to make this again.  I did change it a bit.  Used stewed tomatoes, added a can of chipotle pinto beans and then when it was all done I added diced cabbage into it.  The cabbage made a big difference.  This time I am going to add in baby carrots.  Can't wait!

I didn't have a ham bone, but I have tons of leftover ham.  So, I threw in a huge chunk (had to be at least 1 lb).  I used black beans because I like them better and was out of kidney beans anyway.  My 7yo said this soup is amazing...keeper!

It was good. Good flavor and a good way to use up the bone. Nothing to get too excited about, however.

This was ok.  I added carrots, garlic powder, and bay leaf.  Drained and rinsed the beans.
ETA  Just had leftovers and like many crock recipes, it was much better the second time around!  Also I cooked on low 7 hrs

this is a great base for almost any variation of soup with ingredients you may have on hand.  i used chicken stock instead of bouillon cubes and since i had saved ham drippings from my baked ham, i added that as well with extra water to taste.  i also used garbanzo instead of kidney (what i had) and a  bag of fresh spinach i had on hand.  for seasoning, all it needed was ground pepper. i cooked everything in a pressure cooker for an hour except the potatoes, garbanzos, and spinach which i added not under pressure to watch for doneness of added ingredients.  a delicious hearty soup that clearly does not resemble anything 'left over'

WOW!  This is Great!  I only omitted the green peppers.  No seasoning added which was just amazing to me.  Even my picky husband loved it!  I'll make this from now on with my ham bone.  It's way better than split pea soup.  Thank you so much for the fantastic recipe.

I do not use a crock pot so just made it on the stove.  I also added garlic and a bay leaf, carrots and celery.  Next time may add even more veggies, such as corn and green beans.  It really was delicious, a nice blend of flavors.

This was okay.  I added the chicken broth instead of the bouillon.....I think maybe next time I'd omit, or add less tomato, and add carrots and maybe some split peas.

Loved, loved, loved this soup!  I made a few changes...I used frozen mixed veggies (carrots, corn and green beans), a little celery, green and red pepper (because I had them), two bay leaves and very little onion.  I had some leftover ham, also.  During the last thirty minutes of cooking, I threw in some very small alphabet noodles.  I thought that it come out wonderfully and will definitely make it again.

This was a great soup.  We added some spices (to taste) as we felt it needed an 'earthy" element and was way too sweet from our ham bone.  We added some tyme, red pepper, oregano, black pepper, 1/4 can peeled tomato, marjorum and parsley.  We used a bone from a honey glazed ham and when i first tasted it, it was way too sweet so that is why I added the "earthy" spices.  That evened it out and was GREAT.

very EASY and tasty soup. I was on the fence about this one after reading the reviews but it's great as is and with additions. Today I threw it together quickly and left w/o even stirring it. I added carrots, didn't have enough onion and used honey baked ham bone plus leftover ham. It's perfectly sweet and a perfect winter soup. I might add cheese to one bowl and try to make it creamy and thick next time.

I've never been much of a soup person, but we had ham for Christmas and I thought that making soup with the bone could be fun to try. I made as directed, except that I omitted the green pepper as I didn't have any, used 5 cups of broth instead of bouillon/water and I also added carrots, celery, garlic and an additional can of beans (pinto, for variety). It was absolutely delicious!! My husband can't seem to get enough of it and I've gotta admit that I like it too. :) I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for a way to not have to waste a ham bone and want something you can throw together in a crock pot and come home to a delicious, hearty, home cooked meal! :)

I have to give this a 5, it was really good, albeit I don't care much for tomatoes in my soup. Next time I'll add more ham, there wasn't a lot on the bone. I also used 4 cups of chicken broth instead of the bouillon, I didn't have any. Will definitely make this one again, it was very good and simple.

Excellent soup!  The tomatoes add a nice flavor to the soup.  My only substitution was that I used canned Northern beans instead of the kidney beans, because that was what I had on hand.

This was a tasty, hearty soup. However, it was a little tangy for our taste. Maybe the tomato base. Gave some to my neighbors along w/the recipe and they've made it once or twice since then and love it. May try a little variation next time w/out all the tomato, but still a good recipe when you don't know what to do w/a leftover ham bone.

Tomato based soup is usually not a favorite of mine, but I may need to change my mind. This is a great basic soup recipe that is VERY forgiving - allowing you to alter according to what is in your pantry/frig. 

This became an everything but the kitchen sink ham bone soup... because I used everything but the kitchen sink and it came out great.  

My crockpot (1.5 Qt) was filled with: 
the last three Yukon Gold potatos, a small four ounce can of low sodium  mushrooms, low sodium blackeye peas, 8 oz tomato sauce, 14 oz. italian stewed tomatoes, low sodium chicken broth, fresh parsley, my last onion, two bay leaves, and a very lean ham bone (hubby had already picked it clean) and one cup white wine. 

Awesome. It wasn't salty and had a nice rich flavor. Thanks for sharing!

I do not like beans, but had a ham bone left and didn't want to waste it so I tried this recipe. It was surprisingly good but very salty. However, the salt was manageable. I did not cook it in a crock pot, but in a pot on the stove. It didn’t take long, only about 30 minutes until the potatoes were done so I had to turn the heat way down until we were ready to eat. I also used canned northern beans instead of kidney because I don’t like the texture of kidney beans but found that the toughness of the kidney bean is needed since the soup boils so long to get the flavor of the bone out.

Great recipe! I followed it exactly except used low sodium chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water.  I will now make this every time I have a left over ham bone rather than the old ham and beans.

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!  I boiled the ham bone while cutting veggies, for about 30-45 minutes in the the water w/ chicken and beef buillon cubes.  I then placed all in crockpot on high for 2 hours and low for 4 hours.  For low carb alternative, I added parsnips and turnips in place of potatoes.  EXCELLENT!!!

Really yummy!  I left out the beans 'cause we don't like them.  Added a few more veggies like corn and then some rice.  Really tasty with cornbread.

This soup was great. I agree with other reviewers that it could use a low-sodium boullion. It was pretty salty. I added zucchini and carrots too- yum!

Loved it! Toward the end I added 1/2 cup of barley to thicken it up some -- WOW! Next time I will leave the potatoes out and just do barley, not that the potatoes were bad, just really liked the barley.

As is, this is a great soup base. I found it needed more veggies and broth for my taste. I added corn, green beans, and carrots and could have added more. I also added a tbsp. of minced garlic. I used a leftover picnic shoulder roast, which gave it great flavor.

This turned out fabulous. I made this with the leftover ham bone from Thanksgiving.  However, I did make a few tweaks: I added diced carrots and celery; added plenty of fresh ground black pepper; added a couple dashes of cayenne pepper for a bit of spice; added 2 bay leaves; and used white beans instead of red.  My husband loved it and it's something I will be making again in the future.

What a great recipe for after the holidays!  I used a can of Rotelle with green chilies rather than the can of tomatoes and it added a little spice.  I think you could double up on the kidney beans as well.  At any rate, a great soup recipe that I will be using again and again.

This was a great alternative to making lentil soup which is what I always made with the left over ham and bone. Great flavor too! I froze the left overs in small portions to have later and it tasted just as yummy!!

I rated it highly for easy preparation and delicious GF soup.  I put in drained can of black-eyed peas because I didn't have kidney beans and threw in fresh basil chiffonade and fresh oregano because I grow these.  Also added about a tsp garlic salt.  I used 1 qt plus one can chicken stock and not the water and bouillon.  This is a good fit for this first chilly day in the Detroit area.  Thank you, this is one of the best uses for a ham bone I have run across.

Yummy!  Changed a few things:  Sweet potatoes instead of regular.  Red bell pepper instead of green.  Used "italian seasoned canned tomatoes" instead of regular. Also used low sodium chicken broth.  Everyone loved it.  Could not believe how much flavor it had despite have so few spices/herbs.

Omg. I slow cooked this recipe with a left over bone in ham I bought and made the night before.
I make alot of soups, and I mean ALOT... but every one of my kids said this was their absolute favorite of any soup I've ever made. Only changes I made was instead of cubing up my potatoes,  I just added the leftover mashed potatoes I had from the ham dinner. It gave it a really nice texture. And I added some small pasta shells at the end to absorb some of the liquid.

As everyone else does...I improvised. I call this the "left over soup". I used my ham bone, onion, carrot, celery, salt, pepper, 2 cans of diced tomatoes (one Italian style) kidney beans, peas...you can use what ever you have! Remember to not season your vegetables during the week...only on your plate. Then at the end of the week, use them up for soup! My cost on this 10 cup meal: $4.00 and a left over ham bone.....feeds 6 easily

My dear husband loves soups, chowders and stews! He absolutely loves them and is quite the connoisseur! I made this soup today for the very first time (exactly as shown) and he could hardly stop raving and singing its praises long enough to eat it! :) Can't remember the last time I've had that many compliments on a meal!!! Three thumbs up and 5 big stars! Thank you so much for sharing!

No longer a skeptic this soup is great in spite of my worries of possible ingredient compatibilities.I cooked it for 8 1/2hours[the big ham bone was frozen]and made it as stated with the exception of a little cayenne pepper to taste and 2 bay leaves. I will not be throwing out the ham bone any longer---thanks for a great tasting soup.

This was the first time I've ever made ham soup and it was SO good!  Sounded like it might be bland, but it wasn't.  It did not need any seasoning at all!  I omitted the green pepper because I didn't have one, and added some sliced carrots.  Used no-salt bouillon which worked perfectly since ham is salty already.  Hubby really enjoyed it too and he's not a big ham fan.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing!

I made one significant change. Left out the beans and potatoes and put in 2 cups of cubed butternut squash. Cooked for 15 hours and is had the most major balance of sweet and savory!!

I made this soup in my slow cooker, and after 6 hours the potatoes and other vegetables were still crunchy.   I took the soup out of the cooker and put it in a soup pot on the stove and simmered it on medium high to soften.   After ten  minutes soup was finally ready to eat.    The soup was very good but next time,  it will be done on the stove.

This is soooo GOOD! Definitely hits the "soup" spot! I din't use the chicken cubes. I added celery and garlic both fresh. And I seasoned it with "salad supreme" seasoning, found at publix. Absolutely delicious! And I'm not sure if this made a difference, but I used the ham bone from a ham covered in spicy honey glaze.

This was soup was OK.  I followed the recipe and my instincts told me to omit the green pepper, that it would cook too long and be bitter.  So I added it with about an hour left but I should have left it out altogether.  It was bitter.  
Our family of five all agreed: this soup was average and kinda boring.

Love this recipe! It reminds me of mom's soup when I was a kid. The only thing I do different is add extra kidney beans, some green beans and some diced ham to add some more meat to the soup.

WOW! I made this as written, except doubled (I had a huge, meaty ham bone left over from Christmas) and simmered all day on the stove. I wasn't sure what to expect with the simple ingredients and lack of spices, but it was WONDERFUL! My husband and I had two huge bowls apiece and have decided this will be our traditional New Year's meal from now on. FANTASTIC!! don't change a thing!

Yummy! I though this was super good and really easy to make. Used the leftover ham bone from Christmas. Added 3 chopped carrots, a clove of garlic and a bay leaf as suggested.  Ate with some whole wheat bread. The whole family enjoyed it.  Thanks! :O)

I did not care for this recipe at all. I am not sure how to say this, but the first thing was the actual aroma/smell.  It was very unappealing.  My husband is very versatile and likes almost everything I cook.  He did not like the flavor at all.  Did we use the wrong type of ham bone?  It was a publix brand ham that was excellent.  I guess that I think something is wrong with me since I really couldn't stand this recipe.  All the other reviews were just fantastic and I was really excited to make this one.  Complete disappointment.  Will not make again.

Very tasty soup- I omitted the kidney beans and green peppers. I added green beans, peas, carrotts, mushrooms, and then two hours before we ate I added some pasta noodles to it.  I also added fresh parsley, and dried basil, thyme, sage, and pepper.  Very good!  The best compliment a Mom can get is seconds, thirds, and empty bowls:)

Our family is trying to go vegetarian but occassionaly I see an easy receipe and I can't resist.  I sauted the onion in fresh garlic along with all the other veggies, potatoes, green beans, 3 carrots, and green pepper.  I did not have kidney beans but I did have black eyes peas.  Also threw in a bay leaf.  This was really, really good except for the fact that the ham bone added more fat than we are used to.  Next time I make this I am going to try and find a dry ham flavoring of some type to use instead of the greasy ham bone.  I did try and spoon some of the grease off the top.

Added some finely chopped carrots, used white kidney beans which I rinsed first. I truly had an awesome ham bone and the ham wasn't salty at all.
Even BETTER the next day!!!

Wonderful--Economical! Will make it EVERYTIME I have a ham bone (or will at least freeze the bone to make it at a later date--seriously, it was soooo rich and good!) Used a natural, nitrate/nitrite free ham from Trader Joe's! The changes I made: used a can of pinto beans and a can of black beans, omitted potatoes because we love to eat chunky soups over brown rice, used a quart of my tomato puree instead of the canned stuff and used homemade chicken broth instead of bouillion.

I just finished making and eating this soup, and man was it tasty!  If you are not a 9 bean soup person like myself, I would reccomend this recipe.  My husband loved it too.  The only thing I did different was add carrots, and instead of cutting up green pepper I bought canned tomatoes with green pepper already in it.  I also put garlic powder and fresh ground pepper in it.  It absolutely does not need additional salt, the ham provided just the right amount to the broth.  We will now make this soup with every ham bone.

This soup was excellent!! Instead of boullion and water I used 3 reg cans low sodium chicken broth and added a couple bay leaves and garlic as suggested in other reviews.  My husband wanted more beans, so we will do an additional can next time or even try adding some lentils. Very yummy, will definitely make again!

Wonderful!  Even my husband, who doesn't generally like soup and tolerates ham, really liked this soup.  He even asked me why I didn't make more!  Make sure to use a ham bone with some meat and fat on it, otherwise this would taste more like vegetable soup.

This recipe was DELISH! One of my new favorites! I added some carrots and celery and left out the beans because we don't like them very much.  I also did 5 cups of water and 5 buillion cubes, and it seemed to be perfect. Not too salty! I added 2 bay leaves and 2 tsp of garlic too.  I let this cook from 630am-7pm on low and it was PEFECT!  Thanks SO MUCH for the recipe!!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic.  My husband doesn't eat beans, so I've been at a loss for what to do with the left over ham bone.  I left out the beans, then included chopped veggies left over from the veggie tray, and added pasta at the very end.  Literally, you can toss in anything you have left over in the fridge.

This was easy and really delicious. I originally made the ham with a cinnamon glaze, it kind of clashed with the flavor of the soup so I'll def keep that in mind next time.

So so so very delicious.  Definitely going in my recipe box!!
I made some personal changes and used crushed tomatoes and a bit of diced tomatoes I had in my fridge and a carrot and 2 bay leaves.  I used one can of navy beans and I use pureed vegetables for my son and of the pureed stuff I used 1/2 cup each of carrots, kidney beans and spinach just to help thicken the broth and get more veggies into my family lol 
It's great.  I highly recommend it!!!!

OMG this wasw Fantastic!!  I have the PICKIEST eaters around here and everyone not only had seconds, but thirds too!!!  Wow it was so good!   I did make a couple changes based on what I like and some of the suggestions. **   I added a cut up carrot, I added celery but not chopped, put in a stalk whole (noone likes the texture of cooked celery but I wanted the flavor) Put in 2 bay leaves. Skipped the peppers and onions (did add a dash of minced onion from a jar) Also I used crushed tomateos instad of diced beacuse my picky son hates tomato chunks. I cooked it all day, like from 8am to about 6pm andin the last half hour or so I threw in some alphabet pasta. It was fabulous, I am sure the original reciipes was meant to be tweaked to your personal tastes and I am so glad you shared this!!  I will be making it again and passing on the recipe to others, Thanks!

This was EXCELLENT!  I added a few other items, as other folks suggested, including celery, carrot, garlic, and a bay leaf.  My crock pot wasn't large enough, so I cooked it on low on the stove top.  SUPERB!  We absolutely loved it.

I made this soup not really expecting much.  Boy were we pleasantly surprised.  I added 3 bay leaves, more potatoes, 2 celery ribs and a can of rotel tomatoes.  I also put in two extra cups of water accidentally along with left over mashed potatoes and tomato soup.  It was unbelieveably good.

Wow!  Super easy and delicious!  I didn't have any potatoes on hand and it is wonderful without them.  Will definitely be making this again.  It only takes about 1 hour in a dutch oven over med heat.

Maybe make it correctly before you neg rep it....

Reviewed: Nov. 25, 2007 By:  Jill-----This was the weakest recipe I've tried yet from this site. Maybe I used too much onion, maybe I didn't cook it long enough. I won't probably won't try it again. (Although I used a honey-baked ham...which might have something to do with it...)

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe with cornbread!  I did omit the green pepper.  I used our left-over honey baked ham bone from Christmas (review is late, I know).  Had really good flavor and will most certainly be making this often!!  I would recommend this soup to everyone to try.  You won't have the "usual" problem like with navy bean soup either.

Loved it.  Used homemade chicken stock and omitted the peppers.  Substituted carrots and celery.  The beans were a brilliant addition.  Thanks for the can't miss soup.

Very tasty!  I added celery and garlic and cooked it on low for about 7 hours.  Carrots would have fit in nicely to this soup as well.  I also used 6 t. sodium free chicken bouillon granules in place of the cubes.

This is a very good, hearty soup.  I would probably add some celery and some garlic.  But as is, it's an excellent soup.  I would highly suggest making it especially on a cold, winter day (today).

Excellent Recipe thanks.  I left out the green peppers and added carrots and celery.  I started up the soup on low at 7:30 am but I didn't add the potatoes until the soup had cooked on slow for 5 hours.  At the last minute I realized I forgot to add the kidney beans. Since my kids don't like them I left them out.  The soup was great.  We didn't miss the beans at all.  My kids loved the ham.  Served with corn bread and it was great!

We didn't like this soup at first bite (seemed kinda bland), but half a bowl in it had really grown on us.  It did take all day in the crock pot to extract a decent amount of flavor from the ham bone, so that might have been part of the initial problem.  All in all, a keeper recipe.

Good soup recipe, with modifications.  I left out the green pepper (since we don't like it). I used a huge meaty hambone, and the soup was salty because of it.  However, that didn't bother me.  The broth, however, seemed kind of lifeless.  After I added 8 oz. of tomato sauce, we really like the soup!  I'll make this again, but I'll definitely add the tomato sauce.

Made this using the leftover bone from our Thanksgiving ham.  I followed other's recommendations and added frozen vegetables and chopped up some of the leftover ham and added that as well. I also added a couple of dashes of hot sauce. Very tasty...even better the next day.

I’ve tried a few ham bone soups from this site and this is the favorite so far by friends and family and have made a couple of times.  This time I used a bag of frozen chopped onion w/ red and green bell peppers and great white beans. I doubled everything except the potatoes but mine were kind of big.   Served with corn bread.

Good, easy recipe. I added one can of Italian green beans instead of a green pepper and a lot of fresh herbs, along with veggie broth in place of chicken bouillon. It is a good everyday recipe with LOTS of flavor. A splash of cream to finish would be nice too!

I couldn't believe I made an entire meal out of leftover hambone, do not waste your food! I improvised and added fresh carrots instead of green peppers, we skipped the diced tomatoes and used chicken broth. You can really throw in whatever you like. Delicious!  Don't add too much salt because the ham gives that flavor.

This was a huge hit! Absolutely delicious! I made it in the crock pot. I added a few things: a bag of frozen corn, a small can of green chilis, extra cubed ham and another cup or two of water. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Again, it was very tasty. I will definitely make it again!

I am sure this is an excellent "set it and forget" slow cooker recipe, however if you have time try making this on the stove top for a greater depth of favors. I like to saute the veggies in a heavy bottom dutch oven (I add carrots, celery and garlic) before adding the ham bone. If available, try using fire roasted tomatoes. Bring to a soft boil, then reduce the heat  and simmer, covered, for several hours. Serve with warm, fresh bread and a salad and this make for a wonderful dinner!

We LOVED this soup!  I cooked it on the stove for 5 hours and added some spices that I thought would go good with ham: mustard powder, garlic and onion powders, cayenne pepper and pepper flakes, a bit of brown sugar,  dashes of oregano and basil, pinch of thyme, etc.  Added carrots and celery too.  I wanted to avoid in being too bland, we like spice.  I think the next time I will use sweet potatoes, that should add another dimension of flavor.  It's a nice recipe that lends itself to improvisation.  Very good!

I basically emptied my veggi drawer into the crock pot.  Used 5 small potatoes , added peas, corn, carrots, cabbage and celery. White beans instead of red and red pepper instead of green. Had ham base I used instead of chicken broth. So yeah... not really rating the submitted recipie. But love the concept and the fact that you can make it your own!

I've been using AllRecipes regularly for several months now, and this is the first recipe I made worth writing a review for.

While I made a few changes for personal taste (see below  later and hear me out), this recipe deserves 5 stars for 1) no seasonings required 2) how flavorful the ham bone made each bite, and 3) the texture and taste of the kidney beans. Like another reviewer, I will be buying a bone-in ham just to make this soup again!

What I did differently from recipe: I had already used kitchen shears to trim all the meat off my ham bone before finding this recipe, so ended up throwing a couple handfuls full of diced ham in with the soup. I cut back on the potatoes and replaced with a similar quantity of carrots and celery. Instead of the 4 c water + 6 cubes chicken bouillon, I used two 14.5oz cans of low-sodium chicken broth (I was nervous about missing out on some saltiness because of this, but the diced ham and ham bone was enough to give the soup a balanced salty flavor.)

Cheers!

This soup had so much flavor, everyone in my house gobbled it up . I used the crockpot, and followed the recipe to a T, didn't need any adjustments. I didn't think it was spicy, if you are looking for that, then add a jalapeno!

A very nice soup for the cold winter day. Do everything you can to keep the salt down. Low sodium everything and don't add salt. Rinse the heck out of the ham also.
I prefer this the second day after cooking in the fridge and then scraping extra fat.

my husband and myself loved this! I did not include the peppers and I used chili beans instead of kidney (personal preference). Other than that it was as stated. it was such a big hit that my husband begged me to make it again.

Made this for the 1st time and it came out pretty good. I read ALOT of the reviews so was prepared. 1st, it was not at all too salty, having used a spiral ham bone from Costco's. Had TOO much meat on it actually, so had to remove some from the crock pot. 2nd, had to add at least another 4 cups of water w/bouillon because there just wasn't enough liquid. 3rd, I started off on hi for an hour, then lowered it to low, and let it cook until we were ready to eat it. Aside from that, this was a wonderful soup!

This is a great way to use up the Thanksgiving ham bone!  I made a low sodium version by cutting back on the chicken bouillon (I used Better Than Bouillon paste), and adding frozen blanched tomatoes(skinned)from my garden.  I also added a carrot and some diced celery. YUM!!!

My moms white bean and ham soup is completely destroyed by this recipe. Absolutely loved it and how easy it was. I replaced kidney with two cans pinto sinve we dont like kidney. I also took the advice of others and added bay leaves and garlic powder.

I used a box of Chicken stock and some cannelloni beans instead because that's what I had.  This ended up being delicious.  I'm now looking forward to getting more ham bones in the future so I can do this again.

This was fabulous!  The flavor was so good and I followed the recipe 90%.  I used a huge frozen ham bone and added a can of white northern beans and a can of pinto beans.  Otherwise, followed the recipe using chicken broth instead of water and cubes.  I put it on high for 1 hour then on low for about 10 hours.  Absolutely delicious, no extra seasoning needed for us.  It makes A LOT, so be prepared for company or big freezer space!

Fantastic soup.  I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water and skipped the chicken bouillon.  I substituted chopped celery for the bell pepper.  I also added some chopped carrot.  I cooked at least 9-10 hours and it was perfect.

This was the best ham soup I ever made! I will agree with many and reduce the bullion in half as it was a bit too salty. I used 2 tablespoons of Better Than Bullion and would use one next time. I also added bay leaves and a splash of cooking sherry at the end along with a couple shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce. Also added carrots and had an onion roll to dunk in and mop up the good juice. If you want a serving quick do what I did...ladled a few cups of it into a sauce pan and simmered for an hour. This was my supper while the rest slow cooked the rest of the evening. Made a wonderful lunch! I want to make this a yearly tradition with the Christmas hambone.

OMG -- this soup is great!  My friends say it is the best also.  I didn't have tomatoes, so I used mild bottles salsa, and used a honey baked ham bone.

Saved the stock from cooking the ham... sweet glaze and all... put it in the fridge overnight skimmed the fat off the top and then froze in a baggy. Threw the left over hambone with meat still attached in a separate baggie and when I was ready to make this recipe I threw it all in the crockpot to thaw and cook. Then threw in all the ingredients with less water and bouillon to make up for adding the stock... let everything cook for suggested time then took out the hambone with the meat still on it then remove meat, cut up and put it back in the pot. I especially loved the cinnamon from the ham glaze. Great for a cold day. Hubby and children loved it. Left overs were awesome days later. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

SO YUMMY! I was afraid that the four cups of water wouldn't be enough, but with the liquid from the beans and tomatoes, it was fine. I only used about half the tomatoes and no peppers, but added about two cups of diced ham, bay leaf, and garlic powder. Perfect way to use up a ham bone!

My husband had made up his mind to not like this dish and it didn't look all that appetizing to me either but I had a lot of ham left over from Christmas so I had to do SOMETHING with it. The only thing I added was some brown rice because I added too much liquid. 
This soup was superb! I put it in individual containers to freeze because I knew it wouldnt all get eaten but those containers  never made it to the freezer because my husband kept chowing down on the soup. This recipe is now a staple in my house.

This was easy and tasted great.  Only used 4 bouillon cubes and exchanged green for red peppers, and added some Cajun spice (i like things with kick).

Made this as is and very easy!  Delicious but a little too salty.  Would make again but probably use low sodium chicken broth instead of the bouillon.  Was awesome to come home and smell this cooking!

I have varied it by adding black beans, adding more cubed smoked ham, use chicken broth/water half and  half, use sweet potaoes. It's ALL good. You basically cant go wrong. I let this cook on low in my crockpot all day while I am at work.

The taste was REALLY good.  I had to omit the green peppers because I didn't have one on hand.  I did add rosemary.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I felt it was a little greasy.

What a pleasant surprise this soup is! Good, humble food. Served with some bread, it makes a perfect meal on a chilly evening.   I wanted to use the leftover bone from Christmas ham and found this recipe. I was skeptical upon reading it. I really thought it would turn out bland. On the contrary, it is full of flavor without any additional seasoning. The ham bone does all the work.

I have to admit I was skeptical because the ingredients are so simple but this is truly an amazing soup.  It took minutes to prep and was so yummy.  Even my picky toddler ate it.  Thanks for sharing - we will make this again and again!

Wow, this was great. Used it as the inaugural recipe for my new seven quart enamel cast iron dutch oven my husband bought me for Cristmas. It seemed way too easy - no browning vegetables, just toss it all in a pot, but it worked. I used chicken broth instead of boullion, added a couple chopped carrots and a spoonful of chopped garlic and cooked it stovetop for about three hours. It was awesome. I used a honey baked hambone and was careful not to add the sugary crust or juice. Seasoning was perfect. Remove the bone at the end and shred the meat, returning meat to the pot. Remove any cunks of fat and discard. Very very good.

This was a very tasty way to use up a ham bone. I used carrots instead of green peppers and the spicy tomatoes with green chilies. I served it with crusty bread. It surprised me how flavorful it was without adding any spices.

Wonderful soup! I did change it a bit as I didn't have the green pepper or beans. I added more Italian style tomatoes and about 1 1/2t of fresh ground black pepper. Now, what do I do with the ham that I bought just to get the bone??!! LOL. I wish I could buy just the ham bone here! Aloha

This soup has a very good flavor.  I used the suggestions and used diced tomatoes with green peppers and chicken broth.  I will make this again for sure!

This soup was perfect!  The flavor was subtle, but yummy.  I've tried other ham soup recipes and they are too heavy for my taste.  The only problem was that I wished it made more!  Had one batch for dinner and the other is in the freezer.  We only have a ham a few times a year, but this recipe will make me want it more often!

This was very good.  The ham-chix broth-tomato flavor was awesome. I did add 2 cups more water as the 6 bouillon cubes made it quite strong. Next time i will use 4 or 5 cubes. I might add a can of another kind of bean and try thickening the broth next time.

I was shocked that I actually really enjoyed this soup.  My last attempt with a ham bone was not so good... so this was pleasantly surprising.   Used both sweet potatoes and regular. Did not add green peppers.  Also added kailbasa sausage.  The fat from the ham floats to the top of the soup if you want to strain it off.

My family loves this soup!  Nice way to use up a ham bone other than ham & pea soup.  I've used just chunks over left over ham (no bone needed), and spice it up with a little dried chili flakes.

What's great about a recipe like this is that you can tinker with some of ingredients and easily create delicious soup. I added 1 can of seasoned collard greens just to add color & another veggie and used a can of black beans & 2 serrano peppers, as I didn't have the kidney beans or the green bell pepper on hand. It was great to see how every inch of the ham went to use instead of being thrown away. We loved this soup!! Thanks for submitting! : )

I did not use the slow cooker it did not fit but I cooked this on the stove and my husband raved about it.  Great recipe, we will be making this again.  Very good recipe for leftover Ham Bone.  I've tried others, this is the best.

This was really good, and is easy to modify depending on what you have on hand. The tomatoes give the end product a unique, rich flavor. We made this without the beans or potatoes, and instead added lots of minced garlic, some chopped green onions and some long grain brown rice in the last hour. Great stuff!

This was very good and simple. I worried that there were no seasonings but it did not need any. You really can add anything you would like to this soup. Carrots, celery, and anything else you have around. I even think it would be good with beef or chicken instead of ham. I will make this again.

my rating is based on the changed I made to this delicious soup.  Instead of green pepper, I added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables, and instead of bouillion, I added a 32 oz box of chicken broth.  My family loves this, its very similar to minestrone soup made with my changes.

You're kidding?  You rated this recipe two stars but all you've done is "think" about making it?  Sheesh!

Reviewed:  Feb. 2, 2006
"To those who referred to the salt content, that is going to happen since it's ham. I would suggest using chicken broth instead of bullion. However, I think if I decide to make this, I will be sure to use twice as much water as broth I use. I don't worry about it being watered down too much as there will be plenty of flavor from the broth and ham combination."

Thanks so much for this recipe!
I hate to waste and after we have Hsm it seems there was so much meat left on the bone. I make this everytime I make a ham. It freezes great, and you can add rice or pasta to change it up a bit, my kids are picky and dont want to see something twice

Great for flavor as well as ease!  I don't have a slow cooker though so instead I brought all ingredients to a boil and then lowered temp to med-low heat for about three hours.  Additionally, I made some substitutions due to pantry limitations.  They were...3 ounces red lentils instead of kidney beans, yellow and orange peppers instead of green, tomato puree instead of diced tomato, and 6 cups chicken broth with two chicken bullion cubes.  What a fantastic recipe that can stand up to so many deviations!!!!

A great recipe and very easy.  I used no sodium boullion and it was still very salty so I added a lot of potatoes and beans.  Turned out wonderful.  And I even left out the onion, bell pepper, and tomatoes.

I never used a left -over ham bone before, so I was very proud of myself for making full use of our Easter ham. I didn't have green pepper, but added celery, carrots, garlic and 2 bay leaves per other reviewers suggestions. I also used canned chicken broth, because that is what I had on hand. I think the soup was a little too salty - will use lo-sodium chicken brothe next time or my own home made stock. Otherwise, a good soup. Thank you for the recipe.

Great Soup!!  It is very easy to make and the ingredients are easily interchangable to suit what you have on hand.  I didn't have green pepper so I sauteed a bunch of celery and zucchini and added that.  I used a left over spiral ham bone w/lots of meat on it.  When the soup was done, I took a bunch of the meat and added it into the soup.  I have gotta say - this one is a keeper.  I will be making this again esp after holidays!!  Thank you!

perfect for those easter leftovers- serve with a salad for a perfect week day  dinner. Easy to prepare in a crockpot.  I added corn and carrots, did not have peppers so I left them out. Also added 2 bay leaves.

This is great, I only made a couple of changes--no kidney beans (hubby doesn't like), added two bay leaves and used fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic.No salt or pepper neeeded! It still tastes really good, nice meal to warm you up on a cold day!!

What a nice change from bean or pea soup for the left over ham bone. Here are my very slight changes. I used 2 cans of chicken broth then water to make 4 cups. Usrf red beans instead of kidney and added some carrots and celery. we really liked it. I am sure the recipe with out changes will be equaly as good, thanks for submiting. sklynstra

Absolutely fantastic! I cooked up my own kidney beans (boil w/garlic salt, pepper and a few chicken bouillon cubes) and used the remaining water for the 4 cups. Added carrots and garlic too.

When I first read this recipe it sounded ok. I made it & loved it! My husband & kids loved it also.I did add some carrots. My ham did have a little bit of glaze on it, but it still turned out great. I ended up cooking it on high for about 8 hours (I had a lot of meat left in the ham bone).

Very good soup! A greatand healthy way to use up my leftover Christmas ham! I added a few things:  2 bay leaves, an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce (I like things tomatoe-y), a clove of garlic-minced, and some chopped celery.  Cooked in my slow cooker for 6 hours and it was just right.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have never made soup with a ham bone before....It was a last minute decision so I had to make due with what I had on hand.  I needed to change a few things. I used chicken broth instead of cubes and water.  I didn't have a pepper so I added celery and carrots....which added tons of flavor.  I didn't have the beans either but I did have a package of veggie soup mix that was lentils, split peas, barley and tiny ABC pasta.  This was so tasty....the kids even had seconds and didn't complain when we had leftovers the next night!  Thanks, Charlene!

This is a good base recipe. It is a little too bland for me. Definitely needs some herbs and garlic. I added a little bit of chipotle in adobo sauce and was more pleased after that.

Great soup. DIdn't ecpect to like it the first time, but felt like cooking and had the stuff on hand (small white beans though), so figured if it was terrible it was no big deal, I was still getting the fridge cleaned out. It was wonderful!! 
Just made it again last night, still used the small white beans (we like those) and threw in 1/3 cup of barley to see how that would go, and it was even better and I'm going to eat some right now for lunch. Excellent recipe just as is, and wonderful for experimenting as well!

My family claims to hate soup.  But they absolutely LOVED this!!  They ask for ham just so I have the ham bone for soup!! I did use some extra veggies as suggested.

This was the weakest recipe I've tried yet from this site. Maybe I used too much onion, maybe I didn't cook it long enough. I won't probably won't try it again. (Although I used a honey-baked ham...which might have something to do with it...)

Great soup! Didn't have a lot of meat left on the ham bone, so I didn't add any meat. But did add extra veggies, and this still made a hearty veggie soup.

Fabulous soup!  I added some Thyme, rosemary and sage and a bit of rice.  I added all of the bits of leftover vegetable and it turned out really well.  I will be making more bone in ham now!

This was my first attempt at a ham bone soup and it was great! Like so many others, I used this recipe as a place to start and embellished on it...used tomato sauce, added garlic, carrots, peas, and dry mustard. Used only 3 boullion cubes to control the salt taste others referenced. It cooked in the crock pot overnight and we had it for breakfast! Thanks for a great soup starter.

As I was making this soup, I really wasn't sure I was going to like it, but it's surprisingly good.  It's not the best soup I've ever eaten, so I'm not going to give it 5 stars, but it's worth making if you've got a ham bone you need to use.

I used rice instead of potatoes, and doubled the amounts of green peppers and onions.  It came out almost like a jambalaya soup!  The flavor really depends on the existing seasoning in the ham.  It is a very easy way to use up a ham bone.  Tasty, but not spectacular.

I've never made or eaten a ham and/or bean soup, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  However, this was a hit with the whole family.  Per previous reviews, I used 2 cans low sodium chicken broth and 2C water w/ 1 boullion cube to cut down on the salt.  Also added one can of navy beans.  This a great way to use up that big ham bone!!

This was very good.  I added a bunch of other veggies such as zucchini, carrots, and green beans.  I also put in a larger can of kidney beans than the recipe states and added a cup or so of Great Northern beans.  I used less chicken boullion squares than the recipe asked for - my cubes are one cube for two cups of water therefore I only used 2 cubes.  It was very tasty in the end and even my daughter ate it (she's pretty picky).

This was a good recipe, but I added LOTS of veggies, zucchini, green beans, carrots, & celery and without them I'm not sure as to how 'good' the recipe would have been.  The flavor was good, but I would use it as a base for your imagination.

I made this in an old 3 & 1/2 quart crock pot.  Omitted the onion (husband can't eat them) and the bell pepper (we don't like them).  We all liked it!  I had two ham bones in my freezer and I had enough room to put both of them into the pot.  There is even enough room to add another can of beans.  Next time I will add some fresh ground pepper and chopped carrots.  Easy to make, will definitely make again.

made exactly as written.... added some carrots as other reviewers suggested and more ham as it was what I had left.   EXCELLENT.   So flavorful!   Wouldn't change a thing next time I make it, and it will be made next time I have a ham bone.

I made it just as the recipe called and it was a huge hit but next time I will double it OMG I couldn't believe it. Everyone devoured it. I did serve it with Rosemary bread. A definite redo redo redo every day of the week.

My family loved this! I do understand the complaints about salt; next time I will not use as much chicken bouillon. We still ate it up without leftovers as it was, though!

I was looking for something different to make with a leftover ham bone. In the past I had always just assumed that when we bought a ham we would end up with ham and navy bean soup.I was pleased with the outcome when I made this recipe. I had some celery on hand so I added that. I think next time I make it I will try adding some rice.The soup was very tasty and did not need additional seasonings.

This has become my post-Easter staple. My husband still raves about it days after it's finished!  Although I followed the basic recipe, like all soups, I think tweaking is part of the fun. My major change, in addition to adding bay leaf, carrots and whatever leftover veg that strikes my fancy, is that I use unsalted chicken broth instead of bouillon cubes and water. Seasoning can always be adjusted. To each his (or her) own!

I have made it with cabbage insnstead of pepper and I really liked it! I don't remember how much cabbage I added but it was a big hit as a post Christmas dish. I think it's going to be our family's tradition for every Chritmas.

What a great way to finish off a ham!  I did omit the potatoes but added rice and lots of peppers. This recipe freezes well and served with fresh buns, makes an awesome lunch.

Made this so many times and love it. Great way to utilize the bone from a ham. I don’t change the recipe and cook it as is and it turns out great. We usually serve it with cornbread.

This was a great way to get the most out of your ham. I used a honey baked hambone and low sodium chicken broth and left in the crockpot all day.  Turned out great.  It was still salty but not overpowering.  Recommend for any easy dinner that uses up leftovers!

This recipe is a great base but to make it a 5 star recipe it does require adjustment. Using Chicken broth instead of water is a must! If you like your soup with some texture or body, try adding cornstarch (melted in chicken broth or water) or something else if you don't want watery soup. Someone suggested potato flakes which I would love to try. I used two cans of beans, added a green pepper, two stalks of celery and chunks of ham  to give it some additional substance. I also used half the cubed bullion at first since so many commented on saltiness.  You can always taste half way through and decide if you want to add more.

I have made this soup many times over the course of the years I have had it saved and every time my family (young kids and adults) absolutely love it. The best part is it is so simple. I have even sped up the cook time by making it in a pot on the stove in just an hour and it is still amazing. Sometimes I sauté the peppers and onions sometimes I don’t, but it’s good either way. I highly recommend this soup!!

Made with organic chicken broth. Didn't have green pepper. Added some green beans and carrots. I wish I would have sauteed the onions and garlic beforehand.  Made in a crockpot. Took a long time for the flavor to develop and the ham to fall off but was well worth it. I'd add another can of beans next time (in addition). Very easy overall and good flavor.

A very nice simple soup. We enjoyed it with a loaf of homemade bread. 

I never knew there was so much more meat on a bone.  I had some extra ham I planned to add, didn't need to. The meat was hidden deep on the bone, I just kept finding more.

Since my family does not like tomatoes. I made some adjustments.  I took out the can of diced tomatoes.  Added 1 container of chicken broth (32 oz) and took out the cubes of bouillon.  The last hour of cooking I create a cream mixture in a separate pot.  First, melt 2 Tbs. of butter, then stir in 2 Tbs. flour, 1/2 tsp. Basil, 1/2 tsp. Oregano, and 1/4 tsp. Of black pepper.  Then add 2 cups of milk and cook and stir until thick and bubbly.  Then Cook and stir 1 minute more.  After done, add it to the crock pot, stir in and serve.

This  is a great recipe.  I added some Cajun seasoning.  Did not have the cubes so used the granules for the chicken flavor.  No chicken broth, just used water.  Also doubled the receipt.  Thank you, will definitely make this again.

This was a pretty good soup. It really was more of a vegetable soup, as the ham bone gave tons of flavor but hardly any meat. Only thing I added was a bit of celery I needed to use up; this is the perfect recipe to use up any vegetables you have in the fridge. My boyfriend loved it and I thought it was good. Next time I will eat it with a crusty bread. Very healthy and filling. I’ll keep this in my recipe rotation, especially as I am trying to increase veggie consumption in our diets!

Bland, horrible, tastes like ham water. I’m no longer trusting all recipes reviewers as so many have 4.5-5 stars for mediocre to awful recipes.

My family loves this soup.   Perfect for leftover bone and a bit of meat after a holiday meal.   Easy to make, simple ingredients and absolutely delicious.

I wanted more actual bone broth, not just chicken bouillon (which I didn't use), so I boiled the bone for several hours with some onion and carrots and garlic. Still the flavor was light. In the end, I added 1 packet of beef bouillon along with potatoes, Italian seasoned diced tomatoes, canned corn, kidney and lima beans, and carrots. Overall, this was a nice flavor, but a bit too much work for a busy mom.

Will make it again.  The carrots I had were huge so only used 3 carrots and 4 potatoes.  Used 1.5 cups of soups with the milk.  It was delicious.  Also didn't use any salt or pepper.  I have an allergy to pepper and my husband can't have a lot of salt in his diet.  It was still very tasty.

So so so good. I don't really like stews/soups but had a ham bone that needed to be used so I tried this. I made a couple minor changes. Didn't have green bell pepper so I used a red & yellow, used black beans instead of kidney (my husband & I don't care for most beans so I used what we liked) I did 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef bullion. Used two small potatoes instead of 3. I also added paprika & black pepper. I felt like it needed some meat so I seared a beef chuck steak that I had on hand, chopped & threw that in. My crockpot is old & wore out so I ended up transferring my soup to a pot & simmered on my stove for the last hr.

I used cannellini beans as a nod to my grandmother's pasta fagioli which she always made with a ham bone.  I browned the onions separately, in olive oil, and added last to the pot.  I did not use green peppers, and only used 2 potatoes (unskinned, chopped red potatoes).  I used chicken broth in place of water and bouillon.  The broth and ham can add all the salt you will probably need.

Found myself with a hambone and no one in my family is fond of pea soup. This was great! Used lentils instead of kidney beans because that was what I had. Also used broth in place of bouillon for  the same reason. 2 bay leaves only other addition. Hearty and delicious.

I did not have high hopes when I put it together but it was very good.  I think next time I will add a little celery and swap green beans for the green pepper.

Fabulous!  I didn't change anything. I was hopeful the flavor would be  great with so few ingredients and it was. My ham bone had a lot of meat on it. So easy to pull off the bone after 7 hrs.   I'll definitely make again.

I have made this soup three times.  Every time it's been great. I have made exactly as the recipe twice and the last time I added one fresh jalapeño chopped and two cloves of garlic chopped.  We like spice so this was a great basic recipe to spice up. Thanks for the recipe!

I like spice, so I added a bit of Cayenne Pepper and garlic. I did not do it in a slow cooker, just used my stove top instead. Mighty tasty.

What a great way to get rid of some left over ham. I thought the taste was a little on the bland side so I added some ground black pepper. I will definitely make this again.

This soup is definitely better with hot sauce added to it.  Next time I will try using low/no sodium chicken broth instead of the bullion cubes.  Other than that it was good.  My friend who doesn't like spicy foods loved it.

Wow did the soup turn out great.  I started out with the ham bone leftover from Thanksgiving. As others suggested I used 2 quarts of chicken broth as the base, added a couple of teaspoons of Better than Bullion and whatever veggies I had around the house.  I used vidalia onion, red, green and orange peppers, carrots, celery, 2 cans of fiesta corn and red potatoes.   Ground in some pepper and a couple teaspoons of Italian seasonings.  No salt since I used the better than bullion.  I left it on low in the crock pot while I went to work.  When I got home I made 2 cups of pasta shells, threw them in and I was done.  Outstanding is all I can say!  Only one thing to note was that the crock pot was FULL so care more must be taken not to spill all over the place. Definitely making it again when I get a bone.

Super simple. Added carrots and some leftover brocoli stalks, as well as 2 cloves of garlic. I used half a sweet potato instead of regular ones and vegetable broth as that's what I had on hand. ?? Everything else was the same. Will definitely make again! Thanks !

This recipe turned out far better than I thought it would. I did make a few changes just because I couldn't resist. I added a bay leaf, tablespoon of oregano, tablespoon of garlic salt, one can pinto beans, one can of corn, one can cut green beans, chopped celery, one chopped yellow onion, chopped carrots, and some black pepper. I'm looking forward to eating this by the fire tonight!

Couldn't believe such a simple recipe could be so good! The entire family loved it and we will definitely be making it again in the fall and winter. Only change we made was using chili beans since that was what was in the pantry.

We loved this soup, and so easy!  Used my Christmas hambone that I had frozen.  I used one can of Campbell's chicken broth and 3 cups of water, white northern beans, and left out the green pepper.  Otherwise I followed the recipe. I cooked it on high in my slow cooker until it got hot, then cooked it on low for about 5 hours.

This soup is amazing! I like a lot of broth so instead of water, I used organic chicken broth to almost fill my stock pot. I used only 2 billion cubes with enough water for each.

Made the recipe almost exactly as written. I didn't have enough kidney beans so I did half kidney and half black beans. Also had some chicken breasts laying in the fridge so I cooked them up with salt and pepper then shredded it into the soup along with the ham turned out awesome will be making this again!

I originally made this soup as written and it was delicious as is.  One of the best soups I've ever had.  I've made it a bunch of times now adding corn, green beans, and whatever else I had on hand.  The additions only made the soup even more delicious!  Thank you for the recipe!

A great soup!  The first time I made it I was skeptical- the whole family loved it! I found myself looking forward to the Holidays just so I could make this soup again.  Thank you!

Personal preference: Used carrots & peas instead of green pepper. Chicken broth instead of water. Only 2 bullion cubes.  Added celery, minced garlic & Bay leaf. YUM!

Really enjoyed this recipe; added green beans instead of chiles,  used 10.5 oz diced tomatoes with chiles instead of 14.5 oz; cut the onions to half, added a can of pinto beans with the kidney beans; added an extra cup of water (based on previous comments) and a little ground pepper.  Cooked in crock pot on high for 5 hours. Will definitely make this one again!

I wasn't sure about this, but I had a very meaty ham bone I didn't want to go to waste. So, I used canned green beans instead of green pepper, chicken broth in the can (2) and cooked it overnight. It got really thick and amazing. I will definitely make this again and recommend it as well.

Was different and new for us - and delicious!  I added about 1-2 cups of cut cooked ham  as well as approximately 1/2 cup broth from the ham and substituted 4 cups of unsalted chicken stock in place of water/bouillon.  I did not drain the kidney beans.  It was delicious and filling - perfect for this cold winter's night.

I left out the bell pepper and added chopped up ham after it cooked in the crock pot. Made for my father-n-law and froze some baggies he can eat later. He loved it, adding a little hot sauce to each bowl when he reheated.  A nice hearty soup with the ham added. Making it for new years eve.

Great recipe.  DO NOT put in salt and pepper.  Wait until 4 hours and taste.  Mine was salty enough. I added celery and carrots and 2 bay leafs.  You can put any veggies in this soup you have on hand.  I had a good deal of leftover ham which I diced small as well as the ham bone.   I added a lot more water and let it reduce but did now want a stew so more water helped keep it a soup.  You can always add water as you go.  I  added more ham, potatoes, tomatoes etc. as recipe called for but made sure I added enough water to make a large amount of soup which I will freeze in portions

I added carrots, a garlic clove and celery along with using beef broth and subbed red and yellow mini sweet peppers (that's what I had on hand) to the initial soup recipe. I had to cook it longer on high than the directions (four hours). Then once the meat fell off the bone (seven hours cooking time), I added frozen peas and gnocchi.  It was delish!

This soup turned out better than I thought it would. The two modifications I made were that I used a ham hock and 2 teaspoons of chili powder. There was not near the amount of meat had I used a ham bone of course, but it still gave great flavor. The chili powder really didn't make this recipe hot at all. I could taste it but I don't think it was hot. I loved drinking the broth out of my bowl. I have two other ham hocks in the freezer so I'm sure I'll make it again. I cooked it too long on high which made the peppers a little bit mushy. Next time I'll use the low setting for several hours, as suggested.

So good! Yum yum! All the goodness wouldn't fit in my crockpot so I threw it on the stove for about 2.5 hours. Used crushed tomatoes with green chilis (because it's what I had.) Added two stalks of celery and two bay leaves. Otherwise followed the recipe. I'll for sure be making this again!

Used only water and no bouillon. Classic with a twist potatoes. (not so rugged Russets) added one organic celery stalk and carrot. Always use pepper. A can of fire roasted diced tomatoes for chili and a can of pintos rinsed!

I love the flavor of bean soup and pea soup, but not the texture.  This is the best of both worlds - all of the flavor in a clear, veggie-filled soup.

My wife and I love this rich soup. We always avoid non-fresh ingredients, so we use fresh tomatoes and pre-soaked dry kidney beans in place of the cans. Just as easy.

I normally use ham bones for pea soup, but this was a nice change.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Thought the green pepper would ruin the soup, but it didn't.  I used low sodium soup cubes.

I wanted to make this recipe as written, but my husband requested no potatoes or peppers. Other than that, I followed it exactly, and it just disappeared!  I did try it again and used a mixture of dried beans that soaked overnight instead of the kidney beans, and that worked out well, too.  I am new to soup making and think this was a great recipe to start with.

I made this after Christmas to use up the leftover ham.  It was so easy!  The house smelled so good!  I followed the directions exactly.  My husband liked it but said it was too salty! If there is a way to avoid the saltiness, I would like to try and make it again.

Very good!  Mine came out a little onion-y, but I didn't have all the veg in it.  I used rice instead of potatoes, and the left overs were great!  More stew-like and it had a smokey taste to it.  I think I liked the left overs better!  : )  Def will be making this again next time we buy a ham!

My husband baked a ham that had a bone in it and asked me if I wanted the ham bone to use to make soup. I searched the internet and decided to use this recipe; since I had most of the ingredients. I did not have a green bell pepper so I omitted it. I added carrots, celery and garlic. This is currently in my slow cooker.

Delicious meal. My husband couldn't get enough. I did substitute a can of chili beans instead of kidney. My husband isn't much for soups but I was told I have to fix this more often.

Made the recipe with 2 cans of Great Northern Beans and no green pepper. I haven't had diced tomatos in a bean soup before, but it really was a great tasting soup. Will definately make it again.

Followed the recipe except may have added an extra cup or so of Chicken broth so I did not add any of the water.  Even though I had a big meaty ham bone and ham to add, the overall soup was kind of bland. Not a hit with my family.

I often buy a ham just so I can make this soup later (after eating all that yummy ham first, of course)!  This is my go-to recipe, though I just use it as a base and adjust depending on what veggies I have and what sounds good at the moment.  I've never made a bad pot of it!

Followed everyone's advice.  It was surprisingly Good.  The longer I cooked it in the crockpot the better it taste.  Added one small cup of Knorr's concentrated chicken stock to boost the flavor.  Also added celery. carrots and garlic per the other reviews.  To thicken the soup I added 3 tablespoons of cornstarch dissolved in warm water. It's a great soup.

Because I made so many changes, I did only give this four stars. It is a fabulous base recipe that really does fit the comfort food bill. I added 2 peeled and sliced carrots, 2 celery stalks including leaves, chopped, and I left out the green peppers as I didn't have any. I used about 6 c. water since I didn't use the liquid from the beans and used 6t. chicken base instead of bouillon. It filled my 7 qt. crockpot. It was filling and warm and tasty. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Great flavor, but a bit salty for my taste.  Maybe 1-2 less boullion?  Added carrots and celery, plus some cooked pasta at the end of cooking time.  Husband loved it.

great recipe...I used the water I boiled my ham in for the soup, added celery and a can of Campbells tomato soup instead of chicken bouillon and left out the beans.  Served with homemade bread from my bread machine...Thanks

My hubby wouldn't even try it, my son said yuck.  I thought it was ok, tasted more like stew then soup which was what we were expecting.  Not bad, but I won't make it again because I'll be the only one eating it.

This was a great recipe, but of course I didn't follow it completely. I added more beans, more tomatoes, more broth, carrots, celery, bay leaves, garlic and rosemary and hot sauce and it was soooooo yummy!!!

I cooked this all day in a slow cooker on Christmas eve and everyone loved it. I had to substitute a few ingredients to what was on hand: 3 cans chicken broth, chopped mild green chilies instead of green pepper and stewed tomatoes instead of diced.  I also added carrots and celery as suggested by others. This recipe will be a yearly tradition from now on.

Oh, so good!  We did not add beans or green pepper but the rest was delicious.  I added lots of potatoes, carrots, some garlic and doubled the broth and tomatoes. My small kids love this soup. I make this soup with every left over ham bone we have.  There are never leftovers.

I made the changes others suggested using low sodium chicken broth. I also used fire oasted tomatoes with garlic, omitted the pepper and added carrots and corn.  It was awsome.
