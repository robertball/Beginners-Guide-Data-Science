Fantastic! I made a double recipe and still had no leftovers.  My only changes: pre-bake the bottom crust for 5-10 minutes so that it doesn't come out soggy, added rosemary and sage.  A great version is to make a herb and cheese piecrust.

Made a lot of changes with this recipe.  Used the veggies, spices and turkey as written, but changed the sauce and crust.  For the potaotes, I cubed and microwaved for about 8 minutes to soften.  For the sauce, started with a jar of Boston Market turkey gravy and to this added a package of Knorr roasted turkey gravy mix and 2 cups of water.  Actually still had to use a little cornstarch to thicken.  Poured this into a casserole dish and put this into a 400 degree oven till bubbly.  Once bubbly, I took it out and place a sheet of puff pastry over the top and baked an additional 15 minutes.

One of the best things about Thanksgiving is that I get to make this turkey pot pie afterwards! This is a great recipe I have made over and over again. I have also put the filling into a 9x13 dish and put refrigerated buscuit dough over the top for a change-you can pretty much follow the bake time off the biscuit wrapper for this. This dish is always a hit with my family!

I just made this pot pie today, and I am definitely saving this recipe!  In fact, I already froze all of my turkey in packages of 2 cups.  

First off, I made my own pastry crust using a basic 1 1/3  C flour, 3T  shortening, 5T butter, and 4T water and salt.  For those reviews which used store bought crust, the homemade will add much more flavor.  It's a lot easier than some people think.

I increased the chicken to 2 C and used 1/2 of a bag of mixed veggies instead of fresh carrots and celery.  And I only added one potato because the bag of potatoes I recently bought are really large.  

After reading reviews about blandness and dryness, I increased the butter, flour, and milk by 50% for extra gravy.  Next time I will double it because I like more gravy.  I also added fresh thyme for additional flavor.  It was delicious!  If it had more gravy, it would have been 5 stars.  I will modify the next time for sure, then it will be perfect.

This recipe was GREAT!  We made it without a pie crust and just put a layer of puff pastry on top and cooked for 25 mins at 400.  An easy way to use up leftovers.

Delish! Especially with my grandma's homemade pastry and the post about the blandness.  I was sure to taste before filling the pie and decided to add a tsp. of poultry seasoning rather than more boullion as well as a little more pepper... it was great, can't wait for Easter turkey left overs! Thanx!

This was absolutely wonderful.  Everyone in my family ate it ( including a 3 and 1 yr old).  The second time I made this I used leftover frozen turkey and it made no difference.  My suggestions to make it easier to do: 1) deal with the crust after having made the filling; it's best to let it cool a bit, 2) add the turkey to the first skillet and make the gravy by itself.  Enjoy!!!

Stunning.  It's great with sauteed mushrooms added too, or leftover chicken instead of turkey.  And if you're feeling lazy, it doesn't much matter if you leave out the lower crust.

I made this with the leftovers from a baked chicken and it was wonderful! My kids gobbled it right up and hubby and I loved it too. I used 2 potatoes and add a can of condensed cream of chicken soup to make it creamier. Also used some Montreal seasoning on the chicken. VERY good!

WOW!  This is a terrific recipe!  After reading the reviews, I made my own modifications to it the first time I made it.  First, I used Marie Callender's ready-made pie crust that you can purchase in supermarkets.  Second, I used 3 stalks of celery instead of two, used about 3/4 cup sliced baby carrots instead of dicing regular carrots, I used 2 1/2 cups chicken broth instead of 2 cups boullion, and DEFINITELY decrease the amount of potatoes to ONE MEDIUM POTATO diced.  I increased the amount of turkey to 2 cups.  This recipe came out fantastic, and I even had enough filling left over to make a smaller pot pie.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I used the recipe below, but used turkey stock instead of bullion, half and half instead of milk, added my leftover gravy (maybe 2/3c), added sage and rosemary, and used store-bought crust b/c I suck at that.  I prebaked the bottom crust for 5min.

Loved this recipe!  I did make a few changes.  I used about 1/2 cup of turkey drippings (minus the fat) that I had saved from the turkey and didn't use in my gravy, and then made up the remaining 1 1/2 coup with chicken soup base instead of bouillon.  When it called for the butter, milk, flour and turkey, I mixed the turkey in with leftover turkey gravy instead and then added a little bit of cornstarch to help with the thickening.  I think the turkey gravy helped with the issue of blandness that some people complained about.  I wanted a real use of my leftovers and this allowed me to use more.  Anyone with leftover mashed potatoes could use those to help with thickening as well.  All and all a yummy way to use up leftovers!

Had lots of leftover turkey following Thanksgiving dinner.  Invited friends over, but wanted to more than just re-heating everything.  I followed the recipe, but made the following additions based on some of the reviews and personal tastes.  Added 1/2 cup frozen peas, 1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder.  This was EXCELENT!!!  Great, satisfying comfort food.

I pretty much followed the recipe as printed.  I made (3) individual pot pies in the white "grab-it" bowls.  I used store-bought crust for the bottom, and puff pastry for the top.  I made the filling with onion, celery, carrots, 1 potato and frozen peas (amounts are negotiable).  I added sage and a little bit (a few tablespoons) of leftover dressing for added flavor.  Before adding the chicken stock/boullion, I made a roux with flour so that it blended well.  I added milk/flour mixture (well blended) until I liked the consistency.  I baked it according to the original recipe.  It was delicious ... Definitely a keeper!!  Next time I'll try chicken!!  Thank you!

Instead of using pie crust, I put the filling into a 9x13 dish and put refrigerated buscuit dough over the top, It turned out great. I also waited on adding the turkey, I ended up adding the turkey at the end, to whole mixture. I would like to try it with the pie crust some time too. This is great for leftover turkey or chicken. **My boyfriend claims this is his favorite dish i've made for him!!!;)  so thanks!!! for the recipe!

I used the crescent rolls on top as one reviewed had suggested, and loved this.  What was really good was the seasoning mixture that is used, very yummy and tasty.  I will be making this again for sure.

I cut back on the parsley by half and was happy I did.  Otherwise what a great way to use turkey left overs!  My husband took leftovers to work, he NEVER takes left overs to work.

Made this following recipe almost exactly as stated (except I used ready made pie crust and instead of bouillon cubes and water, I used lower sodium chicken broth).  My family LOVED this.  They all said it was the best pot pie they have ever had. I will add some peas next time though, but only cause we like peas. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks, Linda.

This was really good. I did, however, make some changes. Instead of using chicken bouillon and water I used chicken stock. I also added a can of cream of chicken soup, 1/4 cup of dry white wine, and 1 tsp of Italian seasoning. Also, I used heavy cream instead of milk. Really delicious! My family absolutely loved it!!

Easily 5 stars. Here's why this is the perfect recipe for leftover Thanksgiving turkey:  Use the No-Fail Pie Crust 1 recipe from this site to make your pumpkin pie. The recipe yields 3 crusts, so you'll have the perfect amount left over. Trust me, homemade is a thousand times better than store-bought (and really easy to make).   Using the leftover crust, roll out the bottom and pre-bake for about 7 minutes, letting cool while the vegetables are cooking and the turkey/milk/flour combo is heating. Double the water/bouillon for a thicker gravy (much of the liquid will boil away while the veggies/potatoes are cooking). I added some poultry seasoning to enhance the flavor, and fresh sliced mushrooms. Poured atop the cooled pie crust, and added the 3rd (and final) crust as a top layer, making slits to let out the steam.   The end result? Unbelievably good. I've tried several of the pot pie recipes on allrecipes.com and this is by far the best. Great flavor, easy to make - this one is a keeper!

This is a great recipe!! I did pre-bake the bottom crust for about 5 min. I also used turkey stock and probably a half cup of turkey gravy in the filling instead of the water and bouillon cubes. Will definitely be making it again...

i made a few substitutions to this recipe. i'm not sure if that affected the flavor because overall i felt this really was kind of bland.  I used califlower in place of potatoes and a can of chicken broth in place of the water and bullion.  i'm not a big salt person, but i added more than called for and i still felt it needed something.  i will try this again, but will add more seasoning to it.  i did prebake the bottom crust as someone else suggested.  I recommend this.

This was SO good! I did everything as is except I used 2 cups of chicken broth and doubles the milk for a creamier texture. I also added some home cooked gravy on top of the filling before covering the crust top and putting it in the oven! My dad and brother (who are both very picky and critical) thought it was very good!

This pot pie was delicious. I used chicken,and added white wine to the carrots and onions. One thing I would recommend is to double the milk, so its a little more creamy, and maybe decrease the oregano a little. It was to overpowering.

Super Yummy! My family & I just had this tonight using our leftover Thanksgiving turkey. My late mom used to make it & I neglected to get her recipe. I used her famous pie crust recipe & this filling recipe & I felt like she was hugging me! I didn't have parsley or oregano handy so I used Trader Joe's "Everyday Seasoning" (good on everything!)& a bit of poultry seasoning. I used 1/2 large onion, and only 1 carrot, and added about 3/4 cup frozen peas (I remembered my mom's had peas). I used another reviewer's suggestions and microwaved the potatoes for 7 mins... & pre-baked the empty crust about 7 mins, also. Thanks for bringing back memories!

Wonderful.I sub'd 1 14oz can chicken broth in lieu of water/chicken Cubes. My family loves a thicker sauce in the pot pie so I added 1 can-cream of chicken.Added peas as well.Yum!Yum!Yum!

This pie was awesome! The only thing I changed after reading other reviews was I used 4 cups of low sodium chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon. Also, it makes two 9" pies.

This was my first time making a pot pie and it was a hit. It was so easy and the results were fantastic. I did bake the bottom crust first for 6 minutes and had good results. I had too much filing and save the rest so my boyfriend can eat as a soup. I can't wait to try this with chicken.

Great way of transforming leftover turkey to something delicious! I used biscuit instead of pastry and doubled the sauce. Also added leftover green bean casserole to the turkey mixture. It turned out great! I will definitely make this again.

I made this tonight using my leftover Thanksgiving turkey; my modifications were to use organic stock and skip the bouillon cubes, fresh parsley and the addition of rubbed sage.  I also didn't mix the turkey into flour, I didn't think that was necessary and mixed it in before filling the pie.  The amount of filling was perfect for a deep dish pie and I love that this recipe doesn't call for soup... Thanks! :)

It sounded good at a first scan, but as were putting it together, I saw that it called for Parsley (Lots) and Oregano.  I hemmed and hawed on this, but finally followed the recipe, assuming that the author had some idea of what they were doing, I was wrong, the Oregano and Parsley have no place in a turky pot pie and the only flavors that could be discerned was these wrong ingredients.

This was the first time I've made pot pie and it was a success!  I used some different ingredients... potatoes, frozen peas and carrots, celery, and minced onion... but followed the directions.  I made my own crust, too.  I made it in a 9x13 basically doubled the ingredients.  Delicious!!  Served it for guests and they loved it, too!  A keeper for me!

This was awesome! I used left over turkey breast that was cooked in the slow cooker the night before. I strained and saved the liquid from the crock pot and put in fridg overnight. I scraped the fat off the top and used the turkey drippings from the night before in place of the 2 C water and 2 Bouillon cubes.This was really a "feel good" meal.

Best pot pie by far.  Used Pillsbury Pie Crust from the store and brushed a beaten egg over the top crust, comes out just like homemade.  I did double the turkey mixture...there is nothing better than gravy and turkey than more gravy and turkey!

This recipe was delicious!  Our family really enjoyed it.  I did substitute the top crust with a cornbread topping and it was very tasty!

I can't wait to make it again with Chicken.

Thanks Linda!  Happy Holidays!

This recipe seemed a little complicated but it went together quickly and easily.  Since I didn't have any celery on hand (I can't stand its flavor), I omitted it.  I also used my own chicken stock, rather than using salty bouillon and everyone loved it. I'll make it again, exactly the same way.

I made this recipe with leftover turkey after Christmas and I liked the pot pie better than the turkey on its own.  My husband devoured the pot pie and was so happy that I made this rather than being stuck eating the same boring turkey for days on end.  This pot pie is in my recipe box and I'm definitely making this again.  I'm certain this would taste just as great as a chicken pot pie.

Really needs gravy. Very dry. I do like the flavors so if I try this recipe again I will add gravy to the mixture before I bake and I will make my own crust. I think this will make a difference. I do have to say one more time that the flavor sure is good.

Taste was perfect. My only issue was that mine was not creamy enough for me. However, I could have overcooked the sauce.

This is the second year in a row I've made this for a special Pie Thanksgiving my friends and I have. I'm not an amazing chef but it has always turned out delicious and great looking! This year my friend texted me the next day saying he can't wait for me to make it again next year. The directions are simple enough to follow and the kitchen always smells so wonderful after I make it!

I made this last night for my family, and we all loved it!  Even my husband, who doesn't like pot pie, went back for seconds!  I did make a couple of substitutions, but I kept the method the same.  Instead of turkey, I used Quorn Turk'y Roast (we're vegetarian).  Also, I did as some other reviewers did and used a sheet of puff pastry for the crust, with no bottom crust.  Finally, I used evaporated milk instead of regular to add a little more depth (b/c I didn't use bouillon).  I'm sure that it is perfectly wonderful as written also!  Thank you for sharing!

This was a delicious pie!  I couldn't stop eating it!  I made it with intentions of freezing leftovers, but between the hubby and I it was gone in 3 days.  I will be utilizing this recipe annually after each and every one of those turkeys we can never finish.

This was so awesome!!! I made the crust from scratch and I think that helped make it even better.  I also added a few leftover greenbeans. The only drawback was I put baking potatoes in the pie and according to online sources it isn't good to freeze something with baking potatoes.  Bummer, but hope to eat the rest anyway.

As I'm always looking for new recipes where I can use leftover chicken or turkey,I gave this a try. I made it just as stated and it was really very good! I served with fresh fruit and it made a great meal! My 3 and 9-year-old loved it as did my husband. We will definitely make this again! Thank you!

great recipe! I only used 2 potatoes though - unless your potatoes are small, 3 would be too many.  This was my first time making a meat pie though - how do you cut and serve the slices neatly?!  Tasted great but it looked like a mess rather than a slice of pie on the plate - there must be a trick to it that I don't know.

I make this about once a month using chicken.  It's very good!  I substitute boxed chicken stock for the bouillon and water.  I put a lot less oregano, and I use fresh parsley.  I cheat and use a Pillsbury crust, too.

Delish! I used leftover turkey and used sweet potatoes instead. didnt have carrots so used corn. I also used fresh rosemary and sprinkled it on top of the pie before cooking for a nice garnish. My 18 month old loved it! This is my new day after thanksgiving dinner.

Fantastic! I had to modify to make it in one skillet: butter, potatoes and carrots first until softened but firm, then add other veggies and spices. Next add turkey, then add flour, stir. Then milk stirring well, then chicken broth. We also added a few garlic cloves in with our veggies. We didn't have a top crust, so I used dumpling mix and covered with aluminum foil in the oven. We removed the foil for the last 10 minutes which gave the crust some crunch. This was great - even the kids ate it!

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, and it is delicious!  The small changes I made included a bit less celery (I ran out), olive oil instead of butter to saute the veggies, and margarine instead of butter to make the bechamel.  Since I live at altitude (8,000 feet), I baked the pie for the first 15 minutes at 425 as directed, but found I needed to continue baking at 350 for 30 minutes for the crust to brown nicely.  One more change was that I used an 8 x 8 baking pan, because I don't have a 10 inch pie pan.  My husband has very traditional tastes, and he raved!

Excellent recipe...the sauce was yummy and flavorful. Since I did not have potatoes or carrots, I switch it with dried hash brown potatoes and mixed frozen veggies. It worked out great. Thanks will definitely make again and again

This is AWESOME! I made this last year with my leftover turkey and made again this year (we had Thanksgiving early as my husband is deploying).  I have a family of four and there are no leftovers.  Soo... watch out if you really are trying to serve 8 as the recipe states.  I make this recipe exactly, which is amazing as I usually think I can improve on most recipes to suit our tastes.  This one is perfect as is.  Enjoy!!!!

Loved it!!  Made it last Thanksgiving with leftover over turkey.  I made it this past weekend.  I used boiled turkey thighs this time.  You just need 2 small ones.  It is a lot of work but so worth every bite.

This comes out perfectly exactly as it is written. I had leftover turkey drippings from the turkey and added them in and it was great.
 I suggest using the Best Ever Pie Crust recive also on this site.

This dish was very tasty.  I used chicken instead of turkey because it is what I had on hand.  I also substituted chicken broth for the chicken boullion and water and substituted cream for the milk because I was serving company.  This is a perfect comfort food, yet tasty enough for company.

This recipe is great!  I am throwing away my old recipe that calls for canned soup and I think everyone else should too!  All the ingredients are fresh and most everyone should have them on hand. I didn't change a thing except a little more turkey and a little less potato.  I can't wait to make this again!

This was the first pot pie I've ever made and it was so delicious! I used chicken instead of turkey and store bought crusts. I also used dried basil b/c I didn't have any dried parsley. It was easy to make also! This is a keeper!

Got this recipe out of the Allrecipes cookbook. Usually I like reading reviews before trying a recipe but didn't get around to it. I don't care of celery so instead used 3 small carrots and 4 smallish potatoes to make sure I had enough filling. I followed the rest of the recipe pretty much to a T and it came out delicious!! Now that I've read the reviews, the only thing I'd do different is bake the bottom pie crust for a few minutes before adding the filling. Thanks for a great recipe! My daughter's first exposure to pot pie was a hit!!

Ok recipe, great for left-over chicken or turkey and filling/hearty with the crust, just not enough flavor for us.  A little bland.  Looked pretty.  If I made it again I would spice it up with more oregano, salt, pepper, etc...

In all my years of cooking , I had never made a pot-pie before.  This was DELICIOUS even though I made 2 boo-boos.  Used 1 TBS dried oregano by accident, and just could not get the second frozen crust (GV from W/M) for the top out of the aluminum tin.  By the time I was done piecing together the top, it looked like it was rubber cemented together!!!  The frozen Pillsbury crust I used for the bottom fit nicely in my 9-inch Pyrex pie plate.  So did the filling—used 3/4 cup carrot, 1 cup celery, and 12 oz. (by weight) of Yukon gold potatoes (after peeling).  Kept all the rest of the ingredient amounts as written.  It was a bit sweet, so if I use Yukon gold potatoes next time, I would decrease them to about 10 oz., and increase the turkey and celery slightly.  VERY, VERY GOOD,

This was very good. I didn't follow exact measurements, just kept adding veggies until it looked like enough. I also added some frozen peas and a can of cream of chicken soup. It made enough for 2 pies! I was surprised though, that as soupy as it seemed it held together like there wasn't any gravy at all! I would have preferred a little more gravy but the flavour was excellent!

I was looking for a recipe for ground turkey, so I gave this a try.  It was awesome!  We all loved it!

I made the following changes (as recommended) Instead of celery, I added a can of green beans.
Instead of water and bouillon, I used 1 can of chicken broth.
I used a pound of ground turkey (not cubed).

I call this a "pot dirtier", but it was well worth it.  Great flavor, baked beautifully!

I really loved this recipe. I added some turkey gravy to the filling before putting the pastry topping on...just to add some moisture.  What an excellent way to use Thanksgiving leftovers.

I have used this recipe so many times. Love it. WAY better than boring turkey soup! I do add something green...either chopped green beans or peas, and I use half heavy cream and milk. Other than that, perfection!

Tasted great!! I actually used less butter than called for, used smoked turkey leftovers and added about 1 cup of frozen peas.  The smoked turkey flavor in the pot pie was amazing!

Yum!  Great recipe!  I made a couple of alterations. I added leftover string beans & broccoli from our Thanksgiving dinner. I also added the leftover gravy to the roux mixture.. I only used one top crust. This was amazing. When we were done with dinner, my husband went and finished off the rest of the casserole!  This will definitely be a go to for leftover turkey or chicken.

Delicious! I made it the first time with leftover turkey from thanksgiving and it has since become my go-to for chicken pot pie (I rarely use turkey outside of November:) I still make as written except 3/4 can cream of mushroom soup & I bake the bottom crust first. Time savers: use store bought rotisserie chicken/turkey and Yukon gold potatoes...you don't have to peel them. Thanks for the great recipe!

I doubled the milk and flour (forgot to add the butter to the turkey but in the end I didn't miss it at all), used 2 cups of turkey, and pre baked the crust for 5 min (although I'm not sure that was necessary).  Once everything was mixed together I found it quite bland so I added poultry seasoning and more salt and pepper until I liked the taste.

Great recipe! I followed someone else's recommendation to par-bake the lower crust, which worked wonderfully.  I ended up with a thick filling with excellent body, which is what I wanted..  My only variations were using one large sweet potato (kids won't eat white ones) and sauteeing frozen mixed veggies (corn, peas, carrots) along with the onion and celery, since I was out of fresh carrots and wanted to up the vegetables a bit. I also added a glug of white wine to the cooking vegetables, and some thyme as well.  It was savory, flavorful, and very hearty. I'll definitely make it again, most likely with chicken.

I made this today! I loved it but tweaked it. I had two cups of very yummy gravy leftover from Christmas dinner so I added that to the mixture once it was done for more sauce and flavour. Also added an extra 1/2 tsp of oregano, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 2 tsp parsley and 1 can of peas as I had no frozen ones. Sauteed some mushrooms with the onion, celery & carrots. Made an amazing pot pie that my family will be enjoying later tonight on a cool snowy night. Thank you!

A very hearty recipe.  In addition, I added minced garlic with the onions, thyme with the oregano and a light layer of Parmesan cheese at the top of my filling before placing the top pie crust.  Both thyme and Parmesan cheese complement the flavor of potatoes and poultry.  The filling is a bit runny at first, but the next day, it thickened up.  I'll have to tweek the amount of liquid and flour I use.  Still, it's a mouth watering recipe.

Yummy!!  We made some changes due to what we had on hand.  We used the onion and celery, but used mixed veggies (carrots, corn and peas) instead of the carrots.  We also omitted the potatoes and cut the water down to 1 1/2 cups (since no potatoes to help soak up the water :).  We also added some rosemary and sage per another reviewer's suggestion.  We used pie crust on the bottom and crescent roll crust on the top.  We made individual pot pies.  Yummy!!  My DH thought these were amazing.  I think I've found a new post thanksgiving tradition :)

My family loved this and I will definitely make it again.  It had a really good flavor and plenty of sauce.  I like that it uses fresh carrots, celery and onion instead of the usual frozen carrots and peas.

This was a really easy basic recipe and a great way to use up left overs after Thanksgiving.  I tweaked it the following ways:  did not make a crust - instead used leftover stuffing on the top and covered that with a crust of mashed potato. Did not include potato in the mix since it had mashed topping but included extra veg such as broccoli, cauliflower and zucchini in mix.  Used only 2 tablespoons of flower and the consistency was fine.  Didn't have any chicken boullion cubes on hand so used vegetable and topped it up with a chicken Knorr stock pot.  It didn't require salt as the bouillion and stock pot are quite salty to begin with but it did need black pepper.  The husband loved it.

I tripled the recipe since i had 6 pie shells, it came out really good, put some red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit. Should have read the reviews about the baking of the pie shell for 10 mins, oh well  still came out really good, will make again, right after thanksgiving 2011.

Loved this dish!  I especially love the fresh vegetables rather than the frozen mixed veg in most recipes.  Followed directions except left out the oregano (personal preference) and this was super good.

This recipes was great.  The flavor was amazing and was not swimming in gravy.  I don't even like pot pie and loved this one.  I would recommend it, but warning it does take a long time to make especially if you make and roll out a crust from scratch.

WOW! This was excellent. The only thing I substituted was greens peas for the celery. My husband and I liked it so much, we went back for seconds, which we rarely do! So much tastier than the pre-made frozen variety. Will definitely be making this again.

I added corn instead of celery since that's what I had on hand.  Used the dough recipe from the Ultimate Turkey Pot Pie recipe.  Turned out wonderfully.  Be sure to bake the bottom crust ahead of time (400 about 10 minutes worked for me.)

Better than Thanksgiving dinner itself.  As did many, I tweeked it a little by using cream, and instead of the oregano & parsley I used poultry spice (don't be shy).  My husband really wanted peas in it, but green beans was all I had and it was still a delicious mix.  Next try I want to see if sweet potatoes will work and maybe even stuffing.  OOOOh, drooling now.

Good base, but lacking flavor. I even added sage and rosemary and a bit of turkey gravy mix.   Also, I microwaved my potatoes for 4 minutes before adding them to the other veggies and I'm glad I did b/c they were nice and soft and the carrots could have used a few more minutes.

Great Recipe!!  I made a few changes to the recipe.  I added 1 cup of milk and 4 tablespoons of flour to the Turkey mixture.  It turned out fabulous!  Very creamy, not dry at all.  My husband said this one was a keeper.

First ever pot pie completely from scratch and the family loved it.  I doubled the butter, flour and milk and baked the crust a little prior to filling as per the other suggestions.  Added salt to taste.  Will make again.

Great recipe... just what I was looking for.  This was a last minute decision so I had to use what I had on hand. I didn't have carrots, so I used peas and corn. I used my left-over gravy from thanksgiving and a little turkey spice rub I had. It turned out wonderful!!!!  Thank you!!!

This recipe was outstanding!  I used leftover chicken from the Rosemary Roasted Turkey recipe on allrecipes.  I also substituted canned turkey gravy for the water, boullion, and flour.  Just quicker and easier.  Even my picky, picky eater ate it and said, "not bad".

This is delicious, however it is a bit time consuming and uses a ton of pots to make.  However, it's a great way to use up leftover turkey (in fact you could just say it was chicken!).

This was really good.  I substituted frozen peas for the celery.  Added them at the end with the turkey.  I also added additional chicken stock to thin out the mixture.

Flavor was excellent! I wish I would've doubled the gravy portion, as others had suggested. I thought it looked soupy when pouring it into the crust, but it dried up while baking. I'll def make it again, tho!!

I added a few things to this recipe. To the vegetable mixture you sautee, I also added 1 tsp minced garlic, 1/2 tsp sage, & 1/4 tsp thyme. I also increased the turkey amount to 2 cups. I also cheated & used a premade refrigerated pie crust. Delicious!!! This is definitely something I will make again!

I used leftover chicken from a beer can grilled/smoked bird which was very flavorful, frozen mixed veggies, and added mushrooms. Pre-baked deep dish bottom crust and used rolled crust for the top. Very good.

I was EXTREMELY unhappy with this recipe.  Not because of the taste because although a little bland the filling tasted fine and would have probably gotten a 4 star rating on its own, however this made so much filling I didn't have enough pie crusts so I put it in the fridge for a day and a half and when I took it out to use it, it had a gross sour taste to it like it had gone bad.  I wanted to make a bunch of pies and freeze them but instead ALL of it was wasted and I was so disappointed.  I won't make it again if it goes bad that quickly.

I made this with a butter pie crust recipe.  I was so close to using cream of mushroom but DO NOT do this!  Instead of milk I used 1/3 cu. of half & half - it turned out awesome.  I didn't have potatoes or celery either... I just added one sweet onion, corn, peas and carrots and seasoned with celery seed.  Great basic recipe! I will definitely make this again next winter :-)

My husband & 14 year old son go crazy for t his recipe!  I'm lucky to get a full serving! Have made this a few times.  I freeze leftover turkey, 2 cups per bag, just for this recipe. We do like a little more saue so I add either some turkey gravy or a bit of cream of chicken soup & a touch of poultry seasoning. Pre-baking the bottom crust for 5 minutes or so is also something I recommend. Ultimate comfort food.

Bottom line up front: This was very, VERY good. I will definitely make this again, even though it does take some time and effort to put together.   I followed some of the advice I found in other reviews: I doubled the flour, butter and milk to avoid dryness; I decreased the amount of oregano by about half and added about half a teaspoon each of rosemary, sage and thyme (all dried); I added frozen peas (peas are a MUST in a pot pie, if you ask me); I decreased the potatoes by about half; and I used a puff pastry top crust and no bottom crust because I don't generally like a bottom crust anyway.  Having never worked with puff pastry before, I had to ask around to find out how much to thaw from the frozen package. It turns out that one "standard" size sheet of puff pastry will pretty much cover a 13X9 casserole dish, with just a little bit of rolling or creative cutting/stretching. I placed the pastry directly on the topping with no pre-baking, and I baked it for about 30 minutes at 400.  I did make one mistake with the puff pastry: I tried to get fancy with cut-out shapes instead of just cutting some slits in the sheet. I used a rolling cookie cutter and then placed the shapes on top of the filling, thinking it would look pretty when it was done. I didn't realize that the cookie cutter I used was way too detailed and we wouldn't be able to tell what the shapes were supposed to be by the time it was cooked! Tasted GREAT, but next time I'll do a lattice!

This recipe is perfect.  I did the filling exactly as said.  It's like your classic pot pie comfort food.  I put dumplings on mine instead of the pie crust.  So good!

I am giving this only 4 stars because I think the quantity of parsley is WAY over what it should be. I only added 2 T and it was more than adequate. I also switched out the veggies to 1 small can of whole corn and 1 regular can of peas for personal preference. Probably would only use 1/2 to 3/4 of a can of peas next time. Overall, excellent flavor, just watch it with the parsley.

This pot pie turned out fantastic despite just using a store bought crust.  I cut back to one potato, one small sweet potato and a handful of brown mushrooms; I used fresh parsley and had some chicken stock handy so used that instead of water and boullion.  Other then that I pretty much followed the recipe.  Yum! Thanks for a great one!!

I love this recipe and make it for everyone, especially if I'm trying to show off my cooking skills.  I sub turkey for chicken and sometimes I cheat and get the canned chicken.  My favorite crust is Krogers.  It seems to have a little bit better flavor and texture than Pillsbury.

I hope you're sitting down... my husband AND kids went nuts over this. It's perfect as is. I saw a couple people complain that it's bland... I wonder if they are using a premade crust. NEVER, use a premade crust for anything. They're just terrible. It's very simple to make a good crust from scratch.

This was good.  I used the idea of topping with biscuits instead of using pie crust.

This recipe is awesome! Everyone truly loved it and was a great way to use the leftover turkey. I did some changes such as  1 cup of water and 1 cup of chicken broth. I think i will use 2 cups of broth and no water next time. I also add some extra spices such as Lawrey's seasoning salt. I also use a 9' deep dish crust for the bottom and a Pillsbury roll outcrust for the top. I baked the bottom crust for abt 8-10 mins before adding the ingredients.  It was a great recipe !

Really nice taste for a relatively quick and easy weeknight meal. After reading previous reviews I did make some slight changes. 1. I doubled the ingredients for the sauce (the butter flour, and milk), and it was the perfect consistency. 2. I used evaporated milk instead, mostly because I had it on hand and wanted to use it up. Worked great! 3. I baked in a 9x13 pan with just one layer of pie crust over the top. So much easier (and healthier) than using two layers of dough. It needed about an extra 10 minutes of bake time. I left all the essentials the same as the recipe, as you can see, and I was very pleased with the result. It's definitely the best pot pie I've ever cooked, and I really appreciated that it didn't use any cream of whatever soup!

This is the best pot pie recipe I have ever tried.  I double this recipe and my family of 6 takes care of it all, nearly no left overs. The only change that I have ever made is to reduce the amount of parsley.  Three tablespoons seems like WAY too much for me!  I have made this with leftover turkey, chicken, roast beef, and am going to try ham next week.  Delicious.

First time making a pot pie and it turned out great. I made some changes, added some left over cream of mushroom soup, and cream of onion soup, however didn't add the milk, it would of been much better with more liquids.  Also added some left over parboiled potatoes,carrots and celery.

Very good! Made a few modifications to taste but will definitely make again. Used refrigerated pie crust and pre-baked first until lightly brown. Crust was perfect!

I loved this.  I used a marie calendar's pie crust, and subbed grean peas for the celery (my boyfriend doesn't like celery).  The turkey I was using had a maple marinade (left from thanksgiving).  

My boyfriend loved it; he had three slices!  I loved it too.  It was flavorful and a great way to use up some of my leftover turkey.

My husband and I have found a new post-Thanksgiving tradition.  We used this recipe to make individual pot pies in several au gratin dishes we have.  I used tarragon instead of parsley and veggie bouillon instead of chicken because of what I had on hand.  DELICIOUS! We were really pleased with the way this came out.  Definitely a keeper!

A family favorite. Our crucial additions: Stir about a cup of frozen peas into the sauce, and this is KEY for taking this to a new level: Add a good splash of sherry to the sauce - be pretty liberal, about a quarter cup, maybe. On top of that, it's even better if you either melt sliced cheddar or havarti (or any cheese you love, just about) on top just before serving, or place thinly sliced cheese on each plate before serving the pot pie.

I've made this three times and my whole family loves it! The first time was with Thanksgiving leftovers and that was the best time yet, probably because the turkey was seasoned well and I had yummy leftover gravy. 
The second time I used chicken and made the mistake of using a crappy store bought crust. It also seemed "gluey" probably because of step three. The flour just seemed weird.
The third time I used a really nice crust from a health food store and instead of doing step three I made a cream gravy and added it to the turkey instead of flour and milk separately. That one turned out delicious, but still not as yummy as the first. I will make this again, for sure!

Really easy to make which is important to me. I substitute the butter for vegetable oil. What a great way to get rid of celery left over from stuffing the turkey.

This is a delicious option for left over turkey! My husband and I have never made a pot pie. We followed the recipe exact except we added 2 small cans of button mushrooms (drained). We also made our own crust from a recipe on this site but next time we'll use store bought. (The crust was bland.) 

Great recipe!

I liked it so much I made this twice in a week. I did not put it in a pie crust because there was too much to fit in it, I put it in a 9X9 baking dish and put pre-made pie crust on top. It took around 25 minutes to bake. The kids loved it.

This was the first pot pie I've ever made and was a GREAT way to use up leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. I only had a 9" pie pan and used only one medium sized potato. I also didn't have celery but added some frozen peas instead. With these changes, it turned out PERFECT. I will definitely be using this recipe after Thanksgiving again.

I'm not a big pot pie fan, but this was pretty good. I would double the amount of turkey and add some poultry seasoning if I made it again.

We just had this for dinner tonight, definitely a keeper! This recipe is easily adaptable for your family's tastes. I doubled it to make two pies (I have teenage boys :) ) and I added peas, green beans and mushrooms and chopped garlic. I substituted the water and bouillon for turkey stock I had made from my leftover turkey carcass. Instead of doubling the butter and milk I added a can of cream of chicken soup. I think it could have used more gravy, but my guys liked it as it was. Thank you Linda for such a yummy and hearty recipe!

This pot pie is exceptional!  I added cubed acorn squash to the celery/onion/carrot mixture, used store bought pie crust for the bottom and puff pastry for the top----those were the only deviations from the recipe I made.  It was the perfect pot pie consistency for my family's taste.  The seasonings were right on.  Also, simple to make, not as "throw in the pan easy" as the other recipes I've made that use canned ingredients, but the homemade taste can not be beat.  Thank you for the great recipe.  I don't think I'll be saving Turkey Pot Pie for just the weekend after Thanksgiving anymore--we'll make this all during the fall and winter.

This was my first attempt at pot pie and it was the best dish I have ever made!! The pie was gone within minutes and even my 9 yr old daughter loved it. My mom thought it was absolutely delicious. It was easy to make as well the vegetables cooked perfectly.  I will make this all the time to impress!!!!

Outstanding! I followed this recipe, but with a few minor changes. I added a jar of turkey gravy to the milk/flour mix, I added fresh sliced button mushrooms and frozen peas before putting in the oven, and I used refrigerated biscuits on top instead of a pie crust. My husband and my 3 yr old son loved it! I know that if I followed the recipe exactly, it would've tasted just as wonderful!!! This is a MUST do....especially with holiday leftovers!

My family was not nuts about this, but I was! And guess who does the cooking! I would probably add more liquid so it is not so dry, and add a little more spice (husband said it was bland). I used a Pillsbury double crust 9". I used the second crust as the top for the pot pie. It worked perfectly. I thought it was wonderful..

This was a hit with the family.  I doubled the recipe and it made two pies.  We had a full pie as a left over and it was a wonderful treat two days later.  This pie was far better than any frozen pot pie you could ever buy!

I thought this was very tasty... I also added a pinch of sage and rosemary. It would have probably been just as good without my pinch though. It's a little work to make, but well worth it.

I put this in my recipe box last week in anticipation of the inevitable Christmas turkey left-overs! This really was delicious - so hearty, tasty and easy. I forgot to add the flour so the gravy was a little runny (my bad!). I think I would add a can of condensed mushroom soup next time for extra creaminess. I wanted to cut back on calories so I just put a pastry crust on top. Great recipe, Linda! Thanks!

I would have given this 5 stars had the proportions of the ingredients been different.  Next time I would double the amount of turkey and cut in half the amount of potatoes the recipe calls for.  I would also have added a little more of each of the vegetables.  It ended up tasting more like a potato pot pie, then a turkey pot pie, but it was still good.

This was a little labor intensive but worth the work.  The family loved the recipe and gave it thumbs up all around.  I did cut back on the onions since my kids do not like them and only used 1/4 of the onion that I ran through the blender before adding to the recipe.  It still gave it flavor without the kids realizing it was in there.  Good Stuff!

I've made this a couple times now and we love it!  It's simple and so good!  Made it after Thanksgiving for family staying with us with leftovers and everyone wanted the recipe.  I use ready made pie crusts to speed things up.  Definitely in the "favorites" section of my recipes.

My very picky family loved this!  I used left over turkey and left out the onion, due to picky eaters, and used cut up baby carrots.  It was fantastic and I will use this again and again.  I made enough extra pie crust to make a pie, so dinner was easy and wonderful!

If I could I would give this more than 5*.  This was the best thing I have ever made.  Everyone in my family loved it.  It was much easier than I thought it would be to make.  I used chopped chicken tenders because no place where I lived had turkey, even still it was WONDERFUL! Update: this time I added broccoli in with the potatoes and used shredded carrots.  I now use thyme instead of oregano.  I cut way back on the herbs because of my families tastes.  I use a tablespoon of parsley and a teaspoon of thyme.

We loved this recipe. I made some small changes.  I used one can of chicken broth instead of the bouillon & water.  I also used 1 cup frozen corn instead of potatoes and only 2 tablespoons parsley.  I took it out of the oven 7 minutes before the final cooking time and it was cooked enough.  The broth came out thick enough so I don't think it's necessary to add any cream of chicken soup.  This fit perfectly in my glass Pyrex pie dish.

The only change was green beans instead of celery and it came out great! An old Bakers Square pie pan couldn't quite hold all of the filling so I also filled a small (1 quart) glass bowl and topped with a little left over dough. It made for great leftovers the next day. For the crust we used Betty Crocker pre packaged 2 crust mix. It's in a red box.

Love this recipe!  I've made it several times over the years.  Sometimes I buy a chicken at supermarket, have dinner and then have the leftovers to make this pot pie.  Works our perfect.  I've given the recipe to my daughters and many other people.  I do not use the oregano but that is a person preference.

Followed the recipe exactly, and we didn't care for the flavor or the consistency.  I made the crust using No Fail Pie Crust 1 from this site.  The crust was OK but would taste better if I had used butter flavored Shortening. We will likely not make this again, but will try some other recipes on this site for leftover turkey (soups, stews, hash, salad, lettuce cups, chili, etc).

Made this a couple of days after Christmas and wasn't sure picky hubby would eat this........and he loved it! I made 8 individual pies and we are having this for supper tonight. I made stock from the turkey carcass and will use some to make gravy - we both like gravy on this.

This is a great tasting pie! I omitted the broth and flour mixture and used cream of mushroom soup (2 cans) with 1 cup of milk. Also used already boiled potatoes left over from my potato salad so cut time on cooking potatoes. Hubby gives it a thumbs up ??

This was delicious.  My husband said "Home Run".  The only thing I did different was to bake it the entire 35 minutes at 425 degrees.  No soggy crust on the bottom that was reported previously..

Used a cast iron skillet and precooked the bottom crust as someone else mentioned. It came out perfect!!! Definitely adding this to the family favorite rotation.

Took several short cuts by using frozen peas and carrots as well as all chicken broth as opposed to boullion and water.  I also used Pillsbury pre-made crusts and baked it at 350 for about 35 minutes.  It turned out fantastic!

Fabulous recipe!  I bought two frozen 9" pie crusts.  I baked one crust for 8 minutes, as other reviewers suggested.  For the veggies, i used 2 cups of a frozen mix of green beans, carrots, peas, and corn (heated in microwave 1st).  Instead of the 2 cups of water with chicken bouillion, I used 2 cups of leftover turkey gravy.  I used almond milk instead of dairy milk.  Recipe was awesome!!!

A great way to use thanksgiving turkey leftovers! I blended the turkey into small chunks to spread it evenly throughout, and I used a premade pie crust (broke college student on a budget!). I broke the crust into pieces and mixed it in. Delicious!

I made this with what I had on hand. Used ground turkey, pre steamed mixed veggies, turkey gravy and a small amount of mashed potatoes as a thickener. Used Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Baked the bottomed of the crust to as void a soggy crust. There’s only 2 slices left! It was a hit :)

I used chicken stock  I had already.  I used someone's suggestion to slightly cook the carrots first.  I threw in veggies from my fridge like mushrooms and leftover corn.  And I brushed an egg wash for the top crust.

Very easy recipe and very tasty! I love that it’s simple ingredients. It was a great way to use up last years thanksgiving turkey! I ended up doubling the recipe which may contribute to prep time but it did take me more than 20 minutes with all the cutting of veggies. I took a shortcut and got the frozen carrot/pea mixture which helped save some time and added a little extra element to it. I’ll definitely make this again. I followed the recipe to a tee!

overall, really good.  I adjusted the spices like suggested in other reviews (have a salt free penzeys blend, mural of flavor, that we love).  cooked the turkey in with the veggies and just made the gravy by itself.  everything else was the same, and this turned out great. will definitely have it again

A delicious way to use up our Thanksgiving turkey!  I followed the recipe as written, except I subbed leftover roasted vegetable medley ( onion, potatoes, butternut squash, and red pepper) for the vegetables listed.

Thank you Linda for a great recipe.  I love it when people put themselves out there and share a recipe and we get to read how others interpreted it.  What a great resource.
I did some 'adjusting' if you will.  First off, how can you mince onions and not add a couple of cloves of garlic!  I went for the 6 minute pre-cook of the bottom shell and was quickly reminded of pastry 101, it shrinks!  So if you do pre-cook the shell, don't trim off all the edges until you fill it with the goodies.
There were a few comments on it being bland.  Once again, cooking 101, taste for seasoning throughout the process!  I increased the oregano and pepper and snuck in a generous 'sprinkle' of poultry seasoning.  To up the saltiness I used  Costco's Better than Bouillon and sprinkled a little grated Parmesan cheese on top before adding the top shell.  To get a good thick sauce I used my flour shaker over the veggie mix as it was softening.  That with the flour in the turkey (at least 2 cups worth!) did the trick.  Next time I might use a bit more milk.
It was great yesterday and I have to imagine it will be even better the day after

An easy meal that makes a wonderful comfort food.  Varying the recipe is also easy as you can add green beans, corn or whatever other vegetables you like.  The secret is to make the final mixture thick enough before adding it to the pie crust.  You want it so it takes a few seconds to ooze through a slotted spoon.  This will ensure that you don't have a pie that is too runny.

Yummy!! I made it as a casserole using puff pastry. Reduced the amount of potato, almost doubled the amount of turkey, doubled the milk and added a tablespoon+ of Poultry Seasoning. Will definitely be making this again! Will be my go to  after every turkey dinner. The only thing I regret is not saving the turkey gravy to serve with it.

I boiled up the carcass and left over turkey from thanksgiving then took all the fat, skin, and bones out.I used the meat for the pie and the stock from the boiled turkey instead of water and added chicken bouillon cubes to taste. It was delicious, my guests raved over it. I actually tripled the recipe because there was so much meat and froze the extra uncooked pies - they cooked perfect at a later time

This a great starting place for me.  I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and pre-baked my crust for 10 min, it was perfect.  I used the turkey gravy packet for my sauce and did use these spices but doubled.  And my family likes things with more punch so I added a dash of crushed red pepper, good bit of black pepper to gravy and veggie mix. They loved it!

So yummy!! I added peas and a little more turkey than was called for. I took the advice from another review and cooked the pie crust for 10 minutes before adding the ingredients and it came out perfectly. Will definitely make again.

It was simple to do and I added some of the left over green beans. Made more gravy like one of the reviewers recommended. Added some left over white wine and a dash of cayenne pepper and some dried thyme and some fennel salt for another flavor note. It was excellent.

I forgot to pre-bake the crust! You definitely need to do it because the soggy crust will stick to the bottom. Next time I'll prebake. Uggh.

My family and I are addicted to this simple recipe.  I have everything prepared before I assemble my pie.  I keep the recipe just the way it is.  I use my foodsaver and always keep 1 1/2 cups turkey breast on hand.

I made this but with a fee changes. I pretty much doubled the vegies and tripled the meat, also added a cup of frozen peas. Peas made the pie in my opinion. I hate oregano, so I used rosemary and basil in its place and it was fantastic!

I followed the recipe except I used a 9 inch pie shell from Tenderflake instead of making my own.  Much easier!  But this was a fun, easy recipe to follow, and assuming you have left over turkey, you`re sure to have all other ingredients you need too.

I made slight changes since I didn't have chicken bouillon.  I used a cup of water and a can of progresso chicken noodle light soup.  2 tsp sage, 1 tsp garlic, 1 tsp poultry seasoning, and 1 tsp basil were also added.  I didn't use celery but added French beans instead since that was what was in my fridge. I also only used 2 potatoes since the soup had noodles. Yum!

The first time I made this it seemed a little complicated but my husband loved it so I tried it again. It's simple once you get the hang of it and you can add different veggies or more or less of whatever you like. We add peas instead of celery and double up the recipe so there's plenty to share.

This pot pie was excellent.  I used smoked turkey left over from the holidays, added one more carrot and green peas.  The peas were added along with the turkey mixture to the vegetable mixture.  Also, the pie crust started to brown after 5 minutes in the oven, so I topped it with foil.  Overall, this pot pie was delicious and worth saving.

"Best pot pie you've ever made!"  according to my 19 yr old daughter. I used chicken, because that's what I had. I'm sure it would've been just as tasty with turkey. Followed recipe as stated, besides the meat switch. I didn't see anything needing to be changed.

Yes, loved it, I used mushrooms since we didn't have potatoes, I had some extra homemade crust that I used to make the pie.  however we all agreed that we you could also do this local-style over rice.

Great way to use leftover turkey! Made it with the following adjustments: used only1-1.5 potatoes, added a carton of fresh mushrooms, instead of making broth I used 2 cans condensed chicken soup and 1 can chicken broth; used Pilsbury pie crust and baked bottom crust first for 6 min; didn't leave pie in much longer after the first 20 mins of baking time.

Delicious! My family devoured this recipe. I made my own crust with a recipe from the site, and it turned out great.  I used a little more carrot and potato than it calls for and left out the celery, because I didn't have any. A great way to use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey!

I used sweet potato instead of white and thickened the gravy a bit more. I will make this again and add bigger chunks of turkey and the vegetables as well as a little more seasoning.

I would change the Oregano for Sage....but that's just me.  And I actually like Oregano!  Just doesn't seem right with turkey, to me.

I added more turkey and sweet peas. I used vegetable bouillon, because I did not have chicken bouillon cubes. It came out wonderful, very tasty. Everyone had seconds. The recipe is enough for two pies. What a great way to use leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.

I made this recipe with leftover crockpot turkey breast, used double the meat because that is what I had left. Also used only one potato finely diced and added 1 cup of frozen peas. Turned out great. Seasonings as listed were perfect with my already seasoned leftover turkey. Thanks!

Love this recipe! It makes enough for 2 pies so I always save the filling and make the second pie the next day! Only thing I like to do different in add 1 more cup of milk and extra flower of thicken up.

Delicious! I made this exactly as written except I added a bit of poultry seasoning to the filling.  I also baked it a total of 60 minutes (10 at 425, 50 at 350).

Flavor was really good. I did have to add a lot more milk/cream to it and the crust absorbed most of the gravy.  I would make it again but use way more cream and milk.

I really like this. I only changed it by using a can of chicken stock and water to make 2 cups. I wish I'd thought to add some peas and green beans also. Peas are in the picture here, but not in the recipe. Still very good. Will make again, with more vegetables :)

This is a delicious recipe! I've never made a pot pie before this, and it is the best one I've ever had. I used a simple recipe for a homemade crust of 1.5 c flour, .5 c oil, 2 tsp sugar, .5 tsp salt, 2 tbsp milk. This mixes right in the pan and I press out with my fingers. I then make another recipe for the top and press it out on wax paper before I put it on top of the pie.

I really liked this recipe....although I changed it to meet my needs.  I was out of potatoes, but had leftover mashed potatoes.  I used them instead of the top crust, like a shepherd's pie.  The filling is great--especially if you don't have gravy and don't used canned cream soups.

This was a fantastic recipe!!! I am a firm believer in trying the recipe as stated.  They almost always need adjustment for taste. I am not a big fan of oregano but still made the original recipe.   This was a great recipe first time around and is an excellent base recipe. You can change things, add or take things out depending on taste.   Absolutely a keeper!!!

This was my first time making any pot pie and it came out perfect! I followed the recipe exactly and and even the harshest critic gave me thumbs up. I will definitely make this again and next time may throw the bottom crust in for a few minutes first but other than that the recipe was perfect.

Was a very tasty dish! I replaced one cup of water with cream of chicken soup and boiled potatoes separately otherwise followed the rest of the recipe and it made two pies for me! Very happy with results! I also used store bought pastry shells and it was a very good result. Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe is really easy, delicious and so adaptable to your family's tastes.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and loved the results.  The next time I cut back on the carrots and celery then added peas and substituted chicken for the turkey.  It was also great!  This will become a winter staple for my family.

Fabulous recipe!  I had ZERO leftovers.  I didn't have bullion, so I used homemade chicken broth in place of the water and I added some rosemary, which put this recipe over the top!  Bravo!

So simple and so tasty! I modified and used stock instead of bullion and improvised with the herbs, using ground coriander, cumin, thyme, and rosemary and used garlic as someone recommended also. I can't wait to make this again with chicken. A new staple in my kitchen!

I just made this yesterday and it was REALLY good.  I had some canned cream of celery soup leftover in the frig and I used that instead of the milk and it gave it really nice flavor.  I'm going to keep this and use it for leftover chicken.  Very very good

I made this last night.  Great recipe.  My changes are to use chicken stock instead of water, cut the parsley in half and this can all be done in one pot.  Otherwise a great tasting recipe!

I used a homemade biscuit topping -Basic Biscuit recipe on this site -instead of the pie crust and it worked fine. I found it needs more flour than called for- it was more runny than I prefer for pot pie. The taste was good. I did add some garlic powder also

The featured photograph shows the recipe filling with peas, however, the author forgot to add peas to the recipe.  Without them, the filling is quite brown in appearance and not nearly as appetizing but the flavor is great.  I added some frozen peas at the end and it both looked at taste wonderful to my husband.  Be liberal on the salt as the potatoes will absorb quite a bit of it.

So glad to have something without "soup".  Easy and great flavor.  Made a double batch for my son and his college friends.  Nothing left over.  I used chicken instead of turkey.  Boiled 4 chicken breasts in water and used water for broth.

This is a fantastic recipe! I will definitely make it again. :) I made a few alterations: 1) I omitted the oregano - did not have any on hand, 2) I used the pie crust only on top (to save valuable calories) ... in my opinion, this did not affect the taste one bit! 3) Instead of making one big pie, I made 6 individual pies in small glass pie pans (freezing two of them for later). I would recommend this recipe. Thank you for sharing!

Turned out great! Used frozen veggies instead of carrots, half the chicken stock and added cream of mushroom soup and a bit of heavy cream in the veggies. Baked the bottom crust (homemade) first. A huge hit!

Delicious flavor.  Mine was a little loose, but I also had to leave it in the oven on warm to eat after my daughters' gymnastic class, so that may have had an effect.

followed the recipe to the T except for i prebaked the bottom crust for 5 min to make it crispier. filling looked a little thin before it went in the oven, but it tasted good and i figured it would thicken as it cooked from the flour. made it in an extra deep pie pan. came out golden brown and perfect. let sit for abt 10 min pulled out of the oven before digging in! whole family LOVED it! tastes just like grammas used to!

OMG, this was a last minute meal idea and my family LOVED it!  If I wasn't already the mayor in my house this would have won me the election, LOL.  The entire pie was gone in less than 60 seconds, no seriously good enough to be served and happily received in a restaurant.  I changed the recipe a little, like I said, last minute deal so I had to use what I had in the kitchen.  So I added 1.5 cups milk more than called for so it was more creamy and I didn't have chicken broth so I used a bullion cube and sauteed my frozen mixed vegetables in it to make a stock.  Yummie!

This was very good, my first attempt at a pot pie. I used pre-made pie crust, half and half instead of milk and used 2 cups turkey, 3 Tbsp butter on gravy step, 3/4 cup half and half and 4 1/2 Tbsp flour. Will make again!

This was an excellent recipe and definitely one of my favorite meals.  I followed the recipe to the T and used only frech ingredients.  I did make extra sauce, about 1/2 again what the recipe stated for an extra creamy pie.  Yum!

This is the best Turley Pot Pie Ever!!!  The only change I made was I mixed a little left over turkey gravy with the vegitable mixture.  It made it very moist and gave it a very good flavor.

A bit disappointed. There wasn't enough gravy and the parsley was a bit overpowering. If I were to make again, I would definitely double up on the gravy and reduce the parsley.

It was a great recipe, my husband ate 3 helpings, but it was a little on the dry side to me. I used a frozen deep dish pie shell and a pre-made pie crust as the topper and it ended up making two pot-pies, which is perfect because now I have a pot-pie in the freezer for another dinner night! Thanks for the recipe!!

Fantastic meal! I made one for the family to try and they loved it. I've used this recipe over and over again.  I did however had to add a bit more milk so it wasn't so thick.

Delicious basic recipe. Used 2 cups of leftover turkey broth instead of bouillon. I used fresh parsley,  left out the oregano and used thyme instead. I would add more milk and flour for a thicker and creamier a consistency next time. And there will be a next time!

You know it's good when you are thinking about a second helping and you are not even halfway through your first one yet.  Our entire family loved this recipe.  We substituted left-over mashed potatoes for cubes potatoes since that was all we had on hand.  It was still delicious.  This will now be a part of our thanksgiving tradition.

WOW! This was a wonderful recipe to make with our thanksgiving leftovers, something I am always looking for following the holiday. My daughter, home from college, simply loves pot pies, and we made this together. We used my mother's easy pie crust recipe (baking the bottom crust first for about 7 minutes as others recommended), used a cup of leftover turkey gravy with a cup of water, fresh thyme instead of the oregano, and Yukon Gold potatoes. I will certainly keep this recipe for future use, and I would bet my daughter will as well.

Great taste, easy recipe!  Substituted puff pastry for pie crust and it tasted great!  Also used chicken broth instead of bouillon.  Perfect to use up Thanksgiving Day turkey!

Wow. Really simple and delicious. Cook's in a hurry can use frozen mixed veggies and leave the peel on the potatoes for more fiber (some potatoes better than other tastewise for this)

EVERYONE ATE IT ALL UP! :) YUMMY! I did eliminate the oregano and used fresh ground pepper corn flaked instead to please us all. Next time I am going to try yellow corn and fresh green bean pieces in it. Maybe even some Hominy or Okra. :)

I have made this recipe 3 times, and each time it has come out fantastic!!  The first time I made it, it was such a hit, that it has become our traditional leftover turkey recipe ftom Thanksgiving leftovers.  The only changes I made were to cut down on the amount of parsley and oregano, and I add peas to it.    I usually double the recipe, and when doubling, I only use 1T. of parsley and just sprinkle a little bit of oregano, probably about 1/4 tsp.  Last time I made it, I used chicken instead of turkey, and it's good, too, but the turkey one has so much more flavor!!

I did not have enough pie crust to do a bottom and top layer, so I simply used 1 and put it right on top of my filling in a casserole dish..turned out great and the kids liked it allot too!

This is a great, basic turkey pot pie.  I followed the recipe exactly, but had to substitute chicken broth for the water/bouillon, and it still came out well.  Hearty, warm and comforting.  That said, I found the recipe somewhat bland.  Kids would probably love it; it doesn't overstimulate the taste buds or have any "weird" flavors.  However, I would have loved more veggies in mine, and will probably add frozen peas, broccoli and perhaps some cheese or cumin the next time I cook this.

I’m giving this recipe 5 starts as is, and also for it’s versatility. I’ve made it countless times over the last 4 years as is, using chicken, and other slight variations. Last night I completely digressed from the recipe using whatever I had on hand, which was: baked chicken, carrots, celery, peas, corn, napa cabbage, a combo of veg & beef broth, and soy milk. I threw in a bunch of random seasonings, poured the mixture in a greased pyrex, topped with leftover mashed potatoes, baked at 400 for 20 min, and it turned our great! You really can’t go wrong with this recipe. It’s great as is, or use it to clean out your fridge.

Ok, this one is a tough one to rate. I loved it, and I would give it a 5 and make it every year w/my leftover turkey. My husband..well, when I told him what was for dinner, he was less than enthused. He ate it w/o complaint, didn't get seconds and said no to wrapping up the leftovers (both are indicators on how well he likes something since he never tells me). So, I guess I have to give it a four..only because he (and my 7yr old) didn't care for it....but I loved it.

YUM!  I've made this dozens of times now and it is one of my husband's favorites!  I don't use as much of the parsley and oregano and usually substitute the bullion and water w/chicken broth.  I also add turnip and peas and bake it in a small roasting pan and add refrigerated biscuits the last 20 mins.

Delicious way to use leftover Thanksgiving turkey! Instead of running to the store for the ingredients I didn't have (carrots & celery), I substituted frozen peas. I also used chicken stock instead of bouillon and sprinkled in a half packet of brown gravy mix. For the pastry, I used NEVER FAIL PIE CRUST II by Mary Roahrig and halved the recipe for this pie. Hubby said it was the best meal I have made and my 1yr old ! As this was my first attempt making a pot pie and pie crust from scratch, I thought it was simple to make and full of flavor. I will be making this again!

Instead of the water and buillon, I added a can of chicken broth and mushroom gravy. I also added peas and corn. This came out AMAZING! I've made it several times and have received rave reviews.

I don't have ten a inch pie pan, so I wound up getting two pies out of this recipe.  I had to make some extra pie crust, but, hey, I got two pies for the price of one!  I gave the extra pie to a neighbor.  I added some oregano to my pie crust recipe, just to make it look pretty, and it did.  I also used ground turkey.  The only problem that I had with this recipe is that there really wasn't any sauce.  Maybe that's because there's a bottom crust, and it would get soggy?  I'm not sure.  But, most pot pies that I've seen have sauce, usually a white, creamy sauce.  Even the pot pie that's typically served around here (we have a lot of PA Dutch cooking in my area) has a thick, broth based sauce.    I would a call it a Turkey Pie rather than a Turkey Pot Pie.  Still, this was very good and had excellent flavor.

Good stuff. I used chicken broth instead of the water with chicken bouillon.

This potpie is excellent! The whole family devoured it in one sitting! Only changes were to the veggies - used frozen veggie mix, with the fresh onion, celery, and potato (only 1 potato!). It has great flavor without overpowering the turkey & veggies. It also tastes great w/ chicken. I do recommend sprinkling a little salt and pepper on the top crust for a nice touch!

A little labour intensive for me, but SO worth it!!  It tasted out of this world!!  Even my kids had a second helping, that NEVER happens!!!  I did reduce the parsley and oregano a bit, and pre-baked the bottom crust for about 5 minutes. But other than that, followed the recipe to a T. I can't wait to make it again!!

I never made a pot pie before because I thought it would be ALOT of work...frozen pie crust save me from that. This was the best thing I've ever made with leftover turkey. I can't wait to try it with chicken so I don't have to cook a whole a turkey!

Great! Added 1 C fzn peas, 1 nuked potato instead of 3, 1/2 tsp. oreg. 1/2 C broth and 1/2 C leftover gravy.  Used crust recipe found on this site (2 C flr, 1 tsp. salt 1/2 c. crisco & 1/2 c. btr, 1/2 c. cold water).  Be sure to chill EVERYTHING for crust. I froze enough for 2 of us to eat later. It came out wonderful.

I too changed a few things based on other recommendations. First I used morningstar chikin strips as turkey sub as I'm vegi. I did a homemade crust and PREBAKED for 7 min. I also let filling misture cool for at least 10-15 min. before filling crust. As far as broth, I used one 14 oz can and 2 oz of water (for conven.). The butter, flour, milk part: I increased butter/flour and also added 1 C of whole milk; I'd increase milk even more next time to have more of a gravy texture as cooked meal was solid. I skipped the pie top and replaced with Stouffers Turkey stove top where I'd added walnuts, onions, and celery. Don't use pie plate. I used a 13x9. It was perfect. Family of four will finish it tonight as somewhat of a side dish as we did consume more than half last night!

This is great comfort food.  I made the recipe as written, though I did prebake the crust as someone mentioned.  Next time I think I'll increase the sauce ingredients as I prefer turkey pot pie with a little more gravy.  Thanks for the recipe.  This is a keeper!

This pie, though very labor intensive, look beautiful when it came out of the oven.  Unfortunately it didn't taste as good as it looked.  The oregano was overwhelming and that was really the only thing we could taste.  Won't make it again.

My family loved this! The fact that a vegetarian can cook a meal this good (since I cant taste it) just proves this is a fool proof recipe. I made the following changes: 1. Added a heaping teaspoon of fresh garlic to cooking vegetables 2. Added a tablespoon of "better than bouillon" to turkey mixture prior to adding it to the veggies 3. Doubled the milk and used a can of chicken stock and did not add any water 4. I only added half the oregano 5. Added about 1/2 cup of peas 6. Only used 2 potatoes 7. My family does not like onions so I only used half a small onion and really diced it small before I sauteed it 8. I added about 1/2 tablespoon of Chicken Seasoning. 9. I used an 8x8 glass pyrex dish. 10. I cooked the bottom pie crust (the store brand pie crust in the frig section of the store) for 11 mins at 350 before filling it. Phew-that was a lot, but this recipe is worth the effort!

This was excellent prepared as is.  I only added a can of sliced mushrooms, since we like them.  The quantity of filling for a deep dish pie plate was perfect.  It was definitely plenty of "gravy" without being so much that it bubbled out while baking.  Definite keeper!

My whole family LOVED this! I used up the rest of the Thanksgiving turkey and no one was the wiser. I substituted
the 2 c water+ bouillon for 1 can of chicken broth and I added some granulated garlic as well. It was delicious! For the crust, I used the Walmart generic brand of refrigerated double pie crust...it was easy and it came out beautifully. Thanks for an awesome recipe that I will make again and again!

This was very good.  I did a few things different because my cooked turkey was a little frozen and I cannot use boullion.
I boiled a wing and thigh with celery,carrots,a bay leaf, parsley and a little salt.  I was making some stock while cooking the turkey a little more.
I then followed the steps to the letter but used the stock I made and a little gravy to thicken it a bit. This also saves time cooking seperate carrots and celery that you will use.  Less dishes too.
This was very good. I also made the dough for the crust the night before. I rolled it only when I was ready with the turkey.
Very good.

Made four days after Thanksgiving to use up all that leftover turkey.  Probably the best pot pie I've ever had - I'm not a big pot pie person. Will keep for next year.  Thanks for sharing!

I used the leftover turkey from Thanksgiving 2008. Added soy sauce, chicken concentrate (to make broth), used green peppers instead of celery, added salt & pepper, dash cumin and oregano and it was a total hit! Everybody loved it.

Really REALLY good!!!!  I used up the last of our leftover Thanksgiving turkey and everyone loved it!  The only change I made was to bake the bottom pie crust for about 5-10 minutes first just to make sure it wouldn't be soggy.  I may have to roast a turkey again just so I can have this.  :)  (or maybe I'll use a chicken next time....)

This is absolutely fantastic. I doubled it and made 2 pies as I had a bunch of carrots, celery and half a turkey left. We ate half the first pie for dinner, then ate the rest of the first for breakfast today. And I'm still not sick of it! For the 4 cups water, I used 1 cup chicken broth and 3 cups of water. I also added some turkey gravy into the mix. Aside from that, I followed the recipe exactly. I'm freezing the rest of our turkey so I can make this again. Perfect!

I never had much luck with pot pie recipes until now.  This recipe is wonderful.  My entire family loved it, and it is super easy.  It has become our day after Thanksgiving meal tradition.

This was very good.  This dish helped me to use the leftover Thanksgiving turkey and I'm so happy I prepared this pot pie!  I diced carrots, potatoes, onions, celery & added frozen string beans.  I modified it by adding a can of cream of chicken soup.  I also baked the bottom crust for 15 minutes at 350 prior to adding the filling.  I think this helps eliminate soggy crust.  Very good, I will definitely make this dish again!  Everyone here loves pot pie and this was a healthier alternative to frozen pot pie.

This pot pie was good, but sort of bland.  I ended up adding cayenne pepper and a little crab boil to the boiling veggies, which helped a lot.  Instead of a pastry crust, I used biscuits, which by the way, cook VERY quickly on this pie!  If I would have baked the whole time on 350, it probably would have been better, but that's a user error, I guess.  Also, it made WAY too much filling and I ended up overfilling my pie plate, and burning some on the bottom of my oven.  Oh well, self-cleaning ovens are great for that reason!

This recipe is awsome!! Even my picky 3 year old loved it. I did make a few changes, I diden't have any celery, so I used celery salt, added a little garlic powder, fresh parsley, frozen peas, corn, and green beans. Added them right before I added the chicken mixture to the carrots. I also added about 2 TB of flour, because we like our with a thicker juice. Great recipe, we love it!

Very good.  My boyfriend and I like a little more sauce than it make, so we just added a can of store-bought chicken gravy.  I would make these again.

Loved it!  However I did add poultry spice to taste. I love the taste of sage with my turkey so I liberally used the poultry spice. Oh and I just kinda used whichever of the veggies I had on hand. It turned out awesome!

So Delicious! I didn't change the recipe much.  I added a can of peas. I used fresh parsley instead of dry and I also added some fresh sage and some dry thyme.  I used pre-made pie dough. The Pilsbury kind you find on the isle with the biscuits(not the frozen stuff).  It turned out flaverful and moist. Perfect. My husband ate half the pie in one night. I will definately be making this again.

This reciped was awesome. I had tons of leftover turkey and this worked great. I actually made it twice in one week because my husband loved it so much. I made simple changes to adjust for what i had in the pantry. I prefer pot pies without potatoes so i omitted that. i also had no bouillon, so i used 1 can of chicken broth and omitted the water. it was the best pot pie we have ever tried!!

This was the first pot pie I've ever made and it turned out really well.  I increased the milk and flour in the turkey gravy by 50% and could have done more.  This was a perfect Sunday dinner with Thanksgiving leftovers.

I made this for the first time in my life, and I must say I was very proud at the dinner table! My family kept on with the compliments! I even made the crust from scratch! I didn't have celery on hand so I threw in fresh broccoli, and also a few cloves of fresh garlic. Delicious!

Soo good. I didn't have any turkey on hand so I browned a pound of ground venison and used that instead. I left everything else the same and didn't have any problems with the crust being soggy, the filling not thick enough or the flavor being too bland. I'll definitely use this again.

Made two of these after Christmas dinner.  I'm ready to make another turkey just to make this again.  I used a sour cream pastry, and the best part is being able to throw in whatever vegetables you have around.  This is a definite make again recipe.  This was amazing!  Linda, thank you for sharing.

Really good recipe but I did make a few changes. I was pressed for time so I used frozen veggies (peas,carrots and green beans mix) along with the fresh potatoes, onion and celery.  Also substituted  chicken broth for more flavor. It turned out perfectly.  Definitely a keeper!

My picky children loved it and wanted more. Just remember to start early because it takes time to make.

This smelled great cooking and tasted delicious.  My husband loved it.  It was a good way to get vegetables in my kids age 5.  We had half leftover and heated it 2 minutes in the microwave for dinner the next day.  I will definitely be making this again.  It's a keeper for sure.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!! I just used store-bought crusts and it was still amazing. I've already made it 2 or 3 times.

A VERY good pie.  I gave some folks some LEFTOVERS, and they loved it!  The filling is very tasty.
