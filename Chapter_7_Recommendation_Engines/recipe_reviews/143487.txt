I made this recipe without any variations.  It is promising enough that I will try variations in the future but I will not be making it exactly the way the recipe reads again.

The flavor was only just okay.  Though of course this is highly dependent on the quality of fruit you use so maybe I'll try again later in the summer when I can get better peaches.  Also, I think that orange juice may not be the optimal choice of liquid for this recipe... I found that it really overwhelmed the peach flavor.

Also, plan to eat this straight from churning because if you try to "harden" it first (as most ice cream maker instructions will advise you to do) it develops a really icy texture.  Right after churning it has the beautifully silky, smooth consistancy that I want from sorbet.  My guess would be that there may be a little too much water (from the juice) in the recipe so the freezing temperature of the sorbet is too high.  Less juice might result in a smoother consistancy after hardening.

This was wonderful.  I blanched the peaches briefly in boiling water to make them easier to peel.  I pureed the strawberries by themselves first, then pressed them through a sieve to remove the seeds (DH doesn't like the seeds).  I used a bit more strawberries than the recipe called for, probably closer to 2 cups, but I lost some of them by sieving them.  The sorbet came out great.  I love sorbet and now I won't have to spend a fortune for it at the grocery store.  Thanks Austin!

This was a very good sorbet recipe.  I made it with my friend, and we used half of the amount of sugar called for because the fruit that we used was very ripe.  It turned out great, except that it could have been a bit icier.  We also used a blender instead of a food processor and it turned out fine.  I'll definitely make this again, and maybe experiment with some different fruits.

While it was very easy to make it left me wanting something "tasty".  The oj seem to overpower the whole thing.

Delicious. Tastes like frozen summer. I have a ton of fresh-frozen peaches in the freezer, and I'll be making this all winter.

As other reviewers stated, the OJ really overpowered the taste.   Also, don't know if the brown sugar really added anything- standard sugar would work just as well.
