I am born and raised in Buffalo, NY and this is not the best recipe for wings.  REAL wings use only equal parts of Frank's Hot Sauce (no substitites allowed) and butter for mild sauce.  That's it - just Franks and butter.  To make them hotter, increase the amount of Franks.  This is how the best pizzarias make them in Buffalo, and for the record, Anchor Bar has good wings but not the BEST wings in Buffalo - there are plenty of neighborhood pizzarias and bars that make way better wings!!  And you coat the wings by swirling them around in a metal mixing bowl with plenty of sauce after they have been fried  - and in Buffalo, they are NEVER NEVER served with ranch dressing - REAL Buffalo wings are served with Blue cheese dressing and celery!!!!

This is my husband's wing recipe, too. Peanut oil is really the only way to go. Crispier wings and the flavor just can't be beat. I don't like wings usually but these are MONEY. Try them for yourself and you'll see.

Oh man!  These were really good.  I pan fried them in about 1/4 inch of peanut oil for 10 minutes per side.  Much better than using an entire gallon of peanut oil and this got the wings good and crispy.

For the sauce, I added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes, which for me left the wings fairly spicy.  This isn't a traditional Buffalo Wing sauce, but is still really good.  I liked the garlic flavor in addition to the heat from the red pepper flakes, Frank's RedHot and black pepper.  I will definitely make these again.

Loved the recipe. @mimihouse27 its very distasteful to make comments on here that are so demeaning. If you really watched the video and read Scotts notes you could comprehend better. He stated the Anchor bar started the wings not the best, he plated with celery and blue cheese not ranch as you claimed. Review the facts and please watch the video again, clearly you missed it meaning you probably didn't follow directions. As you know this is a recipe site however he makes his wings is HIS way. Don't like it just say that and move on.  Scott my daughter loved your wings and thank you for sharing!

Nothing secret about this recipe. I brine my wings for a day, then rinse so the salt content is not high. I use a K.C. rub and  in the smoker for 2 hrs using applewood for smoke. Deep fry @375F for 8-10 minutes and toss is a chili sauce that is low sodium. Frank's is nothing but salt so I make my own sauce or buy a low sodium chili sauce. Now this is a secret, so don't tell anyone

While this is a good basic recipe for Buffalo wings I would tweak the recipe by adding honey. I love the contrast between HOT and Sweet!

To Rich, she never said it was a secret she just mentioned that she never gave out the recipe before.  What is your problem...They tasted wonderful and will make again and again, it is a keeper.  And much easier that your way.

I learned to make wings the same way from a friend who ran a catering business.  I do used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, but the recipe is the same otherwise.  This concoction is a little piece of heaven paired with chunky bleu cheese dressing.  As they say, you can't have just one!  Delicious!

This recipe is pretty basic with most wing cooks.  I on the other hand jazz them up with the Frank's hot sauce, or you can use your favorite.  Add the juice of 1/2 a lemon juice and garlic.  If you want to mello the flavor, add a half a stick of butter. Heat all those ingredients up togetherand pour over the wings when they come out of the peanut oil.  If you really want to have what I call "rip your lips off hot" add a small amount of chilli powder and or cayanne to that mix.  Now your talkin' cookin' HOTWINGS, "GMAN" style.

Now this is how we make wings in Buffalo! Simple cooking method and a few ingredients. Don't forget to serve with blue cheese dressing, my favorite is Marie's, and serve celery sticks.

These are fabulous hot wings - have taken them to several parties and everyone who likes their wings hot enjoyed them. If you do not like them hot, not for you. My son drank 2 glasses of milk after eating them and he never drinks milk.

This is for Tejay.  Although the INGREDIENTS section of the recipe does not mention red pepper flakes the COOK'S FOOTNOTES at the bottom of the recipe does.  It merely is a variation of sauce ingredients you can use to adjust heat level.  Hope this helps.

I thought these wings were great, and so has everyone I've served them to the past few times I've made this. I've never been to Buffalo so don't know what people expect to taste there. I live in SoCal and we have pretty much every kind of wings you could want here. This has a good taste even if it may not be "traditional" as some reviewers have suggested. I make the equivalent of 12 servings which is triple the recipe amount to take to potlucks and parties. The only thing I change as far as ingredient amounts is that for the triple batch I only use 1/2 cup butter. While I cook the wings in a turkey fryer I leave the butter warm on the stove with the granulated garlic, pepper and red pepper mixed in to help the flavors combine even more before adding the Frank's and tossing with the wings. The recipe is easy and delicious. I'd say the hardest thing about this recipe is sectioning the wings!

Franks straight up( with the garlic powder & pepper) is the way to do it. The butter takes away some of the zip of the hot sauce. Takes away the "hot" in hot wings.

This was Lip Smackin' Good!  But FIFTEEN minutes is a bit long to keep the chicken wings in the deep fryer at 375 degrees..... they were a bit chewy to me. TEN minutes only and they were perfect!!!  They were done enough after 5/6 minutes, but the skin was perfectly crisped at ten minutes. FOR ALL of you who skip this recipe because the Publisher failed to mention whether it was written for "Mild vs. Medium vs. Hot"..... I found this as written to be a Mild-Medium Heat. YOu can read in the author's notes how to make it Hotter.  Speaking of..... by the way, adding vinegar to the recipe has nothing at all to do with making it hotter, just gives it an extra tang!! YUM YUM!!! I always add vinegar to my wing sauce.... even in the mild version.

TIP: It takes a lo-oong time to heat one gallon of oil to 375. Factor this into your cooking time! The results were quite tasty. They didn't turn out as crispy as when I get them at restaurants tho. Also, peanut oil is pretty expensive and I saved the oil to use again. The second time I made these, I decreased the amount of butter in the sauce. These are wings for folks serious about making them authentically.

Made precisely as directed, following the cook's notes for "hot" wings, these were interesting and tasted ok, but were not at all what I expect when I want Buffalo Wings. The black pepper seemed very out of place, both in texture and taste. Same with the red pepper flakes. I expect buffalo wing sauce to be smooth in texture and hot in flavor. Fortunately I also made a standard batch of sauce... butter+Frank's(+habanero poweder+cayenne powder for extra kick). Interesting, but not what we were looking for. Will not make again. Thanks anyway!

I can't believe this only has 37 ratings!  This is my absolute favorite go to recipe for wing sauce.  Everyone acts like I'm some kind of cooking genius when I use this at get togethers.  I don't change a single thing!  But I do use baked wings.  I put the sauce on the cooked wings and pop them back in the oven for a few minutes.  Perfection!

Just got done stuffing my gullet. Feeling like an angel who found his wings.  I too used the pan-fry method and had great results.  I'm wondering if tossing them in a wok would work well also??  Maybe something to try next time!  Anyways, fabulous!~!~!  yummmm....

Cooked these on Super-Bowl Sunday and was loved by all. I did use Franks thick pepper sauce because the store was out of the regular. The wings turned out just like the restaurant wings we are used too.

So sue me...For a shortcut...I bought Bonanza's (restaruant) Wings that were breaded and finished and ready to eat.  Bring them home-make Scott's sauce and toss these wings in the sauce.  The breaded wings really catch the sauce. Makes this a very easy and wonderful dish for Superbowl parties. These are very much like Hooters wings! I really loved those when we were able to get them.

WHILE it says buffalo wings, it does not seem like the ones I had while in that city. the ones that I so enjoyed has a somewhat sweet taste at first then they bite you after. i tried for years to make them even close. I found only one other place and that was in S.Jersey. they must have stolen the recepie from buffalo.

I am a new cook , so I followed the recipe to the T , and the results were GREAT . I have been a long haul truck driver for years and have had wings all over North America , and these are on par with the best . Like they say , If you want great food look for where the truckers eat . My friends loved this , and as a side dish I prepared creamed cucumbers , onions and tomatoes using a mix of ranch and Mayo . Not one complaint and all praise . Thank you for making me look good as it takes a lot .

Pretty good, loved the heat to them! I used frozen chicken wings, and I don't think I'll do that next time...they were small and not very much meat to them once they were deep fried.

This is an awesome recipe.  The family and friends loved it!  No more buying frozen wings!!!  No changes to the recipe except I didn't use a gallon of peanut oil, just half a gallon.

This recipe was very very good!  The first time I made wings at home besides the Tyson brand from Coscos!  We really enjoyed this recipe however it was a bit hot for us and we do like hot!  So next time I will not add the 1 T of red pepper flakes and see if that suites us better!  But I will definitely make again!! Yummy.......

I don't know how to judge what the most authentic buffalo wings are. I've tried buffalo wings from a few places and each were a bit different. I DO know what I like and this is my go to recipe for buffalo wings. I've made it many times. It's simple and tasty and my wings are always a hit when I use this recipe. I've tried others but this one gets the most compliments and my kids are always asking me to make it.

I use allrecipes for ideas on how to make my favourite dishes. I order hot wings at least once a week and it can get quite expensive. I decided to try a few of these recipes and this is by far the best I've tried. I won't use any other recipe. maybe it's the peanut oil. maybe it's the instructions. if you follow it you will get crispy wings cooked just right. I love this recipe!  so happy I found it. can't believe there are so few reviews on it!!

Excellent. As many have said, it is very simple, and very exact. Other then the cooking time, 7-8 mins. and they're done, 10+ for extra crispy. Perfect sauce/wing ratio, great seasoning, and overall a good recipe. Good recipe to have in your arsenal.
