Super easy,and people loved them.
I did make pumpkin mini muffins as well!
I put icing on each one in a circle. It held candy corn and the rest better. Thanks for the great idea

I made this cute recipe following the recipe.  It turned out great even though my oven wouldn’t get over 286*.   (I just had to bake them longer).  I took them to an Elks Thanksgiving dinner.  The only problem:  people were not sure if they were a decoration or a dessert.

These are adorable!   I’m sure that the recipe for the brownies and icing were delicious but I went the easy way and bought icing and store brand brownie bites.   
We had an afternoon decorating session. Very fun and easy.
