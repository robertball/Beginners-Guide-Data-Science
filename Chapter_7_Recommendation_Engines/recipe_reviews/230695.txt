This was very good and easier to make than the instructions made it sound.  I made it as written.  However, I think I cut the bread too deep.  I think it would have looked nicer and been easier to pull apart had I kept made the slices a little more shallow.  Nevertheless, it smelled great while cooking and tasted great.  I will make this again.

I made this for two functions during Christmas last year one was for family and friends; the other was at work for clients and co-workers, IT WAS A RAVER at both!  I am a health nut but use the best yummy stuff for Christmas, I am just careful for myself! My oldest son came over for supper, he dug in, and he LOVED it, and he says very little about anything I make.  I searched for it for this year as well. I am making it for my works Christmas parties pot luck supper. NO WORRIES, IT WAS/IS PERFECT FOR GROUPS! I am making this as one, of a few of our favorite snacky hors d' oeuvre for family on Christmas Eve too. It is PERFECT,and WONDERFUL, and for all the raves, it is very EASY! 

Yes, I made it as is with butter ranch and all, I used aged shredded cheddar cheese and packed it into all the fingers with yummy cooked bacon. I followed all the ingredients, and cooking instructions perfectly, it turned out fabulously! MY BACON TIP, I cut the bacon into small peices while raw, (I have dedicated kitchen scissors), then cook the 1 to 2 inch squares. I don't have to handle hot bacon or deal with cutting it after, my time saver!

The results have an impressive amount of flavor. I don't know about the setting for a party where multiple people are going to be grabbing at it but it worked great for just my wife and I.
The store was all out of Sourdough rounds so the next best thing was a rye round. Preparing it with this recipe gave it a huge, amazing flavor. I look forward to trying it again with sourdough bread.

I added bacon to my recipe - Take an unsliced loaf of Italian bread, and slice like you would slices but don;t go all the way , but about 3/4 down. Spread softend butter mixed with garlic on both sides of the slices. Then put in between each slice a 1/2 slice of munster cheese.  Add the cooked bacon and sprinkle with parmesan. Then bake until cheese is melted

Recipe Group Selection:  20, July 2013 ~ I am a week late in making this bread, but so glad I got around to it.  My family loved this bread!  I did not have a loaf of sourdough bread, but did have a loaf of sweet Italian bread, so I used it.  For the dressing I had ‘Dry Buttermilk Ranch Mix by SD’ from AR on hand, so I used that and the flavor was wonderful.  Three slices of bacon was the perfect amount and I just eye-balled the cheese.  This bread will be a hit during football season.  The ranch dressing was delicious with this and I might try it with Italian seasoning.  Good choice last week for Recipe Group.  Thanks Angela for sharing your recipe.  It’s a keeper!

I have been a professional chef for the past 51 yrs and found this recipe amazing. It took me little time to prep it and the cooking was easy and without any problems. I cut the bread a bit deeper than it called for, as I am well-aware of the toughness of the crust on any artisan bread. I also let the bacon drain until it was completely dry of any visible fat. Made a huge difference when I assembled the loaves. I made enough for my whole family (9 siblings, their spouses and kids and grandkids; my 9 kids, their spouses, 36 grandkids and 12 great-grandkids). That's about 90 of us for Thanksgiving brunch - a total of 15 loaves, and they all came out great. I also had the help of two 12-yr-olds (a grandson and a great-granddaughter).

Great flavor, we'll definitely be making this again!  At first the instructions seemed awkward because we didn't know how it was supposed to turn out or if we were doing it right.  We followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly!  We couldn't find any sourdough bread so we used Italian bread instead - just a great recipe...it was the star of the show.

This bread is addicting! I hardly ate dinner with it as a side dish. I used grated cheddar and a loaf of homemade Sriracha bread (this site), homemade Ranch dry mix (this site) and it was delicious with the background "heat" of the bread. I will make this often and try with other breads, too. Thanks for posting!

Made this for Recipe Group...Loved it! Hubby kept saying how good it was, and I agree. I used an 8oz. pkg, of shredded cheddar in place of the slices, and a bit more bacon b/c I already had it cooked and on hand. This was fun to make and eat...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

So delicious! A bit of a pain to make, but worth it. My store did not have sourdough rounds, so I used a loaf of take n bake peasant bread that seemed to be the right texture. All that butter...mmm... One caveat; I realize the first word of this recipe is cheddar, but I had some sliced havarti to use up :) No regrets, thanks for the awesome recipe!

My family literally did not eat this, it was just a big greasy mess. Cutting the bread halfway down is not sufficient to be able to tear this apart.

I made this on a white bread round I made from scratch and it was really good. Might ease up on the butter next time and go a little heavier on the seasoning.

I made this and could not believe how great the response
was.!!! I Would however rub the bottom of the loaf with the 
sauce too so it would not harden.

Would be nice to know how far apart the cuts should be in the bread. I cut the recipe in half for just me and my husband. Glad I baked 4 slices of bacon and  cut way more cheese though. Used more Uncle Dan’s, too, but that made it a bit too salty.  The bottom of the bread got hard before the cheese was totally melted. My husband ate it all, I cut off the bottoms. I was able to get an awesome 1/2 lb sourdough loaf at Trader Joe’s for only 99 cents! I will make this again for sure with my modifications. Thank you for the recipe!

I've seen this recipe in magazines and on Allrecipes so decided to try it for our football party yesterday.  I actually made 2 of them.  The first one I made as written.  The second one I made as an Italian version using a round herb bread, used mozzarella instead of cheddar, used Italian seasoning instead of Ranch, and crumbled Italian sausage instead of bacon.  The bottoms do seem to get hard and tough after baking so I would recommend either guests just pull the pieces and they just won't get the bottom part, or my recommendation is once it's baked, go ahead and cut the rest of the way through the bottom and then serve it.  So much easier to take a piece and eat it.

I recommend shredding the cheese yourself instead of buying pre-shredded packaged cheese to ensure it melts well.

Both of these turned out delicious!  My son loves Italian food and couldn't stop eating the Italian version!

i gave this recipe 5 stars just because I never thought of doing anything like this (and I love sourdough frenchbread). And also because it turned out great including thumbs up from other family members for super bowl 2018. I did substitute cooked,seasoned & crumbled sausage for the bacon that the recipe calls for. I hate cooking bacon and sausage was less expensive. And because others didn't like sourdough frenchbread (idiots), I used sweet (or just plain) frenchbread. Turned out great, folks loved it and keeping it on hand.

First think, make sure you use a bread knife when you make this!
So I made this for the “hubs” and me for our Super Bowl fest. Now keep in mind, there were only two of us so I didn’t need to get a whole sourdough bowl. Instead I opted for a medium loaf of unsliced Challah bread and used approximately 1/3 of this loaf. I cut it into a diamond pattern, slicing down to within 1/2 inch of the bottom. Instead of frying bacon, I used the packaged real bacon pieces and, after spreading the cuts open with my fingers, I generously shook these pieces into the “slots”. Next, I used the pre-packaged shredded Cheddar cheese instead of the slices. This, too, I sprinkled generously into the slits. Already looking yummy. From this point forward, I followed the recipe as directed, adjusting  it by 1/3. Wrapped it in foil, then unwrapped it for the last 10 minutes or so and it was ready to munch. “Hubs” couldn’t get enough of this. Said it was the perfect addition to the other goodies I had prepared for our “feast”. It is truly worth the effort to make this. All who try it will certainly enjoy it.

OMG!! We are all about appetizers to where we have a couple in place of dinner and this was the BEST  appetizer we have made in a long time!!!
I would include a pic but it was gone THAT FAST with 4 of us so I didn't take a pic of the empty plate.
Didn't make any changes and it was awesome!
Will be a regular in our appetizer collection.

I made some changes and it turned out good... I only used about 1/3 cup of butter and shredded cheese, and I also cut my bacon much a smaller than what the recipe said. Everyone loved it

Super delicious! Made this with individual rolls. My whole family loved them. A super hearty snack, awesome appetizer, or a great offering for a brunch.

Made this for a party I was having and it was a hit. The only change I made was instead of ranch dressing I mixed in a bunch of granulated garlic. I also broiled it for 2 minutes at the end just to crisp the top up a little. It tasted amazing I think next time I will put a bit more bacon and cheese.

When I made this for my family there wasn't a crumb left. I added more cheese and extra bacon. It was a hit. Definetly will make again.

I did this for a Sunday football snack, except I used a 1/2 loaf of Italian bread. It came out softer for even the little ones and our elderly guests.

this was delish!  everyone had a fun time trying to  get the most bacon on their piece of bread! esp towards the last few pieces of bread...  I used fresh Italian bread instead so there would be more for my party , doulbled the butter spread and I did cut the bread most of the way thru..  fantastic and it already has been requested at our next gathering

I do not like processed cheese so I used fresh grated old cheddar and fried the bacon until crispy and then broke it into bits, I also used double the bacon and a cup and a half of cheddar… 1/4 cup of butter ..  I also used some chopped green onions  and  finished it under the broiler ….it got raves .. I will definitely make it again

I made this for a lake party snack and followed the recipe as is.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  Next time I will prep it in advance as it does take a while to put together but so worth it!

I've made this twice: once as directed, and once with garlic infused butter in place of the ranch dressing. Both were so good hubby and I ate the whole thing in 1 sitting!

Loved it! I used a little more of the ranch packaging than directed but you really can't go wrong! Call ahead before heading to the grocery store. I called to ask them to hold the last uncut loaf for me, and I'm glad I did.
