This was pretty good! I do wish that it was a bit 'firmer' b/c it was a little hard to serve and, for lack of a better word, soggy/soft on the bottom, but it had good flavor. Next time I would serve this with some sauce on the side for topping. Keep an eye on the broiler b/c I only left mine in for 3 minutes and the top got quite brown, so just keep that in mind. This was nice for a change. Thanks for sharing. :)

I thought this had a good flavor, but as another reviewer said, it was pretty mushy on the bottom. I had drained the water out of my zucchini after I shredded it and again out of the pan after cooking, but it was still soggy. Maybe it should go under the broiler a bit first before adding the cheese. I'm not sure if that would help. It was a nice, different side dish though. Thanks for the recipe.

This passed the picky eater test!  I added extra cheese, I won't do that again because it made it too gooey.
