This is my first time making sauce with ground turkey.  At first I was skeptical and pensive.  I could not imagine that it would come close to the sauce I usually make (ground beef and pork.) However, I was pleasantly surprised.  The taste was great, my Italian, chef husband was very impressed.  I did not include the pepper, just personal preference.  The sauce was even better the second day.  Healthy and taste great, you can't beat that.

I had high expectations for this recipe and it just wasn't what I expected.  After four hours of simmering and the addition of extra garlic and extra jalapeno, it didn't taste like anything, though it smelled wonderful.  I began making additions to help the recipe since I was having company for dinner and didn't want to serve it as it was.  I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and worcestershire. That helped give it flavor but we all agreed it was still missing something.  I am really shocked that the recipe doesn't call for any salt or other seasonings.  I have made bolognese before and though it seemed like a recipe that should work, it just didn't.

I've been looking for a good turkey bolognese, as my entire family has high cholesterol (genetically). Turkey is also a great source of iron. I used soy milk in place of milk. I omitted the jalepeno, because I didn't have any, but ground in a spice mix of garlic, chilli, and basil. I also added in a little dried oregano. Also, I had a leftover zuchinni to use up, so I grated that up & added it in. It came out great. I put it over penne instead of spaghetti, because it's my favorite pasta. I also did not grate parmesan cheese over because we keep kosher & we can't mix dairy products with meat. This is a great recipe! I'm posting a picture of it.

Absolutely awesome.  This is a great sauce that isn't too heavy for your pasta dish.  We adjusted the recipe a little to add more spice:  more jalapeno, more garlic, more basil, and a Tablespoon of dry cooking sherry to add a little kick.  I served it over wheat spaghetti with Parmesean cheese as a garnish, and it was fabulous!  I will definitely be making this recipe again.  It smells wonderful as it is cooking (I halved the recipe and cooked it for 1.5 hours after all of the ingredients were stirred together), and it looks very impressive.  Thanks for this great recipe!!

This was great! I let is simmer about 5 hours, instead of the suggested 3 - and used bell pepper instead of the jalepeno. My family loved it!

We absolutely love this recipe. It is delicious. I have never had the time to simmer it for three hours but it is always super tasty after an hour. Sometimes we add an extra jar of sauce to thicken it up. We also put it on top of spaghetti squash instead of regular pasta, mmmm delicious!

For as long as this took to make, I really expected something outstanding.  It was just ok for me - but I had it for leftovers the next day and it tasted better.  So I think this is one that has to sit for the flavors to really come out.  I still won't make it again though -

An OK start...but it adds a lot of flavor to use turkey sausage (remove the casings first) instead of regular ground turkey. I also prefer to use red pepper flakes instead of jalapeno peppers.

Thought we would like this more from the reviews. Thinking next time to use  a mixture of ground veal, pork and beef...seemed the meat wasn't flavorful enough.

This is a fantastic recipe. I would recommend using rigatoni or similar noodles instead of spaghetti. I used spaghetti on the 1st try. For leftovers, I mixed the remaining sauce with rigatoni. I'll definitely make this many more times.

This was the most BLAND sauce I have ever tasted.  I should have know that a sauce that calls for only a tiny amount of dried herbs would be awful!  All the garlic or jalapeno in this recipe couldn't save it.  After a terrible supper i had to save the rest of the sauce with thyme, oregano, sea salt, fresh pepper, fresh basil and fennel.    This recipe was such a waste of time!!

Very good. My boyfriend loved it so much that there were no leftovers and there are only 2 of us. I only had a pound of grount turkey so i divived everything in half. I also left out the carrots since I didnt have any. We like a lot of seasoning so i added some seasoning salt, pepper andsome red pepper flakes. It was amazing.

This sauce is SO authentic tasting it's scary! So full of flavor, an instant hit with guests, great if you mix up the meats or just use turkey, great with extra jalapeno or none, great with cream instead of milk. LOVE IT - it will be a staple in our house for a long time to come.

This recipe was great!! I put it over rotini noodles since that is our favorite. I substituted red wine for the white wine, chili flakes for the jalapenos (because I didn't have any), added green bell peppers and parm cheese right in the sauce. I also cut the recipe in half because it was only for my husband and me which reduded the simmering time by almost 2 hours!

So good, halved the recipe, used 1/2 lb white meat gr. turkey, and 1/2 lb dark.  Added kosher salt and pepper to taste.  Didn't have time to simmer for 3 hours, so only simmered for about an hour, still turned out great!!!!

this was very tasty-and healthy too! I didn't have white wine so I used a little chicken stock.  I added fresh basil and broccoli and then put mozzarella in at the end and served over whole wheat past. A great twist for healthy pasta!

I am giving this four stars because it is lacking something in seasonings.  I added extra vinegar and italian seasoning to make it have special "taste".  Still it is an easy sauce to make and it tastes just better than regular spaghetti sauce.

With no can of plum tomatoes to hand, I used crushed and I also threw in a couple of shakes of Worcestershire Sauce.  This was the best bolognese I've had in a long time.  Even my husband, a bit of a food snob, couldn't tell it was turkey.
Very tasty and even better heated up the next day.

This sauce was okay.  I substituted chicken broth for the white wine and omitted the jalepenos, maybe making it as written would have given me better results.

What did I do wrong?  I kept waiting for it to "reduce" with the milk and the wine, after 20 minutes with each it didn't so I drained off some liquid and moved to the next step.  Then let it simmer the 3 hours with the tomatoes.  It was just ok - definitely not a repeat for me.  Had to add salt and pepper to make it taste better too.

This was a too watery for me -- almost like a soup.  However, I did like the flavor (although I added Italian seasoning & salt).

We liked this recipe.  I'm on a low fat diet and this sauce coupled with whole wheat pasta let us enjoy a tasty Italian dinner.  If you're looking for a rich, hearty meat sauce you might be a little disappointed, but if you are wanting a healthier version this does a great job.  I halved the recipe and added extra seasoning including salt and pepper per other comments.  I also did not have enough crushed tomatoes so subbed in some jarred tomato sauce to make up the difference.  I will gladly make this again to enjoy a guilt-free pasta night.

the only thing i changed was i used beef/pork in place of the turkey

I was very skeptical of this recipe, but it came out really good! I left out the jalepenos and the tomato paste because i didn't have any on hand. I used light cream instead of milk and added an additional clove of garlic and wine,  plus some red pepper flakes. It was quite good especially for it being turkey!

Not bad. I left out the jalapenos, added extra cheese and used shredded leftover Thanksgiving turkey (primarily the dark meat).

I was feeding toddlers so I omitted the jalepenos and I added a bunch of frozen peas and alot of fresh spinach (it shrinks so much it feels like alot). This sauce was great.

This sauce was great! It was very simple to do. I think using fresh basil adds just a bit more flavor :) Overall I give this an A+

Outstanding!  Both my husband and I loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I grated 2 green jalapenos but will use 3 next time.

I frequently go to great lengths to make recipes online with mediocre results.  This was EASY, and smells amazing.  (I added chili pepper flakes, a splash of worcestershire, tobasco, and fresh ground pepper to give it some kick).  Hooray, a recipe worth the effort!  Thanks!

This is a fantastic sauce!  My husband loved it and he is really hard to please.  I left out the jalepenos because my 8 year old doesn't like spicy foods, but I could definitely see it being fantastic with the spice too.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I will make it again but next time I'm going to use some beef bullion or even just a few pieces of bacon in the mix turkey just doesn't get it for me.

The sauce was excellent and was like a chili but with pasta it was not the best. It was better by itself. Would have been better paired with crackers or baked pita chips. Definitely would suggest making the sauce but using something else other than pasta for the solid base

Fantastic!  I cut it in half (it still made quite a bit) and omitted the jalapenos.  I also put two whole carrots (minced) and garlic salt to taste (in addition to the cloves of fresh garlic.  I've been looking for more recipes that use ground turkey and this one is definitely worthy!!  Will make again soon!!
