I sprinkled my plantains with sugar and  cinnamon...... I know it's supposed to be a savory dish not a sweet one, but that's how I like them. Served with a side of sweet Mexican cream. I loved them.

I loved these! I have eaten fried plantain my whole life, but never smashed and refried. These made for fantastic crunch on the outside and a nice squishy inside. With 2 minutes per side I still ended up with mine a bit burnt. I am going to make these again today, but I will just  decide intuitively how long to fry them per side . I need to nail this recipe! :-)

I followed the recipe as submitted. My Plantain was the color of a banana and cooked up slightly sweet. I lightly sprinkled sea salt over them. Super easy to make and delicious.
