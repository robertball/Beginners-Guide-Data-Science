These were a delicious variation on your traditional butter tart in a pastry shell. I found that I only needed 1 1/2 cups of the graham cracker crumb mix to fill my 12 muffin tins. A hint for packing down your graham crackers is to use the bottom of your 1/4 cup measuring cup to push down the graham cracker crust firmly. 12 tablespoons is equal to 3/4 cup, which might be helpful to know when measuring out your butter. I split the recipe between the original as written, and the second half using Splenda white and Splenda brown sugar blend. Both were great, so this recipe adapts well for those looking to reduce the calories.  By using Splenda I brought the calories down to 250, and the carbs down to 19 g per serving.  I worried that I might not be a able to take these out of the muffin tins without breaking them, but once cooled and loosened on the edges with a sharp knife, they came right out.  Next time I'd like to try adding nuts, chocolate or coconut.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Holy cow, these are good.  I doubled the recipe, making two batches.  There really is only two, rather small, problems with them.  One, they are a bit too sweet.  I would leave out the sugar in the graham cracker crumbs.  The second problem, the shells are a bit of a hassle.  They are kinda crumbly.  I accidentally baked the first batch of shells two minutes longer than what the recipe calls for.  Those stayed together better than the second batch I baked.  The second batch i had to put into paper muffin cups to keep them in one piece.  Definitely use the raisins and nuts.  They would be good without them, but are much better with them.

I really like the combination of the soft filling and crispy crust. If possible, use the optional nuts and raisins; I did, and every bite was a medley of tastes and textures. I would reduce the amount of crust by about a quarter, but other than that this recipe is a keeper. :) It is superb with a piping hot cup of coffee. Also, this recipe is sweeter than a traditional butter tart, so you might want to reduce the sugars if you don't want it too sweet. (Tip: I used a silicone muffin mould. That way, I just pushed the bottoms up to get the tarts out, with minimal breakage. There were still a few graham crumbs though. Also, silicone means no greasing/spraying needed.)
