Good recipe, however way too salty with all the bouillon. Just add some cooked beef (any form: roast, steak, low fat hamburger) to get that beefy taste, and omit the bouillon. If you save this for overnight, keep in mind the pasta will increase in size by soaking up some of that liquid. It's easy for this to become a casserole instead of soup if you add too much pasta.

Delicious, quick soup.  To reduce the sodium I used 4 cups of low sodium beef broth.  I also added some sliced zucchini and shell macaroni instead of elbow since that's what I had on hand.  The next day I added some left over shredded rotisserie chicken.  Even better!

My family really enjoyed this meal. We sprinkled some low-fat mozzarella on top and enjoyed it with some warm bread on the side.  YUM!

Not bad, but like other reviewers I added alot more veggies than what the recipe called for including squash & cannelli beans. Also, the more ingredients meant adding more broth and tomatoes and instead of elbows, I made small shells, topping off with some locatali cheese.

This was an easy recipe for some hot soup.  I actually made it a more hearty soup by adding extra macaroni, 4 crumbled beef patties (which I had on hand), and one can of Irish potatoes, cut into slices.  It was delicious.  With the addition of extra noodles and such, however, I also added about 3 cups more water and some extra boullion.  Mmm mmm good.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I did make a couple changes. I added another can of italian stewed tomatoes and a can of garbanzo beans.This was really tasty with a crusty garlic bread.

I was a little leary of eating this once I smelled it cooking.  I'm not a big cooked-celery-person and that's all I could smell.  But it was VERY GOOD!  I think I will reduce the celery to 1/2 next time.  I doubled the batch so I could freeze some for another meal, hopefully the spinach and pasta will reheat ok.  I think I might add a little Italian sausage too for a little more yum.  This is such a healthy soup, I can afford to add a few more calories.

Great soup, very fast, easy and tasty. I didn't have any cabbage, so I just added a bit more spinach, and I used white beans instead of pasta, but otherwise didn't make any changes. Will definitely make this again and again. Thanks!

Delicious! I added kidney beans and potato and when it was done, on each bowl, croutons topped with shredded mozzarella and put it in the broiler. It was so good, makes my mouth water thinking about it.

Absolutely delicious. I did make a few changes, though. My family highly distrusts most canned 'diced' veggies, so I used a can of whole peeled tomatoes instead of the Italian Diced Tomatoes. To make up for the seasonings, I added an extra clove of garlic, along with seasoning salt, oregano and basil. I used Ziti instead of macaroni, also. I would recommend not doing that. haha. All in all, this was a delicious change of pace!

Was decent, kind of lacking in the taste department. Needs some kind of seasoning to make it better. Was much better as leftovers the next day.

Very tasty and satisfying.  I added a can of red kidney beans (rinsed) and an extra cup water+1 extra cube beef bouillon to compensate for the extra volume of the beans.  It was just right.  I will definately be making this again.  I'm always happy to find a soup that contains standard pantry items and is quick to fix.

What a quick, easy, healthy soup! I made it exactly as written, and found that it wasn't quite flavorful enough...the pepper gave it some heat, but other than that, it needs some herbs or something. It is warm, filling, and very good for you, though, so I might make it again. Thanks for sharing!

I almost followed this as written:  Didn't have beef bouillon so used veg stock, and I don't like elbows in soup so I changed the shape of the pasta (which had absolutely no effect on the taste anyhow).  Added some beans b/c I like beans in my minestrone.  Will def keep this in the soup rotation.

Delicious, healthy and easy! What a great combo. I was a bit skeptical because of the cabbage, but it all woks great together. The pasta is very nice in this soup, it makes it nice and filling, we did not have anything else for dinner and were very satisfied. This makes a whole lot, but it can easily be cut down to serve less people. We have plenty left over for lunch tomorrow. Not sure how well it freezes, but I'll be putting a few servings in the freezer to see how it keeps. Will absolutely make this again and can't wait to try different veggies.

This was really good! I made it lastnight for my boyfriend (he's sick). I added green beans, corn, kidney beans, and some extra garlic. I also did 2 cans of tomatoes and 5 cups of bouillon since I added so many veggies. I'm having the left overs for lunch today. I bet it will be even better!

This just didn't do it for us. I feel like the proportions are off. Just as easy and a thousand times better is the Italian Sausage Soup also on this site.

I added whole wheat pasta and added almost two more cups of water to the soup and it still had plenty of flavor.  Added kidney beans too as others suggested.  Very easy to adjust to your tastes.

This was really yummy and super healthy! I added a bit of chicken bullion and some extra veggies, whatever we pulled out of the garden. It was really fast and tasted great! We really enjoyed it as stew the next day too :-) Thank you!!!

I wanted a good low fat, low carb, flavor-packed soup.  I upped the vegetables by adding more celery, 1 large zucchini, frozen green beans and peas, ½ can of corn, and ½ head of cabbage.  I didn’t use any water, just vegetarian chicken-flavored broth.  I omitted the spinach because I didn’t know how it would taste as leftovers.  I also omitted the pasta to cut down on calories/carbs.  I used Italian spiced diced tomatoes and one small can of Italian spiced tomato sauce.  This recipe was “souper” (sorry, I had to) easy and nutritious.

Good, quick recipe.  I used beef broth instead of water/bouillon, and added an extra cup and cooked the macaroni right in the soup.  Good after 20 minutes; will probably taste even better after the flavors have had more time to meld.

Was looking for a quicker version of what I used to prepare in the restaurant where I worked; this is a nice base from which to start. I did use olive oil, low sodium beef bouillon, skipped the pasta and added kidney beans because that is how we made it. Next time I will add more vegetables definitely zucchini as well as another can of beans, probably garbanzo or fava.

Wow!  Easy and delicious!  A yummy way to get veggies into my 2 year old twins!  I chopped everything quite finely and they gobbled it down!  I used fresh tomatoes because I needed to use them up and substituted some less favored vegetables (cabbage) with more onion, though you could add zucchini, squash, etc.  Then I topped each bowl with either mozzarella or parmesan cheese.  It was a big hit!

Good recipe.  I of course adjusted it for my tastes and preferences.  I used shredded carrots and cabbage from a coleslaw bag mix.  I also used homemade roasted veggie broth because I don't do red meat (or beef broth).  I also left out the celery as a personal preference.  I used the tiny shell pasta and was quite happy with the turn out!

This is an easy and quick recipe. I liked it better using Italian Stewed Tomatoes. I got some advices and didn't add 3 cubes of beef bouillon. I only used 2 cubes, and the soup tasted good. Someone mentioned this as well, but the macaroni tends to soak up the water and becomes really huge when I had leftovers next day. My advice is eating up the soup on the day you make!? ;D

Great "shell" recipe.  We always look at this when starting to make minestrone, and change based on what sounds good.  Generally we add Italian Turkey Sausages, and a whole lot more seasoning than is called for.  We also crush the stewed tomatoes, and use small shells instead of macaroni.  Great way to start and customize though!

Good!  I thought the cabbage was kind of a strange ingredient.  Next time I would put in less of that and more spinach.  I always use low salt bouillon so saltiness was not a problem for us.  I also put in raw macaroni and let it cook in the soup to save time.  Overall, very good and quick!

Good, quick, and easy. I did put 3 or 4 times the amount of elbow macaroni in to make it more of a main dish soup. I've started making my own soup at home since my husband is working from home and it seems yummier and more cost effective to make a pot of soup than to buy cans. This one is my second favorite so far (my favorite is a chowder though, so maybe not a fair comparison). I followed the advice of adding the spinach at the last minute so the leftover spinach isn't limp and so even my leftover soup was very yummy. When reheating, I had to add a bit more water to the bowls because the macaroni absorbed it.

This was a good soup, but with the onion and cabbage it was a little off.  I also thought it would be better with some chicken chunks in it.

EASY, and indeed only 30mins! I added more pepper for more of a kick/Italian flavor. I didn't have fresh spinach but putting in frozen spinach at the beginning (yes still frozen) works just fine. And I used ONE bullion cube so as have less salt and it tasted great!

Every time I make this I love it more!  Minetrone is so healthy and yummy.  I added turkey Italian sausage as my son doesn't think its 'real' dinner unless it has some meat.Garbanzos and Kidney beans.

This was very tasty, but I felt that beans needed to be added for substance, and also to reflect most of the minestrone recipes I've had. Minestrone has several variations - one of my favorites include sausage.  I am the proud owner of two successful restaurants.

Very tasty.  I used beef broth tetrapaks instead of cubes, and needed more liquid than 3 cups.  I also cooked pasta separately, and added at end when soup was cooled somewhat, so it wouldn't overcook as I wanted to freeze some.
Thanks for sharing!

I made this soup for the first time this week and it was fantastic. I am not a fan of spinach so I substituted with more cabbage. My fiance is a meat & potato kind of guy and was a little concerned that he would not like the soup but he said...WOW, this is actually really good. The other thing I did differently was used Basil, Oregano & Garlic seasoned diced tomatoes. That gave it a lot of flavor and was excellent. I will be making this recipe again as it is a nice change from the Wisconsin Winter chili.

Okay, I'm sitting here pretty annoyed that my kids are starving and the veggies are still not soft after 40 min of simmering.  I have tasted it, it is good, so I'm giving it the 3 stars, but please don't say it takes 30 minutes when there is no way that can be done!

Great Soup!  Instead of beef bouillons, I substituted beef/onion soup mix, a little extra water (1 cup), ground beef and one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes w/green chiles for a little extra kick.  Family loved it.

Yummy recipe that you can easily make your own. I used chicken bouillon instead of beef and added some green pepper, fresh tomatoes in addition to the Italian stewed, kidney beans, white kidney beans, peas, and zucchini. I didn't add noodles because I had so many vegetables and that made it hearty. Quick and very good...very good for you too.

I modified this recipe quite a bit but it still turned out good. I didn’t have celery or spinach but I did have lots of cabbage so I put in three cups of chopped cabbage. I also added some hot turkey sausage, 1cup of kidney beans, 1 tsp. oregano and black pepper – this gave lots of flavour that some of the other reviews said the recipe was lacking.

This was my first foray into the world of minestrone, and I must say it was a success.  I offer one bit of caution: careful w/ the food processor people!  I made a rookie mistake and nearly pureed my veggies rather than chopping them!  Nevertheless, I shared my soup and everybody loved it.

Excellent recipe! I took it a step further because I had leftover corn, peas, greenbeans, cheese sauce and beef with taco sauce in the frig. So I tossed it all in there as well during the last step of the recipe. It was great!

The only thing I substituted was organic beef broth instead of boullion cubes.  It was really delicious and I'm going to make it again.

This was very tasty, but I did add pinto beans with bacon to it and my husband liked that addition.

Easy and very tasty!!
I cooked the vegetable part exactly as directed - but then added two cans of beef broth plus a little water instead of water/bouillon. I also added a couple of generous "dashes" of Worcestershire sauce, some oregano and basil.

This was excellent.  I'm on a low carb diet and instead of pasta I added black soy beans (don't grimace people, they are nearly the same as regular beans, just low carb).  I also used beef stock and a bit of Tabasco sauce.  Mmm!  Also, I didn't saute the veggies, I just threw them all in the pot and it turned out wonderfully.  I'll definitely make this again.

I made a double batch for dinner tonight, my only change was egg noodles instead of elbow, and I added mushrooms, and the soup was delicious!  Check out my photo of this recipe!

This soup is full of flavour.  I used chicken bouillon cubes instead of beef.  I also added a 16 oz can of chicken broth to increase the amount of liquid in the soup.  I also used a little bit of garlic salt.  I may add some sausage next time for a little protein.

I left out the bouillion and used ground beef instead. I also added red wine, worcestershire sauce, a can of kidney beans and half a can of white potatoes. I used shells instead of elbow, and an extra cup of water to compensate for all the additions. I probably should have used one more cup of water, as I'm concerned about it thickening overnight. My picky son liked it, so that pleases me. My husband didn't really like the ground beef so next time I may use beef broth in the carton instead.

Kind of bland. I added cabbage and minced garlic but all in all since it is so fast, it is a good easy recipe for minestrone.

Didn't take me 30 minutes because I used all fresh ingredients, but wasn't too bad time wise... unfortunatly my husband wasn't a fan... I would definatly make again if he liked it because I thought it was good.
