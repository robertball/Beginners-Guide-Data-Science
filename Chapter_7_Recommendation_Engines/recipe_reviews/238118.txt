I liked this salad but it is a fairly standard recipe for this type of salad (which I expected...no problem.) I do wish AR would list broccoli in cups (and a lot of other ingredients, especially fruits and vegetables).  I buy big bags of broccoli florets at Sam's.  Even if I did buy crowns, they vary a lot in size and in the amount of florets provided. I don't fault this recipe, just wish AR would standardize.  I used two cups bite-sized broccoli florets, thinking that 2:1 would be a good ratio between broccoli and grapes.  I also cut the grapes in half.

The yield for the dressing is high so be sure to mix everything else before slowly adding the dressing as you don't need much for one head of broccoli.
