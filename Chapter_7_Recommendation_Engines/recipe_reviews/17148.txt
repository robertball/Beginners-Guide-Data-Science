This is really good, but you can cut down on cooking time by not cooking the manicotti, stuff them "raw", so to speak. Add a cup of water to your spag. sauce....heating it in the microwave before you are ready to bake your pasta.....pour over your manicotti before baking...cover and bake!!!!!

This dish would garner more compliments if just a little care went into the sauce. Chop up some onions, and saute them in olive oil for a couple of minutes on high heat, throw in minced garlic for another minute. Add some fresh basil for one more minute, and top with shredded or julienned carrot. Stir in your saute with the sauce before adding to the pan of pasta; you'll add more volume, more flavor, and the dish will look even nicer. Plain "spaghetti sauce" reminds me of a cafeteria, and should be avoided! (Bonus: throw on a very small portion of grated asiago on the dish in the last ten minutes, and finish off uncovered. The cheese will brown slightly.)

Very good! Based on previous complaints of this dish being bland, I used 1/4 cup fresh, shredded spinach (instead of parsely) added 1/2 tsp garlic salt and 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the cheese mix.  Very tasty turnout! My only complaint is filling the pasta...very messy and somewhat time consuming.  Overall, good and will make again!

Very very good, When I made my sauce I added ground beef, which I brown with basil, fresh garlic, Italian seasoning, season salt and freshly ground black pepper, I also added some wine to my sauce and a little sugar. I did not have any monterey cheese so I used Parma instead I also did not add the bread crumbs to my cheese mixture. I only boiled my shells for 5min as they would cook more in the oven, did'nt want my dish to taste over cooked. I stuffed my shells, poured my sauce over then I covered and baked, with the last ten mins of bake time I removed the cover and top with lots of mozzarella  the baked uncovered ten min more. Yummy!!!.

Wow! I've never made any kind of stuffed pasta before tonight, but this was fairly simple and so delicious! The sour cream really helps make the cheese mixture creamy instead of grainy, like ricotta can be sometimes. I didn't have any Monterey Jack, so I just used an Italian cheese blend. I also added garlic, per some other suggestions, and just snipped a corner off a plastic bag to stuff the shells. Thanks for a great recipe! It will go into the "rotation."

We had this last night and loved it. Thanks to the advice of others I only cooked the manicotti for 4 minutes making it much easier to handle while stuffing...it cooks up great this way. Per others as well, I added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 c. fresh chopped basil. This is a keeper!

I loved these! I didn't cook the noodles first, which made them much easier to stuff. I jused leftover spaghetti sauce, added just a little water to the sauce and a little to the bottom of the glass dish. Everything turned out great and it was so simple!

Decided to try this recipe over the holidays and it came out very well.  I did make a few adjustments to the recipe to suit my tastes.  I used a five cheese italian blend to mix in with the ricotta.  I also added in some frozen spinach that I had thawed and drained well into the cheese mixture.  Also added in some chopped fresh basil, garlic and Tony Chachere's seasoning to the cheese mixture.  I omitted the bread crumbs because I didn't see the point in putting them in.  I browned a pound of ground beef and added that in to the spaghetti sauce which had been doctored up with extra garlic, fresh basil and some italian herbs.  I boiled my pasta only 5 minutes as others suggested and then used kitchen shears to cut the manicotti open.  It made the filling process so much easier and you couldn't tell after the manicotti was baked!  I baked the manicotti about 40 minutes and then sprinkled the top with more of the five-cheese Italian blend.  Baked about 10 minutes more to melt the cheese.  This came out tasting wonderfully cheesy and delicious!

This was a great recipe.  My family and I loved it.  We only changed a few things.  I used 3 cups of spaghetti sauce instead of 2.  I brushed the manicotti lightly with olive oil after cooking.  I spiced up the filling with garlic powder and  italian seasoning.  I also sprinkled on some shredded parmesian on top of the sauce.  Will make again and again.

I took others advice and added some extra seasonings (garlic powder, italian seasoning). I also stuffed the noodles raw, added 2 TBSP water to the sauce at the bottom of the pan, added the sauce on top, and then added another 2 TBSP of water before adding the cheese. Then I baked at 350 for 1 hour, covered with foil for 50 min and uncovered for 10. The noodles came out PERFECTLY and I didn't have to fight to stuff them!

This recipe is awesome! I have made it probably 5 times now. No matter what... this is my favorite and it actually tastes better then a lot of restaurants. 

As a tip, I recommend using hamburger (crumbled) in your pasta sauce as well as when you stuff your manicotti shells. (Just mix in your chilled, crumbled, hamburger in with your cheeses) before stuffing.

I've tried the same with hot sausage, but you get the best results with hamburger (around 80-85% lean meat). 

I also prefer to use a (meat) pasta sauce. If you are at odds what to get, when preparing for this recipe. Ragu (meat) flavored is a good choice.

You will be very satisfied with this recipe. It is a wonderful find! 

A+++ thanks for sharing!

My whole family (ages range from 12-46) loves this dish. Try using fresh mozzarella balls cut into strips instead of grated dry mozzarella. DELALLO's roasted garlic sauce is the best spaghetti sauce I've found for this recipe.

It was good; not sure about the sour cream, just found a weird aftertaste. Not really sure why there was breadcrumbs in the mixture and lack of egg. The fact it was different made me want to try it, but think I will stick with the age old traditional cheeserecipe. Hubby seemed to like it though.

I agree that the sauce needs to be pumped up, but the author of this recipe doesn't mention what type of sauce to use... that, dear cooks is of course left up to you!  Since my family loves my homemade sauce with sausage, that it's what I used.   I cooked the pasta under al dente to make them easier to handle and piped in the cheese mixture with a pastry bag.  A large baggie with a hole cut in the corner works well too.   Less mess!

Used this one to make jumbo stuffed shells. I added a few more spices in the cheese mixture than were called for, and I also cooked 1 lb. of italian sausage to mix in - used half in the cheese, half in the sauce. OH MY! It was absolutely amazing. Thanks for a great basic recipe!

This is the only manicotti recipe I use and everyone just loves it! Sometimes I add sauteed onions, peppers and mushrooms on top. Thanks for this recipe!

I doubled the ricotta, added one more tablespoon of sour cream, 2 tablespoons fresh basil, 1 tablespoon fresh thyme and one garlic clove.  This was a deliciuos dish!  Everyone in our family enoyed it.  They are very filling and we ended up with left overs, but who wouldn't want left over manicotti?!  Also, for those that thought the filling of these was time consuming, I used the Pampered Chef Easy Accent Decorator with the biggest flower tip and they not only were quick to fill but looked "pretty" once they were filled.

I'm a new "cook" and still learning, but I do know when something tastes wonderful!! This was so good!  I did use some tips from other reviews ie. saute onions, basil, carrots for flavor in the sauce...but what a delicious meal, that will now be something we will have often and can invite company over and WOW! them.

Great recipe. I used a plastic bag to fill the manicotti...just load it up with the cheese mixture, twist the top, and then snip a small bit of one corner off. All you have to do is squeeze the filling into the noodles. I also used the oven ready noodles, which are hard and so much easier to fill than the ones you cook beforehand.

These were very good but I would recommend covering them with more sauce because they were just a tad dry, other than that, the ricotta mix was delicious. I used large manicotti and my boyfriend absolutely loved them. He took them to work for lunch for 3 days in a row! Thanks!

Great!  Served it to 11 college kids and they couldn't get enough.  Will make more cheese mixture next time though.  Adjusted the recipe for 15 people and it only made 18 shells. Not enough for everyone to have two.

This is delicious! I used parsley flakes the second time, and we didn't notice a difference. To make the filling as light as air, add to egg whites, whisked until foamy. Yum!

Awesome recipe!!! I find that shaping the cheese mixture with my hands made it easier to stuff into the shells. Another trick that I have used is to cut the shells down one side to open them up and then put the filling in and roll them up again. No one will ever know that they are cut.

This is a great recipe.  I cooked the pasta for 6 minutes and then stuffed them, using a plastic bag to pipe the mix into the shells.  No work at all!  My husband has already asked me to make this again.

Love the cheese blend. Economical to use some Jack cheese and works great. I added a couple tablespoons Romano. Parmesan would work, too. I never par-boil pasta for lasagna, so I didn't for this manicotti either. With a bit of extra liquid (1/4 cup or so) in the baking dish, it cooks just fine. I used my own spaghetti sauce, so it wound up with meat in it. Next time I'll add some spinach to the cheese filling.

My family loved this the only change I made was to add ground beef to the cheese mixture. I also used the recipe for "Inger's spaghetti sauce" I found on this site rather than just using canned sauce. It was really good!

Very good! I only cooked the pasta for 4 minutes so they would be easier to stuff. I also added a little garlic power, italian seasoning, and a dash of nutmeg to the cheese mixture. Then I sauted a little fresh onion and garlic to add to the sauce.

I made these last night. We loved this recipe! I used jumbo shells that I under cooked (easier to stuff), sprinkled in some garlic powder and some italian seasoning into the cheese blend after reading some reviews saying these were bland and used dried parsley instead of fresh. I didn't add much of the extra spices, maybe a half teaspoon of each. I don't think they were needed at all. I served these with Italian sausage, peppers and onions. They went perfectly together. I got raves for this dinner. The word that was used was scrumptious. I will be making this again and again!

This is a great recipe! The only change I made to it was to use fresh pasta sheets and roll them instead of boxed pasta tubes. Its fast and easy and the cooking time is a little less.

These were pretty good but a little bland...I think it could use something else but can't pin point it..It's alot easier to fill the shells if you only cook for a few minutes, otherwise it's a mess and they just keep ripping in half..

These were FANTASTIC! I made these for New Years Eve and they were devoured so fast I didn't know what happened. I made my own sauce based on the spaghetti sauce and meatball recipe from this site, and spread a thick layer beneath the manicotti, then I placed the manicotti neatly one by one in my dish, and covered with a nice thick layer of sauce. I then shred MORE mozzarella chese over the top and also sprinkles some freshly shredded parmesan over the top. AMAZING!!!

Tremendous recipe!  Here's a tip:  boil the pasta until al dente. Then dump the hot water and replace with cold. The pasta tubes won't burn you or fall apart when you stuff them.

I love this recipe!  I don't boil the noodles though, I stuff them uncooked then use extra tomato sauce/juice to cook the whole dish.  I have added cooked spinach and cooked italian sausage to the cheese mix...yummy!  Super easy dish to make.

Not bad!

I personally would have preferred a higher concentration of the ricotti compared to the other cheeses, but I will use this recipe again!

This was just too bland for our taste.  I really think a good manicotti needs the flavor of Parmesan and Romano cheeses.  I would not use bread crumbs again, instead will add an egg to 'body' the cheese mixture.

Wow! Definitely restaurant quality! I used the italian sausage as suggested. Just squeezed it out of the casings and browned as normal, drained the fat afterwards. Made the filling a few hours ahead. After I par boiled the manicotti shells, I also cut a slit up the back of them to stuff. So much easier! Then I placed the cut side down and no one would ever guess! Also, just added my favorite pasta sauce on top, next time I will make the white sauce.

Delicious and easy recipe! I, too, added garlic salt and fresh basil. Tasting before stuffing was a great suggestion. I threw in a little nutmeg, as well. When I was happy with the mix, the rest was so easy. Well, except I've never been able to cook manicotti without half of the shells splitting during boiling. I usually cook my own sauce, but was being lazy, and I really didn't miss it. Prego Garlic and Sausage sauce from a jar added just a little bit of meat, and actually had a great flavor. I will definitely make again!

The manicotti was alright, though I may not have salted it enough.  I was excited for more flavor based on the reviews.  My advice would be to keep tasting as you put the stuffing together, the flavor won't change too much after it's cooked.  To be fair though, I'm not a huge cheese fan- I made it for my husbin.

This was mouthwatering!!!! I added colby cheese to the mix and added colby and mont jack cheeses to top along with the mozzarella. It was perfect. The mix didn't quite make the full box...made only 9 shells but I was stuffing them quite thick. So if you want them thick...almost double the recipe! Other than that...superb!

Very good manicotti. To make filling easier use a pastry bag. Don't use a tip or better yet buy throw away bags.

I took advice from here and only cooked the manicotti for 4 minutes.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta as that's all I could find.  I used a big tub of cottage cheese which made way too much cheese mixture.  I stuffed each manicotti with a butter knife.  Tedious but it worked.  Pour sauce over them baked in the oven covered for 50 minutes and then removed foil, added cheese and baked for another 15 minutes.  Delicious!

This was a really good recipe...even though I messed up thinking I was using mozzarella but instead had accidentally substituted Monterrey Jack by mistake.  Based on other viewer comments, I did add garlic salt, garlic powder and Italian seasoning (1/2 teaspoon each), but otherwise followed recipe as written.  Have decided it really doesn't matter which cheese you use...really good with any one or more of them.  Great recipe...thanks for posting!!

I've been making this recipe for years, however, I do not use bread crumbs or sour cream and add drained canned spinach.  My family loves it.  I agree a little spicing up of the marina sauce is pretty easy.

HOT TIP -I use a "Jerky Shooter" with the "Jerky Sticks" tube to stuff the manicotti. Buy a Jerky Shooter at Walmart, Bass Pro Shops, Cabella's. You don't need an expensive one, they sell a smaller plastic model that works fine for this. You want the one that has a tube for "Jerky Sticks", it's smaller. And I stuff jalapenos with it to make Atomic Buffalo Turds, cook them on my smoker.

Very good. I added some aged white cheddar in there to make it a 4 cheese manicotti, because I didn't buy enough mozzarella, and it was still awesome. I also made my own pasta sauce with all fresh ingredients, and I think that definitely helped. Will make again very soon!

Sometimes these turn out perfectly, but sometimes they have a little bit of a bitter aftertaste.  Can't quite figure out why.  I do like the combination of cheeses though.

This was my first time making a stuffed pasta dish and it was fairly simple. It only took me only an hour of prep time and came out delicious. I did add ground beef to the sauce and a little more mozzarella on top but all in all I would make this dish again and again.

Probably my error but it was much too dry for my tastes.  I did, however, split the recipe and bake in two smaller pans as half was for a friend.  Her portion was better she said, mine had much too little sauce.  In future whether I split it or not I will likely add about one half more the sauce as is called for.  I like a 'juicier' manicotti.

Really good. I have used both in manicotti pasta shells and in jumbo shells which I like best-easier to fill. I use italian bread crumbs and garlic salt, fresh basil, thyme and parsley from my garden-always turns out wonderful-I only cook for 30min so my shells don't get overcooked/crispy. Thanks

It is very easy and filling! Second time I made it I added an egg and spinach to the cheese filling.

This was SOOOO good!  I was generous with the sour cream so it may have been more like 4Tbs.  Also, I defrosted some frozen spinach and crumbled it over the shells before covering with sauce and cheese. YUM!  Thank you Kelly!

Sooo yummy. I made this for my family a few times, and they cannot get enough of it. I always put ground beef in the sauce, and also tried stuffing the shells with spinach. Very very good, thanks so much for the recipe!

I took a lot of others advice and "spiced" up my cheese filling.  I added 1/2 tsp garlic salt, 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning, 3 cloves of grated garlic, and some garlic powder.  I then took some basil from my garden and tore it into pieces and added that as well. I could have probably added higher amounts, but without would've been bland. Cooking the shells 4 minutes was perfect, anything longer would be to difficult to fill.  Putting the filling in a quart sized ziploc bag and then cutting the end is probably the best way to fill the shells (like a pastry bag).  As for the sauce, well everyone seems to have a personal preferance, but please don't do this recipe injustice by just opening a can and pouring it on top!

This was very good.  Since I didn't have montery jack cheese on hand I had to substitute with low-fat cottage cheese and some grated asiago.  Next time I try it I'll make sure to have the right cheese on hand!

This was pretty darn good. I didn't have any parsley on hand so that was omitted. I also used italian bread crumbs so the filling wouldn't be bland. I'll probably cover it next time though because my manicotti noodles were hard in some spots(may be my cooking error...who knows unless i experiment right?)

Excellent. I personalized this recipe by adding an egg to help firm it up when it bakes and I use either tomato sauce or alfredo sauce or a mixture. Since it can be a bit tricky getting the mix into the noodle, I use a pastry bag or plastic baggy with the corner cut out to fill them. I have added this to my list of favourites. My picky husband even liked this new dish. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good - very easy. I followed the insructions from "Manicotti Alla Romana" to boil the manicotti only half-way and then immerse in cold water.  It made them easy to fill. I thought they needed more sauce , but other than that - the filling was great.  My husband loved it - it was his Father's Day meal!

I used this recipe to make stuffed jumbo pasta shells.  
I thought it was good and had alot more flavor than some 
of the fillings I've seen.  I did use a cheddar jack cheese
and put more cheeses on top, which I thought was very 
tasty.  The only problem with them was that I think I added
a little too much parsley, but otherwise, it was great!

This recipe was pretty good but I've had tastier manicotti.  I should have added some salt to the cheese mixture - it was a little bland, I thought.  I added a package of frozen spinach (thawed and drained) to the cheese mixture instead of the parsley.  I used a butter knife to stuff the pasta tubes and it worked pretty well.

Great manicotti, the Monterey Jack adds flavor. The 3-star quickness rating is only because of the time it takes stuffing the pasta, everything else is very simple and quick. Definitely try this dish.

Added 2-3 cloves garlic chopped, thawed drained spinach to cheese mix. Do NOT cook pasta all the way or it is difficult to fill shells without them splitting open - they will cook to completion in oven under the sauce. Cheese in plastic bag with snipped corner makes it easy to fill. Can substitute manicotti for shells to change it up and easier filling.  VERY YUMMY!! Top with your favorite sauce!

It was really good! I made half with breadcrumbs and the other half without. I liked the batch without the breadcrumbs better because I like my cheese a bit more creamy.  I will definitely make this again without breadcrumbs though!

We are a Catholic family who doesn't eat meat on Fridays, so I'm always on the lookout for delicious meatless main dishes, & this one fits that description well!  I followed the suggestions of other readers to cook the manicotti only 4 minutes, & added basil & garlic powder to the filling.  It was easy to make & delicious!  I might try adding pepperoni to the filling for variety.

Delicious!  There are endless possibilities using the basic recipe.  Made my own sauce from scratch with lots of Italian sausage, garlic, onions and spices.  Used a zip lock with corner cut off to fill the uncooked pasta. Filled pasta with white cheeses (skipped the ricotta - don't care for it and used cottage cheese in its place). Also used some of the sausage in the cheese mixture plus an egg to firm it all up.  Covered the pasta with the sauce and baked covered with foil for the first 30 min and then uncovered and added a bag of mozzarella for the last 10 then set the oven to broil for the browning of the cheese.  Plenty of leftovers and even some for the freezer. Thanks for a keeper.  Both my husband and I loved it!

This was delicious.  I took the advice of another reviewer and boiled water and then removed pot from heat and placed manicotti in it for 5 minutes and then stuffed them.  The shells baked perfectly the rest of the way in the oven.  I also added sweet italian sausage to my sauce.  My husband and I loved this.  Will definitely be making it again.  Thanks for a great recipe! =)

I made this recipe for my husband and a dinner guest. We all loved it! Plus, it was so easy to make. I made it ahead and kept it in the refrigerator until we were ready to put it in the oven. For breadcrumbs, I purchased a dried breadcrumb with Italian seasoning.  This even tastes better the next day.

These were good. My bf loved them. He said it was a keeper after the first bite. I added some fresh garlic and basil to the cheese mixture. I baked it covered for 30 minutes and then took it out and covered it with the remaining cheese and baked it another 10 mintues uncovered. I found putting the cheese mixture in a bag and piping it into the pasta worked well. Next time I will try putting a meat suace over it, but we really didn't miss the meat.

yum, yum yum! my husband and I loved this dish! you can also try wrapping the manicotti with breaded eggplant! it's a little heavier of a dish, but that just means you eat less :o) you can even use this cheese mix to make eggplant rollatini! I sprinkled more cheese on top to make it cheesier... I will definitely make this again

Yummy! I took another reviewers suggestion and only boiled the manicotti for 4 minutes. It was very easy to stuff them this way. I think I overstuffed them since I had 4 manicotti noodles left over. If I were to make any changes to it, I would absolutely add more cheese on the top before putting it in the oven. There was not enough cheese. Make sure you have a fantastic sauce ready, since this is super important for the overall taste.

Very good.  Instead of a mozzarella/Monterrey mixture, I used premixed 5-cheese Italian blend.  Also used some more sauce than what was called for.  All around good meal.  My family liked it a lot!

I cooked a version of this recipe, adding in my own additions, but overall, it was very good. The sour cream is a twist I had never seen before in a manicotti recipe. I added some extra italian seasonings, oregano, finely chopped and sauted onion, mushroom and garlic. I topped the bake with sauted italian sausage and mushrooms!

Pretty good.  I agree with the users that are saying to modify the sauce instead of using regular spaghetti sauce though.  We added breaded chicken & parmesan over top of it to kind of make a chicken parmesan manicotti.  It was good.

This was pretty tasty! I did doctor up my sauce with some ground beef and diced tomatoes as we like it chunky.  I also used the ziploc bag method of stuffing the shells.  Messy?  Oh yes.  But worth it!  Also my prep time was more like an hour but I'm pretty slow, LOL.  :-)

Great Recipe! I used a combination of the Manicotti recipes. I really enjoyed it! The shells were a little hard to stuff. The next time I cook this I will try a plastic bag with the end cut to stuff the shells. Also I think I used too much filling to stuff the shells because I ran out by the end.

Excellent and easy...The first time I made this recipe, I put the manicotti on a bed of Italian pork sauce.  Not only didn't I think it was great, my clients weren't so sure either.  The second time I made it, I stuck to the recipe...PERFECT!!!

I really liked this.  I was suprised I didn't miss the parm, but it was good.  I couldn't tell it had bread crumbs in it, the texture was the same as any manicotti.

Good!  I made a few changes, I usually add spinach to the cheese mixture, plus an egg to firm it up.  Usually the manicotti splits, so...I end up laying the filling down the middle and rolling up and laying the seam on the bottom.  By the time it cooks you can't tell.  My sauce is usually a store bought spaghetti sauce that I simmer for an hour or two with onioins, garlic, basil and oregano.  If it gets too thick I add a couple of cans of tomato sauce.  I have browned grown meat and added it to the sauce too just for a little change.  My husband loves it either way!

This was excellent.  Definitely would make this at home instead of going to a restaurant for theirs.  I misread the recipe and added fresh basil instead of parsley, however, and the difference was amazing.

Awesome recipe!  I made it just as the recipe states.  I might use a bit more sauce next time, but other than that it was great!

Very good recipe but I agree with others who said the bread crumbs give it an odd texture.

EASY EASY EASY!! I'm 38 weeks pregnant, and I whipped this one up quick! That's an easy recipe!! I used cottage cheese, b/c ricotta is TOO expensive in HI, and I left out the breadcrumbs, b/c it seemed weird. I used a zip-loc bag to pipe in the mixture, and only cooked the noodles 4 minutes. My husband inhaled this manicotti. I also put in some hamburger to the sauce, as well as chunky veggies b/c that's the way he likes it. WAY TO GO!! AWESOME RECIPE!

I added sausage to the stuffing mixture and it gave it just what I wanted.  Stuffing the shells is a bit tricky to not have the shells fall apart, but still tastes great even if they do. Will make again!

I wanted to like this but I just couldn't.  It was difficult to make, and all I could taste was the ricotta.  The bread crumbs were noticable, texture I guess.  I used meat in the spaghetti sauce.

These were wonderful - it was like huge cheese-stuffed ravioli.  My 4 yr old did not like them which surprised me.  I didn't have enough cheese to stuff all the pasta - maybe I was putting too much in! :o)

This was a little time consuming to make, but definetely worth the effort! It was delicious! I didn't have a piping bag, so I cut the corner of a plastic baggie, and that worked fine. I also used a whole jar of spaghetti sauce. Thanks for sharing! My family loved this dish!

I omitted the parsley and added freshly chopped spinach instead, and only used Ricotta and parmesean cheeses. The recipe was delicious. Very VERY easy to follow.

This was very good.  Since a jar of spaghetti sauce is three cups I just used the whole jar and I'm glad I did because I think two cups would have been too dry.  I used a skinny baby spoon to full the noodles and it worked great.

These were pretty good. I boiled the shells for five minutes but they still split while stuffing them. I'm glad I took the advice of other reviewers and seasoned the cheese mix with garlic powder and salt because it probably could have used more. Very cheesy mixture once baked (no one complained about that!) and it heats up great the next day as leftovers. Will keep this one. Thanks!

This was so easy and so wonderful.  I added the garlic salt to the cheese filling as suggested.  I also added some fresh basil, as suggested, but used dried parsley in a lesser amount.  I tried the suggestion of using a bag and snipping the corner to stuff the noodles, but ended up finding it easier to just do it by hand.  Ultimately though, this was really great!

This was my first run at manicotti, and I think this is a good base recipe.  I didn't realize that I needed seasoned bread crumbs--maybe that would have made it a bit more flavorful.  Overall a nice taste, but a bit bland.  Definately needed more Italian seasoning.  It also took me much longer than 25 minutes for prep time.

I liked this recipe, but the filling does seem to need a little more of a flavor boost. One review suggested garlic...maybe that would do the trick.

I thought this recipe was no better than the recipe on the back of the manicotti box you buy at the store.   It was bland and I thought the texture wasn't the best.

This recipe was not the greatest, just because the manicotti was so dry and it was very difficult to stuff the noodles, plus I found it to be a bit bland.  But it was still good neough to eat! Thanks!

Yum!!!  This was my first time to make Manicotti...I was a little worried about stuffing it.  I decided to use a butter knife and I thought it was pretty easy.  I will make this again.

Turned out great. I did follow the recipe exactly other than the manicotti shells. I did not boil them. Put it all together added sautéed onions per the reviews and left in fridge overnight. Baked the next afternoon. I shared it with a couple friends and they too thought it was great. A keeper. I’ve already made it a couple more times.

I would not use the sour cream and breadcrumbs as it gave it a funny taste. I would try it again with cream cheese and cottage cheese substituted for the sour cream and breadcrumbs.

Tweaked it by adding 1/2 tsp garlic and onion powder each as well as 1 TBSP pesto and 1tsp dried oregano. Filled about 30 jumbo shells. Devoured by guest!

Whoever heard of adding bread crumbs to the cheese filling?  Or sour cream for that matter?  I haven’t.  Add some Parmesano Reggiano and it will add a good salty flavor if too bland.

If I make this again, I would definitely cover this while cooking. My sauce disappeared and the top of manicotti  were very dry. Or increase the sauce or do both! I also added ground beef to the sauce.

Gave 5 stars based on family opinion. They all said they liked
it and most had a second helping. That said, I personally didn't 
care for it as much as other recipes for this dish. There was a
certain tangy taste maybe from the sour cream ?   I will try it
again but omit the sour cream and tweak a little based on some of the suggestions of other reviewers.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe. I served it with Johnchandler's World's Best Pasta Sauce and it was truly better than most that I have had a Italian restaurants. This combo will definitely be a keeper in my recipe collection.

I used Italian Seasonings, Garlic Powder, & Onion Powder for more flavor. I also used the suggestion to add 1 cup of water to the spaghetti sauce instead of boiling the pasta. It was easier to stuff uncooked pasta. I baked them uncovered. My church group loved them. My meat-loving husband suggests adding Italian sausage to the spaghetti sauce next time.

this was awesome! this recipe was nice and cheesy and everything I love about manicotti. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, and that extra Italian flavor was like Heaven. This will be my manicotti go to recipe for years to come.

Great recipe. Of course I add our favorite spices and we sometimes add meat to the sauce.  One tip I would give for the manicotti stuffing...I put the mixture in a zip lock bag, cut one corner a little and wrap like a pastry bag. After the noodles cool down, it's Very easy and quick to squeeze the mixture into the tube. Cookie dough tube presses would probably work also, but with the zip lock bag, no washing, just toss.

I Agree with those who said to jazz up the sauce. Other than that, this was a wonderful recipe. whole family loved it! Labour intensive but worth it. I may try stuffing raw shells and adding water to the sauce to cook the pasta in the oven rather than boing it first.

I tried this recipe & it was easy to make and very tasty - I just found it to be a little dry even though I used a whole jar of sauce but I would make this again

This recipe had no flavor. No herbs or seasonings. I was very disappointed in it. I added oregano, garlic, and basil....yet, the manicotti was flat and overstuffed with just a cheese mixture. I was disappointed in this recipe and will stick to my own....which includes a meat sauce.

In the interest of time I bought ready to bake noodles and filled them.  I make sure to doll up the sauce with herbs and garlic.   Also do this. Dish with meat mixture and cover with meat sauce.  Tip for filling cheese mannicoti
use a freezer bag and  cut one corner.   Pipe in cheese.

This is a great starter recipe.  I switched out some of the cheeses, I found that 2 packs of the five cheese italian blend from the gorcery store works great.  Also, I added sauteed garlic to the cheese mixture before stuffing.  There are an infinite amount of 'tweaks" you can add to this recipe to give it a personal flare.  It did a great job of feeding me and my 3 roomates, who are all pretty big guys.

Disappointing. The piping bag method of filling the manicotti tubes was a waste of time - not only was it just as messy as filling by hand, almost all the pasta tubes ended up splitting. Even though I added Italian seasoning and garlic to the filling, it was still pretty tasteless, plus it completely leaked out of the tubes during cooking. The result was a bland mess. I'll stick to my tried-and-tested manicotti recipe. Thanks, anyway.

The cheese mixture for this manicotti was great.  I didn't use the bread crumbs.  I added ground beef and italian sausage instead for a meat and cheese manicotti.  But the cheese and sour cream mixture was outstanding!!!

This was tasty. I ended up using cottage cheese & no salt & pepper. I used Classico tomato & pesto sauce. This was simple & I would make it again, maybe with some spinach??

The recipe was fantastic. I added Italian Seasoning. The prep was simple and suprisingly fast. I stuffed the shells with a baggie minus the tip. My dinner guests called me a gourmet (HA!) Will definately make it again!

Great recipe!  Instead of the bread crumbs and parsley, I added 1/2 cup spinach and seasoned with Emeril's Italian seasoning.  I also used homemade spaghetti sauce.

Excellent! I usually make a different version of manicotti and this recipe blows mine out of the water. Great stuff!

After a failed attempt to make a tasty manicotti dish on my own, I tried this recipe and I love it!  I did follow a few suggestions on other reviews and added 1 tsp. garlic powder.  Really yummy!

Excellent meal! Very tasty! Easy if you have a way to fill the manicotti shells, such as a plastic bag

This came out pretty well.  My fiance liked it more than I did.  There just seems to be a little too much of something.  But still came out well.

Good recipe allthough my husband did not care for it or our young children. I did enjoy. Could use some more flavor - next time will try garlic and onion and italian sausage in the sauce.

This is okay.  I found the cheese mixture easy to shape with my hands so the noodles were quite easy to fill.  I wasn't wild about the breadcrumbs in the filling though.

Tried this because we were looking for new recipes for Lent.  Excellent and simple.  Even my 10 month old enjoyed it.  Thanks.

This was a good basic manicotti recipe.  I didn't have enough filling for all of the manicotti; next time, I will either not boil all the manicotti or add more cheese for the filling.  I will also add some ground beef to the spaghetti sauce next time to add more flavor.
