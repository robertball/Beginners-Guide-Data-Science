Made this recipe almost exactly as written and it's a great start. The only differences I made was to add the tomatoes and chicken broth to the onions and spices to deglaze the pot so I wouldn't get a burn warning and add a handful of golden raisins since I had them. When I make this again, I think I will double the spices and I will use chicken thigh filets since the skin just got slimy being pressure cooked.

I followed it with the ingredients and just upped the spices by half.  Delicious.  Thank you Diana
