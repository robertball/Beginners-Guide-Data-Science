Delicious.  Used the convection setting on our oven, and decreased the cook time by about 15-20 minutes.  They will crisp up more when they are out....we are hooked!!!!!

The apples turned out delicious!  However, I followed the cooks notes and put the apples on wire racks and reduced the cooking time.  Unfortunately, the apples are completely cemented on the wire racks.  If you follow this method, it is apparently necessary to spray the wire racks.  I will try this recipe again, but will just use the parchment paper with the longer cook time.

I used a mandolin and sliced these as thinly as possible. They needed cooking only 45 minutes. So glad I checked them. I was going to turn them over, but before I could finish the tray, I realized they were crispy. So I took them out. The grands made these and rated them for me. It was a fun kid project. Next time, I would decrease the cinnamon mainly for appearance sake.

Mine got stuck to the wax paper & wouldn't come off. Those that stayed softer, were soggy.

I've already made them twice for my son, and he is in love. I'm going to make it a third time, but I will be using brown sugar instead of white. This is a great way to use apples.

A good way to finish up those last apples on the counter.  Quick to prepare.  Forgot about them until I could smell the wonderful smell of cinnamon,  which I accidentally used too much of.

What a great snack!  These are easy to make although I would suggest using an apple corer to eliminate the core before slicing and baking.  The kids don't even know they are good for them!  Meryl M

I actually changed the sugar content to 0 sugar. I had to lower the temp on my oven to 150Â° and add about 1.5 hours. I followed this basic recipe to make some dried apples and dried plum pieces. Yum.

These were very tasty although next time I will cut back on the cinnamon.  I thought they were a little overpowering.  My bake time was only about 1 1/2 hours.  Any more and they would have burned.  Used parchment paper & they peeled right off, no problem.  Really crisped up nice as they cooled.

Delicious and impressively crispy! I used brown sugar instead of white, but, otherwise followed the recipe as written, including slicing the apples to 1/16th-inch thickness. I will be making this snack on a regular basis to include in my son's school lunch box. It is perfect!

Liked the taste very much. Mine took just over an hour to bake probably due to how they were sliced. Will make them again soon.
