My grandmother made a recipe very similiar to this, although she used a can of condensed tomato soup/can water instead of the tomato juice. And no carrots, but I'm sure they'd be good too.

I am surprised at the other reviews, I have made this meatballs twice and my wife loves them.  So does her friends.

The meatballs did not hold together very well, although dusting them with flour did make them brown nicely.  The taste was very bland also. Would not recommend this at all.

This recipe is really delicious and does go GREAT with mashed potatoes!!  It ends up looking kind of "gross" (to use my kids' description) but it really does taste great -- the leftovers are even better!

Great variation of traditional tomato-based spaghetti when served on top of pasta. I used ground turkey instead of beef and vegetable juice instead of tomato juice. Also, I added mozzarella cheese! yumm...

I used to make this recipe back in the 60's when my kids were little. We all LOVED them and the kids asked for the often. I just found this today, so now I'll try them on my GRANDchildren!

I added to meatball mix for bolder flavor: 1 TBS bbq sauce, 1/2 TBS Worcestershire sauce, 1 tps liquid smoke, 1 tos Garlic Powder, 1 tsp Onion Powder, 1/4 tsp Italian Seasoning, 1/4 tsp fennel seeds, large pinch Salt & dashes Pepper, added breadcrumbs until dryer consistency. Remainder of recipe as written. Served over bow tie pasta.
