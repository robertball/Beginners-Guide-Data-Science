GREAT TWIST ON THE BURGER! A few notes: Use 80% Lean ground beef. Onion and garlic need not be pre cooked before adding to meat mixture. A must try!

This burger was very moist and flavorful!  Great combination of ingredients to change your average burger.  I love the addition of the feta cheese.  I added more pork sausage to get a few additional burgers.  I liked the cheese spread but the burger is good without it!  Will make again using ground turkey next time.

This has to be absolutely one of the best things I have ever tasted! I woke up this morning thinking about it again! The flavor is almost indescribeable it is so rich. The burgers were so juicy and the cheese spread really cemented the medley of flavors! Wow! We aren't big traditional burger fans in our house, so we doubled the size of the burgers so it made four instead of eight and we had them as hamburger steaks. YUMMY!!!

Fabulous recipe "as is".  We have also made it with ground lamb in the place of ground pork.

This was so good... I'm a burger guy and this was impressive... I made them too big like usual, but it was flavorful and moist... no complaints..

The only thing I did different was follow someother reviewer and didn't saute the red onion/garlic for the burger... I think I grilled long enough to cook them nicely.

Thanks for the great recipe... I will cook again and pass along.

These burgers are fabulous!  I accidentally bought ground pork instead of pork sausage and it tasted great.  I also haven't cooked the garlic and onion, just added them it.  Still tasted great!  The key is not overworking the mixture and forming the burgers loosely.  Wow!  Thanks for a great way to pep up our summer!

I was amazed at how much our whole family loved these.  We have a few picky eaters and my husband usually doesn't like to stray too far from the classic, but these were a hit!  Yes, I'd be interested in tips for helping them stick together a little better and since I don't use feta very often, if a person can make the feta crumbles smaller.  But those to questions don't spoil the rating!

I don't know why this recipe doesn't have more ratings/reviews, because it's one of the best things I've found on this site!  I love this burger!  I don't care for sausage, so I've only used beef for these and they turn out great.  We tend to add a little extra wine for flavor, so we also use egg and sometimes breadcrumbs to keep them together.  Also, we LOVE the spread, so we always double, and add a little sour cream to balance out the dill.  Whatever you have leftover (if any) can always be used for dip & veggies.  So good, it has ruined other burgers for me.

Great flavors!  I skipped the gourmet cheese spread, also found I didn't have ground pork defrosted and I totally flaked out and forgot the egg- but the taste of the burgers was really different and delicious.  I will make these again, and use the pork & egg, mine fell apart a LOT, and I know the egg will help that not happen. Dig the red wine in there too.  Thanks!

This burger was just okay. It could use more salt, but then it probably just needs more seasoning overall. Maybe my sausage wasn't very flavorful. I make the Tex-Mex Cajun burger on this site and it's amazing. After that kind of flavor, most burgers just can't compete.

The spread was yummy! The burgers themselves were good, but not too special, as the feta flavour was very mild.

My whole family loved this recipe! The only suggestion I have is to saute the garlic before you mix it in the cream cheese.

I scaled down this recipe and made 1 for myself...it was AWESOME! My only change to the recipe was adding a little bit of good seasonings italian dressing powdered mix to the cream cheese spread... made it a little more zesty :) Overall great recipe!

These weren't bad.  I just prefer to taste a little more of the burger.  I think it should be the feta in the burger OR the cheese spread on the bun.  All that cheese really overwhelmed the flavor of the burger.

I had my doubts when I saw cream cheese as an ingredient but these were great!  The pork really brought a lot of flavor and the cream cheese spread was a nice addition.  I did omit the red wine but that was the only change.

This is a GREAT burger recipe. I have always struggled to make a delicious burger and this was my first real success. My boyfriend loved them so much that he packed the leftovers to bring to his office for lunch the next day. They have tons of flavor and are super easy to make. The hardest part, for me, was making sure they were fully cooked. I don't have an outdoor grill (I have an indoor electric grill) but I can't wait to try the recipe on one when I get a chance.

My husband and I were so excited to try these.  We love burgers and thought it would be fun to try something new.  I'm sorry to say these were not what we were hoping for.  They weren't bad, just not great (the consensus was the same from all six people who tried them).  I would try them again with some serious tweaking.  The feta was good, but the overall flavor didn't seem right.  I think it would be better to use plain, ground pork instead of seasoned pork sausage.  The spread was good, but better on tortilla chips than the burger.

My husband rated this recipe a 4 without the spread but I rated it a 5+ with the spread.  It was awesome!  Definitely a different type of burger but perfect for the summer (and a change).  We did onion rings as the side dish, but I think potatoe salad would be better.

This was a fabulous recipe.  I actually used deer meat and added green bell pepper along with the onion.  It was delicious.  My husband said he would expect to have this at a nice restaurant - not your typical homemade hamburger, but delicious!

We thought these were good but nothing great.  The kids loved them though.  I did use ground chuck and no pork sausage---maybe that's key...?

Phenomenal! 5 stars for a reason! I left out the spread but still fantastic. My husband is the pickiest ever I was a little reluctant to try such an unconventional recipe but he devoured it and asked that he take the leftovers to his buddies at work. That has NEVER happened!

Outstanding recipe.  I created this masterpiece for my sister's surprise 37th birthday party.  I added a bit extra pork sausage (I'm the daughter of an Iowa pork producer)and some extra feta.  I served it on a toasted strip of Rosemary/Olive Oil focaccia bread.  I stongly recommend!  It was amazing!

We liked this recipe. The burgers tasted almost like meatloaf. My husband didn't think it was worth all the extra work of cooking the onions and garlic before adding them to the burgers. He also said next time he would just slather the cheese spread on a regular burger. I think next time I would saute the garlic before adding it to the spread. Overall, this was a nice change of pace.

I really enjoy these burgers.  I made them with ground venison and no sausage, and they were still delicious!  I didn't have fresh basil or dill, but the dried herbs worked great.  I definitely recommend this recipe.

Wow. I don't normally say Wow about burgers but this was great... an unexpected twist on a basic burger.

I am a huge fan of this burger, and my family has requested it often. I do sautee the onion and garlic, as it is a more subtle flavor. I also add extra feta...can't have too much of that in our opinion.
