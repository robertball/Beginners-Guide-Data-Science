These were really good.  Not out of this world/my favorite meal ever; hence the 4 stars.  However, I will definitely make them again.  I chose to tenderize the chicken breasts by poking them full of holes.  They flattened out some too. I then marinated in the wine, thyme and rosemary for a little over an hour (instead of seasoning over the grill).  I topped them with swiss and aged provolone.  Don't leave off the onions (make plenty)!  The onions are very important to this chicken melt in my opinion.  We also put Dijon mustard on the muffins and I can't imagine not having the Dijon flavor too.  I think they would be a little bland without it.  Served with a salad.

Wonderful summer weeknight dinner!  I don't like
Swiss so I substituted Provolone.  We will 
DEFINITELY make this one again!

Thanks for a great recipe!

We thought this recipt was delicious and very filling. My family ranges from aged 73 through to aged 14 so finding something that we all like is difficult but we found it in this one.  Many thanks from the UK.

I have to say that this is a good recipe and glad that I made enough chicken for left overs. First of all I did in with a George Forman Grill indoors, and I added mayo, salt and pepper and one slice of bacon and it is a kicked-up sandwich. Husband loved it ...He gives this a 10 on his food scale ..

This is great!  My family loved it and I was a little surprised they did with the red wine.  But the wine & rosemary are a wonderful combo.  We are not big on swiss, so I substituted mozzarella.  I also made on the stove instead of the grill.

Took others advice & marinated the chicken. It has a hint of flavor, not overpowering. Easy to do, but it isn't anything to get excited about. Will make again, but try pepperjack cheese or mushrooms/red peppers on it also.

This recipe is amazing. I made a few minor adjustments to my dish though. Instead of butter I used oil and added some of Mrs.Dash table blend to both sides. My family was asking for this dish again!! Big hit :)

I think this would be delicious as written. I did make a few changes: for about 5 minutes sauteed the sliced onion in a little butter and olive oil with a teaspoonful of that chopped garlic you get in a jar. Then put in the chicken breasts right in among the onions and slightly browned on each side. Then put in rosemary and thyme (I had fresh) with big splash of red wine and simmered the whole thing for about 15 minutes, 10 of which were covered. For another 3 minutes (about) I put the slice of swiss cheese on, covered. Served with rice. My kindergarten-age boys LOVED this.

This was pretty good.  I'm always looking for non-beef versions and also interesting things to do with English muffins rather than just the old bread sandwich.  It didn't seem real filling though.

The day prior to making this recipe I had roasted a large whole chicken.  I decided to use some of the leftover chicken to make this recipe.  I actually still marinated, like called for and then rewarmed the already cooked chicken.  It was very very tasty.

The only reason I am giving it three stars is because my husband liked it.  However, the man eats anything that doesn't move, so he is not a good judge.  I thought it was edible.  But not worth making again.

Decent chicken melt recipe, though "sprinkling red wine" on chicken while its over open flame doesn't sound ok to me.. I did a quick toss with the herbs, wine and a little bit of olive oil with the chicken in a bowl before grilling. It did turn the chicken a grey purple, but that's what happens when you use red wine on white meat. Next time I'll use white wine instead to avoid the weird staining. I'll also use some mayo on the english muffins before hand to kinda give them some moisture and flavor. Decent, I'll make it again.

I don't think I made this correctly, because it was only okay for me.  I have may other chicken recipes that are much more interesting that I would rather serve than this.

These were very good. Quick and easy. Next time I think I will try a different cheese like pepperjack. Thanks for sharing!

The rosemary and thyme didn't sound like a good fit for me. I used a simple chicken seasoning and cooked the onions and chicken on foil, on a medium grill about 15 min. Moved the chicken to the grill to dry and brown while I grilled rye bread (used mayo), melted the cheese on the bread in the process, and served with spicy brown mustard. It was very tasty in a simple way and only took about 20 minutes, start to finish.
