This was very, very delish! The only change I made was using Grape Seed Oil instead of Olive Oil! BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE... I love stuffed bell peppers but have cut back on rice these days. I took half of the final product and added it to a mixture of browned 1 pound lean ground beef and 1/4 hot Italian sausage and 2 cups of tomato sauce. Stuffed peppers and baked. YUM!

I think this has potential but it is missing something.  Would love to come back to this recipe in a few months and see if anykne has suggestions. 

I chopped up 1 red onion and I could have used much less.  The onion completely over powered the dish.  Also, my husband and I thought it could have used more lime.

I have been looking for a good quinoa salad for awhile.  I am willing to give this another try if anyone has some suggestions.

Outstanding gluten free summer salad. Made it per the directions except that I zested the limes into the onion and pepper mixture. Served it with avocado sections on the side. The family want it every day in place of potatoes, rice, or pasta.

I made a 1/2 recipe, and used only white quinoa, since that's what I had.  This is a delicious summer cool salad--we loved it!

Great recipe. Came together easily and quickly. Decided to add a couple of dashes of season salt in the end. Received many compliments at the bbq. Pairs suberbly with roasted vegetables.

I liked the crunchiness from the onion, and bell pepper. Perfect as a meal on its own. Next time I will try adding diced cucumbers as a complimentary dish to go along with it.

I couldn't find red quinoa in my usual grocery store, Giant, so i used all white instead, and half of it had a garlic flavor I think really blended well with the flavors.  I used twice the amount of red pepper, b/c I love it, added the 2 limes and a couple more splashes of bottled lime juice, and that helped too, with a balancing amount of cilantro of course.  Next time I make this though, one thing I would decrease is the amount of red onion, too much onion!  And I like red onion in general, but, Serious onion breath here. Even after days of making it the onion seems to stay very fresh. I think I'll take the advice of corn and ground beef w/ the cooked onions.  That sounds like a great idea. Thanks!

I ran across this recipe and really wanted to make it, but didn't have all the ingredients. No problem, the basics in quinoa salad are in here, and just like almost any other salad, substitutions just add variety! 
I didn't have a red or yellow pepper, and my cilantro was bad. So I used what I had, green bell, red grape tomatoes (cut in half), Vidalia onion,  fresh parsley, and a can of drained garbanzo beans. So the color palette was pleasing.  I added 
a quarter cup of so of Sicilian white balsamic vinegar.... And it was a recipe keeper. I've since made  just as this recipe calls, and it's also very good.

As written, this is bland. It was somewhat better the 2nd day. Not sure what to add but it needs something. I probably won't be making it again anytime soon.

The predominate flavor was sharp red onion with little else.  If I was doing this again, I would cut down the amount of onion significantly then add more lime.

I agree with one reviewer that it was lacking something. I put in Mrs. Dash, can of corn, more lime juice. It still was not as good as I had hoped. Then I threw in some ground beef I had prepared (browned with onions and garlic and a little spices). And THAT is what was missing. It was so good after that. I'll make again but only with ground beef. Stand alone it isn't all that great.
