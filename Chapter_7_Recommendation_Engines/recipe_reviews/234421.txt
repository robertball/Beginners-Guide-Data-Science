What a fun recipe. I totally didn't read that the marshmallows needed to be cut into half. I used a whole one for each s'more. Making it slightly messy coming out of the pan when cooled...now I know after re-reading it in my review. However, will make again because it was that much fun. The graham crust was really nicely one and had a wonderful crunch factor that we liked. Thanks for posting the recipe!

My granddaughter and I had a blast making these.  The added bonus was that they tasted great, too!  Even after sitting and cooling they were still delicious and addictive.  The crust gave these a really good flavor.  Thanks for sharing this fun recipe, arenee83!
