Made as written except the chard had very long stems, so I substituted that for the celery. The final result was a touch bland, but adding ground pepper helped. The spice level is pretty mild -- maybe habaneros next time? We didn't care for the chilled version and ended up microwaving our bowls a few bites in. It was DELICIOUS warmed. Overall, this soup is a great way to use up old greens, but it needs a little help to be more flavorful and spicy.

I replace Swiss Chard with a full bunch of fresh spinach & 2 stocks of celery.  Also 1-2 yellow banana pepper is enough if you don't like your dairy spicy.  Not too much water - start with a little and bring it to your preferred consistency.  Also 1 handful of rice is also recommended.  The key to all this is to keep it all on low heat and constantly mix, so the yogurt will not overcook.

Made as written except I used a milder pepper.  Very bland, tried seasoning with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion salt.  It did not improve any.
