I've been making this recipe for 6 years and each time I get rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I've sub different kinds of seasonal fruit, such as blueberries, peaches, pears - depending what's in season as well as the cheeses (blueberries and chedder cheese not a great combination, but blueberries with goat cheese or a creamy swiss - wonderful).  Great Recipe.

This recipe went over like gang busters at my dinner party.  I left out the cheddar, added a third can of apple pie filling and added a bit of almond extract to the topping.  It was delicious.

I did this and loved it just as the group of guys I did this for. It is great to make for a large dinner party or for a potluck. I did use 3 cans of the apple pie filling as I found it needed it. Also I used the no boil noodles to cut down on time.

Very good!  This is worth the try if you have extra noodles.  You may want to go the extra mile and make your own apple filing.  Yummy and creative.

I made this once a few years back. I really didn't like it. Normally I love the way cheeses and fruits taste together but this tasted aweful.

This was a wonderful suprise! The noodles help hold it's structure! The taste was like a crisp, yet not as sweet with the adition of the cheese layer!  This would have been given 5 stars if I had not had a little left for the next day and the noodles on the edge were tough and rubbery!

Everyone loved this. I didn't use the cheddar cheese as one of my guests can't eat aged cheese. Next time I will increase the amount of ricotta cheese. I also accidently made an extra layer of noodles assuming it would be three layers instead of two. I also used the extra can of apple pie filling as others suggested. Otherwise it would be too skimpy. This recipe is obviously very adaptable. It was a big hit and I will definitely make again.

This is too much like a desert.  It would taste like a great pie if it didn't have the noodles and cheese in it.  I will not be making it again.

I got mixed reviews on this one. Some people liked it, and others thought the flavor combinations were just plain "odd."

Great Dessert!!!  I had to make it beforehand and so I reheated it in the microwave.  It was still very good, but I'm sure it's better when you first make it.  I would absolutely make this again.  I think I would try using my own pie filing too.

I didn't care for the fruit with the noodles.  Find a substitution and I think it will taste better.  I also didn't like the sour cream.

I fried the apples instead of getting into canned pie filling.  This went together easily.  It looks good and smells terrific!  I'm just not quite into noodles for dessert yet!  The taste is delicious, though!
