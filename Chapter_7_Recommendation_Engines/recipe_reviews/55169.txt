Easy? Yes. Tasty? No.  I didn't like this one single bit.  After it was blended it looked like a jar of spinach baby food.  I was way to embarrased to even bring it to my family for Thanksgiving Dinner based on looks of the dip all together.  I ended up having to go to the store to buy something to bring.  If I try again I might try mashing the garlic and chopping the spinach and mixing all the ingredients together instead of blending.

I loved this! I followed the recipe and spread it onto  a homemade tostada. Next time I will add more garlic. Thanks for a quick and easy dip/spread.

tweaked it - two big handfuls blanched baby spinach (squeezed liquid out), 1/2 pkg herb feta, 1/4 cup parmesan/reggiano, TWO heads of roasted garlic, Tblspoon olive oil, sea salt to taste --  really good on toasted bread, I even spread it on cooked salmon, and dipped roasted potatoes in it, mmmmmmm

I am making this one again for tonight.  It is delicious - the roasted garlic is key!  I did substitute a little feta cheese only because I was out of the Romano.  The spinach does cook down quite a bit so if you need a bigger batch then definitely double or triple the recipe
