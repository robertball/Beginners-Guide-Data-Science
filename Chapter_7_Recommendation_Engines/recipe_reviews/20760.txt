My family and I thought these were fantastic!
I have a "normal" sized crock pot, and found a 1.5 oz bag of peanuts worked perfectly. I used HALF of an Old Bay seafood one-step shrimp & crab boil 3 oz package, and instead of the jalapenos, some (about half cup?) tabasco sauce. I also added some kosher salt (1-2 cups?) since I like em salty. Cooked them in the crock pot on high stirring occasionally for 10-12 hours. Had no problems with maintaining water level.  The taste was fantastic, and due to popular demand had to make a second batch the next day.

I'm not sure how this recipe can call for 5 pounds of peanuts?? Even using an extra large crock pot, I could not put that many in. I filled it with as much as I could, probably too much, for I could not get enough water in it. I ended up cooking them over night, then adding more water in the morning, and continued to cook on low the rest of the day and early evening. I also added salt. After all that said....they are very tasty, and I will try again with less peanuts next time.

I rated the recipe a 4 but w/ modifications it was a 5 star success. Like the others...no way will my crockpot hold 5 lbs & it is a lg. crockpot. I used 1 1/2 lbs (although I probably could have doubled it...just wanted to give the recipe a try first), decreased the spices according & I, too, added at least a cup of kosher salt. Can't imagine the peanuts w/out it. I ahve been munching on them all day!!

Florida is known for its boiled peanuts.  Boiled Peanut carts are everywhere.  When a dear friend came to Jacksonville who loves these peanuts, we tried this recipe.  They were perfect.  We had them in the crockpot for 36 hours.

Oooo These are SPICY! If you like HOT food these are great. I think Boiled PEanuts are an acquired taste. And being from the South I have definitly acquired a taste for Boiled Peanuts. These is a great recipe. Reminds me of the peanuts you can pick up on the side of the road from local farmers in the south. Yum! Great for Football season!! I always bring Boiled Peanuts to tailgate! Be careful not to overcook the peanuts. Nobody likes mooshy Peanuts after all.

I slow boiled them stove-top with this recipe plus Kosher salt.  My crew likes the spice, next time will add LA. hot-sauce.  
I guess it depends on where you live, the raw peanuts are varied in maturity.  Just taste them as they cook.  I pulled them off the stove after about 2 hours.  

They taste even better the next day.  Treat them like Southern Edamame.

I lived in Jacksonville Florida for a month years ago and wanted to duplicate the wonderful spicy boiled peanuts sold roadside there.  This recipe isn't it.  I got a Zatarain's crab boil package and it tasted more like dill than spicy.  Plus they need some salt added, they were very plain.  This was a waste of 5lbs of peanuts!

I tried to follow the advice of the two reviewers below by adding salt and reducing the quantity.  Although I'm glad I used 3 lbs instead of 5, I am NOT happy about the .75 cup of salt I added!  I used two 3 oz. boxes of Kroger dry crab boil and the can of jalapenos.  There was NO NEED to add any salt!  The mustard seeds in the crab boil were salty enough!  Now it tastes saltier than pure salt!  But I found that if I spread the peanuts out on a large baking sheet and wait overnight, the dried peanuts taste much better because the mustard seeds fall right off.

Since I don't know how boiled peanuts are supposed to taste, I have no idea if I did this wrong, or if I just didn't like them.  I added salt like suggested and they cooked for about 10 hours overnight. It wasn't something I would eat a ton of, but I am very glad I tried it. Thanks for the inspiration.

I altered the recipe by reducing the amount of peanuts to 2 12-oz bags, used a combination of hot chili pepper flakes and jalepeno slices, a little bit of sugar (1 tbsp) to cut the heat but still get the flavor, and I would never use anything but Old Bay Seasoning (crab boil). I'm giving four stars because I did have to alter the recipe to come up with a five-star result.

We LOVE this recipe but like someone else said boiled peanuts are an acquired taste :) And I think one of those things that you either love or hate, there's really no in between.

At noon, in a 6 qt oval slow cooker, I put 3 pounds of raw peanuts (could not put more in there), 3 oz of crab boil and 4 oz diced jalapeno peppers with juice. I had Old Bay on hand but did not use it. At 10 PM I added some sea salt but had to be careful since I'm being treated for high BP. Next day at 2 PM I enjoyed a bunch of them. Good recipe.

These were delicious. The heat snuck up on me, at first I couldn't taste it but after awhile it was definitely there. I agree with the size, none of my crock pots would hold that much (we shrunk down the overall recipe and boiled them in pots.)

Sounds delicious but does Anyone know if this would work with already boiled peanuts being reheated in this mixture?

They weren't spicy. Also, 5 lb. did not fit in my crock.
