Looked better than they were, the chocolate kiss saved them. Could not really taste the cherries as much as I thought.

This recipe is very good but it is more invovled than I thought. The cookies were very good and I would make it again but it did not blow me away.

I LOVED these!  They stayed firm yet soft and tasted wonderful.  My husband enjoyed them as well, but could do w/o the nuts!  I doubled the recipe and they still turned out perfect!  This will be a new "Kissmas" cookie!  It's great!

They look pretty and they taste great.  I have made them several times and they are always a hit.  It does take a little bit more time than an average cookie but well worth it.
