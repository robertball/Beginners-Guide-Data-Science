This is very similar to a recipe I've had since the 1960's. It was much older  than that and came with a red velvet cake recipe. The main difference in the way it was written was that it was not chilled, but only allowed to come to room temperature. I have found by experimenting that you can speed up the first step a great deal by including part of the butter  right away, following the procedure you'd use for a basic white sauce.  The outcome is the same, and you don't have to stand and stir nearly as long.  Look up basic white sauce recipes to see what I mean.  This is an amazing frosting, almost like whipped cream, but gets hard in the refrigerator. Bring to room temp to serve.

I have been making this frosting for probably 30 years and it surprises everyone with how fluffy it is. I do add more vanilla than called for .  I also add the flour mixture by the spoon full beating well between each addition, probably takes about 5 minutes to add it all in. 
For chocolate I will add about 1/2 Cup of chocolate chips to the hot milk mixture.  I do not cool overnight I just cool it while the cake is baking.

I love this recipe.  It is wonderful.  However, do not make it on a day with high humidity!  The frosting soaks into the cake.  But on a cool day....it is absolutely fantastic.

FINALLY I FOUND MY MOM'S OLD COOKED ICING RECIPE FOR MY FAVORITE ICING IN THE WORLD!  WITH MOM GONE NOW I THOUGHT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN. - THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THIS GREAT "NOT TOO SWEET" PERFECT ICING TO GET OUT TO EVERYONE AGAIN.  - JUST A LITTLE TRICK THAT MOM WOULD DO TO NOT HAVE TO WAIT SO LONG FOR THE COOKED FLOUR/MILK TO THICKEN WAS THAT SHE COOKED IT SLIGHTLY LONGER UNTIL IT STARTED TO THICKEN....WHILE THE CAKE WAS BAKING IN THE OVEN THE ICING WAS CHILLING IN THE REFRIGERATOR, BY THE TIME THE CAKE WAS DONE AND COOLED ENOUGH TO ICING, THE ICING WAS READY!  - also know that any type of milk may be used like I use soy milk or coconut milk.  ps: Made sure to continue stirring the milk/flour  mixture while cooking, always use cold milk to start that's the secret to this perfect icing! It's totally worth the extra time for icing like no other!
