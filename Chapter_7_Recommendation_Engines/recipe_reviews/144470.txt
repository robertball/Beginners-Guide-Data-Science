This was GREAT!! I was making biscuits and gravy for the kids and realized I didn't have any sausage. Unsure of what to do then, I came across this recipe. I have never had a "sweet" gravy before but figured, what the heck. OMG!!! I added some cinnamon to the mix and I swear it tasted like we were eating cinnamon rolls!! I was dying to find out what else I could dunk in this "gravy"...I have to say that this made WAY too much for 3 of us to eat, you know since I didn't pay attention to the serving size. It is SOOO sweet that you can't eat too much of it at once though. But I will make this again for sure...just half sized!! THANKS!

I am surprised that no one has mentioned that this is a basic custard sauce recipe!  Someone's grandma probably called it "gravy" to get the kids to eat it! :-)

Oh, busymom, how happy I am that I found this! My mom used to make this on cold mornings for us 7 kids in the 60s. I have asked cooks for years if they've ever had it and no one had. I sent this recipe to all of my sibs!

This is alright - nothing to jump up and down about.  It desperately needs cinnamon (I also added nutmeg).  If you're aiming to top your pancakes as I was this morning (To my dismay, found I was out of corn syrup -AND- evaporated milk!), keep looking...

So I made this just little bit ago for my lunch (yeah, I know). I'm just gonna say it now.... this gravy is kinda weird! But I LOVE IT!! I accidentally burned sugar, but it still was great! I spooned it over hamburger buns and regular white bread. OMGOSH! I ate so much!! This is delicious and I still have a lot left over! Great recipe. I'm gonna make this again! :) :) :)

This is AMAZING!  I did add a little extra flour and milk to tone down the flavor, because the recipe as written was actually too sweet for me.  I followed D89Buttons's advise and added cinnamon, and I completely agree: it made the biscuits taste like cinnamon rolls.  SUPER DELICIOUS!

My mom use to make this for us without the egg or vanilla. She put nutmeg or cinnomon on top and we just called it thickened milk. We loved it for breakfast. My sister and I still love it for breakfast.

I used half sugar and half sweetener because I am a diabetic and it was what I had on hand.  I used cornstarch instead of flour and added nutmeg and cinnamon. It was delicious and I will make it again.

This is so similar to a sauce that my mother used to over waffles. I introduced this to my kids when they were toddlers and they wouldn't eat waffles without this sauce.  Now my grandkids insist on having this sauce with their waffles.  Only difference  is my sauce wasn't made with an egg.  Try it, you might enjoy it.

I'm glad I found this recipe.  It was delicious.  My Littles ate every bite.  After adding the egg, I let the sugar mixture cook to caramelize slightly before adding the milk (which I suggest warming a bit).  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon at the end.  I won't be able to make this recipe on a busy morning, but I could reheat it after making it over the weekend.

This was a family tradition whenever I went to my grandparents. Grandma made it without the egg though, and we always put it on toast so we called it "sweet toast". Love it!
