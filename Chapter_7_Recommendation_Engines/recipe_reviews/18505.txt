I will never spend 5 bucks on funnel cakes at the fair again!  Finding the right size funnel in my area has been difficult so we just drizzle them out of a small glass measuring cup.  The kids love these topped with vanilla pudding and whipped topping straight from the can, I prefer fresh strawberries and cream :-)

Excellent. Like other fried foods, very oily.  We added extra flour to make it thicker. It took us two tries before we finally got it right. The first time, it got stuck to the deep fryer's cage/handle-thing, so we removed it. Second, we poured it in too fast and it was a giant blob that didn't cook on the inside. Third time(correct) we poured a small stream in and made circles. The dough started collecting randomly at the top, and then we connected them so they it looked like a real funnel cake. We're college students with minimal cooking experience, and it turned out great, so I believe that the negative comment here was due to the cooks, not the recipe.

I liked this recipe because it wasn't incredibly sweet dough.  I just halfed the batch which made 3 funnel cakes for us!  Good job!

One of the reviewers of this recipe was really mean, if you don't like a recipe just say so, you don't have to insult the submitter.  I added 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla to the batter.  Tastes exactly like the Fair funnel cakes, which means, this recipe does exactly what it's supposed to.  Thanks for sharing!!

I found the recipe to be great.  The only thing I changed was I used a cake decorator which was faster then useing the funnel.

This is soooo Good.  While frying them my house filled up with the smell of our county fair; when they make funnel cakes.  I recommend this to any one wanting a good funnel cake.

I love this recipe.  It was so easy to prepare and make everyone loved it.  You can get fair style cakes at home for less than what they charge at those fairs. Amen to that!

This was great and very easy.  I used a heavy skillet and just enough oil to coat the pan.  I put the batter in a washed out ketchup bottle.  It was a bit of a pain getting the batter in the bottle, but it worked perfectly squeezing the dough out in thin ribbons.  I just added more oil as necessary.  The kids all loved it.

I am so glad that I don't have to drive all the way to santa cruz to get a funnel cake.  The recipe was great and easy.  I added fresh strawberries and whip cream, great alternative for strawberry short cake.

I actually used this recipe to make Deep Fried Candy Bars. Put a stick in the end of your favorite candy bar (I use Milky Way and 3 Musketeers), freeze them, batter them with this batter and deep fry until golden brown.

Easy! I am a high school foods teacher and my students love these. Instead of using funnels, I have them use a large ziplock bag, pour the batter in, and clip a small hole in the bottom corner  to squeeze out. Works like a charm!

This was an exact replica of the fair funnel cakes!  It was so easy and fun to make.  You have all ingredients on hand.  Your family will love them!!  They are great without adding the pie filling but that would be a plus!

Not as good as what you get at the fair, but if you enjoy french toast (like we all do at my house) you'll love these.

I love, LOVE these...and anytime I can get one...I DO.  The only thing I changed with this was to use a pastry bag instead of a funnel (didn't have one to use).  It actually worked quite well.  Thanks for the post.

This was really good.  I gave it 4 stars due to the fact that I did make a few changes.  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the egg/milk mixture and also increased the baking powder to 2 tsp.

This is a great recipe. I made it exactly as directed, and it came out beautifully. My husband ate 4 plates of it... I think it liked it. ;) Great funnel cake. Anyone who thinks it's horrible, obviously didn't do as directed... Oh, and I also added some cherry pie filly on top, came out great. :}

Just like the fair! Any time I am at a place that sells funnel cakes I must have one! -- And I don't share!! Good thing I am only around these places about every other year. And at $5 a pop and every delectable calorie, these are a rare treat. Thank you Tarmia for the recipe. We don't eat out often but my kids constantly ask for 'any specific resturaunt joint.' It is nice to have a few special recipes in the bag, like this one, that my kids can request. Though not the healthiest (since I stock every item needed to make this recipe year round) but it is wonderful to have once or twice a year at home as a treat. I will never spend fair prices again. Thank you!!!

Perfect!  It fries into more than ya think!  My husband made 2 batches thinking one wouldn't be enough, now he has it running out of his ears!  My niece wanted a FC at the water park so we decided to make them since it'd be tons cheaper!

YUMMY!!!Thank you for posting this:-) I scaled it down to 4 and put the batter in a plastic condiment bottle from the dollar store and cut the tip all the way, it worked pretty well! I only had canola oil on hand(it was still so good!!!) I did use an electric mixer to beat the mix and I used a regular stainless frying pan, poured about an an inch of oil in it, waited a few minutes and started to pour, let it cook 1-3 minutes and turned over and did same...just wonderful!!!! i am gonna surprise my hubby with his fav treat when he gets home tonight.

I saw one review that said this was bad... whoever that was probably just didn't follow directions. I cut this recipe in half when I made mine. You really have to make sure the egg and milk are mixed together well. It turned out delish just like the one's I use to get as a kid at the fair! Simple and quick to make.

We usually get that at the fair once a year so it was nice to find this recipe to try.  I halved the batter and mixed up however couldn't find my funnel!  Decided to try a disposable plastic pastry bag.  I folded the end up with paper clip to start and placed bag in a mug to fill up.  It was a little tricky to handle but worked fine plus I got to throw away the bag! Be careful and don't try and turn too soon or they will break into pieces.  I got 3 cakes out of the batter and did each differently.  Powdered sugar, cinnamon/sugar and the powdered sugar/milk glaze.  They disappeared!

I wanted to see what this cake tasted like exactly, so I followed the recipe exactly.  While it's not the funnel cake from a carnival, it's still very good. I will follow the recipe when I make it again, as I didn't think it needed improvement. If I do want a change, I'll try someone else's recipe first. That said, It's important to have the oil at the right temperature in order for the cakes to come out correctly.  Just cooking them a little longer or a little shorter doesn't work with funnel cake.  360 to 375 is perfect. Cook approximately 1 minute per side or crispier go 1 1/2 min per side. A must (for me, anyway) is the funnel cake pitcher.  See photo.  It makes it so much easier.

This was an easy recipe with great results! Other recipes I saw used the cream puff method or added baking soda, which to me can add a certain taste if not balanced just right. I took other reviewers suggestions however and modified the recipe slightly by adding a teaspoon of vanilla to the egg/milk mixture and 2 tablespoons of superfine sugar to the flour mixture. The only other modification was to use 2% milk instead of whole milk.

Since I didn't have confectioner's sugar, I did the old standby of adding some cornstarch to a cup of sugar and blasting it in the blender for a couple of minutes.

The results were fantastic. With the oil at the right temperature, it was almost a flash fry... the oil didn't have time to set in. Came out very crispy and once dusted with the confectioner's sugar, it didn't last long.

Was a good recipe, but it was not a county fair replica....I've gone to the fair every year of my life and it just didn't do it....it should been a little sweeter...it was a good attempt but from now on I'll have to add sugar

I love funnel cake and have not been able to find a good recipe for it until now. I only had self rising flour on hand so subtracted  the salt and baking powder. These were just as good as the ones at the carnivals and fairs. Thanks so much for the great recipe!!!

yum!  I did a few changes though... didn't use cinnamon, I'm allergic, so I put some sugar in it instead.  also added some more flour because I thought it was too thin... oups... wasn't able to make the stream thin enough (had to use a cup... no funnel!) so I had some thick areas that didn't cook up too good... the household (4 adults) put away quite a few of them!  though we didn't cook up the last 3 or 4 worth of batter... we couldn't eat any more!  will be making this again when we have a few friends over so it will all get eatten!

As the recipe is written, it's a little bland. However, with the addition of 1/4 cup sugar (mixture of brown and white), 1.5 tsp of vanilla, and increasing baking powder to 1.5 tsp makes it amazing! So so good highly recommend adding sugar and vanilla!

My boys were wanting funnel cake for a while now, so I decided to try this, and now I think we will have Funnel Cake Fridays, and maybe Funnel Cake Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday And Thursday. It is that good! We did add a little sugar, because my husband accidentally used cinnamon sugar, so I added more to taste the cinnamon but they turned out perfectly and I can't imagine not having the sugar, it was about 2 teaspoons. YUM!!

Very good recipe. Next time I will try adding vanilla.  Fried mine in a wok. It makes it easier to flip also used a metal ring that I had from a funnel cake kit to help keep its shape.  There was something a little off in the texture in mine maybe I had the oil to hot.  The seemed a little to dense but still good we topped with powdered sugar.

this was sooo easy..makes me wonder why I never tried making them before.  We love funnel cakes, but who wants to pay close to $10 for one? We dont have alot of fried foods, but this is one I will certainly make again.  I use canola oil for frying and I was worried it would change the taste, but it didnt.  thanks for such a great recipe..

This is a very good and simple recipe, very similar to the one I used back in the early '70s as a youth.  I added a little vanilla extract, and used a thermometer to make sure my oil temp was correct - but other then that it's very good.  And to the person who gave this simple recipe a bad rating, it appears like you don't really know how to cook - sorry.

Another idea to add besides vanilla would be various toppings...I was at a county fair last week and had a delicious funnel cake...the newest trend is the toppings. Forget just fresh strawberries & whip cream...try caramel or chocolate sauce or strawberry preserves, even apple/cinn. spices, or instead of dipping canybars into the funnel cake mix & deep frying try crushing a candy bar up and sprinkling it over the caramel or chocolate glaze! :O) YUM!

I bake and cook a lot, and this had been a big flop with my dinner guests.  Too much salt, and not enough flavor.  Not one that I will ever try again, I would rather wait for the fair to come to town.

My funnel cakes tasted identical to the ones at the fair.  I am so impressed with how easy and delicious they turned out. I didn't have vegetable oil, so I used canola oil. I will admit, the first cake was a disaster because it broke into tiny bits. I did clean out an empty ketchup bottle and filled it with the batter. After the first mishap, I squeezed the bottle harder and it worked out much better. I am embarrassed that I ever spent $5 or more for ONE of these at the fair.

I will give this four instead of five because I had to add a 1/2 cup of sugar.  I also just poured the batter from my gravy boat instead of using a funnel.  I would definitely make again.

Great recipe and super easy. Just follow the directions and it should turn out just right. This recipe is also really flexable- add some more cinnamon for extra flavor. I also didnt have a funnel, so i just slowly poured the batter with a measuring cup (i also mixed the indredients in the same measuring cup to save dishes) and it turned out great. Cant get easier or better :)

I followed the recipe exactly and would make some changes next time.  I've found it to be less crisp and light as other funnel cakes.  Would add a little more baking powder and omit the cinnamon in the batter and add it to the powder sugar for dusting.

I have been searching for a funnel cake recipe that actually worked!  This recipe is wonderful.  I was making them for my kids the first time and suddenly had a neighborhood of kids at my door.  The second time I made it i used less cinnamon and took bite size candy bars and oreos and dipped them in the batter then dropped them into the fryer.  Another hit!!!  I really preferred  banana slices the best.  Thanks to the person who submitted this recipe!

We loved these! If you use canola oil or something lite, they really are a lite treat with no sugar in the batter and you control the powdered sugar on top. I made half the recipe. It was gone in less than 10 minutes! Very good!

Excellent flavor, the touch of cinnamon is perfect. I tried it as is and liked it, but added 1 tsp vanilla and LOVED it.  I worked at a local amusement park and made funnel cakes all summer long, these are better! Top with strawberries, whipped cream and powdered sugar, the best! 

I put the batter in a squeeze bottle for easy dispensing.

So delicious! I have been lining in New Zealand for the past 4 years and have not encountered a funnel cake since arriving. It was so nice to make them at home today, and eating them brought back so many memories of county fairs and carnivals I used to go to as a kid! Thank you for sharing your recipe :) I think next time I will halve it, though, as we got 8 cakes out of this recipe - way too many for just my husband and I to reasonably eat. I froze the leftovers for a rainy day :)

It was fast and easy and I could get my younger sister into helping. We used an empty Catsup squeeze bottle to keep the mess down and just squeezed it into a small sauces pan. They came out beautifully. I also added a splash of vanilla on a whim and it just sent the recipe over the top.

I love this recipe, I found it easier when I put the batter in a zip lock bag and snipped one corner, but be careful not to put too much batter or it will get all over the place and you wont be able to stop the flow!

The ONLY thing I did differently to the recipe was to use 1/2 cinnamon and 1/2 pumpkin pie spice everything else I followed to the letter. I thought these tasted EXACTLY like funnel cakes from the fair. To the people that complained they weren't sweet enough - what makes funnel cakes sweet is the topping. That's what the powdered sugar is for (or fruit etc). It also makes a big difference what kind of oil you fry them in and the temperature. I did try (on one cake) using barely any oil in a pan (like one reviewer said) and it came out flat almost like a tortilla. Let's face it - these aren't health food so if you want it authentic you're gonna have to deep fry it in Crisco. I did hear Crisco has come out with a non trans fat oil. I'll have to try it. I think this recipe is 100%. I wouldn't add sugar to the batter at all.  I also used a measuring cup to drizzle the batter into the pan. Once you get the hang of it these are pretty easy. They got rave reviews at my house, we just won't be eating them too often.

Great basic batter! I would only say add a touch of syrup or sugar to give it just a bit more sweet, but other than that, good recipe.

Served at my son's birthday party.  Easy to make and tasted good as well.  Added more cinnamon and some sugar to the batter for flavor.  Use a ketchup botttle with the opening cut out for more even and precise cakes.

Fabulous!  Had to add some egg beaters as it was a little too dry to run through a funnel without them.

Good, but traditional funnel cake doesn't have cinnamon so I omitied it. Very similar to an old recipe I got in the 70's from an old PA Dutch woman at a craft fair.

The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of five is that I had to add approximately 2-4 tbsp sugar to the batter.  The cinnamon in it is fantastic - you really can't taste the cinnamon, but it adds a little something which makes these really good.  The texture is perfect, fluffy inside and not too chewy outside.  Overall, it's a winner!

These funnel cakes were lucious!! Much better than any I have had at the fair. There were not greasy at all. I used canola oil and drained on paper towels. I did add about a tablespoon of sugar to the dough since I don't use a lot of powdered sugar. I also added a little more cinnamon. Pure heaven!

One of my fair favorites.  I thickened and sweetened some pureed strawberries and raspberries for two dipping sauces.  Two of my favorite foods combined - funnel cakes and fruit.  Thank you so much for sharing.

My husband and I found these very easy to make and very yummy!! We did add about 2 teaspoons of sugar and a little vanilla to make a little sweeter, I think this tammed the cinammon taste some, so next time we might add a little more cinnamon.

These were very good.  First we tried making them in the deep fryer.  It got stuck in the grates.  Once they were removed, the batter stuck to the heating coils.  Then, we tried a cast-iron skillet on the stove.  That worked well. We were making them for 7 people.  We had a chance to perfect our skills.  We used a glass measuring cup, poured slowly, make big cirly-q's so that when it puffs up you still have space in between the lines.  We topped with powdered sugar. Yum!

This recipe did fry up alright but I was disappointed in the taste. After looking at another recipe I decided to add some sugar to the batter. It helped create an even tone while cooking and added the extra flavor I desired. I added powdered sugar to the top but I feel adding it to the batter made a noticeable difference.

This is really good and easy to make. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 cup sugar because i like my batter a little sweeter. Turned out so good!

Tips that will make your funnel cake better: use a thermometer because if the oil is not hot enough the batter will suck oil and if it is too hot it will be too dark. The funnel cake should be golden color. I also suggest omitting cinnamon because this is a funnel cake not a cinnamon Rolls. Turned out perfect. Btw if you like very sweet funnel cake add sugar in the batter. I don't like sweet funnel cake and this was perfect

So good! I made these a few times with my 11 year old grand daughter. This is a favorite recipe of ours. These are so simple to make and the batter isn't sweet. So you can add all sorts of toppings you'll enjoy. We've even topped with ice cream!  But my favorite is still powder sugar!
I have even made these with gluten free flour for my daughter using Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 flour.  Turned out perfect!
Make some funnel cake. You won't be sorry you did!!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was just perfect! I mixed up the batter and refrigerated it until after dinner. I used my funnel cake pitcher to store and pour the batter, and the consistency is great. I served it with macerated strawberries, whipped cream, and a powdered sugar dusting. My family was fat and happy, I will definitely make again!

Have to give this 5 stars.  These are better than those at the Fair, and I have to wonder if the family that went, "ewe" has ever had a real funnel cake.  I think they were expecting something different.  These were wonderful, and I'll be making them again and again.  Thanks for sharing!  Try sprinkling with some cinnamon sugar.  Delicious!

This did definitely taste like a funnel cake. I added about a tsp of vanilla and had to add additional milk because the batter was a little thick. I suggest putting the batter in a freezer ziplock bag and then snipping a corner to swirl it into the oil. I tried the funnel method and couldn't get it to work. 

As for the review that said this recipe was gross, I'm convinced it's because they didn't sprinkle it with powdered sugar after it was removed from the oil. 

We topped ours with fresh, cut strawberries. It was delicious.

Thanks for a very easy recipe for these amazing funnel cakes.  We live in Kenya and this is my sons favourite thing from our travels in USA.  I added 3tbsp sugar.  My funnel was small but it didnt matter.  Using a jug the batter was too thick n uneven. I put about an inch of oil and fried in a deep frying pan.  Yield was about 8!  Cant be sure they were being eaten as i was frying!  I will definitely be making them again.  Thxxxxx.

Very simple cake. I felt like it could have used more flavor. I added extra powdered sugar because to make it sweeter. Make sure to allow cake to fry for a full 3-4 minutes so it's extra crispy.

OMG! This is seriously the best funnel cake I have EVER had! I believe it is safe to say this was better than the fair's! ( and a lot cheaper, too ) I whipped this up in about 10 minutes and sprinkled some powdered sugar on it, and the whole family couldn't stop! Some of us drizzled chocolate syrup on it, and let me say that was AMAZING! On the more healthier side for me, I topped mine with strawberries. I highly suggest this more than spending 6 or 7 bucks at the fair!

Made these tonight and they turned out good.  I even forgot to add the eggs and we didn't even notice the difference.  Loved the hint of cinnamon also.

Great recipe, I added a teaspoon of vanilla and it turned out heavenly delicious! I had to add 1/2 cup flour as the batter was a bit runny. But the type of flour and altitude can call for an adjustment in measurement of flour used. 
If it didn't turn out good for someone they need to find out what they did wrong!

I was able to do everything in 1 bowl using an electric mixer.  I mixed the milk and egg first then I piled on the rest of the dry ingredients and mixed it all together. I added 1 tsp of vanilla also and took some people's advice and added a little bit more flour. I just melted butter on med-high heat in a small pan. Placed the batter inside  a pastry  bag and fried it in the butter. It came out delicious. This recipe also yields quite a bit in my opinion. It was perfect.

Loved it!
didn't had funnel, but never the less it was delicious . 
I never tasted it before (I'm from Israel, and we don't have these), but now I know what everyone is talking about. 
I'm definitely going to make them again

They were very quick to make and good. Right before frying I noticed there was no sugar in the recipe. I wasn't sure about thAt so I added a fourth cup and they were sweet but not overly. Yum..thanks! Didn't taste like the ones I get a the fair though.

It was only OK.  Nice and easy, but even hubs (who isn't a sweets person) thought it needed some sweetness to the batter.  Will continue looking for a different recipe.  If you're looking for a not-too-sweet funnel cake, this might be the recipe for you.  At least it proved how easy they are to make, so will try again.

If you're using something like a "FryDaddy" with the basket in which the food to be fried is lowered, DON'T use the basket!!!  The batter will drop and adhere to the basket and you'll not be able to flip it nor will it come out easily.

Just made this and I have to say I wasn't impressed. I was surprised there wasn't sugar in this recipe or vanilla. I added both and still it was bland to me. My son enjoyed it and like I said it wasn't terrible just not my favorite.

The kids and I had a great time making then eating this recipe. I found the simplicity of the recipe and process a fun way to work with teaching the kids basic cooking techniques -measuring, etc...
Love the experience of making this recipe. Its taste is accurate to the fun fare and the fair.

I am obsessed with funnel cake!!  This didn't seem quite the same as the pro's make it, but it was still really good.  I didn't have enough oil for the 8 cups to fry it, so next time I'll be sure to use all 8 and see if that changes anything.  The kids were in heaven when I made this, it was a real treat!

It was awful the first try. I ended up adding Nutmeg and Sugar. It now tastes delicious!! I don't think it matters how long you cook it because you'll know when it's ready. I used a measuring cup, but basically anything with a spout will work brilliantly. I'm rating this recipe a 2/5 because the original was BLAND.

I Love Them!! I was searching for an easy drop doughnut recipe and came across this instead. I too added about 1/4c sugar and 1/4c Splenda(R) so my kids won't bounce off the walls too much. I used a small skillet, less oil and just drizzeled batter in with a spoon and cooked until they looked ready.
