This meal was FABULOUS!  I made some small changes-- mostly to portion- I took one good sized boneless breast, cut in in half and then only used one pastry puff sheet cut in half.  It came out beautiful looking *wish I took a picture for everyone* and tasted like heaven.  The herb feta was perfect and the sun-dried tomatoes really added nice flavor.  Whoever invented this meal- I want to raid your recipes!

This was excellent.  Even the kids liked it.  I did not marinade it in the egg yolk, didn't have the time, and I am not sure why you would even need too.  The chicken was very tender, cooking time was right on.  After reading the reviews I chose to cut the puff pastry in half.  I then rolled it out with a rolling pin since someone else said it was hard to get the pastry around the chicken.  After I rolled it, the pastry fit very well around the chicken and I sealed up the edges with some warm water to make it stick.  All the flavors work well together.  I will definetly make this again.

This ia a wonderful recipe, however, I would like to point out that puff pastry and filo are not the same and although either will work, the taste and appearance is different.

My boyfriend goes to school out of town and ever since I made him this recipe he insists I bake it for him each time I visit!  I've even prepared it a few different ways that have gotten rave reviews as well (just to keep it interesting!) Instead of leaving the chicken breasts in halves I've dice it so it's easier to eat when served.  I also use cheddar/mozerella cheese blend instead of the feta simply based on preference.  (I think any cheese would work!)  Adding bacon and/or mushrooms is also an easy way to change it up!

I just want to start out saying that I am not a cook/chef/ have no cooking skills at all!  I wanted to do something special for my girlfriend and I figured that cooking her dinner would show her how much I care for her.  Dude, this recipe kicks tail!  She raved about my cooking.  Seriously it was easy to make, tasted great, and scored me some great points with my lady. Thanks for the easy to make, great tasting chicken dinner!

Wow, I made this for dinner tonight and it came out perfect It's true as others said, you only need half the pastry the recipe calls for ... and I chose not to soak the chicken in garlic and egg (which really didn't matter) instead I mashed some crushed garlic into the Feta cheese, pounded the chicken breast flat covered the chicken with the cheese and then rolled it together and placed it on top of the spinach, then topped it with the basil pesto and dried tomatoes - the chicken came out tender and it was absolutely delicious! My husband just loved it!

This dinner had my hubby raving! He's telling everyone that will listen about this recipe. He NEVER does this. Like others I wish I could give this more stars. 

To make sure the breasts cooked completely through I pounded them smaller. I did use a whole sheet of pastry and that truthfully made the dish even better to me. Never having used puff pastry before, my first one broke completely apart on the seams (felt like a big dummy), but my second one I ran a rolling pin over the seams until they meshed completely and the result was simply gorgeous. Thank you and thank you again for a wonderful recipe that will be used time and again!!

I only wish I could give this recipe more stars!  It is so flavorful and the chicken is moist and delicious.  I followed the suggestions of others and used 1/2 of a puff pastry sheet for each chicken breast.  I also cut up the chicken breasts first before marinating--this worked really well, made the pastry easy to fold and allowed the chicken to have more flavor from the ingredients.  I too want to raid this cook's recipes!

This was great.  I used pre-cooked roasted chicken strips since that's what I had on hand, and used tomato basil feta omitting the sun dried tomatoes.  I also used only one pastry sheet as other reviewers suggested. This would good with virtually any filling, but I loved the feta and spinach!

The flavors in this were amazing. Couldn't find sun dried tomatoes so I used sun dried tomato pesto and omitted the regular pesto. This actually was a good move as some of my kids wouldn't have liked the chunks of tomato and it was very flavorful. I used chicken tenderloins so they cooked pretty fast. It would be nice to find a better way to wrap them, I sealed quite a bit and they still opened and leaked so the bottoms were soggy. I also think you could use crescent dough to make this but I'm sure it wouldn't be as good (but it would be cheaper!). I also think we prefer lots of smaller ones as opposed to several big ones. Thanks for an amazing recipe! PS Tried it with shrimp and prefer the chicken. Also, cooked on a rack over a pan so it was much less soggy - just remember to grease the rack! Can also make this with bread dough - I used leftover chicken so it was already cooked. Remember to put ingredients in upside down since it will have to be flipped over so seam is on the bottom.

Very easy and tasty.  It makes for a nice impression. It was a bit too bland for my hubby and I probably won't make it again. One comment though, on the other reviews. It's somewhat unfair to deduct points on a recipe simply because it is high in calories. I can see doing so for a recipe claiming that it's "low in fat" but this one made no such claims. It was a hit with the family. thank you!

We loved this! I am not a feta fan, but it was great! Making it again for sure!
update: Made this with goat cheese instead of feta. We loved it even better than the first time!

Great recipe!  I always do the recipe as written before making alterations.  The first time through was good, but a bit bulky for  "one" serving.  The second time through, I used "thin sliced" chicken breasts instead of whole ones, used more spinach, rolled the puff-pastry out thinner to cover more room, and made it a slightly 'wider' dish than described in the recipe.  I cooked it the same, and cut each in half to serve.  The result was 4 portions instead of 2, with a little less chicken and a little more spinach.

This dish was a hit!  I had friends over for dinner and they loved it!  I made this recipe with a few adjustments that were necessary simply due to time and what was available to me.  I didn't marinate the chicken, so I minced some garlic and threw it in with the spinach.  I used frozen spinach because I already had it.  My small grocery store didn't have herbed feta, which worked out because it carried sun dried tomatoes in an herbed olive oil, so I went with that combination.  I also used half a sheet of the puff pastry to make it go further, and beat out my chicken breasts  in order to fold them over.  I put egg wash on the rim of the pastry where the two sides would join and had no problems with leaking.  Next time around I think I will throw the tomatoes in a food processor to get them a little smaller, or maybe even turn them into a paste.

Oh yeah! Amazing. Yummy-oso! I diced the chicken, divided into 4 portions for the 4 puff pastry pieces for ease, rolled dough on parchment with rolling pin, threw all the pesto with sundried tomatoes and feta combined, and so delicious! I pinched those little suckers to death to seal them.  I brushed with egg white wash.  Not a drop left.  Baking directions were accurate.

I would give this more stars if I could.  I made this for 8 people and it was so impressive to look at, I felt like a gourmet chef!  I rolled the pastry thin as suggested and baked for about 45 mins.  It was absolutely perfect!  I'm sure it would be wonderful with anything you wish to fill it with as well.  Very versatile and easy to personalize with whatever filling you wish.  Got rave reviews from everybody!

WOW!!!  THIS is a 5 star restraunt high quality and expensive meal you that you can make yourself at home! It is sooo yummy and delicious!!  My only suggestion would be either to use one whole puff pastry for each chicken breast (if the breasts are very large) or splitting the breasts in half and then following the directions for as if they were whole! It was really difficult trying to fit everything into the pastry with the chicken being so big and some of them broke part in cooking, but still, the taste was killer!!  This is a deffinate keeper!!

Update/Edit: I have made this recipe several times, each time tweaking the process for ease and what I have on hand. The easiest way I have found to get this on the table quickly and without fuss, is to cut up my chicken boobs (I've used boneless thighs to great effect too), and simply toss the meat with the pesto, chopped sun dried tomatoes, and minced garlic, and totally skip the egg marinade step all together. I use both sheets of pastry in the package, each cut in half (to make 4 servings total). I lay out a sheet, put on 1/4 of the spinach, then add 1/4 of the chicken mixture, sprinkle on some feta, then close up the pocket and seal/brush with eggwash. Repeat 3 more times, and bake at the same time and temp as the recipe states. Perfect and less fussy than the original recipe. I always serve it with a combination of frozen prince edward medley (green beans, wax beans, and carrots) and frozen fire roasted veggies in a balsamic butter sauce. Both of those I get at Aldi when they are a special buy. stock up! slice up a baguette for eating with the rest of the pesto!

Very good combo.  I suggest adding salt and pepper to the chicken and using some mozzarella in addition to the feta cheese.

I made this for valentines day, following the recipe to a t.  It turned out beautifully!  It was my first time using puff pastry and it was a lot easier than I thought it would be.  I'm looking forward to experimenting with different combinations of meats and cheeses.

I made this last night and it is delicious and impressive! My husband and I both really liked it. For presentation I put the chicken and ingredients in the middle of the piece of pastry. Then on each side in the middle of the piece I cut strips (about 1/2 inch from the piece of chicken) so when I folded it over I criss-crossed them on the top making it look braided almost. I closed in either end because I didn't want it oozing and just did this along the top and it made for a beautiful presentation!

This was fantastic. I felt like we were eating at a restaurant. I would next time pre-cook the chicken a little to eliminate so much juice and soggy puff pastry. I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes or basil pesto, but I did use sun-dried tomato pesto with basil in it. It was delicious everyone loved it and I most certainly will make again. Oh, I almost forgot. I pounded the chicken a bit. I liked to make sure my meat is cooked thoroughly. Who wants to go through all that hard work to wind up with under cooked chicken. I don't :)

For how pro this looks and tastes, there is very little prep involved.  I didn't marinade but put on crushed garlic clove on top of each chicken breast instead. Will try the marinade next time.  FIVE STARS!!!!

Excellent flavor.  I got four servings out of this by rolling the dough thinner and cutting it in half and using four chicken breast halves.  Made very large servings with plenty of pastry. Next time I will slice or dice my chicken first.

Very good.  I used a 10 minute marinade instead of the egg and garlic just to save time.  It was Mrs. Dash zesty garlic and herb marinade.  I think artichoke hearts would be good in this as well.  I really enjoyed this dish. =)

This was alright, but very greasy. If you make it, you should put something on the side to counteract the greasiness.

This is my first review even though I've been on all recipes for years, because this is amazing. The only thing I'd suggest is rolling the pastry dough a little thinner- makes it easier to get around the filling. I think I might have doubled the feta but I did everything else exactly, and I was blown away. I would recommend adding more spinach if there's room as it cooks down so much- and I think mushrooms would also be a great addition.

This was an extremely easy recipe to follow, and the pasty came out amazing.  I did follow the suggestion of others and cut the pastry in 1/2.  I also added some salt and pepper to the chicken before I put it in the pasty (just to make sure it didn't come out too bland).  This is definitely a recipe that I will make again.

I tried this recipe out on my boyfriend who recently started eating meat again.  He loved it.  The flavors were great too.

I did roll the pastry sheets out a bit to be sure that everything fit inside.  I also used thin cut chicken breasts but probably would have been fine with regular ones.

This is a great recipe that I will definitely make again!

WONDERFUL and EASY.  I forgot to marinade the chicken but I can't imagine it making a huge difference to the taste.  I did not follow the recipe as far as measurements, I simply eyed the ingredients as I added them.  I will definitely make again!!!

This is one of my very favorite recipes from this site. It is wonderful!  We find it very filling.  The first time I made it I made some side dishes to go with it, but now it is our whole meal.  It's been a while since we had it! I think we are due again!

MMMMM! Flaky puff pastry, gooey melted cheese, and a wonderful combination of flavors. This is truly a dish that looks like you spent HOURS making... but it took just ten minutes! NOTE: I didn't marinate in the egg yolk; instead, I minced up three cloves of garlic, beat it into an entire egg, and soaked the chicken for just a couple minutes. I don't think the egg/garlic marinade could have possibly made this tastier! There's enough flavor as there is.

For this recipe I used half a sheet per half a chicken breast and it ended up looking really nice.  I did not marinate in the egg because I did not have time.  Instead I just brushed the chicken with the egg, and mixed the garlic with the tomatoes.  I then brushed the pastry with the egg so that it would be golden. I made this for Valentine's Day, so I drew a heart in the top of the pastry with a knife (making sure not to poke it through all the way).  It turned out really cute, and it tasted great!  My fiance gave it 5 stars and my father in law got the leftovers and raved about it!

Ridiculous how wonderful this recipe was.  It is a simple meal that makes you look like an executive chef!  I simplified it even further by combining the tomatoes, pesto and feta together and applying it all as one.  I also have done an Italian version with provolone, pasta sauce and peppers.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was a very simple, very satisfying recipe. I also used one sheet for two chicken breasts, as well as skipping the marinade due to the amount of garlic in the pesto. The chicken came out very moist, with a pleasant tang from the feta cheese. I will definitely make this again.

Wow.  Great recipe!  I did use only one sheet, rolled out, for 2 chicken breasts, used mediterranean herb feta (and used a little more than the recipe called for). Everyone loved it.  I did use the leftover ingredients on a pizza crust (with fresh tomatoes) and that was really good too.

Made this a couple of times with my boyfriend, and it was okay.  The end result wasn't worth the mess I made preparing it - if I were to make it again, I'd probably add more feta.

I made this for my husband last night and he said it was really good.  I followed the recipe exactly except used a less puff pastry.  The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it's too high fat/calories to make often.

VERY VERY VERY tasty. I do not think I would make again though. WAY too greasy and WAY too much fat and calories. I have a recipe for a whole wheat pie dough that I think I will use next time.

4 1/2 because my husband loved it, but I just thought it was fine. So high in calories, though! I used canned chicken, and I actually think that might have worked better than whole chicken breast.

Very nice! I used frozen chopped spinach. I layered the spinach, sliced chicken breast, minced garlic, pesto, sun-dried tomatoes and crumbled feta. And I only used a half puff pastry sheet per serving. Turned out perfectly. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this several times and love it. I pre-cook the chicken to prevent the juices going in to the pastry, and as I generally make this to re-heat for lunches I found it works better cutting the chicken up and (after cooking) mixing it in with the other ingredients to put it in the middle of the pastry.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  We used a half sheet of pastry per chicken breast half (rolled out, as recommended by another reviewer).  I do think the marination is important, because that's how the garlic flavor gets imparted into the chicken.  I marinated for about 5 hours.

I cut up the chicken as well, and didn't use the egg or marinate them. It's good, but the flavor is predictable and boring.

This is the first recipe I have rated or reviewed and I felt compelled to do so because this recipe is so incredible!  Our company said that it was better than an expensive restaurant.  Like others I rolled out the dough and was able to wrap two breasts per sheet.  I brushed them with an egg wash, and instead of cutting them to test doneness, I used a meat thermometer.  If you're serving this for company, go easy on the hor d'oeuvres because it packs quite a punch!

I have made this recipe several times now and my favorite way to make it for 4 people is: cut both the puff pastry sheets into 4 pieces, and roll out into approx. 8x8 squares.  (I separate them with wax paper and put in the fridge in a plastic ziplock.)  Then I  cube three or four large chicken breasts, marinate for about an hour in garlic and olive oil, then I saute the chicken in a skillet with some balsamic vinegar until mostly cooked, turn down the heat, add tomato basil pesto and the fresh spinach and let the spinach wilt.  Once the spinach is wilted, I bring out the pastry squares and fill each one with the chicken mixture and then sprinkle with feta cheese and fold over and seal (like an apple turnover), and bake until the pastry is golden brown.  I find the smaller portions much easier to eat and uneaten ones can be easily reheated for lunch.  Also, I know the chicken will be fully cooked.

Awesome. Easy to prepare. In fact I prep it ahead, wrapped in plastic. When it was time to bake, I just uncovered it an popped it in the oven. I marinated my chicken in lemon, garlic, oregano and a touch of olive oil and pounded them even. I didn't measure anything, and probably doubled everything except the chicken. I used two sheets of dough, and filled it as much as I could. This would be great with different combinations too - artichokes, mushrooms, capers, dill...  Thanks for the wonderful recipie idea!

Oh wow, this has got to be one of the best recipes I've made from this site. I cubed chicken thighs, and marinated only for an hour. Used homemade pesto and homemade sundried tomato paste. The flavors went together so well! Used all the garlic called for in the marinade, and discarded part of it along with the excess egg. My roommate raved about it and said that it tasted like something you would pay good money for in a restaurant. I think that cubing and then marinating with the garlic gave the chicken a very good flavor. Added a pinch of salt and some chili flakes to the marinade. Used milk to seal the edges, and then pressed down with a fork for a nice pattern. Not the healthiest of meals, but oh so good.... Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I am in love with every ingredient in this recipe, so I guess it is no surprise that I liked this recipe.  I could not find herbed feta, so I used plain and threw in some italian seasoning.  Next time I would probably dice or at least flatten my chicken so it is easier to eat.  Also I made the mistake of using store bought pesto; always use home made pesto, it is so much better!!

Pockets of deliciousness!  The flavors of this were just wonderful together.  As my husband was eating it and oooohing and aaaaahing, he asked me when I would make it again.  I used one sheet of pastry rolled out a little, then cut in half.  I had one humongous chicken breast, so cut it into bite-sized pieces and split it between the two halves of pastry.  Didn't marinate the chicken, though.  Otherwise, everything else the same as the recipe calls for.  Chicken was cooked perfectly, and this is something we really enjoyed.  Thanks for another keeper!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. The chicken was incredibly tender! The only trouble I had was with the puff pastry but I suspect it was my inexperience with the pastry rather than the recipe.  Next time I might add more spinach and some garlic before baking and do a little less pesto, just to adjust to my family's taste. Not our new favorite but I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy and so easy! I just took mine out of the oven and had to taste. I hope the rest of my family likes it as much as I did. I especially love that it's an all in one. Veggies, protein and carbs in one dish.

This was SOOO good! I followed the recipe except for the yolk part (forgot about it) and I cut the raw chicken into 1-inch pieces as suggested by other reviewers. The flavors are strong and delicious! My pastries looked like burritos after I wrapped them (about a foot long). Brushed with egg whites before baking to get a nice golden shine. 36 minutes was perfect! Can't wait to make again!

This recipe was quite tasty!! I used the whole egg instead of just the yolk, kept the egg mixture and coated the pastry before putting it in the oven (egg wash to make it golden brown).  This recipe went perfect with a raspberry pastry desert, I didn't have to waste the other sheet of puff pastry.  The oven was still hot to cook desert.  Great recipe!!

I really liked the flavours, potent but good. You have to really like mediterranean flavours to enjoy this. I followed recipe exactly, but I did change one thing. The first 2 pastries I made exactly how they said. And then after discussing with my bf we decided that smaller portions would be better, due to the strong flavours. I then used up the rest of the ingred. and made mini app size portions....super that way too.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  The only adjustment I made was to use one sheet versus two just as most people suggested.  I had a bit of trouble making the dough fit around it all, but I made it work.  The flavors mesh so well together.  To reheat the leftovers, I just popped them in the oven for about 10 minutes at 350.

I agree with another reviewer who felt you didn't need to marinate the chicken. I skipped that step too- the flavor in this dish is high already. Rose- you are a genius- thanks for sending.I urge beginners to try this-Easy , with impressive results.

This was so delicious!! To eliminate some of the calories and fat I substituted whole wheat phyllo dough for the puff pastry. Other than that I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except I cut the 2 chicken breasts in half, making 4 pieces. It was really great, though I do plan on making changes the next time. I think I will sprinkle some salt over the chicken breasts and add more feta, pesto and a few more sundried tomatoes for even more flavor. I loved the crispiness of the whole wheat phyllo dough and I plan on making it that way everytime!

I didn't marinade, didn't have the time. It came out great! I forgot the pesto to, I was in a hurry, made this so quickly it was nice and easy. Used only 1 chicken breast, cut it in half so it was thinner, then again the other way so i had 4 smaller pieces. I made 4 smaller sized puffs. Served with steamed veggies. yummy, will make again.

My husband really loved this. I thought it was a little tangy for my taste, I would probably leave out the sun-dried tomatoes personally, but our guests all raved. I used a half sheet of dough for each one, and they still turned out HUGE.

Delightful! The only bad thing -- all the calories! There were about 1000 calories just in the pastry alone! After knowing that, I halved mine with my husband, who also thought this was a huge hit! My entire family *loved* it!

This is an awesome recipe...so easy and so flavourful!  I used regular feta, as I did not have any herbed feta around.  I did, however, think that the 3 tablespoons of garlic was perhaps a typo and used 3 teaspoons instead (I can't imagine the overpowering flavour of 3 TBS...ack).  The result was out of this world.  I will definitely make this next time company comes around.

After reading a couple reviews I used one box (which has two squares) of puff pastry for 4 chicken breasts. I rolled them out very thin.
I didn't do the second layer of spinach cause I felt it was getting very fat and I wouldn't be able to wrap it properly. 
I like the combination of flavors the sun driedk, the pesto, the feta, the spinach.
It was ok....I will make again, but with modifications. Next time I'd probably cut the chicken thinner and maybe smaller chunks, as well maybe I would marinate the chicken in the pesto so the chicken itself isn't as white and bland. Or maybe even try a mixing small pieces of chicken with the feta and tomatos before putting in the pastry...
AS WELL: in reply to some other people's reviews, the receipe calls for puff pastry not phylo dough...

This is delicious. I used sundried tomato pesto instead of sundried tomatoes along with the basil pesto and the result was wonderful. I made it again with pre-made pie crust and that turned out good as well.

absolutely delicious! Used "eat well, stay healthly precooked chicken", infused the sundried tomatoes with olive oil, put extra feta, and brushed the closed pastry with egg yolk. Doesn't get any simplier.

Wow! but with a few changes.  Rather than using the chiken as an entire breast, cut it into small pieces.  Rather than layering the ingredients, mix them all together and place in the pastry.  We also used half the dough by rolling it out.  An impressive delicous meal.

This was excellent!  The only addition I made was to add toasted pinenuts. I also cut the chicken into strips.  Will absolutely make this again.

Delicious... extremly flavorful. I used half the puff pastry as suggested and still had some trouble finishing my plate... That's still a lot of puff pastry!! Maybe next time I'll use some brick pastry instead.

Restaurant quality!  I used 1/2 sheet of puff pastry rolled out a little to make getting the pastry around the chicken a little easier.  I used some 'mediterranean pesto' (seemed like olive tapanade) instead of the pesto and sundried tomatoes, I used fresh spinach and herbed feta cheese.  YUM!  The cooking time for mine was a little longer because my chicken hadn't thawed all the way when I wrapped them.  I think this dish is very versatile and I plan to use it a lot with all kinds of different things with the chicken!  (I also didn't marinate ahead of time and the chicken was still great- and the leftovers warmed up for a delicious lunch today!)  Thanks for a keeper!!

I loved the flavor combinations, but next time I will switch out the feta for some goat cheese so that way it is a little more creamy and stands up to the other strong flavors.

This chicken dish had very good flavor. I used Classico's sundried tomato pesto & it tasted great. I would highly recommend taking out ONE sheet of phyllo dough at a time. It dries out very quickly. Also, use a cooking spray (like Pam) to lightly coat the sheet of phyllo dough. It keeps it more pliable & sticks together without tearing. It is a lot less fattening than using butter (which by the way, is not in the recipe either, which confuses me - you have to use something to seal the dough with, it tears too easily and doesn't stick on its own).

So I read alot of the reviews before stating this. I was so unsure and had the chinese place on speed dial incase all hell broke lose! But my man loved it! and it turned out great and golden. A few things, Yes, I technically only needed half of the whole puff pastry, but I was new at this so i kinda wasted, and cut the edges and threw out the excess. also, I didnt have herbed feta or sundried tomatoes, but i did have sundried tomato basil pesto, and I did not soak my chicken, instead after washing them, I rubbed them with basil, garlic  salt and pepper. I put an egg wash on them after sealing them shut with warm water and my fingers. Yes, some juices did seep out but it did not make it soggy, it was crispy flaky, and only in the oven for 38 mins. very tasty!!

This was delicious! The flavours blended well. I would definitely make this again. The only thing I would do differently is add a little more feta. Didn't marinate chicken for the full four hours, but it was still juicy and full of flavour!

Delicious. Rather than marinating the chicken, we mixed the garlic with the feta cheese and used it as a dry rub on the chicken and it worked out.

I found this on the UK all recipe site first. It worked out really well. I will be cooking it again using some modifications to the ingredients. Nothing wrong with these, but would like to try some other combinations.

Very good. This smells -amazing- coming out of the oven. I expected the pastry to be more doughy after reading other reviews, but it came out really flaky on top. I chopped up my chicken and added Italian herbs to that as I only had regular feta cheese. Feel free to be liberal with the sun-dried tomatoes and feta. It is great as-is, but the flavors mesh so well that it could stand to have more. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious!! I followed the recipe almost exactly, but instead of the garlic & egg yolk for 4+ hrs, I brined the chicken with two cups of water, 3 tbsp salt, 2 tbsp sugar, 1/3 of a diced green apple and an equal amount of diced red onion in a medium metal bowl. I covered the bowl with tinfoil and refrigerated it for thirty minutes. I then set up and baked the chicken pastry puffs and served them with a small spinach salad topped with red onion, apples, strawberries, and balsamic tomatoes. Very yum and also very filling!

This was possibly one of the most delicious recipes I've ever made. I followed it exactly with only two exceptions: I marinated my chicken for about an hour in olive oil and Mediterranean spices, and I did cut my pastry into 4 pieces and rolled them to be slightly bigger to fit all the ingredients. This is only because the pastry comes in a rectangular shape instead of square. I think anyone who said it was soggy or bland simply didn't make it correctly or use the correct ingredients. Be sure to read the thawing instrucions on the puff pastry. It is a very heat-sensitive material so you have to thaw it properly. I usually place my cutting board in the freezer for about 20 mins before I put the pastry on it to prevent it from pre-cooking. All-in-all this truly was super delicious and I would make it again without changing a thing!

Loved this, and it was so elegant!  I thought the egg-garlic marinade was a big strange, so I didn't do that part.  I used only 1 chicken breast (not sure how two would've fit with only 1 puff pastry sheet cut in half?).  I cut the chicken breast in half and pounded it a little thinner (or the puff pastry would have burned by the time the chicken was done).  I thought the recipe lacked the basic salt & pepper, so I sprinkled the breasts on both sides (was so glad I did!).  I put 1/2 tsp. crushed garlic on each breast before topping with the other ingredients.  Note that reduced fat pesto and feta cheese work fine in this recipe!  I brushed my puff pastry with a beaten egg to make it glossy, and baked it for 35 minutes.  Fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe!

Believe the hype, this is 5 stars!  I used 4 thin sliced chicken breasts and 2 puff pastry sheets cut vertically.  I pressed the sheets out a little bit to make it easier to seal.  I sealed them into a square shape and pressed the edged with a fork.  This made 4 square pockets. I used plain feta and it tasted great without any added italian spices.  I did marinate the chicken, but I used 1 TBS of chopped garlic...and felt that was plenty!  I put 1 heaping teaspoon of basil pesto on each piece of chicken.  It was done at 35 mins, but felt I could have taken it out a little sooner.  Check the internal temperature at about 30 mins.  The moistness was awesome...so I think it was worth marinating.

Sun-dried tomatoes overpowered the other flavors, could be because I used some in oil instead of actually dry.  Also my puff pastry sheets were too small when I cut it so I had to roll them out some.  And when I cooked them, there was a lot of liquid in the pan so the bottoms were kinda soggy/slimy. 

Next time I double the feta, halve the SDT and put the whole thing on a rack to keep it out of the liquid.  And may use full sheets instead of half sheets.

These puffs were really flavorful. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I made smaller, hand-size puffs, and wound up dicing the chicken before hand. I used frozen (thawed..really) spinach, but make sure that you squeeze as much liquid out as possible otherwise it makes the bottom of the puffs a bit ooey-gooey. Also, next time I would salt and pepper the chicken because it was a little bland if you got a bite of it by itself. I also sauteed some onions and added them to the pile. Super yummy! I will definitely make them again.

My family loved this.  We normally don't eat things like this for dinner but it was great.  I used chicken tenders instead of large breast pieces.  It cooked quicker and easier to cut.  Next time I will use more of the filling for more taste.  I have thought about making this dish in a casserole dish instead of individual puffs.  I have an 11 and 7 year old boys and they both liked it.  Gave it 4 stars because I would have liked more spinach and pesto inside the pastry.  Enjoy!!!

Well my mistake was buying phyllo pastry as I could not find puff pastry.  I worked but I am sure the puff would be way better. Second,the company was late so it was a bit overcooked.  The flavours were lovely.  Next time I will use the puff pastry and increase the feta a bit.  I too, just eyeballed the ingredients.

This was soooo good! I just made it for a Valentine's Dinner and it was a hit!  I made 4 big portions (1/2 sheet of pastry used for each portion) and cut them in half for 8 smaller portions (it's actually not that bad nutrition-wise since this is probably the portion you should eat anyways).   I marinated the chicken for about 5 hours and used regular feta because the store closest to me didn't have herb feta. I also cut the chicken in bite size pieces.  Other than that, I followed the instructions provided and was very satisfied with the results! Paired with a nice salad, side, and glass of wine and you have an amazing dinner!  I will be making this again... probably this week some time! Mmmmmmm...

I swear this is the BEST chicken recipe ever! I was really surprised and the only change I made was to leave out the spinach (as I do not care for it). The Pepperidge Farm pastry is the best one to use and make sure to allow the chicken to marinade over night...it really does make a difference. Just try this one and you will be hooked! Will be making again and again...A+

Great recipe, easy to prepare.  I did not marinate the chicken, started too late, but didn't feel like it was missed.  Felt like I was eating at a restaurant, but at my own table!  Added more pesto and sun-dried tomatoes than the recipe stated.  One of my all-time favorites.

Absolutely amazing! I remember while in college I made something like this very similar in a resturant I worked at. We used fillo. So I did that instead of the puff pastry. My husband loved it and my kids ate it which is amazing in it self that they cleared a plate. Definitely a meal to wow dinner guests!

Very garlicky!  I doubled the recipe so we could have leftovers.  I also rolled my puff pastry out to stretch it a bit so I could use a 1/2 sheet per chicken breast.  The chicken breast was not totally covered by the pastry, but it was still very good, plus it cut down the calories per serving by only using a 1/2 sheet per chicken piece.  A whole sheet per chicken breast would be way too much.

This was delicious.  Great flavors...but maybe a bit strong on the garlic for my taste...and I love garlic.  Next time I will use less.  Great recipe though!

this is delicious! here are my changes to suit me - bitesized precooked marinated chicken. I used one half the sheet of puff pastry per serving. used far less garlic & pesto, also used plain canned chopped tomatoes, very well-drained. as for the cheese, I recently made Stuffed Mushrooms III recipe from this site, submitted by LisaB and the leftover cheese mixture from it, I used with this recipe.  BOY, it turned out great! this recipe is a keeper! Thanks, Rose :)

This recipe was excellent and got rave reviews from all who tasted it.  The only thing I did different was, I didn't marinate the chicken.  The chicken breasts I get are very large and I was afraid they might not cook through without burning the puff pastry.  So, I cubed the chicken and cooked it off with a little salt and pepper first.  The chicken was a little dry, so next time I might pound out pieces of the chicken instead.

This was good but if I were to make it again, I would absolutely do as other reviewers suggested and cut the pastry in half. I used a whole sheet and it was way too much. I believe that by using a half of a sheet of pastry that the dish would have been more flavorful.

Yummie!!  This was great!  I followed the recipe to a T, except I did use one pastry puff and cut it in half.  And it was great!  Came out perfect and I am new at cooking.  Very easy too.  Will definitely make again!!  For guests next time.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Loved this recipe and so did my husband.  It was a little annoying trying to wrap the pastry around the ingredients.  It looked like a giant ravioli before baking it in the oven.  Well worth the difficulty of stuffing all of the ingredients inside.

Very tasty and highly recommended.  For two people, I used only one sheet of puff pastry -- rolled it out.  Instead of using store-bought pesto, I used a homemade version.  I pounded the chicken breast to tenderize it.  I also seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt.

Takes a bit of time but is actually very straight forward.  Only changes I made were to use my own puff pastry (Gordon Ramsay's recipe) and to fold the pastry differently with seam well-crimped on the top and ends.  Don't forget an egg wash to get that nice golden colour.  Also used half-breasts to make a smaller portion.  Served it with a greek salad.  Makes an impressive looking dish and tastes great!

Made this for Valentines Day dinner.  I was supposed to be something special because we usually don’t eat anything with puff pastry.
However, after following the recipe to the letter, it was very bland to my taste.  I noted that the recipe doesn’t call for any herbs or spices as is so common in Mediterranean dishes.  I believe that it needed more.  I probably won’t make this again.

This recipe just didn't do it for me. I followed directions exactly. End product was oily, and didn't puff as I expected. I did use "puff pastry " sheets. I have frozen uncooked bundles in the freezer. Will let you know if these happen to turn out better.

I really liked this recipe. I will make it again no arguments. The chicken was juicy and done. Now, I think it is a bit too big in terms of portions. One breast per person is a little too much in my opinion if the breasts "halves" are big. I cut each crosswise in half so I ended with 4 pieces. I added salt and pepper to the egg yolk marinade too. In my opinion it needs it.  Also, I tried several ways of folding/shaping the puff pastry: square, pyramidal, rectangular, semi-circular. My recommendation would be to dab the edges with a bit of water to seal them however shape you decide to make. Also, add 1 Tbsp of water to the egg white to make a wash and brush it on top of the pockets to get a nice golden crust. Sprinkle poppy seeds or sesame seeds (white or black) and you will have a nice meal that is guaranteed to impress. Tasty!

I LOVED this, and more importantly my family loved it. I used a recipe for cilantro pesto that included pistachios off the bonappetit website,  if anyone is interested in trying that, I highly recommend. The earthy taste of the pistachios just matched so well with this dish. So... the chicken breasts that I purchased were way too big for just 1 sheet of puff pastry, that's my own fault. I ended up using the puff pastry as a blanket instead of a pocket but the chicken was still moist and the cook time of the recipe still worked as well. I would encourage an egg wash on the puff pastry. 5 star recipe, will be using again!

My family LOVES this recipe!  I sous vide the chicken breasts ahead of time then wrap them with all the goodies in it and bake it until the pastry is brown.  I use one breast per half a sheet of puff pastry.  You don't even have to seal it.  Brush the pastry with olive oil to make it nice a brown.

This was an awesome quick and easy recipe. I rolled out the puff pastry so it was pretty thin and that way only had to use one sheet to cover both of the chicken breasts. I used 2 very thin chicken breasts that I marinated in a plastic bag overnight instead of a glass dish. Served this to a friend and lunch and it was a huge hit.

My husband loved it but I found it surprisingly bland as I enjoy more savory foods. Next time I will probably use a different type of cheese and add salt & pepper to the marinade.

So amazing!  The taste is just perfect, and although the puff pastry can sometimes be a little difficult to work with, it was an easy meal to make that turned out delicious.  The whole family finished it quickly and would have happily had more.  I forgot to buy the sun-dried tomatoes, so I just chopped up a tomato into it, that worked quite well for us too.

I made this last night for dinner, and it was awesome!  One of the best dishes I've ever made. The chicken was extremely moist and tender, and the flavor was magnificent.  This makes enough for four easily.  Serve with mixed vegetable, AWSOME!

Fantastic!!!! the portions were large, so we actually shared 1 chicken breast and ate the other one in the morning!  So easy, I marinated overnight and it was simple to bake.  I highly recommend it.

This was pretty tasty. As other reviewers suggested, I cut up the chicken and cut one rolled pastry sheet into quarters to make four portions total. Used oil packed sundried tomatoes and marinated the chicken in a bit of balsamic salad dressing before wrapping. I didn't have any pesto so I didn't use any. Would like to try again with mozzarella or provolone. Overall a nice imaginative recipe. Thanks!!

These were ok. Husband liked them, but I thought they weren't very flavorful. If I make them again, will try to use a more flavorful feta.

Cut my puff pastry into thirds, so one full box of pastry made six "sandwiches".

This recipe stands a solid 5 stars as-is.  However, I have tried this recipe a number of times with some alterations.  I tried filo once, different cheeses and one time I forgot the egg mixture.  Here are my thoughts: don't bother with the egg and garlic dredge, it's extra work and not necessary--use mozzarella or, even better I have a shredded mozzarella/provolone mix--skip the feta.

Yummy, I didn't marinate overnight. I cut the chichen into small pieces and just made a big calzone like thing. My husband loved it too. I thought there would be too much garlic but at the end it was enough.

MARVELOUS!  Made 4 different puffs...all with pesto and spinach, but tried some different toppings e.g., roasted red pepper and mozzarella cheese.  Also tried different shaping of dough.  Can't go wrong with anything you try with this recipe...EXCELLENT!

There were no leftovers for this one.  The kids didn't even complain about the sundried tomatoes. I used a round puff pastry and spread out the chicken for one big pie.

You can sum this up in one word, flavor. Made this just as stated & this is a real nice, easy recipe that I'd use for "special" times. I had reduced the recipe to 2 servings, but will make one minor change next time. I'm going to use only one pastry sheet, cut the chicken into strips & make the servings smaller still. My husband said you could add mushrooms, but I'll decide then. Since I know that using our oven bakes faster than time usually requested, ours was done in 30 min.

We had this last night, and it was great. I only marinated for about 1/2 hour, and I cut up the chicken into small pieces. I used full pastry sheets, folding the corners in onto each other, and baked with the folded side on the bottom - no sealing required.  I used two medium chicken breast halves, and had leftover filling, and these things still came out huge. I could have fed two extra people. I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks!

Delicious! It looked like something out of a French retaurant. I cut the pastry in half as others recommended and since I didn't have any spinach or tomatoes on hand I added onions to the feta and pesto. Sooo good!

Just great, we really enjoyed this, I changed marination to using pesto & garlic only, cutting chicken breast in half to make thiner, overnight in a ziplock bag, everything the same except i dont measure so i added a little more of each, very moist and Delicious. I'll make it again for a Birthday dinner in a few days.

Very good.  I did add kalamata olives and extra pesto.  I would have given it 5 stars but my husband gave it a 4.  I also only used half a sheet of puff pastry per chicken breast.  Very pretty, I will make this when I have a dinner party...it is impressive looking :)

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY! I cut my chicken into bite size pieces instead of cooking them whole, and I like my food to burst with flavor so I upped the pesto sauce to about 3 or 4 Tbsp. and the feta to about 3/4 cup. SOOOO GOOD!  5 stars no less.

This recipe sounded good and my husband and I love Mediterranean food. I was surprised by just how good this was. Great flavor. We were suppose to take this to Dinner with friends but ended up eating most of it and had to make something else.

Very good, pretty simple. I chopped the chicken up before marinating so it would be easy to dig into once it cooked. I added some kalamata olives for fun. One pastry easily serves 2 people. Its a LOT of food.

This was sooo good. Even my picky kids loved it. My only problem with it was that I kept going back and picking at the leftovers until I was miserable. I didn't follow the recipe exactly due to lack of on-hand ingredients. I marinated the chicken for several hours in a bottled garlic/herb marinade, so I didn't use egg. I didn't have any sun dried tomatoes so I used a can of diced tomatoes (drained) for tomato flavor. I will definitely make this again.
