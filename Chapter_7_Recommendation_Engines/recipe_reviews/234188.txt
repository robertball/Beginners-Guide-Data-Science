This is really tasty! I used a whole grain, low carb, high fiber tortilla just to get in a bit more fiber. Also, I used a frozen banana just because I personally like the texture better. This would also taste good with some peanut butter in it also. Great quick breakfast/snack!

Quick breakfast that the kids will love.  I used a banana which was too ripe (should have used in a smoothie) which was not the best choice.  Choose a firm banana, roll tightly, and cut with a very sharp knife.  Would be a nice addition to a brunch.

Prefer substituting my homemade peanut butter for the Nutella

I'm not sure if this was just me, but I felt like the Nutella didn't go well with the banana. I've done something similar to this with peanut butter in the past and thought I should try something different. I don't buy Nutella often, but I happened to have it this time. I'll stick to peanut butter next time.

Messy! Maybe I will try to freeze it next time. I'm not crazy about the taste either

Not too bad, but I wouldn't make it a second time. Very easy to make though.

This is SO good!  I used a low-carb wrap and sprinkled a little cinnamon on the Nutella before rolling the wrap around the banana.  Yummy and very filling.
