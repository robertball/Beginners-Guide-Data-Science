This is a great glaze for nearly all meats--especially pork, chicken and salmon.  It is wonderful with Goose, Duck and most other wild game also.  My husband requests it regularly to use up our game from winter/fall hunting seasons.  I just toss all the spices in the mix together vs. coating the meat since I quite often JUST make the sauce/glaze.  It can be as tangy or as spicy as you prefer---for kids, you can add ketchup in place of Chili Paste.  It works great with apricot/pineapple preserve as well. Try making it up just for a tangy dipping sauce for a party with meatballs or other appetizers.

This was great!  I used butterfly cut pork chops which signifcantly reduced the cooking time.

This was very good.  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I substituted the following: Orange Marmalade for the Peach Preserves, and 1 tsp. Walkerswood Jerk Seasoning for the chile paste.  (Note: Walkerswood is a very thick jerk seasoning paste--comes in a jar-- that you generally rub into meat.  Found in Caribbean section of grocery store here in the northeast.)  The result was great, although glaze was a little on the thin side.  I would probably decrease wine to 1/4 cup next time.

This recipe is so quick and easy - and very tasty.  I added a little extra chili paste (I like it hot) and a couple cloves of minced garlic and it was superb.  I will definitely be making this one again.

I've been making this for a few years now .. it is a delicious recipe, as is .. when I make it now, I up the chili paste to 1 tsp (I use a garlic sriracha paste.. $2 for a decent sized jar)... I have used peach preserves, and I have used jam .. I prefer to use jam (peach, apricot).. I just buy the small jar of jam, and it basically equals 1 cup, so I scrape all of the jam out of the jar and just use that ... I'm not much of a white wine drinker, don't usually have any around unless its the holidays, but Vermouth (used for making martini's .. also comes in a green 'Martini' bottle) can be used in replacement of wine, and it keeps longer in the cupboard... whenever a recipe calls for white wine, I just use vermouth, can't even tell the difference, and its like a herbed wine anyways... I also add a few cloves of minced garlic... I usually make this with white rice, and stir-fry vegetables, and spoon the sauce all over everything (makes alot of sauce).. leftovers are even better!

I cooked this for a dinner party of 10.  Instead of cooking each one in a skillet for alloted time I put in a baking dish after searing on each side and baked for 35 minutes.  Came out wonderful and juicy.

I  made a couple of changes just to accomodate what I had on hand. I used pork loin instead of chops, marmalade instead of peach preserves, mild curry paste instead of chili paste and sherry instead of wine. Still turned out incredibly tasty!!

Excellent!!  I've made this 3-4 times now and it always turns out great.  I've used boneless and bone-in chops and both peach and apricot preserves, both with equally good results.  One word of  caution.  After searing your chops, take your pan off the heat for a couple of minutes to let it cool down a bit.  Once when my pan was too hot, I poured the wine in and the oil remaining in the pan, spit and splattered all over the place.  Lesson learned!

These were delicious. I made no changes except to use 1/2 cup Peach Sauce and 1 cup Apricot Preserves. I'd make this recipe again in a hot second. Thank you so much, Virginia!

This is a good change to other more basic pork dishes.  The sauce is great-not too sweet and not too strong.  Next time I need to make some mashed potatoes or something to put the sauce over.

I really like this recipe. I did modify it a little. I didn't have white wine so I used 1 cup apple juice instead. I seared the chops 2 minutes on each side in a oven safe dish. Then I added the glaze and put it in the oven at 300 degrees for 2 hours. I turned the chops after 1 hour. This mades the chops easy enough to cut with a fork. This recipe is a keeper.

very good!  Hubby LOVED it also... I made some minor changes, I added a bit more wine then called for and I added some fresh sliced peaches to the sauce, skin and all...  a Very tasty recipe...  Note, if you are using a non stick pan there is no need to add the oil, lowers the fat content too!  

And just in case if people don't know,REMOVE THE PAN FROM HEAT BEFORE YOU ADD THE WINE!!!  I have seen many people make this mistake..

This recipe would be good with a sparkling wine or a port also

Wow! This is a definite keeper. I halved the recipe and used BBQ sauce and Tiger sauce instead of the chile paste. This will become something I make quite often. I have to get offline now and call my mom and tell her about this recipe!!

This was really tasty.  The only real comment that needs to be made is that it takes longer than that cooking time to reduce the sauce to a glaze.  So once the pork chops are done, remove them from the pan and turn the heat back up until the sauce thickens.  Also, next time I will add some garlic and more chili paste and that will make it a perfect glaze!

Substitutes: Sugar Free Apricot preserves in place of Peach preserves and red pepper flakes in place of chili paste.

This was really tasty, simple, and quick. It has an Asian flavor to it. I served Herb Buttered broccoli and sliced tomatos with it. I should have taken a photo because all the colors gave it a nice presentation.

We both loved it so I will make it again.  I would even consider this a nice enough recipe to serve to company.

These were super tasty. There's a little too much glaze for me; this amount of glaze extends easily to six chops instead of four. I used sugar-free preserves, and I've tried it with equal success using peach and apricot. I also added a little granulated garlic, cumin and chili powder to the seasonings on the meat. This adds just a touch more heat to counter the strong sweetness of the glaze, and it goes really well. I'm not sure how anyone could find this bland even as-is, but if it's too bland for you, try adding more seasoning to the chops.

This was an ok recipe and I would make it again but it seemed kind of blah.  Next time I may marinade the pork in the sauce for a few hours.

This is a good starting point but far from what I will do next time I make this.  As is it is a bit on the bland side.  This just screams for a couple cloves of minced garlic and I will double the chili paste next time.  I will also reduce the sauce a bit before returning the chops to the pan.  My sauce was a bit on the thin side and didn't coat the chops like it should.  With those changes this will definitely be a 5+ star recipe.  Thanks Virginia - we enjoyed your recipe and will enjoy it again with minor modifications to suit our tastes.

This is a rockin' recipe!!  My fiance and I have it probably once every couple of weeks.  I make mock mashed potatoes(cauliflower) and use the sauce for a gravy.  I tell everyone about it.  So easy...I now keep peach preserves in the fridge at all times.

WOW! I wasn't sure if I would like this, but thought I would give it a try. I'm not usually big on fruits with meats, but this recipe is GREAT!!! I only had 2 pork chops so I halved the sauce and it turned out perfectly. It looks very fancy, will be great for company. Thanks for the recipe! I never would have put these ingredients together on my own.

Really fantastic!!!  I followed the recipe to the T except for the chili paste which I, of course, couldn't find.  All I did was use about a half tablespoon of ketchup, some chili powder, paprika, and a bunch of ceyenne pepper.  It was great!!!

I made this with chicken. The only change I made was I used chili powder instead of paste. Neither my boyfriend nor I liked the cinnamon on the meat but the glaze was delicious.

Good, I think more heat is better.  Sweet + Hot is a tasty combo.  I used apricot instead of peach preserves, but next time I will probably use fresh fruit instead of jarred jelly. It creates a nice glaze, but I finished it in the oven instead of finishing it in the pan.  I served it with a 50/50 pearl rice/orzo combo and diced fresh nectarine into the rice to pair it up with the pork.

Very good. I paired it with a fresh peach salsa, which was terriffic. Would not cook for 8 minutes per side (step 3) unless they're incredibly thick. I did 3 min. with somewhat thick chops and it was just right.

Really good sauce. I didn't have peach preserves so I substituted low sugar apricot preserves and it came out great. I also just mixed the spices into the sauce instead of patting them onto the meat, less hassle.

This was an outstanding alternative to everyday pork. I tripled the sauce ammounts because I like more sauce...and I used the whole ammount of the wine. My pan evaporated half of it instantly on contact while deglazing. This was so easy and everyone in my family enjoyed it. I might try the glaze on ribs next time.

This recipe is fantastic!  Once again love the sweet with my meat ;)  I thought we were gonna hate the cinnamon on the chops, but it worked beautifully!  I added a little fresh grated ginger in with the peach preserve sauce.  SO GOOD!!!!

I think these were pretty good, but not worthy of the 4-5 stars many reviewers have given.  The sauce was not thick at all like the picture, but very runny.  I could have thickened the sauce with cornstarch, but was running short on time.  The flavor was mild.  If I ever made this recipe again, I would add much more heat/spice.  I probably won't make this one again.

Interesting. Needs less wine and more oil cause the pork chops burn. and it would be better as a glaze. Plus my girlfriend didnt like it.

This was very good and easy! Instead of peach preserves I used spiced peach jam. I also used garlic chili sauce instead of chil paste. It added a little kick for a family of spicy lovers!

Yum!  I just cooked pork for the first time recently... I'm usually strictly chicken, but really wanted to branch out.  This is my second pork recipe and it was GREAT!  I just cook for two and we're weird about leftovers, so I cut the recipe.  I also don't measure... I don't know why, I just don't.  Guess it's growing up with an Italian mom -- she can just "do it" and I aspire to be the same.  I cut up two fresh peaches instead of using preserves.  I mixed all of the spices into the mix as well as putting salt, pepper, ginger and cinn on the chops before searing.  I served over white rice and it was great!  Oh, and I didn't have chili paste so I used cayenne and a little bit of red pepper flakes.  May skip next time and add a little curry powder.  Also, I might throw in some maple syrup next time... and maybe a spash of oj.  But it's GREAT as is!  TRY IT!

I tried this recipe tonight and thought it was fabulous.  Even my kids ate it, and they are to two pickiest eaters around.  I didn't use the chile paste becuse of the kids, but it still turned out fantastic!

Very impressed!  Tender chops with great flavor.  I served them on rice which gave the rice awesome flavor as well.  I did have to cook them for about 40 minutes since the chops were pretty thick.

I didn't have peach preserves on hand, so I diced two peaches and added about 1/4 c honey to use in place of the preserves. I also sprinkled my sauce with about 1 teaspoon of garlic powder. In addition, I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil (for health purposes). I took the chops out at the end, but I left the sauce in the pan and kicked the heat up. I reduced the sauce for about 5 minutes, until it was a syrupy consistency, & it turned out beautifully! I served with red peppers, carrots & onions in quinoa made from a thai-chicken broth - yummy! 

Ginah1's comment about reducing the time for butterfly chops is definitely necessary! 8 mins per side would leave you with tough chops - I say 4 mins per side after the initial searing should be about right!

This was one of the very few recipes I ever followed pretty much EXACTLY on this site and it came out great. I just added onions to the oil to give flavor when browning.  Also dusted the pork with paprika, chili, garlic, onion powder, salt and pepper.  I Doubled the sauce, prob could have kept just 1/2 cup of wine, however, but this is just a personal preference based on desired consistency.  Great flavor- great and QUICK meal!  Had this recipe in my box a while, but could never find chili paste.  I finally realized why i couldnt, i was assuming it was a Mexican spice and kept looking  in the mexican section of the supermarket.  It is actually an Asian spice.  I had no problem finding it after realizing that.  It was my 1st time cooking with it and i LOVE the flavor it adds.  Great recipe! I had it over egg noodles, prob will try brown rice next time!

Loved them!  I am what you would consider a heat wimp.  I was a bit intimidated by the mere mention of Chile paste, but decided to give this recipe a try.  While I didn't use the whole 1/2 tsp., I found the bite the paste added to be perfect with the sweet preserves.  If you are a spice wimp, like me, you can reduce the chili paste or even kick it up a notch if you prefer your dishes with a kick.  You won't be disappointed.

I probably won't make this again.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Not only was it far too bland, following the recipe made the chops tougher than boiled owl!  These chops should be bowned no more than a minute on each side.  Once the sauce is added, cook no more than 2 minutes on each side.  This is not 1960--pork can be slightly pink!  Trichinosis hasn't been a problem for years.  Cooking as long as the recipe suggests ruins a good piece f meat.

Good recipe. Nicely spiced, but not spicy hot. My mother in law was coming for dinner so I followed the recipe exactly and did not increase the chili paste. But if I made if for just my family I would experiment with that.

I've been making this recipe for years and we love it.  When prepping the pork, I add a fair amount more cinnamon to basically cover the pork, but otherwise I generally make as described.

I used to estimate a cup of preserves, but I found that I was coming up short without measuring.  After I started getting a full cup (and I have used apricot and pineapple preserves as well), the compliments really kicked in.  This is super easy, super good, and will just make you feel like you know what you are doing in the kitchen.

I serve it with a can of chilled peaches and then either salad or rice and we all eat well.  Make this today!

PS - It is not "spicy".  But it is good.

This is my go-to glaze for salmon - sweet, spicy, and delicious! I recommend using garlic chili paste (found in the Asian goods aisle of your grocery store).  I don't think powdered cayenne or crushed red pepper are adequate substitutes for the chili paste, because they lack the same intensity and flavor of the paste.  Apricot preserves, orange marmalade, and even strawberry preserves are also quite tasty in this recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

Easy and so delicious.  I just threw the white wine in with the other sauce ingredients and didn't bother to deglaze the pan, or remove the chops, simply because I didn't check the recipe directions until it was too late.  I just poured the whole thing over the porkchops after turning the chops, then I turned the heat low and simmered a little longer.  My family raved about the sauce.  So delicious!

A family member can not have any alcohol due to a transplant so we used fresh squeezed orange juice for the wine. Also about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Great taste and pork chops were tender and moist.  Definitely being added to our list of favorites.

Made for my family tonight and it was a hit!  Made only one change, we don't drink alcohol so I substituted chic broth and it tasted great.  The ever critical 9 year old wants me to make it again.

I had some peach jelly that I bought at the farmers market and wanted a recipe for pork chops to use it in and came across this...it was SO good. I had to make a few substitutions with what I had in my pantry - A1 for the Worcestershire, Siracha sauce for the chili paste - but it was delicious. My husband said "This is one of the best things You've made in a while". High praise from him. I am making them again tonight and will actually add a little more chili sauce to give it a bit more kick.

Good recipe, but halfed the oil.  This makes plenty of sauce for the 4 chops.  I used preserves with some chunks in it, turned out nice.

Use pork loin instead of chops and BBQ sauce instead of chili paste. Also used cooking sherry instead of whilte wine. If the smell drifting through the house is any indication, we are in for a treat!!!

I followed the recipe to the letter with one exception: I cut the pork loin into 1" medalions (pork chops) because my pork loin was frozen.  After I made everything according to the recipe, I ended up with a saucepot of delicious peaches, and a plateful of grilled, dried out pork.    Next time:  I will bake the chops in a glass dish with the peaches, etc. Combining it all will ensure juicy chops, and will keep it to one location (had to run up and down stairs between outdoor grill and kitchen).

I made this recipe the night before last with a few changes. I used twice the amount of wine called for because I wanted a saucier sauce.  I added cranberry sauce leftover from the night before from chicken.  It added a nice tangy taste as well. Also, as I had fresh peaches on hand, I peeled, sliced and added that as well.       I can see myself using this sauce again for a stir fry either using chicken or beef.

Great flavor!  I used fresh peaches with a little sugar.  I also added a finely chopped hot pepper for extra kick and a little freshly grated ginger and garlic to the sauce.  Wonderful!

Excellent flavor - tastes like it took a lot more time than it did (only took us about 20 mins, not 30). Since it's so easy to make, it makes a perfect choice for the daily rotation - especially when not in the mood for a lot of prep or time is short.

This is a very good recipe for a quick supper.  The only change I made was to use sugar-free apricot preserves instead of the peach preserves.  I wasn't sure it would still work without the sugar, but it turned out nice.  I served it with sauteed zucchini from our garden and a side of rice that I poured the preserve mixture over.  My hubby really enjoyed this even though he doesn't like apricots.  He thought it was peach preserves because he saw the recipe.  Oh well...

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I only gave it four stars because the sauce was way too thin.  That is probably my fault though.  I did decrease the amount of wine and it was still thin.  But it had a super taste and the kids LOVED it.  Even my mom who is super-picky about food loved it.

I love this recipe...it has the perfect combination of spicy and sweet. I subed crushed red peppers for the chili past (didn't have any). One thing you have to make sure of is to keep your heat low while cooking with the peach galze - it's very easy to burn and carmalize.

Very bland! Husband ate most of his without comment, and I didn't even bother to finish mine. I followed most of the recipe, although I let my chops marinate for an hour in the sauce first. The sauce alone smelled and tasted great, it just seemed the chops didn't absorb any of the flavor. This seemed like a goos idea, but I won't make it again.

This was yummy. I didn't have a few of the ingredients so I used cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, and soy sauce as subs. I threw some frozen broccoli in the pan the last few minutes. Served all over couscous. Very good. Would be great with white rice (we were sick of rice) and a spring roll on the side.

Fabulous!  Couldn't find chili paste, so substituted red pepper flakes and some dried chili.  Will make this again!  there was a small amount of "leftovers"....and I couldn't wait to have them for lunch the next day! LOL!  My husband really liked this dish, too.

DH made these last night and though I loved them as is, he thought they were a little too sweet so would have upped the Worcestershire sauce to 2 tbsp and would have skipped the cinnamon.  Used water in place of wine and served over rice.

It is very good. Made a slight change, I used canned peaches puréed them with brown sugar instead of the peach preserve. This way I controlled the sweetness. I am on a diet, so it worked pretty well.

This also works very well with boneless chicken breasts.  When using chicken I substitute 1 tsp of soy sauce for every 1 1/2 Tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce called for in the recipe.

It's so hard to find a good recipe for pork chops, but this one is great!  I used fresh, unsweetened peaches and added 2T of brown sugar and added 1/2T minced garlic to add flavor. Be careful not to overcook, or it will be dry.

I liked this recipe, my husband loved it.  The ginger gave it an asian taste.  I didn't cook the pork chops as long as the recipe called for, and they were still borderline overcooked.  I would definitely watch carefully and adjust the cooking time appropriately.

Very good recipe.  A nice change from the basic pork recipes.  I added a touch more chile paste and let the sauce reduce with the pork chops!  I will try this recipe with chicken too.

This was a huge hit at our house!  I will make it again for sure.  I used apricot preserves and garlic chili sauce because it was I had on hand.  I served it over rice, which was great because the rice soaked up the wonderful sauce.  Next time I will add more chili sauce to kick it up a notch.  I think it would be great with chicken too.  A definte keeper!

It was probably more user error than anything, but I thought my chops ended up overdone and dry.  The flavor from the sauce didn't seem to creep into the chops and I felt the dish didn't have a lot of taste.  However, that being said...It was not bad by any means, I was just looking for a more powerful peach or spice flavor.

Excellent!! Fixed this last night with a few tweaks from other reviews.  I substituted ketchup for the chili paste since I have kids that probably would not like the spice.  I also seasoned the pork chops with just the salt and pepper before searing.  I combined the other spices with the peach mixture.  Will definitely fix again.

My new all time favorite recipe for Pork Chops. Only wish the sauce got a little thicker - will have to try to reduce the wine next time so it's more of a glaze than a thin sauce.

Glaze is amazing!  It turns out best in terms of consistency and taste if using a 'real' preserve that is homemade (either by you or purchased from a farmers' market rather than store bought).  Though I have made it both ways and it's great every time.  I always bake my pork to finish it off so I can't comment as to that portion of the recipe...but I think regardless of how you cook it, it's the glaze that really makes this a wonderful recipe!

We love these pork chops. We use chicken broth in place of the wine. I also finish my chops in the oven, instead of in the pan that I fried them in. Easy, delicious recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic!  The sauce truly would be awesome on any meat or as a dip.  Will definitely make again.

I was sevearly dissapointed in this recipie I ended up with a sticky burned pan and tough burned pork chops. I would sugest slow cooking the pork chops in the oven and glazing them or you could pan cook them but put the glaze on when the pork chops are done and DO NOT RETURN THE PORK CHOPS TO THE PAN WITH THE GLAZE this was my crucial mistake.

We LOVED this recipe! I had 2 pkgs of thin sliced pork chops to use up, so obviously, my cooking time was 1/2 or less. I made 1 1/2 times the sauce & served the chops(12 total) & sauce over white rice. AMAZING! We thought the heat was just right too!

Delicious!  I substituted apricot preserves for the peach, and omitted the chili paste as I served it to my children also (used a small sprinkle of chili powder instead).  Thumbs up all around!

I followed the directions exactly and these were a little dry, and the sauce was runny, not glazey.  The flavor was pretty good, though.  Not sure how to amend this to make it work for me...

a unique new dish!  i couldn't find chile paste, so i substituted diced fresh jalepeno (be careful- it only takes a small amount to kick up the spice!), and i loved it.  probably best served with rice and steamed vegetables, something that won't clash with the unique flavor

This was a pretty tasty dish.  The sauce was really good. I couldn't find any "chile paste" at my grocer, so I just got some hatch green chiles and blended them into a pulp. I wanted to thicken up the sauce in the pan after the pork was fully cooked, so I put in some corn starch to try and thicken it up. That was a mistake.  Just leave the sauce as is and you will be fine.  I wasn't sure what to use as a side so I served it with a Broc/Carrot/Corn mix.  It was also pretty simple to make, and it's fairly healthy. I would probably make this again. Not quite a 5* dish... I would give 4.5 if I could, but I can't so it gets 4*'s.

This is delicious!  I sliced a pork tenderloin and used Indian Red Chili Powder as that was what I had on hand.  Friends stopped by just as we were sitting down and stayed for dinner.  Everyone, including children, loved it.  I served it with white rice and Country Style Green Beans. (Next time I will drain the oil before adding peach sauce to aid in thickening.)

Very, very nice dish. Rubbing cinnamon and ginger into the chops was an aromatic job - loved it. Only change, had curry paste instead of chile paste. The chops were thick (1 in, but 8 min per side may have been a shade too long.

This recipe gave bland pork chops a wonderful spicy and sweet glaze that was delicious.  I halved the recipe and used orange juice instead of the wine (I had none in the fridge) and used apricot preserves instead of the peach (again, I didn't have peach) and it was still fabulous!  I cooked the pork chops until the internal temperature was 165 degrees, so my cooking time was a little less than the recipe recommended, but they turned out juicy and succulent.  My husband dreads pork chops, but we all agreed that this made them especially enjoyable.

I loved this recipe.  I didn't have peach preserves so I made my own using canned peaches.  I also didn't have chile paste so I made my own version.  I made oriental ginger noodles to go with it and it was a delicious meal.

This is SO good!  My husband and I loved it, we can't wait to make it again!  I actually did this with pork tenderloin, which I first seared, and then broiled, basting occasionally.  I also couldn't find chili paste, so I substituted equal parts chili powder and red pepper.

MMM MMM Good!  My husband could not stop raving about this recipe.  I used chili garlic paste from the Chinese food aisle of my grocery store.  The boneless pork chops were from Costco so they were VERY thick.  I had to cook them 10+ minutes per side to ensure they were cooked properly.  This dish reminded us of a sweet and spicy Thai entree.  YUM!

This was way too sweet for us.  I used pineapple-apricot jam but I don't think it would have mattered using peach.  It was just too sweet. Maybe if I used more Worchestershire sauce we would have liked it better.

This recipe was great and easy.  I used apricot preserves since I had them on hand and quartered mushrooms and added while browning the chops.  The sauce was excellent and I'll serve it over browned chicken breasts too.  I served this with mashed potatoes and steamed spinach.

This was alright but not really something I'd endeavor to cook again. The flavors were nice but I felt they should have been stronger. They were too mild, even increasing the amount of chili paste. Again, nice flavor just not the "Wow" I was looking for.

I thought this tasted good and had an interesting flavor. It was a fight to get my kids to eat it, why can't they expand their taste horizons? Overall, I thought the dish was worth making and it was easy to prepare.

I made this with a Drunken Peach Preserve I had. It was bourbon and peaches. It came out delicious with the spices listed. I will make this again!

Delicious! Used red pepper flakes in place of the chile paste and mango peach preserves instead of peach because it was unavailable.

This recipe is addictive! I used thick porkchops, so my cook time was more than the recipe said. I would recommend a meat thermometer to check the meat is cooked thoroughly.

LOVED this!  The sauce was a tad thin (even after letting it sit for some time after the chops were done), so I'd consider either backing off a bit on the wine (or water) or maybe adding a sprinkle of cornstarch towards the end.

The glaze is very, very good. The only reason why I gave it a 4 is bc the glaze just didn't seem to penetrate the pork chops..

Wonderful sauce - I mixed the preserves and wine, etc.. together before adding to the pan.  I removed the pan from the heat before adding the liquid and had the lid ready to pop back on to prevent the spattering from getting everywhere.  Would be a reliable dish to make for company!!!  Oh - also - didn't use chili paste - just added 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes - came out perfectly!

This turned out nicely.  The only change that I made was adding sugar free diced peaches,  for more texture to the sauce . I would have liked the sauce to be thicker and the pork to be more tender. The flavors were great.  Even my picky eater enjoyed this.

Not too bad, a little bland. My "hot stuff is poison" wife thought it needed more chili paste. Next time I'll also add a lot more ginger and a bit more cinnamon. I'm also going to reduce or thicken the sauce before returning the chops to the pan. Maybe try the sauce on roasted or grilled veggies. A promising recipe that is worth putting in a little effort to make it memorable.

This was really good and had a lot of flavor. When you buy wine make sure it is dry to counter act the sweetness from the preserves.

Sauce was terrific.  Sweet, but it still had a little bite.  Would be great on other meats.  Chops were a little dry.  I didn't cook them as long as the recipe stated only 20mins. and they were still dry.  It might be me, my pork chops seem to always be dry no matter what I seem to do.

Absolutely fabulous. I made this with peach, mango preserves. I will try it in the future with apricot preserves as suggested by many. I think a touch of garlic and additional chili paste would perfect it. I found that the leftovers were even more tasty. The ingredients had a chance to really penetrate the chops. I recommend less cook time as the pork will easily toughen up.

Use a good quality peach preserve.  I used Smuckers and there wasn't much "peachy-ness" in the flavor.  However,  it was still very good.  I would make this again, but next time I'm trying Apricot preserve.

Great recipe. Easy to prepare with big flavor payoff. Used chili powder in lieu of chili paste. Butterflied thick center cut pork chops and reduced cooking time by at least half.  Definitely will repeat this recipe!

This was OK. We'll probably make it again to see if it improves the second time. We tried to follow the directions exactly but did not have chile paste. An internet search found a substitute - Sriracha sauce thickened with Paprika - which is what we used. It added a noticeable amount of heat - not really "Hot" but pleasantly spicy that added something extra to the sweetness of the Peach Preserves. We failed to season the meat before beginning to brown it (too many cooks), but added the spices while the chops were cooking. This may have made a difference in the outcome. When we try it again, we will follow the recipe more closely and update this review.

This dish reminded me of a Masala Spice chops recipe I do, but the peach preserves REALLY added something!! I paired it with some saffron rice, and a big salad... My family LOVED it!! I WILL be making this again!!

My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe. I used pork tenderloin (because I had it) cut into 1 inch medallions and apricot preserves, because I didn't have peach preserves. It was such an easy recipe and fast. The tenderloin was really moist. Next time I'll use peach preserves and I think I'll grill some peach slices, seasoned like the pork, to put on top.

This turned out perfect even for a novice like me.  I didn't change a thing.  The timings and temps for the pork chops were perfect as mine stayed tender.  I may have left too much oil in the pan as the sauce was good although I might have wanted it just a bit thicker.

This recipe was quick and easy to make! I added just a splash of hot sauce and some red pepper flakes to the sauce (I like a little heat!), and it was delicious. I'm certain that I'll be asked to make this recipe again, as it was a huge hit

I make this all the time with pork chops.  I use a cast iron pan of course and put on a good sear on all sides of nice thick pork chops.  I don't use chili paste (not a staple for me) - I use Sriracha Chili Sauce - just a squirt.  I love to see hot and sweet married in a recipe.   This is easy and delicious.

My family loved this. So easy. Did use a peach raspberry jam since I didn't have just peach and it turned out amazing. Had it with potato latkes, the sauce was good on them and the cooked carrots.

I used pork tenderloin, sliced and seared it then put it into a 8" square baking dish.  I mixed all the ingredients together using a dried hot chili pepper and a little catsup as I didn't have chili paste, added a minced garlic clove and poured the sauce over the pork and baked 45 min. turning half way through.  Served with steamed broccoli and brown rice.  Hubby loved it.

While the flavor of this was good, we thought it was too sweet and not at all spicy. It also made way too much sauce for the amount of meat (even if you poured it on everything on your plate) and was very watery.

Adding some fresh minced garlic helps. Also be generous with the cinnamon and ginger you sprinkle on the chops. I do add the sweet chile paste but also add an additional teaspoon of hot chile paste. The combination of sweet and spicy plays off nicely against each other.

I used a Cholula Chili and Garlic hot sauce because I couldn't find chili paste (I like spicy and garlic so I put a little extra in).  I used PC brand Ontario Peach Fruit Spread. 
The pork was  moist and flavourful.  
I might caramelize some onions with it, the next time. 
Served with Basmati rice.  
Very simple recipe.  
I will make it again.

I cooked them a bit too long, but they were still excellent! I reduced Worcestershire to 1 tbs and eliminated the salt to make it a bit heart healthier. Serve with mashed potatoes and a salad. Yum!

Family Loved it! Used the same batch to make 8 pork chops in total. However word of caution, do use the same batch of preserve mix for too long otherwise the peaches within the mix will stop caramelizing and begin to burn (you'll notice the mixture go from a nice reddish orange to a deep cherry. I luckily finished by this point). All things aside from that, this recipe tasted amazing and will definitely remain in my arsenal to continue wooing my wife!

Amazingly delicious and super easy! I'm not a fan of pork normally but my DH is, so I'm always looking for pork dishes that give amazing flavour and this one does. I used the full recipe for two 3/4 inch chops and changed the chili paste to 1tsp. I also sautéed slices of fresh peach with the meat the last two minutes for garnish. It was gobbled up quick, a new favorite.

Absolutely delicious. Simple & easy. I used bone-in pork chops & seared in coconut oil until a deep brown. I will be making this many more times. Thanks Virginia!

These were delicious.  I added more chili paste and let the sauce reduce a bit.  I cut down the cook time of the chops when added back to the sauce to 2 minutes each side and they were perfect and juicy (our chops were boneless and not super thick.  They were amazing with lemon garlic rainbow chard.

I used 4 fresh, over ripe peaches instead of preserves. Also added some fresh ginger to the sauce, about a tablespoon.

I didn't have peach preserves so I used a can of peach slices. Took out five of them and put the rest in blender with the juice. Also mixed the seasonings with it. Seasoned the chops with salt and pepper but added Applewood rub. It made them pop!  Followed the recipe other than that. Warmed the five peach slices that were left out and garnished with them. Awesome.

This was surprisingly good. It didn't come across as spicy at all, but a slightly sweet hint of cinnamon and peach on the chops. I wasn't sure I'd like that combination of flavors, but the whole family loved it! And considering how quick the preparation went, it's a keeper.

Excellent! My family really enjoyed this dish, I thought it was a tad too spicy, but very flavorful.  I used my own peach preserves instead of store bought, which gave the dish a real fresh taste.  I will definitely be making this dish again.

This is an easy an tasty addition to the weeknight menu plan--it came together very quickly. I substituted grated fresh ginger for the ground as well as added some garlic, then sautéed them a bit before adding the sauce to the pan. I also used chili-garlic paste instead of the listed chili paste. Next time, I will thicken the sauce with some cornstarch. This one's a keeper.

Took all reviews into consideration. Since we try to omit as much sugar as possible, I used frozen mangos, added about a tsp of honey, 3 cloves of garlic, and doubled the chili paste. I blended all ingredients. I used coconut oil to sear chops (used bone-in chops). Reduced the wine to a rue, then added sauce to heat and blend well. Poured sauce over chops that I placed in a baking dish and baked at 325 for about an hour. It was a hit! The best part of this dish is that you are not limited to one type of fruit or berry. Enjoy!

Loved it! I made a couple of modifications - couldn't buy chili paste in my town, so I used red pepper chili flakes, and cut the amount in half. Gave it just the right amount of spice and blended nicely with the peach sauce. I used 1" thick pork chops and it was delicious!

I made this tonight after looking for something new and different for my family. I think it's good to try once as it is and then adjust it to your taste. I think next time I will reduce the amount of ginger. I also added cut up pieces of fresh peaches and that made all the difference to me. It makes a great amount of sauce that can be poured on top of mashed potatoes or just for extra dipping for the pork chops. My kids (age 3.5 yrs and 1.5 years) wouldn't eat it but it was their first time with pork chops.

I modified this a little for my family's taste & preference. For the sauce, I used frozen peaches as that was one of the reasons I had searched for pork chops & peaches. I added some apricot preserves to the chopped thawed peaches to make up the amt called for in the recipe.

Then I substituted smoked paprika, cumin & allspice for the spices so it wouldn't be hits as sweet or spicy. I grilled some sliced peaches & pineapple seperately on my cuisinart grill & before Browning the (thin cut) chops I spread just a scant tsp of sauce on one side to help brown them before they got too dry, then served the sauce & grilled fruit on the side. It really turned out great.

This was SO yummy! And it did make a lot more sauce than I needed. So the next evening, I cooked some whiting in the sauce and then poured it all on rice. My husband and super picky brother ate it all! It was great.

This was sooooo easy!! And the flavors were really great. I didn't have peach preserves, so I diced a fresh peach and simmered it on the stove with about a 1/4 cup sugar and a splash of water, mashing it to create the sauce. I think next time I'll just use 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, as 1.5 Tbsp was a little over powering.  Everyone loved it!

Awesome awesome awesome! I've made this three times now, twice for chops and once for chicken breasts. I had to lie to my dad before hand because he HATES ginger, but he took one bite and made a "this is delicious" face. The remaining sauce is great for potatoes, too. I used it on center cut and butterfly chops, both were great, just adjust the cooking time. Just thinking about this recipe makes me want to rethink dinner tonight. mmmm.

The sauce is to die for! Will keep the sauce recipe for many other cuts of pork. Make sure you really sear the chops in the pan to make very crunchy. I used chili powder insted of paste, olive oil and marsala wine. I also had homemade peach preserves that I used in the recipe. Save the sauce to serve on the side as a gravy. The smell will have your family running to the table!

Very, very tasty.  Although I didn't get a lot of spice - but that was OK - I enjoyed the other flavors.  Used apricot preserves instead of peach - and I just skipped the second step of removing the chops from the skillet and added the wine to the preserves mixture - poured it right on the browned meat and then simmered.  I did have to add some more water as the sauce became a little too thick before the pork was cooked.  Buttered green beans were an excellent side.

This was a pleasant surprise.  My husband doesn't like sweet meat, but was game to try the recipe.  I agree with many of the other reviewers that there was little spice.  Overall, the chops are well seasoned.  The ginger and preserves make a good combination.  Not overwhelmingly sweet.

This was fantastic! The sauce was thick, sweet and delicious.  I added red pepper flakes, however wish I had used more, as well as more chili paste because the final product wasn't as spicy as I would have liked.  Great simple recipe and a crowd pleaser!  Would be great with chicken.

The glaze for this meal was pretty tasty, but I think the chops we bought were much thinner than most pork chops, so we may have cooked them for too long. The pork itself came out rather tough and chewy. Might try a different cut next time.

Pretty good. I added some sliced canned peaches for texture and a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes for a bit more heat.

One of my favorite glazes ever!  It is a really sweet and sour sensation.  I use a very similar grave on chicken.  Everyone REALLY enjoyed it!

This was very good, cut down on spice bc of the kiddos. Used apricot instead of peach because I had it. The only thing was mine overcooked and I did not go the full 8 min on each side- too long?? I think next time I would simmer the sauce down a few minutes before adding the chops and then just 2-4 min per side in the sauce on low would be good. Good recipe with pantry items!

We loved this recipe!  I didn't have white wine, so I used vinegar, which worked just fine.  Also, I let the sauce reduce for about 10 minutes before adding the pork chops, which allowed the sauce to thicken up and more of the flavor to stick on the pork chop.  These pork chops are AMAZING!!

So quick and easy, packed such fun flavors and textures!! A keeper for sure! Did make a couple of changes, didn't have preserves so subbed a couple of cups of Dole snack-size diced peaches(juice too) and no chili paste, but about a half a tablespoon of Sriracha chili sauce brought the heat and its unique flavor to this dish.

Followed it exactly as written...well, ok I added a bit more spicy sauce and in case you don't know which to buy, I used  CHILI GARLIC SAUCE Tuong Ot Toi Vietnam (it has a rooster in the center of the bottle). Its super spicy so be cautious when adding.

The glaze for this was amazing.  Tasted like what is found in a lot of Americanized Chinese-style restaurants on their meat...from chicken to beef to pork.  Spicy/sweet combo was very good.  The cinnamon and ginger on the meat was good on the pork chops but I think I'd leave it off any other cut of meat.  Overall, a great recipe that I'll be using to make all kinds of great dishes.  Thanks for this one!

Wow. I wasn't sure how this would turn out. I needed to throw together a nice dinner and I didn't have time to go to the store. I used apricot instead of peach preserves and I used peach juice instead of wine. It was wonderful. I can't wait to try it with the peach preserves.

Overall it was good, I didn't have chili paste, nor would it have had any use other then for this recipe so I used an equal amount of cayenne pepper powder, and it gave it a pleasant kick. The pork ended up dry however, and I only cooked each side for 6 minutes as someone posted in a comment. Not sure on the thickness of the chops originally used, but obviously I had slim cuts.

After reading all of the wonderful reviews, I hate to be a spoiler.  However, the combination of these spices along with the sauce did not appeal to me.  I must say that the chops came out very moist and tender, but I just didn't find the taste all that appealing.

I just found my new favorite pork chop recipe!  This is a must try if your trying to switch up a regular chop.  I used ketchup, chilli powder, and some crushed red pepper instead of chilli paste.  Thank you!

Great recipe! Fast, easy, with few ingredients, but still tastes like something special! I did not have peach preserves but I did have frozen peaches (about a cup and half) that I reduced with some honey (you could also use sugar) and a little bit of water. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Loved the combination of sweet and spicy!

Great recipe, but I strongly recommend reducing the sauce in the pan for about 10 minutes before using. Otherwise it is too thin. Reducing actually caramelizes the sugar in the preserves and adds a whole new flavor.

I followed the instructions the first time I made this recipe.The result:meat was very tender, but i wasn't too crazy about the sauce, it had too much alcohol in it, next time I will try to cut it in half.

This was delicious! I added chopped jalapenos to the peach  sauce and got more flavor and juicier chops by using the juice from the browned chops. My husband loved it and said it was the perfect amount of sweet with spicy.

Made this tonight and we enjoyed it very much!  I paired it with my home made apple sauce recipe, but added a fresh peach and some of the preserve w/ ginger to it...went well together.  I used fresh ginger rather than the seasoning.

Cooking time was too much, took chops out after 6 minutes on each side and they were just a little over done.  I served them with fresh peaches on the side which was excellent.  A great recipe.

This was good, but a little bland, even after adding more spice. Also, my pork chops came out a little dry; would probably have come out better if baked instead.

The "spicy" here I feel is misleading. The peach preserve dominating the overall flavor by far.

This makes a very nice glaze. It's good and I'll make it again. I wish I could give this a 3.5 star because I just don't think it's anything "special". I used 1 tsp of chipotle en adobo sauce because I didn't have any chile paste. The combination of sweet and spicy is really nice.

Made this some time ago for my bf and I (and just getting around to reviewing it!). A friend recommended this to me. While we found this to be "OK", I/we wouldn't make it again. I purchased thin pork chops (b/c I knew that they'd cook quickly w/o drying out as thicker cuts sometimes do). I could not find chili paste, so I subbed chili sauce instead (I searched two large grocery stores in my area to no avail). A bit disappointing, b/c I have no use for the remaining chili sauce and don't plan to make this again. Served with canned peaches and herbed rice (i.e. Rice a Roni). Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I used mango jam in place of the peach preserves and it had a wonderful flavor. I used 1/4 cup of wine instead of 1/2 cup as another reviewer suggested and I still thought it was a little thin. I may cut it back to 2 tablespoons the next time. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

This never fails in my household. I love this recipe, and make it all the time. I typically end up adding more preserves and chili paste, but this is a perfect main dish!

These were really good after I made a few small adjustments. I used an Asian chile paste (I didn't know what chile paste it called for, exactly- I think it's called Huy Fong) and I doubled the amount. I also added some minced garlic, some chili powder, and a couple of drops of Tabasco. This gave it the right amount of spiciness to balance the sweetness. We grilled thick (about 1/2") pork chops on a slow fire and basted regularly with the extra sauce, then poured some on top right before serving. DELICIOUS!

This was good...I will probably fix this is again for my family, or take it to a friends house for a "comfort food"  However, I felt it was a bit misleading under the "healthy food" section, because just one pork chop has over 400 calories...considering these are boneless...I thought it would have been less...just fyi on that if you are watching your calories.  The flavor of the glaze was sweet and not to overwhelming.  Quite good!

This is one of our favourite meals. Have never been able to find peach preserves, so have been using a "no sugar added" apricot jam to great success. The sauce is so wonderful on rice that I always make extra (sauce and rice!), and this also freezes beautifully for a healthy, easy "TV dinner" for work lunches or busy nights.

It was ok.  It was a different flavor than what I was expecting & my boyfriend thought it tasted like fancy soap.  I think if I made this again I would skip the cinnamon all together.  Just didn't do it for me.

Very good recipe, and very easy.  I used one cup diced apricot (apparantly it was a bad day for peaches in the market), and 1 1/2 tablespoon of apricot preserves.  I wanted something fresher, and less gooey.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  I shifted and turned the chops in the pan more, in order to really coat them and they absorbed the flavor wonderfully - by the way, that small amount of preserves was plenty for a nice glaze.  Cooking time really will vary with the size of pork chops your butcher has.  Very good method, will def. try with other fresh fruits in the future.  Served with fresh spicy green beans and asian sauteed mushrooms.

I made these chops for dinner last night and we thought they were just ok.  We found that we couldn't really taste the peach much (maybe some fresh peaches in the sauce would be good) and I used about 1/2 Tbsp of Asian chili sauce instead of paste.  In the end, there was a good amount of spice, but we couldn't taste anything else but spicy/sweet.

I'm giving this three stars because it was ok. Not great, just ok. Hoping that if I make it again, (with thicker chops) that it will come out better.

Delicious!!! My husband and I love this recipe. I have made it twice in three weeks, and is easy to make. I substituted the white wine for peach wine and I add more chili paste. I serve with a green bean caserole, they compliment each other. Would recommend for everyone.

I'm not a huge pork chop fan, however I loved this recipes. Really easy and really good. I didn't have peach preserves, so I used apricot instead. Seems to work out just fine.

This is a great recipe!  I make it over and over again.  It is such a great alternative to pork chops smothered in gravy or breaded.  Spicy and sweet and the pork chops always stay moist.  I serve it with rice and it has become a household favorite!

I loved this, and my FI enjoyed it but didn't rave about it like he sometimes does with my meals.  We've been trying to cut rice, pasta and potatos out of our diet, so we didn't have rice with this meal...but if we did, i know it would have been awesome.  The sause was delicious.  But if you do that, you will certainly consume the added calories within the preserve.
I'll probably make this again.

I adulterated this recipe just enough that I can't rate it specifically, but I would definitely consider it a 5-star inspiration. I used mashed canned peaches, white wine, chili powder, Tabasco, ginger, cinnamon, and pepper; the spicy & sweet combination was perfect, very tasty over rice as well. Most importantly, I had dinner on the table in 20 minutes, so thanks!

A good change of pace when I get tired of my regular pork chop recipes.  I served it with a baked sweet potato; however, I think rice would go better with the sauce.

I didn't have peach preserves, but I had a peach - so, I peeled and diced it and added a half-teaspoon of honey.  I also used fresh ginger instead of dried ground (about a tablespoon, minced) and a whole teaspoon of chile paste.  It also didn't take as long to cook all the way through - maybe if the chops were really thick you'd need 8 minutes per side, but not for regular ones!  I served it with cajun-spiced rice pilaf, and the remainder of the bottle of wine.

I would call these Sweet Peach-Glazed Pork Chops, as they are sweet, not spicy.  They were okay -- we ate them all -- but nothing to rave about.  Probably won't make them again.

This is an easy dish to prepare and I only had to make one change.  I feel this should be called "Tangy" Peach-Glazed and not "Spicy".  For it to be spicy - as other suggested - you have to increase the amount of chili paste.  I  used garlic chili when I prepared it.

This ones a keeper!  Light, but full of wonderful flavors.  I served it with the Rosemary mashed potatoes and yams recipe I found on this site.
