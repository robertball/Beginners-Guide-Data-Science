This sorbet is delicious!  I absolutely loved it!

I have to admit, I was a little unsure of the ingredient list at first.  The champagne caught my eye because who doesn't love champagne?!?

The sorbet was easy to make and I will definitely be making it again.  Everyone raved about it!

Thank you for the recipe!  :)
