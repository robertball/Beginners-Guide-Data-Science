I really enjoyed this recipe. Very light and fresh. I doubled the garlic and added some red pepper flakes. Remember to add some salt and pepper! :)

Fresh and light but teeters on the edge of blandness. Marinate the shrimp first and season the dish well.

The SigO and I agreed this was a little bland.  It was a good start but - for our tastes - was missing something.  But it was quick and easy to make - we need recipes like that in our busy lives.  The next day I reheated the leftovers in a skillet - adding this time some butter, a much bigger dose of chili oil, some cayenne and a few more shakes (didn't have fresh) basil.  I loved it the second go-around.  This is a keeper, thanks, but next time I think I will really kick up the heat.

I thought it was on the bland side, but my the family enjoyed it (shellfish deprived- I guess).  I did a Greek twist by substituting fresh dill for basil, adding 2 cloves of minced garlic and upped the veggie quotient by adding slivered vidalia onions and red pepper matchsticks.  I topped it off with a few Tbs of low fat feta (perfect for South Beach Dieters) and served it over orzo for the non-SBDs.

as is, bland, bland, bland.  We ended up rescuing it by putting pesto sauce in with it.

this recipe is good, but a little too bland for my taste.  I know it's suppost to be a less creamy sauce, so I wanted to try something different because I usually like a more creamy or marinara sauce.  I suggest that for those of you who love creamy sauce or marinara sauce, to not try this recipe.

I will make this again.  I made the dish using these substitutions.  Bow tie pasta for the linguini. Added crushed red pepper to the olive oil for the chili oil.  Precooked shrimp. Chicken broth for the dry white wine, but only used 1/2 cup - not reduced.  As in a previous review - this is 4-5 serving dish.

Made too much for the 4 of us, reduce by 1/2.  Also could use more olive oil and/or chili oil.

After wasting some costly ingredients. Absolutely did not like this, the pasta was bland and the overwhelming flavor was shrimp and chili oil not enough seasoning to make it palatable as written. Who writes a recipe without salt. Yes there is salt in the water but to season the pasta and sauce with just the pasta water the amount of salt should be included it the recipe... I am not going to waste more ingredients to find out what the measurement should be, there are too many other recipes here that are much better. Lesson learned, 'Never pick a recipe based on a good picture'

This was okay, pretty bland.  I would definitely add spices if I made again.

4 stars with a slight adjustment. Negate the pasta water, use more wine in its place. Also I would recommend adding the shrimp right after the wine as the shrimp is a delicate meat. Also added twice the garlic, twice the butter, very roughly chopped basil for a more distinct flavor and  use thin noodles (thin spaghetti, vermicelli). Works with all types of seafood (langostino, scallops, clams) This one is a keeper.

It is a good dish, but you must add more seasoning than suggested otherwise it is quite bland. The addition of the red pepper flakes, salt and pepper did add lots of flavor. Surprisingly, the chili oil is not spicy so do add much more of this.

This was easy to do, and had a nice fresh taste, but way too bland. I used red pepper flakes instead of the oil. It was better after I topped it with some feta. I also used mini bow tie pasta, because that is what I had.

Made this dish for company last night and it was a GREAT success!!! It was quick to make, so I had time to mingle, and everyone raved. One of my guests is a chef and asked for my recipe. To other reviewer, don't thicken the sauce, it should be light and delicate.

I was pleasantly surprised by this GREAT dish! I have a garden and had overload of snap peas and was tired of the same recipes. I saw this & thought I'd try it. It was SO good. I took the advice of others and added more garlic & salt. (I also added toasted sesame oil in place of hot oil and also added about 3T of nutritional yeast (a vegetarian substitute for a cheesy flavor). It was SO good. (I also cooked the liquid down with all the ingredients in it so that the flavor would caramelize.) This recipe is a definite keeper.

I really enjoyed this recipe but made a couple of additions. I added a bit more garlic and red pepper flakes. My boyfriend loved it and I will be cooking this recipe again soon.

Fantastic! I made a slightly smaller batch, but included the entire amount of wine; added twice the amount of garlic, and crushed red pepper (having read other reviewer's suggestions about blandness). I also used dried basil instead of fresh. This was really tasty and I'm having a hard time not indulging in more!

I modified this for Phase 1 of South Beach (eliminated the pasta) and loved it.  The chili oil really adds a new deminsion to the flavor that I will use in future cooking.  Thank you!

Okay, I know I've said it a million times, but I'll say it again.  Take some good pasta, olive oil and garlic, and throw in whatever meat or vegetables you have on hand and you'll have yourself a delicious and satisfying meal you can sit down and eat in just about 15 minutes.  I followed the recipe loosely, skipping the chili oil as I'm not fond of things hot. Also, because I had them to use, I substituted  frozen green peas for sugar snap peas and added some halved grape tomatoes, which also added an attractive punch of color.  Light fresh flavors and ingredients, this was an ideal dish to dream of spring.

I loved this!  Made some slight adjustments in quantities - half a box of linguini, 1 pound shrimp, and probably closer to 1/2 cup basil.  I used some Thai Chili oil that I had made with grapeseed oil and dried Thai chilis, and upped it to 1 tbsp (because I knew it wasn't super hot), and for the basil I used a combination of Thai and regular basil.  I added a pinch of salt and some fresh cracked pepper to taste.  Between the succulent shrimp, sweet, tender/crisp snap peas, garlic, wine, lemon, fresh basil and that hint of chili oil that sneaks up on you, I thought this dish had the perfect blend of flavors!

I read that this was bland and I did not have any chili oil, so I added chili flakes to the olive oil and I added some fresh ginger. It was NOT bland, it was almost too hot to eat. I would have complained if my husband made it this hot. Next time I wll cut back on the amount of chil flakes I add. I also added carrots, onion and bell pepper. Also I would coat the noodles in oil and wine before serving.

This was a healthy delicious quick dish that changed up the traditional pasta spaghetti meal. I did add/change a little because it needed a little spice. I cooked the pasta in chicken bullion cubes. I didn't have basil so I used oregano.  I used apple cider vinegar in place of wine. i couldn't find sugar snaps separately and used a frozen mix of snaps, carrots, onions and mushrooms. I added ground sausage and extra garlic and olive oil. I had a can of crushed tomatoes in a separate pot to dipped unto the finished product. I had garlic toast on the side. Yummy!

Pretty good dish.  I swapped out the wine with chicken stock only bc bf complains bitterly when I cook with wine and I didn't feel like listening to it.  I also used sweet chili sauce instead of chili oil and added more garlic.  My fresh basil is not looking so good so I used dried and tossed it in while everything was simmering, then added in parsley for the green.  This was nice and easy and we enjoyed it; I accidently over peppered it so it was a bit too peppery, but my fault.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have tried this recipe on three different occasions trying different variations.  The first time I made it I didn't have white wine and substituted it with white vinegar wine, not a good choice.  The second time I used chicken broth and used basil pesto to give it more flavor.  Also could not find chile oil.  Just made again with all listed ingredients, still does not have enough flavor.  Will use basil pesto and increase garlic in the future.  Not ready to throw in the towel on this one.

I probably tripled the basil, added salt and pepper, and used Trader Joe's garlic and basil linguini. I also didn't have chili oil, so I added cayenne pepper while the shrimp were cooking. I didn't think it was bland at all!

A great base recipe.  I assimilated some suggestions of other reviewers and made some changes of my own: 1. I used about 2/3 of the pasta, at most.  2. I used siracha (to my taste) rather than chili oil.  3. I used pre-cooked shrimp (mixed in during the last step) and gave the snap peas a good saute.  4. I doubled the garlic to four cloves.  5. I skipped the butter, but used olive oil as needed.  6. Instead of the basil, I tossed the pasta with about three spoonfuls of pesto sauce (and a bit of black pepper).  7. Rather than lemon, I squeezed in the juice of almost half a lime.

The result was fantastic!  No shortage of flavor, but still a simple, harmonious combination that really made each ingredient shine.  My husband said it was among the best pasta dishes I've ever made, and it's definitely going on the permanent rotation :)

Note: I also mixed a teaspoon of cornstarch into the sauce, which worked out great but might not be necessary.  The wine I used was some slightly vinegary leftover Sauvignon blanc.

I didn't have chili oil, so I infused the olive oil with Red Pepper Flakes (just put maybe a half a teaspoon of the flakes in the oil while waiting for the oil/pan to heat up). Also, I had to use extra white wine (extra 1/2 cup), extra garlic (probably 2 MORE cloves!), little extra butter, and some generic spices (Wegmans Herbes De Provence) because there was too much pasta, shrimp and pods without enough flavor/spice. Also, I only used 2/3 pound of the pea pods, and next time I would still use less. Though, I am a healthy eater and love greens in my pasta dishes, next time I'm going to switch the sugar snap pea pods with spinach. The author was right with the chili oil (red pepper flakes for me!), it adds a nice heat to this dish that changes the entire flavor profile.

We used dry basil and dried (3)chilli peppers in the oil before and during heating and cooking. We also liked about 1 head of garlic. The Sugar Snap Peas are a favorite but after following the recipe the first time we decided that they needed a bit more cooking and sautéed them in the oil and garlic first, adding the shrimp later. This has become a family favorite and our company loved it to the point of asking where to find this recipe as well. Bon appetite

This recipe is quick and easy -- perfect for a weekday meal. I would definitely use only fresh ingredients since the sauce is so light. We tried using frozen snap peas and it didn't taste very pleasant. I liked the sauce but ended up adding more chili oil since.

This recipe was good, but I added the following... I substituted edamame for sugar snap peas and used chicken broth instead of the white whine.. I used regular margarine also instead of unsalted butter I doubled them amount of butter as well as lemon juice and garlic. I had read a lot of people say it was bland but with my modifications it was simply delicious :) Thanks for the beginning recipe

I thought this was very nice indeed. Yes, its a light flavour but very good with pasta. I might try some of the suggestions next time, a little salt, black pepper, cayenne but I don't think it needs that much. Just a little tiny kick is all ;) Very nice.

This recipe is great with a few augmentations!  I added red bell pepper, asparagus, onions, and crushed red pepper.  I definitely added more garlic since my boyfriend and I are garlic lovers.  I also added a little Classico sundried tomato alfredo sauce.  We ate this with a garlic stuffed pork tenderloin and it was awesome!  :)

I really enjoyed this recipe. The chili oil was a different twist that I will definitely be using in my shrimp and stir fry dishes from now on. I used more chili oil than olive oil to spice it up. I eyeballed the amounts of everything because I cut the amounts way down since I was only cooking for one with enough leftovers for lunch. I decided to add a few things to this recipe: sliced mushrooms, black pepper, extra garlic, and I topped the dish with shredded parmesan cheese before serving. I also omitted the butter- you don't need it! I thought it was restaurant quality.

Nice light meal! I followed the ingredients precisely but modified the amounts slightly and it turned out so good that my husband suggested we have it again! Served it with rice and added a dash or two of parsley. Yum!

Quick and easy. I omitted the chili oil and my kids, husband, and MIL loved it.  Used the leftovers in a frittata (with some extra garlic, herbs, and cheese and that went over very well, also.

Pretty good. Did make a few changes because I read the reviews. Added more lemon. And yellow squash, which was amazing. Didnt have chili oil, so I put more red pepper flakes. We really liked it. We will make this again.

SUPER easy to make! The only thing I would suggest would only use the chilli oil and omit the olive oil as I didn't get much heat from the taste. I also didn't reserve extra pasta water as I thought the white wine reduction was more than enough liquid it needed. A few tweaks here and there and it would be perfect! So light and fresh for the summer :)

I made this last night and my husband and I enjoyed it immensely. Easy to make and wonderful to the taste. The recipe in all recipes magazine did not call for cherry tomatoes. I didn't add them and it was oh so good and filling. This is a keeper.

This is excellent!! We really liked.  However, I substituted snow peas for the sugar snap peas.  Also, the picture of the finished recipe showed garden peas and half cherry tomatoes, neither of which were in the ingredients.  Oops?  Definitely will make this again.  Great flavors.

I used snow peas instead. Next time I will use fewer pea pods and less pasta. Otherwise, it was awesome.

Great recipe.  More garlic required.  Recommend adding pasta just before El dente  and cook in sauce with shrimp etc. until pasta is cooked to liking.

I disagree with those who say the dish is "bland." I thought it was a wonderful change from the many overly seasoned and calorie packed recipes that we all love now and then. This dish celebrates the shrimp and garlic, given a kick from the chili oil. My husband and I were just as thrilled with it as leftovers, I might add.

Chicken broth instead of dry white wine worked out fine! Was a delicious dish!

Recipe and photo don't match.  Recipe calls for sugar snap pea pods while the picture looks like either canned or frozen peas.  The picture shows tomatoes but the recipe didn't call for them.  I made it with sugar snap pea pods, cherub tomatoes and instead of chili oil I used orange sauce.  It was good and I'll make it again.  It is interesting that if you have leftovers they are really good the next day as a cold salad.  Also, it's one of those recipes where the amounts of the ingredients is really subject to your particular tastes.  Put in more shrimp, less shrimp, no butter, more lemon juice.  It's just a good map to follow and where you end up is your decision.

I read the recipe  and the picture of the dish looks inviting but the ingredients don't match the picture. It shows peas not peapods and the recipe doesn't have any cherry tomatoes. The other reviewers were right looks bland as written.

Since folks said it was a bit bland, I sprinkled fresh grated Parmesan and extra garlic powder  on it all and it was just great.  I also added sliced grape tomatoes which are in the photo but not in the recipe.  I'd made this again and it's so pretty!!

I make this frequently.  Usually add mushrooms and onions and increase the amount of garlic.  However, if I use this recipe I'll have to find the chili oil.  I've looked in numerous grocers and have come up with nothing.  Can someone tell me where to look for chili oil?
