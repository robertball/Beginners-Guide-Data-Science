Very tasty. I accidentally used a 15 ounce can of tomatoes ( because I cant read it seems) and had to use ancho chill powder. I did add more mango because after adding the 1/4 cup.. it just didn't look like enough. I doubled it to 1/2c and think I'll add even more next time.

This was really good - I added the shredded chicken towards the end of cooking the sauce and used a large can of tomato sauce instead of both tomato sauce and whole tomatoes (mostly cause I misread the sizing of the cans). I also used some of the chicken cooking water with some chicken base for the chicken broth.

This was DELICIOUS! I used a can of diced tomatoes and paprika instead of the pasillo chili powder but still loved the dish. My boyfriend really really loved it.  I fried my corn tortillas to give it that umph! I am a picky eater so once everything was thrown together, I was actually a bit worried I would not like it (I knew my bf would though) but I didn't pick out 1 thing. 
Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper. :)

This is great! Changes: I doubled the mango, added a cup of fresh pineapple, swapped a 15 oz. can of chopped tomatoes for the smaller can/tomato left out the tomato sauce and sugar, and let it all  boil down to concentrate the  liquids. We also did without the tortillas.  Yum from everyone at the table.

A little more time consuming than my usual dinners, but so worth the wait! The sweet and spicy combination is perfect. You can add your choice of taco toppings but it's great without them. My only problem was that I underestimated the amount of time it would take the chicken to cook so I didn't have enough time to cook it down all the way at the end. Still good though.

Very tasty. It took well more than 45 minutes to fully cook down for me, though. The first time I made it, I it was still pretty moist (arguably too moist?) in the shells.

On the other hand, I was using hard shells instead of tortillas, so YMMV.

Made this tonight with some variation. My husband and I agreed it was a fantastic recipe! Do not leave out the cinnamon or the mango! These flavors combined with the spice was absolutely delicious!

Some variation . . . I used flour tortillas instead of corn. I did not use chicken broth. Instead of tomato sauce I used diced tomatoes with green chili (canned). And instead of using the chili spice and adding the other extra spices the recipe suggested, I bought "Texas Chili Mix and seasoning" from Sprouts. It contains chili, cumin, paprika, black pepper, onion, and salt. I did add the cilantro and lime. We kept it simple and chose not to add lettuce or salsa or anything else on top - it doesn't need it! 

I'm telling you . . . delicious!
