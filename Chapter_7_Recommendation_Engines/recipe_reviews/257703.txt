I made it just as written, except I used an avocado jalapeno ranch dressing I make (on the side). Will definitely make again. Served at a Christmas dinner w/ tamales, chili, etc. and it was all gone. Always a good sign!

Simple dressing but gives it that southwest punch we like!   Can use same dressing for southwest chicken salad, my burgers instead of thousand island, so many ways! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is incredibly delicious and nutritious. I had a ton of lettuce in the garden and wanted a salad for my entree. This fit the bill perfectly. I don't like out-of-season tomatoes, so substituted salsa for the chilis and roma tomatoes, which was easier anyway. Very simple and healthy. I'll definitely make this again.

This was awesome! I wanted to make another very similar recipe that called for a lot of the same ingredients so I halved this recipe and the other one too. The dressing in this one was by far the best and I really liked the green chiles this one called for too. Neither recipe called for olives but I had some and decided to add them and they worked nicely in this. This is a really good salad and with some grilled chicken added it would make for a perfect summertime meal. Thanks for sharing!
