This is a 4-star recipe ONLY if you do the following: Add 1/2 cup of honey mustard, 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar, 2 Bottles of Sam Adams beer, any saurkraut and polska kielbasa PEELED! Eat alone or put on a fresh hard roll. If you only use beer, you'll know you're missing something! I make this all the time this way.

I used some of everyone's suggestions!  Browned the sausage fast on high in an iron skillet, threw it in the crockpot.  Cooked 1/2 an onion and 3 cloves of garlic minced in the hot pan for about 5 minutes and added that.  Added about a tablespoon of caraway seeds, a healthy squirt of honey and one of spicy mustard.  And don't forget the apple!  This was delicious!

Absolutely loved it! I doubled the sauerkraut and beer(light beer). Otherwise there is a lot more meat than kraut.  Easy and delicious!  Did not add a thing!  Try it first before you doctor it.  Thank you for sharing!

Made this yesterday and was happily pleased.  I had to make a few changes, due to the amounts on hand.  I had 3 lbs of lite kielbasa, 2 lbs of fresh bagged sauerkraut, (which I rinsed then squeezed out the excess water).  Because of that, I used 2 bottles of Miller Genuine draft, following others suggestions that darker beers were too overpowering of a flavor.  In the cockpot, I mixed about a tablespoon of grainy mustard with the beer, since I had no caraway seeds to try.  Added a squeeze of honey, some fresh cracked black pepper and 3 bay leaves.  Sauteed a small red onion, thinly sliced, and garlic in a pan, then added that.  Then sauteed the kielbasa until just starting to brown, then mixed that in and let it roll for 6 hours on low.  I found it not to be mushy at all, or the meat to be spongy at all, like some others complained of.  It was delicious, very filling and great for the rainy evening.  I served it in a bowl with some roasted garlic mashed potatoes and it had a really nice flavor.  Will definitely make this again. (Side note--used one of those crock pot liners, which is essentially a baking bag.  Easier clean up sounded great to me, but it busted!  I still got juice all in the pot.  Ah well, it was worth a try.)

I brought this to work and everyone loved it. I browned the kielbasa and then transferred that to a plate.  In the same pan, I browned 1 chopped sweet apple with a chopped onion and then added 1 T of minced garlic. Threw it all in the slow cooker with 1 T of honey and let it do it's thing. I'm not a big fan of kielbasa, sauerkraut or beer but even I liked it.

This is very good (if you like this kind of thing).  I've been making the slow cooker kielbasa stew (on this web site) and I think I like the addition of the beer vs. the chicken broth.  I do think that adding an apple is essential to take the "tart" out of the sauerkraut.  Very good, thanks Beth!

I made this last night and my family loved it! My 11 month old couldn't get enough of the kielbasa.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the modifications I made. Following fellow reviewer advice, I browned the kielbasa, doubled the beer, added spicy mustard, a bay leaf and  onions and garlic. I used a 28oz can of sauerkraut and felt that that was more than enough. Next time I will use a smaller can. We will definitely have this again.

I made this for my fiance during his Raiders playoff game. Usually, he finds something he doesn't like about first-time recipes like 'too salty', etc. He did nothing but rave about it and had three helpings with mustard and tobasco on top throughout the day (a new record). I used Rogue Oregon Golden Ale which is a nice medium hoppy pale ale. (Sierra Nevada Pale Ale would also be good as well) He is all excited to try different beers in this recipe. I'll be making it often and it's SO easy. I set it on Low for 8 hours but stopped it after 5 1/2.

Very good bavarian style meal.  I used 1 lb turkey smoked sausage and 1 lb. turkey kielbasa.  It made it lighter and no one knew until I had told them afterwards.  It was not oily as other reviewers mentioned.  Also added garlic and onion to the crockpot and cooked  5-6 hrs on low.   Will make it again.

Very popular among the men in my family (and friends too).  I bet this would also good w/ polish sausage, venison or bear sausage (for you ladies who have men who hunt and are in need of new ways to prepare it). Loved the ease of this recipe - will make it again and I too might try it w/ various sausages! Thanks Beth!

The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star is because I made some additions. Like other reviewers I like onions, apples and mustard with my saurkraut. I cut up an apple and onion and put in the slow cooker with the sausage, added 14 oz of saurkraut then topped with Dijon mustard mixed with done brown sugar and used a bottle of Sam Adams. Made mashed potatoes to put under it when finished and was wonderful. I usually use pork tenderloin with sauerkraut but love the kielbasa. It is now my favorite sauerkraut recipe.

First of all, you have to like the taste of beer (my husband does, me..not so much). I decided to try the recipie as a change from my usual kielbasa and saurkraut recipe. To make this as a dinner for 4, I put 8 small/medium red potatoes in the bottom of the crock pot, then 1 (20 oz) can of saurkraut (drained and rinsed well), sprinkled 1 Tbsp of brown sugar over the saurkraut, then 1 lb turkey kielbasa cut in 2" slices. I cooked 1 onion cut in small chunks and 1 tsp minced garlic in a small amount of olive oil till the onion was slightly tender, then added the onion and garlic to the crock pot. I poured 1 (12 oz) bottle of beer over it all and cooked it as directed.  It turned out great and my family loved it.  Next time, I will add another Tbsp of brown sugar and maybe a sprinkle of caraway seeds to the saurkraut to add more flavor (or to disguise the beer flavor a bit more for my tate). This recipe is worth a try if you llkes kielbasa, saurkraut and beer.

This is perfect the way it is...I wouldn't change a thing! I always use a Sam Adams beer...boston lager, pale ale, whatever we have on hand, and it turns out sooo nice. I tried before with heinken and it was ok, not as flavourful. 5 stars, thanks to Jbbach!

This was very yummy!  I followed others' advice and added spicy brown mustard, garlic, honey, apple cider vinegar, and sauteed mushrooms and onions together.  I only used one can of sauerkraut and that was plenty.  I had only one pound of kielbasa so I also used one pound of smoked sausage and it tasted fine.  Served over mashed potatoes.  Will be making again!

There has got to be more to this recipe then what is written. It came out so very sour that we could not even eat it. I have never cooked with sauerkraut before. This sounds so good in theory...I mean really, cooking with beer, need I say more?

Being of Polish heritage, I was a little doubtful about this recipe.  After all, my grandmother had slaved in a steamy kitchen for hours before the sausage & kraut were presented.  However: Surprise!  The meat is tender, you don't have to add anything, and it smells great. Bravo, Beth! Munched on it all night.

This is a great base recipe and the reviews offer many options.  I doubled my batch.  Made it on the stove due to time constraints. Drained and rinsed my kraut.  Sauteed an onion, 1 Tbsp minced garlic and 2 apples in buttered.  Added in the kraut, kielbasa, 2 cans Bud beer and 1 tsp caraway seed. Brought to a boil then simmered for 1 1/2 hrs.  Served with buttered fresh rye bread from the bakery. Yummy.  Husband told me to rate this 5 stars!  Will try crockpot next time with a dark beer.

Having lived in Germany this was like going back.  I will say you must watch that the beer does not go dry.  Mine started to burn on as the beer boiled out.  Sooooooo easy.

Although i'm not a huge sauerkraut fan, this was pretty good. I too read other reviews and decided to brown the sausage for about 5 minutes first, then add some sauteed onions and garlic. Used 2 cans of 14oz sauerkraut instead of recommended amount (didn't seem like enough) Coors Light beer, a splash of dijon mustard, splash of honey, and simmered on low for about 5.5 hours. Pretty good!!

Delicious! I am not a big fan of sauerkraut (made it for my polish boyfriend) and we both loved it and ate the whole thing together! I added small chopped onion, 2 cloves garlic, and 1 tbs dijon mustard. I browned sausage, onion and garlic before. MMMMMMM! Was very easy too, will make again!

As written, this is not good. I couldn't taste the beer, apple, mustard or honey. The kielbasa tasted like saurkraut and the other ingredients just took the edge off the 'kraut. If I try this again I'll cook the kraut with more apples and honey, and put the kielbasa in for maybe and hour at the end.

This recipe sounded too simple to me, but it really had a lot of flavor!  I made it just as written and used a very light beer and turkey sausage.  It was a little salty, so if you don't like salt you might not like this.  And I got 6 small servings out of this, not 16 . . .

I added one squirt of spicy mustard and 1 squirt of honey to it and a little extra beer than called for.  My husband was in heaven!

Rated 4 stars because I made many changes. I thinly sliced an onion, minced 4 cloves of garlic, added a bay leaf, added 1 tbsp of whole grain mustard & used a dark german beer. Served with homemade soft pretzels, a whole grain mustard spread, & more dark german beer. Successful oktoberfest dinner at home.

Very easy, awesome dish! I always make a honey mustard sauce to go with it as another reviewer mentioned. I also put it over mashed red bliss potatoes. It's one of my husband's favorite dishes. Great for a cold night!

This was good but it definitely needs mustard. I took tips from others and sauteed the sausage, apple, onion and garlic first then added it to the beer and sauerkraut in the slow cooker. A little bland, but I will be trying it with mustard next time.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I did not like this recipe at all. While the flavor of the dish was nice the texture of the keilbasa was very mushy.

After reading other reviews I added a small amount of diced onion and potato.  I also added 1/8 cup brown sugar and only 1/4 can of beer.  The beer is definately a distinct taste in this recipe.  I liked it but my kids won't touch it!

I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this recipe.  I was hoping for a new twist on the sausage and sourkraut I usually prepare, but found this to be soggy as other reviewers said.  My recommendation is to cook your sausage in a skillet, add sourkraut and heat till warm, then drink your beer with the meal.

this was very good even though I didnt like the smell of it.  I used a pilsner beer, the can of sauerkraut and let it simmer all day (about 10 hrs) in a crockpot.  Im not a fan of beer really and not a fan of sauerkraut at all, but it made the kielbasa taste soo good!  after it was cooked I picked out the kielbasa.  Ill be sure to make this again!

So easy, yet so yummy!  I used turkey kielbasa to cut down on fat and it was great.  As for the beer, I used whatever my hubbie had in the fridge...Miller High Life.

Great just the way it is!! Has been a tradition at work for us on New Year's Eve for years. Wouldn't change a thing!  The longer you cook it the kielbasa will get spongy...so if that texture is not for you then cook it less or just use a pot on the stove to simmer it.

Great!! I really enjoyed this simple, easy, and delicious. What more could you ask for! Used miller lite for the beer and the only change I would make next time is to add more kielbasa. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum.  I added Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, sliced apple, 2 bay leaves, potatoes and yams.  Totally wonderful.  I drained and rinsed the sauerkraut.  No beer taste as I would be sensitive to it.  I served it to company and  got lots of reviews.  The house smelled heavenly, too.  With my slow cooker, I started the dish on High, then low and than back to high as the potatoes needed more time.  Will make again very soon.

Excellent !! My mother made this for years on christmas eve, soo sooooo miss hers. I read reviews and although this has few ingredients its the recipe people and the same as Mom made, if you start cooking and adding and browning you no longer have a slow cooker recipe. Just throw it in and wait. Great recipe JBBACH.

'Delicious' my husband said! What could possibly be any simpler? I just had to try this being he likes kielbasa and beer! Actually, it was quite tasty with no changes to the recipe. Will make this one again!  Thanks for the post!

I'm not a big kraut fan but I keep trying different recipes anyway.  My search is finally over!  I cored an apple and laid it on top and it made the kraut just sweet enough.  This one is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing.

Recipes don't come much easier than this one!!  Very easy to make, and quite delicious.  I added one apple cut in half to remove some of the tartness of the sauerkraut.  I was told this was the bext sauerkraut he ever tasted, even better than in Germany.  YUM!

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I made it exactly according to the directions using an amber lager. I did not like it all all and the boyfriend only thought it was okay. The beer definitely overpowered the sauerkraut flavor. The second time I made it, I used an apple cider. I also added a tablespoon of spicy brown mustard, a tablespoon of Apple cider vinegar (cooking for two, so the recipe was halved) and a chopped Apple. This time, the recipe was FABULOUS. I will be making the modified version again. As is without modification, this is a 2-3 star recipe. Good for a basis to experiment with.

The sausage tasted weird - I think it was the texture. I don't know why, something was just off. My husband didn't think there was anything wrong but I just didn't like it. I only used 1 lb of the sausage but didn't halve the beer or sauerkraut & I think as far as meat vs sauerkraut that was a good balance.  I added sliced white onion which I always do with sauerkraut.  I also took one of the other reviewer's advice & added 1 T each of honey & mustard to the beer.

Delicious!!! And super easy. I mean so easy it's ridiculous. I jazzed up the kraut a little with some brown sugar and Dijon mustard. I also threw in some brats with the kielbasa and everything came out great.

Nothing terribly special but it tasted good.  I added a squirt of spicy brown mustard and simmered it on the stovetop for a little over an hour.  I think cubed potatoes might be a good addition next time to give it a little more substance.

Loved it.  I used a squirt of honey and a big teaspoon of grain mustard in with the beer.  I used only 1 bottle of beer and 1 14 oz. can of sour kraut, and 1 lb (1 ring) of kielbasa.  Cooked in the slow cooker for about 3-4 hours and YUMMO!

First thing, I love sauerkraut. I like my sauerkraut on the sweet side and this was more on the tart side.  I would make the original recipe first. You can then make changes to suit your taste. As others suggested I may add some brown sugar or apple juice. Maybe throw in an apple! I will make again b/c it is easy and I love sauerkraut.

I like kielbasa.  I like beer.  I don't like this.  I just might try this again only with chicken broth.  When trying a recipe for the first time I like to follow it exactly and after that make changes that are more to our liking.

I thought this was just ok.  I prefer to have my kielbasa fried or grilled instead of cooked like this.  And I'm not sure what the beer did for it.  I'm glad I tried this, but I probably won't make it again.

This was delicious.  I used beer brats instead and took the suggestion for adding brown sugar and mustard. Perfect with mashed potatoes.

There are a couple of things you need to know before making this.... First and foremost... It will not make 16 servings... not even close.. I only used one pound of kielbasa and a 22 oz. jar of sauerkraut and it made just enough for my wife and I.  We ate the whole thing.  Second, if you use two pounds of kielbasa, you will have a lot more meat than you need for the 20 oz. can of sauerkraut. I used a dark beer and it gave it a stroger taste than I wanted so next time, I'll use a light beer. Aside from that, the meal was great. I gave it five stars 'cause I like sauerkraut and kielbasa together.

This was really easy. I threw everything in, along with some minced garlic and a couple of bay leaves, and five hours later it was done! I ate this on a bun with some deli mustard, my hubby (who doesn't like sauerkraut) just picked out and ate the sausage. I really liked this, he just thought it was okay (to be expected). I may try making this with a few onion slices instead of kraut next time, but if you like kielbasa, sauerkraut and beer, you'll love this!

I thought this recipe was great. I ate the sausage like a hot dog, in a bun with some spicy mustard. It really hit the spot when I was pregnant!

This recipe was so easy.  However, I think I would change the beer next time.  I used Newcastle and it was a bit overpowering.  Any suggestions on a better beer?  Overall, this was a great meal to throw in before work and enjoy later.  Put it on bread for a fabulous sandwich.  Can make lowfat too with turkey kielbasa.

I basically follow the recipe. I use Slovenian and Polish kielbasa, New Castle beer (I used Sam Adams first, but the New Castle just kinda compliments it in my opinion), add some mustard and a few spices, and leave out the sauerkraut (just not a fan). It's a staple in this house now!

I really enjoyed this as it is simple and tasty!  Made a few additions...placed thinly sliced onion and apple on bottom of crock pot. Placed kraut and kielbasa on top and poured one Guiness Beer on top.  Also added a few cloves of chopped garlic.  Cooked on low for 4 hours and served on top of cauliflower mashed potatoes!

Very good, and super easy!  I incorporated others' suggestions and added sauteed onion and garlic, honey mustard, honey, apple cider vinegar, and caraway seeds.  I also tossed in some sliced mushrooms.  This did not turn out mushy.  I would not take the casings off the sausages - I think they would fall apart.  I served this with applesauce and baked potatoes - had I planned ahead, I think german potato salad would have gone with it nicely.  I will add that I used fresh polish sausage.  Most of the photos appear to be of smoked.  (The recipe didn't specify which to use.)

I really missed something with this.  I am such a food lover I can't believe I'm giving anything 1 star...but the reality is, bar-b-q kielbasa on a roll with sauerkraut piled high and an ice cold beer would have been just as simple and tastes a lot better.  I really don't get all the rave reveiws.

This was a HUGE hit, with a few tweaks: Sauté one thinly sliced purple onion and add to pot. Peel several cloves of garlic and add whole to pot. Chop and sauté one green apple and add to pot. Use 1 1/2 bottles/cans of beer and a large jar of sauerkraut. Sauté the meat before you add it to the pot. I squeezed in a large squeeze of honey and brown mustard (each). Next time, I'll probably add a chopped potato. I also wouldn't simmer on high, but on low.

I don't think the beer really did anything amazing to the kielbasa. It tasted like sausage and sauerkraut to me.

I used fresh polish kielbasa that I boiled first and some fresh smoked that I cut up as directed. I rinsed the sauerkraut first and I added some potatoes(5 quartered)and horseradish mustard and it was fantastic! The sauerkraut was sweet and had a slight beer taste where the potatoes had a "bite" from the horseradish. The kielbasa was tender and very flavorful from everything. I will be making this again only this time I am doubling both the beer and sauerkraut (even though I hate beer and am not a huge sauerkraut fan).

Delicious and so easy!  Be careful not to overcook: I left my slow cooker on for almost 3 extra hours and the kielbasi came out waterlogged, but still tasty.  Next time, I won't rise the sauerkraut (love that extra bite it gives) and only use half a beer, and of course, cook it for the correct length of time.  Thanks for a great easy recipe!

Great!  I used Budweiser...turned out great!  Also threw in a chopped onion, a bay leaf, some caraway seed and spicy mustard.  I used Schwan's Frozen Polish Sausage (fully cooked) and it was perfect!

Super good recipe.  I threw the kielbasa on the stove to brown it, tossed it in the slow cooker with the bag of kraut, squirted in a hefty dallop of dijon mustard, dropped in a can of beer, and thought about it all day at work.  Next time I think I will cut up an apple to lessen the tart from the kraut.  Will definitely keep in my recipe box!

This was a good recipe but I also made some of the suggested modifications. I placed the sauerkraut and beer in the slow cooker. Then I added a sliced and peeled apple, some garlic, a bit of honey and some peppercorn mustard (about a tablespoon of each). I browned the Kielbasa on the stove and placed it on top of the sauerkraut mix and let it sit on low for about 5 hours. The end result was delicious. I served this with mashed potatoes.

This recipe is really good with some tweaking. I suggest eating it on rolls so you end up eating more of the sauerkraut, because that's the part that usually goes to waste. Definitely brown the kielbasa first and check its texture an hour before the slow-cooking time is up, to your liking. Mine has come out very soggy/mushy if I cook I the entire time. But tasty!

This one's only okay, simply because what makes this recipe good or bad is the type of sausage you get.  The first time I had it, I bought the real deal--big german brats.  They tasted wonderful.  The family loved it and wanted me to make it again.  When I made them the second time, I used a normal sausage, and they were much too oily!  I couldn't even begin to eat the kraut after it'd been sitting in that oil all day.  Yicch!  So I guess my best advice is to go for the best possible sausage, not too fatty, or you will pay for it when it's done cooking.  In either case, the meat was very tender!

Good Flavor,Tender sausage,but had too much grease and liquid.Next time I will simmer the beer until reduced by half and parboil the sausages to get rid of some grease.

My husband loved this..I gave it 4 stars because I am not a kraut lover. However, I did take the tip about adding some brown sugar and Dijon mustard. I used a mild beer, Pauley Girl, and I think it could have been a little stronger. I also added onion. This is a good recipe and I will  use it again because my guy really loved it.

Awesome, easy dish that my whole family loved.  I made 2 different crocks of it, used a light beer in one, a dark stout in the other.  The dark beer made it awful!  Use light beer and don't overcook it~ previous reviewers complaining about it being soggy may have left it in too long.  Great, fast recipe, thanks!

Everyone in my family loved this. I love cooking with beer, but my Mother-in-Law hates the smell of it and the taste of it, but she didn't even know it was in the recipe and commented on how wonderful it smelled. She even asked for a copy of recipe. I did however keep a watch on it and stired it every once in a while to keep it from scorching. Thanks

YUMMY AND EASY!! I came home from work to find that my boyfriend says..."I started your kraut and kolbasi for you"...(I had planned on cooking it the next day on my day off). Well, it's not even done yet and I keep tasting it! I threw in 4 pork chops (browned them first) and can't wait to eat it tomorrow!!  Thank you Beth!

I'm sorry, but this wasn't for me.  Maybe I used the wrong kind of beer?  Maybe a stout or a porter or something would have been better.  This was just blah.

I made this recipe and even did what some reviewers suggested and added honey, peeled the sausage, and added apple cider vinegar. My husband thought the sauerkraut was overpowering and I thought it was the beer. We just couldn't enjoy it.

I did brown the sausage in my cast iron skillet like someone had suggested.  Then added onions, kraut and caraway.  Threw in to slow cooker with leftover champagne and chicken broth (gluten free here). Delicious was exactly the taste i was craving.

This is an excellent easy recipe. I only use 1lb of meat since it is only the two of us. The beer I like to use is a Chinese beer called Tsingtao Beer.

My family loved this recipe.  I sauteed some garlic and onions in EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil Pan Spray)added sliced Turkey Kielbasa & cooked until slightly browned.  Then I added the Beer, 2 Tbsp. Horseradish Mustard and 2 Tbsp. Honey.  This was soooooo good. I cooked this on the stovetop in dutch oven for 2 hours. I would prepare it the same way if I used a slow cooker and after I saute' the vegetables and browned the meat I would transfer everything to a slow cooker.  I was surprised but the end results were Amazing.  Will definitely make this again :-)

If you like sauerkraut and sausage then you'll like this. Next time I make it I'll be sure to put the kraut and beer on the bottom and top with potatoes and brats and sausages. I had the meat on the bottom this time and it seems to have made he sausages soggy. I took the advice of others and added a tsp. of Dijon and some minced garlic and salt and pepper. I also added a few pats of butter on top. It was great. Thanks for a great slow cooker idea!!

I messed this one up.  I was trying to cook with a printed recipe without my eyeglasses (bad idea).  I halved everything, and for beer, used hard apple cider from Moose's Tooth (Anchorage).  I thought the apple hints would be perfect.  That was all good, but where I screwed up was not draining the sauerkraut.  Oooooh doggy that is some tartness in that crockpot.  I'm going to try again with the other rope of turkey kielbasa, better quality kraut, some apple, and prob the hard apple cider.  My dish as prepared needed some sweetness, more than I had added, that's for sure.

The recipe is good and we enjoyed it as a family.  It's probably not a "family favorite" but I will make it again.  As always, follow the suggestions - light beer, brown sausage, add an apple, honey and dijon mustard to the mix.

This smelled fabulous but the sausage was very dried out.  Maybe I made a mistake substituting Italian sausage.  The sauerkraut, apples and carrots I added tasted yummy.  But the meat was gross.

Wow......I had high hopes for this recipe but I couldn’t even eat it. I think the biggest thing is to not use kielbasa but a polish sausage. I was a little confused when other reviews said to brown the kielbasa. Any kielbasa i ever had has a real soft skin...not something easy to brown. My kielbasa was ready to liquefy after 4 hours of cook. I used Fat Tire beer which I like to drink....but I just couldn’t eat this. My husband said he will eat the leftovers but I think he said it to be polite. Do yourself a favor and skip this one....or have a pizza ready for back up.

I thought this was just okay. I doubt I would make this again. The beer I used was a bit strong and over powered the rest of the flavors.

We like others like to doctor a recipe to suit our tastes.  We browned the kielbasa with some garlic cloves before adding them to the crock pot.  I thinly sliced an onion and added it to the crock pot as well, along with some brown sugar.  We used a generic beer that my husband likes.  Turned out good, but I think that a better beer - like maybe a Sam Adams Honey Brew would be good.  His beer - although great for his bitter german beer tastes is acceptable - didn't do it for me as I am not much of a beer drinker.  It was tastey though and different! Thanks for the inspiration.

I should have read the reviews before making this dish.  I cooked it exactly as the recipe said, and the Kielbasa did not brown at all.  It didn't have much flavor and the saurkraut was pretty gross.  If I make this again, I will put the other ingredients in to cook with this and definitely brown the kielbasa before putting it into the slow cooker.

This recipe is awesome! So easy and so delicious. The entire house smelled so good and we looked forward to the meal all day. I was going to alter this quite a bit as others here suggested but my husband was convinced it would be great just as the original recipe states. So, all I did was cook up a few onions and garlic to mix in. That was the only thing I did differently. We used a bottle of Guinness. PERFECT! I'm glad I listened to my husband and kept it simple.

My husband thought this was the best ever!  I, too, browned the kielbasa first,  with about half an onion, minced garlic and just a touch of butter.  To the beer, I added about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 beef boulion cubes, before adding it to the crockpot.  What a delicious way to squeeze beer into my husbands food pyramid!

This recipe was okay and it was eaten. Nobody, but me complained.  Most likely, I didn't do something right.  I will try it again so I can make sure this is how I truly feel.

Other reviewers have left some very good suggestions on how to improve this recipe.  I added garlic and onion, stone-ground mustard, and a little honey.  Tasty with redskin potatos and sour cream.  3 stars w/o additions; 4 with.

This was some really good kielbasa.  The beer and sauerkraut taste wonderful.  No slow cooker, so just simemred on the stove top for a while.  Did brown the sausage just a little first.  Excellent.

Had a craving for some good German food and found this recipe.  I added a sliced apple which did sweeten the sauerkraut a bit.  Used light beer.  Added onion.  I served with mashed potatoes.  We loved it.

Soooo easy and REALLY tasty! The only thing that we would change is to add an extra can (or 1/2 can) of sauerkraut so that more of the kielbasa would be covered.

I used onions like another reviewer suggested cuz I dont like saurkraut but aside from that - I thought it was WAY too soggy (the sausage). i think you should use beer brats or something else but keilbasa was a bad choice.

This was good, but I cooked it for about 8 hours on low and I think that may have been too long.  The kielbasa was really soft, and a lot of the flavor had been leached out.

Great recipe - threw it in the crock pot before work with a bottle of Corona and the addition of a couple of bay leaves and garlic cloves. I used turkey keilbasa and my family was shocked that they had enjoyed it so much when I told them after dinner. (The boys frown on anything not full of fat!)

I personally thought this was delicious! I used turkey kielbasa and browned it in a skillet first. Then doubled the sauerkraut and used one 12oz bottle of a really good brown lager. Then sprinkled with pepper. It was delicious! Will definitely make again soon.

Loved it!  So easy. I used sweet Italian sausage because that is what I had in the frig, and added some small redskin potatoes. Ten minutes, and it came out perfect. Next week with kielbasa. Sydney

Excellent dish.  Remember, when cooking with sauerkraut I always put it in a strainer and strain the juice into a separate bowl.  Rinse the kraut, drain well and add to the dish.  After all ingredients are mixed, add some of the juice back to the dish - to taste.  Some folks like it more sour, some less.  Make this to your taste.

No changes, although I used Yeungling lager and "beer" was specified. I would suggest two minor changes:
1. Provide serving size: I found it made six portions for us.
2. The overall cooking time was perfect, but I could have done the same on high for 2 hours.

So easy and so tasty. Perfect for when you're busy. I would suggest a lighter, wheat beer for best flavor (Blue Moon).

We used 2 x 2# bags of sauerkraut, one can of beer and two kielbasas and two smoked sausage.  Cooked on low for 6 hours.  Then let it sit in crock pot on "keep warm."  Beer really soaked in the sausage and kraut nicely.

Growing up with a polish stepfather, I’ve been eating this recipe as written for years. Cheap and easy as it comes. For my own version, I add garlic and onion powder keeping it still simple so I don’t have to chop and dice. I also add fresh cracked black pepper. For those that didn’t like the texture of the sausage, try keeping it in one piece and laying it on top of the kraut. It will still cook but it won’t soak everything in. You can take it out, cut it up, and put it back in an hour to two before so that it soaks up some of the juices if you choose.

A five star meal if you follow reviewer recommendations.  Be sure to sauté the 1 large onion, 1 apples, 1cup carrots and 1lb kielbasa before the slow cooker. 5 hours cooking time is good for 20 ounces of kraut and a pound of meat.  Be sure to add 1/4 cup your favourite mustard, and 1/4 cup of honey.

I thought this was delicious! I did brown the kielbasa beforehand with a diced apple, tablespoon of garlic and a diced onion. Added to the crockpot of sauerkraut (I did a bag and a half), along with teaspoon of caraway seeds, 2 tablespoons of honey, two tablespoons of spicy brown mustard and a bottle of bud light. Cooked on low for 8 hours and it was very good. Will definitely make again.

This is my go to recipe for Sausage and Sauerkraut! Yummmm! Per other suggestions, after cutting the Kielbasa, I browned them in a skillet then placed them on a plate until the sauerkraut mixture was done.  After browning, I deglazed the pan by lightly carmelizing 1/2 of a sweet onion (sliced) so I could capture all the yummy brown bits from the sausages.  Another note, you can also use a cup of white German-style wine instead of the beer, which I actually prefer.  But either way, it's absolutely delicious!  Serve with spicy mustard and your favorite potato dish and it doesn't get much better!  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!

Make sure you rinse and drain the kraut before cooking.  Cook whole pieces and serve on a nice roll.  Also,  open two cans of beer, pour one over the ingredients and drink the other.  Had this every New Years Day since I can remember and has been a family tradition for generations from my Western PA Slovak side.  Your wife may ask you to sleep on the couch if you have more than one.

There was nothing wrong with this recipe, but there was nothing particularly right with it either.  Honestly, if you just heat up the kielbasa in a skillet and add the sauerkraut, it will taste just as good.

Delivers what it promises.  I used a German wheat beer and tend to cut the kielbasa in smaller slices than the recommended 2" pieces... Super easy.  Super tasty.  And easy clean up.

I read some of the previous reviews,so i adjusted the recipe. 
I sautéd some mushrooms,onions & garlic in EVO. set those aside then browned the sausage. then added stone ground mustard about a tablespoon, & little brown sugar. put all in my slow cooker, oh & I cut up a sweet apple & added that as well. cooked on low for 6 hours. no distinct flavor !!! it was kind of bland. Next time I will make the original recipe.

The first time I made this, I only made one change by adding a chopped up fuji apple because most of the reviews noted how tart this was. The apple helped with the tartness somewhat, and though it was good it had a strong bitter aftertaste. The second time I made this I changed it VASTLY using a little bit of changes made by several different reviewers. We used half a bottle of Sam Adams Oktoberfest, 27 oz of saurkraut, 14 oz of kielbasa (Hillshire farms) chopped into rounds and browned, 1/4-1/2 of an onion cooked first in the sam adams, 1 tb honey, 2 tb course brown mustard, and 2 fuji apples. Next time I may try skipping the apples and using apple cider vinegar as someone else recommended. BUT all these changes so much improved this meal that my husband had seconds. His comment "Whatever you did really improved on that sour aftertaste!" He loved it, and that was my goal. I thought it was pretty smashing myself! You definitely can't just follow the recipe, its obvious there is something missing.

Eh. Not good, but not horrible either. For one, the finished product was terribly unappealing.... My kraut was very, very brownish, as if I overcooked it (???) - even though I only cooked on low for 5 hours as directed. Since I had some smoked sausage in the fridge that was about to expire I decided to give this recipe a try. I "really" wanted to make kielbasa alfredo or island kielbasa (both here on Allrecipes), but my fiance didn't particularly care for either (sigh...), so we both agreed on this. I'd much rather have had plain ol' sauerkraut and sausage sans the extras (I added a good dose of honey and stone ground mustard, 1/2 T caraway seeds and half of a chopped (peeled) GrannySmith apple as others suggested) and cooking method. My only change (other than adding the extra ingredients) was to halve everything because I only had 1 lb. of sausage. My choice of beer was Budweiser (I am from St. Louis, after all!!!). Served over garlic mashed potatoes with rye bread on the side, this was a decent meal, but not one I'd repeat again. Thanks anyways :-)

I wasn't going to rate this because I screwed it up BIG time!! I loved every aspect of this recipe but my love for beer got the better of me. :O( I had only one kielbasa and a big jar of sauerkraut. I added some brown mustard, a bit of horseradish, some of this and some of that and 2 bottles of Mehana Porter. The beer is a wonderful local Micro brew but when cooked in this recipe made the it taste so bitter that after trying several things to save it, just gave up and though it out. Big Bummer Dude! I'll try it again sometime so don't make my mistake!

This was very tasty, however like some of the other reviews, the sausage was mushy. I added some Dijon mustard, small potatoes and onion and garlic. I think the cooking time should be shorter.

I followed the basic recipe, using a bottle of Newcastle as my beer, and added some chopped onions and minced garlic.  It wasn't bad, but something was definitely lacking in the flavor department.  It needed something more.  If I make this again I will try adding apples or raisins and mustard.

We quadrupled this recipe and served it at our apartment's Oktoberfest dinner. It was well-received, even by those who claimed they didn't like kraut. We didn't even use that great of beer - the Budweiser American beer (or something like that...it wasn't good to just drink so we thought we'd get rid of it in this recipe.) Even with the not-so-good beer, this was a pretty good & quick German sausage recipe.

Made this for Superbowl, along with a pierogi recipe from this site, and it was a big hit. From experience, I think the lighter the sauerkraut the less sour the taste.  Also, if you rinse it first in water, it will also decrease some of the sour taste.  I liked the addition of the apple.  I hadn't heard of that before. I used 2 different types of sausage from the Polish market near us.  We all preferred a darker smoked sausage in this dish. I've found that, depending on the sausage, sometimes you need to boil and/or brown it first to remove the greasiness of it. Especially if you use the American brands found at the grocery stores. You don't need to do that so much with a smoked sausage. I think if you seek out better sausage from a specialty market, the dish tastes better. Easy for me to say since we live within a big Polish community. Definitely recommend it with the "Grandma's Polish Pierogies" recipe found on this site, but be prepared for alot of work for that dish.  Luckily, this one was so simple.

Delicious meal!  Use a quality brand beer as it really gives it flavor.  I served it with spaetzle, a traditional German pasta.

Perfect for a cold autumn evening.  I used turkey polsa kielbsa and this was still good.  My one year old could not get enough of the sausage.  Took another reviewer's tip and served with potato pancackes.  Will definitely make again.

I made this today with fresh kielbasa
and it was very good.  Served to a 
Polish friend and was complimented.
Will do again but will not slice the
fresh kielbasa. I would slice the
smoked kielbasa.

Thanks for the recipes.****

Wonderful flavor!  I made this on my stovetop in about 15 minutes.  I served it over cauliflower mash and it was phenomenal.  A must make.

I really liked this recipe, but my children and husband did not. I think the sauerkraut did them in. I would suggest that you like both beer and sauerkraut before you try this recipe. Unfortunately, I will not make this again as I am the only one that enjoyed it.

Although, I have had polish sausage & sour kraut in a pressure cooker, I have not had it in a slow cooker. Here is what I thought. 
It smelled wonderful and the sausage tasted great with the beer flavor sealed in BUT the kraut was aweful! Which is usually my favorite part. I was very disappointed with this recipe. The kraut tasted like it had just been soaking up the warm beer. Followed the recipe correctly - maybe that was just the flavor.

Although this was a very easy recipe, it was delicious. My family loved it. Like other reviewers suggested, I added about 3 crushed garlic cloves and a couple of bay leaves to the crock pot. It turned out great!

Great recipe- the meat was so tender, and although the kraut doesn't give off a great odor while cooking, the end result is a crowd pleaser!!  I served with a side of horseradish for dipping.  Excellent- a definite keeper!

While I thought that this was good, my husband did not.  I don't really care for sauerkraut; he loves it.  It may not have been the fault of the recipe, as I chose to use the sweeter bavarian sauerkraut.  Polska kielbasa is, in my opinion, also a sweet form of sausage.  He kept saying that the meal was just too sweet.  Maybe I should have used a stouter beer (along with regular kraut).  I also didn't think that this was really a sidedish...2 lbs of meat pushes it into the maindish catagory, in my book.  I served it with brown, grainy mustard, fresh-baked, crusty dinner rolls and a simple tossed salad.  For once, my husband at more salad than anything else.  It was easy, but I won't try it again.
