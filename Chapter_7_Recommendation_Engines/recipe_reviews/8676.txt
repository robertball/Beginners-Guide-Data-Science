I LOVE to cook, and have no problem spending hours in the kitchen preparing a difficult dish.  So I was a bit hesitant to try this meal since it called for few ingredients and took little time to prepare.  Am I glad I decided to try it!!!!!

Not only did it take almost no time to prepare, but it was so good we were all fighting for the last piece -- this includes my 5 and 6 year old sons.  It tasted better than many of my complicated dishes!

The only thing I would like to add is that if you like to eat the skin (come on, admit it -- some of you do love chicken skin!), cook the chicken skin side down for the first 15 minutes so that it can dry and turn crispy for the last 15-20 minutes.

Thank you Teresa for sharing this fabulous recipe!

I changed it up a bit. I oiled my baking pan with a bit of Olive Oil. I used Kosher Salt (don't be too generous w/ salt if you are going to make the sauce), Fresh ground black pepper and dried oregano. Generously rolled each chicken thigh piece in seasonings. Brushed with the lemon juice and olive oil mixture. I used 350 oven (convection oven - roast setting)temperature. 15 min. each side. Brushed with mixtured when turning chicken pieces.(skin side up first side)Then back to first side for a quick broil on the skin side up side for just about two or three min to get the skin a bit brown. Take chicken out of oven at 170 degrees, it will rise another 10 degrees while the pieces sit on a plate. Don't let them sit in juice or they will be soggy. 
For sauce:
Pour off juices into a cup to separate the fat. Take most fat off. Pour juices , incl. browned bits, into a sauce pan. Heat with some white wine. Cook down until about 1/3 less. Add one tablespoon unsalted butter at the very end. Pass sauce with chicken. I liked this sauce alot on the steamed broccoli I served on the side.

I substituted boneless chicken breasts and baked at 350 degrees for 1/2 hour and they were perfect!

My whole family enjoyed this chicken.  I used bone-in skinless chicken thighs and added garlic salt to the mix.  I also slow baked them for about 1 hour 15 min at 375 to make sure they were tender.  Great recipe...I will make again!

I like this recipe cos its simple and quick and uses oregano - one of my favourite spices. To Jazz up the flavour even further, I omit the pepper and instead marinate the chicken for an hr in a marinade of oregano, salt, lemon juice, finely crushed garlic and a lil turmeric powder. Then I spoon the pieces and marinade into the baking dish, dribble a lil oil over and bake till a lil crispy. Yummm! and the turmeric gives it a nice colour.

Other than a temperature variation (350F for 50 minutes) I made the recipe exactly. Can't say if it was good cold or not, because it never made it out of the kitchen! For those who found it "bland", I think perhaps they didn't season properly with salt and pepper.  I actually didn't rub the oregano on the chicken (cause I'm lazy!)  I assumed the rubbing was to release the flavor and oil of the oregano, so I just crushed the oregano before dipping the chicken in it.  Then I salted and peppered LIBERALLY with Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper.  
**I DID absolutely try making the sauce by using the drippings, adding 1/2 c white wine, reducing, then finishing with 1 T of butter.  As good as the chicken was, the sauce was to die for!**
Talk about easy!  If you want to serve as a "company dish" it looks wonderful plated in a rotini pasta bowl, topped with the chicken sliced, ringed with steamed broccoli florets and drizzled with that phenominal sauce!

I was afraid the oregano would be overpowering, but it was great! Not sure I'd like this on boneless skinless breasts - maybe too much oregano then. I baked at 450 for 15 min. then 350 for about 35 min. (had another dish to cook at same time at 350) and it turned out great. Hubby doesn't like baked chicken and said I COULD make this one again. Thanks!

Great receipe.  Very fresh and light tasting.  I too used boneless chicken breasts.  Ingredients are common and it is a quick easy dish to prepare.  Definitely a keeper and would make for company.

This was a good recipe for three reasons:   1) It was tasty.  2) I didn't have to run out of my house and pick up a bunch of obscure ingredients that I'll never use again.  3) It was easy and quick.   Okay, that's four reasons but it was good. :)

This was very tasty. Near the end of the cooking time I broiled the thighs, skin side up until the skin was crispy. This recipe seems Greek to me and I was putting Feta cheese on salads while these were broiling. I decided to add a bit to the top of a few of the thighs. Yum...the flavor was even better. Next time I might work on making some kind of a Feta sauce to serve with them. BTW...they are low carb too.

I made this on the day it was posted for "Meal of the Day" because it sounded tasty and easy. Well, I thought the chicken thawing in plastic in the fridge was a whole cut-up chicken, not cutlets! So,I had to improvise by lowering the heat to 350 and I cooked them for about 20 minutes. They were still wonderful and my family really, realy liked them. This is one I'm keeping, and I will try it with other chicken pieces too.

I am giving this 5 stars based on what I did to the recipe.  The original does call for salt and pepper to be added to the oregano, so if you don't do that, I can see where it would be bland.  I used lemon pepper and tiger seasoning in with my oregano.  I skipped the step of rinsing and drying my chicken.  I dredged it in my oregano mixture, placed it in my pan, then drizzled the EVOO and lemon juice over the top.  I baked it for a little longer than called for (because my husband wasn't home yet).  I served it with roasted asparagus and rice pilaf...I loved the flavors of this dish and could see it with other spices as well.  I will be making this again, and again!  It doesn't hurt that I love chicken thighs to begin with and this gave me another fool-proof method of preparation!  Thanks, OP for the great recipe.

Nice flavor!  I rarely cook with any chicken except BSCB.  Not by choice, but necessity.  I bought six mark-down Smart Chicken legs (two pounds) and used this recipe to prepare them.  The only other sub was bottled lemon juice, as I didn't have any fresh lemons.  I mixed two teaspoons oregano, one teaspoon coarse sea salt, and one-half teaspoon pepper then kinda rolled the legs in the mixture, but I had to mix another batch of the spices to finish.  Be sure to cook skin side down during the first fifteen minutes!

Very nice flavor and easy to make. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. I added some wine to the sauce and used a whole lemon. This was very flavorful. Those who say this was bland might consider the age of their spices. Oregano gets old and loses flavor very quickly.

Even though the ingredient list is short don't be fooled! This recipe is packed with flavor.  Be careful to keep an eye on the chicken because the oil will splatter and might smoke in the oven at that high of a temperature.

This is a easy fast and fairly simple dish. If you're a salt and pepper guy or gal this is right up your alley. But it does need a few  ingredients to take it over the hill. Such as garlic powder, onion powder a little tyme basically whatever suits your taste just a little don't overdo it! I recommend cooking skin side down on high heat 450 degrees 15 to 20 minutes and then turn to the other side. The addition of turmeric will definitely give you a nice flavorful color. Just mix it together with your other herb and spices. Don't get me wrong definitely a keeper in my book. Especially when you're looking for a dish that looks good and easy to make. For these reasons and these reasons only, I only give it 3 stars. Add in herbs and spices definitely will turn into a 4 star dish.

Perfect recipe :) added paprika because I love the extra spice, but had to cook it for 10 minutes more in the oven. I also made risotto rice with peas along with it and a sauce on top. It was perfect! Thank you :)

I don't follow directions well.  I don't - & it isn't always on purpose.  I just think I know what I'm doing till I realize I messed up - or, at least, didn't do what I was supposed to do.  "Hello, Chicken Oreganato!  What can I do to you?"  :D  Well, I plumped the oregano, salt & pepper in the oil & lemon juice (bottled 2T).  I let the thighs sit in that for a while, half hour or so; just till I had the oven ready.  I baked them half skinside down; then, turned over.  'Didn't crisp so I'll remember that next time.  I'll also have to remember to make that sauce mentioned in the review (drippings reduced to 1/3, add 1/2c wine, 1T butter).  I spooned a little straight from the pan over plain rice & it was good as is.  I'll probably make again - when breasts are on sale instead of thighs.

This is a huge quick and easy recipe for me. I make this at least once a month. I did follow a posters recommendation to bake skin side down first, then flip to crisp the skin toward the end. One thing I did add was McCormick Rotisserie Seasoning to it. My husband doesn't like to be overloaded with citrus flavor, so that helps to give it another layer of season. Instead of rubbing it on the chicken, I mixed everything in the olive oil and used a basting brush to brush it on. We do drizzle the remaining oil on during cooking, to give it that extra bit of flavor. It's a big hit in my house!

I opted to broil on high for 2 minutes and low for about 6 minutes to help crisp the skin (our chicken thighs were untrimmed). Really great flavor, and super easy!

I thought this came out good.  I used lemon juice and put enough on it to where you could taste the hint of lemon. But my husband was not satisfied with it.  He didn't like it and does not recommend that I make this dish again.  Sorry maybe will make again when his not home.

Very good, we enjoyed it.  I didn't have oregano (oh horrors!)  but I did have the ambiguous "Italian Seasoning" which worked out well, and in addition to the lemon (lemon courtesy of the abundant lemon wedges from our haddock dinners this weekend -- frugal, huh?) I added some lemon zest.  Oh and I also substituted seasoned salt for table salt.  (I know how much some people hate it when you change up the dish, but in reality, I didn't change the essence of the recipe much.  Very tasty dish, I'll make it again.  I like recipes that don't call for a a bunch of different ingredients, or ingredients that you might only use for that recipe alone -- and this recipe works out very well, uses things I usually already have on hand.

Grateful for this recipe!! My husband is a very picky eater, he thoroughly enjoyed this chicken. I eyeballed the ingredients, and used garlic salt instead. Only critique from my family, could have used fresh garlic in the rub. Easy, tasty dish! I baked @ 375 for about 1hour.

This was fast, easy, and delicious. I had never made thighs before and I'm glad this recipe had all the stuff I had at home already, minus the lemon (I used 1 Tbsp bottled lemon juice instead). I also had to put a piece of foil just lightly resting over the dish in the oven as it started to sputter and smoke, but otherwise kept the recipe as-is. It's a good one for the weeknight hustle. Highly recommend!

Solid recipe. Simple and very tasty.  Did follow others suggestions by drizzling the drippings over the chicken.  I love thighs and this is my "go-to" recipe.

This was awesome!!! I would give it 5 stars, but I did amend the recipe just a bit.  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper , but also added garlic powder, poultry seasonings, and herbs d' provence.  I also added wine to the bottom of the pan once the chicken was done and scraped up the bits and mixed with the wine (as suggested by another reviewer).  This was so yummy.  Even used this on chicken wingettes and boneless chicken breast... The thighs were the best as they seemed to absorb the lemon and herb flavor the most.

Fabulous. Rather than just oregano, salt, and pepper, I added salt, paprika, onion, and garlic powder to the chicken, then a mix of Italian seasonings. I sort of followed another reviewer's suggestion and poured the juices off into a pan, simmered, adding to it cayenne, and a splash of white wine. Served over rice. This got rave reviews!

Everyone loves when I make this! Great economical dish that doesn't taste or look economical! No one has to know! I will try using chicken breasts next time. Make sure you have plenty of oregano on hand. I make this often, and came close to running out once!

I loved the flavors in this dish. But I did put the chicken thighs in a ziplock w/the lemon and oil and spices to marinate in the fridge for several hours. I think this really helped! A keeper!

This was good, but just average.  I added some chopped garlic and a little bit of Old Bay.  I don't think I'll make this again, I've found much better chicken recipes on this site.  Thanks anyway.

I like this recipe alot, I was going to make it the other night for a nice quiet dinner with my husband, but then my best friend and his wife called that they were coming, and if that wasn't enough, my husband ended up *accidentally* inviting some friends :) all in all this was great, i doubled the olive oil and the amount of chicken, and added some extra oregano and a bit of lemon juice i didn't end up following the recipe to the tee...but it turned out great! Thanks!

This was quite good.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, so cooking per directions made them overcooked.  Next time I will cook for 5 less minutes.  My hubby really liked this.  I served with Stovetop Stuffing and green beans, and it was very satisfying.

This recipe tasted great - with one exception.   There was a bit too much grease on the chicken.   The next time - I think I might put the chicken pieces on a grill rather than in the oven. or perhaps put them on a rack in the oven.

Great recipe for an easy dinner.  I have tried it different ways and boneless, skinless chicken thighs work best for me.  Add the lemon zest as well to really get the lemon flavor and use your favorite seasoning.  Broiling the last few minutes  browns it up nicely and the meat stays juicy inside.  Simple but yummy!

I made this exactly as described.   Also made the sauce from the pan drippings, white wine, and butter as described in some of the other reviews.  All good, but I would not say it was spectacular.

This recipe was easy (even for this novice cook) and delicious! Made the sauce suggested in the comments which was also great! I had some fresh rosemary and basil on hand so added it to the chicken. This seems to be a basic and versatile recipe, will make again!

Kinda bland.  For the amount of fat in this recipe (from the thighs & all the oil), I expected it to be tastier.  I thought it was ok, but not worth all the oil (that gets wasted in the bottom of the pan anyway).  My kids would only eat it once it was drowned in ketsup.

Oh this was really good. And really easy. I made it twice and both times added a touch of garlic powder with the oregano. There wasn't really a taste of garlic, so perhaps I should have left it out. Also, I just poured the liquid over it and baked it,  turning once in the oven. Soo good. Will definitely make again.

if you follow the cooking times, your chicken will be done, however the skin will be white. If you like it more brown and done on the outside, cook the second side for 25 minutes, and then broil for another 10 minutes.

Two words: juicy, delicious!

I might experiment with some other seasonings because although it did have a heaping helping of oregano, that flavor didn't really do it for me. I might add some more lemon, too. All in all this is definitely a meal I would make again.

We used thighs. Not a lot of meat, but good. Make sure to add the salt--I didn't salt it enough. I did what was suggested: bake skin-side down first, then up for the last part to make crispy.

This was a good recipe for thighs. We enjoyed it! It would be good with a little more seasoning, such as a Greek spice seasoning.

This was pretty good! I used vegetable oil cause I was out of olive oil, a little oregano, italian seasoning, and just a dash of garlic. It took a little longer to cook though... I also pulled the skin off cause i'm watching my calories. I reduced the recipe cause we only used three chicken thighs... it was really yummy!

I went to make this recipe and discovered I was out of oregano. I like the flavor of tarragon and lemon together, so I substituted it. Other than that, I pretty much followed the recipe. It's pretty oily, but the flavor is good. The goo left in the pan was also tasty, though bad for me, so I just tasted it. To get a little crispiness, I sprinkled grated parmesan over the chicken for its last 5 minutes in the oven. I liked the lemony flavor and will likely make a less oily variation (skinless thighs) next time.

Love it!!! This is sooo good. If you like the flavor of lemon you will love this. I used a whole lemon and a little zest. I also added about 1/4 cup of white wine to the sauce. Fantastic!

Our family loves this chicken recipe. I add a little more lemon juice - the tang of the lemon and the taste of the oregano go great together.

This was amazing. After doing the oregano, salt and pepper to taste, I added some dried minced garlic and dried minced onion and this was incredible. Also used the suggestion of cooking it skin down first and I will definitely do this again :)

This was very good.  I used a cut up chicken (since that was what I had on hand).  It did take just a bit longer to bake than the recipe called for. I did use the "sauce" idea from another reviewer and it turned out well.  Hubby liked it and so did I.  Thanks for the post.

I loved the lemon/evoo combo, but I added many more herbs and spices to give the breasts I used a little more flavor.
Great start tho; especially for breasts which tend to be on the drier side. Thank you Teresa!

Don't let the simplicity of the recipe fool you, this is delicious!  I misread the instructions and set the oven to 400 degrees so baked the chicken for longer.  The leftovers are terrific.

I mod'd this recipe to 6 pieces and just threw on enough seasoning too look good to me (a lot).  Of the lemon tree I used two small instead of one.  I approximated a little more than three Tbs. of the olive oil.  Used skinless thighs since there was enough oil in the recipe.  I poured a little more than half of the lemon oil mix on the chicken the first time so I had to turn the chicken in the pan by hand to coat them thoroughly.  Drizzled the remaining 1/4 on after 15.  Still turned out *wonderful*, moist and flavorful, if I do say so myself.  I'd not make the mistake again of adding too much of the lemon/oil at first and add more later so more lemon comes through.  Thanks for the EZ meal.

This was an enjoyable, quick and easy entree. I used eight chicken thighs with the skin removed in order to make it even a little healthier. The calories for this dish are already very reasonable! With a green salad and a side of green beans this became a very tasty and guilt-free meal. My husband really enjoyed this, and while I thought it was very good, I felt that the flavors were less complex than I usually prefer. But also I am not one to order lemon chicken dishes when we are out either. We will be having this again, especially on nights when we want a quick and easy dinner.

Definitely easy and the flavor was ok, but I didn't alter the recipe any and there was a ton of oil in the bottom of the pan. I also found it a little boring, with all that oregano; couldn't taste the lemon at all. The kids ended up scraping off the "green stuff" which they seemed to find was just too intimidating. Probably won't make again, but thanks anyway!

I too made this with boneless skinless breasts as that's all I had, and baked them at 375 for about 30 minutes.  Good flavor!  I will try with thighs and make these for a picnic next.

This was great! Very easy to make. I used boneless, skinless chicken because we're all watching our weight. The lemon really perked it up. Came out really tender. Even my picky pre-teen brother liked it. Great with any side dish (I served low-sodium stuffing and green beans).

Although I found this recipe very flavourful I would suggest fresh oregano and a touch of fresh basil.  Other than that it's great.

loved it! I made boneless/skinless chicken thighs. My seasonings were a combo of oregano, S&P, thyme, basil and marjoram. I sprinkled seasoning over chicken, drizzled oil/lemon juice mixture, baked 15 min, turned over, drizzled rest of oil/lemon juice and baked for another 25 min. It was that easy. The chicken came out so juicy and tender. I drained the "drippings" from the pan into a measuring cup, skimmed the fat off the top, put the drippings in a small saucepan, mixed a bit of water/cornstarch to thicken it up, boiled it and made a sauce. I recommend to give this a try!

Easy and good! I added some minced garlic to the mix but only because I love garlic.  They were so easy and I had all ingredients on hand. Made a great weeknight meal - served with broccoli and fried potatoes.

I made this with the Mushroom Rice from AR and I must say it was delicious! I didn't have a lemon so I used juice, I didn't dry the chicken, and I put the seasonings-with paprika-under the skin too. My chicken came out crispy and tender. Thanks for an awesome recipe.

I felt that it needed a bit more of the citrus tang, so I used the zest of one lemon, and increased the lemons to the juice of two lemons. I also garnished the thighs with a thin slice of lemon on each. Very refreshing and the lemon slice cooks into the skin. I love this recipe and its a weekly favorite!

Okay, it was quick, and easy, and the ingredients are common, but the boyfriend and I both found this much too dry and not at all flavorful. If I come back to it I'll try marinading the chicken in the lemon juice and oregano for a while before preparing it, but it's probably easier to just move on to a new recipe than fiddle with this.

WOW! Just made this chicken and followed what the other reader suggested about the wine sauce. It was amazing.... You really must try this! Being Greek, I loved it more  :) I used boneless skinless chicken and it was great...Next time I am using chicken with skin, I love crispy skin and am sure it will be just as good,if not better  LOL

This was good and easy to make!  It tasted stronger of lemon than oregano, though. As a lemon herb chicken, I would've given this 5 stars.  (Only because I anticipated less lemon flavoring and cooked side dishes that didn't go so well with the lemon flavor did I only give it 4 stars)  Chicken was great though!

This was good! Next time I will make sure I put plenty of salt and about 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Maybe garlic powder too as others suggested. But it went over well with my whole family. I put plenty of oregano on them this tim; it's a great flavor with the lemon.

This was a wonderful recipe!  I made it for guests with Hazelnut-mushroom pilaf and got rave reviews!  I didn't  have any olive oil so I just mixed a little canola with the juice of about 4 small meyer lemons and poured over the thighs.  They turned out very tangy and delicious.  It is going to be a family favorite.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet!  This is my "go-to" chicken recipe when I have dinner guests.  It is so good!!  I have used boneless, skinless thighs, bone-in thighs, drumsticks, even leg quarters- it is always a huge hit no matter what part of the chicken I use.  I add a little rosemary and garlic powder into the rub.  I also pour off some of the oil in the bottom of the pan before I turn the chicken.  It gives the chicken such a wonderful chewy texture.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

This chicken dish is "good" but not very flavorful. I even added minced garlic as others suggested but it wasn't amazing. I would suggest doubling the spices. I used boneless/skinless chicken but I doubt that had anything to do with the end result in terms of flavor.

I added a few of my favorite seasonings.  The recipe itself is easy and quick which works for my partner and I since we both don't get home until 7pm after work.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick easy dinner but I don't think I would cook it for guest.

This recipe was so easy and so good.  I rubbed the chicken breasts with the dry mixture and added a minced garlic clove, bit of olive oil. I baked for 15 mins each side. The breast did not produce much juices/drippings but took the chicken out of the pan and poured into a saucepan adding white wine and chicken broth.  The sauce was a great addition to the chicken.  The meat was so moist and tender. I served over vegetables brown rice...yummy!  Thanks.

This recipe had great flavor.  I guess I was a little liberal with the spices.  I broiled the chicken for the last five minutes to make the skin crispy and delicious.  Next time I'll try split chicken breasts though.  I'm really not a fan of chicken thighs.

I LOVE this recipe.  I've been making it since I got married (with a few substitutions).  We use boneless, skinless chicken breasts & greatly increase the amount of oregano & pepper.  Turns out good no matter how much you use, though.  I do have to cook the breasts a little longer than in the recipe, though.

We tried this dish and it was good. I added some old bay and served it with buttered peas and rice. I think it needs somthing more though. It is missing a kick. I will make this agian.

This was delicious!  I had three boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Otherwise I did not change the original measurements and had no problem.  I did use the juice of one whole Meyer lemon.  I baked at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.  The taste was outstanding and the drippings were delicious spooned over the accompanying rice.  This was so easy to put together with very few but very tasty ingredients.  Dinner was ready in 30 minutes!  And tasted great.  My kind of recipe!

I made this as written (minus washing the chicken.  i did dry it though).  It turned out fairly well, the skin was crisp and tasty, but the meat didn't seem to pick up as much of the flavor as I would have liked.  

I also had a few lunches from the leftovers on this one, while they were good, it didn't seem like they heated up well or that the flavor kept.  I'll probably make again, but only if we'll eat it all the night that it's made.

This super easy dish is one of my husband's all-time favorite ways to eat chicken.  I make it directly as written, or sometimes add garlic.  Honestly, though, it is amazing how flavorful it is as written.

Amazing!!!!!! So delicious and yet so simple to prepare taste even better he next day. I used mexican oregano & as suggested by another reviewer  I put the thighs skin side down after about 18 min, I flipped them and sprinkled a good amount of paprika to have have skin brown up a bit more & they went right back into the oven, paprika will not alter the taste.

This chicken was awesome!  It was so good that I was sorry that I hadn't made more.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and put it in the oven skin side down first so that it would be nice and crispy by the time it came out.  The boyfriend licked his plate clean!

The lemon/oregano mixture did add a great flavor but it definitely needs the garlic powder added.  Will make again as it's quick and easy.

This recipe was quick and easy. The thigh is a very juicy piece of meat. I am just getting into the whole cooking thing as I finish college. It's been a while since I have got to cook with my mom. I served it with steamed asparagus. Delicious.

Flavor was great.  Honestly, this was the first time I have cooked thighs before since I'm a white meat girl.  AND...I found out pretty quick that dark meat is not my favorite! LOL. Will try this again with chicken breasts.

I'm sure the original version is good, but since I like spices more than I like chicken, I doctored it up. I added thyme, basil, pepper, kosher salt and fresh garlic.  Grilled the thighs on a Foreman, too - took about 10 minutes and the chicken was very good.

This was a wonderful new way to make my chicken.  I made it last week sometime, and I'm planning on making it again tonight, and for my family (at mom's house) tomorrow.  Thanks.

It's deceptive in its simplicity, but this recipe yields a delicious dinner each time I've tried it.

This is a very simple and tasty mid week meal.  If I ever have any leftover I'm going to make it into chicken salad, but it always seems to disappear to quickly.

This chicken had really great flavor.  You do have to be careful not to overcook it, especially with a convection oven, as I did.  It was good though.

An easy recipe for the middle of the week.  Following suggestions from others, I also greased the baking pan with a little olive oil and used Kosher salt instead of regular salt.  The flavor was great!

I think it would have turned out better if I would have used chicken breasts instead.

I made this on my first night in my new apartment...whoops!  My baking dishes were still packed away somewhere!  So I did it on the stovetop and it turned out fine.  I was concerned about it being bland, but it was actually pretty tasty.  FYI, as mentioned in other reviews, there was a lot of oil/fat in the bottom of the pan and I couldn't taste much of the lemon, but this was not a problem for me.  Thanks for the super easy recipe, Teresa

This was only so-so for me. I followed the recipe exactly. The chicken turned out over-cooked and dry and the flavor was nothing to get excited over. It didn't taste bad, but I probably won't make it again.

Very good. I was afraid it would be bland, so I added the zest of the lemon to the oil and lemon juice mixture. I also put crushed garlic under the skin of each piece of chicken. My family loved it. It's definately a 'do-over'.

Tasty and quick. Although to give 5*'s the recipe has to be a knockout. I used another user's suggestion and served it with feta, tomatoes and some pasta.

my family loved this dish. it was terrific cold for our picnic with pasta salad, tossed salad, and iced tea!
the chicken is neat, not messy, to eat with one's fingers. the flavor of herb and lemon is subtle but delightful.
