Following other suggestions and throwing in some of my own - I replaced the oil with 1/3 heaping cup of applesauce, for sweetner used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 1/4 cup mashed bananas, 1/4 cup nuts and 1/4 cup raisins and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  Moist, low-fat, delicious way to use up those ripe bananas!

I loved this rich and healthy banana bread. I used a little more banana and replaced the oil with applesauce, making it a little more healthy. The catch was I had to bake it about 5-10 minutes longer, but it turned out perfect.

I really liked the taste and texture of this bread.  I substitued unsweetened applesauce for the oil and used egg whites instead of whole eggs and it still came out delicious.

Loved this.  I'm usually not thrilled with the results when baking with honey but this is wonderful.  I used a very finely ground whole wheat flour so the bread is a light texture.  Whole wheat flour has a much shorter shelf life than white, so if it has been sitting in your cupboard for a long time it's best to buy a new bag.

This bread is fabulous - healthy and moist and just really, really yummy.  I add some cinnamon and nutmeg to mine, for a little extra flavor, and sometimes as many as 2 cups of bananas - which makes it even moister and more flavorful.  I discovered this recipe a week ago and I'm making it today for the third time - it's that good!

Very good. I used applesauce-country berry/no sugar added, instead of oil & put it in a 12 muffin pan for 12-15 minutes and it was great. I also added 1/4 cup carrots. Gotta get it in for the kids!!

I was looking for a healthier banana bread recipe, and I have definitely found it!  I replaced the oil with applesauce and it came out sooooooo moist and yummy!  I'll be making this one on a regular basis.

I found this loaf a bit bland and would have prefered it to be a little bit more moist.  Next time I will add some spices and perhaps a bit more oil or an extra egg.

Great recipe! I have made it several times and have even added a little applesauce to make up for lack of banana!  I also use pecans instead of walnuts and add 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice to give it added flavor.Watch the bread, it does cook faster.  Generally around 50 minutes!

The whole wheat flour and optional oil makes this a healthier version of a favorite in our house.  I found it easy to make, moist and delicious.  The only problem is that I have to make it so often - it disappears too quickly!

This one was super easy to make and it turned out wonderfully! I don't usually like the way baked goods turn out when made with honey, so I used 1/4cup honey and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also eliminated the egg yolks, just using 2 egg whites instead, subtituted applesauce for the oil, and added 1 1/4 cups banana instead of 1 cup of banana. To spice it up a little I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 3/8 tsp nutmeg and substituted raisins for the nuts (I will probably add about twice as much spice next time). I greased a 3.5x12 bread pan with veggie oil and sprinkled a bit of flour over the oil to make sure that the loaf wouldn't stick to the sides, and baked the loaf for 53 minutes at 325 degrees. It turned out PERFECTLY. It is nice and moist and a little bit chewy, with a delicious flavor that's not too sweet and not lacking in sweetness, and it doesn't taste grainy like whole wheat tends to, or icky as most things that I make with honey do. This is a keeper!

Great! I did the ol' applesauce trick instead of oil. I also added about 3tbs greek yogurt to make my muffins moist. I used 3 medium bananas because 1 cup didnt seem banana enough for me. I got 15 large muffins from these measurments. I made a few w/out walnuts due to a nut allergy & they were awesome...almost better.Trick::spray your honey measuring cup with non-stick spray, the honey will drip right out! Just a note, honey actually has MORE calories than white sugar per serving, but it does have higher nutritional value and is not refined.

My whole family loved this- including my husband who hates healthy food.  Here are the changes I made:  2/5 C applesauce instead of the oil; 1/4 C honey plus 1/4 C brown sugar for the sweetener; 2 mashed bananas; 1 1/2 C whole wheat flour plus 1/4 C ground flax seed; 1/4 C nuts with 1/4 C raisins; 1/2 tsp cinnamon.

Yummmmm.  Super moist.

This banana nut bread verison, with whole wheat flour turned out very moist and delicious! I made a few changes to the recipe though: 1) I omitted the nuts, and added coconut instead. 2) I added an extra ripe banana to give it more of a moist, rich, banana taste (which it did). 3) used both whole wheat flour and white flour, to even the texture/moisture of the bread. (I read on the whole-wheat flour bag I had, that the instructions on it recommended that, when making baked goods with whole-wheat, they will turn out best, if you use half whole-wheat and half white flour. This will give the baked item, a more even, perfect texture. I am so glad I did this, because my banana bread's texture/moisture was perfect! You wouldn't think the bread was made with whole-wheat, which..most of the time, tends to make them, dry and dense.) Everything else, I kept the same. The bread was so, so moist and soo good! Except for the coconut. Next time, I will leave it out. It made the bread texture feel kinda funny in my mouth, lol. Next time, I will try some semi-sweet chocolate chips, to replace the nuts. This is a wonderful recipe for a whole, wheat banana bread! My son and I love it! (My husband said it okay, but he just said that cause he's not a big fan with quick, healthy-type breads like this one. But, this banana bread was moist and tasted really good, for a healthy-version.

I tweaked this recipe a little bit and found it FABULOUS. Here are a few tips:
1.  Use a 6-Cup Texas Muffin Pan for cafe-style muffins.  They're monstrous!
2.  Swap Vegetable Oil for Olive Oil.
3.  Use 4 medium sized banana's to make it moister.
4.  I was out of Vanilla extract so I used Almond.  It was a nice flavor...very aromatic, but not overpowering in the least.
5.  Use organic wheat flour. It has a ton of Dietary Fiber.
6.  Add 1 cup walnuts (vs. 1/2 c) to make it chunkier.  
7.  Fill the muffin pans to the top.  The batter will round out nicely.  Note: Wholw Wheat Flour does not rise very high.
8.  Garnish the muffins with a sprinkling of corasly chopped nuts.  It makes for a gorgeous muffin!

Makes 6 servings.  Double the nutritional info.
Bon Appetite

This is a very good, moderately moist bread. It didn't feel heavy or greasy. Although I did reduce oil to 1/4c because I had an extra 1/4c of bananas. Thank you!

This is a great banana bread recipe.  The whole wheat flour gives it a great texture and taste.  This bread is very moist too.  I have made this bread several times and usually it is done after 50 minutes of baking instead of the 55-60 minutes stated in the recipe.

I can't be really objective since our family doesn't like the taste of "whole wheat" but I had a whole bag that needed to be used up!..  I added 1/4 cup brown sugar to sweeten it up more to our liking.  I also added walnuts.

Stellar!! 
But here's some tweaks to an otherwise moderately healthy/delicious quickbread: 
-- Use 3 eggs & 1+ banana for a more moist bread; 
-- 1.5 tsp vanilla & .5 tsp nutmeg for more flavor; 
-- Bake for 45 min & check if a knife comes out clean (mine were done before 55 min)

Good and easy to make. I like the healthier option with the whole wheat flour and next time I will try the applesauce in place of the oil. I left out the nuts because I hate nuts in my bread. I give it 4 stars because it was bland. I meant to add cinnamon and nutmeg and forgot, won't forget when I make it again because it needs them.

This recipe is AWESOME! SUPER MOIST! I made these with half agave and half honey and tsp of cinnamon. I also omitted the oil for about 1/2 c of apple sauce. I baked about 12 muffins for about 25 mins and they turned out SOOOO wonderful that I'll make them again this weekend when my bf comes home! I did add a few mini chocolate chips and I think next time I'll add 1/3 c of agave/honey because they were a bit sweet to me. In addition this next time I'll use egg whites in place of the whole egg and see if they end up being less moist but I can't see that happening. Oh, perhaps I'll use Stevie extract in place of the honey. Hmmm, will keep you posted!

I added only 1/4 cup honey and added 1/4 cup sugar.  I used two bananas and added 2 squares of semi-sweet chocolate cut into chunks.  This is pretty good warm.  The chocolate is gooey and gives the bread a great flavor!

I don't know what happened when I made this, I followed the recipe exactly as stated. It came out heavy and hard, and tasted horrible. It also left a bad after taste in my mouth. It didn't rise very much, maybe that was the problem. I'm not going to attempt this one again.

Moist, tasty and nutritious. My 16 month old, who does not like bananas, enjoys this bread.

Instead of vegetable oil, I used melted butter. Instead of plain melted butter, I steeped a chai tea bag in the half cup of steaming hot water and used the chai. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. I made banana muffins out of this recipe and I did get exactly 12 largeish muffins out of this. 350* for 20 minutes was just right. This turned out very dense and moist--the chai made it SO good and it was just sweet enough. My boys have eaten two muffins a piece since making this recipe late this morning. SIDE NOTE: Since I had my oldest boy helping me make this, the recipe was very straightforward and simple for him to understand and all I had to do was stand back and watch. I'll use this recipe again.

YUM!!I used applesauce instead of oil, added some extra mashed bananas (maybe 1/4 - 1/2 cup extra), added a light sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on top, and made as muffins.  I baked them for about 20 minutes

Definitely more of a bread than a cake.  I substituted 1/3 cup of light applesauce for one half of the oil, added 3 tbls of dark brown sugar and doubled the amount of bananas.  It still has the consistency of a slice of whole wheat bread. It would benefit from more banana and walnuts.  I would probably like it better with half white flour, more oil and sugar, but that blows the healty aspect.  The flavor is good and I have learned not to expect Grandma's banana nut bread from whole wheat flour and honey.

I made this recipe true to the original only using the applesauce for health reasons as an option that was suggested.  I resisted the temptation to Dr. it with additional spices.  This was totally wonderful as written and I would not change a thing.  I am excited to find a very good healthy bread recipe.

This was my first attempt at banana bread. I was truly amazed! I did sub the oil for applesauce and used King Arthur's White Whole Wheat flour !  It was still moist 3 days later! I'm now making my second batch for the freezer for the Thanksgiving holiday!

Great recipe!  I only use 100% whole wheat for health reasons and this recipe is super.  If you want to even go further with health you can substitute banana baby food for the oil and use 1 egg and 2 egg whites.  It will turn out delicious either way!  :)

Five stars with these additions. I just made this bread because I had 3 very ripe bananas. Here is what I added/substituted. To flour mixture I added 1 TBLS ground flax seed;1/4 tsp cinnamon;1/4 tsp nutmeg. To the wet ingredients I added 3 ripe bananas;1/3 cup natural applesauce in place of the oil;1/2 cup plain yogurt; 1 egg plus 2 egg whites. I baked them in one stadard loaf pan and one small loaf pan (not a mini). I cut the baking down to 40 minutes. This is a great recipe and will replace my other high-fat, high-calorie banana bread recipe.

This banana bread recipe is NOT your typical "whole wheat dry as a bone" banana bread!  It stayed moist until the last slice!  Bananas too ripe in my house get popped in the freezer to make recipes such as this!

I was thrilled to find this "whole foods" recipe for banana bread, and even more thrilled that it turned out so well.  I made it once as directed, and once with twice as much banana.  Both were good.  The one with double the banana was VERY custardy, but took a while to get cooked through.  It is plenty banana-y as written, though.  I tried the muffin variation mentioned and had good success with that, as well.

If you use whole wheat PASTRY flour, you'll need about 2-1/4 cups, as this type of flour absorbs less moisture.

Also, I suspect that some of you who disliked the whole wheat taste would prefer it with WHITE wheat flour, rather than the RED wheat flour usually available at the supermarket (which has a much stronger flavor).

I found, though, that the recipe worked perfectly as written, and is very tasty.  I may add 1 tsp. cinnamon next time.

I followed the tips from some of the other reviewers and substituted sugar free applesauce for the oil and mixed half whole wheat with regular flour.  Turned out moist and the texture was perfect.

Just tried this bread and it was delicious. The only problem was that it just wouldn't bake inside. I baked it for 15 more minutes, on 220 degrees Celsia and it just didn't work. I am definitely gonna try it again, maybe with the apple juice.

I made cupcakes instead of bread. This is very moist and the perfect consistency. However, there is not enough banana flavor. I did add more bananas, as others suggested, but it just didn't tasted like banana bread. I added chocolate chips to one batch, and those were excellent. But the recipe itself is missing something.

Loved this! I used 1/4 C honey and 1/4 C dark brown sugar, and all applesauce (unsweetened) to replace the oil, which made it healthier. I was shocked how moist it was!

This was an absolutely great recipe and my husband said it is a keeper.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and added 1/3 cup of applesauce instead of the oil to make it a little healthier.  I also added 1/3 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of butterscotch morsels (so yummy).  Tastes almost like a banana split.   I am amazed at how moist this bread is.  I was afraid of using whole wheat flour (this was my first time baking with it), but I don't think I'll ever use white flour again.  I will keep this in my recipe book forever.

This banana bread was wonderful. It was so moist, even days after it was baked. I've tried a couple of banana bread recipes on this site and this was, without a doubt, the best one. A little more dense than the others, but SO delicious! I am shocked at some of the poor reviews this recipe got.

my whole family loves this recipe. i use it to trick them into eating healthy! Im a more experienced cook, and I substitute a little over 1/2 Cup of Olive Oil for the vegetable oil plus I use an all natural fruit based sweetener called Fruit Sweet (available at some natural foods stores). its sweeter than honey, and adds extra moisture. Nuts are deffinately a must for this recipe!

Wow - finally a healthier version of banana bread that my family loves!  It actually tastes better after it cools.  I stored it wrapped in plastic wrap in the frig and we ate it cold - which intensified the flavor and made the texture more dense.  Will increased walnuts to 3/4 cup next time.  Thanks for the great suggestion of freezing overripe bananas -- now I'll always have them on hand.

I made this yesterday and it was so fabulous and my kids so sad that we managed to eat the WHOLE thing and it was gone...that today I ran out for groceries this morning and got a pile of overripe bananas from the reduced section and have made 3 loaves and will be putting two of them in the freezer.

Yesterday I made the recipe as is except I had no honey so I used 1 cup turbinado sugar.  Today I have used half oil and half unsweetened applesauce, and half splenda and half honey.

I am wondering if the people who commented it was not sweet enough used 1/4 cup splenda and 1/4 honey.  Honey is about twice as sweet as sugar, so to obtain the same sweetness you would use 1/4 cup honey and 1/2 cup splenda.

I found with 1 cup of turbinado sugar that it was mildly sweet without being overpowering.

I doubled this recipe and it made two loaves perfectly. I used applesauce instead of oil and I used the amount of banana listed (put through blender) and then cut up an extra banana to have some chunks in it. It is very good, the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is it is a little bland. I think adding even more banana would solve that problem.

Used 3 c. over-ripe bananas, 3 tsp. vanilla, 1 c. chopped pecans, and doubled all of the other ingredients in the recipe to make 2 loaves.  I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg AND steeped 1 bag of double spice chai tea in the 1/2 c. water (which I had boiled rather than using from the tap).  I used Bob's Red Mill whole wheat pastry flour and Stash tea.  It is super moist and delicious!!  We love it!  I will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

I was famous among my friends and family for my great banana nut bread, but this one takes the cake!  I've replaced my 35 year favorite with this one, with a few tweaks, of course.  I used Agave syrup instead of honey, as it metabolizes differently, 1 c mashed banana & 1/2 c pumpkin, then added 1 tbsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp allspice  and that's it!  Absolutely the best.  I made another batch with just banana (1-1/2 c) in two 8x8 square pans and added chopped chocolate chips.  This gave me fantastic bars that I could cut to any size.  Cooking time was 40 minutes, but be careful if you  don't have an oven thermometer.

I used carob molasses instead of honey, added 1 tablespoon cinnamon, 4 medium bananas and baked in a 9x13 pan for 20-25 minutes.

Very Good! I followed one reviewer's suggestion & did half honey/brown sugar and subs applesauce for the oil. I did cheat a little & added 1/2 c choc chips. Very happy with all my changes & this recipe!

This is soooo yummy!  I too used applesauce instead of the oil. I used four mini loaf pans and they were done in 30 minutes.  I will definitely make this again.

Great healthier version of a favorite! I substituted finely ground flax for the oil, added a tsp of cinnamon and half tsp of nutmeg , and a tad more hot water to adjust for the flax substitution. Delicious.

Followed the recipe exactly but doubled for two loaves and it was terrible - rubbery texture. Don't know what I did wrong - it also tasted salty to me.

Wonderful recipe!  I doubled it, added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and a splash more of the honey.  Also used this vegan egg replacer to reduce sat fat/cholesterol and calories.  Fantastic!  http://www.ener-g.com/egg-replacer.html

I did like other people suggested and used applesauce instead of oil. It comes out great every time! And you can't even tell that it's whole wheat flour instead of AP, honey instead of sugar, and applesauce instead of oil.

This was VERY bland! I even added cinnamon:( I know it defeats the purpose of a healthier bread, but it defintely needs sugar. For a "health" bread it was okay.

This is a very hearty and healthy banana bread. I skipped the nuts and added about a half cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (the only way I'll get my husband to eat it). I followed the last review and substituted 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup honey. I also substituted the apple sauce for oil and used 3 bananas. It turned out perfectly. Next time I will add 1 tsp cinnamon and make them as muffins instead of a loaf. I prefer more of a dessert loaf.

Very impressed with this healthier alternative to banana bread.  I skipped the nuts and used applesauce for the oil.  I did cover it with foil for the last few minutes of baking as the outside was getting too brown and the inside was still a bit too wet.

This bread is excellent!!  I had some whole wheat flour and some very ripe bananas to use up so I tried this recipe.  Very moist and considering there is no sweetener apart from the honey, I think it has just the right sweetness.  I followed the recipe except I replaced the oil with apple sauce and I add pecans.  Next time I may throw in some cinnamon and raisins for added flavor, but it is good as is.  Thanks for posting :)

I love this recipe.. I have made it 3 times already. The key for me is to use 1/2 cup of apple sauce and over 2 cups of bananas. It made it most and sweet. I also added 1 cupe of honey instead of 1/2. I baked the regular version using white flour, oil and sugar and this version and my whole family loved the low fat version so much better!

A bit dry. I would add more banana the next time, but the taste was perfect. I cut the recipe in half, and made 8 muffins. I increased the banana by 50%, but I still think there should have been more. I added a pinch of nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon. I htink it would be great with applesauce too.

This is a 4 star recipe, but definately has 5 star potential.  And whoa - this is h-e-a-l-t-h-y! And I'm no stranger to flax, WW flour, applesauce for oil, etc.!  I subsituted 1T flaxseed + 3T water (rest in separate bowl for 5 min.) for 1 of the eggs and the applesauce for oil; *will add* cinnamon and 1/4-1/2 c plain yogurt to lighten the heaviness of the bread.

This was very good. The texture was just right, which was a pleasant surprise given the wheat flour, which often makes things too heavy/dense. I used Agave nectar instead of honey for diabetic concerns, and used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, but left the rest of the recipe as-is. The only change I'll add next time is to add more banana--for being banana bread, it was not very banana-y.   I baked the recipe in muffin tins. It made 18 muffins and they were done in 30-35 minutes.

This was fantastic.  I maybe would want it a little tiny bit sweeter, but as is, it is still really good. I used 1/2 honey and 1/2 brown sugar splenda for my sweetener, so maybe that is where I went wrong on the sweetness.  I also used applesauce instead of oil, and it was still moist and the texture wasn't off at all, and that is a five star accomplishment in my book any day.  Very healthy--a big slice is great for breakfast on the go! Update: for those who thought it should be more moist, I would say add more banana.  This last time, I used 5 medium-to-large bananas, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and it was the best ever!

I have to admit that I was skeptical at first. Many whole wheat recipes don't taste , well, very tasty. This one did. Now I have baked many a traditional banana breads , and this one was just as tasty and just as moist. I did try some of the other suggested changes. For example I did substitute apple sauce for the oil and half brown sugar and half honey, instead of all honey. I also added    a tsp of cinnamon and a tablespoon of flaxseed meal. I kept everything else the same and it came out great. I will no doubt make this again and again.

Yummy! I added an extra banana and used whole wheat pastry flour. Outstanding flavor and texture not at all heavy with the pastry flour. It raised  beautifully and was slightly sweet. Next time I make it I might add a bit more sweetening.

EXCELLENT!  I have been searching for healthier baking recipes and this one is near-perfect. I used Seattlecooks' suggestions (and added some of my own,) by doing the following:  for sweetener, I used 1/4 cup honey and 2 Tblsp. Splenda brand brown sugar baking blend, 1 1/4 cup (or 3 good-sized) mashed bananas, 1/4 cup nuts, and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. I will try substituting the oil for applesauce next time, but other than that, this bread was great - and I did it all using my bread machine!  It didn't even dry out (as others have stated) for the three days it actually survived in my kitchen =o).  Try this and you will not be disappointed! Thanks so much!  My husband is still raving about it a week later.

Really tasty, especially for a healthy loaf. Used apple sauce in place of the oil and added an extra banana. Very moist.

I had 3 overripe bananas and was in need of a good healthy banana bread recipe.  I was going to use whole wheat flour anyway so I decided to try this recipe.  I made a few substitutions.  I used 1/3 cup overflowing with unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, 1/4 cup Splenda and 1 Tbsp honey instead of all honey.  I added an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla and used eggbeaters instead of eggs, adding an extra 1/2 egg or so.  I added an extra half banana and subsituted 25% of the flour with soy flour to add extra protein and fiber.  I also added 1/2 tsp extra baking soda just to make sure.  I then made them in a muffin tin making 12 muffins exactly.  I may have undercooked them a little bit at just about 30 minutes, but I also had to put them in the fridge for 2.5 hours because I didnt have enough time to cook them before class.  For the health factor involved, these are amazing!  They turned out very well, I enjoy them a lot but I probably didn't mash the bananas enough first.  I eat either one of these or one of the "addictive pumpkin muffins" every morning for breakfast now with a piece of fruit.  Just take one out of the freezer and bring it to work, very simple and incredibly healthy!

I thought this was just terrific banana
bread! It was very moist and full of flavor. My husband just loved it also!
I used a heaping 1/3 cup of unsweetened applesauce in place of the vegetable oil. Instead of using 1/2 cup of honey, I used 1/4 cup of honey and 1/4 cup of splenda. I only had 3/4 cup of banana, so I added enough plain fat-free yogurt to the mashed banana to make a total of 1 cup.  I wrapped the cooled loaf in plastic wrap which seemed to help keep it fresh...even though the bread was not around for very long!  Thanks for the recipe Peggy and kudos to everyone who added their review...this really did help a lot!

OUTSTANDING!  We've been phasing out white flour from our foods, and this recipe is a definite gem.  After reading the reviews, I made a few changes: 1 1/4 cups mashed banana, heaping 1/3 cup all-natural applesauce instead of oil, and instead of honey I used 1/4 c Splenda + 1/4 cup white sugar.  After cooling on rack for 40 mins, I wrapped the loaf in plastic wrap and it stayed incredibly moist and flavorful.  Next time I'll make two loaves and freeze one.  I'll be sharing this recipe with others. Thank you Peggy!

Love that this is made with whole wheat.  Very easy, moist and delicious.  My only change was adding more than 1 cup mashed bananas because I happened to have more than the recipe called for and it still turned out great.  Thank you for sharing!

I added a dash of cinnamon and I just took it out of the oven... I'm worried it won't be sweet enough because the honey I used is raw organic honey...  Waiting to try it after it cools down! It was super easy to make and def looks and smells great!

Made this as muffins.  They were  delicious but have to give only four stars because I made some substitutions and don't think they would be quite so delicious without  the alterations. I used 1/3  of a  cup of  coconut oil. ( I love baking with this oil best light and fluffy muffins because it's not as heavy as most oils) I also used  an extra 1/2 cup of bananas.  As well as a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice added flavor but wasnt too spiced. I then baked these for 12-15  min  in a muffin pan lightly greased  with  nonstick cooking spray. Amazing! :)

This recipe was delicious! I was looking for a healthy alternative to my mom's wonderfully decedent banana bread recipe (that's totally not healthy) and I think I've found it. I have made it 3 times so far. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe indicated, then I experimented after that. I added 2 packets of maple brown sugar instant oatmeal and about a tablespoon of cinnamon to the batter and replaced the oil with applesauce. The oatmeal added a great texture to the bread, although it makes it more dense. My husband gobbles it up!

This bread is amazing! I made a few changes though: I omitted the salt and vanilla extract, substituted the oil for pureed apples and added some cinnamon and nutmeg (which added a very nice yet subtle flavour), and I absolutely loved it! My mom thought it could be a little bit sweeter, so she put some butter and honey on it, but I think it was fabulous just how it was. The bread was quite dense, so we sliced the loaf fairly thin. I also tried making them in muffin tins which worked very nicely as well. And if your looking to add more protein, try spreading a slice of the bread with all natural peanut butter and sprinkling hemp seeds on top! Thank you so much for this recipe! I have already made it a few times but boy let me tell you I'll be making it many, many more!

This is a fabulous banana bread recipe. I like that it doesn't call for too much sweetener. I used brown sugar instead of honey and omitted the nuts (I was out of both), but I'm sure it would be fabulous that way. I took the advice of others and used 3 bananas and added cinnamon. I made them into muffins so they'd cook faster. Spot on - this was very good. (I know I made a lot of adjustments, but I'd bet the recipe would be great without them too).

Very moist and tasty. 
My changes: 
1) substituted 2% plain Greek Yogurt for the oil.
2) I used about 1/4 of the nuts as a topping: I combined the, with cinnamon and light brown sugar. 
3) Made in cupcake pans.  Made15 cupcakes. Baked at 300 degrees for about 25". Used paper cupcake liners. They stuck a bit more than a typical cupcake. Perhaps I'll try a bit of Pam next time.
4) Used about 1 1/4 cups VERY ripe bananas (4 small bananas).
5) Used pecans
Definite repeater!

Wow!  This was a great bread.  I used two cups banana as was suggested by other reviewers, and 1/4 c dried cranberries.  This made a great whole wheat bread.  I wanted something easy and quick but delicious, and I felt like this was it.  This will be on my regular recipes list.

Very good and moist banana bread. I made it without the walnuts since I didn't have any on hand and I was also a 1/4 cup short of honey so I substituted the remaining 1/4 cup with agave nectar. It turned out great! Not only is it healthier due to being made with whole wheat flour and no white sugar, but it is also more filling. I will certainly be making this again!

A wonderful and healthy recipe!  I used greek yogurt instead of oil (it's a great substitute, like using applesauce), and I used half honey and half brown sugar.  This was very healthy and quite yummy (and the yogurt adds extra protein!).  I left out the nuts, and then way I have the option of adding extra honey, walnuts, chocolate chips, etc on top of a slice if I'm in the mood, or I can keep it healthy and plain for a quick breakfast.  Love it!

Always have too many bananas and can never turn down buying a big bag of overripe bananas for a buck in the clearance section of one local market.
Generally avoid anything whole wheat but figured this would be a good way to sneak it in, also been trying to incorportate coconute fat into our diet and this was a way to accomplish bott, pluse we have a glut of honey as the result of my partner's Extreme Couponing hobby.
I made a double batch last night and it was so good that I made two more loaves this morning to freeze.
Next time I'm gonna add some flax meal and whey or protein powder for nutritional punch, increase the water a but as flax meal can be pretty absorbant.

This tasted good even though I only had almond extract instead of vanilla. I found it to be a little dry, so I might modify a little in the future if I make it again.

The recipe was great!! The only thing I noticed is that it is kind of bland. I think maybe some nutmeg or cinnamon would make it even better!! This is my first attempt ever at banana nut bread and it came out pretty good! Thanks!!!

I added 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/4 t. nutmeg & 1/8 t. ginger to give it more spice.  
Also, I don't know if it's just me but, if this bread doesn't get eaten within a couple of days it started to get moist on top and smells/tastes funky.  Almost like it is fermenting... It has happened everytime.

soo good. i added just a bit of brown sugar, and along with the vanilla i added equal amounts of banana and almond extract for extra flavor and 3 ripe bananas, which was just a little over the 1 cup called for.. very moist. cooked a little longer than what was called for. i also added pecans on top for a prettier final product. happy i conquered this recipe before the holidays.

YUM!!! I have made this as a loaf multiple time and my boyfriend and I love it! I also use applesauce instead of the oil....This time making it I decided to do muffins and altered the recipe slightly. I added 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Prior to baking I made a crumb topping taken from "Banana crumb Muffins" 1/3c brown sugar, 2T flour(I used whole wheat), 1/8tsp cinnamon and 1T butter(still hard) mixed them all together then sprinkled over the top of the muffins and only cooked for about 20 minutes or till the toothpick came out clean....AMAZING!!! highly recommended! Thanks for the recipe!

Wow.  I made this recipe today into muffins and it was great!  I used 1/4 c brown sugar and 2 Tbsp honey as the sweetener.

2/3 of the muffins got nuts and 1/3 of them got chocolate chips.  Moist and delicous!

yummmmy healthy!!! I substituted 1/3 cup applesauce for the oil (like others suggested), and then I realized I didn't have any honey (oh-oh). So, I googled "replacement for honey" and discovered you can use brown sugar. I used 1/2 c for this recipe. Google it and you will get the exact subsituted amount (not as much sugar as honey). But, brown sugar is way less calories than honey, so I was happy.

Okay-okay. I admit it. I added tons of dark chocolate chips, which made it not so low-calorie, but oh-so-good!!

Huge hit with the kiddos ......seriously who needs white flour...they love the whole wheat lately and I am glad! Made one adjustment and that was to use homemade applesauce instead of oil. Perfect, smells amazing and very moist. Thanks!

Very moist and flavorful. And a fun rainy day activity with my three-year-old. I did increase the bananas to 1.5 cups based on the other reviews I read. We used dried cranberries in place of nuts. We will definitely make this again.

I feel like I just wasted a lot of time and ingredients for something that tastes like banana flavored cardboard.  I read the reviews so I did a couple modifications.  It was moist so I guess it's banana flavored wet cardboard.  I just feel like I've been duped.  Guess you can't believe everything you read.

Yummy! I just made this with my waffle iron and it is delicious!!!! I love the fact that you don't need sugar either. I did omit the nuts since kids are allergic. This will be one of my standard waffle recipes - no butter or syrup needed.

WOW - I LOVE this recipe!!!  My banana nut bread is so delicious - it's so moist, fluffy and the sweetness is just right!  Many other recipes are just too sweet that I feel pre-destined for diabetes with every bite.  It's so great that I get to use honey and whole wheat flour - much healthier!  This will be my only banana nut bread from now on.  Will also definitely try the apple sauce option, too.  Thank you so much for sharing this.  I'll recommend it to all of my friends & family.

I used this recipe as a basic formula, but followed 'seattlecooks' suggestions: heaping 1/3C unsweetened applesauce, 1/4 C Honey, with 1/4 brown sugar, added a little more banana. 
I made one batch with craisins and another I added raisins (It's what I had on hand!), without nuts.  I also only used one whole egg and one egg white.
I turned them into muffins instead of a loaf for portion control. They taste great are were a BIG hit around my house!

I've made many different banana breads, but I think this is really the best tasting and the only one I've added to my recipe box. It's very tender and light (not dense) and the honey creates a buttery undertone. I did add some extra banana to use up what I had on hand and didn't have a full 1/2 cup of honey (subbed in a small amount of brown sugar). Still --wow!

Really great recipe. My skeptical cowboy husband even loved this healthy recipe! I added a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon and about half teaspoon nutmeg. Oh, and I did 1/4C honey and 1/4C brown sugar. REALLY GOOD!!!

These are delicious and guilt free, what else can you ask for? Instead of using vegetable oil I used 1/3 cup of unsweetened applesauce for a ever more healthy version. I will definitely be making these again!

Made 2 loaves yesterday. Great recipe! I did make some substitutions. I used half honey, half palm sugar. I substituted the vege oil with coconut oil. The bread rose perfectly and taste was perfect and moist. We have already eaten one loaf!

I used half coconut oil and half canola oil.  It came out super moist.  I also added an 1/8 cup brown rice syrup to add extra sweetness after reading the reviews about lack of sweetness.  It came a little bit crumbly but delish and moist!!!

I followed this recipe exactly and am a little disappointed with the results.  I find it to be a little dry, heavy and not very sweet. I live at 6400 feet elevation and this could be the reason.      If anyone out there knows how to adjust a recipe of this type for elevation, I would love some tips. I want to continue to bake, but.......

As many others did, I completely replaced the oil with applesauce and still came out with a fluffy bread. Really great. I do like my bread sweeter, so I will add sugar, perhaps even a whole 1/2 cup extra... Otherwise it needs jam or honey on top of it. Oh and definitely add cinnamon and nutmeg.

This might sound a little odd, but the most amazing banana bread I've ever had was this recipe: right out of the oven I wrapped it in plastic wrap, then let it sit for two nights. When you eat it right out of the oven, it isn't the best because it hasn't had a chance to sit- something about this process distributes moisture throughout the loaf and makes a gooey-ness.

Fantastic! I used 1 c. whole wheat, 1 c. white and 1 c. oat flour and added some raisins.  I can't believe how good this bread is! It's not too sweet the way a lot of these types of bread are.

WOW! This is so good! The only changes I made were to omit the oil and substitute with apple sauce, and use half honey and half brown sugar. I have made this with standard whole wheat flour and with white whole wheat flour, the white wheat came out less dense, but both were amazing! Thanks for this great recipe, it's my new banana bread standard ;)

I love this recipe! It's wonderful. I did make some changes, mostly because of not having things on hand. I didn't have any oil, so I used four mashed bananas. It was too grainy and too dense the first time I made it. So the second time I used whole wheat pastry flour and added a teaspoon of baking powder. Perfect! Everyone loves them!

I LOVE this bread! However, I do make a few changes. I use applesauce instead of oil, to make the bread a bit healthier. I also always add vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. I go pretty heavy on the cinnamon as I really like the flavor. I make this regularly for myself and everyone I've ever made it for requests the recipe. It's a very satisfying and dense bread, perfect with a cup of coffee for breakfast in the morning! Highly recommended!

Since I was out of honey I replaced it with maple syrup.  I used half applesauce & half canola oil hoping it would make them a bit more moist (per other users suggestions.)  I had left over crumb topping from another recipe so I used that on top.  These were great muffins although they weren't dry, they weren't completely moist either.   Kids & husband loved them!

I wasn't thrilled with this recipe. It turned out too gooey and heavy. I might use more bananas next time and add chocolate chips.

Love, love, love this recipe!   My only change was to use applesauce instead of oil.  I also threw in 1/2 cup of dried cranberries.  I might try some other dried fruits too, but always walnuts!

I absolutely LOVED this bread. I followed the other users and completely subbed in unsweetened Mott's Natural applesauce (1/2 cp) in place of the vegetable oil and added about a tsp. of Ground Cinnamon. I also used 2 cups of bananas. Everything else I left as is and followed the instructions. The bread came out moist, delicious, and left the house smelling great! The single loaf I had made was gone within a day bc my stepdad loved it so much and so did my mom. I'm making a couple more today!

Ok, so here it is. Overall flavor was bland. Needs some cinnamon, nutmeg or cloves. Could use more honey, or better yet throw in a bit of sugar because it wasn't very sweet. I'll probably add some banana extract or more bananas because it wasn't very flavorful either. The texture on the inside was good, not too dry or too moist. It held up well and didn't crumble when cutting. It raised nicely, so the amount of soda it calls for seems about right. This bread has potential and I'll probably give it another try with my added modifications though.

I used 2 frozen bananas, 1/4cup of purred carrots, and one finely shredded zucchini. Also I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added dried spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger). I baked it in muffin cups for 25mins. IT WAS AWESOME! Next time I will try baking it for a few minutes less, maybe 20-22mins.

Remember to prep ALL the ingredients before you start to mix!  I've made this exactly as the recipe says, and it is good.  I've made it twice more with some modifications, and it is great!  What I do: increase bananas to 1.5c, add 1/4t each cinnamon & nutmeg, and replace 1/4c of the honey with about 3T brown sugar.  Also, following a tip from another reviewer (can't find who now), I dust the greased pan and top of loaf with a mix of 1:12 cinnamon:sugar - gives it a nice crispy crust!

OH MY! This is soooo good! I actually divided into 12 muffins cups and they came out perfect.  I only used a TBSP of canola oil and replaced the rest of the oil w/ Applesauce.   5 stars!!

excellent and healthy too!  As others recommended I used applesauce and honey instead of oil and used wheat flour instead of white.  The raisins and nuts were a nice addition.  My whole family enjoyed this, definately a keeper.

I made this recipe into 16 muffins, they turned out really good..I didn't have honey on hand so used a bit of brown sugar and added flax seeds for even more health benefits..I added a few mini chocolate chips to half of the batch and the kids loved them..I did use WW pastry flour so they are nice and light....great recipe, will definately make again.

Excellent!  I've made this once so far with a few changes and will experiment more.  Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, some fresh ground nutmeg, switched 1/4 cp cornmeal for 1/4 cp ww flour to add some more texture, did 2 Tbs. olive oil and the rest apple sauce for the veg oil, and of course added an extra banana on top of the 1 cup called for.  The result was the prettiest (should have taken a picture) quick bread I've ever made and high up there in the ranks of the best banana breads I've ever had.  I'm always looking for low fat, whole grain, non-dairy baked goods and I'm very happy with this one.  I'll try it again with warm soy milk for the water, more spices, even less oil (0-1 Tbs. maybe), and another 5 minutes or so on the cooking timer.  This one will become a staple after I've tweeked it a bit.  A highly recommended and customizable recipe.

This was a very healthy snack alternative and easy to make!  I used homemade applesauce and it really added some flavor. However, I would add about a cup and half of bananas next time.  Both my husband and I really couldn't taste the banana flavor.

This is great for whole wheat banana bread!  Super healthy, I like others altered the recipe a bit. Used a 1/2 C. of cinnamon applesauce, added an extra banana (mine were small bananas), and then used 1/4 C. Splenda,  1/8 C honey, and 1/8 C brown sugar. I think the extra applesauce and banana made the bread more moist. It rose perfectly and tastes great!

This bread came out very moist and delicious. I had to make a couple of changes because of a lack of ingredients. I used butter instead of vegetable oil, a combination of cashews and chocolate covered sunflower seeds instead of walnuts, and 1/4 cup each of honey and brown sugar. I also covered the bread with foil for the last 20 minutes of bake time. 55 minutes was perfect.

This was very good.  I made it as listed, but I added about 3/4 c mini chocolate chips and an extra 1/c cup bananas. Came out very very moist.  So moist that it falls apart when I cut it.  I had to bake it for about 70 minutes and it came out nice and brown.  (baked it in a glass dish at 325). Kids love it.  Will be making it again. I think next time I will make it with applesauce to make it even more healthier.

This is the moistest, lightest, fluffiest, BEST banana bread I've ever had! My cooking time was slightly longer, 1 hr 15 min, and I covered it with foil during the last 15 min to keep it from burning. It came out perfectly!

This has a fine, tender texture and nice flavor with just the right amount of sweetness. I used  1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup brown sugar since honey is quite expensive. It was just as good after a night in the fridge. The next time I make it, I intend to add raisins. I will definitely make this again

A good and healthy bread. My bananas were getting over ripe again and I did not want to make the same ol unhealthy banana breads. I was very glad to come across this very healthy recipe. And I was surprised at how soft the bread turned out. Thanks for sharing this healthy recipe!

I loved the recipe!  It smelled SO wonderful putting it together and baking it.  However I did make it with the suggested cinnamon, milk instead of water, and I substitutted a handful of chocolate chips.  I also baked it in muffin tins, with the recipe yielding 12 full regular sized muffins.  It took about 30 mins to bake in the muffin tins (Set your timer at 25 and start checking though!)

A GREAT recipe!  If you have a sweet tooth, the chocie chips will pull the whole thing together.

Knowing that it was made with all whole wheat flour and sweetened with honey, I did not have high expectations.  I was surprised by how moist and good it was.  After a couple of days, it definitely began to dry out and get a different texture, but most of it was already gone.  Definitely the best 'healthy' loaf I've baked.

Subbed unsweetened applesauce for oil, 1/2 splenda, 1/2 white sugar.  10 times more delicious if you wait the next day.

Yummy!  I've made this several times.  I always use unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil and it's great.  This is my go to banana bread!

Very good. I made this for a diabetic, so I omitted the honey and used 1/4 cup Splenda instead like another reviewer mentioned. Very delicious. Bread has a dark appearance; I am guessing this is due to the whole weat flour versus all-purpose.

Thank you. YUMMMMY !!!

This was DELICIOUS! I took the advice of previous reviewers & used 1/4 cup sugar free honey & 1/4 cup Splenda in place of the 1/2 cup honey. Instead of the oil I used unsweetened cinnamon applesauce instead. Then I used 1 1/2 tsp vanilla because I love vanilla! Then I added 2 tsp of cinnamon. the taste was WONDERFUL! I also am trying to use less white flour in my recipes & this fit the bill perfectly. Thanks so much for the recipe & to the other reviewers for their input.

I substituted applesauce for the oil and added just one tbl spn of oil.  They turned out moister than I expected.  This recipe is good for honey lovers.

This is a great recipe -very easy and very yummy. You don't really know that it is whole wheat either. The bread is not too sweet and not too banana-ery. It has a bit of a cakey texture, but that seems to be imorving with time. Per one reviewer's suggestion,  tried it with 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup Splenda and it turned out great. I will make this again for sure!

Yumminess! I love the dense, moist texture of this bread. It has just the right amount of sweetness and is also nutritious, so this recipe, which I followed exactly, definitely floats my boat.

This is a great recipe!!  Even with making some substitutions (applesauce instead of oil and 1/4 c Splenda and 1/4 c honey instead of the full amount of honey) it came out really good.  Very flavorful and moist.  Even my 3-year old liked it! :-)

Very good!  I put in choclate chips and used applesauce instead of oil.  Still very moist and the choclate provides a nice sweet taste.

excellent recipe, and I'm a tough critic to please.  I used whole wheat pastry flour, which made it extra moist, added more banana, and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top of 4 mini loaves.  It baked in about 35 mins.

This recipe was wonderful! Very moist and rich.I substituted applesauce for the oil and left out the nuts. I also added 3/4 cup of dark chocolate chips. We all loved it. It made more of a dessert bread.

This recipe is a keeper!  I used applesauce instead of oil and it was wonderfully moist.  I sliced it up and made it into french toast for breakfast.  The rest of the loaf didn't make it to night fall!  Thanks, Peggy!

I made this recipe following the directions except I substituted molasses for the honey and used a little more mashed banana and also used 1/2 tsp baking powder so it would be lighter.  It was fantastic!  Usually my banana bread comes out too dense and heavy.  This was light in texture and dark in color because of the molasses.  Good recipe!

I have tried the recipe and it turned out great!
I replaced the walnuts with dried blueberries and some sunflower seeds. The bread is moist and yummy!
I am wondering if I could replace eggs with other ingredient?
I have friends who are vegan and allergy to eggs.

This is my Favorite banana bread recipe! I use whole wheat pastry flour and local honey. Today I turned it into zucchini bread by using 1 cup of shredded zucchini from garden instead of the banana & added a dash of cardamom & cinnamon, it's in the oven now & looks great & smells great

This is our new favorite banana bread.  I took the advise and replaced the oil with applesauce.  The bread turned out very moist. I made two loaves - one with raisins (for my husband) and one with dark chocolate chips for the rest of the family!  Very healthy and so very, very good!!!!

Delicious! I replaced the oil with applesauce, the nuts with chocolate chips and I used organic honey.
I put the batter in mini muffin tins.
Perfectly bite sized!

I've made this several times and love it!  Like others, I use unsweetened applesauce to replace the oil. I've found using only 1/3 cup leaves it a little dry, so I've doubled it to 2/3 cups and it's very moist.  I've also thrown in 1 cup of coconut when I've had some left over and it was delicious!

I followed the recipe "as is" and used 3 medium sized bananas.  I did NOT sub for applesauce because everyone in my family hates it when I do that (they do not like the consistency).  This bread is delicious!  It is moist, flavorful, and so quick and easy to prepare.  Add a few spices to your liking (ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, etc.) and you will have found your favorite healthy banana bread recipe!

Great Recipe but I have found that cooking is to long specialy in a pinch so I use 9 inch cake pan and cut the time in half. You still have to check with a tooth pick if done....I took the water away and added half cup of OJ.

I made this recipe.  I substituted 1/4c Agave and 1/4c of  Coconut Crystals (with water added to make up for liquid) and I used half coconut oil and half apple sauce instead of the oil.  It was very tasty and made with all natural healthy ingredients.

Great recipe! Like other reviewers, I replaced the oil with applesauce and increased the amount of bananas to 1 1/2c. to make it more moist. Got rave reviews from coworkers!

I used half honey and half brown sugar. It would've tasted sweeter with all honey, but I didn't want to waste honey on a recipe I wasn't sure I'd like. It turns out we did like it! It IS nice and moist. Some of the pictures show a dry bread, but those are overbaked loaves. I made 12 muffins, 18 minutes @ 350 degrees. Thanks for sharing!

Yum!! I for some reason have issues making banana bread that doesn't collapse after taking it out of the oven, and this one successfully stayed risen for me. My boyfriend and I have been trying to avoid processed sugar, so having honey as the sweetener was perfect! I (like others ) added unsweetened appleasuce instead of oil, didn't even bother with mixing the baking soda in water, just straight up added 3 bananas (as opposed to 1 cup), and added an extra 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour. And because it just couldn't be avoided, added mini choc. chips :) great healthy option for banana bread. Thank you!!!

I very much like the taste of this bread, I am just not sure if I did something incorrectly because even after 60 minutes it was really saucy and unbaked at the top. So I turned up the heat a little and put it back in. Great then.

Awesome bread. Made with 1/4 oil and 1/4 unsweetened applesauce. I added some cinnamon and a pinch or two of sugar for the top. So so so delicious. My toddler, one year old and husband loved it too.

EXCELLENT!!!!! I substituted agave for honey and it worked great!!! I might do 1/4 agave next time because it was quite sweet (no problem for me but I better if the kids have less sweets). It was moist, nutty and it looked amazing! fool proof! :-)

Oh my! I can not stop eating this fabulous bread! It's so addicting. Like the others that have made this receipe I swapped the oil and replaced it with applesauce. For a really treat smear slices with peanut butter or nutella. So yummy! This is a keeper.

Been in search of a whole wheat no refined sugar recipe that actually tasted good...my search is over. I only changed out the oil to fit my eating plan. Used coconut oil, added a tsp cinnamon, used 3 very ripe bananas, and used white whole wheat flour. Very good and plan to make often.

This is delicious!  I followed the recipe, except I (like many others) substituted 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce for the 1/3 cup vegetable oil.  I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and left out the nuts.  It's moist and tastes great!  My 8-year-old loves it, and that's saying something.  He has a sweet tooth and is used to the sugar-loaded, white-flour banana bread I usually make (up until now!).

This banana bread recipe is wonderful.  I added a touch of cinnamon, brown sugar, and nutmeg to the batter.  Also, I made a topping of brown sugar, walnuts, and cinnamon for the top of the bread.  It gave it a nice crunchy topping.  I made 2 in one weekend it was so good.  One for home, and one for my office!

Love the fact that this recipe uses whole wheat flour and that you can substitute applesauce for the oil.  I thought it tasted great using the applesauce.  I brought some over for my mom and brother and they loved it too!  I'm going to try and freeze the rest and warm it up for breakfast each morning.  Also you can use finely chopped walnuts instead of just chopped if you typically don't care for the texture of nuts in bread like I do.

I used four regular size bananas and did not measure in cups.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and iti was excellent.  There is no taste difference in this recipe and traditional banana bread, so it is a nice way to be healthier, using whole wheat.  It is moist and good.  I will make this again.

Really good!  Just gave seconds to the neighborhood kids and over heard one of them say that they could eat it all day.  The only thing I changed was that I substituted agave nectar syrup for the honey.  (1/2 cup of agave).  Soooooo moist and delicious!

I joined allrecipes.com JUST to leave a positive comment on this banana bread. I love it. I have made it every single week since I first found the recipe, months ago, and eat it for a bedtime snack. I use applesauce instead of oil, 1/2 cup honey, 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 cups of banana, add cinnamon, 1/2 cup pecans and at LEAST 1/2 cup raisins. Also add more finely chopped pecans to the top before I bake. It is HEAVENLY and very healthy. For those that are not liking the taste, I recommend changing to a different brand of what flour. I use King Arthur brand. If you want to experience something MORE than heavenly, heat up a slice and add a dollop of vanilla ice cream. Not quite as healthy that way but mmm, mmm good.

I made a double batch...used less honey, because I added chocolate chips!  I also substituted half coconut oil and half applesauce for vegetable oil.  I added some multigrain flour to the whole wheat flour.  I was very happy with the results!

Moist enough, but it has that whole wheat saw dust texture to me, which puts me off. Maybe raisins would help. The outer crust got very dark -- almost seems burned. If I make this again, I'll use only half WW flour.

I loved this recipe. It was quick and easy and a great snack for the kids. I made muffins for portion control; one muffin is hearty enough to satisfy you.

Very moist! I used grapeseed oil instead &  1/2 c agave nectar(instead of honey). I used 1/2 pecans & 1/2 walnuts. I sprinkled in some cinnamon. Next time I will add a little more cinnamon & maybe some nutmeg to give it a little more zip.

Ever since I found this healthy recipe, I have never gone back to old recipes!  It is the PERFECT, old fashioned and hearty banana bread!  For extra flavor and added health benefits, I add nutmeg and cinnamon and more walnuts........mmmmmmmm :)

Great recipe! I added an extra banana, used applesauce to sub for the oil, added some semi-sweet choc. chips, and did include the walnuts (I just chopped them up really small). It did take longer to cook than suggested, but turned out great. Excellent flavor!

Subbed applesauce for oil like a lot of people.  Also, rice milk for water and peanuts for walnuts.  Used mostly whole wheat flour, but threw a little white flour in there too.  Used less honey and sprinkled in a little white sugar.  It came out good.  Probably could have used more honey, or agave to add a little more sweetness.  But I rather liked it.  And it tasted twice as good the next day, which I'm gonna keep in mind for next time.

I love that this is whole wheat.  I also made a couple of changes.  I substituted applesauce for the oil and instead of nuts (which my kids don't like) I put in drk chocolate chunks or chipits.  I also pre mixed it and baked it in my bread maker on the Quick bread cycle.  BIG hit with everyone.

Very Yummy! I used 1/2 cup applesaue instead of oil to make it healthier, I had to cook mine about 10 minutes longer than your cooking time was, I think that was just because of my oven.I have tried a load of other recipes for banana bread none of which were ever any good! But this recipes is great!

Made this recipe tonight - it was delicious. I used pecans instead of walnuts, and when the bread had 10 minutes left to bake, I spread creamed honey on top and then sprinkled brown sugar & cinnamon over it. Yummmmm!

Bread is more dense and less cake-like than other recipes.  This is a good bread but might need a some spices.  I did have to eliminate the nuts due to an allergy but otherwise followed it to the T.  Perhaps replace nuts with raisins.  Needed to be baked about 63 min total.

What a great recipe! I doubled the batch, toasted the walnuts, used applesauce instead of oil and stirred chocolate chips into half the batter.  I used 2 8x8 inch pans instead of the loaf pans and baked at 350 for about 50 minutes. Both the standard and choc-chip versions are so moist and yummy... and I love the whole-grain goodness.

This was amazing!  I baked it this morning for work and my coworkers loved it.  I would suggest putting the pan higher up in the oven and covering it with foil to make sure it doesn't burn.  The bottom of my loaf was a little burnt before the inside was done.  I'm going to try it again tonight, replacing the oil with applesauce and adding some spices.

This was very moist banan bread. Not too dense and not cakey. It was the perfect consistency...BUT I needed MORE banana flavor.  This had more of a hint for me than true banana flavor.  Made 2 minor subs: for honey used 1/4 cup agave nectar and 1/4 cup brown sugar and instead of walnuts, added chocolate chips.  Fantasic bread, just wanted more banana for me.

I made this banana bread, but had to sub. granulated sugar for the honey because I don't have any honey on hand. I really like the flavor of the bread but it is a little dry -- likely due to my use of sugar instead of honey.

I followed the suggestions of others - I replaced the oil with 1/3 heaping cup of applesauce,  used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 1/4 cup mashed RIPE bananas, 1/4 cup nuts, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and I added some pumpkin pie spice. My loaf came out moist, low-fat,  and flavorful!

This bread is AMAZING and HEALTHY! I used real butter instead of vegetable oil because vegetable oil is not healthy. Make sure your bananas are really ripe. I will make this over and over! I also substituted the bananas for peaches and made peach muffins - they too are quite tasty.

I honestly made this because I had about 5 ripe bananas I didn't want to throw away.  However, after it was done and I took one bite into it, I vowed never to use another banana nut bread recipe other than this one again.  It was simply delicious, moist, perfectly sweetened and to top it all, healthy!  Thank you for sharing this with us :-)

This isn't your typical banana bread because it is not super sweet.  It's more like a regular bread with a little sweetness.  But I liked it.  I followed the recipe exactly and got great results.  Thanks!  I love that it uses whole wheat!

I made this into a vegan banana nut bread by using 1/2 c brown sugar instead of honey and egg substitute in place of eggs.  I also used applesauce instead of oil and 1 1/2 c of bananas.  It turned out moist and wonderful!!!  I think next time I'm going to add some cinnamon.

I am generally intimidated by baking, but I had a bunch of bananas that needed to be used or tossed.  I didn't have the heart to throw them out without putting in a good-faith effort into trying to use them.    This recipe was a piece of cake (or bread, I should say).  (Ugh, crazy pun time!  I can’t help myself.)  It was easy to make, and it tasted great.  The honey and bananas provided the right amount of sweetness.  The bread came out light and airy.  I actually decided to make a double batch (since I figured it was going to be the only time I’ll ever bake).  I took a risk and put the entire double mixture into a deeper loaf pan.  I had to adjust to time and temp, but it turned out great.  I baked at 325 for the first hour, then I turned it down to 300 and baked for another 20 minutes.  I’m so proud of myself and my banana bread (via this recipe).  I will be making it again.

This is delicious. I doubled recipe to be able to freeze some. Used applesauce instead of the oil. 1/2 honey and substituted brown sugar for the other 1/2 of the honey. Used 3 eggs for my double recipe, added finely chopped carrots and some finely chopped dark chocolate. Very moist and will make again.

this is so delicious!!  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, instead of all honey.  I added a VERY generous teaspoon of vanilla extract, and the two large bananas I mashed up were probably more than a cup. I will definitely make this anytime I have scary looking bananas!!

Best banana bread ever!  I probably will never use another recipe again.  Totally healthy, moist, bakes perfectly, delicious.  OH, one thing, I replaced the oil with apple sauce, and it's perfectly wonderful.  (for a few less calories.) You won't go wrong if you bake this bread.

This was so dense and I even added a little extra banana.  I guess part of it is I don't really like using whole wheat flour but this was a lead brick.  It didn't seem to rise at all!  I must have done something wrong but I recheck recipe and I did everything exactly.  Huh?!   :(

Made this today and it was quite good. It was a tiny bit dry , but putting butter on it helps. Overall a great recipe and very healthy as well :)

A very good, moist basic banana nut bread that I will now use instead of my old recipe.

I subsituted sunflower oil for the vegetable oil, but other than that I followed the recipe.  It turned out so good!

Great recipe. I used half oil, half pureed apples (versus applesauce - pureed apples work better). I added a little nutmeg and cinnamon. I used 3 entire medium bananas. 55 minutes at 325 still left a slightly gooey top middle part, but the edges were well done. So I don't know how to fix that. I didn't have any vanilla so I skipped that. No nuts either - chocolate chips instead! Organic, grain sweetened choc chips.

This was only okay.  I love the richness whole wheat flour adds to banana bread, but I thought this recipe lacked flavor.  It was nice and moist and had good texture, but I think next time I'll increase the bananas and add some cinnamon or other spices.

This bread is a great. I seldom have luck with baking anything, and this one turns out delicious every time. I substitute sugar-free applesauce for the oil and add flax seed and maple flavoring.

The honey gives a rich flavor & color. I substituted 2 & 1/4 cups whole wheat pastry flour. I only had 2 bananas so I added a ripe plum (whirred with hand held blender). I also added some cinnamon & nutmeg and left out the walnuts. I had my doubts about how it was going to cook up because the batter was very liquidy but it came out wonderful. I baked it for 1 hour & 10 minutes and used cake tester.I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! But..changed from the original recipe. Substituted 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips for the walnuts; used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup honey; ~4 bananas. Baked for 25 minutes in a 9X13 pan and it was fantastic! Made about 24 whole wheat chocolate banana bread squares. Healthy and yummy. Definitely will make again. **I recommend mashing the bananas on a plate with a fork and then mixing them in; it makes it much easier.

These are so delicious. I've made them several times now. My family likes this a little sweeter so I add a little more vanilla, and I use half honey and half brown sugar. I make this as muffins instead of the bread as it is easier for my kids. This will be a staple recipe in our home.

Made this last night and I think its great. I did substitute applesauce for the oil but only had 2 ripe bananas. After it was already in I realized that I put in too much honey but you can't tell. I will definitely make more.

My three kids all ate it so that earns a great review in itself! I added 1/2 cup choc chips instead of walnuts and used 1/3 cup almond meal with 1/3 less whole wheat flour. Added cinnamon and used applesauce instead of oil.

wow - i don't know what kind of reduced fat banana bread people have had in the past but this was completely tasteless. i followed the suggestions with the honey, brown sugar and apple sauce for oil and they turned out horribly. i put them in muffin cups for indi servings and half of the muffin was left in the cup - which wasn't that disappointing, given the taste

I have been looking for a really good whole wheat banana bread recipe for a long time and this is it. I live at very high altitude so I used 8 onces of whole wheat pastry flour measured on a kitchen scale, and I omitted the nuts so I could give some to my baby. It still turned out great. THANKS!

While this does not compare to my old family recipe - lots of white sugar, white flour, oil - this is an amazing banana bread, especially considering how healthy it is. It is easy to add other flowers (I subbed a little flax meal, soy flour, and protein powder with good results.) I did not have any nuts, so left them out - but next time I would likely add some raisins, cranberries, and/or chopped up apple. Could use a little texture/extra sweetness. I will be making this again.

I subbed 1/3 cup flax seed meal for 1 half of the oil and a 1/2 cup of currents for fun. I baked it in mini loaf pans. Absolutely wonderful, and great to give away to guests.

Very good! I use a couple of tsp of cocoa powder as well as a few handfuls of choc chips. I cook it in my breadmaker and it cooks well. I knead it for 7 mins, throw in the choc chip after it's been mixing for a few mins, cook it for an hr and ten mins in the breadmaker.   I also add a bit of reg sugar- not sure how much, i kind of just dump a bit in (a tbsp maybe?)

This was really good bread! I picked it b/c I didn't have any butter on hand. I did end up using white flour, though, b/c I didn't have any wheat. I'm sure it would have been even more delicious w/the WW flour as the honey gives it a great flavor. Thanks!

This is a great "low fat" recipe that really tastes great.  I changed the oil to apple sauce to make a much more healthier version and doubled the banana portion.  It was really moist and I will make it many more times in the future.

I loved this bread! I used apple sauce in place of the oil, and I didn't have any nuts so I didn't use nuts. I also used 3 large bananas (a little more than it called for), and I added a little spice. It is so moist and delicious! This will be a regular item in my kitchen!

I first made this recipe without making any changes, it came out a bit dry and bland. I decided to add 1/2 tsp cinnamon, use 1/2 cup brown sugar, and use applesauce instead of oil. The second loaf came out moister and sweeter I know that the brown sugar makes it a bit less healthy but taste is also important. This was a great starter recipe. People can add their own personal touches to the recipe with out destroying it, and for that I think it is a great recipe. Don't be scared to add chocolate chips, nutmeg, raisins, etc to make this your own unique creation

I made these into muffins since they are easier to grab and go. Cooking time was about 30-35 minutes.  This was the first time I substituted apple sauce for oil and I'm glad I did because you can't tell the difference except perhaps more flavor! I also added a cup of nuts instead of a half cup, substituted milk for the water, and used whole wheat pastry flour instead of whole wheat flour. I will definately make these again. Just right for our tastes.

I did something unique and followed this recipe EXACTLY AS DIRECTED!  (So this review is actually for the recipe not a variation)  Diggin' the whole whole wheat thing and I love honey as a sweetener.  It rose nicely and had great texture, but it lacked in flavor.  Without the walnuts it would have been too bland.  The techniques were great though, I will definitely bring them over to some other recipes.  Not bad, but not stellar.

I made a few additions to this recipe, but nothing totally mind blowing.  I added a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar.  This bread is amazing, and the whole wheat haters I know couldn't even tell it was there.  Another great recipe from allrecipes, I love this place!  Thanks for sharing.

The recipe was great, however the baking directions were not accurate based on my pan size.  I have an 8.5" x 5.5" pan, and the first time I made the bread I had to bake it for an extra 30-40 minutes- the middle took forever to cook through, but that made the edges and sides overdone.  The next time I made it I put the batter in two of these same size pans and still had to cook the bread an extra 20 minutes.

I can't say enough good about this recipe. I had to re-write my review! The flavor is absolutely perfect and you can hardly tell its whole wheat. A recipe like this makes it easy to get away from white flour and white sugar. The loaf is lucky to last 2 days in my house.

I liked this fine, but did not taste the banana as much as I have in other recipes, given that they were super ripe (peel fell apart as I pulled it).  I meant to use baking powder instead soda, per some of the other reviews, but I forgot, and it still seemed fine to me.  Next time, I would add some flax meal to boost the fiber.

This recipe is so moist. I only substituted applesauce for the oil to make it healthier. I have never baked entirely with whole wheat flour, so I was nervous. But this is so yummy, my kids and hubby loved it.

This was some top notch stuff. Didn't have any nuts, so I threw in an extra banana, and replaced applesauce for the oil (health junky). This is SO moist and so good. Next time, however, I'll be adding some more nutmeg.

Loved this recipe! since one person said it was a little dry, I increased the oil by a couple of tablespoonfuls. Also increased the honey by about that much. I added about a quarter cup of wheat germ. And my favorite part--I added 1/2 cup of craisins (dried cranberries)! Delicious!!

This is a great recipe! I have to make a double batch because my husband loves it so much. I use a mixture of flours (oat, unbleached, spelt, etc.) and leave out the nuts. I also follow the suggestion of another user to use two tablespoons of oil and replace the rest of the oil with (unsweetened) applesauce. I love that there is no refined sugar in this recipe!

Very simple recipe. Easy to make, easy to eat! 
Don't expect complex or robust flavors, just simple goodness. 
I'd make this again for an "everyday" recipe but I'm still searching for something a little more depth to serve company.
Maybe I'll add some cinnamon next time.

This was fantastic!  I love recipes that use wheat flour.  I baked my bread only 52 minutes, and it was perfect.  I also left off the walnuts (just a personal preference).  The 2nd time I made this, I used more bananas (3 medium), per another reviewer - was super moist!  Thanks for the recipe, as well as the tip about freezing the bananas!

I've made banana muffins from this recipe several times, and they always turn out beautifully.  I omitted the nuts and added chocolate chips instead.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour because I wanted a lighter, more "cake-like" texture for the muffins.  The flavor of the banana isn't very intense, but it's still very tasty.  I tried adding a little cinnamon to my second batch, with helped to cure the blandness that one reviewer mentioned.  Overall, this is the best (and easiest) "healthy" banana bread/muffin recipe I've found so far.

This was good bread using all whole wheat flour. Following other suggestions, I used 1/4 honey and 1/4 brown sugar as sweetener. I also used egg substitute instead of eggs and added cinnamon and a full cup of pecans. I didn't have any applesauce this time, but I will definitely use it next time. The bread is too oily for my taste made as is, and I think the applesauce would have enhanced the flavor a bit. It was lacking on spices, next time I'll add even more cinnamon and some nutmeg. Overall pretty good though, did take longer to cook, about 70 minutes for me.

This is an EASY recipe.  I like to vary it by using Agave nectar instead of honey.  I also add flax seeds and sometimes cocoa powder.  It makes a great energy bread.  I have made this over two dozen times.  The latest modification is I an equal ratio of pumpkin puree and bananas to reduce sugar.  We love it!

We love this!  I took some reviewers advice and substituted applesauce for the oil, and added extra banana.  I also threw in a dash of cinnamon.  It is moist and flavorful!  Warmed in the microwave with some margarine or cream cheese, it's the best!  What a great, healthy treat for my family!

5 Stars all the way - but I also made a few modifications:
I used 1/2 of the Oil and Subbed No-Sugar Applesauce for the rest.
I also added about a teaspoon of Cinnamon, and a couple dashes of Pumpkin Pie Spice.
Lastly I also added about 1/4 Cup of Semisweet Chocolate Chips.
Talk about GOOD!
I love this recipe because its made entirely of whole wheat flour - which I always try to eat.
I used Canola Oil instead of "Vegetable Oil" for the health benefit as well.
I'll be making this one again!

this turned out pretty good considering it was whole wheat, but still not fabulous enough to make twice.  I substituted chocolate chips for the nuts due to a nut allergy in the family.

I made this bread today and it turned out great it is moist and fluffy.  I used King Arthur whole wheat flour  with the soda added to the flour and   milk instead of water and used  half honey and sugar and    used bananas that I had frozen and thawed to room temperature. I baked it in a glass pan for 1 hr 20 minutes at 325.  It didn't burn like others have talked about.

I made this for my family and it is absolutely wonderful.  What I love is it's not high in calories for a dessert, and it has all the stuff that's good for you in it.  This is so good that it has soured me on store/starbucks/restaurant banana breads.

Delicious- both me and my husband loved it! The only change I made was I substituted dark agave nectar for the honey (i'm insulin resistant and agave nectar is a lower GI than honey) and it came out really delicious, moist and sweet. Thank you for the great recipe and I will definately be making this again.

This is wonderful HEALTHY banana bread you won't regret making or serving to your family.  I've tried my own variations, but this one takes the cake...ur...bread!  I substituted pecans for walnuts--not a walnut fan.  Very, very good and very, very easy.

I thought this bread was wonderful.  It was exceptionally moist (especially for a wheat bread).  For people who aren't used to wheat products, they do have a distinct flavor.  But try it, wheat is wonderful for you...so is this bread!

I'll never make another banana bread recipe (and we've made a bunch!).  We had about 5 bananas to use, so I doubled the recipe.  Used half oil and half unsweetened applesauce.  Used 1/2 c honey and then 1/3 c. dark brown sugar (these are the doubled proportions).  Subbed chocolate chips for walnuts.

Fantastic!  A great treat without much guilt.  :)  So glad to have found this recipe.

I used sugar free instead of honey,so it suited my diabetic husband too. Then I found other reviewers had already thought of this!

Call me chicken I guess.  I used 1 c. whole wheat and 1 c. white flour.  I also substituted brown sugar for honey, oatmeal for flax, and chocolate chips for nuts only because I didn't have any of these ingredients on hand.  But the outcome was delicious.  Next time, I'll take it out of the oven after 50 minutes.  The loaf was a little dark.

I really like this bread, but my husband hates it.  "This is NOT your usual recipe, is it?", he asked.  Granted, it doesn't taste like regular (and unhealthful) banana bread, but I like the grainy testure of whole wheat.  I will make it again, but I'll probably have to eat it all by myself.  Hopefully, it will freeze well.  Thanks!

I made this recipe twice. The first time, I used under ripe bananas and the flavor was very subtle. I liked it, but my family said it didn't taste like anything. The texture and consistency are great. The second time I made it, I used more ripened bananas and the flavor was definitely more pronounced and it was delicious. It was gone the day after it was made. This is a healthy keeper!

Excellent recipe!!  Substituded splenda for half of the honey and couldn't taste a difference and used pecans because I don't care for walnuts.  Moist, good flavor, not overly sweet.

This is a great recipe. I make it often. It has such a wonderful flavor and excellent texture. I love a nice warm piece of this bread and a hot cup of coffe for a wonderful homemade treat. This is a true keeper and a pass-it on recipe.

The first time I made this banana nut bread, I substituted unsweetened apple sauce for the oil and egg substitute for the two eggs. I also used 1/4 cup of honey and 1/4 cup of Splenda. The bread was delicious and extremely moist! I am very pleased with the taste and texture. My mom, who is always hesitant to try my healthier cooking, thought it tasted great!

This is one of those breads that tastes pretty good fresh out of the oven, but not so much when eaten later.  It's tasty, but not something I'd crave.

mine turned out a bit dry, and i used the oil rather than the apple sauce, but it was still very tasty!  i might add more banana to moisten it up next time.  (the batter is some of the best i've tasted *grin*)

I used melted coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, reduced the honey to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of applesauce. I divided the mixture into silicone muffin liners and baked for 25 minutes at 350 F. My kids love them. :)

I made it exactly like the recipe and directions as written, and baked for exactly 60 minutes. It was way too dry. It also wasn’t even that it wasn’t sweet enough; it wasn’t sweet at all. And my bananas were very sweet.

Made exactly per directions, sans nuts. Very surprised at the rise on it. The most light and well-textured banana bread I've ever had. Not surgary sweet, just sweet enough, great flavor.

Followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. Not too sweet, and you can't tell it's made with whole wheat flour! I only had just under a cup of mashed bananas, but that didn't really affect the flavour too much. Next time I will try adding an extra banana :)

Found I didn't have baking soda so used baking powder and didn't add the extra 1/4 c of water - and I should've!  Loved the taste, but it was too heavy because of no water!  I cooked it in a crockpot, and that worked well - I will definitely correct the water next time, because I will make again - I enjoy whole wheat flour in breads, so thanks for the recipe!

Yummy! Fantastic recipe, made with honey instead of sugar and whole wheat flour instead of processed white flour. Besides being very moist and tasty, it's pretty healthy!

Used coconut oil instead of veg oil, milk instead of water, some oat flour plus whole wheat. Added chocolate chips. Was fabulous. Will definitely make again and again.

Used this recipe to make Banana blueberry Muffins. I just left out the nuts, added about a cup of blueberries, and baked for 25 minutes at 325 in a muffin tin. (Makes 12)

Used a half mashed banana for each egg to make it dairy-free. Doubled the nuts and added a splash of almond extract. Best bread I've made to date!

This is a great recipe for whole wheat banana bread! I substituted another banana for the two eggs, and added a couple of tablespoons of white sugar. After pouring the batter in your pan, sprinkle a generous amount of brown sugar on top of the loaf before you bake it! This makes the top extra sweet and crunchy. Delicious and nutritious! Love it! I've made it twice so far but I have a feeling it's going to become a regular, memorized recipe!

Awesome recipe!! Just a few changes to make it more moist & flavorful.. I used 1/2 cup olive oil and 1/2 cup honey to 1 cup whole wheat flour. I also added cinnamon to pep up the flavor. Boy... was it not amazing!! My hubby and kid loved it.. it was amazingly soft and moist... could hardly believe that this could also be so healthy!!

I made this using the reviews and as suggested used a mix of brown sugar and honey as well as the apple sauce. This ended up being way to sweet for me and will try with the oil next time. With all these sugars in the recipe I don't think it is very healthy especially for those who have to watch their intake. Using something like canola oil is much healthier and will add only a few more calories.  Not happy but will try recipe again using the oil.

I like using applesauce in place of oil, but this time I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce.  I used the 1/4 of honey and only about 1/8 cup of brown sugar (because that was all I had), but next time I will only go with the 1/8 cup of honey.  I, also, used half as much salt as called for.  Definitely will make again.

I substituted apple sauce for the oil, egg whites for the whole eggs, added 1/2 t. cinnamon, one large grated carrot and a third of a cup of chocolate chips.  I baked it 52 minutes at 325 degrees.  Delicious!

I used a 3rd less wheat flour and replaced it with oats, I used a quarter less honey and replaced it with brown sugar. I added Ghirardelli's semi sweet chocolate chips, coconut and chopped almonds because that's what I had on hand. I realize I changed alot in the recipe but I still give  5 stars bc it was an easy and good base recipe for me. I'll try coconut oil instead of veg next time as I enjoy the flavor it gives to baked goods.

I was concerned the whole wheat flour would result in a dry texture, but it was moist and the flavor was incredible. I substituted olive oil, added cinnamon, nutmeg and a bit more nuts. This will be my go to recipe for banana nut bread!

This is the best banana bread I have made and I love that it uses 100% whole wheat.  It rises, it is moist, it is very flavorful.  I did add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and used bananas from my backyard.

Super easy and quick! Sometimes I only do half the amount of honey and then I add a little raw sugar.  It's delicious! I recommend using medium to dark brown bananas for a sweeter taste.

This was so delicious!! I actually substituted the honey with pure maple syrup and it was really good! My husband couldn't tell it was whole wheat either. I made a banana bread that was whole wheat once and you could tell. This was also very moist!! I will be using this recipe again!

Bread was moist, but needs more banana flavor. Adding more banana may also solve the issue of the lack of sweetness in the bread. It just was too healthy. Maybe it will go good with some jam and butter?

Loved the yummy moist bread. I made 2 changes to the recipe 1) I replaced the honey with an equivalent quantity of dark brown sugar and 2) Added mixed chopped nuts (walnuts, pecans, almonds, pumpkin seeds) for extra crunch and flavor. Would definitely make this again!

Delicious!!! I don't like bananas, but this looked so good. I used two bananas and used applesauce to fill up the two cups. I also split the amount of oil with applesauce, half and half, and added a half teaspoon of nutmeg (per  reviews). What a hearty, delicious, and nutritious bread! Thank you for the post!

This is an excellent banana bread. I was looking for a recipe with whole wheat flour, and I'm really happy with how it turned out--as was anyone else who tried it! I baked this in one 8" loaf pan and it was done in 1 hour 15 minutes.

Super easy to make and DELICIOUS! I added 1/4 cup leftover pumpkin puree and subbed 1/4 apple sauce for oil. I used 1/4 cup honey and added 1/4 cup chocolate chips. Also added 6/8 teaspoons cinnamon and nutmeg. Amazing!

I used coconut oil instead and it turned out so fantastic!! Also I used egg whites because I can't eat eggs. Oh and extra walnuts. I'll be making this again for sure!

Great recipe! Left the nuts out for personal preference but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it turned out moist and very tasty. Will definitely be doing this again.

This was better than expect considering the wheat flour. I used others suggestions and added cinnamon and chocolate chips. Turned out very moist.

Delicious! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I also added large dashes of cinnamon. And instead of 1 c of bananas, I bumped it up to nearly 2. Very delicious and healthy bread. Plus my very picky 3 and 7 year olds loved it!

Great recipe! It has outdone my expectations. Love the more natural ingredients versus other recipes I've seen (no butter or processed sugars) and even though I made it several days ago it has remained moist and has not dried out. I left out the nuts as this was shared beyond my use (allergy concerns),but will add them in the future.This will be my go to banana bread going forward. Absolutely love it! Thank you to the person who shared this! :)

Of course I made changes. It's always fun to make changes and based on other reviews it sounded like it needed more moisture and spices, so thanks for that advice. I used organic grass fed butter instead of oil. I added an additional 1/2 cup of (1) banana.  Instead of the 1/2 cup honey I used 3 TBS fructose and 1/4 cup honey to reduce the glycemic index. I love cinnamon so I added at least 1 Tbs along with a pinch of ground clove and nutmeg. I also used more nuts; a mix of 1/2 cup walnuts and 1/2 cup pecans. It was amazing!! This was very moist and made good sized loaf in a 9" loaf pan. I cut into slices and froze most of it so that I don't eat it all in one day. It froze very well with the thawed pieces tasting just as fresh as the day it was made. I will definitely do this one again.

I've made this recipe twice. The first time as a loaf, exactly as the recipe was written. It was great! The second time I read some other reviews and decided to try some of the suggestions. I replaced the oil with prune/Apple puréed baby food. I also added 1tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I baked them in muffin tins for closer to 35-40 minutes. The texture is better and they are so moist.

I love this bread! 
I did try a few modifications - added 1/4 tsp each of ground black pepper, clove powder, cinnamon powder, and , sometimes have tried adding dried ginger powder and it tastes great!
I sometimes  forget to keep the baking soda separate, and add it to flour/dry ingredients , and then add hot water in the end. The results are still great, turns out fine even with that .

I've been purposely looking for recipes that leave out refined sugar. This is a really good one.  I even went ahead and substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil and it worked great! Good. Sweet enough. Moist. I had a youngster request I add chocolate chips. To keep that addition minimal, I baked this for 30 minutes in a 9x13 cake pan and sprinkled just a few chips on top of "cake" fresh out of warm oven. Then I spread the chips when melted for a nice, thin layer of chocolatey goodness.

I cheated a little bit - used 3 eggs and peanut butter chips! It was super moist and I was happy that I didn't have to use ground sugar to get my desired level of sweetness!

Its great, but I use about a 1/2 cup oil, and use about 3/4 cup banana. I go over the top with the honey, and I add a few handfuls of shredded cocoanut and about 4 handfuls of dark chocolate chips. It becomes super moist, and the banana, cocoanut and dark chocolate works well together. Sprinkled with a lot of cinnamon/sugar on the top before baking for a sugar coat crust.

By far the BEST banana bread recipe I've ever encountered, as it made the BEST banana bread ever! I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and the taste was wonderful and consistancy perfection. I used raw YS honey, extra virgin olive oil, and for my salt I grated Himalayan pink salt with a pinch of celtic sea salt. WOW. Thank you for posting this amazing recipe, I will never use another.

The only substitution I made was simply due to the fact that I have two huge gallon bags of pecans, but I have no doubt that walnuts would be terrific in this bread. I admit that I couldn't wait and cut into it an hour after it came out of the oven. It's been my experience that banana breads are best a day after baking.  This was already moist and its flavor can only improve.  Whoever posted that it has a horrible aftertaste must have used a rancid ingredient or mismeasured.

Yay - finally a recipe that's healthy and so tasty!!!  I made just a couple minor changes - I used applesauce instead of the oil and just a little bit of brown sugar (less than 1/4 of a cup) as another reviewer recommended).  I also used about 1 1/4 c mashed bananas (about 3 large), and sprinkled in some mini chocolate chips.  It was so moist and flavorful.  Definitely a recipe we will make often!

After reading some of the reviews I decided to try this recipe, with my own variations. I went half and half with white and wheat flour, half and half with brown sugar and agave, and sprinkled a couple of raisins and chocolate chips in. I also used two large bananas, didn't measure them. It was fabulous! Next time I'll lessen the brown sugar from 1/4 cup to a table spoon as we are working on lessening our sugar intake.

Very good recipe; however, I would, like other reviewers have mentioned, increase the banana a bit and add spices to enhance the flavor. The main issue I ran into was the baking time- the batter is wet! 1/4 cup water may be too much.. but seeing that only a handful of other reviewers mention extending the baking time, I wonder if the issue is more a result of the altitude of where I live (a little over a mile up.) I had to knock the temperature down to 300 (and then lower to keep from burning) after the first hour and bake for another 1 1/2 hours! I will certainly make the recipe again, but I think I will try muffins or use a flatter dish next time (which would give me banana bars instead of a loaf.)

This was a great recipe! I did adjust as others suggested using apple sauce instead of the oil, and it worked out great! I did need to cook about 6-7 minutes longer than the recipe called for.  This is much healthier version of banana nut bread, and it's moist and delicious!  This will be my go-to banana nut bread recipe going forward.

Really love this recipe. Very few ingredients, easy and moist and sweet. Like old fashion banana bread minus the fat and calories. I don't think my family will be able to tell the difference. I'll try it next time with the applesauce substitution.

Made this last week and I accidentally used only 1/4 cup of honey and not enough banana and it was great. Made today and did the half cup of honey, added some cinnamon, and used three bananas instead of the two I used last time and it's more moist looking. Will try it tomorrow and see how it goes but it looks and smells great!

Tried this again today for the second time this week! I add 1/2 cup of wheat germ, 1/2 cup flax seed and add 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I also add 2/3 cup of applesauce.   My kids love it. Healthy but tasty.

I think this is really good - and have made it a few times.  I make muffins out of it, and instead of walnuts substituted 1 cup of chocolate chips and bake for about 18 minutes.  The muffins aren't real sweet and the semi-sweet chocolate chips really give it a little kick.

I have made this for bread and muffins with whole wheat, all almond flour, and a half almond/ half rice flour mix.  Each way it came out great.  I have never used oil but replaced it with plain applesauce.  I've also added chopped strawberries.  I use this once a week for muffins for my 4 year old son, who for some reason calls them "cookies" and actually prefers them to cookies (he favors banana-anything over all else).  Thanks so much for this recipe- it was the first gluten free adaptation I ever tried and will keep using!

This is the best banana bread I've made and I now make it regularly. I add a little more banana than what it calls for, and I break up the flour with some ground wheat germ and flaxseed meal. And then I also throw in a few chocolate chips bc that never hurts :)

So yummy. This is the first time am trying banana nut bread and it tastes so delicious. I like the fact that it is healthier too. Will be using this recipe more often in the future. Wish it were more moist though. Think i'll add more bananas next time.

This recipe is very good.  I am not a big fan of banana bread but have made this twice in 2 weeks.  Took it to work - devoured by the gang tired of Christmas sweets and wishing to eat healthier.  I do put an extra 1/2 banana + 1/2 to 3/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp (+ a little more) nutmeg.  Makes it just right.  Also, I have a lot of black walnuts in the freezer, I toasted them and used those. Oh my. This is really good.

This is a comfort food.  Tastes more flavorful after one day - you can taste the honey. Lasts well all week and can be refrigerated.  I skipped the walnuts which brings the recipe down to 186 calories, 7.3 fat, 13g sugar, 3g protein.

Delicious and hearty! I used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I used 3 ripe bananas and added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. I added 1/4 cup walnuts and 1/4 raisins, but next time I'll be adding more walnuts, raisins, and cinnamon.

I got wind of this recipe through a friend of mine so I decided to the it.   She used  3/4 cup regular flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour in her recipe.  I decided to use organic stoned ground whole wheat flour and sprinkled Ghiradelli dark chocolate on the top to add a little more sweetness to the recipe.  The texture is very even and moist.  Delicious!

Lovely recipe ! I followed it exactly as it is except I put a handful of choco chips instead of walnuts to please an 8 year old! As I didn't have much baking time, I made it as cake pops and it was yummmm !!

This bread is really wonderful. I substituted brown sugar for the honey, added some chocolate chips, and used freshly ground multigrain flour (white wheat, quinoa, brown rice, millet, and barley). 3 mini loaves baked for 35 minutes at 350.

I love this recipe. Just made a loaf and it is delish. For me, it is moist and I love that it is not too sweet. Perfect healthy and light treat. I will never buy another slice of banana bread from Starbuck's again. I added a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cinnamon. I had to add about 10 minutes to the baking time.

Made several changes according to other commenters. Used 3/4 c unsweetened applesauce instead of oil. Used blend of brown sugar and white sugar in place of honey because of cost. Used a little more banana. Biggest change was I used some nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon because a lot of people said it was bland. I also added about 1/2 c coconut just to make it with more texture since I didn't have any nuts.  nuts. I baked mini loafs at 325 for about 25-30 minutes.  Loved this with the changes and will use this as my standard recipe now!

It was very bland to me.  I happened to double the batch, adding cranberries and almond slivers to one batch which made it pleasant to eat.  I wish I had added orange juice & zest.  Again, just too bland.

used greek yoghurt (fat free) instead of oil and added a little bit less flour and a half cup of raw muesil(granola). Turned out really well and it is healthy which is a huge benefit when trying to feed it to diet conscious people. Plus it was really moist.

I have made this recipe twice, once as a loaf and tonight as muffins.  I baked the muffins about 23 minutes, and that was maybe a minute too long.  Tonight I used maple syrup in place of the honey because I have heard that heating honey to a baking temperature does something to it that releases toxins. The first time I used half maple syrup and half natural sugar.  I prefer the mix rather than just syrup.  I only had 1/4 cup of walnuts, so that's what I used. I cut the oil to 1/4 cup of coconut oil.  The taste was great.  Next time I'll try it with raisins, and if I skimp on the oil again, I'll add more banana or a bit of applesauce to make it more moist.

Wow!  My kids gobbled this up... they had no idea that it was actually a healthy treat!  I substituted 1/2 of the oil with ground flax (substitute 1 part oil with 3 parts ground flax)... so instead of 1/3 cup oil, I used 1/6 cup oil and 1/2 cup ground flax seed.  It rose nicely and was very moist.  I cut a slice and either toast it or heat in microwave then top with a little butter spray and some light cream cheese... very tasty!  Thank you!  This is a recipe I will use again and again!

Added some extra banana, which made it very moist, and used pecans instead of walnuts.  Not as good as my non-healthy recipe, but still a yummy, healthier snack.

Delicious! I wanted a low-sugar recipe but not one that used Splenda. I was low on honey so I swished a couple tablespoons of water in the bottle to get the last bit out. Maybe that helped with the the moist-ness, which was perfect. I made muffins rather than a loaf and baked them for about 15 minutes. I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

I now make this at least once a week.  If my bananas aren't ripe enough to mash, I throw them in the blender with the other wet ingrediants.  I also add some cinnamon and coat the hreased baking pan with cinnamon and sugar.  Turns out very moist, typically doesn't last more than a couple of days in our house.

Excellent with olive oil instead of vegetable and with chocolate chips in place of the walnuts.  I also tend to add more bananas and may bake it a little longer.  Can't get enough !!!

All I can say is... I should have made a double batch!  I was looking for a healthier banana bread (aka: natural sweeteners instead of sugar, and whole wheat) and this was a great find.  I made it as muffins instead of a loaf so it's easy for the kiddos.  The only changes I made (aside from addition of spices) was out of necessity- I was low on some ingredients.  I used 3 large bananas, grapeseed oil (wanted to use coconut but did not have enough) and half raw honey/half maple syrup (amounted to 1/3c instead of 1/2- hence the extra banana for sweetness).  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg, and a dash of allspice and clove.  Awesome! And thank you! :)

I did not have high expectations for this bread, but I figured I'd try it anyway because I want a healthier recipe than the one I usually use. Am I ever amazed! I used 4 bananas after reading reviews and my bread came out perfect! I will not go back to my white flour and sugar...this is better! Just the right amount of sweetness and pleanty moist. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Really tasty bread. I realized I was out of whole wheat flour so I used white and it still turned out great. I doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves and used 1 whole cup of honey. The loaf barely has any sweetness to it which was dissapointing. I'll definetely go by this recipe again and will double on the honey.

We took out the nut, because of a nut allergy, and it was the best Banana Bread we've ever tasted. Everyone I gave it to commented they've never tasted a better bread!!

Very tasty! Made 12 muffins (~20 minutes). I was afraid to go all the way whole wheat, so did a cup of wheat and 3/4 cup all purpose flour. Also added a cinnamon streusel topping, delightful.

I've made this three times this month. LOVE IT!  SOOO MOIST. I liked it when I used applesauce for 1/2 to all of the oil.  Also, I used some brown sugar for part of the honey. The recipe as is, and the recipe with applesauce / brown sugar added is delicious.  It does taste healthy, but flavorful. I ate the whole pan in a day!  (baked in a 8x8 square instead of loaf pan)

For some reason this was super dense and tasted very bland, even after I added 1 T of pumpkin pie spice like a use suggested. Not a big fan.

This was very yummy! I think the heat should be a little higher (350F), but the bake time remain the same. I had to bake at 325 for 1 hour and 15 mins. Very tasty anyway!

I made these as muffins and baked them for about 22 minutes. I did tweak the recipe a little. I used 1/2 cup white whole wheat flour and the rest regular whole wheat, added 2T coconut oil and about 2 T vanilla yogurt. I also added choc chips to 1/2 the muffins. The texture is good but the flavor is lacking. I think I'll work on making this a little more yummy as it was easy to make. Maybe I'll add brown sugar and more bananas next time? I drizzled a still warm one with orange honey and it was pretty tasty.

Great consistency and moist without being sticky, but pretty bland.  I'd recommend adding the banana last and barely mixing it into the batter, as well as adding some spices.  Will definitely make again with a few changes.

I had some over ripe bananas and though banana bread is not my favorite, I tried this recipe and it was very good!  I froze individual slices and took it to work for my lunch.  Heated in the microwave with a little promise margarine spread on top....mmmmm!  I had one problem, and it was my fault.  The baking soda did not dissolve enough and ended up clumping in several spots, making a terrible taste in certain bites.

This recipe is so good!  It is very moist.  I wasn't sure how it would taste with honey instead of sugar, but I was pleasantly suprised!  I thik this will become my main banana bread recipe from now on.

Incredible!  I didn't have high hopes for an all WW flour quickbread, but this was amazingly moist.  It had that great "wet" texture like banana bread should!  The only thing I added was a dash of cinnamon.

Decent recipe. Changed a few things.  Instead of honey, I used a blend of white and brown sugar (honey isn't really making the bread all that much healthier anyways).  For healthy changes, I added more banana, used applesauce instead of oil, and egg whites instead of eggs.  I also added extra spices and put a bit of a crumble on top.  Turned out pretty tasty.

I was skeptical to try another banana bread with whole wheat flour ince I don't usually like the flavor, this bread turned out really moist and flavourful!  For more moisture, I simply added 2/3 c. oil instead of the 1/3 c., as well as 3/4 c. honey. Next time I would substitute for applesauce to make it extra healthy.  My little kids loved this bread in spite of it being "healthy".  I still like my traditional banana bread recipe but this one gets 5 stars for being tasteful with all the good for you ingredients!

I would have rated this only two stars if taste was the only consideration.  It was MUCH too bland; based on taste alone probably the worse banana bread I've made.  But the recipe is easy, the texture was great, the ingredients healthy, and it was moist.  My husband ate it, but I'll go back to my other recipe.

This recipe is great!  I love the flavor- not too sweet and I love that it's healthier than regular banana bread.  I made mine in 4 small loaf pans and only baked it for 30 minutes.

Excellent bread -- moist, yummy, and best of all... healthy!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Just the right amount of sweetness.  Will try with applesauce instead of oil next time.

Thank you for posting this recipe.  Although I also made a few changes, your recipe really helped me make a very moist and hearty banana bread (just how I like it)! If you're looking for a healthier banana bread, this is a great recipe.  I added unsweetened applesauce (about 1/2 cup), and about 2 tablespoons of butter for flavor instead of oil (it's still less fattening than using 1/3 cup of oil).  I love spice flavors, so I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I may even add more cinnamon next time.  I used 3 bananas. It took about 60 minutes to bake. I have eaten most of the loaf in two days (I'm a runner). I will make this again!

Delicious.   I made muffins, and added raisins and chopped pecans, and applesauce instead of oil. I also added 1/4 cup more whole wheat flour because the mixture seemed extremely moist... and it was perfection. I sprinkled the tops with some oats, cinnamon and a little bit of turbinado cane sugar, and the muffins were gone within an hour.  Not too sweet, moist and very flavorful. I will definitely be making this again.

Easy and yummy.  I love bananas. My husband said it seemed a bit dry.  I have seen some others say that they added applesauce instead of oil.  I will try that next time.  I will definitely be making this again.  I think it could use more banana's.  I used two and half and still would like more of that banana flavor. I baked in 2 small foil pans for about 50 min and I think they turned out wonderful. Soft but not especially moist.  Still, I really liked it.

I only baked for 45 min, wish I would've checked it at 40 min, was a little too brown. Used 3 bananas, used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar 'cause I only had about an 1/8 cup of honey left. Very good!

This was so good and surprisingly sweet.  I added a little extra banana and it turned out really moist.  I ended up eating almost the whole loaf by myself!  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is fantastic!  I have a bit of a sweet tooth, so I added some Wheat Germ to add a little more sweetness.  I found that it needed a little more salt to bring out the sweetness of the ingredients.  I also added vanilla bean and 60% Cacao, bittersweet, chocolate chips to the mix. Instead of loafs, I made muffins.  It let me make a bigger batch and freeze the rest.  My son would eat these every day if he could.  He has no idea that they are a healthier snack him than cake or cookies!

I loved this healthy recipe.  I substituted cinnamon applesauce for the oil and didnt' have enough honey so I added 1 tbsp. sugar and it was great!  My three year old son loved it as well.

This was deemed as 'the only banana bread recipe we need' by my husband!  Very moist and tasty.  Also, incredibly easy to make.  We've added in a few chocolate chips along with the nuts.  I will always have to make a double batch!

This was a very good healthy banana bread. I used homemade applesauce in place of the oil-just over 1/3 cup. My kids gobbled it all up. Moist and delish-thanks for the recipe!

very moist, but a bit bland.  Add some cinnamon, and some flaxseed powder for nuttiness and extra fiber.

Thanks for the recipe. It was on the dry side the first time I made it, but it was still good. It is a refreshingly healthy banana bread, not too sweet. I made it again and used more banana and a little less honey and some brown sugar, and replaced 3/4 cups of wheat flour with 3/4 cups of white bread flour. This second loaf was much more moist. Thanks again.

Delicious! Very tasty, and lots of fun to make. Excluding me, my family generally abhors anything "whole wheat," but they all loved this. It smelled so good, I had to hold everyone back for the 30 minutes it took to cool, they couldn't wait to cut into it and try a piece.

Don't get me wrong - this IS good, but I have made my mom's traditional recipie for YEARS, and this was definitely different. I LOVE whole wheat bread, but this was just ... different. I doubled the banana after reading reviews (and did the applesauce suggestion from the submitter) I also mixed all wet ingredients then added the flour as one reviewer suggested. I made two loves, the first just according to recipie (and double the banana's) and then after tasting, I made another recipie with just a TOUCH more honey and some cinnamon. Everyone has agreed that the latter was better. I'm in a high altitude, so not sure if that makes a difference, but I cooked for about 60 - 75 minutes and still extremely moist!

Yum! I was so happy to find a healthy banana bread recipe! I used 3 large bananas (probably more than 1 cup), omitted the oil and replaced it with apple sauce and also added some cinnamon, nutmeg and a couple tspoons of cocoa powder (unsweetened). I left out the walnuts and used raisins instead. Thinking dates would go well as a sub too. Best banana bread I've made!

Used eggs whites and added 1/4 cup wheat germ. There was a slight after taste that I'm going to blame the eggs whites for and a little dry. Again, my fault for adding dry ingredients and not replacing. Will try one more time.

I did make some changes. Based on the previous reviews I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and for a lighter consistency; I replaced ¾ cup of whole-wheat flour with all-purpose. In addition, if you mix all the wet ingredients with the mixer then add the dry and mix by hand until just moistened – do not over mix – you will get a lighter and fluffier texture. I replaced the water with yogurt and added the baking powder with the flour. We love chocolate chips in our banana bread so I added ½ cup of chocolate chips too. Loved it.

Very good.  I used applesauce instead of oil and added a good amount of cinnamon and a pinch of ground cloves.  Still tasted a bit grainy, or "healthy."

This was a very easy bread to make. It was very moist. I added more banana than called for. I still think it needed more banana flavor and a little sweeter though. I added 1/4 cup brown sugar the next time and it was great. Will make over and over.

This recipe was AMAZING!  I followed the advice of another reader and used unsweetened applesause instead of oil, addes some cinammon, and cut down on the honey but added brown sugar from Splenda.  The results were amazing.  My family loved the banana bread.  I made it last night and this morning there were only a few slices left.  The bread turned out very moist.  This is definitely going to become one of our favorite recipes in my home.

It was good, but not great. Just FYI: honey is not as sweet as refined sugar, so it's not that sweet a bread. Also, I like to add finely chopped lemon zest to my banana bread for a little extra brightness.

This banana bread is so good, you wont know the difference between white and wheat flour. I was a bit afraid it would not rise as much since the recipe called for all wheat flour, but it came out perfectly! I added about 1/2 c. more of banana, a few raisins, and half of a topping another reviewer suggested (1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. oats, 1/2 banana chopped). I substituted applesauce for oil. It was delicious! Very moist and just the right sweetness! I will definitely be making this again!

This was actually very good!  Some reviewers said it wasn't sweet enough.  It is true that it is not extremely sweet - but I think it tastes perfect!  And it is healthy too!  Very good recipe that I will keep making!!  (Mine was ready in only 50 minutes - so make sure you don't overcook it!)

this is a great tasting somewhat healthy bread. Good toasted and plain. Not a very long shelf life though. I used half splenda and half honey. I also threw in some toasted walnuts.  yummy

i though this recipe was amazing. i did unsweetened applesauce, and  used 1.5 cups BLACK bananas. also, i added 1 cup frozen blueberries. the bake time was 75 minutes, but turned out super moist and very sweet. it is a little dense at the bottom of the bread, but that may be my fault for not stirring thoroughly. i'll def make this lots, maybe christmas gifts or something.

These were not sweet enough.  I took others advice & used applesauce instead of oil.  Also I used 3 ripe bananas, brown sugar, cinnamon & left the honey out because I didnt have it.  I baked it in muffin pan & they fell apart when trying to get them out.  The texture was good, however they werent sweet enough for me.

This was the best healthy whole wheat thing I have ever made!   I did use about 6 smaller very ripe bananas and it equaled about a cup and a half!  It was very moist and delicious!  The only other thing I added was a bit of cinnamon!

Delicious!  I took someone's suggestion and added 1/4 cup banana, super moist!  Also, I use coconut oil instead, and I added more, too, and used carob chips in my kids' loaf and chocolate chips in mine :)

Very good.  I did not have walnuts on hand so I substituted pecans.  Next time I plan to try plain yogurt for the oil.  I also doubled the recipe and it worked great. Mine did have to bake about 15 minutes longer.  Will make it again for sure.

A good -- not super, not outstanding -- banana bread. It is a nice healthier option, though I will add cinnamon next time.

OH MY! I've tried SO many healthy quick breads and this is the BEST! I don't know why I waited so long to try this one. This is how I will use all my old bananas from now on. I did add some cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg, and a bit more canola oil (after reading the reviews). I think next time I will try with applesauce- I didn't have any in the house today. Maybe agave nectar in place of some of the honey. Awesome bread! I felt like I was being naughty and eating something unhealthy. I'm going to make another loaf tomorrow. Love it!

I made this bread for Christmas and nobody knew it was good for you. Everybody thought it was just regular banana bread! I substituted the oil for applesause and added a little extra to keep the bread moist. It was delicious and it will be my banana bread recipe from now on!

I think this recipe is excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used flax oil for the omega 3 boost.  Came out fantastic.  When the bread was done baking, I spread some all natural peanut butter on it and sliced a few bananas and yum yum!

I really like this recipe because it is the perfect balance of healthy ingredients and great flavor.  Last time I made two loaves I brought one to a neighbor and his family loved it, not even knowing it was a whole wheat "healthy recipe" until I told them.

This recipe was great.  I did make some changes mentioned by others and did a few of my own.  I used no suger added applesauce instead of oil, added some cinnamon, used half honey half brown sugar, threw in a tblsp of wheat germ and added about half a cup of coconut.  I was impressed with the flavor and a day later they were still moist.  My hubby even likes them.  I will definitely continue to use this recipe.

A bit on the dry side (compared to my usual, less-healthy recipe), but still tasty.  I only had 1/4 c. honey and so I subbed Sorghum for the rest - although I took another reviewers suggestion and used half honey half brown sugar - or rather, half some honey and Sorghum and half brown sugar.  I think it would benefit from nuts but my husband refuses to eat anything with nuts so I unfortunately almost always have to leave them out.

This bread came out moist and tasty. I put in 1 tsp cinnamon and after eating it I think that it needs some nutmeg or other spice. It's a little bland with a light banana flavor and a light sweetness from the honey and vanilla. Overall, it's good and I like that it's a healthier alternative.

Definitely a good bread but I'm unsure that it has enough banana flavor. I used 3 bananas and the flavor did not shine through as much as I would like. Added a 1/2 cup of PB for flavor and made a "topping" of 1/2 cup pecans and 2 tbl. butter. I flipped it over and layered my two 9" "bread cakes" almost like an upside down cake. Drizzled with chocolate sauce and was tasty. Replaced oil with applesauce and used 1/4 c honey and 1/4 cup light pancake syrup. Glad I found a recipe that didn't directly use sugar! Very nice.

I made it for my aunt without the nuts(just didn't have any) and with molasses instead of honey. I used an extra banana and added cinnamon based off the other suggestions. I also covered it for the last 15min. with foil so it didn't burn.

 Overall, it came out pretty good, though it wasn't distinctly banana-flavored. It'd be best with nuts or chocolate, probably.

I LOVE this recipe!  What a tasty and nutritious banana bread.  I substituted a little bit of chocolate chips for the nuts, it was delicious.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated. It was good, but no substitution for regular  banana bread. I would not serve it to company if I want to impress, but it's OK to have around the house if you like making banana bread a lot.

A little dry and not quite sweet enough for my family's taste. I thought it was quite tasty for such a healthful bread, so next time I will add some applesauce, cinnamon, and a little more honey and hopefully that will make us all happy! Good basic recipe.

This is a really awesome (and totally forgiving) recipe!!!  I lacked honey, so I subsituted with molasses, threw in 2 bananas, and baked it in a cupcake tin.  They came out beautifully puffed up like those seen in professional bakeries (although there was only enough to make 7).  Loved the fact that it wasn't too sweet, and the texture is crisp on the outside and moist and chewy inside -- just perfect.  Props!

Much different from the lots-of-sugar quick white banana bread I'm used to, not as moist nor sweet obviously - but wonderful for a wheat bread.  Knowing it's healthy makes a difference.  My sweet tooth husband didn't like it, that just means I'll have to eat it all myself.  I add some low sugar jam for some sweetness.

This recipe had no flavor, it didnt even taste like bananas.  It was a little dry and I only cooked it for 52 minutes.  I was not impressed.

Yummy!  This was my first attempt at anything using whole wheat flour and the bread turned out very good.  You definitely need to have your slice with something to drink because it's a tiny bit dry but that's the nature of whole wheat flour.  I'm making it again this weekend to bring to work and am going to try mixing the flours to see what turns out.

I thought it was just okay.  Kinda dry and not very sweet.  I only cooked it for 50 minutes and it was done.  I don't think it needs one hour to bake, it would've been horribly dry and burnt.

Excellent and all the way. Love it because of the whole wheat and honey - healthy ingredients that you can't even tell are there. I mash my bananas in a food processor and the texture of the bread comes out nice and crumbly instead of the icky unified texture many banana breads have. Works perfectly fine even if you don't have ripe bananas on hand. Excellent for college students like myself looking for a healthy snack.

Very good!  Wholesome, moist, healthy.  I didn't have walnuts so I added pumpkin seeds and wheat germ, i also dropped a handful of rolled oats on the top of the bread right before baking.

Very popular with my family.  Did not use nuts.  3 stars for taste from me, 4 stars if you consider it's fairly healthy (a fair bit of oil, but not as much as some banana bread...and it's whole wheat).

The first time I made this with olive oil and it did not turn out at all like I expected. This time I made it with canola oil and it turned out just right. I believe my oil was too old. Hearty and not too sweet!

Excellent!  I accidentally baked it at 375 for the hour instead of 325 (oops!).  But, it was not dry, it had excellent flavor and just the edges were too done.  The flavor is awesome, the whole wheat flour gives it a nutty texture & taste.  I also used 1/4 cup honey/1/4 cup Splenda and it was great.  Thank you!

This recipe is wonderful!  I made it when my sister's family was visiting and my 4 year old nephew couldn't get enough of it!  I use whole wheat pastry flour and it turns out so tasty. I don't feel guilty eating this because it has all healthy ingredients.

This wasn't as good as I was hoping for even though I added some chocolate chips.  It was fairly moist but I did use more banana than called for.   It wasn't the recipe, I guess we just don't care for whole wheat even though we know it is better for us.  Won't make this one again.

Thank you, Peggy!  The batter smelled amazingly good & healthy and the final product was even better.  This bread is wonderfully moist and delicious (I used a combination of olive oil & applesauce) and it looks so nice fresh out of the oven!  I was looking for a healthy banana bread recipe and now my search is ended.

Never tasted a banana bread so moist--everyone loved it, definitely will make again. I've tried sooo many banana bread recipes--this is the best one so far. Added choc chips. No one could tell this was a healthier version of our fav bread.

Good but not super.  I used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil, but I thought it was still a little dry.  My husband thought it was wonderful.  I will fiddle with the recipe and make again.

This bread is moist and wonderful! I replaced half of the oil with applesauce, and I didn't have vegetable oil, so I used olive oil. I also skipped the salt. It is hard to believe that it made with only whole wheat flour! So good! Thanks for the recipe...it's a keeper!

i followed the recipe exactly as it is and the bread turned out great! the flavor of the wheat really worked well with the banana and nuts. next time, i would try adding some chocolate chips for a sweeter flavor. but i will definitely use this recipe again!

This banana bread tasted a little too healthy for me, due to the whole-wheat flour.  In the future, I will stick to my standard low-fat banana bread recipe that uses all-purpose (white) flour.

It's amazing that such a healthy bread can taste so good!  I'm not that experienced at baking, and I had some notion that wheat would make it taste dry.  I was totally wrong!  It's very moist and delicious!
