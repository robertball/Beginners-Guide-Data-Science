The close up picture of the chicken is not this recipe. Please do not be confused this is not a sauce, but a marinade. Try this for extra spicy. Put you chicken in a strainer and then pour the marinade over it. All the little pieces of chipolte stick to the chicken. Tell me what you think. If I see you all like it I have a fresh salsa to go with it. nothing like you will ever see. Just wait for my next post. Buen Provecho

Very good. I used an entire 12 oz can of chipotle.  Instead of a whole cut up chicken, I used boneless skinless breasts and thighs. Since it is winter and didn't want to use the charcoal grill, I broiled it using my gas stove. Turned out great. I can't wait to try them on the grill in the spring. I served along side Poblano stuffed with charizo, shrimp and rice from the food network site. Fabulous dinner.

This was out of this world and definitely the spiciest chicken I have ever eaten. I have searched everywhere for a truly spicy chicken without any sweetness and this is it! I would dare to say it rivals the flavor of the Chipotle Restaurant marinade. I followed the directions, using boneless skinless  chicken breasts but I think you could leave out the salt entirely (not so great for you) and not miss it. After marinating for 7 hours and grilling for 4 minutes each on the George Foreman this made a very hot dish! Definitely great for the winter time on a cold day. Prepare to guzzle a gallon of water, though!

Excellent marinade. I added more garlic and chipotles and bbq'd split chicken halves over lump charcoal with mesquite chunks. Very moist and flavorful... Oh, and that skin! A crispy delight! Thanks for the recipe.

Very good marinade. I used extra chipotle peppers and marinated the chicken overnight. Then I used the leftovers for enchiladas. Yum!

This is the best chicken we have ever had!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and the entire can of chipotle peppers (because we like it spicy)!  Definitely a keeper in this house!!!!!!

This recipe is SO good - I actually used it as a marinade for my first try at beef jerky and the jerky is amazing!! I would seriously use this on anything, although I did make two changes. 1. I forgot to put the garlic in (sad, because I love garlic), and 2. I only used about half a cup of worcestershire. I marinated about 1 3/4 pounds of beef (after I cut it into skinny strips) for two days in the fridge and then cooked it on wire racks for 4 hours at 170 degrees. DELICIOUS!! ;D

The smell of this marinated chicken cooking will drive you insane. We couldn't wait to dig in by the time it was done and boy on boy it was delicious! I think next time I'll kick the heat up a little more (I was a bit of a scaredy cat this time) or let it marinate a bit longer. I had no leftovers and everyone sat around holding their tummies like it was Thanksgiving. Ty so much for the recipe!

I used this basic recipe for a marinade.  When I actually got the wings home from the store, I placed them in the marinade and froze them.  The day before I used them, I placed them in the refrigerator to thaw and marinade.  Right before I am ready to cook them, I flour them with a dried ground chipotle powder and flour mixture.  They not only have more flavor but also crisp up if you are frying them.

I have now made this marinade quite a few times. The marinade can be altered a bit to taste preferances and/or availability of ingredients. But just as it is, it's wonderful. You can also use it for boneless skinless chicken breasts and thighs, not just whole chickens with skin on.  I've made it at least six times and it is definately a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is great and very forgiving.  I marinated it overnight and grilled it.  I also prepared two on an indoor grill.  The best were the ones prepared on the outdoor grill.  I also used half worcestershiire and half soy sauce.  I did not have lime or apple cider vinegar.  I used very little salt and it had great flavor.  Great recipe.  I do recommend trying it.

this was a hit at our cinco de mayo party. it's one fo the few recipes i've been able to make as is without having to change anything! it was delicious. i only had time to marinate for an hour, and it still was amazing. next time the only thing i will do different is to let it sit longer

I can not thank you enough for this amazing recipe! I used 2 trays of chicken thighs and let it marinade for about 6 hours. Once we threw them on the grill the aroma from the marinade was so delish, that our neighbors came over to find out what we were making. Highly reccomended to all!

Thought the "2 cups of Worcestershire sauce" was a typo so did 2 tablespoons instead, glad we did, would have been a very expensive marinade:) Glad we did not add the hot sauce, very spicy enough with just chipotles. Also also found it a bit too acidic so added some honey to bring out some sweetness.  Added a handful of cilantro and lime zest.  A good basic marinade but found we did alter it for our tastes:)

We don't have a grill so I baked the chicken.  The flavor completely permeated the meat and was very moist and juicy.

Sorry, guess we are the minority here but we didn't care for this recipe. Had too much of a vinegar taste for us. Used it with skinless boneless thighs and marinated over night. Maybe it would have been better with skin on chicken, but as is and on skinless it didn't rock our world.

Even my kids loved this (and they don't like spicy food).  I prepared it exactly as the recipe said, omitting the optional hot sauce but including the salt.  The chicken had an incredible flavor, and plenty of bite, but didn't set anyone's mouth on fire.  Fabulous recipe!  Thanks for sharing it!

Delish.  Used this marinade for boneless skinless chicken breasts, spicy and great.  I might add a little more acid (vinegar or lime juice) next time because we like the tang.

The picture needs to go, this is a marinade not a sauce. It was very good and I may make this two or three times a year using boneless skinless breasts or thighs. We enjoyed it, but not enough to eat it every month.

I was so excited to try this!! We love hot. I changed the recipe to 6 servings and followed exactly. I marinated it for 24 hours. It was DRY and way to tangy. I don't know if it was the lime juice or the apple cider vinegar.

Outstanding recipe! I used lemon juice and white vinegar due to need.  Rocked with those substitutions.

I made this several times and I often adjust the worschestir sauce based on what I have, and it still turns out great. I always add a tablespoon of honey and extra lime. It's always a hit recipe for parties. I also usually just use thinly sliced chicken breasts.

I've made this several times as it is always requested at family BBQs now.  It's easy, spicy and delicious.  It's unlike other marinades and makes for a nice change.  Leftovers make fantastic chicken salad!  I always use chicken thighs, smoked paprika and half the Worcester  sauce.  Other than that, feel free to play around with the measurements to suit your taste.  It's a keeper!
