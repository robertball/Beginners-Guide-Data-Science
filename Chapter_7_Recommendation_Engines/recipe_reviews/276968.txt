This chili was so simple to make and the family LOVED it! It did come out a tad thinner than I normally would like but I'll just add less beef broth to start next time and that should do the trick. I put this together the night before and that worked out great. I will def be making this again-yum! Thanks for sharing

So good! Most of my family doesnâ€™t like it too hot so I omitted the cayenne pepper and I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced. Everyone had two helpings! I will definitely make again!

Next time I would add a little less broth, but other than that it was great!  The whole family enjoyed it!
