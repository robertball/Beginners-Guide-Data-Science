We loved this!  Added lemon juice, lemon pepper, garlic salt and basil.  May try with some olives next (Italian baked salmon?)

My husband is big into healthy eating and loves this recipe. Really quick and easy. Before baking I also sprinkle lemon juice all over the salmon.

This was great! I seasoned the salmon with salt and pepper, little garlic salt and paprika. Sqeezed lemon juice over it, ad then added the green onions and tomato, plus some chopped green bell pepper. It was sooo GOOD!! I will make this forever!

It was not as good as I had hoped.  The tomato and green onions didn't add any real flavor to the Salmon

Very easy to make! I made this for dinner last night and my husband and son loved it. My son went  back for seconds which he never does with salmon. And we eat a LOT of salmon since we live in a salmon fishing village in Alaska. I followed some of the other reviews and squeezed fresh lemon over the top just before putting in the oven (the picture shows lemon, but the recipe doesn't call for it??). I also sprinkled garlic salt. My husband even re-named it, "Salmon Fresco"! He even said the dish looked like something served in a nice restaurant.  The tomatoes and green onion don't add flavor to the salmon (like a marinade would because it seeps into the fillet) but taste great on their own, enhancing each bite with fresh-tasting flavor. Delicious!

i found this to be a bit bland, but i'm not much of a salmon person. my husband does like salmon, and he said this is a great recipe. i scaled it to 2 servings and it said a pound of salmon -- this is probably more like 3 servings. next time i might sprinkle some onion powder with the salt and pepper. i put some lemon juice on it before baking.

I am rating this on my husband's review. He loves salmon and I don't like it.  He said it was very good. I added red bell pepper to it because he loves that vegetable. He did say that he would only like it with the vegetables topping it. I also put a little Old Bay seasoning on them.

super easy to cook, i added some mixed herb and it gives me a very good favour.  the best part is that i even cook that with probably frozen fish and the herb, onion, can take away all bad forzen smell/taste.

Quick and easy. Spice it or add what or how you want but do not leave tomatoes out. As they kook, the juices from tomatoes keep salmon moist. It comes out so tender, juicy and very very delicious. A fantastic healthy addition to my diet

I made this for dinner tonight and it was so yummy, we both love salmon,  i followed the recipe and added cilantro to the tomatoes and scallions and also added a little salt and paprika to the mix and also cooked it a little longer and had to brush off the veggies to the side  it was still pink under the veggie area, so after doing that I added 10 more minutes  ( my two pieces of salmon were more than a pound)

Some of the ingredients I didn't have so I made it as close as I could to the recipe. I liked it. You might look at my notes.

I really liked this.  After reading the other reviews, I decided to make a few changes.  I put lemon juice on two small fillets, garlic salt, and salt and pepper.  I cut grape tomatoes into slices and arranged them on top.  Delicious!
