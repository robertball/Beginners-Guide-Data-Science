This was absolutely delicious.  I made mushroom broth in my crockpot the night prior to assembling this recipe, using 1/2 lb sliced mushrooms, 1/2 white onion, chopped and 4 cups of water.  I actually reserved some of the mushrooms and added them to the ingredients.  

I wanted a lot more veggies in this stew, so I doubled the carrots and potatoes and added some celery.  I used a "chicken seasonings blend" of fresh rosemary, thyme and sage from the supermarket as a shortcut, and that worked out great!  

This recipe is really adaptable to however you want to make it, but it's just as delicious precisely as written.

This was really good the only thing I might do different next time is used canned beans rather than dry.  It was like soup when I started but by the time the beans had cooked the liquid was almost gone, what was left was kinda slimmy. It's still very good, I love the flavor.  Next time i will cook on the stove, used canned beans added the potatoes at the same time and only cook til potatoes are done, then it should be more like a soup.  I might play around w/ dried spices also cause the fresh ones are to expensive and I usually only end up using a tiny bit then they go bad so its a waste of money.

My whole family loved this. The nine year old had two big servings, AND asked to take the leftovers to school for lunch the next day. I served it with fresh rosemary bread and a green salad.

To be perfectly honest, I found this to be a bit bland, even with the homemade mushroom stock. It's not that it wasn't good -- it just wasn't wonderful. Needs something to give it some interest.

This soup smelled fantastic and I liked the flavor but the beans weren't cooked enough for my taste.  Next time I think I'll cook them for about an hour on the stove and then add them to the crock pot.

We loved the beans.  We ate them as a stew the first time.  I took the left overs which were a little thicker, and used them in a Tuscan style dish, where I layered first the beans, then cooked spinach (with garlic and oil) and topped with a cooked filet of tilapia.

This was an excellent recipe. I followed VONTEITY's recommendations from January, 2005 and made mushroom soup from scratch, overnight while the beans were soaking in another container. After the beans soaked overnight, I boiled them for about 5 minutes and then cut the heat and let them soak for about an hour before including them with the other ingredients.   I discarded the vegetables from the mushroom broth and added 8 ounces of chopped mushrooms to the recipe. I also doubled the vegetables in the recipe and omitted the vegetable bouillon. Since it is winter, I substituted 1 tsp each of rosemary, thyme and savory for the fresh sprigs. I also added 1 tsp of poultry seasoning and added 1 small can of (mild) minced chilies.   I cooked everything for about 9 hours and served this with some French bread.   This is not a spur-of the moment recipe. I think the mushroom broth adds some flavor to this dish. However, preparing this recipe is pretty simple. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe makes a tasty, if subtle dish.  My husband really liked it, but my son and I prefer stronger flavors.  I will make this again, but as a side dish, not a vegetarian entree.

This was...OK.  I made mushroom broth in the slow cooker the night before and included some of the mushrooms, as another reviewer suggested.  I also soaked teh beans overnight, adn they were well-cooked in the final dish.  But it was...uninspiring.  Maybe I expected more because it was called a "cassoulet", which I love and was excited to try a meatless version, but... It got eaten, but I don't think I'll make it again.

I couldn't find dried beans, so I used canned white kidney beans and they were perfect. I also added chopped carrots and sliced veggie sausage, which was probably my favorite part. If you make this, I strongly suggest you add the sausage, it makes it so delicious! All in all, this is a super tasty recipe that's very filling with just a tiny serving. I highly recommend!

I was really looking forward to this, and had to go to a few stores to find the herbs. I followed recipe and ended up with a bland, brown dish with undercooked beans. Maybe it was a fluke with my specific ingredients (since others had better luck), but it didn't work at all. How it could be so tasteless with all those herbs is beyond me. The cook time was way too long for the veggies, they should have been added once the beans were finished. Pricey too.

I used canned beans instead of dried, and dried herbs in place of fresh, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  While we liked it, we didn't think there was anything special about it.  Nothing really knocked our socks off.

This was absolutely delicious. We used vegetable broth instead of mushroom broth and added bay leaves and crush red peppers and a little curry powder.

A tasty, very hearty winter meal.  I soaked the navy beans over night and put them in the crock pot and cooked everything for 8 hours together and had no problem with beans not being cooked or running out of liquid.  It turned out a very nice consistency.  I did add some extra veggies, but nothing too interesting.  I did find it a touch on the bland side, and next time I will try adding some wine to the broth.  Very nice in the winter though, and I will definitely make this again.

This was good and healthy as is. But the second time I made it I left out the potatoes and added sliced mushrooms, minced garlic and diced jalapeno peppers. Then I served it over cooked spaghetti squash. Served with fresh grated parmesan. Everyone raved. Thanks.

My husband gave it a 4/5 with hot sauce! This was fun to make and went together easily. Good crockpot meal for a winter family dinner. Serve with salad and cornbread for a complete meal.  Thanks Syd for sharing!

delicious and different.  Love that this is a new taste for me.  I'll definitely add my own twist to it next time (more potatoes, whole mushrooms, pasta/rice).  Great base to experiment with.

This dish is good, and easy.  I can't find "savory" around so I just use a leaf or two of sage in this.  I usually have to add a healthy pinch of salt to this but otherwise I really like it.

Very Tasty and easy recipe, but I thought it was a little on the bland side.  I followed the recipe exact, except I didn't cook the onion and carrots first, I just threw them in the crock pot as is.  A tad more flavor and it would be 5 stars!

This is one of the best ever. I substituted V-8 for the broth, and at the last minute decided to make it non-vegetarian by adding a little sliced sausage. I can't describe how good this was.

This recipe is lacking salt, pepper, and flavor in general. I chose it because I am looking for vegetarian recipes. I would only make it again if I were in a pinch.

Loved this - my kids even ate it!  Going to be making it a lot this Winter.  Had to make a few adjustments out of necessity - stove-top rather than slow cooker. Dried herbs rather than fresh. Veggie broth rather than mushroom.  It still rocked!

This recipe was DELICIOUS!!  It tasted so luxurious-like we were eating a very special celebration meal but it was just a normal weeknight.  We ate it as some reviewers suggested, good crusty bread w/ butter and the beans.  The only change I made was I added lots more carrots to add extra veggies.  I didn't have all the spices in my cupboard so I used what I had.  (Omitted savory and used lemon pepper instead of lemon thyme) and it turned out wonderful.

Added in a lot from the prior reviews (veggie sausage, chopped the fresh herbs, 1 bottle white wine for more liquid, used 4 cans of mixed beans, made it on stove top, added a bit of spinach leaves at the end) and it came out VERY flavorful, and received rave reviews from Vegetarians, and meat-eaters as a side dish.

It didn't go over well with my husband. I think maybe I cooked it too long?

Awesome soup!  My husband and I loved it.  7 year old stepdaughter "just" liked it, but her 6 year old friend practically licked her bowl clean!  Thank you!

One of the most disappointing recipes I've tried on here, and I've tried hundreds!  I tried to look over as many reviews as possible to get suggestions on how to make this recipe great.  Even when I added more seasoning, garlic, and barley, it still turned out unappealing in terms of appearance.  It seems to be missing a few somethings, and I think it could have potential with some tweaks.

This was wonderful! I used kidney beans instead, and some dried spices, still turned out goos.

The recipe is okay.  I made to speck and it was a little flat.  Mainly it’s missing the meat- which is what gives cassole its depth

I didn't have mushroom broth so I made a vegetable broth after I sautéed the veggies. I also added multi colored carrots and used dried spices because it's what I had. With all of those amendments it was delicious!

I used dried beans I soaked over night. Got it together by 8 am. Used veggie stock instead of mushroom as the guests I was serving don't like mushrooms. By 3 pm the beans were still pretty tough. Turned crockpot to high. This helped some but at 6:30 pm, I expected a nice creamy stew. Never got there, beans remained tough and not much of the liquid got absorbed? Definitely hot enough.  I added spinach at the last hour with potatoes and had to season liberally as it is quite bland. The mushroom broth probably would have added that layer of richness mine was lacking.

Great and easy dish to make. I used vegetable broth rather than mushroom broth and the taste is incredible!

We do vegetarian a few times a week but this is definitely a dish that would be better with meat.   It was good but definitely lacked that heartiness that cassoulet is known for.  Otherwise it has pretty good flavor for a bean soup.

Excellence!  I made this on the stove top instead of the crock pot and it was so easy and fast!  I cheated and used canned beans and dried spices; I added tofu and orzo pasta to make it more of a stew.  I used vegetable broth instead of mushroom.  Tell you what: this was the easiest meal I've cooked all week and my kids enjoyed it more than anything else I made all week!  Winner, for sure!  Thanks.
