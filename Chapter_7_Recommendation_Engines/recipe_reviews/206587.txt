I am new to the South, but my fiance got me liking shrimp and grits since he asked me to try it at a restaurant.  I followed this recipe exactly (except I used more liquid to cook the grits), and it was perfect!  I made this last night and my fiance has requested that I make it again tonight!  I love the mushrooms, the creamy texture and flavor the grits has, and the spicy flavor of the sauce.  I used hot smoked Italian sausage and Texas Pete for the hot sauce and unlike the previous user, the Worcestshire was perfect for me.  Thanks so much for sharing this fabulous recipe!

My husband thought this was delicious.  I thought it was just okay.  I’ve only made grits a few times so I was a bit surprised that the recipe called for 48oz of broth so I compared that to the directions on the package of grits and decided to go with the package.  I used 40 ounces and cooked the grits covered for 30 minutes.  The grits were still pretty runny so I cooked them for about 10 more minutes uncovered knowing that I was going to be adding another 1 ¼ cup of liquid.  Once I added the other liquid, I had to cook for another 50 minutes to get the grits to a good consistency.  Even with the additional cooking time, I found them still pretty runny so I added about a cup of the cheese to the grits to thicken them up.  I made the shrimp as directed (except with bacon drippings instead of Canola) and I found the Worcestershire Sauce to be too overpowering.  I didn’t feel the taste was worth the effort but my husband wasn’t around while I was cooking so just based on taste, he rated this a five.

Absolutely delicious!  I do not like rating recipes as written unless I follow them to a "T".  I bought mushrooms and just forgot to put them in.  So without them a 5 - with them?  Probably a 6!  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was pretty good, but I don't think Worcestershire sauce was right for it.  Didn't taste very Southern to this displaced Southerner's tastebuds.  I'll probably replace it with something else if I can figure out what.

I used olive oil, light cream in place of milk and cream (it's what I had on hand) a few drops of Sriracha instead of traditional Tabasco style sauce and cilantro instead of parsley. This recipe is AMAZING. LOVE IT! Thanks for sharing!

Giving this only 4 stars because we had a difficult time with the grits. They eventually turned out really well but my brother who is from the south had a totally different method that is much faster and would have gotten the same results as we got spending over an hour at the stove. We also had to add way more cheese to get them thick enough to stand up like they should. For the sauce part I added red and green peppers, cooked some finely diced bacon instead of using the canola oil and used Andouille sausage to give it more of a southern kick. I think the original recipe would have been good but not nearly as southern, at least for the part of the south my brother is from. My kids wouldn't even try it but that's okay, more leftovers for us, it was that good.

This is absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe for the shrimp exactly but I forgot the cheese but I don’t think it really needed it anyway.  It had the perfect level of spiciness and was just darn good.  I went to three markets and could not find the stone corn ground grits so I used hominy grits and prepared according to the package.  It was delicious with the hominy grits so I can just imagine how good it would have been prepared as directed.    Will be making this often.

I would personally skip the hot sauce because I think it overpowered the taste of the sausage/shrimp mixture.

I made it tonight, used bacon instead of sausage, rotel instead of fresh, and an extra1/4 cup of grits, and a dash of slap yo mama, chipotle chili powder,  and a dinch of smoked paprika. Other than that,  I followed the recipe.
It was awesome!

So I left out the mushrooms and tomatoes cause someone doesn’t like them. Added a whole chopped onion yellow. I also cut the sausage up in smaller pieces so sliced then quartered if that makes sense. I added 6 pieces of bacon cut in 1” pieces. I started with the bacon till it got pretty well cooked then added the sausage and onions (the yellow one) the green ones go in later when you put the shrimp in. Also I cooked my shrimp in a separate pan with a squash of lemon juice.  Then I added 8oz of shredded smoked Gouda to the grits after they were done. Sorry I complicated the already complicated recipe haha. That’s what I do!!

To be honest, I used this recipe as a "foundation" (didn't have whole milk or half and half cream--used a combo of skim milk and Greek yogurt for thickening and creaming of the grits--I gambled and judged here;  didn't have sausage, but used extra shrimp)...and you know what?  It came out great! I do believe the chicken broth is the key for extra taste/flavor in the grits.  I'll be making this again.

My wife, who has always said "no" to grits, gave in and finally said she would eat grits so..., I rolled out this recipe and went to work!!!  She loved it!  What more can I say?  I followed the recipe with the exception of the tomato (forgot to pick up at the grocery).  This went to the recipe box as a definite "do again".  :-)
