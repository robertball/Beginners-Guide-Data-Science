Delicious!  I took some to work and everyone liked it, but instead of using tomatillos (don't like them that much), I used regular tomatoes.  Thanks for the recipe!

Ironically I had bought basa fillets for the 1st time and some tomatillo and jalapenos. I was looking up a recipe for the fish and found this one. Amazing. My son and I prepared it together. Only thing I did was sprinkle a little lime juice on the fish before I cooked it. It was an excellent recipe.

This was a ver simple, but delicious recipe.  We had never prepared basa before and the recipe was easy to follow and resulted in a meal that we would serve to guests on the first try.

This was really good.  Only change I would make would be to fry the fish in a seperate pan or a grill pan to get it nice and crisp.

Had many tomatillos that I need to use.  This was the perfect recipe and tasted delicious.  I used Cod instead and it was yummy.

Delicious!!  This can be pretty spicy & that's exactly how my family likes it.  I couldn't find tomatillos in my local supermarket and used mini tomatoes on the vine instead and I served it over jasmine rice. So superb that it was requested for dinner again tonight.

I've never seen basa fillets at the store so I made this with regular catfish. I made the tomatillo sauce the night before, and added the lime juice (a whole lime's worth). I strained it all through a sieve as Husband doesn't like bits of tomatillo skin. This was a very easy and flavorful meal. Thanks!

This was unbelievably delicious!  Next time I may try a different fish, or even try it with chicken, just to see what happens, but it's perfect the way it is as well.  If you like tomatillos, you will LOVE this.  If you don't know if you like tomatillos, TRY THIS!  My 8 year old asked for 3rds! (I pared the jalepenos WAY down for the kiddos). Will make this again and again...very healthy as well, and took no time at all!  TRY THIS RECIPE NOW!

I made this dish, the basa fillets in tomatillo sauce, i  I used the small tomatillos. At first it was bitter, but when you pour the sauce onto the fish it evens out. this dish was pretty good, i'd make it again.

I used Mahi Mahi because it was waiting to be cooked and it was still wonderful.  I also didn't broil the fish because I used the wrong starting pan and didn't feel like adding to the dish cleaning load.  I baked the fish in my Corningware and it did just fine.  Yummmy!

This is a good, solid recipe. I ran out of fresh garlic so had to use dried garlic instead, replaced the long grain with brown, omitted the bouillon and salt (sticking to a low-salt diet), but followed everything else. The flavors are too similar to that of the Tomatillo Soup recipe (made it a few days ago, actually prefer it over the fish!) for me to call it spectacular... but nonetheless a very healthy and tasteful dish!

This was fantastoc! The flavors were so fresh and clean. I used regular catfish because that's what I had on hand, but I know where I can get Basa and I'm really excited to try it. I only used one jalapeno and it was the perfectg amount of spice. My boyfriend really likes recipes that stay away from butter and cream, so this was right up his alley. Thanks for this one!

I am not a huge fish fan, but with this recipe it really brings out the flavors that complimented the sauce and spices. It was incredible.

This is a fabulous and really easy recipe. I did not have access to the Basa fillets, so I used talapia fillets, and it turned out really well. The sauce is terrific, and I know we'll use it for other dishes as well. My husband loves this dish, and we will definitely have it again!

A new favorite!  I just had plain white rice (the extra salt isn't needed). And coated the fish in flour, parm cheese, S&P and garlic and lightly fried them in olive oil.  Delish!

I was really physced by the concept of the tomatillo sauce...but after I tasted it was very disappointed.  Added the juice of a whole lemon and 2 T. chopped cilantro.  Served with blackend red snapper and it became very acceptable with the changes.  Lemon and cilantro are highly recommended as are your choices of other herbs.  Needs personal touchs...

Super delicious! My husband isn’t the biggest fan of tomatillos but he really enjoyed this. I use tilapia, one of our favorites!

I basically followed the recipe. (per other reviews) I coated catfish in blackening seasoning a little bit of fish fry mix and sautéed till browned and removed from the pan. Then browned the onion and garlic...followed by a spicy homemade tomatillo sauce that we like. Returned the fish back to the pan till warmed. I served this over Lime Cilantro Rice from this site and made refried black beans for the side. It was fantastic topped with cilantro and red onions! I do love cilantro!

Only thing i added was 2 table spoons of sugar to the tomatillo in the blender. Mine were a little too tart for my liking. This is a fantastic quick and inexpensive meal.

I already had cooked rice on hand so this review is for the fish.  I had catfish fillets which worked well and I had a green tomatillo salsa that I used with a few dashes of El Pato jalapeno sauce for a kick. So my recipe was quite simplified but I think very yummy.  My husband was skeptical because he only likes catfish after it has been breaded, but he said it was good.  I still think there could've been a few more flavors???

This recipe is Amazing!! My sister loved it even more.  I only had two filets so I followed amt for 2  however in future i would use half the amount of salt taste then add accordingly. Since I was worried about saltiness I doubled sauce and used on chix following same instructions. I started not realizing i didnt have all ingredients so I substituted green onion and used cilantro cube that I stirred into sauce. Baked on 350 till breasts were almost done then turned on broiler and let juice aand sauce reduce and it was just as good. I used chix breasts from costco 
that are done in oven freezer to table in 15min so it didnt take long.Will be keeping in rotation.

I skipped the rice and used tilapia instead of basa, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Overall, it is a really tasty and interesting dish. The tomatillo sauce was crisp and tangy and tasted great with the fish, but I thought it was a little too watery and will try to thicken it up next time so it adheres to the fish better.
