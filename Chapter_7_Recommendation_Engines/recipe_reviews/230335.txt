This is a very good yet simple tasting stew. I've made it many times when out of town guests were coming but arrival time was not certain. It has always been a hit with everyone I've served. I've made it with tomato juice and V-8. Both were good but V-8 seems to add more flavor as I suspected it would. The original recipe I used in years past had you add potato wedges for only the last hour. This time I followed the recipe and added them at the beginning. It doesn't seem to make a difference either way. I worried these would be overcooked but they were not. Thank you for sharing this!

I've been making this for years and my mom for years before me. I use baby carrots, baby reds 1 celery stalk, 1 med onion and three lbs stew meat. Inexpensive meat works great it will turn out tasty and tender after 5 hours in the oven. I also use lots of garlic  and pepper and a couple splashes of Worcestershire sauce.

Made a  few changes, since I didn't have V-8 juice. I used vegetable broth which I added a can of diced tomatoes and used a stick blender to combine.  Also I added a beef bouillon cube and it turned out delicious.

My family liked this stew. I was out of tapioca so I tossed the beef with 1/4 cup flour with salt and pepper and I just forgot about the sugar. It stilled turned out great!

Made it exactly how the directions stated and it was delicious. Next time I make it, I'll brown the beef beforehand and try the Worcestershire sauce addition as others have mentioned.

I used a couple of bags of frozen "stew" blend (onion, celery, potato, carrot) vegetables and used double the amount or granulates instant tapioca.  Thank you so much for sharing, this was always one of my favorites, my mom used to make it when I was little. Just as I good as I remember it!
