The meatballs were delicious. However, the sauce/gravy was disappointing. I expected a sauce that was more the consistency of gravy. It was not even close to that. Also, even though I tempered the yogurt with 1/4 cup of the liquid from the crock pot when I added it back to the crock pot it curdled some. It was also hard to mix the tempered yogurt to the crock pot and mix it in with the meatballs in the crock pot.
I might make the meatballs again. However, I would try different choices for the sauce/gravy.

I followed the recipe for the most, cut the quantity in half and used Beyond Meat. The sauce was thin at the end of the cook time, so I added milk with a bit of corn starch to thicken....but the bold flavor was lost so I threw in a bit more of steak sauce and veg. beef broth flavor...eventually just dumped sauce and balls (Greek yogurt already tempered into the sauce...) in the pan that I just drained the cooked pasta from...brought that to a good boil to properly thicken.  And then, it was better. Really good flavor but not the best outcome for me in the slow cooker...but probably will do again even if I have to thicken the sauce after work. It seems worth the extra effort.

This came out pretty good. I did make some slight alterations: instead of ground beef, I've used ground turkey. I've swapped beef base with a turkey stock.  Since I didn't have any allspice, I've made an alternate with cinnamon/ground cloves/nutmeg. And since I didn't have steak sauce, I've used soy sauce as an alternate. The sauce came out pretty good too.  I've made it with egg noodles and will use rice with the leftovers.

I wasn't sure I would like this because of the oatmeal in it. However, it just blended into the rest of the ingredients and I couldn't even tell. It was wonderful. The gravy was soooo good.

I did make the recipe and my Swedish husband loved it. After cooking on high for 2 hrs. the gravy seemed a little too thin.  I removed the cooked meatballs from the crock pot leaving just the gravy and then thickened the gravy using a slurry of 1 tablespoon corn starch and a little water. Will definitely make this again.

We liked it!  I used ground turkey instead of beef as we are not big red meat eaters.   Also, I used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of beef bullion and water.   I used the slow cook function on our Instant Pot.   Will definitely add this to the list of meals that I can make as I prefer baking to cooking.
