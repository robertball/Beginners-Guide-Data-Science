I have no doubt this bread would be delicious prepared exactly as the recipe directs. But with a few (okay a lot of) changes this became extraordinary.  My amendments: 2 T. rather than 1/3 c. sugar – I don’t want my savory breads sweet.  I didn’t peel the zucchini – why throw away color and nutrition?  I doubled the Parmesan and used the good stuff.  Rather than butter or margarine I used pure (not extra virgin) olive oil which not only ensured moistness but was a fitting flavor for this bread too.  I also added some things that made this heartier and more robustly flavored – some fresh ground pepper, a good-sized clove of garlic, minced, and a couple of tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley, oregano and basil.  I thought some chopped, roasted red pepper would be nice so I added 1/3 cup. It was wonderful, adding a punch of color and even more flavor that complemented all the other ingredients. The aroma was so wonderful as this was baking it made my mouth water, and a person walking in my kitchen could only wonder what glorious dish was cooking!  The finished bread did not disappoint – it’s a beautiful, golden and good-sized loaf.  The flecks of zucchini and roasted red pepper were apparent before I even cut into it, and to show it off I brushed the warm bread with melted butter. This bread exceeded my expectations taste-wise as well.  The flavors all come together to produce something so magnificent that when I make this again it will be exactly as I made it today.

The recipe could use more flavouring as I found it a bit bland. I liked it better warm with butter spread on it. Thanks for the recipe.

Dee-lish!  I added lots more Parmesan cheese than what was called for; it seemed you could barely detect it with just 3T.  I also omitted the onion and added some garlic powder instead.  This is incredibly yummy, even out of the oven.  Recipe says to peel the zucchini; I didn't, because I thought it would make it more eye appealing if I left it 'untouched'. Instead of sugar, I opted for Splenda, and reduced the amount to slightly less than 1/3 cup.

Totally different from your usual sweet zuchinni bread, but quite good, especially warm with butter and garlic salt.  My 5 y.o. ate 3 pieces.  I used frozen, thawed zucchini, and added the liquid to the liquid ingredients.  The bread was very moist; next time I would only add about half of the zucchini    "juice".  It baked an extra 5 or 10 minutes, but came out very well.  Oh, I did leave out the onions and used onion powder instead, as I wasn't sure how the kids would do with onion pieces.

This was very nice, but after reading the reviews I did make a few slight changes (thus only 4 stars).  I probably doubled the parmesan, decreased the sugar by about half (3 T), and used about 1/4 c onion and sauteed it in a bit of olive oil with 1 clove of minced garlic. It turned out quite good, but I think next time I might add 1 t of dried basil just to give it a bit more "zip".  Thanks for a good starting point.

This is a very good bread. It would be great with garlic, and hot out of the oven with real butter was the way it was best.

I wasn't sure about this recipe but I have a lot of zucchini for my father-in-law's garden. I'm so glad I tried it. Of course, my husband was the guinea pig & he really liked it. In fact, he asked for a piece for breakfast this morning.I followed the recipe exactly & the only thing I would change is to maybe add a little more zucchini. The savoriness is a nice change from the same ole boring sweetness of regular zucchini bread. I think that I might try making toast with it this afternoon, for a little snack. Yum!

Nice change from the usual sweet taste of zucchini bread.  I took the suggestion of adding more parmesan and it was REALLY good, especially toasted.

Very good bread! A true bread indeed.  Not sweet or fruity.  Goes wonderful with soup.

I have made this recipe about 6 times, but only made it once following the directions.  I now add 1/3 c parmesan, 1/4 c grated onion, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 3/4 tsp Italian seasoning.  The original recipe is good, but this is such an easy, basic recipe to add to that I couldn't resist.  I love making this bread when I make soup; it is a heavy and filling bread.  Great with real butter!

I made half of this recipe and used a mini loaf pan.  I deviated from the recipe as a number of other reviewers.  Here’s what I did for my half recipe:  I used 3 T. of the parmesan cheese, did not peel the zucchini, cut the sugar back to 1T., added 1/2 t. garlic powder and subbed 1/2 t. onion powder for the grated onion.  I also added a small 2 oz. jar of pimentos, well drained.  This produced a beautiful little loaf and a tasty one as well.  I loved the idea of a savory zucchini bread and will definitely make this again.  I’m anxious to try it toasted!

I love this recipe! The zucchini in our garden has gone bonkers this year, and I needed new ways to use the zucchini.  This is my favorite!  I do add more parmesan.  I have frozen it, and it thaws out nicely.  Excellent.

Very good!  It was very dry however, so I had to add water to it during the second knead cycle.  It also kind of collapsed during baking, so the end result was not very pretty but it more than made up for its looks with its taste.

What a nice change from the traditional sweet zucchini bread!  I made as directed but didn't bother peeling the zucchini, and I left out the onion.  This has a delicate flavor, and I think it will pair well with many different things for that reason.  I will be making this again.

Very Good! I did add about double parmesan, because I love it! The texture was also very good, especially considering it's a quickbread. Great alternative for sweet zucchini bread when you have a garden full!

This is a great loaf to incorporate lots of your favourite herbs and different cheeses. I didnt find that the parmesan or zucchini had dominant flavours. I willl try it again with shredded cheddar. I had some leftover dry dip seasoning and threw that in. As others suggested I cut the sugar to only a couple of TBSP and used olive oil in place of butter.
**Dont peel the zucchini..it adds nice colour**

Delicious! I just made this for the first time. I had no onions or onion powder, but I used garlic (which I suggest if you're a garlic lover). I wanted it a bit less sweet, so I cut the sugar in half, but I suspect it would be just as tasty with the sugar amount suggested. I paired it with sliced ham and cheddar cheese (light splash of mayo) for the most delicious ham sandwich I may have ever eaten. Highly suggested!

Excellent savory bread! I followed another reviewer and added more cheese and flavor: 1/3 cup Parmesan & mozzarella, 1 tsp garlic powder, 3/4 tsp Ital seasoning. Next time I think I will use slightly less sugar than listed.

Delicious! I made this with the zucchini Rice Casserole and it was great! Even my 3 year olds loved this. The only thing I did different than the original recipe was to add a bit more parmesan cheese.

A delish twist on zucchini bread. Thanks for sharing
