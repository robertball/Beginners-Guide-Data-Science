I made this a couple of weeks ago.  These were good for the first few days then FREAKING INCREDIBLE after that.  

The color combined with the crispy texture and yummy taste made these a HUGE hit with my family.  I am now going to can 6 pint jars of these.  

HUGE HIT!!

I loved these.  Wanted to try a partial batch before committing to a full jar.  Wishing I'd have made the full recipe.  Easy enough to make more.  I used them on pork carnitas. Will be good with so many things!
