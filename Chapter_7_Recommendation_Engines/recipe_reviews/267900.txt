I added a 1/8 cup of Stevia just because we like it a bit sweeter. Delicious recipe. The kids loved it.

This has quickly become a favorite in our house.  I swapped coconut oil for the butter and added 1/2 cup Splenda.   Great recipe.

Just got done making this. Family has 1/2 gone.Love it's not loaded with sugars. Doubling the next batch. Added 1 c shelled chopped Pistachios. Great flavor, not overly sweet like store bought. Making again..
