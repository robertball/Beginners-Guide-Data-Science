Update - Made again for dinner (in a skillet again) and husband said he prefers these to beef burgers.  I do make the patties ahead of time and put back in the refrigerator until time to cook.  That seems to help them stay together a little better.  Awesome!!  Loved these burgers!  I made the recipe as is only cooked them in a skillet on the stove.  They were juicy and very flavorful.  Will definitely make again.

These are very good, but just eyeballing the recipe you could tell there was just too much liquid here.  That's probably why so many people had trouble with these forming and falling apart on the grill. These are similar to Ranch burgers from this site.  I used 1 oz. of ranch mix for a little over a pound of ground turkey, 1 tsp. of dried minced onion, 1 clove of minced garlic, 1/2 tsp. of onion powder, and 1/4 c. of bread crumbs.  I mixed these and then let them set in the fridge for an hour.  This helps them to set and for the flavors to come through.  No problems on the grill and they had a very nice ranch flavor.

A solid twist on a turkey burger.  It came out a little bit messy so I added some plain breadcrumbs to help bind it together.  I cooked mine on a George Foreman and they came out nice and juicy.  The only thing lacking I feel is some sort of kick.  Maybe some finely chopped jalapenos would be good.

This is a great turkey burger!  We did add about 1/4 cup of plain breadcrumbs to hold them together.  Grilled them on the George Foreman and they turned out great.  I loved the ranch flavor and there was plenty of garlic without having it take over the burger.

Very good. Added less than a 1/4 cup of plain bread crumbs to 1.25 lbs. ground turkey and used just shy of a 1/4 cup of worceshire sauce and they turned out great. I ended up using my panini press to cook them because it started to rain hard when the time came. I bet they're even better on the grill.

These were really yummy. I, too, cooked them on the stove in some olive oil. The only addition I made was adding a seeded jalapeno and some red pepper flakes for a little kick.

The flavor was good but the mixture was not firm. I refrigerated the patties for a few hours before cooking but they still fell apart while cooking. I think the next time I make them, I will add some plain bread crumbs to stiffen the mixture slightly. Otherwise the taste was very good and definitely a keeper.

Pretty great taste; however, very messy to cook.  Next time I will add some bread crumbs to give it some molding texture!  Great weeknight meal served with fries :)

Their is to much liquid . The patties wouldn't form so I had to put breadcrumbs in it. The end result was nice and tender, but tasted like meatloaf.

Really Good! I used 1.25 lbs of turkey, and added 1/4 cup bread crumbs. Grilled them on an outdoor grill, and right before I pulled them off, I put sliced red onion on top, covered with a peice of cheese to melt. Delicious!

Used 20oz white meat turkey, 2T (2/3 1oz pkg ranch mix), 2T worcestershire & 2T minced onion (not really enough).  Added a half cup of cheese to improve appearance once browned & add a little crunch.  Toasted insideonly of buns, a little mayo, slice of cheddar, fresh jalepeno slices.  VERY GOOD.  Tried just the burger, eh.  I'll try again with the whole package, make a mini one & decide about the worcestershire increase.  Definately worth trying.  I made eight & froze them for half an hour.  Pancooked on medium till white edges.  Turned over & increased to medium high.  Anxious to try again!  TRY 2:  Increased onion to 1/4c, full pkg ranch, 3T worcestershire.  Good news & bad:  Loved them with cheddar & toppings.  Very plain & tasteless without, not even salty.  Maybe it's the extra four ounces of turkey.  Either way, I sure liked them.  Just won't be having naked - without toppings :)

These had a wonderful flavor to them but as the recipe is written there's way way too much liquid. Ended up adding about a 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, which I was trying to avoid doing. May use cheddar cheese as the binder next time.

These were fabulous.  I served them at a grill out and everyone was asking for the recipe. The only thing I did differently was to add some bread crumbs to the mix to help it bind together.  These were the best turkey burgers I have ever had.

Absolutely LOVED this Turkey Burger, However, I did 2 pounds of ground white meat turkey, did a little bread crumbs, 6 garlic cloves minced and 1/3 cup of Worcestershire sauce.  I also added some Cajun seasoning and fresh cracked pepper.  I put sauteed spinach, mushrooms, and Provolone cheese on top. Used wheat buns. LOVED IT SO MUCH!!!!! a KEEPER.

I wish I had used the original recipe.I followed the suggestions and added 1/3 c. breadcrumbs and some chopped onion.My son grilled them outdoors and since he doesn't eat much read meat I thought these would be perfect for our lunch. They didn't stick at all or fall apart but they were tasty but very dry...again I wish I had followed the original recipe...next time I will.

I read all of the reviews first, so I decided to ditch the mess and make a meat loaf type dish. I used 20 oz of very lean turkey and kept the rest of the ingredients the same, putting some onions on the top before baking. Bake it at 350 for abour 45 min. Hey, it wasn't burgers, but it made a killer turkey loaf.

I have made these for a long time. I grill them on a flat slotted grill type pan to keep together. I use 1/4 crumbled gorgonzola cheese and a little less hidden valley ranch mix and only a dash of worcheschire. Lower sodium content and they stay delish.

These turned out very juicy and tasty and I even used the all white meat ground turkey breast which is even leaner so tends to be drier.  I wanted to perk up the recipe a bit and bought the Hidden valley ranch Zesty packet instead of the traditional one and it definitely added a nice zing without being too spicey. This is a keeper.

Good but definitely needs additional binder.  I had 20 oz. pkgs of ground turkey, so I used 2/3 cup bread crumbs and 2 eggs (wasn't going to attempt half an egg).  Doesn't need the additional s/p.  Will definitely make this again - was a big hit with the kids.

Excellent- used the George Foreman grill- whole wheat buns- kids devoured them. They are ranch lovers anyway. A keeper!

Delicious!! I did what some of the others did I added chopped onion & garlic, bread crumbs. I seasoned the meat with seasonings & used a little less amount of 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce so the mixture won't have a lot of liquid & cooked on the stove in a pan. I have made these several times so flavorful, love them!

I liked this recipe but did a couple small changes. We don't do much bread so I put in quick oatmeal in place of that, enough to make them form better. I added chopped fresh mushrooms and some whole flax seed I had laying around. Excellent! I made mini burgers and topped them with a slice of American cheese. (We ate them without bread). Loved it! Quick & easy! Fried in pan with Olive Oil.

I enjoyed these, though I found they were a little too salty, and I omitted adding any extra salt. Next time, I will cut back on some of the ingredients.

Lots of flavor.  I didn't add egg to the recipe, I never add egg or bread crumbs, it changes the consistency too much.  I just mold the patties, then let them sit in the fridge for about half an hour.

Not quite sure what to think.  Was very excited for this recipe, when it was being grilled it smelled sooooo good.  But one we bit into them, it just didn't pack the punch of as much flavor as we expected.  I added some bread crumbs since the mixture was very runny and not as formable as beef.  The texture was too meatloaf-y, probably due to the egg and breadcrumbs. However, as my husband said - it wasn't the worst thing I've made.  Probably won't use as burgers, but into meatballs next time.

These were good.  I served with a bunch of other meat at a bbq today, and while they aren't all gone, pple really seemed to enjoy them.  We really did have a lot of meat!  I didn't add the egg because they really are plenty moist without it, and they stuck together just fine.  I made them this morning and stuck them in the fridge, so that could have helped; however, I am positive if I'd added the egg I would've had to add bread crumbs like other reviewers and I didn't feel like doing that.  They were great without all that.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very, very good--whole family liked this one.  I did decrease worcestershire to 1 TBS and added 1/4 c. seasoned panko bread crumbs.  I let them chill in the fridge for about 10 minutes prior to grilling and the came out perfectly.

Okay it was waaaaaaay too much ranch seasoning, even without the egg the burgers were falling apart and the ranch just overpowered the burgers, the only thing that I liked was the burger was tender. If I try it again I will use half the Worcestershire and half the ranch as well as adding the bread crumbs and see how it comes out.

Great quick healthy recipe! I used 98% fat free turkey and eggs whites instead of a whole egg. As suggested by others, I added bread crumbs. Topped them off with low-fat swiss cheese and used light buns. They were nice and juicy. Will definitely make again!

These were great! I doubled and added a little minced onion as well as the garlic. The strongest flavor was the Worcestershire sauce, so if you do not like that flavor I'd add a little less. I ate them over a salad with no bun and they were perfect for it.

Overall, a great recipe, but needed a couple of tweaks.  Had to add a bunch of bread crumbs to make the mix hold together, and next time I will add some grated onion and perhaps some chili flakes for kick.

Very yummy! I read the other reviews and added about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. They formed well and tasted great. I made sliders and topped them with spinach, tomato, avocado and a spicy mayo sauce. My 2 year old ate 2!

We loved these burgers! I left out the egg (reminds me of meat loaf) and added the Worcestershire sauce a little at a time to make sure it didn't get too wet to make patties. I cooked mine on the skillet and they did not fall apart. They were so good and juicy. Will be making again for sure!

I use the ranch packet, a 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs, 1 egg, 1/4 cup chopped onion, 1 tbs garlic powder. I then cook the patties in the broiler on high for 10-15  minutes each side. They come out perfect every time.

Nice flavor. I only put a couple of shakes of the Worcesteshire sauce and did not add additional salt. I also added 3 tbsp of bread crumbs to the turkey mixture. Placed in the freezer till firm and then grilled. Delish and did not fall apart.

The flavor was great, but these burgers fell apart instantly on the grill.  I followed the recipe, but added 1/4 cup breadcrumb, as others suggested.  We ended up having to move them from a grill to a pan inside because they were disintigrating.  My husband managed to keep them together, but it was tough.  These are missing something...

The worcestershire sauce gave this a nice flavor but they fell apart when grilling, even though I used about 1/2 c of bread crumbs and set them in the fridge for several hours.  I'm going to continue looking for a recipe or design my own.

For taste alone this recipe would be 4 1/2 stars, however, the texture of this recipe is very moist and both times I have made it, they have fallen apart. So my overall rating is 3 stars. I also used frozen turkey that I thawed, I don't know if that would affect outcome or not. The last attempt was at our cookout. I doubled the recipe, only used one egg for 2.3 lbs and still they fell apart on grill, but go complements on the flavor! I think next time, I will go less on the worcestershire sauce instead, and see if the less amount of liquid allows the egg to hold the burger together better. Just wondering how the delicious flavor will be affected at that point.

I also added breakcrumbs and some parmesan cheese to this recipe due to the consistency and these came out wonderful.  I reduced the garlic as well - only used 1 clove for 4 burgers.  Will make this one again.  My kids even asked for more!

As the recipe is, I got all the ingredients together and the mix was really wet. So, I added 1/4 c. each of parmesan cheese and whole wheat bread crumbs. That firmed it up enough so I could cook them. When we tried them, my husband and I didn't care for them at all but our kids loved them. Our littlest who can be a bit picky ate almost two on his own, and he's four. I don't think I'll be making this again. It just wasn't a whole family pleaser. NOTE: I did use half of a batch of Scotdog's dry ranch dressing mix. I don't use packaged ranch dressing to avoid the salt content.

I read a lot of the reviews and they really helped! I used 1/2 the amount of Worchestshire sauce, left out the egg and added 1/3 cup bread crumbs (italian flavored becuase it's what I had) and about a tablespoon of dried onions.  The family all loved it and requested it to be made again....that's definatley a winner in my book!

I enjoed the flavor of these, I used a 20 ounce pack of ground turkey and made 5 burgers. Yes it is salty even with 20 ounces, but I love salt so this was fine for me. The only thing I'll add next time is some diced onions.. I find adding diced onions to ground turkey helps keep it moister

Tried these burgers this weekend!  They were really very good!  I forgot to add the Worcestershire sauce and didn't realize it until I started to review this recipe, I don't know if I could stand the sauce as they were outstanding without it, next time I will add the sauce and hope I don't swoon from enjoyment!  This recipe is the answer to hubby being able to eat burgers again, for some reason the men in my family can't eat ground beef anymore, so this is the perfect solution!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were SO good.  At the suggestion of others,  added about 1/4 c. of bread crumbs (italian style) and a dash of paprika.  The hubs and I thought these were DELICIOUS, even though they did fall apart a bit while cooking.  I have no idea how to fix that, but it's worth experimenting.  These were not dry at all, very juicy and yummy.  The texture was different than beef, softer, but not in a bad way.  I prepared them in a skillet, just because I don't have a grill!  I've never made turkey burgers, but we just may be converts.  Thanks big j! :)

this did not go over well, I made as is, the burgers actually stick together pretty well, but I thought the taste of the ranch was WAY too overpowering,  if I made this again I would use half a packet of the ranch dressing and maybe 1/8 cup of worcestershire sauce.

Very delicious recipe! It was a little difficult to make as the mixture was very runny. I would probably leave the egg out next time so the meat holds together mores. Very yummy topped with cheese slices and jalapenos!

Very salty, too soggy. I used a lot of Panko crumbs to hold it together, maybe cut back on the Worchester. I don't think it needed salt. It definitely would have fallen apart had I not added the crumbs. Can't say I would make this recipe again as there are too many other ones to try. Actually thought the flavor really came through better as they cooled.

We enjoyed these, good for your "different" kind of burger but don't know if I am going to run out and get the ingredients because I just "have" to have them again soon.  However!... I will probably make again for when we want a little bit of a change from the "basic" burger... Thanks

I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand.  Followed recipe to the letter, and added some Italian breadcrumbs to help hold mixture together.  A quick, easy, flavorful dinner.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I preferred the few forks-full I tried on the side, alone without the hamburger bun.  I'm going to make it into a turkey meatloaf next time, and add some onions, maybe a little co-jack cheese.  Yum!

I read the reviews and was worried that these burgers would not come out. Well, I had no need to worry. They were great. It is the first time I have had or made turkey burgers so I was skeptical from the beginning.   I think the reason people are having problems is not because of what it calls for but the type of turkey they are using. Frozen is probably no good and each brand probably has a different consistency. I used fresh ground turkey breast from my local grocery store.  I did use less worcestershire sauce because 1/4 cup is way to much for me. I also cooked them on my griddle from the fridge. I had no breaking up or falling apart. I think they would have been fine on the grill but I didn't want to take the chance of ruining dinner.  They tasted like regular burgers.I will definatly make these again.

This was a really good recipe.  I felt like the burgers tasted like the buffalo we usually have.  My husband felt like it was too much worschestershire.  I only added 1/8 cup too.  Next time I will use like 1 tbsp.  I also addded some bread crumbs.  I did add some shredded cheese on top too.  I will definately make again.

This recipe really seemed to score high with most, unfortunately it fell short for me. The burgers smelled amazing, I'll give them that much, but they were so difficult to cook! I'm not sure what I was doing wrong, but even after adding 3/4c. of breadcrumbs, my burgers were falling through the grates on my grill! We decided to take them inside and try to pan fry them, but they were too crumbly. As a last ditch attempt we tried baking them in the oven. The edges were dry and crunchy, but the middles were smushy. When you took a bite it felt like you were eating a raw burger. I saw that a reviewer used it as taco meat, I wish I would have thought of that.

This is a yummy recipe. Pretty basic, but very easy and a fairly quick meal to put together. I was expecting it to have a little bit more flavor with a burger that had garlic and ranch in it but it was still good. Next time I think I'll add more garlic and try using fresh diced onion instead of dried minced onion. I did add some italian breadcrumbs and cooked my burgers on my George Foreman Grill. They didn't fall apart!

i read all the reviews and thought wow bread crumbs worded for some... well they didn't work for me. maybe it would have been better is i had an indoor grill but they fell apart on the grates. I ended up like the others having taco meat with it. i was sad. i hope some one redoes this recipe to make it work.

Made it as written, without the breadcrumbs.  Yes after you add the egg it seems to fall apart. Mix it, make the patties, put them in the fridge for a couple hours and you should be good to go.

Very good turkey burgers - but definitely add the breadcrumbs (I used 1/4 cup, could have done a tad more).  They were moist and very flavorful!

Wow, these were the best turkey burgers yet.  My only criticism is I found them to be a bit salty, but I'm thinking it's just my taste buds.  Wondering if I cut back on the worchestshire sauce if that would reduce the salt?

I followed the recipe exactly!  The burgers were mush!  A huge waste of good ingredients!!! I thought 1/4 cup of worstershire sounded like way too much but was busy talking to the family and added it anyways!! What was I thinking??  My second mistake was by not reading the reviews (like a normally do)!!    I still think this recipe sounds good and will probably try it again but will back off of the worstershire for sure!!!

I wanted to like this burger. It had a good taste but did not hold up very well. I did use some bread crumbs to hold this together like some other reviewers but it did not help. I ended up crumbling them up and adding a little water and taco seasoning to use to make tacos. The next time I will leave out the egg and use only 1 tbs of worstershire sauce then review it again.

This is the second time I make these and I love them and so does my family! I noticed in the reviews people were saying that the patties are too wet and fall apart so I put half of the Worcestershire sauce it called for and I made my patties and cooked them immediately and I didn’t have a problem with them falling apart! I highly recommend this recipe!!

I made this without the egg as more of a casserole.  Trying to avoid the carb in the bread so I used ground turkey breast with lower fat.  I added green beans and a small can of crushed pineapple and topped it with a few raw walnut pieces for healthy fat and crunch.  Delicious.  
You could add shredded carrots for sweetness instead of pineapple but I'm just getting ready to try that.

going into this recipe i knew i'd have to make some alterations based on what i had on hand and based on what other reviewers said.. i increased the serving size to 6 and used Dry Ranch Style Seasoning for Dip or Dressing (from this site) for the premade packet.. i was out of fresh garlic so i subbed 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.. i reduced the worcestershire to 1 T and didn't add any extra seasoned salt or pepper.. also left out the egg.. i felt like the garlic was overwhelming.. but then again i didn't use fresh as instructed.. i think using the full amount of worcestershire (6 T for 6 servings) would have made this a super soggy mess like others complained about.. so i'm glad i went with my gut.. unfortunately this was only okay

I've been trying to get my boyfriend into turkey burgers, so I wanted the burger to be flavorful but not hide the fact that it was a turkey burger. I left out the worcestershire sauce out and the fresh garlic. I kept the one packet of ranch and added about 3 shakes of parsley, 2 or 3 shakes of garlic salt, and 1-3 shakes of onion powder. I cooked them in a skillet on the stove at medium heat, about 5-6 minutes on each side, making sure to brown them a little. I want to try grilling them next time. They were really tasty! Boyfriend approved! 
[made them with just little over a pound of ground turkey, made 5 good sized patties.]

I was really looking forward to impressing my stay away from turkey burgers husband. I was sooooo disappointed when I followed the suggestions to add breadcrumbs and they COMPLETELY fell apart on the grill. The taste was fantastic and the hubby liked them but he is still leary of the turkey burger since it didn't hold together.  I'll try again with a little less liquid.

I followed the suggestions to add bread crumbs and to refrigerate before cooking and they crumbled to bits.  Flavor was ok, quite strong but it was not a keeper for me.  Perhaps cooking on the stove top rather than a grill is the answer.

This is my first time with this recipe.  I decided to try it because I had all the ingredients.  I followed it exactly, with the addition of 1/4 panco to stabilize the mix.  Here is my tip: Use your cast iron skillet!  Preheat the skillet under the broiler on high while you mix and chill the burgers (approx. 20 min.)  Form the individual patties, then spray the tops with veg. oil spray.  Place them, sprayed side down, onto your pre heated skillet, then broil for approx. 5 min.  this cooks both sides at the same time, so no flipping!  I added Munster cheese, and topped with fresh sliced avocado and romaine lettuce.  I will make this again, but will decrease the worcestershire sauce.

Really liked these, but they practically fell apart on the grill.  I was lucky enough to get some cheese on them before scooping them onto buns which helped a bit, but it definitely needs a little extra to bind it together.  Regardless, the flavor was very good and I'll definitely make these again, albeit maybe adding some bread crumbs or something.

Do not use the ground turkey in the tube! Use fresh ground turkey. The stuff in a tube is too mushy. If you make the mistake of using it add some bread crumbs a little at a time. This should help. I made enough for 8 servings. So i used the  4serving method but u have to use two ranch dressing packs.

I made the recipe almost as written…. 1 1/2 t garlic powder instead of minced garlic.   I cooked them in a non-stick skillet with a little grape seed oil.   They stuck together and were delicious.  I did not add any extra salt and we felt it did not need it.

This was too salty. The sauce also made it hard for the burgers to stick together on the grill, they were kind of soupy. If I make these again, it may just be with the ranch packet and some cheese. That's it.

Very good!  Like other reviewers I added 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs.   This is more like a meatloaf; but, if you are cooking burgers to be reheated the next day, this is not a bad thing.  My only complains is that it is a bit salty.  I love salt, so if I think it is salty, ther people might find it to be overkill.  Next time I might try reducing the Worcester and ranch by a smidge to see if that helps.  This might be nice with a spicy kick as others have mentioned.  If you like spicy food, maybe try adding a 1/8 tsp of cayaned, red pepper flakes or jalapeños.

Amazing, so much flavor!  I am a novice cook, and a picky eater but this was super easy and delicious.  I followed the ingredients exactly, and made it on a Foreman grill.  I read that other people had trouble with them coming apart, but I formed the patty between two pieces of wax paper since I hate touching raw meat, and once I got it on the grill it was fine.  It was great with provolone cheese and some olive oil mayo.

Very good!  Had to add some Italian breadcrumbs to hold the meat together.

Really good- I took some of the advice of others- added breadcrumbs, red pepper flakes.Pan fried with olive oil. Also served with sauted onions and red pepper. My husband went back for seconds.

I added 1/3 cup of bread and crumbs and they were still a little too moist.  They were still tasty, I broiled them and served them with mayo, shredded carrots and sliced cucumbers and muenster cheese.  Will make again!

These burgers are delicious! I did find that they did not need much additional seasoning salt, they were salty enough.  A great alternative to the classic beef burger. I will be making them again.

This is a great version of a turkey burger!!  I have made them twice on the george forman grill, and they turned out great both times.  The only change I made was to leave out the egg.    They are great with guacamole and sauted onions too!

I really liked the mixture of flavors in this recipe. I used Ranch Dressing, rather then the dry packets.  I think the only thing that did was make it more "mushy" and therefore I had to add more bread crumbs then others had suggested.  I also made mine in a 9X9 pan rather then into burgers.  I don't think that made it very visually appealing and will definitely make them into burgers next time.  With this Iowa winter we've been having this year, I can't get to my BBQ grill like I have in years past.  So this will have to go into my recipe box for nicer weather so I can make them into burgers for sure!

AWESOME! I know this one has mixed reviews, but these were the tastiest burgers I've had in a long time. I do agree the burgers were slightly "goopy", but they cooked wonderfully and tasted INCREDIBLE! I only made a few changes: I didn't add an egg, I used Dale's marinade instead of worcestershire, and I added 1/3 cup of chopped red onions. This will be the only way I cook turkey burgers from now on :)

These were so good! I made them on my george forman grill since its cold and outdoor grilling season is over.  They turned out so moist, my husband was a fan and usually he doesn't like things made with ground turkey! Thank you!!

I made this last night and it turned out pretty tasty, took some other people's advice and added lots of panko bread crumbs to help hold the meat together. I used garlic salt instead of garlic (mostly since I had forgotten to put it in the mix)

These are very tasty, but the recipe produces patties of a goopy consistency that are much too moist to easily grill. I had to place mine in the freezer for a half hour so they would firm up enough to transfer from the platter to the grill. Because of the consistency they took much longer than 5 minutes on a side and broke apart when I tried to turn them, even after leaving the first side on the grill for 10 minutes. You definitely should cut back on the amount of liquid.

I agree with the previous reviewer.  This was not good.  I tried this recipe several times, but no matter what I did, I could not get the burgers to stick together.  I also thought they were EXTREMELY salty.  Nobody liked them much.

We did NOT like this in our house. I didn't use the egg & used about 3 Tbs. of worcestershire sauce. Cooked on grill. A tad dry, very salty. I make another turkey burger recipe that has 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/4 c. real bacon bits, 1 tsp poultry seasoning, 2 Tbsp. real maple syrup. Mix together and grill! Really delicious and moist.

Horray for another healthy ground turkey recipe. I chilled the burgers before putting them on the grill.  I also used my fish/vegetable grilling tray,sprayed with a non-stick cooking spray. This kept the burgers firm and prevented them from falling apart.

Recipe calls for to much Worcestershire sauce.  Mixture came out very wet.  Even after adding a bit more then 1/4 bread crumbs it was still very wet.    I will make it again but this time half the amount of sauce.

I often look for turkey burgers when eating out and have had my share...some good, some bad.  Duffy's in Florida is good.  Anyhow, this recipe is the best.  When all the ingredients were added the texture was hard to form a burger so, I added Italian bread crumbs just so the burgers held together.  Wonderful flavor. A great recipe for someone watching their calories.  Next time I will use a bun and all the trimmings.  Thank you for the recipe.  This will go in my recipe box.

These were awesome!! Full of flavor, I added the breadcrumbs as well, and reduced the worcestershire to a couple of dashes, I made the patties the night before and pan fried them. My whole family loved them. Don't change a thing they are great the way they are.

This was such a horrible mess. Followed recipe exactly and the mixture wouldn't stay together so I tried adding cracker crumbs.I went ahead and cooked them against my better judgement and they did not taste good at all.  Sorry this wasn't good to me.

Really good turkey burger with lots of flavor even by having to cook on the stove. The only drawback was they did not hold together very well so either cut back a bit on the worcestershire sauce or add just a bit of breadcrumbs.

This recipe was great! The whole family liked it. Like others, I added 1/4 cup of bread crumbs. I used Hidden Valley Ranch dip/dressing mix. I did not find the recipe to be overly wet. The consistancy was great for grilling.

I rated the recipe as is, it really does need the 1/4 c. bread crumbs suggested by other reviewers to hold together.  The flavor was really very good!

Fabulous.  Added 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs as suggest by other reviewers, made on stove (medium/high heat, 3-5 minutes per side, then covered for additional 3 minutes).  Will make again and again.

These burgers were a bit overpowering.  Like others, I added some bread crumbs but otherwise followed the recipe.  I will try them again, but next time with 1/2 the amounts of garlic, ranch mix, and Worcestershire sauce called for.

We made these last night and they are delish!  Very flavorful!  My turkey burgers always fall apart/stick on my grill, no matter what I do, so I just started cooking them indoors on the griddle, which works just fine.

The flavor of these is absolutely AMAZING.  I pan fried the burgers and had trouble keeping them together.  I have no idea how these could possibly be put on a grill.  Needs breadcrumbs to hold it all together.

These were really good and flavorful.  I also had to add about a 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to hold them together.  Will make again.

Really enjoyed these! Added slightly more garlic - we love it - and because they were too mushy, put in more breadcrumbs and then transferred to fridge for a couple of hours before grilling.

O.K, I made these tonight and my family loved them.  I had read many comments from others claiming their burgers fell apart and I did not have this trouble.  I too added plain breadcrumbs as a binder, I also wanted to mention that i used the 93/7 ground turkey, no egg,+ the other ingredients--I formed the burgers and then placed them in the fridge for a couple of hours until dinner, brushed the tops w/ olive oil (to keep from sticking to the BBQ)make sure your BBQ is preheated well, Served w/ homemade onion rings.  They were perfect will definately make again, Thanks.

Made these last night on the George Foreman for me and the fella.  Good flavor, easy to make.  The texture was different than a beef burger, may have been the turkey I used.  I took the advice of others and added some bread crumbs.  Topped mine with American cheese and he used  pepperjack. Served with spicy curly fries.  Will probably make again.

I loved these turkey burgers! I added 1/4 cup breadcrumbs as suggested by other reviewers. I cooked them on the foreman for 4 min. I put a slice of american cheese on the buns and toasted them in the broiler. Then I sliced up veggies and topped it with sliced avocado. I usually feel like turkey burgers are bland, but this is a good way to spice it up. I also used creole seasoning instead of seasoned salt. If you need a meal in a hurry, this is a good one!

Sorry, Big J Rules, but this burger recipe was a flop.  Because of the weather, we made these on our indoor grate and honestly, if we hadn't the burgers would have fallen right through the grill grates and onto the charcoal.  I took other user's advice and added extra breadcrumbs, and our burgers fell apart and leaked into the crevices of our indoor grill and burned even on medium heat anyways.  And as liquidy as they were, the more they cooked, they turned crumbly and dry.  An absolute bomb and a waste of food.  The flavoring IS a good idea, I will give you that much.  I would skip the egg, halve the worstershire sauce, and add breadcrumbs and maybe have a better result.  An absolute disaster, people.  I truly feel bad giving this rating, I've never given a 1 star out before, but this was totally gross.

I forgot to pick up the ranch dressing at the grocery store so I had some onion soup mix in the cabinet and used that instead.  I also added some chopped black beans and chopped onion.  I thought 3 cloves of garlic was too much for my taste and it was.  Next time I'll use only one.

These are tasty but mine were runny and I ended up making taco meat out of it.  There is no way I could have put them on a bbq grill.  I give it three stars for the taste but I don't think I will be making them again.
