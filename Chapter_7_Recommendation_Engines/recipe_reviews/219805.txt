This recipe is VERY good. I gave it 4 stars just because you need to add a little salt and pepper. Very very good. nice and creamy and you can really taste the apple. YUMMY!!

Fabulous. It didn't need anything else. My first time cooking with an acorn squash and I just loved the simplicity and deliciousness of this recipe.

I made this for a soup-potluck, with a triple recipe. NOTE: you do NOT need 3 sticks of butter to saute the onions and apples. I used 2 sticks, which was more than I needed for them to soften but added a lovely butter taste to the soup. At the end, I added salt, pepper and cinnamon. The soup went over well but there was some left over. When I heated a cup later, I topped it with crushed walnuts. That was a nice addition. I would definitely make this again.

Very very tasty. I made this vegetarian by subbing water for the broth with no noticeable change in flavor. It could be made vegan by subbing oil for the butter. I changed the prep slightly by poking 2 holes in the squash- to let air escape- and then microwaving it for 4 minutes. This made is easier to peel and cut and clean out. I then proceeded as directed.  Hubs likes squash slightly sweeter, so he added 1 teaspoon of honey to his serving. This is a keeper.

I made the vegan version (water for broth and olive oil sub for butter) and was wanting a bit more kick. Flavors were great but a little too subtle for me. I added 1/2 tsp minced ginger 1/2 tsp cinnamon and salt/pepper to taste and it really elevated the flavor. Great simple recipe for fall.

I'll start by saying that I don't love squash, but I keep reading how good the orange veggies are for you, so I decided to try it as a soup.

I really enjoyed it.  The apples lowered the squashiness and gave it just the right added taste.  I appreciate having a soup recipe that doesn't rely on cream for its thickness and delicousness.

Holy cow, this is good! I gave it a four because I added some water to think out the consistency a bit. I also cooked everything together. I started the onions and apples in the butter, then added raw squash cubes and chicken broth, and simmered everything until the squash was tender. Yes, I took my life into my hands peeling that squash! Thanks for the delicious recipe!!!

Excellent. I did add salt, pepper and a pinch of cinnamon and with that addition, it's delicious!  It seems so simple but the flavors blend well. Definitely a keeper.

This soup is delicious!!  I was quite skeptical since it was so simple, but the flavor was amazing.  I mostly followed the recipe, but did everything in one pot.  I used olive oil and about 1 T. of butter instead of 1/2c of butter.  I had to add extra broth while blending because my blender is weak, but the consistency was perfect.  I seasoned with a little kosher salt and pepper when I put it back in the pot.  I served with a swirl of sour cream and chives on top.  It was awesome!!

Both my husband and I loved it! I did add some salt and pepper,  and used only 1 tablespoon of butter and about 1/4 cup of olive oil to cook the onion and apples  to cut the fat. Also, next time I will turn the squash over half way through, 
as one side of the squash cooked more than the other side.  Didn't have a blender,  except a small hand blender and a nutri bullet,  but that worked fine.  Can't wait to make it again!

I was skeptical of this soup (first time I've sauteed onions and apples together) but it was super tasty in the end. I agree with many of the other reviewers that said it could use a little salt and/or pepper, but still a 5 star recipe. I dished out several bowls to tweak a little to experiment and several different variations worked well. A pinch of cinnamon, sugar, and nutmeg was a hit with our family member with the strongest sweet tooth, a bit of ginger powder made a good spicy sinus-opening bowl that I'll make next time we get a cold, but simply adding black pepper to taste was ultimately what everyone preferred today.

Good soup. Not the flavor I was looking for. Not sure if it was onion or apple that was the culprit. Added about 1/4c brown sugar.

YUMMY! I made it as is. it did not make much, but it was quite nice old a cold rainy day. I expect to make it again. I added an extra cup of water to thin it out a bit. I hope no ones else in my house likes it...more for me. ;)

I made it as the recipe directs except that I subbed vegetable oil for about half the butter and I added some garlic and white pepper at the end to give it more of a savory taste than the sweet one it had to start with. I also used Braeburn apples, which I suspect are responsible for a lot of the sweetness--I think that, while the soup doesn't taste "like apples" per se, a lot of those undertones in the type of apple you pick will matter.

It was okay, but I suspect the *kind* of apples you use makes a big difference.  The biggest problem I had is, for me at least, it seemed like a lot of work for the result.

This is so simple to make. We used squash fresh from our garden, it was amazing. We also used a bit more chicken stock than the recipe requires.

Was great. We wanted to stretch the recipe so we added 2 large carrots, an extra cup of chicken broth, 2 tsp. grated ginger, 2 tsp. fresh garlic, salt and pepper.

I love this recipe. It's so delicious, simple to make and warms the house with a wonderful fall smell. I cut the squash into 8 pieces and boiled it in water. Then I removed the skins, mashed and added the chicken stock. It was a faster prep time. I also used the seeds from the squash in the green salad I made to go with the soup. Bake at 200 F for 30 mins, no oil, lightly salted. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!!

I had 4 small acorn squash, so I cooked them whole in the microwave with a sweet potato. I sautéed onion in butter added Apple & 3 small carrots & 1qt. of chicken broth. I cut the squash in half, took out the seeds and scraped the squash from the skin & peeled the sweet potato & added it to the broth to simmer for 10 minutes. I puréed it together. Add pepper & croutons to your serving. Very good.

Made dairy free by subbing olive oil for the butter. I must have used too large a squash, my soup needed thinning with extra chicken broth. Delicious!

Love this soup! Even my bf, who doesn't like squash, said it has a nice flavor. The only thing I added was a pinch of salt and pepper.
