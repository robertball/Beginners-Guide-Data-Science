Yummy, indeed! It's hard to find healthy breakfast recipes that are both good tasting and filling, but this was both. I used regular fat free skim milk in place of the soy milk, but that was my only change. This was very tasty and I will def be making it again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This healthy recipe is very delicious. The banana inside of the bread made this breakfast even more yummy! The one change I made was changing the whole wheat bread to rasin whole wheat bread to get more flavor.
