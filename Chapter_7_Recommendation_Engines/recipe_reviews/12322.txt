Complete success first time with company. One guest ate half the pie himself.  I added 1 more tblespn of flour and used Splenda instead of real sugar.  I used wild fresh picked, that morning berries.  Extremely easy to make with great results.  Thank you.

Wonderfully simple and very tasty recipe. Only change was that I needed to bake it longer than the stated time.

This pie has a great taste - just the right combination of sweet and tart. (I used wild berries.)  The lemon juice adds a zing - but it doesn't taste lemony.  It was pretty runny, though. More like a cobbler.  Maybe my berries were extra juicy.  I'll increase the flour by 1/3 the next time.  Also, the edges burned quickly at 450 degrees.  I may either bake it all at one temp - or at 400 for the first period instead of 450.  But overall...a very nice pie.

I made this pie for my boyfriend for his birthday last year, and it nearly brought him to tears.  

Seriously, it's that good.  And he's a tough critic.

He even thought that the super-cheap Safeway frozen pie crust was of my own creation.  

The only thing I did differently was that I substituted Earth Balance (butter substitute) for the butter.  I really do think that Earth Balance makes everything taste better, so dotting the pie crust AND the fruit with melted EB makes a difference.  

I highly recommend this recipe.  It's so easy too!  Carol, you rule!

Recently picked blackberries for the first time and my family begged for a pie.  One problem...I had never made a pie before.  I checked on this wonderful site and found this very simple and well-rated recipe.  We were not disappointed.  The pie turned out delicious.  I did add an additional tablespoon of flour b/c of others claiming their pie was too runny.  It was perfect!  Thank you for an easy, yet tasty, recipe.

I've made this recipe quite a few times and it always turns out spectacular. The pie never seems to last more than a day..two at the most and it's only me and my husband.  We can't stop eating it.  I usually eyeball the ingredients(adding a little more flour if the berries are fresh and extra juicy) I also use Splenda instead of sugar. I've always used the Pillsbury pie dough (very easy) and the only thing I do differently is to wash the top with a little half and half and sprinkle with brown sugar (a little more that a tsp) over the top crust. I've also used a mixture of frozen berries (sometimes assorted) with fresh if I come up short on the amount needed to fill the pie tin. Always turns out perfect! This is a keeper!

This recipe is incredibly easy.  Mine didn't turn out as tasty as I'd hoped, but I think that was due more to the wild blackberries I used.  If you're mixing the filling and it seems too thin, it probably is (as mine was).  Add more flour.

Very good!  I added more flour, as others had suggested, still a little runny.  I think I'll do cornstarch next time.  Also cut sugar to 3/4 c.  Thanks!

To use an old saying very loosely, this pie was not my "finest hour." Short on flavor and the consistency undesirable.  Also, I used the 450 degree temperature against my better judgment and wished I had just stuck with my usual 375  - it was too hot. The crust set nicely, but browned too quickly, even tho' I had the pie in the lower third of the oven. I think it impacted the filling negatively as well.  Not a fan of this one at all.

I don't know why this pie has had so many rave reviews. I made it exactly as the recipe stated, except I DOUBLED the amount of flour, since all the reviewers said it was too runny. Even with that alteration, this pie dripped a massive amount of juice when it was baking, and ended up way too runny, even with the added thickening from the flour. I pride myself on my home-baked pies, and I will never make this one again! I gave this pie two stars, and even then it was only because it at least had a good flavor.

This pie tasted AMAZING, I've been looking for a good blackberry pie recipe for some time now.  My only change is use cornstarch to thicken, not flour.  And I tacked on another tablespoon, so I used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch.

AMAZING. I brought this to a potluck of 7 people and it was literally gone within 5 minutes. People devoured it. I can't think of how it could be any better--perfect amount of sweetness and a little tartness.  It was the favorite dish at the potluck. I will make this again as many times as I can!

Such an easy and yummy pie! I had barely 4 cups of berries, and the pie was a little wimpy - I think 5 cups would be better. I'd also recommend paying attention to your berries. Mine were a little off-season, so they weren't very juicy and I had no problem with the pie being runny. On the other hand, they were a little tart, so I wish I had used a little more sugar. As far as the baking goes, I was nervous when it started turning golden after the first 15 minutes (at the higher temp), but I kept a close eye on it, and added foil for the last 20 and it made it the whole 35 at the lower temp. Someone told me that when the berry juice/goo starts bubbling up through the slits that it is done. **EDIT: I also made this recipe into mini-pies in my muffin pan, a 3/4 batch made 12 pies, cooked 10 min at 400, then 30 min at 350 - great for a picnic because you don't have to worry about slicing and serving!

This was the first real (not from a box mix) pie that I have ever made.  I got the kids to pick some wild blackberries.  Making the pie was so easy - I did add one extra tablespoon of flour as the blackberries were so juicy.  It came out SO GOOD!  I will make it again, for sure.

This was superb.  I used it as a basis for a cobbler, I had 7-8 cups of blackberries. took it to church for a dinner and all the elderly men said it reminded them of their mama's cobbler. they didn't understand how some one my age could bake like that.  Wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe, I've been looking for an excellent berry recipe.

This is the BEST blackberry pie, and way too easy to pass up. I made it for my brother and my sister in law helped, she couldn't believe how easy.  I bought 6 cartons of blackberrys, and 4 were 4 cups.  I mixed it up and poured into a 10" pie shell and it wasn't enough, so I just put the other 2 containers on top. I probably should have added more flour, because my family couldn't wait for it to cool and it was quite juicy. But we had it with vanilla ice cream and the hot berry juice over the ice cream was amazing! So even if you mess up, it's incredible!  My son in law thought he was waiting for my usual apple pie, and said when he realized it was blackberry he was disappointed before he tasted it, but then just kept raving about it. Finishing it up now 2 days later, the juice did gel and it's still wonderful.  Thanks for this recipe!!!

A good basic recipe for blackberry pie.  Try substituing tapioca as a thickening agent rather than flour.  The back of the tapioca box will advise you how much to use.

I used this recipe for my first pie and it turned out PERFECT. (I've now made it three more times). I latticed the top to make it look more professional, but it didn't matter, because it was gone in minutes! Also, careful using frozen fruits, as sometimes they can make the filling too runny if they're icy.

this is a great recipe, but i agree that it is too runny.  I took out a little of the flour and put in about a half cup of instant tapioca.  this helped the liquid at the bottom, as long as the pie is given at least a half hour to 45 minutes to cool.  the flavor is still great!

I made this pie and took it too a party...it was a HUGE hit! they said I should enter it in the county fair! I used fresh home grown blackberries, but I used a store bought crust. for the flour, I put in 1/3 cup instead of 3 tablespoons. this got it to be a bit less runny. I tried it again but made my own crust and it was also very good. TIP: let the pie sit in your fridge overnight to thicken up before eating. it is a lot less runny that way. otherwise, VERY nice pie!

So easy, and tasty! When I took it out of the over I brushed the top with butter and sprinkled sugar on it. The pie was so pretty and the people I made it for raved about how good it was.

I highly reccommend!  I made this using fresh blackberries. I did cut back a bit on the sugar and the pie still had a wonderful flavor. I also used just a bit more flour to help with the thickness.

I made the 4 Tbsp flour change, as suggested.  I also added a dash more lemon juice and some cinnamon.  The pie came out beautifully, and firmed up nicely by the next day.

This is the first time I've made a blackberry pie.  The only thing I did differently (after reading the reviews) was add 1 Tbsp. of cornstarch and l/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the berries.  It turned out beautifully and my husband raved about it.  This recipe is a keeper!

I've taken this to two picnics and my only disappointment has been that there was never any left to take home! It's so good, and so simple! I admit, I used frozen blackberries, and if it was good with frozen blackberries I can just imagine how good it would be with fresh!

The flavor is magnificant but I poured nearly two cups of waterlike juice out of the pie even after it had cooled for hours.  It was definitely more like a cobbler.

My family wanted a quick New Year's Eve pie to ring in 2008, and this one exceeded our expectations. I modified the following: I split the berry quantity to include blackberries and raspberries, added 1 tablespoon corn starch, and omitted the butter. Yummy!

Delicious. I made with fresh-picked wild blackberries. We were low on sugar, so I used half the recipe amount... so the pie tasted almost like pure berries. Yum. The sweetness is subtle enough even for breakfast. Total hit in my house.

My husband mentioned that he wanted a blackberry pie, so I surprised him with this tonight. He followed his nose into the kitchen, lured by the yummy smells coming from the oven and he enjoyed a hearty slice with some vanilla bean ice cream. Happy man - my work here is done.

Very good pie!  I added a couple extra tablespoons of flour.  I think I should have added some extra sugar, as the pie wasn't as sweet as some would have liked.

I've made this several times usually annually for my husband's birthday since BlackBerry pie is his fave. I never remember my critique of the outcome,  so this time I thought I would post. I'm  guessing I love it since I use the same recipe, lol. I did change things since I do recall it being super juicy and runny.  I decided to add tapioca and cook longer this time 35 minutes more to be exact with 1/4 cup tapioca ( include flour or cornstarch also)
Best by far!!!

The combination of this recipe and the "No Fail Pie Crust III" recipe goes perfect together! Sweet blackberries with a flakey crust is just perfect!

HOWEVER, this recipe is somewhat runny! I'm going to add more flour next time to prevent this. Other than that, zero complaints!

I made the pie exactly as recipe was written.  It came out perfectly and was delicious.  I will admit that the juicy berries cooked over a little and ended up on the bottom of the oven but not the fault of the recipe.

Meh- didn't like as is. Not enough flour- very soupy. I use 3.5 T and very runny. Also you need more blackberries - say 5 cups. Sugar amount remains the same and temp time is right on.

My husband asked for BlackBerry pie and I used this recipe. The only thing that I did differently was to cook the berries, sugar and ingredients on the stove  before  putting it in my pie crust.  I then cooked it at 350 for 40 minutes. It turned out great! I will use this recipe again!!

I have two in the oven as I type this. Sixth one in three weeks! It was hard to scavenge the berries today as they are closing out, but loved this recipe so much I endured the suffering in 100 degree heat. Can't wait to dive into one of them. And no, I'm under 180 lb male. This recipe may ruin that:)

I have made this twice in the last week with our freshly picked blackberries. My husband says it is his new favorite!  I followed the recipe except for adding more berries (about 1 to 1 1/2 cups) and increasing the flour as other reviewers have suggested. The best part is it is SO EASY!

Wow- this is a good pie.  Very simple.  Baking time was right on for me, but I did add a little bit more flour, on the suggestion of other reviewers.  It's not the sweetest pie ever but I love that.  You could always sweeten it up with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.  Great recipe I'll make again.  Thanks!

This pie tasted great, but it was really runny despite adding 2 extra tablespoons of flour. As a regular pie-baker, I was disappointed, but I will try the recipe again with either more flour or cornstarch.

This is an amazing pie! I used it with the "Best Ever Pie Crust" recipe. I put in half the amount of sugar (I don't like really sweet pie), extra blackberries and it came out perfect. I'll make this one again. Thanks Carol!

This was a very tasty pie . . . but then what blackberry pie isn't tasty? Unfortunately, my pie didn't set up very well and was quite runny (a problem I've never had with other blackberry pie recipes). I'm probably to blame, as I was very generous in my measuring of the blackberries and should have probably thrown in an extra tablespoon of flour to compensate.

First blackberry pie I ever made, and I loved it!  Excellent recipe!  I added milk and sugar to the top crust, and it turned out perfect!

I also use Earth Balance non-dairy spread;
replacing white sugar with organic sugar.
Love Berry Pies!
