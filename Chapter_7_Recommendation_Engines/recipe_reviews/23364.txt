Everyone at the table wanted this recipe.  I've never seen anything like it.  The onions take on the sweetness of the yams and have an almost carmelized taste - yum!  I would suggest cooking it uncovered for an additional 15 min. to really cook it all the way through and melt/brown the top crust.  Also, try to cut the potatos super thin while the yams are sliced thicker because the yams tend to cook to quickly while the potatos take longer to cook.

This recipe was great - it's first savory sweet potato dish I've had, and I definitely like more than the candied sweet potatoes. I would recommend a few alterations though - Omit the breadcrumbs, they're not necessary. Bake for 30 min without the cheese, then add cheese, and bake for 30 min more so cheese doesnt buurn. Next time I might add some cheese between the layers of potatoes. I definitely will want to make this again with the alterations I mentioned.

I used Monterey Jack Cheese and chicken boullion instead of Mozzerella cheese and veg boullion. -only because it was in my fridge.  Excellent side dish with Turkey!

This was an excellent flavor combination.  I made a few adjustments though.  I used a deeper dish and did several layerings.  I also used beef broth instead of vegetable and eliminated the bread crumbs and flour.  I peeled the potatoes as well and added cheese in with every layer, as well as a lot of butter.  My husband loved it so much that he ate three helpings and took the rest to work the following day, he even asked me to make it again often.

I thought this was wonderful!!!  I followed the
recipe for the most part, but made one addition.
I mixed in some heavy whipping cream with the vegetable broth and flour.  I got rave reviews on this dish!!!

What a great change from the usual sweet potato casserole. I used more sweet potatoes than white and also mixed chicken broth and half and half and it turned out delicious.

This was good but I felt it needed something more.  I am going to change the butter/chicken stock ratio next time to make it richer.

I used only sweet potatoes and omitted the bread crumbs. Cooking time was more like 45 minutes. This was an excellent dish. So much more satisfying than the sugary sweet potato recipes I am used to! Will make this a holiday staple!

Super yummy! I reduced the amount of butter and cheese, and it was still good. Next time, I'm going to switch the potato layers (starting with the white & ending with the sweet) because the top layer of white potato wasn't cooked as well as the other layers and the sweet potato cooked much faster even when sliced thicker. Thanks for this "keeper"!

It turned out great!  Best advice I used:  
Peel sweet potatoes and cut thicker than white.  
Sprinkle each row with a little cheese.  (Top sweet potatoes with mozzerella and white with pepper jack.)  
Chopped onions, but I think thin slices would be good too.
Add top layer of cheese at the end of bake time.  
Omit broth and just added a little more butter.
Subbed chopped cooked bacon and onions for bread crumb topping.    
I made this in a 9x13 pan so it took a lot of potatoes and probably 1 1/2 hours to cook. I also cranked up the heat to 400 for last 1/2 hour.  Just cook until it is tender with a fork.

Made this to go with a filet roast for Christmas Eve dinner.  Was delicious.  I used cheddar because I didn't have mozzarella.  I also made a 2nd pan and omitted the cheese, broth and breadcrumbs for a healthier, lower sodium version for my husband and he thought it was great.

Came out perfect.  I used shallots instead of onion and it was very tasty.  Turned out to be a nice dish to serve with salmon.

Really loved this recipe. I went to my friend's house for dinner and they found out I was vegetarian so they whipped up a special meal for me including a sweet potato dish with plain potato, spinach and cheese. It was yum, so ever since I've been trying to find a similar dish to make myself. This one was great, I made a few adjustments, omitting the bread crumbs and so...also I didn't cook it in the oven so it was slow cooked in a Bessemer dish (YUM!)-the vego stock and flour didn't work out great for me so I omitted it the second time, anyway despite all the small changes, there was not once this recipe was not wholly devoured by me!

Lacks a lot of flavor, definitely needs more salt and herbs. I added sage. It was also much too wet. I had to drain the extra liquid out.

I am giving this 5 stars, because my husband loved it and it is difficult to get that reaction from him.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, but doubled it and it turned out great.  I agree that the yams cook quicker so its best to cut them in thicker slices than the white potatoes.  And I will add cheese to the middle of the casserole next time.  Very yummy.

This was excellent at Christmas dinner with ham. I didn't change a thing and there was not a morsel left. Would make this again for any occasion.
I made this again but added a ham steak with cloves between the potato layers. I put crushed pineapple on top and baked as usual. It was great with the added ham.

Wow, I was impressed by this recipe.  The lack of spices made me think it was going to be bland and tasteless.  On the contrary my friends, this turned out to be very delicious, and I didn't change a thing

Really yummy.  I used the tips from the other reviewers (substitued cream for half of the chicken broth), used only yams, as we had a mashed potato dish, and made it even better - I carmelized the onions first till they were golden brown and a little blackened.  The flavor of the carmelized onions made it extra tasty with the baked yams.  My family said we could have skipped the chees (I used mozarella), but I bet it would be even better with gruyere or similar rich cheese.

I decided to take a chance and make this for Thanksgiving dinner... It is a keeper for certain! This is something to put on the dinner table year round! I gave this a four star because I feel that it could use a bit more cheese, possibly some cheddar~

I made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it (especially me!). The only thing I did differently was substituted chicken broth for veggie broth, and I left the bread crumbs off. The white potatoes didn't cook fully in 1 hour, so I had to cook for approx. 1-20 minutes. Great recipe! P.S. I doubled recipe.

I tested this recipe last night in anticipation of using it for Thanksgiving.  It is suberb!!!  You really get the taste of the potatoes as they were meant to taste and not sticky sweet!!!!  I highly recommend it.

I made stock from our Thanksgiving turkey, and used it in this recipe - which is now my favourite way to eat sweet potato. I used grated emmenthal on top instead of mozzarella. Thanks!

Our family loved this receipe.  However I dont feel it needs as much butter.  The sweet potatoes make it sweet enough and you can save on calories. I also used chicken broth and it gave it a nice flavor.

This was absolutely delicious! I veganized it with Daiya cheez and it came out great. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe. I'll be making this again for Thanksgiving.

I think maybe I am just used to having my sweet potatoes being very sweet and dessert-like. I wasn't too fond of this recipe. It was okay but I think I am going to stick to the SWEET sweet potatoes.

I've been looking for a pure yam or Sweet-potato recipe for years of Thanksgiving dinners. Hooray for Holly! Her comments were identical to my thoughts and I'm glad she submitted a yam recipe that make them taste exactly like they are supposed to be cooked and how they taste. Where did all that added sugar in everyone's recipe come from? I've hated marshmallows all my life. None of my young friends liked them either.

Pretty good dish, none of us were crazy about it - it seemed to lack something.  Would be good with bacon pieces, will try that if I make again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was good, I served it with maple syrup beans.  The sweetness of the onions went well with the yams.  It was flavourful. I might make this again, on thanksgiving in place of just yams, which tend to be too sweet.

This was excellent... even my husband loved it and he's not crazy about yams! Great way to fit more of this highly nutritious vegetable into our weekly rotation. I made just enough for the two of us in a tiny little casserole and put just a bit of grated cheddar between the layers. Will definitely make regularly from now on... thanks!!

I substituted cream for half the broth, and added one teaspoon of dried thyme leaves and 1/2 teaspoon of finely ground black pepper. I had Swiss cheese in my refrigerator so that is what I used, and sprinkled a little in amongst the potato layers.  It had a nice flavor, not bland, and wasn't soupy or dilute.  With the cheese added, a small portion of leftovers served as lunch the next day. The sweet potatoes also give a tang to the taste so that it is not just all starch-flavored.  I liked this variation, not sticky or candy-sweet.

not sure what I did wrong but this wasn't very good at all. I followed the recipe exactly, which I have to admit is unusual for me, but it was so soupy we had to strain out the potatoes and the flavor was washed out. Hubby said he'd eat it "once a year---maybe".

I made this for Christmas dinner and increased the serving size to 12. It worked out well and was a pretty easy dish to make for a large number. I divided it into serving dishes prior to cooking and the only drawback was that total cooking time was a little over 1 1/2 hours (not the 1 hr given in the original)

I liked this, my husband thought it was just "ok". I probably won't make it again due to his reaction. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and I think swiss would have been better than mozzarella.

I made this for a vegan casserole party last night. Subbing veg broth and non dairy cheese and butter. Brought home an empty pan. Everyone loved and raved over it. Very popular hit and would make again using real cheese for my family. Thank you for sharing!

I’ve made this several times, a great alternative to cream scallop potatoes (which we also loved). Those visiting for dinner took home the recipe.  I’ve used both chicken broth and vegetable broth.  Too, I found that text mex (Spicy) shredded cheese add a little more flavour.

Followed the recipe and it was pretty boring - not horrible, you can’t go too wrong w potatoes, onions and cheese. The breadcrumbs on top were wonderful, gave it a nice crispy topping w the cheese and butter. Had to cook for almost 30 mins longer than called for.  next time I’ll try using only sweet potato’s, more onion and maybe a bit of cayenne.  I was looking for an alternative to the sweet marshmallow dishes but this recipe definitely needs work

This is a hit.  I only had sweet potatoes and no onions, however I used dried onion and used extra cheese marble on top.  Would also be good with a random layer of cheese in the middle.

I changed the recipe a little. I only used 1/2 cup of chicken broth because I didn't have vegetable, I used less cheese and no butter. Next time I would probably use more potatoes because I only got 4 layers of potatoes which made it very thin. Furthermore, This recipe is amazing and I will definitely be making it again.

awesome recipe ....... I just had to use more sweet potato than regular potato. It has more sweet potato flavor, which I liked. I will make this a lot ! although, I will cut the butter back next time. a bit too greasy, had to drain a lot off. otherwise, great change !

I thought this was a most delightful change from the usual.  I made it as a side with a grilled rib eye, but this flavor and light texture in a potato would pair well with most dishes.  Made the recipe as stated, but in a deep casserole.  Definitely take the time to cook it longer than suggested, but cutting the potatoes thinner than the yams will benefit the outcome.

My family loved this recipe.  I grew up with brown sugar and marshmallow food that my relatives made but I am happier with the savory take on this one.  I would change a thing about it.  The potatoes were moist and delicious with the onion, cheese and bread crumbs.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

Good as reviewed. Did take other reviews to add garlic, hot sauce, cheese in each layer vs 2 c on top about the same amount overall. Also used Monterey cheese. Now our favorite very tasty.

I used 4 white and 4 sweet potatoes, doubled the liquid, flour and bread crumbs, used colby jack cheese instead but left everything else the same. It did take 1 1/2 hours to bake and tasted great but was very watery.

We tried this recipe for a dinner party and it was a hit. Everyone asked for the recipe.  We were generous with onion and used a mix of shredded cheeses - provolone, mozzarella, and parmesan.  We cooked it longer than stated in the recipe, about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Will use this recipe again soon!

This was fantastic!!!!  I heeded the advice of others and decided to use both cheeses on each layer with mozzarella on the yams and pepper jack on the white potatoes. I also sliced the white potatoes thinner than the yams.  The flavor was absolutely wonderful and actually reminded me of scalloped potatoes. Will definitely make this again.

This was a delicious way to use sweet potatoes! I am not a big fan of the brown sugar and marshmallow recipes you typical use sweet potatoes for. I followed the recipe exactly and got fantastic results. So delicious!

This was delicous! I would put the cheese on 15min before it is done baking. I sprinkled parsley and thyme btwn the layers and it turned out really good.

This was okay. My family really likes Yams; but still met with so so results. I put in a smaller container and messed up my layers of Yam to potato - which may be the reason for the so so results. Next time will try to make sure the potato (white) has the cheese and may be better. This would be a good recipe for those who don't really like the flavor of Yams, but want the additional nutrition in a potato dish.

This dish was great! I cannot cook, lol, i burn water. However I easily made this dish and my family was not very willing to try it since I made it but once I convinced them to they loved it even though normally they hate sweet potatoes. It will now be a tradition for me to make this every thanksgiving and christmas.

I am giving this 5 stars even though it was not a big hit at my Thanksgiving table.  I really liked the texture and the fact that it was an alternative to the sweet yam casserole that is a tradition to serve.  I think it tasted great, even heated up the next day.

Made this with my roast beef dinner for New Years with friends, as I had some vegetarian guests. Turned out really good.  I used chicken flavoured oxo (no worries, made sure it was vegetarian-friendly and no actual meat used)in with the water/flour mix, and  the guys raved about it. A definite keeper for when I need a good, easy vegetarian dish!

made as directed, i think the taste of this dish is a solid 4 stars but the creative use of yams & idahos definately takes it to 5 stars! many thanks for a healthful alternative to those sweet casseroles, holly!

I thought this was very good - and simple.  I had to bake it about an hour and 15 minutes.  I did use chicken broth which added a little more flavor I think as well as a mix of provolone and mozzarrella - my guests really liked it.  To cut down on fat I used a light butter substitute and not quite as much as what was called for.   The onions flavored it perfectly!

I was disappointed by the rather bland taste of this recipe.  I think chedder cheese would have been better.  I agree with the other reviewers that less better and breadcrumbs would be better.  Maybe chicken stock instead of vegatable?  More seasoning?  I'm not sure, but mine was pretty boring.

I was really excited when I found this recipe, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  The flavors didn't do it for my family.  We ended up tossing the leftovers which were plentiful.

This recipe is excellent...everyone we have served it to just fell in love with it. It's a good way to serve sweet potatoes to people who don't like a strong sweet potato flavor. The only changes I made were changing the broth to chicken and using Monterey Jack cheese instead of Mozzarella.
