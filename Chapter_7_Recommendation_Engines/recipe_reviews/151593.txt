Why, oh why do people skimp on the crumb topping and spices? Make it better with this: 1/2 c crackers, 1/4 wedge of parmesean cheese, and 2 tbls cold butter. Puree it all in a food processor and add it at the beginning of the cooking time - then it's crispy and great, and also keeps those top noodles from getting icky and crunchy if they stick out the top of the casserole. A little garlic powder, thyme, and shallots can't hurt this recipe, either!

Just like I remember from a kid.....substituting shredded cheese and crushed potato chips for the butter and bread crumb ingredients.  Sprinkle a little fresh parmesan on the individual servings....delicious

i love this meal.   But I did make changes.  I used french fried onion rings broken up into small pieces.  I mixed this with the noodles, milk. Peas and tuna.  At the end  I added cheese and more french fried onion rings.   Quick and easy for a comfort meal on a cold day in Ohio.

I totally love this recipe, but I also recommend doubling the breadcrumb ingredients.  And I made it with 1 can of cream of celery and one can of cream of mushrooms, since I'm not crazy about mushrooms.

Pretty bland so you have to add some seasonings.  NOT potato chips, bacon, sausage and all the other garbage people are adding to make it a Fat Tuesday meal.  Jeeeeez.

We really liked this recipe. I added frozen zucchini and spinach to give some extra nutrition. The spinach didn't affect the flavor too much, might be a good way to trick kids into eating more veggies. 

Just the thing for a winter's night after work when you're too tired to stand in front of the stove. Just throw the ingredients in there, stir it and pop it in the oven.

This recipe is good but with a few extras its amazing!!! I followed the directions but I used one can tuna one can chicken then I read some reviews and added some seasonings: garlic powder, Italian seasoning and some pepper (an even layer of each over the casserole) and I added 1 finely chopped shallot (from another review) and french's fried onion, I mixed them inside and I put the rest on top. I used canned carrots, peas, and frozen corn (because that's what I had in the cabinet). I used shelled pasta instead of egg noodle as well. And I topped it with Cheddar and parmesan the last five min. IT WAS AMAZING!!! AND MY PICKY 4 YR. OLD LOVED IT! thank you for the reviews everyone they helped alot! This recipe is a keeper!!!

Childhood favorite but adding crushed potato chips makes it true to childhood and adds salty crispness!  Also using low fat evaporated milk instead of regular or skim adds to the richness of the flavor.

This is a great base recipe.  I'm not a fan of peas, so I exchanged for corn.  I added another can of tuna, can of mushrooms, thyme, dill weed, lemon pepper, garlic pepper, chopped onions, cubed Velveeta, parmasan and garlic salt.  The topping I used Italian bread crumbs, buttery crackers, French fried onions, parmasan and butter.  I baked it for 20-25 minutes rather than the 30 due to the butter burning the topping. 

That's the best thing about this recipe, it gives you a base, then you start smelling your spices and thinking "mmm yes, that would taste good too".

The flavor was very good.  I think this is  a great basic recipe.  However, it was slightly dry, in part due to the high cooking temp.  Next time, I will reduce the cooking temp to 350 and add a bit more milk. I did add some sauteed celery & onion.

Why do people give low ratings for blandness? It's up the the individual to jazz it up a little, if needed. I used lowfat evaporated milk, Healthy Choice crm. of mushroom soup, wholegrain pasta bow ties insted of egg noodles, half the peas. I added a chopped shallot and celery stalk, several chopped mushrooms, all sauteed first. I also tossed in some thyme and cracked pepper, and lastly tripled the crumbs and added grated romano. It was terrific!!

Excellent basic recipe that I have been using for years.  Everyone has their own taste for spicing dishes up, so I do add garlic powder, chopped onion, and black pepper.  I have always topped this casserole dish with crushed potato chips.

A tad on the bland side, but nonetheless still a great basic recipe.  Next time I might add different veggies (mushrooms, celery) or cheese, or decrease the peas.

I've noticed a lot of cooks were saying the casserole came out dry.
The recipe dose not say whether to cover with a lid or foil.
Cover the casserole and remove when adding the crumbs.
Go Cooks !!!!!

I gave this recipe 5 stars with the modifications.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken, I also fried up some chopped celery and onion and added that to the recipe.  Also, used whole wheat fuslli pasta instead of egg noodles as I didn't have any. Very good the whole family enjoyed it including my 18 month old :)

We use cut up chicken instead of tuna and whatever cream soups we have on hand.  But we really like this in our house.  My kids gobble it up.  I add 2T of Parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs and it adds some nice flavor.

I cooked 1/2 onion and 3 cloves of garlic in butter, once they browned I added fresh mushrooms and sauteed. I added 2 cups of milk and mushroom soup in the pan, then added peas and corn and brought to a boil. Poured this over the noodles and tuna and mixed it all up and sprinkled some cheese and put it in the oven. It was fantastic!! Everyone loved it.

This is one of the first meals I ever made when I first started cooking! I usually add a cup of shredded cheddar to make it cheesy. I don't like peas, so I just omit them and add a drained can of corn. Really simple and super filling.

I was out of noodles so I used macaroni instead. I am allergic to seafood so I used 80% lean hamburg and I never have cream of mushroom so I substituted tomato paste. It tasted a bit bland when I put it in the casserole dish so I added some garlic, catsup, salt, peanuts and alfalfa. What a disappointment!! =

While I love this, I cannot have mushrooms of any type. I use cream of celery, as my family likes celery in this dish. I wish more companies could give alternatives for those of us with food allergies, sometimes, I have to guess what would work in a dish if it has an ingredient such as the mushroom soup.

This was good, for your basic, bare-bones tuna noodle casserole. Kind of bland. But I prefer my bf's version: elbow noodles, mayonaise, cream of mushroom, peas, tuna, crushed ripple chips and topped with cheddar cheese..yummy!

I made this tonight for dinner.  I used crushed Ritz crackers mixed with butter for the topping.  I made a couple of modifications.  I added some sour cream and green onion.  My grandmother added these to hers and I loved her Tuna Noodle Casserole.  A great comfort food!

Meh. I make it for my husband. Seems bland. Will triple the crispy topping next time. Needs spices and flavoring. I halve it as it is made for just one person.

This was really good.  I did make some changes though.  I added about 1 cup sour cream, and a 1/2 cup parmasean cheese.  I also added about 1 tsp of garlic powder and a pinch of oregeno.  mmm mmm good.

This is the best comfort food.  I added shredded cheddar to the mix, then topped it with more cheddar and panko bread crumbs.  I added salt and pepper to taste and I think it would be pretty bland otherwise, especially if you aren't adding cheese.

I changed a couple things but I found this recipe to be a great starting point. I added a pinch of garlic powder, italian seasoning, a tiny bit of onion flakes, and some cheese. I used whole wheat noodles instead of egg noodles and frozen peas and carrots instead of just peas because that's what I had on hand. I think this recipe has a ton of possibility and customization power. Everyone loved the end result, and demanded more!

I screwed up this recipe royally.  I bought 1 can regular cream of mushroom and 1 can low sodium, plus i used whole milk.  It came out quite gray looking with a flat taste.  It was not like my mother used to make.  I suggest using tuna with a chunkier consistency (like albacore) plus I would bake it in a shallower casserole to have more breadcrumb topping.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  It turned out great, but it was a little bland.  Next time I will add more seasoning--maybe salt, garlic salt, or something like that.  Overall, it's a good, easy recipe to make.  And we had enough for left-overs.

My boyfriend absolutely adores this recipe. I can't seem to make it fast enough! We usually add more peas and add celery (or broccoli!) for a little more crunch and a little less heavy/creamy.

I grew up with this recipe and it's still one of my fav's.  We don't put the milk in and use corn instead of peas.  My mom used to crunch up potato chips or fritos for the topping.  Yummers!  You can also top with french fried onion rings from the can.

This was a good basic recipe for tuna casserole.  I used crumbled ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs, and added cheddar cheese.  My family really liked the cheddar cheese on it.

Came out perfect, such a quick easy meal! I did add one more can of tuna (3total) and I used a can of mixed veggies instead of froZen peas..  I like a lot of veggies so next time I will use two cans(drained) ...if u like a crunchy top you might want triple the butter and bread crumbs. But the creaminess of this recipe was perfect, super yummy!

Great base casserole.  Definitely needs seasoning - pepper, maybe some Dijon mustard.  Hearty, and flavours blend well together.  And it was liked by hubby and 2 yr old.  Must have the bread crumb topping - it's what makes a good tuna noodle casserole!!

just made it, but since I have no peas and carrots on hand, I added 2 cups frozen corn and 2 cans of sliced mushrooms. I also only had 1 can of cream of mushroom, so I added a can cream of mushroom with roasted garlic. topped with a light sprinkling of Mexican cheese blend before placing in oven. followed suggestion of using 3 tbsp. Italian bread crumbs wit 2 tbsp. margarine.

I just tried this recipe and loved it! Next time I will add another can of tuna and half the peas the recipe called for. I added a potato chip topping instead of the bread crumbs and then topped it with shredded colby-jack cheese after it came out of the oven. Excellent!

This was very bland and a little fishy for us.  We both like albacore tuna and that's what I used but it just wasn't tasty.  Maybe we are just not tuna casserole people - I won't be making this again.

I've never made a tuna casserole, but my husband likes it so I decided to try this recipe with a couple of changes.  Instead of egg noodles, I used elbow macaroni and used french fried onions.  It was delicious!  Next time, the only thing I would change is to half the recipe since it is only the two of us.

I halved the recipe for my family of 4.  It brought back sweet memories of mom's homecooking.  Life just doesn't get much better than that...

This recipe was okay but for me, it definitely lacked in flavor and had too much of a tuna taste so I altered it. I didn't change any of the original recipe measuring or ingredients, I just added to it. I added fresh baby spinach, artichoke hearts (sliced or diced), carrots (diced), garlic (diced), shallots (diced), celery (diced), fresh portabello mushrooms (sliced or diced, mine was sliced because my family likes chunks.), and red bell pepper (for added color and diced). I sauted the veggies to my liking first, then I added them to the mixture of milk, soup, peas. I definitely added salt, pepper and other seasonings and i also added 1 egg, muenster cheese and cream cheese to add to the creaminess and a little dry powder ranch dressing. It came out fabulous and my family killed just about half the pan !! Fyi: For the topping , you are definitely going to need to add more crumbs than what the recipe suggest. I added hemp seeds and Parmesan cheese  and then I topped that with fresh parsley.

I doubled it and had a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of celery in pantry.  Loved it with some cream of celery.  I added about a tsp of garlic powder and doubled the topping per our preferences.   I'm sure this recipe is great as written as well.  Hubs dug in and went back for seconds and took some to work for lunch the next day.  I'd say this one is a keeper for us, lol.

I make it often for our family. Nobody is interested in it till it gets to the table then it goes fast. I serve the peas on the side and they can be mixed in as they are wanted. Also if it's too bland for your taste, Sriracha gives it a nice kick.

You can use any kinds of noodles and it will work well. 
One thing I changed was to use actual bread to cut in cubes and mixed with butter. Chunky bread cubes looked much nicer! Yay!

Just like my mom use to make. I think I will change the topping next time though. The topping was not enough and I think a good topping would add flavor.

I use to eat this at my mom's house, so I decided to make this for my husband and I. In stead of 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, I added 1 can of cream of chicken to the recipe. I also omitted the peas, since we don't have any, and added some 2 tbsp of lemon juice to the recipe. It's truly a good comfort food on a slightly chilly day.

Use 2 cups of milk or it comes out too dry. Unless you're a big fan of peas, cut back on the 2 cups recommended.

Just made this tonight and it was very good, with a few additions.  I added a small onion (finely chopped), salt / pepper, some minced garlic, and some shredded cheddar.  Topped it with breadcrumbs, melted butter, and a little more shredded cheese and it was terrific!

I have always loved this recipe for a basic, classic tuna casserole. Such a filling and comforting dish! I do add some salt and black pepper, and sometimes add a cup of grated cheddar cheese.  I like to saute some diced onion and celery in a bit of butter until tender and mix in this also. You easily could add ingredients you prefer, but with the few additions I make this is delicious. French fried onions on top of this is great also, if you don't want the breadcrumb topping. This will always be a favorite in my house :)

I'm not a suuuper big fan of tuna but this recipe was awesome. I think there could have been a little less peas (and I love peas). Not even halfed but just a few off the top. Great dish though.

My husband does not like my cooking. I don't much either, but he's been sick so we have to make do with what I can come up with. I made this with what I had on hand and hoped for the best. I used frozen asparagus since I didn't have peas, bow tie pasta since I didn't have egg noodles, and town house crackers since I had no bread crumbs. While the pasta cooked, I loaded the other ingredients in the casserole dish, sprinkled with garlic salt and pepper, stirred well. Added the bread crumb mixture and a healthy dose of shredded colby jack cheese for the last five minutes of baking. It was delicious. He had seconds, and since getting him to eat is hard enough, I was thrilled. We agreed next time to try the potato chips, but we will stick with the asparagus.

Fixed this as per the recipe, but like other readers have commented, it was a bit bland.  Might have to try using a can of cream of celery soup for one of the cans of cream of mushroom, and maybe some pepper to this recipe if I use it again.  The sour cream suggestion sounded good, too.  Also will cut back a bit on the peas...two cups was too much.

A little bland, but still yummy!  Used Ritz crackers for the topping.  Will probably sneak some extra veggies in next time and some more seasonings.

maybe it's becouse I only used a 2 quart casserole dish but it seems like that was just way too much tuna.  Did I read the recipe right?  I used 20 oz of tuna...

It's not bad, just lots and lots of tuna..

Not a fan of peas so I substituted carrot chunks, celery, onion & mushrooms. That jazzed it up a bit.  My family loved it!

I mixed in some garlic powder, parsley, and parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs.  I did make extra for the top of the casserole.

I highly suggest swapping the frozen peas for frozen mixed vegetables. I’ve made this recipe a gazillion times but with mixed veggies. Tonight I tried it with peas and will never use peas again! Mixed veggies add more flavor and color.

I made this without the peas, used a little onion for flavor and seasoned it before cooking with Garlic Ranch powder. At the end I put cheese on top!

I use a mixture of panko and parm on top.  Cover it with tin foli to begin with , like a lasagna, to keep it moist.  Then uncover.  Never added milk and butter before - but have added extra tuna, cream of mushroom soup, and/or cheese (I always put in cheese, and you can never have too much cheese!) but trying the milk tonight - just a splash - and pats of butter on top, rather than mixing them in with the other crusty stuff.  Also a great camping dish - just mix it all up in a pot and don't worry about the baking.  Canned peas and hand-cut chunks of cheese.

I like to broil it at the end for just a few minutes, instead of just removing the foil, but I always forget about it and burn it!

Great and easy recipe!  I made it with chicken since I am not a big tuna fan.  I also cut the recipe in half for me and my husband.  It was so good and just the right amount for both of us to have 2nd helpings!  Definitely a keeper!

Well the only difference is I only had 1 can creamy chicken soup so went one of a substitute recipe.
Put cheese on top instead of bread crumbs.

Easy, quick and tasty.  I used grated cheese on top instead of bread crumbs.  I think I’ll try a bit of grated onion & sliced mushrooms next time.

I just made this tonight and it was delicious.  I took the advice from other reviews and added a can of Cream of Celery Soup along with the 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom Soup.  I threw in extra milk to make sure it was creamy.   I topped with buttered French's crispy onions and parmesan cheese and put the dish back in the oven for 5 additional minutes.  You will want to season as it is somewhat bland without it.  I will make this again.

I substituted a can of cheddar soup and a can of cream of celery since my kids don't like mushrooms. I never buy 10 oz cans of tuna so almost only used a total of 10 oz then realized I misunderstood so added another 10 oz. It's pretty plain but good for feeding a group of teen boys who can add desired seasonings.

I made this exactly as written, using the cheddar cheese tip at the bottom of the recipe. This is so easy to make & came out so delicious, I had the time to enjoy eating it with my husband who kept going back for more. We LOVED it, will definitely make it again & again!!!

I used 2 cans cream of chicken instead of mushroom as my kids aren't big on mushrooms and did croutons instead of bread crumbs

Our family really enjoyed this. I subbed cream of celery for one of the cream of mushroom cans, because I’m not overly fond of mushrooms. Per other reviewers’ suggestions I sprinkled garlic powered & Italian seasoning on top & tossed in a few crushed Ritz crackers with the breadcrumbs. Bow tie pasta bc my son can’t have egg noodles. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe and it was great!

Super simple recipe!  Great for a crazy week night. I added onion powder and garlic powder. If i had time i would have liked to have cooked some fresh onion to go in there. Instead of bread crumbs or cheese, we used crushed chips at the end of the bag. This will get made again!

I put cheese on top because gluten free bread crumbs aren't the same. Since I haven't found gluten free egg noodles, we use gluten free rottini.

An excellent base.  We decided to make this on the stovetop.  I cooked an onion chopped to softness, added garlic and cooked to fragrant, added the milk, cream of mushroom soup, tuna, and peas. Then let that heat up, then added the noodles and combined.  We then added pepper, cayenne, salt, and garlic powder.  Topping was chow mein noodles, which made this meal awesome.

This recipe is definitely a crowd pleaser.. I have made it several times with a few some additions.. I add sliced mushrooms and finely diced yellow onion and low sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of regular.. for the breadcrumbs I do seasoned panko and instead of adding butter I just spray with a coconut oil nonstick spray to make it golden brown on top.

My version:

I read the original version is bland so here’s how I tweaked it:

I used 1.5 c of half n half and 1/2 cup of chicken stock for flavor. Then added 1 TBSP garlic powder, 1/2 TBSP onion powder, 2 tsp salt, 1.5 tsp fresh cracked pepper. Then for more flavor I used hickory smoked tuna & 1tsp smoked liquid hickory smoke, 1TBSP Crushed Red Pepper for heat. Then for the topping I used  crushed French’s French Fried Onions mixed with shredded Parmesan...

It was just shy of D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S.

Its very easy to make and is delicious! I always put three slices of white American cheese on the top and spread the bread crumbs over the top of that as well and just let it bake! Super good.

I added 3 slices of real American cheese in the actual casserole and mixed fresh grated Parmesan cheese in to my homeade bread crumbs. I omitted the butter but added a little salt and pepper to taste. Family loved it. I say it's a hit. Would make again!

I was watching Mike & Molly TV show and Mike’s Mom was making Tuna Noodle Casserole. I haven’t made it in years, so I looked up the recipe here. I didn’t have any peas so that is only difference in the recipe. Thanks for bringing back old memories. This is a great way to stretch a dollar too.

Followed the recipe exactly, and it was a little bland. In the future I will try changing the way I made it!

I just made it and it’s delicious! I have noticed that it tastes even better reheated as left overs. I made it gluten free for my mom and it turned out great. I substituted Tinkyáda brow rice pasta spirals for the egg noodles and Great Value gluten free cream of mushroom instead of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom. Instead of bread crumbs I put Kraft's Grated parmesan cheese on top. I LOVE this recipe!

It was ok but I didn't make it as written!  I used another's advice to season it.  First I cut the recipe in half, except for the tuna, I used two cans. I added 2 tsp of a steak seasoning, it was good but a little too much flavor. Next time I would try 1tsp. I also used crushed sour cream and onion chips on top. My 9 month old enjoyed it a little more than I did!

I used canned peas, not frozen. Replaced the bread crumbs with the crushed saltine crackers. I spread the crackers over the tuna mixture and then added the melted butter. I forgot to take a photo but I will next time.

I am at the (bitter)?end of my pay-day month, lol, but I had all these ingredients, so I made this. I am on my own, so I cut the recipe in half, and it was great. So easy and nothing much to clean up. I usually just kind of wing it with tuna casserole, and sometimes it’s a bit dry or too soupy, but this was perfect. Thank you for posting this.

I made some additions and changes. I added chopped water chestnuts,  sliced green onions, onion flakes,  celery salt, onion powder, curry powder, fresh ground pepper, grated Mexican mixed cheese on top and Panko. Didn't have any peas so I left them out.  It came out great and tasted delish!

Classic.Add lots of crispy crumbs of any kind on top- crumbled potato chips, bread crumbs such as panco, some grated cheddar, paprika! Oh, and an extra can of dark tuna in oil for the "umami". Happy comfort food!

Seasoned up the breadcrumbs with a little garlic and pepper and parsley. Added cheese threw out. Instead of 2 cans of mushroom soup I used 1 can of cream of bacon soup and 1 can of mushroom soup. Had leftover bacon bits so with the breadcrumbs I sprinkled on top.

Kind of bland, and still too salty despite that. Easy to make though. I might try the cheesy version next time, per the suggestions at the end of the recipe.

It's fine as written, but I added a lot more salt. Added a can of tuna, used heavy cream instead  of milk (as needed, not an entire cup), added some thin pats of butter under the crumb topping,  and I tripled the crumb topping. Turned out great with those alterations.  Its not rocket surgery folks, you can see from the recipe it's not gonna be huge on flavor as written so make some additions to pep it up.

Definitely enjoy making this recipe for meal prep. I always add 1/2 can of Corn, 1/2 bag of frozen spinach, and 1-1/2 cup of French Fried Onions for more flavor. Some reviewers complained about blandness. Put some Garlic Powder and Black pepper (to your liking) into the mix as well! Bread crumbs and cheese on top optional.

It was okay.  Didn't have much flavor.  I remember Mom's tasting a lot better.  I made the recipe as written.  Maybe some modifications would make it better.

Husband and son loved it.  The only change I made was to substitute 1can of cream of celery for a can of cream of mushroom.  I will definitely make this again.

I used the recipe provided but also added bacon bits and some chopped onions. I also used Campbell’s cream of chicken and mushroom. I forgot the bread crumbs so I crushed saltine crackers and croutons with some Parmesan cheese. 
It worked out great!

I seasoned the water that I boiled the pasta in for more flavor and used frozen peas and carrots instead of just peas and mixed Italian seasoned bread crumbs mixed with parmesan cheese for the topping.  Came out great!

My mother made a slightly different version of this for us growing up, so I modified it slightly bc I loved her version and it brings back fond memories. 
I used 3 cans of tuna, added a little lemon pepper seasoning, only used 1/2 cup of milk. Omitted the peas. 
For the topping I melted 1/4 cup of butter, mixed with 1/2 sleeve of crushed up saltine crackers and topped with that before baking. I baked this in a 9x13 dish. 
I love that this meal is so economical and easy. Its great if you are on a tight budget and it's filling. I can see why my mother made it! Hot, creamy and delicious!

I made this last night for my daughter and the only thing I changed was substituting potatoe chips for bread crumbs.  That's how my Mom topped it and she is gone now so I wanted it as close to hers as possible and this recipe brought back fond memories!!  Thank you

Added broccoli and sautéed onions. Salt, pepper, garlic powder, parsley flakes, and dried chives for spices. Also added about 1/4 cup milk for creaminess and topped with a light amount of cheese instead of breadcrumbs. Fantastic!

This is a classic recipe for me. I only add more bread crumbs and butter and have them on top from the beginning of baking.  I have never added any spices and have been very happy with the taste but I'd still try some of the suggestions others have done.

Instead of using cream of mushroom soup, we used cream of onion soup, only because we don't like mushrooms.  I had also added  onions that I cooked in butter only til translucent.  My son who is very picky ate about half of the casserole himself.   Thank you for this recipe.

I added two cloves of garlic, replaced the condensed soup with chicken and broccoli condensed soup, added salt and pepper. I also used saltine crackers with parmesean cheese and shredded cheese, with butter for the topping. Perfect! 
For chicken I used condensed potato soup and chicken, corn instead of  peas and 2-3  cubed chicken.

This is almost the same recipe my mom used when I was a child but she added sour cream, celery and cashews with hers too and then topped with half a can of french fried onions instead of breadcrumbs. It was so good.

I made it. It's similar to my mother's recipe but I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, added a little bit of garlic salt, some cubed Velveeta cheese and then put crushed potato chips on top about ten minutes before it came out the oven.   My husband loved it and he generally doesn't like tuna casserole.

I made this and like some of the other comments this was pretty bland.  Having seen the comments I added some seasonings, parmesan cheese, substituted a cream of celery soup for one of the cream of mushrooms, and topped with crispy french fried onions.  I like the taste with using the french fried onions as the topping, but next time I will not skimp on the topping.

Exactly what you'd hope for!  Comfort food & highly versatile.  This time I used elbows (entire box) , cr chicken & cr mushroom soup & much more milk.  Cooked broccoli & threw in a little velvetta.  Last 5 min at 400... mixed fried onions.. shredded parm cheese & Romano cheese placed that on top & dabbed with about 3 tbsp of cold butter.  Really great, hardy comfort food for a windy snowy day in NY !!! ??

I made this recipe and added a few extras, celery, onion, garlic powder, pepper, carrots, and mixed ritz crackers and fried onions, butter for the top.  I did not add cheese because my son isn't a fan, but he likes all of the ingredients in this dish (he did not like this, however).  Although the recipe was easy, it was very bland even after I added the extra items.  Also, I wish I would have covered during the first 30 minutes as the top of the noodles cooked too hard and were crunchy.  Not sure I would make this again.

Made this but added spices because from the recipe you could tell it would turn out bland. Added some red pepper flakes, basil, parsley, and oregano. Also, instead of bread crumbs used french's crispy onions (1/2 cup). Instead of frozen peas, used canned. With these tweeks it turned out super yummy. Had two servings. Would definitely make again.

I've always loved tuna casserole but never knew how easy it is to make!!!  This recipe was very easy to follow, it was delicious, and I'll definitely make it again.   It was extra special with the panko bread crumb topping, made with panko bread crumbs, butter and parmesan cheeze.  A big THANK YOU to the person who suggested we not skimp on the topping.

We have made this a couple of times. I tweaked mine, it comes out rather watery. I add one tablespoon cornstarch to some cold water and mix it in before putting it in the oven. Don't skimp on the toppings make it as creative as you want.

I used salmon in place of Tuna. A good casserole to have with a green salad.

I made a half recipe.  Used rotini pasta and grated parm instead of bread crumbs.   Also added some seasoning, garlic powder, black pepper, and season salt.   Quick,  easy, and tasted good.

The recipe is a good base recipe. I replaced the peas with corn(my family does not like peas). I didn't have any egg noodles so I used a different type of noodle-still great. I did add some seasoning as others suggested: garlic powder, salt and pepper. Also I added crushed chips and a little bit of parmesan cheese to the topping. I did not cook for 30 minutes, I cooked for 25 min and then with the topping an additional 5 minutes
(good thing or it may have been dry). Overall, it came out to be an easy, fast and tasty recipe.

Ahh, Childhood in a casserole dish! My mom always used enough milk to clean out the soup cans. Then there is the changes to this recipe. I add 1/4 cup mayo and smash a sleeve of saltine crackers for the topping! I cook on 375 for 20 minutes and that gets the crackers browned. I still get asked for this by my children at least twice a month.

Yummy!  Very easy to make, I tweaked a little and used French's fried onions and parmesean/Romano cheese.  Good comfort food  for a nice cold day.

Instead of cream of mushroom soup, I use canned or fresh mushrooms and a bit of sour cream. I also add Parmesan cheese to the bread crumb topping with some pepper, salt, and a smidge of garlic salt.

I did add some flavor the casserole: a small, chopped and  sauted onion, a bit of fresh basil and a little ground red pepper (not much red pepper), and salt and pepper.  I top with crumbled "Texas-toast cubed bread crumbs" and melted butter a few minutes before the casserole was done. Sometimes I top with shredded cheddar cheese or French fried onions.

Serve with a simple salad or crusty bread and everyone is happy. That is my goal and yes, this is easy. One other change - I make this in a large bowl and transfer to the casserole dish when ready to oook. Much easier to handle.

I  added 3/4 cup hellmann's mayo and garlic powder and thyme.  I also put more like five cups of the noodles.  I also took the advice of the other review and added ritz crackers, butter and parmesan cheese all mixed together on top. It was amazing!

Classic! I lightly sautéed some carrots and onion (until clear), and stirred that in when combining. I added some black pepper to the dish and some Mrs Dash to the breadcrumb mixture. It had great flavor and paired nicely with a cheap white wine.

I've used this basic recipe for years.  I usually omit the peas but add salt and pepper.  My husband prefers it unbaked and without the topping, just mixed together with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes.  I've also used cheddar cheese soup instead and added some leftover taco cheese.

I've been using this recipe for years!  I originally found it in a cookbook given to me as a wedding gift - Back of the Box Gourmet.  The classics are always the best.  We do double the soup and noodles and using either Cream of Mushroom or Cream of Celery, you can't go wrong for a great classic comfort food.

This was a good base. Added a lot of garlic, thyme, and salt as well as doubled the bread crumbs and added Parmesan for the topping. Only needed to cook for 20ish minutes and then another couple minutes for the topping.

I did a lot of things differently in this recipe just by looking at reviews and making changes and my family loved it. This is what I changed. Added some seasons half tsp each of pepper, garlic powder and onion salt. Baked 350 25 minutes then took out and put lays plain potatoe chips crumbled with a tablespoon butter and 1/4 cup parmeson sprinkled on top. Then turned temp up to 375 and baked about 10 minutes. All of this was uncovered. Also I added more milk 1/2 cup so it wouldn't be dry. And I only put 1/2 cup frozen peas. My Family loved it.

Ive always used this recipe. Tho i too have made slight variations. I add a good bit of garlic powder, because i LOVE garlic, i add chopped onions, a good hearty dose of shredded cheddar inside mixed with all the other ingredients. Then on top instead of bread crumbs i use another hearty dose of cheddar and a very hearty helping of french fried onions... Mmmm it is deliciousness in a pan!!

Good recipe. Made changes as usual. Took lindz advice with the garlic powder and thyme. Mixed it all up, put in pan. Topped with a generous sprinkle of pepper, then I added my topping:  1 1/2 c.panko crumbs mixed with 3 1/2 tbsp of cold butter and an eyeball measure of parmesan cheese and dried chopped onion.

Great basic recipe Modified : I added garlic,Cup of Fresh mushrooms i had in the Fridge,Sub. can of Tuna for a can of Crab (6oz.),Sub. can of Mushroom soup for a can of Celery Soup. Dash of salt and Fresh Pepper., used Lactose Free Milk.  I did not use any Topping I figured I was consuming enough Carbs with the Noodles and saved on the Fat minus the Butter.

Amazing casserole.  I did use frozen mixed veggies instead and it added some color.  I kept the crumb topping the same.  I used albacore tuna.  I made the 4 serving version in an 8x8" square dish.

This was an easy enough recipe and it tasted great. I did, however, add 1 tablespoon more of breadcrumbs (and my breadcrumbs were just mashed up croutons) which worked wonderfully to add some extra flavor. I also recommend sea salt and pepper to taste. (Baking it with generic seasonings like Season All probably wouldn't hurt, either.)

Great recipe! I used Ritz Crackers instead of bread crumbs because that's what my mom always did, and I halved the amount of tuna, but it turned out excellent. Really creamy and delicious!

I used whole wheat noodles so I think this is fairly healthy. 30 minutes of baking was too long though, the noodles got crunchy and brown on top. I would suggest maybe covering it with foil. The breadcrumb/buter topping doesn't really seem necessary and it needs some seasoning!

Made this yesterday, and it was okay. A bit dry, but that could have been that I did half recipe in a medium casserole dish. Next time I'll use a smaller dish, and add more milk. I didn't use pimentos, but I did use the extra small peas. I added cheddar cheese to the mixture too like most others, and black pepper.  Today, I did a half recipe but instead of regular tuna, I put in a can of Spicy Thai flavoured tuna, and it was YUMMMM! For a full recipe, I'd use one regular can of tuna, and one of the Spicy Thai.

I love this plain and simple recipe which takes no time to prepare at all.  Wonderful taste.  I half it for two.

The first few times I made this I used tuna, but it tasted too fishy for me.  So, I tried using canned chicken and loved it!  I also leave out the eggs and peas.. it's much easier that way and still tastes great :)

Terrific, we added cheddar cheese over the top and the Lays original kettle cooked chips, crushed, over that for 10 minutes more. Husband and kids could only say, "WOW". Good luck to you. Oh, by the way we used wheat pasta, fusilli, Amazaing.

This is the way I remember tuna noodle casserole from when I was a kid (minuse the bread crumb topping). I made this tonight by boiling the egg noodles in water before adding them to a large can of tuna with one can cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup milk. I forgot to add the peas in. I baked for 15 minutes then added the cheese and baked another 10 minutes. Very yummy and the perfect reminder of childhood. My 1 1/2 year old loved this.... Thanks campbells.

This tasted ok. It was simple and I had everything on hand, but if I make this again I will add seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder). I did double the bread crumb/butter and there was just the right amount, I think dried onions would enhance this a lot.

I read some reviews and also used 1 can of cream of celery soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom and it was much better.  I also used bread crumbs and then the 2nd time I made it using bread crumbs and dried onions and it was much better the second time.

This was a very easy recipe to make.  My husband enjoyed the tuna noodle casserole, but I have tasted much better.  For me it tasted like a cheap version of tuna noodle casserole.  The campbell's mushroom soup was too overwhelming.  Also, I thought there was way too many peas compared to everything else.  I will not make this again.

Although hesitant, this was actually really good!  I have bad memories of casseroles from my childhood, but the combination of flavors was great and it reheated nicely. I hate when people change the recipes, but my family does not like peas so I left those out and added cheese to the mixture instead.

The base recipe is pretty good. It's needs a little twist. I tried it just as is, but I just couldn't get used to the peas. Next time I tried it I used broccoli. It did taste much better, but something is still missing. Maybe next time I will try it with one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of celery

This is so easy! I cut the recipe exactly in half and it was great - 1/2 of the recipe is perfect for two people. I added some parmesan cheese also.  I will use fewer peas next time, but that is just personal preference - I'm not a huge pea fan and all of the casseroles I've had before seemed like they had fewer peas too. I will definitely use this recipe forever.

I only use one can of soup because if it's too creamy my kids don't like it as well. I also add velveeta in the casserole with dried minced onions, and crushed potato chips for the topping. I do not use peas because none of us like them! Very good classic recipe!

Can be a 5 star if you add monteray jack and cheddar cheese (a really good helping of it) right into the casserole and then top with bread crumbs.

My roomate thought this was really good and wants the recipe.  I however thought is was okay.  It was probably the easiest thing I've ever made though.  You just throw everything togeter and pop it in the oven.

Even though I don't particularly care for tuna and don't eat a lot of pasta, this was still really good.  I plan on trying this again using chicken.  My daughter and boyfriend loved it with the tuna and would have me make it at least once a month.

This was a classic tuna casserole recipe. I mixed grated cheese, italian bread crumbs and butter and baked it for the entire time. The italian bread crumbs added a nice hint of garlic.
