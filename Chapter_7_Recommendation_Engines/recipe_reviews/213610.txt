Loved it!  The combination of the different flavors from the roots were wonderful.  Next time I am going to cut back on the butternut squash a little and add more parsnips and celery root.  I have never cooked with celery root before but now it's my favorite.  The only thing I would add to this recipe is to stir in herbs.  I used basil and dill and I think it added a little more flavor (not that it was lacking)

I just made this and it is delicious.  I added 3 cloves of garlic to the celery and onion while I cooked that.  I also added some garlic powder, cumin, and dried parsley to the soup while it simmered.  I think cumin goes very well with root vegetables.  Thanks for the great recipe!  This is the perfect thing for a cold winter day.

I made this tonight but tweaked it to my personal liking.  I had no parsnips so used 4 turnips, substituted garlic rosemary bread dipping blend for the salt and pepper.  I added 2 leeks and garlic to the onion, celery, and butter.  I used 2 1/2 Tbls vegetable paste, 1 cup white wine (Chardonnay), and 6 cups of water to make the broth.  Then I added the roasted vegies.  It looked so good as it was that I didn't puree it or add the cream.  It turned out great, will definitely make this again and again.  I had never used celery root but will from now on, and  I will have to try it with the parsnips as I'm sure it will add another great flavor.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I served this as a starter for a 5-course meal on New Year's Eve...so for simplicity sake, I placed all the prepared vegetables in my roaster, along with the onion, 4 cloves of garlic, canola oil, and the seasonings. I roasted them @ 350F for 2 hours, stirring once every 25 mins. I then placed the roaster on my stove top, scraped down the sides with a whisk, and while adding the vegetable broth...I pureed it with my hand-held blender. Instead of adding the cream, I served it with a dollop of fat-free sour cream.  Although my guests begged for seconds, I made them hold off until after the 5th course was served. Needless to say I ended up sending them home with the left over soup.

Wow, this was GREAT!  I couldn't get celery root, but it was wonderful just the same. I subbed skim milk for the half-&-half and chicken broth for the vegetable broth because that's all I had on hand. At the end, I added about 1/3 cup orange juice and some nutmeg to taste.  A tasty way to warm up a chilly Autumn day :-)

This has a good flavor and I like the combination of veggies.  Some problems I ran into:  Butternut squash roasts to fork tender much more quickly than some of the other things being roasted!  So, by the time I had everything soft, some of the veggies had begun to crisp & brown!  Once I started to puree, it became more "mashed veggie" consistency than soup.  I added more broth, ran out of veggie broth...and moved on to chicken broth!  Maybe I had more veggies than called for?  I dislike amounts like "3 carrots" instead of 3 ounces, or 2 cups.  The carrots I grabbed were the smallest in the bag, but still larger than others I've bought (farmer's market veggies vs. store veggies?)!  My sweet potato was kind of large, b/c the alternative was 2 very small ones & I thought the big one looked nicer on the outside.  So, maybe I had too many veggies, in the end I just added more liquid to help boost it...but I do think this could use some more herbs.

Very nice soup.  I used broth I made from a combination of veg tips an peels that I saved in a zip bag in the freezer and some veg that I roasted.  Much better than packaged and you control the salt.  I needed two quarts of broth to thin this enough to eat....still quite thick.  I added nutmeg and the grated peel of one orange at the end.  This really made it pop. Otherwise, no other changes.  Served with paninis made with swiss, provolone, tomato and proscuitto.  Yummy!

I really liked it! I woke today and it was 12 degrees outside. Been carrying this around for a while now and finally made it.never cook much with parsnips, butternut squash, and never with celery root. I pretty much followed the recipe but did take a few hints from the other reviews. I used four parsnips, 2 celery roots, I did add about a tsp of dried basil, a tsp of dill weed. I also used one whole chopped sweet onion and two cloves of minced garlic. Because I increased those items it took almost 1 pint of half and half and almost 32 oz boxes of vegetable broth. The result was creamy smooth and not too sweet and not bitter at all. Warming this soup tomorrow will be fantastic! The only thing that you may want change is cutting up the turnips more as I found cutting them into even eights required more than an hour to cook them through.
Thank you! This a unique soup and one to keep!!!

This was very hearty and delicious.  I added some fresh rosemary.  I decided to try the soup without using vegetable or other flavored broth, just for fun. I used 6 cups of water because I added a lot of extra vegetables, like parsley root, mushrooms, and leeks.  Cutting all those raw root vegetables is big job, and kind of dangerous! Also added some lemon pepper and cumin.  It is great without the added cream, too.  It would be easier to use Mrs. CMBG's roaster idea, but I forgot to try that method.  Instead, I lined my roasting pan with foil and sprayed it lightly with oil, and after roasting, I found I was able to just pick the foil up and funnel the vegetables into the pot.

I had made Sean's Mommy's Roasted Root Veggies from this site earlier this week. And with only 3 in the household, there were plenty of leftovers. So I made this soup to use them up. Cut the time down quite a bit since the veggies were already roasted earlier in the week. Wonderful flavor. Loved it!!! Thanks.

This is one of the best soups I've ever made. Maybe it's because I finally broke down and bought a VitaMix blender, but this came out so velvety smooth--absolutely amazing! And the roasted veggies were so flavorful. Normally I like to add fresh herbs and/or garlic, but I didn't think this needed it at all. I used all olive oil and subbed coconut milk for cream. I'll be making this often throughout the fall and winter!

SO GOOD!!!  I only pureed about 1/2 the soup and left the rest whole veggies so that the family would eat it.  I loved everything about this soup!!!  I thought the pureed soup part was the best so next time I'll just make if for myself so I can puree all of it!  So flavorful and perfect for fall/winter!  Thanks!

Our family thought this was pretty good.  I gave it 4 stars because I didn't have celery root or turnips on hand, so I left them out (but I did sprinkle a little celery seed in with the onions), so I don't know how this exact recipe would taste.  I put 3 small cloves of garlic in with the onions & used milk instead of cream.  Tasted great & felt pretty healthy too!

I mixed up the root veggies, added a little extra broth and it tasted amazing. Didn't even need to add the half and half because the veggies had so much flavor.

A local Irish restaurant in town serves root soup and I wanted to find the recipe.  This is VERY close!  It was delicious.  The only thing I did different was I did add Garlic and I had some rutabaga that I added from our garden.  Some are saying the texture was too 'baby food like'.  That is exactly what root soup is!  :)  If you are adding more broth, then saying it is too bland - that is why.  If you add too much broth you are watering down the taste of the veggies.  I served this with some home made Irish Brown Bread.  It was delicious!

Everyone loved this soup!. I added a couple of cloves of garlic and some fresh rosemary and thyme when I roasted the veggies. Also used olive oil instead of butter and silken tofu instead of cream, as I am vegan.  Served with a dustng of cayenne pepper.

I doubled the recipe to take it to a friend who had a baby, and it turned out very bitter. Maybe I used too many turnips, but it was not good. I did not have celery root and I substituted carnival squash for butternut. I would not make this recipe again. The liquid portions are way off as well. I had to add 3 additional cups of liquid to make it a soup consistence vs. baby food.

Very versatile soup. Add more or less of each vegetable to change the flavor. We're going to try it with a little roasted garlic next time. Very tasty!

Delicious!  I made this for myself, I didn't think my family would like it.  Well what a surprise!  They loved it!!  Roasting the veggies improves the flavour so much. Even the veggies we don't normally like much, the routabega became sweet. The only change I made was I didn't add the cream, I'm not a fan, and I don't think the soup really needs it.  It's rich enough without.

This can easily become a vegan recipe by omitting the cream. It tasted good without. Turnips never did get soft eventhough I doubled the baking time. Delicious. I love the candied taste of root vegetables when roasted

I enjoyed the comfort food quality of this but I wasn't crazy about it.  I subbed olive oil for the butter and used a little flour & water to thicken it instead of adding the half 'n half (on a vegan diet) and it was plenty thick & creamy.  I used only one turnip because after tasting a piece of one raw I thought it was pretty bitter and I ended up wishing I'd left it out entirely.  I didn't have any carrots but thought the sweet potato & squash would lend enough sweetness and they did.  What this soup needed was seasoning and I ended up going with garlic & rosemary, which I really liked.  I didn't have celery or sweet onion so I used a large shallot and 4 plump cloves of garlic instead and really liked the flavor.  I may make this again but will substitute yukon gold potatoes for the turnips.  I honestly think the turnips are what ruined it for me.  They were just too bitter.  Tasted like there were radishes in the soup.

It was sooooo good!  I used some different veggies, basically what I had on hand.  I didn't add any cream or milk but used almond milk instead and it worked out fine.

This is a winner.  It's cold out side and nothing like a homemade soup.  Flavor was good but I would like to bump it up.  Next time I'll add more herbs, probably garlic and maybe cumin.

Delicious. I didn't have parsnips or sweet potato so I added more turnips and more carrots.  I used a whole instead of a half onion, and added, as others did, garlic,  cumin and parsley.  My main modification was to substitute non-fat plain yogurt for the half and half. I like the tang it added.

FANTASTIC!!  Some of us sprinkled cumin on the soup and some of us sprinkled some dill.  I also garnished each bowl with a few slivered almonds.
Lots of chopping and peeling, but so worth it!!

I made this soup last night and although the terms used were imprecise, I found that it was a really good foundation to start from. I didn't have any turnips so I just put in more of the other vegetables. Like others I added some other spices & seasonings such as a couple cloves of garlic, some italian seasoning; it turned out really good! And I used fat-free milk but I don't think it even needed it. Also, my sister hates carrots and she even thought it was tasty! Thanks for the recipe. :)

Roasting the vegetables first gave it a wonderful flavor. The sweet potato added a nice level of sweetness. It is a hearty winter soup.  I served it with a nice crusty french bread

Many adjustments are required in this recipe.  I agree with another reviewer that the amount of liquids needed are significantly more than cited.  Some good flavor, but with some bitter tones.  I'll opt out of using celery root and use much more cream next time.  I'll also adjust portions of other veggies.

This is probably the best soup I have made. I did not purée all the vegetables because I like chunky soups. I also did not add the cream. The soup has so many wonderful flavors and freezes really well.

The only changes I made were to use coconut milk instead of half-and-half, and coconut oil instead of butter. I thought it was a lot of work for a merely okay soup.  It was so bland that I added fresh parsley and rosemary. It will freeze well, but I didn't think it was anything special.

Very tasty and a great use for root vegetables.  I did roast all veggies and 3 cloves of garlic for 2 hours at 325 (the lower temperature allowed everything to roast without being too charred).  My hand blender was useless and I used my regular blender.  Water was required to even use the regular blender (too cheap to add vegetable broth).  I did not add the half and half.  This made an ice cream pail full of blender veggies with the consistency of baby food - it was still that thick.  Chilled in the fridge overnight.

Reheated it  in my crock pot (added more water to get the consistency I wanted).  And served with a scoop of sour cream in each bowl.  Wonderful.  I chose not to add additional seasoning.

I did think about leaving some not pureed but was afraid that the picky eaters would only eat the things they liked.

This soup is delicious! i took the advice of some others and added 1 tsp of parsley, basil, and cumin (although i should have added less cumin because it's a little too much), and 1/2 tsp dill. i added more parsnips because there were 2 left in the bag and I didnt want to waste them. i also added another quart of vegatable broth.This was a project, for sure! it took me several hours to make, but i love it and i will definately make it sgain!

I used 1 leek instead of onion, added 2 cloves of roasted garlic, 2 quarts of chicken broth, kept out sweet potato and added 3 extra carrots instead. I don't think it needed the cream, it was delicious as is. I'm in love with celeriac and never had it before. Great way to use up the last week of my crop share veggies.

I made this recipe because it caught my eye in the daily e-mail.  My hubby and I both love roasted vegetables so I thought hey why not.  I wanted it to last for several meals so I doubled the veggies, the broth and the half-n-half.  I knew my hubby would like chunky soup better than a smooth soup so when it came time to do the pureeing, I only pureed half the vegetables.  Then I mixed everything together in my crock pot and cooked it on low for about 4 hours.  We finished it off tonight and he is still raving about what a great soup it is.  This one is definitely a keeper and I am already planning to make it again in a couple weeks.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!!!

Tried this last night for the first time and except for adding a little additional spice and doing some minor substitutions, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fabulous. I couldn't find celery root at my store so I omitted it. I subbed turnip with rutabaga because it's sweeter in taste and not as bitter. Finally I added heavy whipping cream instead of 1/2 & 1/2. Veggies were nice and soft after roasting for 40 minutes, and it was easy to purée them in the dutch oven with a handheld mixer. Beyond salt and pepper, I added 3 generous tsp of garlic, a little bit of cumin, and some garlic powder. The soup had the consistency of a pea soup; a little thick but this is how it's supposed to be. I served it with warm demi baguettes and a glass of Merlot and all I can say is this recipe is a keeper for cold winter nights when you want something warm and filling, but also healthy. I gotta say that this recipe has also inspired me to do a lot more roasted vegetables with dinner because it's so easy and they're so good right out of the oven! Thanks for sharing this great winter soup recipe!

Very good. Since I need to be diary free I used olive oil instead of butter and cashew milk rather than half and half. Very nice hearty soup.

I just finished making this.  My wife raved about it.  I had some with a little sour cream and it was absolutely delicious.   The only ingredient I didn't have was celery root so I added celery.  Also I added more chicken stock.

This was amazing!! I cooked it in my dutch oven over a campfire, and didn't change too much.  Added 2 quarts of broth, which seemed needed for all the veggies.  I did not roast the veggies, but simply sautéed them in dutch oven pot for 20 min first.  DELISH!

This soup is so good!  I didn't have turnips, but otherwise made as per the recipe.  I found I needed much more stock to get a "soupy" consistency, but that meant I had much more soup!  It freezes well.

So delicious. I modified as others suggested by doubling the broth (needed it), and adding garlic, parsley and cumin.  I did not add half-and-half and served sour cream on the side.  It was a hit!

I made this with a big bulb of fennel instead of celeriac, and I eyeballed the rest of the ingredients. Turned out super thick, so I added some milk until the mixture was more soup-like. Used my trusty immersion stick blender to puree it up just a little bit - wanted each bite of soup to have distinct vegetable flavors.

I was looking for a recipe to use some leftover roasted root veggies, so I tried this one. Per other reviews, I added cumin, salt, pepper, and a little garlic salt, and I followed the recipe (except for the celery root). The first few bites were good and hearty, but then it started tasting a little like dirt; the earthiness was a little heavy. The veggies I had were butternut squash, sweet potato, red onion, parsnips, carrots, zucchini, yellow squash, mushrooms, and red onion. I'm sure it was a combination of my own "operator error" and the veggies I used, but I was a little disappointed.

Delicious!  I made a few changes - more carrots and onions, less butternut squash because it was what I had on hand.  I actually loved the consistency, and I used exactly the amount of liquid suggested; I love a thick and hearty soup on a cold day!  

My favorite additions: cumin and nutmeg to give it a little kick, and when serving, if you REALLY want to indulge, add a little goat cheese to the bowl after serving.  Yuuum!

I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I omitted the sweet potato because I didn't have one and used chix broth in lieu of vegatable.  I also added some chopped leeks to the veggies during roasting.  Came out delicious.  The soup is amazing even without the  1/2 'n 1/2 so make sure you try it before adding.   I just added a half of what it called for but next time I think I will leave out entirely to save calories.  I also sprinkle some cumin in my bowl and it is wonderul.

This is so good!  I really wanted to add spices but resisted (with great effort) to see how the flavors of the veggies would meld.  I did add several garlic cloves to the roasting pan, though.  I skipped the cream mad the blender and just used my potato masher to mash it up so there are some slight chunks.  The flavor is really great and I will definitely make this again....and again....

Great soup - added some dried rosemary and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  Added fresh parsley and also a pinch of nutmeg - did not add milk or half and half as the soup was creamy enough without these. Made a complete meal with a side salad and naan bread.

Great tasting soup. The entire family loved it - even the vegetable haters! I roasted a head of garlic too and added the roasted cloves to the soup. Wonderful flavor. Also added 1/2 cup of asiago cheese. Making it again tomorrow!

Made as it read only thing is that my veggies may have been larger than the recipe needed so I had to add more broth/liquid. Also, if you don't want it to be the consistency of baby food (which I liked) then do not puree all of the soup. My husband would have preferred I left it whole in the broth. Still, the taste was awesome and it froze well! Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious! I did make some changes, but I think it would have been delicious as written. I followed others’ suggestions and added three cloves of garlic to the onion and celery and a teaspoon each of nutmeg and cumin to the pot after the vegetables had been added. The soup was so good! I liked the purée texture, and I thought the turnip (I only used one because it was large) added a unique flavor. I took off one star because the directions were not precise in terms of the specific amount of each vegetable (for example, one sweet potato instead of 4 ounces or 500 grams).

I used unsweetened almond milk instead of half and half.  Next time im thinking about adding lentils...

I followed the recipe and find the soup to have a very mild taste.. I have a sense that it needs something else to kick it up maybe a spice for example cloves or top it with cheese. This recipe yields a large quantity of soup..

I used leeks instead of onion, and red potatoes instead of squash, because that is what I had on hand.  I used chicken stock and white wine, adding water as needed. I added about a Tblsp. of Liquid Smoke, and there was enough soup for 10 servings.  It came out delicious.

Very simple and tasty. I used what I had, carrots, parsnips, sweet potatoes, and golden potatoes, then the onion and I added some garlic. Just mashed it all in the end instead of pureeing it, and didn't add the cream. It came out more like porridge in consistency but it was still delicious. The sweetness and savory flavors work really well together.

I followed the recipe exactly and loved it. The ingredients make a really big pot of soup. I don’t have an immersion blender so I used my Bullet blender. That was a little messy and took much longer than I imagine the immersion blender would. I created small batches in the Bullet to share with friends tomorrow. 
I did end up using more vegetable broth to smooth it out. It is scrumptious!

Made it. Love it!
I've never worked with turnips and parsnips before, so wasn't sure what to expect, but very happy with the outcome.
This is a hearty soup that you can thicken or thin to your liking. Perfect for a cold winter day.

Note: no major alterations to the recipe as stated.

Just made it! So tasty! I used fennel bulb in place of celery root and canned coconut milk in place of the half n half (just my preference). Thank you for this great recipe!

I made a few changes.  I hate turnip so I omitted that!  I had a box of veggies that the kids in the area we're selling.  I used about 6 sweet potatoes, 6 white potatoes, 2 celery stalks, a small onion and 2 carrots.  I also used low sodium vegetable stock.  It turned out delicious!!! Even though I broke my blender I definitely will be making it again.

Yum. So good. The only ingredient manipulation I did was added a small yam (in addition to the sweet potato), because I had to use it up. Instead of a hand/immersion blender, I poured the soup in small batches into my Vitamix. I first tried it with a hand blender and the results were pathetic. In the Vitamix, the soup came out super creamy.  I don't feel like this soup needs any extra spices, though something like a pinch of nutmeg, clove, and/or cinnamon might be interesting to try. I'll sprinkle a bit on my next bowl and see how that goes. Not necessary, though. The flavours of the veggies combine to a rich, delicious soup that stands on its own.

I needed to double the amount of broth

I followed the recipe exactly but the celery root was fibrous and hard to eat.  The taste of soup was good.  The last two celery roots purchased were this way, very fibrous.  I must search on how to peel a celery root to just leave the soft inner part.  I roasted the vegies the night before which made the soup very easy to make the next day.  Thanks Loosenup

I have made this soup twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe with the exception of using acorn squash in place of butternut which we don't care for.  I also took some suggestions for adding garlic and nutmeg.  While the roasted veggies were simmering in the broth-prior to pureeing-I tasted it and loves it.  The flavor was so good and it looked so appealing that I considered just stopping there.  But I followed the recipe and pureed and added the half & half - really wished I hadn't!!  It was so thick that my immersion blender was bogging down so I had to add more broth and that really weakened the flavor.  I just was not happy with it after pureeing.  The next time I made it without pureeing and skipped the half & half.   Much better IMHO.  It does need more seasoning.  I used garlic,nutmeg, ginger,parsley, S&P,rosemary and some basil.

I made this one a cold weekend and shared it with neighbors and friends. They said it was the best they had had ....The second time I made it, I used 2% milk in place of cream and I added some garlic and finely minced bell pepper to the sautee onions. I also used oregano , thyme and curry to the roasted vegetables....it gave a full range of flavors. This is a rich and filling soup.

This turned out PERFECTLY!  I can't say it enough!  I stuck to the recipe as best as I could- my local store didn't have any celery root or vegetable broth (so weird), so I added in yellow carrots that I had on hand and extra sweet potato and used sodium free chicken broth instead.  I also used maybe a 1/4 cup of half-and-half because we have a lactose issue in my house.  I read the reviews and was worried that I too would have a bad broth-to-veggies ratio, but after I blended everything up, it turned into an amazingly delicious puree.  I can't wait to make it again!  It was warm and comforting on a windy, cold, drizzly day in Southern New England.

Instead of adding cream at the end, I put a cup full of the broth and blended it with almonds. This gave the soup a very nice creaminess without the dairy.  Great soup!
