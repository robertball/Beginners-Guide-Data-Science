Wow....really great recipe! I don't know why someone would say this was runny other than I don't think I'd use frozen squash if it was already the "runny" type. I used buttercup squash, baked it for an hour - the squash was really dry and when I added the remaining ingredients (just one tbsp of curry powder ), and cooked...yum...it was fantastic! I would definitely make this again.

This was fun to make and different for my family. Loved the way the curry just enhanced the flavors. My hubby didn't care for the texture but enjoyed the taste. May add a potato next time to thicken it up and add some creaminess to it.

I had some frozen winter squash on hand so thought I'd try this with dinner since it was so quick and easy.

It's not *bad* but it might just not be to my taste.  It's a little spicy for me so I would cut down the cayenne pepper or maybe leave it out entirely.  But again, that's purely my taste.  If you like spicy - leave the recipe as-is.

But ultimately I found it unsatisfying.  I felt like I was eating a sauce.  I think this might be really good WITH something.  Maybe over rice, or even chicken.  It has a definite Indian flair that I like, it just needs to be paired with something.

Tastes good not great (haven't tasted a great squash recipe yet :) but a good way to add that healthful curry and coconut to your diet.  Also very easy. I didn't try it with the cayenne.

I used the exact recipe with the exception of the toasted coconut.  I prepared it early and put it in a casserole to heat in the oven for dinner tonight.  The flavor is surprisingly good... very complex ... the curry is fairly subtle as is the sweetness from the maple syrup. (Use real MS not imitation) The cayenne adds a little heat as an aftertaste which gets your attention without being significantly hot. Overall a very nice surprise as I did not know what to expect.

Very good, easy, and a new way to eat winter squash.  I'm going to try adding some broth and cream and turning it in to a soup.
