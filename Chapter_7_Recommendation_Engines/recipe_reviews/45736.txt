I have visited 4 different Indian restaurants over the last 2 years (since being introduced to Indian food).  I LOVE chicken tikka masala.  This recipe tastes above and beyond all the restaurants I've been to.  It's also at least twice as spicy.  During my first attempt at this recipe I made it verbatim minus the salt.  Turned out perfect but a bit spicy for my taste.  My second batch was double.  Again I left out the salt (per reviewers' suggestions) and halved the cayenne.  Deliciously met my Indian food requirements.  My suggestions to you all:  1. Leave out the salt altogether  2. The recipe as written is pretty spicy.  Make it the first time as written (minus the salt), but if the spiciness is more/less what you want than modify it the next time.
3. Please don't diss this recipe without trying a few modifications of your own.  This is the first chicken tikka masala recipe I ever tried.  It turned out wonderfully, but it was way too spicy in the beginning and I listened to the salt warnings, so I modified it slightly.  This is the only recipe I will ever use for this meal.  !!!!!  :-)

This was sooo good!  We loved it!  I did make some changes.  In the marinade, I used 1 tsp. garam masala instead of cinnamon, and only 1 tsp salt.  I marinated all day.  For the sauce, I used 3 cloves garlic.  I doubled the amount of the sauce, which I would definitely recommend doing or there won't be enough to soak up with rice. :)  For a doubled recipe, I used 2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp paprika, and 3 tsp garam masala (garam masala is KEY!) and only 1/2 tsp salt.  I used a 15oz can of tomato sauce and about 1.75 cups heavy cream (we'll try coconut milk next time).  Seriously, this tasted just like the chicken tikka masala we get at our favorite Indian restaurant.  Would be delicious with Naan!

Excellent with the following changes--1) For medium heat, omit all cayenne pepper.  Believe it or not the black pepper in the marinade provides plenty of heat. 2) Choose a jalapeno pepper with a rounded tip & remove the seeds.  The rounder the more mild, the more pointed the hotter the pepper. 3) Aside from a sprinkle of salt in the sauce, omit all salt. 4) If you don't want to fire up the grill, make a makeshift "grill" using a cookie rack over a foil-lined cookie sheet.  Place the marinated chicken on the rack and broil on high (@ 5 min. each side) I also used thigh instead of breast meat & used olive oil instead of butter to saute the garlic & jalepeno. For easy sides, I served with basmati rice, naan, choli/garbanzo beans & raita (all from Trader Joes).  Enjoy!

Good grief! This recipe as written has WAY too much salt in it! My fiance and I couldn't even finish it, the salt was overpowering. 7 teaspoons in all. I am going to try it again with about 1/2 teaspoon for each sauce (the marinade and the tomato cream sauce.)

This is excellent, tastes just like at our local restaurant.  I made the following changes:  for the marinade I used 5 tsp of garam masala in place of the cumin/cinnamon/cayenne (it's a mixture of these spices and others.)  I only used 1 tsp of pepper and 1 tsp of salt plus added two crushed garlic cloves.  I marinated all day.

For the sauce I added one chopped onion and my spice mixture was 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp paprika, 2 tsp garam masala, no salt.  I excluded the jalapeno but added a dash of cayenne.  Wonderful!  The second time I made it I doubled the sauce to have lots of extra to top our basmati rice.

This recipe was so delicious that my toes curled up, I fell over in a pleasure-induced coma, and floated to heaven! I will never have to go to an Indian restaurant again for my favorite dish! The other reviews are right, I used one teaspoon of salt for the marinade and one teaspoon of salt for the sauce, and that was plenty. I also added a teaspoon of garam masala to the sauce. Since it was rainy and dark outside, I couldn't use my grill, so I baked the chicken on a rack at 475 degrees until done, and it came out perfectly fine. I like extra sauce to soak my jasmine rice, so next time I will either add less chicken or more cream and tomato sauce. The Indian restaurant I used to frequent put some thinly sliced almonds for garnish so I may try that next time too. THIS RECIPE IS A KEEPER!

Minus the salt we absolutely loved this recipe!  Added 2 tsp of garam masala to the yogurt marinade.  Never made it to the tomato cream sauce as my boys were hovering around the grill eating the chicken as I removed it.  Absolutely wonderful!

We loved this. I did change a few things after reading a few other reviews. I only added 1/2 the jalapeno pepper, I reduced the salt to 1 tsp in the marinade, and 1/2 tsp in the sauce. I used 1 tsp of garam masala instead of cinnamon in the marinade. I doubled the sauce recipe and added 3 teaspoons of the garam masala to what was already called for. I also marinated the chicken 30 hours; I was going to just marinate it all day, but something came up and we were unable to cook it that night, so I just cooked it the next night. It was tender and delicious. We grilled it on the barbecue and served it over rice with Naan. Thanks for sharing this recipe! 5 Stars with the changes!

This was so salty, we couldn't even eat it!  I should have salted to taste, but instead went by the recipe.  I thought it would be okay since I like salt anyway.  I really can't say how good it would be without all the salt, I can just tell you to definitely taste before you add!

Great recipe - TOO MUCH SALT! Reduce the salt at least by half in both the marinade and sauce. We are making this for the fourth time, so needless to say, it's a great recipe with that small change.

My husband and I love this recipe. have made it 3 times in a month. I followed other suggestions and reduced salt to a 1/4th and used red chilli peppers instead of cayenne.  I also used the fat free half and half and is great.  After the first time, I went to the World Market and but garam masala per another review and substitued that for the cumin in the sauce.  The first time I thought there was too much cumin and reduced it in in the marinade.  At first, the sauce doesn't taste anything like the restaurant, but when you put the marinated chicken in it, it changes the flavor. I am making it regularly, especially since I can't find plain yogurt in anything but a large size. Thank you for this delicious easy recipe.

Excellent, except for the salt.  Take heed of all the warnings and REDUCE the SALT.  I used 1 teaspoon each for the marinade and then the sauce.  Simmering the sauce will help concentrate the flavors and you can always add more later.  I find using skinless thighs and breasts is a good combo.  The dark meat adds a lot of flavor and variety to the dish.  I always double the amount of the sauce since it's sooo good over rice.  And pick up some naan bread from your local indian restaurant and to dip in the sauce.  I do this when I have company - quite impressive. Definitely buy Garam Masala.  It's the secret spice that the restaurants use that's not listed in this recipe.  I exclude the cinnamon completely and use 1 teaspoon each in the marinade and sauce.  It will make ALL the difference, trust me.  I also sear my chicken on the stove top or broil in the oven.  If using oven, I only brown the meat and finish the cooking in the sauce.  This will be a regular for us. You can find Garam Masala spice in the spice section at the store.  TIP - I also soak my chicken breast in plain yogurt or buttermilk for at leat 2 hrs. (overnight if you have time) to tenderize the lean breasts.  It will produce tender, moist chicken.

Ok, so this recipe has the potenial to be amazing, but there were a couple of things that need adjustments...thus a rating of 4 stars.  We've learned from other reviews that the first modification is to reduce the salt--I tried 1 tsp in sauce, but next time I will reduce to 1/2 tsp-- I followed a review of doubling recipe for sauce(so you have sauce for rice) and that was great suggestion. Here's how to double: 1 3/4 cups heavy cream, 2(8oz can) tomato sauce, 2 tsp paprika, 3-4 cloves garlic(I used 1 tbsp of minced garlic)2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp garam masala...follow other directions of sauce to suit your tastes. I would advise you add spice because the dish is soo much better with it! If a jalapeno pepper is too spicy, I would suggest a tsp of cayenne pepper or less! A great recipe and with a little tweeking, it will be A+

I am a HUGE fan of Indian food, and this was a delicious version of Chicken Tikka Masala. Not *quite* as good as my favourite Indian restaurant (which I wouldn't expect, since I don't have a tandoor), but definitely good enough to make again and again. Unfortunately, I can't give it a 5 since I made a few modifications. I used fat-free yogurt (had it in the fridge) for the marinade and only added 1 tsp of salt. To the sauce I added an extra clove of garlic, only a pinch of salt, and whole milk instead of heavy cream (again, using what I had in the fridge, but the sauce was plenty thick, so I really don't think it needed the cream). I also added 3 or so shakes of garam masala to the sauce after the 20 min simmer (For people who aren't familiar with garam masala, it's usually added near the end of the cooking time in indian cuisine, because it can take on a bitter taste if cooked too long). I served it with naan, and it was delicious! Thanks so much, Yakuta!

Don't be intimidated by the long list of ingredients.  It was really simple to make, and I had most of the ingredients on hand.  After tasting this, my husband declared we didn't need to go out to an Indian restaurant when we could eat good Indian food at home.  I did substitute half of the cream for evaporated nonfat milk to make it healthier.  I'm so thankful for the previous reviews, which were right on the ball with the salt.  I added none, and it was plenty seasoned from the tomato sauce.  It was fabulous with garlic naan and grilled zucchini with curry spices.

The marinade is perfect, but when I tasted the sauce I knew something was missing. You MUST add 1 tbsp. Garam Masala to the sauce. Without it, it lacks depth. Otherwise, great recipe.

Great recipe but let the chicken marinate overnight for best flavor and tenderness. Also, although boneless chicken breasts are good, try the thighs and legs as well, bone-in. Much better texture and flavor. I always cut up a whole chicken and use everything. Grilling is the secret here, you'll lose a lot of flavor if you don't get the grills marks on the poultry. If you have an Indian Grocery near, try "Pataks" Tikka Masala, a lot less labor intensive and equally delicious. Great recipe!

This dish was so salty that I could not even eat it.  It called for a total of 7 teaspoons of salt and I only put in two teaspoons and it was still totally disgusting.

I am going to give this 5 stars even if it needed to be changed a bit.  First off, I added one teaspoon of salt to each the marinade and the sauce instead of the amount posted.  I also sauteed onion in the butter with the jalapeno before adding the other ingredients.  And, only added one teaspoon of the cayenne because I thought it would be to hot.  We really enjoyed this dish.  I will admit I did sprinkle a tad more salt on the finished product.  We served with white rice and grilled flour tortillas.  Highly recommend.

Taking the advice of so many other reviewers, I eliminated the salt completely and gave the option to add at the dinner table. No one did. I also replaced the cinnamon with garam masala and kept all the other ingredients as written. One other review suggested doubling the sauce and using coconut milk in place of the whipping cream. I did do that and wasn't disappointed. The sauce had a nice creaminess to it and tasted very good. Topped w/ chopped green onions and cilantro and served over brown rice. Also, I'm happy to say that everyone eating tonight joined the clean plate club. Will make again.

Picky, curry-hating husband loved this. A friend prepared it for us, and I was nervous about his reaction. He took seconds, then thirds! We've made it at least three or four times since. Salt according to your taste rather than strictly to the measurements here. The only change I make is to cook the cilantro into the sauce rather than garnishing it fresh--we don't like the taste of fresh cilantro. Great recipe!

I hav emade this recipe a few times now and it jsut keeps getting better. I agree that you don;t need much salt at all and the red pepper is too much for my taste. This time I decided not to cut up the chicken into pieces; I just cut each breast in half. After I marinated it, I baked it in the oven at about 400-425 for 45 mins. It came out so tender!!! After that I sliced it up and put it in the sauce to simmer. It was better than on the grill and much easier!!!

The tikka marinade part was dead on for flavor (minus all the salt and add garam masala), but the sauce was nothing like authentic Indian tikka masala sauce.  It didn't taste bad, but it's not what you'd get from a true Indian restaurant.  I don't know where all these people have been eating their Indian food to review the recipe as exactly or even close to what authentic chicken tikka masala is.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! It can be done much easier than it is written: marinade the chicken as the recipe states. While it is marinading, cook the rice. Remove rice from heat and cook the marinated chicken in a large skillet alongside the sauce. Based on other reviewers suggestions, I cut out most of the salt and skip the cumin, cinnamon, and cayenne in favor of 3 tsp. of garam masala. When the chicken is cooked through, transfer with tongs into the sauce and let simmer for 15 minutes until thicker. This tikka masala is actually even better the second day, when the spices have a chance to meld together and the sauce can thicken. Serve over basmati rice and it is sooooo delicious!

I have eaten chicken tikka masala in many cities.  This bears no resemblance to the real thing other than the color of the sauce.  Don't try this one if you want genuine chicken tikka masala.

Followed this recipe EXACTLY-except less salt. Very dissapointing- Didn't taste anything like what I've had at several Indian Restaraunts.  I really wanted to be able make this at home as it's usually  $10 a pop at the local places.
This recipe has so much cinnamon in it-it gives the dish a weird flavor, in fact I ordered it from my local place and really tried to taste the spices and I don't think there's any cinnamon in their dish. In fact, all of the spices seem to be off, it's missing something (or maybe it's the cinnamon or that covers up all the other spices.) Also, the texture of the sauce was too creamy-the consistancy of melted icecream, not at all like what I'm used to. I can't belive this had so many postive reviews-that's why I made it in the first place. If you're still determined to try it maybe make half the batch with cinnamon and half without and see what it does.

LOVE this- so good.  I added some Garam Masala when I made it (over a year ago).  I really need to make it again.  The whole fam loved it too, even my young children.  I decreased the cayenne to just a sprinkle.  We had it with rice, fresh grilled naan bread, and asparagus.

This recipe has so much potential but its ruined by the ridiculous amount of salt. it was really spicy too, anyways, advice... half the cumin in the sauce, omit all the salt in the sauce and beware of the jalapeno. if you are not a fan of really spicy food, i don't recommend putting the jalapeno, also use double the amount of garlic for a more pronounced flavor.. a good basic recipe but needs changes..

I only gave this 4 stars because of the amount of salt in the recipe. I only ended up adding 2 tsp (one in the marinade and one in the sauce) and it was more than enough.  I hope that the member who originally posted the recipe made an error, and that it's not the actual amount of salt they would put in this type of dish!  The dish itself (after the salt modification) was excellent, both hubby and I enjoyed it and will make it again.

i made this recipe without the salt, per other reviews, and added garam masala, which seems an indispensable ingredient in making chicken tikka masala.  the chicken was tender but the flavor of this dish is completely off. i lived in England for a year and ate Indian curry all the time and have had a lot of Indian food in Artesia, Ca (which is known as Little India) and never did the tikka masala taste like this.  if you're looking for a good authentic recipe, this is not it.  this ended up tasting more like a tomato-cream curry.  i really wanted to like this recipe but i am disappointed.

This was good. Not nearly as wonderful as what I've had at Indian restaurants, but a very tasty make at home version. As per other reviewers' suggestions, I only used about 1/4 tsp salt for the entire recipe and that was plenty. I broiled the chicken, but next time will probably just bake it. The fresh chopped cilantro on top really added to the dish and I wouldn't make it without. Over all, very good!

Great recipe, but everyone's comments re: salt are correct.  My advice - halve it for the marinade, and omit it entirely for the sauce.  That said, I've played with it a number of times and it never fails to impress.

YUM!  My family is very picky but loved this.  I used fat free yogurt, and fat free half and half instead of the cream.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I used curry powder in place of the cumin, cinnamon, and cayenne, but still added the black pepper.  I used no salt because curry powder contains salt.

EXCELLENT DISH! I reduced the cumin (in both the marinade and the sauce) to 1 tsp and the cayene to 1 tsp. Also, I only used 2 tsp of salt in the marinade and none in the sauce, which was perfect. Finally, I used green bell peppers instead of jalapenos. Served over rice and a side of pita bread...wonderful! My roommate, who is sensative to spicy foods for medical reasons, LOVED it but could only eat one bowl (understandably). However, it was perfect for me...with the changes made, it was the right amt of heat. This is my first attempt at making Indian food and I am so pleased with the result! Thanks Yakuta!

I fixed this recipe last night. My first attempt at Chicken Tikka Masala. I had read some of the reviews and changed the original recipe, making it with less cayenne pepper and I added no salt. It was absolutely delicious. My dinner guest, who loves Indian food, could not stop raving about it. So, I will definitely make it again.

This was very good!  I used Greek yogurt, and made two versions. One vegetarian with Tofu and one with Chicken. Also, we added mushrooms to the skewers.  In place of heavy cream I used skim milk and little bit of fat free cream cheese to thicken up the sauce.

I loved this recipe.  My first time making Indian food and it was great with Naan bread. I doubled the sauce and used almost no salt per others suggestions. I even used 2% milk instad of cream and just added about a tsp. of flour to the butter to make sure the sauce was thick enough. Used 1 tsp of cayenne in the marinade and no jalapenos because kids where eating it.  Even they loved it. Thanks for the great dinner!!

Didn't include the final 3 tsp of salt and it was delicious. Creamy and potently spicy. Baked the chicken at 350F for 25 minutes instead of grilling. Marinated the chicken overnight.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and my husband was literally speechless throughout dinner--aside from the yummy noises and moans of appreciation. This beat any dish we've had in a restaraunt hands down, and it was so incredibly easy. I also made the Naan by Mic (excellent) and some basmati rice with peas, and it was just . . . so . . . good. Thanks for a perfect recipe!

I make this five or six times a year, grilling the chicken in the summer and broiling in the winter.  It is a must have when I am craving Indian food but I need to stay at home.  PLEASE do not ruin the dish by using the amount of salt listed.  It will not be edible.  It is fabulous with a little aromatic rice and a side of spiced lentils.

I made this tonight and REALLY improvised and decreased the time by hours!!!! I am all for quick and easy but yummy. Believe it or not, I skipped the entire Marinade and it still tasted just like ALL Indian Restaurants I have been to. Instead of marinating the chicken I braised the chicken breasts in a skillet till the outside was crisp but still tender and juicy. I seasoned them with Paprika, garlic salt, and ginger and added a little butter in the skillet. Honestly, I think the sauce is so rich that you could probably add plain chicken to this dish and you would never know the difference except for maybe texture.

I made the sauce almost exactly as listed but instead of cilantro I used Garam Masala which I found at Wegmans but can be found at any Asian grocery store. I eliminated the salt entirely. I also did not have a jalepeno so I used about a teaspoon of red chili peppers.  

THE DISH WAS AWESOME and so good I think my husband thought I bought it.  It took me all of an hour and a half to make. I would love to know what others think of my improvisation.

This is such a great recipe!  The only thing I changed was that I put only 1 tsp of salt in the marinade and 1 tsp in the sauce.  I used my indoor grill and the chicken turned out great.  Excellent recipe that tastes as good as my favorite restaurant's!

Good, but I'll keep salt on the low side, just adding 1/2 teaspoon for the marinade, and adding some to taste when making the sauce - if needed. Couldn't get garam masala, but I'd recommend throwing a couple of cardamom seeds when frying the garlic cloves and taking them away after 5 - 7 secs. It would perfume the sauce and give it a special taste. I also didn't include the jalapeño pepper since that would give more of a mexican touch to the recipe, which is really far away from what you want it to be. Definitely add 1/2 chopped onion to the sauce. Thanks for posting!

This recipe has so much potential- but the amount of salt just RUINS the entire thing and is impossible to fix.  I even tried doubling the sauce recipe (with no salt in the second batch) during our meal, and we all dumped our old chicken back into it and it was STILL TOO SALTY. I will make it again, but I will not follow directions this time.

O-M-G-ravy!!! This is some good stuff! Other than cutting the salt (1 t in marinade & 1 t in sauce) and using dried cilatnro (about 1 T) in sauce rather than fresh at the end, I followed recipe exactly. No, not true, I pan fried my chicken, because rain prevented me from grilling. This was de-lish-ous!!!! Loved the kick from the jalapeno & cayenne! Exactly what I was hoping for. This is a KEEPER! Thanks, Yakuta!!

Lower the salt and it will make a huge difference and a better one. I doubled the sauce for the rice and followed the advice from someone on here on how to grill if you don't have one. Which I set the oven on broil. I took out my top rack of oven cleaned it, oiled, and put the skewered chicken on. I also put a couple large rectangular pans (didn't have cookies sheet) and lined with foil to catch the juice and sauce on the second rack. Five minutes per side and they come out beautifully. Thank again to who gave the advice on how to grill. My boyfriend and I loved this meal! We have made it a few times already. He is in love with the sauce.

This was amazing!!  I am a first time Indian food maker, although I've read about it for YEARS.  I have to say, I loved it!  I made way too much sauce, but I'll just make more rice to mop it up with!  I didn't have enough cumin to finish up the sauce, so i added one teaspoon of curry powder.  I loved it!!!  I will totally make this again!!

I give this a four not because it isnt deserving of a five but because I had such high expectations and it didnt quite meet them. Certainly not authentic but it was tasty nonetheless. I would give it a go if youre interested in this recipe.

Like other reviewers, I decreased the salt A LOT, and found that it was plenty salty.  4 tsp of salt is way too much - that's 1/4 cup!!  I used 1 tsp salt in the marinade and 1/2 tsp in the sauce, and that was perfect for us.  I also used 1 1/2 tsp garam masala instead of the cinnamon in the marinade and then added 3 tsp of garam masala to the sauce recipe.  With these changes I would give it 5 stars.  It's the closest I've found to restaurant quality!  We used shrimp instead of chicken and it was delicious.  You could use sea scallops or paneer too.  Serve with basmati rice, plain yogurt or raita, and naan.  YUM!

Chicken tikka masala is supposed to be light, creamy, and zesty. This stuff was thick, heavy, salty (even though I drastically cut down the salt), and way over spiced. I should have known something was wrong when it called for tomato sauce instead of actual tomatoes. Big disappointment.

This was delicious!  I used fat free vanilla yogurt and fat free half-and-half (instead of cream) but I swear it's not missing a thing. It was served on Coriander and Herbs Naan.  I doubled the cream sauce and plan on making rice to go with the leftovers.  I also used 5 small chicken breasts and sautéed them, then drained the marinade off. Don't worry about the strong cinnamon smell, it blends in beautifully.

This recipe was a HUGE hit in my home!  I get requests for it on a daily basis!
I served it with the Jeera (cumin) rice recipe on this site and it was absolutely perfect!  So much fun to prepare also!

Very good food!! It actually wasn't as hot as I thought/hoped it would be. Next time I will let the tomato sauce simmer for a lot longer before adding the cream to it. It was very very good the way it was; I just like things hot and spicy most of the time! 7 teaspoons of salt was a little scary to me and my heart, so I only used 1 tsp (1/2 in each the sauce and marinade). My husband loved this too. I will definitely make this again and again and again. Thanks for posting.

This is a great basic recipe for chicken tikka masala.  My one suggestion for the sauce would be to buy some garam masala, the Indian spice mixture used in many Indian dishes, and add 2-3 teaspoons of it to the sauce.  This made it absolutely delectable!

My advice is to use salt only to taste.  I think I will use two jalepenos & 2 cups of cream next time.  I am used to a slightly spicier and creamier dish.  However, it was very good!

Here's the situation with this great recipe: it's almost perfect.  The amount of salt suggested seemes a bit much, though.  I added half the amount to both the yogurt marinade and masala sauce, and still it was too salty.  Maybe I was using industrial strength mutated super-salt, which could alter the taste slightly.  My suggestion: when making this dish, add salt to taste, not to full measure.

Recently had chicken tikka masala at an Indian restaurant & I loved it so I decided I would try it at home. I made only slight changes, started my marinate at lunch time. I also used the amount of salt that seemed appropriate it, also added some curry powder and used less cayenne but after making it I think I would add more spice. Great either way

My kids went crazy for this... I replaced the cayenne pepper with chili powder (was out of cayenne)I don't think I will do it with the cayenne my little one is not real crazy about "hot" (I cut the salt down to about one tsp rather than the high amount the recipe called for)I served this over couscous that I made with chicken broth. My son just about made himself sick because he could not stop eating this! It was amazing! Our kitchen was full of all sorts of conflicting smells and the kids were a little dubious but the comments were about how smoothly all the flavors blended, and a resounding "you have got to make this again"!

A little salty, so I will probably cut the measurement in half next time.  Otherwise, it was a big hit.

My husband and I tried this dish on our recent honeymoon, and we couldn't wait to try making it ourselves at home.  This recipe was delicious.  I used about 1 teaspoon of salt in the marinade and maybe a quarter teaspoon in the sauce because other reviewers said it was too salty as written.  I used chicken tenderloins becasue they are quicker to cut into bite-size pieces of uniform size.  We do not have a grill, so I baked the skewered chicken at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes or so.  I put it on a cooling rack that I placed on top of a baking sheet so that it didn't get soggy.  I did not put the chicken in the sauce at the end because I was worried it would soak up too much of the sauce and I couldn't wait anymore to try it!  I served it over basmati rice and with naan that I purchased at the store and heated in the oven.  My husband said it was the best thing I have ever made :)  Thanks for a great recipe!  EDIT: I also used about 2 tbsp of garam masala in place of the cumin, cinnamon and cayenne in the marinade per other reviewers' suggestions.  I used the cumin and paprika in the sauce still.

I fell in love with Tikka Masala living in Spain, and this recipe is amazing (especially since I know exactly what's going in it - something that always bothers me going out to eat)!  I read plenty of reviews before making the dish, and significantly cut back on the salt... I use only about a half a teaspoon or so in the marinate and then add a tiny bit to the sauce, being sure to taste before considering adding more.  Being health-conscious, I never use as much butter as the recipe calls for and always use low-fat coconut milk instead of cream.  The results are always amazing.  Recently, after FINALLY tracking down Garam Masala at (gasp) Jewel of all places, I've used that in addition to the other spices in the marinate and the sauce.  I am extremely generous with all the spices, and have never managed to "ruin" or overpower the dish.  I highly recommend this recipe!!  And if you are feeling fancy (and have a lot of time) this site's garlic naan compliments the Tikka soooo well.  Yum-me!

I put this together quickly without realizing it had to be grilled. Instead, I stir fried the chicken in butter with its marinade and then added the sauce. It came out absolutely to die for (after omitting most of the salt)!

Delicious!  I took LisaDee's advice: substituted 5 tsp of garam masala in place of cumin/cinnamon/cayenne in the marinade.  Marinaded overnight for a day.
And for the sauce I added 1/2 chopped onion and 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp paprika, 2 tsp garam masala, no salt. I didn't use Jalepeno and added dried chiles de arbol instead so it wasn't too spicy. 
The sauce was great (my friends loved it) and fairly thick (esp with the added onion). Next time (and there will be a next time), I will double the sauce for the given amount of chicken.  
PS. my house and clothes smelled like indian food for awhile after....

YUM!! this recipe is absolutely to die for! i did what a lot of other reviewers said to do and doubled to sauce, this was plenty to coat the rice and dip my naan bread into. i also marinated the chicken over night and i think it added to the delicious flavor! we don't have a grill, so i did what another reviewer had suggested and made my own makeshift grill: covered a cookie sheet with foil, put the skewered chicken on a cookie rack on top of this and broiled it for 10 minutes, turning the skewers once - turned out beautiful and delicious! i would totally recommend this to anyone who loves chicken tikka marsala, as it tastes just as good (if not better) than anything you can find in a restaurant! :)

I make this at least twice a month lol. My bf and I Liberace this. Better than the Indian restaurant he says. If I'm feeling vegetarian,I'll use eggplant instead of chicken. Excellent vegetarian dish as well!

Based on reviews, I halved the salt and this was absolutely incredible!  I had 12 guests over the other night and made 18 servings hoping for some left overs.  It was so good that when the chicken was gone people were scraping their dishes with naan to get up every last bit of the sauce!  I used greek yogurt to get a thicker and creamier sauce and I think the results were worth it.  Next time, I'm going to coat the chicken then put it on skewers before returning it to the marinade and placing it in the fridge.  Putting the chicken on skewers after sitting in the marinade in the fridge overnight was making my fingers go numb.  The recipe isn't very specific but make sure your chicken breasts are about 1/2 lb each.  So, for the standard 4 servings I would try to get a 1 1/2 lbs package.  I love spicy foods and this was very spicy.  If you don't like a lot of heat, make sure you halve the cayenne and jalapeno.

Also, instead of breasts, I think this would be even BETTER with thighs.  It's cheaper but more flavorful.  

AND - if you don't have a grill or it's too cold out, you can cook the chicken in a broiler.  Preheat the broiler and position a rack about 8 inches from the heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade; scrape off as much of the marinade as possible. Season the chicken with salt and pepper and spread the pieces on a baking sheet. Broil the chicken, turning once or twice, until just cooked through and browned in spots, about 12 minutes

I was in a hurry when I made this (my husband notified me his friend from out of town was coming over in less than an hour), so I didn't take time to read all the reviews.  This stuff was great, but WAY TOO MUCH SALT!!!  I felt strange putting so much salt in to begin with, but I normally follow a recipe to the T the first time I try it out.  I'll make this again - without ANY salt - then add a little and taste to adjust.

It might have been foolhardy to serve a six-course Indian feast to guests when I had zero experience with Indian cuisine, but the experience was well worth it when this Chicken Tikka Masala was presented.  This dish is absolutely scrumptious, and if you're craving Indian food, this will definitely hit the spot!  I followed a lot of the other reviewers' suggestions when preparing this dish:  I used about 1 to 1.5 tsp of salt between the marinade and the sauce, rather than the 7 tsp called for in the recipe; as I had sensitive guests, I "cut down" the heat and only used half of a jalapeno, but if I were cooking for only myself and my partner, I'd use a whole one; I used garam masala and black pepper in the marinade, rather than the cumin/cinnamon/cayenne combo; I broiled the chicken rather than grilling it; I sensed that I'd want more sauce than the recipe quantities would provide, so I increased the quantity of all of the ingredients (except the jalapeno), and used half-and-half for any additional dairy beyond the 1c of cream.    One thing I did that I haven't read of others trying is bypassing purchasing a large container of plain yogurt to simply get the 1c needed for the recipe- I instead picked up a 6oz single-serving cup of honey-flavored, high-quality Greek yogurt; I supplemented the 'missing' 2oz with sour cream.  My impression that this would freeze particularly well, and would be very good reheated for, say, an office lunch.   I can't wait to make this again!

I am constantly asked when I'll be making this tikka masala again, so that friends can wrangle an invitation to dinner! Love this recipe! So easy to adjust the "burn" level for friends or newbies to Indian food. We generally double the chicken and triple the sauce, and serve over basmati rice. *Drool!*

Amazing! I was sooo very skeptical about making this myself because I didn't think the result would taste anywhere near as great as when I order this dish in restaurants. Boy was I wrong! I also made adjustments to the recipe, simply because a) that much salt is a death sentence (a pinch will do the trick for the marinade and for the sauce); b) my family likes things more on the mild side. I used half a jalepino and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper instead. If you're worried about fat intake, use milk instead of heavy cream (just add a little flour to the butter once the onions are sauteed and the sauce will thicken beautifully).  I made vegetable korma and rice to go with it and it was perfect! Will make this recipe again and again. :)

I loved it! I cut back on the salt as per raters suggestions. I also froze some for later and it tasted just as good the next time.

Yum! I made this and served it over jasmine rice. So good! I reduced the amount of salt to about 2 teaspoons (1 for the marinade and 1 for the sauce), and it worked out great. Also, I cooked the chicken on skewers in the oven (400 degrees for about 15 minutes). I had never had chicken tikka masala before, but my boyfriend said it tasted just like the restaurant version. Thanks for a great recipe!

Even with the OBVIOUS ERROR OF SALT  CALLED FOR I'm still giving this 5 stars. I tried Tikka Masala for the first time last week and liked it so much I wanted to try to make it myself.  And while it didn't taste exactly like what I had it was pretty close. I really really liked it.  It was just the right amount of spicy and creamy.  Now for the tweaks, obviously didn't follow the amounts for salt (I don't know if that is someone's idea of a joke or what).  I tossed a few pinches of salt into the marinade and sauce and that's it.  I also cut the cayenne down to 1 tsp as I was afraid 2 might be a bit much.  I'm glad I did.  I like spicy food and it was a bit spicy, but the heat was in the back so you could actually taste the other ingredients.  2 tsps would have overpowered it for me.  Served with Asian Coconut Rice and Chapati (both recipes on this site) and roasted sweet potatoes (peel, chunk, toss in olive oil, salt, pepper, roast 45 at 400).  I will defnitely make this meal again.

This recipe as written is inedible due to the salt content.  I suggest reading the other reviews for correct salt quantities.

Oh yum! Thank you for a wonderful recipe! I reduced the salt significantly to 1/4 tsp for the marinade and 1/3 tsp for the sauce. I broiled the chicken (turning once) since I live in a condo, and I don't have a grill. The second time I made it, I added some frozen peas and carrots to the sauce (before adding the cream). Also, I used low-fat yogurt for the marinade, and 3/4C fat free half and half + 1/4 skim milk for the sauce (it didn't separate and I didn't notice much difference, if any, in taste). Additionally, I added some Garam Masala to the marinade. Now, about the Cayenne, even if you *THINK* you can handle heat really well, please consider reducing the amount at least a little (to perhaps 1 1/2 tsp) and work up from there (maybe take it easy w/ the hot pepper too). This turns out VERY hot and that may make it inedible for a lot of people. Next time I make it I think  I'll leave out the frozen peas and carrots :) but it was a fun experiment. It was good, but it's better sans the additional veggies, IMO. I served this with Basmati rice and homemade naan (recipe from this site).

This was spicy, with just 1 tsp of cayenne!  I have had Chicken Tikka Masala in Indian Resturaunts and it is NOT as spicy as this one is.  We could barely eat it.  Probably won't bother to make it again.  I'll go out for my Indian food.

just like my favorite Indian restaurant!  i didnt have cayenne, so i used 1 tsp of chili powder.  also, i took the advice of others and only put in 1 tsp of salt in the marinade and 3/4 tsp in the sauce. i upped the cilantro to 1/2 c because i LOVE cilantro. i paired it with this site's garlic cilantro potatoes recipe and their roti one (which was more like a naan recipe because it lacked the flaky layers). it was a knockout with my guests--even the ones that dont normally like Indian food!

WOW, this was soooo good.  We did make some changes though.  First, we only used 2t salt in the whole recipe (one in sauce and one in marinade).  Second, we added 2t garam masala in the tomato/cream sauce.  Third, we used 1/2 coconut milk for the cream.  I think next time we will use all coconut milk instead of the cream.  We also doubled the recipe for the tomato cream sauce to dip naan and for our rice.  Thank you so much for this recipe, it will definately be added to our family favorites!!!!

This recipe wouldn’t get four stars on its own merits.  It might not even get three.  However, it’s structural helpfulness was a great guide to making a fantastic (meatless) tikka masala.  I made a lot of substitutions and additions, most importantly subbing Quorn cutlets in for chicken.  I followed the marinade recipe as-is (except I scaled the salt content WAY back, because 4 teaspoons?? Seriously?), then added shallots, fresh ginger, more garlic, and a lot of spices (more cumin, tumeric, coriander, garam masala) to the cream sauce.  I omitted the jalapeno because the flavor is incorrect for Indian cooking, but kept the heat with cayenne.  Also, I used fire roasted crushed tomatoes instead of canned sauce and added finely shredded baby spinach at the very end (cooked until just wilted, then served over steaming basmati rice!)  So remember to taste as you go, and if you love real Indian food, you’re going to need to add a lot more flavor to this.

Great recipe.  I used tofu instead of chicken and didn't discard all of the marinade (since it probably didn't soak as well into the tofu as it would have for chicken).  There was definitely too much salt - even when I made the marinade with just 2 tsp. and the sauce with just 2 tsp.

Well, this was pretty easy, but probably more difficult for the novice than for great, experienced chefs!  That said, I really liked this.  Again, it was way to salty, and I would stress the importance of seasoning to taste, and tasting as you go.  For many, using cumin and paprika and cayanne (or chili, not sure if the same but all I could find) together will produce a taste that is intense.  For a first time creator of Indian cuisine, I added and tasted as I went to be sure that what was being created was what I like.  One thing I did different, partially because I wanted a lot of sauce, and partially because the sauce was too salty was this: I made the marinade and used it as a simmer sauce for the chicken, because I didnt want to wait an hour.  Once the chicken was cooked, I added all of the marinade (which thinned out considerably) to the sauce, and continued to simmer on low for a while longer.  The flavors in the marinade were great, and I didnt want to discard them, plus it lightened up the sauce.  I loved it.  I had spent a fortune on Indian delivery recently, and this was comparable. My boyfriend could not tell the difference between mine and the the local restaurant.  Also, I used 26.5 oz of sauce and 2 6oz servings of ff plain yogurt.  And I used 1 c of half & half.  Sorry for the long review, just very thrilled with this recipe.

This was a good recipe to build upon.  You should reduce the salt and cayenne (if you don't like it too spicey!) by more than half.  I didn't have all the spices or jalapeno pepper so I bought a small bag of Garam Masala and used 1 tsp in the marinade and 2 tsp in the sauce.  To the marinade, add 1 clove of minced garlic.  To the sauce double all the ingredients and add a can of coconut milk, 1 tbs of sugar, sauteed chopped onion and 2 tbs of sauteed minced ginger.  I used half and half instead of heavy cream, trying to be a little health conscious.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a can of whole peeled tomatoes.  The final dish was served over a plate of hot Jasmine rice.  My Aunt said it tasted better than what's served in the restaurants and asked for the recipe.

I got married in June to an Indian man and have been trying to expand my Indian recipes list.  He absolutely loves this dish.  I do use WAY less salt than what's listed, and I cut the cayenne in half (even my husband thought it was on the hot side).  Even my in-laws enjoyed this!

This was really really good.  My wife said it was better than the local Indian restaurant which is supposed to have the best Tikka Masala in the city.  I did find that it was too hot for my liking so I will probably decrease the amount of cayenne pepper and jalapenos next time (call me a wimp).

This recipe was absolutely wonderful!!!  It tasted JUST LIKE my favorite restaurant's recipe.  I used less salt in each the chicken and sauce as suggested by other reviewers (about a teaspoon).  This is one of the best recipes I've tried in a very long time!  I will DEFINITELY make this again!

Best recipe for this I have found so far.  I used half the salt and really should have used only 1/4.  I also used hot paprika so this dish was extra spicy too.  Yum!

If you love spices and seasonings, you'll love this dish!  Make sure you pick up a pack of naan bread with this dish. If you can't find naan bread, supplement it with some type of pita or flat bread.

I agree regarding the salt - use it to taste. Otherwise, we were all really surprised with how great tasting and easy this recipe is. I used my G. Foreman grill and they browned up perfectly. We also made a big batch of wings only using the marinade. Excellent.

I followed the recipe precisely, and I agree: way too salty!  I would try it again, using 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of salt each in the marinade and the sauce.

We made adjustments per reviewers suggestions and it turned out phenomenal!!!
CHANGES: Marinade: 1 tsp. garam masala instead of cinnamon, and only 1 tsp salt. I didn't use ginger.  Sauce: 3 cloves garlic and 2 jalapenos. Double sauce so enough for rice: 2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp paprika, and 3 tsp garam masala,  only 1/2 tsp salt, 15oz can of tomato sauce and about 1 3/4 cups heavy cream.
Baked chicken at 475 degrees for 15-20 minutes.
I tried this again, but used 1c heavy cream and 3/4c half and half and tasted just as good.
I didn't use cilantro.

Good stuff! As some other reviewers recommended, I dropped the salt from the marinade, and just added it to taste as the sauce was thickening in the final stages. A lot of the ingredients are not available in my area, so I left out the jalapeño (but threw in some habañero hot sauce), and substituted regular chili powder for the cayenne. Still came out great. My girlfriend really liked it too but she was mad at me so she wouldn't say so until the next day.

This is a good recipe (minus the salt) for people who do not have access to garam masala or curry leaves. If your spice cabinet is well equipped, you should make some changes. You can replace all the cinnamon, all the black pepper, and half the cumin for a similar amount of garam masala. Conversely you can just add a bit of ground coriander seed, clove and cardamom (garam masala being mostly a combination of all the aforementioned spices). Put curry leaves in the sauce while it cooks. Even if you don't have access to these ingredienta, there's still one important change worth making: add a bit of minced onion and minced ginger to the sauté (and get rid of the ginger in the marinade).

I imagine that I would really have liked it if I had not put the amount of salt suggested.......it was so salty that my fiance would not eat it, even diluted with rice and extra yogurt it was almost inedible, and the recipe called for 7 tsp altogether and I only put about 4 or five, so I do not know why it tells you to put so much......

Awesome and very easy recipe! I saw it this morning, stopped at the store after work to get the ingredients, got home and got the chicken marinating (just an hour) and it was great! i used plain Greek yogurt. I always read the reviews of recipes before I try them and I only added three teaspoons of salt total! I didn't add the jalapeno only because the cayenne was enough heat. I grilled the chicken using wood skewers in a grilling pan on my stove top using a little olive oil and it grilled perfectly. I did double the recipe (because my husband is a BIG eater) but I only cooked half the chicken. I will let the rest of the chicken continue to marinate for 24hrs and then it will be round two! My husband loved it and I must say it was just as good as the Taste of India Restaurant here in town! Now I can enjoy this simple dish anytime!

Restauant quality taste. At the suggestion of others, I reduced salt in the marinade and the sauce to 1 tsp each, and added garam masala to both.

Absolutely delicious!  Made a few minor adjustments - less salt, only 1 tsp. cayenne pepper (it was great, and I like it hot), only 1 tsp. black pepper.  Also, I love sauce so I doubled the sauce ingredients - 8 oz tomato sauce, 8 oz canned diced tomatoes in sauce, and 2 cups fat free halfnhalf instead of heavy cream to lighten it up!  Highly recommend it - will definitely become a regular at our house.

This recipe has received nearly 1500 reviews, averaging out to 4.5 stars, and is on it's way to 2000.  They got something right.  First time I made this, half the chicken never made it to the sauce.  It came off the grill, and upon sampling was devoured.  At the grill.  This recipe is great.  The sauce has wonderful flavor.  I have Garam Masala, but opted to stick with the recipe.  Sure you can cut up some chicken and put it directly in the sauce, but the effort made to grill is a payoff your mouth will thank you for.

Reviews suggesting this recipe is "unusable as it is" are a bit heavy handed, and should be taken with a "grain of salt", because that seems to be the main problem.  Any good cook knows their taste, and adds salt accordingly.  

Note: Cayenne can be used in the sauce if you just want the "heat".  I love Jalapeno, and sauteed in butter...? Nom!  Adds great flavor to the dish.

WAY too much salt.  And even when reducing the salt to an edible amount, the spices still don't taste quite like Tikka Masala.  I was better off using Tikka paste from a jar.

This was sooooo delish! My husband and I LOVED it! We were surprised there was enough leftovers for us to have for lunch the next day, butI'm not complaining! I listened to the reviews and minimized the salt to 1 tsp for the sauce and 1 tsp for the chicken. I also omitted the cumin in the sauce and added 1 tsp of garam masala instead. I used a 15oz can of tomato sauce for more sauce. I also added some chopped onion for preference with the 2 jalapenos that I used. 

I didnt have skewers so I just poured the yogurt and chicken onto a brolier pan and lined the bottom with aluminum foil and baked it at 475 for about 10 minutes. It was perfect.

Served with coconut & golden raisin basmati rice....let me reiterate: DEEEEEEEEELISSH! Next time we'll have naan instead. (:

Not good. I used only 1/4 of the salt and it still was too salty. I believe in giving ratings based on the recipe listed. If I had used all the salt, this would have been just awful. Sorry!!!!

*Completely* my fault for not reading the other reviews.  I will never make that mistake again.  WAY TOO MUCH SALT!  I feel like I ate a salt lick.  Or I licked the rim of a margarita glass over and over.  Or I opened a container of Morton Salt and poured it straight in my mouth.  Etc.  It can't be fixed either.  We tried tablespoons of honey, more tomato sauce - even straight sugar.  The salt won.

This recipe overall was really good. It was so close to the restaurant version that it's a definite keeper for me. The only thing that I believe it needs work on is maybe trying to make it richer in flavor. Perhaps more cream will do the trick. I was also considering using homemade tomato puree instead of the tomato sauce... Either way, I'm a happy camper.

I should have read the other reviews before making this, it is WAY too salty.  The flavor was good even just after being grilled (without the sauce) and great with the sauce too, and I found the level of spice (one jalapeno) to be perfect.  Next time I make this, I will definitely cut the salt down though.

This was beyond fabulous!  My entire family loved it.  It was easy to make and so tasty.  I was very excited to learn that I could make one of my favorite Indian dishes at home and it tastes just like it was made at an Indian restaurant.  My husband agreed, which really made me happy because he can be critical when it comes to duplicating restaurant style recipes.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  You're my hero!

I doubled the sauce and because I wanted to try and lighten this up a little, I used one cup fat free plain yogurt and 1 cup fat free half & half instead of heavy cream. Turned out well.  Served it over brown basmati rice and with roasted cauliflower.

SO GOOD! Tastes just like an indian restaurant. I made a few alterations based on suggestions and my own ideas. I halfed the cayenne pepper and it was still super spicy. I cooked the chicken in the oven because I don't have a grilled and I left in in all the sauce and added a potato and onions, which really added to the flavor variations. I baked the chicken on 450, 12 minutes on each side, 24 total. I used half oil/half butter for the sauce, and added a teaspoon of hot curry spice (i like it spicy). i doubled the tomato sauce, but left the cream the same, and added a small can of peas. It came out AMAZING, thanks!

This came out pretty good with my modifications.  I baked the chicken instead of grilling, 20 minutes at 400 degrees on a foil-lined pan without skewers.

I doubled the sauce and used a can of lite coconut milk instead of cream to save calories and used olive oil instead of butter.  I omitted all salt except one teaspoon in the sauce.  I also added a couple teaspoons of tumeric and half a chopped onion to the sauce.

This was amazing!  At first, I thought the sauce was really bland and added some turmeric and garam masala to spice it up.  I should have waited to taste it after adding the chicken!  This turned out better than I've had at restaurants.  I love being able to make a dish at home that tastes better than what I can order out!

Oh my! This was wonderful! I omitted the salt completely, doubled the sauce. I didn't cook on the grill, I pan seared the chicken after marinating, poured off the little bit of liquid it made, then poured the sauce in with chicken and simmered for 20 minutes. I followed the recipe otherwise. It was nice and spicy, not too hot if you are used to hot spicy food. Served with home made naan.

OMG SO SALTY!  Do NOT salt the sauce - the marinade was perfect but I used about one and a half tsp, which is half of what the recipe calls for.  After spending a ton of time trying to fix the salt level by adding more cream, adding yogurt, and adding water - it was still WAY too salty.  Without the salt this has the potential to be really good though, so 4 stars.

As others have noted, the as is recipe is too salty.  I started out with half of what the recipe dictated, but upon taste test I felt it could use more.  Bad choice!  That saltiness sneaks up on you after you take a bite or two of the finished meal (and I am okay with salty so if it's too much for me, it's far too much).  I'm new to Middle Eastern cooking, so I can't place it, but this dish is missing something. As such, I gave it only 4 stars.  It was good, but I think I will probably keep trying other recipes for that "wow factor."

Very authentic tasting.  I found it more time consuming than I thought it would be but I will be making it again - I did add a tablespoon of garam marsala to the marinade.  I followed someones suggestion and doubled the sauce and for us that wasn't necessary.  The recipe as written would have
 been fine. Thanks submitter.

This is a favorite of my family and is a staple in my menu rotation. My changes: only 1 tsp of salt in the marinade. 4 tsp is WAY too salty! I double the sauce, but only use 1 tsp (total) salt. I use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream. I serve with basmati rice and naan. We don't go to our local Indian restaurant very much because we would always order chicken tikka masala when we went. Why pay restaurant prices when I can make it as good as at home!

Really great recipe. I have done this a few times. The only thing is that I do not marinate it. I sautee the onions and garlic together in a heavy saucepan and then add all the liquids and spices together into a sauce. I let it boil and add the chicken until it is cooked. It gives a nice flavour to the chicken. I add cornstarch to thicken the sauce if it doesn't do it on its own. Pour over rice and voila!

I have never had this dish before but I maranated the chicken over night and made the sauce the next day. I used one jalapeno and only used one teaspoon of salt in marinate and sauce.  I also doubled the red sauce as per some of the reviews. I found it needed more salt, I also added some brown sugar and found I had WAY to much sauce. Next time I will use exact about for sauce and use 1/2 a jalapeno since it was a bit hot. But I have to say very yummy none the less

This recipe turned out really good! The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it calls for way too much salt. I used about 1/4 of the amount and it was perfect! I also substituted a few things so it was non-dairy (1 cup soy ice cream for yogurt, and 1 cup soy creamer for heavy cream). I will be making this again! It has so much flavor and tastes almost exactly like the Chicken Tikka Masala from restaurants I've been too!

Good recipe except for the 7 teaspoons of salt which must be a typo because no one in their right mind would use that much salt.  I used 1 teaspoon in total, and it was fine.

Very good recipe. I did alter it based on what I had on hand.  I marinated my chicken breasts overnight as I think that really helps to bring the flavors forward. So don't skip that step.  I used lite coconut milk in place of the heavy cream and I did not use a jalapeno pepper since I was making this for children as well.  I did add cayenne pepper individually to the adult dishes.  I also skipped ALL the spices and just used garam masala.  I made some basmati rice and used a little of garam masal & chicken broth to cook that.  I used a 28 oz can of tomato sauce and 14 oz can of the coconut milk.  I also toasted some sliced almonds and ground them up and added them to the sauce and used them for garnish as well.  This was delicious. I will definately be making this again.  P.S. Use greek yogurt. It's thicker and more suitable for this recipe !  And don't forget to marinate OverNight ! Thanks.

This was delicious.  I omitted the salt and doubled the sauce.  I wish I halved the cream though, it was really rich.  I added peas and mushrooms because that is how my favorite restaurant serves it.  Yum.  I will make this again with a few more tweaks

This was a really easy dish to make, and it is very tasty.  I didn't have ginger, so I just omitted it.  I also followed other reviewers' suggestions to double the sauce, leave out all the salt, and halve the amount of cayenne.  It was flavorful enough yet not too spicy for my 5-year-old.  My husband and I simply sprinkled more cayenne on our servings to make it spicy enough for us.  I also sauteed in olive oil not butter, and I replaced each cup of heavy cream with 3/4 C milk and 1/3 cup non-hydrogenated margarine spread.  I served it with quinoa and pita bread.  Delicious!

Very good!  We don't have a grill so we used a method suggested by another reviewer and baked the chicken on a rimmed sheet in the oven.  It came out excellent.  Very juicy and flavorful!  I think I will try this recipe again with coconut milk instead of heavy cream as some have suggested.  Either way, we'll make this again.  It was worth the time involved.

This recipe was so AMAZING...YUM!  My boyfriend said it tasted even BETTER than it did at the Indian Restaurant!  I only used 1 tsp of salt in the marinate and in the sauce (2 tsp total) and the flavor was perfect.  I also added Garam Masala and curry.  I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream.  Next time I'm going to try whole milk and then just add 1/4 of the 1/2 & 1/2 to save on fat.  I baked the chicken in the oven for 25 minutes at 375; it was so tender!  (I marinated the chicken for 1 1/2 days.) This recipe was easy and so incredibly tasty.  This will be a new favorite in our house.  Thank you for the recipe and for all the reviews and suggestions.  If you are making this recipe for the first time DO NOT use the amount of salt in the recipe.

I actually got this recipe from a friend a few months ago and it became an instant top 5 favs for my husband and I!!! I LOVE Indian food though and this tastes to similar to my favorite Indian restaurant. The only thing I've changed (based on my friend's suggestion) is to only use 1 tsp of salt in the marinade and sauce. I think I'm adding this to my menu this week!

Followed the directions exactly and this dish turned out to be as good as the local Indian restaurants!. I suggest supplementing with Naan bread "you can find it at Walmart super centers and a lot of other grocery stores now" as well as basmati rice!

Tasty. Like other reviewers, I reduced the salt. I did find that it was pretty cinnamony (overpowered even the cumin), so I wish I had reduced or replaced that with garam masala. Still very good!

Really fantastic, although I agree with everyone who says that 1 or possibly 2 tsp of salt in the whole thing is PLENTY.   I also cut the cayenne in half because I didn't want it terribly spicey, and it still had plenty of heat - I'll probably cut it a bit more the next time I make it.   I didn't want to mess with the grill, so I took a review's advice and cooked it in the oven at 475 while I let the sauce reduce.   Really great flavor, surprisingly simple to make! I suspect you could skip the hour marinating time and just coat the meat in the yogurt mixture because it's so thick.   This is my first attempt at Indian and it came out wonderfully!

What a nice change of pace.  I loved this recipe and you can change the spice level to suit your needs.

The chicken marinade is excellent. As others suggested, you can also cook the chicken on skewers under your oven broiler for similar results.  However, the sauce as written has some issues. 8oz of tomato + 1c of cream is way out of proportion, too much cream and not a real sauce. I used 16oz tomato + 1c cream and still thought it was too rich, I'll probably try 28oz tomato next time. You'll want more sauce than is written anyway because 8oz + 1c is just barely enough sauce to cover the chicken, you'll likely want more for whatever side dish you serve it with (rice + naan is pretty standard). Also, I cut the salt by at 1tsp and it could have used less. 1/2 jalapeno was enough kick for me.  Overall, it's one of the better tikka masala recipes I've tried. Stick with the chicken, but there's room for improvement with the sauce.

I made this for my family and my sister's family last night.  I tried to make it as close to the recipe as possible, but omitted most of the salt as it seemed to be quite a bit.  I think it was really good for a first attempt at Indian food.  Next time I might go to an Indian store and purchase some garam masala to give it a little more authenticity.  Still it was quite tasty.

I always order tikka masala and now I don't  have to because this is delicious -Didn't use lemon juice or jalapeño since I didn't have any - didn't make a difference -Only 2 teaspoons salt in marinade and 1 teaspoon in the sauce - Preferred slightly less cayenne then called for -Used cream for marinade instead of yogurt since my market only sells big tubs plain yogurt - turned out fine -Don't have a BBQ so i put chicken pieces on a cookie sheet, top rack turning repeatedly until well done/browned -Added a little bit more cream to final sauce, boyfriend liked it even better that way -Poured over cooked brown basmati rice -Try adding some frozen peas to change it up  Fantastic recipe, I think a novice cooker can do this one, easy to manipulate for your taste buds

We LOVE this recipe, I make it once a week. My husband used to live in India and had converted me to Indian food. The only problem is, this recipe is very time consuming. It helps if he is cooking with me while I make it or it takes forever. I took someone's advice to broil the chicken in a roasting pan and rotate, instead of grill because we don't have a grill, we have also sauted the chicken instead to save time, and it is definitely not as good as when it is broiled/grilled. I love this recipe, if you like Indian food, try it!

This was quite tasty! It stands up fine with chicken tikka you'd get at any restaurant. My only suggestions are the following:   1. As other users have noted, LEAVE THE SALT OUT! There's already a ton of salt in prepackaged tomato sauce--at most, add another teaspoon or so. 2. Marinating the chicken for more than an hour will add to the flavor and make it juicier. 3. Broiling works just fine if you don't feel like starting the grill--5 minutes on each side and you'll be done.

This was very tasty but it was also kind of a hassle. I'll probably make it again but I'll prepare as much as I can far in advance.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using other reviewer's suggestions and not using as much salt. I used 2 tsp. of salt for the marinade, and 2 tsp. for the sauce-keep in mind that the sauce reduces, and the salt will be more concentrated as well, so next time, I'll only use 1 tsp. of salt in the sauce. Instead of grilling the chicken, I threaded the chunks onto skewers and put them under my broiler on a rack, over foil so there was little mess. The char/sear on the chicken is definitely a good thing, so I wouldn't skip that step. Overall, this was really delicious, and the level of heat was fine for me (I added more smoked paprika to the sauce, too).

Hands down one of the easiest Tikka Masala recipes with the best flavor. Sometimes for a twist I broil the chicken in it's marinade in the oven and add peas to the sauce!

Not that I need to add to the multitude of good reviews for this recipe, but this is a FABULOUS recipe.  It is my brother's favorite, and I always serve it with Naan (another recipe from this site).  The first time I made it exactly as printed and it was wonderful.  Since, I have substituted a mixture of half and half and 1% milk for the heavy cream, and it is still wonderful!!!  Last night I was out of tomato sauce, so I pureed a can of diced tomatoes and just simmered the sauce a little longer and it was STILL wonderful!  Was also out of fresh jalapeno, so I used some jarred dried jalapeno from Penzeys and still got the right amount of heat.  The chicken is always wonderful, whether cooked outside on the grill, or inside on grill pan. For a while I searched for a "healthier" side dish to add some green, so last night we sauteed frozen peas with chopped onion, a little butter, 1/2 tsp of sweet curry powder and 1/2 tsp of dried basil - it is a great complement and now my meal is complete! I cannot say enough about this dish - it is easy to make as decadent or healthy as you want without sacrificing deliciousness.

This was so tasty! I used skinless boneless thighs, kosher salt instead of regular salt and for a low fat version, I used yogurt instead of cream. I will make this again and again. For those of you who don't like too much heat in their food, use half the cayenne.

Really really good, but very fattening.  I've substituted plain yogurt for the butter and it still turns out pretty good.

EXCELLENT Indian dish!  I made it for a birthday party and so many people requested the recipe.  If you do not like a lot of salt, cut back what the recipe calls for.  My 6 year old adds the leftover plain yogurt to his to tone down the heat!  Great recipe.  P.S. You do not have to cook the chicken on skewers.  Just cook the bite-size pieces on a grated pan (so the juices drain) over the stove.

Fantastic recipe. I made a big batch so we'd get several meals out of it. The only change I made was to use less salt since I read some people found it too salty. Used half what the recipe called for, and it turned out fine. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Very good recipe.  After marinating the chicken, I sauted it instead of grilling it.  Then drained the juice and added to the sauce.

Unfortunately, I couldn't read the extended reviews on my husband's quirky computer, so I didn't know that I should cut down the salt - WAY too salty.  Almost inedible (add a potato if you've already done it).  Will try it again with less salt - can see great potential.

Yum! The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out extremely hot (but delicious). I was the only one that could stomach eating it unfortunately... The second time I made it, I obmitted the cayenne and jalapeno - Very good!! The cumin gave it enough oomph but was able to be devoured by the kids and husband. No leftovers this time. I served it with the Naan (by Mic) and Indian style basmati rice (by Dhan0923) recipes on this website - WOW! What a meal!! One note of advice: Double your recipe - 3 chicken breasts are not enough for 2 adults and 2 small children.

Well, this is my first review on this site that I have been using for a while. I cut the salt to a couple dashes for the marinade and a couple for the sauce. I used 3/4 of a Jalepeno and it was perfect spice. I made naan and rice, with grilled asparagus on the side. This is one of the best meals I have ever had. Just like Naan & Curry in San Francisco. Perfect!!!!!!

Really really good! probably 4.5 stars. My husband and I love Indian food and I've been trying to find a good recipe to make at home. This is it. A couple changes to the marinade, only used 1 tsp salt, and 1 tsp cayenne. For the sauce I sauteed 1/2 onion with the garlic, added garam masala, used milk instead of cream and petite diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce. we like our sauce a bit more chunky. Served with basmati rice and naan. will make again!

Thanks for posting such a beautiful recipe. We often make Indian dishes In our house and this Is better than any dish yet. Almost as good as resturant quality. As the other reveiws stated I added less salt. I also the first time around read the recipe wrong.Instead of using the cilantro to garnish I threw It In with the sauce at the very end. It gave it an authentic taste and to me It made the recipe. This Is how I will be making It In the future. Thanks again. Im currently In the process of making the marinade. Yum Yum, cant wait for tea tonight.

One word.  YUM!  I followed other reviewers' advice and omitted most of the salt. (Who needs all that sodium?) This was delicious and simple. Can't get much better then that.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I all but omitted the salt in this recipe, and thought it delicious. It being December in Detroit we cooked the skewers on the oven rack at 525, which is an excellent option for those in colder climates!

I've made two batches of this so far. For both, I omitted the salt entirely. The first batch I did not have a jalapeno pepper available to me, but it turned out "just right" spice-wise for my children though the adults could have used some more heat. The second batch I used half and half instead of cream and it did NOT turn out as well. It doesn't thicken and the rich, creamy flavour is missing, so I would definitely NOT skimp on the cream.

Excellent! Although i didnt use anywhere near as much salt as stated, about 1/2 a tsp for the marinade and a tsp for the sauce. Also added about 1/2 a tsp of ground coriander.

Really great and authentic recipe! If you think the tomato taste is too strong, cook the chicken in its marinade on the stove, rather than on skewers. You'll taste the spices of the dish better, and the tomato sauce will act as it's supposed to by dulling down the spicyness, rather than adding a tomato flavor.

I have yet to find a better basic recipe.  I did, however, change a few things.  I doubled the jalapeno, garlic, and cilantro.  Instead of placing all of the cilantro on top as a garnish, I mixed half in with the sauce.  If you do not have a mint chutney ready to eat with it, this makes up for that added zing.  Wonderful, spicy, and loved by all I've cooked for, this recipe rivals that of my favorite restaurant.  Just leave out the salt- yuck!

This was amazing! I couldn't get enough of the sauce! 
I made a few changes: coconut milk instead of cream; garam masala instead of cinnamon; reduced jalapeno, cumin, and paprika; and only 1 tsp salt total. Also, since I don't have a grill, I just threw the chicken in the pot at the end to simmer for 10 minutes. It didn't have that grilled taste, but it was still good and tender.

Like most here, I would get rid of the salt or maybe just have 1 tsp in the final sauce. I added a tsp of garam masala to the marinade, and some more garlic to the sauce. I also substituted coconut milk for the cream.

And yes, this is spicy, and not for novices. Know that certain types of paprika (like Hungary half-sharp) can also add a bit of heat. If you're concerned about the heat, I would use less cayenne, less paprika and/or get rid of the jalapenos.

Finally, I don't care for cilantro so realize there are a minority of people who don't like it and make sure you like it before you put it on your food.

This was really good. Two things I would add is that I live in a small apartment and only have stovetop. Sear the chicken in cast iron skillet 5-7 minutes and chuck it in the sauce, it's very tender. Also add some onion with the jalapeno and Be careful with Grand Masala powder because the second ingredient is cinamon so it's pretty cinamonny(word?). I would use it in the marinade but not the sauce.

This didn't taste like what I've had at Indian restaurants all, but perhaps it was my fault because I didn't follow directions to the letter, so I settled on 3 stars.  I didn't have cream, so I used milk, and I marinated for a day, because I just don't believe in marinating chicken for an hour.  The chicken ended up super-hot, and still didn't have that tandoori flavor I thought the yogurt would give it.  The sauce just tasted like tomato sauce with cumin to me, not like masala. I probably won't try this again.

Tikka Masala is usually what I order at Indian restaurants so I have some basis for comparison.  This is a very good recipe and it's fairly simple to make. I read the reviews before I made this and I was careful with the salt and ended up adding maybe 1/3-1/2 of what the recipe called for.  With that slight alteration, the recipe was fairly characteristic of what you'd get at a restaurant!  I did use a george foreman grill for the chicken and I didn't bother skewering the meat.  It turned out just fine!

This was super easy to make and absolutely DELICIOUS!! Only thing I changed was that I baked the chicken at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, it was too cold outside to grill...turned out great!

This is an AWESOME recipe!  I have cravings for this occasionally and this is so much cheaper than eating out.  I have made this twice.  The first time I used fat-free half & half and nonfat yogurt, and it was actually better than the second time when I followed the recipe.  I will make this again and again.

Probably one of the best recipes I've tried here! It tastes EXACTLY like tikka masala you get in Indian restaurants. I scaled the recipe to 2 servings but kept the same amount of sauce. I'm so glad I did! :) Added a teaspoon of garam masala but the original recipe is great as is. Would give it 6 stars if I could! (I second the salt remark, though: better "to taste" than using what the recipe calls for).

Mmm, so good! I entertained with this dish twice in two weeks, and it was an impressive hit. You can eyeball the ingredients and adjust easily for larger crowds. For the cream sauce, I used a large can of diced tomatoes with half-and-half, and it was delicious. Even without all the spices listed (no ginger), it was delicious with many layers of spices going on without being "hot spicy". The yogurt marinade was very fast to make and makes the chicken so tender and tasty! Also, I don't own a grill, so I just heated up the frying pan and placed the chicken pieces in there until they were cooked through. Served on top of white rice, it was very filling. Thank you so much!

This was an excellent base recipe. I did make some changes.

First, I used maybe 1/2 teaspoon of salt for the sauce and for the marinade. 

Next, when I was simmering the tomatoe sauce and the whipping cream, I added about 6 cloves of garlic - 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper, a teaspoon of generic curry poweder, and about 1 heaping tablespoon of garam masala.

I like things super spicy which is why I went overboard on the red pepper flakes. Turned out very good. DON'T skip on the cilantro. I think its key to this...

Delicious and simple. I made this recipe two nights in a row (I live hrs away from any Indian restaurants) and made it with heavy whipping cream once and fat free half and half once. The whipping cream made a lot of a difference. I also added onion to the jalapeno pepper/garlic chop and added chopped cashews and golden raisins at the end. I also used cayenne powder to bring the heat up to my liking. It's not as excellent as Ambar's on Ludlow but definitely is a good substitute.

I steeped the chicked in the incredible pungent yogurt for 24 hours and left out the lemon juice, and thanks to the cautions of other reviewers, about half the salt. Then, instead of grilling the chicken, I sauteed it in 1 tbs of oil; the marinade provided all the flavor. I started the curry base with a cup of diced onions, in a covered pot, until they were sweet and soft, then added the rest of the ingredients. And because I dislike the heavy consistency of cream, I used half & half, and it came out incredibly smooth and beautifully aromatic. Try this recipe for a vegetarian crowd and substitute whole button mushrooms and cubed paneer for the chicken. Serve with jeera rice and chilli paneer. IT WILL NOT DISSAPPOINT!

This was excellent - and even better the next day as leftovers. I made a few modifications: like practically everyone else, I cut the salt in half. I used half and half instead of heavy cream, tripled the garlic and used two jalapenos (remove seeds and seed spines) and also a couple of serrano pepers. (My family likes food spicy, but the cream really does cut the heat from the peppers)

After making this several times, I have found that the heat comes more from the cayenne in the chicken marinade than it does from the peppers in the sauce. Smaller pieces of chicken covered in the marinade = hotter (because of the surface area). Reduce "heat" by cutting the cayenne in half or by leaving the breasts whole as they soak in the marinade.

Overall, it is fantastic and is a regular at my house. Good enough for company. Pair it with the Indian Basmati Rice recipe on this site.

Great recipe. I followed it, but cut the salt. I found this recipe a little "sweeter" than our local restaurant..any suggestions what to do to take out the sweetness of the Tomato based sauce?

Absolutely delicious - we eat authentic Indian food in NYC and this was a restaurant quality dish.  I used half the salt and the dish was fine.  Make sure you have basmati rice and either naan or pita to accompany a great meal!

Ah...the official dish of London! I have now made this several times, and it is always delicious. Caveat: The 5-star rating is based on the assumption that the salt is reduced. (From the outset, I completely ignored the wild amount of salt recommended and just went with my own instincts--i.e., a good dash of kosher salt each time.)  There's a good deal of cleanup afterward, but it is absolutely worth hosing out a bowl and scrubbing down the JennAir. Thanks, Yakuta!

I love chicken tikka masala but it's usually too spicy for me to handle. I made this recipe eliminating all the spicy engredients just added a 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper to the chicken marinade. We loved it! I listened to other reviews and added only about 1/2 tsp of salt to the marinade and 1/2 tsp salt to the sauce, and it was plenty. I may eliminate salt altogether next time.  In the marinade, I used 1 tsp. garam masala. I marinated for about 24 hours. For the sauce, I used 1 small cloves garlic. I marinated all day. I made double the amount of the sauce, which I would definitely recommend doing as it was absolutely delicious on rice and to dip bread into. For a doubled recipe, I used 3 tsp cumin, 3 tsp paprika, and 3 tsp garam masala, and only 1/2 tsp salt. I used a 15oz can of tomato sauce and 2 cups heavy cream. This recipe was amazing. It saved all of the Tikka Masala flavor I love and with eliminating the spicy engredients it lacked the heat I can't handle. Next time I will also make this with the naan on this site. Highly recommend the recipe with the recommended changed.

Awesome dish. If it wasn't so time consuming to make I would do it more often. I use it for special occasions now and it never fails to please.

Excellent Indian dish.  Truthfully, I could not believe THIS came out of MY kitchen.  Making the marinade, then grilling prior to making the saute sauce seemed like too many steps, but in the end I saw the absolute need for it.  I used the marinade time to get the saute sauce ready and cleaned up dishes I had dirtied, so good time to multi-task as well.  So the taste.... BOLD and spot on with restaurant versions of this.  The cumin and paprika stood out, with a residual spicy kick.  Definitely is not a bland dish whatsoever! We put over steamed white rice.  It is a new item in our dinner rotations!

I loved this! Creamy and delicious, this was perfect for me (I don't like overbearing curry flavors). Notes: I reduced the 3tsp of salt in the sauce to 1 1/2 and it was right on the verge of being too salty. I also pan-fried the chicken instead of grilling to save time.

I will start on a good note because I was able to save this just in the nick of time. Family loved this and I'd put it on our favorites list, with modifications.  I learned my lesson the one time I didn't read a bunch of reviews before starting....holy SALT!! What in the world??! At first I thought it would be okay because the marinade wouldn't all be consumed with all that salt. Well, the chicken soaked up quite a bit of the marinade after only 1.5 hours so I decided to read some reviews before putting more salt in the sauce. I decided not to add any more, and next time I will reduce the amount in the marinade as well (and we're not afraid of salt around here usually). I can't in good conscience rate this recipe any higher as written, but I do appreciate the author sharing it.

OMG..This is divine!!! I was really skeptical about the recipe but this is simply delicious. I marinated my chicken overnight using the ingredients listed but I substituted 5 tsp garam masala for the spices & only 1/2ts salt. Broiled the chicken on the skewer for about 10 minutes. Cook the sauce as instructed but I also added some garam masala in the sauce (1tsp cumin, 1tsp paprika & 1 1/2 tsp garam). Excellent over rice...still yearning it again

I have always been intimidated by Indian recipes (even though I love indian food). Tonight I was brave and tried out this recipe and was REALLY impressed. It's super easy, and the results were VERY good. Not as good as some of the better indian restaurants that I have been to…. but waaay better than any of the indian sauces that I've tried out of a jar over the years.

I marinated my chicken for a few hours… and also cut WAY back on the salt. 7 teaspoons of salt in this recipe is WAY too much salt!! I used maybe 2 teaspoons altogether and honestly, it was even that a bit too salty!

A fabulous recipe. Will definitely made again.

I make this recipe all the time.  My husband and I both love it.  I usually lick the plate and the pan.. I don't want any of that sauce to go to waste.  I do only use one tsp of salt in the marinade and 1 tsp of salt.  And I only use a little bit of cayenne.  I do use hot smoked paprika because I have a ton of it on hand all the time and I find that gives it enough heat.  Highly recommend.  If I don't have some of the ingredients on hand, it doesn't stop me from making it.  Still delicious even if you don't have lemon or ginger or cilantro.  (But I really love cilantro.)  I also always use greek yogurt just because it's what I always have in the fridge.

Yum! I don't usually rate a recipe when I alter it, but there are over 1700 reviews here so it probably won't matter. I did not use any salt until the sauce was simmering and then i only added it to taste. I replaced the cream with coconut milk and I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs. This tastes so much like what i get at our local Indian restaurant.

I have had some amazing Indian food over the years and am very picky in this regard, so I wouldn't say this close to the restaurant taste as written, but is an excellent starting point...if you want a more authentic flavor try cutting the cumin in half and adding fenugreek, which comes as either whole seeds or leaves at some Indian grocers, but I think the best thing if you can get a hold of the seeds is grind them to a powder using a mortar and pestle or blender and add 1/2 tsp. at a time to your taste. The fenugreek is a must in the CTM at the best Indian restaurants, you will know as soon as you get a whiff of it. one other thing, when I make this at home I often take a pita bread, smear with butter and sprinkle on some garlic and cilantro, and just put under the broiler for a few mins 'til butter melts and pita is a little crispy (my version of the garlic nan)...these things being said thank you much Yakuta this is a great base recipe that you can take and run with to make your CTM dreams come true :)

My family loved this recipe.  I did take the advice of several posters and cut the salt in HALF.  If you don't like spicy, don't put in the whole jalepno!  Altogether an awesome dish.  We served it over brown rice with a simple salad.  YUMMO!

I'm giving it 3 stars because it can be great, all you have to do is NOT PUT 3 TEASPOONS OF SALT IN IT. I suspect 1 teaspoon would be fine (if not too much), but 3 teaspoons turns this into the saltiest thing you've eaten all year. Cut way back on the salt and I think this is an excellent base for a tikka masala curry.

This is a very easy recipe for a delicious dish!  Has very authentic flavors and if you serve it with basmati rice it pulls out the flavors even more. Everytime I make this I have to double the sauce, because everyone keeps going back for more rice with sauce on it even if there is no chicken left! It is one of my top ten!

I'd give it 4 stars, but after all the reviews of too much salt allrecipes.com still has not changed the recipe.  One could nearly get away with no salt in this recipe!  If you follow the recipe to a T you will ruin your meal...or you have no tastebuds whatsoever

This is the BEST Chicken Tikka Masala recipee I have ever tried! To add more vegetables, I fried up an onion with the jalapeno and garlic and once the sauce was all together I quartered about a dozen cherry tomatoes and let them cook in the sauce a little bit. Also, I literally only used a half a t of salt in the marinade and even less in the actual sauce.

TOO MUCH SALT!  The recipe is great, but salt to taste!  During first attempt at following the recipe I tested it and was like - oh no!  This is like eating salt!  I had to almost triple the sauce to try and fix it.

This is a favorite in our home, however, DO NOT use as much salt as stated in the recipe.  1 tsp is plenty, you'll get the saltiness from the butter/tomato sauce.

Great recipe, but doesn't come close to the Indian restaurants I've been to! Then again I've been eating Indian for years, and I think San Diego- and what I call "Little India" here- has spoiled me! Best not to compare it to a restaurant or you might find yourself disappointed. 

I took tips from the other reviewers and made the following changes:

-Used half the salt
-Used 2 tsp garam masala for the marinade and no cinnamon 
-Marinated the chicken for AT LEAST 24 HOURS!
-Used a tin-foil lined pan in the broiler to cook the chicken.
-Added 2-3 tsp garam masala in addition to the other spices in the sauce
-Only used 1/2 jalapeno pepper
-Doubled the sauce (including doubling above tweaks to the sauce) When in doubt, double the sauce! Lots more yummy stuff to mix in with the rice!

If you're looking for a great vegetarian version of this to try, check out the Cauliflower and Tofu Masala on this site!

Other reviewer suggestions definitely make this a 5 star recipe. I used 1 package Costco boneless chicken thighs. Marinated for 90 min with yogurt, juice from half a lemon, omitted the salt, 5 tsp garam masala, 1/4 tsp cayenne, black pepper. Grilled. Made sauce as directed but used a 15 oz can tomato sauce, garam masala instead of other spices, and a 1/4 cup low fat half and half. This was outrageously good and is going in my regular rotation.

I made this recipe for 20 people last week and it was outstanding.  I halved the spices and left most of the heat out of the sauce.  I salted to taste ignoring the stated amounts.  I also used crushed tomatoes instead of sauce and used an immersion blender to get the right consistency.  I cooked the chicken in a convection oven which worked nearly as well as grilling.  I served the chcicken with rice, naan, and Sriracha sauce and chopped jalapenos on the side.

This recipe is easy, very tasty, and has wide appeal.  I would recommend spicing it as stated above for the first time and adjust from there.

Thanks Yakuta for sharing this wonderful dish!

I really wish I had read the other reviews before making this.  It was terrible!  I reduced the amount of salt due to the fact that 7 teaspoons seemed like a lot, but it was still far too salty.  However, I don't think that being salty is its only problem.  It didn't have any depth of flavor.  The sauce mainly just tasted like salty tomato sauce.  I won't ever make this again.  I think fixing it would require changing the recipe so much that it would be a new recipe instead.

I have used this recipe to make Fish Tikka Masala with salmon.  One word: AWESOME!!  I will say that this recipe calls for WAY more salt than I would ever use.  I only use 1tsp for the marinade & 1tsp for the sauce.  I never bother with the jalapeno & get plenty of heat from cayene or crushed red pepper instead.  I also substitue coconut cream for heavy cream in the sauce.  My family, includingy my picky nephew, LOVE this dish!!

As written, this recipe is nearly unusable. Follow the highly rated reviews and get rid of so much of the salt and at least double the amount of tomato sauce. After the fist few times making this recipe, I no longer marinade the chicken. Instead, I add those seasonings (plus some ginger) to the tomato sauce (use a large can of tomato puree and adjust seasonings to taste), take chicken breasts and cut up into sizable pieces and simmer in the tomato sauce until everything is cooked through. Sure you lose all that comes with grilled chicken, but it's so much easier and faster. Also, you'll end up playing with the seasonings if you make this multiple times. I've found the cinnamon is the one you need to watch the most and it can really alter the flavor if you add too much.

This is the best Tikka Masala recipe I've ever found. It's proven better than most restaurants in our predominantly Indian neighborhood. Also great for beginners because all of the ingredients are readily accessible and easy to work with. Thanks for this staple in our house!

WAY TOOOO MUCH SALT!!!!  Wish I would have read the other reviews first.  This could easily be a 5 star dish.  If you make this dish use 1/4 of the salt.  I think it might make sense to use a little bit more salt then usual in the chicken marinade to tendorize, as you throw out most of that sauce.  But don't even think about putting 3 teaspoons of salt in the second part.

made this with alterations and was awesome! firstly, followed other reviewers suggestions and added salt to taste instd of following the recipe's requirements and also added 2 tspn garam masala to the marinade and just a light sprinkling of cinnamon since garam masala has cinnamon in it. also added lime juice and 2 tbsp of soy sauce to the marinade--i add soy sauce to almost everything, the msg gives a really yummy taste. i also threw in 2 tbsp of dried fenugreek leaves into the marinade. for the sauce, i doubled the sauce, added garam masala to taste, red chilli powder instead of paprika, red pepper flakes, more lime juice, a handful of fresh fenugreek leaves finely chopped, subbed 1 c sour cream in place of the heavy cream, and added a healthy squeeze of honey. I broiled my chicken on high until it was semi-done and all the marinade that was kind of stuck around it dried up, then added the chicken to the sauce. then i tokd about 4-5 fresh curry leaves and sauteed them in 1 tbsp of butter until flagrant, dumped the butter/leaves into the pot with the chicken/sauce and quickly covered it for 5 minutes to allow the steam to settle flavor into the dish. this is a method we use often for pakistani/indian food and it adds a nice touch! so..i am done now and it tastes yummy! better than restaurant quality!

Definitely leave out most of the salt and just add it to taste at the end. I also added about a table spoon of sugar but I had crushed tomatos instead of tomato sauce so that could the reason it needed the sugar. I doubled the sauce and was glad I did because it was really great mixed with rice.

This recipe was very good.  I didn't have a grill so I broiled my chicken on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet that was lined in foil.  I only used one half of a chicken breast because there's only two of us.  I only used a little more than half of the cayenne pepper and a teaspoon of salt both in the marinade and in the sauce.  I also added a tablespoon of minced garlic and two teaspoons of garam masala to both.  I had some leftover tomato puree so i used that instead of the tomato sauce but my sauce ended up being very thick so I will be sure not to make that substitution next time.  I also replaced the heavy cream with half and half to make it a bit lighter.  I ate it with basmati rice and it was delicious! I will definitely be making it again! Thanks!

WAY TOO MUCH SALT - oh how I wish I had read the reviews before cooking. It took a long time to prepare, and the salt ruined it, it was also very spicey. I would make again with little to no salt and less spice as I think it would be delicious. I tried to find ways to make it less salty - so added potatoes to draw out the salt, sprinkled some sugar in it and ended up adding BBQ sauce as a desperate measure.

Made this after coming back from London where I had some amazing Indian food.  With slight changes this came out to great restaurant quality. I lessen the marinade to 3/4 tsp cayenne and marinated the chicken about 24 hrs in the frig.  I also just broiled the chicken in the oven (took 2 cookie tray full, be sure to put foil on the tray first.)

For the sauce I omitted the jalapeno and used 3/4 tsp of sriracha pepper sauce instead as someone suggested. Also used low fat half-half instead of cream and lessened the salt a bit.  Wonderful with homemade naan recipe from this site but added garlic to the naan dough.  Next time I'll try the masala with coconut milk instead of half-half

This is incredible.  I've made it twice, the first time I didn't have ginger.  It was good, but lacking that "something".  Second time, I did like other reviewers said and halved the salt, but otherwise followed exactly.  It's amazing, probably the best thing I've made from this site.

Hands down one of my favorite recipes from this site.  Like other reviewers I cut way back on the salt and cut the pepper down by about 2/3's - it was too spicy for the family.  I also use fat free half and half and I make about twice the amount of sauce called for.  Lastly, you can marinade the chicken overnight.

Salt, salt, and more salt.  Take the salt out and it would be great.  We loaded on the Basmati rice to settle it down somewhat.

really good! restaurant quality, not the best restaurant but better than average and definitely better than i thought i was capable of. i completely ommitted salt, doubled the sauce, added a tablespoon or so of garam masala, and was generous with the cilantro cause i love it. still looking for what's missing in the flavor because it isn't as complex as my favorite indian restaurant's, but still a very good and worthwhile meal!

I can't believe more people aren't noticing the over the top saltiness!!! One star for the original recipe. Made it again a second time since I love tikka masala and wanted to make it work. Only used one teaspoon salt for the sauce, none for the marinade. Much better!! Pretty close to tikka masala I've had at restaurants. Will make it again with the modifications, maybe a quarter of the cayenne in the marinade so my kids can enjoy it also.

This has become my go-to recipe for Chicken Tikka; however, here's my change-up (after multiple tries): NO SALT, double the sauce, marinate the chicken overnight (in twice as much yogurt), mix dark and white chicken pieces.  Don't eliminate the jalapeno or the fresh cilantro because they really give this recipe added dimension and kick.  We eat this over basmati or jasmine rice.  For extra-sauce dipping, we use pita bread that we split, butter, salt/pepper, and broil in the oven.  YUM.

7 teaspoons of salt in this recipe? I trusted the recipe, made it, and it was so salty it was inedible and I had to throw it out. It would have been good with half of that.

ABSOLUTELY FANNNNNTASTIC! I'm Puerto Rican and made it for an older friend who is from Bangladesh.....I asked for them to severely critique it and they said it was delicious and very authentic tasting. 

I did make minor adjustments to this recipe: 

In the marinating step instead of 4 tsp of salt I lowered the salt to just 1tsp and I also added 2 minced garlic cloves to the marinade (I'm a garlic freak). 

In the sauce making step I added 1 large onion finely chopped to the sauteeing of the garlic and jalapeno. I lowered the salt from 3tsps to only 1/2 tsp of salt. Instead of 1 garlic clove, I used 2 garlic cloves. I reduced the heavy cream from 1 cup to 1/2 cup (I think next time I just might leave it out completely).  I added one 13oz can of coconut milk.  I also added 1 teaspoon of turmeric. And I added 4 tsps of garam masala.

I've never made chickent tikka masala before but have always purchased it and did notice a difference....this Tikka was not sweet and what I've purchased has always been on the sweet side. I was told by my Bangladeshi friend that their family prefers the chicken tikka masala not sweet but that foreigners tend to prefer it sweet. So I was told in that case just to add a teaspoon or two of sugar to the sauce as it is cooking. I think I actually prefer it not sweet.

THANK YOU FOR TEACHING ME HOW TO MAKE CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA. I will never buy the frozen dinner kind again!

If you follow recipe for salt amount you will not be able to eat it.  I only needed 1/2 tsp salt for marinade and then another 1/2 tsp salt for sauce.  Because of my own taste I halved the cinnamon and cumin in the marinade and the cumin in the sauce.  That is not a flaw in the recipe...just my own taste!  I also added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper to sauce as well.  Served with Jasmine rice because that is all I had on hand and grilled Naan Bread.  Very Very Very Good meal!!!  Family called it an "again" meal!!!

Very salty! It was wonderful except the salt. I like salty a lot, and I thought it was too much. Otherwise an excellent dish. Next time I will use half the salt.

This was really yummy!  I cooked the chicken in a skillet on the stove instead of using the grill.  Also I did add all of the salt to the marinade but I didn't add any salt to the sauce.  My family didn't think it was too salty we thought it was fine.

This was absolutely a fabulous recipe for Tikka masala. Comparable to restaurant quality and I really enjoyed it! Two things that I would definitely change on this recipe is: doubling the sauce and leaving out the 3 tsp of salt to the sauce! I didnt even put in the full 3tsp and it was still really salty. The salt is why I rated it a 4 instead of 5

This was perfect. I found myself with an entire day where I could be around the kitchen and decided to put this in a slow cooker. I don't have a grill so I cooked the chicken under the broiler for 5 minutes and then 3 minutes on the other side. I just used a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. I had no trouble with sticking. I sauteed the garlic and jalapeno per the recipe and added the seasonings. When I was about to add the tomato sauce, I transferred everything to the slow cooker and finished the sauce there. Once the chicken was done, I turned it up to high for 2 hours and then down to low for about 3 more. By the time dinner rolled around, the chicken was tender and fell apart with the light touch of a fork. I recently had this same dish from my favorite Indian restaurant and I am not certain that there is a discernable difference between their food and this recipe. Will make this at every opportunity. :)

This recipe has an insane amount of salt in it. It was inedible! If you use about 1/8 specified for both the marinade and sauce it may actually taste alright. I' m not sure what planet the author is from or if this is some kind of joke, but if you follow this recipe as written you will not want to eat this.

This is AWESOME!!!!!!! This taste better than my favorite Indian Restaurant, which is very pricey might I add! I will never, ever pay those prices again! I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the sauce because I like to take my Naan bread on a ride in it. My kids who are picky also loved it. Thanks for the Recipe!

My husband and I love this recipe.  We make it regularly, but like many others we cut back on the salt.  I use 1 teaspoon in the marinade and 1 teaspoon in the sauce.

Great dish-my 8 and 11 year old loved it.  I held the salt and doubled the sauce.  A little creamy so will try yogurt/coconut milk/ or half and half next time.
I added green and red pepper and onion with the chicken and it went over well.
Definite A list recipe.
Worked great on broiler pan in oven.

I make this recipe frequently and it is loved by everyone that tries it. It is a bit on the spicy side, you can reduce the cayenne to make it more mild, or increase it if you like it extra hot. I tend to reduce the salt too, and I pan fry the chicken instead of grilling. If you pan fry you will need to pour off most of the liquid or the marinade will take forever to reduce.

Very good, simple to prepare and comes together quickly.  I always marinate the chickent overnight.  For the sauce, I saute a little chopped onion, garlic, and jalapeno along with some grated fresh ginger.  I use two cans of tomato sauce (we like lots of sauce to go along with naan).  Homemade naan is the best but Trader Joe's makes a decent one that's great for weeknight meals.  Sometimes I add a little corriander powder to the sauce as well.

Absolutely delicious.......with a few modifications!
I used boneless, skinless thighs and marinade for 24 hours. Reduce salt to 1 tsp each for marinade and sauce.  I added a can of fire roasted tomatoes with garlic to the sauce. Also, added some curry powder to sauce and marinade because I love it.  Served over yellow rice with peas.  Sooo good:)

We doubled this recipe and it came a little salty, otherwise it was much better than I could have expected!  The whole family enjoyed it!  Ok we made this again and I have to say I love this recipe but the salt has to go.

I'm not a frequent cook, but after my first try with Indian food I could not get it off my mind. I saw a wonderful tikka masala dish on TV and went looking for a good recipe. This...oh my goodness. It blows my mind. I'm not sure how authentic it is, but the recipe is exceptionally easy to alter and make your own if you want it spicier.

I used chopped skinless, boneless chicken thighs (they were on sale) and marinated them on skewers overnight, then cooked them on the grill. I would've eaten them plain! I took the advice here and used only a teaspon of salt in the marinate, and another in the sauce.

I also doubled the sauce recipe, used a can of evaporated milk to double the cream a bit more healthily, and instead of doubling the spices, I used three teaspoons of garam masala. Wonderful! Usually serve this with some warmed up naan (or pita bread - if you're not a purist and don't have a good Indian store nearby, it's cheaper) and jasmine rice. I dream about this recipe sometimes! I made it multiple times and it got great reviews from my parents. Definitely worth a try.

This recipe (with modifications) is VERY GOOD & highly recommended.  I also modified the recipe (per the suggestions/comments made).    In the marinade, I used 5 tsp garam masala (instead of the cumin/cinnamon/cayenne), 1 tsp pepper, & 1 tsp salt.  I also added 2 cloves garlic.  I did not use skewers at all.  I broiled the chicken on a broiler pan for 5 minutes on each side.  For the sauce, I doubled the recipe & used the following ingredients:  2 tablespoons butter 
2 teaspoons garlic, minced (2 cloves)
1 large onion, finely chopped
1 jalapeño pepper, finely chopped 
2 teaspoons ground cumin 
2 teaspoons paprika 
4 tsps garam masala
½ teaspoon salt, or to taste
a dash of cayenne pepper
2 (16 ounce) cans of tomato sauce 
2 cups heavy cream 
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro 
Next time I make it (& yes there were DEFINITELY be a next time) I will increase the heat (i.e.  spiciness).  It wasn't spicy enough for me.  It had a slight kick, but it was pretty mild.  I'm planning to double the jalapeño to 2 peppers and add more cayenne pepper (possibly add the 2 tsp back into the marinade & 1/2 tsp (or more) into the sauce.  Also, I might try substituting coconut milk for the heavy cream.
We enjoyed this recipe with a side of garlic naan - SO GOOD!

I'd give this 3.5.  I made as directed except I completely omitted the salt.  I actually found it pretty bland for the amount of spice that actually went in it.  Maybe the cream overpowered everything?

This recipe was outstanding! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I felt it had too much salt in it. There are a lot of different components to this dish, so it will keep you fairly busy, especially if you're trying to time it with a side of rice. I managed to time everything fairly well and served the chicken over some basmati rice. I really liked the flavor and it had a nice amount of spicy heat to it, but not too hot. I will definitely be making this again, but I'll probably cut the amount of salt in half.

I made this recipe as written and it was like eating spoonfulls of salt.  I can't fully blame the recipe because it did give an amount of salt and the added (but salt to taste), but most recipes get the amount pretty close even if you aren't a huge salt fan.  I love salty foods but this was inedible.

Very good!  I made this just like the recipe specified, cutting way back on the salt, and the heat level was just right.  I served it with rice.  Will make some pita bread next time.  The chicken turned out very tender and tasty!

LOVE this recipe! I've made it several times now and can't get enough of it. It takes a bit of time to make, but is well worth it. Making it again in a few days for some friends who want to come try our new found love of Indian Cuisine. We always serve it was the Naan from this site as well. Perfect meal!

This was unbelievable.  However even for a salt-aholic like me - way too much salt (7 tsp total)!!  I would cut that to 3 tsp.  Also, instead of skewering and grilling the chicken - I sauteed the marinated chicken on the stovetop - and after it was cooked - I just added it to the sauce.  We will definitely be making it AGAIN and can't wait!  Very spicy!!!  We put it over Basmati rice...

Very good! I took other reviewers suggestions and ommitted the salt (only added to taste), used half-n-half to cut on calories, added 2tsp garam masala, 2tsp cumin, 1tsp cayenne/paprika, and 1/2tsp of sugar. It was amazing served with garlic naan and basmati rice, I can't wait to use this recipe to cook for guests!

This was our first time having tikka masala ever, and we liked it. I served it over brown rice. I halved the cayenne and still found it adequately spicy to my tastes -- I think the full amount as called for would not have gone over well for me personally (though my husband would've loved it). Thanks for the recipe!

Wow. Should be called Chicken Salty Masala. Way too much salt! If you try it be sure to salt to taste as you go. Was inedible with seven teaspoons of salt.

Absolutely delicious! After reading other reviews, I too really reduced the salt in both the marinade and sauces. I also used a dash of cayenne instead of jalepeno in the sauce, and garam masala instead of cinnamon in the marinade. Since I didn't want to mess around with skewers, I also cooked the marinated chicken on a wire rack (over a cookie tin) in the oven at 180C, as per some suggestions here.
After debating what the closest was to 'tomato sauce' here in Ireland, I used tomato passata after doing a bit of googling, and it came out just right.
This was by far the best recipe I've tried for tikka masala, and I served it with the Naan and Indian basmati rice recipes found on this site. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

1. Omit the salt, 2. you don't need to grill the chicken, just sautee it in the pan. This is so so good, very authentic flavors!

This was a delicious dish, however next time I will cut salt down to at least 1/2, other than that I loved all the layers of flavor.

I don't usually review recipes, but I have to make an exception for this.  I made this last night for dinner, and it was amazing! My husband, who doesn't like Indian food, wasn't looking forward to this meal.  And didn't know if he even wanted to try it. He tried it, and went back for seconds and thirds.  His exact words were "this is awesome." Definitely restaurant quality, if not better than some Chicken Tikka Masala I've had at places.  I only made minor adjustments. Two teaspoons of salt total (one is sauce/one in marinade), one teaspoon of cayenne, added onion to sauce and doubled it as well.  This came out great, and will make it again very soon! Served with basmati rice and naan.

Amazing! I used coconut milk instead if cream and also used garam masala instead of cinnamon in marinade. I baked the chicken in oven. I also used the garam masala in the sauce with cumin and a little salt, pepper, and cayanne pepper. Such a filling and satisfying meal!

As written, 1 star.  WAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY too much salt.  I don't trust myself that much, so I just figured I'd follow the recipe.  I was questioning the amount of salt, but figured the rave reviews and 4+ stars would know better than me.  *Should have read the reviews before!  Usually do, but I didn't think about it this time.  We may try this again, but I think I would do as others suggested and omit all salt except for a teaspoon or 2.

This was way too salty as written and also not great tasting.
I also don't get why chicken needs to be cooked on skewers on the grill....doesn't add much to the taste and makes the recipe that much more complicated.

I just made this, and I have to share how amazing it tastes! Almost if nto as good as restaurant quality....
I skipped the entire marinade recipe though, and used the Shaan Chicken Tikka Spice Mix...which you too can find in your indian grocery.
I marinated for abt 2 hrs with the mix, some ginger garlic paste and some lemon...
Then I followed the rest of the directions but instead of butter i used ghee sauteed onion, green chiles, and garlic in ghee...and used tomato sauce and half and half and cream...
DELISH!

I think this recipe is fantastic and I've probably made it about 50 times now.  I have made a couple of changes and this is what I've found works best:  for the marinade, I cut the salt down to 2 teaspoons.  When it comes down to making the sauce, I add an additional teaspoon of cayenne pepper to make it spicy (this could be left out if you don't like it that spicy).  I also add 1/2 teaspoon of garam masala.  I serve it with balsmati rice, to which I add a few cloves and a dash of cinnamon to while preparing).  You'll definitely never need to go out to eat this again after trying this recipe!

Great Dish!  I made it exactly as written and it was excellent.  I will cut the cayenne in half next time since the pepper and jalapeno are enough for me, and I will also cut back on the salt.  Other than that I can't wait to make this again!

Delicious! Marinade changes: low-fat plain yogurt, 1 tsp garam masala instead of cinnamon, 1 tsp cayenne, a quick shake of salt, 4 boneless breasts. Then I broiled the chicken for 10 mins since I didn't have a grill. 

Then for the sauce: 2 cloves garlic, no jalapeño, shake of salt, shake chili powder, 1/4 tsp garam masala, shake of dried coriander, and 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce. 

I made the sauce and chicken in the slow cooker---it was good but it was way too thick and the chicken got that "slow-cooker" texture. So, I'd recommend not using the slow-cooker for this. The next day I added a little skim milk to the leftovers and then the consistency of the sauce was better, but the chicken still had a weird texture. I'm confident though that using the above proportions in a normal pot would have fantastic results, as the actual taste of the sauce was out of this world. Served it over basmati rice!

So this dish is my husband's absolute favorite Indian dish.  So he asks me to make this at home to satisfy his cravings without having to go to a fancy Indian restaurant. I confess, I've been making this for a while with all kinds of short cuts or or trying to blend it with a recipe from an Indian recipe website.  I would sometimes skip the marinade or grilling steps, combining the sauces, cooking the chicken in the sauce itself, and not letting the sauce thicken. I now realize this was a big mistake. I finally followed the recipe, with a few tweaks, and it was incredible. I prefer using boneless, skinless thighs for more moist chicken pieces. I also use evaporated milk for a creamy lower fat option. If you can find turmeric, cardamom, and garam masala, feel free to use both of those to taste in the marinated and the sauce. Lastly, cayenne pepper or Mexican spicy tomato sauce make a simpler, smoother source of heat for the sauce.  Heat is the one thing I'm still learning to balance, especially since my husband likes more heat than I do.

This was a great recipe. It came very close to what I would expect from an Indian recipe. The only thing I would change, is put in only half the amount of salt suggested, or even less, otherwise it comes out a little too salty. If you don't have a grill, it works just fine if you use a large skillet and just cook the chicken there without skewers.

Listen to the suggestions and it'll be fabulous.  Cut the salt in the marinade, and garam masala instead of cinnamon.  Also, we used a serrano pepper instead of jalapeno, scrap out the seeds if you can't take the heat.
We cooked the chicken in a pan, and it worked just fine--just make sure to strain off any excess marinade.
Also, we threw a small cinnamon stick in when we cooked the rice.  It's what the Indian place we love does, and it gives a different, nice flavor.
Yay, go team.

Best Indian dish to make at home!!  The recipe from this site has been a staple in our house for a few years now.  The ONLY thing I change about this recipe is to decrease the amount of salt (we only use 1 teaspoon or less, but it really just depends on your tastes).... I always start out with less & add more if needed, no big deal.

Delicious! I followed the first suggestion and cut the salt. I added 3 tsp of salt to the marinade and none to the sauce. It was delicious! I will definitely make it again, although next time I'll try using a lighter cream...

Very tasty Indian dish. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and replaced the cumin and cinnamon in the marinade with an equal amount of garam masala. I used only 1/2 tsp. sea salt in the marinade and 1/2 tsp. sea salt in the sauce. I pan-fried the chicken rather than grilling it and cut out the cayenne and jalapeno. I also cut the amount of pepper in half and it was still spicy. Definitely double the sauce if you're looking for a more traditional Indian restaurant-type dish. I used half and half instead of cream.

Eh...I was really dissapointed with this recipe. I was trying to mimic the Tikka Masala that a local farmers market vendor and family owned Indian Restaurant uses. Their curry sauces are amazing and I'll continue to try to find something similar. This was WAY TOO SALTY (as some other people have mentioned) I am going to try and find another recipe, but I might try tweaking with different spices and coconut milk as one user said below. I guess this is a trial and error type of culinary classic that everyone differs in opinion when it comes to taste.

I cut salt and cayenne in half and it had plenty of kick. I also eliminated the jalepeno.

I am sorry to say that this did not taste too much like the Tikka Masala at the Indian restaurant I love so much. I think I should have taken the time to find Garam Masala like so many others did. That may make the difference.

Absolutely Delish!  My husband and I loved this!  I made a couple of revisions based on other reviews.  In the marinade I used 1/2 tsp of sea salt and only 1/2 tsp sea salt in the sauce.  It was perfect!  I also doubled the sauce and added onions and a little extra garlic!  I served it over Jasmine rice and it was great!  This reminded us of our favorite Thai dish Massumun Curry.  Next time I'm going to add some cooked chunks of potatoes, cooked carrots, coconut milk and boiled peanuts!  Perfect the way I made it but excited to try it different ways too!

*WOW*  This is a great Indian dish, full of flavor! Worth the little bit of work! Changes: I cut back the cayenne as I was making it for my kids as well.  Sautéed chicken, in olive oil, as pieces rather than skewer. Saved marinade and added for extra sauce. (be sure to bring to boil!)  Thanks for a wonderful addition to my recipe box!

I reduced the amount of salt, pepper and cayenne by alot but otherwise loved this recipe.  Ate the leftovers for lunch the next day and it was even better than the first day.

The reviewers are right 1-2 t salt total for the whole dish and 1 t cayanne worked for me plenty spicy. Reminds me of a dish I had in Pakistan. Wonderful flavor. I pared it with roasted potatoes.

Absolutely delicious!  I decreased the salt as recommended and also cayenne, black pepper, and jalapeno (I have lots of young eaters) and it was still wonderfully spicy. 

Actually, it was still too spicy for the kids, but they're just going to have to get used to it, because we loved it! :P

I eliminated the salt in the marinade. It was too much. Also I tried it with and without the cinnamon and found that I much prefer it without the cinnamon. I also added a bit more butter and heavy cream to the mixture. I found it needed a creamier taste in order to be more authentic. Overall a great recipe. I served it many times and my family loves it. I always serve it with basmati and naan.

I have made this several times now, and each time it tastes better than before!  I made it for my dad without telling him what it was (he would NOT have tried it had he known it was Indian) and now it is one of his favorite dishes and askes for it all the time!  The sauce freezed excellent, so I usually make a double batch and immediately freeze half of it for a quick dinner one night!

I love love love this recipe, the only thing is, the salt amounts are way too much.  Instead of using 4T i used 1T. I use this recipe every time.

So good!  

In addition to the recommendations to reduce the salt and to use garam masala, I also sauteed onion and carrot with the garlic and jalapeno, and then pureed them in a blender with a bit of water until smooth. So tasty!  I wish I had had more tomato sauce to add to it, to bring back that tomato taste, but it was still so good.

This recipe was very good--if you take out almost all of the salt.  I only used a 1/2 tsp. in the marinade and none in the sauce and it turned out great.  I also added 1 tsp. cayenne to the sauce to up the heat for my son, who wanted the sauce spicy--without the cayenne the sauce was not spicy at all, though flavorful.  Also, I think the cilantro was key to making the dish balanced and would not omit it. I will make this again.

Great recipe.  Left out all but 1t of the salt, added some garam masala (1t), used 1t cayenne, and 2 T of canned green chilis instead of the pepper.  Turned out just right (mild).

This recipe was good with all the modifications suggested by other reviewers. Such as making 4 servings with half the cayenne pepper, adding little or no salt and doubling the sauce to put over rice(using 2tsp paprika, cumin, and garam masala). The only difference I made to this recipe was that I added 1/2 a tablespoon of ginger paste to the sauce. I also didn't grill the chicken, instead I baked on a cookie rack on top of a foil-lined cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. My husband thought it had too much cumin, so I will cut that to half next time.  This dish is really good with vegetable biryani (basmati rice), cucumber-cilantro raita(yogurt recipe that I got on allrecipes as well), and garlic naan (from trader joe's). It tastes similar to the chicken tikka masala at our favorite Indian Restaurant in Los Angeles, but I prefer the Restaurant better. I will try it again using half the cumin and coconut milk rather than heavy cream.

This is one of those dishes that you can't believe came out of your kitchen.  We always double the recipe so there are plenty of leftovers.  My only suggestion is to use Hot Hungarian Paprika instead of sweet paprika.  The flavor is outstanding.  We serve with the Basmati Rice recipe here on allrecipes and naan.

I would have given this 3 1/2 stars.  But everyone else seemed to like it more than I did.  My chicken turned out kind of mushy.  I marinated it overnight instead of just the one hour and I have a feeling that had something to do with it.  I only added a pinch of salt to the marinade and that was it.  Didn't miss it in the least.  I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream.  The taste was fine, but it never seemed to thicken.  I added some plain yogurt to help things along a bit.  But it still never quite got thick enough for my taste.  All in all, I was a tad disappointed considering all of the rave reviews.  But again, the company seemed to really enjoy it.

I made this the other night, and I was surprised at how close it was to what I have eaten in a restaurant and loved so dearly.  I was unable to grill outside because of the weather, so I used the oven and broiler.  I really like my chicken in tiny bite sized pieces and very tender.  The only changes I would make next time would be to pound the chicken thin and marinate for a little longer (maybe 4 hours),  grill or broil the chicken whole rather than in skewers, and cut up after cooking into tiny pieces.  Since we like our food really hot, I will add more hot pepper next time, but I will definitely be making again.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Excellent Chicken Tikka Masala!  I omitted the salt in the sauce, but not the marinade & it was perfect.  A little on the mild side but I suppose that suits most American tastes better.  Only thing that would have made it better is if I had naan to go with it.

I though this was lovely, I would definitely make it again but I didn't follow the recipe as written. I left out the jalapeno peppers from the sauce but added fine minced onion in place of them. I also substituted mild chili powder for the cayenne powder because I don't like very spice food. I didn't have a can of tomato sauce so I used 2 TBS of tomato paste and 8 TBS of water and it came out great.

This was good - and hot!  I omitted salt as others indicated.  I replaced the cumin, cinnamon, cayenne and black pepper in the sauce with 4 tsp Garam Masala.   Marinated the chicken all day.  I also doubled the sauce ingredients, omitted the jalapeno and added 2 tsp garam masala.  I replaced the heavy cream with fat free 1/2 and 1/2 but found I needed to thicken the sauce with a bit of flour.  Served over rice with some garlic nan for dipping.  Better flavors the next day to boot!  Thanks for sharing!

Very good. I used the cookie cooling rack as a grill as suggested by someone here and that worked out perfectly.  I also substituted Garam Masala for cinnamon and that was great.   If you want it less spicy, try using more cream. I accidentally put too much cream in the mix and it was far less spicy. When I put the right amount of cream, it was much spicier. That may be simpler than trying to change the spices.

I followed the directions and took the advice of others, and omitted the salt.  It was fine, but I just had chicken tikka masala at a great Indian restaurant so there was a comparison, and unfortunately there wasn't much to compare.  The sauce tasted too "tomato-y" and I was so worried about the spice level that other reviewers cautioned, that I was too conservative.  I don't think I will make it again, but looks to be a good base to start with.

WOW!! This was the best chicken tikka masala I have ever tasted (after a few tweaks) !! I marinated the chicken overnight, I sauteed the chicken and then used the juices in the sauce. Doubled the sauce and definately used about a quarter of the amount of salt the recipe called for. Served over basmati rice with garlic naan. Thank you for this recipe and all the tips from the reviews helped too!

Better than the Indian Restaurant we have gone to for the same dish. REALLY REALLY great recipe. Be advised...follow the other reviews and reduce the salt. I'd recommend 1 tsp for the marinade and 1 tsp for the sauce. Seriously, that's plenty. Great recipe though!

I am not real familiar with indian food but this is fantastic and easy! I use fat free greek yogurt, and garam masala spice mix, cumin, and a pinch cayenne. I skip the skewers and bake the chicken in the oven. I add two jalapenos and more garlic to the sauce, add more cumin, and use fat free half and half instead of cream (or regular half and half). And definitely cut out most of the salt and add as needed. I tend to taste it as it is cooking and see what needs to be added, although the heat of the peppers tends to increase as the flavors meld and i have definitely made this too spicy even for our fiery tastes (my husband was seriously sweating, but its good for the metabolism!) If it turns out too spicy serve with an extra dollop of sour cream or greek yogurt, and top with cilantro. We serve this over rice with store bought naan bread (i like whole wheat or garlic flavor) that we heat in the oven brushed with olive oil. Yummy, better than any canned sauce you'll buy!

This recipe is amazing! I omitted the salt as other reviewers suggested, and grilled a few vegetables to add to the simmer sauce (red bell peppers, sweet onions, and mushrooms). The yogurt marinade makes the chicken so tender! I served this over basmati rice (I would definitely recommend doubling the tomato and cream sauce if serving with rice) and added Raita on the side (recipe from this site) -- SO GOOD -- and even better the next day. Thanks for sharing!

The chicken really is delish.  I only marinated it for the hour specified and WOW!  I cut the cayenne in half because we aren't a spicy family, and the warmth still lingered.  I K O'd the Jalepeno, too. I used the recommended salt, hoping it would cook out.  I dare say that helped make the chicken so wonderfully tender--- and the cayenne and black pepper I left in overpowered the salt.  Still five stars--- I just finished off the leftovers!

I listened to the reviews on the salt and modified accordingly. I have never made a Chicken Tikka Masala recipe and think this was pretty darn good. Yes, double the sauce so you have enough to soak up the rice. I also added a handful of frozen peas to the sauce YUM!

Delicious!! I did all the recommendations and it turned out great!! This was my first try a Indian food so I was very scared.     I only used 1 tps of salt in marinade and 1/2 tps in sauce. I doubled the sauce and it was all gone by the time we had left overs, I was surprised since it made A LOT. I also use indian masala/garam masala to replace the spices, 5 tps in marinade and 6 in sauce. Soooo good! Dipped naan bread. Mmmm mmm mmm.

WAY TOO SALTY if you follow the recipe! I should have "salted to taste" I guess, but went by the amount in the recipe and WHOA! I then wound up doubling the recipe and it was STILL too salty, so I did half again more of everything else and it then became edible and pretty good, but still pretty salty. I'd say it needs about 1/4 or less the salt recipe calls for. I'm pretty sure it would be fantastic were it not for that issue, so I'm rating it 2 stars.

Absolutely delicious!  I adjusted seasonings and spices to taste, and I used low-fat milk.  I used  chicken thighs and baked them in the oven, as other reviewers had done.  I cannnot imagine it turning out any better. LOVED IT!  
Round 2:  Second time I made this, I added steamed carrots and cauliflower made in bamboo steamer.  This really perfected the recipe.  Also, a swirl of honey at the end added the sweetness it deserves.  HAIKU:  Tikka Masala with Cinnamon and carrots, makes this dish sublime.

This recipe is phenomenal!! I made it the other night with absolutely no modifications. As is, I think it definitely rivaled the chicken tikka masala at my favorite Indian restaurant. I am definitely going to make this again!

This was absolutely amazing!  Our out-of-town guests woke up the next morning still talking about it.  Along the way I was a little scared if it was going to turn out, but the first bite wiped away all my fears.  Everyone loved it, and this will definitely be a staple meal in our house.  The only change I made was using 1/3 of the total salt and substituting chili powder for the cayenne since I didn't have any in stock.  I also made tzatziki sauce to go with this, but ended up forgetting it in the fridge.

It was just ok.  Something is missing from the sauce.  Husband liked it more than me so I gave it 4 stars for him.  Definitely better the 2nd day.

I think I had my hopes set too high expecting this to turn out like our loacal restaurants.  While it is VERY good, it still doesn't hold  candle to the local place.  It's definitely fun to try, but for all that work I think I'll just go enjoy the real McCoy next time :).

I don't know where everyone eats their chicken tikka masala but this is not chicken tikka masala and thats the only reason i'm giving this 3 stars.  This is a good recipe and taste is good but if you are trying to make chicken tikka masala, this is not the recipe.

This recipe was WAY too salty. Also seemed to be missing spice. We chose this one as an alternative to jarred tikka masala sauce and I wish we bought the jar.

Outstanding! Made a few modifications. Used only 1 tsp of salt in both the marinade and the sauce. Increased yogurt to 1.5 cups. Used a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce and instead of heavy cream, substituted half and half.

Like the other reviewers, I played around with some of the spices and omitted almost all the salt. Being without a grill, I cooked the skewered chicken on my Foreman grill; it turned out excellent.

This recipe is incredible!! Cut the amount of salt in half, as others have stated. Great heat, fantastic flavor. I usually make a double batch of sauce because it is so good. Serve on top of a pile of rice - YUM. You will not be disappointed.

I believe in rating recipes as written. With that in mind, found this recipe way to spicy and way too salty even reduced the cayenne pepper by 50% and it was still too peppery. I put 3 tsp of salt in the marinade, instead of 4, in case the salt was needed as part of the marination process. I put only 2 of 3 in the sauce because it seemed like too much. It was still WAY too salty.   I have has some really good and really bad chicken tikka masala at restaurants, and it was never this spicy.  The consistency and flavor otherwise pretty good, though. I will make this agan, probably, but will cut the black pepper to 1 tsp, cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp, and omit the salt, at least from the sauce, altogether.

Although it requires a lot of ingredients (and lots fo time and dishes, too!), this is a very nice tikka masala.  The balance of flavors is wonderful, especially when paired with raita and a nice glass of riesling.  That said, be careful that you don't overdo the salt!  I did that in two ways: I used kosher salt (I just grabbed whichever bottle of salt was closest -- first mistake), and then I let the sauce reduce by simmering it too long as I prepared other dishes for dinner.  Make sure you follow the directions and taste as you go, and you'll enjoy a dish that rivals any Indian restaurant I've visited.

Quite good served with garlic naan.  Next time I will definitely reduce the salt as it was too salty and the salt almost overpowered the other spices.  I also diced the chicken smaller than recommended, then tossed all of the chicken and marinade into a frying pan on medium heat for 6-8 minutes.  Then I drained off all the remaining liquid, put the chicken back in the frying pan with a bit of oil and pan-fried it for a few minutes.

This dish was great, I gave it four stars not five because I found the spice to be just a little on overwhelming part.  I added about 1/2 c milk in addition to the cream it called for to make it more creamy and help cut the spice.  I did use pork and not chicken, maybe that was the difference.

I was making a different curry to compliment my rice so I just made the chicken part of this recipe. OH MY GOSH was it good! I halved the salt (I like salt), and substituted garam masalsa for the cayenne (my family doesn't like spicy-hot). It was perfect, juicy, and extremely delicious!

One of my favorite recipes to make! I let the chicken marinate overnight, and cut down the salt to 1 tsp for the marinade and 1 tsp for the masala sauce. I add a few teaspons of fresh garam masala, I like a more potent sauce. I will also add a couple teaspoons of amchur (mango powder). I omit the jalapeno and paprika, and use 1/2 tsp ground red chili. I don't have a grill, so I put the the oven on broil and put the chicken breasts directly on an oven rack, wiping off most of the marinade beforehand. Cook  6 min each side,  with a tray underneath to catch the drips. Using half n half comes close to the flavor of full cream. If sauce isn't thick enough, throw in a quarter cup of finely ground cashews. Excellent with the Naan and Chole recipe on this site.

Delicious dish.  This was my first experiment with Indian food and it turned out perfectly.  I read the reviews before I made the dish.  As others suggested, I doubled the sauce recipe, used garam masala instead of cinnamon, and used salt only to taste.  When I prepared the chicken for the marinade, I dusted all of the pieces with additional cumin, salt and pepper, and garam masala before adding to the yogurt mixture.  I also baked the chicken in the oven after swirling each piece of chicken in the marinade to gather as much of it onto every piece that I could.  I only had time to marinate for one hour, and it was excellent. I omitted the ginger, cinnamon, and jalapeno.  I served this with rice and it was hard for us to stop eating it!  I love it when I experiment with recipes that are easy, delicious, and make me feel like an expert chef.  Thank you so much Yakuta.

SO. Good.  I'm stuffed but I still want more.  My mouth watered as I read through the recipe and reviews, and the real deal did not disappoint!  I followed several others in only adding 1 tsp salt in the marinade and 1 tsp in the sauce.  I didn't have paprika for the sauce (oops), but I just substituted 1/2 tsp cayenne and 1/2 tsp chili powder.  Leave out the jalapeno!  It was plenty spicy without, and I'm the kind of person who doesn't mind some make-ya-sweat spice.  I didn't want to fire up the grill, so I used a George Foreman grill, leaving it open as the chicken cooked, and still flipping over after 5 or so minutes.  Chicken turned out delicious!  Mixed so well with the sauce.  Served with white rice (instant white rice + a couple tbs dried basil).  Only wish I had the patience to bake some naan as well!  Maybe next time.  And there WILL be a next time.  Yum.

i left out all but one tsp salt in the entire recipe, used only half of the jalapeno pepper, and halved the pepper. i also saute the chicken in the marinade on the stove, rather than throwing the marinate out, and grilling. the chicken comes out so tender and the sauce is amazing when combined with the ingredients in the second half. ive made this recipe already two times in the last 10 days! its excellent!

This recipe is great.  I cut back on the salt and used half and half instead of heavy cream.  I used 1/2 a jalapeno and it was perfect for our taste, spicy but not too spicy.  My hubby was impressed!

For my first "indian" dish, this turned out great! I did use LIGHT Coconut Milk instead of heavy cream, though.

When my husband says "You can make this again!" and cleans his plate, it's a keeper!!  Exchanged the heavy cream for 6 ounces of coconut milk, that was the only change.  The freshness of your spices is paramount to making this dish come out well.

This masala sauce is so good! I did make a few changes because I used what I had on hand, half and half and tomato soup replaced heavy and sauce...the texture was so yummy! also, I like a little less heat so I omitted the pepper and the salt per other submissions...Thanks we will make it again!

We made this tonight for dinner. It was not as labor intensive as I had feared. I did listen to other reviewers and left out the salt altogether (actually, I also left out the ginger too). It was absolutely fantastic! I think this dish was better than most I've had in Indian restaurants.

I like this recipe - I made it after I read other reviews so I did make modifications: (1) I omitted the salt except for a dash towards the end; (2) I substituted garam masala for some of the cumin and cayenne pepper; (3) I reduced the cayenne pepper just a touch, though I do like my food spicy; (4) I upped the amount of tomato sauce towards the end.  My grilling was a little messy but I'm not a skilled griller.    I feel like there's a lot of potential in this recipe.  I've never made chicken tikki masala before and this was a good first try for me.  I feel like with a little more tweaking the next time around, I can make this recipe better.  I just need to think about how else to get that restaurant tikki masala flavor.

Delish- didn't add salt as suggested. Thanks so much for the recipe! We'll make this again for sure!! UPDATE-I've made this many times now and wanted to share a small addition I've made - I add 1 tbsp of coriander chutney to the sauce while it simmers- this puts it over the edge- I make this once a week and always by request from the family!

TOO MUCH SALT!    I made this recipe before reading the reviews.  the marinade for the chicken asks for 4 teaspoons of salt - this is way, way, way too much.  next time, i will only use ONE teaspoon of salt.    the sauce asks for 3 teaspoons of salt, which is so over-powering - my sauce was ruined.  i ended up having to run to the store for more cream & tomato sauce.  the 2nd time around, i sauted the garlic & jalapenos in UNSALTED butter, added all the spices EXCEPT THE SALT, added the cream and added salt-free tomato sauce.  only after everything was mixed and cooking down, did i add salt, and i only ended up adding about 1 teaspoon.  My sauce was so much better the 2nd time around, with using just a tad bit of salt.    I will definitely make this again.  It was really good.  The leftovers were great.  It has just enough heat to make it interesting.  The sauce is so good.  The marinade made my mouth water.  Super great recipe - just be really careful with the salt!

Followed others recommendations about cutting salt, 1/2 tsp in marinade and 1/2 tsp in sauce. Replaced cinnamon with Garam Masala and replaced heavy cream with full fat plain yogurt. Sauce separated and curdled even though yogurt never came to boil! Looked awful but tasted very good. Broiled marinade-covered chicken pieces for 3 min per side and then put into the sauce. Will try this recipe again but might try to find a way to keep yogurt from curdling!

Great flavor, my husband kept asking if it took me very long to make...meaning, if it didn't take too long to make, please make it again!  I certainly will, I used 1/2 tsp salt for marinade and sauce, definitely double the sauce and served over brown rice, otherwise made per the recipe, thanks!

OMIT THE SALT is all I can say.  I am a major salt lover on everything, but this dish was out of control salty.  I was so disappointed that after all that work, I was only able to eat a few bites and then had to throw it out.  Disgusting.  I didn't read the reviews first before I made it and I wish I did b/c almost everyone mentions the salt problem.  Also, my husband and I like heat, but I may take that down a bit next time and make it tow where each person could spice their own.

I loved the unique flavor of this. The sauce was VERY nice. Paired well with a saute'd medley of yellow squash, red onion and zuchinni, plain brown rice and a green salad w/ a vinegar & oil dressing.

Other than curry, I thought I wasn't a fan of Indian food...until I made this last night.  I wish I would have read the reviews beforehand and added some garam masala since I actually had some with my spices.  I warmed up flour tortillas from Central Market (the best!) and gobbled it up :P

I am absolutely impressed. I am a beginner cooker and this recipe was delicious. I did take out most of the salt and added to taste. I don't like too much spice so i took out the cayenne pepper and the jalepeno pepper. The black pepper gave it a slight kick.

Being a self proclaimed Indian food critic/fanatic i had to try this. The only changes I make are cutting back on the salt and cutting back slightly on the spicy spices. Really yummy!

The first time I made this, I halved the salt and it was still WAY too salty.  I think I got it on the 2nd try... very good, very authentic.

This is a badly-written, but very tasty recipe. Unfortunately, my husband cooked the night we made it, and he put in the exact amount of salt the recipe calls for, instead of using his own judgment. The result was something far, far too salty, although if the salt had been cut way back it would have been delicious. We may make this recipe again, but we will cut the salt by at least half, and probably more like 75%.

This was one of the better Indian dishes that I've made. For the marinade, I used 1/2 the cayenne pepper, and 1/3 of the salt. For the sauce, I made the recipe exactly, minus the salt. I also made extra sauce for the amount of meat I prepared, but probably didn't need that much extra sauce.

So good! We cut down on the salt significantly the first time and next time we will omit the salt altogether. Lots of reviews said this recipe is too spicy, but I think it's fine. We were kind of cautious because of all these reviews saying it's spicy, so we cut the Cayenne to 1.5 Tsp instead of 2 and slliiiightly less paprika. It was spicy but nothing terrible. I'd call it a "medium" at any Indian restaurant. Next time I will use the full amount stated in the recipe because I like the heat!

I found this exact same recipe years ago on allcooks.com.... anyways, it is absolutely my favorite recipe for Indian food. You cannot go wrong with it! (I agree, though, as written it is too much salt - I actually just don't add any and it works fine). Make sure you eat it with some warm naan!

Unedible!  This was too salty and overspiced.  My wife and I could not eat it.  A lot of the reviews say take out the salt and I wish I would have seen them but the idea here is to follow the recipe shown on the website, is it not?  PLEASE for everyone's sake, take out the salt on your website recipe.  This was just wrong.  I spent 3 hours preparing this and we could not eat it.  Very disappointing.

Excellent recipe! This is one of the best things I have ever made.  I have made dozens of recipes off of allrecipes.com but this is the first one that I felt compelled to review. Great authentic taste.  I made a few changes(although the original recipe should taste good as is).  To save on calories and fat, I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2-this did not take away from the thickness of the curry.  I also doubled the sauce recipe, so I had lots left over to pour over the rice.  I didn't have an outdoor grill available-so as another reviewer suggested I created a makeshift grill by placing a cookie rack over a cookie sheet and broiling the chicken on high(5 minutes on each side).  Highly recommend this one! Also, as other reviewers have said-omit the extra salt-it is not needed

HOLY SALT BATMAN! So I read the reviews about a week before I made this recipe and completely forgot all the for warnings! I even lowered the salt for the marinade and sauce bc I thought 3 teaspoons no way! but even still it was out of control salty! But I am in no way dissing the recipe bc I am sure that once you use about a forth of the salt listed it will be AMAZING! Very very good classic Indian recipe!

I introduced the man to Indian food, and now he craves tikka masala all the time.  Thought we would try making our own and  this was amazingly delicious. Made it on a weekend day when the kids weren't here.  A little work, but worth it.  Heed the salt warnings, though!  I used 1t salt in the marinade, and none in the sauce, and reduced the cumin just a bit because it can overwhelm other flavors so easily.  The man did the grilling while I made the sauce on the stovetop, some rice, and peas.  Earlier, when making the marinade, i made cucumber raita from this site-- a must!!  Oh, I also reduced the cayenne by half.  Next time I will double this recipe by the man's request. Next time we have guests, we will serve this!

WAY, WAY, WAYYYYYYYYYYY too much salt. I had to add two more cans of tomato sauce and more milk just to make it barely edible, and even so it left me dehydrated bite after bite. One star for the marinade for the chicken, that was good stuff. But oh my god, use 1/8 of the salt....

This is the basis for a really fabulous chicken tikka recipe, with a few modifications: first, cut out most of the salt.  Try 1/2 tsp salt in both places where salt is required (not 3 or 4 tsp as the recipe suggests), and cut the cayenne in half for a less spicy, more universally-pleasing sauce.  Then, I would suggest doubling the quantity of the sauce.  If you want plenty of sauce to go with rice or naan, you'll need to double the recipe, otherwise you'll just have enough to coat the meat.  If you make more sauce, everyone is more satisfied with less meat per portion. Otherwise, outstanding recipe and just the right combination of spices.

I'm not sure what we did wrong, but somehow our sauce turned out terrible.  It tasted like enchilada sauce, so we figured it was a mistake with the jalapenos.  The chicken, however, was amazing.  We ended up eating it right off the skewers, sans sauce.  Will try this recipe again to find out what I did wrong, and re-rate as needed.

Definitely cut the salt way down (I used maybe a teaspoon in each part of the recipe), but do try this. It has a really nice mellow heat, but I did seed the jalapeno. The flavor is complex and deep, like Indian food should be.

This was incredible. I took the advice of the other reviewers and cut back on the salt. I actually cut the salt called for by 1/3. Followed all of the other instructions exactly and it turned out perfectly! We had absolutely no leftovers. Will definitely make again!

Relatively easy recipe. I marinated the meat for 6 hours instead of 1 hour, greatly reduced the salt, and pan-fried the chicken.  It turned out quite good and my husband was impressed (I don't cook very much at all!).

Hubby deemed this a four star recipe. I followed the advice of others and made the following changes. For the chicken marinade I only added 1 1/2 tsp of salt and added only a dash of Cayenne (about 1/2 tsp). For judging how much ginger to buy, I usually look for a piece about the size of my thumb.For the sauce I added only 1 tsp of salt. When cooking the chicken in the oven,I soak some skewers and line a baking sheet with tin foil and place a cookie cooling rack on top. I broil the chicken skewers on high and watched closely, turning until slightly brown (about 7 minutes a side).

This turned out soooo well! I've had it in Indian restaurants and this recipe rivals those. I took other suggestions but ommitting the salt and only adding it to taste. In the marinade I used 1 tsp. cayenne pepper and 1 tsp. garam masala. I used half the jalapeno and added a small onion to the sauce as well as using fat free half & half. It was soooo good, I got a million compliments. Amazing!!!

Absolutely delicious.  Made as is (minus the salt - doesn't need any at all) except that since I don't have a grill, I used my Foreman for the chicken.  I served on rice and naan.  I like to mix the sauce, chicken, and rice on my plate and then pile it on my naan and wrap the naan up and eat it that way.  It was a medium on the spicy scale, which is perfect for me.  Enough to give a bite to the dish but not too much that it overpowers any other flavors.
***UPDATE*** Currently I bake the chicken in the oven at 400F for ~20 min to cook.  Use 3 cloves garlic.  As I've become lactose intolerant recently I needed to decrease the lactose content in the sauce.  Whole fat yogurt with active live cultures is virtually lactose free (whole fat dairy has lower lactose levels and the cultures produce a lactase that digests it) so instead of the heavy cream I use 3/4 cup whole fat yogurt and 1/4 cup soy milk.  Still don't use salt and no longer use jalepeno.  Add about a cup of frozen peas into it when I add the meat to the sauce to give some veggies to it.  I hate the taste of peas but the sauce overpowers them so it's a good way to hide them in my meal.

This was delicious and very easy to make.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  The only modification I made was to the salt - I halved the salt amounts.

My family's new favorite! I double the sauce recipe and use 6 chicken breasts. Also I thin the chicken into uniform fillets and cut into chunks after cooking to keep in moisture and make turning easier. Serve with Jasmine rice and Hummus III recipe. My husband said," Don't cook this again because I can't control myself from over eating it". My teenage sons love it too.

SURPRISINGLY GOOD!!! I was not in the mood for the normal chicken and this recipe hit the spot. The only modifications I did was using a dash of salt and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. Also, I cooked the chicken on the stove because I didn't want to take the grill out.

I gave this a 5 but you MUST adjust the salt to be MUCH LESS! My son who is a new cook now makes this as a family favorite and adds a bit more garlic and less cayenne. It is now a regular meal of ours and just delicious! Can also make it ahead of time and reheat for a party buffet dish.

As others have pointed out, this is a 5-star recipe but only after adjusting the amounts of spices. For the marinade, I used only 1 tsp each of the cumin, salt and cayenne, and for the seasoning, only 1 tsp each of cumin and salt (even 1/2 tsp salt would be fine). I used 18% cream ("Coffee Cream" in Canada) instead of heavy cream, and for the garnish, I used sliced green onion greens because I didn't have cilantro. I cut out the time required to skewer, and just cooked the chicken in a deep frying pan on med-high for 10, discarding the excess marinade. The recipe here for the sauce makes just enough for 4 servings. Serve over Basmati rice, with naan bread as a side.

Weird!  I've always had Tikka Masala with tomatoes and cream and it is slightly sweet and delicious.  This was plain SALT.  Edit the salt amount and you might like it.  I added 1 can of diced tomatoes...and it was better.  It also needs coriander.

I make this recipe about once a week.  I marinate the chicken overnight.  I omit all the salt as per the recommendation of other reviewers.  I replaced the japleno pepper with 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper.  To thicken the sauce I saute 1/2 an onion in the butter until translucent before adding the spices.  I have found that this recipe tastes better after it has been in the fridge overnight.

I would have given it a 5 if it weren't for the changes.  I followed other's advice and decreased the salt; 1 tsp in the marinade and 1/2tsp in the sauce.  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts, used olive oil to sautee the spices for the sauce, and used a mixture of 1/2 cup greek yogurt(non-fat) and 1/2 cup half and half for the sauce.  Next time I would use the full cup of greek yogurt and omit the half and half and the sauce would still be rich enough.  Absolutely delicious!!!  I will be making this often.

Wow!  I never knew I could cook like that!  I followed others' suggestions and cut the salt back to 1 teaspoon for both the marinade and the sauce.  It was still a little salty for my taste, so I will reduce it further the next time I make this, which will be soon!  I did have some trouble with the skewers sticking to the grill grate, so be sure to thoroughly oil your grills first.  I also used half and half instead of heavy cream because I had the half and half lying around anyway.  I used more cayenne pepper instead of the jalapeno in the sauce, too.  Still, this had just the right amount of heat and was absolutely delicious.  Thanks for a keeper!

I spent 4 hours heating up the tandoor to make the chicken, spent the whole afternoon on the dish overall.  My wife and I finally sat down to dinner that night and...WAY too much salt!  A wasted day.

Very yummy! I love spicy foods but did find this a little hard to handle (my ears were burning mid-way through!) I only added 1 total tsp of salt after reading reviews, and likely will halve some of the spicy spices next time I make it. Very different/fun/delish dinner though!

If you are a big fan of spicy foods, do not listen to the reviews that say this dish is too spicy and use less spice. We actually added another jalapeno pepper and thought that it was the perfect amount of heat. Based on reading some other reviews on here, we followed the suggestions of using less salt. We only included a 1/2 teaspoon of salt in the marinade and found that to be adequate. We could not imagine having a total of 7 teaspoons of salt in the dish! We also added 2 teaspoons of garam masala in the marinade based on the suggestions of others. This recipe will definitely be added to our rotation.

I cook six nights a week. Needless to say, I'm no professional cook, but I do very well with any recipe. For anyone who actually appreciates Indian food, this recipe is a travesty. Too much salt, jalepenos; pathetic. I did not care for this recipe. I had some nice rice I made with Cumin Seeds. First time in ages that  I'm quite disappointed. LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR GOOD INDIAN FOOD!!!

With some tweaking this turned out fantastic, but I wouldn't recommend making this as written. As many others have noted, the amount of salt called for is ridiculous. I would also marinate for way longer than an hour (I did mine for 24 hours).

Excellent!  Quite spicy but we love the kick!
Reduced the salt and substituted a can of evaporated milk for the heavy cream for a healthier recipe.  It was great - definitely do not need to use heavy cream if you're watching your health.

Awesome flavor!  I don't thread the chicken on to skewers...I just panfry each piece, then cook them in the sauce.  Over rice, this is a tasty and elegant meal!

This recipe was great!  My fiance and I both love Indian food, the chicken tikka masala is my favorite at our local Indian restaurant so I tried out this recipe and we both loved it.  I omitted some salt and next time will be omitting all salt except in the sauce to taste.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was really, really, really good. I paid heed to the previous reviewers suggestions - cut the salt way down, spiced according to my preference, and broiled the chicken in the oven. I was very satisfied with the results and will make this again.

This is one of my all time favorite recipes and I prepare it at least once a month!  As stated in other reviews, omit all the salt listed (Would have given this recipe 5 stars but 7 teaspoons of salt is insane!)I substitute the cumin and paprika in the sauce with 3 tablespoons Garam Masala. Also the chicken can easily be replaced with extra-firm tofu. To make the recipe easier to prepare I baked the meat (tofu or chicken) in the oven for 1 hour at 400F instead of grilling it. This restaurant quality!

My husband, who is from India, loved this recipe except for the amount of salt. It was very easy to prepare, but I recommend only using 1 tsp. of salt in the marinade and none at all in the sauce. This would make it an authentic Indian recipe!

This tastes exactly like what you get in a good indian restaurant. For the people who said it was too spicy, I have a few suggestions. Make sure you take out the seeds of the jalepano pepper. Try to cut the amount of the cayenne pepper too. Also I had extra plain yogurt. Save it and top the chicken at teh end with it to cool down the spice.

I've never had Tikka Masala before, so I can't compare this recipe to what it is "supposed" to be. All I know is it is absolutely delicious. I've made this several times now, and yes of course don't add anywere near the amount of salt. I'm not deducting a star for that because it does say "or to taste." I use half-n-half instead of heavy cream since I thought the heavy cream made it too rich. I like heat so I usually add at least 1 other jalapeno to the sauce. That combo of dried cayenne in the marinate and fresh pepper in the sauce is nice. So far I've only broiled the chicken and it comes out wonderful that way. Oh, and serve with Jasmine rice, my favorite with this. Nummmm.

I drastically reduced the salt as suggested. I also replaced the cinnamon, ginger and paprika with (almost equal) garam masala. I also let the chicken marinate overnight instead of an hour. Turned out wonderful.

This recipe was amazing. I have tried many Indian recipes and this is one of the best! I made a few changes to make the recipe vegetarian and dairy-free and it still turned out perfectly. 1. As other reviewers noted, I decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp. for the marinade and 1/2 tsp. for the sauce. 2. Substituted coconut milk (regular, not light version) for heavy cream 
3. Used "chicken style seitan" instead of real chicken. 4. As suggested by others, I baked the "chicken" instead of grilling since I ran out of propane for grill. Next time I think I might try grilling just to see if the taste is much different. 5. Added about 2 cups of fresh, chopped spinach at the same time as the "chicken". Excellent recipe! Pretty easy too.

Excellent dish!  This is my favorite way to enjoy Chicken Tikka Masala - spicy and not too sweet.  The thing is, typically at Indian restaurants, you get to choose your spicy level, and this one would rate pretty high on the spicy scale...with the whole jalapeno and all!  As I said, that's just how I like it, but I had to add extra cream, lemon juice, and cinnamon to take some of the spice out for my boyfriend.  I salted to taste at the end.  Thanks to the advice of all the previous reviewers!  Oh, yeah, make sure you put this over rice!

this was delicious!  I should have listened to others who said to omit the salt in the sauce but i will certainly make it again.  I think this will make a wonderful dinner for a dinner party. I made it with spinach salad and cous cous and it was perfect!

Made the recipe reducing the amount of salt to enough to taste and substituting the heavy cream for 2% evaporated milk.  It turned out delicious.  Next time we will also try to marinade the chicken for a little longer in the yogurt/spice mix.  We served the chicken with couscous.  This is definitely a keeper!

I have been using this recipe for several years now, and the only thing I modify is the salt (cut in half) and the jalepeno (I rarely have them on hand, so I just saute a good amount of cayenne pepper with the butter and garlic). I have also used sour cream in the recipe, with great results.

This recipe was delicious after a few modifications.
1. I decreased cayenne pepper in the marinade and jalapeno in the sauce because I can't eat really spicy food
2. I didn't follow the recipe's listed amount of salt. I just added it to my liking.
3. I marinated the meat for about 3 hours and broiled it in my oven.
4. I doubled the sauce.
I served this on a bed of white rice, topped with sauteed julienned orange/green bell peppers, onions sliced into rings, and cubed zucchini. I have some left over- I can't wait to eat it for lunch tomorrow!

Wow, very very good. However, I dd have to tweak this a little bit. I omited the cumin and cinnamon, and used tandoori seasoning for the chicken marinade instead. Also, while I was cooking the sauce, I tasted it, and it had too much of a tomato flavor, so i added garam masala, korma seasoning, and more tandoori powder to give it more of an Indian taste. Finally, instead of using whole milk, I used half regular milk, and the other half coconut milk to give it a really nice flavor, texture, as well as aroma. Finally, I didn't garnished with cliantro, but stirred it in the last few minuets of cooking, I think it brings out the flavor a lot better that way. Finally, served with naan, and it was wonderful! Will definatly make this again!

This is my favorite dish to get at an Indian Restaurant. I've tried making it from spice packs and jars but it was never right. THIS WAS PERFECT and so Easy! I also reduced the salt as suggested by others to 1 tsp for the marinade and 1 tsp for the sauce and I served it over basmatti rice; the only thing missing was Naan Bread. Delicious! The first time I made this, I didn't feel like grilling the chicken so I cooked it in the pan with the sauce; the second time I grilled the chicken on my George Foreman, big improvement in the flavor of the chicken - definitely grill it! Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is the real deal.  If you are not keen to spicy food, use regular bell peppers insted of jalapeno.  I did and it matched perfectly with the chicken.

I made this for my husband and made Chicken Korma for myself. My husband LOVED this recipe. It is much too spicy for me but he said it was excellent. I would definitely cut the Cayenne pepper in half if you don't like spicy but if you are making it for someone who loves spicy, this is a good one. One tip: instead of grilling the chicken, I put it in the broiler for about the same amount of time and instructions. It turned out as good as I had hoped. My husband flipped over it!

Without modifications, this recipe is likely too spicy/hot for many people, especially those who don't eat a lot of spicy foods. If you don't like spices, or are not sure, I'd suggest omitting the jalapeno peppers and using less garam masala. If, on the other hand, you are a spicy food lover like me, don't reduce anything except for the salt (I cut it out altogether). I added more garam masala too.

I didn't read the reviews earlier, and I wish I had! This was horrible-- way, way, way too much salt. I spent 2 hours making it and when I tasted, I only tasted salt-- nothing else! My husband and I hated it so much, we threw it all away and ordered pizza instead. What a disappointment! It smells and looks great, but the taste makes you gag.

First of all, I am a chicken tikka masala fanatic, and I love this recipe.  Just made it for the 2nd or 3rd time last night and it was fabulous.  I'm also a SALT fanatic.  I LOVE salt - however, if you follow this recipe to the T, it's too salty even for me.  I about 1/2ed the salt content and it was probably still a bit too much.  Go easy on the salt and whomever you're serving can add some if they like.

Yes yes of course, salt to taste. I added  a dash of madras curry powder, turmeric powder and garam masala to the marinade and the sauce mixture ( I also added one bay leaf to the sauce). Used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream (I'd rather use coconut milk for a subsitute next time) and I really recommend to omit the jalapeno pepper for people who can't stand spicy food.  Overall though, it's good.

This was the first curry recipe I've ever tried to make and it turned out great. After reading the reviews here, I decided to leave out all of the salt. I also used low-fat yogurt and half-and-half instead of cream. Yummy.

I thought the recipe had way too much cumin in it.  Other than that it was decent.  It's hard to say because the cumin was so overpowering.  I might make it again with no salt and less cumin.

This is soooooo good.I totally agree with the reviews on the salt. I love salt and I added NO salt in the entire dish. I t seemed perfect without any. For the marinade I also added minced garlic and cilantro. For the sauce i doubled the tomato sauce and cream (used 1 cup whipping cream and 1 cup of coconut milk). I love onions so I sauteed onions with the garlic and jalepenos. Served with basmatti rice and naan. Sooooo great!

Very tasty! I cut out most of the salt as other suggested, only used a couple of pinches of kosher salt in the marinade and maybe a pinch in the sauce. I also doubled the sauce. I used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne in the marinade and used only half a jalapeno (despite doubling everything else) in the sauce...still medium-spicy, so if you don't like heat you can cut it out altogether. For the 2 c. cream component I instead used a cup of half and half and a cup of lite coconut milk. Also, I didn't want to bother with the grill so I just sauteed the chicken in batches while the sauce simmered, and as a bonus added the pan scrapings (from the marinade) to the sauce while it simmered. Great over jasmine rice!

This recipe was awesome!  I 
definitely cut the salt in half just as recommended by other reviews.  Also, if you don't like too much spice (like me) add less cayenne pepper and jalapeno.

This was really great in my book -- per other reviewers I cut the salt by half and also decreased the cumin in the cream sauce. As modified no one flavor dominated and it had a nice kick. Unfortunately too spicy for my family, but when seasoned to taste still a definite keeper. Served with broccoli -- would also be great with spinach added into chicken and sauce.

AWESOME! Tasted just like the Chicken Tikki Masala from my favorite restaurant Bombay House. YUM! It was pretty spicy and I only used 1/2 of a jalepeno. I also cut the salt in half for the first time I needed to add it and just added a dash for the second addition. My husband and I were drooling over this recipe. The marinated chicken is also really good even if you don't put it in the cream sauce (although the sauce is the best part!)

Like others I wish I had read the reviews first.  I would recommend only adding a little salt to taste in the end.  I used half the ceyenne and it was plenty hot for us.  I also added about 1 T. sugar to the sauce and one green onion too.  Would probably be better with less cumin too.  Very easy to make and a great dish!

This was a good base of a recipe, but I found the spices to be a bit off - I've cooked lots of Indian food and have never used paprika or black pepper before.  We added a lot more ground red pepper and a good amount of garam masala, too.  Again, not a bad base recipe if you are going to add to it, but not a strong Indian recipe by itself.

I found that the combination of cumin and tomato sauce added a peculiar flavor to the dish which made it taste quite different from the chicken tikka masala found in restaurants. I would recommend, reducing the amount of cumin used to about a teaspoon, maybe adding a little garam masala to the sauce prep, and using whole fresh tomatoes with water rather than tomato sauce.

This was excellent, but doesn't taste like the tikka masala I get at my favorite Indian restaurant. Not too surprising since it doesn't include many Indian spices (garam masala in particular). It's really super for what it is, though, esp if you don't have special Indian spices on hand.

Excellent! You must try this! I used only 1 teaspoon of salt in the marinade and the same amount in the sauce and didn't miss it. I also cut the cayenne in the marinade to 1 teaspoon and found this was good if you want a little zing but still want to taste your food. Also as others had recommended I did not double the marinade and used 5 chicken breasts and still had plenty. I doubled the sauce and found this was about right for the amount of chicken. I made 6 cups of Uncle Ben's rice, and even my 3 teenagers loved this. Next time I'll make it with basmati rice!!!

This is SO good - the chicken is super flavorful. I actually let mine marinate for a few hours and then just grilled it on the foreman - delicious!  Used half/half instead of heavy cream and nonfat yogurt from trader joes and crushed red pepper instead of cayenne... perfect - will definitely make it again.

Recipe was excellent!!! It was way way way TOO MUCH SALT. I am an idiot and should have realized that before making it that way. I used a little more chicken than it called for and less jalapeno so Erin (my lovely wife) could eat it.  But I could imagine what it would taste like minus the salt.  It's a perfect way to get my chicken tikka masala fix without dining out.  Now I wish there was an easy naan recipe.

I really enjoyed this dish, but my boyfriend thought it had too many spices and it was too spicy. I don't usually like spicy food but I really liked this. I will make it again. But I may not use so much cayenne pepper next time. Also only use 1 teaspoon of salt in the whole dish! You'll understand when you make it. I used 2 teaspoons, one in each mixture and it was still too salty. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! I'm no expert in Indian cuisine, but this was my favorite meal in college. No good Indian restaurants around here, so this is a great find. And it tastes a lot like I remember it. 

I made some changes however: I substituted unsweetened fat free condensed milk for the heavy cream and cut the fat WAY down. Then I haqd to add a little cornstarch to thinken it up. I also threw in a handful of white rasins like my old restaurant did. 

I also omitted the second instance of salt and it was still quite salty from the meat. Next time I will cut that part in half and add some to the sauce at the end if need be.

Overall - great recipe!

This was a GREAT recipe. Better than a restaurants version. I followed the other peoples suggestions and used only 2 tsp. I can't imagine how salty it would have been otherwise. I baked the chicken instead of grilled and forgot to put in the cloves and it was still wonderfully delicious. Now I need a good recipe for naan.

One of the best meals from the site yet!  We kept it healthy and used 1 C FF half and half and it was still delicious.  Added two tsp of garam masala to the sauce.  Reduced the cumin and cayenne to 1 tsp. Eliminated the jalepeno and used 1/4 C green pepper finely chopped as another reviewer suggested. Not everyone in the family could take the spice otherwise.  Can't wait to have the leftovers over rice!  Served with Raita. (recipe on this site) Thanks!

Horrible!  This recipe called for so much salt that we ended up not even eating it.  Be careful about how much salt you add, I suggest you add about a quarter of what the recipe calls for.

my husband loved this recipe!
I followed the advice of others and added salt only to taste. I forgot yogurt when I shopped, so I used fat free sour cream-  (next time will use yogurt to compare).  also, used fat free half and half in place of heavy cream- both changes worked out great.
added mushrooms, red pepper and onion when prepared sauce- was just like at the restaurant!

This is an excellent meal. The spices, esp the cinnamon and ginger, add such dimension to the dish. I made it for my boyfriend. He did nothing but rave about how it was one of the BEST things he'd ever tasted. Serve it with Jasmine rice for a great compliment to the sauce.

I just made this recipe for the first time for my family. They have requested that it be a new Christmas tradition. I think that says it all. 

The directions were easy to follow and the finished product was better than expected.

YUM! I recently tried this dish for the first time at a local Indian restaurant. I liked it so much I wanted to find out how to make it for myself. While this wasn't an exact replica, it was very close. I cut my chicken breasts in half, and after marinading them I cooked them on my George Foreman grill, then cut them into bite-size chunks. This worked well. Very good. I doubled the sauce (but not the chicken), which turned out to be a bit too much for just the two of us. Served on rice.

Simply divine! This recipe did call for alot of salt. I used 3 tsp of salt in the whole recipe instead of 7tsp! 
I also only used 1 tsp of paprika and 1 tsp of cayenne to dumb down the heat (I was making it for my parents....)
TWO THUMBS UP!

This dish would have been amazing if it didn't call for an entire 50 pound block of salt; the kind range animals gather to lick.  DO NOT follow the instructions when it mentions adding salt.  Instead, use just a few shakes or pinches.  Remember, a few pinches - Delicious.  7 teaspoons of salt! - Hello high blood pressure.  Read the nurtitional info: 4567 mg of sodium!!  I am writing this while still on my sodium buzz!  Wooo-hoooo!  Happy cooking!

I really wanted to make chicken tikka masala, just like the restaurants do.  I'm a cooking novice, and this recipe was fabulous.  The marinating step really worked; all of my friends could really taste the seasonings in the chicken itself.  I used a George Foreman grill for the chicken, and it sealed the flavor in.  The sauce was also so easy to make.  Gathering the spices for this recipe was a hassle, but the recipe itself was very easy and delicious.

This was great!  Though it is an odd combination of spices, the flavors work together wonderfully.  We've made it several times in the last couple of weeks, and no one is getting tired of it.  Definately a hit... and for a family who had never had any sort of homemade Indian food, that says a lot.

I read everyone's reviews and therefore only added salt (a few dashes) to the sauce, and also only used 1 tsp. cayenne and 1 tsp. cumin. I used half and half instead of heavy cream.
Although this recipe tasted nothing like what I get in restaurants, my family really liked it.  Next time I would reduce the cumin a bit more, and I'd probably go ahead and use the heavy cream for a richer taste.  For some reason, there was not enough sauce!  I'd probably either use only 2/3 the recommended chicken or I would double the amount of sauce.  Also, grilling 10 minutes per side was too long.  I'd grill 8 minutes per side.  But like I said, they liked it well enough and ate it all up!

This is a GREAT Recipe! Very easy to make. The only thing I changed was the amount of salt. I used less than half and that was quite enough.

Just like the other folks to review this one... Its too salty. I used half, and it was too much. Salt to taste!

Beyond being a salty, this seems to be a very nice recipe. I threw in a half tsp of chili powder to bring the heat.

This is my husband's favorite Indian dish so I thought I'd give it a shot at making it at home. This recipe was near exact, if not better, than the tikka masala at our favorite restaurant!

I did my best to stay as true to the recipe as possible while also following some highly recommended alterations in the reviews, such as halving the cayenne and only using pinches of salt as I went instead of dumping whole teaspoons into the marinade and sauce. I also added garam masala in both the marinade and sauce. Served with jasmine rice and it was perfect! The only downside was there wasn't enough of it! I highly recommend doubling or even tripling the recipe if you plan on feeding more than 2 people.

This recipe was written sloppily. Had to double check measurements because how it was written and what is reflected in the measurements within the ingredients list differed. On top of that, the salt level verges on toxic. The “3 tsp” has got to be a typo. We had to throw the meal away before it hit the plate, complete waste of food. THAT SAID, it smelled so good and the potential was there, so we tried again a couple of days later and only did a dash of salt in the yogurt mix and 1 tsp in the sauce — EXCELLENT dish. If this recipe gets fixed I will update the score.

Chicken thighs work better. Grill them and then toss them in the mix. Coconut cream or coconut milk is a great substitute for heavy cream. Where is the garam masala?

I'm addicted. Not usually a fan of anything exciting, I can't get enough of this.  I may 6x the recipe for the marinade, buy chicken on sale, cut it up and add to freezer bags of marinade (our family portion is about 3 chicken breasts and 1+ recipe of marinade.  I freeze them and thaw them all day, pop them on skewers while and grill while the sauce and rice are cooking.  In 30 minutes I have a weekday meal plus leftovers for lunches. Yum yum.  (I did cut the salt - depends on the kind you use....)

This recipe easily makes my  top five favorite recipes on this entire site. I only gave it four stars becauseI believe tikka masala should always have garam masala in it and this recipe does not. I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce, added two teaspoons garam masala to the yogurt marinade (which I left marinating overnight) and a teaspoon of an Indian cumin. I used about four teaspoons of garam masala in the sauce and about 2.5 tspn cumin. I used only half of a half of a jalapeño pepper because I was serving it to young children too and it was just the right amount of spice for them. I only used about a teaspoon of salt in the marinade and one in the sauce -- it was plenty. I used a bit more butter to smooth out the sauce. I think I would use less tomato sauce next time -- maybe one and one half 8 oz cans rather than two 8oz cans when doubling. Overall tho -- this recipe was smacked clear out of the park. It was stuff- yourself-to-the-point-of-discomfort, good. It was an "Oh my Lord, I've found another Holy Grail recipe!" night. My husband asked that it go on regular rotation.

It was really good with a few modifications, i felt there was way too much salt in the recipe so i cut it in half.  1 Garlic clove doesnt mean much to me since they vary in size, we love garlic so i used about 2TBS minced.  I grilled the chicken over chunks of cherry logs, propane is against my religion.  
Just for a little extra substance i added a half onion while the garlic simmered and a half bag of frozen peas while the chicken simmered in the sauce. 
 Im going to try this with chunks of beef and pork.

My husband and I could NOT eat it because it was way way way too salty.  Next time I make it I will try only 1tsp instead of the 7tsp that the recipe calls for.  I used plain kefir for the marinade and sauce because my daughter is allergic to cream and regular yogurt.

Made it the first time following the recipe exactly. Too salty. Made it again with half a teaspoon of salt and it was perfect! The dish itself has exceptional flavor and over basmati rice with some naan made for a delicious meal.

I'm glad I read the reviews before making this.... it would have been WAY too salty if I had followed the recipe, and WAY too hot as well. I used only a fraction of the salt it called for and I left out the jalapeno and most of the cayenne pepper.

As per other reviews, I put way less salt in. I also used chili powder instead of cayenne and baked the chicken instead of grilling it. Even with the substitutions I thought it was delicious. I cannot speak to its authenticity, though. Can't wait to make it again!

Great dish. A little time consuming should have done it on the weekend. I DID less salt I feel like the 4 tbs was to much. I will be doing this one again. I made a salad with it that was the broccoli and carrots in a bag and a can of peas. Since I had some yogurt left over I used about a cup of that in a separate bowel, lemon juice, 3 grated English cucumbers, dill and minced garlic. Mixed it together and let it sit while the rest was cooking, it was great to eat in between bites. Refreshing

SO GOOD. I cut the salt way down - 1 tsp in the marinade and less than that in the sauce - because as written it would have been inedible, but I still think it deserves 4 stars because the rest of the recipe was spot on.

Amazing recipe, with some slight adjustments! 


I took advice from a few of the comments here and  made a few modifications to the recipe..
The original recipe calls for way too much salt. I only used 1 tsp of salt for the marinade and 1 tsp for the sauce. And instead of cinnamon and cheyenne pepper, i used 1 tsp Garam Masala for the marinade, and 4 tsp for the sauce. It was full of flavor and better than most of the indiant restaurants that ive been to! Amazing!!

As everyone else has said, don't add the salt. I put in a few turns of my sea salt grinder and that's it. Also, I use a combination of cinnamon, cumin and garam masala as others have suggested. I sometimes substitute a quarter of a green bell pepper minced in place of the jalapeno because my wife doesn't like it as spicy. Make sure you don't add the chicken to the sauce too early or it will get way too dry. I serve over jasmine or basmati rice with naan. Its always delicious.

This has been a staple in our house for a couple of years.  We leave the salt in the marinade, and salt to taste at the table instead of the called for amount.  This is by far our favorite home cooked meal.

What a great recipe! Made it just as written ( I always try to do that the first time I use a recipe and tweak it if needed the next time I make it ) and this needed no improving. It had perfect balance of richness and spice. It's comparable to my favorite local Indian Restaurant.

Ive been making this for a couple years now and its one of my go to dishes for large groups. I have never grilled this before. I place chicken yogurt mixture marinade in bowl as directed and let sit in fridge for an hour, then I dump it in a large sauce pan on med-high heat and cook till all juices run clear.. Remove chicken with slotted spoon or strained and move all juices to a bowl, i use a 4 cup glass measuring cupto put the liquid in. Put chicken back in pan and cook on high and slowly add some of the liquid back in(reducing).. A couple of table spoons at a time. About 1/3 of the juices all together. Chicken will brown up a bit and bottom of pan should have some medium burnt (not black!) residue in it. Remove chicken and put to the side. Follow instructions for melting butter spices and jalapeño in pan right on top of pan drippings/residue, omit salt and if you dont want spicy omit the pepper as well. Once you have melted spiced butter put in 15oz tomato sauce(double all spices in recipe for double the sauce.. You can double the chicken if you want too or just leave as is and enjoy the double sauce)and stir on medium and make sure to get all the residue off the pan and into the sauce. Add cream to your darkness/lightness liking and simmer in low for about 20-30 min stirring often to get all the chicken residue off the bottom of pan still. Add chicken and let simmer for another 10 min... This process does dry out the chicken a little but with the chicken chunks soaking in

Fantastic! I didn't cook it like they wanted me to. I did the first part, and then the second part (on the stove) and combined the two sauces. I cooked the chicken on the stove, though, and then added the sauce, and cooked it for a while with the sauce. Served over rice. 

Medium spicy, very flavorful. 10/10 would cook again.

Fantastic recipe!  I followed some review suggestions and made 2 times the sauce and left out all the salt.  I didn't have time to use a grill so cooked it on a rack in the broiler and it was fine.

My family loves this. Our family lives on a tight budget and we get paid monthly so I often have to rely on canned and frozen ingredients.. I cut the butter in half, use evaporated milk in place of heavy cream, and halve the amount of recommended salt. I use pickled jalapeno rings.  I also sometimes have to substitute 2 tsp. ground ginger for fresh or re-hydrate dry cilantro in a pinch. I also don't have the option of grilling the meat. I sear it in a hot cast iron skillet before adding to the sauce.

Followed everyone's suggestion to cut salt and added garam masala. Added 1/2 an onion, spinach, and, kale for a chicken tikka saag that was pretty killer.

I've made this recipe several times and I don't have access to grill, so I skewer the chicken and roast it in the oven elevated over a casserole dish.  While the salt (7 teaspoons) is definitely excessive, I wouldn't omit it entirely.  Instead I would go for 2-3 teaspoons in the marinade only.  Salt helps draw moisture out of the chicken and brings more balance to the flavors in the marinade.  During the simmering stages the salt will become distributed in the sauce as well, adding more flavor.  Salt definitely helps with the texture of this dish, which I didn't appreciate until I tried to follow others suggestions and not use it at all, which was a big mistake.  Overall excellent recipe.  Better than many restaurants and lots cheaper!!

Absolutely loved the marinade and will use it again and again.  Only added 1 tsp of salt instead of 4.  Reduced the cayenne considerably and threw in some garam masala, too.

The sauce was flavorful, but nixed the 3 tsp of salt here. Maybe 1/2 tsp used? 7 tsp of salt for the whole dish is too much in my opinion!  I like my blood pressure where it is!

Overall, it was wonderful!

The recipe was excellent.  I followed exactly as described however cut back on the jalapenos.  Very good except very salty.  Will cut way back on the salt next time. I would have rated 5 stars except for it being too salty.

Yup, too much salt. Just finished my chicken tikka dinner and it was so flavorful and with plentiful of gravy to soak into my rice. But now my mouth has that burning sensation from too much sodium. The recipe was easy to follow and required know special ingredients. I will be making this recipe often but with half the salt.

This was SO GOOD. I only did half the cayenne pepper, and 1/2 tsp in the sauce, but full salt in the yogurt marinade. My husband and I thought it was perfect. Our kids still thought it was too spicy, but that isn't unusual. Will DEFINITELY be making this again!

I read many of the reviews and took the advice of others. I used 1/2 teaspoon of salt in the marinade and 1/2 tsp in the sauce. I omitted the cayenne pepper as well. Love this recipe and will make again very soon!

WAY too salty!!  I am really bummed that I couldn't even take more than a few bites because this looked and smelled really good!  If I were to attempt this dish again, I would definitely do like 1.5 tsp salt and 3/4 tsp salt.

TOO MUCH SALT

The other flavors and seasonings were on point, which is too bad because this recipe was close to fantastic otherwise (and to be fair I made it again later with NO salt and the other seasonings were completely sufficient - this recipe doesn't need ANY salt).  

I have no clue why 7 tsp. of salt are listed; is it a typo?

Anyway it was inedible for us as written.

TOO MUCH SALT!!!!!!!  Geez, had to add double quantities of cream, yoghurt, 500ml milk, 200g sugar, balsamic vinegar....all to dilute the salt. The meat was still salty so it was barely edible.

Put in a lot of time and effort to follow this recipe, and something just wasn't right. It seemed like a lot of spices on dry chicken; not enough sauce. It wasn't like what I've had in Indian restaurants. I was so disappointed that I asked an Indian friend to give me a "real" tikka masala recipe; hers was infinitely better.

I LOVED this recipe!!!! I recommend trying it (with less salt). I recently tried this for the first time at an Indian restaurant, and I thought this recipe was way better. I am going to add this to my collection, and cook it again soon. Simple, quick, and delicious. I reduced the salt to 2 tsp in the marinade and 1 tsp in the sauce, and I could have gotten away with less. Next time I make it, I will only put 1 tsp in the marinade. Because I have young children, I will cut back on the cayenne pepper, but I personally thought the recipe had right amount to make it spicy, yet enjoyable. Great Stuff!!

Very good, I cut out the jalapeno and cut the cayenne pepper in half, I thought it wasn't spicy, my girlfriend found it a tad too spicy, but she doesn't like spicy, so I may cut that in half a second time.

This is WAY TOO SALTY!  Cut the salt in half, that will be what I do the next time.

Also if you don't have a grill, cook the chicken in a separate pan for 5-7 minutes, drain any extra juices and marinade and then add it to the sauce

I use less than 1/4 the salt and pepper per recipe. Grilling the chicken per spec is phenom. I don't sub milk for cream. The heavy cream is mandatory for the sauce but I try to go light when possible so in this instance the texture suffered. I shoulda stirred in a little plain yogurt but I also added a lil more fresh ginger purée in sauce. Yum. Just the chicken marinated & grilled on skewers was The Hit! Serve with basmati rice & stir in the freshly chopped cilantro into rice while it's hot. Do a nice tiziki cucumber salad on the side. You'll like the cool fresh soothing side especially if you go heavy on the heat like I do. As always, keep some Sriracha on the table & enjoy. Next time, I'm adding curry. Oh yeah, whatever you do: don't omit the cinnamon & never overcook the chicken:)

This recipe is awesome! Marinade was great, the sauce was fantastic! We ate a whole pot of rice! I followed the recipe including the all the salt except I omitted the jalapeño and replaced cinnamon with five spices seasoning, 1 can 6oz tomato paste + 6oz water since I didn't have any and doubled the sauce. Awesome! Thank you for this delicious recipe!

The "or to taste" option should really be taken here. I added the 3 tsp of salt for the sauce without thinking and it might as well have been a salt sauce. I threw it out and started over with no salt at all (as I'm assuming the marinade will provide more than enough).

This dish was amazing! We had friends over for dinner and everyone raved about how tasty it was. I used a serrano pepper instead of a jalapeno and I only added the salt to the marinade, not the sauce. I also forgot to remove the seeds from the pepper and it gave it a nice heat.

I should have read the reviews!  TOO much salt!  I thought the amount of salt was too much but added almost 4 tsp. to the marinade thinking it would cook off.  WRONG!  I stopped at 2 tsp. when I made the sauce.  The flavor would have been GREAT had this not been SO salty.  You can always add more salt if you need to be there is NO fixing the addition of TOO much!  Thank goodness I was TESTING the recipe to make for a dinner next week of this would have been a disaster!

With one minor adjustment to salt, this recipe is fantastic. Use 1/2 TSP of salt everywhere it's called for in the recipe, and it becomes far more balanced.

Look no further THIS IS THE BEST!!! Our family fave for many YEARS! A bit spicy for some so caution to those and salt is optional, not needed at all.

This was an absolutely wonderful recipe.  It was the first time I was making Chicken Tikka Masala and it tasted like it came from a restaurant.  I read some reviews saying it was too spicy, so I tried to lower the amount of cayenne pepper and the Jalapeño.

I tried making chicken tikka masala for the first time ever using this recipe and it was delicious! After reading the other reviews, I didn't use the amount of salt called for in the recipe. I added about a teaspoon of salt to the marinade and a teaspoon of salt to the tomato cream sauce, plus a little more on the chicken after cooking it. I didn't have access to a grill or oven, so I just pan sauteed the chicken until cooked through, removed it and used the same pan to make the tomato cream sauce. I also added a teaspoon of garam masala to the marinade, subbing it out for a teaspoon of cumin. And instead of butter, I used coconut oil. Very tasty.

The marinating process for this chicken tikka is great! I marinated for 12hrs instead of 1 though, and the chicken ended up incredibly tender and delicious. I also didn't grill the chicken, simply browned it in a pan on the stove with some olive oil. Warning: this recipe is SPICY. I 1/2'ed the cayenne & paprika it called for and it STILL came out a little too spicy for my taste (still delicious & edible, just needed a tall glass of water with dinner). Another note: I used light whipping cream instead of heavy and it still turned out delicious. Served it with saffron rice & warm naan, was incredibly authentic & delicious!

Delicious! I left out ALL of the salt and cut the cayenne pepper to one tsp. It had just the right kick. I probably could've left the cayenne at 2 tsps and probably will next time, but other reviewers had me fearful of the heat. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly...marinating for 1.5 hours. We served over rice. My husband LOVED it. Full of flavor!

WHOA, SALT.  So, my friends know that I occasionally make food, and asked me to make this recipe.  I obliged, but was horrified when I tasted it.  

SO MUCH SALT.  Too much.  I honestly didn't want to eat this, even after cooking for 2.5 hours and promising my friends a decent meal.  Man, was that embarrassing.  

I chose this recipe because of all of the high ratings, but once I read through them (after the fact) most of the higher ratings note that the salt portions are WAY too high.  I have an issue with that.  (If it had too much salt, your rating should show it).  

Anyhow.  I'm obviously bitter at the moment.  $50+ worth of money wasted simply because of too much salt.  My friends ate it and insisted that it was the "best indian food they have had..." which only made the situation more awkward.  Because I also have a sense of taste, and know just how horrible this was.

Somehow the flavors didn't quite blend in. I agree that it was too salty but the consistency was right and the chicken itself was perfectly cooked.

This is a tasty recipe, but lacks the authentic flavor that garam masala would give it. We prefer using boneless chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 lbs) over breasts. Like other reviewers have said, reduce the total salt content to about 1 teaspoon. Add 2 teaspoons of garam masala to the cumin & paprika in the tomato & cream sauce. I also suggest that the cinnamon in the marinade be cut in half and substitute garam masala for the other half. With these changes, I'd give this recipe 5 stars. As written, it only deserves 4.

I rate the recipes as they are written and not based on modifications. The salt is so heavy that I have to assume that the quantity is calls for is a typo.  However, I will definitely try again without the salt because it has a lot of potential.

I made this with what I had in my kitchen so I had to use whole milk instead of heavy cream, ground ginger instead of fresh, and eliminated the jalapeno altogether. It was AWESOME. We will be having this again....soon.

I took the advice of many posters and cut the salt down in this. It didn't taste exactly like the chicken from my favorite Indian place, but it was good and easier than I expected. The spice is great.

Made this for about 10 friends and like almost everyone else mentioned, they all loved it! Said it was better than the Indian restaurant (Akbar) we all go to. It was so good that I'm using this recipe for a Super Bowl party of about 30 people. Highly recommended!

I made this recipe a couple of days ago with a few changes. The main thing I would say is it was delicious, but way too hot for my taste. I only used a half teaspoon salt in the marinade and a half teaspoon salt in the sauce and will continue with that amount in the future. I only used a half of a jalapeno and will continue with that. The change I will make next time is I will halve the cayenne, I am hoping that will be enough to add plenty of heat without burning my taste buds to nubbins! 
I did make some other changes that worked well. Just because it worked well with my schedule, I marinaded the chicken for about 20 hours. I put the chicken on wooden (soaked in water) skewers and broiled it in the oven on the top rack for about 12 minutes, turning once. The changes I made to the sauce where, I crushed 3 cloves of garlic, minced only ½ ( seeded and de-ribbed) jalapeno, chopped ½ of an onion (sauteed with the garlic and jalapeno), 15 oz. can no-salt tomato sauce, and 15 oz. can coconut milk. I put in the amounts the recipe called for of cumin and paprika. These changes were about personal preference and what I had on hand, it didn't make much difference to the recipe. I have never had Tikki Masala in a restaurant, but I had a couple people tell me that it was better than anything like it that they've eaten before. This dish can most certainly be made ahead of time. I don't know what kind of rice traditionally this is served with, but I had jasmin rice on hand and used that.

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight.  I have had lots of masala and found that this was incredibly spicier than I was expecting.  I even took advice and halved the spice, increased the tomato/cream sauce and cut back on salt and still found it to be too much.  I would definitely not make this again.

Loved it... after I more than halved the amount of salt.  For the marinade I tried 2 teaspoons and for the sauce 1 teaspoon.  This was a little much still.  It tasted fine with jasmine rice and naan but when I tasted the sauce itself after cooking it was way too salty (and I'm the kind of person who loves salty foods).  I think I may use one tsp for the marinade next time and see how that comes out.  

I'll also note that it was very spicy to me even though I discarded the jalapeño seeds.  Not TOO much, but I would recommend trying the recipe before adding any more cayenne or jalapeño seeds.

Followed the recipe except I left out the salt in the sauce, and it tastes just like the Tikka Masala from a restaurant which received raved reviews.  I always grill the chicken as its smoky flavor is quite important for this dish. Thanks for sharing, Yakuta!

The BEST Recipe for Chicken.  I've made it four-five times now.  Added more spices to the Yoghurt several times, and double the lemon/limes.  GREAT.  Added two cans of crushed tomatoes to the final step instead of the paste, because we love, love, love the sauce.

Thoroughly enjoyed eating and making this dish. Thank you for all the salt warnings. I added only a dash and it was plenty. The recipe is very very spicy. It's hot hot. So, a dash of cayenne (if any is plenty). I also added a bit if the yogurt marinade to the sauce and brought it to a simmer. Can't wait to make it again! I never thought I'd be able to match a restaurant quality dish!

Good recipe, but WAY too salty!  Eliminate the salt from the final sauce entirely, then add if necessary at the table.  Also was a bit spicy, which is great if you like it that way.  I do, but my kids don't, so next time I'll cut back on the cayenne.

Love it!  I did lower the amount of salt and replaced the cream with yogurt.  Yes the sauce is not creamy this way but it still tastes incredible without all of the fat.

Flavors were wonderful but the recipe contains way to much salt. I only used 1 tsp (instead of 3) for the sauce and it was far too salty even before adding the chicken. Next time I will add a pinch and adjust seasoning at the end. I also added cooked onions, peppers and mushrooms to the sauce, along with the chicken, which all went together wonderfully.

Was a little skeptical at first since I am not a fan of cinnamon in anything but dessert. Requested by my family so I gave it a try. Very good! Will definitely make again. Only changes I made were cutting the cayenne in half, omitted the salt in the marinade and reduced the salt to one tsp in the sauce.

My tweak to this recipe is to substitute evaporated milk for the cream to reduce calories and fat.   The sauce actually thickened in just 10 minutes (an unanticipated bonus).   Following the recommendations of other reviewers, I reduced the salt in the marindate to 1/2 tsp. and omitted it entirely from the sauce (regular, canned tomato sauce has enough salt for the dish).  Also added 1 cup of cooked and drained caramelized onions when the sauce came to a bubble(I separately cooked the onions so that they would not overwhelm the sauce).  Truly wonderful recipe!

I didn't see the salt warnings in the other reviews until after I already made the marinade as directed, so I didn't add any salt into the sauce, and doubled the tomato sauce and heavy cream...it turned out absolutely delicious!  The sauce didn't get as thick as I expected it too, but it didn't seem to matter when poured over rice.  Excellent and easy - thank you for sharing!

I removed the 7 teaspoons of salt and gave less than one. The two teaspoons of cayenne was a bit much, so I will only add one next time. I also didn't have ginger, but it still came out pretty well.

I'm not sure if grilling it helped much, next time I will cook it on the stovetop, since its easier that way.

It was sooo good.  I followed everything except for the jalepeno (my 5 yr old is very sensative to heat).  My whole family loved it.  My husband even asked if I could make multiple batched to keep some in the freezer on hand just to thaw heat serve!!

This was a great recipe!  As with all the other reviews, the salt is way too much!  I just added a teaspoon each time it called for salt.  Very yummy!  I will be making this over and over!  Naan is a great side dish!

Modifications: I used one tsp salt in the marinade and one tsp salt in the sauce.  I also cut down on the cayenne (I will thank myself tomorrow). Served with steamed white rice and enjoyed with a Loose Canon IPA.  This recipe is amazing!

DELICIOUS! But, leave out all the salt! Surely it's a typo...maybe 1/4 tsp instead of 4 tsp? We made it with out any salt and it was great!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe with some adjustments.......best Chicken Tikka Masala I've ever managed to make.  

Reduce the Salt and Double the Sauce with a few additions.......

Marinade - omitted Cayenne pepper and used less salt 2 tsp (definitely not 4 tsp - might even try just 1 tsp next time)  Used 2 lbs of Chicken Breast.  Covered and refrig for 4-6 hours (or overnight.) 

Doubled Sauce:
2 tbls butter, sauted 3-4 cloves garlic minced, NO jalapeno.  Season with 3 tsp cumin, 3 tsp paprika, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground cloves, 3 bay leaves and NO Salt.  Cook for 1-2 minutes and then add 2 X 8 ounce cans of tomato sauce and 2 cups (1 pint) of heavy cream.  

Absolutely delicious.  Everyone loved this.  Definitely going to make again......next time with some Naan!

Very good recipe! My family has been ruined with this recipe. We used to enjoy our local Indian restaurant's Tikka Masala, but now everyone prefers my homemade version.

This recipe, with modifications makes the best chicken tikka masala I have ever tasted, and I mean it!  There are no Indian restaurants nearby  but I have had this dish in some of the most recommended places in London, New York, and Houston and I think this recipe beats them all.  Thanks to the other reviewers for the suggested modifications they were great,  and I have a couple of my own.  These were my changes to the above recipe:  1 tsp cayenne pepper in the marinade rather than 2.  1 tsp of salt in the marinade.  Instead of cinnamon, used  2 tsp. garam masala, and used 1 tsp black pepper rather than 2.  I doubled the sauce receipe (you will definitely want to do this) and made the following changes:   I used half jalapeno pepper  careful to remove the seeds, 2 cloves garlic, one onion chopped,  1 tsp. salt , 2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp paprika, and 3 tsp. of garam masala , then  two 8 oz. cans of tomato sauce, 1 ¾ cups of heavy cream.  It turned out spicy but not too hot and the salt was just right for me, though my wife said it was still a little salty.   I broiled the chicken as suggested by another reviewer, it worked great!  Once in the sauce for a while, I broke the chicken chunks up some.  It was a little thick, so you may want to use some extra tomato sauce, cream, or maybe water to make it a little thinner.  If you make this, your favorite Indian restaurant’s chicken tikka masala won’t be good enough anymore!

This is a good base recipe, but instead of messing around with 2 t of this and 1 t of that, I made my own tandoori masala and garam masala.  Substitute 2 T of tandoori masala for the marinade.  When simmering, use 1 1/2 T of garam masala.  Better than any restaurant.

Loved it! Family loved it! Friends loved it! I marinate it all day or over night. I also left out the salt as per other reviews saying it was too salty. Came out excellent without salt. I've made this dish 3 times. It's worth the work! So yummy!

5 Stars WITH the recommendations of other users. Less salt is a definite necessity. I decided to make this very spur of the moment so I did not have several of the ingredients. I did not have yogurt, tomato paste, or lemon so I used milk ketchup and distilled white vinegar respectively. I used coconut milk and omitted the cayenne pepper and I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream. Will definitely be making it again.

I made this recipe for a desi cook-off and won first place! I did have a few modifications to the recipe. First, alone with all the other ingredients for the marinade, I added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and 1 tsp of cumin powder, then I omitted the salt. 

For the sauce portion of the recipe, I also added 1 tsp of garam masala and used ghee instead of butter. Ghee is available in most grocery stores now in the "ethnic food" isle. Instead of 1 jalapeno,    I added 2 just because I knew the people I was cooking for would like a kick. Otherwise, the recipe was great, and I plan to use this recipe over and over again!

This recipe was a big hit in our house, with a few modifications. I used about half the salt called for, next time I'll use less than that. Also, based on the other reviews I used about half the cayanne pepper, and next time I'll use less of that as well. We do not have a grill so I baked the chicken in the oven, worked just fine. This will certainly be made again!

Delicious! I just made it almost completely as-is (except no added salt and I used 1% milk instead of cream because that's what I had). I don't think I'd change anything else.

I don't cook often and have limited experience, but this was very simple to understand and replicate. The chicken came out amazing! I was so excited, the one comment I noticed others making and I strongly agree, is that the salt content is extreme. Cut done to 1 teaspoon in both the marinade AND sauce. Other than that 5 stars for sure!

First time attempting Indian cuisine in my kitchen. Was a little intimidated at all the ingredients but oh my goodness! My husband said this recipe was absolutely RIDICULOUS which for him means it better get made again lol! He says by far his favorite and requested it for his birthday meal in march and told me I'd better invite all of his friends to try it. So I'd say all in all it's a definite WINNER! ****cut the salt down to 1 1/2 tsp or you'll regret it you didn't.

This is a phenomenal recipe as written (if you leave out the ridiculous amount of salt, which must have been a typo). I've made it at least 15 times and have adapted it to my taste over the years. I reviewed this recipe on my food blog.

I did not care for this. This recipe calls for 4 tsps salt in the marinade and then another 3 tsps in the sauce!! You only need a pinch of salt for the marinade and probably none for the sauce.

Excellent and fairly quick to prepare.  As other reviewers have stated, DEFINITELY at least HALF the salt, or it will be literally inedible the day of preparation after the sauce reduces.  However, overnight, the leftovers did meld and  while still on the salty side, the dish was much better and no longer sucked all the moisture from your mouth!  Otherwise, no changes need be made to a winning recipe.

This was wonderful.  Like others, I used a lot less salt, only 1/2 tsp.  I also used half the cumin (because I don't like that much). We don't like to eat all that cream so I made it with 1/2 c. of yogurt and 1/2 c. of soy milk.  It was still wonderful and healthy, but didn't taste like low-fat food.  With all the spices, you don't need the fat.

As written, I cannot give this recipe more than 1 star. I thought it seemed like too much salt so put in 2 tsp total. It was still inedible! The first time I made this I read the reviews and eliminated all salt and the recipe was delicious. This time I forgot to read the reviews and added salt and now we are having to eat cereal for dinner tonight :(

i was so excited to make this since i saw what a positive rating it got and because as a vegetarian i can't just go to most indian restaurants and get tikka masala dishes (i made mine with tofu and cauliflower). i was in a hurry though and did not read the actual reviews that accompanied the high ratings--pretty out of character for me. however, like others who made this recipe, i made it only to discover that it was UNBEARABLY salty. we doubled the cream and tomato sauce in the sauce, added extra *unmarinated* vegetables to soak up flavor, and added sweetness to balance out the salt and it was still only barely edible. i realize that those of you who made a dish you were pleased with by modifying the recipe would rate that dish you made highly, but whatever you made is not THIS recipe. THIS recipe is unbearable. But i guess it provides a good basis for modifications.

Great  recipe. Unfortunately I did not read the reviewer comments to reduce the amount of salt.  Fortunately I had about a half can of coconut milk frozen in the freezer that was left over from a previous recipe. I added it to the finished dish whih helped to reduce the salt in the sauce. There wasn't much I could do about the salt in the chicken itself. Otherwise great recipe. I did not grill the chicken but cooked it in my cast iron skillet with a little cooking oil.

My husband had been asking me to make this and I was hesitant because I had never had it or cooked it.  I love to experiment and cook new dishes, but this scared me a bit. I have to tell you this dish was SENSATIONAL.  I am making it again in less than a week.  I did use less salt though: only about 2 teaspoons in the marinade and half of what the recipe suggests in the sauce.  I also doubled the sauce to serve with Basmati rice.  Thanks for a great and delish dish.

WOW was this tasty!
I followed other reviewer's suggestion to skip the salt.  Also, I did this in a skillet instead of on the grill.  This was by far the best (and easiest) recipe I have come across on allrecipes.

This is one of the best recipies I have saved from this website, and trust me, I have saved a lot!!  Both my roomate and boyfriend said this was the best meal I have cooked in a long time, and I agree!  What a fabulous recipie, and I already had 95% of the ingredients in my cabnet.  I used thigh meat rather than breast (what I had on hand...) and eliminated all salt.  Also, do as everyone else says and double the sauce.  If served with rice the sauce will go quick.  Thanks Yukuta!

Ok tried this and one thing really needs to be changed, the Salt! I cut it down a little but it's way too salty!! 1 teaspoon of salt might be just right for the entire recipe. but other than that, really good

This tastes wonderful, but seriously.... do not follow the salt measurements on this.  Mine is intensely salty, and I love salt.  But man, the salt is overkill on this.  I suggest leaving it out, and then adding it to taste so you can build it up to your desire.  I should have followed the "or to taste" part of this recipe.  LOL

Just as good as the local number one Indian restaurant that people drive from many miles away to go to.  It takes about every dish in the kitchen, but worth it.  Prep all the stuff first.

Very good recipe.  Followed the ingredients as written.  We did not find it salty but will lower salt next time we make this.  It was excellent.  As many have said, just as good as the local Indian restaurant.  Next time, we are going to pick up Naan bread and will double the sauce.

After reading reviews, i decided to do this using only 1/2 of the cayenne pepper the recipe called for.  With that, it was still rather spicy hot, more so than i'm used to.  The flavor was delicious though!  I didn't add ANY salt until the cooking was done, then just salted to taste.  I didn't have a grill available, so after marinading the chicken i cooked it in a skillet, and it turned out just fine.  I will be making this again, but less pepper next time.

Made this with tofu, worked even better than I thought it would.  Reduced salt to 1/2 teaspoon for marinade, 1/2 teaspoon for sauce, otherwise it would have been inedible.  With that change, quite tasty.

What a great recipe for Tikka Masala! I agree with other reviewers that there is way too much salt (difference may be in the tomato sauce used as store bought has a lot of salt). The other major change I made was to cut the cream in half. As written, the ratio of cream is too high and overpowers the spices. 

It was too hot to grill so I broiled the chicken - worked fine but may have lost some of the spice.

I've made this recipe so many times. My mom begs me to make it for her. You can alter how spicy it comes out with putting more or less jalapeno in it depending on your taste. Instead of cooking everything separately, I cook the chicken first as it says too and then once its cooked through I drain it and add the tomato sauce and cream to the same pan. I usually use less than the full cup of cream to make it a little less fattening, but it does come out spicier this way. Serve with some naan and white rice and enjoy :)

This is the second time I've made this dish and me and my husband love it! It's so delicious and taste straight out of an Indian restaurant! I also made some alterations and doubled the recipe. I don't have a grill so I combined all the seasonings at once including the yogurt and let it marinade for 45 min. I used 4 tsp. salt altogether instead of what the recipe required. I sauteed the peppers and garlic (used 3 cloves) and chicken until the chicken turned white then simmered it on med-low heat covered for 45 min. I also didn't have any heavy cream on hand so I used 1 cup of carnation milk and 2 (8 oz.) cans of tomato sauce which gave a good amount of sauce to throw over the rice. I paired it with some basmati rice and naan bread. Next time I will roast the chicken in the oven and let it marinade all day. Can't wait to make this dish again!!!

TOO MUCH SALT!  It was so salty, I almost couldn't eat it.  Will definitely make it again, and reduce the salt.  This is coming from someone who really likes salt too.

This is totally YUM...Tastes just like how my favorite Indian Restaurant prepares it with out the high price tag. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream and pureed fire roasted tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. I also did not brown the chicken just cooked it in the pan first.

I impressed both my family and friends with this one, y'all!  I didn't stray toooo much from the recipe.  (Well, maybe)  For the meat, I marinated chicken overnight, used 1 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of cayenne (did this for the kids and for those non-spicy eaters - it still had a little kick!) and 2 tsp of garam masala.  I broiled the chicken instead, flipping the pieces after about 7 minutes.  Other than that, as directed.  For the sauce, now....I quadrupled it!  Yes, I said quadrupled!  I LOVE sauce and I love to have plenty for my rice and naan.  I sauteed half an onion with the jalapeno and 4 cloves of minced garlic.  I used four 8-ounce cans of tomato sauce, a 13.5 oz can of coconut milk and 8 oz of heavy cream.  I was a little worried that the tomato sauce would be over-powering, but it wasn't!  I used 5 tsp each of cumin, paprika and garam masala and 1 tsp of salt.  I served on top of spiced basmati rice and with naan.  I wouldn't be surprised if I am asked to make this again next weekend!

Waaaayyyy too much salt makes it almost inedible. No mix of true Indian spices.  The worst recipe I've ever made.   I can't really believe that this has a high rating; must be something wrong with the calculator.   Do yourself a favor and skip this one.

AMAZING!
I changed it a bit, and used flavored yogurt b/c I completely forgot to buy plain, but it still came out great and will keep using those flavors now because it came out so good. Also cooked chicken in oven instead of grill. We had basamati rice w/ it and it was perfect.
What I did was:marinade:
1 container yoplait vanilla yogurt
1 container yoplait lemon yogurt
2 pkgs chicken breast (~ 4-5 breasts)
1 1/2 tsp cumin
2 tsp garam masala
2 tsp cayenne pepper
2 tsp fresh ground black pepper
1 tbsp fresh finely chopped ginger
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp (a drop less) lemon juice (fresh)

cube chicken and put on skewers in oven on broil, flipping every 8 min or so until sauce didn't look as wet on it and started to get some color.

sauce:

1 15 oz can tomato sauce
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 or 2 tsp cumin
3 tsp garam masala
2 tsp paprika
a little less than 1 tsp salt
2 jalapeno peppers
2 tbsp butter
2 cloves garlic (used the frozen ones that come in cubes, so used 2 cubes)
cilantro for garnish

Pretty decent recipe, my only qualm is that there is not enough sauce with the chicken for my liking... But the flavor is good. Add some extra cumin and maybe some cardimum to further enhance the flavor.

This is one my favorite recipes I've found on all recipes. It tasted exactly like the Tikka Masala from a restaurant. The two sauces separately smell delicious, but nothing like they should. But once you blend it all together, SO GOOD. My husband was upset because we ate it all and he didn't have any leftovers :)


Update: Recently found out my little one is allergic to dairy, so I now modify this recipe with coconut yogurt instead of regular, and coconut milk instead of cream. Not as good, but still very delicious and the flavors of coconut blend right in.

Absolutely delicious, but 4 tsp salt in the marinade is just too salty for my taste.  Cut it down to 1-2 tsp, and it's a party in your mouth. YUM!

Besides the salt.... This was delish. I cut back the salt to about 2 tsp... and it was still too salty. Next time I will only use 1/2 tsp for marinade, and 1/2 tsp for sauce. I served with naan bread and jasmine rice cooked with chicken broth, a few dashes of cinnamon,  and a tad garam masala seasoning. I did add gram masala to the sauce too. Having a family with 3 children, I did omit the jalepeno. Still delish!!!

This was so yummy. Had to ignore the 4-tablespoons of salt. I used 1-1/2 tsp of sea salt in the marinade and 1-tsp in the sauce.  I also substituted half n half for the heavy cream.  I grilled some Roma tomatoes on the stovetop with the chicken.  Definitely a keeper.  Grilling makes all the difference. I have a stove top non-stick grill that I have never used for chicken.  I cooked the chicken and rice first, set aside, and cooked the sauce--- even after the  add'll 20 minutes for the sauce and the sautéing of the chicken, everything came out perfect!  I think it made the chicken hold the juices in a little longer.

SOOOOO GOOD! I ran out of cumin after the marinade, so for the sauce I used 2 tsp garam masala, 1 tsp paprika, and 1 tsp salt. It was perfect, my boyfriend ate until he couldn't move. :)

Absolutely delicious. I followed the less-salt directions from the other commenters, doubled the black pepper (because I like the taste), and just didn't put in the jalepeno because it was spicy enough with the pepper. I added a little flour to make the sauce thicker (you can do this at your own descretion). It tasted just like the chicken tikka masala I get at my local Indian restaurant (except spicier)... I will definitely make this again and again...and again :)

Very tasty. For the marinade, I used a tsp of salt. I also used chicken thighs instead of breast just because my fiance likes dark vs. light meat. Marinated for about 6 hours. I used tomatoes that I had canned from my garden last summer instead of canned tomato sauce - added more texture. I always add salt to taste so I don't know if this was overly salty as written or not. Salt level is such a personal thing so I started with a tsp with the other spices and then added until it tasted right. Next time I will substitute half and half for full cream and possibly only use 1/2 cup. Instead of serving with rice/pita, I served with couscous and sauteed kale. I will definitely make again!

This was delicious but more work than I wanted.  I don't think I will skewer and grill the chicken next time.  I think I would get the same result by browning it in a sautee pan.  The flavor was wonderful though.

The cilantro is essential.  I gave it a 3 because the recipe has errors.  I halved the salt just by seeing the recipe (before I read reviews) and it was still too salty.  Also, I don't think the grill should be on high...even after oiling it the chicken stuck a LOT I think on medium heat it would have worked better.  I did halve the jalepeno pepper and the cayenne b/c I knew my kids wouldn't want it so spicy.  
When I first bite into it (after realizing it was too salty) I felt like it didn't really taste like chicken tikka masala...then I remembered I forgot the cilantro.  I threw that on and "OHH, there we go-that tastes like chicken tikka masala"  Overall I like the recipe but I wish that allrecipes would just go in and edit the salt, it is clearly NOT okay.

OMG!  We picked this recipe for Indian Cooking event.  Everyone, including my husband who is very conservative on his taste bud, gave thumbs up.  This was the best Chicken Tikka Masala everyone had.  I may go a little shy for the salt in the marinade.  4 tsp are awfully a lot of salt.  I cut into 1/2, but instead, we sprincled Tikka Seekh Kabab BBQ mix bought at an Indian grocery store.  Wonderful recipe, and all the participants said this would be a keeper in their recipe box.

My family really liked this.  I used a LOT less cayenne pepper (and had no jalapeno) due to family preferences and very little salt.  I also used vanilla yogurt (what I had on hand).  Delicious.

Great recipe. Here's a couple suggestions if cooking for "less heat" people: cut all heat spices in half (even less cayenne if they really don't like heat)). Also, salt should be reduced to 2 tsp. from 7 tsp. Bon Appetit!

A really good recipe! I used 4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs; marinated for 5 hours; and grilled the pieces whole until almost done. After they cooled, I cut them into bite size pieces and added them to the sauce.  I also modified it based on other reviewers' comments with the following:

for the marinade: used 5 tsp garam masala instead of the cumin, cinnamon, cayenne spices, 
no ginger, only 1/4 tsp salt. 

For the sauce: added 1 onion, chopped; 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp paprika, and 2 tsp garam masala; no salt; half and half instead of the cream. 

Everything else the same. Delicious!!

Great recipe -- as good as the Indian food I ate for the first time on a recent visit to England. (We have no Indian restaurants within an hour's drive of my hometown.)

Only caveat is that, as numerous others have said, I completely eliminated the salt from the recipe. It was delicious without, and I can't imagine what it would be like with a total of 7 teaspoons of salt. Without the salt, this would be a 5-star recipe. (I'd like to give it 5 stars as-is but in good conscience cannot.)

Amazing! Easy to make. I ran out of propane so ' was unable to grill the chicken but it turned out very tender & the sauce is so flavorful. I  only used 3tsp of salt. I served it over jasmine rice.

My family loves this dish. I've made this many times and always make some adjustments based on what's handy. Even though I omit all of the salt, cayenne & jalapeno, it's still spicy enough for my the adults and ok for the kids.  I add garam masala and usually just broil the chicken in the over. Always double the recipe and serve with lots of rice!

This is awesome but calls for way too much salt.  I would only use 2 tsp. for the marinade and 1/2 tsp for the tomato cream sauce.  I also only used 1 tsp. of pepper.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

So good! I don't have a grill (apartment living), so I used my cast iron grill pan for the chicken, which worked pretty well. It's not quite the same, because you don't get the char, but it was still tasty. Other modifications: subbed cayenne pepper for the jalapenos; used half and half instead of heavy cream; only used a pinch of salt in both the sauce and the marinade. I served it over basmati rice. Mmmm...

This was SO GOOD!

Obviously, omit the salt! I used just 1 teaspoon in the marinade and 1 teaspoon in the sauce, and it came out fabulous!

I used the spices exactly how they are listed here, except I used some dried ginger as I had no fresh on hand, and also here in Norway I couldn't find tomato juice in a can, so I used a 400g can of tomatoes and blended them, and a small can of tomato pure. Turned out PERFECT!

Next time I will try to marinade the chicken overnight, as it can only get better, yum!

This is a good recipe.  I had this in an indian restaurant and had tried this recipe to try and duplicate it.  I didn't like using cream in the recipe and tried to lighten it up with fat free half and half which is a good substitution.  Still, it lacked creaminess with the substitution until I added a few tbsps of sour cream right before serving which did the trick.

Yum! I made this with the naan bread from this site. I put the tikka masala in center of the naan (like you would taco meat), topped it with fresh spinach, and rolled it up. My husband and i could't get enough.

This recipe was terrific, but it came out just a little bit too salty. Next time I would also increase the cream/tomato sauce mixture b/c I like more sauce with my chicken.

I cut out the cayenne pepper as suggested and the only salt I added was 1 tsp to the sauce, which I doubled. It was loved by the whole family.

Fantastic! My husband is very picky about Indian food (meaning that what I attempt at home is never as good as a restaurant), but he and I both thought this was delicious. We enjoy spicy food, so the heat from the cayenne pepper was not an issue for us. I did reduce the salt to 1 teaspoon for the marinade and 1 teaspoon for the sauce, as suggested in many other reviews and it was perfect.

This was my first attempt at anything like this, but it came out great.  I did, however, follow other reviews and only added one tsp. salt total and cut down on the cayenne, since I have a 5 year old.  My husband, who had grown up with nothing more exotic than tacos, absolutely loved it.  By the way, the first time I made it, I only had crystallized ginger, and it worked just fine.

Very good and close to my local favorite place.  I followed others suggestions and reduced the salt and pepper.  I also used garam masala and added extra cardamom. Overall, everyone was very satisfied!

My husband and I loved this recipe. It tasted just like Tikka you get from any Indian restaurant. The only change that we made was that we used the broiler to cook the chicken instead of the grill. We will definitely be making this again!

This dish was absolutely delicious after a few minor changes. I cut down the salt to 1/2 tsp, there is so much flavour present so you don't need it. Also, I cut both the black and cayenne pepper in half and just used half a jalapeno pepper to reduce the heat slightly so my mouth wouldn't burn! I kept 1 tsp of cinnamon and added 1 tsp of garam masala. So good!

Made this recipe for the first time tonight. Fantastic! 2 tsp salt in marinade and only a bit in the sauce. Added more cumin than prescribed in marinade due to spice overflow. Used cayenne pepper in sauce in place of paprika. Also added in a can of diced tomatoes for more substance. Marinated for 4 hours. Really really good!! My boyfriend and I both like spicy and this was just right-- pleasantly warm, but not too spicy such that other flavours were obscured.  Might add garam masala, a bit of ginger and an onion to sauce next time for a variation. And there will be a next time!

This is my first time making this recipe and it turned out great, and I modified tons based on what was around the house. For the marinade I used apple cider vinegar instead of lemon. I also doubled the sauce based on previous reviews, using a large can of diced tomatoes and a half a can of Trader Joe's Lite coconut milk. Spice-wise I split paprika, cumin & garam masala. I found the sauce really thickened up in the last few minutes there. Also, I baked the chicken first. Next time I might add more spice. Great intro to the whole concept. Super yum sauce leftover.

Very good recipe. I also added 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 cup of chicken broth to extend the sauce, and added cornstarch slurry to give it a velvety finish. End product was restaurant quality.

My first time making and having this dish -- it was delicious.  I was a little nervous when I tried the yogurt mixture as it seemed very spicy but in the end it gave a nice kick to the final dish.    I cooked chicken on the stove (too cold to go outside!).  I added some steamed carrots to the dish and served over jasmine rice with naan.  When I transferred the cooked chicken into the sauce, there was some of the cooked yogurt mixture in the pan.  We used this for dipping the naan. My husband is not a very adventerous eater and really liked this dish.  I will definitely make it again.  Thank you for posting the recipe! :)

Incredible! I followed other reviewers advice the first time I made this and cut back the salt to half in the marinade and salted the sauce to taste. The second time I made this recipe with Lamb and it was even better! I cut the cinnamom in half and used some garam masala and added an extra jalepeno because we are very spicy. With some garlic naan this is going to become a new staple in our home!

We love this recipe! I make it often and it's super simple. One of the changes that we make is instead of putting the chicken on the skewers and grilling, we just saute the chicken. Much quicker! Also, we let the chicken marinade for several hours instead of an hour. We also omit the jalapeno but it's good with it too if you like super hot! GREAT and easy recipe!!! LOVE IT!

This recipe is definitely restaurant quality. I made exactly how it is written EXCEPT I only used about 1/2 tsp salt in the marinade and even less in the sauce. It was perfect. I love spicy food and this was about at my limit, those who like it less spicy should hold off on the full amount of cayenne or jalapeno.

If you use all the salt this recipe calls for its more like 2 stars, but if you use only 1 tsp salt TOTAL, then its 5 stars. Very yummy. I usually serve with mushrooms and onions sauteed.

i lovedd this! I read all the reviews first as I do with all recipes and it reallly helps. I add a little bit of sugar like 1 tsp maybe to get rid of the sourness caused by the tomato sauce. I use pasta sauce which has the herbs and surprisingly its actually reallly good and I'm indian so i can say this is an indian dish even with the herb pasta sauce!

Although this required a little prep time it was worth it.  Made as written (except I only added a tsp of salt) it was yummy!  Double the sauce if you like lots to add to your rice.

This is very good. Per other reviews, I did cut the salt in half, as well as the cayenne and left out the jalapeno, mostly to be sure it wasn't too 'spicy hot' for our youngest child. Also replaced the cinnamon with garam masala since my husband is sensitive to cinnamon, and while our garam masala does have cinnamon, it's not too much. The added spices in the mix is a real bonus to this dish. I actually added more salt to my own bowl, served over jasmine rice. Used Greek yogurt for the marinade (overnight) and baked the chicken on a rimmed sheet in the oven. So tender! Also doubled the sauce per other reviews, and added a finely chopped medium onion with the garlic (3 cloves) for the sauce. If the heat is too much for some, take the suggestion made by other reviewers to add a dollop of plain yogurt. This is what they do at our favorite Indian restaurants if a dish is too hot/spicy for someone, and it takes care of the problem without compromising the flavor.

LOL   I guess I'm a wimp!!   I halved the cayenne pepper and it was STILL too spicy for me!!   My husband loved it though.    I will be making this again, but I'll divide the marinade and the sauce and do whole spice for the husband and a much more lightly spiced one for me.  thanks for sharing the recipe

This recipe is wonderful!!!! I followed the direction of others and cut the salt and cayenne way back(1/4).  I also used coconut milk in place of the cream and added a touch of sugar to cut the tomato sauce.  So good, will be making it again soon :)

Had to tweak the recipe a bit, hence the 4 stars.  First off-- defnitely too much salt.  I decreased it to 1 tsp for the marinade and 1/2 tsp for the sauce.  2nd-- if you add the amount of cayenne pepper that they recommended, you get a recipe with some major kick.  I'm not a huge spicy-food fan, and it was borderline too spicy for me.  And this was without me adding the jalepeno.  Next time I will cut the cayenne to 1- 1 1/2 tsp.  I also doubled the sauce because there is never enough.  This was much easier to make than I expected and I will definitely be making it again soon with the above changes.

This recipe tastes great and is very similar to restaurant quality chicken tikka masala.  As other reviewers have mentioned, you will definitely need to cut the salt!  I also leave out the jalapeno, just using the cayenne pepper for heat.  You can also use your oven's broiler to cook the chicken, instead of the grill.  My only complaint about this dish is that it's a LOT of work.  I have found that it is much easier to go to our local Indian restaurant when I want to eat chicken tikka masala.  And then I can get samosas and saag, too!

This was so good. I did not add the cayenne pepper or salt. What I will change for next time is not adding the jalapeno because I thought it was too hot and I will try to switch out the heavy cream for something a little more healthy. Can't wait to make this again. UPDATE: I made this a second time and tried to mix milk with flour to sub the heavy cream and I did not add the jalapeno. It did not taste the same. I thought it was because of the jalapeno but when I added it in the next day it still was not the same. I will keep the recipes with the same ingredients minus all the salt. I still can't believe how much it taste like my favorite Indian place. I love Chicken Tikka Masala and I am really happy I have a recipe to make it.

I actually became an Allrecipes member so I could review this dish... wow! It is as good as any restaurant I've been to. Thanks to the comments from other reviewers, I cut the salt. I'm not sure by how much, I just kind of seasoned along the way, a few turns of the sea salt grinder each time, and I also only used half the jalapeno. The yogurt marinade makes the chicken so moist and flavorful. Rather than skewer and grill, I picked the chicken chunks out of the marinade, shook them off, and placed onto a hot, well oiled grill pan on the stove. They only needed 3-4 minutes per side, and watch them closely because the yogurt can easily burn. In fact, I was worried that I'd burned them... but the "char" actually added a lot to the flavor in the end. I was also worried that the tomato/cream "curry" wasn't going to get thick, but I let it simmer for the 20 minutes, then another 10 with the chicken as the recipe instructed and it was perfect! The only thing is that it turned out quite spicy for us, even with only half the jalapeno. Next time, I think I will cut the cayenne and pepper, and maybe also the cumin, in the marinade. I threw some cilantro into the mix at the end, and also garnished with it. My local grocery store carries naan that you heat up in the oven, perfect combo! Looking forward to experimenting with this recipe again.

I would have LOVED to give this meal 5 stars, but I really cant. I made the recipe as written and it was so salty! ICK! I am sure it will be amazing and 5 star worthy when I half (or less!) the salt... but as written it is only worth 3 stars.

This recipe is fantastic. The only change I would make would be to decrease the salt-I used the 4 tsp called for in the marinade and only 1 tsp in the sauce and it was still too salty. But besides that, this recipe is phenomenal.

Would have been delicious but was barely edible because of the salt!  Will persevere and use less than half recommended next time.  This is my absolute favorite Indian dish so I will definitely try again.  Added onions and peppers and that gave it a bit more substance.

Absolutely FABULOUS!  Much cheaper than a restaurant and really was easy.  I only used 1tsp salt total and it was fine.  I cannot believe someone would actually put 7 teaspns of salt in a single dish.  I agree that deleting the jalapeno will decrease the kick, but it had enough kick with just the cayenne pepper and black pepper that my son said the "indian chicken" kept burning his mouth, but he'd eat it again because, "It is SOOO yummy!"

This is absolutely delicious! I make it for my boyfriend who loves Naan and Curry, and he goes completely googly eyed every time I make it. I use a little bit less spices, skip the salt and pepper (with the jalapeno and cayenne there really is no need), and if I don't have any fresh ginger on hand I use the powdered stuff and it still tastes fantastic. I have made this about 12 times to date and will continue making it for years to come!

My non-cooking husband made the marinade and marinated the chicken for 2 days before putting the skewers on the grill.  The chicken was very good with a level of spiciness that was just right.  I didn't have any halapenos or cilantro, and I think that made it too dependent on the flavour of cumin for taste.  I image the two ingredients I DID NOT use will make this recipe an excellent addition to my dinner rotation!  Husband loved it.

I took the jalapeno out, reduced the salt by way more than half and cut the cayenne pepper down to a teaspoon. I used Smoked Paprika in the sauce. This was very good. Everyone liked it. Will make again and again.

Excellent!!!  Everyone loved this and hubby labeled it "a winner"!  I reduced the salt to 1 tsp.  Otherwise, prepared as written.  Served over Basmati rice with Naan and Cucumber Raita on the side.  Great dinner!

Very delicious and authentic tasting, but I had to make a few adjustments, based on previous reviewers. 1 - Just use salt to taste.  The recipe calls for WAY too much salt (and I like my food very salty!) 2 - The dish as written is very spicy, so I halved the cayenne pepper in the marinade and the jalapeno in the sauce.  3 - I didn't feel like using skewers and grilling, so i placed the cut up chicken in a baking dish and baked at 375 for 25 minutes before finishing in the sauce. 4 - I added 3-4 oz. tomato paste and 2 tsp. of garam masala to the sauce. In addition I used 1 1/2 cups of half and half instead of heavy cream.  I served the chicken with yellow rice and store bought naan...YUM!

Awesome! Adjusted Salt as suggested but I don't think you have to cut it out completely. I would try marinating overnight next time. Definately a keeper. I did have trouble with the chicken on the grill so make sure its well oiled or try the broiler.

This really does taste like the tikka masala at my favorite Indian place, IF you drastically reduce the salt. I only use 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper in the marinade and it's still plenty hot. I also love to slow cook this, minus the cream, after marinating - makes the chicken so tender! Then I add the cream near the end of the cooking time.

This is as good as at any Indian restaurant as long as you cut the salt and cayenne by about a third.  To make it easier I just cook the chicken in the marinade in the electric skillet. I add some carrots, mushrooms, and red bell peppers then add the sauce.

This was such a great and easy recipe!  I did make a few changes.  First, as per others I did not add any salt until the very end - and it was just a shake or two to taste.  For the yogurt I only had vanilla, but it turned out to be a plus!  I only used 1 tsp cayenne because I'm paranoid about too much heat. I didn't feel like starting the grill or turning on the oven, so I just cooked the chicken stovetop.  After making the sauce I just added the chicken and simmered everything together for a few minutes.  I served over rice.  Very very good!

I love Indian food and eat a lot of it here in the Bay Area.  This Tikka Masala recipe is on par with some of the best restaurants.  I'm grateful for reading the reviews first because it's true, you ONLY NEED TO ADD SALT TO TASTE.  I only added a pinch to the whole recipe.  I also added a couple extra cloves of garlic but I do that with everything!

more like chicken tikka ma-SALT-a.  this recipe is way way too salty.  I guess that's what i get for just following the recipe without looking at the reviews to see what other people said.  with that said, this definitly has great flavor as long as you control the amount of salt used.  next time i will definitely use much less in the marinade and salt the sauce to taste.

I was skeptical about this recipe considering the amount of cinnamon, cumin and cayenne in the marinade...but I followed the recipe as instructed except cut the salt by half as recommended by everyone who reviewed the recipe.  I was absolutely amazed after taking the 1st bite!!!!  My husband said.."I don't know what you did...but that was AWESOME!!!"  Then he high fived me :) Being a native Californian...I didn't feel it was too spicy at all.  Tons of flavor and although the mix of spices are unusual...you need to trust this recipe (with the exception of the amount of salt).  It won't let you down.  Even my 5 year old loved it and didn't mind the heat from the cayenne pepper and jalapeno.

Excellent. Be sure to halve the amount of salt, though! That's what I did, and it definitely was still salty enough.

This is one of the best recipes that I've made in a long time.  I cut the salt in half and it was still great.  I served the sauce as a dipping sauce instead of tossing the chicken in it.  Will be making this one again.

this was very good!  i made some adjustments though.  i didn't grill the chicken separately.  instead i marinated it and then cooked it in the sauce.  i think it made it a bit more flavorful.  i also added some cinammon to the sauce.  made it a bit more flavorful.

Hmmm... I prepared chicken tikka masala (curry version) slightly different (easy) way and it looks different too... but it turned out to be tasty. My personal recipe is in my Recipe Box.

Super yummy! I followed the exact recipe (leaving out the cayenne pepper and jalapeno) and it did come out too salty. I'm thinking the salt should be cut in half. Overall it was very easy and good!

This was really good and super easy! I made it in the pressure cooker, so I just stirred in the chicken with the butter/oil and garlic, then dumped in all the ingredients. I followed the advice of using garam masala in place of the cumin/cinnamon/cayenne and only used 1tsp salt in the entire dish and it was plenty. Yummy!

This is such a delicious recipe. I've made it a few times already. The only changes I made were to use evaporated skim milk in place of heavy cream, because I don't usually buy cream. I use the whole can, and I puree a can of diced tomatoes and use that for the tomato sauce. It yields a bit more sauce that way and I definitely like to scoop up my sauce with naan bread. Yum!!

I didn't change a thing and this recipe came out absolutely perfect! Big family hit. A little time consuming and lots of dirty dishes/grill but well worth the effort in the end. The more I make this recipe the easier it gets but tastes as amazing as the first time. My taste buds have never experienced such an amazing combination of ingredients.

This was amazingly GREAT!!! I will definitely make it again. Mine was not spicy as I followed the other reviewers' suggestions. I doubled the sauce recipe with only one jalapeno and I used 4 large chicken breasts. Only used 1/2 tsp. of salt in marinade and 1 tsp. in sauce. Made the Naan bread from this site too and it went excellent together.

I made this last night.  It was sooo good!  It wasn't as spicy as I had hoped, but I know what to do for next time.  I "salted to taste".  I also doubled the sauce.  I used a serrano pepper but only used half, hence why it wasn't as spicy.  I also made some naan using a mix from our local grocery store.

This was really good!  I used about 1 tsp salt for the marinade and 1 tsp for the sauce and it was plenty.  I also used about 3/4 tsp of cayenne pepper and it wasn't too spicey. I don't have a grill so I broiled the chicken.  It all turned out really well & will make it again!  I served it over jasmine rice.  The fresh herb on top was great & I wouldn't skip it!

I just finished making and eating this recipe. I made the alteration of not using cinnamon, instead substituting garam masala. I completely forgot to add any salt, both in the marinade and in the sauce. It ended up tasting fine without salt, but I sprinkled some on it. A little salt does make the sauce's flavor pop a little more, but it's been said previously (and I agree) that the amount of salt in this recipe is a bit ridiculous. I ended up having quite a bit of sauce left to sop up with my rice, which was a surprise since many have said to double the sauce recipe. I will be making this again! Possibly with paneer as well.

My mom and I served this dish as a family dinner one night and even the picky eater of the family LOVED it! We altered a few things: we took out the cayenne pepper, practically halved the salt, and added about a teaspoon or two of sugar to the sauce. It was restaurant PERFECTION! Thanks for the recipe!

This was amazing! Just like the restaurant. I made a few changes according to other reviewers and my preferences. First off:  1.) It didn't need ANY salt. I threw a few dashes into the sauce and that was it. 2.) Instead of grilling the chicken, I just dumped the chicken and marinade out into an uncovered glass dish and baked it at 475 for probably 10-15 minutes. I then chopped up the chicken and added it to the simmering sauce. 3.) I added lots of curry spice to the sauce (I looked for garam masala but couldn't find it at the grocery store.) The flavor was perfect.  And I used lowfat yogurt and cream. It wasn't runny at all, it was creamy and thick. I let it simmer for a while and thicken up. Hope this helps out, enjoy!

I wish I'd read the reviews before making this, because like most people, I found this had WAY too much salt. I cut the salt for the sauce in half, but made the mistake of using the whole amount for the marinade, and it was almost too salty to eat. Other than that though, it would have been excellent, and I'll definitely make this again, with modifications. Also, I doubled the amount of sauce, since we like extra for dipping bread.

Very tasty dish. Used less salt than recipe says and added garbanzo beans, just because I like them. Seems like there is something missing in the flavor, but can't peg it, but it is very good still and easy to make.  I will make this again.  Thank you.

I limited cayenne to 1/2 tsp, and black pepper to 1 tsp.  Used ground ginger, about 1 tsp.  Olive oil instead of butter, left out the jalapeno, and omitted all salt.  I doubled the sauce but only had just over 1 c cream so made up to 2 cups with skim milk.  It was OK.  Would definitely add more pepper next time (I was afraid of too spicy for my 3 year old).

Awesome...I loved it. I forgot the cilantro, but it was still great. I did however cut back on the salt and it was still way to salty, so I would watch how much you put it...but very, very tasty.

Awesome! Just cut back on the cayenne pepper (unless you're able to handle quite a bit of heat), and omit the salt.

This is a really great Tikka recipe! I would however drastically cut the amount of salt. The next time I make this I will use half the salt and hope that does the trick!

perfect.....except too salty (and I loooove salty, but this was even too much for me) I had to make more, add no salt, and then combine the two for the perfect salt level. PERFECT once I did that. Everyone went nuts over it.

We loved it!!! I made a few changes because Dave doesn't do heat very well.  I reduced the amount of salt to 2 tsp and eliminated the jalapeno.  Other than those minor changes, I followed the recipe as written and we stuffed ourselves..very, very good!!

Great recipe. I subbed garam masala for the cumin/cinnamon/blk pepper combo. I didn't add any salt per other reviewer's suggestions. I added white onion into the sauce. The dish came out great and I'll be making this over and over.

I have never had this in a restaurant, so I don't know how my changes compare with how it "should" taste, but I know it was way yummy.  I have almost no tolerance for spicy so I left out the cayenne and used a can of green chilies instead of the jalapeno.  (Hubby, who is Mexican, added tabascco to his)  I also used coconut milk instead of the cream.  Very very yummy.

Great recipe, great taste.  WAY too much salt.  Use low (or no) salt versions of the tomato sauce and other ingredients and add MUCH less salt than they say.   Just add it in at the end to control the amount so you dont have a heart attack.   Really delicious.  I cook the meat in my clean cast iron pan (not my well seasoned one).  You dont have to overcook it in the first set of steps, as it will cook thoroughly when it simmers.   Also, I've made this recipe probably 5 times, and recently (to try to make it a wee more health) I've substituted half of the cream for coconut milk and I think it came out even better than before.

A fantastic restaurant-quality Chicken Tikka Masala recipe! I omitted the cayenne pepper and reduced the salt as other reviewers suggested. I also used fat free half-and-half instead of heavy cream to make it healthier and it still tasted amazing!

Loved this, I used less cayenne pepper because I dont like it to hot.  I did use whole skinless thighs in which I scored before marinading.  I use less salt in both marinade and sause since it seem a bit much.  I also added a teaspon of Gram masala.

My first time making any kind of Indian food, and it was AWESOME.  I used half and half, and just a little jalapeno, but I thought the heat was just right.  I didnt' use as much salt as called for and it was quite salty, but otherwise really really good.  Served over basmati rice.  Will definitely make this again.

I have made this recipe three times for family gatherings and it is by far the best Chicken Tikka Masala recipe I have used.  I marinated the chicken overnight.  I think the flavor was even better and fuller than when I marinated it for an hour, but it was still good that way nonetheless.  Sometimes I used watered-down canned tomato paste for the masala base, which worked, but taste it before adding the chicken.  If it is a hint too sour, add a teaspoon of sugar at this stage.  I found it gets rid of the sourness and the masala is perfect.

absolutely fantastic!  If you double the sauce and only add 1 tsp of salt, it comes out perfectly.  Better than in a restaurant and much cheaper.  Highly recommended!

Definitely use much less salt, as most have suggested.  Otherwise it was tasty.  Think I might use half and half next time (or even whole milk) as the sauce was a bit thicker than I'd like.

When we were making this, we questioned the 3 teaspoons of salt (and only put in two). It was WAAAY too salty!! I've looked at other Marsala sauce recipes and 1/2 teaspoon is typical. I understand it says "or to taste" but THREE teaspoons!

Incredibly delicious. A friend made this recipe for us and we couldn't believe our palates! The next week, another friend took us to her favorite Indian restaurant and we ordered this dish since we had loved it so. There was no comparison, this version completely outdid it!    Just a note: One time I used Half and Half to cut down the calorie content. My husband's review was: "I could eat two bowls without feeling awful, but I would rather feel awful because it is so rich and good!"

I followed the changes suggested by another reviewer: In the marinade, use 1 tsp. garam masala instead of cinnamon, and only 1 tsp salt, marinate all day, For the sauce, Use 3 cloves garlic, 2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp paprika, 3 tsp garam masala, 1/2 tsp salt, 15oz tomato sauce, and 1 3/4 cup heavy cream, this will double the amount of the sauce, which was recommend to soak up with rice.  I am lucky that there is a indian grocery near me, but I noticed garam masala (ground) in the international section of my wal mart.  This recipe after the changes tasted just like at our favorite Indian restaurant.  I served it over basmati rice.

I have been looking for a recipe for chicken tikka masala, since it is what my fiance and I always get when we go out for Indian, but we're tired of paying $25/person for it!    This is exactly what I was looking for!  As recommended in the reviews, I omitted the salt completely.  I also doubled the sauce (great for dipping naan, pita or any flat bread, and I also had the exact amount of tomato sauce/cream for twice as much).  Highly recommended!

I have made this recipe twice and loved it both time.  First time, I followed the recipe (except omitted salt as noted in other reviews) - it was SPICY! But, oh so delicious! I served it over Basmati rice and my boyfriend, who is Indian raved about how good it was.  The second time, I decided to tone down the heat (I don't like too much spiciness).  I halved the cayenne pepper and I took the seeds out of the jalapeno before chopping.  Much less spicy, still delicious!  Also, I threw 2 handfuls of peas in there when done cooking - added some color and veggies...yummy! (still served over rice).  Both times, I marinated the chicken all day.  Also, if you are nervous about the heat (or just for added flavor) - serve with a side of plain yogurt.   Wonderful recipe!

I LOVE Chicken Tikka Masala.  This is a very good recipe, but is even better if you add some Cardamon.  Throw in 2 teaspoons with other spices in the sauce and you won't regret it!  The Cardoman adds a nice complexity to the flavor so its not just dominated by the Cumin.  Also, don't shortcut the reduction time.  Let the sauce simmer down for at least 20 minutes.

YUM!  This turned out great!  Everyone loved it from my husband, kindergartener, and 2 year old.  I took other's advice and cut the salt to 1 tsp in the marinade and 1 tsp in the tomato sauce and it was perfect.  I also left out the jalapeño and cayenne due to the kiddos.  Perfect combo of savory and sweet.

We really enjoyed this. I followed the advice of other reviewers using 1/4 tsp of salt in the marinade and just a dash in the sauce. I ran out of cayenne pepper so I only put a bit more than one teaspoon and boy was it spicy! We enjoyed it because we like spicy food - but I wonder if it might have been too much as written. Boyfriend also made me use 1/2&1/2 instead of cream for health reasons, but it was still good. I won't be giving up my favorite restaurant version anytime soon, but this is a great and easy (despite the long list of ingredients and steps) option to have at home. Served it with basmati rice I prepared in our rice cooker. This definitely only served the 2 of us with a bit left over - so I would adjust accordingly for more people.

I skipped the salt on the marinade and only used 1 tsp of salt on the sauce. It was perfect. I've never had anything like this before and I'm in love!! Great stuff!

Thank goodness I read the reviews before making!  Definitely don't make it exactly as written!  1 teaspoon salt is plenty.  I also need to use less cayenne and jalapeno because it is way too hot for me with how much there is.    Instead of marinating, I just cook the chicken in a pan with all of the ingredients, which is probably why it is so hot.  When the chicken is done I just mix it in with the sauce and it's ready to go!  I double the sauce as well!  This recipe is SOOO good!  Love it!

deeelish! Yes, too much salt is called for. I used kosher salt, and only 1/4 of what is called for and it was just right. Marinate overnight if you can. I like mine a little spicier so after making the cream sauce I added hot chilli pepper powder for heat, slowly and tasting after each addition. Also, used light buttermilk in lieu of yogurt for marinade. It's what I had! MUST serve over rice. I don't have a grill, so I just heated up a small skillet and put chicken on it until dark in color on the outside, turning frequently. Don't coat the pan with anything, the chicken is moist and wet enough from being marinated. I even got a little char! What a treat! Indian food is like any other regional cuisine, it can vary in taste depending on who makes it... so it may not taste exactly like your favorite take out place, but just make it and then tweak to your taste.

This was delightful!  I took the advice of other reviewers on the salt issue and only added 1/2 tsp. every time salt was called for, rather than the obscene amount the recipe states.   I served it over basmati rice and made naan to go with it.  Yum.

I cut the salt and cayenne in half and also used a little less heavy cream, but added some 1% milk to make it a bit lighter.  It turned out fantastic - at least as good as takeout.  My husband loved it too, and I'll definitely make it again!

ok, this is getting a four-star rating, but only because i KNOW that it will taste better after i have changed the amount of salt it calls for from 7 teaspoons all together to 1/2 a teaspoon all together... my mouth STILL hurts from how salty this dish was!

Wow!  This was great!  I only put in a tiny bit of jalapeno and halved the amount of cayenne because my daughter was going to eat some.  I baked in the oven and served with saffron rice.  Delicious!!!

I was a little skeptical about this recipe calling for a jalepeno but it was spot on!  Not the easiest dinner to whip up but MMMM so worth it.  I also used fat free half and half instead of the cream and it thickened nicely.

GREAT recipe that I hope can be simplified a little with equal taste, as the yogurt marination is a lot of work.  I will try sprinkling my whole chicken breasts (not chopped into pieces) with lemon juice, and let sit for 5-10 minutes while grill or grill pan heats.  Then dust chicken heavily with the rest of the marinating spice mixture and grill til done.  Let cool, chop into bit size pieces and add to the masala sauce.  For the sauce, I like a little more heat so I double the jalapeno and add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne to the masala sauce, otherwise it is a rich and savory but not spicy sauce.  I also added to the sauce: 1-2 tsp ground ginger; 1 tsp garam masala; used only 1/2 tsp of salt; and like others I increased the amount of tomato sauce to taste.  Next time I will add 1-2" of fresh shredded ginger root (saving some for garnish), and will definitely make a double batch of the sauce to freeze half for future use.

Holy moly it's good!  The day I made it it was pouring outside and I couldn't grill the chicken as it instructs.  So I just cooked the chicken on the stovetop in a pan, draining as much liquid as I could as we went.  I didn't use any jalapeno peppers because we don't really like it, but added a little cayenne to make up for it.  Instead of heavy cream I used half and half, thickened nicely.  My kids beg for  this one.

This has got to be the best Indian recipe I've made. This meal has been a favorite of mine since the first day I made it. I follow the recipe step by step and it turns out excellent each time. There was a time however I did add an extra chicken breast and didn't need to add more of the other ingredients. This recipe is fabulous and although it may look intimidating because of the many ingredients, it's really quite easy. If you enjoy being in the kitchen with the aroma of the numerous spices used, then this will be enjoyable for you. Thanks for such a great recipe.

Good but very salty and spicy.  Use half the salt and half the cumin for the sauce. We eat Texas hot, hot salsa and this was too much. Will make the recipe again with modifications and rate. Green peas help to tone it down.

As is, salty and spicy!  That being said, those two things are easy to adjust and I think the recipe is fantastic.  I will definitely be using it again and again.  We ate it with Naan, but once I tone the salt and spice down a bit, I think the sauce will go wonderfully with rice.  I also added cashews at en end and loved the little crunch and added flavor it gives the dish.

For the time this took to make, it really didn't taste that amazing. Mine didn't taste too salty (actually, I added salt & pepper afterward), but it was to lemony/zesty. I think the lemon juice plus the tomato puree pushes it over the top. If I make this again, I'll halve or remove the lemon juice.

FABULOUS!  I took the advice of other reviewers and only used 1 teaspoon of salt; wise decision.  Also, we are lovers of sauce, particularly to dip naan in, so I doubled that.  Totally worth it.  I felt like we were in England again... will definitely be making this again!

Very good except way way too much salt! I would cut it down to 1 tsp for the marinade and 1/2 a tsp for the sauce. You could also cut the fat by adding milk instead of heavy cream. The spices on the chicken were delicious!

This is fantastic. Of course, without the salt. I used a little garam masala in place of on of the one cumin tsp. I have tried 2 other recipes and this was the best so far.

This is the first time I've made any kind of Indian dish.  It was delicious and the husband loved it, too.  I did only use half the cayenne in the marinade, and only 1 tsp. of salt in each the marinade and the sauce.  I think I could have even used half of that amount of salt.  I didn't need to double the sauce, it was more than enough and there's still enough leftover for husband's lunch tomorrow.  I also think it would be better with coconut milk rather than the cream, as someone else suggested.  This is a keeper recipe with the adjustments made.

This recipe inspired my first review -- fabulous! Although there are three steps, the recipe is easy to do. I must admit I had some doubts when seeing the amounts of spices but all the phases melded perfectly. I tripled the recipe and sort of judged what ingredients to not truly triple. I can't say enough about how good this was. It was as good as any entree I have had in our favorite Indian restaurant. Like just about everyone else I omitted the salt and judged according to my eaters' tastes with the cayenne and jalapeno. Truly awesome! Thanks!

So delicious it surprised me.  I used an Indian blend of chicken curry masala spices in place of the spices used in the marinade, in equal amount to the sum of all the spices called for.  I did not alter the tomato cream sauce.  It worked out wonderfully.  Will definitely make this again and again.

My family loves this recipe :) I've made it twice now, and I only use a 1/2 tsp. of salt.   This is a great recipe, just listen to all of the previous reviewers and DON'T use all of that salt!  It freezes well too, so you can double the recipe and freeze half for a great weeknight dinner!

I did read the reviews so I knew about the salt.  I think one teaspoon for the marinade would have been perfect.  Also I made this for my parents and kids so didn't use any chili powder or jalepenos.  This still turned out really really great.  I did double the sauce recipe as another reviewer suggested.  Everyone loved it!  Thank you

This recipe is a keeper, everyone loved it! As previous recommended left out the salt, I love lots of salt, but thought I could added later if needed-didn't need it. Cut the black and cayanne pepper in half, it was awesome! Today I am trying one part half & half, one part greek yogurt for the heavy cream. Served with Naan bread recipe by Mic. Safron yellow rice as well. Simply fabulous!Thank you Yakuta

Great recipe just tooooooo much salt! I followed the recipe, but I adjusted the salt because it seemed like too much and even cutting the salt to almost 1/2 it was still way too salty. Other than that it came out really good.

Must be an error in the recipe as this is an obscene amount of salt. I put in less than half and it was still salty. Otherwise the flavour was awesome.

Wonderful!  I was making this for a large party so I omitted the cayenne pepper to make it a little milder.  It got rave reviews.  I will now make it as stated to see if we like it that way too.  I did omit all the salt as other reviewers suggested as I don't usually cook with salt anyway.

Amazing. My friends and I love eating Tikka Masala at the a great Indian Restaurant  on Devon in Chicago (Indian Area). When I made this for them they were blown away. They have all asked for the recipe. 

I omitted all the salt and it still tasted great even by others standards

Recipe as written is very hot and salty, but with a few modifications based on other reviews, it's outstanding! For the marinade, I only used 1 tsp of salt, and for the sauce, I only used 1/2 tsp of salt and omitted the jalapeño. I also substituted a cup of plain yogurt for the cup of heavy cream in the sauce to save calories. It was perfect with these modifications and I will certainly be making it again.

Used a total of 1 tsp salt.  Cut cayenne to 1/2 tsp and used 1/8th of a jalapeno--still spicy enough for me and my husband and a little spicier than my toddlers prefer.  This is the closest we have come to replicating restaurant-style Indian food.

Very good! However, next time I will omit most of the salt. A bit too salty for my liking (and apparently most other people since many other people made the same comment).   I made a few changes: -I wanted to make it healthier... So, I substituted in yogurt for the cream. Tasted wonderful. I really think it's fine without it. -I added a bit of Turmeric and Masala. I didn't have any paprika, so I omitted it. -I added some sauteed chopped onions to the sauce. -I bbqed the chicken. But I've seen people bake the chicken in the oven.  With those changes, I thought it was great. A bit salty, but great. Next time I will omit the salt and maybe try it with a homemade tomato sauce. Homemade is always better.  Thanks for the recipe and inspiration!

I've tried several chicken tikka masala recipes and have always been disappointed.  This recipe is very good and the closest you can come to the authentic restaurant taste, and it's so easy to make.  I used non-fat fage greek yogurt and marinated for a few hours in the fridge.  Next time I want to take some of the other reviewer advice and use garam masala instead of the cinnamon.  I also broiled the chicken in the oven for approx 9 minutes.  Overall a really excellent recipe that will satisfy that craving for Indian food.

We LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! My fiance and I had fallen in love with a local Indian restaurant and always went for the chicken masala-I wanted to do something special for our anniversary, so I tried my hand at this recipe-We both loved it :) I too followed the recipe, with the exception of not using much salt. I also grilled the chicken on the stove in a little bit of olive oil(it does not appear to alter the flavor). I just recently made this for the second time, and I marinated the meat for 8 hours--AMAZING!!! It had so much more flavor and was so juicy. This recipe is in our weekly meal lineup!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I have never made indian food before, so i was a little nervous, but it tuned out great!  My boyfriend said it was one of the best things i have made, and I have been experimenting for a few years now.  I followed the other advise about no salt (just a few shakes).  And I replaced some of the cream with half and half, and it tasted wonderful.  TOTAL KEEPER!

I love this recipe, I make it all the time. Easy and comes out great. I think it calls for way too much salt, it almost ruined the dish the first time I tried it. I use 1/2 to 1 tsp. You can also use milk or low fat milk in place of cream, obviously not as rich, but turns it into a low fat dish!

I followed my instincts (and the opinions of several posters) and reduced the salt to one teaspoon each in the marinade and sauce. It was delicious! Easily on par with many Indian restaurants. The only change I will make next time is to marinate the chicken overnight, I think this is the key to that incredibly soft meat that one always finds in good Indian food.

Wow, the chicken in this was AMAZING! Moist and flavorful. I almost didn't want to put the sauce over it, but I'm glad I did because it was yummy, too. Served over whole wheat couscous.

If I didn't have high blood pressure, I do now after eating this meal. I, like many of the others, found this to be way too salty. And for those of us who rely on recipes to be correct the first time around, (aka very challenged in the kitchen) this can be quite the blow to someone's self confidence when a recipe is screwed up. I will make this dish again but I will omit all of the salt but I hope the writer of the recipe or the publishers will re-write this recipe to omit the salt. Once that's done I'm sure the submitter will receive noting but 5 stars each time.

This was excellent.  Truly authentic tasting - I'm part Indian - and almost addictive in taste, it was truly a joy to make and consume.  I doubled the recipe and used only one jalepeno for the whole thing, and used six of the eight skewers of chicken we had.  With the other two I made sandwiches the next day!  I cut up the cubes of marinated chicken, put them on sandwich rolls and covered them in cheddar cheese, and let them broil on low for about 5 minutes.  They were delish! :D  The Chicken Tikka itself was amazing - we had some fresh naan and used white basmanti rice, cooking it in oil.  :D Yum.  A strong 5!

This is REALLY, REALLY good!  I make it mostly for when company comes over because it seems like a lot of work.  Today however, I really wanted it but didn't want the trouble so I bought a jarred Tikka Masala sauce.  YUK.  I threw the jar out and decided to follow this recipe, but instead of marinating the chicken (no time...) I diced the chicken and added the marinade ingredients, stirred it up a bit and threw it into a skillet.  I added the remaining ingredients when the chicken was almost done.  WOW!  It was just as good this way, possibly even better since the chicken was more moist. I did end up substituting sour cream for yogurt because I didn't have any, but I would stick to the yogurt next time.  Other than that, this will be the way I make it from now on.  Oh!  And I always double the sauce ingredients.

Easily my new favorite meal. This is a fantastic dish that no one I've made it for hasn't liked yet! This tastes exactly like it does in Indian restaurants. The only changes I make are that I dial down the salt and the chilis. Also, I grill the chicken in batches on my George Foreman grill--it works great!

This was an excellent recipe. My son thought it tasted just like the Indian restaurant version. I appreciated his honesty ;-)  I left out most of the salt as others have mentioned and i also left out the jalapeno peppers since my family still cannot take super spicy food yet.  I also made extra sauce since i like extra with my rice, was super easy to do.  Since i did not have a grill, i found broiling the chicken on skewers worked great and the chicken was very tender after marinating for several hours.  I would highly recommend this recipe (with a few modifications to your own liking).

This is a very easy and solid tikka recipe.  I used kosher salt and cut it by half, because the amount called for in the recipe makes for a really salty experience.  The broiler works great and the meat is juicy and flavorful.  Recommended.

I made this last night and was very happy with the chicken but somewhat disappointed in the sauce. I do plan to make it again, though. I cooked the chicken on metal skewers laid across a 9x13 Pyrex in the oven for 25 minutes at 350. It was so good that I may make just the chicken and serve it with couscous in the future. I also left off all but 1 tsp of salt in both the chicken marinade and the sauce. When I make the sauce again, I will leave out the jalepeno completely at my husband's request. (I thought the spice was fine, but he doesn't like hot stuff.) Second, I'm going to use petite diced tomatoes rather than tomato sauce. There was something distinct that I disliked, and I'm pretty sure it came from the canned tomato sauce. It may have been the brand I used, but my favorite Indian restaurant's Tikka Masala has chunks of tomatoes in the sauce, so I think we'll like that better. I'm also going to cook the sauce for a really long time because I'm not sure all the flavors had enough time to combine on my first go round.

I read a lot of the reviews before attempting this dish. I wasn't about to mess up at an attempt of my husband's favorite! I'm glad I took the time to read the reviews because I took all the advice (pretty much) and cut down the salt and the cayenne (since I only wanted a mild/medium flavor) and also cut the cumin in half as well. I broiled the chicken in the oven instead of grilling it and it all came together wonderfully. My husband said "I hope you wrote down what you did. Don't change a thing!"

This was great! I cooked the chicken on a G. Foreman grill. Which I was a bit nervous about. It turned out perfect! I used only TWO teaspoons of salt in the whole dish and that was plenty!!!! One in the marinade and one in the sauce. I really dont understand how they could call for over 5 teaspoons of salt in the dish. It must be a typo!! Wow. I usually go by my own judgement with salt. I usually salt lightly when its called for. Then I salt to taste.This was a really fun thing to make as well. Awsome with Naan! ENJOI

Fast and EASY indian recipe....not being a fan of salt and reading the other reviews, i omitted it completely....marinated the chicken over night instead of the reccomended  hour....and baked in the oven at 500 for 10-12 minutes...as it is currently too cold to grill outside....to the sauce i sauted half of a medium size onion in the butter..and followed the instructions accordingly.....

Salt needs to be reduced significantly.  I didn't use any salt in the masala mixture (only in the marinade).  The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and had to diulte the chicken masala with a lot of basmati rice to compensate for the over-salted flavor.  I can't help thinking the salt quantities indicated are a mistake.  It's crazy how salty this is if you follow the recipe.  Other than that, this is a fine recipe.

Great recipe although I agree there the salt should be scaled down, I salted it to taste. I didn't have enough tomato sauce so I added one tomato. I also added one onion, one half green bell pepper and one half red bell pepper. I cooked the breasts in a skillet since it was rainy and I cut the them in small pieces before adding them to the sauce. It was really good. Next day's leftovers even seemed better. Next time I'll try to replace the heavy cream with half-and-half and make a little more sauce. I ate it with yellow fried rice from manjula's kitchen, it was great together !

I love authentic indian food, and this definitely comes close.  I made according to the directions, except for 3 things; 1. i added a can of chickpeas at the very end, 2. I did not have cayenne pepper so it was not as spicy as i would have liked, 2. i added 15oz of tomato sauce and 3/4 cup heavy cream.  The sauce still came out very thick and with great flavor.  Next time i will try substituting yogurt for cream to cut the fat and add ground cashews to the sauce to keep the thickness.  Excellent recipe!

This is the best Indian recipe I have ever found. It is just foolproof (as long as you only salt to taste...)! I never feel like grilling the chicken, so I just cook it on the stove top and it still comes out great! I also never use THAT much cream. It just seems a bit excessive and tastes just as good with about half of it. Usually serve it with either roasted eggplant or zucchini, just b/c they're my favs. :)

This recipe is delicious!  My husband, who supposedly doesn't like Indian food, even enjoys this meal.  It's flavorful and a lot cheaper than going out for Indian food!  The only change I made was to decrease the salt to 1 tsp in the marinade and 1/2 tsp in the sauce.  I serve this with Basmanti rice and naan.

We loved this recipe! Thia was amazingly good. I did make a couple of changes I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp in the marinade and 1/2 tsp in the sauce.  I also substituted garam masala for cinnamon in the marinade and also substituted the cumin in the sauce for 2 tsp of garam masala.
My grill was covered in snow so after marinating the chicken I baked it in the oven on 375 for 40 minutes and it turned out wonderful.

Very Very good. The only change I made was omitting the grilling of the chicken.  I just fried them in a skillet. It would probably be even more flavorful on the grill.

Fantastic recipe especially with the modification of using garam masala for seasoning and omitting most of the salt.  If you double the sauce recipe consider adding ~2c. steamed veggies: cauliflower, potatoes, squash, carrots, etc.

My 4 and 6 year olds both asked what smelled so good when I was cooking it. As is, it's ridiculously salty. I can tell it has tremendous potential, though.  Cutting out most of the salt and subbing gram masala for the cumin and cinnamon should do the trick.

DO NOT USE THE SALT AS DIRECTED!!!! This recipe would have turned out great (possibly even a 5 star) if I had not foolishly followed the directions and added all the salt it called for. I had to throw the whole thing out, it was not edible is that form (which sucked, because it smelled so delicious!). And I normally love salty foods... I am sure the amount specifies must be a mistake. Will try again tomorrow, this time using only a little bit of salt, if any.

Chicken Tikka - 5 stars!
Masala sauce - 1 star! Tasted like a weird enchilada sauce. We threw it out and ate the chicken seperately.

I have been wanting to make an Indian dish for a long time!  I made this last night and it was amazing!!  My BF and I loved it.  I added 1 tsp. of garam masala in place of the cinnamon and I added 1 tsp. to the sauce as well.  I served the chicken over basmati rice and I bought lentils and naan from a local Indian restaurant and it was perfect!  Thank you for this recipe!

I just made this and it turned out very well. It was more spicy than I anticipated, but good nonetheless. However, I'll have to agree with CALIMORTENSON about the recipe being salty. Good thing I didn't add 3 teaspoons of salt in the sauce itself... The marinated chicken turned to be REALLY salty. I think chicken would be perfect with half the amount of salt.

The sauce was to die for - sooo good!  I've never eaten Indian food before and I expected spicy, I like spicy, but WOW this was spicy!!  Just stirring the cold marinade together prompted the entire family one at a time to come downstairs to see what it was - and I hadn't even started cooking yet!  The spiciness was wafting upstairs so strongly my husband even said he might have to replace shingles on the roof! With reactions like that I didn't marinate the full hour and actually *rinsed* some of the marinade off.  We all agreed it had great flavor, but way too spicy.  Next time I will omit the cayenne altogether and add in 1/4 tsp at a time to taste.

I always read reviews before trying new recipes. I know some folks think it unfair to alter recipes, but heck, I know what I like and ingredients are expensive. I omitted salt from the marinade and added only 1/2 t to the sauce. My fav. Indian restaurant adds red pepper and onion so I did too. I also doubled the sauce, and used 1 c whipping cream/ 1 c half & half. I cut back on the cumin and paprika and added Garam Masala, and used 1/2 jalapeno and added cayenne to taste after the chicken had simmered in the sauce. It's really very yummy. Very rich. I think next time I'll use half whipping cream/ half fat free yogurt.

really good EXCEPT the salt.  Way too salty as written.  When I do it again I will put 1/2 tsp salt in the marinade and 1/2 tsp in the sauce.  Other than that it was wonderful!We like our food moderately spicy and this recipe was perfect for our spice preference.

This was very good. I made it for some friends and everyone enjoyed it. I used only 1/2 tsp. of salt. I also omitted the cayenne pepper. It was spicy enough with the jalepeno. I used 1/2 cup cream and 1/2 cup skim milk with a little cornstarch. It was still creamy and rich-tasting. I don't have a grill so I broiled the chicken. It set of the smoke alarm but the chicken turned out good. I also added some frozen veggies at the end and added a little garam masala.

One of the best recipes I've ever had. FANTASTIC! Making this again today.

I did reduce salt and cayenne as other reviewers suggested. I also ended up skipping the skewers. They were problematic.

I'll never have to go to an Indian restaurant again!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful. tasted just like that of an indian restauraunt. I made this with naan bread which is the best combination. I made naan from manjulaskitchen.com. Loved it! Ha Im going to cut down my visits to restauraunts.
Tip: If you think the sauce is too less, add a cup of hot milk with a pinch of salt(optional).

This recipe was really good. I only use half the cumin as recommended (not a big fan). I also added about 3 tablespoons of sugar to the sauce (not marinade) to add some flavor.

This is very good, and very easy. I reduced the salt to 1 tsp in the marinade, and 1/2 in the sauce, and used lime juice instead of lemon. The cilantro really added a nice scent and flavor. I didn't have time to marinate the meat properly, so I coated the diced chicken in the marinade, and then cooked it right in the sauce on the stove top for about 20 minutes - it came out very well.  We'll definitely make this again - very good.

Love the recipe but did make some modifications. I did not use quite as much salt, I used double lemon juice and also when I made the sauce I doubled everything. Other than that it was fabulous!!

I was skeptical when I first read all the rave reviews, because I am addicted to our local Idian restaurant's version of Chicken Tikka Masala...well, this is pretty close to it!  The salt measurement are way off, but other than that this recipe is perfect! Delicious, spicy, mmm...easy to make too.

Excellent. Agree with prior reviewers - do not follow recipe with regard to salt!  I probably used a total of 1/2 a teaspoon between the marinade and the sauce and it was plenty.  So, salt to taste.  I only used 1/4 of a jalapeno - I love spicy food, so next time I will use 1/2 to 3/4.  I also thought the cinnamon taste was overpowering, so next time I will reduce by half.  I did not grill/broil or skewer the chicken, I just sauteed it in some olive oil, it was fine.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T.  You can't really expect 100% authentic flavor without a tandoor oven, etc., but it's pretty darn good anyway.

Yummm.  As with everyone else, I cut back greatly on the salt.  Used maybe 2 teaspoons total (in the marinade, left it out of the sauce).  I got scared off by everyone saying it was too spicy, so I halved all the spices.  Maybe next time I'll perk it back up a little =)  Oh and I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream.  Added a smidgen of cornstarch to make up for it.

My husband really liked this, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars - it's a good dish, but does NOT taste like chicken tikka masala - we now refer to this dish as the "non-CTM CTM". I made it with the full spices (and 1/2 tsp salt in both the marinade and the sauce), and also added in a whole onion and fried it before adding the garlic and jalapeno. I also subbed garam masala for the cinnamon. The chicken had good flavor (I grilled it on the foreman) but the sauce tasted too much like heavy cream, so we ended up adding in an extra can of tomato puree and some red pepper. Even then, I think the sauce needs more. I doubled the sauce as recommended, but then ended up with way too much, so from now on I'll stick with the recipe amount. We'll make it again, but not on the days we're craving chicken tikka!

Fantastic dish. It's so creamy and flavorful; my husband and I have this a lot. Just make sure you salt to taste-very important! I used half the jalapeno too, but otherwise stuck with the recipe. Make sure you don't overcook the chicken; 5 minutes each side max. Serve with Basmati rice and enjoy!!

Excellent recipe.  I modified it by substituting a whole poblano for the the jalapeno and leaving out the cayenne.  Heat was good for kids.  Also ignored the salt quantities.

Excellent, although VERY spicy. It is my favorite at home Indian recipe and I've made it dozens of times. If you are making it for the first time, go easy on the cayenne, paprika, cumin and salt. Add more later if you want it spicier. I make it on the stove top instead of the grill. I also add more chicken and tomato sauce. The chicken is very tender after being marinated in the yogurt and the spicy tomato sauce is restaurant quality. Delicious.

WAY too much salt! The flavor is wonderful, but we couldn't eat more than a bite because it was just much too salty. Really, salt to taste! DO NOT follow the recipe in regards to the salt!

My husband and I love this recipe!  We used the suggestions, cut the salt in half or to none.  Also toned down the spicyness a bit.  We had this dish over butter rice pilaf, great combo.  
I'm a picky eater and he's loves a variety of quality/exotic foods and this worked for both of us! We've made it 3 times in 2 months.

This was fabulous! I've made it three times already. You've definitely got to cut down the salt. I put in 1 tsp for each part and that seemed like enough for me. This was absolutely wonderful...if you like Indian food, you must try this recipe!

This definitely rivals my favorite Indian restaurant in town.  I would give it 5 stars, but I made some modifications, and I'm frightened at how salty this would have been without them.  I followed the advice of many others and eliminated the salt down to 1 tspn in both the marinade and the sauce.  I also used only about 1/2 of the jalapeno so that it wasn't overly spicy.  It was still plenty hot.  To make this a little bit healthier, I used half n half instead of cream and I used non-fat yogurt.  This was still incredibly rich and delicious and I was able to eliminate a lot of the extra fat content.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!

I thought it was fantastic! I didn't add ANY salt (as per other reviewers suggestions)and it was perfect. (I have NO idea why there is so much salt in the original recipe...???) Served it with basmati rice and a tossed salad. 

A note: If you are having company you can grill chicken ahead of time and keep warm in oven or even leave in fridge. Just simmer in sauce a little longer. 

A hit!

This Chicken Tikka Masala is the best I have ever tried, above any Indian restaraunt that I have been to. The spice blend is perfect and when cooking it at home you can vary the quantity of ingredients to customize this dish to your guests liking. I love this recipe exactly the way it is but I make a couple of adjustments, that in my opinion, make this recipe even more delicious. I like to substitute olive oil in place of the butter for a healthier option and I substitute half of the cream for unsweetened coconut milk.Either way I prepare this recipe, it is always a hit!

Oh, my GOSH!  I've never made anything like this before and I absolutely was FLOORED by the wonderfully unique flavor!  This is something I could not WAIT to serve to guests!  I made it along with the Naan recipe and it tasted better than any restaurant I could have gotten it at.  We LOVE this dinner!  Thank you SO much for sharing!

Everyone that tried this enjoyed it. I doubled the chicken but used the same amount of marinade. The yogurt marinade produced moist grilled chicken. 
I added four times the amount of Tomato Sauce & more seasoning (including curry and garam masala). I also substituted fat free half & half for the heavy cream. I recommend that you wait to add the fresh cilantro until you add the chicken so that it's not overpowered by the bolder seasonings in the dish. Overall a simple, delicious recipe if you have those spices in your pantry.

Wow - this is ridiculously good; we will make this again for sure!  I changed the marinade only slightly by reducing the cayenne and black pepper to 1 tsp each and reducing the salt to 1 tsp.  I changed the sauce by omitting the jalapeño, increasing the garlic to 3 cloves, adding a small chopped onion and only adding about 1/2 tsp of sea salt.  I can't even imagine how salty this dish would be if you used all the salt called for (there must be a typo IMHO).  Anyway, it's a really great/easy recipe that we will make again for sure.

This wasn't the best tikka masala I've ever had, but it was pretty good considering it was my first time making it at home.  I read the other reviews about the saltiness, so I only used salt in the marinade and not in the sauce.  It was still pretty salty though, so next time I'd cut that back more.  Also there was not much heat at all, so I'd add more heat for next time.  I'm vegetarian so I made this with a really good locally-made tofu, and it was great in the recipe.  I would also make this again using paneer.

I added the salt to the yogurt marinade but omitted the rest of the salt according to others' suggestions.  Turned out well.  I really like spicy food but my brother-in-law doesn't so I took out the seeds and veins of the pepper.  He still thought it was too spicy but I thought it was about a 3 on a 1-10 spice scale.  This was my first crack at an indian dish and I thought it was really good.  Tasty and interesting combo of spices and a good way to change up the routine.

I thought the sauce was really rich so I served this over rice with some peas and next time I think I'll do a salad and some bread as well and cut back on the portion of chicken tikka on everyone's plate.

I hate giving this only 2 stars just because it sounded like it would be so good to me.  We just did not care for it at all.  Maybe its because we have never had indian food before.  So maybe you have to have an acquired taste for it.  It was very spicy like others said and I definitely didnt put as much salt as it called for.  We took a couple bites of it and then was ready to go on to dessert.  Dont think I will be making this again.

This recipe is great (with the recommended changes).  Just wanted to add - we live in apt and can't grill, so we put the chicken on a baking sheet and put it under the broiler for 5 minutes, turned it once and broiled for 5 more minutes.  Perfection! Especially over jasmine rice.

I read the reviews saying it was too spicy....probably becase the jalapeno was not seeded!!! You must seed the jalapeno and take out the membranes!If this is done the spice is very mild...you could even add more jalapeno(which we did).
Great recipe ,we really enjoyed it with Naan bread and carrot rice.

My husband and I love this recipe.  We changed a few things though...cut the salt down to about 1 tsp, 2 cloves of garlic, and a whole jalapeno, just out of our love for all things spicy. Also, we used non-fat yogurt for both the yogurt and the heavy cream. It came out just as well as when we made it with cream, but much healthier!

I tried this recipe last night because I like indian food but this recipe called for TOOOOOO Much salt. I should have gone with my gut and NOT put the 3tsp of salt as advised. It was TOO TOO salty. The aroma was pleasant and the cilantro was it's saving grace.  The flavor was really subtle but it'm thinking it's b/c of the massive amounts of salt that overpowered the dish. I plan to attempt it again and it's my recommendation to use salt to taste!

I loved this. I cheated on the recipe, though. I had two extra breasts of chicken from grilling the night before so I chopped it up and added a cup of yogurt to it. Then I put all of the ingredients into the pan (only putting a dash of cayenne pepper) and cooked it. I added the chicken after I had let it all simmer and just cooked it until it was heated through. Great flavor!

I was craving this... usually order it from the indian place, but wanted to try and make it. I only used 1 tsp. salt for each sauce, and reduced jalepeno. It's pretty good, still doesn't compare to what I get at the restaurant but still good. I save a little money making it myself and not eating out, so that is good!

We've never had chicken tikka masala before, so I can't speak for the authenticity of it but we loved the dish. We followed as written with the exception of the salt & followed other reviewers suggestions of 1 tsp. on the marinade & 1/2 tsp. on the sauce. We served it over rice with grilled naan on the side - yum! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is the best! I tried it over a year ago when I had friends over. I made a double batch and by the end of the night...there was only a drop left. This is now a signature dish of mine and when I talk with friends they all ask me when I am making this again. A definite keeper! I made some alterations to it. DO NOT add the salt in the sauce. If people like a lot of salt let them add it at their leisure. Soak the skewers for 20 min as to avoid a fire hazard. In the sauce I added cayenne as needed as well as cumin and pepper. In addition to what was mentioned in the recipe. I would not recommend going over 1/2 tsp each time you add. Wait about two min for the spices to soak in during the simmer and taste. I also used Fat Free Half n' Half. I tried Milk but I didn't get the same consistency. This way I cut the calories significantly while still keeping the thickness of the sauce.

Very good tasting recipe, however there is way too much salt. I would more than half the salt next time. Also, I don't have a BBQ so I cooked the chicken in a skillet on the stove. Turned out perfect. Cilantro is a perfect finishing touch.

As written this recipe is NOT EDIBLE. I would say for two reasons, 1 being the salt and 2 being that it is too spicy. I enjoy spicy food but it must have flavor and not just burn in your mouth flavor. I am from Southerm California so jalapenos are nothing new too me but for Chicken Tikka Masala as written it is unpleasantly spicy. I augmented the recipe as follows: used some salt, about 1 teaspoon for marinade and a pinch here and there for the sauce. I had to make about 4 times the amount of sauce because it was not edible as written so i added more heavy cream (1 quart total) and more tomatoes. I did not use canned tomato sauce- i used canned tomatoes that i crushed. I added about 1/2 a teaspoon more of paprika and a tablespoon of sugar  along with some ground ginger because of all the extra liquid i added. The sauce was super creamy and spicy and tasty. I also baked the chicken and used chicken tenderloins that i pounded down a bit and cut and half- this way when i marinated for an hour the marinade did its job well b/c the chicken was small. I baked at 400 and then quickly pan fried for some color. I would also add that the cinnamon in the marinade is overwhelming and I would omit it altogether if i chose to utilize the marinade again. The sauce is pretty good and when tossed with the chicken it really doesnt matter if the chicken was marinated or not- i would say if you grill go ahead and marinade but remove the cinnamon it adds a bizarre flavor.

This is a great recipe!  I've made it several times and have always received rave reviews.  You know to cut back on the salt and add garam masala.  The chicken is so tasty you can just use the marinade recipe for grilling if you don't want to make the sauce.  I love it both ways!  Thanks for the recipe.  It's fabulous!

This is my husband's new favorite recipe!  The first time I made it exactly as written and it was simply outstanding.  After that, I tried to cut down on the fat by substituting 1% milk for heavy cream and using corn starch to thicken.  I also added about and extract 1/4 cup of tomato sauce.  While it wasn't as rich as the original, it was still great and a lot less fattening.  I have used chicken, pork and lamb with this and they all work great, although I like lamb the best.  I also double the sauce so there's plenty of extra to use with basmati rice or veggies.  Thank you for a truly excellent recipe.

This was my first attempt at anything like this. It came out SO wonderful. I used 1 tsp of salt in the marinade and 3/4 tsp in the sauce. I left the chicken in the marinade for about 24 hours and it came out moist and really flavorful. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I really loved this recipe. I decided to cook the marinated chicken pieces in a skillet with a small amount of olive oil.  After they were fully cooked and slightly browned on each side, I added them to the sauce. I did not need to double the sauce but I added 3 tsp of garam masala and omitted the salt.  When I made the marinade I only used 1/4 tsp of cayenne which, to me, was the perfect amount of heat.  I served this over basmati rice.  Yakuta, thank you for a really wonderful recipe.

I give this five stars after the salt modification (reading other reviews, I added 1/2 tsp for the marinade, as well as 1/2 tsp for the sauce).  I thought that was perfect.  If you like spicy food, the spice is perfect.  If not, cut back because it is quite warm!  Also, I know its typical of the region, but I didn't care for the cinnamon in it.  I didn't think you'd actually be able to taste it in the final result, but you could.  Next time I will leave it out all together (just personal preference).  This recipe is awesome!!

This recipe was just as good as going to a good Indian restaraunt. I took some of the suggestions and omitted a lot of the salt. I also cut down on the heat and used green chiles instead of jalepenos and cut down on the cayenne because I have young children. I marinated the chicken for 24 hours and it had a great flavor. My whole family loved it, even my little kids who are sometimes hard to please. I'll definitely make it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe; my young children even loved it.  I omitted some of the salt as to previous suggestions.  I also only added about half the cayenne pepper and I added green chilies instead of jalapeno, so it wouldn’t be as hot.   I served it with chapati bead. I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty, although it didn't quite taste like the Chicken Tikka Masala at my favorite Indian restaurants. There's some ingredient they use that I can't identify, despite a familiarity with Indian spices, that makes the restaurant versions jazzier. Still, this was very good.

I omitted some salt, and used Greek yogurt. It's thicher richer, but less sweet than regular yogurt. You can find it at Whole Foods.

I cook a lot for me and my fiance, but this recipe tops almost anything else I've ever made. Like most other people who commented, I greatly reduced the salt. I used about 1 tsp of kosher salt in the marinade and none in the sauce.  I also halved the cayenne and left out the jalapeno since I like spice, but I don't have a high tolerance for it. Next time I might double the sauce for the amount of chicken it says to use so there's enough to soak into the rice too. But other than that, great recipe! This with some basmati rice and garlic naan from Trader Joe's is a to die for dinner!

My boyfriend and I LOVED this recipe!  So happy I can make it at home and not have to go out.  A COUPLE THINGS: I only used 1/2 a tsp of salt in each the marinade and sauce.  Also, it is VERY spicy this way; I had to stop eating it.. next time I'll reduce the Cayenne at least by half, and seed the jalepeno...I also left out the ginger because I didn't have any, but I couldn't taste the difference.  A great recipe!!

Chicken tikka masala is one of my absolute favorite foods of all time, and I've been dying to make it for several months now. I heeded the advice of the other commenters and greatly reduced the amount of salt, and indeed, could have done without it completely. And while the marinade for the chicken was quite good, I would absolutely suggest leaving out the jalapeno pepper from the sauce. I love a good jalapeno, but it just doesn't work here; it detracts from the wonderful Indian flavors in the dish.

I made this recipe for a holiday party.  YUMM!!  It was a hit.  I will say that it turned out too be little spicy for me, but was great. It turned out as close as I am going to get at my local indian restaurant.  I will use this recipe again.  To cut back on the kick you can reduce the cayenne in the marinade or use less jalepeno when cooking it.

Excellent recipe.  I made several adaptations- marinated the chicken overnight and carefully broiled them due to lack of access to a grill.  Additionally i didnt have fresh lemons on hand so omitted the lemon juice.  With these modifications this was hailed as better than many restaurant versions.  Thanks for the recipe, it will become a favorite in my house.

This was my first time cooking Indian food, and it tasted great!  My husband and I agreed that we no longer need to go to our favorite Indian restaurant to get a similar-tasting (if not better!) recipe.  Thank you to all reviewers who advised to cut down on the salt (I used 1 tsp in the marinade and 1 tsp in the sauce).  Since it was cold outside and our grill is cumbersome, we simply grilled on the skewers on our George Foreman grill, and, to suit our tastes, reduced the cayenne pepper to half.  Still quite spicy with the full jalepeno, but perfect for us! Thank you so much for sharing!

This was pretty good.  I omitted the salt as others suggested.  I added some garam marsala to the sauce, because it was just tasting too much like tomato sauce as is.  If I were to make this again, I would double the sauce to serve with naan bread.

Wonderful! My chicken pieces were marm. for 2days. I used 1 can diced tomato and half-&-half with creamy result. The grilled-flavor is intensified the next day! Good make ahead recipe. Now I can enjoy this dish whenever I want at home!

This recipe is awesome!  I order this dish everytime we go to our favorite Indian restaurant and this recipe tastes just as good.  My husband is Indian and loves spicy food so I actually use a little more cayenne pepper, but like a lot of others, I don't use any salt.  It tastes wonderful without any.  I also double the sauce.  We both like to eat it with naan and dip it in the sauce.  The sauce also thickens after refrigerated if there are any leftovers.  I am so glad that I found this recipe.

This was excellent, my husband said he would eat it once a week. I was hoping my younger daughter could eat it so I left out the cayenne/jalepeno. Even without those it was too spicy for a toddler. I also followed everyone else's advice and cut marinade salt in half and only used salt to taste in the sauce. I wouldn't add any salt to the sauce until after you add the chicken as the salt from the marinade will carry over.

So yummy!  I have to cut down on the spice a little bit because of my very young children with sensitive tongues.  Also, to the sauce I add a handful of raisins, 2 tsp. garam masala and 2 tsp. sugar.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and cut way down on the salt--1 tsp. for the yogurt mixture and 1/2 tsp. for the sauce.  I serve this with Indian vegetable rice that I found on this website.  My family absolutely loves this recipe.  It has become a frequent meal in our list of dinners!!

I make this dish ALL the time along with a variety of other Indian dishes. I agree with another reviewer, there is WAAAY too much salt in this recipe. Perhaps it was a typo in the recipe? Either way, just cut the salt down to a tsp. or so and add more if you prefer saltier. I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the salt.

This is definitely one of the easier Tikka Masala recipes I've come across, and it tastes great. I made it for a party last Saturday, and everyone came back for seconds. 

Aside from the notes everyone else has made about salt quantities, two things I would note: 

1) If you are scaling this recipe up, increase the cumin in the sauce recipe by  2/3 instead of 1:1. We found when eating leftovers that the cumin became an overwhelming flavor. 

2. I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream, which gave the sauce a lighter and slightly thinner texture. Worked very well. 

I will definitely make this recipe again.

I have made this recipe many, many times, and I did not put nearly as much salt in as the recipe called for!  I also used light cream instead of the heavy cream, and a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce if needed. This is one of mine and my husbands favorite recipes!!!

My father LOVES LOVES LOVES spicy food. He can take anything. In comparison, my mother and I.. well, we dont exactly favor the taste. However, my father had been pleading for days to go to an Indian restaurant, so I finally decided to just make him something. A few reviews said that it wasn't that bad, so I decided to try it. My brother, who can take most spicy food, loved it. My father, though, said it was "spicy" but not "hot." To cut to the chase, there were too many ingredients, luckily I had most of them. It was getting a bit late though, so I made everything very quickly. The result may have turned out better. But we feel sorry for the people in Indian restaurants - what they have to go through for this!

This was out of this world. I cut the salt big time as reccomended. I also added a teaspoon of masala to the sauce. It was wonderful. I don't do hot and spicy well and this was perfect. Just enough bite but you could still taste all the flavors. Hubby said "that was really good".
I will make this one again.

Oh my goodness! This is just heaven on a plate! So good, it has all these wonderful flavors melding together. Don't be intimidated by other reviews stating that this is spicy, this can easily be remedied by removing the seeds and the ribs of the jalapeno. Also I agree with alot of the reviews in regards to the amount of salt listed. I cut it down to about 1/2 the salt and it still seemed like to much. Next time I will take out more. The salt issue is the only reason I only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. I plan on making this next time I have company for dinner.

This was so delicious...I made the following changes:
1/2 tsp salt only in sauce, not in marinade..
Skipped out on all the spices, and used Patak's Garam Masala (2TBS) in marinade, and half the cayenne. Stuck the ginger in the food processer, and let it sit for 2 hours. 
Used a primo basmati rice, expensive, but well worth it. 
Used 3 cloves of garlic, and 1 tsp of paprika (no jalepeno)
Used the Foreman grill to cook up the chicken too! Double the sauce though!!!
Took rad Naan recipe off this site, and there was nothing left!!
yum

OMG the salt is just WAY too much!  My poor husband cooked all day long to prepare a special meal for us, and didn't read the reviews on the recipe.  As written, it is absolute garbage, but if the salt is scaled way back (no more than 1 tsp - 1/2, marinade and 1/2 sauce) I'm sure it will be much better.  If the recipe read as such, I'd have given it 4 stars, possibly 5, but in all good conscience, the way it's written, I cannot give it more than 1 star.

This recipe was AWESOME!! My boyfriend was so impressed, we won't be ordering Indian takeout for awhile! A couple changes: definitely no more than 1 tsp of salt for both the marinade and the sauce, and I used garam masala in place of the cinnamon. I also added 1 tsp of the masala to the sauce, and halved the pepper. Please try this - you won't be disappointed! :)

Fantastic!  I took other's advice and only used 1 tsp salt in the marinade and none for the sauce. I like salt and it was plenty flavorful enough.  For the sauce, I used 2 tsp. garam masala (penzeys.com has awesome spices), 3 cloves garlic, 2 cans of tomato sauce, 1 1/2 cups cream, 1/2 tsp cumin.  I also added 3 chopped plum tomatoes to heated through sauce for some texture. Next time I'll add some fresh mushrooms too. Excellent dish - better than we can get in Indian restaurants here in Cleveland area.  My friends were thrilled! TY:)  Add Traders Joe's naan bread and some saffron rice - heaven!

Made this for dinner the other night, and it was a hit.  It's not the restaurant style that I'm used to, but still very tasty.  Only modifications I made:  I used shrimp instead of chicken, and used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream.

I cut down the salt by half and it was still too much. Next time I'll omit it in the marinade. I also substituted heavy cream for evaporated milk and it still thickened well.

It's good, but not as good as the Chicken Tikka Masala I've had in restaurants.  This one was much more spicy than the dishes I've had which were much more mild tasting and you could taste more of the tomato/cream sauce flavor.  I would definitely cut down on the amount of cumin and paprika that go into the final sauce by half at least.  It's a good base recipe though.  It's one that you just have to change to make it your own.

My husband and I LOVE indian food. And this recipe was great.  I took the suggestion of others and did not add anymore salt to the sauce, but i did use it in the marinate.  Very very good.  I served this with cumine rice from this site.  It was a hit! I think we won't be going out for Indian food for a while.

Y-U-M-M-Y!  After reading the previous reviews, I took everyone's advice and cut back on the salt, maybe 1/2 tsp for the chicken marinade and another 1/2 tsp for the sauce, and I doubled the sauce recipe, which makes plenty for spooning over rice!  I did cut back on the jalepeno a bit, I think the pepper I bought was just spicier than usual and I didn't want to ruin the batch.  Anyway, good recipe and I think it's as close as I am going to get to restaurant quality unless I get a tadoori oven installed in my kitchen!  I can't wait to entertain with this one, and it's definitely going to be a new staple in my recipe box!

Very good!  It was a little too cinammon-y, but it was not bad - I'll only use half the amount next time. I did tweak this a little - substituted the heavy cream for fat-free yogurt, and I still ended up with a nice sauce. Completely omitted the salt. I added yellow and orange peppers, and used green onion instead of a regular onion.  Served with a curried couscous and Naan bread.

I have eliminated salt from this recipe completely.  With all the other spices in the dish it was salty enough.  Also, the cumin when making your sauce can be toned down to your "heat preference".  Love this recipe and make it at least once a month.

I loved it. I did think there was too much salt in so when i made it again i didn't put as much in. It was very hot for me so I did add more yoghurt so it wasnt as hot. But over all i liked it i will be doing it again!

My hubby absolutely loved it.  He's such a Tikka Masala fan and very picky. I read all the reviews and am thankful that I curbed the salt on this recipe.  I used from a 3rd - 1/2 of salt that was recommended by the recipe.  And I also used half of the amount of cayenne pepper. The results was very pleasing and tasty. I am now prepping the chicken to cook it tomorrow for my hubby when he gets back from his business trip, as he requested. We had left overs for the next day, and it tasted even better after slowly reheating it in a pot.

This recipe is great, but definitely do not use as much salt as suggested. I have made the recipe many times, and every time my Indian friends say it is the best Chicken Tikka Masala they have ever tasted!! I double the sauce recipe though. The sauce is so tasty over white rice.

I really hate to leave a bad review but I was really looking forward to this dish tasting just like it does at an Indian restaurant. I read a lot of the reviews before I cooked it and I really wanted to like this but it just came out "okay." Sorry but I wasn't impressed. I did use the advise on using less salt! Good thing I did. Perhaps using a little less cumin would be a good idea too, it was kind of overpowering. At least I tried :)

OMIT SALT!!!!  This recipe was amazing!  I did not add the salt as other suggested and it came out great!  I think if that much salt had been added it would have been WAY too salty!  I added a bit of curry powder and baked the chicken rather than grilling it.  Overall, it was fantastic and I will make it again and again!  Thanks!

There was a point where the sauce wasn't quite right so I took my spice rack and ran with it. This was a wonderful way to get the meal started, but it didn't bring it home, if you know what I mean. I'll make it again - because it's simpler than the food-processor methods - but this isn't the best.

May have been delicious but even cutting the salt requirements to 1/3, it was barely edible.  Leave out the salt entirely.  This is a salty dish.  My wife, kids, and I could not manage to eat it.  It looked absolutely spot on though, and shamefully, the smell was terrific.  Overbearing with salt.  Not sure if I will ever even try this one again.  Am tempted strongly to omit all spice requirements on both end and replace with indian curry and absolutely NO additional salt. Yech.

This was great!  I did follow the recommendations and omitted the salt from the sauce but did add it to the marinade; chicken really needs the salt to make it really tender.  OK, I didn't have yogurt and used sour cream, didn't have cilatro and used parsley, didn't have heavy cream and used ½ and ½, didn't have jalapenos and left them out and it was still plenty spicy!  I have been spoiled by Indian fare in Europe and this was a much better alternative to the local Indian restaurant in Annapolis!  Thanks-it was easy too!

I eliminated all the salt in the recipe, and this came out fantastic! Next time I'll make it, I will double or even triple the recipe. This is perfect to bring to lunch and be the envy of all co-workers. I love Indian food, and although this tasted similar to my favorite restaurant's, I think I actually like this better! Thank you soooo much for this recipe. I served it with jasmine saffron rice and a green salad and it was a hit! Oh, and I also broiled the chicken on their skewers instead of grilling it. And I let it marinate for 24 hours. I also didn't have any jalapeno, so I used scotch bonnet peppers (Jamaican hot peppers) and it was super spicy - JUST how I love it!

I love Tikka Masala and was looking for an easy recipe to replicate at home.  This was it!  After reading the reviews, I cut the salt in half for the marinade and omitted it altogether in the sauce.  I also omitted the cayenne and the jalapeño pepper to keep the heat down for the younger taste buds in my family.  Everyone loved it.  But everyone also thought the chicken skewers just off the grill would be great alone.

Lose the salt! I left out the jalapeno, doubled the sauce and used fat free half & half and light coconut milk.  I also mixed in some spinach and used an onion.  It is now my husbands favorite recipe- YUM!

I agree with all of the other comments: lose most of the salt. I love salt and I couldn't even eat more than a few mouthfuls of this dish before sending it to the bin. When I remade the dish with only a pinch of salt, it was great! I used a can of tomato soup instead of tomato sauce, added garlic to the marinade and added garam masala to the sauce. Yum!

I consider myself a chicken tikka masala expert because I get it at every indian resaurant and this recipe was amazing.  If it's too spicy, take out the seeds in the jalepeno.  I would recommend not adding any salt to the sauce.  The chicken has plenty.

THIS WAS REALLY REALLY GOOD! We eat a lot of Indian food and this could have easily made it into the buffet rotation. I followed the recipe pretty closely, except for the sauce I added a bit more jalapeño to spice it up a bit, tossed in a handful of cubed tomatoes and added only 1 tsp of salt (next time, I will not add any salt). Instead of using a skillet, I threw all of the ingredients for the sauce into a slow cooker. Cooked the sauce on low for a while and when the chicken was done, I tossed the pieces in there too for a couple of hours. My wife stopped by the local Indian restaurant and picked up some samosas and naan. This was an awesome dinner! We will make this recipe again.

I really enjoyed this, although I did make a few changes.  I reduced the salt drastically, and instead of using cream I stirred in fat-free plain yogurt after taking the sauce of the stove.  It worked wonderfully.  I wasn't crazy about the pronounced cinnamon flavor on the chicken, so I may eliminate that when I make this again.  I'll also add garlic to both the chicken marinade and the sauce.  I really felt like it needed garlic.

I really enjoyed this recipe but I made a few adjustments. I took most people's suggestion and barely added any salt.  I also thought there was a bit too much cumin and would reduce next time I make it. I think I will use crushed tomatoes next time to give it more texture, and I used 5% cream to keep the fat down. The sauce is so tasty that I recommend making twice as much as the recipe calls for so you can sop it up with naan.

This was awesome!  I actually did not change the recipe at all.  It tastes exactly like the Chicken Tikka Masala at our local Indian Restaurant.

Sooo good!  Tastes just like the kind from my fave Indian restaurant!  Only thing I've changed is less salt (of course) and I add an onion and green, and red peppers to the marinade.  Our grill hasn't been working, so I bake the chicken and veggies in the oven.  Makes the recipe a little larger for when you have guests, and a bit healthier too!

This recipe was good but did not taste like the Tikka Masala I get at Indian restaurants. It may have been because I didn't marinate the chicken for long enough. I will probably keep looking for a chicken tikka recipe and would not make this one again.

Fantastic!  The only thing I changed was the amount of salt... 7 tsp of salt is OVERKILL!!  Definitely add salt to your taste, not the recommended amount.

Awesome recipe -- I made a few minor alterations though.  I add an extra 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, add more garlic, and cut the salt in half.  Comes out perfect every time!

This receipe looks complicated, but when I started throwing all the ingrediants together, it was cake.  I used 2 teaspoons of salt instead of the four it called for to marinate, and it turned out wonder.  Pretty spicy, so for all you mild eaters out there, I would cut the pepper ingrediants in half.  All in all it was absolutley wonderful.  I will cook this again and again!  Thank you!!

I loved this! I doubled the sauce as others suggested, cut the salt at least in half, and kept the rest of the spices as written. I didn't have tomato sauce on hand so used a can of stewed instead. Absloutely delicious.

Excellent. Not quite restaurant style, but very good nonetheless, and easy to make. Per the suggestions, I cut down my salt a lot, using 2 tsp in the marinade and .5 in the sauce. It came out pretty well, but still a touch salty--I can't imagine what it would have been like with the full amount!

I definitely took the suggestion of reducing the salt. I used only 2 tsp of salt in the marinade and no salt in the sauce.  I also reduced the "spicey-ness" in half.  This is filling!  I would also use a bit less chicken so that there would be more sauce to mix with our Indian Rice (Trader Joes).  We'll serve it for our Indian loving relatives!

I wish I would've read the reviews first. I found it perfect in the spicyness department, but WAY too salty and could have benefitted from some authentic Indian spices. It doesn't taste like the chicken tikka masala at the restaurant and it isn't supposed to. This is a homestyle recipe. Just like in the states, a dish at a restaurant and a dish made at home taste different. My Indian boyfriend liked it, he says it's just like his uncle makes.

I'm not sure what I'm missing here... but I couldn't eat this. My husband ate his, but wasn't crazy about it. I love tikka masala - we have eaten it at many Indian restaurants over the years in Portland, San Francisco, Reno (I'm not completely oblivious to what it should taste like) - but this was just too spicy and too wierd tasting. Don't know how else to describe it. I cut down on the salt and most of the spices by a little while I was preparing it - and it was still too much. Very disappointing - lot's of work and it looked fabulous on the plate and then it was barely edible.

Wow, really good!  I didn't have cayenne, so I substituted red pepper flakes.  I also used half the salt called for.  Still turned out great.  This goes very well with the raita recipe on this site.

This recipe is a keeper.  My husband is a tough critic and he thought this was as good, if not better, than our favorite local spot for Indian.  Like the other reviews, I cut back on the salt considerably.  (2 t. for the marinade, and 1 t. for the sauce)  It was excellent as it was, but next time I am going to try to substitute 1/2 of the cream for coconut milk.  Thanks for the recipe.

Outstanding... I had no problems with the salt... just remember to scrape most of the marinade off of the chicken before cooking it.  I also reduced the sauce's salt to 1 tsp.  Served with basmati rice and naan bread (both available at Trader Joe's in CA), and I was suddenly at my favorite Indian restaurant!

This has to be my all time favorite recipe!!! I took the recipe with me to my sisters last year and made it for her family and friends and it has now become one of their favorites too! I don't always bbq the chicken I just cook it on the stove. It is heavenly! Thank you!

This was awesome!!  The only thing missing was the naan!  Perhaps next time I make this (and there will be a next time) I'll try and make the bread too.  I followed the recipe exact, with the exception of the salt.  I added to taste as suggested.  I just wish I would have thought of the naan before I made this tonight.... Thanks so much for the post!

This recipe was great! I've been looking and experimenting with other recipes and this one is the very closest I have come to the restaurant version. A couple changes I made, I added some sugar, about 1 1/2 T.  And also I did use coconut milk. Very creamy! One thing to be careful of is make sure that you use tomato SAUCE NOT PASTE!!! Or it will come out VERY tomatoish. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Wonderful and spicy. I'm a new cook, and this impressed everyone at my Oscar party! Made it the day before and served over jasmine rice. 

Just like the Indian restaurant. Follow advice about not using all the salt in the recipe--I just used a pinch whenever any salt was called for. I added a can of coconut milk, followed by a can of tomato paste at the very end to thicken it up a bit. I can't wait to make it again -- in fact, I think I'll make it tomorrow, and I'll triple the recipe to freeze the leftovers. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

I lived in Scotland for 4 years and since the UK has a large Indian population, there's a lot of delicious Indian food there.  I have really missed chicken tikka masala.  This was good but not as good as the real deal.  A very tasty indian flavored dish for sure!

One of the best things I've ever made.  I used a family size George Foreman Grill - doubled the recipe - cooked 4 skewers at a time for 10 minutes each, then simmered in the sauce as directed.

Once again, absolutely amazing.  I used to use canned curry and tikka sauces, this put them to shame!

Need to cut back on the salt by at least half.  Besides that it was great.

This is absolutly the best recipe on this entire site!  I don't know about all of that salt but I ignored the 4 teaspoons and only added to taste.  I also added cauliflower to the sauce to give it some life.

Worked out very well for me. The "ready in 2h20" is exaggerated though, steps 2 and 3 can be run in parallel. Served with pitta warmed over the grill to mop up the sauce!

This is a good recipie.  I don't have access to a grill so I sauteed the chicken after marinating it and it turned out really well.  I also didn't use that much salt. Where it said to add multiple teaspoons, I substituted a few shakes instead.  Thanks for the recipie!

WOW, a lot of salt suggested.  I didn't use any.  A lot of steps involved in the making of this recipe.  It tasted pretty good, just don't know if it was worth all the fuss: making the marinate, 1 hour marinate, then grilling, then making the sauce, then simmering in the sauce.  My boyfriend liked the chicken off the grill, was a really spicy chiken, may try the marinate on a kabob some time.

Great recipe tried it and it’s authentic. Pls note, key to Indian cooking is ensuring the spices are well cooked(may require more oil and butter as it cooks) before adding other ingredients. Instructions did not specify this but for those not used to Indian cooking this is important to note. Anyway, wonderful recipe, I cooked the chicken in an “air frier” instead of outdoor grill.

Everything about this dish is spot on. It's easy to make, uses simple ingredients (all of which I could find at a cheap grocery store), and tastes incredible. I'm no cook myself, but I do know how chicken tikka masala is supposed to taste, and this receipe nails it on the head.

NOTE: I had no problem with the salt as many other reviewers seem to have. My assumption is that the receipe was adjusted to remove most of the salt, so as far as I'm concerned following the ingredients and instructions word for word makes a fantastic meal.

Such a good recipe! For any non-dairy consumers... you can replace the yogurt with almondmilk plain yogurt, use any plant-based butter, and coconut cream to replace the heavy cream. The recipe turns out a little sweet, but still delicious!

Oh my god 10 out of 10. Per recommendations I cut out all the added salt and I also cut the spicy things to about half and it was perfect. I didn’t want to grill so I baked it at 425 for about 15 minutes. This is a new go to recipe

Followed the recipe exact except used 2 cloves of garlic. Turned out absolutely perfect!  We love Indian food and this tasted exactly like our favorite restaurant version. Served it with organic long grain rice and plain naan bread. So good!  Highly recommend.

I made this following a few of the suggestions from the other comments. I cut down on the spiciness of the recipe cause I have little kids. My 3 year  old loved it. We add cauliflower and it was a big hit. My 3 year old got seconds too.

So delicious!  I made this for our son and his family while visiting.  They said it was very delicious and authentic flavor with the lovely spices and fresh garlic and ginger. Served this dish with grilled red onions, squash, zucchini and peppers and grilled naan bread. Family asked me to save the recipe to make again.

I did change it up a bit. I did the yogurt marinade then let it marinade for a bit, then i chopped the jalapeno & the threw the spices that were suppose to be in the frying pan into a crock pot with the marinated chicken, (no need for the butter since your not softening the jalapenos) added the tomatoe sauce & heavy cream, mixed and let it cook for about 3 hrs. I really thought the chicken was goin to shread to bits but it stayed cubed. I loooove love love it in the crock pot much better. Its easier & super tender this way

I’ve never had chicken tikka masala as there are not many opportunities for Indian food in small town South Carolina. I wanted to try something different and I’m so glad I did!! I absolutely loved this and will be making it again and again. I couldn’t find Garam Masala in the stores here so I was happy to find this recipe that doesn’t use it- I felt with the ginger and cinnamon the different flavor profile I was looking for was still there. I cooked my chicken on the outdoor grill and used low-fat Greek yogurt in the marinade, refrigerated overnight. I cut back to one tsp of cayenne and one tsp of black pepper as I was scared of the heat, I thought it was flavorful but not hot this way. If I’m feeling sassy I might try both teaspoons next time. I also diced up a whole onion and added it to the sauce just because I had it and I like onions. Any changes I made were just for circumstances, the recipe is wonderful as written and I definitely recommend trying it. Serve with lots of white rice!

I just added in some veggies as i normally do with curries (bell peppers + onions) and there was still plenty of sauce to coat everything!
The marinade for the chicken was so yummy! I loved the way it made the house smell when it was cooking. :)

I've used this as my basic recipe several times now, I bump the spices up a LOT but it's a good base.

Oh and I never use canned tomatoes, only from the garden, then strain out the skins and seeds after pureeing them with a hand mixer.

I've made this probably 15+ times so far. It's one of my favorite dishes! I don't put in the amount of salt that is written though, as it is too much for me.

Awesome BUT the directions say to season the sauce with 3 tsp of salt, should say just 1 tsp salt.  Then adjust and add salt as/if necessary after the curry has simmered for awhile.  Made with garbanzo beans (1+ can) that were covered in the ingredients of the marinade (in rough proportions).

the total amount of spices  is too much , it depends on the person taste , I wouldn’t recommend people follow the exact amount.

Just put your own personal amount as much as you prefer to taste  it. 
Think of it like how much sugar  would you put in your own cup of tea,
 Same  goes for salt and pepper in your own food, some perfer salty some prefer very spicy some prefer medium or large low salt. 
Food not always following the exact receipe 
Just get the main  idea and put your own touch and taste like an artist with passion.

So by the reviews i was a little disappointed. We love Indian food and eat Tikka Masala quite frequently at our local Indian restaurants .  I made a few very minor changes the recipe granted but these changes wouldn't have affected the final result. 1st i put red food coloring in the marinade for the chicken to get the classic red color in the chicken (think tandori chicken). I also grilled the chicken over charcoal to impart that smokey flavor that i love.  So what i didn't like about it. The quantity of spices. Its not that it was spicy (i love hot food) its that it had way to many spices (cumin, cinnamon, ect...) in both the marinade for the chicken and in the sauce.  I was thinking this while i was making it but decided to make it exactly as the recipe called for. If your making it you should either decrease the amount of spices of find another recipe.

Excellent and authentic recipe.  I like real Indian food and the heat in this recipe is perfect.  Double the amount of sauce for extra on rice and with naan.  Cut salt in half.   Also, sub garam masala instead of cinnamon

This was fantastic! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used only 1 teaspoon of salt in the marinade and a sprinkle in the sauce. I was out of lemon juice and garlic so I substituted lemon juice with orange juice and just didn't use garlic. My family isn't a fan of spiciness so I didn't put in any cayenne pepper and used 1 red hot thai pepper. Less authentic, maybe, but still pretty good! I also didn't have a grill so I just used a cookie rack over a cookie sheet. Served it with naan and basmati rice

Where I live, Indian food is, not that well known or popular. And rather pricy. My wife likes this recipe and so do our friends. Watch the cayenne when serving people that have not eaten (British) Indian food before.

This was absolutely wonderful, though a bit underspiced for my taste. Also being on a special diet I substituted the salt for Nu Salt which made it taste weird. Next time I'll use half the amount of actual salt.

I added more spice and less salt than the recipe calls for a my family and I did not find it spicy enough the first time we made it, the only reason we cut back on the salt is because my brother has sodium issues. It was a great recipe and better than some of the other tikka masalas we have tried and made! I would highly recommend it to anyone! It is so good we r planing on making it next week again!

I made this tonight, and at first it was too salty, a common complaint I've read about in many of the Tikka Masala dishes - which I suspect is the way some prefer it.  Me - not so much - so once I resolved this issue for my taste buds by adding 3 teaspoons of sugar - this turned out to be a very well done recipe. Perfect balance of heat/spice without being overbearing.

Delicious. Easy. All guests loved it. 
Instead of grilling, I used frying pan. Cooked for about 15 minutes, then added the sauce and simmered for about 10 minutes. It will be on our regular menu for certain.

I've made this a few times and it's as good as it is at my favorite Indian restaurant. I leave out the jalapeno and it's the perfect balance of spice and flavor for me. You can halve the Cayenne if you really don't like spicy food. I broil the chicken on wire racks over a pan in the oven instead of using skewers on the grill. I usually double the sauce (remember to double the sauce spices, too) because I love having extra to dip some naan or garlic bread in. This is a great dish to introduce people to Indian food.

This recipe got ruined by the 3 teaspoons of salt added to the end part. I'm a salt addict and had to almost spit it out. Next time, I will forego adding the 3 teaspoons of salt to the sauté. And maybe even cut some of the salt in the marinade.  Other than that, it would have been excellent.

This was awful. I don't know why it has so many good reviews. I eat this dish a lot, and I decided I'd try this recipe - God, it was so salty and so CUMINY. This is a cheap copy that's great if you don't actually have taste buds and have never tried the real thing.

Tasted great!!!
***WARNING*** Cut the salt in the tomato cream sauce portion down to 1 tsp. I used the full amount the first time around and ruined a batch of sauce. Recipe amount is way too salty. Luckily I tasted it before  adding the marinated/grilled chicken skewers to it.

This was really easy! I'm definitely making this again.

I made significant changes:

-  I didn't use canned tomatoes. Instead, I put something like 18 roma tomatoes in the instant pot for half an hour and squished them. I then reduced the liquid considerably.

- I eyeballed the amount of cream to use, but for 18 roma tomatoes it was about a pint.

- I significantly increased the amount of garlic: five cloves in the sauce.

- Instead of jalapeno, I used two serrano peppers. My partner thought it was too much, so next time I'll make a batch of one pepper and then a batch for me with five peppers.

- Swapped the chicken for tofu, which I marinated raw and then pan fried with olive oil.

Four stars as written because the salt is overpowering!  Leave it out when cooking the butter/spices/sauce/cream/chicken.  I prefer to swap out the jalapeno for an onion and cut the cumin/paprika in half.  Just my personal preference.  It's delicious, though!  Glad to have a great base recipe as otherwise I wouldn't know where to start!

Extra points for it being simple to make (versus many other Chicken Tikka Masala recipes.) I grilled the chicken on the BBQ which definitely helps give it a more authentic flavor. It is a bit lacking in some of the complexity of spice that more "authentic" recipes have but if you want to whip up a quick Indian dish on a weeknight this does the trick nicely.

The actual ingredients show less salt than the instructions, use that & do not over salt, I suspect its a typo. 1 Teaspoon in the Marinade & 1 in the Sauce is more than enough. 
This will turn out way better than most Indian restaurants.

Salt amounts were fine.  I didn't have cilantro and I made a double batch of sauce. I mostly followed the recipe but just realized I forgot the pepper in the marinade.  I'm not sure if the recipe has been updated but the salt amounts were fine.  I used 1 teaspoon salt in the marinade and about 1 teaspoon salt in the sauce after doubling it.  It was too spicy/hot for my family so next time I'm going to cut way back on the heat.

Really delicious recipe! I had to make several changes because I'm a college student and have little supplies (so no grill). I also quartered the recipe (but I only halved the sauce), and I omitted the yogurt and lemon juice to make a kind of dry rub (using red pepper flakes instead of cayenne pepper), which I ended up marinating for 9 hours or so.

The only problem I had was that my sauce ended up separating from the oil and was no longer really a sauce--I'm not exactly sure where I went wrong, but I'm guessing it had to do with me quartering the recipe and still simmering for the same amount of time? But it didn't detract from the taste at all, which was great! I served this with naan and it made it even better. I'll definitely make this again!

Nice and creamy, and easy on the tongue! I do disagree with many of those who say that there is too much salt though. I went without it and stayed wishing that I had added some.

This was very tasty served over basmati rice with naan.  We loved the grilled aspect and then finishing it in the sauce.  The flavors were all good and balanced although it just didn't read Tikka Masala to us.

This is a great change from usual weeknight chicken dinners but still just as easy!  I love the concept of skewering the chicken chunks.  I cooked mine on the broiler because I don't have a grill but it still got good and charred.  Changes I made were replacing the cinnamon with Garam Masala and adding Turmeric.  Also omitted the jalapeno due to personal preference.  I was worried about it being too spicy so only did 1 teaspoon cayenne but next time I'll do the full amount.  Served with roasted cauliflower and rice.  Also topped with slivered almonds I had leftover from another recipe.  They added a nice crunch!

This was delicious.  I actually baked the chicken breasts instead of grilling.  20 min on each side at 375degres.  Served with Jasmine rice and sour cream in top.  Just awesome!

I loved all the spices that went in every step. It smelled heavenly, especially when the Fenugreek was added :) I think it was the cook's error, mine, in cooking the chicken too long because it came out very dry even with the sauce. That being said, had the chicken been tender, it would have been more of a winner for me.

there was far too much cream, far too much salt and the flavours were more "Moroccan" than Indian. 

That said with a few tweaks, cut the cream by a lot, the salt by a lot, the spices by at least half

cook the spices down first then the  tomatoes down a lot longer and added some fenugreek leaves it was a lot better. 

It was okay, not great, I will be looking for a new recipe.

Absolutely off the charts chicken. The sauce was a bit too tomato-y for my taste, but I used coconut milk vs. heavy cream. Luckily, I kept some chicken out of sauce and we ate that way. Also, the garam masala seasoning is crucial to authenticity of this dish.

Let me start off by saying that I am not a great cook so this was a bit ambitious for me, but I finished it and it turned out delicious! This turned out VERY different than I'm used to for chicken tikka masala. It's like....more savory or something. I don't know. It was delicious but not the restaurant style that I'm used to. I made some modifications based on other reviews and my own taste preferences.
1. I omitted all the salt, but found that I needed to add some to the sauce. I tend to like things salty, so I think I'll put 1 tsp. to the sauce to start with next time.
2. I had the time to marinade it overnight and the chicken is fantastic! I don't have a grill but I used the cookie sheet/cookie rack trick that another person mentioned. I browned them on both sides and then let the sauce do the rest of the cooking.
3. I substituted cinnamon for garam masala and added some to the sauce like others suggested and it turned out pretty good. 
4. I doubled the sauce, cause I mean, who doesn't like extra sauce? 
5. I don't like my tikka masala too spicy, so I did half a jalapeño and then controlled the spice level to what I wanted with cayenne in the sauce. I ended up adding probably like a tsp to the sauce.
All in all I found this delicious and I'll probably try it again, but I guess I was looking for a restaurant substitute and this wasn't quite it. I think with some more modifications this could be just as good as my local favorite.

Not something I'd make if I walked in from work and thought "What's for dinner?" However, overall, it's very good, not overly complicated, and very tasty. Even my picky 11 and 13 year olds liked it. I didn't use all the jalapeño, though I did pick a pointy aka spicy one. Didn't use all the salt either, but otherwise made as directed. Would make a really good, planned meal. Would be fine marinating all day, and then grilling and cooking sauce last part. Forgot the cilantro, and while I didn't feel like I missed anything, I felt like it would just add something...

I followed suggestions to drastically reduce the salt and also used Garam masala in both the marinade and sauce. I doubled the sauce, & substituted crushed tomatoes and coconut milk. I didn't have a jalepeno, so used cayenne pepper instead. I served it with basmati brown rice (cooked with sautéed onions,) & naan. This was so good! I will definitely make it again! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe, a crowd pleaser every time, I used 1 3/4 cup cream and 1/4 cup tomato paste just because I was too lazy to go to the store and it turned out great!!!

Delicious! I didn't refrigerate for an hour due to timing, and this dish still turned out to taste exactly like the Tikka Masala I have had in restaurants. I also cooked it all over the stove and made basmati rice to go with it. I could eat this everyday!

Yum!! I listened to other reviewers and doubled the sauce, halved the cinnamon and added 3tbl garam masala in the sauce. So delicious! I’d say it’s pretty spicy, but if you like it hot (or even medium hot from Indian restaurants), you can handle this. If you do cut out any spice, I’d start with maybe half-ing the black pepper. I could taste it among all the other spices. My husband is Indian and I think he’s going to like it.

I really liked it like a lot of people on here. It was a family favourite and even I liked it unlike some of the food I have made. I would strongly go through some of the comments before making it as it does require some minor adjustments with the biggest being the salt the recipe called for. I double the recipe and used maybe a 1/4 of the salt the recommended and used a lot more ginger and garlic. That said I think it is a 5 star.

holy moly! my husband makes this for me once a month or so.   we are low carb so we serve it over cauliflower and it is amazing.   literally my favorite.  I know he changes the spices around every time but it always has the same base sometimes a little hotter.... always out of this world!

Of course, I didn't know I needed garam masala because I've never made chicken tikka masala before. I wasted a lot of good ingredients making a dish that tasted like spicy cumin-flavored tomato sauce.

I didn't add all the salt the recipe called for, so at least the dish was edible.

Sorry to rate it with 1 star only. The cinamon was overwhelming, i wonder why didn’t the author use a readily available tikka mix instead. Didn’t like nor anyone else in the house.

Thought it was excellent. I dialed the cayenne and salt back by half which was just right for me. Could probably afford removing the salt all together. It was an easy recipe and will definitely save this one to try again.

This is a good recipe especially if you like a little kick in your food!  My only regret is that the chicken was relatively bland which surprised me as the marinade smells nothing short of wonderful.  I was pressed for time so I only marinated the chicken for the recommended hour, but if I were to make this again I would leave it in the fridge over-night.
This could also be because I used *very little* salt but that remains to be seen.  I will try this again though I will add onion to the pepper sauce and let the chicken sit in the marinade a minimum of over night.

Made this for my birthday lunch for my work colleagues and they loved it.  I made it spicy so had sour cream on that the table for those that did not want it so hot. Served it with homemade naan bread, Jasmine rice, spicy Indian salad, and eggplant Indian style and everyone loved it.

The best Chicken Tikka Masala recipe I have found yet.  Everytime I make it and share, I get numerous requests for the recipe!  Definitely adjust the salt to your own preference.  I use 1 less teaspoon for both marinade and sauce.  Remember you need to the salt in the marinade to help get the flavors into the meat.

This recipe was amazing. We actually poured the chicken tikka masala over riced cauliflower. Made it a low carb meal!  The only change I would make is use a little less salt. But that is a matter of individual taste.

Cumin taste was very strong, which spoiled it for me. I am a huge fan of the curry-stand tikka masala sauce in this site. This was a weak cousin. Will not make this again.

Made this w/tomatoes paste & water, because I didn’t have sauce on hand.  Omitted the salt in the sauce, which turned out to be a good choice for us.  Served it on brown rice, which I had on hand.  Came out great!

I should have read the reviews first... I thought  I could trust the 4 almost 5 star rating however this was way to salty and way to creamy,  although I loved the spicyness aspect of the dish I will be using a different Chicken Tikka Masala next time.  Im a little shocked that the people who were dissatisfied with the salt content still gave a 5 star review.

Cut the salt!  I used 1 tsp of sea salt instead of 3... 3 tsp of table salt would be insanely salty.

SO GOOD! My first time making this dish.  At first, I thought it was too salty but the flavors mixed really well - especially the longer it sat together. I added a little more than a tablespoon of sugar just to add some sweetness - maybe it helped balance out the saltiness? In any case, it was delicious! I cannot stop eating it and I do not even think this dish has ever been this good at a restaurant... I'll just make it at home! Great recipe. 

** If concerned, definitely add salt gradually and taste as you go in the sauce. I added sugar after it became too salty so maybe hold out on the sugar until you taste it. **

This recipe turned out amazing thank you! I will say it was pretty spicy for the whole family, so next time will cut back on the cayenne pepper.

This is so good, i love this recipe. its now a regular in our house. i don't add the peppers. I feed a big family so i just simmer the chicken in fry pan drain off juices and mix in sauce. its a five star recipe.  very quick and easy to make. while it says to marinate it, i have mixed a bit more seasoning and just cooked in large fry pan.

YUM!  I followed recipe exactly other than taking advice of other reviewers regarding salt.  I didn't want to leave it out completely, but I cut it down by 1/4.  Everyone loved it!

This had incredible flavor! It was a little spicy for our taste, even though I only used a fraction of the cayenne pepper called for (we don't eat very many spicy foods, so I always cut back at least a little on hot spices). We cooked the pieces of marinated chicken on the George Foreman, instead of grilling, and served it over basmati rice. I've only had chicken tikka masala once before, in a very authentic Indian restaurant, and this was every bit as good. I would definitely make this again :)

I read reviews which mentioned that this recipe was very salty, so I reduced the salt to 1tsp total. It was still extremely salty! Not sure where it is coming from. Per the reviews, I also used Garam Masala powder instead of the mix of spices in the marinade. Unfortunately this didn’t taste anything like traditional Tikka Masala that I’ve had in India or in Indian restaurants. I might try it again with the manual blend of spices instead of masala powder, but will probably look for a different recipe instead.

Excellent dish. The only changes I made was I didn't grill the chicken on skewers. I broiled the chicken to the point that a little char was on the chicken. I cut the jalapeno and cayenne pepper amounts in half. The result was a perfect amount of heat in the dish without making it uncomfortable to eat. I will definitely make again.

This is 5 stars IF you reduce the salt!!! Can also lower the cayenne to reduce spiciness if you don't like very spicy foods.

Omg I made this 2 times in 4 days, it was so good!! The first time i made it i snuck downstairs to have a midnight snack, only to find out my teenage boys got to it before i could. When I texted them about it, all they could say was "So sorry Mom it was so bomb!!" Hard to be mad about that lol
I did replace the cinnamon with garam marsala, I doubled the sauce cause I wanted more for the carrot rice i found on this site!!! I marinated it over night and all day and made an makeshift grill with a cookie sheet, tin foil and cooling rack.  So Amazing!!

A lot of work it seemed like, but it has flavor which is what we look for. Wouldn't make often, but it is a flavorful change to do once a year at least. I was worried when I made the marinade because it was hot, but when you put the grilled chicken in with the sauce, wow.  It tames things down & is so good.

This recipe is fantastic!  I substituted yogurt with sour cream (it's what I had on hand) and used gargam masala spice for the sauce.  I also decreased the salt to 1 tsp in the sauce.

We live in an apartment building with several Indian families, so I thought I'd try my hand at an Indian dish.  This fit the bill because I had all the spices on hand.  I've never had Indian food so  I can't say how authentic it is, but it is delicious.  We don't own a grill so I pan fried the meat, then added the sauce ingredients to the pan.  I did lower the salt per others advice.  In the end, I added salt to mine at the table, my husband did not.

My fiance and I made this together. I made it with tofu and he with chicken, and we sautéed instead of grilling, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Usually we love all things Indian and he was worried the recipe wouldn't be spicy enough, but in the end we're throwing out most of what we made. It tastes more Mexican than Indian and seems to be spicy for the sake of spicy. There's no real flavor to it and we will not be making it again.

I did not use the amount of salt specified in the recipe - it's way too much. I also added half of a yellow onion and garam masala instead of paprika in the sauce which made it delicious! My family loved it - worth all the work and waiting!!

Adore this recipe! Very glad the salt amounts were edited. * But please edit the directions to reflect your changes. I had been using this recipe as a guideline and ended up making my own variations because the amount of salt was much too extreme.

This recipe is a hit! I left salt recommendation in marinade but cut salt in the actual sauce recipe salt by 2/3.. I also made homemade naan, and this recipe was perfect! In my house of picky eaters, even my 3 yr old cleaned the plate!!

This is amazing! We can't handle the heat in this recipe so I only put 1/8 tsp cayenne. I used a George Forman to grill the chicken. It was a bit salty so I'll only use 2 tsp of salt in the sauce next time. I didn't have cilantro so left that out. But will definitely make this many times.

I've made this many times.  First, use about 1/3 the amount of salt in recipe.  ALWAYS use Heavy Cream.  I have substituted half & half, light cream, etc, and nothing tastes near heavy cream.  Also, if you have smoked paprika, do 1/2 smoked and 1/2 regular, makes for an interesting variant.

I have also subbed in veggie patties in lieu of chicken.  Also, saitan.  Very good options.

Follow the recipe exactly as stated and its very good.  I always basically double the amount of garlic (in any recipe).  For a healthier option, serve over quinoa with baked broccoli and cauliflower.  yummmmmmmy!  Better than restaurants!

The recipe as is makes it too salty. I think there is an error in the recipe in that it lists 1 tsp salt two times. Next time I make it I will not be adding that much salt.

My husband and I love Indian food and we love this Chicken Tikka Masala recipe. It's very easy to follow, I make it very often now that I think I know the recipe by heart. I do keep all the salt out because what the recipe ask for it's just little bit too much. I only do 1 tsp for the entire recipe and it still taste great!

I took the advise of the Second review and used the gram marsalaand doubled the batch. I also used coconut milk in place of heavy cream. This was 5 stars this way.

This dish is absolutely perfect! I made a few changes... I used half the amount of pepper and cayenne pepper, I broiled my chicken pieces on high broil and added some tandoori spice on them, for the sauce part I added a bit more than a tsp of garam masala in replace of the cumin but I did put a tsp of cumin also as the recipe called for 2 tsp of cumin and used very little salt. Other than those alterations I followed this to a t. So so so yummy and creamy. Will make this 1000 times over thanks so much for sharing.

Only giving 3 stars because on the ingredient, it says 1 ts of salt but in directions, it says 3 ts. Unfortunately I followed the directions without checking and it turned out to be super salty. So I had to add more heavy cream and other stuff to dilute the saltiness afterwards. Please change the amount of salt in the directions. Thanks.

This is the best chicken tikka masala recipe, which makes ordering it at an Indian restaurant very disappointing.  Of course, this is a good thing!  

The recipe is quite salty, but I reduced the salt on subsequent attempts by 80% and it turned out perfect.   We all have our preferences and tweaking recipes is what life is all about.  

Thank you for this treasure!

Awesome. Marinated overnight, used garam masala instead of cayenne, added some coarse kosher salt to the mortar and pestle when I ground the cumin (otherwise, added no salt per reviewers' suggestions). Skipped the jalapeño but used some spicy Hungarian paprika. Using good paprika makes a big difference in a recipe like this, where you add it to the butter and garlic early on. Cooking it in hot oil or butter releases the flavor of the spice (for a long time I thought of paprika as a bland garnish that was more for color than anything else, until I read some good Hungarian recipes) so having good paprika is important. But I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe, as long as you are conscious about the spicy ingredients (cayenne, jalapeño) and the salt (because you can always add that at the table). Basmati is the best rice for this dish, although Calrose would probably be a good choice, too.

This was absolutely fantastic - as good as any Indian take out I've had (and that's a lot)! I read the reviews in advance and made a few adjustments: kept the salt in the marinade but elimated it completely in the sauce, eliminated the jalapeño in the sauce after I tasted the chicken (I love even VERY spicy food, but I thought the marinade had enough heat that if you added the jalapeño it would overwhelm the dish), kept the chicken/marinade portions as written but doubled the sauce recipe and used 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup half/half , quadrupled the garlic (4 big cloves for a double sauce recipe) and added extra ginger in the marinade (2 tbl) as well as a teaspoon of garam masala. I also marinaded for about 8 hours instead of 1 and used another reviewers technique of broiling the chicken on a grate on top of a cookie sheet (8 mins each side on high). All of this sounds complicated, but it really wasn't! This would be ideal for a big batch and freezing for later. I can't recommend this highly enough, 5 stars!

I did not grill the chicken, but it would be that much more awesome if I did.  I just cooked the chicken in a skillet before making the sauce.  I did halve the red cayenne, still super hot, I would say a #2-3 in spiciness.   Looks like we have a typo on the salt in the sauce, which should be 1 teaspoon, not 3.

Made it as is.  The kids loved it but found it a tad spicy.  My own opinion is this is a very serviceable recipe - not too complicated and nice flavor close to more authentic and time consuming recipes.

As it stands, it is ok.  I prepared it almost as written, but halved the amount of salt that went into the cream sauce.  It was still WAY too salty.  Edible, but we had to use a lot of rice to tone it down.  The flavor has potential and the chicken was wonderfully tender so I will try this again, but I will cut down on the salt, at least half.

This is hubby's fave dish to order at our fave Indian restaurant. 
This recipe (according to him) was good, but not like our Indian restaurant. 
He said it "tasted like the kind you buy at the grocery." 
It wasn't bad, it just didn't taste like what he was used to.

I've made this quite a number of times over the last few years.  It's a favorite in our home.  Do NOT use 4 tsps. of salt.  I use a total of 2 tsps. - one in the marinade and one in making the sauce.   I listened to other reviewers my first time, and I encourage you to do the same.  I serve with either pasta shells or rice and petite peas.

I added half an onion (medium size) to the sauce. And used just three teaspoons of salt for the marinade. No more salt added later. The result: amazing!

I made this wondeful chicken  tikka masala in an attempt to replicate what I had at a restaurant. Well, this recipe captures the flavours perfectly. I added a fresh tomato as well, instead of the jalapeno, I used a long red paprika and I did add a bit of curry, although the cumin and garam masala could have sufficed. It is supposed to be spicy. Absolutely delicious!

This was my first foray into Indian cooking, and a dry run before making this for friends. I thought the result was great! I left all salt as one reviewer suggested, and baked in the oven instead of grilling. I will definitely be serving this at my next gathering.

I reduced the salt to 1 tsp in both the marinade and the sauce. I also added a small finely chopped onion to the butter before adding the jalapeno and garlic. Served on Basmati Rice. This is such rich and flavorful recipe. I can't wait to eat the leftovers and I will make it again very soon. Thanks for posting!

My wife made this recipe. I am not big on Indian food, but I do like chicken tikka masala. This was awful! She wanted to post the review, but I already had an account, hence my posting.

Next time, we'll just cut the salt entirely.

This had to be a bad joke.

I will make this again and again. I messed up on the instructions but it came our pan-licking-great!  
-I used boneless skinless chicken thigh, not Brest (more flavor that way)
-I didn't marinade bc I was pinched on time. 
-and I cooked the chicken in the marinade and then added it to the tomatoe sause and other ingreadience and instructed. 
-Instead of rice I baked cauliflower with garlic oil, turmeric and ginger. 

Hope you enjoy!

I've never had tikki but this was delicious. Even my 5 year old loved it. For those worried about heat, I think as written it is much too mild. Put a few tablespoons of chili paste (sambal oelek)and it's perfect!

This is a frequent dish in my house!  Followed all the advice on halving the salt (way too much) also added the 2 tsp of garam masala to the marinade and just a pinch of cinnamon.  I use chicken thighs rather than breasts.....soooo tender if you let it marinade all day (even overnight)  I broil the pieces whole in the oven then cut them into 1 inch squares and add to the sauce (which I double)  Great with Basmati Rice.  Leftovers even better the next day!

first time ever making this dish... it was DELICOUS!   The only change I will make when I prepare it again is to decrease the amount of salt called for in the tomato cream sauce.   it was just a bit too salty for my family...

This is a great recipe but needs lots of adjustments.  Way too much salt...probably need to cut in half at least.  Wee bit too spicy so I have tried lessening the amount of jalapeno and may knock a little off the cayenne next time.  The sauce part needs to be doubled if you want to serve with rice and naan.  Even though it needs tweaking....still good!!

Tasted better than any Tikka Masala found in a restaurant nearby! 

I doubled the recipe, eliminated all the salt until the very end, adding only about a teaspoon to taste to the sauce, and instead of paprika and cinnamon, I used a tandoori/garam masala spice blend we had lying around. Also, as it was too cold to grill outside, I sauteed the chicken pieces in a skillet on the stove top and it turned out beautifully. 

My family ate it all up! Great recipe!

Agree with reviews, I cut down the salt to 2 tsp in the sauce (but I doubled the sauce amount, so would be 1 tsp as written), and no other salt.   Also, took the advice of reviewers and used Garam Masala in the marinade and the sauce.  Cut the cayenne down to 1 tsp and that may have been too much.   Used 1 jalepeno.   I have teens and they're sensitive to spice but I loved it!  Oh!  And used 1 can of coconut milk in place of heavy cream, it was perfect!!!  And full of healthy fats!!  :-)  GREAT recipe, minus all the salt, will use again and again, THANKS!!!

I wish I'd read the reviews first - the recipe has WAY too much salt.  So much so that we couldn't eat it at all.  Otherwise I don't think it'd be a bad recipe.  We're going to try to salvage it the best we can, but it's going to be a tall order to counterbalance all that salt.

I've never made indian food before and I have to say it is amazing! i had to make modifications because i did not have heavy cream or yogurt, and i also reduced the salt because of the reviews explaining it's od'd. Here is what i did differently:
for the first step i kept it the same but instead of yogurt i decided to use homemade heavy cream (3/4 cup of milk and 1/3 cup of melted and cooled butter mixed together; it perfectly replaces the yogurt), of course since the butter already has salt i decided to only use 1 teaspoon of salt. I let this marinade overnight to have the chicken tenderize and really have the spices set in. Then after this i went ahead and actually used a pan to cook the chicken (this is not an excellent idea because the marinade burns, crumbles and blackens on the pan, but it works if need be, so long as you are fine with cleaning up the pan after every batch of chicken that is fried and cutting off any really charred pieces on the chicken). After I put the chicken pieces on a plate i left aside, i went ahead and began to make the sauce. I did not have heavy cream so I thought of using something similar to it but thicker as well instead of the heavy cream I used for the marinade, so I went ahead and conveniently, used 3/4 cup of sour cream I had left and filled the remaining portion with cream cheese (it will melt in the pan do not worry), then i sauted' the garlic and jalapeno however i only used half of it and seeded it because i have a  picky brother so

I loved everything about this recipe....BUT WAY TOO SALTY!!! Next time I make I may put even a 1/4th of what the recipe calls for. I should have read the reviews first because someone else mentioned how salty it was.

I am rating this recipe as written. I made this recipe as written. This turned out soooo salty and the heat was definitely a bit more than I anticipated. I have made much better using other recipes using fewer ingredients and a lot less work. This is just salt and heat and no balance what so ever.  I would not recommend this recipe unless you are willing to go through trial and error in which case, why use this one at all.

I love this recipe and have made it four or five times now. I can't stress this enough: don't add all that salt!!! I nearly ruined it the first time and had to double the recipe to counterbalance the salt and it was STILL too salty.

Yum! Followed the recipe except for the salt.  I did put in a few twists of the grinder for both the marinade and the sauce.  I think next time I will leave out the jalapeño, it was very overpowering taste wise. Can't wait to make it again.

The sauce wasn't to our likings at all.. Way too much cumin and overall taste wasn't good for us (i used way less salt).. The chicken without the sauce isn't bad but it is bland

Great recipe, except way too much salt.  I reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon in the marinade and eliminated the salt in the sauce and it was fine

The marinade really makes the chicken tender. Definitely good, but not the best I've ever had. I wish I didn't heed the advice of those who said nix the salt. I all but nixed the salt and wish I hadn't. It definitely needed it. I'll also try with garam masala next time.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe!!! I will absolutely make again. Definitely be careful on the salt, I used a lot less and it was perfect. As to the heat: better to play it safe and add less at first then during last step add more heat if needed as I did.  I would also recommended perhaps doubling sauce (not marinade) as some suggested (I cooked only 2 chicken breasts and the amount in this recipe was just enough). The marinade would have been enough for 3 chicken breasts.  My changes are detailed below:

Changes to Marinade: only 1.5 tsp cayenne pepper,
Only 1 tsp salt. I marinated the chicken for about 7 hours. 
Grilling: I did not have a grill so I covered a skillet with aluminum foil and grilled the chicken on skewers over the stovetop on high heat and covered with foil to cook inside of chicken. 
Sauce: Olive oil instead of butter, left seeds in jalapeño, added 1/4 onion in sauté, added a big dash cayenne (I needed more heat*), salt 1/4 tsp, omitted cilantro (I didn't have any). 

*Jalapeno heat tend to vary and mine was very mild so I needed the extra heat.

I only put salt in the marinade.  Also, will cut back the cayenne a bit next time.  The sauce is very good.  I will double it next time to have more to soak into the rice.

As written (which is how we prepared), this recipe has way too much salt! So much that it was overpowering and we couldn't eat the dish. I will have to try this again without the salt as others have suggested.

Absolutely delicious!!! I took one star off my review though because there wasnt enough sauce to cover the rice but it did cover the chicken quite nicely. I also used greek yogurt in mine.

Made this recipe this evening for dinner and I absolutely loved it. My wife found it a little too spicy for her liking but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Next time I will cut back on the cayenne pepper a tad and see if it's more to her liking. I did cut way back on the salt as other reviewers had said (only 2 teaspoons for the entire recipe) and found it fine. The flavors were spot on and the aroma of the simmering dish filled the house. Thanks for the recipe Yakuta! This one's definitely going in the recipe box!

Listen, I am a salt lover. Everyone is disgusted by how much salt I put on my food. My husband often eats whatever I pick out of my dishes (raw tomatoes, some onions, etc.) and I put so much salt on my food that I have to sometimes warm him when I know I've salted too much for him to pick off of my "discard" plate. With that said, I almost gagged when he first made this. It tasted really good and authentic, but our tongues almost shriveled up with how much salt the recipe had. Could we have cut it down when we first made it because 7tsp of salt is sort of a red flag? Yes, but we always make a dish exactly to the recipe the first time so we know what we'd like to change the next time. We ate a few bites of it until I (worried I was going to insult him) told him that it had too much salt. We tossed it and drank as much water as our bodies could hold. The next day I had leg cramps from dehydration. Who wrote this? We now make the recipe at least once a month with probably 3/4tsp of salt throughout the whole thing and it's great. Also doesn't need jalapenos or cilantro, and since we don't have a grill we cook the chicken on the stove without skewers and it's fantastic.

I made the mistake of not reading the reviews. I halved the salt because it seemed like a lot and it was still so salty that it was inedible. I would try it again without the salt but wow, the measurements of salt have to be a mistake!

We absolutely loved this recipe (with the salt modifications recommended by other reviewers).  Other than reducing salt, I used mostly the same ingredients (used chicken thigh instead of breast) and instead of grilling the chicken I broiled it.  This recipe has been saved in my favorites and will be in regular rotation.

This recipe was phenomenal! The absolutely only thing I did differently was use about a tsp. less salt. That's it.  I allowed the chicken to marinate for an hour, grilled it on skewers on my stove top grill (had the windows opened), allowed the sauce to simmer and viola! Topped on basmati rice and garnished with cilantro...magical.  Truly a great dish.

Yum! Easy to make and basic ingredients. We're an Indian household so I tweaked it a bit to make it spicier and added some ground cloves. Also didn't grill - just pan fried the chicken. Thanks for sharing this! Now I'll be drooling for lunch all during church.

Good, nice hot and spicy flavor but just one problem. This recipe has waaayyy too much salt I cut it down to 2 teaspoons when it called for 3 and was still too salty. I would say cut by more than half and if you're not into super spicy foods cut the cayenne as well

OMG SOOOOO good!  
I live in a country that has ZERO indian food, and have been craving a good Indian chicken dish.  This hit the spot, and was so easy, too!  Grateful for the heads-up about the salt--I used just 2 teaspoons (one in the yogurt sauce, one in the tomato sauce) and will probably add another 1/2 tea to the tomato sauce in the future.  I used only 1 tea of black pepper, 1 tea of cayenne and then added 1 tea of sweet red pepper for the yogurt sauce.  No jalapenos for the tomato sauce and I ended up forgetting the cilantro as well, but was still so very happy about it and the 1 tea black pepper/1 tea cayenne was just the right low (but not non-existent!) level of hot for my hot-adverse family.  Also, I didn't grill but baked at 450 for 10 minutes--so much easier and less messy.  I was planning on trying other chicken tikka recipes, but liked this so much I think I'll just stick with this.

I've made this recipe several times, however I usually don't cook the chicken on the grill. I add it to the tikka massala sauce and cook it that way. (Usually for about 30-60 minutes at a simmer.) I also lower the salt content (with Indian food you always want to add salt to taste while cooking, as the dishes sometimes call for a lot/too much of it). It's a great dish!

I made this and it was delicious. Highly addicting. I recommend using half the salt it calls for, maybe even less than that. I used 5 cloves of garlic (I love garlic), I also used a 15oz can of tomato sauce with 1 and half cups heavy cream to make sure I had plenty of sauce. Very good, will be making this often

It was too spicy for us, although probably a solid "spicy" for those who like spice.

Very nice, and authentic to British Indian restaurants. Reduced the salt down to 1 teaspoon in the marinade and 1/2 teaspoon in the sauce. I'd rate this "fairly hot" as per the recipe, slightly below a UK madras. I'd recommend reducing the cayenne to lower the heat, which is what I'll try next time.

Way too much salt. I just add it at the end to taste. Other than that great recipe! Goes great on a bed of rice or with some naan bread

Loved the recipe. I did eliminate all of the salt and added a pinch of sugar to cut the bitterness of the tomato sauce but, otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter. Thanks for the great recipe. It's a keeper!

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breast.  Also cut back on salt as many reviewers suggested and added garam masala.  I also used ground ginger since I forgot to pick up fresh ginger at the store.  It was delicious!  Will definitely make again.

Overall great flavor and is definitely better than most Indian restaurants I've been to. Was a bit mild for my taste initially but adding a few more thai chilis did the trick. Great recipe overall!

Seasoned to taste as I always do, specially I'm only cooking for two so I always have to cut down seasonings and liquids....  I sauteed onion, garlic cauliflower and added to the sauce before I dump in the chicken (couldn't grill because it was raining hard so I used nonstick skillet over medium heat and dump few pieces of chicken and Brown them by pressing them to the skillet, rarely use oil when I do this or if I do use oil then I prefer to mix it with my marinade which is never more than 1 1/2 tsp oil) 

added spring onion in the end for decoration. Served it with Pita bread. Loved it....

I made this exactly as written. As many others have said, this is way too salty. I liked the flavor, though, and will definitely make again, but with much less salt.

This was delicious! My husband and son each had a second serving. Thankfully, I had doubled the recipe. All the seasonings were doubled except for the salt, which I used only 1.5 tsp of and put directly into the sauce. Also, I added 4 tsp of Garam Masala to the sauce, which I think made a huge difference in the taste. Without that, and I did taste it before adding any, was quite bland. So happy I added the Garam Masala and very thankful for this great recipe!

First time cooking Indian food, and my girlfriend and i made this, along with basmati rice and naan recipes from this site.

The tikka masala was my girlfriend's job.  She cut the salt in the marinade in half and swapped a serrano pepper for the jalapeno, but otherwise followed the instructions here.

Everything came out absolutely delicious.  Great, easy to follow recipe!

This dish was fabulous.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I believe there is an error in the salt.  I did not put any salt in the chicken yogurt mixture and only 1 teaspoon salt in the sauce.  This was plenty.  The 1 Tsp could be divided between the chicken and sauce.  I will make this again.

It might be really good but we couldn't taste anything other then salt. I will try to make it again, this time with 1/5th of the salt, since the recipe looks promising otherwise.

This was absolutely delicious (although I followed the advice to salt to taste), and surprisingly easy to make. It was very rich, though, and in the future I think I am going to play around with the butter/heavy cream amounts to make it a squidge healthier

We have made this dish 4 times now. I substitute coconut milk for the cream & reduce the salt. It changes the flavor a bit-but in such a good way!! Original recipe is very good too, I just prefer it with coconut milk.

I had this dish for the first time in Galveston, TX at a Indian restaurant. The dish I had wasn't near as spicy as this but the taste otherwise was spot on. I marinated the chicken overnight and rather than skewer it I took boneless chicken and cut it lengthwise. I then mixed it thoroughly in the yogurt marinade. I grilled it the next day and cut it into 1-inch chunks and set it aside until the sauce was ready. For the sauce I added smoked paprika rather than regular and I also added 2 TBSP of sugar. I listened to other people and cut back the salt and added it as I needed it. That worked best for me but you'll just need to experiment. I'll definitely make this again but likely cut back on the jalapeños and cayenne pepper a bit.

This would definitely be a 5 star when you reduce the amount of salt. The recipe is excellent. If you chargrill the chicken the smoky flavor comes through, it's delicious.

Excellent recipe! I agree with other reviewers- too heavy on the salt. I also made a few other modifications. I reduced the spiceyness by only using half the jalapeño. I also added mushrooms and peppers to the garlic and jalapeños. It really is a keeper recipe!!

I made all changes the reviewers suggested - only a tiny bit of salt added, no cayenne, and about 3/4 the paprika and cumin in the recipe. I also added sauteed onions along with the garlic. When I tasted the sauce, it was sooo tangy and spicy in all the wrong ways. I added about 3 tablespoons brown sugar to combat the wrong/totally overpowering spices.  Still not right. Ugh.

This is delicious with a bit of customizing.
1. Use a mild garam masala in the yogurt marinade, 
2 omit most of the salt, using only a generous pinch each time. 
3. No jalapeño or chili at all.
4. Again, use my own garam masala spice blend in the cooking process.
5. Oh, pan-fry the chicken in the marinade, remove, and use the same pan to create the sauce, then return the chicken to it at the end.

I didn't add salt and substituted coconut milk for the cream and left out the jalapeño as my kids don't like things too spicy.  It was soon delish and everyone loved it.  We ate it with basmati rice and naan.

Very good! I also made it with coconut milk-- and it was still delicious and very lean. After reading everyone else's reviews, I opted to use only 1tsp of salt in the marinade and 1tsp in the sauce, and it was the perfect amount of salt!

I loved this recipe! Didn't add the jalapeño since there was plenty of heat from the cayenne pepper and only added the 3 tsps of salt to the marinade. Also added 1/2 cup yogurt and 1 Tbsp of tomato paste to the final dish. Will probably cut down the cayenne pepper to 1 tsp next time.

Simply phenomenal. And totally worth the time it took to make. Creamy with the most divine tingly chili after taste. I don't usually cook with much salt so I took previous reviewers' advice and only used a little. Served it on caulirice. Will definitely do this one again and again and again.

I've made this a couple of times, followed the recipe exactly (except for cutting down on the amount of salt) and really like it. It seems to be pretty authentic, and I've had it at enough good Indian restaurants in Chicago to know. I do have a suggestion (for anyone who posts recipes): please try to be more specific about amounts/measurements. This recipe calls for "3 boneless chicken breasts." Does this really mean 3 whole breasts (which would be an awful lot of chicken), or does it mean 3 chicken breast halves, which is how boneless breasts are usually sold? An approximate weight would be helpful, e.g., "1 1/2 lbs," or "3 lbs." Other than this, it's a great recipe.

Way too salty! I followed the recipe exactly because the reviews were so great. I should have known better than to add 3 teaspoons of salt to a sauce, but followed the recipe anyway.

Hands down delicious and restaurant quality! I substituted coconut milk for cream, added some coriander (could not find garam masala in the store to substitute for cinnamon as someone suggested so I tried to at least get a little closer to it) and added salt to taste, i.e., I did not follow the t(b)sp amounts (that would've probably been too salty for us). The end result was absolutely delicious -- serve with naan and enjoy!

I listened to others and put in very little salt. The chicken off the BBQ was amazing. The sauce... well, I didn't think it was that great. I'll make the chicken again, though! I'll be trying other sauce recipes from this site.

This was a fabulous dish!!! Everyone on my family loved; even my 4 yr old son. Since I was feeding my family I toned down the spices; used only 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper and no jalapeños.  I also followed the suggestion for using garam masala spice and doubling the sauce. I served this over Jasmine rice. Next time I  will try coconut jasmine rice. Absolutely delicious!!!!

I made this recipe as stated and served it with jasmine rice. Definitely a winner recipe! My father-in-law has been traveling to India for work and he said that this was an authentic flavor, but was even better than the food in India because he could have it at home. The cinnamon addition sounds unusual if you aren't used to making Indian food, but to me, it makes the dish!

My son who knows indian food said that this WASN'T chicken tikka masala, but in his words it is "something". He did like it and took leftovers home. I cut the salt in half and also the cayenne pepper. I thought it would still be inedible due to the amount of spices but it was ok, h o t but edible. My son thought I should have added all the cayenne.  So if you are used to indian food use all the spices except use 1/2 the salt.

This curry recipe is very flexible, and you can make all kinds of substitutions to it (lactose-free milk or coconut milk instead of cream, garam masala powder instead of pretty much all the other spices, no chili peppers, no marinade!...It'll still taste fine. There is way to mcuh salt!

This recipe was so authentic and absolutely amazing!!  Now I don't have to go anywhere to get my Indian Tikka Masala fix!  I pretty much made the recipe as is, cutting down on the salt to only 1 tsp for the entire recipe (added in the sauce).  I didn't plan ahead, and only marinated the chicken for about a half hour, and it was still very flavorful.  Also, why discard the yogurt marinade?  I doubled the sauce recipe, only using 1 cup of heavy cream to save calories, and added the remaining yogurt marinade to the sauce.  It thickened up beautifully and was the perfect coating....plus not as fattening!  Can't wait to make this again, thank you for such an awesome recipe....I'd definitely say it's matched right up there with our very popular Indian restaurant in authenticity!

SALT, SALT, SALT.  Great recipe, but cut the salt portions by at least 50%.  Made this last night and it was even salty with half the added sodium.  Next time I'll cut the salt out completely.

I substituted the heavy cream with an extra cup of plain greek yogurt and I added stewed dice tomatoes with the juice instead of the tomatoe sauce, I also added an onion. I didn't have an jalapeno  either I used thighs, cooked them and then cut the meat off and continued cooking it in a fry pan Best chicken  tika Masala I've ever tasted. Great spice and flavor. Ps. I used 1 and a half teaspoons of salt for the whole dish and it was perfect.

I've been making this recipe for years, and like some other reviewers, I think it is absolutely one of the best recipes on this site. Yes to "no salt", but no to "too spicy". Here's my secret for making this recipe less time consuming - don't use skewers to grill chicken after marinating. I use chicken tenders, marinate them overnight, and then just throw them on the grill - skewer-less. I'll then cut them into bite size pieces before adding them to the masala sauce.  So much faster!

Following previous reviewers' advice, I omitted the salt and doubled the sauce and used coconut milk instead of heavy cream. The spices were fragrant and delicious but the jalapeño made the dish extremely spicy, more like a vindaloo than tikka masala.  Being Thai, my spice tolerance is pretty high and I still thought it was extreme. If you're looking for a mild curry, I'd suggest leaving out the jalapeño or only using a quarter or half of one. Otherwise, I'd give the recipe 5 stars. It was delicious other than being a bit too spicy.

Like many others, I did not use the  amount of salt recommended.  Because of the need for low-sodium foods in our household, I only salted the marinade to taste.  Additionally, since we are vegetarians, I used Indian Paneer instead of chicken.  This was a wonderful recipe that I will be sure to make again!

I really like this, but I think I prefer the 'Curry Stand Chicken Tikka Masala Sauce' recipe on this site just a little more.  Both are great though!  Definitely OMIT all of the salt and add at the end if you think it needs it.  And definitely DOUBLE the sauce - I would've been very disappointed if I hadn't.

Great  recipe, Taste as good as my local indian restaurant. I did omit all salt from  chicken and sauce, it turned out wonderful. Definitely double the sauce recipe so you have extra. I wll be making often.

This came out terrific although I modified it by using half the salt, and adding a can of thai style coconut milk while reducing the cream by half.  Also threw in previously steamed cauliflower and green beans.  Served over brown basmati rice.  So it was more like a Thai curry.  Nevertheless, it got raves.

Really good.  We basically followed the recipe, but instead of skewering & grilling the chicken, we actually used the George Foreman grill, which turned out really well (much to my chagrin).   I'll have to agree with some of the criticisms about the salt--there is a lot of salt, and when we make this again, we'll use waaaay less than the recipe called for, if any at all.  Also, this is a very spicy dish.  I'm accustomed to lots of spice, and I liked it fine, but my rosier-cheeked partner was nearly in pain.  Be careful how you use the jalapeno if you're meek when it comes to spice.  Overall, this was a great great dish.  Easy to make, delicious, easy clean-up.  Will make again for sure!

I highly recommend this recipe.  I would change somethings though.  Only 1 tsp of salt instead of 3.  Jalapeños (optional) depends who is coming for dinner.

Delicious! We didn't even marinate the chicken that long (maybe two hours max). I think a little too much of the yoghurt was still clinging to the chicken when we grilled it, so next time I'd do a better job scraping it off. Used about 1/8-1/4 of the recommended salt. Also, used less butter and cream, more oil and coconut milk. I can't wait to make it again. Might add some sauteed chopped onion.

Very good flavor. WAY WAY too salty. The salty flavor comes mostly from the salt in the maranade so just cut that in half or less (in the yogurt mix). You can always add the salt back later if needed but you won't.

We def did not do the amount of salt  in this recipe. We did follow the recipe to a Tee the first time and it was way too much salt but after remaking it. We love it ! Also my husband made 1/4 the black pepper, 1/2 jalapeno and instead of using cilantro as a garnish, we cooked it in. We added some diced onion an extra clove of garlic and mixed it with frozen veggies. We will most certainly make this recipe again.

I substituted curry powder and ground coriander for the paprika and it came out very good. I think the salt recommendations on this recipe are a little high, and this is coming from someone who likes it pretty salty.

Good base for a recipe but I made a few alterations based on my family's tastes: 1) I used 1 tsp salt in the marinade and none anywhere else. The recipe calls for SIX teaspoons of salt! Way too much. 2) cumin all in the marinade and none in the sauce. 3) no jalapeño. 4) too tangy but I suspect that's because I accidentally used Greek yogurt. I stirred in about a half cup of cilantro into the sauce before serving as well. It came out great!

REALLY good! I'm going to freeze the leftovers and make some Saag to go with it.  I was thankful for the advice regarding the salt. I bought no-salt tomato sauce and used salt to taste and I didn't miss it at all. I also marinated overnight and followed the reviewer who doubled the tomato sauce and added more garam masala. If you taste the sauce while the chicken is cooking separately, don't worry if it seems a little off or too tomato-ey. The chicken adds so much heat that it changed the sauce entirely when I put it in. I'd best describe the heat as feeling it when you eat it and afterwards, but not causing watery eyes or pain when you eat it. I would have liked to have added a slightly sweet flavor to this, maybe a little brown sugar. This is probably the best tasting dish I ever cooked for myself at home! Gives me hope for my cooking skills!

This is delicious! I prefer to substitute coconut milk for the heavy cream, and tomato puree instead of tomato sauce. It is even better the next day. I enjoy cooking, so I use recipes as more of "suggestions" and eye ingredients and amounts.  I adjust according to my taste, and as I proceed. So for those who complained it is too salty, don't add so much salt!  Start off with a sprinkling of the seasonings, and just add more as you cook.  Overall, this is a really easy recipe with great results.

I've tried several chicken tikka masala recipes and could never quite get it right. The secret ingredient that made it taste like the chicken tikka masal from an Indian restaurant was cinnamon. I put less salt than the recipe calls and it's still pretty salty.

This recipe is great. I only used 1 tsp of salt in the marinade and I used Garam masala instead of cinnamon. I cut the Paprika in half and only used a quarter of a jalapeño. I salted as I cooked and it was perfectly spicy. Served it over white rice with naan from trader joes!

Love love love this recipe!! I've made it about 10 times easy over last couple years. Everyone raves about it and are always surprised that I can make something that good!  (I"m more tomboy type and not so much the Susie homemaker in my friends eyes). Only thing I do  different is  I don't use as much salt, that is too much IMO.. I use less than 2 tsp. it calls for 4.   But other than that its perfect

The tikka masala came out sooo delicious, just like in an authentic indian restaurant. I was halfway through the recipe when I read everyone's reviews about the salt. I added the 4 teaspoons of salt in the marinade at the beginning, but omitted all 3 teaspoons of salt in the sauce. Came out perfect! Didn't have garam masala on hand, but will be adding that next time for sure. Can't wait to make this again!

This is absolutely the best recipe that I have found that resembles the chicken tikka masala  at the pakastani restuarant that I love. Making this is really simple. I also add more tomato sauce and heavy cream. I use about 1 and half jalapenos as it gives it a kick but not too spicy for my kids. LOVE THIS.

Do not use salt.  Wife first comment, 'well it's pretty salty'.  I substituted siracha for any heat demand.  Also finished with fenugreek leaves instead of cilantro and really brought the dish together.

The recipe calls for way too much salt. I just eye balled the salt, which was more like a teaspoon for the marinade and a half tsp for the sauce and it turned out good.

Very flavorful and fairly quick to make for Indian food. Very mild if exclude cayenne pepper. Made the recipe as is, except for the following:  
>1 and 1/2 chicken breast halves
>Used 1/2 tsp salt in the sauce (none in marinade) 
>Did 1/2 tsp black pepper
>Used 2 tsp garam masala 
>Excluded cayenne pepper (maybe try a little to up spiciness)
>Excluded jalapenos 
>Can use half and half or cream (added a little extra)
>Doubled the sauce (not the marinate). The above amounts are for a doubled sauce.

This one had way too much salt.  I don't recommended using the listed amount of salt in this recipe.

I am an American who lives in the UK, which is where this dish originated. Brits now joke that this is their national dish because it is so popular. I was skeptical because the ingredients were so different from the UK tikka masala recipes that I normally prepare, but the ratings made me curious enough to give it a try. This dish tasted like grilled chicken doused in an unseasoned tomato cream sauce, not tikka masala. Chef John has posted a much more authentic recipe.

This was good except the sauce called for way too much salt.  As I was preparing the spices, I wasn't really thinking about how much was going in.  Then, after the first bite, I realized I should have paid attention.  I made a second batch of sauce a little later and put only 1 T.  It was much better.

My only advice is to only put in 1/4 the amount of salt that is in the recipe.  I made it according to amounts listed and could not eat it because all we could taste was salt.

Amazing flavor, but 
1) instead of 7t salt, I used 2t. That was fine.
2) Ohmygod this was hot. My jalapeno must have been a flamer.

This is delicious! The yogurt marinade keeps the grilled chicken moist and adds tons of flavor. It was so good, you can just grill the meat and never add the sauce, although, it is wonderful, too. I do take others' advice and reduce the salt.

Easy and delicious!  Don't even need to bother with skewers and grilling - can simply bake or use a grill pan!  The amount of salt is way too much so salt to taste instead.

It was so salty it was completely inedible.

I remade it today, with way WAY less salt (a pinch in the marinade and a pinch in the sauce) and it was perfect. It could probably be happily made without added salt. 

So, without the salt, it's amazing.

It was perfect apart from being far too spicy for me (I am a mild with spice person). For me next time I will add half the spices. I added the required amount of salt to the marinade but left the salt out in the sauce as suggested by others. I also double the sauce so there is enough to cover the rice and naan bread. (Garlic naan goes perfect with this dish!)

Excellent with a few modifications. I knew from looking at the quantity of salt that was called for that it was going to be way too salty so I only added 1 tsp in the marinade and salt to taste for the sauce. I omitted the cinnamon in the marinade and added 2 tsp garam masala instead. I also doubled the sauce and added 3 tsp of the garam masala to the sauce to add a little more flavor. I served it over rice and garlic naan as a side. Delicious!

This recipe is amazing, but you definitely need to cut the salt in half at least, we did and it was perfect.  We also cut the cayenne in half but added the whole jalapeno, and it was almost too spicy for us, and we are fairly tolerant of heat.  It takes a bit of work and mess to make this, but the flavor is amazing and well worth it.  Double the batch and freeze half for later is my plan for next time, that way I will only have to clean up once for two meal's worth.

There is to much salt! I noticed this right away with the other reviews and went with 1/4 of what the recipe calls for.  Also I don't use cinnamon.  This is one of my family's favorites.

Absolutely out of this world!  Everyone's right about the salt I put in 2 teaspoons and that was plenty – I can't imagine putting 7 teaspoons of salt into anything!  And cut down by half on the cayenne and jalapeño.   Next time I may increase the heat - just didn't want to overdo it the first time.  Taste as u go and use your common sense and u will love the result!  Yum!!

I've had it in England and have had it many a time in the U.S.; this is by far the BEST chicken tikka I've ever eaten. I of course didn't use as much salt as called for, however aside from that, the only changes I made were that I used thigh meat rather than breast, and grilled it in my oven at 425. It was positively creamy, spicy, flavorful and possessed of a lovely depth, particularly over warm basmati rice. Several reviews have said to add a bit of garam masala; I will certainly try this next time to see if it takes an already sublime flavor even further. Thank you for a superb recipe that I know I shall be using for years to come.

This recipe is amazing. I only use one teaspoon salt for the marinade and one teaspoon for the sauce. We also substitute the butter with ghee and the yogurt and heavy cream with coconut milk. These substitutions are probably healthier, but mainly we did it to make the recipe paleo/whole30 compliant. I also like to double the jalapeño, because we like it spicy!

This was very good, even my 10 year old love it!  For those of you with access to indian spices, I used Garam Masala in place of the cumin, cinnamon and pepper in the marinade, and tandoori in place of half of the cumin and paprika in the sauce.  I also doubled the sauce so I had extra to soak into the rice.  I used 1 teaspoon of salt in the marinade and 1/2 t of salt in the sauce, as suggested by other reviews.  I don't love a lot of spice so I cut down on the cayenne and omitted the jalapeño.  Next time I'll make sure I have some Naan to go with in.  So good!

This was awesome! I made some changes,instead of cinnamon I used garam masala,a clove of garlic and doubled yogurt,only 1 1/2 tsp of salt,half tsp of cayenne marinated for 3 hours then baked the chicken with the marinade at 400f for about 25 minutes. Made the sauce as directed without jalapeño and only half tsp of salt. Then mixed the chicken after draining the clear liquid but keeping the yogurt curds in the sauce. It was the best!!!

The recipe is pretty much amazing, you do have to lower the salt like many have suggested, hence the 4 stars.  I used only 1 tsp of salt in the sauce and 3/4 of a jalapeno.  I also cut down on some of the fat by using half and half instead of heavy cream.  I used just a sprinkle of cayenne and the heat was a nice hint.  This was perfect for us, my husband can't handle hot stuff the next morning so the adjustments are completely necessary.   It was great atop some basmati rice I made in the rice cooker.  Just 2 c and 3 c water with a Tbsp of butter....mmm soft and fluffy, so aromatic and yummy.  Once I didn't have yogurt to marinate the chicken but it still tasted really good.  I've made this 3 times, its best with the yogurt and grilled, but broiling in the toaster oven works really well when you don't have time (Just won't have crispy fat from the skin).  I've noticed garam masala is in a lot of other recipes, I think it's good to make it taste more authentic.  Definitely a cheap meal that tastes amazing without going out to an Indian restaurant and dropping $30 for tiny servings of this.  

If you do want to try it first, I suggest going to one that has a lunch buffet for 9-10 you can eat as much as you want and try lots of different dishes.  Try new things ppl

Agreed there's way too much salt. Otherwise, one of the best chicken tikka recipes i've made to date.

Tip: if you do not have caradmon in your spices, mix together equal parts nutmeg and cinnamon. Phenomenal.

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and actually used my oven. I found the recipe as written very salty, even after using half the recommended amount.  I also tweaked the cumin, using only about 3 tsp total and I added some garam masala.  I made the tomato sauce more or less as written (less salt) and loved it!

Ok. This is a bomb  recipe. The spices are on hit. Great combination. The spiciness level is perfect. I cut the salt to about 1/3 the amount in the sauce.

Just made this after trying some other tikka masala recipes and this is most like the one my favorite Indian restaurant serves.  After reading other reviews I chose to cut down the salt, only using one teaspoon in both the marinade and the sauce and didn't miss the rest.  I did not use the jalapeno either and it was spicy enough (although I admit I rank poorly on the hot food scale).  I added part of a red onion left over from a great shrimp taco recipe on this site, cut into long slivers which was nice.

I did not feel like firing up my charcoal grill so I just broiled the bits of chicken in the oven, nice and tender.  When i do this recipe again, I will definitely try the grilling option as I am sure it only makes it even better.

I cooked my sauce a bit too long as I prefer it a little runny to mix all up in the rice.  It was a little thick, but since I didn't have any naan bread, it was ok. On the reheat I will pour in some extra cream to thin it up a bit.

This was very easy to make and for the effort was really quite delicious.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

My husband and I love Indian food- and this was definitely a keeper for us.  I listened to the suggestions and only put 1 teaspoon of salt in the sauce and marinade.  If you can marinade for more than an hour- it helps the chicken soak in the flavour. Great with naan and basmati rice!

I made the marinade without reading the reviews. I marinated the chicken overnight. It was too salty and too spicy to eat! I tried to fix it by rinsing some of the marinade off. I also broiled the chicken rather than grill it. I made the sauce without any salt. I will look for a better recipe.

I made it mostly as written (after briefly skimming a few reviews). I reduced the amount of salt, cayenne pepper and the jalapeño. It was still way to salty and spicy, but that is a matter of taste. All of that being said, I think the recipe has potential and will try it again, leaving out the salt and cayenne pepper completely and drastically reducing the jalapeño.

This was a good recipe. I had to cut down the salt when I realized how much it actually called for. I think I will omit the jalapeno next time with half as much salt as I used. So for the marinade 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp salt for the sauce next time. The black pepper was a bit much so I will use half and half of the cayenne pepper. All-in-all it turned out wonderful. Will definitely make this for dinner again.

Delicious! I followed reviewers' advice and didn't add the amount of salt it called for. Wonderful way to save money on our favorite Indian dish by making it at home! Next time I will try using whole milk instead of heavy cream to cut down on the calories. We made naan from this website also to go with it, such a yummy meal! Thanks for the recipe!

I have now made this dozens of times and it is seriously yummy. I've only ever made it with fresh salmon and not chicken but the recipe translates well. Pair it with rice and naan and you have a delicious Indian feast that will have people licking the plate, literally!

I cut the cayenne and pepper in half and left out the jalapeno and it was still too spicy for me. Great recipe, though, next time I'll quarter the spice.

Have made this recipe many many times! Always reduce the salt as others have said. For easier cooking I put the chicken with ALL the marinade on a baking sheet and broil in the oven, turning once until the chicken is cooked. Then I put everything into the sauce so none of the marinade flavours are lost and it is amazing! I rarely find a restaurant version that can compete with this!

This was tasty but it contained way too much salt, and I even omitted a couple tsp. Next time I make it I will cut the salt at least by half. Once I got past the saltiness, the flavors were a lovely mix.

Wowza this was so yummy! I took the other reviewers advice and added LESS SALT! I will add even LESS salt next time around, probably none at all in the sauce at the end.  Other than that, Amazeballs! IT is my bfriend's favorite dish and he's lived in the UK for many years, so hard act to follow, but he loved it except for the extra salty factor. He said "it's better than any tikka I have had here in America" ;) So next time it will be better than, or as good as he's ever had Ha!

Really great Indian taste. We were so pleased with how it came out. We did not use the skewers to cook the meat - unnecessary. Also, we added turmeric (because of all the health benefits) and it worked very well.

Great recipe! This is my husband's favorite dish at restaurants. I am so thrilled that I have found another Team Jenkins favorite on this site. I cannot wait to cook it for friends and family. I plated it with sautéed onions on top of a bed of jasmine rice. Thank you, Yakuta!

It was entirely too spicy (and I cut the cayenne pepper WAY down and didn't even use a jalapeno!) and the flavors just didn't mesh.

This recipes was surprisingly good!! I had no expectations on how it would turn out. I loved it though. I will say that I didn't put the last 3 tsp of salt. The salt on the chicken was more than enough! Also I didn't marinate the chicken for longer than 30 min because I was so tired and that was mainly the time I used to skewer them. I also cooked them in the oven broiler. And unless you are using organic chicken, regular chicken breasts are really big and you will only need 2 of them. Enjoy!

This was a great recipe but was not spicy at all.  I followed other reviews and cut down on the salt which was a good thing.  I would add more jalapeño and cumin next time but will definitely make this again.

This chicken was amazing! I marinated the chicken for about 24 hrs and instead of putting it on skewers I grilled it as a whole chicken breast and cut it into large sized cubes once I had the sauce ready, the sauce was flavorful and easy to put together, the chicken was absolutely moist, I took it to work to share and everyone loved it!

Oh my... This was really amazing!! I did make 2 changes- I hardly put any salt in, just to taste. I also put the juice of 1 whole lemon. But other than that, I left it the same. My entire family went bonkers for this. They said it was the best thing that I've made, and I love cooking. My younger brother is very picky, and he loved it. So, just don't put so much salt and you'll love it!

per other reviewers, I deleted the salt and cut way back on the hot spice (my family would require that!)   Otherwise, It was fantastic. I thought that it was much better to let the cooked meat simmer in the sauce for longer....the longer the better.   I put mine in a dutch oven on low heat for a couple of hours while we were out, was even better!  Served with rice pilaf and homemade naan, will make this one again!

Almost delicious. I wish I'd read the reviews first! I made the recipe as-is, only omitting half the jalapeño. The result was extremely salty and quite spicy. Next time, I'll omit all salt (only adding to taste at the end, if necessary) and cut back on the cayenne.

We really liked the flavor, omitting the salt and using garam masala instead of cinnamon.  It was just a bit creamy for our taste.  Next time we will either use coconut milk, or thin it out with some chicken broth.

I've made this recipe a few times now. It's fairly salty, so we reduce the salt to about 1/4 to 1/3 of what the recipe calls for. Also, my family is not crazy about super-hot spicy food, so I'm only using about 1/3 of the cayenne, and omitted the jalapenos altogether. Otherwise, it's very tasty.

This would be a really good recipe except for the salt.  Sadly I didn't read the reviews below.  Didn't realize there were any.  It was so salty we could barely eat it.  I made the chicken tikka masala and basmati rice and baingan bharta.  There was so much salt I made a new sauce with only a 1/2 tsp of salt and rinsed off the chicken and put it in that sauce.  We are having the leftovers for lunch on Monday so I don't know how the salt level is now.  Now that I have read the reviews I will cut the salt right back on both the marinade and sauce and use my friend's homemade garam masala in place of the cinnamon.  I am definitely trying it again because it it weren't for the sale it would have been excellent.  Because of how salty is was I have to give it only one star.  I think it's ridiculous they even say that amount of salt.  My husband still thinks it's a misprint.

Edited to say that after I rinsed the chicken off and remade the sauce it was very delicious.  Passed my East Indian friend's high standards.  Both this and the Baingan Bharta.

Absolutely delicious! I took advice of others and reduced cayenne pepper and the heat was perfect, just a little, the way I like it. Also only added a little salt as suggested. Put over jasmine rice. Better than any I've had at any Indian restaurant I've been to! My brother loved it as well

I didn't use as much salt and I used garam masala instead of cinnamon. I have never eaten this before so I have nothing to compare it too but my whole family agrees that it is to die for. I cooked the chicken in the oven since it was raining out. I also marinated the chicken for 5 hours. I think over night would make it even better if its possible. I served this with rice and flour tortillas that's what I had on hand and also some greenbeans, it was yummy!!!

I loved this recipe! It was excellent. I agree with others who've tried this, it definitely asks for WAY too much salt. But I'm an intermediate cook so I knew right off the bat it was too much, so I cut it down to two teaspoons total. The flavors were so good and it was very spicy. My husband and I loved it but I'd lessen the heat when making it for our kids. Thanks for submitting an awesome recipe!

Delicious! I am going to use less cayenne next time. It was just a little on the hot side and we normally order things medium - hot. I didn't use a whole jalapeño either because of the cayenne.

This was really delicious! I used a Fresno pepper instead of a jalapeño as it was all I had on hand. I also added garam masala as suggested by another reviewer. It was spicy but the perfect level of hotness for me. I served it over rice, with naan bread on the side,  and it was fantastic!

I stopped the recipe right after I grilled the chicken. The taste wasn't very impressive. Maybe the tomato sauce would have enhanced the flavor, but for the chicken alone, the taste wasn't very good.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I used it to introduce my family to Indian cuisine, and it was a massive hit.  In keeping with the reviews before mine, I chose not to add any salt, but I also substituted 1 tsp of ground red pepper for the 2 tsp cayenne pepper and swapped the jalapeño out in favor of more accessible crushed red pepper flakes.  Rather than grill the chicken, I marinated it in the yogurt mixture for an hour and then baked it for about an hour before serving it over rice.  Absolutely wonderful.

For extra flavor, try keeping the chicken breasts intact and layer some pineapple slices in between the rice bed and the chicken before you pour the sauce!

Wow!!! This recipe is absolutely terrific! I was literally licking the spoon and pit so I didn't waste any last bit ? I did make modifications based upon the reviews - I used 1 tsp of salt and traded the cinnamon for 1 tsp of garam masala in the marinade. I did the same in the sauce and the results were spectacular. This may have been the best meal I've ever cooked!!! Thanks for helping make me look like an all-star!

I toned down the spicy seasonings and eliminated the salt almost completely.  It was delicious!  The only mistake I made was making white rice instead of basmati rice.  Will def. make again.

This recipe was pretty good.  I really liked the spice that the jalepeno peppers added.  I felt that the spices weren't quite right and added some garam masala which helped to bring a lot more flavor to the dish.

My husband and I tried this recipe and really enjoyed it! We tried it exactly how the recipe was written (with the exception of halving the salt) and next time we will modify to reduce the heat a bit for my sake.

After reading the reviews and knowing my tendency to over salt things, I cut the salt (normal table salt, not sea salt or kosher salt) in half from the suggested recipe and it was still way too salty to eat.  

I can also see where cutting out the Jalapeno would be better for most folks, because even the one mild and de-seeded one I used really turned up the heat on the overall recipe.  

Additionally, we could have cut the amount of chicken in half, as I had not nearly enough sauce to go with the protein.  I ended up making a 2nd batch of sauce which also helped a bit to cut the saltiness and heat.  That served with basmati rice and nan, fed my family of (3) twice over. 

I will give it another go with these adjustments in mind and adding the Garam Marsala.

I love this recipe I didn't have a Jalapeno pepper so used some red pepper flakes and added some Masala Pdr that i had for the sauce, I also used half and half since i didn't have heavy cream. 
It was very good, next time i am going to serve it with grilled veggies like in the photo. Thanks for posting recipe.

Has a very good flavor, but the paprika comes through a little strong. I would use a bit less.

This recipe was amazingly good! My picky children enjoyed it. However, I did do a few things different. I doubled the sauce, added a half onion minced to the actual sauce (not the marinade), I used ginger paste instead of minced ginger & seasoned with salt & cayenne to my own taste. My husband inhaled it! Hahaha thanks for the great recipe.

This is the first indian dish I've ever tried to make and it has the potential to be great! The only changes I'd make is to cut the suggested salt in half. As the recipe is written, WHOA! Way too salty! I'd also use only half a jalapeno. I like spicy but using the whole jalapeno was uncomfortably spicy. Other than those minor changes, this is a good recipe. I'm going to give it another shot.

Excellent recipe with one glaring exception.  NO garam masala in a chicken "masala" recipe? Add 2 teaspoons of garam masala to the recipe. Please note the "salt to taste".  MUCH less salt than the maximum is needed for this recipe. After making these changes to the recipe it has become a favorite.  Not quite the taste of the authentic Indian restaurant in town, but very good.

I loved this recipe, but I have to say, make sure that you watch the salt in the sauce portion of the recipe.  It was a little on the salty side so I would caution you to taste first, salt and then taste again as you add your teaspoons.  Otherwise, fabulous!  My guests loved it!  I served it with baked yams.  The sweetness of the yams was a nice compliment to the spicy flavors of the dish.

I wouldn't know if this recipe was good because the amount of salt it called for was outrageous and it ruined the dish. I had to add so much more random stuff to try to fix the saltiness and it's still too salty. This is why I don't follow recipes!

Amazing recipe, but for the first time it took us a little over three hours to make it, but only 10 min to eat it!! It will probably go faster next time. We did not add the jalapeño and cut back on the salt (we used about 1/2 tsp) and cayenne pepper (we used just under 1 tsp) and it was soooooooo good!!!! Also the grilled chicken by itself is delicious. Over all a great recipe!

WAY TOO MUCH SALT!!! The flavors would probably have been amazing had it not been for the salt. I would say use a total of 2 tsp max, not 7!! I should had known not to add so much. Yikes!

I read the reviews, and based on that, the only change I made was to eliminate all of the salt, and as I was feeding kids and grandparents, cut the cayenne pepper in half.   Fantastic recipe - I could drink the sauce - truly outstanding!!

Fifteen years ago there was a family owned curry place around the corner from my house in Cambridge England. They made a chicken masala that has haunted my taste buds for years. I have searched the net for years for a recipe that comes close- and here it is. I made a few modifications the second time I made it, but those were just personal taste. This is the best tika masala I have found. Well done!

This recipe is very good and easy to make and similar to what you would get in an Indian restaurant. I would agree with the other reviews in saying that you don't need all that salt. We put two teaspoons total for the marinade and the sauce and it was more than enough. We also cut the cream in half as I didn't want it to be milky. It was still quite creamy and the thickness was perfect. It had some spiciness to it but I would add extra peppers if you really like that extra kick. Very good overall.

Delicious! but needed major alterations. I took out ALL the salt. added a tsp of gara masala to both the sauce and the chicken. cooked chicken for 5 min tops. added one onion and 3 garlic cloves to sauce. added garlic to chicken also. used a whole can (15oz) of tomato sauce instead of 8oz.

Amazing flavor minimal effort! I made this with some substitutions for gluten/dairy free dieters and got rave reviews! Instead of cow yogurt I used goat for the marinade,  added lemon zest, reduced the cayenne, used grill pieces left whole instead of cut on skewers. Since it was our Christmas dinner and not warm enough for the grill,  I baked in the oven at 350 degrees for an hour, flipped midway.  For the sauce I omitted the jalapeno,  used olive oil and coconut milk instead of butter and cream.  Used a can of diced san marzano tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce and added a half cup of fresh mint to garnish with the cilantro. Divine.

I followed the recipe exactly and the 3 teaspoons it says to add to the sauce ruined the recipe. The flavors in the chicken & sauce were great but unfortunately the salt made it not edible. We'll definitely make it again but with minimal salt.

Awesome recipe - IF you cut the salt wayyyy back. I love salty food and add salt to everything, but this was so salty it burned my tongue. If you cut the salt in the marinade to 1 tsp instead of 4 and cut down salt to 1 tsp instead of 3 in the sauce, it's just perfect. Very spicy, very yummy. Best home-cooked tikka masala I've ever had.

DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe to the letter except for using half-n-half (what I had on hand). I broiled the chicken as it's in the 20s outside tonight. Just love it! Reminds me of tikka masala I've had in Indian restaurants. I was surprised by the amount of salt, but the dish did not taste too salty. That said, I think I'd cut a teaspoon of salt out of the marinade next time. And there will be a next time!

The best tikka masala recipe I have tried. Fantastic!! My husband doesn't like spicy food so I took out the jalapeño and I didn't have cream so I just used some corn starch and it came out perfect. I've made this countless times (always missing some ingredient) but delicious none the less. Thank you for sharing

Following the recipe - the chicken came out way to salty for my taste.

I will need to revisit the recipe without adding any salt next time.

I think the amount of salt called for in this recipe must be a typo.  Otherwise, seems like a good recipe.  I'll try it again with a rational amount of salt but I can't stress enough. . .TOO MUCH SALT!

Few things, too much salt.

Secondly you just melt the butter. Indian dishes do not use clarified butter they use ghee which is basically beurre noisette with the milk solids taken out. You have to cook the butter till the water boils out, and then you have to continue cooking the butter until the milk solids toast and the butter turns brown, which gives the butter a slightly nutty taste, the butter will smell sweet and very rich like caramel. The butter when mixed into dishes is what gives all Indian dishes that true taste.

From here you can either use the butter with the milk solids, or you can drain out the solids for true ghee.

I didn't go through making the sauce, just the chicken and served it with salad and wheat flatbreatd.

Extremely delicious!  I did add 2 red chilies finely chopped to the marinade which added some great heat.

One thing I must say, I didn't bother adding salt and it really was fine.  I like salt in my food but left it out to add later and honestly I didn't find it needing any.  So I would suggest you not use as much 4tsp seems like a lot.

Can't wait to make it again.

This recipe has too much salt in it. It is very good however without the salt. It is spicy and flavorful enough without any addition of salt. And I would double the tomato sauce because I like a more tomato-y sauce and not a creamy one. I used light cream to minimize the calories. I would also replace the yogurt used to marinate with sour cream, as it adds a lovely richer flavor.

Made this for the first time for dinner last night. While I enjoy Indian food, I've never made it and was unsure how my family would like it. I followed the suggestions and reduced the salt, added garam masala and doubled up on the sauce.  I also used coconut milk instead of heavy cream. The key for me with the sauce was to taste it at every stage to make sure the spice blend was what I wanted. This was delicious. I was looking forward to leftovers for lunch today but there was nothing left. Another plus in my book: we'll be able to enjoy it often since I usually have all the ingredients on hand.

This recipe has the potential to be awesome, but the amount of salt is ridiculous. I did the recipe verbatim the first time (I always do), but I am going to try it again with 1/3 - 1/2 the amount of salt next time. The recipe is definitely a keeper, once the right amount of salt is figured out.

I tried this recipe and it was fabulous! I did make the adjustments suggested by other reviewers. I only added a 1/2 tsp of salt to the entire dish. Doubled the recipe for the sauce and added 2 tsp of garam masala to the sauce which really is KEY! Skipped the skewers and just grilled the chicken cubes in a cast iron skillet on top of the stove. Served over brown basamati rice. Amazing! This is a keeper!

This turned out wonderfully delicious!! Since I've never had it before, I don't know how it should actually taste. Hence, the four stars. I also cut back some of the salt. This is a very rich dish; I will make again.

This recipe would be 5 stars if the seasoning quantities were accurate! No changes needed for the marinade, but the sauce was so far off!  I followed the recipe and it was so inedible I had to quadruple the tomato sauce and the cream while only doubling the garlic, cumin and paprika to make it edible.  Even then there was still too much salt!  I will make it again and I will probably leave the salt completely out of the sauce of only use 1/2 a teaspoon...Also- the chicken on its own was incredible!  I will make the marinade again and add zucchini, onions, peppers, etc to the skewers and eat those on their own-YUM!!!

This recipe turned out amazing!! Best Indian food I have had. I altered the recipe a little bit. Instead of yogurt I just used whipping cream. Didn't use as much salt as the recipe called for. Also only used a third of a jalapeño. Then for the tomato sauce I only added half a cup of cream, because my boyfriend doesn't like creamy stuff. It turned out so good!!!

We make this dish at least once a month at our house, and it's our absolute favorite! We cut the salt down quite a bit (1 TSP for the marinade and 1/2 TSP in the skillet), doubled the amount of garlic and jalapeno (we love spicy), and cooked the chicken in the oven instead of grilling. We serve with basmati rice and garlic naan.

Chicken tikka masala is one of my favorite foods. I have had it at a number of different restaurants and tried out at least 5 different recipes, but this one is my go-to recipe. It is easy and the ingredients are much more readily available than in some recipes you will find, but it still tastes authentic (well, as authentic as your typical anglo-indian restuarant). I made a few minor changes to tweak the flavor: I replace the cumin/cinnamon/pepper mix with 5 tsp garam masala. I add cayenne pepper to the sauce- about 1 tsp is enough to make it about medium heat. I only use about half the salt this recipe calls for.

I tried the recipe as is, the salt was just too overpowering.  I will try this again minus the salt.

I LOVE this, however, I always add the yummy marinade of the chicken in to the tomato simmer. It brings out an amazing flavor.

Awesome recipe! First time I've made chicken tikka masala & I plan to keep on a regular rotation at our house! I did listen to a previous suggestion to omit the salt altogether & otherwise made it verbatim also. D-e-l- i-c-i-o-u-s!

Perfect other than the salt. I would use maybe a half of a teaspoon not 3 whole teaspoons. Spicy but good,

Excellent recipe. Cut the salt down A LOT. I am planning on using just the marinade sometime as well, the chicken tasted great before I put it in the sauce.

This was absolutely phenomenal!  I am a wimp when it comes to hot spices so I left out the jalapeno pepper and reduced the cayenne. It was perfect for me. I tasted the sauce as it was simmering, before I added the chicken and at that point in the process, I wasn't crazy about it. But after I added the chicken, and the flavors from the yogurt marinade melded with the sauce, it was every bit as good as anything I've ever had in an Indian restaurant.  Served with basmati rice, scented with cardamom.

I heard this recipe was salty, but only after reading the comments on here after cooking the dish. While eating (before knowing many thought this dish is too salty) I didn't notice an excess of salt, but I did think to myself while putting it in that it was a lot. This was my first time making tikka masala and was very happy with the results. Some users suggest modifying the recipe, which I think is a good idea, given your preferences. I did find it to be spicy, but nicely so.

I keep making this with LOTS of positive feedback, BUT i have tailored the spices and the sauce to my liking..,PLEASE be aware that when doubling or tripling (as I do) this recipe- it seems the amount of spices ESPECIALLY the ginger and salt- do NOT have to be doubled or tripled......I also added a dash of garam masala to the sauce which made it taste great! You definitely NEED to TRIPLE the sauce recipe. I do a 28 oz can of purée with an 8 oz can of sauce and that makes the perfect amount of sauce to chicken ratio. Don't you want something saucy to mix with your rice?? The person who made this recipe must just like the chicken to have a little sauce on it...because you will not have ANY for your rice if you just use that recipe....
I use 9 chicken breast tenderloins for all this sauce and it works out perfectly! Tailor it to your liking- my advice would be start small with the spices then gradually add more if you want- instead of heaping all that spice in that it calls for and finding out the hard way like me!

Next time I will not be using the full amount of tomato sauce as it is far to powerful for my tastes. Otherwise I dig it and will use it next time and see what else I want to change.

I cut half the salt, per others advice and it was perfect.  I also didn't have paprika, only smoked paprika.  I was afraid it would hurt the flavor of the dish, but it turned out wonderful.  I also broiled the chicken on some foil instead of breaking out the grill.  Great recipe!

I reaaally wish I would've read the other reviews before trying this (or used common sense)... definitely a good recipe but as everyone else said there is waaaay too much salt. I would maybe decrease to 1 t. for the marinade and 1/2-1 t. for the sauce. Definitely going to make this again exactly the same but with the reduced salt. It tastes like I dropped the chicken tikka masala into the ocean. Good level of spiciness though.

After reading the reviews I decided to make this adding salt to taste rather than the amounts listed. I ended up using about 1/2t of salt total. I added the jalapeno and cayenne to taste as well because the tikka masala I am used to is not spicy at all, rather its fairly sweet. The end result was close to what I am used to and would make it again. Thanks for posting this recipe.

Prepared as written, this recipe contains WAY too much salt.  It was completely inedible. I might try it again without the salt, as the meat was tender and the flavor otherwise seemed to be good.  But if you're trying this for the first time, I would suggest cutting out ALL salt until the very end, then season lightly as necessary.

A good starting point, but too many necessary changes to rate it 5 stars. Ignored the salt entirely (possibly the recipe author used unsalted tomato sauce?). I used greek yogurt, thinned with a little milk, for the marinade. In the marinade, I replaced 1 tsp of cumin and all of the cinnamon with garam masala; my garam masala has cinnamon in it already, so no point adding more. I also skipping both kinds of pepper, since I was feeding a small child. I marinated for 3 hours and cooked on my electric grill. In the sauce, I replaced one tsp of the cumin with garam masala, and replaced a tiny bit of paprika with smoked paprika. I also used low-fat evaporated milk instead of cream. The result: not quite restaurant quality, but still very good, and definitely the best home recipe I've found! The methodology is sound, and the spices might well work if you don't have garam masala - but that salt, yikes!

I have used this recipe for years! The only problem is that in the end, it tastes slightly bland. I've found that by adding 1 teaspoon eteach of chicken curry, chicken tikka, and similar powders (you can find these at an indian grocery store or sometimes at your local store) it adds much needed spiceful flavor. I literally add a teaspoon of a few powders to the sauce and it takes it to another level.

Very tasty! I halved the salt and omitted the cayenne pepper. I pan fried the chicken instead of grilling it. And I also cut out the lemon juice which would have tenderized the chicken a bit, but if you just cook the chicken for a little bit longer at a slightly lower temperature you can get tender chicken without the acidity of the lemon juice. This is a good recipe if you cut down the salt.

This was very good. I used 2 chicken breasts but left all the other measurements the same so the marinade was nice and thick and there was extra sauce. I served over jasmine rice. I did cut down the cayenne to 1 tsp. It had a nice kick but not overpowering. I also left out the salt. I garnished with basil instead of cilantro and thought the basil was the perfect compliment.

This recipe as written is way too salty!  I didn't read the reviews before making, but went ahead and only used about 1/3rd of the salt because it seemed like way to much to me.  Even with cutting back it was too salty; I kept having to dilute the sauce down to make it better.

This recipe is great!  It tastes like restaurant quality Tikka Masala!  I left out the jalapeno.  In the restaurant when asked the hotness level I always choose 2 out of 10...im a wimp! :-)

I found this recipe and my family is VERY hard to please but we LOVE IT! We have spread this recipe around! YES~ we tweeked it but every good cook does. You should be able to make it fit your needs if you know you don't enjoy a spice or flavor. It's not the quickest thing to make but the process of cooking this is enjoyable if you make it that way and worth it. Break up the steps if you need to. That's why there is wine! Who ever submitted this~ my hat is off to you!

Pretty good! Although not as flavorful as I had hoped, my hubs and I both agree that this was still pretty darn good! Per the advice of others, I cut back on the salt and spice (by half). I'm glad to have been forewarned about the salt (this would have been WAAAAY too salty as written and was even verging on being too salty after cutting back considerably), but wish I would have left the spice as is. This was not nearly spicy enough for us (or at all). I think the heat level is spot on and would suggest NOT adjusting it. Since Chibi Chef's visually stunning photo looked SO appetizing, I couldn't resist following her lead.... I too served my masala over (jasmine) rice and grilled zucchini that I seasoned with s&p and tossed with a touch of garlic infused EVOO (perfect!). Grilled naan tied everything together. Thanks for sharing your recipe with the AR community, Yakuta! :-)

Way too much salt. I should have read the reviews before I made it. I only put in half of what the recipe calls for and I couldn't eat 2 bites of it. I'm not sure if the recipe even had a flavor other than salt.

Absolutely delicious!  As many have said, there is way too much salt.  I put 1 tsp in the yogurt mixture, and about 1/2 tsp in the sauce, and that was plenty.  I think it really benefits from doubling or tripling the lemon juice.  I also added a whole onion before the garlic/jalapeno, and did not cook it too much, so that it retains its body when it's simmered in the sauce.  This is a fantastic recipe!!

I did not read the reviews before making this dish this evening (5/12/13) and, followed the directions exactly according to the recipe.  My husband and I did not feel that it was too salty like others commented.  I used a very fine sea salt from Whole Foods for the marinade and, I ground fresh sea salt for the sauce.  The dish was delicious and, not too salty.  I love spice but, my husband thought that this was a little too spicy so, next time, I may reduce the amount of cayenne that the recipe calls for.  I will try other Chicken Tikka Masala recipes but, this was a winner for me. I have made two trips to India and, I felt that this recipe was very authentic!!

It was OK....not the best or worst I've ever had.  I cut down on the salt and still thought it was a little too salty.  I doubled the sauce because I like extra to soak up with my naan...but it nevered thickened up and seemed one-dimentional. I may look around for other recipes or try to tweak this one.

I made it with no salt and only a pinch or two bit of paprika, blended the Jalpeno in the blender with the tomato sauce instead of little peices and it tasted great. Next time I may cut down on the amount of cream, just to see how it turns. 

Also we cooked the chicken on the george forman grill, just lined it with aluminum foil, it was a little  messy but nothing 1 papertowel couldn't clean up.

This recipe was amazing. I've tried one before (trying to recreate my favorite Indian dish, from my favorite Indian restaurant) and it wasn't very good. This one is almost exactly like what I get from the restaurant! Delicious sauce, great chicken. With some rice, it's to die for.
I didn't have a grill to use (freak windstorm destroyed ours) so I used two stove top pans, lightly oiled on high heat. Let them brown, then cooked for the rest of the 5 minutes on medium high. Flipped and repeated. End result was awesome.
I also added some fresh, toasted and slightly crushed cumin seeds into the marinade. I also cut back on the salt, by a lot. Seemed like it called for too much. But really, this is great! A must do.

So much cumin! Everyone's talking about how much salt this has but I have to mention that this is really REALLY cumin-y. The amount of cumin in this is really overpowering. I used half of what's listed in the marinade and none in the sauce and all you can taste is cumin powder.

I love this recipe. It tastes just like the Tikka Masala at the authentic restaurant which is an hour drive from here. I substituted One Teaspoon of Cumin for a teaspoon of Garam Masala in both the Chicken marinade and sauce recipe. And like everyone else says, cut the salt. I sprinkle in a pinch for taste and it always just comes out awesome. Usually I try to do the recipe the original way the first time around but I skipped the original amount of salt because that is just way too much. Thank you so much to whoever uploaded this, it's awesome. Oh, please note that the recipe is a bit spicy because well it is Indian food they tend to like the spice. So if you don't like too much spice I suggest cutting out a teaspoon of the cayenne pepper and black pepper as well as skip the jalapeno pepper.

Following this recipe exactly, it's almost perfect.  It has the right amount of spice and great flavors.  Just waaaay too much salt.  And I'm not averse to salt.  I love it.  Way too much.  And this still was way too much for me.  It completely overpowered the rest of the great flavors.  Cut down the salt from 6 tsp to 2 tsp, and this should make a great meal!

Reducing the salt to 1 teaspoon and swapping garam masala for cinnamon makes this recipe a winner in my house. I've made it 3 times this week and my fiance keeps asking for more!

This recipe needs to be revised or deleted.  I shouldn't have to waste a perfectly good meal because I didn't get to the reviews.  The salt quantities are a joke and I should have used my better judgment but instead followed the recipe for at least the marinade to a tee and then got my head together and didn't add any to the sauce but it was still inedible. I won't even try it again.

LOVE IT!!! Was just right. Sure a little adjustments to the salt but with all the comments about how it had too much salt you saw very little reaction after they made the adjustments (if they made the adjustments). This was very filling and for those who commented about the salt being too much, why not make the adjustments then comment about how you fixed it as well as a follow up rating. Love criticisms that are arbitrary.

I couldn't decide if this deserved a full five stars because of a glaring issue in the ingredient list, but it turned out so delicious (with a simple but extremely important change!) that I couldn't help it. It is fantastic *if* you cut out the majority of the salt. I used half a teaspoon in the marinade and another half teaspoon in the sauce, and it was plenty for even our salt-loving household. I also cut the black pepper to half a teaspoon, used 3/4 cup Greek yogurt and 1/4 cup cream in place of 1 cup regular yogurt (which would be just as good, it just wasn't what I had), and pulled it from the grill when it was still ever so slightly underdone so it wouldn't get overcooked while simmering in the sauce. I love that it is so flavorful and interesting without requiring any ingredients that are hard to acquire at my small town grocery. My husband and I are big fans of Indian food, and this was well-received by everyone who tried it. It will be a part of our regular rotation from now on.

This was OK.  I was hoping it would taste more like my favorite Indian restaurant's version.  I used the coconut milk instead of heavy cream, and I think that helped a bit.  Will keep tinkering...

We have made this time and time again.  The kids eat it with less cayanne.  No other changes.  Dish does taste better when I grill the meat but sometimes the snow is bit deep in Maine.

Like others, I reduced salt to 2 teas total and reduced cumin by 1/2 teas in both marinade and the sauce and added 1/2 teas of fenugreek to both marinade & sauce.   Also, substituted ghee for oil/butter.    I made the first time for guests....it was a hit.   Served with Indian Saffron Rice and naan.

The marinade is very delicious and the chicken ended up so tender.  The chicken really tasted like the chicken I have had in my chicken tikka masala at restaurants (dallas, cincinatti, shreveport,etc.) But the sauce was not anything like chicken tikka masala I have had at many Indian food restaurants.  It wasn't bad though.  Chicken tikka masala I have had and what I was shooting for was much lighter and sweeter.  I added a bit of sugar and added some additional heavy whipping cream to cut down on how spicy it was (not hot, but just overpowering spice flavor) I think it's the paprika that might be throwing it off.  Anyhow it was still good enough for me to tinker with the sauce and see if I can get it tasting more to my family's liking.  But the marinade, 5 stars!  I also cut salt in half for both marinade and sauce as per many reviews abd thought it was perfectly salted.  I am still surprised at all the reviews about it tasting like authentic Indian chicken tikka masala.

I loved this recipe.  I have tried others previously, but they fell far short of expectations.  The jalepenos in this recipe were great.  I picked up some naan from Trader Joes and cooked up some basmati rice.  Perfect for Indian-at-home.  My brother and I made it together first, and then he made it for his girlfriend for a romantic dinner and made a big impression.  I pretty much never cook with salt anyway, so I didn't run into trouble with the salt.  I made this recipe once with Greek yogurt since I had it handy, but it was not good.  It stuck to the chicken and had this tofu-like texture after cooking.  Stick with regular yogurt!

I love Chicken Tikka Masala and was looking forward to my first bite of this recipe, but was disappointed by the salt. I actually made it tonight for my mother (a wonderful cook herself), who was coming over to babysit my 9 month-old. I really wanted to give her a nice meal to say, "thank you" for her help, but ended up being embarrassed by this faulty recipe. Either diminish the salt content or look for another recipe.

Great recipe. I used other reviewers suggestions and reduced the salt to just 2 tsp total, next time I will use even less. I also ommited jalepeno peppers since my family doesnt like spicy and broiled the chicken in the oven for 5-10 min instead of the grill (Its snowing here)

Amazing. Based on reviews, I omitted the salt. The cinnamon was a little overpowering to me, so next time I make this I will halve that ingredient.

I just made a version of this and could not be happier of how great did it turn! 
My husband who always criticizes my cooking ate two plates after a pretty satisfying lunch. Thank you for your recipe and the inspiration!

I lived in Britain for a year in 1984 and had Indian food for the first time. Food in Britain, at least then, held little interest but we loved Indian. Since then I've searched for Chicken Tikka recipes and finally have one. The heat is fine with me (I live in Texas), but for those with tamer pallettes I would suggest dimming down the heat. Also a few of you have inquired about using non-fat cream and let me say that that's what I used and the recipe is still great. So substitute away! In fact even if you don't need to do this for your weight, you might just consider your heart:) Wonderful recipe.

A good healthy amount of spice in this one.  Served over Quinoa. Only change I made was to use skim milk instead of cream.

My first time cooking an Indian dish and it turned out great. Absolutely delicious! However, I read the reviews and reduced the salt to 1 and 1/2 teaspoon for the marinade and also for the sauce. This chicken tikka masala taste different compared to the ones I had in local restaurants which tends to be less creamy and more spicy. Anyway, thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe. God bless!

Very good...but like many of the other ratings stated...WAY TOO MUCH SALT.  Also very spicy but like I said it was really good.  Even through all of the salt I loved it.  Can't wait to try it again and only put in a teeny tiny bit of salt.

I hate to mark this a 3, because it would be a great recipe without the amount of salt that it called for in the sauce.  I think it must have been a mistake.  Please, add salt to taste, not the amount in the recipe.  It may need none because of the tomato paste, or it may need a bit. It does not need a tablespoon (3 tsp)!.

Love love love this recipe!!!  This is a really good one.  All the spices marry together so well.  My husband and kid love it!  I have to tone down the cayenne next time I make this again.  My daughter loves it but she can't eat too much because it's too hot for her.

Easy to follow, and comes out delicious. Very Flavorful! Its kind of cold out, so instead of grilling the pieces, I just put the pieces under the broiler (also took out the step of skewering) for about 7 minutes. Served it on rice, it was perfect.

This is delicious and simple. I used it as an appetizer and instead of skewering and BBQ I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and grilled on a grill pan over te stove. I served it with a yogurt cucumber dip.   You will need to spritz the pan with oil. I doubled the chicken amount and what was left went into the cream/tomato sauce for another dinner.  Really yummy and versatile. Enjoy

Whatever you do do NOT put as much salt in this dish as it calls for!!! I would have really enjoyed this dish, despite the couple hours it took, had I put maybe one teaspoon of salt in. I couldn't eat it because it was too salty. I will make again though, just minus about 4 teaspoons salt.

Has outstanding potential. I've made this once, and followed the recipe exactly. Unfortunately, this made it the most salty thing I've ever cooked. Going to try it again with no salt. Update tried it again with no salt and it was amazing!!!!

(modified: lowered salt to 1 tsp each per marinade and sauce) The recipe tasted all right the night I made it. The next day leftovers did not hold up well. there's too much cumin in the recipe too. I will be looking for a better recipe.

Hit with the family.  We will have this again and again.  I will add LESS salt next time.  Too salty for our tastes.  Delicious otherwise.

Too much salt.  I guess it was our fault that we didn't read the ratings before making the dish...  I used less than was called for, but not by much. We ended up adding milk and half and half to tame the salty flavor.  I don't know that I will make this dish in the future; even using less salt.  I don't think it tastes much like Chicken Tikka Masala.

First time I've made this and it was very successful. Followed the recipe with 2 alterations. Firstly, I didn't have any cayenne pepper so used paprika instead. Secondly, I omitted the salt. I purposely started making my own curries so I could control the amount of salt and saturated fat in my food. I suspect the amount of salt should be 1/4 teaspoon rather 4 teaspoons.

I didn't skewer or grill the meat either. Simply placed on a baking tray, oven at it's highest heat setting; cooked for approx 10-15 mins or until the meat starts to get the char grilled look. Lovely!!

This was excellent! Yuuummmm, I'm about to have seconds! I could pretty much eat Indian every day, so this is definitely going to be a new staple in my house! I didn't put ANY salt in the marinade and just a sprinkle in the sauce. I used thighs & legs, which to me is more moist. Our grill is broken, so I broiled the chicken, then cut it off the bones. I also only used about half of a jalapeno because nobody in my family can handle much heat. I served with homemade naan, and it was a BIG hit!

This was my first attempt at Indian cuisine and it was a huge hit.  I love this in restaurants so I wanted to give it a shot.  The time and ingredients are worth it.  I will be making this again!

Fantastic! Love the sauce!!! To control the heat be careful with the jalepeno seeds. I don't have a grill so I cooked the chicken in the oven Im sure with a grill it would have been even better!

Wonderful Recipe!!!  I eased up on the salt to two teaspoons for the marinade and one teaspoon for the sauce.  Terrific taste!

Delicious.  I've made this recipe a few times and have found that the hotter your grill, the better the flavor.  I love to try out other yogurt marinades and cook them in a similar fashion.  Adding coconut milk in addition to the cream was deeeelish as well.

WAY too much salt per recipe. I cut it down to about a fourth of what is recommended. "To taste" indeed! Otherwise absolutely delicious.

This is the best chicken I have ever had.  I cooked the chicken in a little olive oil instead of on the grill then set aside and made the sauce.  It is very tasty and I will be making it in the future again.

This is an absolutely amazing recipe. I took other's advice and put used Gharam Masala instead of cinnamon. I also used coconut milk instead of heavy cream. I made it the first night with heavy cream the next night with coconut milk. It was amazing. I usually get this at my local Pakistani restaurant that makes amazing food. Dude this was sooo much better. Thank you for the amazing recipe.

I wish I had read the reviews before making this recipe. Being it was a new recipe (to me), I followed it. It was WAY too salty. Had it not been so salty, this would have been a great dish. It had great flavor otherwise, was easy to prepare and what appealed to me was that I had most of the ingredients on-hand. Definitley cut back the salt when preparing this dish.

This was very good, but too salty (and I cut back on the salt I added!). My recommendation is to use half the salt wherever it calls for it! It Very, very authentic and delicious though, and I would definitely make it again.

I substituted Seitan for Chicken, and as such was unable to properly grill it according to the recipe, but ultimately, the meal was incredibly savory and just plain delicious.

I should have read the reviews before making the recipe, but i saw it had lots of stars, and I skipped the reviews.  I'll go ahead and for this recipe 4 stars, but as is, it barely deserves one star!  This recipe is WAY to salty as is.  I added one less teaspoon to each the sauce and the marinade (7 teaspoons total seemed like a lot).  Even with less salt added, it was barely edible, the salt was SO overpowering.  The flavors are good though.  We ended up adding the remainder of the pot of yogurt to try to balance out the salt, and we were able to finish a small serving, along with 2-3 glasses of water each, but still WAY too salty.  Next time I will add a pinch of salt to the marinade and salt the sauce to taste, after the chicken has been added.  Definitely worth making again though, and it smelled amazing.

I definitely cut down on the salt big time.  I also substituted part of the cream with yogurt; it gives a bit more of a sour flavor, but it's really good!  I also use a big can of tomato sauce (the 26 oz size, I believe, or whatever's closest) and more cream/yogurt mixture.  Finally, I use a generous amount of garam masala and occasionally throw in shrimp for the last five minutes.  I make this recipe a LOT, it's really good, easy to make, and with my changes it tastes just like the Indian restaurants'...except that I don't add ghee like they do.

I have made this recipe about 5 times and based on the previous reviews, I have always left out the salt. I forgot this last time and I could barely eat it. I started making this recipe before I had ever tried it in any restaurant and when I finally did try a "professional" version, I was happily surprised at how excellent this recipe is.  I think the heat is just right. I usually order mine at a medium and this has just the right kick for me. So, this is a 5 star recipe (if you leave out the salt, or just stick to "salt to taste")!

Followed this recipe exactly, then made it twice more tweaking some things. Although my husband and I love spicy food, we preferred using only one tsp cayenne pepper and no jalapeno. I would also cut down on the salt, with the written amount of salt it was extremely salty. One reviewer tip that I liked was broiling the chicken chunks for a few minutes on each side, doesn't require placing chicken on skewers. I think I still prefer Indian restaurants to this recipe, but it comes close!

We lived in India in the 60's.  We used to eat at a restaurant called Moti Mahal.  They served butter chicken.  When I saw this recipe, I knew it was like what we had eaten there and it was!  I would not change anything, but since I like hot food, I would add a bit more hot pepper.  This is so very good.

I am so surprised at the high ratings for this recipe!  I did not enjoy it at all.  I'm not sure where other reviewers have eaten to get a basis for comparison, but it did not taste like what has been prepared for me in the past at restaurants.  In fact, the addition of the cumin reminded me of tacos.  I agree with other, the amount of salt is ridiculous.  I added two teaspoons total and it seemed like too much.  We ended up refrigerating this dish to save for taco night (didn't want to waste!) and ordered from the Indian restaurant down the street. Complete disappointment.

Obviously, too much salt. It is an ok base, but I found myself trying to "doctor" it constantly. The spices are too understated and there is not enough sauce. Look for another recipe.

This is my favorite dish when we visit our local Indian food restaurant, so I was tickled to find this recipe - and to see that I had most of the spices handy already. I cooked this for my husband and his brothers, and they liked it. The only complaint was that it was too salty. I'd definitely give this a whirl again, but with less salt :)

This was delicious, but you definitely have to adjust the spices and salt to taste. I used one teaspoon of salt each for the marinade and sauce and that was just right for us. I also used half of a jalapeno, seeded and adjusted the cayenne pepper down so my kids would eat it. It had a nice touch of heat and great flavor.

This was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I only used 1/4 tsp of salt in lieu of others saying the salt as written was way too much! I will be making this dish from now on.

I have made Chicken Tikka Masala before from a similar recipe as this one and it turned out great! However, I doubled the ingredients for the sauce and it was too salty!!!!

I wanted to try this ever since I saw it on Kitchen Impossible. If you want to save yourself some time and ingredients just dust some chicken with taco or fajita seasoning and grill it. Mix a little of the taco seasoning in the yogurt and you have your sauce. I bet you get similar results. I should say that I am not a huge fan of tacos, maybe that is why I wasn't thrilled with this recipe.

Made this recipe a few days ago and was blown away!!! Like others I cut back on the salt 1 teaspoon for the marinade and one for the sauce. I added extra garlic and a little extra ginger other than that flow the recipe and you will not be disappointed. For sides I made some hummus and asparaguses and some nice warm pita bread. Both my mother and father were delighted with the outcome.

Far too salty, but otherwise GREAT flavor!  Although I cut the chicken in larger chunks because I didn't want to use skewers, it stuck horribly to the grill.  I think next time I will use a well-greased grill basket instead of trying to cook the chicken directly on the grill.  Re: salt, I'd recommend no more than 1 tsp in the martinade and 1/2 tsp in the sauce.  Also, the sauce - while amazing in flavor - was pretty thick and I will try to lighten it up by substituting 1/2 milk for the heavy cream.  I will make this one again (maybe even next week) with the above adjustments.

Good, but WAY salty!  I read the other reviews that said the same, so I decreased from the recommended 7 tspns to just 1 1/2 tspns and it was still too much.  I think I might just go with 1/2 tspn or none at all next time.

I definitely made a few changes after reading the reviews. I cut the salt down to 1 tsp of salt for the marinade and 1 tsp for the sauce. My chicken was very dry from the broiler so in the future I will just add the chicken to my sauce and let it cook. Also 1 tsp of cinnamon was way too overpowering for me, I would go for 1/2 tsp. To keep it diet friendly, I doubled the sauce with 2 8oz cans of tomato sauce and only used 1 cup of light heavy cream. I see this being a great recipe to work off from but a few adjustments would have to be made.

Inedible as written.  Take all the salt out of the sauce and it'd probably be good.

AMAZING! I followed this recipe pretty closely--just added a little turmeric to the chicken marinade for a little something extra, used smoked paprika instead of regular, and also used fat-free half-and-half instead of the heavy cream to make it a little figure-friendly. And used just a little olive oil instead of the butter. Served with Jasmine rice and grilled naan, and also topped with fresh red onions. Next time I will double or even triple the sauce since it's sooo good! This one's a definite keeper!

Since I've never had this dish before I didnt have anything to compare it to, hut I think its alright (not great). I doubled the recipe. I salted it to taste and omitted the jalepeno. It still came out pretty spicy. It may not be traditional but I think I will add some diced potatoes next time.

Even my kids loved it!!  I did decrease salt based on reviews to 2 tsp total.  Also, because I was making it for my kids, I decreased all peppers by half and eliminated the jalepeno.  It was perfect for kids and hubby and I (though hubby would have enjoyed spicier).  

Everyone requested I make this again.  Yum!

Recipe is delicious, but agree with most of the other reviewers- way too heavy on the salt!  One teaspoon instead of four would be plenty!  Will definitely make it again!

The reccipe was very tasty and spicy hot.  Next time I'll cut back on the recommended salt measurement as it was too salty.  I think you could do without the salt b/c of the variety of the othr spices.  Serve with mango slices to cut the heat.

This recipe takes awhile to make, but is totally worth it! It freezes well so I double the recipe. I don't have a grill, so I broil the chicken pieces in the oven without skewers for a few minutes on each side.

Family loved this dish!

I used two teaspoons of salt in the marinade and one teaspoon in sauce.  Next time I will use only one in each.

I didn't cut chicken breasts into cubes or kabob them-just sliced them lengthwise to create thinner pieces and marinated about 4-5 hours. I did double tomato sauce to accomondate for large pices of chicken.  

Used naan recipe (delis) from this site and served with rice and a string beans.

Plenty of heat and flavor.  Will make again!

I love this. It tastes better the next day. Usually when I make it I 
Slightly burn the garlic and when I eat the tikka the garlic has a better flavor. Once I ate it with homemade noodles and added the pasta broth to it. It was amazing! It was like a spicy Indian soup with noodles.

Not only was this fantastic, it was really fun and easy! This was my first attempt at making anything with curry, and I wasn't sure that everyone would like it, but it was a hit. My kitchen smelled amazing while it was cooking too! Everyone kept poking their heads in to see what was going on! I like spicy foods and if you follow the recipe as directed, you will have plenty of heat! Thanks for a great recipe! It's one of our "go-to" dishes now!

Excellent recipe, EXCEPT THE SALT!!! Beware! I would have given it five stars for the delicious flavor of the sauce, which is a perfect tikka masala, but seriously, you need to cut WAAAAAY back on the salt. Try NO salt in the marinade, and maybe one teaspoon when preparing the sauce.

I ended up making this very late in the day, so that means my husband and I didn't eat until well after 10:00. We were so disappointed with the saltiness of the dish, but when it's that late, what are you going to do? We ate half of it with some delicious curried cauliflower and Trader Joe's garlic naan. I'm going to dump some of the sauce, add another cup of heavy cream and another cup of tomato sauce, and see if that cuts the intense saltiness.

Good recipe, but VERY SALTY. I would recommend exculding the salt in this recipe. The salt in this recipe drowns out the taste of all the other spices.

Love this receipe - made it for the first time last night.  Made some changes (based on a couple of reviews:
- no salt in marinade, only 2tsps in the sauce
- 1 1/2 tbsps of ginger  instead of 1
-1 1/4 tsps of cayenne pepper instead of 2
- 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1
- no jalapenos
- didn't use a grill instead just place chicken in a normal pan

Will try this one again but I think next time I will just make it with the sauce rather than having it sit in the marinade for an hour. I think because it is such a strong sauce that the marinade really isn't needed.  Will let you know.

This is a very tasty dish. However, its taste can be multiplied several times by varying the marinating time. Longer marination can result in better taste and softer chicken. Further, you can improve marination by adding cuts in chicken. I have written a much simpler version of this dish at my blog.

Delicious, and HOT! On recommendation from other reviewers, I halved the cayenne pepper, and then on my own decided to halve the jalapeno. I think I could maybe have done the whole jalapeno but that was plenty for the cayenne, and I like spice. Altogether great! (I also put in only about a third of the salt,, and it was still on the salty-ish side).

excellent Tikka Masala but one pinch (1/4 teaspoon) of salt is plenty in the marinade and also one pinch in the sauce.  I did use lite coconut milk and it made a fantastic sauce.   I'll make this again for sure.  I have NO idea why the recipe calls for so much salt, 4 teaspoons is just crazy !!!!

Kept the salt light, per other reviews and used Garam Masala with the other spices. Very good! Jasmine rice with it is a must.

As per suggestions from others I left out the salt.  I did without the jalapeno but all else I did exactly as the recipe required.   It was spicey but enjoyable.   I can't say that I loved the creaminess of the sauce and I'm surprised that some people said it was like the chicken tikka masala from the Indian restaurants in England.   I don't agree at all.  The chicken tikka we get is much milder and far less creamy.   Anyone going to the UK ...... order it and you'll love it!!!

IF YOU USED ALL THE SALT RECOMMENDED AND RUINED YOUR MASALA DO THIS! ITS AMAZING! I made it will all the salt also and it ruined it.  I was so upset and looking forward to some crazy delicious indian food. BUT... I left it in the fridge for a few days and decided to revive it.  I put all the masala in a slow cooker and added a can of strained black bean, a big can of cream of chicken soup, a can of drained rotel (the can of tamato and green pepper you can find in any store) and water and/or milk to bring the soup to the top of the crock pot.  Let it cook on high for 4-5 hours, reduce to low and add 1 cup of cooked basmati rice.  Let it cook on low for a half hour to an hour - you want a creamy consistancy.  Don't let it cook to long because the rice will go to mush :)  This soup is amazing and SPICY!  mmmmmm

Another winner, winner dinner!!! I made it at my daughter's house and that required some changes. To begin with, she didn't have lemon juice so I had to use lime juice. Secondly, the grill had run out of propane so I had to brown the chicken on the stove top. I also made the mistake of measuring the cayenne pepper over the marinate mixture, so I had too much in the marinade. All that said, it made little difference and the result was outstanding. I doubled the sauce, but really wouldnt' have had to. I had alot left over. I used garam masala for both the marinade and sauce and omitted the cilantro, as we don't like it. Also only added a slight amount of jalapeno and I was afraid I overdid it with the cayenne pepper. I thought the heat was just right. Our 8 year old grandaughter ate it up without batting an eye. I plan on doing a custom recipe so I can duplicate this one! Thanks for the great reciope!

Really delicious recipe but there is no way I'd ever use 7 tsp of salt - that's insane.  I used 1 tsp each in the marinade and the sauce.  The sauce needed it since I used no sodium added tomato sauce.  Next time I will try to omit the salt in the marinade and probably half of the cayenne pepper.  It's pretty hot as is and gets hotter as you keep eating.  Otherwise this recipe is awesome.

So unbelievably good! Like other reviewers, I omitted all but a little less than a teaspoon for each of the two parts where the recipes calls for salt. I used fat free half and half as another reviewer suggested instead of heavy cream and added a little flour in order to get the sauce to thicken up. It is very spicy so if that's not to your liking I'd adjust the amount of cayenne. Served with basmati rice or naan, this dish is just packed with tons of unique flavors!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I made this recipe before ever having tikka masala from an Indian restaurant.  It was so great that when I actually did try it at an Indian restaurant, I was not at all impressed.  I do make some changes to this recipe.  I only put 1.5 teaspoons of salt in the marinade and 1.5 in the sauce.  I also add 1 teaspoon of garam masala to the marinade and sauce as other reviews have stated.  This is so yum! :)

After reading the amount of salt called for I knew this would be to salty for our tastes as we do not eat salt.  I omitted the salt and substituted a reduced amount of no salt to taste.  I made some rice and naan to slop up the sauce.  This was authentic and fabulous.  Even my daughter who isn't a great fan of East Indian food loved it!  I think I'll add an additional jalapeno next time as we like our food spicy.

This is a fabulous recipe if you love this dish! I only made a few changes to it: (1) LESS SALT! I only added a pinch or two to marinade and the sauce. (2) I cut the cayenne pepper in half (1 tsp. instead of 2 tsp.) and it seemed to be just the right amount of spice. (3) I also only used 1/2 a jalepeno when making the sauce. Just a few of my own minor tweaks to make it just the way I wanted it! I suggest you try the same!

Great recipe! I made this dish for the first time tonight and it came out wonderfully.  I made changes to the recipe that others had suggested.  First of all, I did not ANY salt. I don't think it needed it! Second, I used 2 tsp of garam masala and only used 1tsp cumin and 1tsp paprika to the sauce.  Third, I added a chopped onion and an extra clove of garlic to the sauce.  Lastly, I forgot to buy a lemon at the store so I used an orange lol! I served it over brown rice with chickpeas and it was delicious!

This recipe was out of this world good!!  After reading the previous reviews, I eliminated all salt (except 1/2 a teaspoon in both the marinade and sauce) and only used one teaspoon of cayenne but then added a few shakes into the sauce.  It's worth noting that I am a complete sissy when it comes to spicey food but this dish is flavored perfectly.  I made a Sweet Lassi for a beverage to go along with it and it cut the heat of the meal fantastically.  I served it family style over brown rice and got positively rave reviews.  I can't wait to make this for friends.  It's an easy way to show off and make it seem as though you really know your way around a kitchen.

I love chicken tikka masala and I thought this recipe was way too salty.  If you follow the directions as stated, you'll end up with 7 teaspoons of salt in your recipe.  Needless to say, I followed the recipe to a T and it was way too salty.  I'd cut the salt down drastically.  Other than the extreme saltiness, the chicken turned out fine.  I tasted the chicken before I added it to the sauce and it was delicious!

Excellent recipe. I replaced heavy cream with coconut milk as a thickener and it tasted great - better than heavy cream as the thickener.

Good base recipe, but with changes based upon a few suggestions, it became as good or better than the one at the restaurants. My changes consisted of less salt, and the addition/substitution of garam masala. For the marinade my changes were to only use 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp cayenne for less spice, and only 1 tsp cumin because I also added 1 tsp garam masala which already contains cumin. I left the rest of the amounts the same for the marinade.   For the sauce my changes were to use only a mere 1/4 tsp salt, and again reduced the cumin to 1 tsp because I added 1-1/2 tsp garam masala. Also, I used 1/2 cup heavy cream, and 1/2 cup of half & half instead of 1 cup heavy cream. I left the other ingredients for the sauce the same. This became restaurant quality or better (depending on the restaurant, of course) it wasn't salty, and the spicyness was a notch over mild.

This was sooo good. I only used half the salt called for and it was still abit salty.  Ok to eat with basmati rice, but today I am making it again and will leave out the salt in the sauce and use Garam Masala seasoning.  I can't wait to try it with these changes! Since moving to Montana you can imagine good ethnic food is hard to come by. Allrecipes.com is a life saver!

Excellent dish!   For the marinade, I only used about 1/2 cup of yogurt because the excess gets thrown out and I didn't want to waste it, and it worked great!  I also omitted the cinnamon but added 1 tsp of garam masala I bought at the Bulk Barn, and left out the salt entirely.  As well, I just sauteed the chicken lightly in a pan without skewers and added it to the sauce.  Much easier and tasted great, but without the char-flavour that some people might miss. For the sauce, I added one minced onion and used about 3-4 cloves of garlic (I love the stuff).  I also added some yellow curry powder, extra tomato sauce and substituted the cream for light yogurt.  I simmered it with the yogurt in it for a little too long, and it separated (and looked weird), but it was DELICIOUS!  Next time, I added the yogurt until just before serving to heat it through and it was just as fabulous but didn't have the separated dairy look.  My husband LOVED it, and my brother (who is an extremely picky eater) actually requested some too!  I will definitely make it again.

I have made this recipe over 10 times.  I highly recommend marinating the chicken overnight, and I use 4 pieces of chicken breast instead of 3. I also, like many other reviewers, double the sauce recipe and cut the salt in half or omit it all together.   The most amazing Chicken Tikka Masala I've ever eaten.  It's a family favorite : )

(Without all the salt) This was WONDERFUL. I hate that it has all the cream in it, but it tasted heavenly. I am definitely making this again. It had just enough kick. We weren't able to use the grill, so I cooked the chicken (cut up) on a roasting pan, and then turned on the broiler for a couple of minutes. Perfect!

I made this for a big dinner of 10+ and it was an absolute success! nothing left! I made it according the recipe and it came out YUMMY!! The only thing I would suggest is to marinate the chicken overnight or as long as you can to get the flavors to life.

I have made this recipe numerous times and every time it has tasted delicious! When I cook it for friends and family they always rave about how tasty this dish is. It is an easy recipe to follow. I sometimes add an extra jalapeño and I cut the salt out completely. I sometimes add extra garlic too. This dish tastes as good as buying it from a restaurant. Definitely recommend it!

I'd give this five stars, but it seems to be a little too salty as written. For my taste, I'd reduce the salt a little. I also use fat free half and half and simmer on low and it thickens up pretty well, not to mention its a lot better than heavy cream. Your waistline will thank me. Oh and its pretty spicy as it is, so if you like it spicy, no need to add extra--plenty as it is!

The recipe says 4 and then again 3 teaspoons of salt - or to taste - go by the taste.  I used maybe 2 teaspoons all told and it was great.

When I made this recipe took the advice of other reviews and cut the cayenne and red pepper in half, otherwise it would have been WAY TOO SPICY.  I was disappointed because there was WAY TOO MUCH SALT and the whole family was guzzling down milk and water during dinner tonight. I HIGHLY recommend omitting the salt all together or add 1/3 of it. I did add boiled potatoes which was really nice.

Good recipe, but way way WAY too much salt. 5 teaspoons?! All other spices can be cut in half and the same flavor would be achieved.

This was delicious! My husband and I crave Indian food all the time and this recipe is a simple, quick, cheap alternative to dining out!   Like many others, I made a few alterations. I followed the recommendation to cut back on the salt (I only used a few dashes in each the marinade and the sauce). I also followed the advice to double the sauce (since I looove to dip my naan in the extra :) ) Plus, I invested in some Garam Masala which I found at a higher end grocery store. It was a little investment ($9 for a smaller jar) but well worth it and it should last a while!  My husband and I like it hot (really hot) so I added a small chopped up habanero to the sauce, as well as about an extra teaspoon or 2 of cayenne. I also threw in a green pepper and an onion (cut into chunks) with the hot peppers before adding the tomato sauce - delish! And, because I didn't feel like buying a whole bottle of tomato juice, I used a 15 oz can of pureed tomatoes. Just be sure to kick up the spices if need be (my sauce tasted a little tomato-ey before I added some). And, side note, fat free half and half works just great as a sub for the heavy cream (and is so much better for you!).

Great recipe! My Indian fiance said it tasted authentic. Following the advice of others, I omitted the salt from the gravy. I did leave it in the marinade. I also added garam masala to the marinade. What Indian wouldn't :)

WAY TOO SALTY!  I even used about 1/4 less of the salt it asks for and it was still way too salty.  It totally ruined what might have been an enjoyable meal.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of one is because I'm choosing to give this recipe the benefit of the doubt that it otherwise would have been good had it not been for the salt.  Next time I'm also going to add some ingredients that typically go in more authentic tikka masala recipes for an added boost of flavor:  ground almonds, cardamom, coriander, and garam masala.

This is my favorite dish at the Indian restaurant we go to. The first time I made it, I used all the salt recommended and I could barely eat it. I made it again without any salt and combined it with the first batch. It was perfect.

Excellent and easy recipe! The chicken was a bit too salty so next time I'll probably cut the recommended salt in half (I used the suggested 4 tsp). I'm also used to a bit more heat so I'll most likely double the cayenne pepper or leave the jalapeno seeds in. Otherwise it was great. Will definitely be making this again.

As per some reviews I omitted the salt. However, next time I think I will do half of what is called for instead as no salt made it a little bland. Also, I would half the jalapeño and cayenne. Be sure to mince the jalapeño super fine because a small chunk will kick your butt if you get a spicy one. I couldn't find heavy cream, but light cream seemed to be a good alternative. Next time I make this I'm gonna try to find a way to replace the dairy---since it's probably the least healthy ingredient. Oh, and I just bake the chicken and it turns out really tasty---saves the step of needing to skewer all the pieces.

SO good!!!! However, way too salty. Add way less salt to both the marinade and the sauce. I would also omit the cinnamon in the marinade. I added a little curry to the sauce and it was so good!!! This recipe will be used again and again.

This was SO good. I have a feeling my husband will be requesting this a lot, so although I'm usually all for the full-fat stuff, next time I will sub half and half for the cream to cut calories. My husband said, "I guess we dont have to go to [his favorite Indian restaurant] for this anymore." SCORE!

Absolutely fabulous! The salt for the sauce can be greatly reduced though, I would suggest to add 1/2 tsp at a time to taste.

This recipe is just amazing! After a string of culinary let downs, I logged on to the net to search for a recipe that would be my last attempt. I followed this recipe exactly as it is just substituted the cream with full cream milk. It turned out super. My husband said that it was better than Chicken Tikka Masala at this fav. restaurant. Thanks to this recipe, I am still cooking!

This was outstanding.   We liked it a lot.   DO NOT USE 4 tsp of Salt.  It will ruin the dish.   I used 1 tsp and it turned out great.

I tried this mostly without changes and I thought it tasted fantastic. I cut out most of the salt and added some garam masala to the sauce - I also added some cubed tomatoes and onions to the sauce. Overall it was tasty, however I wasn't a big fan of the cinnamon. Next time I will use some other spices in place of the cumin/cinnamon/cayenne spices (coriander powder, chili powder, fenugreek, ging-garlic paste..) & use fresh tomatoes which I think will just enhance the delicious flavor of this :) Thanks!

This recipe is AMAZING! I actually like making this for myself more than most restaurants I've been to.  After reading many of the review, I omitted all the salt, and just added some while cooking to taste. I also double the tomato sauce and cream because I love just the sauce over rice!  This recipe is great to adjust how spicy you want it - I love spice, so I add some cayenne to the sauce to make it more spicy...I also add some extra cumin and paprika to the sauce since I doubled it. Delicious, have made it many times since discovering it - a favorite of my boyfriends and several friends, I get asked to make it a lot! I make it with basamiti rice, and naan. YUM!

I was hopeful that this would be outstanding. It was good but has entirely too much salt. I used half of what the recipe called for and still found it to be so salty. I would suggest not adding any salt to the marinade for the chicken and only salting to taste when creating the sauce. Not as good as our local restaurant and more work than just ordering out. :)

This was the first time I made this dish and I was really impressed.  Reading the reviews I used about half the salt and it was still too salty, next time I know to use a lot less or none at all in the sauce.  As the sauce was cooking I was not sure the flavor was going to fit (it was more like an italian cream sauce) but once I added the chicken and celantro (the celantro is a must)  it all came together.  I added a little more cumin and some 5 spice to the sauce to give it a little more flavor.  I would suggest knowing the cayanne you use, the stuff I have is super hot and I only used half and it was still spicy and hot so beware, had I used what the recipe called for it would of been wrecked. The marinade for the kabobs was great by itself for cookouts too.  I do have to say once I re heated the left overs the flavors were dead on as they marinated over night (better vs. when it was first cooked)

No salt added would probably have made it better, but since I added the salt it called for I added sugar to counter it.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!!  My friendand I both LOVED it!  Chicken was very tender and the sauce was great.  I added 1/2 cup of very finely-chopped cashews in the marinade and it gave chicken a wonderful nutty flavour.  I will make this many more times.

This was the first time that I have made Indian food. It turned out quite well, but was a little too spicy for me. My husband loves Indian and spicy food, so he enjoyed it.  Next time, I will have to reduce the cayenne and double the sauce. I felt like there wasn't enough sauce  bc we ate it with naan and had to scrape for the sauce. I also didn't add any salt at all. Overall, a great and easy recipe.

Reduced the salt (per other reviews) to only 1 tsp.  Didn't use cilantro.  This dish was pretty amazing.  I had always felt daunted by the idea of cooking Tikka Masala, but so happy I have this recipe now!  Thanks!

Fabulous recipe!!!!  My favorite Indian restaurant scores a 10 on this and, even if I do say so myself, I scored a 9.5 with this recipe.  I was skeptical before trying it but gave it a shot based on so many positive reviews.  This is definitely a keeper.  I stayed 100% with the recipe as stated here but did reduce the salt as everyone suggested.

Very good recipe! I added a sm. can of peas, garam marsala and 3 cloves of garlic.  Also, I added cloves and coriander to the rice water for extra depth. Would rrecommend this recipe to anyone who loves the flavor, and heat, of Indian food!

This was my first time making any type of Indian food and it came out absolutely delicious! I followed some of the other suggestions and used garam masala in place of the cinnamon and cumin for the marniade.  I also elimnated the majority of the salt content.   I did not grill the chicken instead I simmered it in a sacuepan and cooked it  80% before combining it with the sauce.  I simmered that for another 10 minutes before serving. I also doubled the sauce because I like that on my rice.  Garam masala was also added in the sauce to give it that extra kick.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

This recipe was amazing!  Tasted just like my favorite Indian restaurant.  The only thing I did different was added 1/4 tsp of salt for the whole recipe and I placed the chicken pieces and marinade in the oven for about 25min.  When I took the chicken out I added all of the chicken and marinade to the tomato base I had cooking already.  I let this simmer for about 20 minutes and served over instant brown rice.  My family loved it.  Just the right spice and will be making many more times!

Very close to the taste of what I order at my favorite Indian Restaurant.  I nixed the cayene and the jalepeno b/c of my children and I axed most of the salt per reviewers.  I missed the heat, but I can add a bit more in next time, I'll leave it all in and the kids can eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Great recipe!

Very good, but not quite the chicken tikka masala that I am used to getting at a good Indian restaurant.  For instance, the chicken did not have the red color that one would expect from a tandoori.

Maybe I should have wiped off more of the yogurt marinade from the chicken before I cooked it, but it was WAY too salty. Almost inedible.  The red sauce was pretty good though.  If I had wiped off more of the marinade before I cooked it, than it might have been a lot better.  As is though, it was pretty disappointing.

This was pretty good and easy recipe to make, but it could use some adjustments.  I would make it again and adjust the spices/salt to our tastes.

this recipe is a WINNER!!!  my husband and i made 16 servings for our group of friends and it was a hit.  we pretty much followed the recipe to a T.  the only changes we made were cutting down of the cayenne pepper and salt.  we made this with the vegetable biryani from this site and the sauce went extremely well with the rice dish.  we will definitely be doing this one again!

this was an excellent masala. the hubs and i have been trying to find a decent curry recipe since trying it for the first time last year. this one suits both our tastes well (i prefer a masala and he a vindaloo). but be aware: as is, this recipe is hot. so if you want to tune it down a little, leave out the jalapeno or the cayenne. we also cut the salt down quite a bit.  also, we added zucchini and squash for a little texture. very good recipe! :)

I reduced the sauce according to other reviewers suggestions.  I cut the chicken in strips for marinating and grilling, skipping the skewers.  Then I broke it up in the pan just before serving.  My whole family enjoyed it from the 3 year old to us adults.  We will be making this again!!

This was a really great recipe! Everyone loved it! I didn't have the individual spices available so I marinated the chicken in 1 tbsp of garam masala (I found it at walmart in paste form in the indian food area) and then made the sauce with 2 tbsp of garam masala. I also had a little cardamom so I added 1/2 tsp to it because it felt like it was missing that warmth factor.   SO YUMMY! Greek yogurt is very good as it's thick and sticks to the chicken. Marinate it overnight! It's so tender and juicy! I could have made a meal with just the chicken itself. This recipe is very comparable to anything you'd find at a good indian restaurant.

This was delish! I used fat free half/half, fat free yogurt and chicken thighs because that is what I had on hand. I also omitted the lemon juice since I had none in the house, and left out most of the salt, it was not needed, it was still out of this world. I also do not have a grill so I just baked my chicken in the oven at 350 until done which worked out by the time my sauce started to thicken the chicken was done so I threw it in. For me the heat level was perfect.

This was my first attempt at cooking Indian food.  This has now become one of my favorite dishes.  Definately reduce the salt, though.  I don't generally like very spicy food, but if you put it over basmati rice and serve with naan, it's just right.

Yum!  Like others suggested, I left out the salt.  I also left out the jalapeno, as my husband isn't a big fan of them.  This was terrific, we'll definitely be making it again!

Excellent recipe.  I bet it would be good with a little more spice too.  I cut back a little on the cayenne pepper at first.  I also did not add much salt as I don't like homemade food salty and this recipe doesn't need it anyway.

I do not give a lot of five stars, but this was awesome. The colors and aroma are dead giveaways to how delicious this recipe is. I would say it is restaurant quality. I added salt to the marinade as listed, but I did not add the three tsp of salt to the sauce. I did about three shakes. I added half the pepper and carved out the jalapeno pepper seeds. I would say it was just right.

**** This recipe was good, but had WAY too much salt!  I used only 2 tsp. of salt in the marinade and just a sprinkle in the sauce -- it was fine.  I also cut back on the amount of cayenne pepper because my husband doesn't like anything too hot (I used 1-1/4 tsp. of cayenne).  It was delicious!  If not for the tremendous amount of salt, I would've given it 5 stars!

Awesome Recipe (with minor alterations)  The original recipe calls for too much salt. My boyfriend and I added three tablespoons of salt to the chicken marinade and added no salt to the sauce.  Also the recipe is very spicy so if you would like a more mild flavor add a less hot pepper, and or add less red cayenne pepper.    After these minor alterations we enjoyed the Chicken Tikka Masala VERY much and would make it again in the near future!!!

This is a really good base recipe for Chicken Tikka Masala.  I did feel it was lacking something...some depth.  I did modify the ingredients to satisfy my taste by adding extra ginger, cilantro and saracha chili sauce.  The marinade for the chicken is spot on - delicious.  The sauce is also very good, but needs a little something....  still overall, a great and easy recipe for this delicious dish.

I thought this was fabulous. I made a milder version because my girlfriend doesn't like spicy food, though. We both loved it! The yogurt mixture that you put the chicken in tastes fabulous itself and would make a fantastic dip.

Almost perfect!! This is terrific, my only suggestion is reduce the salt.  I used only 2 teaspoons in the sauce but used the 2 in the marinade.  It was still way too salty for me.  It overwhlemed the dish and did not allow the other spices to star in the dish which is how I think it should be for inidan dishes.  I think the recipe should read a lesser amount, say 1 in marinade and 1 in sauce and the add more  to taste.  I wish there were 1/2 stars to give then I wouldn't have deliberated over how many to choose.  In the end I gave it a 5 star rating.  Fairly easy to make too!  I served it over basmati rice, my husband had been craving Tikka Masala and loved this.

awesome! i marinated in the sauce for about 4 hrs. we don't have a grill so i just sauteed the chick in a pan until done. with the other sauce, i sautéed garlic, chopped jalapenos and onions with plain tomato sauce. i only had a little heavy cream so i used mostly 1% organic low fat milk and it still came out yummy:) served over mahatma long grain- and per other reviewers, used about 1 tsp of salt any more than that would be way too much

One of the best recipes for chicken masala, however it asks for way to much salt. So next time I will reduce the amount i use.

My changes...    1) add only 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the marinade and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the sauce. This was for 6 chicken breasts  2) I used half and half instead of heavy cream.  3) I left out the jalapeno pepper. It was nicely spicy after without being unbearable    Overall this was a fantastic recipe! It tasted so delicious and authentic

Flavor excellent.  But WAY too spicy for me.  Tame the cayenne and the salt.

The base recipe is *fantastic*, minus the SALT. good gracious, are the salt listings a typo! i've made this about 5 or so times by now, with the following substitutes  skip the salt in the first section altogether, use half the salt (or to taste, but usu less) in the second section. i also quarter or half the cayenne in the first for a 1-star experience. ill also add *brown sugar* (about 1/8 to 1/4 cup, to taste) to the mix cooking on the stove. trust me...it's the *business*.  i'd love to give it a 4, but until the salt issue is fixed--honestly, using as much salt as specified in the recipe will have you gagging.

Fantastic!!  We cut way down on the salt and I substituted fat free half and half for the cream.  I was also running a little low on cumin, so some curry powder had to stand in for part of it. A spicy, easy, delicious dish!

This was absolutely fabulous-I've NEVER heard of this dish before but I went out on a limb and decided to make it.  I was very involved and took hours, but it was well worth the effort.  This will definitely be made again soon!!

I can't believe how good this dish came out.  It is beautiful and tastes as good as it looks!  I subsituted lamb for chicken and served it with homemade garlic naan.  Amazing! Firstly, the salt amounts are definitely off.  I just added salt to taste.  I also doubled (or more) the amounts of spices called for, used garam masala instead of the cinnamon, and used high quality fresh ginger.  I recommend trying to find a spanish (hot) paprika if you can - it adds even more kick and the color is a deep red. I also used some tomato paste in addition to the sauce.  And if you have indian markets nearby, try using traditional ghee in place of the butter! mmmmm!

This dish has great potential, but it calls for way too much salt.  It was so salty we were unable to eat it with enjoyment and did not finish our meal.  I will try making it again with at least half as much salt added.

This is more of a 4.5 stars.  This was very good and very close to the ones we've had at restaurants.  We've made it twice now and both times it's turned out great.  I did some substitutions and per other reviews used Garam Marsala instead of some of the individual spices.  We eliminated all salt and reduced the spiciness so our toddler could enjoy it too.  We will definitely make this again!

Had this dish at a dinner party last night.  It was better than any Tikka Masala I've ever had in an Indian restaurant!  My friend cut all the spices in half and it tasted perfect to me.  In fact, I have mine marinating in the fridge right now!

This was absolutely amazing!! Way to impress my boyfriend!  I am brand new at cooking, and I found this recipe to be simple and SO flavorful.  I followed what others said, I did omit the salt all together, and I doubled the sauce recipe.  I added cinnamon and coconut milk to the sauce to make it richer.  Delish. Can't wait to make this again.

Too much Salt!  Only add to taste!  It was too cold to BBQ the meat so I just pan fried the breasts, removed them, & made the sauce in the pan.  Worked great!  Will definately add this to my list of Super Spicy Foods!!

I'm allergic to half the major ingredients, but not the spices, so substituted the living daylights out of this recipe and it was FANTASTIC!  A testimony to how good this recipe is in that as long as you keep the backbone of the flavors it still translates.  Anyway, here is a list of my following allergies and what I substituted to give you confidence if you're worried like I was about trying it: chicken -- marinated tempeh.  though I just saw the paneer recipe on this site that looks so simple, I am going to try that instead of meat next time cinnamin -- nutmeg tomatoes -- shredded butternut squash (next time I'm going to leave a few chunks though, as it happened on accident when I first cooked it and I liked it) dairy - I'm not allergic, but it doesn't do me so well, so I substituted coconut milk and kept the yogurt, though I think just the coconut would have been good too.  I also put raw cashews in my coffee grinder/food processor, about a cup, and added this in for extra "fatty goodness/richness" for the replaced dairy I also agree with the other reviews.  I only used one tsp or so instead of the three, and it was almost too much for me, which is saying a lot because I am a salt wh0re.  Agree as well as to doubling the sauce, as it was so good and does soak up easy (it's what you are going for, not the rice, so go for it, esp if you're substituting the dairy as coconut milk is very good for your health).   Thanks!!!!!!!

Found an (almost) identical recipe on another site. Have been making it for a few years, without changing a thing in the recipe. It's simply fantastic. Better than what you get in a restaurant. It's got the ideal balance of tomato and cream.  Don't know about the amount of salt though. The other recipe didn't have it. Not sure what the author was thinking...

Loved this! Followed the recipe pretty closely (sometimes I don't measure perfectly), used half the black pepper, half the jalapeno, and cut down the salt and then used kosher salt instead of table salt. Put a dollop of plain yogurt on each plate to cut the spice -- that was well-received. Made extra chicken and doubled the sauce recipe: two adults, a teenager and an 11-year-old polished off every morsel! Kids both requested that we have this again. Definitely a keeper!

Enjoyed this dish and think I would have liked it more had I gone with the full pepper amounts and used the jalapeno. But with two kids, sometimes you gotta sacrifice. Also, cut the chicken into chunks and broiled them. Might try skewering them and broiling them next time and look forward to grilling them outdoors this summer.

Way way to much salt!!  I cut the salt back and it was still to much, and I love salt. The dish is very flavorful. It is pretty spicy but it's a nice spicy. Just whatever you do, cut the salt!

This was truly wonderful as evidenced by the fact that all four of my children loved it!  Only thing to beware of is that the serving sizes are a small volume but very rich.  We love this one.

When dining out for Indian, I always order this dish.  Imagine my surprise when I recreated this entree at home and it was every bit as good as my favorite restaurant!  I followed the ingredients and cooking methods exactly, but halfed the amount of salt and cayenne per other reviews.  This will be a frequent meal in our home from now on.  It was absolutely DEVINE!

Excellent Recipe.  The sauce and marinade both came out excellent, as good as any restaurant Masala I've had.  Used only 1 tsp of salt.

Would you like a little food with your salt?!  That being said, I only used 1 tsp of salt in the marinade and 1 tsp in the sauce and it was perfect.  I also couldn't bring myself to use a whole cup of cream, so I used 1/2 cup of cream and 1/2 cup of milk.  Very very good, and just like what you'd get at an Indian restaurant!

Thought this would be too spicy for my kids so I put in less cumin and cayenne pepper. We served it with naan bread and it was a big hit!!

Oh my goodness. This was sooooooooo delicious and not terribly difficult. The Indian restaurant I used to work at called this dish Chicken Makhini and it was my absolute favorite, I thought I was going to have to tweak this recipe to get makhini, but fortunately it was already perfect.  As for the actual recipe, I used only a sprinkling of cayenne and salt in the marinade and another sprinkling of salt in the sauce. I didn't skewer the chicken, or grill it, instead I put it all in the broiler and it turned out beautifully-I think I'll try chicken cooked only in the marinade another time. A million thanks for the fabulous recipe.

The amount of salt in the recipe is fenomenal,  I decided to give it a second chance and i put less cumin and not salt at all. and it is OK. I  am still looking for the perfect Chicken Tikka Masala recipe just like my favorite take away food in England. I have not found the first indian restaurant in the US that makes a good one.

This was time consuming, but well worth it.  It was fabulous and as others suggested, I cut the salt in half (or MORE!) and doubled the sauce you simmer the chicken in.  If you like spicy Indian food, you're in for a treat!

This was a lot better than I thought it would be!  I did take the advice of others, and ommitted the salt.  I only used half of the cayanne, as I don't like things too spicy.  I doubled the sauce too.  And, I served it all over jasmine rice.

I made this for my husband because he loves tikka masala, and always gets it when we go eat Indian. I ommited the salt from everywhere except the marinade for the chicken and everything turned out delicious! My husband is begging me to make it again :)

Yummy, spicy recipe! All I have to say is, for people that have cooked before, you guys should know that 4 teaspoons of salt in the marinade and 3 teaspoons of salt in the sauce mixture is WAY TOO MUCH SALT..and there is also lime juice in the marinade..!! Clearly that is a mistake. I would add about 1.5 teaspoon of salt for the standard four servings because you have to account for the lemon juice as well.  Also, I followed the spice level exactly...and it was deliciously spicy!!! :) If you do not like your food very spicy, please just add 1/4 the amount..and it will be plenty spicy! :)

This was indeed excellent.  I loved loved loved this dish. I always make recipes as the cooks write them as it upsets me when I see massive substitutions, but since I cannot have yougurt I did sub with sour cream. And this is out of this world.  The grilled chicken before it went in the sauce was phenomenal and could be a dish by itself!  If you have a taste for indian food, you will like this.  Although it was not a favorite for my husband.

This is stuff is amazing!  I have made it 4 times now and the only changes I made after following the recipe exactly the first time were to cut down the salt by HALF in both places where salt is used (the first time, it was nearly inedible because of the salt), and also I use half the amount of cayenne and half to three fourths of the jalapeno (seeded) and it makes the heat medium instead of on fire!

I try several new recipes from this site each week.  This is a keeper.  I marinated the chicken overnight the first time I made it and it was fantastic.  It may be a little salty for most people as written, but that is probably what my husband liked so much about it.

I thought this recipe was excellent.  I saw another reviewer mentioned too much salt.  I didn't follow the directions w.r.t. the salt.  I didn't use any salt in the marinade. In the sauce, I used no-salt tomato sauce and only 1 teaspoon of light salt.  Excellent flavor and very easy.  Another thing I did to simplify was I put all the chicken pieces in a grill pan rather than skewering everything.

I've prepared this dish several times and each time we have absolutely loved it!  I've not located the micned fresh ginger yet, so each time I've used ground ginger, and it tastes just fine.  The first time I prepared this dish I prepared it exactly as the ingredients and recipe reads and we found it to be a little spicy so I now cut the Cayenne and Jalapeno down a bit...maybe not in half, just a little less, as the spiciness is really a part of the experience.  It's still yummy!  I will be making this over and over again.  We think it tastes as good, or better than Indian restaraunts we have been to. The sauce is is amazing....I may even start doubling it. Enjoy! ;)

I really enjoyed this dish! I did follow some suggestions and cut down the salt. I didn't want it to be too spicy so I also cut down the cayenne pepper and ground black pepper down to 1 teaspoon each (as some suggested). Next time I'm going to use the 2 teaspoons of each as stated in the recipe because I actually missed the extra heat.  Great dish, thanks!

This is a good recipe.  Calls for too much salt however.  You can cut it by about half (for both the marinating and gravy part), and you'll get something brilliant.  I also added turmeric (about 1 tsp) for the chicken marinating part, which added a really great color, as well as flavor.

Way too much salt in this recipe.  I used a 1/2 teaspoon and that was plenty.  If you don't have grill handy, you can broil the chicken after the marinade...works great!!

Holy cow this was delicious!!  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing!  I can see how some people said it was too salty but for me it was just fine once paired with rice and naan bread.  SO GOOD!  **Note: I tried this dish with extra firm tofu last night and grilled on a foreman grill before adding the tofu to the sauce and it was phenomenal!  My vegetarian friend just loved it!

This recipe would be much better without the tablespoon of salt in the sauce!  Should have read the reviews saying to hold the salt, but thought the recipe would be better with 4.5 stars.  Will try again with less salt.  Liked the chicken off the grill.

Absolutely awesome flavor! Here are the changes I made: use only 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp of cayenne pepper in the marinade. I was plenty salty and spicy when you cut back - more would just be overbearing! I left the chicken in the marinade for about 7 hours. I broiled the chicken - about 7 minutes, turn over half way though the time. I used only 1 tsp of salt in the sauce and used 2 cloves of garlic. Serve with grilled or broiled zucchini over brown rice. Some mango-ginger chutney and naan would be fabulous with this as well.

The spices in this recipe look wrong... it's missing garam masala, turmeric, tomato paste, curry leaves. Gordon Ramsay's Chicken Tikka Masala recipe seems more authentic...

The sauce was too spicy/salty and it tasted more like really salty chili than tiki masala. I'll have to try the recipe again with 1/2 the amount of spices in the tomato sauce and add the salt afterwords. Also, my local Indian restaurant puts chunks of tomatoes and onions in the sauce as well.

Absolutely delicious!!! My husband kept asking" Isn't this just like the restaurant version??"  I took other's suggestions and doubled the sauce, and reduced the amount of salt.  We added peas to our leftovers for some vegetables, but otherwise fantastic flavor!

This was amazing! I love to experiment with Indian cooking and I have to say this was an easy recipe and it tasted better then most Indian places I go. The only suggestion that I have is to omit the salt and if you are not a spicy person cut the cayanne by half. Enjoy!

I've been referring to this recipe's spices for make-shift masala. I'll take a tomato sauce (I've used Italian pasta sauce, or  tomato soup) and add spices from this recipe until it tastes Indian and yummy. I start with the cumin, cinnamon and yogurt, and sometimes end there.  Delish.

I just made this dish as today's dinner. I reduced the salt and will have to add some more spices to make it more spicier next time. My boyfriend came into the kitchen asking if he could eat it just as it was at that point, without rice or anything else on the side. He just loved the smell that was filling the air. Will definitely make this again!

Good flavor but WAY TOO much salt!! 7 tsp between the marinade and sauce is ridiculous. My husband and I like salt, however we had to drown the chicken in lemon juice, just to choke it down. I will attempt this recipe again, however, I will use 1 tsp for the marinade and 1/2 tsp for the sauce. Should be good, but made with the 7 tsp of salt, it tastes like a salt lick.

Really liked this.  It is close to what I get in the restaurant,but not exact.  However, here are the changes I made:  One teaspoon salt in the marinade.  1/4 tsp salt in the sauce.  I used one tsp garam masala and one of cumin in the sauce.  Also, I used 2 8 oz cans of tomato sauce, this made the sauce nice and red and we had plenty for 1.5 lbs of chicken.  Also, I halved the cayenne in the marinade, and used much less in the sauce instead of jalepeno.  It was still too spicy for the kids, but good for my husband and I.  I will use less cayenne next time.  Served over jasmine rice.  Would be great with the naan recipe on this site!

The only reason I can't give this recipe five stars is because I made some changes.  Firstly, I used a teaspoon of salt in the marinade and another teaspoon in the sauce.  I didn't have a jalapeno pepper (unfortunately) so I used a teaspoon of cayenne pepper in the sauce.  I also used light coconut milk instead of heavy cream, and added a teaspoon of garam masala to the sauce.  I also don't have a grill, so the chicken was baked in the oven. And oh boy - this recipe was extremely flavourful!!  And spicy!!!  De-lish!

Cut about a third of the salt out the first time i made it and it was still very very salty.  Next time I think I will cut it down to 1tsp total.  Looks and smells just like the real thing so minus the salt should be awesome.

This was superb chicken!  Like the others, I used less salt and more tomato sauce, and my family and I all went back for more.  It almost didn't seem as spicy as you would get at a restaurant, so I sprinkled some red pepper on top of mine and it was excellent.

The marinade was quite spicy, so I agree, you can reduce the use of cayenne pepper. I suggest using half the suggested salt for the cream/tomato sauce.

This recipe was a hit!!!  I had company yesterday and served this because I knew it was a family favorite for them.  It is also one of my favorite dishes, so it was a good excuse to make it.  I was a bit worried that the dish wouldn't live up to expectations, but everyone loved it... I did make a few modifications as suggested in some of the other posts.  I reduced the amount of cayenne to about 1/4 of what the recipe called for, and used a small jalapeño.  I didn't want too much heat because I was serving children.  I thought it was perfect.  Just enough heat to make it interesting but not enough to bother anyone.  The only thing I think I will do differently next time is reduce the salt by just a bit.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this last night, but instead of using chicken I used paneer cheese.  I didn`t use yogurt in the marinade I just drizzled some vegetable oil to allow the spices to coat the cheese. For the sauce I used 1 400g tin of chopped tomatoes in juice and approx 1/4 cup tomato paste, then added approx 1/4 cup water to loosed=n the mixture, I simmered until I got the consistency wanted.  I listened to the other reviews and added salt to taste, and halved the Cayenne.  Also added a little sugar as I had just used unseasoned tomatoes and tomato paste. Another variation that worked well with the paneer cheese was adding a cup of frozen peas for the last 10 min of cooking.  Will definitely make again, husband polished off most of the curry by himself, so much for leftovers today for dinner!

The best!!!!! Better than going to a restaurant! I did follow the reviews, and cut the salt to about a teaspoon. If you do not like spicy, reduce the cayenne pepper and cut out the jalapeno. Had this with Trader Joes Garlic Naan.....I'm gonna have me a good lunch tomorrow!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  It is so easy and so delicious.  I don't change a thing about it because it is so good just the way it is.  I also think that the oven broiler method is still really good.  It doesn't give the same smokey flavor as the grill, but it is still delicious.

After going to a local Indian Restaurant I instantly fell in love with Tikka Masala.  After reading a few reviews on this dish i decided not to add ANY salt and use half a jalapeno pepper instead of a whole one.   The result was excellent.  The dish has just enough kick for me and my g/f without masking the other flavors.   Grilling the chicken on a charcoal grill made the marinade stand out when the chicken was mixed with the tomato cream sauce.  I enjoyed this with a whole wheat pita that I brushed with olive oil and browned in a frying pan and some rice.      The second time I made this dish (later that week) I was less anal about preparation.  I cooked the chicken and the marinade in a wok.  When the chicken was cooked I put the wok under low heat and reduced the marinade almost to a paste to save for later.  When I served the dish I put a tablespoon of this marinade paste on the side of the dish and also a tablespoon of low fat sour cream.  When putting rice on the pita and mixing all the sauces per bite, the sensation of creamy, sweet, spicy, tangy made for a blissful bite.  TRY IT OUT!!!

This was delicious. It seemed a bit spicier (and less sweet) than the tikka masalas I've had in restaurants, but that wasn't a bad thing. I halved the salt, and that worked out well. Next time I make this, I will make a 1 1/2 recipe of the sauce . . . it's always nice to have a bit extra to pour over your rice. UPDATE: I just made this for a dinner party, and it got rave reviews. I doubled the sauce, and ended up with the perfect chicken-sauce ratio.

So good! I also used fat free 1/2 & 1/2, and the only yogurt I had was vanilla but it was perfect, you couldn't taste the vanilla; marinated ckn. overnight. Added julienned green pepper & onion while sauteeing. Added a can of rinsed/drained chickpeas & subbed garam masala for most of the cumin.

As another had said, wish I would have read the reviews first.  It's hard to tell what it actually tasted like due to the overwhelming taste of salt.  It seemed it might be good.

Absolutely love this recipe! Just as everyone else has said, omit the salt. I like to eat this with Naan Bread, Rice, and either mangos or Mango Lasssi. Enjoy!

Oops, should have read the comments before I made this.  The flavor would have been good, but it was too salty.  I put half the salt in the red sauce because it seemed like so much and still way too salty.  I've now rinsed the chicken and we'll try to eat the rest tomorrow with lots of rice and a yogurt sauce.

VERY VERY TASTY!! I did cut down the salt to about half as well as the celantro in the end. I do usually kick stuff up a notch with heat but I would say it's a medium/hot on the spicy end with alot of flavor.

*I always marniate lamb shoulder cubes along with the chicken breast for an authentic touch. *I prefer to skip simmering the meat to keep it's crispy grilled texture, then I pour the sauce over it right before serving.  *I also double up on the sauce recipe because we like to dip our Naan in it.

This dish is fantastic BUT, I would NOT follow the salt measurement. When I make this again, I will only put like a teaspoon in the marinade & not put any in the sauce. You can always add more later! I made it how it was specified and it was really hard to eat b/c it was so salty. Other than that, the flavor was wonderful! Enjoy!!

I just moved to a small town without an Indian restaurant and I was craving my favorite Indian dish and this totally hit the spot!  I followed other reviewers' advice and omitted the salt (except for a few dashes added to the sauce, less than 1/8t).  It was GREAT!    I'm glad I omitted almost all of the salt, because the dish was plenty salty from the other ingredients.  I'm also not crazy about spicy food, so I only used half of the jalepeno and no seeds, based on a reviewr's recommendation.  I think next time I will use the whole pepper, but still omit the seeds, because the dish wasn't spicy at all--but I like it that way! :)  I served it with jasmine rice, and added a can of Le Seur peas to the rice.  I also wanted to serve it with Indian cheese, but our market doesn't have any.  I used fresh mozzarella instead and seasoned it with the cilantro and a few dashes of salt.  It was a great substitute for Indian cheese!

This was delicious but next time I will add more spice to kick it up a bit.  Will also take the advice of others and double the sauce to make sure there is enough to go on the rice, but very good.

I have made this several times now and thought I really should review it...this is soooo good. My husband and 7 year old son just ate this and the Indian Chapati Bread from this website and told me it is their favorite thing that I make and, I cook a lot! My son likes to wrap it up in the bread like a "taco"...Is is a bit of work but totally worth it!

I've made this twice now and we can't get enough of it!  The 1st time I made it I followed the suggestions of others on the salt/spices and used Greek yogurt in place of the cream.  It was really good!  This time, however, I decided to use the heavy cream and ~OH MY~ it is heaven on Earth.  Do yourself a favor and make the full-fat version at least once.  You will not regret it.  We like spicy food but I did cut the amount of the peppers by half so my 4 yr. old could eat it.  She LOVES it!  I saute or grill a combo of chunky-cut green peppers, onions, potatoes and tomatoes to serve on the side.  This time my hubby wasn't around so I had to broil the chicken (I can't BBQ!).  I put about 3 lbs. of legs & thighs, skin on with bones, on a broiling pan.  I baked them 1st at 400 degrees for 35 min. then turned the broiler on HI and broiled each side until really brown and crispy.  The rack was set at the middle position about 10" from broiler.  Amazing!  The chicken was so wonderful that I served the sauce (which I doubled) on the side but will put the chicken and veggies in with the sauce from now on.  Could drink the sauce from a cup!  My daughter wanted to dunk everything in the sauce!  Thanks for the recipe!

This has become my favorite dish. A couple of changes - completly omit all salt from receipe. I marinade first thing in the morning to let the chicken get really soaked. Have both grilled and done on stove top due to a large storm and both ways are excellent. Also double the sauce receipe and serve with Naan. The extra sauce with the Naan bread may be my favorite part!

Im sorry I had to give it 3stars,but it wasn't how I imagined it would be. Unfortunatly it wasn't worth all the work you put into it. I love indian food and here,we  have many indian restaraunts. But this recipe was missing something and I couldn't quite get what it was. It might have been something I did. However my husband was really pleased with it.

Great!  Use 1/2 teaspoon salt for chicken only, and add 1 tsp garlic powder to chicken marinade.  Use half and half instead of heavy cream.

I probably broke all the rules making this dish but it turned out really good.  I served it for dinner Sunday and everyone loved it.  I used whole pieces of chicken (thighs, legs, brests), par-boiled them, put them on the grill to crisp up and just served the sauce at the table for dipping.  I will add an additional jalapeno next time.  Here in Buffalo we like our chicken spicy!

We love Indian food, and this is one of the dishes we go to the buffet for.  We followed others advice and omitted the salt (I can't imagine what it would taste like w/ all that salt.)  It tastes just like the restaurants!!  I always double the sauce for dipping.  I almost wish that it wasn't as good as it is b/c now that I know how much cream is in it, I don't want to make it.  This recipe is delicous!! We did not find it spicy at all- I think it depends on what you're used to and how Americanized your local Indian restaurant makes it.  We have had MUCH spicier versions than this one.

I made it for my kids because they love the tikka masala from our local grocer, Wholesome Choice.  I guess i should've modified the salt and the cayenne.  It was way too spicy, salty, and flat.

My husband and I both love Tikka Masala.  We enjoyed this recipe.  Like many others, I reduced the amount of salt.  I also made the recipe twice, once with jalapeno pepper and once without.  I know Indian food is supposed to be spicy but we felt that the cayenne pepper was enough spice.

This turned out really good but thankfully I read the reviews before hand.  Way too much salt.  I reduced it considerably, 1/2 tsp in marinade and 1/2 tsp in sauce and that was plenty for us.

I would actually rate this a 4 1/2 but that is not an option.  I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and added very little salt because if you add the amount suggested in the recipe, it would be way too salty, not to mention the sodium intake.  I served it with Jasmine rice and Naan.  It was almost as good as my favorite Indian Restauraunt, almost.

This chicken was very good. I didn`t use so much salt, I added just "to taste". The only thing I would change the next time I add a little water with the grilled chicken to the tomato sauce.

This was pretty good.  I made it with the following adjustments: I was very sparing with the salt, swapped the cumin in the sauce for garam masala, and did half the amount of cayenne and jalapeno pepper.  It worked out well except for that last one, because while it had a nice flavor it had no real kick.  Next time I'll do the full amount of pepper and see how that turns out.

GRAND SLAM!!!  This recipe really impressed my in-laws and they fought over the leftovers!  In addition to the changes others made, (elimination of salt and halving of cayenne) I doubled the tomato sauce, cream and the spices that went in the sauce because you will need extra to pour over the rice.  I also used light cream to save on the fat and it was still delicious!  Next time I will try Evaporated milk or whole to cut down even further.  I also brined the chicken beforehand to make it extra tender and used a grill topper to eliminate the time consuming skewering process.  I'm a cilantro fan so added a Cup of chopped cilantro to the sauce and let it simmer before adding the chicken.  DELISH!!!!  This one is definitely a go to recipe even if you don't normally like Indian food.  Thank you thank you Yakuta!!!

Oh. My. Gosh. This was delicious! As per other reviewers I all but omitted the salt from the recipe. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I served it with jasmine rice and it was a huge hit! I wasn't sure if it would turn out right, because my last attempt at Indian food was atrocious, but it turned out wonderfully. I'm going to take this recipe home to show off to my mom!

This is an awesome recipe! It has the perfect blend of spices. The only thing I would change the next time I make this is to cut down the salt to 2 tsp. in the marinade. As a side I made the Indian style rice with cashews, raisins (also on this site) and it was a perfect meal.

This recipe is fantastic! The first time I made this I followed directions exactly.  The second time, the only changes I made were to save time and fat: instead of marinating for so long, I simply cooked the chicken with all of the spices on the stove-top and, once cooked, put the chicken into the oven to let the curry thicken up a bit; I also used a combination of cream and yogurt (yogurt alone may have made it too watery, cream alone is too fattening!).  This recipe tastes great with the Naan on this site (I rated it as well, so it can be found through my profile), and some yogurt (raita) made with: diced tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers, mint or cilantro and some salt/pepper.  Thanks for a great recipe, Yakuta!

Delicious!  For a healthier alternative I substituted yogurt for the heavy cream and it turned out great.  I would cut back on the salt next time, but it is definitely a keeper.

I live in a small city that doesn't have many ethnic restaurants. I haven't had this dish in years so I have been missing it alot. I omitted most of the salt in the sauce and it was seasoned just right. This was very tasty and just as I remember it. Thanks so much for sharing this delicious recipe. It's definitely a keeper!

Really very good, even for an awful cook like me.  First, I had an cinnamon accident and dumped way too much in marinading the meat, then I burned the garlic, pepper, and spices with the butter.  But even with the two mishaps, the dish was still delicious.  My husband is very picky, and even he really liked it. I took everyone's advise and skipped the salt.  DON'T NEED SALT.  Also, I didn't need all the chicken.  Since we like it with a lot of sauce like in our favorite Indian restaurant, there was 1/4 of the chicken left.  Guess I'll wash off the spices and give it to our doggies!

One of the best things I've ever tasted.  Omitted the salt from the marinade and reduced the black pepper to one teaspoon.  For the sauce I used only a dash of salt.  Served over whole wheat couscous with whole wheat pita bread.  The sauce tasted ever better the next day.

This was absolutely delicious!  I made it for my boyfriend's family and it was a hit.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because, like others said, I can't imagine using the amount of salt the recipe calls for.  I used a teaspoon or two and that was perfect.  I also used half and half and fat free yogurt.  I forgot to add the lemon and cilantro and I can't imagine it being any better.  We didn't think it was too spicy at all, but we all love spice.  Served with salad, basmati rice, and naan.

I love this recipe! I have a favorite rest. in NYC and it really taste the same;)   I made a few changes for the people who love the HEAT.  I added a thai chili instead of jap and 1 to 2 Tsp of indian curry paste (depending how hot you like it)  I also added a bit of sour cream to give it a tang and reduced the cream and salt.  If it tends to be too spicy you can always add cream cheese to take the heat away. (a trick I learned with Thai cooking)

AWESOME! We don't have any good Indian restaurants near us so this recipe is a keeper. After making it several times this is what I do: I don't add ANY salt to the marinade. I only add 1 teaspoon of salt to the sauce. I also marinade the chicken as long as I can. Just about everyone I have made it for has asked for the recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe, it was very close to what you get at the Indian restaurants.  After reading the other comments, I did cut back on the cinnamon and added a little garam masala and I also cut way back on the salt.  A little salt for the chicken but none added to the sauce and it was just fine.  I will make this again.

Holy Moly!  If you decide to forgo the grill and cook the chicken inside, where a face mask!  As soon as the chicken hit the pan, my husband (from 20 feet away) said his eyes were burning.  Sure enough, about a minute in my lip started to burn, then my nose, and every thing between.  By a couple minutes in, I couldn't even cook anymore.  My sinuses were on FIRE!  All the seasoning was destroying me.  I was holding an ice cube to my nose for two hours after cooking this.  BEWARE!  As for the actual food, I followed suggestions about using barely any salt and substituting garam masala for cinnamon, and I made a double batch of sauce and used 2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp pap, and 2 tsp garam masala (in the sauce part).  I learned something:  I hate garam masala.  This doesn't make sense to me because I love Tikka Masala from restaurants, but this version just tasted like straight cumin and garam masala, and my garam masala had a clove flavor and I hate clove.    All together, I thought the recipe had too much seasoning in general (and I used four large chicken breasts, and x1.5 the marinade so it wasn't even very concentrated), and it physically hurt to cook the stuff!  However, my husband liked it (he wanted it to be hotter, however; he likes very hot food), so I will give it 2 stars for his sake.  If I ever make it again, I'll grill the chicken outside as stated, and I'll leave the garam masala out of the sauce, and probably cut down on the cumin ... and keep the tissues handy.

This was very tasty thankyou! It tasted even better for lunch the next day! I like others added salt to taste rather than measuring it. I would advise making it the day before for best results. This was my first recipe I've tried from here and it definatley got the thumbs up from us :o)

Like others we reduced the amount of salt.  This was the best I have ever had, restaurants included.

This recipe was excellent.  I made a few adjustments noted by other users.  I doubled the sauce, I omitted the salt and used fat free buttermilk instead of heavy cream.  I served it over cocunut rice and it was fantastic!! Thanks for the helpful hints and recipe!

i would give this recipe 50 stars if i could!   It was amazing.  my husband a chicken curry fan and said this is way better!   i only added i tea for the merinade and 1 tea for the sauce. next time i will skip the salt all together (and thats huge cuz we are a salt crazed family )  i cant imagine how awful it would be with all that salt.  this recipe is sooooooooo wonderful. thanks for sharing>

I loved this, it was great. I have made it several times experimenting each time. I used sour cream instead of yogurt and coconut milk as well instead of cream. I also reduced the amount of salt. It still tasted great!

This dish is soooooo good. It's one of our favorites!!!! It's just perfect. BUT, way too much salt!!!! Thank God I read the other reviews before I made it, only put 1/2 teaspoon in the marinade and 1/2 teaspoon in the dish and it will be plenty. If it wasn't for the salt, I would have given it 4 stars!

Wonderful dish! Very easy to prepare and very tasty. I only used the salt in the chicken and only used that in the sauce. I was also feeding my 1 year old so I omitted the cayenne pepper and the Jalapeno added enough zing to the dish without the hotness.

This was very good, but it still needs something to match the restaurants.  I only used 1 tsp of salt in the marinade but left all the other ingredients as posted.  My husband loved it, there were no leftovers.  I though the cinamon was overpowering, I will use less next time.  I may use a big can of tomato sauce next time too.

My boyfriend loves Indian food and he thought this dish was "awesome".  Easy to make and tasted like something we would get at our favorite Indian restaurant.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I only used 1/2 of the jalapeno pepper and removed the seeds -- it was the perfect degree of spicy.  My boyfriend enjoyed it so much that he was licking his plate!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

It's five stars if you follow others' suggestions:  I did like many and only did 1/2 tsp of salt each in the marinade and the tomato sauce; I doubled the sauce (allows extra for dipping Naan); and I did almost no cayenne--the meat had enough "heat" without it.  VERY close to our local place!  thanks for a great recipe!

This was delicious.  The 2 changes I made were to cut the salt in half and doubled the sauce, I like lots of sauce on my rice.  Other then those two changes I followed exactly.  I will be making this again and again and again.

I've just made this dish for the second time and I left out the cayenne pepper as I thought it was too hot the first time! After making it the second time I find it's still too hot! The next time I will also omit the paprika (I only used one teaspoon this time!). There used to be another recipe very similar to this on the website but I have lost my print out and I'm missing it terribly. That recipe called up red pepper(chilli peppers in Ireland/UK) so I added two teaspoons of chili flakes into the marinade. For the sauce the other recipe called up garam masala which as it is as masala I feel this recipe lacks in that! Not sure how much but I've used two teaspoons. I don't add any salt to the sauce and use more natural yoghurt instead of the cream! Hopefully by omitting the paprika the next time I will be closer to the old recipe! Third time lucky?!!

THIS IS FABULOUS!  my husband and i both LOVED it.  I only added 1/2 tsp of salt to the marinade...  and then left out the salt in the rest of the recipe.  it was VERY VERY hot, but so flavorful. the tomato cream sauce was out of this world.  (would like to find a way to make it NOT using heavy cream though) I served it over jasmine rice.

This recipe was really good. I made a few changes.  I personally thought the cumin flavor was a little too strong which made it reminiscent of mexican... I will probably halve it next time.  I squeezed a little extra lemon juice and that seemed to counteract the cumin. I added a touch of curry powder (which I know isn't exactly authentic) but I thought the curry made it taste more like what I'm used to. I sauteed onions and green peppers with the jalepeno and garlic. Some of the Indian places around me serve their tikka masala with those.  Lastly, I left out salt and just added it to taste on my plate.  served with naan and rice- I will definitely make this again.

WAY too much salt, but otherwise a good tasting recipe.  The second time I made it, I reduced the marinade to 1 teaspoon salt, then added salt to taste for the sauce - about 1/2 teaspoon.  Don't salt the sauce until after the chicken is added as it brings plenty of salt with it. I also used fat free half & half instead of cream the second batch, which worked fine.

This was a very simple but tasty dish.  I always love to learn dishes that I always order when I'm out. I would cut back on the cumin a little bit next time, because I have young toddlers who thought it was a little to spicy even without the red chilies.

Easy recipe to follow. Very authentic taste. Replaced the lemon juice with lime for more zing and cut back the salt to 2/3 of recommended quantities, replaced cayenne pepper with sweet paprika. Delicious!

This recipe was awesome.  I did heed the warning on the over salting of this dish so I cut back the salt by more than half on each step.  I definitely recommend this when you feel the need for Indian food.  Don't forget the Naan from Trader Joe's then you'll have the perfect meal.

Fabulous!  This is just as good as what we get at our favorite Indian restaurant.  Next time I will cut back on the pepper in the marinade; it was a little spicy for my boyfriend.

Very good, but way, WAY too salty! It was fairly spicy, but the overwhelming saltiness made it hard to go two bites without water or plenty of rice. Other than that, perfect. I did use a little extra ginger and cinnamon in the marinade though, like always. :) I'll try 1/2 tsp of salt in both the marinade and sauce next time. The chicken tasted fantastic right off the grill too before I added it to the sauce. You could easily serve it with some other appetizers. Also, I only marinated it for about an hour and a half, and it was perfect.

Great, solid recipe.  We make it every few weeks.  The longer the chicken is marinated the better.  I serve it with steamed rice that has caraway seeds mixed in while its cooking.

This was my first crack at cooking indian food and judging by the empty pan, I'd say it was a success.  I marinated the chicken for 24 hours and it was flavorful and juicy.  I doubled the sauce and added some minced ginger.  I used half and half instead of cream and the acidity of the tomato was a little overpowering - I added a tablespoon of honey to counter this.  All in all, a very good recipe.

I also left out the salt and didn't miss it.  Doubled the sauce but not the jalapeño pepper and marinated the chicken over night.  Next time I will use more chicken.  So good!!!

This turned out perfect!  I made it as it is written, but with less salt, and it tasted like it came from a restaurant.  My husband was very impressed with the food and recipe. I will definitely be making it many times in the future.

The first time I ate this was at an Indian restaurant near Kenwood. IT WAS AMAZING!! I was so happy when I found the recipe online. I can't make it nearly as good as the restaurant did, but I live in hope. ^_^

Based on following this recipe exactly... it was pretty bad. The 3 teaspoons of salt in the sauce should have caught my eye, but I didn't notice. It was so salty it was inedible. But the chicken without the sauce was still very tasty! I'll try it again with less salt.

Fantastic recipe, except, like some commenters said, reduce the pepper! Personally I would have reduced the cayenne pepper - my boyfriend loves spicy food and he thought it was incredibly spicey as is.

I made this in the summer, is great. I did cut back some on the salt, but not as much as other reviewers did. Consider handling all of the peppers with gloves, there's more than just a couple involved in this one. Didn't have swekers, but broiled the chicken in a roasting pan with a drip and worked out well.

It was a little too spicy for my taste...if there was a way to tune it down then I'll give it another try.

I made this recipe and shared it with friends - we all loved it although I also thought that it was a bit on the salty side; taking the other reviews in mind, I only used one teaspoon of salt for each part of the recipe; next time I make it I'll reduce that down to 1/2 teaspoon for sure.  Definitely worth it though - SO tasty and so much easier than other Tikka Masala recipes I've seen.

Wow. Who knew? The tikka, without the masala, is also a good recipe (and a little healthier). I make the tikka with chicken thighs sometimes... soooo good!  But if you have the time and energy, the complete dish is amazing!

This is hands down better than any Indian restaurant in town.  I've had it with chicken, amazing, and also make an adjustment for a vegetarian with cauliflour, new potatoes, peas, carrots, and green beans, still amazing.

I didn't really know what to expect, but I was pretty impressed with this recipe.  Tried a canned very prior to this, and it was disgusting.  Will make again.

based upon the reviews i read i reduced all the spices in the marinade by half except the ginger. i also marinated the chicken overnight and doubled the sauce recipe. i served it on indian style basmati rice with a side of naan. it turned out wonderful.

Loved this recipe.  Cut down salt as others suggested. Only used about 2 tsp in the marinade, none in the sauce.  Substituted Garam Masala for cumin in the sauce and because I doubled the recipe and didn't have 2 cups of heavy cream, I used 1 cup of half and half and 1 cup of yogurt.  Also added an additional tsp of cayenne pepper to the marinade. Turned out great!  The next time I make this I will cut down the cinnamon or maybe omit it altogether.  It was the dominant flavor in the dish and that's the one thing I didn't care for.  It tasted very similar to the chicken tikka masala I've had at two different Indian restaurants.  I'll make my own now when I have the craving for it rather than driving 30 minutes to pick up takeout.

So good! I made it according to the notes someone else had left in their comments. Basically doubling a lot of it to have extra sauce. Its a good thing I did, it didn't feel like there was much covering the chicken as it was! I also kept out most of the salt as was suggested and added garam masala to both the marinade and the sauce. There was one taste that I couldn't identify that I would lessen next time around, but can't say exactly what it was. The meal was a hit with the family though.

This recipe is soo good! I loved it, and it tasted exactly like I expected and hoped it would.  Here's how I made it:  I replaced cinnamon, black pepper and cumin with garam masala but left the cayenne and the paprika the same.  I only used a couple dashes of salt in the whole recipe.  I also added cauliflower.  I microwaved some fresh cauliflower in water, drained it and added it to the sauce after the chicken.  It added another great texture to chew and some nutrition but didn't change the taste at all.  I grilled the chicken on skewers on a char coal grill, you could definitely taste the grill taste. This made for a wonderful valentines day meal.

Must add that I did omit the salt and scaled down on the spices a bit as I did not want it to be too spicy. It worked for me. Will recommend this to anyone. Fantastic!

One of the best recipes EVER! I made two changes: (1) Like others, I didn't add ANY salt; (2) I cooked the chicken in a skillet instead of on the grille. This is amazing!

This was a great recipe! I followed others' suggestions and cut way down on the salt.  I also made a few substitutions due to being out of some of the ingredients;  I substuted sour cream for the yogurt in the marinade. I used green pepper instead of jalepeno to cut down on the heat and chili powder for cumin in the sauce since I was short on cumin.  Also, I browned the chicken and made the sauce all in the same pan to save on dishes.  Even with these changes, I had great results! Thanks!

Not really sure what the fuss is about.  It is not what I'm used to......    After making it, I realized that I just could have made the sauce as directed plus a little bit of cinnamon and taco seasoning  plus grilled chicken and gotten the same flavor.   I am used to a thinner, more red tomato sauce base and less cinnamon flavor.   This turned out extremely thick with the cream and was a peachy-pink color.  I did however figure out on my own that the salt was too much.... I'll keep looking for something more authentic.

I breaded my chicken breasts, cooked in lightly oiled pan till done, laid on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes, fettucini noodles or penni noodles then poured sauce over chicken, it was a great meal.  Doubling the sauce made for a creamier meal.

Excellent recipe, though I made the following "compromises" and it still came out fine.  - Used about half the salt, as recommended by other reviewers.  Good call. - Grilled the chicken in a frying pan without skewers. - Added about a teaspoon of freshly ground coriander. - Used ground ginger instead of fresh ginger. - Did not have any cayenne on hand.  The only thing I'll change next time is to add the cayenne.  Without it, so the dish came out fairly mild.  If you like medium to "hot" dishes at a typical Indian restaurant, you'll definitely want the cayenne too.

This is a quick recipe for Tikka masala and fairly tasty, but not quite like what's served in Indian restaurants. I think the cumin is overpowering and dominates the overall flavor. 
Tip: the cilantro is vital to the taste, so don't skip out on that thinking it's just for garnishing.

really good recipe; maybe not the EXACT traditional restaurant taste, but pretty darn close!  in fact, it was more flavorful than the restaurants.  followed others' advise and cut down salt a lot (used only 1.5 tsp for marinade and 1.5 tsp for sauce).  I used only 1 tsp of cayenne and the recommended paprika and still found it to be quite spicy (AND I AM USED TO SPICE).  also, i used diced canned tomatoes w/ couple spoonfuls of tomato paste that i had and it came out well...gave it a chunky sauce that i liked better.  used lot of lime/lemon juice also.

When I read the recipe I thought it may be too salty for us so I cut the salt out of the marinade altogether and used NSA tomato sauce. The finished dish was comparable to any Indian restaurant. I served it with basmati rice and naan (recipe from this site).

Where is the pop? I followed the recipe exactly except added about half the salt called for. My family has a wimpy midwestern palate, so it does not take much for them to say something is too spicy - as written, this dish was not spicy at all - very bland, with indistinct, but pleasant flavor. It was not by any means bad, it was just kind of... there. If I was served this in a restaurant, I would probably not go back. If I made it again, I would definitely find a different recipe.

Delicious over rice with naan. I cut down the salt to 1 tsp each in the marinade and in the sauce.  I used milk in place of the cream to lighten up the recipe.  I cook the chicken on an indoor grill and don't bother skewering it.

You do not need to add that much salt to anything! That was shocking to see that in the recipe. I didn't add any salt and it was still tasty. I only added 1 tsp. of the cayenne pepper and that was just the right amount of heat for me.

This was a great recipe though I did have to change it a bit. For starters I took the suggestions of others and used 1 tsp of garam marsala in the marinade and reduced the amount of salt to a reasonable level. Also since I don't have a grill I put the chicken with the marinade still on it in the oven at 475 until the chicken was done. This turned out really well and didn't require much clean up. For the sauce I used half and half instead of heavy cream since we didn't have any, but to give it the same thickness I added cashews. Everyone at my house just loved it with the cashews. This recipe is awesome with the changes.

This recipe was delicious, but I made a few changes. 

I did not use anywhere near the amount of salt the recipe calls for. I used maybe 1/2 a tablespoon each for the sauce and marinade.

Since it's cold out, I marinated and baked some whole chicken breasts instead of using a grill. I cut the chicken up and added them to the sauce afterward, and it worked just fine.

I love spicy food, but since my family members do not, I omitted the jalapeno and cut the amount of cayenne in half. I also added an extra can of tomato sauce.

The result was still fairly spicy, so if you're sensitive to spicy foods I suggest being very careful about seasoning the sauce. 

It wouldn't hurt to have an extra can of tomato sauce on hand in case you want to dilute it.

It was great! Almost as good as my favorite restaurant.

As previous reviewers suggested, I reduced to the salt in the marinade to 3/4 t, and to taste while cooking in the skillet.  I LOVE this recipe.  This was the first Indian recipe I decided to spring on my melanin-challenged, whitebread, American BF.  He always proclaimed that he HATED Indian food, so when he asked what was for dinner, I answered "Chicken."  He's a cop so he continued probing: "Chicken and WHAT?" Answer-- "Chicken and rice."  My strategy was to evade and obfuscate and hope he would give up.  He did.  When he tried it, he loved it, and that's when I revealed my deceit.  Now he eats all kinds of Indian dishes and he loves them.  So advice to people unsure about exotic foods--try this one--you'll like it!

My daughter and I LOVED this recipe...husband did not, but only because he is NOT a fan of cumin (so that's his fault ;-)

Only change I made was doubling the 2nd part of the recipe for more sauce to put over rice.  Oh...and sauteed some ripe red peppers and tossed that in with the sauce and chicken.  DELISH and SIMPLE!!!!

Overall this recipe was good.  We actually tried this on a george foreman instead of a grill and it worked really well with the skewers.  We followed the recipe exactly and one thing we would omit is the salt - it was way too salty.  Also, a little sugar and more tomato sauce might help tone down this spicy dish.

I wish I could give this recipe 4.5 stars instead of 4. It's very delicious, but it wasn't quite mind-blowingly "the best!"

This recipe is written very spicy and salty. I reduced the salt to 1 tsp in the marinade, and 1/2 tsp in the sauce. Because I'm a wimp, I used only a quarter of the cayenne and black pepper.

A very delicious recipe!

Oh wow this was spicy delicious. I prepared this dish for a get together and used a mixture of chicken thighs and breasts; the guests seemed to prefer the thighs. I doubled the quantity of meat but did not double the marinade or sauce, there was more than enough to go around. In the future, I'll make a double batch and seal-a-meal some of the marinated skewers. I can take a few out before work then just toss them on the grill and whip out the tomato sauce when I get home.

This recipe was very good. I'm sure for some its a 5, but my fiancee and I like a little more spice. It could have been our own fault that it wasn't perfect though. I used to have a huge bottle of Cayenne Pepper, but it was thrown out at some point and I couldn't find it in any of our major grocery stores, so we went without. In the end we added Garam Masala, which was at the store :), and it gave it a little more depth. Our true rating would be 4.5, but since it wasn't quite a 5 for us, we had to round down. We will definitely use this one again.

This was amazing. I fell in love with Chicken Tikka Masala from an indian restaraunt. It was amazing. My girlfriend who doesn't really care for indiana food even loved it. I would like to note that when I made this, I omitted the salt. It really did not need it.

Excellent recipe, but like many others have mentioned, way too much salt.  i've made it twice since my first attempt (where i followed the recipe to a "t"), and now i use simply 1 tablespoon in the marinade and that's it.  I figure there is enough seasoning between that and the other spices... and now it still tastes great without making you feel like you're shriveling up from the inside out!

This came out really great.  I had a bad experience trying to make a Chicken Sagh (my favorite Indian cuisine dish) so I was hesitant to try masala but it was very simple and came out perfectly.  My roommate was begging for the recipe!  I added chickpeas to the dish as well.  It's probably not something I would make often because of the heavy cream but whenever I'm jonesing for an Indian fix, I'll definitely make this.

Like many other reviewers, I am a huge fan of tikka masala.  After making this dish, my boyfriend and I have decided we prefer this version to any other we've had in an Indian restaurant.

I did make a few changes.  Per some suggestions, I used much less salt (about 1/3 of what was called for).  I also substituted 1/2 and 1/2 for the heavy cream, which made the dish lighter while maintaining the richness of the sauce.  I added a bit of garam masala and cayenne to the sauce and omitted the jalapeno.  Instead of grilling, I cooked the chicken on the stove top in a pan coated with cooking spray.  I served this with vegetable korma, brown and basmati rice, naan, and yogurt.

After I try making this again using waaaay less salt, it could have the potential of being worthy of 5 stars.  I can't believe any person on the planet could consume the amount of salt given for this recipe.  On the other hand the recipe does include the "or to taste" disclaimer with both salt amounts given.  I've found though that the amount of salt given in a recipe is usually pretty darn close to or for my family's taste a little less than what is needed to enhance the flavor of the dish.  On a positive note, we really liked the spice blend.  I didn't have the jalapeno for the sauce, but we didn't think it needed it.  For our taste there was plenty of heat from the cayenne pepper in the marinade.  I am going to make this again paying close attention to the salt and I will add to the sauce a sliced onion sauteed for a few minutes before adding the garlic.  A restaurant I ate this at had some onion in the sauce and I really liked it.

WAY too salty.  We couldn't even eat the leftovers.  It has potential though, I think next time I'll decrease the salt and also the cayenne pepper.

Mmm whole family loved this recipe! I had a couple variations: used Greek yogurt (for extra flavor), marinated the chicken overnight, and then baked it in the oven the next day. Great with basmatti rice and some sauteed veggies. Will make again!

Far too salty!  The next time I make this I will decrease the salt by at least half.  This is my husband's favorite dish at our local Indian restaurant- it's a very convincing replica!

If you omit all salt and marinade the chicken overnight, the recipe will be great!

This is my first attempt in trying to make indian food, and it came out wonderful.  I followed the advice of eliminating the salt (just sprinkled some in) and I used half of a jalapeno pepper just because I was afraid it might be too spicy.  I was scared of what my fiance' would think, because he never eats Indian food, but he loved it!  I served the dish with some roti, and it was delicious!

After making America's Test Kitchen's version of this dish many times, I went looking for advice on how to adapt it to the grill. When I found this recipe and it was so highly rated, I thought I'd give the alternate marinade and sauce a try.

The original recipe was inedible, mainly because it was much too salty, but the spice mixture was also much more concentrated in the sauce than I was expecting. If you make this recipe, be sure to follow the advice in the comments, unlike us.

We also had trouble with the chicken cubes slipping on the skewers when it was time to turn them. If you don't already use double-pronged skewers, a good tip is to skewer each set of chicken pieces with two to make flipping them much simpler.

Yummylicious!
This is so different, and quite easy to make.
I must say, it makes me sad when some people   change most of a recipe, then when it doesn't turn out right, they take away stars.
I changed nothing and give it five stars.
*For cooks wanting to try this recipe however, I might cut the salt in half next time.  We love salt, but my hubby and I both thought less salt would take it over the top, that's the only change we would make.
Thanks for bringing something new to our table!

Lovely and tasty, but the sauce was a bit too salty even though I followed other reviewers' advice and added only 1 tsp of salt. Next time I won't add any!

I read the salt reviews after the fact.  Did the potatoes and lemon thing and then even tried to double the sauce - it didn't even slightly assist.

I read all the other reviews and planned on reducing the salt in this recipe.  However, the airhead that I am, started making this dish and continued to put the suggested amount of salt in.  Big mistake... Way too salty!  I must of drank a gallon of water in the hour following dinner.  Otherwise, a good recipe.  So don't be an airhead like me, and remember to cut the salt in half at the very least!!!  I would suggest serving this with jasmine rice.

This recipes is very authentic but one must OMIT the salt.  The heavy cream can be decreased a bit and the results are still quite good!

My first time making (& eating) Indian food and I think I nailed it! :] This was awesome!! Didn't add much salt, & substituted green/red peppers for the jalapeños! (Also, used Fat Free half-n-half instead of heavy cream!) Definitely making this again! The BF said it tasted like authentic Indian food... WooHoo (points for me)!!
I highly recommend this dish... thanx!

This recipe is outstanding!  I took the advice of the other reviewers and put in much less salt than the recipe called for.  I did 1 tsp. for the marinade and 3/4 tsp. for the sauce.  It was just right, and the spice is PERFECT for anyone who enjoys a spicy Indian dish.  This is just as good, if not better, than the Indian restaurant we frequent.  I'm thrilled to add this to my cooking repetoire.

Excellent recipe. Probably the best recipe I have ever found on Allrecipes.com. Pair it with some nice basmati rice and fire grill your own nann and you are set. You may never need to go to that local Indian restaurant again.

I really enjoyed making this recipe and even though I was going to bring a dish of it to my cousin, I decided to freeze it for later instead.  Next time I'll make more so I can share.  I followed many other reviewers suggestions and just loved it.

What a disappointment.  All these reviews said that it tasted really authentic, like restaurant Chicken Tikka Masala, but it tasted NOTHING like anything I've ever had by that name.  Guess it's back to the take-out for me.

I followed everyone's advice and reduced the salt and cayenne/jal. I could only find non-fat plain yogurt (which is absolutely disgusting by itself), which may be the reason my husband thought it wasn't sweet enough?. I thought it was good, and just needs to be less spicy. Otherwise an excellent recipe.

Minus the salt, this recipe is absolutely AMAZING.  My boyfriend says it tastes just like restaurant chicken tikka masala.  My suggestions would be to cut the salt in 1/4 or maybe just omit it completely.  I will definitely be making this again!!

AWESOME recipe! Im a horrible cook who LOVES Indian food and I was SO happy to have found such an easy and tasty recipe for tikka masala.  I took the advice of others and cut the salt in half, omitted the jalapenos, and used milk instead of cream.  This was soooo good my husband and I couldnt stop talking about it.  I made it with a doctored-up version of Cucumber Raita (also on this site); it will be one of my regular recipes from now on!  I think this recipe will also be good using Indian Cheese (paneer), which I will try next week

This recipe was awesome! I did change it a little though. I added a 1/2 cup of chopped onion and half the salt this recipe called for. The first time i made this it was a little salty, but w/ half the salt it ws great! Im only 15 which means it was super easy to make!

Excellent recipe.  I would mention that I used the salt amount that was in the recipe, and I could hardly choke it down.  Made it again with much less salt, and was much better.

Definitely, the salt amount is so totally wrong! I used a tsp. for the marinade and 1/2 tsp for the sauce. But the results were so tasty! Our guest finished off the sauce next morning (no chicken left) over basmati rice. I plan to do this for a large party very soon.

Wow was this good! Very easy to make. My wife who is usually a lot more conservative with her culinary adventures than I am, enjoyed this dish a lot. I guess thats a great sign right? The only changes I made was to cut the salt by about half and substitute the heavy cream with evaporated milk to make this a little more friendly on the waist. Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper.

Nothing short of delicious! I really wasn't convinced this would be good considering the variety of ingredients but it was incredible! The only thing I did differently was cut back the salt (as suggested) to 1 tsp total and I just went ahead and served the chicken on the skewers with the sauce drizzled over. This way there was more than enough sauce and the wonderful flavors of the marinade did not drown in the sauce. Also made a lovely presentation!

This is the easiest and tastiest recipe I've come across for Chicken Tikka Masala.  I have made this several times for my Indian husband and he loves it! I do not add any salt since the first time it was WAY too salty. Also when I do not feel like firing up the grill I saute the chicken pieces in a skillet.

I used JANICER8's recommendations, including using several teaspoons of garam masala, no cinnamon and very little salt. I think that made all of the difference. This recipe was absolutely delicious. It tasted almost exactly like what we would get in an Indian restaurant. Unfortunately, it is very high fat with all of the cream and butter but I will definitely make this again as a treat once in a while!

Flavor was awesome but the SALT - my God the SALT.

Very easy to make - even easier if you leave out at least half the SALT!

Ok, I do have to agree about the salt. You could definitely cut it in half. Aside from that, this stuff is simply AMAZING. I did 'up' the cream a little bit so there was more - and have a really good bread on hand for dipping.

Fabulous! My fiance and I love to cook together and try new recipes. After reading several reviews we cut waaaay back on the salt, but kept everything else the same. Turned out wonderfully. And the leftovers werent that bad, either.

Great spicy recipe. I made two whole chickens, cut into pieces, and microwaved the pieces for 10 minutes to shorten grill time (especially for legs quarters). Indian restaurants in the US generally serve without the heat and spiciness this cuisine deserves (hmm, Indian kids eat it spicy). My kids loved it with the heat, but they're accustomed. Quadrupled the sauce. Next time will use half & half and/or evap milk (great idea), and cut the salt. I hadn't read the reviews, but couldn't get myself to pour all that in by instinct.

The recipe is very decent; indeed, one needs to decrease drastically the salt amount in order to have a tasty dish. I also put only about a third of the suggested cayenne pepper, since I like medium-hot food and the suggested proportions would have resulted in a very spicy meal. Overall, I like this recipe a lot and would certainly use it again.

This was fun to make. I had a lot of leftover yogurt marinade and didn't know what to do with it. I ended up throwing it out so I could follow the recipe this first time but maybe next time I'll put it in with the sauce? Did anyone try that? this dish was pretty good but the leftovers were terrible, turned in to a pasty, flavorless thing the day after.

Make sure and reduce the salt to at least 1/2.  Otherwise this is amazing, my last guest that ate it said "its all I can do to stop myself from drinking the sauce"  serve with basmati rice and naan from this site.

I would think there must be some mistake with the amount of salt--I cooked it precisely as directed except as noted below, and about 6 people all agree that the salt overpowers the rest of the ingredients.  HOWEVER otherwise, this is a fabulous recipe, and I definitely recommend it to others (reducing the salt... unless you into that sort of thing; which is cool, too).  The alteration I made was broiling the chicken for about 7 minutes each side instead of grilling it; however, this made the chicken a bit dry, so for all the apartment people out there without grills, I would recommend broiling it for about 4-5 minutes each side instead of 7.

Cut wayyyyy back on the salt and this is an incredibly delicious recipe.  I put a little less cayenne than it calls for, and I diced a green pepper and an onion instead of a jalapeno pepper, because when I made it as written, it was way too spicy for me.  I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream and it came out great (and some of it was the fat free kind).  It was slightly less creamy, but still quite creamy and practically cuts the fat in half, which is important when you're watching your weight and cholesterol like I am.

If you like Indian food, give this a try.  I can almost guarantee you'll love it!

This is a great recipe. It was cold outside, so I just broiled the chicken in the oven. Came out perfectly. I marinated the chicken overnight, and I think that may be important for really great taste. The recipe is quite spicy, so if you cannot handle a lot of spice, decrease the measurements.  I also only added about 2 tsp of salt total. I served this with dal over basmati rice and it was delightful!

Very tasty. It is a unique dish that is perfect for dinner parties where you want to make something that most people haven't had before. I think the portions are to small, it could use more peppers (I double or triple the amount), double the amount of sauce and DON'T ADD ANY SALT! Serve with naan bread, white rice and papadum chips with mango chutney dip.

I made it with less salt and ceyanne than suggested, but it was still too spicy and herby. It didn't have that sweet creamy flavor that I like from restaurant versions.

Excellent. A bit of trouble to grill the chicken but well worth the effort. I am making this my top curry recipe for now. I also tried it with some chickpeas thrown in and served it with cauliflower--> excellent, pitas are what I use for bread. I heat them in a dry skillet for a few miutes- much better that way.

This was really good! I love Indian food but had never tried to make any Indian dishes, but this recipe made it easy! I don't have a grill at my apartment so I just cooked the chicken on a really hot skillet, turning once, until it was done. The yogurt marinade burned almost immediately on the skillet, but as long as you're using a non-stick pan, it comes right off. Plus the little pieces that stick to the chicken add some of that grill-like smoky taste. ALSO, topping this with cilantro (green) chutney (also on allrecipes) is FABULOUS. Great recipe, will definitely make this again!

I think this recipe is good, although I'm not really sure because I've never had Indian food before this.  My husband liked it.  I marinated the meat for about 24 hours, and I used an entire 15 oz can of tomato sauce to make more yummy sauce, as per the suggestions of other reviewers.  I had to make my chicken on skewers propped over a casserole dish in a 450 degree oven, as it is currently an arctic tundra where I live, and I couldn't grill outside.  I may make this again come summertime.

Call me sheltered, but I have never had Indian food so this was my first! I followed the recipe as is, except omitted all of the salt as I gathered from other reviewers. I also cut the 'fire factor' in half as I am a total whimp when it comes to heat! I served this over brown rice with a vegetable side. This has very distinct flavor (as Indian food does). My kids were not fans of this AT ALL but I will make it again someday.

fantastic. but i do agree with the rest. too much salt. just salt it like you would with anything else, to taste. don't worry about measuring it. also i would but a full can of 15oz tomato sauce. it makes more sauce, and once it reduces, more flavorful

I don't claim to be an expert on Indian cuisine, but this was as good, if not better, than our favorite restaurant's tikka masala. The ingredients are simple and the recipe is easy to follow. Like the others, I halved the cayenne and omitted the salt with perfect results. I probably could have added more spice but wanted to play it safe my first time. Made with brown basmati rice and naan. Highly recommend!

DH made this recipe using boneless chicken thighs.  We are wimps when it comes to hot so he reduced the cumin down to 1tsp in marinade and 1 tsp in sauce.  He decreased the cayenne 1/4 tsp and only put in 1/2tsp jalapeno.  It was still "warm" but he scarfed it and said to be sure I give it a 5.  Will make again!

This recipe was ok.  Nothing I was overly thrilled about.  It didn't taste nearly as good as I could get at a nearby Indian resturant.  It took a long time to make which isn't a good thing when the Indian food craving hits you.  Plus, it is much more cost effective to just buy it at a resturant.  However, the recipe was easy and I am glad I at least tried it.  I will probably not make it again though

This recipe is amazing - but as many reviewers have said, be careful of the salt! When I first made this recipe I didn't read the reviews, and added a total of 10 tbsp of salt throughout the recipe. The result was completely inedible. The second time through, I only added one tbsp of salt to the mix used to coat the chicken, and none to the sauce - and it was great! Very yummy. A little more time-consuming than I expected, but definitely worth the effort.

Much easier than I anticipated. Not as good as the local Indian Restaurant (to be expected), but a pretty good approximation. I used no salt due to other reviews, but it definitely needs some next time.  I would add more of all the spices next time, it was a little on the bland side (though it may be primarily due to the lack of salt ). I grilled the chicken pieces on a George Foreman grill for 5 minutes, and they turned out perfectly.

I agree that this recipe has waaaay too much salt in it, and I only put about half of the listed amounts.  It's too much for me, but my salt-addicted husband loves it.  The tikka masala we are used to has chunks of onion and green peppers in it.  I miss the vegetables and will be adding them into the marinade next time.

This recipe was so incredibly easy and fun to make and I highly recommend it! I only used about 2-3 teaspoons salt instead of the 7 or 8 that it called for and used half-and-half instead of the heavy cream. It turned out really good and really spicy!! I recommend those that like a more mild spice to their dish to maybe use 1/2 a jalepeno or cut back on the cayenne pepper. But this dish was great!

i omitted the salt (all of it), i also omitted the seeds from the jalapeno, and omitted the cayenne pepper, but added the cilantro to the jalapeno garlic saute and the recipe was plenty spicy.  tasted as good as many Indian resturants i have tried.

Wow!  All these people saying they don't need their Indian restaurant after finding this recipe are right.  This recipe (using only 1/2 tsp salt each in the marinade and sauce) surpasses anything I've had to date.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Excellent! My husband couldn't believe that I made it. I added salt to taste only and that was enough. No need to add all the salt that the recipe asks for. To cut down on cholesterol, I used Smart Balance Light and half and half. It tasted awesome!

Way too much salt. Glad I adjusted; however, even using one-fourth of the salt was too much, and the end result was inedible. I had to whip up another batch of the sauce, without the salt, and added it to the mix. This helped somewhat. As a last result, I used that old trick of adding a peeled potato to the pot, and that helped draw off enough of the salt that the other flavors could be enjoyed. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, but please... just advise readers to "salt to taste" next time.

I made the yogurt souce and instead of letting the chicken marinate in it...I rolled the chicken breasts in it and baked it till tender.  I poured out the rest of the marinade.  I added less salt to it by the way.... Ok...Then I whipped up the cream sauce on the stove and when the chicken was done I poured it over the baked chicken and served it over rice.  Ok...I did not grill it - but it was "a keeper" according to the hubby.  The rest of the family raved and I thought it was heaven.  I am not sure how it differed from the regular way of cooking it - but with those kind of reviews from the family - I think I will make it the same say next time.  The chicken was tender and the flavor was awesome!

This dish had a wonderful flavor and the recipe was easy to follow. I didn't have the grill handy to cook the chicken, so I modified the recipe using the broiler setting in my oven. Still a lovely dish. Like other reviewers, I cut the salt back to 1/4 the original amount. Next time I'll try the grill and will add garam masala.

Left out the salt (good thing!) Great flavor, but I thought it was a little heavy. Need a lighter substitution for the heavy cream. Eat with the Naan by mic!

i make this weekly, only i do follow the suggestions to add a lot less salt.  And i double the sauce to have extra, so good the next day.  My boyfriend is from India and he thinks he's died and gone to heaven, this is so easy and so delicious!  I serve it with the basmati recipe and flat bread as i can not for the live of me make naan.

I love indian food, but don't typically like to cook it because of all the different ingredients you need.  This was easy to make & it was so good.  I wasn't able to grill the chicken since it was raining, I am sure that would have made it even better!

I really enjoyed this recipe, I made it for a group of friends and they loved it. They said it was better than from a restaurant. I listened to the the other comments and did not put salt. I added 1/2 a cup of coconut milk and a tablespoon of tandoori .

This was perfect. I had to leave out the cilantro (supermarket was out) but it tasted fine without. I also baked the chicken rather than grilling it. Would definitely recommend serving over pilau rice with naan bread.

I only added 2 tea of salt to the entire recipe and the final product still tasted really salty! The cumin was the major turnoff for me in this recipe. I was very disappointed.

This recipe is golden!  I've made it three times now and it has turned out delicious every time.  The only change I would make is only 2 tsp of salt in the marinade and 1 in the sauce (or, just add salt to taste).

This was really good.  What I will do different next time is cut back on the cayenne as it was a bit too spicy for my taste coupled with the japaleno which I will not cut back on as I love them (I also left the seeds in).  I will also leave the cinnamon out completely.

My boyfriend and I made this and it was absolutely delicious!!  As noted by other reviewers we only used salt to taste and less red pepper flake (I can't take too much spice) and even my boyfriend who adores spicy food thought it was spicy...which is good.  We will definitely be making more of this, next time a double batch to freeze for later.  Thanks for sharing!

Exquisite and definitely five stars; for years I have sort to find a good recipe for my all time favorite Indian dish, and this is definitely the one.  I’ve made this dish three times now and got better results every time as I learned with practice.  I made slight adjustments to taste but only to the cayenne pepper, jalapeño and salt quantities.  I‘ve now started doubling up on the ingredients, making this in bulk and freezing some for when the CTM cravings hit; which is almost daily.  And for those who down graded this recipe because of the salt quantities, please note the author did say ‘or to taste’.  After all, isn’t the fun part to adjust the recipes to make it your own?  Thank you Yakuta.

This dish calls for way too much salt!!!  I made the huge mistake of not reading the reviews, yet I still thought it looked like too much and reduced it (added 1/2 to 2/3 of what was recommended for the sauce) and it was still awful.

When I tasted it and told my boyfriend I added too much salt he said "nonsense... I love salt" but then he tasted it.  To make me feel better he still said "the flavor is good".  I could easily give this recipe 4 stars if the salt were reduced or eliminated, as is, I don't think this dish is edible.

I had been trying out new bread recipes and found one for Nan and needed a recipe to go with it, so tried this one. It was delicious and I am now hooked on Indian food. I did as other reviews suggested and eliminated the salt, adding it where I felt it needed it (I added a bit to the sauce). Defintely a keeper!

I found it rather bland, something was missing, but I don't know what. I reduced the amount of salt, and added a bit of tomato puré and some Tandoori paste. But the kids liked it, even though they said it was not quite as good as at our local tandoori restaurant.
** changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars after reheating it the next day. The taste of the sauce was quite delicious then!

I love this recipe!! 
tikka masala is huge in the uk and my friends agree this rivals what we get in restaurants. even my mum loves it when i cook her this. 
i rarely change a thing when using your recipe, though it is easy to adjust spicy heat to taste. 
I've shared this recipe with friends from greece and spain, and your wonder is slowly spreading through europe.
thanks

Wayyyy too much salt.
Well, I did make this when I was only 14, and had poor judgement when it came to things that go a long way, like salt.

I'm sure it would be great with far less salt.
But this is just absurd.

I loved this dish.  It was just spicy enough for everyone in my family to enjoy even when my little helper bought  vanilla yogurt instead of plain.  It still was pretty good.

i skipped the salt. i make this into a sandwhich mayo and honey mustard are my fav.  use italian flat bread as your bread it makes a perfect sandwhich oh and what it is missing is about 2 tsp of garlic 1/2 tsp of turmeric and increase the lemon juice a tad in the marinade.  hope this helps everyone out.

I followed this recipe exactly except for these steps...used boneless thighs - cooked in broiler - used 2 tsp salt in marinade, none in sauce - put 1 tsp garam masals in sauce - and halved the cayenne in marinade (cooking for large party, wanted to make it more appealing to all palates).  Also added grilled onions and peppers and doubled the recipe.

Delicious!

Cilantro is essential to the flavor - don't skip it if you can help it....

This is possibly my favorite dish ever. After years of experimentation, minor modifications have perfected this dish for me. I toss two large cubed up chicken  breasts in low-fat plain yogurt with the other marinade ingredients (according to the original recipe), refrigerate in the marinade for an hour or two, spread the cubes out on a foiled tray, and bake at 400F for 15 minutes, then stick under lo broil for about 5-10 minutes, until slightly browned. While the chicken is cooking, I make the sauce. I use half butter and half olive oil, pre-diced jalepenos and pre-minced garlic. I use a large (28 oz) can of tomato sauce, a half pint (small container) of heavy cream, and maybe slightly more of each spice than the recipe calls for (except salt; I may use a total of 3 tsp in the whole recipe). This makes a good amount of sauce to coat the chicken and plenty for dressing the rice! Once the chicken is out of the broiler, I dump it in the sauce, cook on low for another 10 minutes and serve on fresh Basmati rice (with cilantro if I have some). Best.Indian.Dish.Ever. :)

I made this recipe with the changes suggested by others (less salt and cinnamon) and my fiance and I loved it!  I'll be definitely be making this regularly, though it's still not as good as what we used to eat in NYC.

I have made this recipe several times and it's always a hit!  I do suggest using no salt.  The amount that they want you to use HAS to be a typo....it was awful the one time that I used the salt recommended.  Anyhoo.  :)  The japs are essential to this tasting very authentic.  I do not use the yogurt for the chicken.  Just simply cut the chicken into very small pieces and cook it in a pan.  It's just as good in my opinion.  Let's see...I also use a bit of Garam Masala and Cardamom. These spices also make it TRULY authentic tasting.  I love this recipe better than any Tikka Masala I have ever tried.

Fantastic. WITH MODIFICATIONS. Even leaving the salt and jalapeno out of the sauce it was too salty. And about as spicy as I found travelling in India, which for an  American like me, is waaay too spicy (and I like spicy food). It is so good though, I ate through the pain and sweat.I almost think the salt was a typo. This recipe would be perfect (and still spicy) with 1(one!)tsp of cayenne and 2tsp of salt in the marinade. If you really like spicy go for the jalapeno too but only put 4t of cayenne in the marinade if eye-watering pain is your thing.

I've tried a few different recipes and prepackaged mixes/sauces for this dish but so far this one's the best!  It was pretty heavy so next time I'd try half and half, but with heavy cream it is similar to tikka masala I've had in restaurants.  
I thought it needed the sauce doubled as others did.  I used about twice as much garlic and also added about 3 tblsp tomato paste because it didn't taste tomato-ish at all to me.  And I added about 1 tsp garam masala as others suggested.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Super good! I mean really good! I changed a few things though, I left the seeds out of the jalepenos, and used garam masala in the marinade, and cut out most of the salt only seasoning at the end. I also did not skewer the chicken before I grilled it. I served it over jasmine rice and it was really tastey!

This recipe was excellent!!!  I made chicken tikka from a box and made the tikka masala from the last paragraph.  I did not use jalapeno and salt according to taste.  Heavy cream was very rich, so I will use light cream the next time.  Great to make at home, but not as good as I have had in restaurants.

I am loving that I found this recipe!  As much as I love spicy food, the whole jalapeno was a bit too much... may cut that down in half for the next time. I replaced the cinnamon with curry powder after reading all of the reviews about the funny taste. I also only added 1 tsp of salt at the very end to cut a bit back on the saltiness. Granted, it isn't _exactly_ like what I am used to, but it is a GREAT substitute that I know I can make at home :)

I loved the ingredients, but there was too much salt in the sauce. I marinated the chicken and it looked great, but then when I made the sauce the whole dish was ruined because of the amount of salt.

Great recipe!  I marinated the chicken overnight and only used 1 tsp. salt for the entire recipe. Chicken Tikka Masala is one of my favorites and I have several recipes-this one is my favorite.

I agree with the other reviewers that this recipe is way too salty and spicy.  I cut the salt and cayenne in half and felt the heat was okay but that it was still too salty.  Four stars with modifications and because it was really easy.

Great recipe, but WAY TOO MUCH SALT! I used 1.5 teaspoons and it was plenty.  Used whole milk and the sauce was a little runny but good. The marinaded chicken is what makes this recipe, make sure to grill or broil.

A GREAT recipe.  We don't have an Indian restaurant in our area, so this definitely satisfied my craving.  I did take the pepper (red, black & jalapeno) down by half, which made it much more palatable for my not-so-brave palate.

After reading everything about what the readers said. I made this without any salt until the end. Last visit out to San Francisco to see our son, we always eat from a restaurant around the corner. They have the best Chicken Masala. I must say that this receipe is a keeper. I think it is close if not better from what we had in San Francisco. My husband is not much for words when it comes to food, but this one made him talk all through the meal. He said it's great. 
The only thing I did differently was I added Garam Marsala season (2 teas.)instead of the salt. You can find this in the grocery store. I will look forward to making this again.

Good stuff!  Substituted the cayenne for jarred chili pepper and left out the jalapeno, in efforts to bring the spice to a level my kids could eat.  Without those, it was still very spicy but with more of a flavorful spice than a heated one.  Next time I will half the salt too.  Served over brown rice with a side of steamed broccoli.  They all gave it a cheerful thumbs up.  Thanks!

I thought this was OK.  It was totally different than any Chicken Tikka Masala than I've ever had - and I've had the real stuff in India before!  It's not bad, it's just not what I was expecting.

I think this recipe has great potential but I messed up by adding the recommended 4 tsp of salt and it was VERY salty. I thought maybe I did something wrong, but I resized it (love that feature!) and it still had alot of salt. I would recommend maybe 1 tsp of salt, not 4.  I am definitely going to try again but with less salt. The favors were very interesting.

4 stars due to salt hazard. I'm not a griller, and I believe that my way of making this recipe produces a much tastier sauce; this is what I do. First I cut the salt down to 1 and a half tsp in the marinade and 1 tsp in the sauce. I add 1 tsp of coriander per batch to the marinade and let it marinate for at least 2 hours, up to overnight. I don't use skewers, I just arrange the pieces on foil lined cookie sheets so they don't touch and roast them for 14-17 minutes at 425 degrees. They will shrink a bit and the marinade changes and clings to the meat and clear juice begins to form in the pan. Then when I add the meat to the sauce, I also pour in the pan drippings!!! When making the sauce I use tomato puree not sauce and I never simmer for 10 minutes after adding chicken, maybe 5, I don't want my chicken overcooked. I double the sauce and marinade recipes and triple to quadruple the amount of chicken because I make this for at least 8 adult and teens. My family loves this and there are never leftovers! (I don't need as much sauce because I don't use it on all the chicken. For the faint of heart who cannot take the heat in this recipe I pull their chicken before adding to the sauce. I quickly rinse the marinade off their chicken and stir it into some sour cream. Then I add a dab of the sauce and tomato puree for color and voila, a milder version is created alongside the spicy version. The flavor of the marinade permeates inside the chicken, so they still get a flavorful meal.)

This recipe is great with a few changes. I added only one teaspoon salt in the final cream sauce, no salt to the yogurt sauce. Following the chicken cook time made the chicken a litlle overcooked. I broiled on top rack at 450F 5 minutes on each side and chicken was done so the 10 minutes simmering overcooked it (a little dry). Next time I'll broil 3 min. per side, or simmer less than 10 minutes.  I served it with Gobi Aloo.....delicious meal!

This was superb! I am not a very experienced cook so I wasn't sure I could make this work, but it was not that hard to do and it was absolutely delicious! 

As reviewers recommended, I did cut the salt to 1 tsp each time. Next time I will cut it even more. I substituted some powdered ginger for the ginger root, and some red pepper flakes for the jalapeno.

This was fun to make and delicious to eat. I coupled it with basmati rice and wham it was off the hook. I did take everyones advice on the salt especially since I do typically use salt to cook. I did put one teaspoon in the salt and it was perfect. Easy too. This spanish girl can cook indian food. My house smelled like the Bombay restaurant.

The recipe was really delicious, but only AFTER I reduced the salt to less than 1 tsp. Before that, it was nearly inedible.

I also discovered that if I made extra chicken and grilled it all at once, I could freeze the additional chicken to make later. Wow was that handy!

This recipe was VERY good! The only thing is that I cut the salt to half of what the recipe called for, and it was still TOO salty!  I added some garam masala, curry powder, and tandoori masala to the sauce, and next time I will NOT add the cinnamon to the chicken.. The taste was too strong and I think it would taste better without it.. Thanks!

This is the second time I've made this.  Like others say, lose the salt.  I didn't skewer the meat.  I grilled it on a cast iron grill pan.  Didn't cook the chicken through and tossed it in 10 minutes into the sauce simmering.  I served it over a mix of jasmine and brown rice because it's what I had.  Topped it with a pinch of the chopped cilantro.  Raar.  Yummy.

I used fat free yogurt and light coconut milk instead of the heavy cream. I couldn't bring myself to add cinnamon to the yogurt mix and I didn't use any salt at all. I put the chicken breasts in the yogurt mix this morning so they were marinading in it for about 8 hours. I also cooked the chicken breasts under the broiler and cubed them after. This was a good meal that my husband has asked for again and even my picky daughter ate it all. Thanks

I am not very familiar with Indian food at all so this was all new.  We enjoyed it but I'm not sure I'll make it again. Interesting combination of spices, I also left out all added salt.  My 8 year old loved it!

Very tasty.  Followed other reviewers and lessened salt and cumin by more than half.  Used 4 chicken breasts (adjusted marinade accordingly) and doubled the sauce. Omited cayenne pepper and used chili powder instead.  I searched other chicken tikka masala recipes and this one was by far the simplest one to make.  I did feel that it was lacking something in the overall flavor I expected...but it was still very good.

Cut the salt to less than half what the recipe calls for.  I substituted lime for the lemon.  Incredible recipe!

Very delicious. My husband and I eat this at Indian Restaurants all the time. Also, be careful about adding the jalapeno, I added what the recipe said and it was VERY spicey.

I can't imagine giving this just 5 stars!  One of the best recipes I've tried from this site.  I wouldn't change a thing, except the amount of salt used...followed the rest of the measurements and directions to a T and received RAVE reviews from everyone at the table!

This recipe turned out really nice, but some how the flavor just did not agree with me or my family. It was spicy, but not too bad, and I did cut down on the salt, so that was ok. The spices were an interesting combination, I guess I am just not used to Indian food, and that type of flavor. I served it over rice, with asperagus on the side. I have not decided if I will make this again.

Very good recipe. Smells great. Way too salty, however, if you follow the recipe. I would cut the salt in half. I later also discovered that there already was salt in the canned tomato sauce that I was using... something you might want to check...

WAY TOO much salt. I reduced it by 1/4 and it should have be by 1/2.  I highly recommend 2 tsp in the marinade and 1 1/2 tsp in the sauce.  You can always add more, but you can't take it out, right?  Otherwise, we followed the recipe as was written and topped with the cilantro rather than garnished.  Mmmmmmmmm.

This recipe is even better than the Chicken Tikka that I used to eat in Houston restaurants. YUUUUUM. To die for dish! Worth every effort. The marinade makes the chicken slice like butter.

I loved it the first time I tried it. Perfect for when having guests over. If you can't find fresn cilantro for garnish, try chives. Doesn't matter, really. The dish is awesome!

Excellent!  I made this for my family and they loved it.  I reduced the salt to taste, and added only 1/2 a cup of cream to make it a little healthier.  The spice had multiple layers and was just warm enough to give it a nice little kick, but not too hot to send you running for a glass of milk.  I made this with the basmati rice recipe and I will definitely make this again!

Never made OR had any kind of Indian food, so nothing to compare to....but this was fantastic!  So different from anything I've ever had, and a great blend of flavors!!  I followed a couple of reviewers and cut down on the salt...also, because I was afraid it would be too spicy (for everyone else in my family except me, of course), I cut the cayenne in half and only used a half of a jalapeno in the sauce.  I used half and half instead of cream, and since I don't know the difference, it was still great.  My four year old even loved this!  Made it, as another reviewer suggested, with the Jeera rice, and it was perfect with it.  The only thing I'd do different is possibly marinate chicken tenders and grill them without cutting them first...just to save the skewers step.  I had a hard time turning them on the grill (half the cubes would turn, the other half stayed put), I just think it would have made it a tiny bit easier, without losing much of the flavor.  Great recipe, thanks!!

I love this recipe!  I always make it with half the chicken breast (2) so that it has more sauce.  Also, beware of the salt in this recipe.  I was lucky enough to read a review before I made it and just used salt to taste.  I usually make it with fat-free half and half.  It is still really good this way, but (unfortunately) way better with heavy whipping cream.

Good recipe! As suggested, I doubled the amount of sauce, which I'm glad I did -- but in the end there was too much sauce for the amount of chicken. Next time I will double the sauce and use 4 (rather than 3) chicken breasts. I found that the sauce tasted even better as leftovers the next day. If you can, make the sauce a few hours or a day in advance, store it in the refrigerator, and heat it up when you're making the chicken. Finally, my boyfriend likekd it but felt it wasn't exactly right; he suggested using red pepper flakes and garam masala or turmeric next time.

Also, I used the broil function on my toaster oven to make the chicken, and it turned out great.

How funny -- I found this recipe a month or so ago, after I didn't get to my favorite Indian restaurant in NYC for my Tikka Masala fix.  I made it, and we *loved* it!  I joined today, because I wanted to print it to make it again, and I thought, "SOMEONE needs to comment that there is *way too much salt* in this recipe!"  Imagine the chuckle I got to read 118 reviews that said to cut the salt :)

Yummy leftovers (if it's possible to have leftovers with this fabulous recipe):  eat cold in a tortilla or pita or piece of naan with plain yogurt (and a little rice, if you want).  It's FABULOUS!

(4 stars because of the salt issue, and because in every restaurant I've had this in, it had lots of extra sauce -- I'll double it next time)

I had a nice flavor was simple enough to make but it turned out far to spicy, even following the recipe and it does not have a lot of sauce (which I am a fan off) it is wonderful if you cut the spices in half and then add what you want later.

We loved this recipe!  The tomatoe cream sauce is outrageously delicious.  I cut the salt to about 1/4 suggested, and used some sour cream in the marinade, as I only had 6 oz yogurt.  We grilled the chicken outdoors, nice flavor.  I served over jasmine rice with peas.  The finished dish has some heat, not for the faint of heart.  A keeper!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I liked this, but it was probably a little strange for me.  I would have never thought to have chicken and the sweet flavor of cinnimon together.  We also made this with vanilla yogurt because I don't like plain yogurt even mixed with other things.

This was extremely salty!  We cut back on the salt in the marinade and I wish I had cut back on the salt in the sauce.  So salty, we couldn't eat it.  If we're brave we'll try it again and salt to taste.

THIS RECIPE WAS AWESOME -- I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF ADDING TUMERIC, CUMIN, CAYENNE PEPPER & PAPRIKA TO THE MIX, TOO, AND COULDN'T FIND ALL THE PASTES THAT THE RECIPE CALLED FOR, SO I JUST CHOPPED UP GARLIC, CUBANELLE PEPPERS, JALAPENO PEPPERS, ETC. MYSELF -- EVEN MY HUBBY WAS HAPPY, AND HE IS MY TOUGHEST CRITIC!

Wonderful flavors!  I cooked the chicken on the stove top instead of grilling and added onions and golden raisons.  Also used less salt.  I will definitly make this again.

Definetly go light on the salt, and I would say a little lighter on the paprika too, otherwise gets too over powering.  But the chicken came out amazingly tender, it would have been fantastic just by itself as well.

I only gave this recipe three stars because it took a lot of adjusting. I brought the salt down to 1 teaspoon each for the sauce and marinade. In addition I halved the cayenne and cumin because I found it was too hot. Otherwise this is great with naan bread. I tend to cut back on the chicken because it's expensive but that means there's plenty of sauce.

Okay first of all THIS IN ONE OF THE EASIEST INDIAN recipes ever - I STONGLY RECOMMEND NOT USING ANY SALT IN THE SAUCE -ONLY IN THE MARINADE...I HAD TO START OVER AND SINCE I ALREADY MARINADED MY CHICKEN HAD TO REMAKE THE SAUSE MINUS THE SALT ! IF YOU WANT IT LESS SPICY CUT DOWN ON THE CUMIN OTHERWISE -YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

SO DELICIOUS!  Mmmmmm!  Thank you for the recipe!  It doesn't fail, even without the chicken (vegetarian style).  To make less spicy, use less (meaning at least half for wusses like me) of the cumin, pepper and cayenne pepper.

I made several changes to this recipe. However, I'd like to thank the author for posting a great base recipe! This was really delicious. We cut down the salt to 1/2 tsp in the yogurt marinade, and added a tsp. of curry powder. Didn't have fresh ginger on hand so we used ginger powder. Also omitted the lemon juice. Instead of tomato sauce, we went for simple crushed tomatoes in a can, and I added some long beans and eggplant cubes to the simmering sauce. You have to try this recipe, it's now a favourite in this household!

My husband and I thought this was very good.  A little too "spicy" according to our kids.  Served with peas (good mixed in with the sauce) and Roti bread (from this site).  Ended our Indian meal with some Chai tea and Kulfi (also from this site).

I love Indian food and this was awesome.  Way too much salt - will need to reduce it next time and yes it would have  been better with double the sauce

Made this for my husband's birthday and we absolutely loved it except for, like the others say, WAY TOO MUCH SALT.  And I love salt.  Next time I will cut the salt in half and see how to adjust it from there.  We enjoy spicy food so this was perfect for us.  The only thing I changed was I used lamb for the occasion.  This just became a regular meal for us.

This recipe is AWSOME! Just made a few changes. I used just a pinch of Cayanne and 1 tsp TOTAL of salt. Otherwise it's fantastic.

I followed suggestions and used only 2 tsp salt (definitely doesn't need more than that).  I also followed suggestions and decreased heat, but thought the full amount of cayenne and jalapanos was warranted.  Very delicious, will make again.

this was amazing.  I have been looking for a recipe for masala that uses readily available ingredients and still tastes authentic and this is the one.  The only thing I would change next time is:  double the amount of chicken (but not marinade there was tons) and triple or quadrulple the sauce.  we had no leftovers and this was a sad thing.  Oh and I only added about 1T salt TOTAL.  I think the salt amounts are probably wrong.  that's alot of salt

This turned out fairly well, though a bit spicier than I'm used to for chicken tikka masala.  And the spiciness was different in flavor than usual tikka masala -- the jalapeno gave it more of a Mexican feel than I'd expected.  All the same, I liked it.
Incidentally, I like thicker sauces and avoid fat so I left out the cream and everything turned out fine.

This is only my opinion but it is way to spicy and it is like still burning and I ate it 3 hours ago.  Cut back on all the pepper and it would be amazing though Seriously it was to spicy other than that it was awesome.

Excellent recipe. In addition to using minimal salt, I added diced peppers and onions to the sauce.  Does anyone know if  this will freeze well?

This recipe is awesome!  I wish I would have read the reviews first, then I would have known the recipe is too salty (its only flaw).  I would absolutely go with less salt (1 tsp should do it).  It doesn't quite taste authentic, but it is still a really great recipe.  I'm pretty sensitive to spicyness, so I used just a little cayenne and diced half of a serrano pepper.  I decided to add a little more once a tasted the sauce.  Serranos carry more bang for the buck, so if you really like spicy, try replacing these peppers instead.  Cheers!!

Wonderful Recipe and very easy to make.  I do agree that it is a trifle too hot, so next time I make it, I will cut down on the cayenne and jalepenos. But still a terrific recipe!

My family loved this recipe. Was worried about the amount of salt, but took a change and followed the recipe for the marinade. I think the salt acted as a brine, the chicken was very tender.  However, I did reduced the salt in sauce to taste.   Will make this again and again.  This is an easy recipe compared to other Tikka Masla recipes!   Thank you Yakuta.

I was overjoyed to find this recipe here as I have searched a lot of other sites. This recipe is good, but I prefer a little sweet to balance out the spicy.  Adding coconut milk as a previous reviewer suggested is a great idea and I will try this again.  I might put a little less cumin as well as I found it to be overpowering.
