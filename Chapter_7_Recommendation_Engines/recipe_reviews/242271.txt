My Variations, which came out great:
-- 1 can (12.5 oz) chicken (instead of rotisserie chicken)
-- also added shredded radish (1 large)  & chopped water chestnuts (3/4 of 8oz can) to chicken mixture.
-- Plus sprinkled in: dry mustard, garlic powder (no salt as that will come from the soy sauce), and paprika. [note: add red pepper here if you don't have a spicy Asian-style salad dressing*], toasted black/white sesame seeds, and celery seeds. Then did final mix.

-- For toppings: sprinkle more of the sesame seeds, and some chopped /roasted peanuts or hazel nuts.

*I didn't have a bottle of Asian-style dressing sitting around, so I made my own: low sodium soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, & chili oil.

Will make again. Thanks!

We loved this recipe. I served it as a side to soup.  It is quick and easy to make. I would say it is mistake proof.  The only change I made was adding in some green onion, we like a lot of flavor in this family.

This recipe is great for using up that leftover chicken and seldom used store bought Asian dressing.  I changed nothing as I believe one cannot review a recipe if one doesn't follow the recipe and I am glad I didn't.  It was perfect and I will make again and also try adding the green onions as we have an enormous crop of them every year.

I loved this! Light, but very filling! The only problem I had was my own doing, I forgot the red pepper flakes! I bet that makes them even better. This will be a go to low carb meal in my house!

Pretty tasty. I used Soy Braised Chicken (on the AR website) instead of the deli-bought version. I also had to improvise some of the veggies, seeing that I didn't have any carrots. All-in-all pretty tasty. Serve extra sauce on the side, it's good with egg rolls or Spring rolls too. Yum! Thank you for the recipe.
