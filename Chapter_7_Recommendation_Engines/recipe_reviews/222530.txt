I made a half-recipe of this, and it needs minor tweaks. I cooked on HI (not LO) for 2 hrs, and it still needed a little more.  The full recipe is huge and would probably take 3-4 hours on HI.  The sauce was a bit too soupy - next time I will cut the milk completely, and just add 2 Tbs of cream for the half recipe (or 1/4 cup for the full recipe), as cream  thickens better. This has a really good flavor, though.  I will make it again.

I used one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of potato. I did not use the sour cream, and lessoned the milk after reading the reviews. 3 hours on high! My kids loved it and I will be making again.

I too had to let it cook longer and on high watching to not scorch it. I added 3/4 of a cup milk instead of a full cup but it turned very good and not runny at all, and it was easy to make. I was limited on time so it worked out for me.  It got good reviews from everyone at the pitch in.   only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is due to 2 cans of soup is not the healthiest way to eat. MY OPINION ONLY.

I doubled this recipe for a crowd and it was a big hit.  However, I did not use the crackers and I did cook this on HIGH for 4-5 hrs stirring occasionally.  I would make it again.

I made this following the recipe exactly as written. The flavor was good but it turned out way too soupy. If I try this again I will probably leave out the milk entirely.

A big hit with my family - I used my 9x13 crock pot, added a cup of fried bacon pieces, reduced the milk to 1/2 cup, and they cleaned it up!  Thank you for the great recipe!!

This recipe was super easy and quick. It was for a potluck dinner and I received several compliments on how good it tasted. Make sure you stir it regularly!

2nd time Iâ€™ve made this. Used garlic powder and Bacon and Cheddar cheese flavored crackers. Going for the loaded baked potato taste. Bringing to a friend tonight.

Very good and easy for a carry in!  Everyone loved this dish.  I would definitely continue to use a slow cooker liner since there is so much cheese and it is gooey.  I did add more potatoes than called for because it is soupy.  Next time, I will cut soup and sour cream in half and add it if needed as it cooks.  I did cook it on High for 2 hours after I had thawed the potatoes in the microwave to 'kick start' the warmth.   Have made this twice in a week for carry in and holiday party.  Both times, it was a hit!

I don't know what your all talking about - I made it as directed, and it was freaking awesome!!! The cheesy crackers sounded kind of weird, so I left them out - and cooked for 4 hours on high, but everyone was blown away - Next time I am going to throw some hame in it and see how that turns out!

This was such a fabulous dish my whole family raved about it.
Suggest a slight liquid reduction.

As written, it is an easy dish to make for a crowd and tastes okay.  I'm not a fan of cream soups, so on next go-around, I used Nacho Cheese Soup.  Gives the dish a bit more pizzazz regarding flavor.  Doesn't really save on calories, salt or carbs, but I think it's a better and cheesier taste.
