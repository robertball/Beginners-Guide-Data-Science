I don't like tweeking recipes but I did on this one and it turn out really good. I added italian seasoning, garlic powder, and about 3 ozs of sour cream to the cream cheese and mixed it and followed the recipe to the "T" for the rest of it. Excellent!!! Will make again but I will double.

This is a good recipe. I usually use ricotta chesse in this recipe but I decided to use cream cheese instead. The cream cheese seemed to make the recipe too rich. I think I'll go back to the ricotta cheese.

I like to blend dried basil and oregano in with the cream cheese to give this dip extra flavor.

After reading other reviews, I was torn between whether to mix the cream cheese and pizza sauce in a blender or layer.  At first I decided to follow the recipe exactly, but I was afraid that people would bite into nothing but pizza sauce.  I removed the combo and placed in a blender and got a pretty tasty sauce.  I added the ingredients on top.  The biggest recommendation that I have is to not completely cover with mozzarella cheese...just lighly sprinkle instead.  This is because once the cheese cooled, it formed a hard layer on top that was hard to dip.  As much as i love cheese it's best to keep it spread out where it doesn't clump together.  I baked garlic bread and sliced into cubes for dipping, which was really tasty.

This was VERY good (but not to nice to look at)!  I halved the recipe, eliminated the olives, used onion powder in place of minced onion.  Since I was making this as an after school snack I decided to heat in the microwave on high for 4 minutes.  It was so gooey and stringy!  The only thing I noticed was it got cold fast and got very thick.  I reheated a few times, but it didn't matter as it disappeared fast!! I served it with focaccia wedges.

This dip was VERY good and it was so simple to make.  I made it for a party and a week later was asked to bring it to another party.  It's really yummy.  I served it with tortilla chips

This is a family favorite of ours.  It can be gobbled down in about 2 mintues.  My niece and nephew always ask for this as an appetizer.  We love using fritos scoops for the dip.

I used reduced fat cream cheese, homemade marinara sauce I'd defrosted from my freezer (The Best Marinara Sauce, which is also from this site), I doubled the pepperoni and I used Tillamook's italian cheese blend. This was a quick dip I could mix up and throw in my mini-crockpot before our morning errands and have it be done right as my boys were getting hungry. They loved having dip-able pizza and I liked it because it used on hand pantry ingredients. I served it with day old baguettes I bought at Fred Meyer from the discount rack for super cheap.

Made this recipe for a wine get together we had with a bunch of our chef friends.  And they all LOVED it!!  I added italian seasoning and some garlic powder to the cream cheese.  I left out the olives(hate em) and used turkey pepperoni that I had bought to try(can't tell the difference).  Sprinkled a little parmasaen cheese on top and served with crostini.  I was VERY glad I doubled it.  Super easy, I will be making this at every party we have now.  Thanks for the recipe!

This totally gets five stars from me.  My brother's girlfriend brought this to my parents' place on Mother's Day.  Ooooohhhh, so good!  She served it with Fritos Scoops and those little Tostitos bite-size bowls.  Perfect.  This will be requested for years to come.  Highly recommend this one!

It comes out better if you put pepperoni slices ON TOP of the cheese so the cheese doesn't get brown & crusty.  Add in other toppings as you like them on top of the sauce.....sausage, mushrooms, peppers, etc.  I serve with Fritos Scoops - they hold up well to the cheese.  ALWAYS a hit at parties!

What a fantastic dip.  We doubled the recipe and served before Christmas dinner.  A big hit with everyone.  I would use a glass pie plate so the dip can be reheated in the microwave.  One jar of sauce will easily cover two packages of cream cheese.  I also tossed in a handful of yellow cheddar cheese for a little color.  This is a great recipe and for sure a keeper.  Thanks.

This was really yummy! The pizza sauce gets a little watery after heating. I microwaved the pepperoni for a few minutes before incorporating into the dip (cut down on grease). I started this dish in the oven and finished it in the microwave.

Good overall taste, but the Mozzarella on top coagulated into an almost spoon-bending mass on top of the dip. I stirred the leftovers together and will see if that helps when DH warms it up for snacks. I also think that the ratio of pizza sauce to cream cheese is off. Next time I will either double the cream cheese or half the pizza sauce (depending on the size crowd I'm making it for.) Overall, good basic recipe to keep in my bag of tricks for parties.

I went with the basics of this recipe and modified it slightly according to reviews and my own preferences.  I added italian seasonings, oregano, and fennel seed to the cream cheese; used 1/2 can of sauce and 1/2 can drained diced italian tomatos, and no olives.  It was a hit!  Everyone liked  the soft baguette bread better than the crunchier/toasted bagettes.  Either way, I have no dip or bread left!

I made this for years! Always a hit!! I buy pizza crust, then brush it with butter. Then I add Parmesian cheese & garlic powder. Bake at 400 degrees aprox. 10 minutes. Cut into bite size strips & dip away!! I always double this recipe for a party,etc.

Brought it to a dinner party, the dip was called "lasagna over toast" it was a total hit. I saw another similar, more complicated recipe, and decided to do this one instead; I was definitely not sorry, the dish was cleaned. I did the recipe exactly as stated except I mixed the cream cheese and pizza sauce.

I had my husband make this for a group meeting. This recipe was easy enough for him and we brought 2 9X9 pans, untasted, to the group hoping it was edible. This was delicious and almost gone by the end of the night. We brought Simply Social crackers and plain garlic bread to dip. We didn't have pepperoni sausage on hand so we just sliced chicken sausage like sliced pepperoni and put them on the very top like a pizza. We didn't have any black olives.

Tried this recipe twice during Christmas holidays.  It was very well received both times.  Appeals to all age groups.  I used onions, green peppers and pepperoni.  Olives and mushrooms are not favorites of some of my guests. Thanks for an easy recipe.

Very good and simple!  I put this in the microwave for 4 minutes as suggested by someone else because I took this for my high school students and didn't have an oven.  They loved it and ate it right up.

This dip is so good!  I mixed in about 1 cup of sour cream with the pizza sauce, and then I added finely chopped green pepper, mushrooms and black olives.  I also sprinkled on some Mrs. Dash extra spicy seasoning and it gave it extra flavor.  I didn't add the pepperoni or the onion, but I think next time I'll try it with some onion.

To Stir or Not to Stir:  I've made this twice now.  The first time I did not stir the pizza sauce and cream cheese and I loved it.  Boyfriend liked it until the last bite when he got a glob of cream cheese without much sauce.  He thinks he doesn't like cream cheese, so if he can identify it, then he says yuck (he has zero idea of how much cream cheese he eats).  The second time I mixed a little of the pizza sauce into the cream cheese.  While I liked it slightly better NOT mixed together, he LOVED it the second time.  He had no idea it contained cream cheese or that it was the same dip as the first time.  Each time I used homemade pizza sauce and added cheddar and parmesan that I had hanging around.

I tweaked this recipe a bit. I added some Italian seasoning, garlic powder, a little bit of onion powder, a couple shakes of the Crushed Red Pepper Flakes and about 3 1/2 tbl of sour cream to the cream cheese. Came out amazing. Thank you for sharing

Used homemade pizza sauce. This was very good for using a little of this and that for a late snack. Just right size for using toaster oven and not the big oven. Great with tortilla chips. Plan to use toasted baguette bread next time. Hubby suggested Italian sausage next time since is a big fan of it.

This was great!  I needed a dip recipe in a pinch, and this was super easy to put together.  Our guests don't eat pork, so I used turkey sausage instead, and it tasted just fine.  We also skipped the olives, but I think it would be yummy with them as well.  I did add garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the cream cheese as others suggested, and I think it helped give the dip a little more flavor.  Will definitely make again!

In a word, YUMMY!  I don't layer mine, just mix it all together...no problem with cheese getting hard on the top as it cools...not as pretty as layered but the taste is the same.

I'm just learning to cook, and this is the first thing I've ever really made on my own.  It was SO delicious and SO easy to make.  I brought it to an event at my boyfriend's parents, and the entire family loved it! This has become my signature dish that they ask me to bring every time now! I made a few changes...I nixed the olives, and used onion powder instead of chopped onions.  I also added a pinch of oregano and basil for that authentic pizza taste! I served with pita bread slices and it's just like eating pizza!

I made this recipe for a Super Bowl party.  There were alot of other dips served at the party, but this dip got the most rave reviews.  I had several guests ask me for the recipe.  My husband is not a fan of black olives, so I simply omitted them.  I also used turkey pepperoni to save on the fat content.  It was delicious!  Next time I will double the recipe as this dish went really fast.

This was great!  Using a salty chip is the best choice for dipping-I used Fritos scoops.  I topped the dip with a bunch of thinly sliced fresh veggies that I had on hand-red onion, peppers, etc.  It went fast in a group of picky eaters!

This was a decent base recipe. First and foremost as some reviewers have said, the cheese will solidify and so I highly suggest mixing it in and then sprinkling grated Parmesan cheese over it all. This also needs salt and some seasonings.

pretty bland even though I used red pepper flakes. Don't like how the cream cheese looks when melted and shredded cheese became a big blob.

This appetizer was great and really easy to make! I modified it a bit by adding Italian seasoning, green pepper, provolone and parmesan cheeses. I didn't use any onion or olives. I will definitely make this  again.

Outstanding!! It didn't last long. Recommend making a bigger pan for a larger party.

I was looking for something different and pretty. This was both. I sprinkled half the pepperoni on before the mozzarella and then the other on top which made it look like a pizza. But it didn't taste all that great. The kids didn't eat it, and the husband ate it mostly trying to figure out if he liked it or not. I ate a couple bites, but wasn't thrilled. Pretty much the whole thing was wasted :-(

This dip is delicious! I don't like olives so I left them out. Instead I used mushrooms and green peppers. You can really add anything that you like on a pizza.

I'm giving this five stars because all my children really liked it. :) Very rare!!! My husband said it was pretty good and I thought it was alright as well. Tastes just like pizza! We served it with crunchy bread sticks...and tried it with tortilla chips, but the bread sticks really made the difference IMHO. Next time, I'll experiment more and maybe even add some browned sausage to the mix. Thanks!!!!

This disappeared so quickly it was amazing!  I served it with toasted baguette slices and there was barely any left when I went back to get 2nds.  

Husband said it was a total 5 star.  Next time I think I'll add some red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.

Absolutely delicious! I made this for a small casual party and it was a big hit. Used green peppers and onion as the toppings instead of sausage and served with a sliced baguette. It was devoured!

Excellent recipe..been making it for a long time.  I like to add sour cream to the cream cheese mixture, 1 tsp of oregano and 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, which gives it a little kick.  Great with chips and toasted baguette slices.

My sister made this for Super Bowl Sunday and it is indeed delicious.  She eliminated the onions and olives due to the kids not liking them but it was still awesome.  I will add the onions and olives back in when I make it.  So quick and easy!

took this to a party where there were a bunch of health nuts, and every single one of them raved about this dish! not the healthiest, but boy is it good with the big fritos! It was gone before any other appetizer. Will be making this again, most likely for superbowl!

I rated this a 4 star and not a 5 star because my husband and myself werent overly impressed by this recipe, it was just ok to us. However, I made it for my husband's birthday and all of my guests all loved it and commented on how unique and good it was. My sis in law even called the next day to get the reciepe and made it for her church group the following night. She said the dip was completely gone with in the first few minutes that people arrived. I will probably make this again.

I got this recipe from a friend's mom. It is so good!! Just like pizza. We added about a half a can of articokes and used sockeroni pasta sauce. It is amazing with homemade pita chips (cut pitas into little triangles and brush with butter. Sprinkle with salt and bake about 15 min until slightly crispy!! yum!)

We love this recipe...so easy!  My nephews always consume this entire dip with Fritos.  I also sometimes add Italian seasoning to the cream cheese for a little extra flavor, but it's great without it too This is a great make ahead appetizer.  You can make ahead of time and just pop it in the oven when you're ready.  A favorite in our family!!!
