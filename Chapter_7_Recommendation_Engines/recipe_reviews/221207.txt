This ice cream is awesome! The only difference was I used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half, and it was still awesome!  So delicious! I definitely will be making this again real soon!

I’m always apprehensive about eating raw eggs, so I cooked the eggs with the sugar and ½ cup of light cream in a double boiler, stirring constantly with a whisk until the mixture achieved 160°.  Granted, this adds an extra 10 minutes to the recipe, but I’d rather be safe than sorry.   Should you choose to do this, be sure you are constantly stirring so you don’t end up with scrambled eggs, and thoroughly chill the mixture before adding the rest of the ingredients and adding it into the ice cream maker.  I used previously made praline pecans so the salt was eliminated, and I replaced one cup of light cream with one cup of heavy cream for a creamier texture.  I also used more than a drop of maple flavoring because I love maple flavor.  This was excellent.  You’ll be licking the beater, trust me.  Added note:  This ice cream didn't last 24 hours in this house.

This is really good ice cream. It was fast & simple to make and the instructions are easy to follow. I made two modifications for my own taste, those being reducing the sugar to a half cup, and using 2 cups heavy cream and one cup half & half. The recipe yielded 3 pints. Next time I make it, I'm going to make more candied nuts. Not for the ice cream, but so I can eat 'em up!!

This ice cream tastes like the very best butter pecan ice cream you can find. I sometimes replace part of the half and half with whipping cream, because it makes a richer and smoother ice cream. Otherwise, I follow the recipe.

I thought it was good.  Had a little bit of an after taste to it but not bad.
I would make this one again.

Tried this and it was wonderful! Substituted out 1 cup of the half and half for a cup of heavy whipping cream to make it a little richer. Absolutely great!

I had a quart of heavy cream I needed to use up so I increased the servings to 12 and adjusted the recipe.  I used all heavy cream and ommitted the salt because my mom is funny about sweet and salty together.  it came out great!  Best tasting icecream ever!

My rating is based on what I was told about it’s quality, you see, I made it for an ice cream contest but because I was the MC I never got around to tasting it.  Five recipes were entered and 2’of the competitors told me mine was excellent. Except for the Maple Extract, I used Almond.  Be prepared to 2X or 3X the recipe—I wasn’t.

Seriously amazing. I didn't have any maple extract so I didn't use it. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly. I'm going to
