YUMMM..... One alteration; since the refried bean selection was more of a puree or paste, I subbed one can of refried with a can of black beans.  I lean towards the spicy side but the flavor was so good I didn't bother to add hot sauce or jalapenos as I originally thought I might.  Also didn't bother with the cheese, it's that good.  Those who shy away from spicy (my wife) can add a dollop of sour cream.

This is quite close to how I make Tortilla Soup and it's great.  The beans make the soup thick and filling and the spiciness is tangy and warm.

I made this recipe as written with a couple of exceptions. Being we prefer a soupier soup we followed one reviewers suggestion and double the amount of chicken broth. I cut the chicken breasts into bite sized pieces prior to cooking with the onions. Later I skipped the shredding of the chicken. I used Old El Paso brand hot & spicy taco seasoning. Instead of picante sauce I used a medium heat locally made salsa. Picante and salsa are made with the same ingredients with salsa being a little chunkier. I then cooked the ingredients for 4 hours on low in the slow cooker. After one taste my wife commented that this is now one of her favorite soups. This soup had so much flavor that we did not feel the need for topping with cheese. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! I made it on the stovetop instead of crock pot.  Also threw in two uncooked chicken breasts and brought it up to boil then simmer for 1 1/2 hours.  The enchilada sauce is what makes this recipe.  I used Gebhardt,  my favorite.  Didn't use water, used a quart of homemade chicken stock I had on hand.  
Great recipe, thanks.

As I began putting the listed ingredients in the pot, I felt the ratio of refried beans and corn was a bit much.  One can of each is plenty.  I didn't have Picante sauce on hand, so I substituted it with a can of Rotel.  I also added one can of rinsed pinto beans to replace the one can of refrieds I left out.  It would have been too pastie and overpowering otherwise.  This is super easy. You can add spices to your liking.  Overall, it was good with minor changes.

I cut up chicken breasts and put them in the slow cooker instead of cooking them on the stove. Saved lots of time. Even my husband liked it and he claims to not like refried beans. I ate mine without cheese and it was good. It would be good with tortilla chips dipped in or crumbled on top.

Had to give this one a 5. I did sub one can of black beans for a can of refried. It was a little in the spicy side for my 7 year old but added some sour cream to hers and she loved it! Anything I can get this kid to eat deserves a 5

I made this exactly as it is written and it was great! My 14 year old son ate 3 bowls so it is a big hit! My daughters and friends came home from college and they ate the entire pot! The second time I made it I added Rotel instead of salsa and we liked it even better. I am on Weight Watchers and it is only 6 points per serving so I was excited about this too. A great recipe!

I made this recipe as is and thought it was good but for my tastes it needed a little more pizzazz. I kicked it up with more salt, oregano and a can of diced spicy ortega chili's which made it a winner. Then I had lime wedges and white corn tortilla chips for the garnish sooo good.

This soup was awesome!  I used one can of refried pinto beans and one can on refried black beans and followed the recipe exactly, besides that.  I used frozen chicken breast, and I think I would prefer to use fresh, next time. I also think it would be better if the chicken is seasoned as it is sautéed. I also would have preferred a little more spice to the soup. With those few tweaks, this soup will be a 5 star!

This is a great tasting soup! My family loved it. The changes I made were that I used chicken taco seasoning, just one can of corn instead of two, and I used one can of refried beans and one can of black beans (rinsed and drained). This recipe is a keeper and I will make it often. It's perfect for the cooler months.

The received beans gave the soups broth a gritty texture. It was really thick and more like a chili than a soup. Did not like at all

Followed the recipe  but I cooked my chicken in the pressure cooker first. When meat was done, I added all the other ingredients. Added more chicken broth to thin out for more soup. Also added  more picante sauce to taste. Very delicious!!

I love making this dish and have done it a bunch of times now!
I cook it all in a römerkopf in the oven instead of a slowcooker, and it gives great results anyway!
I always cook the chicken in something bigger than cubes, since it makes it easier to pull it apart later in the process.

This was delicious! One suggestion: try the Chipotle taco seasoning packet instead of the original. Gives it a wonderful, smoky flavor. Will make this again.

My husband and I LOVE this soup. I make it all the time. It was especially great during pregnancy when I needed to load up on protein. It makes a ton, so it is perfect to make when having friends over or when you want to have leftovers during the week. Like a lot of other people, I sub one can of black beans for one of the cans of refried beans to thin it out a bit.

I ended up doubling the chicken broth and picante sauce to make it a more soupy consistency. The end result was very good and I will make it again.

This is better than my old favorite chicken tortilla soup! So good! I traded refried beans with garbanzo and pinto beans, increased the broth and picante, and added cumin, cayenne, and fresh jalepnos and cilantro. Restaurant quality! Thanks for the recipe! I can't wait to make it again!

A little labor intensive with fishing out all the chicken and shredding it, but a very tasty dish.

This was an amazing tortilla soup.  One of the best I have ever tried. Used my own home mixed taco seasoning so I could adjust everything to taste.

Was a bit thick for my liking (more like a dip and not like a soup) so I added 2.5 additional cups of chicken broth. I also found it a bit bland so I added the juice of 2 limes, a large handful of chopped cilantro and a small can of "green mexican sauce". (sort of like enchilada sauce). Used jarred salsa instead of picante sauce and used 1 tsp fresh chopped garlic instead of powder. Next time would add peppers for more veggies. All the family liked it with my alterations!

This soup came out amazing! I followed another users tip and added an extra cup of chicken broth. Instead of pace picante I used a can of rotel with jalapeno. I also used two cans of pinto beans. The soup hit the spot on this cold day!

I followed the recipe except I used frozen corn instead of canned. I served it over brown jasmine rice. Next time I am going to try it as a burrito filling. Yummy!!!

I loved this recipe! I would advise adding more broth, though. Also, I used canned fiesta/mexicorn instead of regular corn! So easy and tasted great.

This is not spicy at all. I add meat, hot pepper sauce,(lots!), and some seasonings to add some heat to this dish. Other than that this is a fantastic base for a tortilla soup. I would recommend this and spice it up to taste.

Other than cutting the recipe in half and using frozen corn instead of canned, I followed the recipe exactly.  After seeing the finished product, I couldn't resist throwing in a can of black beans...it just needed more color.  After tasting the finished product, I had to add a can of green chilies.  Perhaps jalapeno flavored refried beans would have been better than regular.  It is excellent soup now!

I generally followed the recipe except, I added a can of diced tomatoes (with chilies). I think the tomatoes add a lot.  As others suggested, I used one can of refried beans and one can of black beans (rather than 2 cans of refried).  I also added a good dash of cumin, rather than the taco seasoning.

Finally, for the chicken, I bought a rotisserie chicken from the store and shredded it. 

As for tortillas, I gave people a choice between crumbled store-bought tortilla chips and oven-warmed soft tortillas for dipping/soaking.

As a side we had a fresh green salad with lettuce, cucumber,  tomato wedges and avocado.  I squirted with fresh lemon, dashed with oil and added a couple of squirts of roasted red pepper Kraft dressing. Very fresh contrast to the soup.

Rave reviews from the family!

Really good. I didn't cook the chicken before, I just threw it in the crockpot and shredded it after a few hours. I also substituted 1 can of refried beans with black beans and only used 1 can of corn, but that's the only changes I made. Definitely a keeper.

This is an excellent recipe! I did do as others mentioned. I used 1 can refried and 1 can black for the beans. My husband is a very picker eater and I don't really like chicken taco soup. We both keep wanting this soup/stew! it is very very very good, it is like a stew, thick and hearty and full of flavor.  Without all the time in the kitchen! Excellent!

This was a quick easy recipe for the crock pot. I substituted black beans for the refried beans and used fire roasted corn with green and red peppers. Cutting the chicken up in about 1/2" squares and dumped it in with the onion instead of browning it first. Worked out well.

I added a can of drained black beans to add color depth, and since I didn't have refried beans on hand, I substituted pinto beans and drained them. After tasting it before putting all ingredients to the crock pot, I decided to NOT add my can of green chilies (that I add to everything Mexican). The picante sauce gave it the kick I wanted.

Very good...it's rare that I cook a new recipe and my wife requests that I make it again as soon as it's gone. This one passed that test.  I agree with others on cutting down to one can of refried beans and substituting some black beans. I used minced garlic instead of the powder.  With a little extra thickening (happened naturally leaving leftovers in the fridge overnight) it was the right consistency to make a nice and tasty tortilla chip dip. I added some Tony Chachere's seasoning and it was a good match.

It was definitely missing something so I topped with it with cheese, tortilla chips and sour cream.  It was better.  I think rice would be a good addition.

I decreased to 1 can refried beans and added 1 can black beans, drained. I served it with corn bread. It was a big hit at my family dinner. This is an excellent recipe, easy to follow, and easy to make. I highly recommend it.

Super easy! I used about half the refried beans but added some black beans and chick peas. I was worried it wouldn't thicken enough, but it did just fine! We served it w/ rice. A little cheese and sour cream made it extra good. I will definitely make this again!
