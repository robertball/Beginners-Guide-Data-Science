I grew up eating authentic boxty and this is a so-so attempt as written.  I did follow the recipe using 1 small red potato to grate and 1 small Idaho to bake.  The raw grated potato is supposed to give this some texture, so that was alright, but the result was just bland and uninteresting, IMO.  For my actual meal, I used leftover mashed potatos,  which had been cooked in salted water and mashed with butter and milk.  I had cooked extra knowing I would use the rest for Boxty.  I added 2 grated medium red potatoes, 1 cup of AP flour, 1 tsp baking soda and 3 tbs of reserved bacon drippings and enough milk to make a pourable batter.  This was then cooked in a cast iron skillet, which I had lightly greased.

These were okay, but it would be helpful to have actual measurements for the salt and pepper.  It's hard to season something like this "to taste".  I felt like I had added a LOT of salt and pepper, but they still needed more.  Also, the raw potato doesn't get cooked very well, so I might adapt the recipe next time by par-cooking the shredded potato before mixing it with the other ingredients.  Other than that, the flavor was good.  I, too, "baked" my potatoes in the microwave instead of the oven to save time.  I had to use a buttermilk substitute (milk + vinegar), so I'd like to try them with real buttermilk next time.  I served them topped with sour cream and a little shredded cheddar cheese.

I like this dish for simplicity of the potato flavor...mine was not too floury tasting at all. I baked a huge potato in the oven like the recipe said to, and I grated a large red potato, skin and all for some extra color. I did top mine with just a sprinkle of parmigiano-regianno cheese.

Made this for the recipe group this week and didn't think it was too bad! Made the first three boxties using just a dash of salt and pepper seasonings and they were okay. Those ones were good if you wanted to put toppings on them. After those three, I threw in about 1/2 tsp garlic salt, a clove of minced garlic, 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp coarse ground black pepper and some dried parsley to add a little bit of color since we were having them with with our St. Patrick's Day dinner. Pretty delish by themselves, with a dollop of sour cream or a little smear of butter.

These reminded me of the potato patties my mother made from left-over mashed potatoes when I was growing up.  Because of Keri's review about some of the grated potatoes still tasting raw, I chose to use the smaller holes on the grater.  The inside tasted soft, like mashed potatoes.  I substituted milk and vinegar for the buttermilk, and I cut the recipe in half.  I used a 1/4 cup measure to make 7 patties.  I cooked each side 5 minutes as the recipe stated.  I tried them with just butter, then with butter and honey, and finally with grated cheese.  I prefer the ones with cheese.  I did not find them to be "crispy" as the recipe stated, but they did make a pretty good lunch.

The boxty was sort of bland. I wish the batter was not so thick, because they didn't cook through very easily on the griddle. I'd like to see the recipe revamped for a thinner batter, use frozen hash browns instead of shredding your own potato, and also with some cheese in it or something (but I guess you could top it with whatever you want). Something kinda weird was that the leftover batter has a chemical reaction with the air and turns weird colors over a few hours.

Made this for Recipe group. Maybe I was expecting more. Hubby thought they tasted all right to him. First skilletfull I used 1/2 tsp each s&p, really really bland, course they are just potatoes. Added another 1/2 tsp of s&p at that point, much better. I used the powdered buttermilk, I thought they were really soupy, but they cooked up ok. Used 2 medium size potatoes for each set of potatoes. I thought they tasted pretty gummy and floury, but as I said maybe I was expecting more. They did taste better with a little sour cream, and some butter and/or cheese would be good. Some spices in there would make these really good, maybe some garlic and onion powder. Thanks for the recipe myka.

This is really great!  There is a place here in town that makes stuffed Boxty's...and they are AWESOME!  Think I will make my own variation of the stuffed version as well, so they can be a whole meal.  They also have a breakfast boxty that is stuffed with rashers (Irish bacon), bangers (sausage) and Irish cheddar.  Topped with a Hollandaise sauce...it's to die for!!!!  I'm sure I can make this at home too.

This was terrible.  The proportions are all wrong.  This recipe gives you pancakes with a little potato in them.  Do you know how much 1/2 lb of potatoes is?  ONE medium to small potato.  And then you’re going to put 1 1/2 cups of buttermilk with it?  I followed it anyway, figuring it would come together at the end.  Nope.  All wrong.  Found another recipe online that was awesome, and exactly what boxty is supposed to be.  Keep looking.

This recipe was great! Served them with sour cream as a side dish on St. Patty’s Day. Kids and adults loved them. The only modification I made (after a delicious test batch) was to add slightly less flour.
