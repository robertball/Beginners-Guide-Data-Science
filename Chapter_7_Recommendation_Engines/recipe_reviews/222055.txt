This was a healthy dish and it served the purpose as an interesting side dish, but it was somewhat lacking in flavor.  I made it exactly by the recipe.  If I make it again, I would add some Cajun seasoning  and perhaps some corn kernels to it to see if that would jazz it up a little.

This salad has so much potential.  Love the flavors, but even as a fan of cooked spinach I didn't like it in this dish.  I think I might make again but rather than using spinach add rice as a nice side dish.

This didn't come out well for me ... too many onions and too much spinach for one can of black beans. I added a mix of spices, including coriander, cumin, chili powder and jalape√±o pepper which did give it a good flavor. Definitely tasted better than in looked.

This was great. I used grape tomatoes cut in half, added brown rice and a few splashes of balsamic vinegar. Turned out great, Thank you for the share!

I thought this was great. Perfect way to use up a bag of spinach I didn't want to go bad. I added an extra clove of garlic kind of on accident and I couldn't find my can of tomato with chiles so I just used regular diced tomato. I also didn't use red pepper flakes because not everyone likes spiciness. Delicious! Thank you!
