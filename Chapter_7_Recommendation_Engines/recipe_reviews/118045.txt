Great recipe!  Use olive oil instead of marg or butter- makes it healthier and you can skip heating the sauce since it's already liquid.  Just mix sauce in regular bowl and dump into veggies once drained.  Doubled the lemon juice and peel.  Added fresh ground sea salt and black pepper.  May consider a sprinkle of parmesan or romano cheese on top.

The recipe might seem kind of weird, but the taste is something else. I was looking for a new rutabaga recipe. Didn't want a mash-em-up recipe, so decided on this. Made it as a side for Easter dinner and everyone loved it. Just a note on quantities - the average rutabaga where I shop is around the size of a medium grapefruit. This yielded roughly 4 cups - so I doubled the recipe (8 carrots) to use up the entire rutabaga. Great recipe and a definite keeper.

I served this at a dinner party and my guests went from "What the hell's a rutabaga?" to "WOW, this is AMAZING!" 5 out of 6 people took seconds - and thirds. 

The glaze is not lemony, exactly; the acidity just serves to round out the sweetness of the brown sugar. It really brings together the rutabaga and carrot flavors into more than the sum of it's parts. Just a great recipe and crowd-pleaser.

Ok, this recipe sounds weird but trust me, the taste is anything but! The flavor is very light and delicate, not overly lemony. I'd never had rutabegas before, but they were really good! I've been trying to find ways to add more vegetables to our diet, and this recipe is going to become a staple. It's easy to make, a gorgeous looking dish, tastes fantastic and is healthy.  What's not to love?

The lemon dill sauce really added a lot of flavor. I oven roasted the veggies once they were par cooked.

Very nice and EASY recipe.  My French-Canadian husband requested a rutabaga dish and there aren't many receipes out there.  I served it with pork tenderloin (and other vegetables) and it was a big hit with my husband and my other guests.  They ate every bit of it!  It is quite an attractive dish, as well.

Yummy!  Instead of boiling, I steamed the carrots and rutabaga strips for about 4-5 minutes, then tossed them in the sauce. I also doubled the amount of lemon juice, and added it after the butter melted.

This is just an awesome awesome dish.  Easy to prepare and the results were excellent.  If you have never tried rutabagas this is a great dish to start with and if you are a long time fan of the vegetable well this is a great twist eating them.

VERY good. The only thing I'll do different next time is reduce the glaze a little with more lemon. (to make it a little thicker and brown the butter)

Took a bit longer than the instructions said for the veggies to be done, but quite good on the whole. Instead of dill, I used rosemary, which was quite good.

I have never eaten rutabaga before, but sometimes I get tired of our usual veggie lineup so I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. The entire family enjoyed this dish. I don't like dill so I substituted tarragon for it. Delicous!

Tasty! Careful not to let the carrots and rutabaga boil out of water. Less brown sugar would be fine but the recipe is great as written. Thanks for sharing such an unexpected dish!

A great recipe.  I used dried dill weed but will use fresh dill from the garden next summer.  Very tasty and a good way to use up rutabaga.

Wow!  This was great!  I didn't have fresh dill, so I used dried and it was still great!  My hubby who hates cooked carrots even said it was wonderful!  Next time, I'm going to try roasting the vegetables.  Thanks for the new recipe!

Got a rutabaga in my CSA box.  This is a very tasty way to use it.  Nice combination of sweet and tart, and the dill added great flavor too.

I was given a rutabaga from someone's garden and didn't know what to do with it, so I found this recipe.  It was really good!  I love carrots so this helped me adjust to the new flavor of the rutabaga.  I didn't have any dill so I put in some pepper instead.  Very tasty!

Awefully tasty! The only thing I didn't have was lemon zest... but i DID have fresh dill. i think the fresh dill really made the dish. the combination with a little bit of sweetness from the sauce was great. Thanks for the recipe.

We loved this! I also steamed the veggies, but I did not cook the sauce. I simply tossed the veggies with the remaining ingredients and ate right away. Delicious!

Unexpectedly delicious!  The play of root veggie goodness with the lemon and slight sweetness of the sugar and tang of the dill is a fabulous combination.  My garden is making lots of rutabaga and I was desperate for something new to do with it.  This recipe hit the spot and I will make it over and over again!  I made exactly as written, but I did use rainbow carrots for aesthetic pleasure (it looks beautiful in the serving dish), and I used fresh dill, which wasn't specified but I'm guessing it makes it better than dried dill ever could.  Delish!!  Even made a rutabaga fan out of my picky 15-year-old.

This was tasty, and quite easy once you get past peeling the rutabaga.  I didn't know how much flavor the rutabaga would have, so I added half of the lemon rind (after zesting and juicing) to the pot while boiling the vegetables.  I also used fresh dill, so I used at least a full teaspoon.

I love this recipe. It is simple and quick. I substituted raw honey for brown sugar and it worked great.

Even my VERY picky 7 and 10 year olds ate this recipe up!!!!  I had never made anything with rutabaga before, and I was very skeptical, but everyone in my family gave it 5 stars.  I made the recipe exactly as written, except I cooked it in my microsteamer rather than on the stove top.

First time I ever had rutabaga.  The dish tasted good but cutting rutabaga is a pain.  It wasnt worth all the effort.

This recipe is really good. Different, because I have never had lemony veggies before, but its nice to change things up sometimes. Boyfriend absolutely loved them. Will definately make again.
