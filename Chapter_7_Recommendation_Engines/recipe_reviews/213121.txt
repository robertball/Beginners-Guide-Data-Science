YUM!!!!  I didn't have any molasses, so I used sorgham syrup.  I also added about a tablespoon of dark brown sugar.  The tangy balsamic vinegar is the perfect contrast to the sweetness.  After I plated the brie, I also drizzled some of the yummy goodness over the brie round too.  I served with home made croustini and roasted cherry tomatoes.  I'll definitely be making again!

This was not good. The balsamic and molasses mixture was too runny and made it very messy to eat.  I served it to guests and was embarrassed.
Would not try again.

I tried this with walnuts and a little light Karo syrup on top, served with Sesmark gluten-free crackers and sliced Fuji apple. Love.

My husband begs for this Brie often! I usually use maple syrup or corn syrup since I don't often have molasses. I just pour the liquid on the Brie in my "Brie baker" and we eat it out of the dish. A good bonding experience. :-)

Fabulous! I needed a savory, gluten free baked Brie recipe and this did the trick.  It was totally messy and gooey but oh so delicious.  It barely survived until the meal started and was cleaned up throughout.  Will definitely make this again but maybe a bit less sauce underneath.

It was not as flavorful as I expected. Perhaps the Brie needs the dough to absorb the greasiness of the cheese.

This is excellent(with change). I am not a fan of molasses, so today I substituted maple syrup. I will be making this one again.
