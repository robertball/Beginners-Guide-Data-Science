I did not cook it in the crock pot, and it tasted great.  I cooked the potatoes and added to the diced onion, bacon and garlic, which I sauted.  Then I added the wet ingredients and slowly boiled for about 15 mins.

I made this for a beer tasting party with a German theme.  I did not use a slow cooker but put it in the oven at 350 for about an hour.  When I first tried it about 1/2 way through cooking in the oven, it seemed a little lackluster in terms of taste.  I added a bunch of pepper, kosher salt and some additional cooked onion. I was a little worried when I got to the party because it still tasted sort of drab.  It sat in a warm oven for about 30 minutes before we ate and I got many compliments.  I was surprised at how flavorful it was.  Recommendation:  add pepper and salt plus a lot more onion than called for...also having it cook longer and then sit must help with the flavors.

I didn't really care for this, either hot or cold.  Thanks for posting but I won't be making it again.

Delicious potato salad.  It is even better the next day cold.
