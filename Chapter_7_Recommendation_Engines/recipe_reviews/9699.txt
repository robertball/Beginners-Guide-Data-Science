I liked these bars, and they are very fast and easy to make.  I didn't have any dates so used raisins.  The second batch I left out the raisins and added mini choc. chips instead. Even Better!!  Will make these again!

This bar was lite and yummy!  A perfect combo of soft and gooey.  I didn't have walnuts so I subbed almonds and I didn't quite have enough honey so I used 1/4 cup brown rice syrup too.  I mixed in some coconut flakes (unsweetened) into the mixture as well as on top.  This is one of those treats that I feel good about sharing with my son and others because I know it's naturally sweetened!  I'll be making this one often as an afternoon snack.

Very easy to make and tasty, too!   I used dried cranberries instead of the nuts, an interesting flavor combination with the dates!  I'm looking forward to making them again with different dried fruits!

Forgot the powdered sugar on top, but it didn't matter!  These were delicious!  Almost like cake, super sweet with a definite honey flavor.  BTW, I used whole wheat flour and they were still light and fluffy.

this is the best, easiest recipe! I baked it in a circular pie pan and made it a cake with powdered sugar+water icing with fresh strawberries and orange slices, it was gone in 15 minutes!

I really wanted to like these, but I just didn't.  I really like dates and I like honey but these just didn't do it for me...

Very yummy good-for-you snack! I've made these quite a few times now, both with and without the powdered sugar topping. They make a great healthier option for desert and are a great snack as well. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe. I love the idea of the honey mixed with the dates. Something that I have never thought of before. Personally, I buy all my honey from Holy Food Imports. They grow their products in Israel and sell them in the US.

I will not be making this one again.  Texture was unappealing, nuts and dates sank to the bottom.

These turned out good and I was happy to share them with my kids. They are a great alternative to store bought snacks. I was a little surprised at the bread like consistency of the bars. I was expecting more of a brownie like consistency. They did taste good. The only change I made was that I used dried cranberries in place of dates. I will definitely make this again.

I did some modifications- 1/2 cup white flour + 1/4 cup wheat flour; instead of walnuts, I used crasins; decreased confectioners' sugar to 1/6 cup; and I made a mistake- it says "dates, pitted" and in my mind I read prunes because they are pitted so that is what I put in (don't laugh).  These were good.  Everbody in the family said that they liked them.  However, they didn't ask for a second piece and said that I didn't need to make this recipe again.  My husband says they are a little too sweet.  The kids wanted chocolate chips in them.  Bottom line: Their good and "healthy", but not AMAZING.
