We just returned from a trip to Sweden in August and the family we stayed with picked wild Chanterelle mushrooms and would make wonderful dishes out of them. Since we've returned home, we have missed the delicious dishes from Sweden. My husband bought some fresh Chanterelles recently and he wasn't sure what we should do with them so I came to allrecipes.com and found this unique recipe. The finished product holds up nicely (like a meatloaf) and has a wonderful flavor.  I am giving it 4 stars because the salt was just a little over powering. The ham probably adds more salt to the dish so maybe try cutting the salt down to just 1 tsp.  I will post a photo as soon as I download them from my camera.  Thank you for a delicious recipe.

I don't know why they sell "dried" chanterelles!  Well, I do know why, but it's just cruel.  Chanterelles should never be dried, because they become like leather when dried, and wet leather when reconstituted.  Never, never, never buy dried chanterelles - Fresh, Yes!  Dried, No!

I was fortunate enough to have a very kind neighbor who gave me a couple of pounds of fresh chantrelles. I thought this recipe looked intriguing and I wanted to try it. I read the reviews and, honestly, I've never heard of either dried or frozen chantrelles, and I can't imagine either would be good. This is a recipe for the fresh ones and this recipe didn't disappoint, at all! This is fantastically delicious and I'm so glad you submitted it! If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!! Thanks!

Ok  thought the flavor in this dish was really good, although I must admit I made some substitutions which probably didn't make it a 5 in total.  I didn't have shallots so I did 1/2 an onion, 1 tsp of dried parsley instead of fresh, 1/2 tsp of salt, just regular lunchmeat ham slices and I could only find dried chanterelle mushrooms and only 1/2 of what the recipe called for so I used fresh portabellas.  Everything tastes so good except for the dried chanterelles, which I did soak ahead of time to 'rehydrate' if you will and they just tasted really off.  I will make it again and if I can't find 'fresh' chanterelles, I'll do all ports again.  Overall great flavor and something different to make for a change, thank you :)

Hit the done button by mistake. I made Chef Johns pate and it was better.  To the person who said the it was salty, I agree. But my tolerance for salt is low.  Salt is the same by weight but not volume. I use Morton Kosher which is less dense, therefore less salt by weight.  I cut the amount is salt by1/3.  I also used unsalted butter. Before I packed the mold, I took a bit of the mixture and cooked it in the microwave. I could have added more salt at that point, but it was good and the ham was also going to add salt. Good recipe, I will make it again.

This is absolutely fabulous exactly as written.  I've made it twice, the second time I used 1/2 pound ground pork and 1/4 pound ground veal and it was even better!
