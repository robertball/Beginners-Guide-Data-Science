This is such a quick and easy dinner. I didn't use the cream cheese, just the mayo with a chopped tomato and kosher pickle thrown in.  Even healthier!  You could stuff this into a tomato, a red pepper, the variations are unlimited.  I also topped with crushed croutons and DH added a dollop of ranch dressing.

I tried this last night, and it was so incredibly easy, and so unexpectedly good!  I did add a little basil, a few drops of hot pepper sauce and some grated Monterrey Jack cheese.  Finally, I have something special to make with avocados besides guacamole.

These are not too bad, but bf was completely put off by the idea.  I'm not sure why, as he likes the cucumber boats on here, but whatever.  I cut the mayo and cream cheese down--really doesn't need that much!  Tuna is pretty moist out of the can anyway.  I elminated the onions, added pickles for crunch and tomatoes for color, then used my medium cookie scoop to put in the avocado.  Pretty presentation and a neat idea (I think, anyway--we'll just ignore the bf's malfunction).

I've never actually had this recipe prepared the way it is described here, however, my sister used the same exact ingredients and put it in a wrap. It was yummy! Now, I am spoiled and won't eat canned tuna unless it is prepared this way or similarly.

Very good recipe! I have made this a few times, once exactly as stated resulting in a four star recipe. To make it a five star recipe, I cut back on the cream cheese a bit  (only 4 oz) and added some diced carrots and celery for some extra crunch. I omitted the celery seed. I've also made it with crab when I was out of tuna and it is AMAZING with crab!!

I think the flavors and textures in this recipe work really well.  I used non-fat, plain greek yogurt in place of the mayo. I added no cream cheese, and no celery seed (didn't have). I added a pinch of sea salt, garlic and onion powder to taste, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and chopped cherry tomatoes. I refridgerated both the salad and the avacado halves until well chilled. I also chopped pistachios and used as a nice crunchy topping.

This is one of my favorite dishes! So healthy and lean! Mix it up with some dill or onion and garlic for a more flavorful dish.

So much better than I imagined.  And I thought I would like it, of course, or wouldn't have tried it. My husband loved this.  Great flavor combination and so quick and easy.  I don't like celery seed so I omitted that and added a small stalk of finely chopped celery.   This would make a fantastic sandwich on really good bread -- spread on the tuna mixture, slice the avocados and layer on with lettuce and tomatoes.

Couldn't help adding my personal touch to this recipe... I added sliced black olives, finely chopped dill pickles, a dash of dill weed and garlic salt, and chopped tomatoes. Yum!

I diced the avocados, stirred it in with the other ingredients, and used it as a topping for toasted sourdough bagels. The celery seed was a bit overpowering but overall, it was a nice lunch. Next time I'll add some baby arugula leaves. Thanks, Vicki!

This was a bit to creamy for me and wayyyyy to cream for my boyfriend. We liked the avocado best in this which I guess was not the point. I'll keep the idea of serving tuna (or chicken or crab) salad in an avocado but leave this particular recipe....

I changed the recipe some in order to "liven" this up. I added 1 tsp garlic, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp pepper. I used fresh celery instead of celery seed and I used 1 (8oz) cream cheese and 2 cans of (5 oz) tuna. Then I added half a cucumber chopped and half a tomato chopped. Overall it was nice snack but don't eat it expecting a full meal. My son didn't like the avocado but like the tuna salad on crackers.

Wow, this was a surprise! I am completely in love with this recipe. The tuna mixture is so tasty with the cream cheese and it complements the avocado so well. It's also great on crackers! Thanks for this one!

So much creamy stuff, you couldn't taste the tuna. If there is a next time, I will halve the amount of cream cheese/mayo. The combined textures of avocado, mayo, and cream cheese was like eating slices of butter.

I served this for dinner last night, and this is a delicious recipe.  I made the tuna mixture in the morning, it goes very quickly, so that the flavors could meld in the fridge all day.  I came home, prepared the avocados, topped with the tuna salad, added crackers to side of the plate, and we were good to go on dinner!  When I made the tuna mixture, I added some garlic powder because I find it really compliments the avocado.  I also used finely diced celery, in lieu of celery seed, because I didn't have the celery seed on hand.  Then I added half of a peeled, seeded, and cubed cucumber.  You can top with other veggies as well... tomatoes, sprouts, etc.  This was healthy, refreshing, and everyone loved it(including my toddler).  For my toddler, I just scooped out the avocado, cubed it, and added tuna salad on top.  So easy and so good.  Thank you.

I had only tried avocados once before, too long ago to remember. So I decided to give them a shot--this is the first avocado recipe I've tried so far. I wasn't at all sure what to expect, but this turned out to be pretty tasty! Thanks. :)
