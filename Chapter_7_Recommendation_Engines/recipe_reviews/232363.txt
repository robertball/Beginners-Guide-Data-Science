I am happy to be the first to review Chef John's newest offering.  I have made carrots in a similar fashion for years but never thought of adding bourbon.  What an inspired idea!  I used baby carrots, so rather than slicing them to rounds, I simply quartered or halved them and it worked well.  My advice is to make these soon and consider having them the special occasion!

Tasty dish.  A bit too sweet for most of us.  Bourbon flavor was very nice and the seasoning was ok but missing something.   Next time I think I will "steam" the veggies in the bourbon then add some butter,the seasoning, fresh parsley and garlic. I used baby carrots and left them whole as they were thin and petite. The recipe did make for well browned and caramelized carrots so if you like sweet veggies you may very well enjoy this recipe.

My, oh my!  Thank you Chef John.  Served it to my husband and friends and there wasn't a carrot left over!  Yes, it's sweet (and the bourbon gives it such a wonderful flavor), but It is PERFECT with a simple steak or chicken and a side of cooked fresh spinach.

I used two 12 oz bags of frozen crinkle cut carrot coins and the same amount of all other ingredients as listed in the recipe. I thawed carrots first, then followed the rest of the directions. Sprinkled a touch (very light) of  ground thyme instead of fresh was only other change. People went crazy last Thanksgiving, and when invited this year, asked if I would please make "The Carrots" again.

I liked it.  I only put in a small amount of sugar and just added little by little.  Actually as carrots are already a sweet vegetable, it doesn't need much.  The only other thing.....if I put alcohol in a dish, I prefer to flambee it.  The sauce tastes much better.

They are great, but what isn't with all that butter.  I do not use cayenne pepper, or black pepper, but I do use dried Basil.  Like John said, not a dish for everyday, but once in awhile is really great.

These were very good, however I found the cooking times way off, at least for me. In the first  step it took closer to fifteen minutes, then the second step was about eight to ten minutes. All told over half an hour. Nice taste though, not too sweet.

I'm not typically a cooked carrot fan and I loved these!!  The recipe instructions were spot on.  I used baby carrots, sliced in half and halved the recipe.  I used a honey bourbon and that worked very well.  I really liked the heat the cayenne pepper added.  I'd rate it 5 stars, but Mr. LTH hated them (he didn't even finish his).  THANKS for the recipe!

Delicious.  Watch out for the 2' flare up with the bourbon, even if your flame is off.   Easy and well worth making.  Cayenne adds perfect heat and dimension.

The recipe is decent although there is either way too much bourbon or bourbon and carrots are not a good pairing.  It isn't bad, just kind of strange.  I made the carrots exactly as written and will try again though will also make some adjustments.  Perhaps use another kind of alcohol or a vegetable broth or reduce the amount of bourbon.

These were so good. I wish I could make them all the time but unfortunately they really have to be for a special occasion if you are watching calories. Delicious.

These carrots are DELICIOUS! Made the recipe exactly as written - other than reducing the amount of butter just a bit, but this wouldn't have affected the taste. 

It really is important to try and get the carrots to be all the same thickness, if you want the texture consistent. Ours did vary, despite trying to get them about the same size, so some were softer, and others firmer. We still enjoyed them very much.

These carrots are delicious! They were my family’s favourite dish at Thanksgiving. I added some candied pecans in the last minute of the cook and it turned out great!

I do not like bourbon, or liquor of any kind, but decided to take a chance on this glaze for carrots.  It was beyond fantastic.  If I could have poured the glaze in a mug and drank it hot, I would have.  It is an outstanding recipe and I will definitely be making it again and again for holiday celebrations and special occasions.  For those of you who like to play around with ingredients and amounts, I did not and am thankful I stayed true to both the technique and ingredient amounts.  Thanks, Chef John!

Makes plenty of sauce for 3 lbs carrots - using this amount also helps distribute the sweetness.  As others noted, it takes a little longer to sauté the carrots to proper doneness.  Very attractive and popular side dish for a holiday dinner.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.

I made this for Christmas dinner with Chef John's perfect prime rib recipe that I make every year. Wanted something other than string beans so thought I'd give this a try. I followed the recipe exactly on this one, but the bourbon seemed to be overpowering when it was done. The majority of the guests felt the same way and only two of us ate them. I'll make them again but will definitely use less bourbon..They were nicely glazed and I cooked them to the perfect doneness. I'm giving them a 4 because they tasted good, but only if you like bourbon or other whiskey. I may try something different like Grand Marnier the next time, but again, will not use a half cup.

Way too much butter for us, but good flavor otherwise.  If I make it again, will reduce butter by half.

Another great use for bourbon from my home state of Kentucky.   All you UK Wildcats, UofL Cardinals and any other schools in the state, give this one a try.  It is rather sweet but with the mild flavors of chicken or turkey is perfect!

Very tasty. I may try other versions of this concept though. I subbed xylitol for sugar for a lower-carb version, and that may have affected things. Weren't as good as leftovers, as they started to get a bit mushy.

This is fantastic! I cut the recipe down to two servings, and I did parboil the carrots with some brussles that needed to be used. (I only did that because the BF is not a huge fan of carrots or sprouts....but he is learning) I then followed the recipe, sautéing the vegetables till nice and brown, and it turned out so great! I only had Crown Royal on hand, and we both ate the whole batch! Will definitely do this again!

Fantastic.  Replaces my old recipe.  I used a Tennessee whisky (George Dickel) instead of a bourbon because that's my go to whiskey but of course no one could tell a difference.

I made this for the first time as a Thanksgiving side dish and it got rave reviews. In fact there was no leftovers. I used 3# of carrots and there was plenty of glaze. I will definitely serve this again.

These were so freaking awesome!  I cut the recipe in half, and used baby carrots that I halved, but otherwise followed it as written.  I used a good bourbon, and I initially thought it might not be enough, but the glaze cooked down perfectly and the bourbon was just enough.  This one is a winner!

You don't have to love bourbon but there is no alcohol left after the cooking.  Very savory and sweet.

These are fantastic.  Even though they are considered a "special" occasion food, I will prepare them a lot more often than that!  I used Maker's Mark (any bourbon will do but try to avoid the cheap, rot-gut stuff).  I also used baby carrots instead of cutting my own.

This was a big hit  when I served it at a dinner party for  four couples.  I had a feeling  I’d run out so I added a few more carrots.  The glaze was plentiful and absolutely delicious, as written.  I forgot to add the herbs, as I brought this dish to a friend and meant to sprinkle fresh herbs over the warmed carrots just before serving.  I cannot imagine it would have tasted any better, but perhaps the green leaves would have “dressed it.”   This recipe is a Keeper!

Chef John kills it... again! Made this with Rum (the only bourbon we had was a little high-end to put in this #humblebrag) and it turned out delicious. Also used a couple medium whole carrots halved and quartered. You have to be careful not to over-cook the carrots - I was shooting for an al dente and missed. Used a cast iron skillet which made for easy cleanup. This recipe is easy to modify and make any night of the week.

I love this simple recipe and I've made it several times.  I have fallen in love with a new addition to my alcohol repertoire, which is Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey-so I change out the bourbon for the whiskey and it gives the dish a delicious taste-try it you won't be sorry.

Loved these carrots.  I added a little extra cayenne pepper which gave it some real tang and cut down on some of the sweetness.  Yum.

New staple to our Thanksgiving lineup. The carrots take a lot longer to brown than 5 minutes though- depends on the pan you use.

1st time - to much sugar 
2nd time -  to much butter
Good taste, can be flexible with amount of sugar to get your own sweetness level. If to much butter, all glaze stays at the bottom.
will do for a third time definitely.

WOW!   I don't care for carrots so I don't make them very often, but I wanted something different for Christmas dinner.  My family informed me they want carrots prepared this way all the time.  They tasted so good that I may start eating more carrots.   I didn't have cayenne  so I didn't use it.  I also cut down on the butter and bourbon  but only because I only made about a pound of carrots and didn't want to overpower the dish.  Very good! Thanks  Chef John.

Delicious.  I added a little too much brown sugar and not enough bourbon to mine, but they were still great.  I have tried a number of Chef John's recipes and they are great and easy to follow.  These were the family favorite for Sunday Dinner.  I will be making them a little more often than a couple times a year.   If my meal ever needs something sweet and another veggie, these will be on the table.  Incredibly easy to make, low maintenance dish, and hard to screw it up.

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were a hit.  I made it exactly as written using baby carrots and we didn't find them too sweet.  I did however feel that it may have been too much butter, I would try half the butter next time.  When they were done, although they tasted great as-is, I felt as though the bourbon wasn't coming through so I added another 1/2 cup.  This is optional and when I make them again i will double the bourbon

Served this to my family (one of whom doesn't like carrots) and there was not any leftovers!  This will definitely find a place on our table time and again!
