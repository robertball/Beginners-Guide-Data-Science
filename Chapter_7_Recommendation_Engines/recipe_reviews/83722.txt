Made this for the first time today... and can only say PHENOMINAL....I did make some minor modifications to this though, mainly for personal taste... The modifications are for a doubled recipe and was served at a ministry BBQ, had I known that it was going to go over as well as it did I would have actually quadrupled the recipe and still would not have had any left-overs.. 

1) replaced the cheddar cheese with 2 7 oz bags of Sargentos Bistro Blends, one Asiago and roasted garlic and one Sundried Tomato and Basil, The Asiago went in with that sour cream mixture, the other was mixed in with the topping...

I replaced the bacon with diced pancetta and added 1/4 Walla Walla Sweet Onion and 1 Tsp of minced garlic

Used bacon ranch instead of plain ranch...

Replaced the Parsley with Fresh Chives

Drizzled the melted butter over the topping rather than mixing it in with the cheese and cornflake mixture...

I will definitely make this again, but will change a couple of items even further

I will reduce the amount of cornflakes in the topping and not add them until the last 15 minutes of baking time...

The only thing I did not like about this was the layer of grease on the bottom of the dish as it was being served. This could be avoided by using a thin layer of the cornflakes on the bottom of the baking dish to absorb it.

I thought this was delicious! My whole family loved them too! The only thing I would do different is to add salt and pepper on the potatoes before adding the ranch mixture.I'll definately be making this again!

I am going to be one of those people that changes the recipe and then states her opinion- I know, me too....
Anyway I didn't have red potatoes so I used yellow and scaled back the recipe for 4 servings.  Cubed the raw potato thru it in an oven safe casserole dish sprinkled with fresh ground pepper and two crisp crumbled bacon strips.  Mixed sour cream, 1/4 Cup ranch dressing powder and cheese in a small bowl.  Poured over potatoes and mixed thoroughly. Covered and cooked for 1 hour in a 325 oven (I was roasting a chicken at that temp). Didn't use topping. THIS WAS SO GOOD!  NOT DRY AT ALL!

This is a yummy one.  I've been making this for years, and call it Ranch Potato Casserole.  It's sooo tasty!  Last time I made it, I had fresh basil and not parsley so I used that.  It was still good!  I've tried it with low-fat ingredients and it's just not as good....so I only make it for special occasions!

VERY HEAVY! The first time I had them my Mom made them and while they tasted good, I could hear my heart saying mercy. I made these last week for a poluck and I tweaked it. I used 2/3 cup fat free sour cream, used 2/3 cup fat free sour cream (instead of bottled dressing) and used 2 packets of Ranch dry seasoning mix, used 2% cheddar cheese, Used the precooked bacon pieces (less calories and fat then fresh bacon)added 3 tbsp's minced garlic to the mix and used Land O Lakes light butter with Canola Oil (in small tub) in place of butter.
It tasted a little different then the orginal but was still DELISH!!!!!! Cut the fat & calories by over a 1/3 and there was none left. I have added dill or chives or green onions also, to help flavor them up! had many people ask for the recipe. I gave them the original version and mine!

I used Yukon Gold potatoes that were rather large, so I zapped them in the microwave until done.  The ranch/sour cream mixture didn't seem to be enough, so the whole dish was dry, but maybe boiling the potatoes would have solved that problem.  My husband also ate almost all the corn flakes and I didn't realize it until I went to use them, so I substituted plain bread crumbs and the topping looked fine.  Overall, pretty good, and I think I'll give it another try - this time as written!

I'm kind of stumped by the "dry and tasteless" reviews.  I stayed very true to the recipe, except scaled it up to 18 servings because I had 3 pounds of potatoes.  I still baked it in a 9 by 13 pan though.  Maybe the thicker layer of potatoes held the sauce better?  I also salted my water for the potatoes, sprinkled seasoned salt on them once they were in the pan, and added some pepper to the sauce.  I was actually a little skeptical of how they'd turn out since the sauce didn't taste that great to me, but the flavors really melded together wonderfully to the point that you wouldn't necessarily pinpoint the flavors as being ranch, sour cream, and cheddar cheese.  Also I sprinkled my bacon over the topping to keep it from getting soggy, and I used the original amount of topping in spite of increasing everything else.  The only thing I would change for next time is decrease the butter in the topping (which was really good) because I ended up with puddles of melted butter in the bottom of the dish.  That may be because I measured the 3 cups of cornflakes before crushing them, maybe if I'd used more the amount of butter would have been okay.

Mmm. These were very good. The more you ate though, the less you liked the flavor. Overall they were good.

This recipe was realy good but left overs were a little dry. I will make this again and will use a full 16oz. of Ranch dressing and instead of corn flakes I will try stove top stuffing.

Pretty good.  I used all low fat ingredients with success.  The dish was still flavorful.  Will probably make again sometime.  Thanks.

I didn't really like this recipe. I thought the sauce was very oily and the potatos didn't have much taste. I won't be making this again. Sorry!

Sorry didn't like this much. The cornflake topping was nice (I didn't use the butter) but the potatoes were dry & tasteless. I even added a whole cup of milk to the ranch mixture before cooking the potatoes but they were still dry. Won't be trying this one again.

I also used Yukon Gold potatoes like another reviewer did, mainly because they were all I had on hand. I followed the recipe exactly (other than the kind of potatoes) including the boiling, and they still came out dry and unflavorful, even with the ranch dressing, bacon, and cheese.  It smelled absolutely fantastic while it was cooking, so it was hugely disappointing for them to end up tasting so blah once they came out of the oven.  I didn't see anything about salting the potatoes while they were boiling, could that have been the problem?  I didn't add any, as the recipe didn't call for it, and it seemed like none was needed...until after we tasted them.  After cooking, no amount of salt made them better.

If I try this recipe again with the 'right' potatoes, I will gladly add a new review if the difference is dramatic.

DELISH!! This was FANTASTIC! I cut up the potato's into chunks before I boiled them and had to leave out the parsley because I forgot to pick it up. Other than I followed the recipe and used LowFat Sourcream. This got all sorts of mmms and yum's while we were eating. Not sure why some people had bland potato's because mine were anything but bland! I really liked this better then, cheesy ranch potato bake, that I use to think was the best. THANKS for such an awesome recipe! Follow the recipe and you won't be disappointed :-)

my husband really enjoyed this dish. i halved the recipe, and used crushed crackers on top instead of the cornflakes (not a big cornflake topping fan!). i found the cook time to be excessive, i only had it in the oven 15 mins and it was bubbling away. i think if it was left in the oven for 45 mins as stated it would really dry out. as i had cooked my potatoes in the water to desired tenderness before putting the casserole in the oven, you're only really heating the dish through, not cooking anything anyway.  all in all it wasn't bad - nothing super special but a change from the ordinary.  thank you!

My husband loved this!  I too used a combination of extra sour cream (about 1 1/3 cup total) and a HALF PACKET of Ranch dip mix in leiu of the ranch dressing due to what I did (and didn't) have on hand.  We are eating on a pretty tight grocery budget so this was our main course tonight-- a lead sinker!  A definite keeper!

I nearly doubled this recipe and still prepared it in a deep 9x13 pan. I used about 4 cups of corn flakes with 1 stick of butter and 1 1/2 cups of cheese. I also added garlic pepper seasoning to the ranch dressing mixture. Oh, yeah, and I used 1 lb. of bacon. It was killer. I didn't add the crumbs until the last 15 minutes of baking. The bacon was just sprinkled over the potatoes before I spooned on the ranch dressing mixture. I will make this again.

My goodness, ranch, sharp cheddar, and bacon. How can you go wrong? It was supposed to be the side dish but it stole the show. Everyone loved them. 

I made a batch using 5 lbs of red potatoes. I struggle to have leftovers. They are gone tonight. 

I used peppered bacon and French Fried Onions with half the cheese for the topping.

We're calling this dish Heart Attack Potatoes. Next time I will try Yukon Gold potatoes instead of red.

Eh.  These were fine, but a little dry.  Maybe we used too many potatoes, but even after adding some more cream mixture (because it looked to dry before baking) these still weren't that great.  We'll stick with our au gratin potato recipe in the future.

Good recipe!  As you can guess, it's very bold, so be careful making it with another elaborate dish.  I serve this with a simple chicken and zucchini medley and it's always a hit.

I gave this 4 stars only because I Started out with this recipe but didnt exactly follow.  I actually boiled the potatoes too long so I couldnt bake them.  I took all the ingridients minus the corn flakes and mashed the potatoes and they were SOOOO good like that.  I also added extra cheese and bacon in them.  They made awesome mashed potatoes

I LOVED this recipes, but DH wasn't a fan (probably the ranch dressing). The cornflakes gives it such a nice crunchy topping. I will definitely make this one for potlucks!

This is a great starter recipe! I was a little unsure about this recipe due to the lack of seasoning, but I made it as directed. It came out pretty good, but kind of bland. Next time I make it I'm going to add the basic salt and pepper (that every recipe should have!), some minced onion and maybe a handful of sliced green onions. YUM!! Just like a loaded baked potato.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! It was delicious. Although I used more ranch, sour cream, cheese and bacon then was called for. It was awesome.

My friend and I love making this dish for our boyfriends. We add a lot more bacon and a lot more cheese for the boys. Not the healthiest potato dish...but definitely the yummiest!

I used one 2lb bag of frozen southern style poatoes instead of peeling and cooking potatoes, tasted good and was faster. Next time I will not add parsely.  I don't like cooked parsley and it didn't look that good in it.  I will also use more cheese.  Overall it isn't too bad.

My boyfriend and I both adored these potatoes! I will definitely, definitely make them again. My grocery store had a small bag of fingerling potatoes, which I used instead of red potatoes. There were small purple potatoes in the mix that gave the dish a nice, hearty color. I also added some french fried onions to the crunchy topping. It was a hit!

These potatoes are awesome!  They have a great flavor, and are a nice substitute side dish for the average potatoes.

I made this for dinner last night with Best Ever Chicken.  Very good recipe.  I used white potatoes and substituted bacon bits for real bacon.  I would recommend not adding the cornflake topping until it is halfway done.

A perfect side dish. You can never go wrong with anything having to do with Ranch. Very tasty...I seasoned with a little bit of salt as well! Great recipe!

loved it! made a meal with broiled steak, baked onions and this baked potato casserole. The steak and the onion recipe are both from this site.
