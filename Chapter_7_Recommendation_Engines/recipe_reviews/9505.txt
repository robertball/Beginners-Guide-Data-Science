very good!!  made it for a party and everyone loved it!  i did follow advice given and whipped the heavy cream on it's own, then gently folded it into the cream cheese/sugar/chocolate mixture.  worked perfectly...and much better than i think would work doing it all together.  i also made it in a trifle bowl, layering everything twice...cake, cream, toffee, cake, cream, toffee.  loaded the top with toffee and drizzled with some more chocolate.  yum.  oh--and i also used fresh pound cake from our grocery store bakery, which i think is a better option if it's available to you, as it was perfectly moist.  I did find, however, that 2 (10.75oz) packages of pound cake is more accurate for the layering.

This recipe was terrific!  I substituted Bailey's Irish Cream for the chocolate syrup and it came out perfect!  Make sure to whip the cream until soft peaks form so that it is not too runny! (it may seem to take forever, but it's worth it!!!).  I also bought the already chopped Heath bits which saved on the prep time.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a quick, easy, and flavorful dessert!
Thanks Jackie!!!!

This was wonderful. I also make it in a trifel bowl layering it.  I also shaved bittersweet chocolate on the top of mine.  Also if anyone of you are confused on how much coffee to use per water.  I used 6 Tablespoons of coffee and brewed it with one cup of water.  I was rather nervous thinking it may to strong.  But it was perfect.  I also make mine the night before and I think that was also the key.  I will be making this again and again.  And I may not always used the chocolate toffee bits maybe cocoa and a bittersweet chocolate bar shaved.  It was great. Thanks

I like this dessert a lot, but do make a couple of very minor changes. (1) I use the larger (16 oz) frozen pound cake and cut into 12 slices, which fits perfectly in a 9" x 13" dish. (2) I use only 1 cup of heavy cream, which makes a heavier textured filling (using the 2 cups is why so many reviewers had to whip it up separately & then add to the cream cheese mixture). The two cup amount of cream just drowns the cake in "filling"; the one-cup amount gives it a nice custard-like layer. (3)  I get a couple of Heath bars and chop them up for the topping. I found that when we use the toffee chips (like "Skor"), they do not stay crunchy for very long. It may not be a true traditional tiramisu, but it is VERY tasty, very easy, and very different from the usual desserts!

This was a very good alternative to the original tiramisu. I did mix the cream cheese, chocolate and sugar together and beat the whipping cream separately until stiff. I then gently folded the cream into the chocolate mixture. This created a creamy yet firm consistency. I think next time I will slice the pound cake thiner and make two layers of cake and icing. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This is a very yummy dessert that everyone I served it to loved.  I too was a little confused by the "frosting" layer, so what I did was add half the whipped cream to the chocolate mixture and then used the rest of the whipped cream as the final layer.  Turned out great.  Thanks.

I will make this dessert over and over and over again.  It was a HUGE hit!  I got so many compliments that I starting getting embarrassed.  I altered slightly. 1. Used 2 SaraLee frozen pound cakes.  2.  Used International Cafe French Vanilla coffe with some Bailey's Irish Cream 3. Layered in triffle bowl as follows- cake, coffee, frosting, Heath Bar Crunchies, cake, coffee, frosting, Heath Bar Crunchies.  Made the night before.  There were no leftovers.  I should have made two!  I can't wait to make this again and again.  Everyone must make this at least once!!

This is one of the easiest/tastiest tiramisus.  I made this last Thanksgiving and the WHOLE family couldn't get enough of it.  I followed the directions exactly.  Nobody touched the pumpkin pie.  Everyone asked me to bring again this year.  Delicious. Total sucess!!

We used a 13x9 pan and ended up having to use almost two packages of pound cake.After reading the other reviews, we also added the Bailey's, and it definetly was well worth it! So moist, and light and delicious!Thank you Jackie for the recipe!

A definite keeper.  Used Smuckers Caramel Syrup instead of the candy.  (and 2 tbsps of Butterscotch Schnapps!)
Lined the pan with the pound cake, poured over expresso and then swirled the Syrup...whipped cream separately.  
Then did another decorative swirl on top.....got rave reviews!!!!!

Oh my gosh this was FANTASTIC!!  Made in a trifle bowl as another reviewer suggested (looked beautiful!), also used a fresh pound cake purchased in local bakery.  Also, I used about 1/3 cup of Kahula in place of some of the coffee.

we all really liked this recipe. However, too sweet and over powered by the chocolate. I think the amount of chocolate is too much. I will try half the amount next time and reduce the amount of sugar as well to see if I can get the coffee and cream flavors to come out more. I did use a shot of Kahlua.

This recipe was very good, however I took the advice of a rater on here and used more pound cake than the recipe required and that was a BIG mistake, it made it very dry.  Next time I make this I will use very little pound cake.  I also subbed the coffee with Bayley's and used Heath bars.  Overall, it would have been perfect had I not upped the pound cake.

I used low fat pound cake, low fat cool whip, and low fat cream cheese-turned out very well!  I whipped the cream cheese, sugar and chocolate syrup together and gently folded it in to the defrosted cool whip.  Still tasted great and makes you feel a little better about indulging!

This is so delicious!! I let my stand mixer whip the heavy cream for a good ten minutes while I got everything else ready, then I whipped it into the sugar, chocolate, and cream cheese mixture. It turned out really fluffy. I also baked my own pound cake in a 9x13 pan and poked it with a fork before pouring espresso over the whole thing. I drizzled extra chocolate syrup over the crushed heath bar, too. I will definitely make this again!

This dessert is fabulous.  I made it for guests, and it was a big hit.  I will definately use this easy dessert again.  The recipe was a bit confusing re: the "frosting."  I used a 8x8 pan, and layered the cake, coffee, and whipped filling.  Then I did it again and covered with chopped Skor bar.  It turned out perfectly.

This was good, although a bit too sweet, but I wouldn't have called it tiramisu.  Made it as directed and the kids loved it.  I thought it was too sweet and definitely not like the real thing, but a fun dessert.  Will probably make it again some time for the kids.

Absolutely the best "big crowd" desert. Using homemade pound cake for it knocks it out of the park.

I made this for a dinner party for neighbors and everyone raved about it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I am a die hard Tiramisu lover and if you are looking for a recipe that compares to the authentic dessert this is not it. I changed only a few things, one, I bought a box pound cake mix and made the cake myself as the frozen ones often lack any flavor. I also bought the bag of toffee chips in the baking aisle which is well worth the time and mess of doing it yourself. Also I followed another raters suggestion and did it like a trifle in a clear bowl. It really made a nice presentation, everyone was salivating just from the looks of it on the table. It is a good dessert just don't expect it to taste like the real thing.

This is a "forever" recipe for my family and friends. I LOVE IT! I have made this over a dozen times and receive raves for it. I collect recipes and cookbooks so many times don't repeat stuff,(too many other recipes to try.) Not this one, it is forever a signature dessert for me. I did alter it a bit though. I baked my own pound cake and used the whole thing. I felt the frozen variety to small. Also, I mix Irish Cream Liqueur with the coffee mixture and used more coffee to pretty much drench the cake with. On top I put a layer of shaved chocolate and then the toffee bits. Make this quit a bit ahead of time to let the flavors meld.
Bon Appetit!

OMG!   This is awesome! Thank you so much for sharing.  I followed the others advice and whipped the cream separately.  It only took about 2 minutes with my Mixmaster.  Ditto for the cream cheese/choc/sugar mix.  I ran out of both Baileys and only had about 1/4C of choc syrup, so I tossed in some Ghiardelli's cocoa powder and added about a tablespoon of Bacardi's rum.  The filling could be a stand-alone dessert on it's own.  I used instant espresso to make the coffee and used lady fingers in place of the pound cake, since that's what I had on hand.  Made 2 layers and used the coffee soaked cakes, a handful of heath bar bits and the filling for each.  Topped it with the filling, a generous drizzle of caramel syrup and sprinkled it over with more Heath Bits.  Amazing and SO easy!  I'd give this 10 stars if the option were there!  Thanks again!

This was super easy and super good.  The only thing that I changed was I used marscapone cheese instead of the cream cheese.  I also didn't use 3/4 cup of coffee...probably more like 1/2 cup.  Very rich and something out of the ordinary to bring to a potluck - everyone loved it!

This turned out great!  I made this for a large dinner party and all my guests asked for the recipe.  After reading other reviews, I used two small pound cakes and made it in two layers in a 9x13 oval dish.  Very easy, fool-proof recipe.

Very good.  I substituted 1/2 cup sugar substitute for the sugar and all else was same as the recipe.  I was going to add the 1/2 cup of remaining sugar but after tasting the 1/2 cup of sugar substitute was just right.

This was simply wonderful! I wanted something different for dessert for Christmas eve dinner and this was perfect!  It turned out light and delicious. I changed a few things only to cut down on the fat content.  I used angel food cake instead of pound cake, fat free Cool Whip instead of the whipping cream and fat free cream cheese. The cream cheese stayed a bit lumpy so next time I will use low fat, but other than that, it was fantastic!  Thank you for such a delicious recipe!

This was great! Super easy. Used 2 regular sized Heath candy bars and should have had 3 or 4. The creamy part of the dessert made much more than I needed. Could have probably used a couple pound cakes and still had enough of the creamy filling. Served this to my girlfriends at a music in the park event and it was a huge hit.

Outstanding! I made this for my Moms and Step Dad's anniversary dinner. They loved it and so did I. Then i made it for a family party and every one wanted the recipe. Best taste ever. I recommend saving some whipping cream for the top (put some to the side) for the toffee and chocolate syrup. Also, add about one 1/4 cup of sugar to the whipping cream you put on top just an extra touch.sooooooooooooo good

This was so quick and easy..I almost felt guilty.  The whole family raved about it.  I would love to make the authentic version with the lady fingers, but when time it limited this recipe is a great substitute.

I think it would be interesting if the people would figure in the estimated cost of a recipe.  For years I baked once a week until I had to resign because of a crippling back.  And there at the last it was becoming very expensive !! ~ Dori ~

Excellent dessert. Took it to my wine tasting group and it was a hit. I bought as Bubbly Moscato wine, which went great with it! However, the instructions were confusing. They repeat some of the same instructions in step 2 & 3, as if your are suppose to have 2 layers but it doesn't say to make 2 layers of the pound cake. Yet the picture shows 2 layers, and that it's round, which it calls for a rectangular pan. I made it a 2 layer (luckily I bought 2 pound cakes),and doubled coffee (for 2nd layer). The filling/frosting mix was plenty for 2 layers. I also did it in a larger pan, 11 X 13. I did use 4 candy bars though. Flavor was awesome. I will definitely make this many more times, now that I know what to expect!

Very simple but yummy desert! I layered this in a round dish and beat the whipping cream prior to adding to the cream cheese mix. Delicious. Big hit at my party, would make again and recommend.

I don't think I used enough coffee, but oh so good! And so easy.  I too folded the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture just for safety sake to be sure it was light and delicious...  it was! And a big hit with my party of 20 guests.

Okay this dessert is delicious even without the coffee. To make a long story short I bought hazelnut creamer instead of coffee and used that to drizzle my cake, but everyone still loved it. This is awesome and I will be doing some adjustments myself just for experimentation purposes only. Great dessert and we will be having it again.

Wonderful recipe and so very easy. Today I made a larger version for a church function(to serve approx 35)I used a 12x20 inch pan. baked one angel food cake in the bottom and followed the recipe by increasing the cream cheese to 5 pkges and then adjusted the syrup and cool whip instead of whipping cream. Topped it with a swirl of syrup and crushed chocolate covered skor bites. Looks perfect!

very easy to make and a real crowd pleaser - i got yums all around, everyone really enjoyed it!  i too folded in the whipped cream which worked great. i actually made this twice, and the second time i cut the sugar in half - it really is sweet enough without so much sugar. also, i used marscapone instead of cream cheese which was amazing, but i'm sure either would be yummy.

My guests loved it.  The recipe was great, but I didn't use enough of the "mousse" in the layers (resulting in thin layers and leftover mousse). Use all of the mousse that the recipe makes.  :)

A very nice & different dessert.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and also layered mine.  I also suggest using a good pound cake. It really makes all the difference!

This was just ok. By the second day, it wasn't good at all, as the pound cake had a really nasty old coffee taste. Probably will not make again.

perhaps you didn't whip the whipping cream until it formed.  Whipping cream needs to have air whipped into it and it will stiffen the rest of the ingredients.
Try this again - I think you'll like it!

Yum!  This is amazing.  I used toffee baking chips b/c I couldn't find the candy bars.

This dessert was pretty easy and very good!  I made this in a 9x13 pan. Since I made it in a larger pan, I used 2 pound cakes. I took other reviewers advice and cut the cake in thin slices and made 2 layers.  I did notice that the cake is a little soggy from the coffee, but it's not too bad. Overall, it turned out very well.

This was pretty good. I think the pound cake got too wet by the coffee, but maybe that's the way tiramisu is supposed to be. I made it for a banquet at my daughter's school and came home with an empty dish so it must've made a good impression on everyone else!!!

What's not to love?  I had to please some weight conscious guests so I used light cream cheese, left out most of the sugar and replaced the Whipped cream with light Cool Whip. I also mixed 1/4 cup Kahlua in with the coffee.  It was  delicious and the effort to lighten it up was much appreciated.

Very good.  The stronger the coffee you use the stronger the coffee taste so if you want it to be subtle don't use strong coffee like it suggests.  I may make the coffee a little weaker next time.

Based on the other reviews, it must be me. This turned out awful: the chocolate whipping cream & cream cheese combo would not stiffen. I tried to salvage it but in the end just threw out the whole thing. As a consideration to others, maybe try sweetened cocoa powder instead of syrup as sometimes the syrups are designed for milk and not whipping!

I loved the dessert but made some time saving changes. Instead of sugar and whipping cream, I used light cool whip from the freezer section at the grocery store. Next time I'm going to try thicker cake slices. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent dessert. I am a huge tiramisu and trifle fan.  This is a nice combination of the two and should only be prepared in a trifle dish just like the photo shows!  I made this twice within two weeks.  The first time was very good but the second time was superb.  The difference was the consistency of the whipping cream.  I also whipped the cream before folding into the cream cheese mixture.  The first time the whipped cream was extremely heavy and dense and made the filling more like icing.  The second time, I used a different brand and it was much lighter and creamier. The only other change I made was to use half the amount of sugar as others suggested and it was still plenty sweet.  Took it to church and received comments like, "the best trifle I've ever had".

I had to buy a trifle dish to make it work but everyone loved it. I couldn't believe that 8 people could finish the WHOLE thing (with second and third helpings). I layer EVERYTHING each time and drizzle chocolate syrup on the top to make it pretty!

A truly excellent dessert.  I made this for Christmas and it went over very well with numerous requests for the recipe.  I couldn't buy any poundcake as the stores were all sold out so I made buttermilk poundcake from this site in 2 loaf pans.  I couldn't find any chocolate covered toffee bits so I put 2 dairy milk with toffee in the food processor.  I also whipped the cream first and then whipped the cream cheese and chocolate and then mixed the two together.  I layered everything twice.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

Fast, easy and delicious! No need to whip the cream separately - it whips up thick and fluffy tossed in with the other ingredients.

Served this at Thanksgiving. In addition to the recipe, I added a handful of toffee bits before putting on the topping. It gave it a little bit more 'zing.'

Awesome dessert! I added Kahlua into the coffee mixture, used only 1 cup whipping cream, and folded into cream cheese mixture. Make sure you mix your cream cheese mixture until all the sugar is incorporated, otherwise, you will feel the grains of sugar.

I love tiramisu!  However, I HATE coffee, so instead I use chocolate milk.  Normally I make with strawberries and chocolate chips but WOW the heath bars (as suggested by another review) was YUMMY.   I will definitely make again.

This is a super easy recipe and SO DELICIOUS!  I used my Vietnamese coffee press so the coffee would be really strong.  I only added 1/2 cup sugar with the cream cheese and substituted Kahlua for the chocolate syrup.  I poured about a cup of the heavy cream in with it (this made the middle layer).  I then beat the other cup of cream with about 1/4 cup of sugar and added about a 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla extract (next time I think I'll add rum instead).  I spread this mixture on top and put the crushed up Heath bar on last.  All you other alcoholics out there will love it this way...lol!

I have made this 3 times, and it is always wonderful!!  However, the 2nd and 3rd time, I changed up the recipe.  First double your ingredients to fill a trifle bowl.  Second, if u are dieting, try it this way: use 3 or packages of lady fingers instead of pound cake, second use phili fat free cream chz, use fat free cool whip instead of whip cream, and top the trifle by sprinkling cinamon, coconut, and choc syrup drizzle over a thin layer of coolwhip.  it is fantastic, and no one thought this was low fat until i said so.  Everyone thought it was so decadent!!!

The dessert was great! Very easy to make too. I layered mine in a trifle bowl and it looked awesome. I used 3 (1.4 oz) candy bars to put in the 2 layers and one on top. Tasted almost like real tiramisu. I also baked my own pound cake. It was a big hit this past easter!

Wow!  Great recipe.  I made this for a dinner party of 13 people (put it in a trifle dish) and there was barely any left over!  I loved how quick and easy this was to make too.  Some people said that it should have been called a mocha trifle rather than a tiramisu dessert, but regardless -- it was yummy!

I made this for Christmas dessert. It turned out SO well! I made my own pound cake the night before and also layered it in a trifle bowl. As advised by other reviewers I whipped the whipping cream first. I used instant coffee and skor bits which worked fine. Would definately make this again!

I have had this recipe "in waiting" for a few years and finally made it this weekend.  OMG---it is so easy and SO good!  I didn't think mixing the whipping cream into the rest of the topping ingred. would work but it does, you just have to beat it for a few minutes (maybe 5?)  Excellent!  Will definitely make again.

I also whipped the heavy cream separate (thanks for the advice) it was a HUGE hit, and I also made 2 layers.

This stuff was great. I made it for Mothers Day and everybody loved it. They all wanted the recipe. I had forgotten to put coffee on the second layer and nobody could tell. I did use alot more toffee sprinkled on top and the middle. Thank you for a great recipe

This was fantastic! I could not find a frozen pound cake, so I found a pound cake mix and made that instead. It was perfect! As mentioned in other posts, I whipped the cream separately then folded in the cream cheese mix. I also used Kahlua rather than coffee. I layered it all in a trifle bowl. It was such a delicious and easy dessert!

Awesome!  My kind of recipe - easy and delicious.  I brought it to a potluck dinner party and it was gone in 30 seconds - with other desserts untouched beside it!  I followed others' recommendations and beat the whipped cream separately (that was the hardest part of this creation!) and folded it into the cream cheese mixture.  I also halved the chocolate syrup to make way for Bailey's, and layered in a trifle dish.  Next time I think I may try Kahlua instead of coffee for an added kick.

I made this for a family dinner at my mom's house, and everyone LOVED it.  My Dad took the leftovers to his local hang-out, and it was gone faster than anyone could blink.  So fast in fact, that I didn't get a piece.  I doubled the recipe and layered it as others recommended. I only put the coffee on the bottom layer using decalf vanilla creme flavored coffee.  I added the chocolate sauce to the first layer of cream filling and 1 tsp of vanilla to the second layer. I put a small pitcher of Bailey's Irish Cream on the table for anyone who wanted to add liquor to their dessert only because my brother would have killed me if I had liquored up his kids.  :)  It was fantastic and I will be forced to make it for every family dinner to come!!!

This recipe is always a hit!  I make it often. Once, when I didn't have whipping cream on hand, a tub of cool whip worked to substitute.  Quick and easy, and tastes wonderful!

I used one tub cool whip extra creamy in place of whipping cream and reduced sugar to 1/2 cup.  Perhaps use powdered sugar next time to reduce graininess???  Layered cake in pan reserving small amount of coffee to drizzle over top cake layer.  Only put toffee on top.

This recipe is easy to follow. I did not have a problem with it turning out too runny. I did find this recipe to be too sweet. I will make this again but with less sugar. Everyone loved it and about half found it to be too sweet while the other half said it was perfect.

To the previous reviewer...step 2 are your direction.  Your confusion is likely that the last two sentences of the 2nd step are the same as the 1st two sentences of the third step.  Combine all ingredients in step 2, spread them on the cake, then add the candy on top of that.  Good luck.

This was good but a little too sweet. If I make it again I will try just 3/4 cup sugar. I did use a 2 pound loaf of pound cake cut thin and in two layers. There was plenty of filling for this amount of cake and I didn't double the coffee but next time I will because the cake was a little dry. It tasted much better the next day, so make it a day ahead if you can!

Was a bit disappointed, would only make again in a pinch and perhaps thin pound cake and layer twice with cream mixture alternating.  Cream mixture itself pretty tasty as a moussy dessert on its own for week day treat, maybe, not for guests however.  Not bad, just not outstanding, thanks anyway!

I'm making this tonight (just gave it a 5 because I couldn't post & not rate--seemed to be a number in agreement with others) & have a question:  What is the frosting?  I see cake layer, cream cheese layer & toffee bits.  Is the cream cheese layer considered the "frosting" or has something been omitted from the recipe?

This was a fabulous dessert, and the day after I served it, I was asked to make more because we had ran out.  It was so easy to make!  I cut the pound cake up pretty small and thin and added more coffee to the mixture to give more of a mocha taste.  For the topping I bought some Heath Bar Ball Bites and my family had great fun busting them all up for the dessert.  I think I will try Bailey's or Frangelico maybe sometime, but so far this was great and a quick dessert to make when your oven is full of everything else for dinner.

Good recipe.  I did substitute the Bailey's for syrup, and whipped the cream seperately, chilled it for two hours, and it turned out a very nice consistency.  However, while this recipe was good, it was not anything fantastic. I felt it was missing something, it just did not have any punch like I thought it would.  It was a nice fast, easy dessert.  Thank you.

The frosting was a tiny bit runny, but firmed up when refrigerated.  Also, I whipped the cream seperately and folded in, as others suggested.  Big hit at my dinner last night!!  Will definately make again.

Yum yum!!!  I used chai instead of espresso since I am allergic to coffee.  I was worried when I mixed up the topping becuase it was a little runny when I poured it over the cake;  however, it was perfect after I chilled it.  Absolutely delicious, I am sure to make this one over and over!

Love this!!  After reading many reviews and suggestions, I made the following changes: I made 2 layers so I needed almost 2 pound cakes (from grocery store bakery), added 1/4 cup Bailey's Irish Cream to the coffee, cut sugar to 3/4 cup.  I whipped the cream separately and folded into chocolate cream cheese mixture, drizzled chocolate sauce on top, and used about 6 oz of  smashed up Heath bars for the toffee. I served it in an oval 2.5 quart casserole dish, and it fit perfectly.

It was really good and it didn’t take long to make it. I made it for the 4th of July and it was a favorite. I did not change the recipe but, the next time I make it I will use half cup of sugar instead of 1 cup.

Yummy! Made a few changes. I used a packet of chocolate pudding mix  & 1/2 cup milk, but no added sugar. I did add chocolate syrup. It was even better the next day. The toffee chips did not get soggy, as others have said. Placed in a trifle bowl, with whipped cream, toffee chips and chocolate syrup drizzled on top, it made an impressive presentation.

This was a hit for my family!   Next time I make it I’ll use more coffee to really soak through the pound cake since there were dry areas.  So yummy though!

I used dark chocolate syrup to add a small tinge of bitterness instead of loading on the sweet. Oh and I used more than 3/4 cup of coffee since the pound cake was super absorbent.

My store didn’t have any chocolate covered Heath bars, so I substituted mixed nut clusters that I pulsed in the processor. I also added some Frangelico to the coffee to really add some more of that nutty flavor.

This was a big hit at our party and super easy to make! I will definitely make it again.  i was a little worried the cream cheese would make it too tart, but you can hardly tell it is made with cream cheese.

The only changes I made were adding an extra big squeeze of the chocolate syrup (because there is no such thing as too much chocolate) before blending, cutting the pound cake into cubes, and layered it in a trifle bowl instead of a pan.

I thought this would make a quick and easy as well as slightly lighter dessert for an Italian themed menu I served for the holidays at work.  While defiantly not tiramisu it did hit enough of the right notes to feel familiar.   I used 16oz sliced pound cake from the bakery section of our grocery store that I cubed and let sit out so it would dry out a bit.  I also used 8oz whipped topping instead of heavy cream to keep it light.  I layered it trifle style in a large bowl starting with the cake drizzled with fresh espresso, then a layer of cream, more cake and espresso, and topped with the remaining cream and a swirl of chocolate syrup.

Wicked sweet, but very good. I used hazelnut coffee. If you have kids make it an earlier dessert...I gave it to my boyfriend's kids after dinner and the coffee and sugar had them racing around the house way past their bed time. Oops....

I made it but instead of adding the heavy whipped cream, I whipped it separately then folded it in. I added some vanilla flavoring, quite a bit because I almost dropped the bottle into the bowl. (I had unexpected company show up that had me nerved up. Lol) It turned out quite well and the only complaint was about the toffee candy bar on top. I loved the  toffee bits personally.

I've made this dessert a few times and each time it only gets better. I use ladyfingers Vs. pound cake and The best is when you use Italian espresso in lieu of any kind of coffee. It lessens the sweetness making it more mocha like. We never have leftovers since everyone pulls out their Tupperware being all too happy to take leftovers.
When I've been able to keep one serving leftover, I love eating it the next morning with a nice hot cup of coffee.

I made this and it took longer to shop for than to make. I know it is a sacrilege among chefs but I folded in cool whip ( a whole tub) instead of whipping cream and it was great. I think if you let the cream cheese warm up you could make this with a fork instead of a blender.  Wouldn't it surprise folks to make this on a camping trip.  Easy easy easy.

I made these in 75 individual servings. I put them in clear plastic cups I found at my local dollar tree. I used fresh vanilla pound cake. I also whipped the cream in my stand mixer for probably 20 minutes because I quadrupled the recipe, mixed everything else separate and then combined the two. I just put a few pieces of cake in the bottem, poured a little coffee that I had mixed with some irish cream creamer on top of the cake, piped with "cream" mix using a gallon bag, and then topped with Heath bars I had crushed in my blender and some chocolate syrup. these are AMAZING!

I have made this several times for big gatherings and for Christmas Eve. It is always a huge hit. I did add an extra 1/2 brick cream cheese, only 1/2 cup sugar and I used two pound cakes. One rater said it was nasty the second day. We didn't find that to be the case, it was just as good day two.

I made this for an engagement party for a couple and most everyone there asked me for the recipe. The only thing I did different was to add some sherry to the coffee when soaking the pound cake. And I made them in individual dessert glasses. Extra work, but they looked so pretty.  And another time I added Chambord. Excellent recipe.

I used mascarpone instead of cream cheese and  sprinkled the top with cocoa instead of mixing in chocolate syrup. Also added a couple of tablespoons kahlua to the coffee. The one thing I would change is slicing the cake into thinner slices and doing 2 layers. The coffee only soaked the very top of the cake slices so the bottom of the slices seemed a little dry.

This was a big hit for my family function. All of them love coffee and sweets, so it was a no brainer that they loved the dessert.

Make sure to whip filling mixture plenty, or it will be runny.

I made this over Christmas. I didn't even get a chance to try it because it was gone so fast. I did adjust the recipe a bit. I used French vanilla cool whip instead of regular. I also sprinkled Heath not only on the top but in each layer. I didn't have chocolate syrup so I made my own from a recipe I found on here with white sugar unsweetened cocoa. The directions also don't tell you what to do with the coffee so I folded it into the chocolate whipped mixture. I used twice as much fresh pound cake instead of the one frozen cake. Seemed to be a big hit. Just wish I could have been a judge haha

My wife is a big Tiramisu fan so I decided to make this for our Italian dinner night. It was outstanding and she was majorly impressed. I just added 1/4 cup of Kahlua to the brewed coffee which gave a nice coffee flavor. Also used the pound cake found in the bakery. Shaved some semi sweet chocolate on top with chocolate drizzle and MAGNIFICO! The wife is already asking me to make it again.

very decadent & well received!! I made this for a group of 30 ladies. I used 2 8oz containers of Marscapone cheese & Mixed it with 1c choc sauce & 1 cup sugar. In a large bowl I whipped a quart of whipping cream with 1c sugar. Then folded in the cheese blend. 1c Strong coffee worked well(brewed 6T grounds + 1c water)+ 2T Kahlua, & painted lady fingers with a basting brush. I used 4 boxes of Trader Joe's Lady Fingers. I layered it in a trifle bowl, following directions, using the bag of Heath Bitz. At the end, I covered the top of the bowl with remaining cream, sprinkles of toffee bitz from the bag & shaved Choc. Made it the night before and it worked well. We sprinkled shaved Choc & the plain toffee bitz from the bag too, on each serving for some added love.  Will make this again for sure!!!  Thanks!!

sugar  OOPS!  I forgot the sugar and the stuff still tastes good so far.  Always love taking the recipes to a personal level SO I did not have chocolate syrup but did have cocoa.  Used a  9 x 13 pan and two small # cakes, making two layers.  Used a large large container of cool whip and 2 pkg of cream cheese and 1/4 cup of cocoa and a small jar of Nutella and about 2 T of Kaluah.  Not sweet but very smooth and tangy.  Put a layer of whippy between each layer of cake and will add the toppings tomorrow which will be a sprinkle of cocoa and the toffee chips and a drizzle of butterscotch topping CAUSE that is what I have on hand....hope to take a picture if I remember!

This looks impressive when served in a trifle dish. I made it for an Italian themed party and it was enjoyed by all. As some other reviewers I used Bailey's instead of the chocolate syrup. A good dessert.

As a great dessert, this is very good. It does have way too much sugar in it, however. Also, it's not tiramisu. Tiramisu uses lady fingers and marscopone, not pound cake and cream cheese. Also other items are different in real tiramisu, but as a good cake dessert, it is good and easy to fix.

Served this at a dinner party and got great reviews. I too, whipped the cream separately and folded it into chocolate mixture. Used Kaluha rather than chocolate. I could not find chocolate toffee bits, so I bought toffee bits and melted chocolate chips over the top, like a toffee chocolate bark. Then once cooled,  just broke them up and used to sprinkle on top. Suggest cutting back a bit on the sugar. Delicious and makes enough for an army.

It was good. I used decaf vanilla flavored coffee and I also followed the other reviews suggestion to beat the heavy cream seperately and then fold it into the cheese/chocolate mixture.

I love this dessert.  Very quick and easy. It's hard for me to make a traditional tiramisu because, in this rural area, packaged ladyfingers are hard to come by. And I only find mascarpone occasionally. Once I made it with angel food cake - also delicious.

This is my first time ever reviewing a recipe, but this one deserves comment! Awesome dessert...I layered it in a trifle bowl like some other reviewers, making it beautiful as well as delish! I did make some alterations: used some leftover ganache that I warmed in the microwave instead of the choc syrup, and used equal parts strong coffee and  Amarula cream liqueur instead of all coffee (and I didn't need the full 3/4 c.)This dessert is going to have heavy rotation on our special dessert menu, because our family and guests LOVED it!

i'm not sure if it's fair to rate this recipe, but i want to give it kudos since it gave me the idea.  i had leftover cookies and cream pudding and tons of home-made whip cream.  i took a bowl, covered it with plastic wrap, placed thick slices of pound cake, brushed it with cappuccino drink (with milk and sugar), dumped the pudding, repeated cake and cappuccino, then filled it with whip cream.  covered, and chilled overnight.  flipped the assemble on a plate, remove plastic, and frosted dome cake with whip cream.  ~nice.  everyone was raving about the layers.  and it wasn't at all "too sweet," just perfect.  THANK YOU for sharing your ideas.

This was really easy and yummy.  I used splenda for the sugar and coolwhip lite and it was great.  I also layer the pound cake and coolwhip mixture.  On one layer I squeezed a fresh orange worked out great.

The flavor seems great.  But it is very soupy - it will have to be eaten with a spoon or sucked through a straw.  What did I misinterpret?

This was pretty good, although I changed some things.  First of all, I used 2 frozen pound cakes instead of one, cut them into thin slices, and made it into a 3 layer cake (in a 9x9 pan).  There seemed to be plenty of whipped filling for this to work.  I put toffee crumbles in every layer and poured a small amount of coffee over every layer, too.  As suggested, I whipped the cream until stiff peaks formed, then gently folded it into the chocolate mixture, and this seemed to work really well.  I used lite cream cheese and couldn't tell the difference (not that this was health food anyway! :)).  It was pretty rich... not sure all of my guests loved it but most people seemed to enjoy it and my fiance loved it, so that's important!

I consider myself  an advanced cook and was very dissapointed with this recipe.  I did substitute lady fingers for the pound cake, but this should have no bearing on the filling (which I whipped for quite a while-stiff peaks had formed) and overall look.

I made this for a shower - everyone liked it but I thought it was a little too sweet for my taste.  I'll try adding more coffee / espresso and not the whole amount of sugar next time.

This was unbelievably easy and fast! Perfect compliment to any dinner. I like the Bailey’s idea and will try it next time.
