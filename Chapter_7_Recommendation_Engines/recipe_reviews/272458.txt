I had a homemade roasted chicken that I desperately needed to use up. This recipe is the solution.  I replaced a couple of ingredients given some food restrictions in my household. I used red pepper for yellow pepper, did not use red pepper flakes. I used a pinch of cayenne only and used canned diced roasted tomatoes. This was very good. I think it can use a bit less of some of the ingredients but then again the outcome is very good and I love the fact that it came out in a happy medium texture: not too soupy nor too thick. Will make it again!
