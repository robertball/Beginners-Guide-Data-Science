I happened to LOVE this recipe! I just whipped it up for movie night (but made it plenty in advance to allow the flavors to develop) I had to sneak a bite though! Very good, cheesy, and creamy! I was a little hesitant to try this recipe because there is only one other review, but I am very happy that i did... it will be used many times in the future!

Very good recipe.  I made this for a gathering of friends.  My friend's comment was "Yummo!"  (I think he is a Rachel Ray fan.)
