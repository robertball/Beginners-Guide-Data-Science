OK.. so I think I've pretty much PERFECTED..I did it last night and it is the best home made mac and cheese I've ever had! I used 1 3/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup heavy cream.. this made it extra creamy and yummy. I also blended in 2 cups of the suggested cheddar as well as 1 cup of provolone and 1 cup of mozzeralla...this made it even more creay and cheesy... I omitted the breadcrumb topping (TOO much breadcrumbs for me) and generously added more cheddar, mozzeralla, and provolone to the top before puting it into the oven... If you like easy, cheesy, and creamy mac and cheese..you will love this recipe with these modifications!

.Love this recipe....BUT...7 ounces of pasta would barely feed 2 people in my family (we're German i.e. big eaters) Plus that seemes like a lot of sauce for the ammount of pasta.. So I upped the butter to a 1/2 cup and left everything else the same and used a 1 pound box of macaroni.  It was PERFECT!!

I've never made macaroni and cheese from scratch before, so I was excited to try it out. I was looking for a recipe that had ingredients I'd readily have on hand. No specialty cheeses. I really like the bread crumb topping. The actual mac and cheese was a little too cream cheese flavored for me. I like rich, flavorful foods and the cream cheese made it too bland for me. I'm going to keep looking around for other recipes, but if I do make this again, I'll down the cream cheese to 6oz and up the cheddar to 2 & 1/2 to 3 cups. Also, when I made this, instead of putting parsley (which I'm not fond of) in with the bread crumbs I put garlic salt and paprika. Yum!

This is the very first time that I am sorry that I followed the advice of others.  So many other reviewers said that they halved the cream cheese because it was too strong of a flavor.  I purposely chose this recipe because I like cream cheese.  But after reading all the reviews, I was afraid to use the full amount of cream cheese called for.  Although this mac & cheese came out very good, it wasn't at all special.  It tasted just like every other mac & cheese.  I couldn't taste one iota of cream cheese.  Next time I'm going to use the full amount called for.

I love macaroni and cheese so I had to try this.  I'm not too crazy about cream cheese and was a little concerned about others complaining of an overpowering cream cheese flavor, so I substituted 8 ozs of sour cream, which is what I normally use in my mac and cheese.  I also added about 4 more ounces of shredded cheddar cheese.  This recipe turned out creamy, cheesy and delicious.

WOW, this was great! My fiance loved it and ate leftovers 3 days in a row!  I did saute a little garlic and onion then added a dash of Red Hot (or tabasco)  to spice it up a little. It was great and I will make it often.

I was not impressed with this macaroni and cheese.  I followed the recipe but it was VERY bland.  I won't make this one again.

A++++ Loved this recipe! I did 1/2 the amount of cream cheese and add an extra cup of (sharp) cheddar. It was very creamy and cheesy!

My very first time making a homemade Mac n Cheese and everyone JUST LOVED it! Very creamy! I did use 1 full pound of noodles and added a cup of white cheddar and a cup of monterey jack in addition to the regular cheddar. I also added finely chopped BACON! Best Mac n Cheese ever if you like it creamy!

Besides using Ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs, I followed this exact recipe and I loved it! I do prefer a creamier mac & cheese though. The fiance requested that I put in more cheddar next time. I might play around with white cheddar next time also.

I am a huge mac and cheese lover and make different recipes depending on what I'm in the mood for and how it will be served.  For example, as far as flavor goes, my favorite is Down Home Macaroni and Cheese from this website (with more cheddar and not baked), but it doesn't reheat that great.  I was looking for a baked mac and cheese recipe that is creamy and reheats well.  This one is definitely it!  I made a few changes, such as using 8 ounces of macaroni instead of 7, adding 1/2 t more salt and and extra cup of cheddar, using 1 1/2 teaspoon dijon (more would have been overpowering), and sprinkling the top with more cheddar and buttered, crushed cornflake crumbs because we like them much more than bread crumbs.  I love my mac and cheese to be really cheesy though so the extra cheese isn't necessary if you don't love it.  If you want a creamy mac and cheese (which can be difficult to attain with baked recipes), you need to leave the pasta amount as written.  It will look excessively saucy before you bake it, but after baking the noodles will have absorbed some of the sauce and it will be perfect.  We ate the last of the leftovers tonight, 5 days later, and it's still nice and creamy!  Love this recipe!

Delicious stomach stuffing meal. My husband didn't love it. He thought it was too thick. There wasn't a ton of flavor to it, but, to me, it was thick and hearty. Very home cooked feel. I added diced deli ham to the mix to add some protein to it. I would make it again for sure.

My family really liked this with additions!!! After reading the reviews, many stated this was a bit dry.  I added 1/2 cup of cheese con queso dip with japelenos and 1/4 cup of sour cream. Will definitely make again.

We have just finished eating this for dinner and nobody really thought it was anything special. I sauteed a small onion and 2 cloves of garlic for a little more flavour and kept everything else pretty much the same. I didn't add all of the bread crumb mix as it was a lot, maybe only added 1/3 cup...it was OK, tasted like it was missing a spice. Not 100% sure if I would make this again?! ...Oh, 7 ounces of pasta is no where near enough pasta for the amount of sauce, so I cooked 2 1/2 cups of dry pasta which seemed to be a perfect amount for the sauce made.

I had been looking high and low for a Macaroni and Cheese recipe, and had yet to find a good one, until I found this one. I decided to try it since the ingredients included cream cheese, that's what did it for me! The cream cheese makes a whole world of difference in the taste of the macaroni. I will definitely use this recipe from now on!

This was good but not the best.  I liked the addition of the cream cheese.  I used crushed buttery crackers in the topping instead of bread crumbs and sharp cheddar.  I might make it again.  Thanks!!

I LOVE mac n' cheese and my husband HATES mac n' cheese.  I am only picky in that I don't like it grainy and I don't like it with Velveeta.  This recipe was easy to make (minimal mess!!) and it was g-o-o-d.  All 4 of our kids at it and loved it (even after the disappointment that it wasn't coming out of a blue box.)  The biggest shocker was that my husband raved about it all through dinner - only pausing to take seconds and thirds.  Definitely a keeper!!!!!!!

This was a big hit in our home.  I tweaked it in the following ways:

I used 1.5 cups 2% milk and .5 cup heavy cream.
I used 4 oz. cream cheese and 3 cups of cheddar cheese, plus a half a block of white sharp cheddar.
I left out the breadcrumb mixture all together.

I will definitely make this again.  Thanks VPattison for sharing.

This was wonderful! I made a few changes because we wanted to try a jalapeno mac and cheese... we left out the dijon and added 1/2cup diced mild (jarred) jalapenos and a sprinkle of cayenne. SO GOOD! And the leftovers were even better after it had time to sit and have the flavors soaked in.

THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME! Every time I make it I get rave reviews. I don't understand why some people are having a hard time with it?? As far as the breadcrumbs I use the Vigo brand "Italian" bread crumbs...I do not bother with the fresh parsley because the Italian breadcrumbs add enough! Also I always use fat free milk and Neufchatel Cream Cheese...no one ever even notices. I will always continue to use this recipe because it is so delicious!

I agree with many other reviewers that this was on the bland side.  When I reheated it I added some extra sharp cheddar and smoked gouda that helped alot....

Made this with a wonderful sharp white cheddar, and added an additional cup of it than the recipe called for (I like my m&c cheeeesey!).  I was out of dijon so added a bit of dry ground mustard and a few shakes of Worcestershire.  Took it for a potluck and received lots of love for it!  Highly recommend using italian-style breadcrumbs (either that or add a bit of garlic powder/salt to the recipe).  I think this is a great base recipe that you can have a lot of fun with.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a family gathering and it merited 2nds and 3rds. I used a 16 oz box, added 1 cup each of colby and mozzarella and 1/4 cup parmesan. I subbed mustard powder for digon. Added more milk to desired consistance and only used 1/2 cup bread crumbs.   It was good enough to mix and eat without baking, so I had a small bowl before the rest went into the oven. I topped it with a little more mix of shredded cheeses also.   Top notch comfort food.

Great recipe! I eliminated the cream cheese only because I didn't have it on hand. Then I followed ChefNan's advice on adding a 1/2 cup of butter, and 1lb of elbow macs.  

Also, next time I will use only a cup of breadcrumbs...2 cups was a little too much.

VERY tasty and oh....I added a bit of extra cheese because we are cheese freaks.

This is fabulous to the point I am almost speechless! I knew this would be great when I saw dijon mustard. It is my own secret weapon when I make cheesy broccoli soup from scratch at home. The mustard is really what makes this extra special. I added more dijon, salt and fresh cracked pepper and the only slight change I made was heavy cream in place of milk for a more wholesome and filling taste. I couldn't stop licking the the spoon from the cheese mixture when I was done.

Absolutely delicious as is. Here are a few changes I made the second time around: I used 4 oz of cream cheese and 4 oz of sour cream and did not use butter with the topping, but simply sprinkled bread crumbs on top. They pretty much absorbed the fat from the cheese etc. during baking. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I made a few changes to this recipe. Instead of regular cheddar, I used white sharp cheddar and instead of bread crumbs used ritz crackers. I also added a little bit more salt and pepper. It came out fabulous. I think I will keep this one going.

very creamy and one of the best I have ever had. easy to make as well. 
I tweaked it just a bit and added some Velveeta cheese along with the cheddar. I also layered it with broccoli, it was very good. But the next time I make it I am going to add extra cheddar and Velveeta to it.

Very Under-rated. I have tried several other "popular" Mac'NCheese recipes and this one by far wins my vote. Easy, cheesy and great consistency. 

I halved the cream cheese, upped the cheddar and added some spices to my topping. Oh yummy

MMMMMM!!!! Fabulous mac n' cheese! Simple, cravable ingredients. This dish did not last long at my house & we have all been wanting more since it dissapeared, haha. Left off the bread crumb topping. Reheats deliciously. Will definitely be in regular rotation, thanks!...Made again, only with a full 16.oz box of macaroni....I found that there is enough sauce to leave all proportions the same, only double the shredded cheese. Thick, cheesy, yummy...& feeds my family of 6 more effectively! :)

Very, very good and easy to make!!  I only did two things differently.  1) sauteed about a fourth cup of chopped up yellow onion and garlic in butter and 2) I subsituted the cream cheese for sour cream.    This recipe was very creamy, rich in flavor, and perfect for macaroni lovers!

Mmm, delicious. I used about 10 oz of macaroni and 1/2 tsp dry mustard instead of dijon. I didn't use cheddar cheese, it doesn't melt well. Instead I used 1/2 velveeta and 1/2 American/jack blend and even threw a couple slices of provolone in the mix. I added a few drops of Louisiana hot sauce for flavor. Very, very rich and creamy. I didn't bother with bread crumbs.

This is a great recipe and it's a HUGE hit every time I make it! I did make the following alterations: Used 1/2 c of heavy cream with 1 3/4 c of the milk; halved the amount of cream cheese and put in 4 oz of sour cream; doubled the amount of macaroni; doubled the amount of cheese and used sharp cheddar cheese along 8 oz of "Mexican" cheese (prepackaged by Kraft); halved the amount of breadcrumbs. I was amazed at how easy and quick it was to make. And it reheats well in the microwave!

This recipe was a hit for potlucks.  I would have scored it a 5 star, but my kids aren't crazy about it.. but hubby loves loves loves it.  The cream cheese adds a different flavor to it and you can't seem to take just one bite...you have to take 2, then 3,... very tasty.  I made NO changes to the recipe as others suggested and it was fine.

Really good- we all had seconds! I used 2 cups of sharp cheddar, 1 cup mozzarella and 8 oz cream cheese with a full pound of macaroni pasta. The proportions were just right. I only needed 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs for the topping. Don't skip the topping- the extra "crunch" made a big difference!

This is a fantastic recipe! The only reason I gave 4 stars is that I made slight changes. There is FAR too much sauce for only 7 ounces of macaroni; I used a whole pound and still had at least a half cup of extra sauce! I shredded a block of extra sharp cheddar, probably closer to 2.5-3 cups for more flavor. Love this recipe! Will absolutely make again.

I followed other people's modifications and used a whole 16 oz box of pasta, and added used a whole stick of butter (1/2 cup).  There was plenty of cheese sauce to cover all of it.  I also used 3/4 cup of bread crumbs instead of 1 cup, and it was plenty.  With these modications it is 4 stars.

This was by far the best mac I have ever had. I followed others suggestions and added some spices, paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper. I used med chedder and sharp and had italian bread crumbs that put a great touch on top. Under bread crumbs I put a thin layer of sharp cheese and baked extra time so it came out crispy on top! Delicious!

I can't wait to dig in to this! I am rating just on the taste I had before putting it in the oven. Here are the changes I made: I used a full box of macaroni, added about 1/3 cup or so of fresh grated parmesan, about 1/2 cup or so (I never measure additions) of shredded mozzarella, 1 3/4 cups skim milk and 1/4 cup light cream and used 1 1/2 tsp regular yellow mustard and 1/2 tsp sweet hot mustard (Inglehoffer) because that's what I had. I also used 1 tsp dried parsley instead of fresh. I melted the butter then mixed with the bread crumbs and parsley. Lots of changes but I think this is a great recipe that you can be flexible with...

I've been using this site for years and have yet to review a recipe... until now. I've been trying different recipes and variations trying to make the perfect mac & cheese and I think this is it. I made it for my boyfriend last night and said that this batch was the best he's ever had, even better than HIS mothers! Now that's the ultimate compliment if you ask me! Absolutely delicious!

I'm from the south so I know good mac and cheese.  I will say this IS NOT a greasy heavy dish, but rather a rich almost "gourmet" version. I made this with thanksgiving last year for my in-laws from California and they absolutely loved it and I will be making it again this year! Instead of bread crumbs I used crushed Ritz Crackers and you need to use fresh parsley!

Thought this was good, realized after purchasing ingredients that I wanted to make a bigger recipe, so ended up using about a half cup less of cheddar since I didn't buy enough, and adding about 4 slices of American cheese to make up a bit of the difference. Also used Panko breadcrumbs instead for topping....just really like the airy crispiness of those. It ended up being a very rich but delicious meal!

Never cooked homemade mac and cheese before, but this was easy and turned out great.  The family loved it at Easter lunch.  I did read other reviews and used double the amount of elbow noodles, added a cup of blended Italian cheeses, added some garlic powder and cayenne pepper, and used one cup of milk with a half-cup of heavy cream.   My sauce was really thick and gooey.  I assembled the noodles and sauce in the dish and set it in the fridge overnight.  I added 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs and extra cheddar to the top in the morning before I baked it.  Turned out great... thanks for the recipe!

As is, it needed more flavor, but overall loved the consitency. I will have to read other reviewers suggestion for more flavor, maybe a little shallot or something.

I'm a complete beginner when it comes to cooking, I have had many 'oops' in the kitchen (melting noodles) but this recipe was so easy and taste amazing! I made it for my parents who work night shift and they loved it after it was reheated!

Awesome recipe, just like what my mom used to make only with cream cheese in it. I usually add cayenne and garlic salt. New staple in my menu!

As others have said, the cream cheese is a very dominate flavor and feel in this recipe. I love cream cheese but I would use less next time. I didn't find this to be very 'saucy' which is what I was hoping for, instead it was very thick, you could really slice into the macaroni and cheese and have it hold its shape - I think the cream cheese helped this to happen. Would make again with some modifications.

So, this is actually the first time I've reviewed a recipe, but I felt it was very necessary.  I doubled the recipe, doubling everything except for the cream cheese (which I kept 8oz).  I also added a cup of an Italian cheese blend to make up for the cream cheese.  The amount of bread crumbs was a bit overwhelming.  Next time I would either cut that in half, or even a 1/4 of what the recipe calls for.  Other than that, it was ridiculously amazing and very easy.  Next time, I'm going to add either bacon or ham to the mix :)

We changed this up just a little and it was delicious:
1.) Followed the idea of not putting in 2 cups of milk, but rather 1 3/4 cups of milk and 1/4 cup of heavy cream.
2.) Once we added the macaroni and cheese, we added a teaspoon of truffle oil.
3.) For toppings, we mixed French's Fried Onions, breadcrumbs and fresh chopped parsley - shook in the French's can - and placed on top.

Think for next time, we will add small bacon pieces but still delicious!!!

I wanted to see what cream cheese would be like in mac & cheese, but it's not for me.  I will use a different recipe next time.
EDIT:  Tried it again the next day, and it seemed to taste better.  So I suggest making it the day before you eat it, and just re-heat!  My toddler gobbles it up, so I might make it again just to have something on hand for her  ;)

Wonderful recipe that I've been using/had for years. My kids love it! I do leave out the bread crumbs, butter, and parsley the last times I've made it but I've also tried it with and it's good, too.

Best mac 'n' cheese EVER. Hands down. My husband loves it, the kids can't get enough. I usually make it without the topping though, because I haven't had much luck making it the correct consistency and to be honest, it just seems to take away from the deliciousness of the macaroni itself! It's so easy and quick, too :)

I have made this 2 or 3 times and it is always good.  The last time I made it I did not have enough milk so I used Carnation Evaporated milk and everyone Raved!  So I will stick with the evaporated milk version from now on.  Thanks for such a great and easy recipe.

I'm not sure if it was the cream cheese or the dijon that made this taste just a bit off.

This turned out so good! Delish! It was super easy to make.  I only used 1/2 a block of cream cheese because that was all I had on hand anyway and I added extra cheese.
I will make this again and again!

Very easy to make, but even with the addition of onion and sharp cheddar, I thought it was just a wee bit on the bland side.

OK, was disappointed in this because it was dry to me.  I was asked to bring a side dish to a party (something the kids would like).  There was very little eaten of it.

Delicious comfort food!  Creamy, tangy (due to the mix of cheddar and cream cheese) and flavorful.  BOTH the adults AND the kids liked this which is always a challenge to find foods that the entire household agrees on.  I'm not sure why some of the reviewers commented that the recipe is bland.  I would say it is far from bland and far from ordinary mac 'n cheese.  
I mixed panko crumbs with a little melted butter for an added CRUNCH.

A great start!  We prefer our mac & cheese with some kick, so I added about 1/2 t. chipotle pepper and a generous amount of Frank's Hot Sauce. The consistency is good, and the recipe is easy, so it's likely to remain our starting point for mac & cheese.

Pretty good, I did not have enough cream cheese so I reduced by about 3 ounces.  Extremely creamy.  Reduced cheddar and used some white cheddar .

This recipe is really delicious. After hearing some people saying it was bland I cut the cream cheese amount in half and added 3-1oz slices of pepper jack cheese in addition to the sharp Cheddar. This kicked it up a notch and still had a very light creamy texture...Fantastic recipe! I've made homemade mac and cheese before and never had this great result. Thanks for a delicious recipe. It's a keeper.

This was perfect! Best mac and cheese I've ever made! I added a couple of slices of velveeta cheese along with the cheddar. Instead of cream cheese I used a cup of half and half and 1 1/2 cups of 2% milk (instead of 2 cups of milk). I used Italian breadcrumbs. It already had parsley in the mixture. Was fabulous..kids and hubby loved it!

This recipe is yummy! I made it for my son's 7 y.o. football team's end of the season party and they all gave it a thumbs up! The parents loved it too! The only thing I changed was I used equal parts of milk and half and half which made it richer. I also added some fresh parmesan cheese on top mixed in with the bread crumbs. I have been trying to find a great homeade mac and cheese recipe and I am using this one again for Thanksgiving tomorrow! It heats up well for leftovers too! Can't wait!

WOW!!! Amazing dish.  Next time I think I might try mozzarella cheese (loved the flavour of Dijon & found cheddar almost over powered this) & will probably not bake as long next time, & add extra cheese to the top.  Such a hit, my company asked for the recipe!

I used 3 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar, and used only half the cream-cheese (add a drizzle more of milk).  I'm not really a fan of breadcrumbs, but my bf loves the topping. So, I spread breadcrumbs (already toasted, from the store) on a baking sheet, drizzle melted butter (or olive oil) over them and bake in preheated oven for less than 4 minutes. Makes them extra crispy without that mealy texture.

I went with other reviewers and doubled the pasta. I used elbow noodles and it cooked up to a large casserole size, more than enough for just the two of us. Instead of an appetizer, it became the main dish. I omitted the breadcrumb topping because I don't like it. I followed the recipe exactly other than that. I didn't think the cream cheese was overpowering- the mustard was. But it's probably a preference thing since I didn't grow up on it having mustard in it. Next time I might only put in 1 tsp of Dijon. I added a few dashes of hotsauce which you don't taste over the cheese. I also added extra pepper. Oh, the sauce is a lot, I'd only use half the sauce with the amount of pasta it made, or double the pasta but keep the sauce the same.

Awesome! Husband said best ever. Minimal changes though. Used 14 oz macaroni and did not double any other ingrediants. Instead of 2c. of milk I used 1c. cream 1c. skim. Used 1 block of chedder and shredded myself, will probably use 1-1/2 next time.  For the bread crumbs I just toasted 4 pieces of bread and used my food processor to grind them up and then I mixed some parm in it.  Need the the large pyrex dish instead of the small. Soo good!

I never bother with the bake off portion of mac and cheese recipes.  They always turn into a dry mass of pasta and curd matter.  That is fine if you like that but melty cheese gooiness relies on a fairly high moisture content which just evaps under the oven heat.  So if it is a crunchy bread crumb top you like just hit it under the broiler for a minute or so.  I always just make some mac pasta and a nice bechamel based cheese sauce and mix them up.  Sometimes I will chop up some nice thick slice porchetta and mix it in also for a twist.

Followed recipe as stated, except doubled the macaroni and butter as suggested by another reviewer.  Don't listen to the people saying to reduce the cream cheese!  It is not overpowering at all and is needed!  Soooo good!

My husband loved this..maybe because he helped make it! We both give this 4 stars because we feel that maybe there was just a tad too much cream cheese in it. Like the cream cheese over-powered the flavor of the other cheese. Husband says that for next time, he would perhaps toss in some grated parmesan cheese into the bread crumb mixture. Thanks for sharing this recipe..we will be making this again!!

Loved this!  I hardly ever alter a recipe the first time (I like to try it as written once) but this time I read reviews and used 1 lb of pasta.  It was perfect!  Our guests loved this dish.  Will make again for sure!

I have never made it from scratch, so I thought this was a great recipe for me start with. I pretty much followed the recipe, except I added a bit more salt and pepper as suggested, and instead of breadcrumbs, I used crushed cheese-its. It is now one of my fiance's favorite dishes for dinner. To make it a little healthier, I use fat free milk, reduced fat cream cheese, and some light sour cream.

7 ounces of macaroni is not sufficient for the amount of sauce this recipe makes, nor is it enough for 6 servings. Conversely, I found the 8 ounces of cream cheese to be twice as much as is really necessary, as well the crumb topping, which could be reduced by at least a third. I would add a few tablespoons of parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of real bacon bits to the topping. Flavor was subtle, texture of the sauce was pleasantly creamy. Flaws notwithstanding, we enjoyed this overall. Thank you.

My favorite thing to make is Macaroni and Cheese, I have tried probably 20 different recipes and I ended my search with this one, it is the best recipe! My family loves it, I usually have to make a double batch so there are leftovers for lunch the next day. My 18 month old eats it up. The only thing I do differently is I use a pound of pasta, add bacon and top it off with Parmesan cheese instead of the bread crumb mixture, it's a hit every time!

Good base recipe for a yummy mac & cheese. I changed things up a bit, and am VERY SATISFIED with the outcome. I halved the cream cheese, and added much more grated cheese... sharp cheddar, mild cheddar and parmesan. I eased up on the dijon a bit and added more fresh cracked black pepper. I didn't have bread crumbs, so I used Ritz like another reviewer suggested. & finally I melted some fresh garlic in my butter as the final drizzle... garlic can really bring something from bland to wow. Scrumptious.

I made this for a family get together and all the mac and cheese love LOVED IT. I used extra sharp cheddar and 8 oz of macaroni instead of 7oz. I topped it with crushed saltines with the butter and a little paprika. I put the dish together the day before, storing it in the fridge, then baked it 1 hr and a half at 350, since it was cold.

Great recipe!   I changed it up a bit by reducing the cream cheese by half and adding extra sharp cheddar and jack.   For the topping I used panko and mixed in cheddar cheese which really gave the topping some more texture and flavor. Awesome mac n' cheese!!!!!!

This was a nice recipe. I used more macaroni than the recommended in the recipe and my bake came out too dry. I would be tempted to add more cheese like others suggest but not mozzerella because that particular cheese is very stringy. Perhaps more milk or half-n-half will make it creamier next time.

Creamy warm comfort food!  I really liked the subtle flavor of the dijon mustard.  I used skim milk. In addition to the cheddar, I tossed in some colby and muenster cheeses.  I will probably add some garlic and cayenne next time.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

My new go-to recipe for mac n cheese! The ultimate comfort food. My modifications: I shredded a 1 lb. wheel of aged white cheddar; I used all but a couple of handfuls in the dish and reserved the rest to sprinkle on top before baking. Completely omitted the breadcrumb mixture. Used 12 oz. of small shell pasta, and given the amount of sauce the recipe makes feel I could've used the whole box. Added about 6 oz. of whipped cream cheese. Gave the béchamel sauce a few healthy shakes of Tabasco  (my son said he would've liked this better without the Tabasco sauce, but I felt the recipe would've been bland otherwise.) 20 full minutes in the oven was needed to make it bubbly and golden brown on top.

I was looking for a recipe like my Moms...shocked when I saw cream cheese (ugh) so I substitued velveeta and also used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1 1/2 cups milk and also used panko-much lighter, not salty and great crispy topping. Will do as others said next time and add more xtra sharp cheddar and maybe some mozzarella and dash hot sauce! Hubby loved it!

This came out beautifully creamy.  Unfortunately, it had no flavor - and I even used sharp cheddar cheese.  The only thing I could taste was the dijon mustard, which wasn't particularly good. I don't know what I would do to get a "cheesier" flavor.  I think I'll try a different recipe next time.

Excellent, thank you! I used whole milk and reduced fat cream cheese (contradictory I know, but all I had on hand), and it turned out fabulous. I also chopped up a little ham I had in the freezer and mixed that in with it. I did use a whole box of the macaroni (12 oz?) so that we'd have leftovers for lunch--there was more than enough cheese sauce. Super creamy and not gritty like my old recipe. I liked the bread crumb topping, some posters didn't--although I used Panko bread crumbs (the Japanese style that are a little lighter than progresso style bread crumbs) and they were perfectly browned & crispy. This is a favorite! My 3 year old said, "Dad, don't take those leftovers to work, I liked this dinner and I want to eat it tomorrow". Bravo!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because it is a good easy base to make it your own.  I doubled the recipe exactly to accommodate 1 box of Dreamfields macaroni and it was not dry at all.  I did use whole milk and a blend of mild and sharp cheddars, as well as an Italian cheese mix (mozzarella, provolone, and parmesan).  In addition to the teaspoons of seasonings recommended, I also added another teaspoon of garlic powder and sea salt.  My only complaint is the flour...seems like I couldn't cook the flour flavor out of the sauce even though I made sure the butter/flour was cooked and bubbling for several minutes...next time I will half it.  I also omitted the breadcrumbs.

This was super, simple and yummy! I used the 1/3 less fat Neufchatel, and next time I will probably use a bit less even of that. The dijon totally makes this dish. My dad (who is not a big eater) had two helpings, and my son ate a huge piece all by himself. The only thing I really added was some fresh chives to the bread crumb and parsley topping.

If I could give this dish 4 and 1/2 stars, I would.  It is the creamiest mac and cheese I have ever made.  (The only better version I have had is my mother's.)  
I did reduce the cream cheese a lot. I put in only 1/4 of the 8 oz. package. Also, I subsituted 8 oz of processed cheese food for the cheddar, cut the salt by half,  and left out the dijon. The dish ended up way too saucy even for me.  I could have doubled the macaroni and it would have been perfect. 

Still, this is an excellent version of the comfort classic mac and cheese.

Generic mac & cheese. Used 4 cups cheese as recommended by other reviewers and I am glad that I did.  It was a lot of cheese for the amount of pasta, but that did make it a mound of cheezy goodness.  I also skipped the breadcrumb topping and didn't miss it.  Good and simple, but generic.  As such, it isn't a keeper for me.  But if that's what you are looking for, I would definitely try this.

I liked this a lot.  It was easy to make and tasty.  The cream cheese gave it a creamy taste my hubby couldn't put his finger on (I didn't tell him, since he doesn't like cream cheese)

Next time I will probably reduce the amount of breadcrumbs,though.  It seemed a little excessive...

Delicious! The only thing I did differently was add about 50% more pasta to the macaroni and cheese (otherwise it was about 70% cheese sauce). But it had a wonderful flavor to it. Will most certainly be returning to this recipe in the future.

My best friend and I have always loved macaroni and cheese. I made this one day when she came over for lunch and we both though it was delicious. A perfect variation without being too rich. I did use less bread crumbs and extra cheddar but this has become one of our favorites!

My husband really enjoyed this recipe, but I thought it had a bit too much cream cheese flavor. Neither of the kids enjoyed it, but I think it was the breadcrumbs they disliked -- they can be picky little buggers. I would definitely make it again, although I think I would subsitute half the cream cheese with another cheese -- perhaps monterey jack.

This may sound funny, but when I took a bite it reminded me of my grade school's mac and cheese (Husman Elementary, Crystal Lake, IL).  It's delicious, but really threw me for a loop.  Some things just stick with you forever.  My kids enjoyed it as I did because it is creamy and doesn't harden as soon as it begins to cool a bit.

I used 1 lb of macaroni, 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup milk, 1 cup half n half, and 3 tablespoons Dijon, left everything else the same. I also omitted the topping and just sprinkled more cheese on top. Also added sliced hot dogs and baked in a 13x9 dish (filled nearly to the brim). It came out great! Im very glad I  increased the noodle because the sauce would have been way too much otherwise. My picky eater husband loved this recipe. I will make it again for sure.

Best mac and cheese recipe! I use the 8 oz package of philadelphia onion and chive cream cheese instead of regular and honey dijon instead of regular dijon and then use panko bread crumbs on top because they are crunchier!

Love it, but modified big time for what I had in the house. Actually tasted amazing... and if you're a Philly resident, this modified version will taste somewhat like Chicki and Pete's fries and cheese sauce. Unreal.

Barilla wheat small shells - for macaroni
1/4 cup I Can't Believe It's Not Butter - for regular butter
Wundra - for all purpose flour
FF Milk - for regular milk
Generous portion of Old Bay - for salt and pepper
Extra Dijon to taste
1 cup shredded Mexican Cheese and 1/2 cup block of Cheddar - for 2 cups Cheddar

Do not bake - just enjoy from the pot!

Yummy! Out of cream cheese so used sour cream instead. I skipped the bread crumb topping and added diced pickeled jalapenos and corn and mixed in when I added the cheddar cheese. I was trying to duplicate my favorite barbeque place thats the reasons for the added ingredients.

I made this without the mustard as my 6 year old doesn't like anything with mustard in it.  My kids love it this way.  I like it too, but I think it would be better with the mustard.

This was OK. I'd say not 4 stars but not 3 either. I think the main problem may be that I all I had on hand was regular cheddar, sharp probably would have made it better. I sauteed some onions and garlic before added the flour, milk and cheese... and that part turned out fine.

Great simple recipe as is. For variety I add about a 1 tbs of minced onion and 3 tbs of red diced bell pepper to the butter for flavor and color. I have also used crushed ritz crackers less the butter instead of the bread crumbs with very good results.

I LOVE this recipe, I think the amount of cream cheese is just fine! I love cream cheese though!  I'm not too big a fan of the sharpness of cheddar cheese so I use mozzarella in combination with the cheddar, and I sprinkle some more mozzarella on top, and it makes a lovely crust in conjunction with the bread crumbs, such a great recipe!

Delicious!!! The only thing I will change next time is omit the bread crumb topping. Instead a light sprinkle of Cheddar to brown.

YUMMO!!! I made this recipe exactly as described except I sprinkled Panko bread crumbs on the top instead of the bread crumb / butter mixture. This was very dry the next day but what pasta dish isn't? There was very little left over for my family of 3.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!!

I really enjoyed this recipe. This is the first time that I have ever made Mac and Cheese. It is very creamy with all the Cream Cheese. While a lot of people thought it didn't have any flavor I thought it was very flavorfull. If you want a full cheese taste then I would use less cream cheese and add more sharp cheddar to it. Otherwise this is a great recipe.

WAY too many bread crumbs.  I though it overpowered the cheesiness and gooey-ness of the dish.  Leftovers were very dry.  I didn't notice the mustard at all, I think it could be left out.  If I make it again, I will add more milk and cut the bread crumbs to about a 1/3 cup or less, just to make the top brown and a little crunchy.  My 15 year old didn't like it and he will eat most anything, especially shells and cheese.

My mom is out of town, so I decided to try this recipe for my dad and I as our weekend lunch. Its the second time I've actually ever "cooked" something, so I was a bit weary as to how this would turn out!  No worries necessary - it turned out great!!! I used an entire package of macaroni (500g - a little over a lb) but used the same amount of cream cheese sauce - with maybe a little more milk.  I also added a bit of chicken (about 4 fillets, sliced and cubed) with peas and carrots (sauted the chicken and vegetables with onions in a tiny bit of oil) and I think that countered any blandess that some reviewers predicted.   Will definitely be making it again - maybe even when my mom's home!

I followed the instructions exactly and while I like the creamy texture, I couldn't taste the cheddar cheese. All I could taste was the mustard and cream cheese. I think I might reduce the cream cheese to half should I choose to make this again. The recipe was good, just not quite to my liking.

this was a fun first time recipe for me.  I can see where others would have said it was bland. The cream cheese i think is neccessary for the creamyness and texture.  I added onion powder and used 3/4 of the cream cheese and added a 1/4 oz of sour cream and chive cream cheese i had left in my fridge... def. added to the flavor. I used both mild cheddar and 4oz of mozzarella.   I will def. make this again. children raved about how yummy it was. I think it was yummy too but next time i will use sharp cheddar and maybe add some swiss and parm. the cheese blends make anything taste that much better. Will def. keep this recipe and make it again for sure!

We loved this recipe.  The only thing we changed was to include the whole 1 lb. box of macaroni.  With that much macaroni, the amount of cream cheese was perfect.

The dish was good but needs several changes. It would have been ok to add a pound of macaroni as I had more sauce than pasta. Also, 1 cup of bread crumbs was way too much! Maybe 1/2 cup and melt the butter!

Five Stars when using 1 lb macaroni.  We added a bit more cheddar.  This was great with broccoli florets and diced ham.  Mmm!  A touch of chili powder helped round out the flavor.  We'll definitely have it again. Thanks VPattison!

If I could give 10 stars I would for this recipe.........I followed the direction with the exception of using half the bread crumbs....and I uses a 1Lb box of pasta, it was the best Mac & cheese I ever had rich, creamy and such a comfort food....I suggest anyone going to try this recipe try as written with the exception of using half the bread crumbs and sprinkel half cup of cheese over the bread crumbs before baking.......**********

you definately need to double the pasta! and go with half a cup of bread crumbs for the top. I added some extra spices.. garlic pepper.. a smidge of seasoning salt and it turned out great. Super creamy.. could have even added MORE pasta after I already more than doubled what it called for.

This was delish!  Definitely a keeper!  I did make a few adjustments because I didn't have everything on hand.  I used a 1 lb. bag of elbow mac and it was just fine, but I did add extra butter per one reviewer.  I didn't have enough milk so I used evaporated milk.  I also didn't have dijon, so I used ground mustard.  Per another reviewer, I added some garlic and onion powder.  I've learned to use an electric hand blender to cream the cream cheese into a sauce with other recipes, so I did that.  The only thing I would change would be to not use so much bread crumb topping...I like it better with just a little topping.  Anyway, my two picky boys loved it...so that's the best compliment of all!

Love this recipe! And so did my boyfriend! I did change some things based on what I had at home. I used panko instead of bread crumbs, and I added garlic salt (as suggested by someone else), dried basil, pepper, and paprika to the topping. I also added paprika to the butter/flour base. I used more than 8oz of macaroni (about 12 oz of whole wheat macaroni), and added a little extra milk to thin out the sauce a little (less than 1/4 cup). I made everything in my dutch oven, which after it came out the oven had made everything kinda crunchy on the sides and bottom (which I love!)

Really LOVE this recipe and have made it many times without any changes, just scaled it to 3 for my husband and myself. Nice and creamy and rich with excellent flavour. Very easy to make and usually have the ingredients on hand.

Bit of a disappointment.  I had two main issues with it.  Interestingly, it's not about the cream cheese.  I was curious what that would add to it and actually liked the flavor.  Well, at least at first.  I tasted it right after I added the macaroni and cheddar to the pan, and it was pretty good, so I was looking forward to the finished product.  I should have just kept it in the saucepan and eaten it that way.  So my first issue is that I think cooking it 15 minutes is just WAY too much.  I think a better idea would be to wait to cook the macaroni so it can be added hot, and then only stick it in the oven maybe five minutes.  The second issue, well, I have to agree with jarrie that there's enough breadcrumbs to kill an army.  I can't even comprehend the idea of putting so much on.  First, the breadcrumb/butter ratio seemed way off cause it didn't really make a crumb topping, but more like just plain old dry breadcrumbs.  (And I do mean dry.)  I knew it seemed like a lot, but sometimes I like to "trust" a recipe (sometimes weird things work), so I used about 2/3.  And it was still just WAY too much.  I was scraping it all off.  Maybe 1/4 cup.  So it seemed over-cooked and the breadcrumbs just ruined it, making it dry and very bland.

I've had this recipe for years and it is my absolute favorite.  It does have a cream cheese flavor, so if that's not your thing you will not like this.

De-Lish!! My family loved it! I made it with the following changes: 1. I used about 500g of macaroni. 7oz just seemed too small an amount. It filled a 9x13 pan. 2. I used 1c milk and 1c half and half (just because I had it to use) 3.I used whole grain mustard.  Don't listen to those who said use less cream cheese...it was perfect with 8oz!

I followed other reviewers' suggestion and cut way back on the cream cheese. I also upped the amount of extra-sharp Cheddar by about another cup. Although we both really enjoyed the actual mac and cheese, we weren't too thrilled by the breadcrumb topping - was kind of "sandy" and not very pleasant. Next time I make this, I'll try using panko crumbs for more of a crunch. Not bad at all though. Thanks!

I LOVE this recipe. For those of you turned off by the cream cheese taste - try adding 2 cloves of minced fresh garlic to the cheese sauce while cooking. It really adds EXACTLY what this recipe needs! It's good without it too, but this garlic loving girl had to try it with it! And I don't regret it!

I use this recipe sort of as a guide to making a stovetop mac & cheese.  I double the pasta, omit the flour & only use 1/4 the amount of cream cheese.  I only pop it into the oven for a few minutes to get a bit of browning on the top.  My family isn't excited about fully baked mac & cheese so this is my compromise.

This is delicious!  I made the following modifications, after reading a few reviews: The whole box of macaroni (12 oz.) 1 3/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup cream 2 cups sharp white Cheddar, with 3/4 cup mixed cheese sprinkled on top 1/2 package (8-10 crackers) Ritz, crushed and sprinkled on top instead of the breadcrumbs

I have been looking for a good recipe for Mac & Cheese,and since I'm a big fan of cream cheese I thought I'd make this. I followed the recipe exactly, I don't like to rate recipes after they've been changed. This was OK, but very bland. Not enough cheddar taste, needed more salt and maybe less cream cheese.  I won't be making this again, but thanks for the recipe.

I am looking for a good homestyle mac and cheese recipe, and I thought that with some tweaking, this was pretty good. I used only half of the cream cheese as others did, and I put some sour cream as one reviewer suggested. I wouldn't do that again. The cream cheese is a good addition, but it does make this really bland. So I added nutmeg (which I add to all my bechemel sauces, which is basically what this is)garlic, white and black pepper, onion powder and salt and almost doubled the cheese. My husband and I both agreed that while the flavor was fine, I could have doubled the amount of noodles that I used. There was way too much sauce in my opinion. While this recipe turned out fine after my changes, I think I'll keep looking for the perfect mac and cheese recipe!

Less cream cheese or maybe even sub half with sour cream. More milk, more cheese, maybe some more butter. I also layered some cheese on top for a tastier crust. Also, the pasta measurements are off.

We loved this recipe. The dijon mustard gives it just the right kick. I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream to the cream cheese and milk mixture and in addition to the sharp chedder I added 8 oz of shredded munster for  creaminess. I melted 1/2 the cheese in the cream mixture and the other half I mixed with the macaroni. I tried using more macaroni but it became too dense on baking so I recommend sticking to 7-8 oz.

This is an excellent recipe. The only deviation I took was I added about 1/8 tsp of cayenne. Turned out really well. My husband and girls loved it. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that even though I enjoyed the cream cheese and flavor, it made it a little too rich for me.

I made this mac and cheese with a few changes.  My boyfriend doesn't like cream cheese so I omitted that.  I used a whole box of elbow pasta and I increased the butter to 1/2 a cup.  I also increased the flour to 6 tablespoons.  I used 2 cups of heavy cream and 2 cups of evaporated milk.  I also used 2 cups of orange mild cheddar, 2 cups of orange extra sharp cheddar and 2 cups of white extra sharp cheddar.  I omitted the bread crumbs and I used parmesan cheese on top.  It came out great!  so cheesy.

This was a very good base recipe, but very bland. Like others suggested, I would have added a sauted onion or some garlic. 
But besides that it is a delicious recipe, and i was surprised that the cream cheese flavor was not overpowering.

I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could... I followed the recipe as written except I added a little Asiago cheese & I used about 12 oz. of noodles. I've been looking for a good mac & cheese recipe for a while and I'd have to say this is definitely my favorite now! Other recipes I've tried always taste like flour but this doesn't at all. Next time I'll add even more noodles to get the consistency I like. Thanks for sharing!

It's hard to rate this recipe b/c I used rach8986's suggestions when making mine. I didn't have provolone but instead used a mixture of yellow & white cheddars with the cream cheese & mozz. My cheese mixture was super thick so I had to use more milk & heavy cream and even added a little Velvetta into the mix to soften it up...the key to the recipe is don't buy pre-shredded cheese! It's a pain but most are very dehydrated and you need the moisture to make a nice creamy mac & cheese. Thanks to all submitters for their suggestions. My guests RAVED about it!

I used 8 ounces macaroni (1 1/2 cups) and made according to recipe without the bread crumb topping. It was super good. Next time I make it I will add more cheese and not bake it - baking it kinda dried it out and I like it nice and creamy. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This was so good! I increased the recipe to suit a 1lb bag of macaroni. I left out the crumb topping to save time and added just a tad more mustard and pepper. It came out really well!

I was looking for a quick lunch for my kids using what I had on hand and this is what I found. 

I added onion powder and garlic powder to the cheese sauce and used whole wheat
rotini pasta, because that's what I had.
This came together nicely and really only
took about 20 minutes, minus oven time. Plus, my older son could help. 

The cheese sauce for this is THICK. Too thick for my liking. We all ate it and liked the flavor but I think if I make this again, I would thin it out with another cup of milk and perhaps add another cup of shredded cheddar, for a more cheddar flavor. The cream cheese was a little overwhelming.

I made this recipe to take to dinner at the home of some of our friends.  The only changes I made was to substitute some of the milk with evaporated milk and also to use only half of the breadcrumb mixture.  It was a huge hit and is definitely be something I will make again!

I have been looking for 20 years for the perfect Mac-n-Cheese recipe and I have finally found it!! It was just the perfect blend of noodles and cheese and not too dry or too creamy.  I used half regular milk and half evaporative milk.  The only thing I will do different next time is to not add the bread crumbs as that is not something we were particularly crazy about but the recipe overall is a true winner.

Great tasting mac n cheese.  I did however add a few things:  I put in chopped onion to the sauce, added extra cup of cheddar cheese, about 6 ounces of cream cheese, added 1 1/2 cups sliced ham (cut in chunks) and instead of bread crumbs I melted some margarine and put in crushed Ritz Crackers and used that for the topping.  Very good!

Pretty tasty and easy to make. Too much cream cheese, it takes over the flavor of the cheddar. Next time i'll put in less cream cheese and more cheese and possibly different types of cheese. I also added garlic salt, cayenne pepper,paprika and red pepper flakes to add a little bit more flavor.  It's good with some crushed up crutons as the topping too.

I've been making this recipe every year for Christmas Eve for 3 years now. The only change made is I add white wine (maybe 1/4 to 1/2 cup, I don't measure) to the cheese sauce. Everyone loves it.

I loved this mac & cheese ... and I'm fussy!  Because some reviewers mentioned that this was bland, I was a tad concerned so I doctored (tweaked) the recipe.

I used 2 cups of elbow macaroni as one poster suggested and perhaps 2 1/4 cups of milk/coffee cream mix because one (or more) poster said it wasn't creamy enough and a tad dry.

I didn't add the whole 8 oz cream cheese but I probably used 5 or 6 oz (it was the softened cream cheese in the tub and the stupid measure is in metric which I still can't get a handle on). LOL

Instead of 2 tsp of Dijon mustard I used 2 generous squeezes of prepared Hellman's Dijon mustard and about 1/4 tsp of prepared HOT mustard.  I also added onion powder, some crushed wet garlic (the type in the jar), a generous sprinkling of Season All, extra pepper & salt and in the hopes of keeping it creamy I added about 4 or so oz. of Brie cheese as that's all I had on hand.  

For the topping I used crushed baked onion thins crackers instead of bread crumbs as I didn't have any breadcrumbs and I used only a half a cup which I mixed with 1 tbsp butter.  Instead of the parsley I mixed in some grated cheddar cheese then I put the topping on top and sprinkled it lightly with more grated cheddar cheese.

This was absolutely awesome!  Creamy enough, tasty enough and definitely a recipe I would make again. I may cut down on the salt though as I'd forgotten how salty cheddar cheese can be.

This is a winner for sure!

I have been making this Mac and Cheese dish for about eight years now and have thrown away all other Mac and Cheese recipes.  Depending on what type of macaroni I have on hand that is the one I use.  My husband just loves it!  I omit the crumb topping though.  I use skim milk, light cream cheese and low fat cheese and it is still creamy and yummy!

This was great!  I used a medium-sized shell pasta, because when I use elbow macaroni it tends to get too soggy.  I also omitted the bread crumbs.  This was more like a pasta with a sharp cheddar sauce.  I will definitely make it again.

This recipe was excellent.  I would give 10 stars if I could!!!  I read the other reviews and doubled the macaroni and used club crackers mixed with butter instead.  This is one of the best mac and cheese dishes I have ever tried.

CHEESY, CREAMY, AND YUMMY!  I used another suggestion and cut down on the cream cheese and used more cheddar.  I was having a party so I doubled the recipe and used 1 and 1/2 8oz packages of cream cheese(really should buy philadelphia-generics just don't taste as good) and about 6 cups of extra sharp shredded cheddar and I skipped the topping. I baked in a tin lasagna pan and it was SOO good and SOO tasty.  Reheated was delicious as well-just sprinkled milk over to give it that good creaminess again then heated.  Thanks for the share!

I usually look for recipes that have the most reviews but this time I thought I would try a recipe that didn't have that many reviews but had at least 4 stars. Well...I think I am going to go back to my old ways. This Mac & Cheese was horrible. My kids wouldn't even it and my husband ate it just 'cuz I went to the trouble of making Mac & Cheese that wasn't from a box.

The husband and I loved this Mac and cheese. It was like melting in my mouth. I cut the cream cheese in half and used 1 tbsp less flour as someone had suggested. But I used the full amount of mustard. I didn't put any toppings on. It was wonderful.

This was probably the best Mac & Cheese we ever had.  It wasn't all creamy cheese but a great combination of cheese and pasta with just enough kick to make tasty; and the top was so crispy.

This was my first time making mac and cheese that didn't come from a box. It came out GREAT!! I added a little more cheese just because my kids are cheese freaks and they LOVED it! I wish there were left overs but even my husband (who doesn't care for mac and cheese) couldn't get enough.

Loved the texture and creaminess of this recipe.  I sautéed sausage and onions first, then mixed them into the pot with the sauce, cheese, and pasta.  Great recipe, definitely a keeper!!

This recipe was awesome. Instead of plain cream cheese I added Philadelphia Jalapeno Flavored Dip ( 227gr), Then to add a little more heat I added several chopped Pickled Jalapeno peppers to the sauce.. MMMM

Great recipe.  The only change I made was to add diced ham to it.  Very tasty.

Not a big hit in our family.  I expected more taste with the cream cheese but it was rather bland. Way to much bread crumbs on top.  Still looking for a good mac & cheese recipe.

I tweaked the recipe a bit for our liking, but overall we enjoyed it, especially reheated the next day! I used cheddar jack shredded cheese, I think I would use sharp cheddar if I made it again (the cheese flavor was a little weak). I also added about a cup of feta cheese. I used more pasta than called for- probably 10-12 ounces. I also warmed up some turkey sausage links and added those to make it a full main dish (my husband doesn't consider it a meal unless it has meat!). I didn't add the breadcrumbs and bake in the oven bc it was a hot summer day and I didn't want to turn the oven on- I'm sure baking it would only make it yummier! Not sure how often I'll be making mac and cheese, but this will be my go-to recipe when I do :)

I love this recipe! I add in a bag of frozen veggies (steamed) to make it healthier -- 16 ounces of broccoli, cauliflower and carrots -- and add half a teaspoon of nutmeg to the white sauce to give it a little more zip. A delicious cold weather dish!

Pretty much followed the recipe as is.  The only change i made was to omit the parsley only b/c i didn't have any.  If i make again, i will either cut way down on the bread crumbs or omit all together - they made the dish too dry.  I may even try french fried onions instead??  My 2 year old and husband both really liked it.

Very good!!! Made some adjustments to my liking...I only used 1/2 the cream cheese and skipped the dijon as I didn't have any. I added a little garlic powder & garlic salt since I love garlic and it was very good. I will definitely make this again!! Finally an easy mac & cheese recipe with ingredients I have on hand.

Loved the mustard taste.  I followed recipe exactly but added double macaroni.  Turned out great.
Next time I make it I will add 1 more cup of cheddar cheese.  I love that cheddar taste.
Thanks for the recipe.

What a great recipe! I added a couple dashes of tabasco, 1 tsp of fresh nutmeg and some minced onions. Next time I will use fresh breadcrumbs versus the canned ones. Overall the best recipe for Mac-N-Cheese I have tried so far. Thanks for sharing with everyone!

This was good base for mac-n-cheese using cream cheese, which I'd never done. My changes: to the cream sauce, before adding cheese:1/2 tsp dry mustard; dash onion powder, dash garlic powder. Used 4oz light cream cheese; 3 cups sharp cheddar; 1/2 cup parmesan. Pasta: used whole grain penne, whole box but it's only 12oz. This left me with too much sauce so I added 1 cup chopped cooked chicken breast (leftovers) and and about 1 cup frozen broccoli florets (just threw them in frozen, they cooked in the oven perfectly). Used 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs mixed with 1 tbl butter. It turned out SO GOOD, and it's a whole meal. We have a snow day today and my son and I keep snacking on it!

This is my first mac and cheese...I do not like it so I have never made it...but I have children and it is one of their 4 food groups.  I added onion (about 3 tbs) a dash of cayenne, spicy brown mustard in place of dijon, added monterey jack as 1/3 of the alotted cheese and 1/2 the cream cheese listed.  I did add 3-4 slices of american and bacon processed cheese for a more kid friendly taste.  I have it in the oven now but the sauce was very tasty before being baked.  Very saucy unlike my mothers who's was on the dry side....I think it will be a hit

I made this tonight and it came together in no time! Super easy! I can't give it full marks because I didn't follow the directions to a "T". Many of the comments said that this recipe was bland, and having tasted with my additions I agree that it would have been, so instead of cheddar I used Black Diamond Shredded Italian Blend cheese, added an extra teaspoon of mustard, and added shredded fresh basil to the mix when I put it into the casserole dish. Also, the macaroni I was using didn't have ounces on the box and the conversion didn't make any sense to me so I just used 1 box of Catelli's Smart Macaroni (454g). The top didn't brown during the 20mins it was in the oven so I popped it under the broiler until it was the right colour. A rousing success! This one is going to be a regular!

This was really good. I added some onion, as one reviewer suggested, and I also used more pasta than the recipe calls for. I added extra cheddar and some pepper jack, too.

I absolutely love this Mac and Cheese recipe!  It is very simple to make and just delicious!  I use extra sharp cheddar cheese in the recipe.  Also, instead of bread crumb topping I sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on the top before baking.

There was nothing *wrong* with this recipe, exactly. It turned out fine. Just not *great*, at least to my tastes. I found the cheese sauce to be too pasty/thick with lots of creaminess, but not a lot of cheese flavor. I was really hoping I would like this one because it was so highly rated, but I guess we can't all have the same tastebuds, right? My search for the mac & cheese of my memory continues, as I won't be making this one again. Thanks anyway, though!

This is the best recipe ever!  The only thing I changed was Instead of using normal bread crumbs, I suggest you cut a few slices of sour dough bread and toast them in the toaster. When your pasta is ready to bake, crumble the toast and use that as the bread topping. It's the perfect combination!!

I've tried a couple mac and cheese recipes from this site and this has been the very best. I didn't have the dijon mustard or the parsley, but that is the only diversion from the original recipe. I found that it is wonderful just as it is. Maybe if I were to change anything, it would be a little less bread crumbs...3/4 cup instead of one whole one. Thank you for this recipe!!!

YUMMY!!! I have been trying macaroni and cheese recipes left and right trying to find one my family will enjoy, and this is it! I added some provolone to the mix and made more sauce than noodles. I used 1/2 cup of the breadcrubs and sprinkled garlic powder over the entire thing. Came out amazing!

I had high hopes that this would be wonderful after reading all the reviews, but this tasted WAY too much like breadcrumbs and cream cheese.  The flavors of both were very strong.  No one in my family liked this, not even my kids who LOVE mac and cheese.

The consistency came out nicely, but this was VERY bland. I'd suggest almost doubling the cheddar, doubling the dijon, and adding some garlic salt.

Wow! This was great and easy.  I'm 7 months pregnant, and was able to clean up for company, get a dessert prepared, and make this at the same time.  Everyone loved it.  I did use a full box of macaroni and doubled the sauce.  I also did what I could to make it healthier, of course I know it IS macaroni and cheese.  I used coconut oil instead of butter, because butter turns into a bad type of fat at a high temp.  I also used whole-wheat everything, but the bread crumbs, and fat-free and low-fat everything but the cream cheese.  I topped it with romano flavored bread crumbs that we have , and that seemed to add the perfect flavor kick.  I must say, though, it is even better the next day.

Delicious!  I combined other suggestions and did the following:  used 1 stick of butter, 1 lb of macaroni, 8 oz of sour cream, and added 1 cup of shredded parmesean.  So good!

This was very very good.  I wouldn't hesitate to add more pasta.  I used 10 ounces and still had plenty of cheese sauce.  It also could use more salt but this might be because I added more pasta.  I will use this recipe again.  I'm anxious to try a lower fat version of the same thing.

SO GOOD!!! I've tried before to make a good mac n cheese at home without using the radio active, flourescent color fake cheese mix that comes in the kraft box. THis was the only time I actually got it right!!! The bread crumbs totally made this dish for me! Oh, and we added slices of the big smoked sausage we had left over from breakfast and called it "NOT SO GHETTO-Mac n cheese with hotdogs" LOL> It was like a classier version of the old kid's classic. :) Thanks

I'm sorry, but I didn't like this at all.  It was a shame because I was really looking forward to it.  I gave it 2 stars because my husband said it was "just OK"  I followed the recipe exactly and, even though we love cream cheese, it tasted like way too much cream cheese and not nearly enough regular cheese.  The bread crumbs gave it a gritty texture and it just wasn't any good.  I won't make it again.

Very good.  I really like the cream cheese in it, it gave it a creamer cheese sauce with out going to processed cheese (which I really like to avoid).  My kids really liked it.

Very dry and bland...glad I only baked for 5 minutes I couldn't imagine what it would be like any longer.  It was not creamy at all and had no taste.  I'll stick to my macaroni and cheese recipe I've used for years, just thought I would try something new.

I added paprika and garlic along with the salt & pepper. I replaced the prepared Dijon mustard with 1/2 tsp. ground mustard as I didn't have Dijon on hand. I also washed my noodles in cold water after (under)cooking them so that they would not get grossly overcooked. To the topping I added a little bit of Swiss and crumbled bacon. This recipe makes enough sauce for a POUND of noodles. It also makes enough bread crumbs to kill an army. Even in a 9x13, I had too much bread crumb mixture, I'll reduce that by half next time. Otherwise, thanks much, this was a very appreciated recipe!

I like this recipe for mac 'n cheese, but it definitely needs the mustard to give it a zing.  I didn't like the breadcrumbs, so next time I made it, I just topped with more cheese.  Nice comfort dish.

I love mac & cheese.  I love kraft mac & cheese, I love homemade, I love it all.  My only issue is that it never seems to be very good the next day.  I am on a quest to find awesome next day mac & cheese.  The all cheddar recipes are too oily and the cheese seems to separate from the pasta.  The following day everything is bland and the cheesy creaminess is gone.  The velveeta recipes, have, well, too much velveeta, a suspicious cheez product that doesn't even require refrigeration.  I've always tried a blend of the 2 to get the cheddary goodness w/ the velveeta creaminess, but it hasn't quite resulted in a noteworthy next day product.  This recipe has brought me 85% closer to that goal.  I modified only slightly, using half the cream cheese and subbing velveeta for the other half, and as someone else did, processed slivered almonds w/ the parsley to use as the topping in place of breadcrumbs.  Increased the mustard a little bit, because I love the bite it gives.  Yum, heaven the first day (eat as much as you can even if you have to sacrifice eating  other foods that day) and pretty darn good the next day too!

Ok... this has to be the best Mac N Cheese recipes I've tried!  I made the following changes... used 16 ounces of macaroni ('cause let's face it... 7 ounces isn't nearly enough!) 2 C. sharp cheddar and 2 C. Mozarella.  Added 1/2 C. parmesan to 1 C. italian bread crumbs and cut with pastry blender to make the topping.  Got RAVE reviews from whole family.  Leftovers heated up well too... we ate this for 3 days!  Will definitely make again!

I doubled the recipe because 7 oz of pasta is usually less than half of a box, not enough.  However by doing so it made WAY to much sauce and I ended up using only half of it with the full box (16 oz) of pasta.  This recipe was okay, but probably not a redo. We definaly prefer the 'Chuck's Favorite Mac and Cheese' recipe from this site over this one.

I thought this recipe was ok. The first time I made this, I made it exactly like the recipe and it had no flavor, the second, I only added 1/2 a pack of cream cheese and it still wasn't very good. There was no creamy-ness to it like a macaroni and cheese should have. Very bland. I don't plan on making this again, but if anyone should want to, please add some spices: onion powder, garlic, paprika. Something to give it some hint of flavor. I would also use cream instead of milk. The milk makes the sauce very runny and I think a lot of that was soaked up into the noodles in the oven. Just came out very crumbly looking and felt like that when you ate it. Also, when mixing in the milk, or cream into the roux (butter and flour) it will blend better if you warm the milk/cream up, rather than use cold, right out of the fridge. This is a great tip for any type of roux.

I made this as a part of Christmas Day Dinner. I followed the recipe to a T. While I liked the Dijon, I would definitely cut the amount at least by a half. Everyone at the table was divided: some loved it and others thought it tasted a little strange with the mustard.

My kids loved this recipe! It is a very creamy mac n cheese. Not greasy like most. I didn't think it had a strong cheese flavor. You might be able to help that by using a sharp cheddar or colby-jack blend. That is the reason I rated it as 4 stars. It is very simple to make and a great side dish!

This recipe is fabulous!  The only change I made was I used 1 pound of noodles, 1/2 cup of butter, and 6 Tbsp of flour.  It still fit in a 2-quart casserole (barely!).  While the cream cheese was good, I thought it could use a sharper flavor, like more cheddar or maybe some monterey jack, so I'll experiment with that next time.  I also thought there were too many breadcrumbs, so I'll probably use half as much next time.

this was seriously incredible.  i love mac & cheese, but this went beyond that.  definitely restaurant quality.  the cream cheese is key, bread crumbs a definite bonus (i didn't think i'd like them at first, but the added texture and flavor was awesome).  tips: don't skimp on the cream cheese or cheddar; use heavy cream & milk (split the amount)-- extra creamy, YUM!!!

Excellent!! but after a few modifications: I used 1/3 cup of butter and 4 tablespoons of flour, 4oz of cream cheese, 4oz of velveeta cheese (cubed), added 1/4 cup heavy cream, used 1 lb of pasta, and an additional 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar cheese. I also didn't bake, because I liked the very creamy consistency that it already had!! DEEELICIOUS!

Hubby gave this a 5, I gave it a 3(compromise and rating a 4). There was something... off... but I can't place my finger on it. Followed the recipe exactly, and I'll probably try this again.

With a few modifications, such as additional cheeses, this recipe was 5 stars. The original was not that good. Sorry. I hate giving bad reviews.

The sauce seemed perfect until after I baked it - maybe it's just me, but I've never been successful with mac & cheese made with cheddar, it always gets grainy. I may try this again using Velveeta and cream cheese, as the flavor was very good, but I was disappointed with the texture.

I didn't add the mustard - I was craving regular, comforting mac and cheese and I was a little scared of the mustard. Maybe I will next time. Without it, it was still great. Also, with all the sour cream vs. cream cheese comments, I can't believe nobody's mentioned 4 oz of cream cheese and 4 oz of sour cream. That's what I used and it was perfect!

Oh my goodness, this is absolutely DELICIOUS... I followed the recipe exactly, except (per my husband's request) I sliced up a huge pile of kielbasa sausage and poured it into the cheese mixture with the macaroni.  Holy cow this is good.  I just can't make it too often because I just devoured all the leftovers in one sitting.  I'd eat more if there was any left!!! It's that good...

My husband declared at first bite, "This is the best mac n cheese I've ever had!"  Super easy and quick to make. I added a little garlic powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper to the sauce and crumb mixture and it gave the recipe a nice kick.  I also used a full pound of pasta.  Next time I think I'll cut down the mustard to 1 tsp.

I have tried lots of mac and cheese recipes on here and was about to give up because none were exactly what I was looking for.  This was perfect.  I barely changed it, I only had about 6 oz. of cream cheese on hand, and I thought after seeing the amount of milk sauce that it needed more noodles, so I used about 12 or so ounces, again what I had on hand.  Also, I forgot about the bread crumbs, so this went without.  Will definitely make again!

Very creamy, very easy.  I did a few minor things different ie I sauted garlic and onion in the butter before adding flour...I also used a 1# box of macaroni.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because my dad and brother liked it.  Personally, I found it very bland and drowned in WAY to many breadcrumbs.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I won't be trying this again.  Thanks anyway!

This is a really excellent recipe!  I put in 1 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp dry mustard.  Also, to prevent it from drying to much in the baking process I saved 1/2 cup of the pasta water and added it to the cheese mixture just before adding the pasta.  I also used extra extra sharp cheddar cheese because that's what I love.  Try to pick young cheeses to prevent dryness.  Two girlfriends came over for dinner that night and said it was the BEST mac&cheese they had ever.  Yum!

I added a little mozzarella and a little extra cheddar.  It came out pretty good.  Except we didn't care for the bread crumb topping.  We'll be having it again, but without the bread crumb topping.

I don't know...I made this based on the suggestions from others here and all I can say is there IS such a thing as too much cheese.  It was ok the first night, but I could only eat a few bites and I didn't even want to look at it the next night.  I'm giving it four stars because my husband went nuts over it.  I'll probably make this again, this time adding less cheese (sticking more to the original recipe suggestion) and only cheddar instead of the other additional cheeses as suggested by others.

WOW...this is awesome!  I took the advice of someone else who tried this recipe and used the whole box (1 lb) of macaroni.  I also used 1/2 c. of butter + one addt'l tblspoon of flour. I made this as a side dish to a meatloaf, cooking it at the same time, so I baked at 350 for about 30 minutes.  The cream cheese was not an over powering flavor AT ALL!  This is a fantastic recipe!

Pretty good, used 1 cup whole milk and 1 cup half and half. Used 1 1/2 cups of cheddar and 1/2 of monteray jack cheese.  Used Spicey Mustard instead of Dijon.  I agree with another member that 7 onces of noodles is not enough, did 2 cups.  Once in the baking dish I stirred in Cubed Ham, I tell you this is the best part of this dish.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, loved it.

I did forget to add the mustard so thought I would add it to the crumb topping at the end...and I also made too many breadcrumbs (didn't measure, just dumped)but it was still fabulous!  We loved it...and will make it time and time again!

Made a decent mac and cheese. Was missing something for us though. I would prefer more bite... might try it again with either more cheese or a sharper cheddar.

I've made this twice now, tweaked it a bit. Added some onion powder, used a 3rd of the cream cheese (a little too tangy with the full block) and my personal favorite addition; pre-cooked bacon bits. It was a little bland at first but this salted it up and gave it some texture. Also for a spicy zip, I added finely chopped jalepeno the second time. All in all, a great recipe.

Really good... and with minimal changes! I used around 12 ounces of macaroni instead of 7, ½ pkg (4 ounces total) of cream cheese, around 1 TBS of prepared yellow mustard instead of dijon, and around 3 cups of sharp cheddar. For the topping, I used around 1½ cups plain breadcrumbs and 3 TBS butter, no parsley. I baked it in a 9x13 glass pan for around 20 minutes and then broiled it for around 3 minutes. Really good! Not too creamy, but rich enough for me! Of course, our daughter thought it was something else it since it wasn't from a blue box... Oh, and the leftovers were really good fried up in a little bacon grease/butter to crisp it up. Yum! Thanks for sharing, VPattison!

I've made this macaroni several times and my family loves it! I saute some onion and garlic in the butter before adding the flour, but otherwise keep everything else the same. I don't put much topping on, because my kids prefer it without, but that's just a personal preference thing. Thanks for a great recipe!

For those who think this is bland - I would recommend using sharp cheddar cheese.  I don't usually rate recipes - because I seem to have a hard time making any recipe the way it is written, and don't think it's fair to make changes and then rate the original recipe.  However, with this recipe, I only made a couple minor changes.  I used 1 1/4 cups sharp cheddar, and 1 1/4 cups Monterey Jack cheese.  For the topping, I didn't have dry bread crumbs, but had some stuffing mix - so I crushed that and mixed it with the melted butter.  I omitted the parsley.  Using the stuffing mix also added some great flavor.  My 4 year old Mac & Cheese connoisseur loved it and told me he would eat it every day!  I was  specifically looking for a recipe that didn't use processed cheese food (yuck at our house!) and this one is a winner!

This is the best Mac and Cheese recipe for me! The only thing we did different was to use crushed ritz crackers as a topping instead of bread crumbs. Very good!! Definitely not a diet food though.

This macaroni has to be the best I've ever had! I've never had it with cream cheese before, so it was like a new experience. The dijon was a perfect touch.

WOW! Not only was this recipe deceptively simple, but it was rewarding.  This makes a  great, rich, delicious mac and cheese. 
The creaminess is built into the recipe, but the trick to really making this good is to not skip on good cheddar.  I used an aged white cheddar that is really very sharp.  This made the flavor much richer, but not so much that it overwhelmed the  dish.  The quantity of cream cheese really balances out the sharpness of the cheddar.  I think next time I will try using a lower fat cream cheese. I did use 1% milk, which is what we usually have at home, so no problems with skipping on the fat a bit.  I also had 8 oz of pasta, and could really have stretched it to 9 or 10, because there was a lot of creamy stuff to mix into the pasta when the cheese mixture was done.    Also, I used panko on top instead of bread crumbs, and that made for the perfect crunch.

I changed the recipe quite a bit. Used a full 16 oz of shell pasta and sauteed a minced shallot with the butter. Substituated 4 oz of velveeta for 1/2 the cream cheese. I added a bit more mustard, and couple tablespoons of horseradish, about 1/3 cup of white wine, and about a cup of finely chopped cooked ham. It was not dry at all and my son proclaimed that it was absolutely the best macaroni and cheese he has ever eaten.

Very good macaroni & cheese!  I made a few changes that added a little more flavor.  I sauteed an onion in olive oil with 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and added it to the cheese sauce when it was ready. I served this along side pork loin chops, turnip greens and chili-brown sugar roasted sweet potatoes for a delightful winter Southern Sunday supper.

Very good, creamy mac n cheese. 7 oz of macaroni isn't very much, though, so I used a regular 12 oz pkg and it worked good. Added some cubed ham once and the family liked that a lot.

Sorry, folks.  For a 4 1/2 star rating, I was highly disappointed.

Too dry, the gravy reminded me of eating dried beef and gravy as a kid, and even with adding the worcestershire sauce and mustard powder.....was not good.

We threw 1/2 of it out.

Will try the cheddar cheese soup mac and cheese on this website.

This one bombed, as far as I'm concerned.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of the bread crumb topping (ran out of time)- so I just sprinkled cheese on top- it was wonderful. I never liked homemade mac-n-cheese because I don't like eggs in it- so this was perfect. The bit of mustard really makes it... I will make this again!

This is a great recipe to have! My only changes were to add slightly more butter and increased the noodles to about 12oz (give or take) to fill up the 2 QT baking dish. Both toddlers and myself had generous portions!! Thanks for the recipe.

I'll keep looking for a better mac and cheese. I tried this one because it had things I had on hand in it. I upped the amount of dry macaroni to three cups from two (which is about what 7 ounces is), which turned out perfect. Otherwise I made it unchanged. I didn't mind the taste but my husband didn't like it.

Very tastie!  Took the suggestion of using cream with milk instead of all milk.  Mostly followed the recipe but added more noodles which I thought was better instead of it being super cheesy :) and some of us didn't care for so much breadcrumbs.  I'm already planning another batch maybe with crushed crackers or just melted cheese on top.  This is a great addition to my collection, thanks!

I made this for a brunch, and it was a huge hit.  I took other reviewers' advice to scale back the cream cheese slightly (6 oz instead of 8 oz).  I also used 1/3 cup of half-n-half and the rest milk.  Then upped the shredded cheese by a cup.  After tripling the recipe, I had enough to fill two small sterno pans.  I let them cool, put them in the fridge overnight, and then pre-sliced squares before reheating.  One complaint is that when reheated, the cheese is chunky instead of creamy...but still delicious!

This recipe was pretty good, however I did change a couple of things.  I added about 1/2 tsp of cayenne, and 1 tsp of minced garlic (I put garlic in *everything* lol) to "kick up" the flavor a little.  I also used 1/2 the amount of bread crumbs.  Definitely will make this again.  Thanks!

I really liked this mac and cheese. I doubled the amount of noodles per other reviewers, but I think next time I will use 3/4 lb of macaroni instead of 1 lb. Once baked, while delicious, it really wasn't creamy anymore, and I like my noodles saucy! I used shredded sharp cheddar for the sauce and it was wonderful! Once in the pan, I sprinkled a small amount of mild cheddar on top, then topped that with 1/2 c. Italian bread crumbs (blended with 1 T. butter). Baked for 18 minutes and it was golden brown and TASTY! Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This is very good! I added a splash of worcestire and a dash of mustard powder. Could've used a bit more salt. A cup of breadcrumbs ended up being a bit too much. Otherwise, very good! Will definately make again!

Excellent!  Relatively easy and not too much to clean up afterwards. I was a little hesitant about the dijon mustard but it gives this dish a little something extra to enjoy.  My advice is to cut up the cream cheese into smaller pieces to help aid in melting and also to use more macaroni (or desired pasta of choice). It is best right out of the oven and okay the next day heated up.  Next time I will not use the parsley as it did not spread evenly. Anyboy else have an issue with that?

A very good mac and cheese recipe!  I don't make it that much but this is the best one I've ever made.  The cream cheese made it different and we used sharp cheddar.    This one's a keeper!

As odd as this is going to sound, I actually like this more before it was baked.  It was so rich and creamy.  Baking it took something away.  I'll serve it again, I just won't bake it first.

A fantastic and E-Z Mac & Cheese!  First I read all the comments from other cooks and then made my own changes, read on.  (1) I cooked double the amount of macaroni (16 oz.) as there was just too much sauce for such a small amount of the pasta.  (2) I cooked the flour mixture longer than suggested to make sure that the flour taste was totally cooked out.  (3)  I added an extra big cup of sharp cheddar cheese.  Other than that, I follwed the recipe instructions exactly as originally written.  (I have five big sons and they wolfed it down!)

It is a good base recipe, but I think a few changes are needed.  First, there is way too much sauce.  I used a full pound of pasta and there was plenty of sauce.  also - you'd better find 6 extremely hungry people to eat it all, make a lot!!  I agree with the other reviewers that the cream cheese is too bland a flavor.  I "fixed" that the second time I made it by using a very sharp cheddar, and also replace 1/2 the cream cheese with velveeta.  I also decided that I didn't need the bread crumb topping and just sprinkled parmesan on top as the coating.  With these change - much better, about a 4.5 rating.

I love cream cheese so I thought this would be a good recipe. I bumped up the cheddar, but the sauce was still pretty mild. I like a creamy mac and cheese, but this has a strange mouth feel. It was pretty heavy I could only eat a few bites. The family wasn't pleased with this recipe. I will not be making it again.

This is a good recipe. I used crushed Townhouse crackers instead of bread crumbs and used the entire amount of cream cheese even though some previous reviews advised against it.

this was good, but a tad too tangy.  perhaps next time i will cut down the cream cheese.  i might try a buttery cracker topping instead of bread crumbs too.  but a great potluck dish!

Good recipe.  I actually use the recommended amount of cream cheese - but use a garlic herb cream cheese instead of plain to add some flavor. I also increase the amount of macaroni a bit so it isn't quite so rich.  Thanks!  My husband loves it.

This was great.  I followed the recipe, but sauted a little bit of onion in the butter before adding everything else.  It adds a nice flavour.  I also added some minced jalepenos for a little bit of flavour :)  It was great!

I made this for my nephew's birthday party and 'what a hit'.  I doubled it and thought I made way to much, (I had to buy a foil roasting pan to make as much as I wanted), and I only ended up with about 2 cups left over.  Everyone absolutley loved it.  I used "velveeta" instead of cheddar and eliminated the mustard.  My brother wants the recipe and will add pepperoni or ham.  Definitley a favorite.

Mine did not turn out as creamy as I had hoped.  Definitely not as cheesy as Mouse's Mac & Cheese - but still not quite what I hoped for.  I'll continue my search for the perfect mac & cheese to suit my taste!

Excellent!  Even my husband loves it and he usually could take or leave macaroni and cheese.  I add a bit of grated cheddar cheese into the breadcrumb topping as well.  Yummy!  Thanks, Valerie.

Outstanding! Much creamier and simpler than most. A lot of mac and cheese recipes are a pain since I'm a college kid and don't usually have much on hand, less the budget to buy the weird stuff. This is perfect and just as creamy/yummy as the others I've tried.

I cannot rate this recipe any higher because of all the issues it had.  With several modifications, it would be fine.  The sauce was very mild and not very cheesy, even though I was using a mix of very sharp and medium cheddar.  I added quite a bit more of the very sharp cheddar, and then it was tasty.  The pasta to sauce ratio was also off.  I used  about 1 1/2 times the pasta called for, and then it was good.  Unfortunately I did not catch that the amout of bread crumbs specified was way too much.  I added them all, and it ruined the experience.  It was like eating mac and cheese that had been dropped in sand.  I scraped most of it off what was left in the casserole, so hopefully the leftovers will be ok.  I feel like with more butter and less bread crumbs the topping would be better.

I liked the recipe which was concise and no nonsense.  The texture was excellent.  But the taste was not my conception of mac & cheese.  Not buttery enough nor cheesy enough.  Looks great though...

Throw out and disregard an other mac and cheese recipe! I started making this a couple years ago and haven't looked back since. My family and future inlaws have named me the official mac and cheese maker for any and all events! I love this recipe. Its easy enough to make and the ingredients are pretty simple. I use New York extra sharp cheddar block cheese that I cut into little easy to melt squares. I tend to add some dried onion and garlic powder to mine. I also like to add the cheese before the noodles and do the noodles last. I do a little more mustard then called for, to taste. And I don't bread crumb or bake my mac, just my preference, I instead sprinkle with more cheese and serve. I found that real butter is the way to go, margarine is too oily and made my cheese sauce separate. Seriously the best mac and cheese recipe, the cream cheese just makes it!

It was fine but I had hoped that it would have tasted more cheesy. I’m glad I added cut and cooked bacon to the top as it did help the flavours overall.

Thus Mac and cheese recipe was just okay. It was a little thick and grainy. I like my Mac creamy, this was not.

Good, but sauce is too thick.  I don't know what to do other than add more milk.  It took me, anyway, a lot longer than 20 minutes to put together, my husband about 30 minutes to clean up after me.  Oh, and, you must cover it to bake it until the last few minutes, otherwise it'll really dry out.

Awesome!  I didn't have any breadcrumbs so I did't use those.  I also didn't have dijon mustard so I used regular.  I decreased milk to one cup and didn't bother with the flour as it was already nice and thick.  I added more cheese, and cheese to the top :)

Way too much sauce for the amount of macaroni!!  Ended up adding the entire box of macaroni, otherwise it was like cheese soup.  Was very bland and didn't have much cheese flavor.  Would not make again.

I made this today and it was awesome! I never made mac n' cheese with cream cheese and dijon mustard! I did and I'm happy! I think I fell in love with Macaroni and cheese all over again! I just didn't put it in the oven as the recipe said to but I didn't feel it was needed.

It was the first recipe I  tried for homemade mac & cheese, & why try any other? The cream cheese makes such a difference!  Makes it so smooth & rounds out the flavors. I play around with other ingredients,  different cheeses (gouda, edam, swiss, parmesan for a white version), different  meats, but the cream cheese is always there . Try adding a bit of mild curry. Like the mustard, it just fills in the flavor without making a major statement. This is now my signature dish for family gatherings. Of course, I double the recipe.

I've made this a bunch of times through out a few years. I've always made changes whenever I make it. I use smoked cheddar cheese, and regular. I use more mustard, and I add about a half cut to a cup of good ham depending on how much everyone likes it. 
I've made twenty one pound of this mac and cheese at once, and everyone who ate it loved it!
It's great to start with and then play with it and find what you like. 
Really easy to make!

This recipe wasn't very reliable. It asks for 7 oz of macaroni, which is less than a cup. Instead, I made it with 450g of cavatappi. I also added more cheese, or else it would've tasted too bland. The amount of breadcrumbs is wayyy too much. I would recommend sprinkling it over the pasta and just try to eyeball it. Perhaps a 1/4 cup? Not sure. This "recipe" is just grasping the general concept of how to make mac and cheese, but definitely not complete. But in the end, I still thought my dish tasted delicious!

Great base recipe. I made changes due to what I had in the house but we enjoyed it! I used 1/2 an 8oz brick of cream cheese and a bag of shredded cheddar. It took a whole box of pasta shells. Topped with seasoned breadcrumbs mixed with 2tbsp butter. Yum!

This is a duplicate of Home-Style Macaroni and Cheese, without the jalapenos.  I agree with a previous reader, that 7 oz. of macaroni will not feed 6 people.  And the reviewer that said the boyfriend ate leftovers for 3 days...must have a 110 lb. boyfriend.  As a starter this is good, but you need to use 1 lb. of macaroni, drop the cream cheese, and add either another cup of shredded cheddar, or 8 oz. of Velveeta, plain or Mexican.  The Velveeta will give you creaminess, and flavor.  Also try adding a can of crushed tomatoes or cut tomatoes.  Nice addition, kids love it and so do adults getting another veggie.

Loved it! I've tried several macaroni & cheese recipes, and this was my favorite. A few things I did differently: full stick of butter instead of 1/4 cup, 1 egg, and a jar a pimento.

We love it.  I tend to season it to my mood or what is on hand.  Sharp cheddar and a little tyme ...Monterey Jack with garlic...pepper jack and chili powder....all make it a little different and delicious.  The receipe as it is will be bland if you don't add a good stong cheese or a little extra seasoning.

This was so good and just the way I like my macaroni and cheese.  I did not use the cream cheese as I wanted the cheddar cheese flavor.  I only used one half teaspoon of Dijon mustard.  I will be making this recipe more often.  Thank you VPATTISON for sharing this recipe.

I really like this recipe.  First time I made it, I found that the cream cheese was too heavy for me so the second time I put in about 3/4 of what the recipe called for.  The final product was really yummy, even the picky eater in my house gave her approval.  I especially like how this recipe does not call for "cheese products."

Made it exactly like the recipe...creamy, cheesy, yummy.  Was a little disappointed it didn't have more flavor (a little on the bland side), but the creaminess made up for that in my opinion.  Definitely TOO much bread crumbs...I didn't even use them all and still was too much.  I also think it would be better to mix in some grated cheddar with the bread crumbs to help them stick together better.  Another good option would be crushed Ritz crackers and grated cheddar for the topping!

This is a delicious recipe. As others have stated, there is a bit too much cheese sauce for the amount of pasta. I increase the amount of pasta to remedy that.

I used the recipe but changed a few things. I used 6oz of cream cheese, and 1 1/2 cups of cheddar jack, 2 slices of Kraft Am singles, and 2 slices of Swiss cheese for the cheese portion (all I had on hand). I added Parmesan garlic herb rub, red pepper flaked and garlic salt to the Panko crumbs. I also used two 20 oz  and one 16 oz Corning Ware baking dishes. Came out superb.

Perfect!  I didn't change a thing, although I did add leftover diced chicken into it.  My kids loved it!  I have a family of 4 and this fed us for dinner with about a third of it leftover.

I love this recipe. I made enough sauce for 24 servings (Thanksgiving, yo!), and it's amazing. My husband will not eat "fake" food, so I've wanted to make a mac and cheese that did not have Velveeta but was still good. This one is awesome. I agree that the base recipe is bland, but that actually works in its favor. You can sex it up with spices, if you want. This is my new go-to recipe. Woo! I'm delighted!

Loved this. Per other reviews, I used 2.5 cups macaroni, 4 oz cream cheese, 4 oz Velveeta, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, and Italian bread crumbs. Came out great, altho could've been cheesier, tad too much heat, and a bit too much bread crumbs. Next time will add more cheese, just use pinch of paprika & cayenne, and try either crushed corn flakes or crackers in lieu of bread crumbs. Thanks to OP and others for sharing:)

This macaroni and cheese was pretty good, and my kids ate it pretty well. I thought maybe it was a little too cream cheesey so if I made it again I would probably add more of the cheddar cheese to balance it out a little bit. The bread crumb topping was pretty good, but it does get soggy with the leftovers. Overall though, good flavor and very easy and inexpensive to make. Thank you for the recipe, VPATTISON!

Came out pretty good. Everyone liked it but I added 1/2 tablespoon of pepper rather than a 1/2 teaspoon just to add more flavor. I would make it again.

(writing this review right after cooking, and while eating, this mac'n'cheese)
This is the 3rd recipe I've tried (other 2 from this site also) and so far this is the simplest mac'n'chiz recipe I had tried, and I will stick with this one! First of all, I didn't have enough milk (only 2/3c) so I used the pasta cooking water for the rest. Used only 2T flour, only 1 8oz Monterey Jack and 3oz Mild Cheddar as the cheeses, and 1/3t granulated garlic and 3/4t onion powder since I don't have mustard. I should have left out the 1/2t salt since my pasta water is already salted, but I don't mind! And I didn't bother about the topping since I don't own an oven :) I may have made some changes, but I could say that IF I HAD FOLLOWED the original recipe to a T, I would be crying my heart out at every bite! Thanks for the recipe, VPATTISON! I could kiss you! :) :) :)

This recipe is phenomenal. I don't really like baked macaroni and cheese, I always preferred the quicker kind (pasta and cheese), but this recipe was brilliant.

The cream cheese sauce makes the phenomenal taste of this, and adding the cheese on top makes it super cheesy, which is always great for mac and cheese.

This was delish! Next time, I might reduce the cream cheese by half (down to 4oz) and use 4oz of evaporate milk with more shredded cheese (to taste). Regardless, it was YUMMY!

I made this exactly the way that it is given on this site, except I did not have Dijon mustard so I used a tiny bit of mustard powder.  It is excellent!  The girls at work always ask me for my mac and cheese recipe, but now I will have to give them this one!  It is the first one I've used that has cream cheese in it and I think it gives it the PERFECT touch.  Thanks!

Very good recipe! I did cut back on the cream cheese a bit and added more shredded cheese as the only changes. I do plan to make this again, but I would now cut back on the bread crumbs. It was too much in my opinion.

I started looking for a recipe for a creamy mac and cheese that didn't use processed American like cheese or canned cheese.  I'm used to making my own mac n cheese usually with whatever I have on hand.  Sometimes I bake it and sometimes I don't.   This recipe tasted good right off the burner.  This time I baked it because I was also heating up some ham and the oven was on anyhow. 

We really enjoyed the taste and the tanginess of the cream cheese in it.  Hubby decided it might need tweaked more before he declares it's a "loved it".

Changes: 
8 oz pasta instead of 7 oz.   I buy bulk pasta in a 1 lb pack, so I used half a package.

4 oz cream cheese instead of 8 oz.   I had a partial package of cream cheese from an 8 oz package.

10 Ritz crackers crushed instead of bread crumbs and additional butter.

Ground white pepper instead of black pepper.   I don't like black flakes in my mac n cheese.

The sauce came out nice and creamy.  It was the perfect medium thickness for a sauce of this type.   Thickness of a sauce can depend on a number of things, type of milk, how long you let thicken, etc.  I use 1% milk since that's what hubby drinks.

This was pretty great except 1 C. of bread crumbs is WAY too much!  According to me, that is.  My boyfriend disagrees.  It is very creamy, which I liked, but lacking the cheesy flavor.  And like some others mentioned, it's kind of bland.  Needs something like garlic or onions added for more flavor!  BUT I did enjoy it, and it is easy to make from ingredients we all have on hand.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was very good. When I first was putting it together it seemed to be a bit runny, but after baking, this wasn't a problem. If anything, it got a little dry, so...maybe more milk next time.

I used 1 3/4 milk and 1/4 heavy cream and added garlic and red pepper flakes to the breadcrumb which I used ritz crackers for and it turned out very good.  I also used 1 lb of pasta and would prefer more of the creamy sauce, next time I will make more of the sauce as I like gooey mac n cheese. Also, I used 4 cups of cheese (several variety), will add more cheese next time as well,  added sauteed garlic and onion to the macaroni. great recipe, will use again

I do like this recipe. i give it a 4 because I feel it could use more butter. I also feel it is a little bland. You need more than 7 ounces of macaroni, otherwise there is way to much cheese for the mixture. The topping is great but a cup is way to much. I do enjoy the cheesy goodness and as a southern man who loves his mac and cheese, my husband loved it. :)

I just gave this recipe a try due to my family getting tired of dried out mac & cheese...I was a little skeptical about the cream cheese, but did research and came across several recipes which include cream cheese. I did not add dijon mustard I did not want that intense flavor since I was using a great extra sharp newyorker cheddar cheese...with that said...this recipe is a keeper. Enjoy

Great saucy mac n' cheese recipe. Some might find it too saucy--so more than 7 oz. of pasta is necessary. I used about 2 cups aged white cheddar and two cups regular and I thought the flavor was just fine. The recipes does call for too much breadcrumbs, so I eyeballed it and mixed it with some parmesan and then sprinkled the miixture on top.

Fantastic recipe!  I used a lb of pasta and left out the butter in the topping and still had great results.  Try adding some diced tomatoes before baking for some nice flavor

We didn't care for this recipe.  It lacked flavor and it came out of the oven grainy - maybe it had too much fat?  I ended up putting it back on the stove top with some milk to make it creamy again - still had a grainy texture.  I'm glad we tried it though - thanks for the recipe!

very cheesy, almost too much, I would use this recipe again but add more seasoning like paprika, onion powder and cayenne to the cheese mix, and perhaps a 1/2 cup less of cheese. I would omit the breadcrumbs as there were way too much and it just made it taste too salty.

OMG - this was the best macaroni and cheese ever.  Now since I was 2yrs old, I would grab a box of mac and cheese, pan and wooden spoon.  With this recipe I think I'm going to leave my childhood memories behind!

Very creamy.  I made with a pound of macaroni and as recommended increased the butter to 1/2 cup and increased the cheddar a little because I had more pasta.  I feel that the topping makes too much.  I had double the size and it still made a huge amount even though I didn't double those ingredients.  We liked it but I was touched when my husband said he likes my own recipe better. :)

Added more macaroni as per previous reviewers.  Didn't have dry bread crumbs so cut up white bread into cubes and they burned!!!  : (  Otherwise a lovely, creamy change from the regular mac and cheese.

I found this to be perfect. I did follow the advice of others and only use 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and used about 12 oz of macaroni, otherwise I left everything the same. Delicious!

Fantastic. Great prior to going in the oven, was an interesting varient. However, half the bread crumbs would have been sufficient. A cup was too much. Otherwise fantastic

I thought overall this was great.  I used half of all of the ingredients because it was just for me and my boyfriend, but kept the 7 oz. macaroni due to other comments.  The taste was delicious - I was nervous about the cream cheese, but it was great.  I put it in the oven for 10 minutes to melt the cheese I put on top (I don't care for a bread crumb topping).  I probably should have only done 5 minutes, I believe the oven dries it out a bit too much.

I read the previous reviews that said it was a little bland, but I decided to try it as written at first. But I would have to say I agree. I would make it again, but next time I would cut down on the cream cheese- probably to 4 oz. I would increase the Cheddar instead, or maybe add some Swiss or provolone, to make up for the cream cheese.

My husband and I loved this, and it was even better the next day!  I adjusted the recipe slightly based on readers reviews and what I had on hand, using only a half cup of breadcrumbs, 2 cups sharp cheddar + 1 cup of "quesadilla" cheese, used the full 12oz package of elbows, and 2% milk. (like that really saved me that many calories... :) It was sooooo creamy and good! This would make an excellent side dish or take-along to a potluck!

Pretty good mac and cheese. After tasting the sauce I added a small piece of red leicester that was hiding in my fridge and 1t more of Dijon. The breadcrumb topping was a nice addition. I made the breadcrumbs in the food processor then added the parsley and butter and whizzed it again. Thankyou VPattison.

The was very easy and delicious. I added 2 sliced and cooked chicken breasts as well as a large diced jalepeno. It was delicious. I also omitted the bread crumb topping and sprinkled extra cheese on the top. My husband is already asking for me to make this again!

Made this last night and it was a big hit with the family. I only gave it four stars as it would have been overly saucy if I hadn't doubled the amount of pasta. I also used a mix of cheddar and swiss for the shredded cheese and added a garlic parmesan seasoning mix to the bread crumbs. Will definably make this again.

Yum. I made this to go with hot wings. I made the full sauce recipe and just poured some noodles into the pot without measuring. I had some extra sauce. I also used Panko as the topping. My husband and I both had seconds! Really creamy and delish!

The first thing that comes to mind is YUM!  I made this for a new mom at our church along with a side of lemon pepper peas.   I made a little extra macaroni, but kept the sauce proportions the same and it was just fine.  I used less bread crumbs per the other comments I read and during the last five minutes put a few very thin pats of butter any crust areas that seemed dry.  I used skim milk, but regular cream cheese.  I really wish I had made a double portion for my house, but will be making it again next week for my husband and kids.

Great recipe. I used a little more than 2 cups of cheese, and used Sharp Chedder instead of Chedder. I didn't use the mustard, bread crumbs or parsely. The sauce was creamy and cheesy, without any overwhelming cream cheese flavor. Unfortunately there will be no leftovers for tomorrow.

This is a classic, creamy and rich mac & cheese.  True comfort food at it's best.  If you're a purist (like me) when it comes to mac & cheese, and you LOVE a creamy, cheesy texture than this is the recipe you want to try.  Excellent recipe!

Great recipe... I used crushed ritz crackers with melted butter in place of the bread crumbs to give it a little extra texture & flavor & it turned out great.   Not as great the following day, as the oil in the cheese separates from the cream.

This recipe is excellent! I adapted it a bit by making the milk as about 1 1/2 cup 1% milk and 3/4 cup 20% cream. I also sauteed 4 italian sausages before slicing them and adding them to the noodles with 2 minced cloves of garlic and 1/4 yellow onion, minced, also sauteed. To the sauce I added 1 small jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced. Just the right amount of heat and creaminess!!

Everyone who's tasted this is floored by how cheesy & creamy it is. And it smells incredible when it's baking!!   The panko suggestion sounds wonderful, dan ~ I love panko and substitute it often for bread crumbs...I'll try it!

This recipe is perfect.  My entire family loves it, and I always serve it at parties.  I always use bacon to top it off.  It adds alot of flavor.

Good - but I agree with others that the cream cheese taste is a little overpowering.  I like cream cheese, I just wouldn't eat it straight up! If I make again, I will cut back on the amount of cream cheese.

This was not for us.  I think it should be called Cream Cheese and Mustard Macaroni.  I assumed the cream cheese was just to add texture, not necessarily flavor.  Boy, was I wrong.  Personally, I'm not sure what the cream cheese did for the dish besides give it an odd flavor.  I didn't find it to be any creamier than a normal mac and cheese.  Same thing with the dijon.  I can't think what merit it has over dry mustard powder besides overwhelming flavor.  I would say this dish is "Adventurous" not "Home Style."

EXCELLENT.  Have made several times.  I also use almost a pound of noodles because it makes a lot of sauce.  Make sure to use SHARP cheddar, or else the sauce will taste bland with just mild cheddar.  Sometimes I mix in those fried onions with the bread crumbs which makes it taste even more amazing!

I didn't have any cream cheese, so I sub'd laughing cow light spreadable swiss. It was really good and creamy, but didn't have enough cheddar for my taste. I'll be using this recipe again, trying with more cheese!

I thought the dijon really gave it an odd flavor. We ended up throwing this out. I like some of the other homemade mac and cheese recipes on the site, suggest trying those instead.

Very good recipe!  I did make some changes however.  I used the whole box of elbow macaroni: 1lb.  I also used sharp cheddar cheese and added a cup of parm cheese.  I didnt have Dijon mustard on hand, but I did have Honey BBQ Mustard, and that seemed to work great.  My husband who refuses to eat cream cheese, didnt even taste it...and I used the whole 8 ounces.  He was very surprised!!  Will defenitly make again!  Oh, and it made enough I could freeze an additional 2 qt. pan of it.

Ok this was gone in 15 minutes.  Never have I had such raving over Mac and Cheese. I made changes by others.  2 cups of Cheddar, 1 cup Swiss, and one cup Mozzarella.  I reserved some and used on the top. Also omitted bread crumbs.  This was easy, the hardest part was a shredded all the cheese but if you buy it it would be done in less that 30 minutes.  Also subed some half and half 1/2 cup.

I've been making this recipe for at least 5 years and it never disappoints. My picky husband requests it every Thanksgiving and Christmas and sometimes Easter. I'm more of a baker, (cookies, cakes, etc.) however this recipe is so simple, I don't mind making it for my family. The Dijon mustard gives it an extra kick. This is definitely a keeper.

I agree with many of the other reviewers:  A little less cream cheese, way less bread crumbs, and more macaroni.  Personally, I only think this recipe is okay, but my husband is amazed by it!

I doubled this for a cookout.  When doubling it doubled ingredients, obviously.  I altered it to this: only 1 block of cream cheese. I used cheddar, mozzerella, colby for my cheese.  I also added 1/2 tsp of red pepper and sprinkled panko on top, rather than the bread crumb mixture.  It was delish.

I didn't particularly care for this recipe, but my significant other said it was to die for. I may make it for him again, but I'm going to try to find a different recipe. This one was too creamy for my taste.

I'm sorry to say that while this recipe is flavorful and interesting, it's not the "home style mac & cheese" comfort food I was seeking.  This recipe does produce a creamy mac & cheese with a strong cream cheese flavor and an interesting twang from the Dijon mustard, but "home style" in the title made me hope it was like what my beloved Granny used to make.  While this recipe may be absolutely perfect using sharp cheddar & American cheeses and omitting the Dijon, I don't understand why people rate recipes at all when they have significantly altered the ingredients.  As is, I rate this recipe a 3.5 and will round up to 4.  Also, please note that if you double the recipe, you do not need to double the breadcrumb topping.  I scaled this up to 12 servings and 2 cups of buttered breadcrumbs in a 9" x 12" dish was way too much.

Very picky eater who would rather have the cheap, package mac and cheese.  But he did eat it all with no complaints and said it tasted very gourmet.  Easy to make and I love the dijon mustard and cream cheese.  Very rich and creamy!  No complaints on my end.  Now if only they could make it non fat.......

This was my first attempt at making homemade mac and cheese and it was really good.  I only made minor changes, I used a full 1lb box of pasta and almost doubled the amount of cheese.  You can't really taste the cream cheese at all, but it makes the sauce nice and creamy.  The bread crumbs are a necessity, gives it a nice crunch and a little extra flavor (I used Italian flavored crumbs)  Next time I might add some jalapeno juice to the sauce, we like things spicy.  All in all, a great recipe!!!

I have made a lot of macaroni and cheese recipes and this one is my absolute favorite!  I made this one last night and followed the recipe pretty closely.  I did not put any crumbs or cheese on top because my family likes their mac and cheese without a "crust" on top.  We ate it without baking in the oven, and it was perfectly creamy and cheesy.  Fantastic!

Wonderful recipe, very creamy, though I did not care for the twang that came from the mustard so I will leave that out next time. Otherwise, great. Also I added some french fried onions to the macaroni mixture and bread crumb mixture. I think it really added character to it.

made this recipe and i used velveta cheese instead of cheddar and used the 8oz cream cheese also.it was very creamy.didn't care too much for the bread crumbs.it was just a bit too much.next time i will leave the crumbs off or at least cut back and maybe just sprinkle a little on top for the crunch.

I wasn't as happy with this recipe as I thought I would be.  I ended up with some hard and crunchy parts on top that were really dry and inedible.  I think it needed a punch of something too.  I think maybe some garlic might do the trick.

The family didn't like this at all. VERY rich and almost pasty without a ton of flavor. Baked mac & cheese is one of their favorites so I guess I'll go back to my original recipe! Thanks anyway.

This is a good recipe.  I don't like bread crumbs on my mac and cheese so I choose to eliminate that step.  I also substituted sour cream for cream cheese.  I will try this again.

This mac and choose was good for a first try.  If you like a spin on a very creamy mac and cheese, then this is your dish!  Next time, I'll try a different variation: remove or limit the amount of bread crumbs and add cheese to the top instead, try increasing the amount of cheddar cheese and decreasing the amount of cream cheese (I missed the sharper taste of cheddar) and add a dash of paprika (1 tsp).

This was a wonderful base. I did change a few things. We did not have any dijon mustard, which my wife does not like anyway, so I added 1/2 tsp of minced garlic to the mixture. I also added 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese with the cheddar. I also used low-fat cream cheese, and it was plenty creamy. Let me say, this recipe was spectacular, and my wife loved it and is her new favorite mac and cheese recipe.

This was extrememly good, followed the recipe exactly, except for the breadcrumbs.  The cream cheese and the mustard give such a good flavor to this creamy cheesey dish.  Talk about comfort food!  I also sauteed kielbasa, onions and garlic, for those who wanted it mixed in.  We have made this several times before, and everyone asks for it when they need some down home feel better food.  Thanks for sharing this recipe V!

STOP!Read ChefNan 1st!!!  Far too little past1a.  Reduce the amount of bread crumbs to 1/3 C or less.  Too many other quality recipies for mac & cheese that will satisfy the comfort seeker in you.

I had high expectations with all the good reviews, but this recipe was horrible.  There isn't enough macaroni, which makes it really runny, and all that cream cheese just makes it bland and not very good at all.  Make the four cheese macaroni from this site!

I used a blend of cheeses including cheddar, extra sharp cheddar, monterey jack, queso quesadilla, and asadero, and added bacon. Everything else was exactly as the recipe ordered. Several of us found we didn't like the cream cheese flavor so well and felt it needed more sharp cheese and mustard, and I think it was the cream cheese that upset my stomach. Will try again with these changes. Good creamy recipe, just not fully suited to our tastes.

Wow! Now I've never made mac n cheese before and just fancied it for an evening meal. Me and my partner wolfed this down and nearly finished the whole bowl. My Partner loved it and demanded I made it again. The Dijon mustard is a great touch. I shall def make this again and shall probably mess around with cheeses and toppings. This shall be a staple for me! Thanks for sharing :)

It was fairly bland.  The only changes I made were to use half the cream cheese and add a 1/2 cup more cheddar (following the recommendations of other reviewers).  Although it was bland, it made for pretty good comfort food.  My one-year-old won't stop eating it!  I think she would give it 10 stars!  :)

Really very good. I doubled it (we have a big family) and only used 12oz of the cream cheese. The flavor was just there, under the other flavors, but it did make it very creamy. I also didn't bake it but I did put Ritz crackers on top and broil it a minute, until they were brown. Everyone loved it, even my 3 1/2 year old, despite his initial reaction "It's not real mac and cheese mommy, it's not even yellow!"

Much too rich and the dijon flavour was a hit with adults but hard for kids to take.  There were too many bread crumbs and I had to double the pasta amount to make it.  Over all, while it tasted good, there are much better versions of this classic dish available.

I made this for a church dinner and "baked" it in my crock pot on low for about 5 hrs, and it turned out great.  I increased the serving size x4 and every bit of it was gone.  I will make this one again.

I love this recipes and have made it dozens of times! To add a dash healthiness to this decadent dish, I chop up a crown of broccoli and add it to the macaroni when it has just two minutes left to cook. I bake it in my toaster oven with a foil cover (or the top will burn) I remove the cover for the last five or less minutes so the top crisps up. Also, while the original bread crumb topping is fine, my favourite is crushed corn flakes and either mozzrella or cheddar cheese. YUM!

I'm sure this is very tasty if you LOVE cream cheese. I like cream cheese, but went ahead and halved the amount the recipe called for. I just did not care for it. However, it was a hit with my two year old!

I made this for my daughter's 1st birthday party. I doubled the sauce recipe and used a 14 oz box of pasta. I made the recipe and instead of baking it, put it into the slow cooker (just to keep it warm). It was very good and I received many compliments. My husband said it tasted more sophisticated than your plain old mac and cheese.

This was really delicious. I doubled the amount of pasta and  butter and used 1 cup of half and half in place of the second cup of milk. Very easy, very quick and very tasty. I would make it again certainly - next time, I would add maybe a sharper cheese as I agree with the previous reviewer in that it could use a bit of a kick. All in all -  A+!

This recipe makes great mac and cheese. The flavor is very cheesy but the cream cheese keeps the texture light. I use reduced-fat cheeses and there is no significant difference in flavor. I also add chopped broccoli and the family loves it. Can't make it too often though, as all that butter and cheese tends to make my husband's digestive system suffer.

Pretty good mac and cheese i used cheddar and colby jack cheeses to top with, used more than was called for b/c I didn't feel the recipe used enough cheese for macaroni and cheese but other than that very good recipe, will use again thanks!

It was one of the best Mac and Cheese recipes I have found but it still wasn't the greatest. I used sharp cheddar and a blend of Jack...I still felt as though it needed some cayen pepper or something to give it a little bit of a kick...

I have to say this dish is a HUGE hit with everyone I make it for.  It's always a request.  I did change up the recipe alittle I do 1 cup of cheddar cheese & 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. And I left out the cream cheese.

Not the best Mac and Cheese. The cream cheesewas way too much. Cutting the amount in half would be much better in my opinion. Doubt I'll make it again.

I feel bad reviewing this recipe so poorly after so many good reviews, but it just wasn't that great in my opinion. I followed the directions exactly. My husband took one bite and wouldn't eat anymore, he said it was too cream cheesy, and I agreed. My kids didn't care for it, either. I will stick with my original recipe.

This is a great mac & cheese recipe!!  I did not add the bread topping, as my kids don't like that, and it was great anyway.  This has already become a staple in our household.

My husband said this is the best mac and cheese I've ever made and maybe the best he's ever eaten!!  The only change I made was to do 1 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup half and half (I ran out of milk). Also, I made my own topping with ritz crackers, butter, Aunt Janes salt, and garlic pepper. I also added about a little more cheddar cheese since I shredded it myself and had a little extra.  My husband and I enjoyed ours a little spicier than the children so we added hot sauce or cayenne after serving.  It was delicious.

This was terrific! I made it last night.  I did add 1 cup of Velveeta cheese to the recipe.  It made it very creamy.  Instead of using bread crumbs for the topping I used Triscuit sundried tomato and olive oil crackers!  It was a hit!!!

Great recipe, however it got 5 stars for the adjustments I made... not to sound proud or anything, but it was really good.  I followed another reviewers advice and used some heavy cream, I also used 1lb box of macaroni.  I combined 2C cheddar as recommended, 1C Cloby and 1C Monterey Jack.  I sauteed some chopped onion in the butter before adding the flour.  Then the topping:  More cheese, breadcrumbs and slices of browned smoked turkey sausage.  Oh, it was very good.  I do, however, sugguest serving a side dish that is high in fiber :)

Anyway, I followed directions to a "T," just added in a bit more cheddar & cayenne as suggested.  I will say that the flavor of this mac & cheese is great!  I would have never thought of using the cream cheese, but it adds something.  However, I can't get this texture thing down.  Every homemade mac & cheese I make (about 4 different, highly-rated recipes now) comes out sort of gritty-like when it starts to cool down instead of creamy.  I know it's got to be something in my technique along the way b/c not all of these mac&cheese recipes could be like this and still get the high ratings, but I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.  Help! :)  I would like to try this recipe again once I've figured out my flaw, and re-rate it properly.  Thanks.

I didn't care for this recipe.  I found it to be bland and unappealing.  I did use the full amount of cream cheese as called for, but probably could have used less.  It just seemed to be missing something.

This was pretty fabulous mac n' cheese.  Rich and creamy, I like the addition of the cream cheese, I think that's what made it so much better than other recipes I've tried, I'll definitely make this again.

I made this recipe because I was intrigued with the use of cream cheese in home made mac.  I didnt change any of the recipe, I kept it just as it was.  I found it to be creamy but a bit bland. I would make this again but next time I'd add more seasoning or.....anything to make it a bit more interesting.

Just had this for dinner and everyone loved it.  I, too, used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese and only 6 oz. and it came out great.  I also used a 12 oz can of evaporated milk and 1/2 cup of milk to replace the 2 cups of milk in the recipe.

I was pleasantly surprised. My children loved this recipe and keep begging me to make that "yummy, creamy mac n' cheese". I did follow the suggestions of previous reviewers and add a bit more cheese. I also varied it a bit and added mozarella, and asiago. Very, very good!

I have been looking and looking for a recipe like this one.  Hands down, this is the best mac and cheese I've ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I'll skip the bread crumbs. I used cream cheese with 1/3 the fat and it tasted great!

YUM!!  This was so good and really easy.  I left off the topping but did the rest of the recipe as written and it rocked!  I had never heard of using cream cheese in homemade macaroni but it was really good, made it nice an d creamy and gooey.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and found it quite good. I made a few modifications. I only added about 1/4 cup of cream cheese and 2 cups of non-fat milk. Additionally I added several shakes of cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit.
It was delicious with Italian bread crumbs.
I did find it a little time consuming for a week night so will probably make next over a weekend.

Never made mac and cheese from scratch and I am always on the look out for simple recipes as I work full time.  This was perfect as I already had everything on hand.  I upped the amount of macaroni just to make the servings stretch, and used Sharp cheddar because that is what I like.  This was near perfect for us.  I am not a fan of bread crumb topping and love a good layer of crisp cheese over the top.  So that's what I did.  Yum!
I was even told this was "just like Mom's."

This recipe was easy and tasted great. It made a lot for 6 people. I used sharp cheddar and added a little extra pepper. The leftovers were pretty good too. My kids loved it. I plan to try it with low-fat cream cheese next time.

Not horrible, but rater bland.  Ok for people who like mild tastes.  I thought there was a bit too much crumb topping.  If I ever make this again, I will probably leave that off altogether.

This was my first mac and cheese with cream cheese, and it was very nice. Next time I would add some pepper jack cheese, but on a whole it was very creamy and nice. I used sharp cheese, as I always do.

Great!  The crumb topping is a little generous, but good if you like it.  I browned some smoked sausage and added that to the mac/cheese, along with some grilled green and red peppers.  Amazing mac and cheese dinner.

I'm not sure how much 7oz macaroni is so I just used two cups and that was just right. I also used seasoned bread crumbs. We thought it was very good and my kids loved it.

My family didn't care for this recipe.  I didn't have enough regular cheddar so I added a little Mexican flavored cheddar.  I'm not sure if this had anything to do with it.  I also used crushed butter crackers instead of breadcrumbs.  I won't be making this again.

I served this dish at a small gathering and everyone loved it! The only thing I will change next time is the amount of bread crumbs. It was a bit too much, but still delicious.

Very good!  I recommend not skimping on cream cheese, as this gives it the creamy flavor.  If you have  the Kraft Mac and Cheese at home, you can use the cheese flavor in the recipe in place of 2c cheddar.  Soooo good!  Thanks for recipe!

I gave this 4* because my fiance loves it but I think that it is WAY too rich.  I have made the recipe twice simply because he loves it so much, but I like macaroni that you can eat a lot of and that is really "gooey cheesy," and this recipe is not. It is instead very, very creamy.  If you like rich and creamy mac and cheese, you should definitely love this recipe.  I should tell you that the first time we made it we substituted velveeta cheese for the cheese in the recipe, as another reviewer suggested.  The second time we still used velveeta, but I also put in sharp cheddar.  Adding the sharp cheese didn't help the richness or the texture at all.  I am sure I will make this again as Mark loves it so much, but I will reduce the portion size to 1, and find a different recipe for myself.

Pretty good. . . left out the mustard because I thought it sounded weird.  I also used about 2/3 c. heavy cream plus 1 1/3 c. milk instead of 2 c. milk.  It was nice and creamy, but a bit bland.  We put seasoning salt on right before serving and that helped a lot.

This is one of my all time favorite comforte food recipes.  The cheese sauce is delicious and easy to make.  I was a residential counselor in a home for girls for a year, and even though they were extremely picky eaters, this recipe satisfied them all.  A miracle!

Gained excellent reviews when I served it for a New Years lunch.  It was described as "fancy" macaroni and cheese when in reality it was very easy to make.  And it is still delicious reheated! Thank you.

I loved this recipe, my husband who is very picky about macaroni and cheese loved it.  i used seasoned bread crumbs and it overpowered the cheese taste so next time i will probably leave the bread crumbs out all together 
thanks ;-)

This was really, really good! I was looking for another recipe for mac and cheese because I found the one I had to floury and just very average. This did the trick. The secret seemed to be in the cream cheese! It made it extra smooth and rich. I did decrease the flour by a bit as well as the mustard because my other recipe sed mustard and I found the taste too strong. Also I didn't use the breadcrumbs but it was just as good without them.
