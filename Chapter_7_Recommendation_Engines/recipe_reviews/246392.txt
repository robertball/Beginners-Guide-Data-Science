Yours is Pretty Good!  I am always looking for new ways to cook canned corned beef.    I usually tweak it a bit by omitting the potatoes and corn and adding in fried sweet plantanos,  1/2 cup of ketchup, 1 Sazon packet and a teaspoon of Adobo.  The bananas adds a little sweetness to the savory/saltiness and when put this over white rice.  Yummy!  This is one of my favorite Spanish dishes.
