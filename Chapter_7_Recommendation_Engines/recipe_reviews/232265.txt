Great way to get your kids to eat their veggies! We had an extremely busy day today, and this came together quickly. I used cannellini beans, because that's all I had in my pantry. We also don't care for green pepper, so I used orange & yellow sweet peppers instead. Overall, we liked it!

I'm giving this 5 stars because my 17 and 12 year olds detest too many veggies in their meals, but they both loved this.   My husband and I enjoyed it too.  Will definately make again.

Delicious and different. I needed to use up some frozen shredded zucchini and this worked great. I didn't thaw it - just threw it in on top of the ground beef. Also used a can of corn since that is what I had.  Felt very healthy. Will make it again.

Very Veggie Beef Chili Haiku: "Great on this cold night. We all devoured our bowls. The kids included!" I halved the recipe b/c I only had 1 can of black beans and 1 can of diced tomatoes, but I kept the ground beef at 1 lb and all of the seasoning at the written ratio. The spice was right, the veggies were great - overall chili success, and even better w/ crushed Fritos, cheese and Sriracha on top.

We loved this combination of vegetable soup and chili. I actually added a few extra vegetables (some frozen chopped broccoli, for instance) and had to substitute in a can of Rotel Original because I was a can of tomatoes short. It was so good that I will do so in the future as well.

If I call it taco soup, some of my kids enjoyed it more. I added cilantro and topped it with olives, cheese, sour cream, chopped onion, avocado and salsa. It was DELICIOUS!!!

Absolutely delicious! We halved the recipe but accidentally doubled the chili powder. It turned out so well that we'll double the chili powder again next time.

This recipe is fantastic! It can be a 'kitchen sink' of leftover veggies or follow the recipe as is - I've made it several times and try to keep individual servings in the freezer for days when there is nothing for lunch. Chop some lettuce, add some tortilla chips and you have yourself a taco salad! Thanks for sharing your recipe - it's become a family fav!

We liked this recipe and it can be adapted for slow cooker.!  Made it with lean ground turkey and after step 2, put it in slow cooker on high for 4 hours (I think it would be fine on low for even longer).   A little sweet for us so would reduce the brown sugar and increase the cumin and chili powder next time but overall a good recipe and will definitely use it again.

Really great way to get plenty of fiber...I always used sugar in my chili,  but the brown sugar really topped it off...I will never use plain sugar again...if you can have sugar and carbs in your diet, don't leave the brown sugar out.
I didn't have the peppers so I used okra instead...Worked out well...This recipe is versatile, you can add whatever vegetables you have on hand...

I liked it but I wasn't crazy about it. I think the problem could have been I made it too spicy. Next time I would add less pili pili and pepper. I omitted the brown sugar and corn. I used ground seitan instead of ground beef to make it vegetarian.

I’ve made this numerous times and have always changed the recipe just a bit when I make it, primarily by adding different types and quantities of veggies- and this recipe is great for that kind of thing! I don’t care for the paprika, so that’s the only spice I skip, and add extra chili powder in its place.

STARBOARDJEN thank you so much for this recipe. When I saw the recipe with all of those veggies, I knew I had to make it. There were some changes due to what I had on hand (I used a meatloaf mix of beef, pork, & veal, tomato sauce instead of crushed tom., black & pinto beans, and no corn. I served it with shredded cheddar and sour cream. We all loved it. My brother even had 2nds, something he never does.  This is a definite keeper.

This dish is absolutely great. Lots of vegetables, great flavor. I don't use the brown sugar, and it was still great. Added cut green beans. Wonderful!!

I loved this recipe. I've been on the search for the perfect chili with the best selection of veggies and one that also packs a great amount of flavor with just the right seasonings. Its hearty, mild heat and great texture. I made it without the black beans and added a little bit of extra salt to my liking and it came out perfect. Needless to say, I'll definitely be making this time and time again.

OK....i bought all these veges so I thought I would forgo my usual chili recipe and try something new. I questioned the minuscule amount of  the spices so I pumped the chili powder to 2 T, cumin to 2 t +, 1 t oregano, more salt, it was too sweet with that much brown sugar--still blah! Would NOT MAKE IT AGAIN!

This basic recipe is a staple in my house. I can hide SO many veggies in it without hurting the flavor. ?? sometimes I leave the zucchini/squash in chunks, sometimes puree it. Sometimes I substitute pureed pumpkin for the zucchini or yellow squash.

Great! I typically don't like red meat but I made it with ground beef and it was wonderful. All the veggies made it so the beef was wonderful.  Healthy vegie/meat dish. Thanks.

I made this and it was amazing! I'm not a huge fan of zucchini and squash, but this tasted great! It made a great big pot full and my husband and I loved it more and more as the week went on.  I enjoyed it so much, it's a favorite chili recipe!
