As written, I would give this a 2 (reduce the sugar & it might get bumped up). It is EXTREMELY sweet, TOO sweet. Coming from me (who has a candy stash @ ALL times), this says alot! I love sweet stuff, cake, cookies, chocolate, Airheads, you name it. I love the stuff, but this is comparable to swallowing a spoonful of sugar :P It got the extra star from the vanilla & brown rice together, otherwise I would've given it a 1. I was really craving rice pudding, but this did NOT do it for me.  :\

I was looking for a way to use up left-over brown rice.  This turned out great!

Yum! I've never had rice pudding so I wasn't sure what I was in for. My husband has diabetes so I used a bit less than 1/2 cup of Splenda and 1 T packed brown sugar in place of the sugar. Still not really good for a diabetic, but he can have a few bites. I only had regular raisins and they were pretty packed together so I added them in early. This gave them a bit of time to plump up. I make a homemade version of pumpkin pie spice so I used that in place of the cinnamon & used more because I love it :) Thanks for sharing!

The brown rice texture was great, and the sweetness was perfect for my liking.

This rice pudding is yummy! I made this recipe as written and I enjoyed it. I may use less sugar next time but it wasn't too sweet for me as written.

Excellent recipe! This is my go-to recipe whenever I have leftover brown rice.  It is sweet, but not overly so.  The longer you stir the thicker it gets. Yum!

Very disappointed.  I followed the directions but it never became pudding. It's more like sweet crunchy soup.  Waste of good ingredients.

We're trying to get healthier, and I nearly only use brown rice. I had never tried rice pudding with brown rice, so I gave this a whirl. It wasn't bad, but it was nothing like the incredible white rice pudding we're used to (Creamiest Rice Pudding on this site). We'll be going back to that for rice pudding and saving the brown rice for suppers. If you do make this, cut the sugar to 1/3 cup; no more is needed.

Tried this recipe because I wanted to find an alternative to using Jasmine rice.  Especially since I am having to use Brown Rice as the alternative.

I cooked it following the directions and I became concerned when the consistency was not like my grandmother's recipe that has been passed down to me.

The end result was very watery, soupy and not the same or similar consistency that was expected.  I ended up adding more egg and sugar to compensate and it was close but not the same.
