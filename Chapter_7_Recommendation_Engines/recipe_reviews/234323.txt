Almost perfect recipe but way too salty. I did use Himalayan salt not sea salt so not sure if that has something yo do with it but I'd half the salt anyways. Otherwise super yummy with a healthy pumpkin or hummus dip!

Taste wasn't great but I ate them because they were "healthy". I learned that chia seeds have to be expanded in water before they are used.

In retrospect, I wish I'd added more water to this recipe.  With the stated amount, the dough was very hard to roll out or even press between the fingers. The result was crackers that are almost too hard to bite into.  I didn't find them especially tasty, either.  I won't be making this recipe again.
