This was good and I will make this again. My house smelled like an Indian restaurant as I was making this. Chile peppers were omitted because I didn't have any. It will still moderately spicy. After 20 minutes, the cauliflower was still crunchy, so I ended up cooking it almost double the length stated in the recipe. I served it with whole wheat pitas and sour cream.

Overall pretty darn good. But we found it to be so spicy it was almost inedible. Next time I will cut down on the cayenne pepper. I also found that the cooking time was almost double what was recommended, to get my cauliflower cooked all the way through.
I also substituted chickpeas for potatoes, chopped ginger for the ginger paste, added cilantro and used the entire can of coconut milk because I wanted it saucy. Served over rice and it was so good.

My husband and I love spicy food so this was a great recipe for us!  This is not for those who prefer mild dishes.  Like Candice, I wanted the dish to be a little saucy so it could be served over rice.  I used about 3/4 can of coconut milk.  Also, I read the reviews which state that the cauliflower takes too long to cook.  So while I was preparing the rest of the dish, I steamed the cauliflower in a separate pot.  Then I added the steamed cauliflower to the dish to cut down on the cook time.  Don't steam too much or the cauliflower will become mushy after cooking it with the rest of the dish.

Pretty good recipe... although I did leave out the peppers (it was plenty spicy for me without!).  I would cut the potatoes smaller, the cauliflower was done faster than the potatoes.  I used a dutch oven to make this... probably would work better with a non-stick pan... all the spices were sticking to the bottom of the pot.  I did de-glaze with some stock to pick these bits up!

I LOVE this recipe. However, it has taken me a few tries to figure out how to best orchestrate cooking all of the elements without scorching/turning things to mush/etc. The following works well for me: Cover the potatoes and cook them in some vegetable oil until they are pierceable but not fully done, stirring occasionally (takes around 10 minutes for me, but I usually double the recipe). Take them off the heat, THEN proceed with the recipe as written, adding the potatoes back in at the same time as the cauliflower. Also, I definitely recommend adding a bit of water to the spice mixture to form a paste--it prevents scorching so you don't end up with a nondescript "burnt Indian spice" flavor, but rather the fantastic combination of spices given in the recipe. Finally, I usually add a total of about a 1/2 cup of water while the whole dish is cooking, spread out over the full cooking time. You might get by without it, but it helps things to soften a little more quickly. The dish never comes out crunchy for me, but I honestly don't mind at all. Really a great (and super cheap, if you buy bulk spices!) recipe.

I omitted the spicy peppers to fit my four year old, and had to add a bit of water to assist in steaming the cauliflower. It was delicious!

I don't know why, but I had a really hard time with this recipe. The potatoes and spices scorched my pan badly. I added the oil so I don't know what went wrong. I used a nonstick pot. I'm perplexed. I was determined to make it work, so I added a little water and a tad more oil just to keep it from burning. Needless to say, it didn't come out crunchy :( I only cooked mine for the time given, and I liked the crunchier contrast of the cauliflower. I left out the peppers which was a mistake in my opinion, I should have used at least 1/2 of one since I was only cooking for four people. However, in the end of this culinary fiasco, this tasted good. Therefor, I give it four stars. I may try it again tomorrow and see if I can figure it out.

By far this is one of my favorite dishes.  I love traditional Indian food and all of its spices, but unfortunately don't get enough of it.  I've had this dish made by many different chefs and the flavor in this is right there with the best of them.

humm... maybe I didn't something wrong but it didn't taste very good... the after taste of turmeric made it a little bitter and metalic tasting.

Made some minor changes (no serranos, used extra red pepper, etc.) and it was delicious. I'll use this recipe again.

Outstanding, simple prep, easy to understand, easily accessible ingredients. Yep, it's hot. I didn't have any serranos on hand so I subbed some red pepper flakes AND used the full amount of cayenne. I also used organic extra virgin coconut oil for the saute which added a dimension of flavor. This one goes on heavy rotation when cauliflower is in season. I used an enamel coated cast iron Le Creuset pot to make this in. Potatoes having the starch that they do did stick to the bottom. I added small amounts of water during the process to deglaze the pot just a bit, which kind of sped up the cook time. For beginners I'd recommend a good quality non-stick pot with a lid.

We did not enjoy this very much, although we did eat it.  I had trouble with the potatoes and cauliflower scorching on the bottom of the pan and ended up pouring in some water to save it all.  I did use only one chile, as per the submitter's suggestion to adjust to taste.  There seems to be a little something missing from the spice mix or maybe the quantities are out, but the flavour was off compared to other aloo gobi I have tried.

Watched "Bend it like Beckham" and remembered from when I had rented the DVD that there was a recipe for it. So, I decided to give this recipe a try. I purchased some fresh cumin seeds and a couple of the other spices. I used powdered ginger in lieu of fresh and I did not have the chilies. However, I had everything else. I cut the potatoes about 1/2" cubes and small florets of cauliflower. I also added about a 1/4 cup of water to help steam the vegetables. I then finished off with a little extra oil to stir fry a little at the end. We all loved it, it was delicious and I'm going to make it again over the weekend. The dish is very simple, and you can easily change the ingredients to prepare your own take on the dish.

Amazing. I made this as directed except instead of doing it in a pot, I used my cast iron skillet and I used frozen cauliflower instead of fresh. The potatoes took about twice as long to cook, I added a bit of extra oil so they didn't stick and just stirred them occasionally. My cast iron skillet doesn't have a lid, so I just added a bit of water from time to time when cooking the cauliflower. It cooked beautifully and everything came out great. I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe! I blitz the onions with a piece of ginger in the nutribullet to get a nice paste. It is so easy to make! My advice: use a thick bottom (like cast iron) pan. I tried my wok one time and that didn't work well.

This was so delicious, and tasted very authentic!  I made only a few minor changes.  I didn't have any cumin seeds, so I just used ground cumin and added it in when the other spices went in; I'm sure using the seeds adds a bunch more flavor, so I'll need to get some for next time.  I used two jalapenos instead of serrano peppers, and I added the spices by eye, but I'm pretty sure I added closer to a full teaspoon or maybe more for everything that called for just a half.  I don't feel like the heat was too much; in fact, I will add more cayenne next time, but I'm used to eating spicy food.

As others have noted, adding coconut milk is not authentic, this is meant to be a dry dish, and it is perfect that way.  I didn't have any issue with needing liquids, just make sure you add oil as needed.  I cooked this in a cast iron pan, which I highly recommend doing.  I will definitely be making this again, it's one of my new favorite dishes!

Edited to add: I've since gotten the cumin seeds and now use them every time I make this, which is usually every month now.  I also use coriander seeds and put them in at the same time as the cumin instead of using the ground coriander, which I recommend trying!

THIS IS SO GOOD.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using only 1/2 of a serrano chili.  For the final step, 20 minutes resulted in overcooked potatoes and overcooked cauliflower, so the next time I made this, I set the timer for 15 and it came out better.  Just make sure you watch your flame.  When I had three pans cooking on my stovetop, medium worked fine, but when I made it the second time the aloo gobi was the only thing on the stovetop and it burned a little.  I do have a craptastic stove, so maybe it's just my luck. When I make this again (and I will!), I'll be setting the final timer for 13 minutes and checking on the doneness. 

I paired this with a sweet and savory rice side and extra garlicky madras curry chicken drumsticks that were crisped in the oven and it was great.  Pungent, spicy, sweet, savory, salty, it's all there!  :D

I took away a star due to no indication of the variability of the final cook time, which could result in food that is overdone at best, or burnt at worst.  When you're cooking four things at once, you can't be watching each pan like a hawk.

I have made at least 4 different versions and this was by far and away the best!  My cauliflower came out mushy, though, which is what usually happens.  I think part of my problem is not having the correct style pan.  Great flavor!  Overall, it's a keeper!

Quick, easy and delicious.  I took the advice of others and nuked the cauliflower in the microwave for a couple of minutes first.  I also added a splash of vegetable broth to the mixture as it was cooking to keep it from sticking and burning.  Served over rice but you certainly don't need to.  It's very filling even without the rice.

Wonderful exactly as the recipe is written.  I used jalapenos instead of the serrano chiles, and some ginger powder instead of paste, but otherwise followed it exactly.  My wife and I love hot food (this is at the hotter end of the spicy scale) and we gobbled this all up with no leftovers.  I wrote this one down and put it in the recipe box.

It was great added frozen peas and fresh carrots.
Pre cook potatoes to help with the process.
I like my cauliflower firm so only put it in at the end for 5 mins.

This has become a family (well mine at least).  In fact we will serve Aloo alone for dinner perhaps with a veg of some sort.  Once you have a sense of this recipe you can adapt as you wish while maintaining the  curry flavour and add other veg or coconut milk - make it your own.

Very yummy,  I made it in the slow cooker for convenience, so I added a few fluid ounces of chicken broth and a handful of chopped grape  tomatoes from the yard to save the pot from cracking, with a little chopped cilantro for garnish.   I served it with plain yogurt and basmati rice made with half canned coconut milk and water.  Husband at first complained about being meatless, but after one spoonful did a complete about face.  Everyone loved it.  I will make again.  Thank you.

I cooked the cauliflower for 5 minutes first in the microwave to soften a bit, then the 20 minute cooking time was about right. Also, I forgot to get a lemon, so I chopped a tomato to add some acidity at the end instead and fried for a couple minutes.

Followed the recipe, and it’s not good. Dry and burnt. I use cast iron pots, so maybe that’s a factor, but usually this dish has a sauce involved, doesn’t it? I’ll keep looking for a good version of this dish.

Too spicy for the family, but delicious anyway.  I did add a little water as I was worried about the cauliflower burning.  This may have made it mushier, but it was still great.

Really good! I used jalapenos instead of serranos since I had some to use up, and topped ours with some Greek yogurt at the table.

I used ground cumin (because that was all I had on hand) and frozen cauliflower florets (again, all I had on hand) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I suspect that since the cauliflower was frozen and created some extra moisture, it did not fry up 'crispy' exactly, but it was still excellent.  Top points for ease of preparation - the most labour-intensive part of this was peeling the potatoes!  A total breeze!

This was easy to prepare, flavorful and made my house smell so good. My picky husband and son both loved it. I served it with grilled tandoori chicken and buttery basmati rice. I will definitely make this dish again.

This turned out pretty tasty! I reduced the salt by half because I need to limit sodium, and I left out the serrano peppers so the rest of the family could eat it. Instead of paprika, I used powdered red chiles, so I cut the cayenne in half. The heat turned out just right for my family.
