Surprisingly this is very good.  It was a great way to use up leftover chicken. Instead of cooking on the stove I combined the ingredients, put them in a casserole dish and baked for 15 minutes.  I then put the biscuits on top and baked another 20 minutes.  Delicious!

Quick and easy. I made numerous changes based upon what was in my pantry. Saute chicken in olive oil with garlic and added Montreal Chicken seasonings. Placed chicken in 9x13 pan. Added to drained cans of green beans, 1 can cream of mushroom, and 1 can cream of celery and well as 1/2 cup sour cream. Then added 1 teas paprika and mixed well. Baked for 15 minutes. Added refridge biscuits and baked for another 20 minutes. Very filling - my son said I forgot to add pepper!

My family loved this very much - I can't wait to make it again.. ps. I used 98% fat free soup + 1 can of milk. I cooked the veggies w/soup + milk in a separate pot while chicken was boiling -- shredded chicken instead of cubing & added to my veggie mix - let simmer for about 5 mins while biscuits were baking & served .. Very delicious!!!

This was okay. It really was bland, though, so next time I think I'm going to have to add some seasoning.   It was really quick, though, and the left overs were good too.

My boyfriend loved this so much that I only got a few bites for myself.  I have to say getting the biscuts to cook was a challange.  They were burning on top and not getting done on the bottom.  So I flipped them over so they would cook and that worked out fine.

Excellent dish! I did season the chicken before browning and added more seasonings once the soup was mixed in.

I really like this recipe.  It's easy to make and very filling.  I did make a couple of adjustments.  I cooked the chicken with minced garlic to add a little more flavor.  I also used frozen peas, carrots, corn, and broccali.  When I added the cream of chicken I added a half can of water to thin the soup to help thaw the vegetables to have them all cook together.  Alittle salt and pepper and its great.  Oh I also used butter biscuits.  Love it!!!  We always go for seconds after we finish the first.

Meh.  This was OK, just a touch bland.  I prepared on the stove top as directed but added some poultry seasoning for flavor.  Per pp's suggestions, I transferred to a 9x13 pan and baked at 350 for 15 minutes, put the rolls on top and baked for an additional 15 minutes.  I think I would prefer peas, carrots and celery instead of the broccoli and cauliflower.

I threw this together as a last-second dish, and was so pleased with it.  The ingredients are things that I always keep in my cupboards (I made the biscuits with BisQuick and they were amazing, naturally), so this was an excellent spur-of-the-moment meal!  Thank you so much!

I was pleasantly surprised at how very very quick and easy this recipe was- I pulled it together in less than 20 minutes. I would add a few herbs and spices next time, but there's enough salt in the soup that it wasn't tasteless just as is. Nice recipe.

This was pretty bland. Definitely needed some spicing up. It might be okay as a base. I think it would have been better with cream of mushroom soup.

It turned out amazing! The only thing I added to it while I was cooking all the veggies, chicken & soup to it was a little bit of pepper to add some more flavor to it!
