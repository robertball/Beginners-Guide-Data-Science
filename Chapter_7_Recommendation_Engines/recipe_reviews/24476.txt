This is good.  Had it for supper and breakfast this a.m.  Texture is more custardy than a regular quiche.  I used free range eggs which brought out more color.  Very pretty dish.  I wonder if this could be made into little appetizer quiches.

I used real bacon cooked well and I shredded the zucchini. The timing was on. The taste is good and is good for any meal, breakfast, lunch or dinner.

I substituted skim milk for the cream.  Shredded zucchini, did not put in blender.  Too lazy to cook bacon, so left that out. Cooked a bit quicker in my convection oven, and it tastes great.

OMG!!! My family and I just had this and it is fantastic!!! I used real bacon for the bacon bits(I assume that's what I was supposed to do. I didn't have heavy cream so I used my husband's light coffee cream and backed it an extra 15 minutes and it turned-out fantastic! Thank-you so much for this recipe:)

My husband and my sister like this.  I'm not a fan though I did think it was better with Tobasco.  It's nutritious and filling, so I guess it'll work since the rest of the family thinks it is also delicious.

Very good texture, nice soft custard.
Zucchini is very subtle contribution to the flavor
Will probably use ham instead of bacon next time or make bacon very crispy

This was awesome & so easy. I subbed a bag of frozen tri color peppers that I thawed and drained inleau of the zucchini and it turned out great. I may try frozen spinach next time. This is a very versatile & delicious dish!

Big fan of this recipe!  I actually used half yellow squash and half zucchini and used oregano instead of marjoram.  I also left out the bacon to make it vegetarian and it was delicious either way (I've made it several times.)  Will make again when my mom inevitably gives me more zucchini this summer :)

Made this recipe to take to a potluck and served it at a Sunday dinner.  Both guests and family did not like it.  They said it was bland, tasteless, texture less.
