My wife still works the weekends as a baker and cake decorator.  So Mondays
I cook to give her a rest day.  Needless to say, put "easy" in a recipe name
and you'll get my attention every time. This recipe is very easy and delicious.
I made it exactly by the recipe except we had a bag of frozen dumplings so I 
used them. (Remember the part about "easy"? :) It rated a compliment from the
Boss (read "wife").  And I don't get compliments on my cooking.  So it's
gotta be 5 stars.  Many thanks, LUCYBARRON.

Browning the chicken first (in the same pot you'll cook the rest of this in, so you get all those nice brown bits of fond) makes a BIG difference in flavor. I added chopped onion, some minced garlic, and a couple of bay leaves, too.
To thicken, I added a small can of cream of chicken soup, which instantly transformed it into a nice, thick, hearty texture.
The biscuit pieces puffed up nicely in the simmering stew!

Soup was good. I would cut back on the Thyme and Rosemary.  It was to overpowering for our taste buds.  I also would cut back on the amount of biscuit dough that this recipe calls for.  Instead of putting raw chicken into the soup, I put in a rotisserie chicken instead.  Definitely would make this again.

I followed the exact recipe the first time. It was good but I thought it was too much thyme and rosemary. It was a good base to start with because I have never even eaten chicken and dumplings before. The second time I made it I saut√©ed the vegetables in butter then added the chicken. Cooked for about five minutes then added the broth and spices. I added the dough and it was very good. Super quick and easy recipe.

I've made this several times and it's easy and everyone loves it. I season and cook the chicken slowly first and then follow the directions only using half the thyme and rosemary. I'm always a fan of yummy easy!

Amazing recipe!  To add a little more flavor I put three chicken bullion cubes.  I also shredded the chicken because I like it shredded in my chicken and dumplings.  Easy tip:  once the chicken is cooked remove it from the pot, put in a mixing bowl and use a mixer to shred the chicken.  It is so quick and easy!

I used chicken thighs and browned them first. I only used celery, onions, and poultry seasoning, besides salt and pepper.

Wow, way too much seasoning. Thankfully I tasted it before I added the chicken. I double checked the recipe and I made it exactly .  Sorry,  it's a no for me.
