1.19.19  Used low-fat vanilla (would do that again) Greek yogurt, raspberry preserves, and 1 Tbsp of the optional chia seeds.  I wanted to top with some fresh fruit, and the raspberries in the fridge needed to be used up, so thatâ€™s why the raspberry preserves are used.   Never have been super crazy about overnight oatmeal, but this one turned out well.  It was a bit thick, so I stirred in just a drizzle of FF half-and-half to get the consistency I like (personal preference).  The preserves brought a delicate and sweet flavor, simply a good balance with the oats and yogurt.  Nice, simple recipe, thanks for sharing!
