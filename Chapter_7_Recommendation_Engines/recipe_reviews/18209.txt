This has been a family favorite for years. I don't reserve the extra for the top...I just mix all together. People who don't care for the traditional cranberry jellos or sauces love this dish.

This was so tasty! We really enjoyed this salad on our Sunday Brunch table. Its very refreshing, and the cream cheese adds a new dimension to gelatine. Thanks Eleanor!

I made this salad a few years ago and have made it, upon request every year since. I'm not a cranberry person but I really enjoyed this salad.  The only thing I changed is I used canned mandarin orange slices chopped up since I didn't have an orange on hand.  I broke the salad up w/a fork and served it..huge hit!

I passed this recipe along to my mother to make for Thanksgiving.  It turned out very well and was enjoyed by all.  Even the 3 year-olds liked it.

This was pretty good, but to me more like a dessert than a salad because of the sweetness.

OK, followed this recipes loosely, adding in the leftovers and what I had on hand: candied pecans, about 32 oz of fresh crandberry sauce (so I doubled the jello) and used candied pecans instead of walnuts. This is a great base recipe for anything you'd want to add: apples, mandarin oranges, cottage cheese, some people even like to add celery and carrots (not I said the pie, but to each their own). Thanks for sharing and much obliged

Love, Love, Love this! I’ve been making this @ Thanksgiving for my in-laws about 5 years now! I wanted  to introduce them to a jello salad as a regular dish @ Thanksgiving & this one is just right! I prefer using sour cream instead of salad dressing & I add a small can of mandarin oranges drained very well. I also omit the walnuts since the family isn’t a fan of them. I will be making this for many years to come. It is quite yummy!
