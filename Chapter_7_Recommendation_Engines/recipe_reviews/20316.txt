I also find the recipe too sweet.  I rate it as a 5 with the following changes:  Use the rhubarb in a ratio of 2:1 with sugar, for example, 1 C. rhubarb to 1/2 C. sugar.  Also, add a pinch of salt and some vanilla after it has cooked.  My small batch cooked in 4 minutes.

This was way TOO sweet for me.  I had to go get more rhubarb to tone it down, otherwise I would have had to throw it away.  For me half the sugar called for is more than enough and I'm not a fan of sour things.

Yummy! Easy, no-fuss recipe. Thick enough when cool to use as jam on toast. I will make this again, probably with less sugar (the sweet/sour ratio being a matter of personal preference). I will use this method for stewed rhubarb, too: it was 'stewed' at about 7 minutes.

Some slight modifications, but this turned out great!  I used about 2 cups of rhubarb and about 1/4 cup of artificial sweetener (Splenda).  I cooked it for 3 minutes, then stirred, cooking for a total of 12 minutes.  I sprinkled some salt on top, and added about 1 tsp of vanilla.  It is delicious!

Excellent! Brought back childhood memories of dixie cups full of sugar and fresh picked rhubarb stalks! I used 2 cups frozen rhubarb that was cut in pieces; after thawing I diced it, added 1/2 cup sugar and microwaved it at 2 minute intervals stirring each time. We'll use it over my sister's cheesecake this afternoon!

YUMMY!! like others, I seriously decreased the sugar to about 1 cup rhubarb to 1/4 c sugar.  One batch, I used Strawberry Jello and a little water instead of sugar - nice...brings back childhood memories.

This seemed like too much sugar, so I decreased it to 1 1/2 cups - and the sauce still came out more like soup than sauce.  Even after cooling in the fridge, it was still pretty soupy.  I did use sucanot for part of the sugar - maybe that made a difference?  Next time I'll try just 1/4 cup sucanot, and perhaps 1 cup sugar.  The sucanot adds a nice light molassas flavor to the rhubarb.

This was really good with some changes. I used 2 cups of rhubarb to only one cup of sugar. I really felt that this was the perfect ratio of sugar to rhubarb (sweet to tart). This came out with a perfect jelly-like consistency and will be absolutely delicious drizzled over oatmeal, ice cream or cake. YUM!

This was a very quick and easy recipe that tasted really good. I did cut back on the sugar, and added some butter. It was really good over pork chops. Will make again.

Easy, but too sweet. I would suggest cutting back on the sugar and then adding more if you think you need it. I used about 1 1/4 cups of "brown" sugar.  I added a pat of butter and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Mine was much shorter than twelve minutes to be the consistency I wanted, but I did add a little water, so maybe that quickened the process.

I used 1/2 cup of stevia instead of the sugar. Could have used 1/4 cup it was too much.  Ill try again next week.

Great! Much simpler than using the stove top!  I used the red rhubarb from my garden. It's much sweeter than the green rhubarb I remember from childhood, so I only needed about half the sugar noted in the recipe.

This was very good but had to reduce sugar by 1/2 and added salt and vanilla.  Will definitely make it again.
