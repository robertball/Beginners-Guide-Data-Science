Did this recipe twice.  First time, to me, was 4-star.  To make it 5-star, for my family and I, I ditched the cornmeal, subbed buttermilk for the regular milk and doubled it, and used a LOT more cayenne (bringing it closer to the recipe I've always used).  Follow the actual process of preparing the tomatoes and cooking them.  These steps are very important and Chef John has laid them out very well.  When finished, I used my own remoulade recipe (relish, mayo, lemon juice, hot sauce, cayenne, paprika, s&p, blended smooth), and stacked my tomatoes with crab cakes, with the remoulade (mixed with tiny salad shrimp) over all.  DELISH!!!!

These were the BEST fried green tomatoes that I've ever had! My family loved them. I paired it with Chef Johns crockpot pot roast (made mine in the oven and tweek'd it a bit with beer) with mashed potatoes, mushrooms, onions and carrots. It was delicious!!!!

I have always wanted to try fried greens since the movie came out and finally with the help of Chef John hilarious video I took the leap. I was not expecting much just a novelty food and I was pleasantly surprised--these things are pretty good. Will have to work on my southern drawl next. Another home run--thanks Chef John

This recipe is excellent! I usually shy away from any vegetable but so very happy I tried these.  This is the third time in a month!!!  It is a wonderful way to use up those end of the season green tomatoes in the garden.  Did not change anything in the recipe. Just make and enjoy!  Thanks Chef John.

These were so easy and delicious, even for a novice like me!  I would not change a thing!  I followed the directions EXACTLY, setting out the tomatoes to drain, keeping them in the flour for a while, pushing in the cornmeal, and this is the first time the coating didn't come off something I was trying to fry!  I made these to accompany Chef John's Crab Cakes, which were also wonderful!

Do not look any further for another Fried Green Tomato recipe; you will not beat this one.  The most novice cook will look like a 5 star chef serving these.  Follow Chef John's advice and you will be a Southerner in no time.  I used Italian panko bread crumbs and added one additional egg white to the two whole eggs and milk station.  Please make sure you let them set for 10 to 15 minutes once breaded as I believe it makes all the difference.  Also, make sure to follow the step regarding drawing out the water from the tomato slices.  The remoulade sauce puts this dish over the top. Liked the movie, loved the dish.

I have wanted to try fried green tomatoes since the movie came out and Jessica Tandy had that heavenly smile when she them.
Well Chef John I was not disappointed! These are awesome!!! Followed recipe to a "T". Now my only problem is "How will I ever be able to eat a vine ripened tomatoe again"? LOL 
Just delicious! The sauce is a hoot loved it too and can spice it hot!truly a keeper. 10 stars wouldn`t be enough!

An easy and delicious recipe. Chef John's recipes and videos are the best. I followed instructions to a T with good results. The only change I will make is to cut back on the flour, corn meal and bread crumbs, imo only one egg is needed. I prepared 8 slices of tomatoes, twice as many as indicated with a nice thick coating but tossed out a LOT of leftover coating mix. I also cut the salt in half. I plan to make these again tonight.

Love these.  Had never had a good fried green tomatoes before.  Tried last year and wasn't impressed so went looking for another recipe.  Since my tomatoes still haven't ripened this year I might be eating allot of these.

This is the very best fried green tomatoes I have ever had. Followed the recipe exactly after watching the video. Perfection. Better than anything I've had in southern restaurants too.

Best recipe for fried green tomatoes I've found! Even my husband, who used to hate green tomatoes, liked these. He says before that they used to taste bitter. I think salting them before breading made the big difference. I also cut mine thinner than 1/2". More like 1/4"

Not sure yet.  First time making fried green tomatoes, and my timing was definitely off.  I burnt them a bit.  I liked the texture, but I think next time I'll add more flavour.  I probably didn't add enough hot sauce.  Love Chef John and will definitely try again.

Followed the recipe exactly, and OH MY GOSH, these fried green tomatoes are divine! They are restaurant quality. I usually find the breading falling off of things I fry, but thanks to Chef John saying to allow them sit 10 minutes with the breading, I think I just learned the secret! Some of my family members had them also, and raved about how wonderful they were. Thank you for this recipe!

The tomatoes I used were unripe red tomatoes, and the tartness in this recipe was exquisite. This will become a side dish to many of our meals in the future.

Very good but not as crispy as I like. I will try one of the other contributors next because I remember the taste and texture being pretty crispy.

Followed the recipe exactly. This is a keeper! Talk about crispy! They were perfect. Even cold from the frig the next day they were yummy. Decided to use some of the leftover coating on fish. We had fried green tomatoes and crispy cod fillets. The presentation wouldn't have earned me any points on a cooking show - all same batter and color, but hey, this is a once a year treat when all the green tomatoes come in before the first frost. It was dynamite on the green tomatoes and the fish. Next up is zucchini! I know that's gonna rock too.

Yes I will make it again but next time I would slice the tomatoes a little thinner.  Following directions is important to the success of this recipe.

I subbed buttermilk for milk and the amounts were way off -- I had TONS of leftover breading and flour. Not bad but I'm not much on fried foods in general and in part because of the work and mess. They tasted good --- I also used a very spicy dip I'd made as a sauce -- but due to the work and mess, I'll stick to ordering these in a restaurant

A southern girl myself, these are way too thick. Cut them much thinner and I just use cornmeal.   No need for all the egg and flour. I dip mine in ranch dressing. Grew up on these and that's the only way I make them.

This recipe is excellent!  Crispy coating and soft juicy green tomato. The sauce is delicious too. I was out of relish so I substituted with capers. My only question is who would consider one slice a serving?!  Not this southerner.

OMG,  this recipe is easy and awesome!  Delicious!

We were going to go to a restaurant where they serve Fried Green Tomatoes and instead our community hosted a Farmers Market and at the vegetable stand they were selling Green Tomatoes.  We bought some and on the way home, I was looking on-line for a recipe and luckily came across this one.  I used this recipe and the Fried Green Tomatoes were so delicious, we couldn't stop eating them!  If you want an easy, delicious recipe - Chef John's recipe is the ticket!  Thank you for sharing!

Really hard and crunchy...think the tomato was way to hard.
Next will try 1/4", not 1/2" slices.

These were the best fried green tomatoes I've ever made!  I did remove some of the seedy parts for less moisture.   Very crispy and great flavor!

The only change I made to this wonderful recipe was to use panko bread crumbs (because that's what I had).  Crunchy on the outside and creamy inside.   A real winner.

Made these for the first time with the recipe as-is and took the time to do each step so they didn't turn out soggy. Worked great and no leftovers. Very good tartar recipe too. Yummy!  Thank you.

I followed Chef John's receipt, but made only subtle changes (health reasons). Neither one of us ever had fried green tomatoes.  Let me tell you----Chef John and his receipts are fabulous!  One of the best things we ever ate.  Keep them coming Chef John!

absolutely perfect.  I have been making fried green tomatoes that were really good, but I had a hard time keeping the coating on. With the trick that were shown in the video I can now say that  my fried green tomatoes are perfect.

Loved them! My first time trying them so I really dont have anything else to compare them too, but so good I dont think I will try another way. It had a taste that reminded me of a verde sauce in Mexican cooking.

These were good.  Learning the flour/egg/cornmeal & breadcrumb technique including the resting times was a real added bonus.

Just as I remember. Used the exact recipe but ended up with leftover flour and cornmeal/breadcrumb mixture. I adjusted the next batch and it still came out delicious.

Awesomeness! I've tried other recipes unsuccessfully in the past. The only change I made was adding some cayenne pepper to the bread crumb & cornmeal mixture. Turned out nice and crispy outside & yummy juiciness inside. Dipping sauce is awesome too.

Loved this recipe!  Made it according to the recipe and it turned out great, easy too. The remoulade really added a great taste.  Try it!  I did put some of the finished tomato slices in a 250 degree oven to keep warm and they didn't get soggy.  So good!

My tomatoes had blossom end rot and I didn't want to waste them so I found this recipe! After cutting the rotten part off, I cut them up. I used homemade bread crumbs I had in the fridge from a loaf that didn't quite work out. (As you can see, I don't like to waste!) I also used wheat flour for dredging in place of the white. As for the sauce, I don't have hot sauce so instead I used some horseradish sauce. It turned out really good! I do believe fried green tomatoes are an acquired taste, but these were very palatable. This coming from someone who lives just down the road from the Whistle Stop Café where the movie was filmed~

Yum-O! It takes a little time (mostly in the waiting), but this is delicious and gave me a great way to use the last tomatoes on vine before the first frost.  I used cornstarch instead of flour for an extra crispiness.

Chef John does a good job of describingthe process of cooking the tomatoes.I also used buttermilk, instead of regular milk. atop the tomatoes with goat cheese and made a Louisiana remolaude sauce.

I absolutely L-O-V-E-D this, Chef John!!! So very impressed indeed!!! I confess that I made a few adjustments to the recipe to fit my groove, for example, I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil, red tomatoes rather than green (store's I went to really didn't have green tomatoes), chili pepper rather than cayenne pepper, wheat flour instead of the plain ole white flour, sea salt rather than regular salt, & I cooked my tomatoes for longer to make them a little more crisp. I was SO very pleased as well as impressed, & Chef John was not only a fabulous chef to learn from, but his positive & peppy attitude as well made it a fun experience for me!!! I WILL be back to check out some more of his recipes!!! Thanks from my mom & I!!! :-) ) ) P.S... Personally, in my opinion, no dip is needed for this recipe... It is great as is, I do recommend to cut the tomatoes just a tad thinner & maybe just tomatoes that are a little smaller if you prefer them a little more crispy, but don't get me wrong, they are still awesome his way too!!!

First attempt at fried green tomatoes...second time I ever ate them. Even the family members who turn up their noses at vegetables ate it because they loved the sauce..used spicy instead of sweet relish
