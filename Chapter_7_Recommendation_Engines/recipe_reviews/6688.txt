This is the most delicous bread I've ever tasted in my life. It was easy to cook and I had a great time doing that.

Lovely loaf, I didn't have any currants left so I used golden raisins and added fresh grated nutmeg(just because I like it), and a tsp of vanilla.  Will deffinately keep the recipe and make again through out the year.

Not bad.   I didn't have any candied fruit other than the lemon peel, so it was probably a bit different in flavor.  It has taken me forever to use up my candied fruit, however, so I was not about to buy another couple of containers and start over.  This bread is very moist, even though it had quite a crust on it.  Mine was done at an hour, surprisingly, as my oven often requires longer for quick breads.  It's very pretty but not my favorite--but I'm not so sure I like candied fruit much.  I did like the currants in this.  Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out great.  I loved it, but no one else in my family liked it.  They don't like candied fruit.  Who knew!  It's still an excellent recipe, so maybe I will make it for bake sales.  I'm sure it will go well then!

I had some candied fruitcake mix on hand, as well as some candied ginger and slivered almonds, so I used those instead of what the recipe calls for.  I actually used about 1/4 cup more fruit in total, too.  I like it.  I think the ginger is an excellent addition.  I'm not too fond of how hard and crusty the outside of the bread got, but I think if I had covered it right after it came out of the oven, it would have softened a lot more.  I'm not sure if I'll use this particular recipe again, but I like the concept quite a bit.

This is a very good quick bread recipe, and I will definitely make it again. The only change I made was to the types of dried fruit I used, based on what I had on hand. We ate ours warm out of the oven, and it was light, fruity, with a nice crust.

I had a surplus of assorted dried fruit so decided to give this a try.  It was delicious - much better than I expected.  and easy to make.  It was still good after a week and delicious toasted.
Don't feel constrained by the dried fruits in the recipe.  You can use almost anything.  and more than they state if you like it that way.
