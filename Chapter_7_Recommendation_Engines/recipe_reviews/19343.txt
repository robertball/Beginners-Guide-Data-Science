We vacationed in Italy this summer, and had meat sauce that was wonderful and very different from the typical American version; much more meaty with tomato used more as a seasoning. This recipe fulfilled my hopes of being much more like a true Italian meat sauce. It was outstanding and my family loved it! Even my 2 pickiest kiddos who have flatly refused to eat spaghetti in the past gobbled it up. I doubled the recipe, seasoned the meat with some Emeril's essence, added more garlic than called for. Also added a can of tomato sauce in place of one of the cans of beef broth(3 cans beef broth, 1 can tomato sauce). This is our new spaghetti recipe; we absolutely love it! If you like a meaty sauce, you should definitely try this one.

This sauce was terrific.  I read most of the other reviews and I agree that it had more of a beefy flavor and that is what sets it apart from other spaghetti sauces.  I used 2 cans of 14.5 oz beef broth because I couldn't find 10.5 oz cans and I also added a 15oz can of tomato sauce plus 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon of italian seasoning.  I will be making this sauce in bigger batches in the future to freeze.  I won't ever buy bottled sauce again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

AWESOME!!! My family wanted spaghetti tonight, but I dreaded the regular old tomato/marinara sauce.  I am pregnant and could just hear the heartburn calling my name.  I saw this recipe and made it according to instructions (no mushrooms though) and I am in love!!!  It was great. The flavor was just right.  Not too acidic.  The kids liked it.  Hubby liked it.  I made a large batch and we are freezing the rest!!!  THANK YOU, THANK YOU for the recipe!!

Loved having a beef style with no acidic tomato taste.
  simmering with the lid off for 2 hrs makes the sauce a perfect consistency.
  Family loves it

This was really good and a mild flavored sauce. Definitely not too tomatoey as some can be. My husband really liked it and asked that i make this one again. I used some dried celery and only a couple of T worth, canned portabella mushrooms, a can of tomato puree 10oz., and added a can of chicken broth as it was too thick after only 1 hour of simmering and it was all I had. I tossed in some corkscrew and rotini pasta and cooked it in the sauce adding broth as needed since I had everything pasta-wise BUT spaghetti on hand. It made sort of a pasta goulash that way and turned out really well. My diet conscious hubby even went back for seconds! Thanks for a great supper.
UPDATE: 12.01.10 I made this again using fresh celery, fresh mint, and the tomato paste this time. I still used the canned portabella pieces. This knocked hubby's socks off once again! I used a large box/container of beef broth and then added a can of chicken after the first hour as it was too thick.  AWESOME recipe! Thanks!

Not a big fan of this sauce. It tastes too beefy (due to the amount of beef broth added)...no real hearty tomato flavor to it at all. I was disappointed.

I thought this was pretty good.  It's very "beefy" tasting and has a sort of rustic quality to it.  It doesn't sport a bold tomato flavor.  I almost feel like it would greatly benefit from adding some more herbs and crushed garlic about 15 minutes before it's completly finshed cooking.

This recipe is definitely a main stay. I added a half a pound of Italian sausage along with the ground beef, omitted the dried mint, because I couldn't find any.  Kid tested positive.

Good flavor but for me this was a bit runny. Tried reducing it down, but it didn't work. May try again but with less beef broth.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I changed just a few things because of what I had on hand = left out the mint and used 3 cups beef broth and 1 8 oz tomato sauce. I also browned my ground beef, onions and garlic together and did the mushrooms and butter in a separate skillet. When the mushrooms were sauteed I added to the broth & tomoato sauce mixture and let it simmer a couple of hours.  When I mixed everything together at the end I added the Romano cheese as well.  The pasta ended up absorbing most of the juice and it was so yummy!  I can't wait to make it for the kids - there won't be any left of this pot for them!

This sauce was wonderful!  I will not buy jarred sauce again after making this.  My husband (whose favorite meal is spaghetti) loved it.  He liked the beefy-ness of it.  I did add a can of drained diced tomatoes.  I will add about a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and will  change the amount of sugar to 1 tablespoon next time I make it.  Other than that...it was perfect!

AMAZING. My household loved it ! The sugar gave it a nice sweet taste ! I let it cook for 3 hours, but had to had another cup of broth to keep it liquidy. Can't wait to make it again !

I thought it had a strong beefy flavor, so I added a can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce and two tsp of oregano.  I liked it better after the changes.

I just finished making the sauce and it is beginning it's simmer time. It is the most delicious sauce!! If I didn't have time for the simmering, it is still the best!! So easy to make. I didn't have beef broth, but I had some chicken broth I had just made, and I don't see how it could be better. Thank you for sharing!

Just started making my meat sauce like this. I too have always found spaghetti sauce to be very acidic and usually shied away from it as I suffered all night from it. But this sauce is excellent! I only use 1 can of beef consume and I add some ricotta to it before it's served. Very tasty indeed!

Amazingly delicious!  My husband found this recipe and it has been a dinner staple ever since.  Try adding some red pepper if you like spicy foods.

Excellent flavor and really easy to make.  I didn't have any paste so I used one can of beef stock and a jar of my favorite tomato sauce but turned out great.  

I'm not sure if it was the beef stock or the salt water used to cook the pasta but it was a little salty, I'll def. cut back on that the next time I make it, and I will make this one again.

I loved this sauce.I added a 28 oz. can of tomato sauce and deleted 1 can of the beef broth.I knew my kids would be more receptive this way.It took a little long to prepare with all the mincing but I thought it was well worth it.Next time I will add more mushrooms and reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp.It tasted like an authentic italian sauce you'd get at a nice restaurant.

This was wonderful - rich, thick, with distinct flavor. The freshly grated Romano and chopped parsley on top just added another dimension to the wonderful flavors.

Didn't add the mint and didn't miss it.  This is THE bolognese sauce from now on - I'm not looking anymore! The depth of flavor is sooo good here.  Made it with Lidia Bastianich's homemade gnocchi and the combination was to die for...

After making as is, (we didn't appreciate the mint), I omitted the celery, mint and added a can of 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning.  Perfect.

I LOVED this recipe! This is a keeper...
I personally don't care for mushrooms so I omitted those and chose to use one 14.5 oz beef broth can and I used one 24 oz tomato sauce jar instead of the second beef broth can.  I also used 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of italian seasoning as a previous user did.

My husband LOVED this recipe and so did I!!

I used Bison Burger and took a chance and doubled the recipe so I could have some to freeze.  I am so glad I did.  I didn't have any mint on hand and I am the only family member who likes mushrooms so I left those things out.  This sauce is different than anything I've ever had and it is DELICIOUS!  I will make again and again.  It might be the only spaghetti sauce I ever eat.

Fantastically salty. If you make this one make sure to cut the salt somehow.

I left out the mushrooms and fresh parsley (personal preference) and the recipe was still fantastic. Easy and smells great while cooking.

I was looking for a spaghetti sauce recipe but nothing appealed to me. Then I saw this one and thought I would give it a try. So glad I did. It was fabulous. It's the only sauce I'll ever make! The only ingredient I skipped was the dried mint as I couldn't find any but I'm looking.

I might have overcooked this but it was really good!!  It was meaty and flavorful.  The whole gang loved it!  I cooked it so long that it wasn't watery at all but really just meaty.

THE BEST! My family loves this sauce!  I must make this once a week.  My husband and kids tell me its the best sauce they've ever had. I make sure the hamburger is chopped up really well while I'm browning it.  *-I've sworn off any other meat sauce-*

I thought this was really good.  It was a nice change from my typical bolognese recipe-it had a lighter taste due to the addition of the veggies!  Very good-will make again!

Hmmm...this was kind of like glorified spaghetti. I overlooked one of the important details of letting it simmer for 2 hours and it only simmered for 20 minutes but I don't think that would've helped all that much. The next day it was better. I actually preferred the beef taste as opposed to the tang of tomato but I probably won't make it again. I guess I thought it was going to more of an exotic taste.

Marvelous flavor!  And it's only been simmering for 20 minutes.  Was a little short on the ground beef so added a little bit of Italian sausage ( 4 oz.) to make 1 pound.  Added the garlic with the meat instead of the onions/celery so no chance of burning.  Had to substitute marjoram (part of the mint family) for the mint because I didn't have any; but that's it.  Followed recipe and it's wonderful; easy too.  My second time making sauce from scratch; first time was a teenager and I simmered with the lid on which made it very watery.   Lesson learned. I usually just doctor up a can or jar of sauce, but no more.  Very tasty recipe; no comparison to store bought.  Have added dried mint to my grocery list.  FYI,  to cook spaghetti, you only need about 1 Tbs. of salt in the water and no oil.  Using oil prevents the sauce from sticking to the noodles.  Don't want that to happen.  Always save about 1 c. of cooking water from your cooked pasta in case you need to loosen your sauce.  I ended up using about 1/2 c. this time.  May add a small can of tomato sauce next time to recipe.  Chow!

I actually joined Allrecipes just so I could rate this dish.  I've been making it (as a non-member of allrecipes) and I felt like it was time to give it props publicly!  This is an amazing - and very different - Italian meat sauce. It focuses less on the tomato and more on it's savory flavor.  It is amazing as-is, of course!  BUT, I have been tweaking it over the years and the following things have really amped this dish up.  

I add a full bulb of finely chopped fennel.  I'm not sure why, but it's amazing in this dish.  I add a bunch of chopped celery to amp up the veg. Also, if your kids hate mushrooms, buy dried mushrooms and grind them to a powder in a coffee grinder or similar contraption - this is a winning tip that has made this dish a staple in a non-mushroom home.  1-2 oz dried is plenty.  I fry all the veggies until brown and caramelized, which adds a beautiful flavor to the sauce.  I use home made bone broth for the beef stock. Fresh mint mixed in right before serving is also delicious.  I always double or triple the recipe with fresh ground meat so that I can freeze a batch for later. Oh, and also (I guess this is big) - I make it with ground turkey instead of beef.  No one cares or even notices because of the savory nature of this dish.  So you know how much we love this: all my kids ask that this meal be their "birthday food".

Thanks for this recipe! It's part of our home and our lives and will probably be passed on generationally!

My boyfriend begs me to make this as much as I can. It truly has an authentic, meaty taste. I used all the ingredients listed but I added a can of tomato sauce so It isn't so thick. It tastes more like "sauce" that way. Highly recommend to try but it is time consuming!!

I have not been able to eat spaghetti with meat sauce in years. The acid was too much for me to handle. I tried this recipe and FINALLY I can enjoy spaghetti again. It has an awesome rich flavor without all of the acid. Thank you so so much for posting this recipe.

Loved it!! First time making a sauce from scratch. It far exceeded my hopes. Instead of celery, which I did not have, I used carrots and green peppers. And I didn't have mint, but, it was exceptional! Thank u! Will not use jar sauce again!

My kids love this receipe, and my daughter hates meat. I use a mixture of pork, veal and ground beef to add a bit of flavor , and reduced sodium beef broth, otherwise it is too salty.

It was okay..  Not as good as I expected.  I think it needs more of a tomato flavor rather then a beefy flavor.   I probably will not make this again.

Absolutely delicious!! Did not have a heavy "tomatoey" taste to it. Only gave it 4 stars because I did not make the recipe exactly as stated.Took the advice of some other reviewers and added 2 cans (10.5 oz) of tomato sauce and 1/2 tsp of italian seasoning. Did not have mushrooms either. A definite keeper. Thanks for sharing!!

Very delicious. Cooked for only 1 hour for 3 pers. meal.
Added no salt to the sauce, only for the spaghetti.

My 2 year old loved it with some parmesan on the top :)

Great recipe!  I adjusted as recommended by others just a bit....doubled recipe, used 3 cans low sodium beef broth and one can tomato sauce.  Was a bit thin so added one additional can of tomato paste (for the double batch).  Also wanted a bit more spices so added some italian seasoning and Emerils Essence.

this was wonderful!  made as is except: used better than broth, fresh mint because that's what I had, & 3 cloves of garlic.   The family ate it like they hadn't eaten in weeks.  It did take the full lb of pasta.  excellent.

I left out the sugar, used ground turkey instead of beef, and used Parmesan instead of Romano cheese, and this turned out delicious! I have some pretty bad acid reflux but had been craving a pasta with meat sauce and didn't want to risk a flare up with super acidic tomato sauce, and this was just perfect for what I was looking for. I did not find the flavor to be too beefy as others have said, but maybe that is because I used turkey!

Esta fue una excelente receta, gracias. Agregué tomates asados ??al fuego y pimientos rojos triturados para un poco de calor. Usé pasta para cabello de ángel, cocida al dante, y la arrojé con la salsa. Lo coroné con algunos quesos rallados de parmesano y romano, frescos.

This was by far the best meat sauce I have ever made/ eaten.  I added some smoked sun dried tomatoes, yellow pepper, red wine and more oregano.  Fantastic!

Decades ago, in the 70's, I was backpacking through Europe and when we got to Italy, we were told that the best and least expensive pasta could be found in a tratorria at the train stations. Being young and poor, we dined at the counters of many train stations eating spaghetti, the best I had ever had!! and for just 1 dollar. WELL, after all of these decades searching, HERE IT IS!! I am so happy that I made a double recipe so that I can freeze some. Leftovers tonight and can't wait!! DELIZIOSO!

Very tasty and unique.  A nice change from the usual tomato sauce.  The only changes I made were I used one can of beef broth because that was all I had and I added one can of tomato sauce and the can of tomato paste.  I didn't simmer for 2 hours because I didn't have the time, but I don't think it matter.   Great recipe!

I added an additional pound of Italian sausage to make it even meatier and eliminated the mint.  It was terrific!

I have tried many sauce recipes to try and win my son over (he's not a fan of spaghetti) - this one finally did it!  I made it as written.  My entire family agreed it was delicious.  Thanks!

Worst spaghetti I've ever had.  The mint made it inedible and way too sweet.  I served it to guests who politely said it was fine, but the kids (what kid doesn't like spaghetti) wouldn't touch it again the entire weekend.
