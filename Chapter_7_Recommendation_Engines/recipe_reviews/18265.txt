I always like to try recipes as written the first time, but it was apparent that this was going to be too watery.  I used chicken stock, left out the water, and thickened the celery, butter and onion mixture with a couple extra tablespoons of flour.  I added two extra potatoes, and used about two and a half cups of whipping cream instead of the half and half.  Seasonings I used were Worcestershire sauce instead of the soy sauce, a little chopped fresh basil, additional Old Bay, and a dash of cayenne pepper. The result was fantastic; thick and creamy, everything a good "Ball-mer" Cream of Crab soup should be!

The recipe calls for far too much water.  Award winning crab soup has a velvety texture.
This soup is running, and had very little texture. The taste is passable, but with other recipes 
not half as running, I wold avoid this one.

Texture is very important in crab soup and this recipe has almost none.  If you decide to make it, the actual cooking time will be 2-3 times longer than the recipe calls for while 
you are trying to reduce all that water.

Then things get overcooked, pot boils over, etc.

This is one to avoid.

Sounds good.  It takes a while to gather all the seafood and other ingredients.

I might try this recipe again but I do believe I will just omit the water and double the broth.

I have been using this recipe for years, and with a few modifications it is one of my favorite!  Instead of the chicken broth+ soup base+ water, I just use a big   box of low sodium chicken broth to make it easier. I also add two cans of chopped clams. Drain one, and use the clam juice from the other. This adds great flavor and more salt.  Red potatoes and red onions make the soup more colorful. Steam  your own crab legs and use the time the potatoes are cooking to de-shell the meat.  It makes for much better flavor and bigger chunks of crab in the soup than if you use canned crab.

Yum, Yum, Yum!  DO NOT skimp on the half and half, I use heavy cream in mine.  This is a great recipe and it leaves you enough leeway to improvise you want to.  It's wonderful just the way it is.

I must have done something wrong because when I added the flour into the sauteed onions, there was no liquid left.  I continued making it, but later, I added a lot of cornstarch and water to thicken up the soup.  It turned into a thick chowder that was really very good.  It took constant stirring while I was adding the thickeners, so that took a lot of time.  Since I don't know what "chicken base" is, I added 3-4 cubes of chicken bouillion.  I figured it was close enough. It really turned out tasty.  It was my very first "seafood" dish and my family and friends gave it a "10"!!

This recipe should really be called crab chowder, not cream of crab soup. I was looking for something more along the lines of crab bisque, which wouldn't have had the parsley and vegetables. Guess it was a poor choice of recipe on my part in that it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. Still, I found it to be tasty, yet a little bit on the thin side. For me, it was just average.

With some 'tweaking", this recipe has potential.  I added cooked bacon and shoepeg corn and left out the water.  For liquids, I used chicken stock and heavy cream.  When serving the chowder, my husband and I put on several dashes of Tabasco sauce since we like things a bit spicy.

I have to agree with Creme on the water.  There was way too much liquid in it at the end.  I poured some of it off.  That being said, its a very good recipe. I personally like my seafood a bit more...fiery? So I added more OLD BAY than the recipe called for. Next time I will try adding cayenne instead.  It is worth making for sure.  Specially for those that dont like alot of heat or spice.

I have been making this soup for several years, tweaking it ever-so slightly each time I make it. This year I made it for our family Christmas dinner and everyone just raved about it. My daughter-in-law even suggested that I make it and sell it. Kudos to this soup and its contributor!

This is an awesome recipe.  To perfect it even more (no offense, Darcy!) I substitute heavy cream for the half-and-half, add more potatoes, add more Old Bay, and top with scallions.

This soup was incredible! I did however omit the onions and celery, add 2c fresh asparagus, 2c fresh string beans, and the corn off of two cobs.  I don't know if it's b/c i added all the veggies or not but my consistency was perfect and creamy.  Also I did add extra crab 1/2 fresh, and half imitation cause thats what i had. I did use all the recommended old bay cause i like salty stuff, but if you don't i wouldn't. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.I make my own stock from shrimp
shells,carrots,onion and peppercorns. Use in place of condensed chicken broth and use whatever stock I have leftover as part of the four cups of water.

As with other reviewers, I left out a lot of the water and added it at the end to achieve the consistency I wanted. Also, I steamed the potatoes so they were tender-crisp and addded them at the same time as the crab meat. More Old Bay does the trick! If not for too much water and too few seasonings, this would be a 5 star recipe.
