This recipe was really great! I usually love sesame oil and would have substituted it except I'm currently pregnant and can't even stand the smell of sesame. So I stuck with the olive oil and this still came out excellent. My Chinese husband also loved it. I mixed all the ingredients (except fish) together to make a sauce and cooked the fillets in tinfoil packets with a little sauce on each one in the oven at 425*F for 12 minutes and it came out perfectly. Very good, will be making this one again!

Yummy, enjoyed this one!  Used one piece of rainbow trout (12-13 ounces) and since I was planning on baking this in the oven, I mixed all of the ingredients together to marinade over the trout (did use brown sugar instead of white and sesame oil instead of olive).  Left for about 4 hours and then baked at 350 for 25 mins.  Lots of flavour, the change to sesame oil is a must as it complements the other ingredients so nicely and I feel the brown sugar does too!

basically okay, but olive oil does not really go well with asian dishes.  try using either sesame oil or peanut oil.

5* with adaptions from other reviews.  I've tried grilling & baking a 1 lb. whole filet, wrapped in foil. The foil method was more moist & flavourful. First time, I followed the recipe except used sesame oil instead of olive oil & found it needed more flavour. Second time, it was amazing with these changes: Put large piece of wide, heavy-duty foil over cookie sheet. Place fish on foil & pat dry with paper towel. Increase soy sauce to 1 tablespoon & rub all over. Season top with salt, fresh cracked black pepper & brown sugar, instead of white. Seal foil loosely so it doesn't touch top of fish & marinade up to 2 hours, in fridge. Use sesame oil instead of olive oil & increase garlic & ginger to 1 + 1/8 teaspoons each. Tip: Freeze ginger to grate as needed. Saute onions & ginger first & add garlic last 3 minutes, to prevent burning. Spoon saute mixture on top of fish, loosely re-seal & bake at 425 for 12 minutes. To test if done, stick fork in top of fish & turn. If it flakes easily, it's done. If it's firm & feels like it needs a knife to cut through it, bake 2 more minutes. Let fish rest 5 minutes before unwrapping & removing skin.  Thanks Kerri for a great recipe!

Substituted olive oil with sesame oil like was suggested by another reviewer.  This really made this dish tasty and very Asian-like.  The blend of the seasonings/ingredients worked well together.  My family loved it and will definitely make again.

Did this with sesame oil because it made much more sense than olive oil for an Asian dish.   My wife is from Asia and LOVED it, as did my 14 year old son. Other than the oil I made no changes- other than I left the skin on .....

Great recipe.  The flavors perfectly balanced the fish but were not overpowering.  I also took the suggestion of using sesame oil over olive oil and it really complimented the other asian flavors well.

This was sooo delicious! My husband loved it and told me I'd better make this again! LOL. The only things I did differently were to cook the fillets in foil packets as another reviewer suggested, and since I didn't have green onions, I sprinkled finely chopped white onion on top the fillets after I spooned the sauce over it, and added a dash of freeze dried chives for color. Then I remembered some cashews I had in the cabinet, and I threw a handful of those on top, wrapped the fish in the packets and baked them for 12 minutes at 425 degrees.

The flavor was fantastic!!  I used Sesame oil instead of Olive and I did double all the ingredients, using 4 trout. I also baked this in the oven at 425 for 25 min. (following others suggestions) Combined the soy sauce and seasoning in a bowl and pouring over the fish.  I should mention the kind of pepper I used, as I feel like put this dish over the top...McCormick's Peppercorn Medley Grinder.  Served with white rice and AR's Stir Fried Snow Peas and Mushrooms recipe. Thank you so much for this recipe!  I will be making this again.

Yum.  Like most others, I substituted olive oil for sesame oil.  The side dish I served this with had scallions so I didn't bother adding scallions to this dish.  Really light and flavorful.  This will definitely go into my list for quick trout recipes.

This was delicious!  I made this with lake trout.  I followed a few suggestions: I increased the soy sauce to 1 tbsp, substituted brown sugar for the white sugar, and used sesame oil instead of olive oil.  I also left out the salt altogether -- I figured the soy sauce would be salty enough.  I mixed the soy sauce, sugar and pepper and rubbed the mixture on both sides of the trout.  There was some marinade left over, so I drizzled it on the trout before flipping them over.  Yum!

Sauce was tasty and I would make this again. Beware of buying trout with bones, makes it hard to eat.

Quite tasty.  I used toasted sesame oil in place of olive oil and brown sugar instead of white as many reviewers have done.  I sauteed the trout until it had a nice caramelized crust, and it was perfectly cooked inside.  We enjoyed very much.

Let me start by saying, my husband gave this at least a 6!
Today was 'opening fishing' day, so my husb. & sons along w/ 3 next door neighbors went bright and early. I was ready w/ fry pan in hand. Normally I make Trout Amandine, so they were a bit skeptical. I mixed olive oil & some sesame. My husband won't stop gushing, and the other guys loved it too!
Thanks :)

I make this recipe with or without the sugar.  It's delicious, the best way I have found of preparing trout.  Also works with salmon and chicken.  The only other change I make besides omitting the sugar sometimes is using bacon grease instead of oil.   This is just really good.

Way too salty!  Salting the fish and adding (even reduced sodium) soy sauce made this almost inedible.

This was very good with some changes suggested by other reviewers. I used peanut oil instead of olive. I also wrapped it in tinfoil and baked it for 12 minutes at 425. Next time I will probably double the marinade to give it more flavor. This was the first time we ever had trout and we loved this!

Excellent! We had this last night and my husband said it's the best rainbow trout he's ever had. I prefer salmon so I used this sauce on the salmon too - perfect! As with other reviews, I put the fish in foil packets, mixed all the sauce together and poured it over. Baked in the oven at 350 for 25 minutes and it was done just right.

Great recipe.  My kids (4 & 8) loved it.  I've never cooked trout before, so I was just a bit apprehensive about it.  This recipe was super easy, but I did change to sesame oil instead of olive (it just made more sense).  Will definitely make again.

The store didn't have trout so I got sole instead.  I used brown sugar and a dash red pepper in the soy sauce mixture.  I also bumped up the soy sauce amount to a whole tablespoon instead of 2 teaspoons, what's one more teaspoon? Sole is a very delicate fish and cooked in this recipe, it just melted in our months.  We will definitely make this again.

This is really good.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and substituted sesame oil and brown sugar for the olive oil and white sugar.  I also baked the 1 lb. whole trout in foil in the oven at 350 degrees for 25 mins.  It was perfect.  I plan to make this often.

This was a very big hit in our house.  I made it with organic kale salad, red and yellow peppers with organic yogurt ranch dressing.  Two thumbs up.

This is a simple recipe with great flavours.  I made it tonight and it is a refreshing alternative to cooking trout. 
I also used sesame oil to add a shine to the fish, and added Vietnamese mint (Thai Basil) to finish. YUM!

Loved this! I love trout to begin with but I thought this whole mixture was great. Even had a great smell while cooking. I did use the advice of the others and used the sesame oil. Good job!!!

We made tonight using sesame oil instead of olive & it was great.  Our young children were asking for more, I will have to buy more next time.

Smelled good while cooking, but surprise!  We don't seem to like trout.  But it wasn't the fault of the recipe, because it looked attractive and smelled pretty good.  Rainbow trout just has way too strong of a fish flavor for my family.  If you like it though, I'll bet that this recipe is a good one.  Maybe I can try it with another type of fish?

Excellent recipe. My husband and kids love it, and it couldn't be any easier. Only change I made was to cook the fish in foil, for 20 minutes. Clean-up is a breeze!

This recipe is very good, however, I did make some changes.  First I rubbed the fillets with Sesame Oil and placed it on a sheet of foil.  I then mixed soy sauce, a little more sesame oil, minced garlic, some brown sugar, and sesame seeds and mixed poured over fish.  Let sit a few minutes and baked 20 min.

I love this light delicious trout.  I didn't have any green onions and substituted yellow.   My kids would not eat it and that is why it only got 4 stars.  I grew up eating the cornmeal deep fried version.  I loved that as a child because it was the only time my mother would make macaroni and cheese.  I think this is way better than my mother's.  I served it with rice and broccoli and I will make it again if my kids have already eaten.

I took the tips of others and used brown sugar and sesame oil.  The weather was great so we grilled the trout outside.  What a success! The flavors are well balanced. My only suggestion would be to make 1 1/2 times the recipe.    Served with Fresh Peach Salsa from this site, using mango instead of peaches and adding some fresh pineapple and a few strawberries.   Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!  Like other reviewers mentioned, I used sesame oil instead of olive oil and replaced the white sugar with brown sugar.  I would definitely make this again.  For anyone who isn't a fan of ginger, consider halving the amount used.

This was delicious! Kids and hubby loved it too...and I have one really picky eater.  That says a lot.  I did substitute the olive oil for sesame like others recommended. I also used a sweetener to replace the sugar to keep it Keto friendly.

I substituted the olive oil with sesame oil.  Other than that, I didn’t change a thing.  My husband and I both loved it!  

I served it over rice with a side of gingered bok choy sautéd with carrots, onions, and celery.  Superb meal!  This one is definite keeper!

Wonderful!  I couldn't get trout, so used grouper.  Used low sodium soy.  Did not use salt either.  Used brown sugar.
Sauteed in sesame oil.  Used more ginger and garlic, and added some red pepper flakes.  Will definitely be making this again soon!

I combined all the ingredients  and spread it on the fish. I put it in the oven at 350°C fo 20 min (2 really large filets). Delicious! Kids asked for seconds!
Will try sesame oil and brown sugar next time for a different flavour.

Oh my, this blew me away! My first time cooking rainbow trout was a stunning success. I placed the fish in a 9X13 glass baking dish with a small amount of soy sauce on the bottom, hoping that would help flavor the fish through the skin. It also made it easier to rub the soy sauce on top. I omitted the salt and used paprika in place of pepper as that is my preference.  By leaving the onion and spice mix in the pan, it sticks to the trout, giving it wonderful flavor. I found the three minutes per side to be the perfect amount of time. Many thanks to KerriJ for sharing.

This was so good! I used all ingredients as listed except I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. Didn't take exact measurements, but I'm pretty sure I used more garlic and ginger than was called for. I also cooked the trout in the oven in foil packets, 350 for 25 minutes. Very flavorful and cooked perfectly. Will be making again!

I put all the ingredients (including sesame oil and brown sugar as suggested by others; also, fish with skin on one side) on top of the fish on a sheet of aluminum foil and put the whole thing on the grill.  I just have had bad experiences pan-frying fish.  It cooked on high heat for just a few minutes, ten flaked nicely.  Delicious!

Made this recipe last night, exactly as written EXCEPT I substituted Splenda for sugar. My wife and I put this one in the "make for dinner guests" category. Simply delicious!  Next time I might experiment by kicking up the Asian factor...maybe cook in peanut or sesame oil instead of olive oil.

Peanut oil is definitely better in this dish than olive oil, as well as brown sugar instead of white sugar. With these changes, the recipe would be four stars but as is it is just okay. Living on a lake has taught me many ways to serve fish and this recipe is neither the best nor the worst way I've prepared/eaten trout. It's nice for a change of pace.

This recipe gets 5 stars because it is the recipe that got me to ENJOY trout, and not just choke it down.  The kids liked it, the husband raved, and I basked in the glow!  If you think you hate trout, give this recipe a try! I prepared as is this time, with no modifications.  YUM!

Fabulous recipe!  My husband said it's the best fish he's ever eaten.  I used brown sugar and sesame oil.  I definitely recommend the skillet method (rather than baking) because the sauce caramelizes a bit and the outside gets nice and crispy.

My entire family loved this recipe!  The flavors blend together beautifully - we added a little extra garlic and ginger, but that was just our preference - and it wasn't the least bit fishy.  This is a great way to fix fresh rainbow trout.

I followed another review on here and substituted sesame oil. It's very fragrant and add's a lot to this dish. Following the same review I baked this wrapped in foil. This recipe also works very nicely on tilapia. Serve this with white rice. Yum. Just like the asian restaurants I order fish at.

Really good.  I used splenda instead of sugar, and baked it in a stone, so the juice got a little runny, but it was very tasty.

This was tasty, although I wasn't especially thrilled with it. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and replaced the white sugar with turbinado and used sesame oil instead of olive oil. I think the fish would be better if it was allowed to marinade over night and that the overall flavor might be improved with the addition of roasted garlic.

My wife and I loved this fast and easy recipe.  I substituted salmon instead of trout and it tasted amazing.  I also used a teaspoon of Tastefully Simple's Garlic Garlic instead of the minced garlic & I subbed sesame oil for the vegetable oil. Thank you for posting this recipe. We will be making it often. I think I will throw these on the grill when it warms up a bit.

I also used sesame instead of olive oil.  Next time I'll fry extra onion/garlic/ginger, as it goes great on rice.

O Canada! Great recipe Kerry, and one that I'll use again and again. It was fast to make and yummy. I substituted brown for white sugar and used the sesame oil (super suggestion). I also took the advice of Mrs Li and put the mixed ingredients over the fish, and baked in aluminum foil packets (I made 4) - at 425 degrees for 16 minutes (my fish might have been thicker). Thanks for sharing.

Because of what I had on hand I used three small, fresh-out-the-stream whole Idaho rainbow trout, veggie oil and dry ground ginger (boo-hiss, I know). I think I burned it a little, but this was still fantastic served with steamed rice and steamed veggies. My skeptical non-fish eating husband loved it. I shall try fresh ginger and seseme oil (and a lower heat!) next time. With all the fishing to be done where I live this may become a staple in our home. Thank you for sharing this recipe; it was lovely! :)
