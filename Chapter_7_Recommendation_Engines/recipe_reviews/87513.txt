I thought this was great! I fried my falafel in my Presto Cool Daddy for a minute, I made little ones. I used what I had on hand: green bell pepper, baby carrots, roma tomatoes, celery, and yellow onion. I used probably less than half of the ranch with the garlic pwdr, onion pwdr, and cumin. Tossed it with the veggies, put the falafel on top. Served that over the only lettuce I had left, iceberg. I used maybe a 1/4 of the head. Yummy!!

I love falafel, and this is a great way to serve it. I used red onion andd English cucumbers as that's what I prefer. I was a bit skeptical about the dressing but it turned out great (I added way more garlic). Thanks!

I love Falafel but this didn't do it for me. I think it was a texture thing. She soft Falafel and the crunchy veggies didn't go well together
