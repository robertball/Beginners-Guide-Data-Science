Very good sauce.   I followed the ingredient list exactly except did not specifically use Kikkoman branded products.   Some were, some weren't.   As far as the recipe goes, I did not marinade, bake or grill as directed.   Instead I dumped everything in a slow cooker and let it go.   This resulted in a very nice Teriyaki rib.   The sauce had largely become liquid with the melted fat from the ribs.   It was not gooey like you would expect from a rib sauce, but that was just fine, the flavor was there.   The meat almost looked as if there was no sauce on it at all.   I would like to try this on ribs again using a more traditional procedure to give me that gooey goodness that goes with ribs.   I've had a request to use this sauce again on chicken breasts.   I think the possibilities are endless.   I served with lo mein and fried broccoli.  I slow cooked on high for about 3 or 3 1/2 hours and low for another hour.   When the meat starts working up the bone, they are ready.

This was an awesome recipe! I didn't have the oyster sauce ,  and baked the ribs for 2 hours, then caramelized them on the grill. Everything  went perfectly! You use a lot of tin foil! I will definitely make again!

The sauce was amazing!  I didn't have oyster sauce on hand so I added additional hoisin sauce and teriyaki marinade and sauce.  I have kids, so I didn't add the sriracha sauce.  The flavor was delicious!  My husband now wants to use this sauce for his short ribs recipe.  Next time I think I will try this sauce using pork spareribs.
