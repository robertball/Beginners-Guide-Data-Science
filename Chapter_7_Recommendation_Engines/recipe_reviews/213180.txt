This was fun and unusual for sure. The carrots soaked in dill juice were good by themselves but I thought they were out of place with the rest of the dish. I'm a huge dill pickle and olive lover but even this was a bit much overall dill flavor for me. I honestly think this would be better if chicken breast were used instead and slightly blackened on the grill, sliced, and put in the dish in the end instead of browning them just to soggy them up with the liquid but that is just my two cents. Again, this was fun and  it wasn't  horrible but just something I probably wouldn't make again.

My family renamed this "Weird Chicken".  It was bland, strange combination of flavors, and I won't make it again.

I LOVE this recipe! It's a strange combination of ingredients but it tastes so good. I use bread and butter pickles and frozen sliced carrots. I've even made it without the potatoes and served it with rice. So yummy !

I am giving a 5 star because I love chicken thighs, and dill pickles and olives and the carrots to go with it. I will be making this and have all the ingredients for the recipe.
