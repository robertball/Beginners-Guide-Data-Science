I thought this recipe was great.  I cut it way down since there are only 2 of us.  Aside from that I followed the recipe exactly (minus serving it on spinach leaves, Im not that fancy) and it was great.  Definitely eat it right away though, its not as good for leftovers.

My husband and I thought this recipe was just OK.  Much too lemony. Will not make again.
