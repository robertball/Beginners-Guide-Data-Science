This is excellent! The only reason I am giving this a 4 star instead of a 5 is the salt. I like salty but this is WAY too salty as written. I will cut it in half next time and there will be a next time because this is just excellent.The hardest part about this recipe is cutting up the cabbage. I plan on experimenting and trying different flavors such as Sriracha. Who knew kraut could be this easy and without all of the preservatives you get in a can? SOLD!

Okay, so thank you to the others that posted reviews.  I made this with half the salt, and used apple cider vinegar.  I also added just a little onion powder.  It came out beautifully!!

Like so many others, I love it,  it find the salt way too high. I cut in half (2T) and still am making it again today with only 1T. I also added 5 juniper berries and 1T caraway seeds.

Should have read the other reviews first way to salty. 1/2 to 1/3 the salt nextime. I traded white for cider vinegar and added dill and caraway.  Everything except the salt is amazing.

Reduced the salt to 1/8th cup. Great on sandwiches! Good to eat right out of the pot. Tastes like saurkraut!

I cut the salt, per other commenters recommendations, to just 2 tbsp. but it came out a salty, mushy, smelly mess. Granted I am an IP Newbie and I've never used the "meat" button before (I'm vegetarian) but  this is my first IPFail. I'm very disappointed.

So salty it was inedible and not salvageable. No one on group pages could help me. Very disappointed.

Followed others and used 1/8 cup of kosher salt. Really really good. Just keep in mind that this is cooked not fresh fermented in a barrel. Saved some in a jar in the fridge. How long can it be safely kept I wonder.

This was so quick and easy, I couldn't believe how great it tasted!  This will be added to my "go-to" recipes.
