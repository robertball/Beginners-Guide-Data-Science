Reminded me of ham and beans (same flavor). I just wanted to remind anyone before adding the beans to the slow cooker that they should either be soaked overnight or as the instuction manual to the crock pot says " beans should be softened completely before combining with sugar or acid food. It may have a hardening effect on them and will prevent softening. Or you can boil beans for 10 min. reduce heat, cover, and allow to simmer 1 1/2 hrs. or until beans are tender." I did this and they turned out being a good consistency when they came out of the crock .

This is the best bean recipe I have ever tried!  I think the trick is to soak the beans overnight first.  I used four pieces of already cooked bacon, which added a great smokey flavor to the beans.  I left the crock pot on LOW for 10 hours, while I was at work, and when I got home, they were perfect!  I mashed them up, added a little salt, some shredded cheese, and watched everyone gobble them up!!!

Wonderful flavor and texture, Brandi! The reviewer who had hard beans after ten hours, probably forgot to soak overnight. Mine were done in 8.5 hours in the crockpot on low, after soaking all night long.Whirred them around in my food processor and Voila! Better than store bought and more flavorful than restaurant.Thanks Brandi!

Thanks for the great recipe, Brandi! For those who said the beans never softened...if the dried beans are old, they WILL NOT soften. I had 2 bags of beans that had been forgotten in the pantry for a long time. I tried cooking them in a crock pot after soaking overnight, but they never softened. After 18 hours in the crock pot, I gave up and threw them out. I usually use salt pork instead of bacon when cooking my beans. I freeze bacon drippings in 1 tablespoon batches all the time and if I don't have salt pork or bacon, I use the frozen bacon drippings for seasoning. I also add Cumin when cooking my beans. I have read that you should wait until the last minute to add salt, because if you add salt early in the cooking process, the skins of the beans can be tough.  :-)

this recipe is simply wonderful! some of the reviewers mentioned they preferred more spice so i took the hint, added extra garlic & doubled the onion. i also only drained off 1/2 the liquid, did a partial mash & topped the beans with a small amount of grated cheddar cheese. you'll discover this recipe comes out very similar to refried beans. the next time i'm planning to find out how good these beans will be if served whole. thank you brandi!

This was the first time I have ever tried to make refried beans.  I made them for my annual cinco de mayo party.  I soaked the beans for 8hrs and then put them in the crock pot for 6hrs.  The beans were very easy to make however I wasn't crazy about the taste.  They could have used a litle more spice.  Maybe next time I will add some more onion and some chiles.  Overall not bad, just a little bland for my tastes.

I forgot to buy dry beans at the store, so I experimented with canned pinto beans.  I used two cans of beans, added the rest of the ingredients and simmered on my stove top for about an hour.  I mashed as normal, and the flavor was great.  I also forgot to add the sugar.  I will try with the dry beans, but for a quick version it was good.

I found these to be pretty bland.  If I made them again, I'd add lots more seasonings to them.

Mine came out great! These were exactly what I wanted- refried beans. I had a whole bag of light red kidney beans so I had to scale and fudge this a bit. I’m not much for fooling with dried beans but someone gave them to me and I needed to use them up. I used 2 crock-pots. I soaked the beans overnight. I went by the recipe except I also added about a tsp. of Adobo Seasoning to each crock for a little Mexican flavor. I highly recommend this if you have some around. I also used about half the bacon that the recipe called for because it was less fat and I hate to use expensive bacon just for seasoning. I didn’t drain any water. When my crocks of beans were getting mushy and the water was soupy and thick I transferred all the beans to a big microwave casserole. At this stage I didn’t need to discard my bacon. It had virtually dissolved in the beans. I mashed the rest of the solid beans up, and nuked them on medium 20 mins. stirred and nuked again on medium another 15 mins. This dried the soupiness out and made them that pasty consistency of refried beans that I was wanting without burning them in the crocks.

I believe this recipe should be edited to reflect what all the other reviewers have said and what I will repeat. Do not expect these to be ready in 6 hours if you put dry beans directly into the slow cooker without presoaking. I did the quick soak method by bringing them to a boil (uncovered) then remove from heat and let them sit, covered, for an hour. Then I went on with the recipe. Even with that, they were not ready in 6 hours. They really need to go overnight. Just start them the day before you need them, let them cook all day, then turn the slow cooker down to low and let them go overnight. They will be perfect in the morning. I did not fish the bacon out as it pretty much just melted into the bean mixture. I used my immersion blender to puree them which worked great, leaving some of the beans whole for a nice texture. Be sure to add salt or they will be tasteless. Add in a couple teaspoons while they cook and then taste and add more if needed after. Also, I scaled up to use an entire bag of beans as I didn't want to use just 1-1/2 cups.

They were ok.  I soaked the beans for 14 hours and cooked on high for 8.  Didn't touch them.  They were really pastey and i don't think that they were cooked long enough.  I will stick to my recipe.

These were "Super", but could use alittle more spicing up! Needs lots of salt & more garlic. I also mashed them & put them in a cassarole & pu cheese on the top & baked in a warm oven untill the cheese melted.

This is a great use for all of my dried pinto beans.  I now see why pintos are used for refried beans -- after soaking overnight and cooking all day on low, they mashed quite beautifully.  The second time making this, I wanted to make it totally fat free.  I omitted the bacon.  After mashing, I added 1/8 teaspoon Liquid Smoke (could have done more), a small can of green chilies and 1 teaspoon of salt.

As other reviewers have noted, these beans do need to be soaked overnight or do the quick soak method if you don't have the overnight time.  My one substitution is I use cured salt pork . I cut it up uncooked into chunks and cook it in the beans.  Wonderful flavor without tasting like bacon and beans.  I also find that even with a good overnight soak, I typically let these beans cook for about 8 hours.  I have an older crockpot though, so that may be a contributing factor.  My family loves these beans and I am frequently asked for the recipe if I bring them to a potluck or serve them at a barbecue!

These beans are perfect. I have made them several times and no longer buy canned refried beans. Instead of bacon I season mine with cumin and a little chili powder and cayenne, sometimes adding a dash of canola oil. I have read that adding sugar while cooking dry beans will cause the skins to stay tough so I recommend waiting until the beans are soft to add any sweetener, if using.

I have been looking for a good recipe for "refried beans" for a long time and have finally found one that is great.  The only thing that I change was I added some cumin to give it a little more flavor.  I will certainly make them again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Not as tasty as I would have liked and although I soaked and cooked them all day, they were still not soft enough for refried beans.

This is my first unfavorable review! I came home to a pile of burnt on the outside, uncooked on the inside beans.  This recipe needs more water if it will be on high for 6 hours.

Great recipe and easy to make. I think it could use just a bit of chili or burrito seasoning, but other than that, excellent. Everyone in the family liked this recipe much better than canned beans.

I used this as my first crock pot refried bean recipe, I had been using bacon drippings in my pan fried and this seemed a better way.  I used a little more water for this than regular beans as I like my refrieds creamy, I added the garlic and onion after I mashed the beans and then continued cooking for another hour and I pan fried the bacon and added the drippings with the onion and garlic.  I used the fried bacon for other recipes.

I've never been able to perfect refried beans until this recipe came along. If nothing else, I found the slow-cooker to be revolutionary in the way that I attempt to prepare refried beans. I believe my  main difficulties with this meal come from living at 7200 feet, so if you're a high altitude cook, the slow cooker just might be your answer for tender beans!

BLAND and really not worth all the time. I ended up refrying them after they cooked and adding some seasonings to pick it up a bit.

These beans smelled great while they were cooking and they cooked just fine, but they were way too bland.  We added sour cream, taco seasoning, and pepper but it was still pasty and bland.  We won't be making this again.

This was delicious! I tripled the recipe and cooked the beans on low for over 10 hours (started in the morning before I went to work). Please, note that I filled up the crock pot 3/4's full of water. I couldn't bring myself to smash them after I tasted the beans. I cooked a pound a hamburger mixed with picante salsa and used it for half the beans for a meal one night. The other beans I did mash and used it for burro's the next day. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was so good.  I used my food processor instead of the potatoe masher.  Next time I will add mor of the liquid to them.  When they where frist processed they were great but after the sat for a while they got real dry.  They have a great flavor to them.  Also I didn't take out the bacon.  I processed it with the beans.

My husband exclaimed "Wow, you finally did it!"  I said "Nope, allrecipes did."
I rinsed beans well the night before and soaked them overnight.  I cooked them in the same water I soaked in.  Other than that - I followed the recipe exactly.

This is an excellent recipe.  I made this for a potluck at work and people raved about them.  I will make these many times!  I cooked them on low in crock pot for the time in the recipe, and they were done just fine.

These turned out perfect in an Instant Pot. used chicken broth instead of water. Mashed to a chunky texture.

What is the point in posting a recipe that doesnt give you all the steps to make it correctly. This recipe didnt say, soak beans or cook first, it said put dry beans in the  pot......I have already doubled the amount of liquid in the slowcooker and they havent even cooked for 4 hours yet, it will be interesting to see if my beans will be tender....so far my doctoring on the recipe........

I used chicken stock rather than water, fresh garlic cooked a little first to release the oils and flavors, and about a 1/2 teaspoon of ancho chili powder and 2 tablespoons of bacon fat. If the beans are tender to taste, I will then adjust flavors accordingly and revise my review after that. 

All recipes.com you should ensure that a recipe works before you post it live on your website. This is my first venture into using dry beans.............it may be my last............

The beans came out very dry and tasteless.  I can see where this could be a good recipe but it would require some extra "spicing" besides bacon.  Definitely, you should soak the beans overnight and then cook them on low, not high.  Timing would be everything so shorter cooking is better.  Adding more fluid might help but they just didn't have the smooth texture they should when made exactly as directed.

We liked this recipe.  The only thing I did different was to add more onion and some green chili peppers.  Thanks Brandi!

I am just learning to cook and was nervous about making homemade beans, but they were great. I did not drain the water- just mashed it up and it was perfect.
