After reading everyone's reviews, I made the following changes:  1.  doubled the tomatoes to 28 oz    2.  added 2 diced roma tomatoes  3.  increased the cheese from 1/2 cup to 2.5 cups.  I also mixed the cheese in instead of just leaving it on top.

It turned out really well!  Not dry at all and with lots of flavor--and there definitely wasn't too much cheese, even though I increased the amount so much.

I did have trouble getting it to fit into a 13x9 casserole dish. There was too much food!

This has become a family favourite after some small changes.  On my first attempt, I found I loved the flavour of the sauce alone, but when mixed into the pasta it was too dry.  Since then, I've doubled the sauce (the peppers, tomatoes & spices, but NOT the beans) and used less pasta (3 cups dry).  I also have a slightly heavier hand with the cheese on top.  Delicious!

Easy to make and is open to substitutions, I added zucchini and substituted garbanzo for pinto beans and it turned out great.  It was a little dry, I would recommend adding some liquid.

I substituted pinto beans for the garbanzo beans but was still disappointed.  First, it was way too dry -- too much pasta, not enough of the "other stuff".  Second, I didn't know this, but I'm not a fan of coriander.  I didn't even finish my bowlful.  I would have to change it a lot to make it again.

I only used about 12 ounces of gemelli pasta because I didn't want it to be too bland. It wasn't spicy at all with the jalapeno, I wouldn't leave it out! I mixed in a few ounces of cream cheese and mixed in the mozzarella too before I baked it.

I made this for my family.  We are meat lovin' people, but this seems like a good alternative and we still get our protien. I also added zuccini that I had in the fridge.  Good!

We LOVED this recipe and did make some adjustments that others suggested like less pasta, twice as much tomatoes, no coriander, and a little more cheese.  If I hadn't told him, my husband would not have even paid attention to the fact that this was a vegetarian meal...that how wonderful it was!

I thought that this was a nice dish, but nothing too exciting for me. I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to make this again.

I decided on this recipe because I have more canned beans than I know what do do with, and I had most of the ingredients. I did not have garbanzo beans, so I used pinto; I didn’t have the peppers, so figured I’d try carrots. The beans were great, but the carrots kinda tweaked the flavor a bit, so I’ll not be using those again! I also only baked it for 20 minutes, so as not to dry it out (and everything was already cooked). Overall, it tasted great and was a life saver when I realized my original dinner plans fell through. My kids all enjoyed it, so I’d say it’s a keeper!

I omitted the jalapeno due to wimpy kids, and did an extra can of tomatoes and about  10oz of cheese.  It was good but most importantly it was quick and easy and got a kids thumbs up!

Loved this recipe!  I used Veggie pasta, omitted the cheese and only baked 20 minutes since there was no cheese to melt but still wanted the flavors to blend.  I'm trying to eat more Vegan-ish but could add meat/cheese for my husband-- although he said he liked it without :)

Very blah!! I am all for vegetarian, and it looked good on paper. But was very dry, maybe some extra tomato sauce or cheese mixed in.
