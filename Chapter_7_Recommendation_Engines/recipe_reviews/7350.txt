I substituted 1/2 T half & half for the milk, and used about 2/3C of Nutella instead of the fudge for the most amazing chocolate hazelnut buttercream EVER. Really. It's not overly sweet, just perfect. Great texture, too.

Excellent Frosting, very creamy.  However...I omitted the fudge toppping (I did not have any on hand).  It turned out very well.

I really was a little skeptical about trying this using the hot fudge topping as an ingredient-but I am glad I did.  What a great frosting.  I used heavy cream instead of milk and I used Dove-dark chocolate topping and it was so yummy.  I put it on the "fabulous fudge chocolate cake" recipe from this site and WOW what a chocolate fix for a chocolate lover!  I agree with another reviewer that it doesn't set up well on a hot day with high humidity-so I stuck the whole cake in the fridge after I iced it and it set up well.  I took it out 20 minutes before I served it and it was great..Try and make a day or two in advance because chocolate anything tastes better a few days later when the great chocolate flavors come out!

Beautiful frosting, creamy smooth and fudgey, but I would caution that it's evident this will only be as good as the fudge topping you use.  This is not a deep, rich chocolate which I liked, especially for the banana cake I chose to use it on.  But it's easy enough, however, to increase the cocoa powder and decrease the powdered sugar by the same amount if you wanted a deeper, darker frosting.  The texture is especially excellent.

I have been searching for a chocolate frosting recipe for over 4 years now.  Every recipe I have tried ends up tasting like the store bought kind.  I hate the store bought kind.  This recipe is wonderful!  I used it on my son's birthday cake and everyone loved it (me too for once).  I can't wait to try it on my deep dish brownies.  I used butter shortening instead of regular, cream instead of milk, and double the vanilla - voila!  The perfect chocolate frosting recipe...

You absolutely must make this frosting!  It is one of the most scrumptious chocolate frostings I've ever tasted in my life, and I've never been a big fan of buttercream frosting.  I frosted a yellow cake with it, and everyone devoured it.  Fudgy, rich, and delicious.

Prepared a B-Day cake for Dad using the Hershey Chocolate Cake Recipe and this frosting. The result was excellent. The frosting had good color, was easy to make and spread easily. Guests returned for seconds and thus I had no leftovers. I made a sheet cake and there was enough frosting. If I had made a layered cake I would have doubled the recipe.

I loved this recipe.  The only changes I made was I used 2 and a 1/2 cup of confectioner sugar instead of just 2 cups and used 2 tablespoons of heavy cream instead of milk.  For the hot fudge topping, I used Mrs Richardson's Chocolate Lover's Fudge straight out of the jar, not heated.  I also added a pinch of salt.  The frosting was perfect, not runny or thick but just right for spreading.  It turned out beautifully and tasted fantastic.  It is very rich which was fine with me because I love dark chocolate.

A very excellent chocolate buttercream frosting!  I use Hershey's Hot Fudge Topping.  You must use the thick fudge topping, not the chocolate syrup, in order to achieve the great frosting this recipe produces.  This is now my favorite chocolate frosting!

I am a caterer, I used this on a chocolate pound cake to create a birthday cake for a chocoholic person.  It was great.  Used leftover on a light yellow cake, sold out of it.

We used Hershey's hot fudge topping (and I usually prefer Smuckers) and the taste of the hot fudge was very noticeable.  Needless to say, I didn't care for this recipe because of that.  However, I think I might try this again with Smuckers.  Also, I put in 3 tbs. of milk, and it was way too runny.  So be careful with the amount of milk you put in!  THe frosting was very creamy and smooth though.  And it didn't dry up all hard like the Hershey's recipe for chocolate frosting.

Scrumptious when made with my own home made hot fudge sauce and when shortening is replaced with an equal measure of butter (so 3/4 cup butter in all.) The type of hot fudge sauce you use will drastically affect the final flavor, so be certain of the quality of your selection, or make your own. The frosting goes on smooth as glass. Very easy to work with, and pipes well, but be sure to go easy on the milk. I added only half of the amount called for, and the texture was perfect. I would not describe it as "fudge," however, which was surprising with the inclusion of hot fudge sauce. Be aware that it's actually a medium chocolate, rather than a deep fudge in either texture or color, which accounts for the 4 stars. The recipe makes a generous amount, sufficient to fill and frost a 2 layer cake thickly.

This is the second time I have made this recipe. The frist time I made the recipe as it's written, but then it was too runny to pipe onto my cupcakes. I tried adding more sugar, but then it was way too sweet. This second time my friend wanted it for her baby shower cake and I knew that I would need it at piping consistency, so I omitted the milk. That worked great! The fudge and vanilla are plenty of liquid for it. The cake turned out great and everyone loves the frosting. You didn't see any frosting scraped off onto the plate at this party!

I have to admit it...I've utilized this site for years...picking up great recipes and helpful tips without ever reviewing a recipe! This ends today! As the baker in the family I was assigned dessert duty for the Christmas meal. I'm usually more of a cookie and brownie girl but decided to give homemade cupcakes with buttercream frosting a shot since it's my mom's favorite. This was my first time making frosting from scratch, and this recipe sounded divine. BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ PEOPLE!!! It is AMAZING! OMG! This is the BEST frosting I have ever tasted!! And so easy to make! I did like many others and substituted half and half for the milk and doubled the vanilla...other than that followed it to a T. I'm baking the cupcakes tomorrow to frost, one batch of chocolate and one batch of peanut butter (yum!) both found on this site. I'm just hoping I don't eat all of the frosting before I commence to baking! LOL! Long story short...if you are looking for a delectably chocolate and rich buttercream frosting...look no further, you've found it! :)

Merry Christmas everybody!

Really delicious!  Was looking for a homemade chocolate recipe for a filling.  It is perfect.  One batch filled a 10" and a 9" with a teeny bit leftover (for me!). Can this be frozen?  I made a double batch but the one was enough.  I can't bear to throw this away...too good!

This recipe is superb! I followed the directions as written. Frosting was creamy and delicious. Very easy to spread on the "Rainbow Clown Cake" which i got from this site too. Thank you so much for the recipe Debra. I will never buy store bought frosting again.

I HATE FROSTING!!! Since childhood, I'd peel it off every cake and cupcake that came my way. Too sweet, too greasy...ugh. However, needing to top some yellow cake cupcakes for a bake sale, I knew my likes had to be pushed aside and I had to find a Chocolate Frosting Recipe I could tolerate. I followed ARTBABE'S recommendations of using Nuetella; ended up putting in MORE than 1/4 cup of milk to make it pliable and ended up with the most STELLAR of frostings possible!!!! Bravo to the poster of this recipe, and to ARTBABE for recommending the Nuetella! The cupcakes flew off the table and three women actually asked ME for the recipe! Had enough frosting for 12 Jumbo cupcakes with 1.5 cups remaining, which I froze and plan to use up on brownies. Thank you for changing this 60 year old's impression of frosting; this is a keeper for sure!

This is absolutely heavenly!  I didn't have hot topping, so I melted a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips I had.  Mixed it right in.  I also used 1/4 cup of milk instead of 2 Tbs.  Perfect!

This is wonderful! I usually do not make nor like frostings that have powdered sugar in it, it carries a taste that makes it taste "cheap" to me. But after reading the reviews, I decided to try it. It is WODERFUL! Does not have that Powdered sugar taste it was smooth silky and carried a great chocolate tast, this will me our forsting I use now! Thank you for posting this! By the way I DID NOT change anything about it, made it the way it is to be made and it doesnt need changed around!

The taste of this is VERY good but I made some adjustments to the measurements. I used all butter because I don't really care for frosting with shortening (and in this case you're not needing to produce a white frosting anyway, so why not use all butter for a better taste?) I used less than 1 cup of the fudge topping (used my 1 cup measuring cup just didn't fill it all the way, so not sure how much I added; around 2/3 to 3/4 cup). The frosting was pretty thin so I added no milk at all, and then added almost another cup of sugar. This made it quite sweet, so I'm glad I didn't use all the fudge. It may have been okay without the extra sugar if just smearing on a cake, but was way too thin for piping. But I'm pleased with the final taste!

Tastes great but not for cupcakes as they run off the sides of the cake and you can't pile it up. Good for a cake that's going to stay in the pan it was baked in.

This frosting is excellent! Followed the recipe with the exception of using heavy cream in place of milk and this turned out perfect! I used Smucker's Hot Fudge Ice Cream Topping and the taste is delicious. The consistancy/texture was exactly what I was looking for. I used this on the "Dark Chocolate Bacon Cupcakes" from this site with wonderful results. I would happily use this recipe anytime I need a chocolate frosting. Thanks for sharing!

This is fabulous!  Creamy, smooth and very tasty.  Not too sweet, not too bitter.  Excellent!  I used this on the Best Foods Mayonnaise chocolate cake recipe. Good stuff! I will use this recipe from now on. FYI- I used Smuckers hot fudge, half-n-half instead of milk, margarine instead of butter, and butter flavored shortening.

Fabulous tasting, great texture and easy to make.  I made a couple alterations after reading previous reviews - used all butter (no shortening) and heavy cream instead of the milk.  The frosting looked identical to the picture!

This WAS the best fudge frosting BEFORE I added the hot fudge topping.  After I added it, the frosting tasted exactly like it came out of a can! My entire family was very disappointed.

This is an excellent recipe!!  I only made 2 changes because of what I had on hand.  I used butter flavor shortening and I didn't have hot fudge so I melted 3/4 cups semi-sweet chocolate and 1/4 cup butterscotch chips in a double boiler.  I let the chocolate cool and then I added it to the mixture with the vanilla extract.  I also let it stand in the fridge for 30 minutes before frosting my cupcakes.  It was so delicious I broke my never lick the beaters rule.  Enjoy!

This is by far my favorite chocolate frosting recipe.  I did use heavy cream instead of milk because I prefer the texture.  The flavor was rich and the texture was creamy.  This will be my go to from now on. I used this on a cake order and they are also fans!

I made this frosting today and it was a disaster.  I used a fudge sauce from this site. The frosting was too dry.  It was falling off the cake.  I added several ounces whipping cream to the tripled recipe to make it wet and spreadable. Now it's so wet that it won't harden on the outside.  I've never had frosting behave this badly.  Update:  it tasted really good so i added a star.  Thanks anyway Debra-- this one just isn't for me.

Basically, it's a step up from canned frosting.  Used Hershey brand Hot Fudge Topping.  Even if I did like the flavor the consistency was too runny.  Adding a cup of powdered sugar helped to save it some, but homemade is so easy and cheaper without the fudge topping why bother?  Would I make it again? Sorry, no.

Amazing!  I didn't have the hot fudge topping so I used chocolate pudding (I had a Snack Pack in the cupboard) and it turned out delicious.  Not overpowering and really light and fluffy.  :)

Really Really good!  I used all butter and did an oops by using 1/2 cup butter for the 1/4 cup shortening.  I did have to chill it for a few minutes but it piped well after that.  I put it on cupcakes (from Sandy's Chocolate Cake) that I had dipped in a basic Ganache.  I have to make some more in the morning to frost the rest of the cupcakes - it made enough for 3 dozen - and I will use the correct amount of butter and maybe 1.5 T of milk just to see if it will be a bit more firm but it better not change the taste!!!

I would never classify this as a buttercream frosting.  It pretty much tasted like a sweeter version of frosting from a can.  Much too sweet, and also much too runny.  It would probably be OK on a sheet cake, but on a layer cake it literally ran down the sides a bit and pooled on the cake plate.  Definitely will not be making again.

WOW - this icing is incredible!!!! I didn't have a full cup of the hot fudge topping (more like 1/2), so I increased the cocoa a little to compensate.  Who needs cake with icing like that!!!!!

Be very careful with this recipe.  I could not find any "hot fudge" sauce at the store, so I bought Hershey's chocolate sauce instead, and the icing turned out horribly.  The taste of the syrup was too strong (and they syrup, I've found, is awful itself) and the icing far too runny and difficult to work with.  Make sure you use a proper fudge sauce, or you'll end up like I did.

OH MY!! This frosting was soooo good... I hate frosting but I ate this by the spoonfuls!! My only big mistake was not softening the butter  before mixing and that caused it to be too lumpy, but even after that mistake it was still delectable!! Thanks for sharing!!

Second time making it and it tastes good. First time replaced hot fudge sauce for nutella and everyone loved it. This time replaced it with president's choice brand "old fashion dark chocolate" dessert topping and the frosting tastes great too. Thanks for the recipe,no more buying premade frosting since it is getting as pricy as making it from scratch.

Yummy! I tried 2 versions of this recipe as a blindfold taste test for my family: 1. Nutella in place of hot fudge and, 2. Trader Joes Organic Midnight Moo Choc Flavored Syrup in place of hot fudge. Hands down, #2 (chocolate syrup) won. My husband is really fussy about his frosting, preferring it to taste like his moms. My kids like anything sweet, but not sickly sweet. The Nutella didn't quite have a big enough 'kick' of hazelnut, so it was almost a waste of Nutella. The chocolate syrup gave the cocoa more of a deep chocolate flavor. Next time I will try it with a "real" hot fudge topping (I just didn't have any in the house, and the TJ's stuff seemed "healthier", LOL)

I love love love this recipe - the best chocolate frosting I've ever made and my men love it! The hot fudge topping is the 'over the top' ingredient here. Be sure to use hot fudge and not just chocolate syrup, which would make the frosting way too thin.

This frosting tastes like a candy bar!!! I couldn't scrape the bowl clean enough! lol I'll definitely be making this again and again and again!!! In my opinion it does not make a standard batch---this recipe actually yields half a batch, so if you plan to completely frost a 2 layer cake, double the recipe.

Thank you! Awesome recipe. I substituted the shortening with cream cheese and used dark hot fudge and it was the smoothest, creamiest, fudgiest frosting. Not that sugary sickly sweet stuff you get from a bakery or at the store. Delicious!

OMG this is good!  I put it the cupcakes with the cookie dough in the middle (from this site). Absolutely delicious pairing. This frosting is creamy and chocolatey. My new go to icing.  Thanks! (I used 3 Tbsp whole milk, by the way).

This buttercream frosting tastes okay.  It is nothing special.  It was too runny.  The frosting kept falling off the sides of the cake.  The top layer was sliding off and had broke into two pieces when I went to check on the cake.  The frosting between the layers was oozing out the sides of the cake.  If I make this frosting again, I think I will add more sugar to see if that helps.

Wow - delicious!  The hot fudge flavor came through and was scrumptious!  I paired with an almond cake and this overwhelmed the flavor and came off as more of a white cake w/ chocolate frosting.  I wouldn't pair with the almond again, but would use on a white/yellow cake!

THE BEST frosting EVER!  We all fight over who gets the beater.  I use it for just about any dessert that calls for chocolate frosting.  I've even used caramel topping in a pinch and I was no less impressed.

EXCELLENT chocolate frosting recipe! I've never been pleased with chocolate frosting recipes until now. This produces a wonderful frosting rich in chocolate flavor and not gritty, but silky smooth! The hot fudge is the secret. It is a very soft frosting. I did not try piping it, but suspect this would be challenging. Frosting may not hold it's shape when piped. Chilling it will thicken it up and may allow for a better piping consistency, however, finished cake should then be refrigerated. I've made this frosting a few times with consistent results. ****ADDENDUM-11/15/2013****  To produce a great piping consistency without detracting from taste and smoothness, DO NOT add the milk! I wanted to pipe this frosting so this is how I accomplished this-Chill the hot fudge topping, this is key. (I used Smucker's brand 11.75 oz, which is perfect amount to add, so no need to measure it) Whip butter & shortening til very light in color. Add the vanilla & about 2 or 3 T of the hot fudge topping and beat on high til well combined. Add the 1/3 of the cocoa (make sure to use a DARK cocoa, preferably a Dutched cocoa or blend of) & powdered sugar (use pure cane sugar, it will be labeled as such. very important) mixture. Beat on high for a min. Continue with another 1/3 of mixture. After adding last 1/3, mix in well, scrap down sides & beat on high for 2 to 3 min. Add rest of hot fudge, blend in then beat on high for 3 to 5 minutes. Wha-la! Perfectly smooth chocolately piping frosting!

This tastes so great, but doesn't have the same consistency as regular buttercream.  It is a great recipe to use as a filling frosting or as a frosting that you don't intend to decorate with.  Not a great decorator frosting though.  So delicious though.

This frosting was yummy!  Not too sweet, not overly fudgy, and a great spreading texture and look.  I generously frosted a 9X13 yellow cake and still have about a cup left over.  I think I'll sub butter for the shortening next time though, I didn't really like the slickness of even such a small amount of shortening.  Great recipe!

This tastes exactly like you'd expect a frosting that contains shortening and a packaged/processed ingredient to taste. I knew better...trust your instincts.

This is the BEST chocolate frosting that I have ever made. I used organic butter (no shortening) and organic heavy cream in place of the milk. I think that the kicker was using a scratch-made fudge topping though. The frosting was really wonderful on the One Bowl Chocolate Cake from this site (and the Hershey's cocoa package) and was more then enough to frost it as a 2-layer. The weather was hot when I made it so I iced and refrigerated it for a day before serving. I let it come to room temperature before we ate it. The leftovers freeze beautifully too.  Individually wrap the pieces and just let them sit out for as long as you can wait!

Love the taste of this one. It does not have that "powdered sugar" taste. The fudge is a nice addition. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the consistency. It was a bit thin...which I should have just added more confectioners sugar. I will probably be using this recipe for any cakes I make that need chocolate frosting!!!

YUM.  I used dutch process cocoa, replaced the hot fudge with Nutella, and didn't use any vanilla (I was lazy and didn't think it needed it anyway).  I added a bit more confec sugar (maybe 1/2 cup?) to make it more suitable for piping.  I haven't decorated the cake yet, so I can't speak for the consistency, but the taste is sinful.  I will definitely try this with the hot fudge sometime.

Easy to make. Nice buttercream texture. I was expecting a heavier (ganache-like) frosting. But it is good. It made enough to generously frost my two 9-inch layers ("Fudge Cake" from this site) and thoroughly satisfied my chocolate craving! It is August and the frosting is pretty soft, I'm keeping the cake in the refrigerator. It isn't falling off the cake like some reviewers said, but I didn't have to use any milk while adding the powdered sugar to get a smooth mixture.

I made this icing for a yellow two layer cake which was more than enough. According to my family, it was absolutely delicious and they loved the fudge taste. I gave this four stars only because it doesn't hold up very well when it's warm in the house and tends to melt off the cake.

I used Smuckers hot fudge sauce and I didn't like the flavor at all! I believe that the outcome of this recipe is heavily dependant on the type/brand of hot fudge used.  The smuckers was quite bitter tasting and so was the icing.  I am sure that a better hot fudge sauce would yield better flavor.  Perhaps someone could recommend a good brand.

I loved how convenient it was to make. I didn't have to melt chocolate in a double boiler and all the easiness came from the jar. This is a lighter colored chocolate frosting so I added an extra 1/3 c. of cocoa powder and used the whole jar of chocolate fudge (Mrs. Richardson's brand). My boyfriend and I loved it. Its not too sweet..just right. I will use this recipe to frost cupcakes next! Great recipe. thanks.

This was not the frosting I expected.  It was lighter in color than I wanted and it tasted like hot cocoa. I made it for a devils food cake and wasn't impressed with the flavor.  It was also a little runny with two tablespoons of milk.  If you make this frosting you may want to add some melted chocolate and add the milk after you mix in the topping, that way you can get the proper consistency.

I read the other reviews and took into consideration some said it tasted "bitter", I added a little salt (as was told to do when working with chocolate, from my husband's aunt).  Rave reviews from Birthday goers where I served the cake.

WOW!! I normally hate frosting but this was just amazing. I'd make this without a cake--creamy and chocolately and oh-so-good. Easy to make and can be done while your cake is baking. Definitely try it out.

Very rich, very yummy. I used Smuckers hot fudge topping and Watkins pure vanilla extract (only used 1/2 teas. though as I didn't think it needed 1 full teas). It turned out smooth and creamy. I will definitely use this recipe again. Maybe on a PB cake...mmmmmm.

I was in a panic looking for a tasty chocolate frosting for some last-minute cupcakes for a baby shower and was fortunate enough to stumble on this recipe.  It was very good - not boring like some homemade chocolate frostings can seem to be.  I didn't even have the full cup of hot fudge topping (probably more like a half cup) and it still turned out awesome!  Oh, I used all butter too - my last frosting I made with half shortening and half butter was nasty.

We were trying to duplicate a choc fudge cake made for us by a five star chef.  This icing definitely hit the mark. It was like creamy fudge on top of cake  and not too sweet. Complimented our cake base perfectly. Thank you!!

I don't like the flavor of this frosting, and it is super soft/runny. I had to put in an extra cup of sugar to get it thicker and even still it's not stiff enough. Plus now it has a whipped texture from all the mixing, which I hate. Wish I had stuck with regular chocolate buttercream.

This is the 2nd time i used this recipe and I'm not sure why people are finding it too runny - too many tablespoons of milk perhaps? I used only 3 tablespoons, the consistency is perfect (I put it in the fridge and pipe it the following day just for easiness sake!), the taste is divine! I used Hersheys hot-fudge but plan on making a 'low fat' version of this recipe in the near future.

Hubby also gave it the thumbs up and loved it - but he's easy to please.  The first batch I co-baked with my best friend, the frosting went on 'Sandy's chocolate cake' baked into cupcakes and people were saying it was the best cupcake/frosting they've ever had! 

LOVE it - easy, quick and delicious - what more could you want?

This was AMAZING.  I've never had so many people fighting over cleaning out the bowl of frosting when I was done.  We used smuckers special recipe hot fudge.  Note that the hot fudge is always much easier to measure out of the container when it's room temp...

I LOVE this recipe.  I did take the advice of others & was careful with the milk, only one T.  I used Butter Flavor Crisco for the shortening, & for the hot fudge used the Hershey's Hot Fudge. (Although I tasted it before adding & thought it was very good on it's own! )   It is very sweet, so if you want less try a dark cocoa powder.
It is not as dark looking as shown in the picture, but still very pretty.  I will not buy canned ever again. :-)

I HAVE to comment on this frosting because it was just sooooo good! I am not a baker (I need to say that) my desserts usually taste great but look kind of sad- and this frosting saved my cake! It was perfect! I made a few smallish changes due to the ingredients I had on hand (I doubled the recipe for a layer cake) I used heavy cream instead of milk and 3 quarters of the recipe amount for the hot fudge- and the same for the sugar. I added just a little more of teh vanilla as well. A+ Thank you!

I usually hate frosting especially chocolate, but this was amazing. I loved it and everyone else did too! I didn't use shortening but just upped the butter. Love butter. Haha~ I made this with my boyfriend and he mixed to the point where there is no possible way to doubt that this would be grainy. Very smooth and delicious. Will use again! =)

OMG this was sooo good.  Very creamy and smooth.  I used about a 1/4 jar of hot fudge melted.  I would definately make this again.  This is a saver and so easy to make.

I loved this frosting! I don't like normal buttercream frosting (don't like the powdered sugar taste), but this stuff was great! Followed the recipe exactly and got perfectly smooth chocolate frosting. It is a little soft, but a few minutes in the fridge fixed that. This is my go-to recipe for chocolate frosting from now on.

I did not care for this recipe!!!!  I had to make my husband a new birthday cake because of this icing.  It is way too runny and the top part of the cake kept sliding off the bottom.  All of the icing ran off of the cake and the cake stand was covered with icing!!  I even added a ton of cornstarch, which didn't help.  I followed the directions exactly as stated.  The taste was good but don't recommend for decorating!

This frosting was way too thin in consistency. Even adding an additional cup confectioner's sugar, the frosting was too gloppy.  Unless you plan to frost only the top of a cake in a pan or refrigerate your cake, choose a different recipe.

I did do some changes to the recipe.  I used all unsalted butter, heavy cream instead of milk, and instead of the hot fudge topping, i made dark chocolate ganache.  I cooled the ganache down in the refrigerator to let it thicken and the frosting tasted great.  It had a pronounced dark chocolate flavor, but I was disappointed by the color.  I did want that deep, rich fudgy brown.  Next time, I won't add the two tablespoons of heavy cream and I shall just spoon in the ganache to thicken it a bit.  Other than that, the taste was magnificent.

Pretty good.  I gave it 4 stars because of the consistancy.  I was thinking fudge, and it's not quite what I was imagining.  I did think it was a bit softer than it should be and put my cake in the fridge to firm up.  Good flavor but not overwhelmingly chocolate considering the ingredients.

*UPDATE* I USED CARMEL TOPPING INSTEAD BECAUSE THE BDAY GIRL LOVES CARMEL AND IT TURNED OUT GREAT!  IT WAS A NICE VARIATION....NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL BUT STILL GREAT, TRY IT IF YOU LIKE CARMEL! This is the best home made frosting I have ever had!.....I am not a buttercream frosting lover...in fact I usually scrape it off but I couldn't get enough of this one and neither could the people that I made it for.  This will definately be the go to frosting recipe for me.  Thanks!

A very creamy smooth frosting with a wonderfully fudgey and chocolately taste.  The recipe as is, is great for just frosting a cake.  I wanted something a little bit thicker so I added an additional cup of confectioners' sugar.  It didn't take away from the flavor at all.  I also used dark chocolate cocoa powder for this recipe.

Perfect chocolate frosting.  It's like the stuff in a can only a million times better.  Made exactly as the recipe reads.

My family loved this! I made 1 1/2 x the recipe, which was more than enough to generously frost a 9" two-layer cake (we like lots of frosting). After reading the reviews, I used Nutella instead of fudge topping, heavy whipping cream in place of the milk (just a tiny bit more than the recipe called for), and all butter instead of butter + shortening. The taste and consistency were perfect. I put this on a 'doctored' Duncan Hines white cake (3 whole eggs instead of egg whites, buttermilk instead of water, 4 Tbsp melted butter instead of 2 Tbsp oil, plus 1/2 Tbsp vanilla and approx. 3/4 cup sour cream)- Yum! Will definitely make again.

This was just okay. It had a store-bought syrupy taste to it. Probably will not make again.

I've made this quite a few times now and it has officially become my default chocolate frosting. I've made it using dark chocolate hot fudge and nutella. It's always so good! Light and fluffy, a very whipped texture. Def for the chocolate lover. Great recipe!

I'm giving this 4 1/2 stars because it was slightly too sweet. I will add less sugar next time. The frosting came out perfect, I added heavy cream instead of milk and I let the frosting sit in the fridge for about 20min before frosting my cupcakes. I'll never buy store brand again. thanks for the great recipe.

This is the best frosting I've ever made.  That being said, it was still slightly "softer" than I would have like.  I think I'll put it in the fridge for a while next time.  But, definitely a keeper

Exceptional icing. Perfect consistency. I prefer using Nutella instead of the fudge topping, and substitute almond extract for the vanilla which gives it incredible flavor. My favorite chocolate icing!

I love how some people complain that this is "too sweet" and "too chocolatey." It's called "Chocolate Fudge Frosting" people. Anyway, this makes a very good filling for a layer cake, which is what I used it for. Really good and "sweet!" :

If I could give this frosting more than five stars, I would. It's so chocolate-y.
And one of the fluffiest frostings I've ever made. The perfect compliment to my Too Much Chocolate Cake.

I'm for sure going to make this again!

Very good.  I agree with other reviewers that the choice of fudge topping will influence the final outcome.  I used Hersheys because that is the only kind they had at the grocery store, but it worked well. I decided to wait until the end to see if I needed the milk, and I did not need it.  However, I did double the amount of vanilla.  

Overall, this was a creamy rich frosting that does not have the "raw/flour" taste that I have noticed in some other chocolate frosting recipes.

I used it on cupcakes for my son's birthday and they turned out great.  I doubled the recipe and it was just enough to generously frost 3 dozen cupcakes. I would definitely use this recipe again.

This frosting recipe was OUTSTANDING and really easy to make.  I used the Nutella as opposed to the hot chocolate sauce as suggested by some of the other reviewers and the taste was phenomenal.  I will use this recipe again many times.

The frosting was very easy to pipe, too.

A delicious, fluffy chocolate frosting recipe to add to your collection!  I only made two adjustments:  added an additional ½ cup of powdered sugar, and subsituted two tablespoons half and half for the two tablespoons of milk.  This recipe makes enough frosting to frost a 2-layer, 9-inch round cake...including the filling between the layers.  It was easy to make, and it is almost chocolate mousse-like in consistency.  I used it to frost a marble cake.  Yum!

This frosting had a nice consistency without adding extra powdered sugar. I did not heat the fudge topping (Dove's Dark) and I used 2 T heavy cream in place of the milk. While it was good, it wasn't great. I tested this icing against 3 other fudge icings, and it came in 2nd. It lacked the full-bodied flavor of another recipe from another site. But if you're looking for fudge icings, it's definitely better than Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting (also on this site). That came in last place on my taste test.

This was very rich and fudgy. I made use of some fudge topping that no one seemed to want on their ice cream too, so I'm always pleased when a recipe used up leftovers too. This icing was dense and heavy though and while it was very good, I prefer a lighter more whipped icing. This was just a little too rich, too heavy, too much for the chocolate cake I made it for. Awesome fudgey taste though. Thanks Debra for this nice fudgy icing.

This was very delicious. Thanks to those who recommended hot fudge topping brands; Mrs. Richardson's was my choice. I had increased the recipe for an 11x15 sheet cake (the Four Egg Yellow Cake found here), which actually turned out better for some of the measurements - the whole jar of hot fudge topping was needed. I did add a little more powdered sugar for the basic frosting. I had a small amount left for decorating that needed only a bit of extra powdered sugar. My mother-in-law, a 100% scratch baker, had nothing but praise.  Thank you!

Oh my was this frosting heavenly! I was very impressed with the taste and texture. It was very creamy and easily spreadable. 

I made a basic yellow cake and frosted with this recipe and the cake turned out wonderful. 

I'm adding this recipe to my family favorites box!

Thanks for sharing.

I LOVE THIS ICING!!!  I took a cake decorating course and tried many different chocolate buttercreams and none even came close to this one!!!  I used a dark chocolate fudge sauce and it turned out awesome.  I did add more icing sugar to make it thicker for piping docorations.  I highly recommend this to any chocolate lover!!

Today, for my father-in-law's birthday, I made the most fabulous yellow cake from epicurious.  I made three...count them, THREE types of frosting, including a ganache with 1 lb of very expensive chocolate, cream, etc.
This was, by far, the closest to what I was looking for.
Sort of like tub frosting but much better. Light, smooth, chocolate...Mmmmm.
I'm almost embarrased by the simplicity of this recipe.  It's like cheating.
Terrific!!!  I'm putting this one in the old metal recipe box.

everyone's favorite.. the cake i made was simply AWFUL, and this frosting was so good it almost saved it. the second time i made this i actually used just butter, as i forgot to get shortening, and it made it very rich, but still delicious. this has been my best allrecipe find so far..thank you!

Very easy to make and I loved the consistency.  I used Smuckers fudge.  The only thing I didn't care for was that the frosting had a slight bitterness to it.  Anyone else notice this?

Awsome!  I loved the combination of the fudge and the buttercream; it is rich, but it is suposed to be.  My kids and I are self avowed Chocoholics and we could have eaten it all plain in one sitting.

I made this with a cakeish type brownie recipe and everyone freaked out over it.  My neighbor wouldn't even share with her kids and she normally doesn't keep anything for herself.

Added a half teaspoon more of vanilla extract and a half teaspoon of salt after tasting it the way it was. The salt really helped to bring out the chocolate flavour. This is super creamy and I've had to hide the bowl from my husband!

Amazing! Tasted like I was eating fudge! It was a bit thin for decorating a cake, so I added 3/4 c. - 1 c. powdered sugar to make it more manageable. It dried out faster, but I just stirred it to get it to the right consistency again. This will be my forever chocolate icing recipe!!

This is the most scrumptious chocolate frosting I have ever had! Smooth and creamy and rich but not too much so. Very happy I stuck with the recipe and added the hot fudge topping - it made all the difference.

Frosting tastes amazing! The only downfall is the slight oily feeling in your mouth afterwards. That could have been caused by the hot fudge topping I used as well though. I used the Smuckers brand. Will try again next time with a different brand of hot fudge topping and post my results. :)

This frosting is very good. Like others have said, it really depends on the quality of hot fudge sauce that you use. I recommend Smuckers.

Absolutely my go-to chocolate frosting.  I've used it on banana cake, yellow cake, chocolate cake, and this weekend I'm making it for a green vanilla and fudge marble ZOMBIE CAKE for my six year-old's birthday!!  Follow the recipe exactly, do NOT skip the hot fudge.  It's SO delicious!

I was skeptical about the hot fudge but this turned out very good. I used all shortening because i wanted to use my shortening supply up. If I could do one thing different next time is add the milk at the end to control the texture. It was a bit runny but I was still able to frost the Crazy Cake off this website fine. (By the way this frosting on the Crazy Cake is a divine rich chocolate dessert! )

Delicious.  I used homemade hot fudge (this is super easy to make guys... three ingredients - 1 can of sweetened condensed milk, 6 oz of unsweetened chocolate bar, 2 T butter and heat slowly in a pan) and the flavor was outstanding.  

Don't forget to sift!  I forgot and it wasn't as good as if I would've remembered... just got late and I got in a hurry.  This was pretty simple though.  It made a lot too!  I had about 18 cupcakes and I had LOTS left over.  Just FYI.  Made boring cake-mix cupcakes a little more special!!

Very good. Took the advice of another and used 2/3 cup of Nutella instead of hot fudge.  It was fantastic. Perfect consistency to use in a cake decorator too.

Just enough to frost 2 stacked 9inch round cakes.  Made with Nutella rather than fudge as other reviewer suggested, and what a pleasant surprise! SO good, next time I will make more so I have enough to pipe around base and top without skimping on the coat around the cake. (pic shows with crushed kit-kat)

I didn't have hot fudge sauce, so used up my jar of Nutella, about 3/4 cup.  Still the BEST chocolate buttercream I've ever had.  This stuff could be sold as a cure for PMS!

Omg! I have never left a review and I joined just so I could! I am overall an average cook/baker at best, I changed a couple things due to not having hot fudge topping and reading hints from others... I like a nice dark chocolate that's not bitter and with the changes I made this was sooooo amazing! I have never made frosting and this makes me feel like a friggen genius! Lol I added more coco and less confectioners sugar same total amount, used a hunts choc pudding snack pack instead of fudge and two teaspoons of vanilla, LOVE! Thank you so much for this recipe!!

My husband made this to ice a dark chocolate cake, and the icing has a wonderful milk chocolate taste, but it wasn't a stiff icing like we had hoped. It was not exactly runny, but a creamy consistency. Not sure if I would make this again.

Just frost my cake and this icing was sooo creamy/delicious. I took suggestion of others and substitued half/half for the milk as well as chocolate syrup for the fudge. I could stand for it to be just a hint sweeter - but overall this is a MUST have recipe for the box.

This was my first attempt at "homemade" frosting.  LOVED THIS RECIPE - it turned out awesome!!  I never like to review after I've tweaked, but I did use heavy whipping cream instead of milk.  Silky and delicious!!

This icing came out amazing! Instead of hot fudge topping, I used plain old Hershey's chocolate syrup (slightly less than the full cup... maybe 3/4 cup) and it tastes delicious. The frosting is light and creamy and sweet but not overly sweet. I will definitely be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing.

Just mixed up the frosting. Of course, like many professional bakers recommend, I beat the butter(unsalted) and shortening about 8 minutes. These were the changes I made that made it delicious and a good frosting consistency.  I used 1/2 cup Smuckers Special Dark Topping. It really doesn't taste that fudgy but that was definitely o.k. with me. I just wanted a good tasting chocolate buttercream frosting. I used 2 tsp. half and half.  A little over a tablespoon of vanilla. Perfect sweetness.  A recipe that could be varied easily. Smooth and I can hardly wait to frost my halloween cupcakes.

Great, rich chocolately taste with a good consistency. I put this on my husband's birthday cake, and it was a hit. It reminds me of fudge. I don't use shortening, so I just used extra butter in place of the shortening. Will go to this recipe for all my chocolate frosting in the future.

Mercy!  This is so good!  I used a dark chocolate fudge topping and a brute cocoa powder for a very dark chocolate frosting.  I subbed the milk with Kahlua. WOW - wonderful texture and not overly sweet.  Piped well and spread like a dream!

Oh my goodness, the most delicious chocolate frosting ever! My hubby hates chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, but he ate this up when we put it on a chocolate cake. So chocolate-y and yummy! Perfect texture.

YUMMY!!  I used 1 cup butter on accident so I decided on not using the shortening.  I also added the hot fudge topping prior to adding the milk.  This is a keeper!!!

i used this frosting to cover the chocolate applesauce cake recipe from this site.  i made 2 9" cakes and spread a cool whip cream cheese frosting between them.  i then topped the cake with this fudge buttercream.  I thought it was too thin personally, and prefer a different texture in my frostings.  i think this could be remedied if you add the fudge topping first, and then the milk, only adding as much milk as you want to thin it out.  however this had vey nice flavor that wasn't overly sweet as so many frostings are.  thanks!

This is the most incredible chocolate frosting. My only tip is don't over-beat it or it will be runny. I use this whenever I need a chocolate frosting. I always save the leftover frosting - it's great warmed up and poured over ice cream...

Awesome.  I used heavy cream as others had suggested and smuckers hot fudge topping and it was the best frosting I've ever tried.  I will NEVER buy store chocolate frosting again.  Color was beautiful and it spread like a dream.  I served this with the fabulous fudge chocolate cake (from this site) at my step fathers 50th birthday and already had my brother in law requesting it for his birthday.  I filled the cake with chocolate ganache and sliced strawberries.  Everyone loved it.

Honestly the best chocolate frosting I have made. Next time I think I would use a little less sugar because it was a little sweet. Delicious nonetheless!

Wowza...what more can I say?  Very rich, perfect frosting.  We just frosted a cake with this with no piping; as made is too gooey (right word?) to use for decoration but sure you could add more sugar to thicken to your desired consistency.  Will use again and again when our blood streams thin out!! LOL

My husband is very picky when it comes to his cake and frosting. Me, I love it buttery him, not so much. I have tried several different recipes for icing seeing if he liked a particular icing and he always said it was okay UNTIL I fixed this one. It is super yummy. Not too buttery and just enough sweet! The only things I done differently were #1 I used half and half instead of milk and #2 I added more cocoa. This is delicious! Goes great withy modified Hershey recipe for chocolate cake. Thanks so much for sharing

this frosting was okay.  i was hoping for a deeper, darker color than i ended up w/ also, it tasted almost identical to store-bought frosting, which was SOO not what i wanted.  It's good, don't get me wrong, but if your looking for a deeper, fudgier frosting -- this isn't it.

Love, love, love this recipe! So easy and the taste is light, creamy. The frosting is very spreadable, and the color is great. I omitted the fudge and didn't level off the sugar and used organic cocoa. This made a light chocolate flavor which was perfect for the family! This is fantastic. I can't say enough

Very Disappointing recipe.  I expected this to be an above average frosting with the added expense of hot fudge topping.  However, I thought it had a "waxy" taste.  I will never make frosting again that calls for "shortening" in the recipe.  My husband thought it was fine, but if you love true BUTTERCREAM, you will be disappointed using the shortening.

Made without alterations and it came out great.  The color is not near as dark as the picture, but the texture was smooth and glossy - very easy to work with.  Tastes great, perfectly sweetened.

I love chocolate frosting (I don't waste calories on anything else) and this is the best I have tasted. It is smooth and creamy and delicious! My son-in-law said it was better than the chocolate frosting from our local bakery, which he loves! From now on this is the only chocolate frosting I will make!

Made exactly as directed, and it's fantastic!  Much better than canned frosting.  I heated the hot fudge, even though I wasn't sure if I should do that or not.  Best chocolate frosting I have ever made, and very easy.

Love it! I used this frosting recipe to go on top of my layered chocolate fudge cake & it is the best chocolate frosting I have ever tasted, its amazing! I think the key ingredient is the hot fudge topping (the stuff that comes in a glass jar, not the chocolate syrup).

I have been looking for an easy chocolate frosting for so long.  My search is over!  I had been making cooked frosting but this is soooooo much easier and tastes just as good.  I used regular shortening, but next time I may try the butter flavor shortening to give the frosting a richer butter taste.  Definately use Smuckers hot fudge.  It has a great consistency and very smooth.  I got rave reviews the first time I made it.  I did use more like a 1/3 cup of whole milk to thin it just a bit.  But the overall taste was fabulous!

I used maybe too thin of a hot fudge, maybe would have been better if thickened by refrigerating it beforehand. Since it was so syrupy (was still yummy though - be good for strawberry dipping) I just added more powdered sugar and cocoa till I got the desired consistency and flavor. Really yummy! Will try a different topping next time and see if that helps too. :)

This got great reviews from everyone.  At first bite it tastes like a good chocolate frosting, but after it "mellows' in your mouth the 'hot fudge' flavor really comes through.  It does get quite soft if left out, too soft to pipe on.  I quickly piped it on refrigerated cupcakes, then quickly put it back in the frig for an hour to set.  That gave me enough time to get the cupcakes about 2 miles down the road, to my kids school, in 100 degree weather :)

Wow! This was so good, I couldn't stop eating it out of the bowl after I finished making it!! I followed the recipe exactly and used Hersheys hot fudge. I think next time I will experiment a little and use 1/2 cup hot fudge, 1/2 cup nutella (my hubby loves nutella). This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Maybe it was my choice in ice cream topping, but this had a very odd aftertaste.  But because I was short on time, I decided to use it on my cake anyway and everyone seemed to really like it.  I don't think I'll make it again.

Super delicious.  I thought it was thin as directed (and needed to frost a layer cake), so I doubled the amount of powdered sugar and left out the milk.  The first day the hot fudge topping taste really stood out, but after tasting some leftover frosting 2 days later, the flavors have melded together wonderfully.  The best chocolate frosting I've made.  I'll keep using it, and I'll play with the flavors (nutella, kahlua instead of milk...num!)

If you love hot fudge, you will love this frosting! It's delicious.  I added about a 1/4 cup more of powdered sugar just to thicken it up a bit.  I'm not sure that it would pipe well, but it may work if you stiffen it up.  My new go-to chocolate frosting.

Great recipe. I didn't have fudge topping so I used honey and a bit more milk and cocoa powder. It turned into a milk chocolate buttercream, which was still great!

Just about the best chocolate frosting ever!  Everyone loved it.  Will use it many more times I am sure.  I would let it set in the fridge for a little while next time before frosting the cake.  It was a little soft.  It made plenty, we had left overs after a normal sized cake.

Yum! I've always been a bit partial to canned chocolate frosting, as it's so rich compared to other homemade ones I've tried, but this is really good.  The hot fudge is the kicker, obviously. I used less sugar so get the consistency I was looking for. Tasty. Thanks! :)

Loved this frosting.  I used Smuckers fudge topping at the suggestion of another rater but I think I'd prefer Hershey's.  I put this on top of cupcakes using the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe for my grandmother's birthday and my whole family raved about it.  Thanks!

Good frosting. I thought it was better when I tasted it before adding the hot fudge topping, next time I think I will stop at this point for a richer, fudgier taste. Still very good frosting.

I was hesitant to use the hot fudge topping, but I ended up adding the whole cup and loving it.  I used the highest quality hot fudge I could find, and I think that helped.  Good consistency, spread easily on my cake, and set up very well.  Be careful not to use too much, as it is very sweet, but a thin layer was perfect!

I made this recipe twice and it turned out wonderfully both times.  It pipes beautifully when using a star tip.  Be sure to sift all ingredients before using them for smooth frosting.

A keeper! I used Hershey's special dark cocoa powder and butter-flavored shortening, but I don't know if I would do that again. I used literally, the whole jar of smuckers hot fudge. Amazing.

This is a great tasting chocolate frosting. It is smooth and has a deep chocolate flavor. It is a relatively easy frosting to make.  I did not have hot fudge topping, so I substituted an equal amount of whipped ganache(made of chocolate and whipping cream). I  was impressed.

This recipe is great!!! I changed it a little, instead of putting 1 cup of hot fudge topping I added chocolate syrup. The frosting was delicious but there was a problem with it...you needed to keep it in the fridge because the frosting may melt a little.

This frosting is fantastic!  Just finished up making it to frost some chocolate cupcakes to take to a Halloween Party.  I'm lucky that it made it on the cupcakes.  I couldn't stop eating it!  It has a great taste and consistency.  This will be my go to frosting for now on.  I followed the recipe exactly.

This is WONDERFUL chocolate frosting (and believe me... In 11 years of cake decorating, I've tried many!).  I always avoided this recipe because I never had hot fudge in the house.  This definitely makes it worth the trip to the store!  I added VERY little milk (2 Tbls?) and the consistency was perfect.

Wow! Tried this twice and it was a hit both times! A little sceptical because I could only find the Hershey chocolate sauce in the little yellow can.. but it was great! The second time, I probably only put in 3 tbsp of the chocolate sauce and it tasted just as good! It even looked fluffier than my first batch. Will be a keeper!

I truly enjoyed the flavor of this frosting! I used only the two tablespoons of milk specified only I used heavy cream. The frosting was pretty thick until I added the fudge topping. Once I added the fudge topping the consistency was right where I wanted it to be. I used Mrs. Richardsons's fudge and did not find that the flavor was overwhelming. I will use this frosting for my chocolate layer cakes!

I made this to top a cake I made for my church group. I recieved tons of compliments one of the girls even said it was the best chocolate cake she had ever tasted. I ran out of the fudge so I did have caramel sauce and half hot fudge. It could be because I melted them down a bit that it was difficult using this frosting to make a 2 layer cake. Overall deliscious!

I have used recipes from this site for at least 4 years.  This is the first that I have taken the time to review... AWESOME! Made for husband's bday cake.  Doubled recipe for 2 layer 9" cake as hubby loves frosting.  Used Kroger brand hot fudge... divine!

I am sorry, but I have to disagree with others that rated this a 5..I followed the recipe exactly and I don't know if it was the Smuckers hot fudge or what...but I did not like the taste at all.  It had a 'different taste' than I was expecting.  Earlier I had made the Quick Fudge Frosting and we liked it much better.....sorry, I usually agree but not this time.-

1st let me say, I HATE FROSTING!  I just hate it, every flavor.  But, my children and husband won't eat cake or brownies without frosting.  I used this recipe to frost a cake because it had good reviews and I had all the ingredients in my cupboard.  I was totally amazed when I ACTUALLY LIKED IT!  I don't usually do reviews, but I had to do one for this frosting.  It is simply the best frosting I have ever had and so easy to make.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone who likes frosting or doesn't, because my family was delighted with it too.  Thank you so much for a great frosting recipe!

I usually follow a recipe exactly as written, but then I got a little milk happy and ended up adding too much because I was unsure of the consistency. It sort of turned into a ganache and looked terrible, but tasted great on the cake!

I didn't have the hot fudge sauce.  But, it was good and spread beautifully.  Though I found it a bit on the too sweet side.  I will try again - with the fudge - but I'll cut the powdered sugar.

Made this last night to frost some devil's food cupcakes. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out absolutely delicious. There was quite a bit leftover...and I promptly ate most of it right out of the bowl.  I used Smucker's chocolate fudge topping and it was perfect with the rich chocolate cake.  Super easy and amazing taste!

I'd been looking for a good chocolate buttercream frosting for the cupcakes I seem to make constantly when I ran across the recipe a few weeks ago. I wanted a more mild chocolatey taste so I melted a cup of Giradelli milk chocolate chips and used it in place of the fudge topping. This is now my primary chocolate frosting.

I used this on a layered version of Too Much chocolate cake and won the dessert contest at my holiday party.  I tried making a similar recipe and it came out gritty...I think the key in this is the fudge and sifting the ingredients.  Next time I'll try omitting the milk for a thicker piping texture.

Wow, this was the best frosting I've ever had. Until I made this, I thought all frostings were the same. I'll always make this one from now on. I think the fudge topping was the key.

Great frosting! The fudge topping gives it such a deeper flavor. I will do this for chocolate frosting all the time now. Saves over very well, too!

i made this frosting exactly to the recipe for my boyfriend's 18th birthday cake :) the icing by itself was good, though it was a bit gritty, and needed to set quickly or it would literally fall off. However, the taste was DELICIOUS. I will NEVER go back to store-bought icing ever. I had some left over icing for decorating, and added 2 tablespoons peanut butter to 1/4 cup of the chocolate icing, and it was even better!!!! very versatile, very deliciouss

This is much less "fudgy" I think than the frosting in a can.  It's a lighter color, and a lighter flavor, and generally creamier in texture.  It frosted the cake very nicely and had a good flavor (although I prefer a stronger chocolate flavor).  Made no changes to the recipe.  Used it for a two-layer 8 inch round cake and had plenty to spare.

This recipe is good. I thought, with the addition of the hot fudge topping that it would be rich and dark like the featured photo. I was disappointed with the finished color, more of a light beige rather than a rick chocolate color.

I really liked this recipe but I didn't use it for what I intended.  I was making a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting from my son's first birthday.  It will be his first taste of chocolate.  This turned out to be a bit too bitter for that I believe.  I personally love bittersweet chocolate but I don't think it would be a good introduction to chocolate for my son.

This was the first "by scratch" frosting I've ever made. I decided to do something different than the canned stuff for my husbands birthday. THIS WAS A BIG HIT!! So tasty and perfect! I used Nutella instead of the fudge topping for that special, unique taste. i also added 1/2 more sugar to make it more stiff. 
I will make this for years to come!!

I would never of thought to use fudge topping in my frosting but tried this recipe and it was really good!
Only used 1/4 cup each of butter and margarine, 1/2 cup cocoa and I had to add 4 cups icing sugar. It was hot and humid which may be why but it was really nice to frost with.

I am giving this a 5 for it's flavor, it was rich and very chocolaty.  But it was very runny if you follow the recipe exactly.  Don't use this if you are decorating a cake, if you do add at least 2 more cups of powdered sugar.

I was hesitant about making this recipe because the last time I made buttercream frosting it was time consuming and way too sweet. This recipe, however, was amazing. Not only was it so simple to make, it was the perfect combination of chocolate, sweetness, and creaminess. I took another reviewer's advice and used Dove Hot Fudge Topping (I used the milk chocolate instead of her suggestion of the dark chocolate). I also used heavy cream in place of the milk like she suggested as well. Simple, delicious recipe. It was very easy to spread too, but if you like the spreadability of store bought frosting, then leave it in the fridge overnight.

Yum! This frosting tastes great! I used cream instead of milk and I used a homemade hot fudge topping. The only problem: it's too fluffy to pipe with and it melts if it gets hot in the kitchen, so it looses its shape. I will try to use a bit more confectioners' sugar next time to get it stiffer.

I really liked this frosting, used it for the Too Much Chocolate cake on this site.  I added 1/2 c of the ice cream topping last and it was enough.  I tasted it before the topping and it tasted excellent without it also, but I was afraid I wouldn't have enough.  I was able to frost a 2 layer cake with enough left over to pipe decorations on the top.

DELICIOUS! I used this to frost cupcakes for my daughter's class party, and I think I ate one for every five I frosted! I did not use the fudge topping (none on hand), but I look forward to making this recipe again with the fudge. The recipe doubled with no problem and didn't make my teeth hurt (always a good thing!). This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

Not being a big cake and frosting fan, I don't have a lot of experience with them.  Still, I thought this frosting was exceptional.  In fact, it was delicious before the hot fudge topping was even added.  I used Nestle's brand for the hot fudge topping.  I used this as the frosting for Cherry Chocolate Cake, available at allrecipes.com.  My wife and mother-in-law thought this was a first-class frosting recipe.

This frosting is fabulous! I used it to frost Kevin Ryan's A-Number-One Banana Cake on this site, then I pressed chopped, toasted hazelnuts into the sides of the cake. It was fantastic, and has quickly become one of our family's favorite cakes! From now on, I'm going to keep a jar of hot fudge on hand just for this recipe. Thanks!

Really good! Holds it's shape well and great, super chocolatey flavor. I used Stonewall Kitchen hot fudge sauce. Also added a teaspoon of espresso powder with the confectioner's sugar & Cocoa powder. Delish!

Added Nutella as another cook suggested since I was out of chocolate fudge flavor topping. I also used Butter flavored Crisco. This was an amazing frosting. Put the cake in the fridge after frosting. Doubled the recipe and made plenty for 3 layer cake, filling, and frosting.

I was torn between a 3 star or 4 star. I liked this recipe but I thought it tasted similar to store bought and not much like a buttercream. I added a little less milk so it wouldn’t be so runny. I would probably still make it again but I haven’t found that perfect chocolate frosting recipe yet.

Yummy creamy chocolate frosting! I made it with 1/2 caramel and 1/2 chocolate hot fudge topping. It just added another layer of flavor. Everyone LOVED it! I will definitely make again!

Made this frosting for the one bowl chocolate cake recipe in this website. It did cover a 2 layer cake but it was a little bit of a stretch. Followed recipe exactly but next time will add a bit more powdered sugar to make a little more.

Completely delicious!  I was looking for a sturdy chocolate buttercream for layered cakes, under fondant, etc.  This  rocked my world in taste, but unfortunately couldn't hold up to the job of layered cakes.  Even after adding a bunch more (almost double) the powdered sugar, it just didn't get sturdy like my regular buttercream, and smushed out the sides between the layers.  I WILL be using the recipe on certain types of cakes, again and again b/c everyone raved about the taste, but will continue my search for a buttercream for fancier/layered cakes.

The best chocolate frosting recipe I’ve found!!! Tips... watch how much milk you add and use good quality hot fudge, not chocolate syrup! I’ve made it a few times and my youngest asked for his cake to be frosted with this recipe!!

I made this recipe verbatim. It was awesome!  I used the fudge to put my cake together and filled it with raspberries. The frosting was chocolatey enough but not too sweet. It’s perfect!

I made this exactly how it was written in the recipe. It was wonderful.  It's not overly sweet which was nice.  It was more like a mousse. I will use this every time I make a chocolate icing.

Very tasty icing.  Made it using only 2 Tbsp Heavy whipping cream instead of milk and in order to use it in a piping bag had to add 2 more cups of powdered sugar. Otherwise, made as directed. Will make again for a chocolate butter cream

This is delicious. I will admit that I forgot the milk and used less confectioners sugar since the night before I made a buttercream icing that was super sweet due to so much sugar. Taste the icing as you make it. You may find you don’t need as much, depending on how sweet you want it.

not only was this incredibly easy to make... it's DELICIOUS! I'm a chocolate lover but was concerned it would be too sweet for those that aren't big on chocolate (like my hubby). But somehow, even with the fudge, it's just absolutely perfect!

Perfect as is. Doesn't require much mixing. I didn't have shortening, so I used solid coconut oil. My picky eaters definitely approved. Looks about to be enough for one dozen cupcakes even though the servings said 16.

I did this with 8 oz of bittersweet chocolate instead of the hot fudge. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it was a little gritty; probably my fault. I think I didn't adequately pulverize the the sugar. My family loves it!

First, let me say my husband loved it! I was going for a heavy, rich frosting, similar to the heavy All-American Chocolate Cake you find at Costco (the layer cake with the chocolate shavings).  I used my hand mixer to mix the ingredients together--perhaps I incorporated too much air as I thought the finished product was rather light.  At any rate, it is very good and was a hit in my household. I'll use it again!

Made the recipe (almost) as-is for the Black Magic Cake recipe. Was an excellent combination that wasn't too sweet. I only ended up using 1/2 cup of fudge topping though, worried of it overtaking the frosting flavor. Ended up adding a noticeable but subtle taste and was perfect, wouldn't change a thing else! (Had just enough to liberally frost 2 8-inch layers)

This frosting was so good and it paired very well with the black magic cake (so good)! I highly recommend this frosting. However, be warned this frosting is addicting; you will not be able to stop eating it.

This was simply delicious! Always read the reviews before trying something new on All Recipes and so was nervous about the hot fudge. Even more nervous when I taste-tested after mixing -- hot fudge seemed to dominate. But I did as reviewers suggested and made and frosted my cake in advance and kept in the fridge until about an hour before serving. The next day ... delicious. Two days later ... heavenly! Not too sweet and not "waxy" like store-bought. Thank you!!

I made this with two changes.  I used all butter, instead of using any shortening, for a total of 3/4 cup of butter (softened).   I used 1 Tbsp. of heavy cream. I used Smuckers Fudge Topping,  11.5 oz   This frosting was wonderful. Just the right consistency for spreading on a two 9-inch  layer cake.

This is very tasty, however, it is best suited for a sheet cake, the icing is similar in texture to creamy chocolate icing that you purchase in a can.   Not stiff enough to make borders etc..

Will try the suggestion of 2/3 c. Nutella instead of the fudge topping next time.

I had some ganache leftover from failed cream puff attempts which stood in for the fudge sauce. Other than that, I made it as advertised. It went on the cake very easily and had a wonderful texture. And, it's a cinch to make. 

Unlike most frostings, it isn't cloyingly sweet. After frosting the cake, I put it in the refrigerator and it hardened, as expected. The taste is good but for me, not orgasmic. But, the spouse liked it and that's always a plus. 

If  I made it again (I sure will as it's better than that canned junk) I'd use a flavored extract and likely use more. There was plenty of product to frost four layers of cake with approximately six leftover ounces, soon to be spooned into the mouths of pleasure seeking family members.  This is a good, solid recipe. 

I did make it again and used cream instead of milk; and twice the vanilla extract as well as fudge sauce instead of ganache. It deserves the five stars. It's my husband's birthday and well...he just couldn't stop licking the bowl.

Made it again and doubled it for a five layered cake. Same issue; my hubby couldn't stop...Need either a new Hubby or more people to eat cake.

Creamy and chocolatey deliciousness! I even used less of the hot fudge because I was afraid the icing would be to soft and it still has a great chocolate flavor. This . Was my first attempt making icing from scratch and I will never go back to store bought again.

This is probably one of my most favorite frosting recipes I have found. I did not have shortening or proper fudge so instead of shortening I just used more butter and instead of fudge i used a baker's brand thing of chocolates that are melted into syrup and it turned out great.

I made this for a layered cake filling and as crumb coat under fondant.  So disappointed.  Tastes great but it is way too soft.  I doubled it, used no milk,  and  used Smuckers and Hershey's. It would be good on brownies but not good for my purposes.

I didn't have shortening so I used more butter, and I threw in the whole jar of fudge. The frosting tends to be very slouchy when room temperature, perhaps the shortning gives it more stiffness, but it is absolutely delicious. I make this one all the time and get so many requests for the recipe. People tell me they don't like frosting and I say then taste a tiny bit, and then they ask for double. Not overly sweet, and very creamy.

Made it exactly as written and I found this to be a very delicious and creamy frosting! Also, I was able to pipe some very pretty rosettes with it. I wouldn't trust it to hold any traditional piped roses or anything that needs a stiff frosting but it was perfect for what I was doing with it.

Yummy! I love the consistency of this frosting, and it is not overly sweet. I did not have the fudge so I added a little more of the cocoa(which worked out). I also added a tablespoon of strong coffee and I used heavy cream instead of milk. I may use unsalted butter next time, although I like the hint of salt with chocolate.

This recipe is amazing! Used it on white cake with a vanilla filling. I doubled the recipe and had enough for the 8" layer cake and for a 6" cake.

It is pretty good but the shortening made the texture and flavor off just a bit. If I were to make it again I would substitute the shortening for butter.

I think that this recipe is absolutely amazing! It's sweet and also a a little bittersweet too! I didn't have shortening, so I used vegetable oil instead, and it turned out great!

What's not to like? I made no alterations. It was hot so the frosting melted a bit - next time (and there will be one), I'll put it in the refrigerator as suggested by others.

I used Smucker's hot fudge topping.  There was about 3/4 C. In the jar but it seems like that was plenty.  The frosting is incredibly smooth and creamy, and has a wonderful chocolate taste.  I enjoyed the consistency but I think some may want to stiffen it up a bit more with 1/4-1/2 C. more powdered sugar.

I really like this recipe but I made some changes as my husband and I despised the flavor of the jarred hot fudge topping. I added 1.5 cups of cocoa powder and 2.5 cups of powdered sugar. Used this on a chocolate cake recipe, placed fresh halved raspberries in between the cake layers and on the top and lightly sprinkled sifted cocoa powder on top. My foodie husband and friends said they would have paid good money at a five star restaurant for a slice of my cake and icing.

This recipe was super easy and got great reviews from all who had my cupcakes for a baby shower.  I didn't particularly like it but everyone else did so that's good enough for me.  I used Smuckers chocolate fudge.  I will use this recipe again.

This chocolate fudge frosting is to die for!  I did use Hershey's Special Dark hot fudge topping to get that deep rich dark color.  I have to warn you, don't like the bowl...it's addictive!

This is hands down my favorite frosting recipe. Some times I omit the cocoa powder and just make a vanilla frosting and that too is delicious. I don't think I'll ever try another frosting recipe. This one is perfect on so many levels! For my daughters' birthday and used different food coloring to create a colorful swirl.

Fab! Has body, very easy to frost with and stayed where I put it without dripping or "deflating". I used unsalted butter plus a little more cocoa powder - the dark kind (Ghiradelli). I hate it when things look but don't taste like chocolate! This for sure tasted like chocolate. Next time I"ll try adding some contreau ;)

Two stars for flavor, but turned out too runny. My only substitution was I used all butter as others had suggested. I don't think I'll use this recipe again.

The taste is amazing!!! But it was thinner then I hoped for....I havn't frosted my cupcakes yet...I wanted fluffy icing though, which this doesn't seem to be. Had it been fluffier I would have given 5 stars because it does taste yummy!!

Excellent frosting. However, the type of fudge you use is everything. Your frosting will taste like the fudge you use. If you want a store bought frosting flavor, use an off brand hot fudge topping.

This is a very easy frosting recipe. I skipped using the shortening and used all butter. I made this for my son's birthday cake and he and all loved it(my son does not really like a lot of sweets so...). It is so easy to work with,very smooth as others have said. It is definitely worth a try. I think the chocolate flavor is outstanding. I used Smuckers New dark chocolate ice cream topping. I can only guess the outcome might even be better if you made homemade hot fudge sauce. A keeper

My wife went crazy after tasting this. And my two small boys loved it. This will be the first icing I consider whenever I make a cake. I made a pirate ship for my youngest and I needed a dark icing. The taste is amazing.

Excellent frosting. I have made a chocolate frosting in the past but the hot fudge topping gives an extra richness and flavor.  Present recipe is not enough for a cake with two layers.

My son chose this recipe without looking at the ingredients needed.  We did not use the hot fudge topping or the milk.  I'm not a huge fan of chocolate frosting and when I do, I like the milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate.  In the future, for my own personal tastes, I would decrease the amount of cocoa.  Aside from my own personal tastes it was great.

Baked my first homemade cake and chose this frosting.  Great recipe!  Very light and creamy, not the deep dark chocolate flavor that can sometimes be overpowering.  Very easy to spread and entirely delicious. I paired it with Yellow Clooney Cake by Alicia (made 150% frosting for this recipe).  I haven't tried the cake yet but was eating the frosting likeit was pudding. Can't wait to cut a slice!

Made this as a double whammy chocolate for my granddaughter's basketball team. It was her birthday.  The girls loved it! Said it was to die for!  I personally don't like chocolate so I couldn't judge.  But, I was asked by a few girls to be their new grandma!!!  Lol!  One of the girls called it chocolate squared!  Cupcake and frosting!

I had to add a little more milk to make it the right consistency. I thought it was good.  A few people thought it was to sweet.

I used this recipe on Mexican chocolate cake from allrecipes. I omitted fudge sauce and added 1tsp cinnamon and pinch of cayenne pepper. Very creamy with a fudge like consistency.. Everyone loved it at the family reunion!!

Yes, thank you! At last I have made chocolate frosting that my picky son ("I prefer canned frosting") really loved, along with everyone else.  I used one recipe for a layer cake and it was just plenty, enough for some spoon licking.  I bought Smucker's after reading some other ratings, and, as I was making it, realized I had bought Smuckers' Chocolate Fudge Topping, but it didn't say "HOT fudge topping." At any rate, no worries, it came out delicious.  Thank you for the "keeper" recipe.

Simple, and tastes good. I don't usually like frosting but this time I actually ate it with the cake. Would definitely use this again whenever in need of chocolate frosting.

YUMMOLICIOUS!!  I tried this recipe twice - once following the recipe as above, and once with some modifications.  I loved the recipe both times, but the modifications definitely won!!  Modifications:  3/4 cup butter (room temp) and NO shortenting.  Replaced the milk with heavy cream - I added incrementally until I got the desired texture.  About 1/4 - 1/2 cup.  So smooth and delicious.  I also made the frosting a day or two prior to serving - per the recommendation of another reviewer.  I tasted it right after making and then again when it was served...definitely recommend making in advance - there was a difference in the taste...better if that's even possible.

Very good recipe and very easy to make. This is also very easy to modify using dark chocolate or adding a little espresso powder for a more intense flavor. I've passed this along to several people already.

This was awesome! My husband has asked me to cover everything we eat with it from now on. I 1 1/2 the recipe and it was the perfect amount to frost a double layer 9 inch round cake. So yummy!

This is just about the best fudge frosting I've ever tasted.  Mine turned out a bit runny, which I solved by adding more powdered sugar and shortening.  I added these to taste until it was both the right texture and the right flavor.  I think the runniness was because of the  hot fudge topping.  I'll be using this recipe from now on whenever I need fudge frosting for cookies or cake.

I tried this recipe and it is awesome!  I didn't use as much fudge topping and I used mostly butter with a little shortening and it is really good.  If your icing is too thin you need to add more powered sugar!  I have seen so many people saying the icing was running off the sides??  If you notice it is too think you need to add more sugar!  If it is too thick add a few drops of milk until it thins it enough to spread.  My came out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was so excited to find a chocolate buttercream frosting with such rave reviews, but I've to say, I really don't like it. I'm not sure what it is but to me, it almost tastes like a liquor.  Much too grown up for the children's cake I used it for. 

The recipe is a great texture and consistency, and the color is beautiful but the flavor wasn't what I was looking for.  I'd say it was more a matter of personal taste than anything. 

I did however love the light chocolate mousse filling I made from this site: Chocolate Mousse Cake IV.

So awesome and simple, this was the first frosting I made in my cooking lessons. It was really easy and tasted scruptious. I even made extra and stuck it in the ice box intill I needed to use it, the results were excellent. Thanks a lot for this Recipe :)

I substituted 1/2 cup Nutella and 1/2 cup Hershey's Chocolate Syrup for the Hot Fudge, and it comes out great!  Very creamy.  Great on the Black Magic Cake from this site.

Quite good. I omitted the hot fudge (sorry) because we are out. Instead, I melted a big handful of semi-sweet morsels in bacon grease and added some 10x. I added that to the butter cream and I'm pretty stoked for the cupcakes tomorrow!

This was so good.  I followed the recipe exactly as it's written except, after reading some reviews, I added the milk by 1/2 Tablespoons just to make sure it didn't turn out too runny.  I ended up added a total of 1.5 Tbls.  One reviewer commented that this is only as good as the hot fudge that you use; I can see how this would hold true.  I used Smuckers.  This is so rich and creamy.  Very good and very easy.

Very creamy, which is great, but back off on the milk to help it be more glutenous so it sticks to the walls of the cake. Overall, easy, tasty, and not overly sweet (for me that is great and my three boys loved it too).

Frosting was very good despite using it on a very dry cake.  Will try I again on a chocolate cake.  It pipes very well and makes more than enough to frost a 2 layer 9 inch round cake.

I am chocolate lover.  I tried the frosting before I added the chocolate fudge topping and was in love.  Then I added the fudge and felt like it really took away all of the better flavors.  I would suggest leaving the fudge out altogether. It's just a taste that belongs on icecream, not on a cake.  I also used fat free half and half instead of milk and it made it more creamy.

This is a fabulous icing.  It's rich and chocolatey, and can easily be adapted depending on which type of fudge sauce you use.  I've made it twice now - one with more of a milk chocolate flavor using a homemade batch of chocolate syrup, and it was great.  Just got done with my second batch - I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder & Smucker's Special Recipe Hot Fudge Sauce - quite delicious and has a deeper, dark chocolate richness that I'm hoping will be even better tomorrow.

Wonderful frosting!  Very rich - used only half the recommended fudge topping.   I was also icing cupcakes and the consistency with the fudge mixed in is more like a pour icing so it required a LOT of extra sugar to thicken up.  However, it's just something to keep in mind because I will definitely be making this icing again.

This frosting was so creamy, light and not too rich!  My whole family loved it and will be using again.  I did use 1/8 more milk and only about 1/4 cup of Hersheys Syrup.  It came out perfect.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was the BEST chocolate frosting I have ever tasted.  It was better that store bought.  I used it for cupcakes for my son's birthday and everyone raved about them.

I tried this last night and it came out very good. My husband is diabetic so I used sugar free cake, and then sugar free Smuckers hot fudge. I also used 2TBS of whipping cream next time I will use only 1TBS. Also I wont use as much hot fudge. It was a little runny like most have stated. Other wise it was very good.

Wow.  Yummy.  I didn't have hot fudge sauce on hand, so found Priscilla Weaver's Hot Fudge Sauce recipe & made and used that.  I'm never going back to my standard one-bowl recipe!

Very good! Next time I will use heavy cream instead of milk, and probably only one tbsp. It was a little too runny. I also found the Smuckers fudge worked better than Herseys.

Best frosting ever! I made mine with nutella instead of chocolate fudge. So yummy, not super sugery and not buttery tasting. This will be the only chocolate frosting I make from now on.

YUM! I subbed butter for the shortening (as I had none) and used Nutella instead of the fudge as another reviewer suggested. I also sprinkled toffee bits on top. It was perfect and got rave reviews!

This frosting was "ok".  Definitely nothing to write home about.  To me, it tasted just like canned frosting.  I personally think they need to delete the world "buttercream" out of the title, because you can barely taste the butter after adding everything else to it. YES, it is a good frosting, but nothing spectacular, or "over-the-top".  If I would have known this ahead of time, I could've saved some VERY precious time & just used a can of milk chocolate frosting.

This is the BEST chocolate frosting I've had! I used Mrs. Richard's Hot Fudge, to die for!  I made a devil's food cake and filled the middle layer with peanut butter frosting then frosted the entire cake with this chocolate frosting. There couldn't be a better combination! DEFINATELY a keeper! Just so you know the color is not dark like in the picuture more like a light milk chocolate.

I found that 2 T. of milk was too much (the frosting slid off the cake I was decorating).  Next time, I'll stick with 1 T.

This is now my go-to chocolate frosting!  I follow the recipe to a T, but use the Hershey's special dark cocoa, which gives it an even deeper chocolate taste.  Everyone I work with love it when I make my dark chocolate cake (using the special dark cocoa) topped with this frosting.  If you are ready for a chocolate overload, get ready for this!

I made this because of its dark color shown in the photo but it didn't turn out dark. I wanted it to be the color of frosting in the can but with a homemade flavor.  I like the flavor and I will no more tomorrow after I serve it if others like the flavor. I doubled the recipe and I don't think it was necessary because it makes plenty of frosting. Thank you.

Wonderful chocolate frosting! I have used both Hershey's hot fudge and Nutella. Both are fantastic! I would really like to try it with Mrs. Richardson's fudge. Does anybody know of a national chain that carries it?

This is terrific frosting!  I adapted this recipe today for my daughters birthday cake.  I used some homemade bittersweet fudge sauce that is thinner than the store bought variety so I used it to smooth out the butter/sugar/cocoa combination rather than use the milk.  I didn't need any milk it turns out.  I added the sauce a little at a time until it was a consistancy that could be spread and piped.  I didn't need to use all the recipe required to get a deep chocolate flavor which would have required adding more sugar. I love that it didn't have that raw powdered sugar taste and wasn't grainy.  Thanks, Debra, great recipe.

Wonderfly yummy. Much better than you could ever hope to buy at a store. The only suggestion I have is slowly add the milk. Don't need entire amount. I make according to recipe and it was a bit thin. Other than that OMG, I caught myself eating the frosting out of the container. Better than chocolate pudding. Definately will use repeatedly.

YUM!!!  This is sinfully delicious!  Like many others, I used 2/3 cup of Nutella instead of hot fudge.  If you do that, though, the chocolatey taste isn't as strong, so I also added an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder and it was perfect!  I'm going to make this frosting all the time!

I just made this for the second time and it is still wonderful. I didn't have the hot fudge on hand so I used the entire 1/4 cup of milk for extra liquid.  I also added pecans this time...my son was eating it like ice cream!

Very good and chocolate not too overwhelming.  Great for piping on cake.   Goes great with "Too Much Chocolate Cake" two-layer cake and strawberry jelly for the filling.  Thank you! Will use this again.

Good frosting recipe, the addition of hot fudge is genius.  I used Mrs. Richardson's Fudge Lovers which is more of a dark chocolate than regular hot fudge.  Used with "Too Much Chocolate Cake" as did many others.

I was hoping this would be stellar b/c I was doing a "test" batch of cupcakes before a party.    I made this w/ the Too Much Chocolate cake recipe from this site. 
I usually really like chocolate frosting, but this was just not outstanding, unfortunately.  It tasted a little too much like fudge - that was really the overwhelming flavor, which is not what I look for in a fantastic frosting. 
Overall, really good, but not stellar.

This is the best chocolate frosting recipe I have ever tried. I've used it on cake and on cupcakes with great reviews. Use Mrs. Richardson's Hot Fudge--it is the best.

I made this recipe last weekend for my chocoholic daughter's baby shower. It was a hit! I am making it again today for Thanksgiving tomorrow.

Very good.  I think it needed some more sugar to stiffen it up some - mine came out a little runny. No way it would have gone through a pastry bag and tip. I used milk chocolate topping and wish I would have used the true hot fudge - but it was awesome! Used it with the "Too Much Chocolate" cake with the "Fluffy White Filling". Yummy!

Fantastic frosting, and easy to make. I have made it 3 times now and it turns out great every time. I did add a bit more sugar to small amt to use for piping it worked great.

My family loved this frosting. I think next time I will add more powdered sugar as it was a little too soft. Tasted great though the hot fudge was a great addition.

I made this frosting for a pound cake, it was good but I think that I will try other chocolate frostings. It is very easy to make but did not wow me.

My fiance is not a chocolate lover and he loved this!!  It was so good!  Used is as a filling for the 'Fudge Cake’ recipe found on this site.  It was a little too runny, but I think that’s cause I melted the hot fudge before mixing it in.  It is a keeper!!

This was so yummy!  I couldn't pipe with it so next time I will add more sugar or less milk.  I used Mrs. Richardson's hot fudge topping.  WONDERFUL milk chocolate taste!!!! This is a keeper.

The best thing about this frosting recipe is that it's not too sweet!  It's also easy and tasty.  I made two separate batches without the milk, and they were still pretty soft.  I added about 1/2 cup of sugar to each batch to stiffen.

Also, it came out much lighter in color than the photo (basket-weave cake with birds) even before adding the extra sugar.

Absolutely the best!  I've been looking for a good chocolate buttercream recipe for years and this is it!  I followed the recipe exactly and I used Sanders Milk Chocolate Fudge Topping - to die for!!!
