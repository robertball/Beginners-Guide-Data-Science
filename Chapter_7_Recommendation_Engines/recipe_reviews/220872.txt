First - these are NOT Tamales - that said, they are good cabbage rolls.  I did cut the recipe in half and did them in the crockpot.  I used one can of Rotel and was afraid there was not going to be enough 'sauce'.  I added more salsa - enough to cover the cabbage rolls.  They were perfect.    Thanks.

Because it is Mexican flavored meat mixture "wrapped" in cabbage instead of husks, it is a very imaginative name!! :)

I am very impressed with this recipe. Thank you for sharing it. I did modify the spices only to work with what I have on hand and it worked out wonderfully. This is an easy prep item with a great result!

This recipe turned out amazing. It is so healthy and yummy which are two of my criteria for food. It is also easy. I think next time I am going to add some ground sausage to add more dimension to the flavor. I will repost when I do to re-review.

I made this for myself and froze the rest for later but I cooked only 4 cabbage leaves and I did it in the slow cooker for 2 1/2 hours. I doubled the tomato sauce instead of the tomatoes with chilies. I also did not have the chili powder so I doubled the garlic and used 2 Tbsp of Taco seasoning in its place and the flavor was fantastic! You will need extra sauce for the reheated rolls if you freeze any as they do absorb the sauce.

These were very good. I did make a few adjustments because I didn't have all the ingredients. They were magnificent nonetheless. :) Here's what I did:

I cut the recipe in half and cooked the 4 cabbage rolls in the slowcooker for 2.5 hours instead. I did not have chili powder at all, so I just used about 2 T of taco seasoning. I doubled the garlic, did not have diced tomatoes with chiles, but used about half a 16 oz can of tomato sauce in the meat mixture and about half of what was left on top of the rolls. I had a few cherry tomatoes that were on their way out, so I chopped them up and sprinkled them on top along with half of a small can of green chiles. My boyfriend is quite the eater, but he was stuffed after just one roll/tamale for dinner. As far as the problem some have had with cabbage leaf size, it's possible that US cabbages are so large where some of us are that it's not an issue at all, as it wasn't for me. Just try the largest cabbage you can find.

Please don't call these tamales. Call them tex/mex cabbage rolls, but having no Masa in addition to not being steamed take them completely  out of the tamale category

Absolutely the BEST cabbage rolls I've ever tasted, and several of my friends agree!!  These were easy to make and wonderful to eat!   I am eager to make them again!!  I chose this recipe to use when a friend offered to help me learn how to use my electric pressure cooker, and it proved to be a great choice.  I read online that Mexican chili powder is hotter than regular chili powder and more flavorful.  I was hesitant about it being too hot, so I reduced it from 3 tsp to 2 slightly rounded tsp, and everyone who tasted them agreed that it was a perfect amount.  Very good flavor but not "hot."  Mine were not the least bit dry as other reviewers commented.  I should mention that my pressure cooker had a "Meat" setting which would only allow me to set it for up to 25 min max.  That turned out to be perfect; more time was not needed.  Don't know, but perhaps 30 min was too long for whatever method of cooking those other reviewers used.  (I would not classify these as a Mexican dish nor as tamales.  Can't imagine how those terms ended up in the title.  They sure are tasty, though!!)

Wonderful recipe, I put the whole head of cabbage in the boiling pot of water for easier removal of the leaves. Next time I will add some ground pork and fresh chiles as I found them slightly dry and a little mild. This recipe will be added to my favourites, thanks

Good basic recipe.  I doubled the filling and cooked the 1st batch in the crockpot.  I found them to be slightly dry and bland.  For the 2nd batch, I added a 15 oz jar of salsa to the tomato/diced pepper mixture.  Much better.

Amazing... Baked these in the oven with foil. The only change I made was using saffron rice. Turned out great.

When covering dishes with any tomato or tomato based sauce
cover pan with a film wrap then foil.  Tomato based sauces will eat through the aluminum foil and ruin your product.  The film cover can be left on with the foil during the baking process without any issues. Be sure to cover the film with the foil.  I've learned the hard way.

I did not make this, but I do believe that an hour in a pressure cooker is too long.  I can cook an arm roast in one hour fifteen minutes.  I think 20 to 25 minutes will cook the meat to 170 to 180 degrees.  If not, it won't take long to  bring the cooker up to pressure, and then I wouldn't do for longer than ten minutes - or adjust according to internal temperature of cabbage roll.

I very much enjoy this spicier take on cabbage rolls.  My mom used to make them with lamb, but beef is a better option in my opinion.  Milder peppers can be chosen if one does not enjoy "hot" foods and the flavor will still be great.  Thank you for sharing!

My cabbage leaves did not cooperate with this dish so I ended ups with double the amount of wraps. Turned out more like a casserole but was still delishious.

What size cabbage leaves are being used!? No way could I fit all that filling into 8 leaves. But it is so good, I will be going out to buy a bigger cabbage to fit the rest in. Next time I will cut the filling in half. Veggie "ground beef" tastes really good in it.

Nice recipe; simple and fun to make with ingredients I had on hand. I did use lean ground turkey for the meat and Powdered garlic instead of cloves. Also when it was almost done baking, I poured a little more tomato sauce over the top of the cabbage rolls. Instead of crockpot or pressure cooker, I baked at 325 for two hours total and it turned out perfect. The taste is nice not too spicy but just enough to give it a good flavor. Will make again.

Solid. It's a Mexican inspired cabbage roll.  Easy to put together and I appreciated being able to make it in my Instant Pot.

With that being said, I did find it a bit bland.  I used a mix of New Mexican Chile Powder + Ancho but I really wish I would have kicked it up with additional seasonings in the mixture.  As it is I did add about 1.5 tsp of coarse kosher salt to the mix and it was still on the bland side.

The sauce was just canned tomatoes. If making again, I'd adapt to make more of a true sauce - I thought they were a bit dry.  I randomly had some taco/nacho cheese blend so ended up melting a little bit of that on top to give it some additional flavor.

My 18 month old devoured her roll though so that's a plus. DH & I agreed it was fine for dinner but nothing fantastic.  It just needs to be kicked up.

This tasted great and my co-workers loved it! Not kid friendly due to how much tomato items are involved. Way more mixture left than I had in cabbage.

I make these using tomato soup diluted for normal soup use. I always have to make more sauce since my family uses the sauce over mashed potatoes. I also don’t use the green chilies. They like it better that way.

Pretty tasty, altho I had to sub some ingredients still turned out ok. First,  I used ground turkey (not the best idea, all I had) instead of ground beef. I believe beef or sausage would have been much better. Secondly, I used tomato paste instead of sauce, had to water it down.

Fyi, I used my pressure cooker (the old school one w/the ball on top) to make, cooking took 20mins.

Im sure this could have been a 4 star if I followed to a tee. It was very good non the less.

UPDATE, the dish tasted much better the following day..

So easy, so good!  Blanching the cabbage is no big deal, and other than that, these are very simple to make.  I was not buying products with English measurements, so had to approximate.  They still came out great!  I used a soy ground meat replacement, and the filling was flavorful enough to carry it off.  Using only 8 big leaves, each roll was very large.  I would use more, smaller leaves next time for ease of serving.  They held together well, even that full.  I made them in the crock pot.  Will definitely make them again.

Lots of work & was way to spicy for my family, even though I cut back on chili powder. I think the tomatoes with green chilies did us in. I will go back to my tried & true next time.

I made exactly as directed and my family was very pleased with them.  Our personal preference is for a little more spice, but we fixed that after they were made.  All in all, an easy recipe with delicious results.  Thank you!

It came out good. Needed more seasonings. Wanted to be careful not adding too much. I ended up adding shredded cheese at the end. Pretty awesome meal

Absolutely LOVED this dish. Made it for hubby and neighbors. I didn’t have NM chili powder so I used 2 tsp red chili powder and 1tsp chipotle chili powder. Evidentially my cabbage leaves were small because it made a lot more than 8 (or I didn’t make them as fat). I think I liked it being more tamale sized. We are still having them for leftovers and they are just as good if not better.  We also top with our fav salsas, avocados, etc. Thanks for a great recipe with good tips for options of how to cook and/ or prep tips and freezing tips!!

Easy to make recipe but had mixed reactions from the family.  I liked it but you do have to like cabbage.

These are pretty decent "cabbage rolls". Adding chili powder to this does not make it a Tamale in any way. Making Tamales  has been a honored tradition  in our family for over 50 years.

These aren't anything German. Cabbage rolls, formally known as Halupkie, are Ukranian. I tried the Mexican style, but didn't care for them. I will stick to the original.

For those of us who don't want to drag out the slow cooker, you can also make this in an oven in a covered pan, just make sure the tamales are covered in enough liquid to create the steam needed to not burn the cabbage

How much ground beef goes in it.  I see an ad for a grocery store but no quantity.  Sounds good though.

Delicious meal! It was shockingly a comfort food, so good. I made it in my pressure cooker and it'll definitely be a staple in our house!
