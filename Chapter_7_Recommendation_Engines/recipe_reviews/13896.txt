This recipe was fantastic!  I was skeptical, since I have had dubious success with tofu in the past, but this turned out perfectly.  After reading the reveiws, I sliced the tofu to 1/4 inch thickness, pressed the slices with paper towel to absorb moisture, froze for 30 minutes on a cookie sheet, then removed and dipped in flour, then egg, then crumbs.  Rather than frying, I baked the tofu at 350 degrees for 15 minutes each side, on a cookie sheet rubbed lightly with olive oil.  The pieces did not break, and came out crispy and delicious.  I then layered the ingredients as follows in a large loaf pan: tomato sauce, half the tofu, half the cheese, repeat. For those who are interested in macronutrient composition, this came out as 30% protein, 30% carbs, 40% fat (with low fat cheese and baked, not fried). It was perfect, and, yes, my carnivorous boyfriend loved it.  Would be great for guests, as the breading and assembly can be done ahead.

I have made this recipe twice, the first time with no changes, and it was very good. The second time, I made the following revisions and it was even better:1) DO NOT put tofu in water. 2) Season dry  sliced tofu with salt & pepper. 3) Dredge slices in white flour seasoned with salt & pepper. 3) Dredge tofu in beaten egg seasoned with salt & pepper until completely coated. 4) Dip in seasoned bread crumbs. 5) Cook tofu according to recipe instruction.  6) Spread a small layer of tomato sauce in bottom of lightly oiled baking dish. 7) Place tofu in dish, cover with tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheeses, and bake.   Sprinkle with chopped parsley when you take it out of the oven.

I love this recipe... I'm eating leftovers for lunch right now.  Some very important changes:  After slicing the tofu, press the slices gently between paper towels to drain the water.  Then BAKE IT on a nonstick sheet until it begins to turn golden. You will thank me. Yes, I bake it before frying it... the baking is not instead of frying.  the extra step just makes the texture SO much better... I cook w/ tofu in this way alot. Also, like other reviewers said, I dip the tofu slices in egg before breading and have NO issues w/ the breading coming off while frying.

For a more chicken like texture, make sure you choose the firmest tofu you can find. Cut the tofu into the size and thickness you preffer.
Pat the tofu dry (kitchen paper towel). Then place them in freezer bags or plastic wrap and place them in the freezer overnight or at least for 8 hours. when ready to use place the tofu in a deep bowl and pour boiling water over the tofu. Pat dry tofu the coat it with the breadcrumbs. If the breadcrmbs don't stick spray the tofu cuts with cooking spray. I baked mine in the oven on a cookie tray sprayed with cooking oil. The texture after doing this process makes it a million times better. Good luck.

If you are not used to using extra firm tofu.  Make sure that you freeze the entire "block", whether packed in water or not.  Take out and defrost on counter for three (3) hrs or microwave for 3 min..it'll be like a sponge texture.  Squeeze excess moister out and then, use just like you would meat.  Much heartier consistency and meat eaters will be suprised.

This was fantastic, my husband knew there was tofu in the recipe, but was unable to find it between "the chicken" pieces! I prefer to coat the tofu with a beaten egg then with the crumbs and to cook it in the oven instead of in the pan (around 20 minutes at 375F. This way it is crispier.

This was super easy and quick to make, and very tasty!  To get good bread crumb coating on the tofu without using eggs or oil, I first pressed the tofu into the breadcrumbs, then sprayed each piece all over with cooking spray and then pressed the tofu into the crumb mixture again--this worked well.  I also fried the tofu with cooking spray.  The result was a delicious, non-greasy dish!  I would definitely make this again!

This is the BEST tofu recipe I have ever made!!  I have cooked it for guests who said they hated tofu....but after they tasted it, they changed their minds.
This has become my husbands favorite meal!
I made this recipe a little lighter by using cooking spray instead of the oil, and baking it instead of frying it.  It worked out really well! And took away a lot of the fat.

This was excellent.  My fiance and I are not big tofu eaters, but thought we'd try this.  I used a jar of pasta sauce and I followed some of the other suggestions: I blotted the water off the tofu then I froze the tofu for 30 minutes, then I cut it into 1/4 inch slices, I dipped it in flour then egg then the crumbs and I baked it on its own for 12 minutes on each side before putting it in the casserole.  I served it over spaghetti.  When I told my fianc√© what we were having for dinner, he turned his nose up but it was so good that he was picking at the leftovers right after we ate!

Just great! I sometimes jazz it up a little by using fancy spaghetti sauces instead of plain tomato sauce.  I also like use 2% cottage cheese instead of mozza, just to reduce the fat a little.  Tastes just as good IMHO, and keeps the dish moist too!  Many thanks to whomever suggested baking the tofu instead of frying -- works REALLY well, and it's less work-intensive for the chef to boot.

Thank you reviewers for the tofu advice.  I drained, cut my firm block into 6 slabs, threw in freezer for 30 minutes, dredged in flour, then egg, then crumb mixture (had to almost double that) and cooked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes on each side in a pam-sprayed pan.  I've cooked a lot with tofu but it has never been this firm.  Wow!  And the dish itself was excellent.  A true keeper!

WOW. One of the best dishes ever. I followed another user's suggestion, cut the tofu into 1/4 inch thickness, blotted with paper towel and froze for 15 minutes. Prepared tofu as follows: 1. dip in flour 2. dip in beaten egg 3. cover with Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. Did not fry but baked tofu at 375 for fifteen minutes on each side. Used 12 oz. tomato sauce instead of 8 and added spinach. Assembled in a loaf pan as follows: 4 oz. tomato sauce mixture, 1/2 baked tofu, 2 oz. cheese. Next layer: 4 oz. sauce, second half of baked tofu, 1 cup baby spinach, last 4 oz. of sauce, 2 oz. of cheese and 3 Tbs. parmesan. Baked as directed. Omg this was amazing! I will make it again and again.

Wonderful recipe ~ kids & husband devour it every time! For the shear ease of already being seasoned, I use Italian bread crumbs and our favorite tomato sauce. I also bake the slices rather than frying; 350degrees, 15 min. on each side. I must highly recommend freezing the tofu slices; it really does make a difference. Freeze overnight if able, but 30 min. works too.

AWESOME MADE CHANGES too: I have had to make 4 of these over the Holidays!   Even the non vegetarians loved it!!  Some guests thought it was chicken or eggplant.  After reading all reviews..I Sliced the Tofu about 1/4 inch wide.  I then squeezed the slices in between paper towels to get all the moisture out.  I froze the slices for 30 min, not much longer or they can get freezer burn.  As the slices were in the freezer..  I got 3 larger and deeper  salad bowls out of cupboard..the kind that are great for making French toast...nice to dredge in.  I combined the bread crumbs, 2 TBLS of Parm cheese, 1 teas of the oregano , some salt and peeper in one of the bowls.  The other bowl I beat 2 or 3 large eggs in, and the 3rd bowl, I put about 1 cup of flour.  I then arranged them in order for dredging the  tofu.  Take each piece of tofu through flour then egg then crumb mixture. Make sure you give the tofu adequate dredging time...then BAKE on a cookie sheet that I had geased with olive oil,in a 350 degree oven for 15 min on each side  While they were in oven, I combined almost 3/4 jar Prego, basil, oregano, garlic. I used 8x8 glass dish  ...sauce then tofu, then mozzarella, then sprinkled some parmesan ..repeat  then bake at 350 for about 20 30 min  Raving reviews expected... YOU can add more stuff too, like diced tomatoes, hot sauce jalepenos  use your imagination.   I am thankful to all the reviews that I combined to make this an ABSOLUTE SUCCESS

Very Good! I read the other reviews and flour/egg/breadcrumbed and baked in the oven. I made fresh breadcrumbs out of rye bread and it really added to the flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

This is hands down, the best recipe I've ever used on this site.  I made the following changes based on other reviews:  Sliced up tofu into 1/4" slices, patted dry, and froze overnight.  The next day, dethaw by pouring hot water over and then patting dry again.  Coated tofu in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs.  Baked the tofu at 350 for 15 minutes per side (lightly oiled pan), then finally sauteed them until golden brown.  Stuck them back in a pan, covered with cheese & sauce, baked until the cheese melted & then served over pasta.  Absolutely FABULOUS, you will swear you are eating veal!

Those that rated this dish low had to have messed up the recipe! They should try it again, because this was delicious! I bought extra firm tofu and put it in the freezer for a half an hour before using it to "firm" it up. I also followed other's advice and used a flour, then egg, then breadcrumb coating. I baked it at 350 degrees, on a cookie sheet coated with PAM, for about 20 minutes and then did the layering and further baking. I used my own homemade marinara and doubled the amount of mozzarella (low fat). My husband "The Meat Eater" couldn't believe he was eating tofu!

I follow Torontois' suggestions and freeze, flour, egg, bread and then bake, but bake all the slices.  Then I refrigerate and take out the slices that I need, add tomato sauce, and then mozzarella and parmesan cheese and heat in the toaster oven until warm.  SO quick and good!

This recipe was awesome. My husband says that it's his new favorite way to eat tofu. I do have one suggestion, though. Put the breading in a gallon-sized ziploc bag. You may need a little more than the recipe requires. Then, dip the tofu into eggbeaters then place it in the bag with the breading. You can put about half of the tofu in the bag at a time. Then, close the bag and gently roll the bag to get all of the tofu completly covered in the breading. The breading will stay on much better through this technique.

I enjoyed this very much!!! I used extra firm tofu and dried it on paper towels. I sparyed it with pan spray and rolled it in the bread crumbs. I only got a light crust and it wasn't very crispy but it was chewy and very good. It's nice to be able to add a new tofu recipe to my menu, and I'm just learning to expand my use of it. Thank you.

Great recipe. I want to add that I noticed everyone recommended freezing the tofu first, then going through the trouble of squeezing water between paper towels, bla bla, baking first, then frying, then baking again...um...not necessary. As long as you have extra firm tofu, simply drain the water from the packaging, dip the tofu in the bread crumbs (and you DO NOT need to dip in eggs, the crumbs stick just fine without it), then bake it. You don't even have to fry it. That simple.

After making this recipe quite a few times, I think I've perfected it.  Always freeze tofu before you use it!  I use extra firm tofu, thaw it and squeeze out all the extra water.  Slice it up, then soak them in vegetable broth for a bit.  I then squeeze them out a little, dip them in flour, then egg, then the crumb/cheese mixture.  I then bake them at 350, 15 minutes each side.  I add spinach in my layers, otherwise the rest stays the same.  This is soooo delicious!

WOW!!!!!  I have been a vegetarian eating tofu for 15 years, and this is the most incredible way I have ever prepared it!!!  My meat eating, non tofu loving, husband, was surprised that he also loved it, and couldn't wait to have it as leftovers for lunches...!!!! I am doing the happy dance right now, and I really have to stop myself from eating it all!  I followed the recommendations to slice the extra firm tofu (I did 1/4"), freeze it for 30, thaw for 15, flour, egg, and bread (I used 2 pieces of bread processed into crumbs, and added a bunch of italian seasoning, because I didn't have any oregano), baked on a cookie sheet at 375 for 15min on each side, and drizzled olive oil over each side).  I can't say enough about this recipe!!!!  It's not often that vegetarian recipes are a hit with both of us:)  Success!!!

I'm a vegetarian, and I love tofu and use it weekly, but I didn't really care for this. The texture and the flavor were both lacking. I won't be making these again, sorry.

Fantastic and yet simple. My wife has been willing to try Tofu for the first time in her life and this recipe has convinced her that Tofu is "better" than chicken. This Tofu Parmigiana has great flavor!

This was even better the next day! I obeyed the recipe =), except for not frying the tofu. I pressed out the water under a weight and between kitchen towels, sliced and froze it for an hour. Then we breaded it (egg seemed to work better than water) and baked it on a well-oiled tray at 450 F, bottom rack, for about 10 minutes per side. We put our doubled recipe in a 9 x 13 pan and layered it. "TOFU!" The kids announced to their dad. "It was rated highly," I explained as he took his first bite. He swallowed and said, "I can see why!"

I love this recipe and I make it regularly! It is always tricky for me to keep the tofu from sticking to the pan (I only use stainless steel and don't have non-stick pans). The trick is to really press the water out of the tofu by wrapping the block in paper towels and putting a weight on it. I also have more success when I use my wok. Delicious recipe, thanks!

This is a really delicious dish.  Instead of dipping the tofu in water, I dipped it in a beaten egg and dipped it in the breadcrumb mixture and then I fried it in a shallow skillet with a bit of olive oil.  After frying, I laid the tofu pieces in a 9x13 pan, and then topped with spaggetti sauce and shredded cheese and then baked in the oven.  It was delicious.

This is a fantastic recipe.  If you like eggplant parmigiana you won't even notice the difference when you use tofu.  A lot of people complained that the bread crumbs didn's stick to the tofu....instead of soaking the tofu in water I dipped it in a beaten egg and it worked out perfectly...use eggbeaters if you don't eat dairy products!!!

This was really delicious.  I followed a couple of reviewer's advice and did the following.  First drained, patted dried, and froze the tofu for about 3 hours.  Took it out of the freezer and let it thaw for a couple of hours on some paper towel to drain it.  Sliced into 3 pieces, then baked at 350 for about 18 minutes (make sure to spray your baking sheet with non-stick spray, or use parchment paper...I did neither and the tofu almost stuck to the tray.)  Remove tofu from oven, let cool briefly, then dredge in four, egg, then breadcrumb mixture.  Then I followed the recipe's instructions to pan fry and then bake it.  My husband, who is primarily a carnivore and who I'm trying to get to eat meat-free once a week, loved it.  Will definitely be making again.

This was really good! To make it healthier I baked the tofu instead of frying it. After I dipped the tofu in the breadcrumb mixture I baked them 15 min. on each side at 350 F. It still turned out great!

A big hit with my family.  I used some of Morningstar Farms' herby fake chicken things (they were supposed to be like grilled chicken).  It turned out really tasty and good.

Super recipe! This has convinced a lot of my family to love tofu. I have altered the recipe several times.  I hate soaking, breading, etc...too much time. I drain, pat dry then slice the tofu with a cheese slicer, put it on a lightly oiled baking stone and sprinkle with a spice mixture, Penzeys' Mitchell Street Steak Seasoning is fantastic. Bake in a moderate oven until the tofu starts to turn golden then turn, sprinkle and bake on the other side.  You can then use it in this recipe, refrigerate or freeze for later use. Try different cheeses, a touch of asiago is great. Thanks for this recipe, it really gave me confidence to cook with tofu!

I love having vegetarian night at least twice a week and this recipe ensures that my meat-loving husband looks forward those night just as much as me. I double my recipe and add tomato slices and chopped basil in between layers. Also I make garlic spaghetti and mixed green salad to go along with.
Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jill!

One helpful tip: Freeze the tofu instead of just leaving it in the fridge. Defrost when ready to use. This helps make the tofu more 'meaty.' I was very happy with recipe and my family loved it! Served pasta and garlic bread on the side. Awesome!

I wanted to like this, but just couldn't.  I think this is one of those things that you just have to make quite a few times and perfect it - I would definitely read through some of the most helpful reviews before you make it because some of the reviews are very different from what the original recipe says.  You can definitely tell it's tofu...and NOT eggplant or veal.  I usually like tofu but I did not care for this.  =(

This is wonderful recipe.  My family loved it.  I froze tofu a few hours before I was prepared to make the recipe. I added fresh basil to the sauce and fried tofu 5 minutes on each side to get crispy.    It taste just like eggplant parm.  Definetly a keeper!!

This is a GREAT recipe!! My family and I really enjoyed this alot, my husband was even talking about this dish the next day!!

Only adjustments I made was, I doubled the recipe, dipped the tofu in egg, and used Italian Panko Crumbs (gives a nice crunchy coating), 2 teaspoons of Kosher Salt, Extra Firm Tofu, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, and I used 2 - 18 oz. jars of 'Giorgio Baldi' Tomato & Basil Marinara Sauce (My Favorite)

I will for sure make this again!! Thanks for the recipe!!

I loved this tofu parmigiana recipe served over linguini with tomato sauce.  The only thing I did differently was to just melt the cheese right on top of the tofu slabs in the pan once they were cooked, instead of putting them in the oven in a casserole dish with sauce.  Then I just spooned sauce over them when I served them.

One more vote for "surprisingly delicious." Since I'm used to doing this with other tofu recipes, before cooking I wrapped the tofu block in paper towels and put a heavy pot on top in order to press out as much moisture as possible. I think this helps ensure a firm, "meaty" texture, which works well for this recipe in particular.

I liked this, however, I needed an egg mix to make the bread crumbs really stick/stay. I also used super firm tofu and I'm glad I did... I don't think I would have cared to much for the texture otherwise. I'm a vegetarian and I eat tofu all the time but to bread and pan fry regular firm, it almost tastes like a soft filling. Definitely use extra or super firm.

I  make this a lot for our vegetarian family (including 2 teenagers).  I top it with a lasagne-like ricotta topping (ricotta mixed with egg, salt and some herbs).  I serve it with a side of angel hair pasta, sauteed in garlic and grapeseed oil.

This was delicious.  I made it according to the recipe, but to help the bread crumbs stick, I dredged the tofu slices in flour and dipped them in a beaten egg before pressing them in to the bread crumb coating.  Even my carnivore husband who HATES tofu, loved this (and didn't know it was tofu until I told him). I will definitely make this again.

My hubby and I enjoyed this, but my 10 year old didn't like it as much.  You do need to dry the pieces of tofu with a paper towel.  I took the advice of others and baked mine at 350 for about 15 minutes on each side first, then dredged in flour, egg, and breadcrumb mixture, then fried it.  After that I layered sauce, tofu, cheese, repeat and baked it in a bread pan so there were more layers.  I probably used 1 cup of cheese rather than 4 ounces.  I'd make again for sure for the adults!

This was a GREAT recipe!!  I ended up cutting the tofu a little thinner, so using a smaller casserole dish I layered the tofu with the sauce and then topped with the remaining sauce and cheeses.  We will be adding this to our rotation of weeknight dishes.

I have never tried the frozen method to cooking with tofu but have been cooking with it for several years now.  I buy extra firm tofu and let it sit for 15 - 25 minutes on a plate to drain the water, the texture has always come out great for me this way.  Then I dip the tofu in egg before the bread crumbs to get the breading to stick better.  If your a tofu lover you will enjoy this dish!

So so good!

I followed another users comments in prepping & cooking the tofu: I froze the slices first, then coated in flour, dipped in egg and then covered in the bread crumb mixture of crumbs, parmesan and oregano.  Then baked it at 350 for 15 minutes on each side.   Then I used a loaf pan, layering sauce, tofu, cheese 3 times.  I doubled up the bread crumb mixture and the sauce.  It was so so so good!

I made this last night with a few changes and it was so good! Added some sauted mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, lots of spinach and olives to the tomato sauce and also more garlic.
My husband, who is not a tofu fan, loved it and took the leftovers to work today! thanks for the recipe!

This is a really great recipe.  Def freeze the tofu as suggested by other reviewers, it makes a remarkable difference. Dont forget about it though, I did and left it for about a week and it wasn't very nice.  But apart from my own mistake this is a fantastic way to eat tofu, even for those tofu-haters.  Great recipe thanks for submitting.

This was a great dish.  It was easy to make for the most part, though the tofu was a little difficult to work with and fell apart during the breading process.  I followed most reviewers' advice and baked the tofu rather than fried it.  I think it's an exaggeration to say it could pass as meat.  UPDATE:  I made this again, following the advice to press and freeze the cut tofu overnight then pour boiling water over it.  This REALLY improves the texture.  Dipped in egg before the breading and it didn't fall off at all.  I tried it frying it this time and admit I like it better--much faster and crisper that way!

Excellent recipe. I froze the tofu according to the directions from a previous reviewer. I also added some ricotta on top of the tofu. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was great!!! My boyfriend and I loved it. I did change one thing though. I did not freeze the tofu overnight like many suggested because I never think that ahead for dinner plans. I took two eggs and mixed them well with a fork in a shallow bowl. I then sliced the tofu, patted dry with a paper towel, rolled in the egg and then into the bread crumb mix. I then rolled it in the egg again (losing some breading) and put it back in the bread crumbs this time getting a nice thick coating to put right in the saucepan. I added more sauce when I baked it and it was amazing!!!

Absolutely awesome recipe!  My entire family loves this one.  I fry the tofu slices in olive oil once before dipping in breadcrumbs and frying again because it seems to make the crumbs stick better, but it isn't really necessary.  I also use extra firm tofu and make sure to squeeze out as much water as possible by wrapping it in paper towels, putting the block of tofu between two plates, and stacking canned goods on top for a few minutes.  Tip:  it's a lot easier to slice the tofu if you use a cheese slicer.

This is a great tofu recipie. I dredged the tofu slices in milk and then breaded them. I also used feta cheese in the final baking process instead of parmesean for a little added "zing". They were mildy (nicely) crispy in the end, but did NOT reheat well the next day. Even my step daughter who strains to eat healthy vegetarian food took to these. Good Luck to those who try it out.  We certainly recommend this recipie.

Once I tried to cook the tofu, all the coating came off, and it stuck to the pan and made a bloody mess! The recipe sounded too good/easy to be true, and it's not!There's probably a different way of cooking it to actually make it work, but it's frustrating that the recipe is misleading.

Fantastic recipe! I added spinach in between layers of tofu before baking, which gave it a really nice color and tasted fantastic. I also used panko breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs and it REALLY gave the tofu a great texture.

This was our first experience with tofu and it was awesome...My husband LOVED this! I sliced, pressed, seasoned (TS garlic pepper)and froze this then defrosted while doing yard work. Dipped in egg then Italian bread crumbs/parmesan and baked instead of frying.  Spread some shredded mozzarella cheese and stuck under the broiler for a a min or two and served with sauce over top instead of baking in the sauce.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

I absolutely love this dish, but I prepare it differently now, having experimented a few times. To texturize/firm the tofu, I cut into 1/4" slices, press the water out, freeze overnight and defrost prior to preparing the recipe. I use Panko crumbs for a crispier coating. I salt/pepper the tofu, press it into flour, dip it into egg whisked in a shallow dish (make sure excess egg falls off), then press it into panko. I spray both sides with an olive oil spray, then broil on each side until golden brown. I then spoon canned marinara and sprinkle mozzarella over top, and again finish off in the broiler until mozzarella is bubbly and golden. So much healthier and, in my opinion, easier -- and just as tasty as the pan-fried version. :)

very popular with 2 year old's and 40 year old's in this house....I did coat the tofu in egg after putting the cut up tofu in the freezer for about 20 - 30 minutes and the recipe couldn't have been easier..i'd highly recommend this.  Torontois review and alternatives were fantastic..thanks ; )

I'm not a seasoned tofu chef by any means, but this dish turned out amazing. My teenager claimed it to be the best thing I've ever made yet. I followed the suggestions of removing excess water then freezing then baking the tofu before frying it. The consistency was so close to chicken it fooled everyone. I used a garlic pasta sauce and homemade panko crumbs. I'll be making this again and again and again . . .

Very good! A 4 on it's own, but a 5 with modifications. I've worked with tofu a lot and been frustrated many times when trying to change the texture to be more meaty. So this time, I froze the entire block overnight and then thawed. I squeezed it out like a sponge before slicing it into 1/4 inch slices. After that, I breaded the tofu in flour, then egg (a few tbsp of water added), then the breading mix and baked the tofu for about about 30 minutes at 325 until lightly golden (flipped halfway through and sprayed with oil).  This was the best tofu I've ever had! Just a note, the first time I made this, I used jar spaghetti sauce instead of the sauce called for here. Never again! This sauce is amazing. I doubled it so I could dip my bites in even more sauce. And of course, I was generous with the garlic. Thanks for the yummy recipe.

Wow it's better than chicken!!! No joke I don't even like tofu I just made it for my wife.  I did use the pre-grilled tofu, and pressed it out between paper towels.  I also breaded with an egg wash (1 egg and 1 TBL water).  I may never make chicken parm again!

This was not very pleasing to me. My husband and mother enjoyed it though. Thought the tofu had this wierd texture. And the batter seemed to bubble instead of sticking to the tofu and being crispy. I think I will stick to eggplant parmigiana thogh. thanks anyway.

This is a great recipe.  It's fairly safe, but only cause it's delicious; however, the tofu should be pressed between two paper towels or two clothes for at least a half hour.  This pressing frees up the tofu for flavour absorption, as it releases the excess flavourless water in the tofu.  Don't forget to freeze the tofu in this recipe.  I usually freeze mine if I am not going to puree it.  Another review gives instructions for freezing.  

One thing to consider with this recipe: Unless stated otherwise, if a cheese package says rennet on it you're eating baby cow!

Deeeelicious! Flavor and texture are great. I'm a vegetarian and this recipe takes away my occassional cravings for chicken parm.  Couple things - don't use panko bread crumbs - I couldn't get them to stick well.  I ended up taking what fell off in the pan, and spooning it over the top before I baked it.  Also, I found 8oz of sauce too little - I'd use 12oz and have extra to put on pasta.  I had whole wheat angel hair - perfection! Thanks for the great recipe - it will be a regular in my house.

This recipe is unbelievable!  USE EXTRA FIRM TOFU (It comes in different textures) No need to put it in the cold water - I just sliced it, breaded it with flour, egg and bread crumbs and then pan fried it.  The extra firm tofu sliced well - but freezing it for an hour wouldn't have hurt.  Delicious!!!!!!

This was definitely the best tofu dish I've ever had by far - It was great! I read the reviews and ended up slicing the tofu into thin pieces, patting them dry, and freezing them overnight. Before preparing, I poured boiling water over them, pat them dry again, and then dipped them into flour, egg and breadcrumb mixture. (THANKS reviewers for leaving those tips - the breadcrumbs had NO PROBLEM sticking to the tofu at all!). I baked them in the oven for 15 minutes at 350 and then fried them in a skillet. (But next time I'm going to skip either the baking or the frying - I kinda overcooked them.) Then they went back into the oven with the sauce and cheese. It was great. Even my mom and husband who "yucked" the idea of tofu liked it. Excellent recipe!!!!!

I thought that I hated tofu but this recipe changed my mind. I will be making this frequently. I recommend keeping the tofu slices 1/4 inch or less, one of mine was thicker and that one tasted a little too much like tofu. I omitted the garlic, oregano and basil and used 3 cheese spaghetti sauce in place of tomato sauce. Rather than fire up the oven I added the spaghetti sauce to the pan that the tofu had browned in, turned the heat down very low, put the tofu back in, topped with cheeses, covered the skillet and let it simmer until the cheese was melted and the tofu hot. I also followed the advice of others and dipped the tofu in an egg beaten with a little milk before dredging in breadcrumbs instead of water. My boyfriend cooked extra spaghetti because he thought the tofu would be so gross he couldn't eat it but he liked it so much that he ate 4 slices!

My husband, who is NOT a tofu guy, got thirds! (and he knew it was tofu!)  
I would recommend dipping the tofu in egg or milk though to get the bread crumbs to not just slide off.

I don't know if I would mistake this for veal, but I could definitely think this was a nice eggplant dish.  Overall, DELICIOUS!!  I used EXTRA-FIRM tofu.  After frying, I set 1 slice aside (before baking the rest as directed) and ate it with just a little of the sauce on top.  It was already great and I couldn't decide which I liked more, the fried version (without baking) or the recipe as stated!  Users might prefer the fried version in order to get that nice crunch, but others might enjoy the baked version to get more of real hearty parmigiana texture.

Fantastic recipe! I used organic tofu and it turned out wonderfully, tasting like breaded ricotta cheese. I prepared the tofu a little differently however. First, I dredged it in flour, then coated it with beaten egg in a shallow dish, and finally into the breadcrumbs. I baked it at 350 degrees for 20-30 minutes until the tofu was crispy and set, and continued with the recipe as posted. Tasted wonderful, thanks so much for a great dish that I can serve to vegetarian friends!

Thank you for a great Tofu recipe! I've been looking for different tofu recipes and this is one of my favorites.  I make it just about every week and still can't believe it's not eggplant or chicken!  I made some modifications to make it a little more "carb" balanced and used Fat Free Mozz cheese to lower the fat content.  It still turned out just as yummy.  Thanks again.

Just thinking about this makes me hungry!  This recipe is easy and very good.  The only thing I wish is that the tofu breading could stay crisp in the tomato sauce, but that just can't be.  The tofu straight from the pan is irresistible and with the other ingredients makes a nice dinner.

My husband is not a tofu fanatic, but he ate everything on his plate--reluctantly.
We both agreed that this dish was even better when reheated the next day.

Really delicious - particularly for something so simple!  I did, however, egg the tofu before crumbing, and next time I think I will do a double layer of egg and breadcrumbs.  But everyone in the family loved it.  Leftovers great on toast the next day!

Delicious! I did follow the instruction of other reviewers though and did the flour, egg and bread crumb method. For the sauce I used a 16oz can of Trader Joe's Marinara sauce, the 8oz can wouldn't be enough for us. Next time I'll make my own sauce though and add a little red pepper. Fabulous recipe. Serve with a side salad with Italian dressing, garlic bread and your favorite red wine.

I've made this recipe many times now. It's great eaten fresh, but I also love to freeze it in containers with pasta and some extra sauce for work lunches. It thaws out just fine, and I can grab it and go in the morning!

Followed the reviews and breaded with flour, egg and then the bread crumb mixture. Baked the tofu slices instead of frying. Doubled the sauce ... and we still could've had more sauce.

breading would not stick after frying and it was a bit salty.  I recommend going the extra effort to make a real sauce rather than mixing a few herbs into a can of sauce.

Absolutely delicious!! This recipe has become a weekly staple for me and my non-vegetarian boyfriend. Changes I've made are: not dipping the tofu in water; pressing each slice of tofu in paper towel; baking the tofu slices in 350F for about 10 minutes prior to dipping in bread crumbs; making my own seasoned bread crumbs by combining plain bread crumbs with spices and garlic powder; and using a flavoured pasta sauce (one jar is good for two dishes) instead of plain tomato sauce. Yum!!!

My son (whose dad is a real foodie), loved this so much he dared compare it with his father's cooking. That made me feel like the best mom ever. I usually would make my own sauce, but I used a gourmet jar from stonewall kitchen. The meal looks and tastes substantial, I was very pleased.

Froze tofu, defrosted, squeezed out water, sliced 1/4 thick, sandwiched between paper towel & 2 cookie sheets with a bowl of fruit for weight, then baked tofu and followed the remaining directions.  Excellent for vegetarians and meat eaters alike.

Made this today and took the advice of others who suggested freezing slices of tofu on cookie sheet, then dipping slices in flour, egg, and then the breadcrumb mix. Sprayed canola oil on a baking sheet and baked the tofu at 350 for 15 min. on each side. I used a store-bought spaghetti sauce with spinach and cheese. Put a bit of sauce in an 8x8 baking dish, then tofu, more sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, then repeated for another layer. Baked at 350 for 20 min. Wonderful and delish!! Husband had no idea I used tofu and thoroughly enjoyed the dish. This is a keeper. Thanks!

This was actually really good.  My two teenage kids and husband are not tofu fans so i didn't tell them what was inside and said 'just eat it, you'll like it'.

They actually cleaned off their plates and went back for more!!! A success.

They asked me to make it again for dinner.

Thanks for posting it.

I am a vegetarian and I love tofu.  However there are non vegge peeps in my family.  Those people loved this dish.  My 2 year old son gobbled it down and my hubby went back for seconds.  I used fresh mozzarella and fresh basil. This is going in my recipe box and will be makeing it AGAIN AND AGAIN!

When I first saw this recipe, I was intrigued? Tofu Parmigiana? That sounds interesting? I decided to try it for dinner. My husband hates tofu, but he tried it and to my surprize he liked it! Glory Hallelujah! I found a tofu recipe he will eat! My son(the picky eater)also loved it! We thought it tasted just like eggplant parmigiana! I did however make a few changes to the recipe, just to accomidate for lack there-of, or for taste preferences. I drained sliced tofu between 2 kitchen towels pressed by a large pan on top for 15 mins. I then used egg rather than water to dip slices in and made my own bread crumbs by using 1/2 c. plain crumbs mixed with 1/4 c. parm cheese, 1 tsp. mixed italian herbs, and 1 T. seasoned salt. fryed them in 1 part unsalted butter to 1 part olive oil for more of a buttery flavor. and used a homemade mushroom pasta sauce, seasoned with oregano, basil and garlic, like in the recipe. Topped it with mozzarella and parm cheese, like in the recipe and baked it according to directions. Perfecto! Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  I doubled the ingredients, and didn't make many changes (for once), except to the sauce.  For the sauce I sauteed an onion until almost carmelized, then added tomato sauce, tomato paste, garlic, basil, oregano, a bit of brown sugar, and salt/pepper.  I followed other suggestions for draining the tofu, then dredging in flour, then egg, then breadcrumb mixture.  Baked for about 15 min on each side, then added tomato sauce and cheese and baked for 20 min in a 9x13" pan.  It was fantastic!  Kids gobbled it up, and even my hardcore carnivorous husband loved it!

I have to give this 5 stars. My husband and daughter actually ate it. They didn't know there was tofu in in though. 

I froze and crumpled the tofu and it looked like canned chicken or something. This was my first time cooking with tofu.

I followed the advice of others and baked the breaded tofu first.  I added spinach between layers, next time I'll add more spinach for sure.  A great recipe that I look forward to making again.  Always looking for good tofu recipes and this is a keeper!

OMG! Amazing dish! I think it taste like lasagna I would buy at an Italian restaurant. My husband even loves it (and he's picky). I used this recipe for my very first tofu recipe and I'm hooked! I think its even better the next day (for leftovers).

I will be making this again. I omitted the step where you place it back in water, and I baked at 350 for 15 minutes on each side instead of frying. Drizzled about a tbsp of olive oil on top when I turned it over in the oven. Omitted the mozzarella, and it was still very good. I would have preferred there to be a little more sauce, but my husband liked that it was not very saucy. Thanks for the great recipe! It was the first time that I ever cooked with tofu. :)

Out of all the mishaps I had making this dish, my grandson still wanted to take it for lunch.  Unfortunately for him, I beat him to it.  Yeah harsh, but I gave him another one of his favorite lunches to make up for my meanness ;-)

This was truly delicious.  A keeper as other cooks say.  Thanks.

This was wonderful, but I did make a few changes. First, in case you haven't worked with tofu before, it SO MUCH easier to work with if you freeze it, then defrost it. You can then easily squeeze out the extra water and in this case, press it firmly into the parmesan/bread crumb mixture without it falling apart. It changes the texture, but not the taste. This is especially good for people who are turned off by the "slimy" texture. I also double-layered the tofu, alternating with spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. I thought I sliced it to the right thickness, yet I had plenty extra and I ended up happy that it turned out this way. I can't wait to make this again, especially for tofu-resistant carnivores. My husband, who loves meaty eggplant parmesan, loved this and asked that I keep the recipe to make regularly. My kids loved it too!

Yum - I didn't fry the breaded tofu - I put them back in the oven.  It was very tasty - the family like it.

Great vegetarian tofu recipe. Agree with comments, I froze for 20-30 minutes, dredged in egg and crumbs then baked. Was delish.

Great recipe! I was not sure if this was really going to be good but even my 18 month old ate every bite! Tofu! This was definitely a winner. I did bake it then fried it in light olive oil to get that crispy texture that made this dish a pleasure to eat. Will make again and again.

This turned out great.  Thanks so much for the recipe because we have been looking for different ways to cook tofu.

I did slice and freeze mine and then did the egg wash to the bread crumbs.  It was delicious and I'll try it again for sure.

Delicious! I love that you don't need to be fussy about drying out the tofu (by patting or pre-baking) - it's perfect sliced straight out of the water and thrown into the breadcrumb mixture. We sprinkled the leftover breadcrumbs on top of the mozzarella for an added crunch. You really can't tell this is tofu!

I made this recipie as I am trying to get my family to try some vegetarian dishes. We were all delighted with the results. My children even asked for me to make it again. I did bake my tofu first, as suggested in another review. Overall, this was a great introduction to tofu!

Not good, i followed the recipe exactly for making the tofu and breading and it was very bland.  I added extra mozzarella and i added ricotta to ensure a nice and cheesy meal but i couldn't eat it.  I normally like tofu but this was not good.

Yum! ok, so yes the crust did fall off, but the taste was great and we will definitely make this again. I'll just dip in egg white first. I want to use whole wheat bread crumbs next time also.

Good! I did freeze my tofu overnight, then let it thaw on the counter for about 30 minutes before patting dry. The tofu had a nice texture. Followed the recipe other than that, except I added some mushrooms to the sauce and used fresh basil. My fiance really enjoyed this, so I'm a happy camper. Thanks :)

I made this recipe last night and my husband (non-vegeterian) and I (vegetarian) loved it!!!!!! I modified a little and followed some suggestions mentioned in other reviews:  1. I sliced, froze and thawed the tofu first 2. I seasoned the tofu with powder garlic, onion, salt, and black pepper 3. I used the flour, egg, bread crumbs combination for breading the tofu and I added dry oregano & basil to the bread crumbs. 4. I baked the tofu instead of frying.  I used Prego traditional sauce,  low fat mozzarella cheese, and parmigiano reggiano cheese. This turned out perfect!!!! I will be making this recipe again, and again! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!!

I also used Toronois' advise and dipped in flour, egg and then bread crumbs. This worked very well. I baked them as well and used the extra firm tofu. It had a very good texture and taste.

We love this recipe. I do two things differently. I use our own homemade sauce and I dip the tofu in egg before dipping it in the breadcrumbs. What I like about this meal is we prepare the tofu and then prepare chicken for my meat eating husband in the same way. I love meals that I can accommodate both of us without a lot of extra work. This fits the bill perfectly.

This was so yummy!  I used 2 big tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and then cooked a pkg. of penne and jar of tomato sauce on the side.  I layered the penne mixed with tomato sauce(added some veggies, seasoning and a bit of brown sugar), put the 3 T. of Parm. cheese on top of that, then the tomato/garlic/basil mixture on top of that, topped with tofu and then the cheese.  I loved the texture of the tofu with the cheese all melty on top.  I struggled with the crumbs sticking to the tofu but I just sprinkled the remaining bread crumbs on top of the tofu and it all turned out so freaking delicious!  Thanks for a great dinner.

This is a great recipe - It's best if you make pasta to serve alongside and use a lot more sauce to use on your pasta.  I think that the texture is more like cheese, and not at all like chicken.  i used the freezing technique a lot of people had mentioned and while it came out firmer and looked more like chicken, it was really like fresh mozzarella.  which was BRILLIANT (who doesn't love fresh mozzarella in marina sauce?)

This had good flavor but the tofu gave it bland and crumbly texture. I used spaghetti sauce and homemade breadcrumbs.  Per another reviewer's suggestion, I baked it instead of frying which give it more crispness in my opinion.  I'll use this recipe again with eggplant or chicken instead.

I LOVED this! It was super easy & quick.  And tasted awesome!!! My kids ate it up, and my husband who HATES tofu, said it actually wasn't that bad. I will definately be making this again. I'm not a vegetarian, but I preferred this to chicken parmesan.

Wow, this recipe was so good.  Next time I will try baking the tofu as other reviewers suggested, as I had somewhat of a tricky time keeping the breading on the tofu.  Despite this minor difficulty, the taste was still amazing.  I can't believe its not eggplant or veal

This recipe was fabulous!  I prepared the tofu as instructed.  My variation was that I boiled a small portion of whole wheat penne while preparing my homemade (quick) puttanesca sauce.  I drained the penne right before it was fully cooked to al dente.  I then layered a little sauce, penne, the browned tofu, a little more sauce, and then topped with the remaining breadcrumbs and fresh mozzerella.  Baked at 400 for only about 15 mins...and VOILA...a tofu / penne bake!

Excellent!!! made slight changes to my taste.Served over wheat pasta.Used wheat crumbs and seasoned them as they come plain.Used egg for crumbs to stick.Used fresh parm cheese and Mozz mix.
Dish tasted just like eggplant parm.Careful on the temp,almost burned at 400 for 20 min.5yr old inhaled it!I told her it was chicken  :)

Delicious! I make this recipe frequently, and have passed it along to several of my friends. I also recommend using extra-firm tofu and draining it well before cooking to prevent mushiness or crumbling. I also use two cans of petite diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce - gives it some extra texture.

Delicious and very different way to serve tofu.  My boyfriend and I both loved it.  I followed the recipe pretty closely and didn't have too much trouble getting the breadcrumbs to stick, though perhaps I would try using egg next time.  I had extra breadcrumbs left over and sprinkled them on top which added a nice crispy finish.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This was really good. But I don't understand the steps about placing the tofu in the water. I try and press as much water as possible out of the tofu not add more. And all the pieces will not fit in a 8 inch pan.  I used a 9 x 13. I took the advice of other posts and froze the tofu first, deforst, then squeezed out the excess water. Definitely dip the pieces into egg before dredging in the crumbs. There is no way the bread crumbs can stick to the tofu pieces.  I was surprised at the amount of time it took for the tofu to brown. Instead of dizzling with olive oil,  I sprayed it with my olive oil "Misto" sprayer. I think that really helped to control the fat. I also use about 2 cups of pasta sauce not 8 ounces of tomato sauce.  And like other posts, I "accidentally" forgot to mention it was tofu. Hee-Hee. The kids ate it up.

This was great, the only thing I would change is to add a bit more sauce as it needed it to coat the pasta.

this is my favorite meal i've ever made. listened to the suggestions about baking the tofu first and dipping it in egg white instead of water... also added lots more garlic to the sauce... it is easy and delicious (even to people who are anti-tofu) thank you!!!!!

WOW! This was superb! So good in fact, that I finally joined this group just to say thanks for posting it.This is a new family favorite for sure! I will make this again and again. I did double the tomato sauce and even added some of the leftover breadcrumb mixture to the sauce - DELISH!!

Waow! This was yummy! I made it for sunday lunch at my parents' and they loved it, even if they're not fan of "weird" foods like tofu. :) I added eggplant and canned mushrooms to the tomato sauce and used reduced fat mozzarella in order to make it even more low cal...

MMMmmm. This is good. I sliced the tofu as thin as possible and froze it on a plastic cutting board for about 20 min. I didn't know if I should layer the tofu in the baking dish, but I did and it worked. I think next time I will use a bigger baking pan and bake a little longer-- I like it crispy.

Easy to make and tasty---browned tofu with egg/flour mixture and pressed bread crumbs then fryed each side for about 15 mins.  Did the sauce in pan and poured over tofu when ready, sprinkled with cheese. Served with garlic bread. Would make again----was a big hit with my family. Also doubled the sauce---the more the better!!

This was a big hit with me and my boyfriend, who loves meat. I read all the reviews and adjusted. I used thin slices of extra-firm tofu, pressed each sliced twice with paper towel, then breaded with whole wheat flour, beaten egg, and the bread crumbs pressed on well, and they pan-fryed quickly in olive oil. At the end I melted the mozz cheese right on the slices as I waited for the pasta and jarred spaghetti sauce (that I spiced up with some red pepper flakes and baby portabellas) to finish heating up. I just layered on our plates the pasta, a bit of sauce, then the tofu, more sauce and grated parmesan. Without baking in sauce, the tofu stayed crispy and fabulous, plus saved time.

I'll definitely make this again.  Don't be afraid to try this if you are new to tofu.  I baked instead of fried as suggested by other reviewers and will do that again.

This is incredible!  I made this last night for dinner, and my non-tofu liking husband loved it and had THIRDS!  I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, and a jar of mushroom speghetti sauce. (I can never have too much sauce, I used about 3/4 the jar) I layered it: sauce, tofu, cheese, sauce, etc... and it was SOOOO good!  I will definitely make this again!

Delicious! The pan frying portion of this recipe was difficult, but the end result was fanatasic! The crumbs were not well-adhered to the tofu but don't worry, the tomato sauce covered that fact. Better than eggplant parmagiana!  I was a little sketical about the tofu-cheese combo, but it turned out great!

This recipe was SO yummy.  My husband found out it was tofu though and wouldn't eat it.  I loved it though, I ate the rest for the following breakfast.  To keep the tofu from falling apart so easily, make sure to really keep the cold water step COLD (I used ice cubes to help it along).  I also used extra firm tofu.  I will be making this again very soon, even if it is just for me.

This meal was great!  The only difference I made was frrezing and pressing the tofu.  This gives a chewier more meaty texture.  I'll definitely be making it again.

Very good!!!  I followed others recommendations to slice, dry, freeze.  As well as dip in flour, egg, then crumbs(I used panko).  I also baked rather than fried.  
I used my own marinara sauce, which I use for everything!

It had a wonderful flavor and texture!  My husband said he likes it better than chicken parm!!!  Who knew :-D

I've never cooked with tofu before, and this was DELICIOUS! I figured "parmigiana" was the best kind of recipe to make because you can't go wrong with sauce and cheese. I read the reviews first and made these changes: I pressed the tofu between weighted paper towel for hours before starting, sprinkled the 6 slices with flour before dipping in egg and then bread crumbs. From there I followed the recipe, frying them lightly and then baking. I served it over whole wheat spaghetti with steamed green beans. Also I used what I had on hand which was plain bread crumbs and jarred tomato basil pasta sauce. I just added dried Italian seasoning, extra oregano and grated Parmesan to the plain crumbs. I think as long as you prep the tofu well to make it dry and firm, you can't go wrong with this no matter how you may change the other ingredients. This was sooo good!

This is delicious, but I've given it only 3 stars because 1) the instructions for coating/breading are insufficient and I had to devise a better way, and 2) I think the dish would be better with a more robust (or even a jarred) sauce.

To get my breading to stick, I dusted the tofu slabs in cornstarch and then dipped them in an egg wash before patting them into the seasoned breadcrumbs. I happened to use panko because that's what I had on hand, and I wanted a fuller, crunchier texture to the dish.  The breading stayed on the tofu beautifully and left pretty much nothing in the pan!

Next time - of which there will be many - I will use my favorite jarred Arrabiata sauce and probably make it my own by grating in a little fresh garlic and adding some fresh basil.  Think I'll also use this breaded tofu as a protein source and pasta substitute when making vegetarian lasagna.

This was FANTASTIC.  I did go with one of the reviewer's suggestions: after slicing the tofu, I dipped in flour, egg, then breadcrumbs, and then baked at 350 or 375 for roughly 15 minutes on each side.  Even my boyfriend, who is a proud meat eater, said, "This is amazing."  So, there you have it.

This was fabulous! I really would not have known there was not eggplant in it, if I didn't make it myself. I did make a few changes as other suggested --- did not soak tofu, just dried really well in paper towels after cutting it into 1/4" thick slices. Then I baked on a foil lined baking sheet for 15-20 minutes as well as I then coated in one beaten egg before adding breadcrumb mixture. Very, very good!

Being the first time EVER to eat Tofu, I was a little hesitant on recipes. I went through MANY MANY Tofu recipes and finally decided to try this one! I loved it! My boys LOVED it! I made a few changes. I didn't have basil on hand since I wasn't home when I made this so I used Italian seasoning (which I think turned out way better.) Instead of using bread crumbs I used Kellogg's Special K Cereal, put it in a plastic bag and crumbled it. I have to be honest, it was a little hard to work with but then again I've never handled Tofu before. Great recipe definitely will be kept in my family recipe book! Thanks for this recipe, from a Single mom of 3 boys! :)

Delicious! A really good tofu recipe. I used an egg to dip the tofu slices in before coating with the bread crumbs to make them stick better, but otherwise the recipe is great. If I do it again I will marinate the tofu first and double the recipe so I can have two layers, maybe add layers of tomato and onion slices.

Where do i start! this was really yummy, my boyfriend loved it. We are vegetarians so i could not try the egg to make the breadcrumbs stick. I just dipped it in some vegetable broth and baked the tofu. I decided to do some testing and made one batch in the frying pan and just baked the other. Overall I say skip the frying the oven does the job just fine. Otherwise I would def make this again. Tofu is so affordable at just $1 or $2 a container. There's also room for a vegan to enjoy this dish, simply switch out the regular cheese for soy cheese! :p

This was ok.  I followed some other reviewers' advice and froze the sliced tofu before breading, then baked.  I don't know how anyone could ever mistake this for chicken, but it was decent.  It was a good way to use up the remaining tofu I had in the house, but I won't likely make it again.

My husband and I stopped eating meat and are always looking for new ways to add protein.  While I don't like or dislike tofu, I eat it because I need to.  I could not tell that tofu was used in this recipe - it was soooo good.  Lucky for us I made enough for lunch the next day!  I think I could've fooled my son with this recipe - he'd think it was chicken.  Thanks for sharing!

This was top notch.  I followed some suggestions and pre-baked before frying, and also dipped in egg before breading.  My package of tofu was 14 oz. and when sliced it yielded nine pieces which fit nicely in a 9x13 pan in one layer.  Firmer texture than eggplant, softer than chicken- maybe close to veal.  Very nice.

I like this dish! I baked my tofu instead of frying it, and then refrigerated the slices for a few hours (gives the tofu a firmer texture.) I made it in layers like a lazagna(sauce/tofu/sauce/cheese/tofu/sauce/ a little more cheese.) I used my own sauce. I served this with mashed cauliflower, sauteed greens, and a salad. I might make this again (but maybe not, my husband didn't like it very much.)

My husband loved it and he doesn't like tofu usually!  I also loved it.  Good idea and delicious recipe!  I did freeze the tofu, but only because I had to (it was getting oldish and I didn't want it to spoil).  I usually don't freeze tofu.

But surprise, surprise he loved this,took left overs to school and wants me to fix it more often than I would like. So thanks for the recipe!

This was amazing!! Just made it for my husband and 4 year old and they loved it! Only changes I made were to dip the tofu in egg before the breadcrumbs so they would stick better. Also I did not place tofu in a bowl of water I just sliced and pressed all of the water out of tofu with a paper towel. I also added extra garlic. Will be making this again soon!

In the past I have not had very good luck with tofu, but this recipe came out really well. In fact, it really tasted a lot like chicken parmesan. The best part is that the tofu does not have to be pan-fried like when you use chicken or eggplant. Excellent healthier option!

Loved this! Next time I plan to double the recipe and use a larger pan. In this case I will bake the tofu slices in the oven as I would have otherwise to do multiple bathches in a skillet.

Fantastic tofu dish! Will be making again. 

I breaded the tofu using crushed corn flakes and seasoned them with parmesan, spaghetti sauce and italian seasoning.

I followed what others have suggested by baking the tofu in the oven, followed by pan frying it in olive oil.  The result was excellent!

Also, to cut fat, I used cottage cheese.

Yum. We enjoyed this for our Meatless Monday dinner, using the pre-bake method for the tofu. Spices were just right, but will notch-up the garlic next time.

I have never worked with tofu before, surprisingly this turned out really good. I followed some of the reviewer's recommendations to slice the tofu, drain it, then freeze for 30 minutes. After that I floured each piece, dipped in an egg wash and breaded. I baked them for 15 min each side at 350 degrees. I used bottled pasta sauce. My mother, who loves Eggplant Parmesan, said that it was excellent and tasted very similar to eggplant parm. My sister is a vegetarian, so I can't wait to make this for her the next time she comes to visit!

Delicious!  Instead of making my own sauce I used a jar of Prego Roasted Red Pepper Spaghetti Sauce since we like is saucy.  I served it over angel hair pasta and even my picky vegetarian liked it and said I should make it again!

This is so tasty!  Yum, yummy.  I did bake the tofu first (350 for 15 mins) and it also seemed like I needed more breading.  Next time I increase the breading to 3/4 c.

This was surprisingly delicious and I didn't feel I was sacrificing taste for eating healthy.  I ran out of breadcrumbs and used panko for the last few slices - both were good.  I love fresh herbs and lemon so I added a squeeze of lemon over the finished product and a generous amount of fresh basil but the recipe as it reads is excellent.  This recipe will be a regular in my house...thank you for sharing!

I have never worked with tofu before and this was AWESOME.  I used the advice of others and froze this overnight in the package - then thawed out in hot water enough to get it out of the package - then defrosted for 3-4 mins in microwave. I found this article after cooking and wish I would have drained the tofu first http://vegetarian.lovetoknow.com/How_to_Freeze_Tofu . The tofu did have a nice sponge feel to it.  I then dredged in flour then egg wash and finally the bread crumbs.  I fried it because I was in a hurry, but next time I'll definitely bake them to be healthier and have a better consistency.  I did make the mistake of not dividing the oregeno and put 2 teaspoons into my breadcrumbs, I didn't notice it being too overpowering.  I put this into an 8x8" dish with sauce on bottom, half tofu, then cheese, tofu, sauce and cheese on the very top.  I sprinkled with parmesan on top of that & baked for 20 mins.  The whole time we ate it we said I can't believe I like this and it's healthy.

I am on my 5th day as a vegetarian, and today I finally acknowledged that I may have to give tofu a try. In the past my dad -- known around the neighborhood as an amazing cook -- has tried to come up with some tofu-friendly recipe, but I have never liked the flavor. Tonight I surrendered and gave this recipe a try, following the original (I didn't notice the tips in the ratings). What a difference! I added too much salt, but the flavorings eliminated the taste that I'd always disliked in tofu, so I'm delighted! Will definately make it again, following some rater's tips :D

Very, very good. I used jarred spaghetti sauce instead of making the tomato sauce mixture. We made paninis out of them with italian bread and fresh basil- a great lunch!

This was great!  I coated and baked it  at 350 for 15 minutes each side as in other reviews!  My 5 year old loved it.   Next time I might make it more like lasagna and add vegetables and ricotta cheese to the layers.

UPDATED to from 4 stars to 5 as I have made this dish for family dinners at least 20 times. This was easy to make and took a little less than the time stated which is great. I double the tofu. I used an egg instead of water and served over angel hair pasta with veggies on the side. Will make like once a month! Thanks!

Really good and even easier if you use Italian flavored bread crumbs and a good marinara sauce. I'm not vegetarian but I'd happily make and eat this again!

If possible, I would have given this recipe more stars. YUM. Tofu will never be the same after this recipe! I highly recommend taking the suggestion of roasting the tofu slices prior. I roasted mine at 400 degrees until both sides were brown. I also added a layer of ricotta to mine and cooked this in a loaf pan so I could stack the tofu instead of having just one layer. I did a thin layer of tomato sauce, then the breaded, cooked tofu, a thin layer of ricotta, tomato sauce, another tofu layer, and topped this with tomato sauce and the mozz and parm cheeses as instructed (Layered like a lasagna I suppose). To simplify, I used a jar of preseasoned tomato sauce (roasted garlic) and this came out beautifully. Thank you Jill!

The breading didn't stick for me, but next time I will try some of the other reader comments that addressed this. Overall, my husband liked it! I liked it, too, but would like to try it a second time before I decide if it's something we'll make very often.

Taste of this is delicious! Will be making this again and again. I did try to cut out some fat by baking tofu rather than frying. I had a heck of a time with the tofu though. I followed another reviewers advice and patted tofu dry and then freeze - my fault however as I forgot about it and rather than being in the freezer for 30mins it was in there for a few hours. They fell apart  and it was just a mess. Once I eventually baked the pieces though I had no more problems and the taste was truly wonderful. If you freeze the tofu make sure it's just for 30mins  :)   Thanks for sharing this great, easy, VERY tasty dish!

My family is trying to eat more vegetarian meals, and incorporate tofu more often.  Normally I would make this with eggplant, but this is a good variation.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used extra firm tofu, which I drained, sliced and froze.  I also coated it with flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs and they stayed put.  I baked the slices in the oven with some olive oil spritzed on and they browned nicely.  We like lots of sauce, so I used a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce and doubled the spices.  Baking it in my loaf pan was perfect and it cut and served without a mess.  Next time I'll add some red pepper flakes to the sauce as we like things a little spicy, but overall this is a great recipe.

This was my first experience with tofu and this recipe did not disappoint. As many others had done, I did take a few liberties. I froze my tofu and let it thaw before baking and pressed the tofu between a couple of paper towels in order to dry it out just a little.  I opted to bake the tofu, but I drizzled a little olive oil on a baking sheet and then placed the tofu slices on top. It made the breading crisp and brown a little nicer. I used my usual pasta sauce from a jar, as well.   The end result turned out beautifully and was equally delicious. Thank you (all) for providing me with a wonderful first experience with tofu!

I have never had tofu before but wanted to do something for my Meatless mondays.  I did take the advise from someone and first dried tofu in oven.  The whole family raved about it and my husband who rarely loves anything but eats everything I put in front of him, suprisingly enough gave it 2 thumbs up and said I can make it again. My kids are 14, 16 and 22 and they all ate it with no complaints.

I feel a little weird about rating this recipe since I followed other reviewers' changes, but I wasn't able to not rate it. In any case, it's definitely a dish worth making!    I followed TORONTOIS's instructions for baking the tofu instead of frying it. I also omitted the salt, basil, and oregano since my bread crumbs had Italian seasoning. That turned out to be a really good idea - it had enough flavor/salt without the additions!   Overall I thought it was a DELICIOUS dish and tasted like something you would get in a restaurant. Definitely is best served right away so that you can enjoy the crispiness of the bread crumbs. :)

This was really good! I took the suggestion of dipping the tofu in flour, then egg, then bread crumbs. I always freeze and thaw my tofu before cooking because it gives it a firmer texture!

Even as a vegetarian this was not a dish I at all enjoyed. It tasted like flavorless tofu with cheese, and the breading would not stick to the tofu in the pan. I would rather have just made lasagna. I'm afraid I have to give this recipe a bad review, and won't be making it for my family again.

A new mainstay tofu dish for my family!  I did Italian seasoned soy flour, then egg, then flax meal & parmesan breading, baked at 400 for about 22 minutes w/ one flip, sauced & cheesed, baked for about 20 min...  really easy and yummy!  Always glad to find tasty tofu meals to keep in rotation!

Great tofu dish!  I'm not usually very skilled when working with tofu but this would be hard to mess up.  I did follow the advice of reviews and froze the sliced tofu, dipped in whole wheat flour, then egg, then crumb mixture and baked in oven for 30 minutes, flipping once.  I also skipped the cheese until the end and just sprinkled a bit on top in order to cut back on fat/kcal.  My only issue was that I didn't have enough room in my pan for all of the tofu pieces!    I would definitely recommend this recipe for someone trying to find new easy ways to prepare tofu.

Amazing.  This was the first time I ever cooked and tasted tofu and Im very HAPPY about this recipe.  I always use crushed garlic-cheese croutons instead of bread crumbs.

My family really enjoyed this one! I make sure to buy extra-firm tofu, and I freeze for 30 minutes after slicing to make it easier to handle (tip from another reviewer, thanks!). Prepared spaghetti sauce works great. Mmmmmm!

I made this tonight and thought it was great! I also froze the tofu prior to cooking it as it makes it easier to handle. I would also recommend making twice the amount of sauce, especially if you serve it over spaghetti. Overall, fantastic taste! It's always finding another way to make tofu!

WOW, this was absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!  This may sound weird, but my husband and I both swear that this tasted exactly like veal.  I froze the tofu and squeezed it out after unthawing, dipped it in flour then egg, and then the bread crumbs.  The freezing of the tofu made a world of difference.  I pan fried the tofu and proceeded to pretty much make a regular parm dish after that.  We were both blown away with the flavor and texture of the tofu and will definitely be making this again.

This dish was amazing! I followed the advice of other reviewers and pressed the tofu (I did not freeze). I then used flour, egg+milk, and then the seasoned bread-crumb mixture to coat before frying. Excellent! This still had a tofu-taste and texture, but was delicious none-the-less. Meat-eating boyfriend loved it! He made homemade sauce to go with it, so we did not follow that part of the recipe. Will DEFINITELY make again.

This was so good! I took other reviewers advice and cut the tofu up the night before, squeezed out the water and froze it. I also baked the tofu instead of pan-frying. It came out really well!

This is absolutely delicious, and my husband just loved it.  I dipped the tofu in egg before breading it. I think that the breading really makes this dish, I wouldn't recommend leaving this step out, as it really does give the tofu a chicken or veal texture.  I baked the tofu in the oven first, to crisp it up (rather than frying it) and it turned out perfectly golden with all the breading intact.  From there, I layered it up with the cheese and sauce, covered it with foil, and baked it right up.  SO good!!!!!  Looking forward to making it again.

This was very good.  (I really liked it, the family thought it was OK).  I will make again in small portions just for myself.  I used my own special spaghetti sauce recipe instead of the sauce ingredients listed.

This was an easy recipe to make. It was good and I would probably make it again. The only problem I had was getting the breadcrumbs to stick to the tofu as I was frying them.

Mmm, was this good!  I followed the other reviewer's suggestion by pressing then freezing the tofu, and baking instead of frying.  I also layered in a loaf pan and it was very flavorful and light.  I prefer this recipe to using veggie chik patties for vegetarian chicken parmigiana... it's not so heavy and still full of protein!  Will definitely add this to my regular rotation.

Talk about a surprising dish! I'm accustomed to destroying a tofu dish, but this was amazing! Just the right mix of herbs. My mom really dislikes tofu but this dish she liked! Next time I'll give it a go with extra firm tofu as opposed to just firm.

yes, this was good for a tofu substitution recipe. I enjoyed it more than the family did, but that's because I am more accustomed to tofu. My family said it was good, but I didn't hear anyone say, "is there anymore??" The frying part was difficult- the breading fell off and was eventually burnt in the pan. I might recommend it to my vegan friend. I'm sure she'd like it.

This recipe went over fantastically with my fiance, who, being an avid archery hunter, was very skeptical about any non-meat centered meal - especially one involving tofu.

In addition to drying out extra firm tofu before pan frying it, I also used an eggwash before coating the slices with breadcrumbs.

I've made it several times now, and it always goes over great!

My husband has always been quite proud of his eggplant parmigiana, but he said he likes this better!  He compared it to Olive Garden's chicken parmigiana.  Following the advice of another reviewer, I froze the tofu, dipped it in egg, breaded it and baked it rather than frying.  It came out delicious!

Pretty darn good for tofu. I would add more breading and fry it a little longer if you're not used to eating it.

This is one of my Fav's.. I do freeze my tofu then drain it between a towel to get out the water.(to defrost it quicker I put it in a pan with water and heat it up then drain it, much faster than the micro.and sometimes I forget to get it out the nite before or in the morning )I also took others advise and I dredge my tofu in egg, it keeps the bread crumds so much better then I also heat the oven to 350 degree and fry the tofu that way.I also have to admit I either use my own sauce or whatever I have on hand, The leftovers are the best !!! I always use extra firm tofu it works best for me..Thanx so much I just love this !!!!(A way I drain my tofu to get the water out is I take a towel set it on the counter wrap the tofu in it then I take a plate set it on top I then place a gallon of water on top of that.for me it works really well.after you get the hang of where to balance the water it drains pretty fast.)

My husband said this was the best tofu thing he has ever had and would be willing to have it instead of chicken parmigiana! My kids liked it too.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I put a couple of slices of fresh bread in the food processor. I cut the tofu and froze it and then had to run it under water to get the coating to stick.  Like a previous reviewer, I coated the tofu with flour, egg and breadcrumbs, sprayed with cooking spray and baked until lightly browned. Delicious!

Tasty and opened my eyes to the possibilities of tofu.  Having never cooked with tofu before, I followed other reviewers‚Äô advice to press out excess water, freeze, dip in flour/egg/breadcrumb, and pre-bake.  That was very helpful but I think next time I‚Äôll brown it in oil instead of the oven for a different texture.  I look forward to making this again.

This was my first time making tofu and I was nervous the texture wouldn't come out right.  I used extra-firm tofu right out of the container and everything worked great! It was so quick and easy and a great meal to make for one.

Really good! And fun and easy to make, too. I used herbed tofu, and dipped this into a beaten egg to help the bread crumbs stick. I did this part in advance, then assembled the whole thing just before baking it. A hit for the whole family, including my 2 year old!

The only modification that I made to this recipe was to use a bit more sauce and basil.  It's a great introductory recipe for Tofu.  The texture is soft, but the taste is outstanding.  I'll definitely use this recipe to make my wife a Tofu believer!

This was my second time cooking with tofu. I feel like the recipe turned out exactly like it was supposed to. I used an entire large jar of spaghetti sauce, but I think I also used more tofu than called for as well. I've yet to find a 12oz. package. I think I need to invest in a kitchen scale, but I digress. I didn't freeze the tofu, just patted dry with papertowels, but I used the vacuum packed variety rather than the kind that is packed in water, My husband thought it was "very nice" which is probably the biggest compliment he will ever give about food. I thought it was pretty good too. Looking forward to having the leftovers on a toasted sandwich tomorrow.

This is really good... and this was my first time cooking with tofu. I did press the tofu (extra firm) for about 30 minutes beforehand to get rid of some of the water and used an egg intead of dipping the pieces in water. Fried it up and put it all on a cookie sheet. It was amazing served on top of some angel hair pasta and garlic bread. Will make again!

I made the tofu as a standalone dish (like breaded chicken that you would eat with some sauce).  While it's a very interesting idea, it just didn't really do it for me.  Following the suggestions of some, I patted the tofu slices dry and placed in the freezer for a few hours and ran it over with some boiling water when it was time to use it.  After mixing the crumbs with a few drops of olive oil, it wasn't too difficult to keep them on.  Also, I baked the slices at 350 at the suggestion of one of the reviewers.  We didn't like the resulting texture of the tofu... it was too compressed for our taste, might be a residual effect from the freezing.  Perhaps I'll try not freezing next time.  I'm sure this recipe works much better with the tofu baked in with lots of sauce.

Excellent recipe! It was my first time working with tofu and I was so impressed. I used other reviewers advice and froze the tofu for one hour, used egg to make the bread crumbs stick and then baked in the oven 15 min on each side rather than frying. It was perfect.

Very Good recipe!!  I just became a vegetarian 4 months ago and I'm a college student with a low budget looking for recipes and this was perfect!!  Although on the "cheesy" side, it's a very good meal option that beats the cafeteria.  Goes very well with whole wheat spaghetti and spinach salad.  If you do make it with pasta, however, make extra sauce..  the sauce in the recipe isn't enough.

Okay so this was the first time I EVER eaten tofu, much less prepared it, so I had absolutely no idea what to expect.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I for the sauce I used half plain tomato sauce and half spaghetti sauce w/ a mushroom flavor - that part was really good! But the consistency of the tofu was a problem. I spent almost half the roll of paper towels blotting away moisture from the tofu, but it was still very soft at the end. So the whole thing was kind of a gooey mess. I only froze the tofu for 45 min though, so next time I will try overnight. I'm sure this would be a great recipe for people more experienced with working with tofu though.

Delicious!  As a new vegetarian, I appreciate recipes that allow me to enjoy the foods I used to eat and not use meat products at the same time.  This one definitely fit the bill.  I followed other reviewers' advice about freezing the tofu the night before, and it had a great consistency.  All around excellent recipe.

Recipe was easy to make.  I used spaghetti sauce and added sliced fresh mushrooms.  Also served with angel hair pasta.  Will make again.

Awesome! I made this for a couple friends who had never had tofu before and they LOVED it!! A great dish for beginners, and I did not have to change a thing.

I loved this!  My only adjustments included that I always freeze tofu first, then thaw and squeeze out all the water as I much prefer the texture.    I add a step to the breading technique - I just stuck to what always works for me.  After dipping the tofu in water, I sprinkle it liberally with cornstarch so it forms a sort of light, damp paste first then press it in the breadcrumbs.  I thoroughly enjoyed this and made a couple of extra "cutlets" to just warm up for sandwiches tomorrow.  Like some other reviewers, I had a hard time not eating the whole thing in one sitting.

I normally like tofu but was really disappointed with this. The texture just isn't there, and the crumbs kept falling off even though I soaked the tofu in egg before dipping them in the crumbs.

This is my second rating for this recipe.  I thought that it couldn't get any better!!   I found that substituting diced canned tomatoes (brought to a boil and thickened w/ some corn starch)adds more flavor and texture to this dish and provides for a bit more sauce. I also forgot to add the parmesan to the coating one time and discovered that it is better to sprinkle over the tofu while layering in the baking pan--not so much lost in the pan during the frying step.   Add the "drippings" from the frying step to the top layer of tofu before covering with the last bit of sauce.   I also increased the amount of herbs a "pinch" more to give the dish a bit more flavor.  This remains one of our favorite tofu dishes!!!!

One word... YUMMY!  I'm a strange one, I like tofu.  I like this recipe as well.  I used home-made bread crumbs (I didn't have any other).  It seemed to stick to the tofu quite well.  I made my bread crumbs from 3 oven toasted pieces of wheat bread.  The were moist after putting them in the processor rather than the hard store bought ones.  It worked very well.
Thanks for the recipe!

The kids loved it and it was really easy. I made sure to buy extra firm and coated it in egg before dipping in the bread crumbs. They stayed on pretty well that way. I substituted spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce.

Delicious!!  I don't cook with Tofu often but this is a keeper. My teens were suspicious of the ingredients before tasting but after the first bite, there were no more questions as they quickly cleaned their plates. Only later did they deduct what they had eaten. I served with spaghetti and extra sauce and cheese, but is delicious by itself also. I froze the tofu for 30 min. before slicing, then baked slices 12 minutes as suggested before dipping in ricemilk/flax seed (rather than water) then crumb mixture, then frying. Next time will likely bake rather than fry after coating. I used homemade spaghetti sauce. Thanks for a great recipe.

I decided to follow the recipie exactly instead of doing little fixes like freezing and using egg.  The crumbs did fall off a lot while being fried but was easily fixed by redipping them in more crumbs before baking.  Delicious!!!!

Awesome!!!  This was fantastic!!!  I have only made tofu a few times and it has never turned out very good.  I recently became vegetarian and what a great start for me, this is definitely going to be a regular in our house.  Even my husband, who doesn't care for tofu, loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

The flavoring was okay, I actually added some Cayanne pepper to spice it up a little bit.  I had some bell peppers that needed to be used so I added yellow and green bell peppers to the sauce.  I wish the Tofu would have gotten a little crispier than it did and the breading would not stay on as I tried flipping the Tofu in the pan.  If I try this again, I will try the suggestion from other reviewers and dip the Tofu in egg before dipping in the bread crumbs.  Overall though, the flavor was very good.

Excellent vegetarian recipe. 

Instead of using canned tomato sauce, I used homemade spaghetti sauce. Also, I used extra cheese on top -- romano instead of parmesan, just because I like the flavor better.

The first time I put the sauce in the bottom, too, and found that the breading stayed in the pan and the tofu came out, so the second time, I didn't spread sauce in the bottom of the pan, but sprayed it with a little olive oil, and then just topped the tofu with the sauce. Eureka!!

Very kid friendly too. My 2 and 4 year old love it. They call it Mom's baked pizza.

Also, I like the texture of the tofu better if you freeze and thaw it first. I keep mine in the freezer, and then microwave it in the package for about 3 minutes to thaw, and squeeze out all the water prior to slicing. The texture becomes more chewy and a little more like chicken.

Thanks Jill for a great vegetarian recipe.

This was our first time eating tofu, and not the last.  There was no fooling anyone in my family - the texture is definitely tofu - but if you like it, you'll really like the overall flavor of this dish.  I used my own homemade sauce and plain breadcrumbs and baked the breaded tofu (instead of frying).  One mistake I made was cutting the tofu too thinly - it ended up falling apart while breading.  I might try extra firm tofu next time and make sure I stay to the 1/4 inch slices.  This dish was even better the reheated the next day.  Even my two year-old ate it!

This was fantastic BUT....when I tried to fry the tofu...all of the breadcrumbs came off and left me with an oily mess in my frying pan...instead I baked the breaded tofu first and then added the sauce and cheese and it came out perfect!  I would recommend baking the tofu...the consistency and taste were fantastic!

This was very good but I don't know about it tasting like veal or eggplant...it tastes like tofu which is fine with me since I love it. If you plan to have this with pasta, I recommend you get a jar of spaghetti sauce and use 1/2 for baking and 1/2 for later.  You won't have enough sauce otherwise.

This is a great recipe!  We loved it.  Since we are vegan's I ground flax seed in a coffee grinder and then blended it with rice milk as a replacer for dipping the tofu in egg.  I also used Zesty Herb Grilled Tofu instead of plain.  I dipped it in flour, then the flax seed mixture and then the bread crumbs.  I also baked the tofu for a short while instead of frying it. Worked great.

I froze the extra firm light tofu for 1/2 hour as a previous reviewer posted (since I am allergic to eggs and can't do an egg dip).  I also tried dipping the chilled tofu slices in milk, then flour, and then breadcrumbs.  With the freezing method, the crumbs stuck no problem through the entire process.  With the milk/flour/crumbs method, it was much hard to get them to stick and the coating partially came off in when frying.  The bread coating is not thick, mind you, but once done, it will be delicious.

I found frying in olive oil gave the best flavor.  I used Italian flavored breadcrumbs that had some Parmesan cheese mixed in.  The tofu became warm and very Italian-tasting.

This was VERY satisfying; one 1/4 inch (or so) slice was very filling when combined with some spaghetti for a meal.  Twice I have fried myself two slices (approx 2 by 3", 1/4 inch thick) and could not finish my plate.

Just yummy!  I was looking for a vegetarian way to add protein to such a quick meal (spaghetti) and this fits the bill!

I also fried the entire package of tofu in one batch and froze the cooked slices with some shredded mozzarella on top for future FAST meals!

Good job everyone, I read every tip!

This as really yummy. I used extra firm tofu, dipped in whole wheat flours, then egg beaters then in the crumbs. I think I used a bit more crumbs than the recipe called for. I had a 14 ounce block of tofu and it made 12 nice slices. I baked the slices about 15 minutes per side on a Pam sprayed sheet, then baked again with the sauce and the cheese. I zipped the sauce up a bit with a shot of tabasco. I do think you need more tomato sauce with the recipe.. I added almost another small can. I used soy mozzarella and this came out wonderful. The next day, the texture of the leftovers had improved even more. Terrific way to eat tofu.  Thanks

Wow!  Yum!  This is amazing -- I'd never have thought tofu would be suited to this kind of thing, but it's great.  I recommend using firm water-packed tub style tofu for the most appropriate texture.  I recommend cutting the block of tofu into no more than eight slices (they will be thicker than 1/4") to cut down on the amount of breading and frying you have to do.  As others have said, definitely be sure to dredge the tofu in flour and then in egg before coating in the bread crumb mixture if you want your breading to stick.  It only takes a little bit of oil in a nonstick pan; you don't need to overdo it.

This was delicious! I used homemade tomato sauce and a bit more parmesan than called for. I also halved the recipe, and it turned out very well. I ended up eating the whole thing by myself! A fantastic recipe.

This is a fantasic recipe that my family loves.  I think it's even better with two layers of tofu/sauce/cheese.  This recipe won't suffer if you put more cheese in, either.

All it needed was an extra small can of tomato sauce. I also took out the Parm since Im Vegan and used Soy mozz cheese. It came out fantasic and wonderful. Even my daughter loves it and shes not too fond of tofu. Excellent!

i felt there wasn't enough flavor to it, and the texture was very mushy.  the pieces fell apart very easily.  i'm a big fan of tofu, but not with this recipe.  i think i'll stick with eggplant instead.

This recipe is GREAT.  Kids loved it.  I changed the breading; soak tofu in ice water, dip in flour, then dip in beaten egg (with a little water added) then in bread crumbs.  Fry in pan until golden.

Both kids loved this - I was shocked because they say they don‚Äôt like tofu..... they gobbled it up. ‚ÄúTastes like something from a restaurant!‚Äù  I used prepared marinara rather than bothering with the tomato sauce and other ingredients since I was in a hurry. Also didn‚Äôt have Italian breadcrumbs on hand so I toasted some bread, grated it, and threw in Italian seasoning. I did dip the tofu in egg prior to coating as was recommended here. This will be a staple in our newly vegetarian household...

I first found this recipe years ago when my daughter in middle school was having a sleepover and she had friends that didn't eat meat. The girls all really liked it. Now in my 50's  I have revisited it. (trying to be more healthy in my older age LOL) "fried" my breaded tofu in the air fryer for 10 minutes and used low fat provolone  for the cheese. I did press my tofu as I always do, and tossed it in the freezer for about an hour. Super good!!!

This was great! I pressed my tofu for a bit to remove extra water before dipping in egg and then continuing with the recipe as written. My house of carnivores loved this.

Made this for dinner tonight, the eve of Thanksgiving. I selected the recipe because tofu is always a good low-calorie, high protein alternative!  I used one reviewer's suggestion to bake the tofu prior to coating it and frying it.  I was skeptical as I thought it might make the tofu rubbery.  But it was a very smart step to use as the tofu was mosdef firmer.  Overall the dish was delicious. While I couldn't fool my husband into thinking the tofu was anything else, he actually commented on how much meatier it was, more like a portobello in texture.  Will use this recipe again.   I'd've rated it 4.5 but couldn't figure out how to do that!

Half of my family is vegetarian and half is not.  This is a great basic recipe to make both ways.  I double the recipe and use half of the bread coating for the tofu and half for chicken.  If you work with the tofu first, you'll be able to use only one fry pan.  However, most vegetarians would prefer you bake the tofu and chicken in separate pans. The only change I've made is that I press the water out of the tofu and dip the slices in a beaten egg to before coating it with the bread crumbs.  After the tofu is in the pan and ready for the oven, I repeat the process with two chicken breasts (cut in two thinner slices each). Both can go in the oven at the same time.  Adding pasta marinara on the side makes this a meal the entire family can eat without TWICE the work of two separate meals.  Thanks for a great recipe.

It's a wonderful substitute for chicken parm, as written. I drained, pressed, froze and defrosted my tofu first (already sliced of course).  Made my owned specially seasoned bread crumbs and it fried up beautifully.  Used seasoned diced tomatoes in place of just sauce and topped with a generous amount of mozzarella and Parmesan.  I agree with the others - best tofu recipe yet!

Love love love this. Fairly new to tofu (this was only the 2nd time I've used it) so was grateful for the tips from the other reviewers. I froze slices for 30 min, then used cooking spray to help the breading stick. I went the baking route rather than frying, and the texture was just amazing. Love the cheeses on it, but will probably up the sauce amount a bit next time. Absolutely fantastic recipe; would never know this was tofu!

We used a tofu press, and pressed tofu overnight. We got 16,  1/4" thick slices. As a result we used a 9x13" pan. We also used ready made pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce and the spices. The tofu came out great, very "meat" like texture. Will definitely make it again.

This was my 1st time cooking and eating tofu. A first for my 4yo and husband as well. The fam loved it! I did call it chicken parm and I have yet to be corrected :-) I did the flour,egg, crumb method and baked at 375 for about 10 on each side. I used prego sauce, a mix of spicy sausage and meat sauce with a bit of sugar, fennel, cayenne, oregano, and garlic. I am super sensitive to particular textures, like eggs and mushrooms, and thought the tofu parmigiana had a texture like hard boiled eggs, the white part. The flavor was incredible but I couldn't handle the texture. I will have to make this again for the fam. Great recipe and easily modified for convenience and personal preference.

I pressed my tofu and dipped in scrambled egg/water mixture prior to the bread crumbs(i left  out the Parmesan). I also used leftover canned pasta sauce, and added all the the Parmesan and mozzarella to the top. It was quite tasty! I'd make this again.

This was my first experience with tofu and I enjoyed it. I would cut the tofu a little thicker for easier handling and I'd definitely use a extra firm tofu. You can add whatever spices you want for more flavor, but what's presented here is tasty. I'll be adding this to my staple of meatless meals.

This was so much better than I had even expected. The breading adheres to the tofu, and the consistency has great-feel. And it serves up nicely - looks great, tastes great!

I've never prepared tofu this way and way a little nervous about how it would turn out.  Prep was easy, just be careful in handling the tofu and you'll be fine.  We serve with pasta and some simple salad and the plates were clean and looking for seconds.  Great middle of the week dish.

I made this dish according to the directions. It was a great Italian tofu dish. The only issue I noticed was that the breaking didn't stick to the tofu well.

This is the first time ever buying and making tofu, I like it; this recipe helped give me a great idea. Right now I have no oven only crockpot and grill. So I breaded the tofu, basically followed all directions, but instead of baking it I layered in my crockpot, with the sauce and cheeses. Both of my sons loved it just cooked with breadcrumbs. I can't wait to try it tonight for dinner. (still cookin)

I'm new to tofu and this, as written, was a hit.

I took the tips to get the tofu (extra firm) as dry as possible. I sliced the loaf into three pieces (bigger than 1/4") and placed them on two paper towels on the counter. I topped them with two more paper towels, then a large dinner plate, and plop...the coffee maker went on top of it all. I came back about three hours later and they were perfect, and the towels were drenched.

I also dipped the tofu slices into a beaten egg, then into the crumb mixture. I pan fried them on a very hot skillet (olive oil) and got them quite dark & crispy. 

The sauce was so simple. Be sure to use fresh garlic clove, but the dried oregano is fine (I was generous with it). Allow it to simmer for a good while to thicken it, too.

We had it with veggie pasta tossed in pesto, and a baby spinach, strawberry and toasted almond salad. Superb dinner!

My husband made this the other night. (So, man friendly - lol.) I came home from work and the house smelled divinely of garlic! (I'm sure he used more than the recipe dictated.) It was SO delicious. Didn't miss meat or noodles one bit. A HUGE keeper!

My first venture into cooking with tofu was a smashing success.  Per the advice given in other reviews, I sliced the tofu, placed on baking sheet, and froze until firm.  Removed from freezer and allowed to thaw, then pressed out the liquid.  The texture in the finished dish really was (almost) like using veal.  I was worried about the sauce being bland, but it turned out perfect.  Really tasty!

It is so much easier and less messy to fry the tofu slices to a crisp condition and then add the preheated sauce and cheese without bothering the oven. I regognize that pizza lovers want a crispy cheese, but in my book I need not bother.

I am gluten intolerant and I decided to try out this recipe, however I used a gluten-free imitation bread crumbs that is made from corn meal. Also I didn't have firm tofu (first time I ever bought tofu and had no idea what firm, soft, or medium meant) I used a medium-firm tofu. The flavours at the end were Ok, but if I make this recipe again next time I would definitely skip the whole bread crumbs part!! for me it didn't stick at all to the tofu and it was a mess cooking and browning the tofu... horrible!! I think this was mostly because of the fact that what I used is not real bread crumbs, and the tofu was not the firm type. I have to try this recipe with chicken, it probably wouldn't be as frustrating.

This was suprising delicious! I sprinkled the leftover bread crumb mixture over it before putting the mozzarella on top.  I have a teen that wants to eat less meat and we will be making this again!

We had this for the first time tonight.  Delicious.  I did use whole wheat bread crumbs that I seasoned, added quite a bit more garlic to the sauce, and for the mozzarella, where I would ordinarily use Daiya, I tried a vegan mozz shred from Trader Joe's.  Something I never saw in the store before.  It melted perfectly, and was very tasty.  Not so much right out of the bag.  My husband asked me to double the recipe next time.  We are vegans.

I love tofu and will even eat it raw so I was excited to try this.  Since the bread crumbs didn't stick to the tofu, I just layered it in the dish and it turned out fine.  Both hubby and I enjoyed it.

Delicious! I used a lot more tomato sauce than the recipe called for as I did not find the amount to be enough. I also used vegan cheese (daiya) and vegan parm.

Tried the recipe "as is" and it was really good although I was generous with all the seasoning knowing tofu needs it.  Next time trying the suggestion of another reviewer and building on the breading portion just to vary it.

First time using tofu and my husband loved it!  I used canned Spaghetti sauce and dont skip the mozzerella.  I did the same as everyone but I skipped putting this in the freezer. I will try that next time.  But I coated it with flour, egg and panko then baked at 350 for 15 mins each side and then poured hot spaghetti sauce and cheese over tofu and baked 400 for 20 mins. Served over some whole wheat angel hair pasta and perfect! Thanks!

Love it...I took the advice of Torontois and froze the tofu for 30 mins., dipped it in flour, then egg and last the breading.  It was messy, but worth it.  Then, put it in the oven (350 C) for 30 mins. (15 mins. on each side). Last, I put the tofu on the tomato sauce (below and on top) with cheese on top (I used pepper jack; it added spiciness to the dish. And a little bit of blue cheese; it added a little bit of zing!). Put it on the oven for 20 mins.  It turn out great. Thanks for the recipe.

I wasn't totally crazy about this, but my fiance LOVED it.  He's a huge chicken parmigiana fan (and a bit of a snob about it as he grew up in NY and CT).  He said he liked this dish even better than chicken parm.  Big praise from him.  He raved about the sauce.  
I only changed a few things - used gluten free bread crumbs and used a cheese mixture of parmesan, romano and mozzarella.  It took a very long time to saute the tofu and I had a difficult time getting the crumb mixture to stick to the tofu (possibly because I was using gluten-free crumbs).
I'll make it again because fiance loved it so much.

I am so sorry....but I just think I am not a tofu kind of girl. I have tried making tofu chocolate mousse, tofu loaf and now this recipe which sounded excellent since I love eggplant parm. I was disappointed. I followed the recipe, froze the tofu just like others said to, breaded with flour, egg wash and then ital. breadcrumbs and baked it. I still don't have a knack with the texture of tofu. I'll just stick with veggie versions instead.

Very tasty. I didnt have parmegian or mozzarella, so I used Feta and Swiss cheese instead. I added some more tomato sauce on top too and a little more breadcrumbs. I also sliced zucchini and placed on top with sauce on top of that.

I have made this before and made a few revisions this time.

1) I dipped the tofu in egg before I dipped it in the breadcrumb mixture to help it stick.

2) I recently came across Matt's Mix All Purpose Season. I used it instead of salt and it was fabulous. I found it at www.mattsmix.com.

3) Also I was wondering if poking holes in the tofu might help some of the flavor sink in. Just a thought!

Great recipe! It was the first time I tried cooking with tofu and it turned out amazing. Tastes like chicken! Followed recipe pretty closely with a few adjustments: froze the tofu overnight. Then thawed it, patted dry. Dipped in egg before coating in breadcrumbs. Rest of recipe was followed closely!

GOOD! I followed what other reviews said to do: 
1) Dry Tofu and salt and pepper it
2) Freeze for half an hour
3) Press in flour, then eggs, then the bread crumbs
4) Put in oven for 15 min then take out, flip tofu over and put back in for 15 min
5) REMEMBER to put sauce down first then the tofu and toppings on top. Cook for 20 min
6) I added a bit of Essance toppings at the end and it was delicious!

It¬¥s OK, although I wouldn¬¥t cook or eat it again. The flavours didn¬¥t talk to us, there was nothing special. Maybe the can tomatoe sauce was the turn off. What did remain really tasty were frying the prawns with the breadcrumb mixture, now that we recomend!

Yum!  This recipe is fantastic! I froze the tofu and then baked it instead of frying as others suggested.  Also, use your favorite homemade or store bought pasta sauce, which makes this even tastier.  I made mine and added Italian spices to the tofu.

Tasty! I baked the tofu instead of frying per others suggestions, however I did not freeze the tofu. I will definitely try this next time to give the tofu a better texture. I also had shredded mozzarella and I think to make it extra delicious, I will used sliced next time.

This tofu dish was quite yummy.  I used Elena's version for preparing it with 2 beaten eggs and flour to coat.  I used apprx. 1 cp of panko bread crumbs instead of 1/2 cp.  It is definitely a dish that I will cook again and again, especially during the winter months when using the oven is a must.  Thanks for sharing!

This was just ok. Came out pretty mushy and the breadcrumbs didn't stick to the tofu very well.

I pressed the tofu for about an hour (set a pot on top) and then froze it.  I then dipped it in the egg and then the breadcrumbs, and put it in the oven for 20-30min at 350.  Still had some problems with the breading staying on.  I used Ragu jar for the sauce.  Turned out excellent.  I would make this dish more often but it is a bit time consuming.

Loved it.  I only made it for myself (2 slices of tofu) to try and gave the kids a taste (2 and 4 y/o) and they kept asking for more!!  So I'm making it again tonight using a whole block of firm tofu that I have froze and thawed out, I also floured, egged and crumbed this time as I lost a lot of breadcrumbs in my previous attempt.  Refrigerated the crumbed tofu for an hour and the crumbs stayed on beautifully.
I also assemble the whole dish and let sit in the fridge for about 8 hours before cooking as I find the flavours develop better.
Let's see if my meat lovin' man likes it tonight with mashed spud and steamed veggies.

This is an awesome tofu recipe! I have made it twice. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. It came out perfect, except that the breading fell off of most of the tofu when I fried it. The second time I made it, I took the advice of a reviewer and breaded and baked the tofu on a greased pan previously to frying it. That worked perfectly and saved the breading from falling off. The tofu really absorbed the flavor of the tomato sauce and it really didn't have a strong tofu flavor. Very delicious and easy to make. Amazing!

Big hit with the vegitarian in the house.  I did what was suggested by one of the reviewers and baked the tofu first.  It was really good. The comments were, Mmmmm and I can't believe this is vegetarian,  I have to agree that it was really tasty.  Thanks for posting

I loved this! I followed all of TORONTOIS recommendations, except I did not freeze the tofu...just because of time constraints. This was absolutely delicious! I used the parmesan cheese in the shake container; this did make it too salty and I would do differently next time, but still...amazing!

Absolutely phenomenal recipe. I made this for someone that swears he hates tofu and he LOVED it, not liked it... LOVED IT. I think my tofu is probably better than most though because I use a locally made kettle style tofu that doesn't have to be drained, only rinsed. If you can find a local kettle made tofu BUY IT. I substitute lots of ingredients, but when it comes to tofu I only go with The Bridge (CT. brand). My hat is off to you, Jill, for such an amazing recipe. Sometimes we just cook it up and instead of making lasagna we just dip into sauces. This is one of my FAVORITES ever.

this was a really different way to fix tofu.  Generally, I am fixing it some sort of "asian" type with stir fry.  This was delish.  I will be fixing it again

My bf luved it but wants me to add some kind of meat (i think this will defeat the purpose of using Tofu!!), and more vegis! The taste was pretty good. I'll make again, but this time, as i read in some review, i'll use eggs instead of water, to coat bread crumbs mixture. I think i coated too thin... I had about half of bread crumbs mixture left...

I try to make meatless meals at least once a week - based on the positive reviews I decided to give this one a try. I followed the advice of one of the other reviews & sliced the tofu, froze it & then dipped it in flour, then egg, then crumbs & baked it. My 4 yr old & I would have eaten the tofu just that way it was so tasty! I followed the directions for the rest. I thought it was good, my husband gagged it down (not a tofu fan! ^_^) and my 4 YO said she loved it & wanted to have it for her birthday so everyone could taste how good it was! I'll make this again sometime.

If you're a tofu fan, you'll like this recipe.  I gave four stars because my husband is NOT a tofu fan, so he asked that I not make this again.  I thought the flavor was delicious, and my 3 and 5 year old son's loved it and had seconds!

This is excellent! I press dry the tofu with paper towels and use egg instead of water, but that's the only change. Everyone in my house loves it, including my 11 year old tween and my husband. It's really difficult to find a recipe that they both like. :-)

This was great. I took the advice of a couple other reviews and made the following changes: Cut tofu slices and pressed between paper towels to get the water out Dipped slices in egg, then in bread crumbs, then fried.  I also added some sauteed onions and garlic.  My meat loving hubby said this was a keeper.

This was wonderful! Really loved it! Doesn't taste overly like tofu, it was really filling & felt like a heavy Italian meal. Paired with pasta, was delicious! Changes I made: I used the flour + egg + breadcrumb breading method instead of just breadcrumbs & didn't put the tofu in water as per the recipe. Also baked the tofu for 10 min. on each side in 350 degree oven instead of frying to make it healthier.

Uhhhmazing. I made as directed the first time... but to make it my own/healthier, I started baking the tofu for around 30 minutes instead of frying (I use panko for breading, so no lack of crispiness, not that that matters so much once covered in sauce). I also use jarred pasta sauce and 2% milk Italian blend cheese instead of mozzarella.

Delicious! I even think it tasted better reheated the next day.  Placed the tofu on a bed of pasta. Wonderful meal.

I made this the other day and my husband, the self proclaimed carnivore, had two servings. I used premade pasta sauce instead of the tomato sauce, added garlic powder to the breading and added more oregano than was called for. It came out fantastic!   I'm already planning on making this again, using a different sauce flavour.

Good, and tasty. Not much difference between tofu and eggplant. They both pick up the flavors of everything else and cook down to about the same consistency.

My entire family loved this!! I did use a tomato and herb pasta sauce, much faster, I froze, then thawed the tofu and passed it in flour, egg and the crumbs. Perfect!!

This was very good!  I did as others suggested and egg/floured & crumbed the tofu strips and baked them to get them crispy.  I used a loaf pan too to get the layers.  I added spinach to each layer too.  It was tasty and even prettier!

This was so so delicious! I baked the tofu before frying and the texture was amazing! I also used a jar of pasta sauce instead and added some finely diced mushrooms, red onion, carrot, rad capsicum, green capsicum, zucchini and garlic to the sauce and cooked it in a saucepan for about half an hour. (I couldn't make a vegetarian dish without adding heaps of veggies!) I layered the sauce, cheese then tofu and got two layers out of it. There where no left overs and loads of compliments! I loved it and will make this again and again and again!

This was an easy and delicious quick meal.  I froze the (firm) tofu and then left it to thaw during the day while at work.  When I was ready to cook dinner, I pressed down on the slab of tofu to remove excess water and then cut through the middle (edgeways) of the slab.  I quickly cooked the two slabs in a little olive oil, and sprinkled the slabs with garlic salt whilst they were cooking.  I tipped 1/2 a can of italian herbed tomatoes into the oven dish, added the browned tofu and a sprinkling of parmesan, and then added the remaining tomatoes.  Mozzarella cheese on top, then into the oven for 20 mins.  Served with a green salad for a super speedy, yummy, low carb dinner!  In summer I will add fresh basil leaves when serving.

This recipe is AWESOME!!! I followed another person's suggestion to just push the tofu in the bread crumbs, then spray with cooking spray and coat them again. I was going to bread them normally but i was out of eggs. They baked up nice and crispy and my husband and I really loved the end result. This was the first time my husband really liked a tofu dish!!

Awesome!  Great flavour and texture.  My hubbie is not that fond of tofu and said it was one of the best tofu dishes I have made...he scooped the leftovers for  his lunch the next day.  I will definitely repeat this meal again.

This was one of the best Tofu dishes that I have ever had but I think next time I will just use bottled pasta sauce and I will coat the tofu first with a beaten egg before adding bread crumbs. I highly recommend not putting the tofu in water to soak. Other than those few tweaks, this is a great recipe. My husband and I loved this dish!

This was so amazingly good, I am putting it in my family's top recipe choices.  Filling too.  Thanks to all the reviews, I came up with an alternate style that meant I didn't have to make the casserole.  I simply served the breaded tofu, after baking for 30 minutes over angel hair pasta with vodka sauce.  Yummy simple goodness.

Yum! I didn't have fresh garlic on hand, so I used garlic powder, and I also didn't have tomato sauce on hand so I used spaghetti sauce and it still turned out delicious! I'm eating leftovers at my desk right now :) Delicious!!!

My husband is a huge fan of Eggplant Parm, but I always find it too greasy. This Tofu Parmigiana recipe is fantastic, though. I've fed it to non-vegetarian friends and they never guessed they were eating tofu. 
I recommend freezing (and then thawing) tofu before using it in this recipe. It will make it even firmer and less crumbly. 
Also, the thinner you slice it the better!

Very good--but like others, I had a difficult time getting the breading to stick and stay on during frying.  Others mentioned using egg before breading and I think I'll try that next time.  I also sauteed onions (I add to everything) and zucchini and mushrooms just because I had them and layered those as well and it was marvelous.  I will definitely make again.

This was incredibly delicious!!!  Like others, I dipped my tofu in a mixture of egg (with a little added cream) and then into the breadcrumbs.  I baked those pieces of tofu for 20 minutes at 375¬∫F.  Then, I used a jar of Trader Joe's premade marinara sauce.  I had two layers of tofu.  I baked the whole thing for 30 minutes.  It came out beautifully. Because I used the premade sauce, I didn't add any oregano, basil or garlic.  Also, my breadcrumbs were Italian seasoned, so I didn't add any on that account as well.  I also didn't add any salt or pepper because the sauce and breadcrumbs were salty enough (in fact, a little too salty). This dish turned out amazing and I will definitely make this for many years to come.  I don't ever see the need to use eggplant or veal in place of the  tofu; it's THAT good!  Thanks so much!!!

Great recipe!  I used eggs and bread crumbs on the tofu,  I then baked the tofu at 375 degrees for 20 minutes and then browned on the stovetop.   I served it on thin whole grain pasta....yummy stuff.

This was my first time cooking tofu and this recipe was surprisingly good! I'll probably use extra firm next time; had a problem with the tofu breaking apart. And I used regular spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce. Even my husband, the staunch carnivore, was impressed. Tofu doesn't seem so scary anymore!

I never review but this was a particularly excellent recipe and a great alternative to the endless pasta/rice dishes of our vegetarian diet. Easy 5 out of 5 stars after following the advice to use flour and egg instead of water.  Will try baking it next time.

I've never had success cooking with tofu before but decided to try this anyway..and I'm sure glad I did! I did modify according to other posters' suggestions: I pressed the tofu between paper towels for 25 minutes and then froze for a few hours. I used the flour/egg white/breadcrumb mixture and baked 15 minutes on each side (used Misto sprayer with olive oil for crisp pieces). I also used a blend of FF mozzeralla cheese and 75% reduced fat cabot sharp cheddar to lighten it up. The only drawback was that I ate the entire tray!

Amazing. I prefer more hearty tofu so I pressed it, sliced it and froze it overnight. I also followed everyones tip about dipping in egg/flour/breadcrumbs and baked it on a cookie sheet for about 25 minutes (turning midway through) instead of frying. Served over capellini with salad - wonderful!

I basically followed the review of TORONTOIS and the recipe came out great with those guidelines and a few additional ideas. I sliced my tofu and and placed in between paper towels on a cookie sheet and placed a heavy pan on them for about 25 mins before I placed them in the freezer for about an hour. I used Italian Breadcrumbs and added additional oregano and a bit of paprika. I sprayed quite a bit of Pam on the cookie sheet instead of olive oil and I baked the tofu slices for about 15 mins on each side. I used Trader Joe's Tomato Basil as my sauce. I also sprinkled red pepper flakes on top of the layers of cheese to give it a little kick before placed it back in the oven the second time! Turned out amazing! I will definitely be making this again with these additional recipe tweaks!

This was really nice. I  baked the tofu instead of frying and it was great I also sauteed some mushrooms I wanted to use up and threw them in on top of the tofu before adding the sauce. I asked my boyfriend what he wanted to eat for Easter and he said this! Not very traditional but... good stuff

With the first bite, my reaction was "Oh my God, this is amazing!" I had no idea tofu could be that good. I am NOT a tofu lover but I have been trying to find a way to incorporate it into my diet - it's healthy and there is tons of it where I live (Korea). Well I think I have found the one! This recipe is great! I didn't have tomato sauce so I blended canned diced tomatoes with the spices and garlic - it turned out delicious. You can also play around with the spices a little. I fried the tofu like the recipe instructed and I was perfectly happy with the result. I will try baking next time just to see the difference. I have to say though, I don't think the tofu needs to be crispy for this kind of meal. Soft but chewy (the texture I got after I forgot it in the freezer all night and then just thawed and cooked) was perfect. The flavors of the sauce totally killed the tofu-y flavor that usually turns me off. This is a keeper. I am making it for my boyfriend next time, and maybe even his parents (Korean).

AMAZING! I wish I hadn't waited so long to try this! Only change was to make it Vegan: Left out the cheese. Added nutritional yeast to the bread crumbs for a cheesy flavor. Followed another's suggestion: Baked instead of fried. 15 mins on each side at 350 on an oiled cookie sheet. It was perfect. The baked tofu was a treat itself! Added Smart Grounds to the sauce. Wonderful leftovers. I highly recommend this!

We are first time tofu eaters and we thought this dish was great. We had low expectations about tofu and this exceeded our expectations.  I put salt and pepper on the slices, dipped them in egg, and then italian breadcrumbs. I baked on a oiled cookie sheet at 375 for 20minutes and then used jar-sauce to follow the recipe.

I made the recipe just as stated, ignoring the reviews for how to get the coating to stick. It really was annoying. I would have to say, if I make this again, I would probably just skip the step of frying in the pan. I would put the tofu on the sauce, then press some of the mixture into each tofu slice, then bake for a bit... then add the rest of the sauce & cheese. I think it would be less work...the problem with the crust sticking came mainly when it was time to flip. If I was really quick, it was fine. But it seemed to come apart when I took it out of the pan to serve anyways. Wasn't worth that extra step. --I used a good jarred spaghetti sauce instead of just tomato sauce. Served with a little angel hair pasta and garlic toast. May make again... doesn't top the list though.

Very good recipe for beginners to experts; even those new to tofu.  Omit the salt, the sauce adds enough sodium.  These held their breading well when frying and can almost pass for being chicken.  Meat eaters enjoy this recipe too!

Meh.  It seemed like an awful lot of trouble for not that great of a dish.  I mean - slice, press, freeze for 30 min, flour, egg, crumb, bake 15, turn, bake 15 etc etc.  Too many steps for not that great of a dish.    I love tofu, so I liked the texture quite a bit, but the flavors were pretty bland.  There just wasn't anything special about this.

this was a great recipe!  in addition to all the other updates about patting dry, baking before frying, etc (to improve the texture...which those hints def. helped), I found that marinading the tofu slices in zesty italian dressing before the baking and frying process made the flavor so so good.  well def. make this again!!

The whole family enjoyed this. I followed the advice of other reviewers and dredged in flour, then egg then the breadcrumb mixture. Does not mimic the texture of meat, but that is not a problem for us, as we like the texture of tofu. Will certainly make again.

My family liked this better than I did. I patted the tofu dry after slicing it, froze it, dipped it in egg and seasoned breadcrumbs, fried it in olive oil, then layered with the sauce and cheese as per the recipe. It's a keeper.

I really enjoyed this and was disappointed that SO said 'too much tofu' for his taste.  I'm working it into regular rotation anyway:  Hopefully giving me the extra tofu and him more sauce will suit us both.

The end result was very yummy, but because I'm not used to cooking with tofu the preparation took a really long time.  After reading other reviews, I wrapped the tofu block in paper towels and put a heavy pot  over it for an hour to drain out some water.  Then I sliced it and laid it on a cookie sheet and froze.  To coat the slices in crumbs, I dredged in flour, then egg, then the crumbs, and I baked this at 350.  Were all these extra steps worth it in the end?  I'm not sure, but I will say that although this was a very tasty dinner (and it's great cold too), it would NOT fool anyone into believing they were eating meat.

I prepared this following some of the suggestions from people. I froze, then breaded and baked the tofu-which turned out perfectly.  I made my own pasta sauce and spiced it up quite a bit. It was a pretty dish but it was also one of the blander dishes I've made. I won't be making this one again.

2/4 kids really liked this; my husband did not and I thought it was mediocre. It still was very clearly tofu; it was not a great treat. We won't be making it again. If you're just looking for a way to use up some tofu like we were, keep looking!

I followed others' advice and pressed the slices of tofu with paper towel to absorb moisture, froze for 30 minutes on a cookie sheet, then removed and dipped in egg wash, then crumbs.  I baked the tofu at 350 degrees for 15 minutes each side, on a cookie sheet rubbed lightly with olive oil. The pieces did not break, and came out crispy and delicious. I then layered the ingredients as follows in a large loaf pan: tomato sauce, half the tofu, half the cheese, repeat.  It was wonderful!  I might use 1.5 blocks of tofu next time in order to make two even layers of tofu (I had some spots where there was just sauce).

Froze the tofu. Dipped in beaten egg first, then coated with crushed crackers instead of bread crumbs. Absolutely fanstastic! This is a major winner!

As a recent vegeatarian, this was the first tofu recipe I tried, it was very good.  I would recommend squeezing out excess liquid from tofu before cooking.

It was a great basic, I twicked a bit. Using my own marina sauce..I put my own veggie meat inside. I did take the advice on baking the tofu instead of frying. Other then that It was a great hit!
I usually freeze the tofu before I cook it works a lot better then just cooking it straight.

Breaded tofu...why didn't I ever think of this before?!  This recipe was really good and I would probably be giving it 5 stars if only the amount of tomato sauce was increased just a little bit (it tasted somewhat dry to me).  I added some minced and saut√©ed yellow onion to the tomato mixture and served the dish with some sliced cherry tomatoes.

I also froze the sliced tofu for 30 mins and used eggs to dredge the tofu in before breading.  Instead of making "sauce" I used my favorite jar of spaghetti sauce.  Other than that, followed the directions exactly.  May use garlic salt instead of regular salt next time around, because there WILL be a next time. : ) The was really really good.

This was my first time cooking with tofu and I must say I was impressed.  I dredged the tofu slices in flour, then in egg wash, and then coated in seasoned breadcrumbs.  Pan fried in EVOO and then baked it.  I used extra garlic and fresh basil..  Will be making this again real soon!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is really great. If you serve it over pasta, it does need more sauce than called for. We've tried it both baked and fried and we definitely prefer the fried method. Either way the breading doesn't stay on well, but the texture is much better fried.

Wow this was good and easy!  I'd give it a 5 if the sauce was a little better.  I drained/froze the tofu, sprayed w/ cooking spray breaded it (actually used Zatarans fish fry crumbs all I could find at home), turned the electric skillit on to 400 - sprayed w/ olive oil, sprayed tofu w/ olive oil and pan fryed.  Sprayed tops of tofu angain and flipped.  Stayed together and got brown.  Then layered in loaf pan.  I all ready e-mailed this to a freind thanks!

This was excellent! The first time I have ever had or made tofu. I read through other reviews and adjusted the original recipe some. I froze the tofu for 1/2 hour prior to baking. Baked in the oven for 15 minutes on each side. Served with whole wheat fax spaghetti with a tomato vodka sauce. So good!

This was great.  Made some changes though.  1. Reduced the Parmesan cheese, 2. added 1lb of sliced brown crimini mushrooms (sauteed with onion and sage before adding a layer onto the tofu), 3. used a mixture of breadcrumbs, wheat germ and freshly ground flaxseed to coat the tofu in.  Yummy!

Wonderful. My first time cooking tofu and it was so easy. A nice change from the usual Asian tofu recipes (though they will always be my favorite). Next time I may just plate the sauce and cheese over the tofu right before serving - it lost some of its crunch when I baked it in the oven.

Thought the sauce and the seasoned bread crumbs were great.  But, the texture was still a little off-putting.  It was obviously tofu, even after the pressing and freezing process.  Next time, I'll stick with eggplant when I am in the mood for something parmigiana.

Really good!  Next time I'll freeze the tofu like I usually do - was short on time this time around.  Texture and taste was more like eggplant than meat, but was still good.  I dredged my tofu slices in flour seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder & onion powder, then dipped in egg substitute, then bread crumbs/parmesan mixture.  Worked perfectly and made a beautiful golden crust.  Almost hated to cover it up in sauce!

Bread crumbs fell off as soon as tofu hit the oil.  Coat in egg before breading.

Pretty good - sort of on the order of eggplant parmigiana.  I used a ready-made sauce and served it over spaghetti.  I pressed my tofu, froze it for 20 minutes, and then pressed it again.

This is such an easy and deliciously healthy meal!  I agree with prior comments on making more sauce for the pasta. I also added basil and red pepper flakes in the bread crumb mixture for a little more tang. Yum.

This was my first real tofu recipe and I just loved it.  It tasted very much like my meat lasagne just without the meat.  I'm now ready for more tofu recipes since this one was such a success.

Very good. Instead of putting bread crumbs on the outside of the tofu, I mash the tofu, and mix the bread crumbs with it.

it was a little to dry for my liking. But i would think that was my fault. Drained the tofu a lil to much.
My mom used this recipe, at the same time and made a chicken version for my non vegitatian family members, and they loved it.
It was probablly just my poor cooking.
But even so, it was still quite yummy! I took the leftovers for lunch the next day, and it was still just as good cold!

I made this last night for my family and we all loved it. I used a bottle of spaghetti sauce and it came out delicious. At first, I had trouble with the breadcrumbs falling off so I made sure the tofu sat in the crumbs for a while. Will definitely be making in the future.

Just made this last nite and thought it was great!  My 16yo didn't care for it much (doesn't like parmigiana anything... lol) but her friend loved it - they were shocked when I told them it was tofu. Next time I will make more sauce and serve over spaghetti.  I had some trouble with the breading not sticking to some of the slices but it was still a very good recipe.

This was very delicious!  Everyone who tried it loved the flavor of the sauce and the texture of the tofu.  Unfortunately, it was kind of a hassle to make - the breading didn't really stick to the tofu.  Make sure that you pat the breading on pretty tightly before you drop each slice into the oil.

The only thing that could have made this dish better would be a couple minutes under the broiler to brown the top cheese layer a bit before serving. Very tasty, a solid side dish IMO.

Bland.  I don't know.  Maybe I did something wrong?  I followed the recipe though without changes.  My boyfriend will not touch tofu so I was forced to make some for him with chicken tenderloins instead.  He liked the chicken but complained about the sauce.  So that's why I gave it a two star rating rather then a one.

This was really good. I did make it too salty though. I shouldn't have added extra salt with the parmesan cheese it didn't need anymore. I will be making this again. It was really easy and pretty quick to make.

Suprisingly good!  I would make it again using extra firm tofu (used firm this time).  I did pan fry the breaded tofu before adding to the baking dish.  Good simple flavor to the sauce.

It is Friday night, April 28th and I just made -for the first time- the Tofu Parmigiana.  My husband LOVED IT and so did our friends.  The best part was that no one could tell it was tofu.  It was super easy to make, delicious and light.  I am definitely making it again!!!  Thank you Jill!!

This was so good! It was my first attempt at making tofu, and my second time eating it. I took advice of some people and froze the tofu for 1/2 hour and then fried it in the breadcrumbs. My breadcrumbs did not stick either and I used cold water before dipping them in the breadcrumbs. I poured the extra breadcrumbs on top of the tofu before baking and then used mozzerella cheese, and spaghetti sauce. My boyfriend had never ate tofu before and loved this. Very good. I will use this recipe again.

After reading all the reviews, I wasn't sure about this one...I used milk, instead of water to soak the tofu in.  The bread crumbs did have some trouble sticking BUT this was delicious!

This was fabulous.  I also froze the tofu, and used egg whites so the breading did stick.  My husband had no idea that it was tofu which he would ordinarily turn his nose up at, and he loves it!!  Thanks for sharing, Jill.

This was so good.  The whole family loved it!  My husband told me it was great and told me to make it again, then I told him it was tofu and he changed his mind.  He told me to wait until he was finished eating next time.  LOL :)  This was my first attempt at making tofu, but it tasted great and was not too complicated.  After I sliced the tofu, I patted it between paper towels to remove some of the water and then baked it at 350 until just a little golden brown.  I then dipped it in egg instead of water before putting it in the bread crumb mixture.  Instead of the tomato sauce, I used spaghetti sauce.  I was pleased with the results.  The texture of the finished product was kinda like scrambled eggs.

Wow! I made this for a cooking class I'm taking and everyone LOVED it (even the tofu skeptics!). I took these suggestions from other reviewers: 1) baked tofu slices first 2) dipped tofu in egg, not water 3) used a jar of pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce mixture 4) Added baked sliced mushrooms (baked them with tofu at the beginning) to the sauce. Very easy and tasty!! Thank you!

YUM!  Now for my changes:  1) Drained the tofu for a while. 2) Coated the slices in egg instead of water. 3) Used a chunky Barilla sauce instead of the tomato sauce concoction.  I did have trouble keeping the breading on while dredging them, but none while frying as others did.  I did use a lot more olive oil than called for, so maybe that had something to do with it.  And because of the amount of olive oil used, I think I will try to broil them instead next time.  But there will be a next time!  This is a keeper!

Wonderful recipe.  I added some crushed red pepper for some heat.  Next time I make it I'll add some mushrooms as well.

This dish is delicious!  I used a jar of pasta sauce instead of making my own sauce.  And I sauteed some mushrooms after frying the tofu, sprinkled the mushrooms on top of the dish, and it was yummy!  Hubby loves it too- gobbled it right up!

I'm just starting into Vegitarianism and this recipe was great!  Even my husband - who is scared of tofu - loved this recipe!  I will most definately make it again.  It was not only simple to make, it was also very easy.  Thank you!

We baked ours instead of frying it and used a whole jar of spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce. We froze the tofu and then dipped it in flour, egg then bread crumbs. It was good, but noone was fooled by it. The next day it was delicious. I think if I make it again I might make it a day in advance and just reheat it when I want to serve it.

It was excellent, but I made the mistake of serving it by itself. It definitely needs some pasta with it. I will make it again.

I am always looking for new ways to prepare tofu.  Here are the adjustments I made to this recipe to personalize it to my family's taste.I used chinese tofu right off the bat since it is naturally firmer and easier to fry without falling apart.  I stacked my tofu slices in 3 layers after they'd been fried.  I had some herbed soft cheese in the fridge which I included in the layering process along with the sauce.  Otherwise I followed this recipe to the tee.  It is very simple, easy and good.  I wish all tofu recipes in here were this tasty.

I freezed the Tofu and baked it like other viewers have suggested.  I also used a jar (26oz) of Ragu "tomato and basil" sauce.  My husband loved it while I thought it was a little dry, next time I will cover the pan in foil as i bake it instead.

My kids didn't like it too much, but my husband said it would taste better with more cheese and sauce.  I thought they were pretty good!  I froze them for 30 minutes, then used the flour, egg, bread crumb idea too, plus baking them.

It's hard to rate a recipe when the main ingredient is not one particularly favorable.  If you like tofu then perhaps you will like this recipe.  I didn't like it at all.  The tofu was soggy and it was quite a mess with the dipping...personally tofu is tofu - no matter how you prepare it, it still has that flavor.

A great way to prepare tofu. We really enjoy this recipe. If you do use jar sauce, make sure you choose a good one, since that flavor will really be carrying the recipe!

Awesome...turned out even better than I anticipated!  I'm vegan, so I used vegan parmesan (Soymage) and mozzarella (Follow Your Heart, the company that makes Veganaise, makes wonderful vegan cheeses that melt and taste great).  After baking about 15 minutes, I tossed mine under the broiler for a minute so the top got nice and bubbly and browned.  Vegans, if you miss parmigiana, definitely give this a try!!

I never liked the taste of tofu...until I made this meal!  This dish is better than any parmigiana dish that uses meat and this review is coming from a meat-eater.  I was recently fretting over what to make for the vegetarian that I'm currently dating - I loathe veggies - until I came across this recipe.  It definitely impressed him and scored me some extra points.  I will definitely be making this again. :)

Thanks for the recipe.  Oh, and ladies/gents, I also found that using egg will help the bread crumbs to stick with much more ease.

Fabulous!  Neither my husband or I care for chicken parmigiana, but we loved this!  I took the advice to use egg and flour to hold the breadcrumbs on, and it came out great.  I'd never cooked with tofu before (actually had never even eaten tofu before!), but I certainly will again!  Thanks!

This is such a great recipe!!!!!  I dregded in flour than in egg than in bread crumbs and had no problem with the bread crumbs falling off.  I also just used my favorite spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce.  It turned out great.  I've made it two times in the past 3 weeks.

Tofu parm, oh tofu parm, where have you been all my life?  Granted, mine was a little on the oily side - I kept dumping oil into the pan as I was frying, and a fair amount of the oil was transferred into the baking pan as well.  Alas.  Olive oil is heart-healthy, right?  So it's all good.  Yeah, delicious.  Amazing.  Easy.  I can't wait to make this again.  By the way, I substituted my own pumped-up tomato sauce, which I served atop a side dish of spaghetti squash for a truly yummy meal.

Recipe was great.  My husband was a bit hesitant at first but willing to try...he went back for a second helping.  I did find that the breading was difficult to keep on and some of the tofu crumbled so I took the small pieces and crumbled in with the remaining bread crumbs and browned in the pan after the slices were cooked, I then placed the crumbled mixture on top of the slices before adding the remaining sauce.  I also used my own homemade sauce which is full of fresh veggies which may have added some flavor.

Sorry, but I was not happy with this recipe.  When I fried it, most of the breading came off.  I didn't really like the taste very much either, and it needed more sauce.

I'm only just introducing my husband to tofu and my other attempts have not overly impressed him.  He absolutely raved over this recipe!

This is one of the most excellent dishes I have ever had!!  Gosh this is a truly wonderful dish for us vegetarians.  When the recipe called for breadcrumbs I just tore up pieces of bread and put butter and seasonings on it and put the bread in the oven for 10 minutes.  The bread was still a tad moist and did not stick to the tofu.  Whoops... or so I thought.  It didnt matter that the bread was in the pan side by side the tofu it still turned out great.

I am always looking for GOOD tofu recipes since my fmaily doesn't like tofu. This is a winner! I wouldn't say it could be mistaken for eggplant, but it was a hit! Will make again.

This came out well. Both my husband and I liked it.  I forgot to get mozarella, so I had to make due with parm, but it was still good. I cut the tofu slices a little thicker to prevent breaking, and it worked.  I will definitely make it again.

I tried using low fat cheese.  Wouldn't advise trying that.  It was rubbery.  Otherwise a great recipe.

I loved this!!!  I cut the slices in half, like strips, to avoid breakage and it even turned out crispier when frying.  An excellent tofu recipe!

My only problem was that the tofu kept breaking on me--and I bought the extra-firm.  Still, that didn't really matter in the end and the result was truly delicious!!!  I will definitely make it again--you really DO feel like it's eggplant!

I loved it!  It tasted really good and smelled incredible while baking.  I wouldn't say however that one would not realize it's tofu, I and the person I made it for tasted the tofu, but who cares?  It tasted great and it was easy to make.

My husband wants me to keep making this.  I told my stepdaughter it was "Cheese Parmigiana" and she ate every bite.  We let her know the next day it was really tofu and she still wanted me to make it again.

A very good recipe.  The tofu does take the flavour of the tomatoes and the spices.  A good change from all the soy sauce based recipes I've had. A1 and highly recommended.

I followed the recipe very closely.  The only changes I made were to add crimini mushrooms because I needed to use them before they spoiled, to substitute Trader Joe's Arrabiata sauce for the tomato sauce, and to substitute Spice and Tea Exchange Italian Street Fair herb mix for the oregano.  Served over garlic and herb miracle noodles.  Will definitely fix again!

My first experience with tofu was terrible.  This had to do with how I cooked the tofu.  After making the Tofu Lasagna I am now a lover of Tofu.  I will be searching for more Tofu recipes. The recipe was easy with basic ingredients I had already.  The Tofu Lasagna was delicious.

I almost followed the recipe. I also used the suggestion to bake the slices of tofu before breading and frying.  The texture was fantastic.  Also, I used the standard breading (flour, egg, bread crumbs (+parmesan).  Definitely one of my favorites.

My wife and I are just starting to experiment with meatless cooking (meat is getting too darned expensive!), and since we both love Italian food I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  Unfortunately, I had bought medium firm tofu instead of extra firm, so the slices were a pain to handle (turn while frying, transferring to the baking dish, serving, etc.).  Also, while the sauce and cheese was tasty the tofu was rather bland so next time I think I'll marinate the tofu overnight in a chicken broth or something like that to give it a bit more flavor.  Not withstanding the above criticisms, the dish turned out really well, so we enjoyed it.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Very easy and very delicious recipe. My family really enjoyed it and asked me to make it again even though they're not as fond of tofu as I am. I did change the recipe slightly and used egg to attach the breading to the tofu strips because attaching the breading with only the water didn't work when frying, so I gave up on the frying, re-breaded the tofu and threw it in the oven and it still turned out delicious.

The only thing I would say, cut the tofu into exactly 8 pieces so it fits in the 8x8 pan.

Instead of just soaking the tofu in water and applying breadcrumbs, I dried the tofu as much as possible, and then did the  flour egg breadcrumb situation that you would see with most chicken parm recipes. The result was really good! A little soggy, but that's to be expected with the bake time.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe enough that we'll be making it again.  I tried to stick to the original recipe, but I only had an 8x6 pan, so the 14 slices of tofu I ended up with had to be arranged in two layers, which meant that I had to use more sauce, herbs, and cheese. In essence, I only increased the amount of some of the ingredients. I don't see a need to change anything, unless you want a medium-firm tofu for a slightly creamier texture. If I have shaved Parmesan on hand next time, I'll try that over the grated Parmesan.  I would recommend this recipe to others.

So yummy! Instead of using bread crumbs I used crushed up oat bran cereal and it was so hearty and it really made the tofu crisp up nicely!

As other people suggested I froze the sliced tofu for 30 min. I used the flour, egg and panko breading. I sprayed the breaded tofu with Pam and baked it at 350 degrees for 30 min., turning once after 15 min. I used homemade tomato sauce that I had in the fridge. Very tasty!

Whoever created this needs to work on their measurements.   1. No way will 12 oz of firm tofu, cut into 1/4 inch slices, fit into an 8"x8" pan.  Not in this universe.   2. All the breadcrumbs slide off during frying.  How much force did you use to make it stick?!  3. Tasted okay but nothing special.  Won't waste my tofu on this again

Delicious way to eat tofu!   Thanks for the tips.  Dipped in flour/egg/bread crumbs. Baked in the oven instead of using frying pan.

It was just okay.  Maybe less so, really 2.5 stars, if it were available.  Plated with salad, serves 3-4.

Extremely easy to make. You are in control of the flavor. I made my sauce spicy. And added a little extra seasoning to the breadcrumbs.

I wasn't as blown away by this recipe as many others have been. I thought it had a fair amount of prep work because of the multi-faceted tofu prep before actual baking time began. Also, I didn't think the final result was as splendid as most did. It was certainly edible, but I can't see me making it again.

Phenomenal. I used strained tomatoes (essentially the same as tomato sauce) and even got my carnivorous sister to try it and she loves it, and always asks me to make it again. I absolutely loved it.  

For vegetarian but non-vegan option to make the breadcrumbs stick better when frying use an egg wash.

I loved this recipe, and I've had only a modicum of success with Tofu.  We didn't have anything in the house to eat, so... my hubby who's an avowed meat eater, even loved this. 

I did change it in small ways, in that I didn't use parmagna because it gives me migraines.  I substituted Romano and it was delish.  I also added an egg so that the bread crumbs would stick to the tofu, because I drained it too well. Probably my own fault.  I'll try it again and see.

No changes, served with a side of mostaccioli and tossed green salad. I made on served on Fathers Day, I'm the Dad! My daughter (who is a budding vegetarian) took the leftovers home, a good sign.
Next time, will double the sauce recipe to cover the pasta too.
also will make the slices thicker, which will require more tofu.

This dish was delicious although I did make a few changes  (and a great unusual way to cook tofu) .

Based on another review, I decided to bake the "breaded" tofu rather than frying it.  I dipped the tofu slices in whole wheat flour, then egg, then almond meal prior to baking them for 15 min per side at 350 degrees (olive oil on cookie sheet).  

After baking, I layered sauce (jarred red sauce), tofu then shredded mozzarella cheese (very minimal amount) repeating the layers a second time and topping with parmesan cheese.

This dish was excellent even as leftovers - thank you for sharing the recipe!!!

Easy and good.  I don't fry, only bake.  Dip 1/4 inch tofu slices in egg, then crumbs (no flour).  Also used jarred spaghetti sauce so that made it easier, didn't have to bother adding the garlic etc to the sauce.  Also, I did freeze the tofu slices for 30 mins.

This dish is delicious!  Great flavor and easy to make.  I have a 19 month old so  I did all the prep work during his afternoon nap.  I substituted panko for seasoned breadcrumbs and seasoned the panko with salt, pepper, and Herbs de Provence.

Other than using my own red sauce, I followed this recipe. It was great! I'm not a huge tofu lover, but I was making chicken parm for a dinner party and one guest is a vegetarian. She loved this, too!

Use the egg to dip the tofu, as noted in other reviews, DON"T soak the Tofu in water, user a colander to drain excess water before cutting ii into desired width and coating in bread crumbs.  You will get a better result. VERY delicious but it won't as for eggplant :;

I just want to say I absolutely loved this and will be doing it again soon. Thank you for this clever idea! I mixed the breaded mixture in my sauce and poured it on the tofu that way before sprinkling the shredded cheese on top. Yummmm ?? *notice 2 were gone before I was able to take a picture haha

I made changes in order to veganize this recipe but overall it's a good recipe.  After draining the water from the tofu (it's a must), I marinated the sliced tofu in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, basil & oregano (for 20 mins), breaded than baked for 20 mins at 350.   I cut up Chao Cheese (coconut tofu based cheese) to melt over the baked tofu.  Sauce was tasty.  Thanks for sharing.

This is really good. I added cumin and parsley and used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce (I love sauce). I gave it only four stars because of the lack of crispiness. I'll probably use the flour-and-egg mixture along with the crumbs next time.

Really good and actually pretty easy to make. 

I will say at first it was hard to keep the Bread Crumbs on the Tofu but you really just have to let it sit on one side for awhile. It takes a good minute for it to get browned and stick to the tofu. Good recipe. ^.^

The breading didn't stick so well, but the sauce was amazing (we made up the spice measurements to taste). Would make it again.

Recently my Husband and I decided to make a diet change, this is the first time we have ever had Tofu.  Being inexperienced in cooking with Tofu this dish became a Pasta with Tofu sauce instead of what it was suppose to be.  The breading didn't stick and I fried it slowly, like you would breaded meat. When we were taking it out of the dish and putting it on a bead of pasta I made on the side, in case we didn't like the Tofu, the Tofu fell apart so we just mixed the pasta and Tofu together after tasting the Tofu and liking it.  
In the end we loved the taste and are now Tofu eaters. I most likely will not make this again though as the prep time wasn't worth it in the end. I can just skip the breading/frying part and make Pasta with Tofu Sauce, like one would with a Pasta and Meat Sauce meal.

I squeezed out the tofu block between two plates, then cut it and froze for 30 minutes. After that, I dipped the pieces in flour, egg, and then crumbs and baked for 15 minutes on each side at 350 degrees (total of 30 min). Then put some sauce on the bottom of the square pan, added breaded tofu, cheese, and repeated the layering. 20 minutes at 400 and they were done and delicious. They really tasted and felt like breaded cheese and my wife and I loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious. And using the correct way to prepare the tofu, my family had no idea it was even tofu! And it was their first taste of tofu. I baked the tofu instead of frying and it came out wonderful and alot more healthy. I used 2% cheese and had a wonderful, guilt free meal.

Every time I have made this, everybody loved it.  I make ahead tomato sauce (with onions, garlic, oregano) which I freeze and keep handy for this recipe.  I also freeze the slices of tofu for 30 minutes, dip it in egg and then breadcrumbs.  I use a mix of mozzarella and old cheddar.  Delicious even when reheated.

I made this using the dredge in flour, then eggs, then bread crumbs method that others mentioned.  I froze in slices for about 15 minutes prior.  I baked in over 15 minutes each side, slice turned out nice and crispy.  It was late at night, so I put them in the fridge and the next morning assembled the parmigiana.  It turned out great!  I will definetly make this again.  I also might try alternating layers of eggplant and tofu because I like eggplant parm also!  Thanks.

My pantry is poorly stocked, so I omitted the oregano and basil. I also replaced the mozzarella with Daiya mozzarella-style shreds, which melted quite well (though they don't taste quite the same). Forgot to dunk the tofu in water before coating it, so  it only used about half of the bread crumb mixture.

Despite all these alterations, I thought it tasted great! The next time I have tofu, I'm definitely going to try this again.

This was a simple recipe with good results. My kids loved it! I had to use a lot more EVOO to saute though. I will make this again.

Great recipe although because I did some of the changes as mentioned by others, it took a little more time.  (i.e. I baked the tofu beforehand).  Also, I used Medium tofu (as this is all I had on hand) so I had to be extra careful that it didn't fall apart.  My husband loved it too and he doesn't like tofu.

Really tasty & easy to make..my only problem is the frying of the breaded tofu didn't work for me but that's my own issue (I can never do it lol)! Delish and will make again!

Very tasty. I don't have much experience with tofu, but I took other's suggestions and froze it for a few days first, then thawed it out. I didn't have seasoned breadcrumbs, so I used Panko with a little Italian seasonings in it. I dried the tofu slices out with a paper towel, seasoned them with salt and pepper, dipped them in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs and baked them in the oven at 375 for 20 minutes instead of frying them. Much lighter. I overdid it on the spices, I think I might leave them out entirely next time and just use jarred spaghetti sauce instead. Served up on Angel Hair pasta, perfect complement! You couldn't tell the difference between the tofu and chicken in terms of texture. Very nice recipe.

Great tofu recipe!  Like some of the other reviewers mentioned, you might not realize that there's tofu in the recipe!  I actually like this recipe better with tofu!  I made a few changes.  I used panko, instead of bread crumbs, and used less parmesan.  I also couldn't find an 8 inch square pan, so I used an 8 by 11 pan.  This worked out well because I was able to lay most the tofu slices down in a single layer.  The top was browning within 15 minutes, so I didn't put it in the oven for the full 20 minutes.  Next time, I think we'll make this with some roasted spaghetti squash.  Enjoy this recipe!

My new favorite tofu recipe! Amazing. And I mean it.
No substitutions or adjustments. Honestly, it's perfect exactly the way it is.
Not the prettiest dish, though. x)

Absolutely declicious, even my 5 year old who tends to be picky completely enjoyed it. 
I drained the tofu of excess wate with paper towel and dredged the slices in flour, then egg and then the crumb mixture

This was very enjoyable; not a bit left.  I did as some reviewers suggested and dipped the tofu in egg before the bread crumbs and had no problem with them sticking.  The one thing I did a little differently was to add some garden fresh tomato slices on the top before adding the cheese.  It added a great taste and was a way to use some of the tomatoes I had.  Thanks so much for sharing!  Will be making this again.

"I didn't think tofu could taste so good!" said my husband. I patted dry the tofu slices, dredged them in flour then egg then crumbs as suggested by Elena in the reviews. It tasted so good!!! Will make again for sure.

I just made this tonight and had to come on and write my review. I've made a few tofu dishes before that had good reviews and I've ended up throwing them out. I am a new vegetarian. Due to my poor results in the past, I followed the revised instructions from some of the other reviewers. I drained the tofu and froze overnight. After thawing I used the flour, egg, then breadcrumbs and baked. I then put it in a skillet and fried with Pam. I will probably try with a little olive oil next time. I then put it in the baking dish with sauce and let it sit in the fridge for about 4 hours. I added zucchini and more sauce and then baked. I did use 1 1/2 jars of sauce but I like a lot of sauce. I'll definitely be making this again.

This was fantastic!  I followed the recommendations to bake the tofu instead of fry it, and it was easy and we certainly didn't miss the fat.  Definitely freeze the tofu first to get all the water out of it and improve the texture.  My 2 year old daughter, who is a very picky eater and normally won't touch what we are having for dinner, ate my entire portion of tofu and then stole the leftovers 2 days later.

Amazing! Its a great base recipe. I did save some prep time and use spaghetti sauce. I added some crushed red peppers to the bread mix for some extra spice. This was my first experiment with tofu so I wanted to follow the recipe as closely as I could. Next time I think ill add some mushrooms, onions, black olives, and who knows what else! Very versatile base recipe!

I was incredibly impressed by this dish. The flavors made my taste buds dance. I found I needed a larger skillet to cook all the tofu and may try cooking with a flavored tomato sauce next time for fun, but overall, an incredible dish worth serving to the in-laws.

I was skeptical at first, but this was delicious!  The kids loved it and my meat-loving husband.  I did bake the tofu before breeding and frying.  Great texture.

tasty- I had some left over firm tofu and tried this out... my husband had NO clue that is wasn't meat, until I told him! :) I made sure to pan fry each side before baking it, to make it extra crunchy. Also made my own sauce for more flavor.

My boyfriend and I just had our first bite and I about fell out of my seat. I have never rated a recipe on here before but couldn't even wait to finish the dish before telling you all how amazing it is! I followed the advice of soaking up the water in the tofu with paper towels, then dipping in flour, egg then the breadcrumb mixture and baking for 15 min on each side...  Uh.Mah.Gawd.   So good. Thanks! Now I gotta get back to eating.  ;)

I never had a tofu dish before but was curious to try this because of the great reviews.  Next time I will try baking the tofu a bit then frying since I want a firmer texture, and had a bit of a difficult time keeping the breadcrumb mixture on the tofu during frying...check out the "Most Helpful" reviews to get the ' tweaked' directions.

My vegetarian daughter loved this. Thanks for the recipe. I used the tips from other reviewers to press the moisture out of the tofu and freeze it and it worked very well for me. Thanks!

This turned out great!  My husband is a meat and potatoes guy and LOVED it!  I would definitely make it again.  I did add some extra sause (I used some ragu instead of tomato sauce and then tossed the rest with some pasta I made).  I really pressed the coating into the tofu, which seemed to help it stick.

This is such a great recipe idea! I added spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes to mine. Also, I had leftover bread crumbs when I made it, so I added them to the top layer and sprinkled cheese on top of that. It created a crispy layer which was a nice contrast to the rest of the dish.

I am eating it right now. I cut the recipe to make for one and baked in a single serving dish for 10 minutes. Since I am trying to stick to a vegan diet for the time being, I think I'll try dipping the tofu in egg substitute next time to see if the coating sticks better. But al-in-all -- Yum!

Very good and very simple! Perfect recipe for those who are new to tofu.  I quickly forgot about it being meatless myself! I followed the advice of another review which suggested using cottage cheese instead of mozzarella.  I did just that with nonfat cottage cheese and it was delicious! Made it kind of like a lasagna.  I will use this recipe again, so easy and so flavorful!

This was very yummy! Even my picky boys ate it no problem! I made the sauce with crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, fresh spinach and garlic and let that simmer while I prepped my tofu. I also did as others suggested and dipped tofu in flour, then egg, then bread crumbs and came out great! This was great as leftovers, just had it for lunch with red pepper flakes.

This was so amazing! All I changed was dipping in eggs before the crumbs and refrigerating instead of the cold water and it turned out amazing! All the carnivores and vegetarians loved it.

AWESOME - and I was skeptical at first!  It's surprising how well the tofu goes in this.  I do drain and freeze my tofu first - then thaw it out, and do a flour/egg wash/bread crumbs coating like others suggested.  One of my new favourites.

This was so delicious!  Even my 5 year old loved it.  I modified it a bit.  In addition to taking another reviewer's advice for baking the tofu first (a must!!), I layed it in the baking pan like a lasagna, layering with ingredients such as spinach & FF ricotta.  I ended up with 3 layers of tofu.  Loved it!!

This recipe was very basic, easy to follow, and delicious.  For my husband, who does not like tofu, I used frozen chickenless patties, defrosted, in place of the tofu.  They did not need breading or frying.  I did make half of the recipe with tofu.  I found that the thinner slices of tofu fared better, I recommend slicing it thinner than the recipe suggests.  When I fried the tofu, much of the breading fell off, but it was still delicious.

SO delicious! I sliced my tofu into 6 pieces then pressed it for 1/2 hour between two towels with a cutting board and cans on top for weight. I did use jarred sauce just for convenience but otherwise followed the recipe as is. Really tasty and not difficult to make. I did think the amount of bread crumb mixture was too much. Next time I make this I will use only half the coating ingredients.

This was a great idea, but I did tweak it. I sliced the tofu, pressed the water out by putting it between paper towels with a couple of cast iron skillets on top to weight it down. Then I froze the tofu briefly, then dipped it in flour, egg, bread crumbs and baked it about 15 minutes on each side. I added pepper, salt and garlic powder. I used a jarred sauce (to clean out the frig!) and it has a great taste and texture. I'd eat this again.

This was a good recipe but very simple. I would make it as a side dish. I changed the recipe as others suggested. It is very filling, my boyfriend can never get enough food and he was stuffed even though it looked like there wasn't enough. Oh, and it really does have a chicken-like taste to it. Like chicken with a soy flavour.

So good. I still can't believe I liked tofu. Thanks so much for the technique tip on drying the tofu, then freezing, flour, egg, crumbs & bake. I am going to make more tofu cutlets cause they were so good!!

Yummo!  I did take several reviewers suggestion and froze the tofu...then baked it instead of frying.  The texture turned out similar to a 'chicken nugget'.  I used a can of spaghetti sauce instead for convenience.  My family LOVED it!  I think I'd keep a little sauce in a pan, on the stove top, to add to the spaghetti for people who don't like it so dry.

The initial reviewers were correct: you have to do the whole flour-egg-crumbs process to get a perfect dish.

This is absolutely wonderful! I did make some changes, but think this recipe would be great just as it is written.   My changes were that I sliced the tofu, lightly salted it, and laid it out on a cooling rack to dry out a bit.  I then dipped the tofu slices in egg wash, then into seasoned crumbs, to which I had added extra onion and garlic powder. I baked them in a 350 oven for 20 minutes, then layered them with the sauce and cheese. And, since I had a half carton of cottage cheese that needed to be used up, I mixed it with an egg and some seasoning and layered it into the recipe.  I think this will reheat nicely and be even better the second day, but didn't get a chance to find out, as we ate the whole thing!  Husband and I are eating fewer carbs nowadays, and this is our favorite new lasagna replacement. Thanks so much for this great recipe...it's ones like this keep me coming back to this site!

This was great! Hubby and I really enjoyed it! I used jarred pasta sauce for convenience (I've got a 15 month old and 4 week old, I need quick). I took another reviewer's advice about baking it first and using egg/flour. I made sure to thoroughly season the tofu and flour. Will definitely be making this again. I'm excited to have leftovers today!

Definitely tastes better as leftovers. I think I may make this dish again one day in advance so the flavors have a chance to soak up.  Takes awhile to fry up all the tofu, otherwise easy and pretty yummy.  I actually liked mixing mine up with some stir fry veggies to balance the saltiness with the sweetness of the veggies.

great recipe.  i left off a star simply because the breading didn't stick well to the tofu.  next time i will try the suggestions left by other reviewers to dip it in egg/flour first.  other than that this was delicious and even better then next day.

It was my first time cooking tofu, and what a pleasant surprise it was!  I only had a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce and I used that, proportionately increasing the amount of herbs.  I probably used a little more cheese, too.  I would definitely make this again, and because it was so successful and good, I'm not afraid to look for other tofu recipes too.

This is the 1st time I have used tofu.  This was an excellent recipe.  I thought it was delicious and very similar to chicken.  I did not use parmesan as i didn't have any on hand.  Just mozza and extra garlic.

I, unfortunately, only had soft tofu, but I still tried to bread, fry and bake it.  The taste still turned out really good, even though the tofu was a bit mushy.

Smelled amazing! However, it would have worked much better w/ extra firm tofu instead of just firm, and it took a long time for the tofu to cook in the skillet.

Excellent recipe and very easy to make. I made the following changes. 1. Substituted bread crumbs for "Panko" bread crumbs (Italian Style) 2. Used 1/2 cup "Egg Beaters" instead of cold water to dip tofu before coating with bread crumbs. 3. Did not pre-cook tofu in frying pan, just baked for the indicated time. 4. Instead of combining tomato sauce, I used "Lucini Tuscan Marinara with Roasted Garlic Sauce"

This was an AMAZING recipe.  I'm always trying to find tofu recipes because I'm vegetarian, but usually don't like tofu.  I followed the advice of others by freezing, dredging, baking and then pan frying the tofu slices.  I will be making this again very soon!

I tried this last night and it was great.  I did make some adjustments based on other reviews.  I placed the tofu between paper towels to get the excess water out, dipped in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs and used fresh basil instead of dried.  Boyfriend loved it and so did I!

I followed the recipe as it was posted and it wasn't a huge hit w/ my family.  We're somewhat new vegetarians so maybe we're still getting used to tofu?  I enjoyed it my hubby and three kids turned up their noses (and they like being guinea pigs for my new family dinners).  I might try this again in the future using some of the recommendations from other reviewers.

I was amazed by how well tofu goes in an Italian style dish, since I usually put it in stir-fry or curries. I always freeze and defrost tofu when I want a "meatier" texture, which I did for this dish. This is the kind of recipe that you can easily adapt and not need to follow exact measurements. Definitely will be making again!

I ate two bites and had to push the plate away.  It did not taste good at all.  The breadcrumbs did not hold and the dish was extremely watery, even though I patted the tofu dry.  I think my main problem with the recipe was the texture of the tofu.

I follwed a few reviews..didn't put in water, froze for 30 min, then dredged in flour, then dipped in egg, then crumbs, baked 15 min each side at 350, layered in loaf pan with PASTA sauce, and cheese, baked. I used twice the amount of crumbs, and two eggs to dip. Doesn't really come out to a texture of chicken, but rather mozz cheese again, so that when baked with mozz cheese, it's like cheese on cheese. Next time, I'm just going to omit the sauce and cheese and eat the baked tofu sticks as mock deep fried cheese sticks...tastes the exact same. yummy though, and great with bread as a sub or pasta with more pasta sauce.

Pretty good. I used homemade bread crumbs from some rock hard "Hot Dogs or Hamburger Buns" and seasoned them with Italian Seasoning.

I enjoyed this immensely. The great thing with the tofu it takes on the flavor of whatever you cook it with. But I would definitely bake the tofu and fry it.  The texture is a lot more crisp.

Fantastic recipe.  So easy to make and a great introduction to tofu.  I drained and froze the tofu first to give it a firmer texture, as it thawed I cut it into 1/4" slices.  I also doubled the recipe and layered the tofu.  I put a small amount of sauce in the bottom of the baking dish, put down one layer of breaded tofu, added sauce and cheese, then another layer of breaded tofu and topped with more sauce and cheese.  So yummy!

This was pretty good, but a lot of work, and it didn't taste or look like faux meat, as some have claimed. However, everyone in my mostly non-vegetarian family liked it, except my picky seven-year-old vegetarian daughter, for whom I had chosen the recipe.

I highly enjoyed this recipe, and it was very simple. I have been looking for ways to incorporate more tofu into my diet and this was a great way! :) 
My non-vegetarian family liked it as well. I used egg in the batter as well as milk. I also added more cheese than the original R calls for. (My family are cheese people.)

This was SO good.  I did change a few things, though.  As suggested by other reviewers, I floured, egged and then dipped the tofu into the crumb mixture.  It stuck perfectly.  I also baked it at 350 for 15 minutes for each side instead of frying (was a lot easier this way).  I used provolone instead of mozzarella because that's what I had on hand.  I topped it all with my own marinara and put it on a bed of whole grain spaghetti.  Turned out amazing!  I will certainly be adding this to my regular rotation.

Very good. I did not freeze the tofu like a lot of people did, but I did make sure to get all the moisture out with paper towel. Also instead of water, I beat one egg + added some milk in to make it more liquidy. It worked really well. I baked the tofu on 350, about 15 mins on each side. And followed the rest of the steps according to the recipe. Served this with fettuccine and pasta sauce with vegetables. Great for vegetarians who miss chicken parm!

Followed other users' advice to use flour and spray oil on the tofu before breading. Also baked instead of fried. Next time I'll add mushrooms. Delicious!!

This was a delicious recipe. I did not have dried basil and oregano leaves, so instead of tomato sauce I just used spaghetti sauce  with basil, etc. A lot of variations are available and I think it can be substituted to just your taste. You may not also have to add salt as the sauce may have enough, plus the parmesan cheese you buy may have the salt required. Oh, instead of frying or baking the tofu to insure it is crispy on the outside, I dipped them in oil, then the bread crumbs then grilled them (George Foreman worked fine and was fast). This recipe is delish!

I made this recipe exactly as stated and my husband and I both thought it was good.  It's much better for you than pasta.  I would make this again, but next time I would try a different technique in breading the tofu (as the other reviewers had suggested), as I found that when I baked this all the bread crumbs fell off.

Really good! Probably my favorite way to eat Tofu. Very similar to the Tofu Cacciatore the South Beach Diet - Phase 1 makes available but without the bread crumbs of course. The family won't eat it but it's great for my over-50 new habits I'm working on and makes a great leftover to take to work.

I am trying to reduce the amount of meat my family eats, but my husband is a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy.  I made the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious.  My husband and our 5 and 7 year olds loved it!  If you're not a fan of tofu, make sure to get extra firm tofu and slice it very, very thin.  My husband asked repeatedly how I got the "chicken" so tender!  I can't thank you enough for sharing this recipe!

A little too cheesy but I guess that's the nature of the dish.  Still, it wasn't very flavorful.  I used a 15 oz package of tofu and 1/4 c of bread crumbs was more than enough.  I also didn't use all the cheese.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  It's very easy to make.  I added some sliced mushrooms that I microwaved first to add extra flavor and as a shortcut used prepared sauce.  The trick to getting the bread crumbs to stick is to make sure that the oil is hot enough when browning the tofu slices.

Oh.my.god.  This is so good, I'd rate it a 10 if I could.  Easy and delicious, and, for the tofu bashers in the family, it's hard to tell this is actually tofu.

My goodness this was delicious. As per other reviews, I pressed the tofu and froze overnight. I defrosted using boiling water (which took longer than I expected - next time I will let it defrost naturally for a few hours). I used flour and egg before putting the breadcrumbs. I baked at 350 for 15 minutes and then put the casserole in at 400 for 15 minutes. So yummy - my boyfriend mentioned how good it was several times.

This came out ok, but the recipe wasn't great. It required at least 3 times the bread crumbs and just relying on water to get them to stick was not sufficient. The flavors weren't very interesting. I would have given it three stars, but the diners were split - some thought it was very tasty.

I was really surprised at how well this recipe was received at the dinner table.  Everyone ate it and had seconds.  My husband suggested we add this to the dinner rotation, which he never does.  Thanks for a great recipe that even the meat eaters enjoyed.

It's hard to tell this is even tofu. You could almost pass it off for eggplant parmesean. My family loves it.

This recipe worked very well. I almost always freeze/defrost my tofu anyway because the changed texture is easier to work with. I sliced the tofu and pressed with a paper towel. At that point, after pressing the tofu into bread crumbs, everything stuck just fine...no need for any egg or flour.  

I'm giving this four stars because I really wasn't wild about the sauce. But that's something that can be easily adapted.  The texture of the whole dish was great.

I have tried this recipe two times now and there are never any leftovers!  I follow the recipe but to cut down on the fat/calories I first dip the soy in egg substitute and then bake the soy rather than pan fry.  Thanks for sharing!

This was great!  I froze the cut slices on a cookie sheet for 1/2 hour.  After frying them, I put them on a cookie sheet in the oven without sauce or cheese and baked for about 15 minutes on each side.  These came out wonderfully.  Thank you.

The sauce and topping are delicious, but be really, really careful not to burn your crumbs like I did! :p As for the freezing of the tofu, it definitely changes it's texture to something more meatlike, but I think I'd personally prefer the tofu in it's normal, soft state. I'll try it again that way.

Took a lot of the advice of others by pressing out the water and freezing the tofu and then pouring the boiling water over.  Also baked instead of frying and, used more tomatoe sauce and used whole wheat angel hair pasta or whole wheat extra thin spaghetti. Also used matzo meal in place of the bread crumbs one time-tastes great both ways.  We absolutely love this one!

This was good, but since my husband and I are trying to watch our cholesterol and sodium this is not a dish I would make very often.  Twenty minutes was too long in the oven, dish was almost blackened at the edges, but that's my fault, I should have been watching. Next time I'll start watching after fifteen minutes or so.  I would definitely make this again.  This is a good basic recipe, and practice will probably make perfect with this one.

This is a great recipe!  Both my husband and I are carnivores, but I tried this recipe to use Tofu I initially bought for soup several weeks ago.  I told my husband this was veal, and he NEVER suspected anything different, but had thirds and was trying to reheat the last slice of it yesterday afternoon.  I have been entertaining the idea of going Vegan which may be easier for me than my hubbie.  Well, if I find enough recipes this awesome, I think I may give it a go!

Thanks!

We made this last night.  My wife liked it very much, I thought the flavor was too strong.  Maybe too much parm.  We put the leftovers in the fridge then had them for lunch.  After standing overnight, we warmed them in the micro and then I thought they were great!
Maybe the flavors needed to blend a bit.
I will make it again.

This recipe was great, except my tofu fell apart before I could get it in the pan. I will have to squeeze out a lot more water than I usually have to squeeze out next time, but I will definitely be making it again! Yum. It was better the second day than the first!

Very good. I'm still getting use to the texture of tofu, so the pudding-like mushyness was kind of a turn off.

I have never cooked with tofu before - so I took other reviewers suggestions and bought extra firm tofu and froze it overnight. I let it defrost for 3 hrs but it still was frozen. I took a reviewers suggestion of pouring boiling water to defrost but that still took a while. I used flour, egg, then breadcrumbs in order to make the crumbs stick better.  I also baked prior to sauteeing & also used a jar of Bertolli marinara (I thought tomato sauce would be odd on its own). The finished product was delicious. My husband said it tasted like very tender chicken parm. I would make this again but I would defrost in the microwave next time!

This was just plain wonderful, soooo yummy!  I rarely experiement but I just had to try other variations of this, I added sliced mushrooms over the top layer of tomato sauce and then covered with cheese before baking.  Superb, thanks Jill!

this was great... i was going to make it for a group we had coming for dinner but my husband said "we should make something we have tried before" and he made a different pasta dish.  Later that week I made this for our family and he said "Wow!!  You should have made this for the guests!!"  :)
anyway, a great dish... i love tofu and love finding great new recipes for it!

Great Recipe!  Made it when friends came over to dinner, they're not keen on tofu so I didn't tell them what it was until after they heartily approved of the dish.

This is simply excellent.  I did follow the suggestion of freezing the tofu, which helps makes the texture ideal for this dish.  This is a new favorite in my house and I am looking forward to making it for company.  If I have any complaint, it's that it will give people an unreasonable idea of how good tofu can taste!

This was awesome!  I had some minor difficulty with the coating staying on the tofu, next time I will try baking it instead.  My 5-year-old son, who happens to be a tofu nut, just loved it!  Definitely a keeper.

great recipe.  The texture is great.  i can see how someone would not know this is tofu.  My 11 year old gave it 2 thumbs up as well, and she knew what it was.  this will become a staple recipe for me.

I really like this.  I dredge the tofu in egg like some of the other posters, but otherwise, I follow the recipe just as it's written.  Very, very good!

Tasted fine, this was a simple parmigiana recipe, I don't think tofu works as well as eggplant, though. I think I prefer my tofu most in Asian dishes.

If I could give this recipe six stars, I would.  It is delicious, pure and simple.  The only deviation I made was to use a deep fryer (peanut oil), which really made preparing the tofu easy.

If you're looking for a delicious way to add tofu to your diet, this recipe is a great way to do it.

I just made this for dinner & it was amazing! I am always looking for new ways to prepare tofu & this recipe is definitely a keeper. I didn't have any breadcrumbs on hand so I made my own. I had a little trouble getting them to stick, so I will try the cooking spray suggestion next time. Other than that, I added a small can of sliced olives & it came out perfect! Thank you!

Delicious - I used extra firm tofu, which I cut and browned before coating with breadcrumbs to get some of the water out.  I used an egg wash instead of water, and used panko instead of regular bread crumbs.

Mine turned out all "mushy" and the bread coating fell off and turned out pasty. I think it's because I made the mistake of covering the frying pan for a bit. Surprisingly though, it tasted alright!

Not a huge fan of this, but I had never cooked with tofu.  The recipe intrigued me, thought I'd try it out.  I couldn't get the crumbs to stay on the tofu as I tried to fry them.  I don't know how anyone wouldn't suspect it was tofu, as soon as you cut into it, there's the tofu, plain as can be.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was delicious.  The only thing that annoyed me was the fact that the tofu broke up and the bread crumbs didn't stick on the tofu while frying.  I might try the cooking spray idea that someone mentioned.  Other than that, delicious.

I used egg whites instead of water, baked the tofu and then fried it, and used plain tomato sauce and just added a bunch of different spices.

I had a problem with getting the breadcrumbs to stay on the tofu and was very skeptical when I baked it. However, it still tasted great ,even without all of the bread crumbs. Plus, my husband said he liked it. I will make this again, but next time I will use cooking spray, as others have suggested.

This was my first time cooking, trying tofu. Perhaps I did something wrong, but the breading wouldn't stick to the tofu.  It just kept falling off into the oil.  Therefore, it tasted just like tofu to me!  Not a bad dish, but I was hoping I could transform the tofu a little more.

I don't consider myself a picky eater, but this just didn't do it for me.  Tried the freezing, slicing, baking, before egg and breading.  The crumbs stayed on fine.  It was kind of blah with an odd texture.  Will stick to eggplant.

Absolutely wonderful!!!  I had some marinated mozzarella pieces on hand & added some of them to the shredded cheese topping.  Used homemade spaghetti sauce instead of canned tomato sauce.  Will make often.  

Thanks Jill.

Delicious ! Even meat eaters love this.
The crumbing is a bit messy, but well worth the trouble.
Sometimes I use half tofu and half chicken - allways a treat.

I made this dish on Sunday and my toddler loved it, but husband is the world's pickiest eater and well no dice for him, he ended up making a regular chicken patty.  I loved it, I will do this again if I want a break from chicken!  very tasty.  Also follow the idea of freezing it and dipping in egg instead of water, the texture came out great.  Only problem I had though waas it didn't thaw out enough so it was difficult to cut.  I guess my freezer is too cold!  Other than that this recipe was good. A keeper.

I HATE tofu! And I LOVED this! And so did my husband! I followed the variation that was submitted by Veggiefani1 and it is definitely a keeper! Thanks!

This dish was awesome.  Kids and husband ate it up.  I took the advise of baking the tofu pieces, then dipping in egg before breading and frying.  The tofu was very easy to work with that way.  Also I just used jar sauce for simplicity and worked out great!   Will be passing this one along.

This was my first attempt at cooking with tofu and it was a total success. This recipe is so easy and very tasty. Like, others, I used a purchased pasta sauce, which worked fine. I also had some frozen meatballs that I added prior to the sauce and cheeses for an extra boost of protein. This is a fabulous recipe - whether you are a vegetarian or not. I will definitely make again.

I made this only because I had some tofu to use up and my family was sick of my usual tofu recipes. It was excellent! The whole family loved it, so I've added it to my recipe box.

I thought this was a great idea for tofu.  The tofu was a little difficult to bread but it was tasty.  I added a bunch of veggies to the sauce which helped.

My mother does. not. like tofu (ha!) She looked at this dish and said it looked appetizing. She tasted it and loved it. She even said she wanted more, wanted me to make it again:-) You might need to leave it in a little less time in the oven. Depends on how you like your cheese. I very much enjoyed this recipe, especially having my mother like it, even though it was a tofu dish :-)

I thought the recipe was very good.  I froze the tofu for about 30 mins.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs and a whole jar of Ragu super chunky mushroom pasta sauce in place of the tomato sauce.  I followed the rest of the directions exact.

As a vegetarian, I'm always looking for new ways to incorporate protein into my diet and tofu is the perfect way.  This dish is really delicious and very easy to make. I was worried that it wouldn't taste good reheated, but I liked it even better the second day.

I made a combination of this recipe and Eggplant Parmesan I. I fried the breaded tofu and the eggplant, and placed in a single later over tomato sauce. I then placed the fresh cheeses and basil mixture from the eggplant recipe over both the eggplant and the tofu; there was more than enough for a good sized dollop for every piece. I then drizzled some more tomato sauce over the cheese. It was fantastic! My nine year old ate the tofu, the grownups ate the eggplant, and the baby and I had a little of each.

This recipe is fantastic!  It is just lovely with loads of cheese to melt over the end result.  This is the first tofu recipe that didn't make me gag when I tried it!  Thanks for making vegetarianism a little bit easier.

While looking through my pantry I saw some bread crumbs and remembered that I had some tofu and some leftover pizza sauce in my fridge, so I just had to try this recipe out. It was quick, easy and delicious! I plan on making it for my boyfriend and his non vegetarian roommates as soon as I see them next.

I was initially hesitant to make this because cotton tofu is the only available type where I live, but I cut the slices thin, pressed them for about 30 minutes, and followed the recipe and other tips (flour/egg coating)--it turned out great and the tofu didn't crumble like I was afraid it would.  Perfect when topped with fresh mozzarella and a small side of pasta.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Very good although I think just about anything covered in marinara and cheese would be!  I used leftover spaghetti sauce in lieu of the tomato sauce.

very good- I used extra firm tofu, and experimented with different thicknesses-- I believe that sticking to the 1/4 or smaller is better, otherwise the tofu was a little mushy for me. Made my own tomato sauce, and didnt have an mozzarella so I added extra parmesan on top instead. I will definately be making this again!

I love this recipe! Modified that is. I followed the other suggestions and used flour and egg before I breaded the tofu. I cut out the soaking in cold water step. I can't believe that tofu can be so yummy! And if you think it's great the night you make it, then wait until you reheat and eat the next day. Better the second day!

We thought that this was a great recipe.  I tried breading the tofu by just dipping it into the breadcrumb mixture and frying, but the breading didn't stick very well.  Instead I dipped the tofu in flour, then beaten egg, and then the breadcrumbs.  I ended up using about double the breadcrumb mixture.  Next time I will use extra-firm tofu instead of firm.

It tasted pretty good, but the breading didn't stay on for me at all.  Not even before putting it into the oil.  I'd love to know what I was doing wrong.

This was terrible! I used extra firm tofu but it was still just spaghetti with mush. You could never have guessed the tofu was breaded or mistaken it for eggplant. Sorry but I won't be making this one again!

I got this recipe and my wife surprised me with it for dinner that night.  It was very good.  We served it with steamed green beans and whole wheat garlic/parmesan toast.  I will definately be cooking this again.

Boy, all those who mentioned how hard it is to get the bread crumbs to stick were right! I tried the ice water and I also tried spraying with cooking spray and I only managed to get a very small amount on half of the slices. By then the bread cumbs were starting to clump. I didn't even attempt to fry the tofu since the bread crumbs weren't sticking, but baked them as a few suggested. Perhaps that made the difference, I don't know but the recipe came out dry. Or maybe it was the fact that I didn't put a lid on the casserole dish? The instructions didn't specify cooking with or without the lid so I left it off. (For those of us who are new to cooking, lids on or off need to be clarified!)
BTW, I did follow the advice of a previous reviewer who suggested freezing the tofu first to improve the consistency. This was helpful as the tofu had a good chewy texture. Overall I was pretty disappointed.

This recipe didn't work so well for me. I followed suggestions to spray the tofu and then press it into the breading, which worked really well for coating the tofu. But then I tried to pan fry the tofu and all the breading came off. But even with a bad experience it was a great idea that just needs more experimenting.

I thought this had a nice flavor, but I think my family prefers the traditional "parmigiana" recipes.  I'm glad we tried it, though.  Thanks for sharing it.

This dish was good, but it had way too much basil for my taste. Next time I'd use a lot less Basil and Oregano in the sauce, and it would be excellent.

This was the first time I had ever cooked with tofu, and it was excellent.  Even my boyfiend, who doesn't like anyhting without beef, thought it was great.  I used more sauce than it called for, and it still could have had a little more.  But overall, I thought it was great.

It was good but 1/2 kids the kids liked and 1/2 didn't. I had hard time getting coating to stick on some and although it was good at first I couldn't eat alot. I will probably mess with this recipe alittle becouse it has great potential.

I really enjoyed this recipe, and would make it again soon!  I had trouble getting the breading to stick to the tofu, though, and in the future will use either a little milk or egg to help it stick.  Also, I'll use a little more sauce next time.  But a great recipe overall, for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike!

This has now become a once(or twice)-a-weeker! It is sooo yummy, especially with spicy herbed tofu. I layer them in a 9x9 casserole dish and pour the sauce over top. I used soy mozz. and parm. cheese and none would know the difference. It is even yummier as left overs!

This was a wonderfully tasty tofu recipe!  I like tofu, and am always looking for new recipes.  I must say, out of all the tofu recipes I've tried, this one was the best!  Even my boyfriend, who doesn't usually like tofu, thought this was great.  Thanks, Jill!

I reviewed this recipe before when it had like 50 reviews, now allrecipes is showing no reviews.  How did that happen?  Anyway this is a delicious recipe. I hope no-one misses out on it.  If you like tofu, you will LOVE this. I have made it about 10 times.
