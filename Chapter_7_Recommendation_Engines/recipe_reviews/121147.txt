I followed the recipe exactly.  It does hold up well with cupcake decorating, but you MUST refrigerate the mixture once mixed up.  This makes for better consistency when using decorating tips.

This was a great jumping-off point for the best cream cheese frosting I have ever had. I (kind of) doubled the recipe -- I used 2 8 oz. packages of cream cheese, 3/4 cup butter, doubled the vanilla and used 5 cups of powdered sugar. I mixed everything thoroughly, then chilled the frosting for a couple hours before whipping it again to make it fluffy. This frosted a 2-layer cake with about a cup+ of leftover frosting (after my husband and I tried several fingerfuls).

Personally, I am not a fan of cream cheese but I made a cake from someone who requested cream cheese frosting.  The rave reviews went on for days.  Everyone who tasted the cake loved it and thought the icing was WONDERFUL!!!  Great receipe for cream cheese lovers!  Oh, and I didn't make any changes to the recipe.

WONDERFULLY DELICIOUS!!! I give it more than five stars, this recipe was awesome! Family & friends loved it. I needed a cream cheese frosting for a friend who loves it better than any other type of frosting. But I also needed it to be a consistency perfect for decorating pumpkin cupcakes (family secret, NOT on this site) using the Wilton cake decorating method. With several hours of refrigeration and these couple of modifications it was PERFECT: 1)I didn't have any butter so I used 1/2 cup margarine, no one could tell the difference. 2)I used a full 8 oz package of cream cheese instead of 6 oz.

I'm disappointed with this. The reviews rave so I thought this would be exactly what I was looking for to frost my cake, but it tastes just like canned frosting from the store. It is good nice and creamy, sweet and tasty. But really its too sweet and I only added 4 cups of sugar to it. It tastes EXACTLY like the store bought stuff. I could have saved myself some time and effort.

Not my favorite. Too much confectioners' sugar, not enough cream cheese, and an unnecessary addition of salt.

This is a super easy recipe.I used this to frost my red velvet cake worked out perfectly not to much cream cheese and did not over power the taste of the cake(that's what i was looking for)If u want more of cream cheese taste you can add more cream cheese to your taste but it will make for less stiff frosting,This as is pipes great and holds it shape.If your using salted butter omit the salt.If Using unsalted you do need the salt.

The perfect frosting for decorating sugar cookies, cupcakes, you name it!

I don't think it tastes too sweet, or ANYTHING like store-bought frosting at all. Nor does anyone who has had it. The only thing I can think of is that maybe people were not using full fat cream cheese, as that would certainly effect the flavor.

This was very yummy.  It does do better once you let the icing sit in the fridge a bit.  I only used 3 cups of sugar and it was fine.

I am rating this recipe 4 stars. My changes were to use an 8 ounce package of cream cheese, and 4 cups of powdered sugar. I did keep the vanilla, butter and salt the same. I almost think it was a bit thick, and for frosting bars (what I was using it for), next time I might thin it a bit with some milk. :) I honestly don't think using 5 cups of powdered sugar would have affected it that much, for those who think it is too sweet. I simply used less because my Mother loves a strong cream cheese flavor.

I would give this recipe 4.5 stars if I could.  I tweaked the measurements a bit to get the perfect icing.  I was making a white cake with a lemon filling so I wanted a lemony icing as well.  I added about 2 tbsp. of lemon juice to get the flavour I wanted.  I added more cream cheese then the recipe called for I doubled it but and added a 1/4 cup more butter.  I also cut the salt completely.  I kept the sugar and the vanilla content the same.  It was a real winner.  Not one piece of cake left behind.

Having seen the high rating I decided to try this recipe.
Sorting out the ingredients I thought 5 cups of sugar was an awful lot so I cut it down my 25% as well as leaving out the salt. The mix came out way too sweet. Surely this amount must be a mistake as I think 2 would be enough. I ended up having to add almost  the same amount of cream cheese again to make it actually taste like anything other than sugar.
I won't be using again.

WoW!! Yummy!! This will be my go to recipe for frosting! I did make a few slight changes....used an 8 oz brick of low fat cream cheese: only used 3 c of sugar...this gave me the consistancy i was looking for, and was sweet enough with just a hint of cream cheese. If I were piping it, i might add a little more sugar, or refridgerate for added firmness. Honestly...I HAD to put it in the fridge to keep from eating the whole bowl! LOL. Will never buy storebought frosting again....

I used this recipe to make my first frosting EVER and it couldn't have turned out better! After reading the reviews, I cut the sugar back from 5 to 3 cups of confectioners sugar because my pumpkin cupcakes were going to be sweet enough. Then, I chilled the frosting for about 2 hours before heaving them onto my cupcakes. The frosting is dreamly creamy-Thanks!!!

i just tried this recipe out and i dont get why the salt is needed in the recipe and also it said 5 cups of powdered sugar .. when i made this and added the 5 cups the frosting was still runny so i ended up adding maybe like 10 cups just to get it to start thickening up... i have it cooling in the refrigerator hopefully it thickens up i was planning on using it for cupcakes. but i don't think i will try this again unless anyone has any tricks to add to this recipe...

I ran out of confectioner's sugar while making this recipe and therefore only ended up with 2 cups of sugar in the frosting.  I completely forgot the salt, but I used salted butter, so it probably didn't matter.  I'm positive 5 cups of confectioner's sugar would've been far too sweet for me; I would suggest that you taste as you go with this recipe, as others may consider as much sugar as the recipe calls for to be vital.  This is very simple and quick, but make sure to mix really really well; I still had chunks of cream cheese from not mixing enough at first.  I can't speak to how much this makes to frost cupcakes; I made a full batch but have most of it leftover bc I realized after I'd made it that I still had leftover frosting and so used that first.  I made this to frost LTH's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough+Cupcake=the Best Cupcake.  Ever.  recipe and it went quite well with it.  If you plan to pipe with this, you will need to refrigerate a bit first as it is a tad too runny at room temp.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is so easy and tastes delicious. I did do what others did and cool it in the fridge for a few minutes and then mixed it again before applying to my muffins and also left out the salt. I frosted 18 regular sized muffins and still have about two cups of frosting left. I'm hoping that it freezes well!

This frosting had a great taste, but I don't know how others found it easy to use to decorate.  I had to keep putting it back in the refrigerator to get more firm.  The heat from my hands would turn the frosting too soft in the bag.

Delicious! Now, 5C is a lot of sugar, so start tasting after 3C. For our family, 4C was just right. Many guests commented on the cake frosting. Thank you for this recipe!
Note if you want to use an 8-oz block of cream cheese, add 2T of butter and the proportions will remain the same.

I used this recipe for my Fiance's birthday cake and everyone loved it. Probably the best frosting EVER. I added the juice of two small lemons to it as the cake was lemon also.  And I did use all 5 cups of sugar. I did not think it was too sweet at all. Be sure to place the frosting in the refrigerator before you frost the cake. It is a good consistency that way. This will be my go to recipe for frosting.

DELICIOUS. Super creamy and not so sweet you can't bare it. Not way too much cream cheese either. It was a HUGE hit at a school bake sale, and makes for pretty easy cupcake decorating. Definitely the best cream cheese frosting I've ever made. Fantastic!

Good recipe- so easy and tasty. I will make it again.  The only change I made was I used low-fat cream cheese because that's what I had on hand. I left out the salt but added it in after tasting the finished product- if you use unsalted butter, you do need the salt.  It was a little soft for piping, but I think that was my fault for not letting the cream cheese and butter warm up enough- I wasn't able to mix in all 5 cups of sugar. If I had gotten all the sugar in I'm sure it would have held up better.  The flavor improves with some rest time in the fridge, too. At first it had that powdered sugar taste that most uncooked frostings can have, but after an hour in the fridge  it's much better.

Very disapointed with this recipe.  I expected a more cream cheesey flavor.  It was so hard to spread, I added a few drops of milk.  Quite blah.

YUM!  This was so good.  I'm a sweets lover but I thought 5 cups of powdered sugar would be too much even for me.  I only used 4 (maybe even a little less) and it was wonderful!  This is my new go to cream cheese frosting recipe!

Made this with the 4-year old I nanny for.  She kept wanting to "test" it while we poured in the sugar :)  We used a little more cream cheese than the recipe called for and it turned out wonderfully!!  We used it to put on the zucchini brownies we made immediately after.

I agree that you must use unsalted butter if you are going to add the salt.  I took that advice, and this recipe is WONDERFUL!  I made it to top banana cake, so I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp banana flavoring.  This really put the cake over the top!

I used this frosting on a banana cake.  It was amazing.  I added more cream cheese and powdered sugar than the recipe called for becasue I wanted it to taste really cheesey.  I also sifted the powdered sugar.  I agree that putting it in the refrigerator helps to "stiffen" it up.  It got 5+ stars from my son.

I sifted the powdered sugar first, and whipped it on high for a couple of minutes.  Came out beautifully; this will be my mainstay cream cheese frosting from now on.  The consistency was perfect for spreading.  Not sure where Yucca Valley Baker went wrong because mine came out fabulous.  It also definitely has a distinct cream cheese flavor to it.   I also have to differ with the reviewer that says it tastes like canned frosting.  Absolutely not - waaaay better and fresher than anything from a can!

I still prefer a less "cheezey" version.  This seemed better to me with an additional cup of powdered sugar.

I didn't see the 3oz note so I followed the recipe as written except I used 2 8 oz packages of cream cheese.  It was wonderful.  I used it on cupcakes but I think it'd be perfect for some cinnamon rolls. I think I'll try that with the left overs I have.

This was definitely a great recipe! Refridgerating the icing is essential to bring out the flavor of the cream cheese. I will be making this in the future.
