I was a little skeptical it would set nicely without a little addition which is why I give it only a 4 star rating.  I did add 3/4 c milk and 1/4 c flour and oh wow.  No other changes were made. The flavor partnered with a homemade (or bought I'm sure) caramel sauce was amazing.  I have been asked to make this for a couple people to take to their thanksgiving meals!! Definitely worth making again.
