Deliscous!  A+++++  This was a definite hit at dinner last night.  I made a few substitutions:  
shredded mozzarella for slices,1/4 c. butter instead of 1/2 c., italian bread crumbs, and chicken broth for white wine.  Still came out wonderful.  I baked it for the full 45 minutes for a crunchier coating.  Also, I used unwaxed dental floss instead of toothpicks.  Will make again and again!

This was terrific!  I even passed it on to some of my friends.  Instead of pounding chicken breasts, I always slice chicken horizontally to make two thinner breasts, which makes double the number of roll-ups.  I made my own seasoned breadcrumbs by adding oregano, pepper, parsley, garlic powder, and parmesan cheese.  Definitely will be repeated in our household.  My husband and boys loved it!  Thanks, Amber!

This was pretty good. Unfortunately, a lot of the cheese leaked out while it was baking. The pounding and rolling up of the chicken was a bit messy and troublesome- maybe next time I'll just cut each breast in half thickness-wise, and put the cheese in the middle. Also, the bread crumbs got a bit soggy from baking in the "sauce"- maybe next time I will fry them in some oil to crisp it up a little, and possible use a different sauce to bake them in. But the cheese inside was delicious! (PS I substituted chicken broth for the wine).

This was amazing.  The only thing that I did differently was using fresh mozzarella.  This will definately be a favorite in our house for a long time.  Thanks for the post.

This recipe is great!  I made it for a dinner party and added dethawed frozen spinach in the roll.  Everyone loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

I thought this dish was awfully labor intensive for the end result.  My husband and I both ate it, but agreed that I probably won't make it again.

I loved this recipe.  I thought it was new and delicious.  I have never cooked with wine, mainly because I was never old enough to buy it, but now I am and it was wonderful.  It was a little time consuming the first time, but once you make it a few times it gets faster.  Wonderful recipe

I made this without the sauce and used tomato sauce instead.. It was very good but a little bland, next time I'll use more spices in the breadcrumbs.

This was AWES OME!!!! YUM YUM YUM! I did cut everything in half because it was only my husband and I eating. I DID NOT cut the sauce in half though... So glad I didn't... the sauce was awesome! I also cooked the chicken for 15 minutes covered with foil, added the sauce, and then cooked for another 30 minutes uncovered. So glad I did! The sauce was already starting to "brown" on the sides of the dish from it over cooking. This was seriously restaurant quality!!!! YUM YUM YUM!

This was delicious! I made a few healthy changes by using fat free shredded mozzarella and egg substitute. I also used marinara sauce instead of the white wine sauce. Definately will make this again.

I loved this recipe so much, it turned out delicious!  I tried someone else's tip to not pound the chicken and cut a slit in it and put string cheese in the middle.  That worked out really well for me and made the dish very cheesy and good.  Also, I didn't bother with the flour, I just coated the chicken in egg then in Italian bread crumbs.

I tried this recipe for the first time this weekend, and it was wonderful. I made a few changes: 1) I marinated the chicken for a few hours in extra virgin olive oil, fresh garlic, salt, and pepper. 2) I used thin slices of chicken breast. 3) I used red wine instead of white because that was all I had on hand. 4) I used sprinkle mozzarella cheese instead of slices and they worked just fine. I will definitely use this recipe again. I'll just add more salt.

An excellent dish our entire family loved! I added some extra ingredients to the bread crumbs to bring out more of an italian flavor. With the bread crumbs, I mixed in parmesean cheese, garlic powder, basil & oregano. I didn't measure the extras, just added by eye. Also, be sure to use extra toothpicks if needed before baking to keep the cheese in. Love love LOVE this chicken  : )

Only had mozerella string cheese sticks, so had to use these instead of slices (I grated them in a hand grater).  These have a different texture, so there was no problem with the cheese melting out.  Next time I might try a mixture of regular mozerella & string cheese to see if I can get the perfect consistancy.  Also, I didn't add the sauce to the chicken till close to the end and only spooned a little over the chicken.  The rest I served over the chicken and egg noodles.  Even the kids liked it.

Really good recipe, but a little too much wine in it. I made half with chicken broth and half with wine (separately) because I was cooking for people that don't drink wine. I actually liked the chicken broth one a little better. I think next time I'll make it with a mix of chicken broth and wine.. that would taste best. I had to use shredded cheese.. which was a little too messy. Next time I'll buy the cheese slices like it said to. Thanks for the recipe!

I left out the sauce because I thought it would be too rich. Even without the sauce, it was. It's not something I'll make again, but that's only because of my tastebuds, not because it's a bad recipe.

Any meat dish my daughter will eat gets a 5 star from me! This was easy to make, although I had to use a rolling pin, I don't own a meat hammer, or whatever they are called. I used chicken broth like someone else had suggested. This was delicious, definately I will make it again for my family.

This recipe is just out of this world!  I only needed 2 servings for me and my husband, so cut the recipe down to 2 chicken breasts.  I used Land of Lakes spreadable butter (didnt measure.. just put it on to coat the chicken!) and fresh mozzerella.  For the bread crumbs, I used Progresso Parmesan bread crumbs. I also put in extra garlic (4 cloves) b/c we love garlic.   Lastly, I used chicken brother rather than white wine.  This recipe is a keeper.  Takes a lot of prep work, but well worth it.. will makes this time and time again!

The photo does not match the ingredients. My family rated this recipe 2-3 stars. The recipe seems to mirror a mock chicken parmesan.

Bland, definitely needs salt or more spices. ALSO do not believe that the chicken would be done in 30 minutes, it was more like 45-50 minutes.. for me anyway. I didn't pound the chicken, I sliced them in half (to make half the thickness) and rolled them. Took them out at 30 min and they were still very pink.

Everyone else liked it, the saving grace was the SAUCE, my version of it, and the fact that I added cheeses to the top before baking. Without the sauce and the cheese, would have been a bland nightmare.  I made the garlic/wine sauce, but I felt when I put it over the chicken before placing in the oven, it was too watery and washed off some of the breading. So I used a VERY small amount on the chicken before baking. 

I knew it wasnt going to work, so I just mixed a bottle of Prego in with the mixture, to make a thinner marinara sauce. It turned out really good. I drizzled a little over the chicken before serving. I only gave it 4 stars because everyone else loved it, I didn't. And I had to improvise, A LOT.

This dish was amazing!!! Really moist - everything was great! We used White Zipfandel wine with our sauce and it turned out great! Also...the 3 1/2 cups of flour (we adjusted the dish for 7 people) is a bit too much. You can definitely get away with less flour than the recipe asks for. Great dish. Will make again! :)

This recipe is incredibly easy to make and delicious!!! I substituted chicken broth for the white wine, I skipped buttering the chicken breast as there is enough melted butter. I added crushed almonds to the breading (this was a HUGE hit) and also layered spinach, roasted peppers and a tiny bit of feta cheese for flavor in the center. You can also omit the flour as the breadcrumbs and almonds stick to the chicken with the egg. My boyfriend and I both loved this!!!!

super yummy. The sauce is a classic beurre blanc - no way to go wrong with that, could drizzle it over styrofoam and it would taste delicious. I implore you not to change out the wine for chicken broth as some have done, the sauce is really what elevates this from a kind of basic chicken parm ( no real need to roll the chicken unless you feel like it) to something extra tasty.

I enjoyed the chicken, I cooked for an hour to ensure a crispy crust and also used panko crumbs. Instead of bread crumbs. Husband didn't like the wine taste, said it overwhelmed the chicken. Would probably reduce amount of wine next time.

Surprisingly good!!!  I didn't have enough wine so I used half wine, half chicken broth.  I also used shredded mozz cheese because that's all I had.  Kept everything else the same. Some of the reviews says this is labor intensive but it was super easy to make.  I didn't pound the chicken.  I just sliced my chicken breasts in half to make for a thinner piece of chicken.   Literally took just a few mins to make and so tasty.

I LOVED this! Unfortunetly, my husband doesn't love baked chicken, so he did not.  Very good recipe! Next time, however, I would probably only use about a half cup of wine.  I think the wine was a bit too "present" in the overall taste.

This was delicious. I didn't rub butter on the inside (why do that?), rather sprinkled garlic powder lightly. I was out of fresh garlic, so I simmered the sauce with Two Sister's Outrageous Garlic, using a Chardonnay. YUMMY!

My recipe calls for 1 bag of frozen unbreaded chicken tenders. Place in a glass baking dish. Add a tsp of minced garlic to the top of chicken. Cover the chicken with 2 jars of spaghetti sauce and 1- 16 oz. bag of mozzarella cheese, shredded. Throw in the oven at 350 for 1 hour. When chicken is done, place over cooked spaghetti and top with Parmesan cheese. Very simple, quick and everyone loves this. Nothing to do once it gets put in the oven, just remove after 1 hour.

Unbelievable!  Used Panko brea crumbs, and stuffed with combo of provolone and mozzerella.  Didn't make any other changes.  Completely awesome and easy.  This is also the kind of recipe that is so versatile, next time I might try a combo of goat cheese and fresh basil, or mozzerella and asparagus tips, etc.  Really, really good!

Another great chicken dish! I used grated mozzarella and added garlic powder, season salt, and onion powder. My wonderful boyfriend came back from the store with colored toothpicks so needless to say this dish was tastey and quite colorful!

Loved this! I passed along the recipe to my sister too and it was a hit in her family. For all of you omitting the wine in the recipe you are missing out - the sauce really makes this recipe what it is! If you want a healthier version of this use less margarine and low fat cheese - do not omit the wine or garlic!

Great dish!!! I had to change dinner plans last minute and found this recipe. I didn't have white wine so I used beef broth (all i had) and I used shredded Mexican Queso Quesadilla cheese instead of the sliced mozzarella. My husband was sooo impressed!! I served it with pan fried yellow squash (thinly sliced, seasoned with salt and pepper, then pan fried in some butter and olive oil till nice and tender and slightly browned) and white rice. I pored the sauce of the chicken over the rice and it was the perfect combination. Thanks so much for posting this recipe!!! It saved the night and I will definitely make it again!!

Love this chicken! Followed recipe. The only thing I did differently was used italian bread crumbs and added parmesan cheese to the breading. Used seasoned salt and a little onion powder.

It's really good, I have made it twice the first time I made it it was ok I didn't like the cheese. So the second time I made it I used provolone chesse I also put 3 slices in one chicken, and for the bread crumbs I used garlic and herb and OMG yum. I also used buttermilk and not the egg. I gave it 4 because I changed things to make it better.

This was by far the best meal I have ever cooked!  I followed the recipe although I had the butcher fillet my chicken so i could easily roll it with the cheese inside I also used string cheese in the middle. The white wine really made this dish special. My fiance' was amazed def a family fav!

My family & friends loved this dish.  I thought the wine sauce was delicious.  I used toothpicks while breading the chicken, then switched to bamboo sticks cut in half when I actually baked it. Although this dish has many steps it is well worth it.

Very very good! Made it for myself and my fiance and he liked it! Will def make again. I did make a few changes. I used Italian style breadcrumbs and think it added a good taste. I also too advice of others on here and used the sauce as dipping sauce because i didnt want it to be soggy. When i got it out of the over i put about 2tbs over the chicken and used the rest to dip. Next time i will puund the meat a little more so i can wrap it better so the cheese doesnt melt out and make less sauce. I also used swiss cheese instead of mozzerala... Was very good!!

The first time I made the recipe as written and we enjoyed it. The second time I used a chicken breading recipe I got from my mom, and I think it made a big difference in the flavor. Also, the second time, I didn't have any mozzarella cheese, but i had some string cheese sticks, so I thought "What the heck" and I used them instead. It was so easy and good! I just took the chicken breasts and instead of pounding them out, I just cut a slit in the middle and slid the string cheese inside. It saved a lot of time, and the cheese stayed in the chicken a lot better. I am going to do it this way from now on!

Just ok - not a whole lot of flavor but if you want mild and easy this is for you. Be sure to use a drinkable white wine. It is true that a wine's flavor concentrates when cooking. Bad wine = bad flavor. But this recipe is a good base recipe to play with. Next time I make it I might use Fontina cheese, Italian seasoning and maybe some chicken stock and cream with the wine sauce. I'd also probably just roast the chicken separately then pour the sauce over it.

I love cheese and I love chicken, so this recipe was perfect for me!  I really liked the cheesy garlic flavor. The first breast that I used was way too big, so if possible I would recommend using smaller breasts for this recipe. Also, I left out the wine and just drizzled a butter garlic sauce on them before baking. I have made this twice already.

My family loved this recipe!  The sauce was a bit thin, but it did not take away from the taste.  I will make this again often.

I agree with using thin sliced chicken fillets instead of messing with pounding out regular breasts.  I used half the amount of sauce so the bottom of the chicken wouldn't get soggy in the pan.  Next time, I might add a little flour to the sauce to thicken it up.  But overall, this was really good and worth the effort!

This recipe took some work and a lot of dishes to prepare but it turned out well.  I didn't have the wine so I used white wine vinegar instead, though I think I will try using wine next time.  I could only find two chicken breasts at the store so I made the recipe with two chicken breasts and turkey breasts and both meats tasted good.

Very tasty.   Pounding the chicken made it so tender, and the combination of the mozzarella, garlic, butter, breadcrumbs were terrific.  Will definitely make this again.

I altered the recipe a good bit, but it came out decently for a first attempt. We added a slice of prosciutto and fresh spinach and a little sharp cheddar cheese to the mozzarella when rolling up the chicken breasts. I chose to use Kraft's Oven Fry breading to coat the chicken and cooked on 375 for 30-40 minutes. The sauce tasted all right, though we added it to egg noodles instead of pouring much on the chicken breasts. Came out reasonably good.

Excellent recipe!!! This will definitely be added to the rotation. So tender and juicy it cut with a fork. The only change we had to make since we did not have the wine we substituted a can of Rotel and it turned out great.

This chicken was amazing!! I was using leftovers from an italian restaurant we went to last night as a side dish so I made this chicken.  Instead of the sauce I waited til the chicken was pretty much done and topped the chicken breasts off with some spaghetti sauce and a little piece of mozz. cheese so it was similar to chicken parm.  Hubby said this was one of the best dishes I've ever made. :) Thank you so much for the recipe.

It was really good and easy to make. I changed a few things, i added more cheese which made it harder to close the chicken and pin it down with the toothpick and I also used less butter, alot less. I cooked it for 40 mins and it came out very juicy.

Excellent!  I kept it pretty much the same, just added garlic powder when I salted and peppered, and used shredded mozz instead of sliced.  I baked it 30 minutes, then put it in the broiler for a few minutes to crisp it up.  Everyone loved it and there were no leftovers.  Will surely make it again!

I made this for dinner last night and was a little nervous because I've never rolled up chicken....it was wonderful and it was so easy! I used shredded mozzarella instead of slices because that's what I had on hand...next time, I'll try the slices..."Yummy" was the opinion of my family.

Wow! This is probably the best chicken I've ever made! Instead of pounding and rolling the chicken I cut it in half and put sliced mozzarella in between the two halves. There was no need for toothpicks or floss to hold it together, I just set it in the pan. Also, I baked it for 30 mins. and then broiled it for an extra 3 mins. to give it a little crunchiness and a beautiful golden brown color. A huge hit with my family! A+ on taste and presentation! Next time I'll leave out the salt though (there's enough in the bread crumbs alone).

This was good but i think i ate part of a toothpick.they were hard to find. Think i will lay chicken flat and then the cheese and top with other breast next time.Also use Swiss cheese and mozzarella. I used a med. white sauce and garlic,kinda bland,but ok.

I didn't expect so much flavor.  My whole family loved it, even my chicken-breast-hating husband!  My 2 & 4 yr. old thought it was great.  Will definitely make again and again.  I used chicken broth instead of wine, as well.

This was pretty good. I didn't have any white wine, so I took another reviewers' tip and used chicken broth. The sauce turned out pretty good, and the chicken was really moist. I think that next time I will go out to buy seasoned bread crumbs instead of using the orginal that I had on hand. I seasoned it, but I think that it didn't do it justice. ::REVISE:: So I had seasoned bread crumbs this time and the chicken was really good. Fed it to my house of picky eaters and they all loved it.

Because I made a prepping error, I gave this recipe a one-star handicap...it tasted like a 3-star recipe, but that might have been my fault. ;) 

My husband, who is not a fan of chicken, said it was good. Even without that prep error, though, I found this meal a bit dry and bland. I would like to make it again and give it another chance, but next time I will probably add some other seasonings besides salt and pepper.

This recipe was fantastic!!! I received rave reviews from the rest of my family too. Instead of dry white wine, I used red cooking wine which gave it an authentic Italian taste. Great recipe to use when wining and dining!

This is a great way to dress up the everyday chicken breast. I substituted fresh mozzarella and also added some prosciutto and basil  to the stuffing. A new regular in our house!

To thicken the sauce I added the extra flour from dredging. Unless you want chicken soup, don't make this without adding flour to the sauce.

This recipe has fast become a family favorite.  I use a little extra mozz cheese, but other than that I follow the recipe exactly.  The only thing I've noticed is to make sure the wine you use isn't too strong or it over powers the dish.  I make this dish about once a month for my crew!

This was great! Everybody loved it and couldn't wait to dig in because it smelled so delicious, and it even tasted better than it smelled. This is a new family favorite! I can't see how anyone thought this wasn't flavorful, maybe they should have added more garlic, I used 3 good sized cloves, and I didn't have the wine so I used apple juice instead. It was bursting with flavor! This was so fast and easy to make, and you are bound to have all the ingredients in your cupboards. I would suggest it to everyone.

Not bad, but certainly nothing to write home about.  Overall, it was bland.  I picked the recipe because it sounded similar to one that I make with Monterey Jack cheese and cilantro in the middle and rolled in a mixture of corn meal and taco seasoning.  I guess I was spoiled by that recipe.

Not bad, but needs to be tweaked. It needs a little more flavor. I added a little lemon juice to the sauce, and subbed chicken stock for the wine. 

Some hints: Use thin-sliced chicken cutlets. They stay rolled w/o toothpicks.  Buttering the chicken before adding the cheese does nothing. Skip it. Add a little garlic and/or fresh basil to the cheese. 

When I make it again, I want to try making the sauce thicker and maybe adding more garlic. Or using half wine, half chicken stock.

Very yummy! I thought it would take awhile to prepare, but it was fairly quick. I used seasoned bread crumbs, and baked the chicken without the wine. I served it with marinara sauce over the top of the rolled up chicken.

Absolutely delicious. I was a bit hesitant with cooking breaded chicken in the oven with the sauce, thought it may make the chicken a bit mushy. Not at all. And the sauce is definitely the star. My house smelled delicious as it was baking! Hubby loved it too so it's a keeper. I didn't change a thing, theres no need to. Will definately be making this again soon. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Great chicken.  Different enough to create a new spin on our ordinary dinners...but, safe enough to try with picky eaters. I was generous with the mozzarella, pepper and garlic!  I would recommend this!  Note: I baked with foil cover and then removed it for the last 10 to brown the top.

I made this and received ZERO complaints from my three very picky children and husband. I had no leftovers. I followed the recipe but used fresh mozzarella and Panko breadcrumbs that I seasoned myself. I made the sauce with half wine half chicken stock and did not put it on until the end so the coating stayed crispy. Cooking time was a little long but I will definitely make again since they enjoyed it.

Some of the other customizations were very helpful. I followed the advice of the people who substituted chicken broth for white wine, Someone else recommended Prosciutto, which I put on top of the Mozzarella to help keep it from seeping out. I also didn't use butter on the flattened chicken before adding salt and pepper. I mixed some garlic paste with olive oil and painted it on with a basting brush , then the salt and pepper, Mozzarella and then the Prosciutto.  Definitely labor intensive, but well worth it.

I wasn't sure that baking, and not pan frying, would result in a crunch coating.  It did!  I did change the recipe quite a bit.  I sautéed some fresh spinach and garlic, and layered that on the chicken.  I used smoked mozzarella for the cheese.  After assembling, I baked for 30 minutes without sauce to keep the crunch.  While baking, I sliced some mushrooms, sautéed them, added some white wine and simmered.  I took the chicken out of the oven, spooned the sauce on, topped with some slice tomato, and returned to the oven for 10 more minutes.  AMAZING!  Thanks for the inspiration!

We loved this dish! The chicken came out very tender and the sauce was very good as well. We added some provolone also just because we had some on hand and it was perfect!

This was really good. I didn't have any white wine so I just used chicken broth. The chicken was really moist. Will make again.

This was good but a lot of work. I used dental floss to tie up the rolled chicken as someone suggested. I thought this would be easier than toothpicks but the dental floss was hard to tie and keep the rolls intact. Need two people for floss, will use toothpicks if I make it again. Thanks for sharing!

Nothing fancy about this recipe- just a moist, delicious and very filling meal. I substituted the dry white wine with chicken broth and used tenderloins instead of ch breasts.

Very good! Next time I will just slice the chicken in half and put the cheeses in like a sandwich. Kinda hard to roll and keep together.

Husband cooked, wife approved! This wasn't a difficult recipe at all and will become a staple in our home. I replaced wine with chicken broth and cooked a little extra time for a more crunchy taste. Fantastic.

I made this almost exactly according to the recipe. The sauce is the stunner. Sooooo good. I can't wait to make it again. Only thing I did differently was sliced chicken thinner instead of beating them. I also skipped the flour dip. So amazing. I may spice the simple Italian breadcrumbs up a little next time but with the sauce it really doesn't need it.

Really good.  I'm too lazy to roll them, so I laid the chicken out flat and put the ingredients on top.  Everyone loved it, including the picky eaters.

This was a great recipe! I tweaked it just a bit to add more flavor. I used 1/2 a cup of dry cooking white wine and half a cup of white wine rice vinegar. I also added pepper jack cheese to the mozzarella to give it a little spice. Chicken was so good!!! Everyone loved it!

I have made this recipe for years and I have never made the sauce or put any liquid in it, just cooked it as is and it's a staple in our house, one of our faves! Gave it 4 stars only because I don't cook it exactly according to the recipe.

Very easy and delicious recipe. My husband says it taste like baked chicken fried chicken with a kick. It is one of his favorites and since it is baked and not fried, it is healthier. I make this often and add a green bean casserole, house salad, and rolls to complete the meal. Definitely worth trying.

good recipe! I would change a few things next time like not using as much butter and maybe adding sundried tomatoes with the mozzarella on the inside. My kids loved it all 5 of them so it is definitely a keeper.

great recipe, chickent had great flavor...the second time i tried not rolling the chicken, just folding it over, but it came out too dry.  Maybe next time I'll use less butter and more olive oil.  For sure a repeat dinner!

This was REALLY good. My adjustments were: shredded mozzarella since I had it on hand and I added a minced shallot to the garlic/wine sauce when I melted the butter, and I added pepper, oregano, parmesean cheese, garlic powder, touch of rosemary and thyme to the bread crumbs. Noting that another reader mentioned something about sogginness, I did pour the sauce over the chicken, then in the last 3 or so mins, turned the broiler on to crisp up the top crust. It was perfect! I served with a ceasar salad and got rave reviews. I did have a hard time securing this with toothpicks tho...looked like frankenstein chicken!

I made this chicken for dinner last night, however I didn't make the sauce as I didn't have the ingredients on hand, so I am not reviewing that portion of the recipe.  The recipe was very easy to make, not very time consuming and the end result was delicious.  I make my own bread crumbs, so the coating had a little more texture than it might if you used store bought bread crumbs.  I also used grated mozzerella cheese instead of sliced.   The end result was perfect, we eat a LOT of chicken, and this recipe will become a staple for us, DELICIOUS!!!!

This was amazing! The only thing I did differently was use chicken broth instead of dry white wine, because that was readily available to me. Cooked it for 40 minutes, and the bread crumbs were perfectly crunchy. I will definitely make this again. I paired it with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans - a wonderful meal!

I found this recipe as I was looking for a quick and easy way to make chicken for dinner. As I started making it, I realized I didn't have any bread crumbs but went ahead with it anyway. I didn't pound out the breasts; I just cut them in half and opened them up. I stuffed and rolled them up as directed, adding only parmesan cheese to it, and then baked them with tomatoe sauce poured over top of them. Everybody loved it! Next time I will definitely make sure I have all the ingredients to make it, though, so I can do it the right way. But still, awesome recipe. Thanks!

Wow.  Didn't expect a meal that was so flavorful!  I used shredded cheddar because I had it on hand.  They looked great even before I cooked them.  Love the smell of them as they were cooking.  I used Chardonnay, which worked wonderfully.  This chicken was moist, filling and oh so delish!!  I have printed this one and added it to my favorites!  Thanks you for sharing!!!

The chicken was moist, but overall nothing spectacular tasting. The taste of the slice of mozzarella  and the minced garlic get lost in the chicken.Perhaps more cheese and more garlic might zip the recipe up a bit. Thanks for sharing

This was very good.  We used shredded mozzarella and next time I will be sure to purchase sliced.  The shredded cheese melted out of the chicken and was almost gone when we ate it.  We will make this again.

Fantastic!  The only modification I made was using chicken cutlets instead of pounding out the chicken breasts.  I will most definitely be serving this dish again and again!  Superb!

The four-star rating is given for the quality of cooking instructions, not the actual recipe.   As far as the recipe is concerned, we modified things a bit.   1. We rinsed off the thawed chicken with water, then greased three skinless breasts with Country Crock butter. We used the waxed paper to simply place the breasts on to soak up any more butter while we prepared three plates-- one containing the flour, one containing one egg (next time we'll use two eggs), and the last containing bread crumbs.   2. We then sequentially rolled each buttered chicken breast in the flour, then the egg, then the bread crumbs. The evenly breaded chicken breasts were then placed in a 9" x 13" pyrex baking dish (which was lightly greased with Pam). Once all three breasts were placed into the baking dish, the top surfaces of each breast were covered with a deli-slice of Boar's Head mozarella cheese.   3. In a separate small pan, we poured 1 cup of wine (chilled chardonnay) and 1/4 cup of butter (country crock). To this mixture was added the minced garlic, about 1/2 teaspoon of oregano and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt. This pan was covered and simmered for about 5 mins until all of the butter had melted and the mixture could be easily stirred.   4. The wine sauce was then poured over the cheese-covered chicken breasts and any large garlic cloves were pushed off of the cheese surface into the sauce. The pan was placed into the oven (preheated to 350) and baked uncovered for 45 mins.   5. The chicken

Great recipe! Huge hit with my in-laws! I've made it over 5 time, each time i tried something different.I spiced it up  a bit and used pepper jack cheese instead of mozzarella(my hubby likes it this way the best). Gave it a lot of flavor! I also rolled a slice of bacon into each breast with the cheese and this turned out awesome too. I prefer using boneless thighs (cheaper) and it turned out juicier than using breasts. Oh and i feel like the chicken broth gives a better flavor than the wine. Thanx!!

Loved this chicken. I followed other raters advice and sliced the chicken instead of pounding it. I also used fresh mozzerella. 
I am making it again tonight and am doubling the wine sauce and reserving some to pour on after it is done cooking. Thanks for the great recipe!

First let me say I only give a 5 star for those that are "Thank God for this food!"

I have tried this recipe with both a dry white wine and a cooking sherry and my family prefers it with sherry.  It would rank a 3.5 with white wine.

OMG!! This was fantastic, it's alot of work though so I wouldn't make this on a regular basis. I used half the butter it called for and a little more wine:) I also seasoned with oregano and put about six bay leaves in the pan with the chicken, which I think added a nice flavor. Was surprised it came out as good as it sounded! Will make again.

I made this recipe for the adults last week.  I let both my kids try it, my older son can be especially fussy so I made them some regular chicken cutlets instead.  Well I had to make the recipe again tonight because they both LOVED it so much & have been BEGGING for it!  I have never seen my kids clear their plates so fast, my son was actually licking it clean.  Only thing I changed was I cut the chicken thinner to make more & make each piece a bit more cheesy.  I also put it on low broil the last 3-5 minutes to give the top a tiny crunch.  Best new recipe I have made in a LONG time & I make at least 1 new recipe a month.

There are a few things in this world as far as cooking that I think you can't go wrong with;  that is cheese, mushrooms, garlic or sour cream.. Give me one or all of these and I usually love it.  This is no different  I give it 2 thumbs up...

I made this recipe with a couple alterations.  I put ham inside the chicken to make it more of a "cordon bleu" (sp?).  I didn't have wine and used chicken broth as advised by others.  I didn't like the sauce and could have done without it or used heavy cream as a base.  Overall, it was very good but I will probably try a different recipe next time.  Thanks

Excellent! This is very tasty, pretty easy to make and quick cooking.  Very yummy and even kinda sophisticated seeming. The only problem I had was finding all the toothpicks afterwards to pull them out. Next time I may try something different. But I will definitely be doing this one again. Thanks!

Excellent Chicken! I used chicken broth instead of wine per other reviewers.  My son raved about this, and he's a very picky eater.  So this will be something I make often.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious! A little time-consuming, but well worth it. All I could say, when tasting the final product, was "Wow!"
