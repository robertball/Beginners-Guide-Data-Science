This recipe was absolutely delicious and full of subtle flavor. When I made it, I used coconut milk instead of flaked coconut. However, next time I make it I will lessen the amount of butter to a teaspoon or none at all. The recipe really doesn't need it. Also, I would bake it for 18-20 minutes instead of the listed 25. Salmon still cooks when you take it out of the oven so it came out a little too dry for my taste.  Overall, I loved this recipe and you can put in your own personal touch.

This was so good.  Normally we do our salmon on the grill but this is best in the oven as it makes the coconut crisp.  We will cut down the amount of marinade as we had more than half left over.  Just make sure you make enough salmon as you don't want to stop eating it!  A must recipe for anyone who likes salmon.

We cook this salmon on the grill and love it that way.  Slightly sweet with crunchy coconut.  Before pouring on the marinade, I set a bit aside to serve on the side as a dip or spread.  That way each person can eat the salmon as sweet as they want.  (Just a note about the marinade--since it is butter based, it will solidify upon refrigeration.)  An excellent recipe that I'm so happy to add to my recipe box.

If you're a salmon purist, don't try this recipe.  I thought I would try something new, but this was entirely too sugary and sweet.  I ended up scraping the coating off.  Wouldn't recommend.

Very good! Not as crunchy as I thought it would be but, it was very tasty!! First, I marinated the salmon in a few Tbsps of lime juice for 2-3 hours. Personally, I like the way lime & coconut taste together and the tangy lime played well with the coconut. I discarded the lime juice before marinating the salmon in the coconut/honey/butter mixture. I also cut back on the butter. Baked the salmon for only 20 minutes and then broiled for 2-3 min. to get that golden crust.

I was really disappointed with this. It was sickeningly sweet, and I couldn't even finish my salmon. (And I like to eat!) I followed the recipe exactly as indicated, but consistency was bad (gooey) and again, the sweetness was excessive. Tasted more like candy than fish.

This is my favorite salmon recipe.  I never bake it anymore.  It's so much easier to just throw everything into a foil pouch and throw on the BBQ or George Foreman.  So good!

This was fantastic.  I will use less butter next time.  I had my in-laws over for dinner and this was a quick meal to make.  I served it with salad and bread.  It was a hit!  Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous recipe.  My husband is still raving about it. Followed instructions except that I used much less butter.  
Took the suggestion of others and served with mashed potatoes - seems unlikely but is the perfect accompaniment.  Will make this again and wouldn't hesitate to serve to company.

This was very tasty, but I'm glad I read the reviews.  I used 1/2 cup butter & 1/3 cup homey.  I accidentally bought "sweetened" coconut, so next time I'll use plain to help cut down on some of the sweetness a little more.

Yuck Yuck Yuck. We love Salmon but this particular recipe makes you think it would be sweet but it just brings out the fishy taste worse. I will not be making this again. If you really like salmon I suggest getting "the back of the yards" spice and putting it & a little brown sugar on the salmon.

A bit too much butter I think b/c it came out a little soupy but the flavor was good. I had Catfish and it was really nice.  I served it over the Pad Se Eew noodle recipe on Allrecipes.

like several others, I thought it was way too sweet! Perhaps I will try just brown sugar or just honey, but the combination of the two of them was too much sugar.

Awesome!  My beau was skeptical when I wanted to cook salmon, but he loved it.  And elsamaguiar is right, it does go great with mashed potatoes, much better than with rice.  I did find that there was more than enough sauce.  I cut it back by about a third while doubling the salmon amount and it was about right.  I found when I marinated it the sauce reverted to a solid consistency, rather than remaining a liquid, but I didn't want to marinate fish at room temperature.  It worked out great anyway.

This recipe made me like finally like Salmon.  My husband went in for seconds (this was a miracle to me.)   I reduced the butter down to 1/2 stick, and slightly reduced the brown sugar and honey.  The coconut was awesome on it.  I did broil to get the right color and a little crisp into it.

this makes twice as much marinade as you need. Cut it in half and it's tasty! I'd recommend adding some salt and pepper or maybe some soy to make the flavors sing. Try it served with Coconut Jasmine rice and broccoli.

Did not use butter. Added freshly chopped onion and olive oil, used ~6 tbsp of honey, half a can of grated coconut in heavy syrup, and 4 packets of splenda, for a ~1.6 lb fillet. Did not marinate due to lack of time. Baked at 275º for 40 min. on cedar wood planks. My dad and brother rarely give out compliments, but they raved about this dish! You definitely have to be careful with the ingredients though, because it's easy to make this too sweet and ruin the taste!

I made my version of this several weeks ago and the family is still raving about it!   Here are my variations:  I couldn't see marinating in all that butter so I salted the salmon and marinated  in pinapple juice.  Then I discarded the marinade and baked with the honey/coconut sauce on top per the recipie.  Great is the only word for it.

I was blown away as too how well this came out.  I felt I was in a gourmet restaurant.  It is very rich so serving it with mashed potates was great. Maybe, even as bit size entree would be nice as well

This dish was absolutely wonderful!  It is a little high in calories and fat but I think you can easily cut down on the butter by at least a third!! This is going to be one of my all time favorite recipes!

I love sweet things and this salmon is no exception!  My 6 year old who won't even try fish ate 3 bites because she loves coconut.  A very nice twist for salmon.

The flavors just did not mesh well. The thought was good. The butter was WAY too much even at 1/2 cup, which is what I reduced it to. The cooking time seemed about right to me with a quick shot under the broiler to crisp it up. I love coconut but I think in this case it would be better without it. Just use the glaze and it might be a 4 star.

No offense to the creator of this dish, but we thought it was not good. The coconut flavor with the salmon was okay, but the honey/brown sugar/butter sauce was really NOT good at all. It gave off a really bad aftertaste with the salmon. I would definitely not make this again or recommend it to anyone.

There is way too much butter in this recipe.  You could easily cut the ingredients by half (except the coconut, that is the best part!) and have plenty for your recipe.  I'm giving it 3 stars because only half of my family liked it.

Very good. True very sweet so make sure you dont mind sweet. I was only cooking for myself so i added ingredients to taste. But in the end i had to much coconut and could have used less butter. Will make again with not as much butter and coconut.

This recipe is SO easy and absolutely delicious! I'm not a big fan of salmon because well, it tastes like salmon. But with this marinade it sings flavor. Love the protein and low fat salmon offers and will only eat it using this recipe.

This is good, but quite a bit sweet for my taste.  I also agree with other reviewers that you can cut the amounts of the marinade ingredients in half.  I only used two pieces of salmon and cut it in half and it was still enough for 4 pieces.  I will probably tr this again cutting the butter and coconut in half and the honey and brown sugar by 4-times.  With a little tweaking this can be really great.

WOW! This salmon was delish! I used 3/4 cup of butter and did everything else exactly as the recipe said. My parents, my boyfriend and myself loved it! We arent even fish people and there was none left! Recipe is a keeper! I served it with green beans and mashed potatoes

The glaze was good, but it was too sweet for the strong flavor of salmon.  I would use it for a more mild fish.

Great salmon dish my husband and I enjoyed immensely during a work day. During my third trimester, time is premium, so it was nice to make a fish dish that was so flavorful, yet required minimal time and preparation. This is also a great compliment to the dish noting my husband despises salmon. I did add curry powder and fresh ground black pepper to add savory flavors and some heat. I also reduced the butter markedly as I found it excessive and unnecessary. Reducing the sugar (the coconut is sweet enough) and butter made for a slightly healthier fish without the excessive sweetness others noted. Overall, this is a great base recipe in need of minimal modification, but definitely add some curry powder and pepper!

This is tasty! The best parts are the edges where the sugars have caramelized. I cut the butter down to 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons), used 1/2 cup of honey, and didn't change the other ingredients. I'm making it that way from now on. Hubby loved it. I served it with coconut jasmine rice and steamed green beans.

I made this for a BBQ with friends. I am not a fish eater (it makes me sick) but I still tried it. It had a nice flavor but not enough to cover the fishy taste. My husband and all others who tried it LOVED it! I will definitely make it again (with some chicken on the side for me). Just remember, if you barbeque it make sure you put it in a foil boat.

This is excellent! However, the amounts are off. For two servings, I used less that 1/4C of honey, 1 tbsp of light brown sugar, 2 tbsp of honey and about two handfuls of coconut.  Then I sprinkled a little more coconut on top.  Can't wait to make this again!

I almost gave this recipe 4 stars because it was pretty sweet for my taste, BUT THEN I had the leftovers on top of my spinach salad the next day and it was absolutely amazing!!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the amount of butter, honey, and brown sugar in half.  You definitely don't need the full amounts!

Definetly a keeper!  I made this recipe for 4 frozen salmon filets, but halved all the other ingredients.  I placed the frozen filets in a baking dish and poured the sauce overtop.  Then baked for just a little longer than the recommended amount of time.  There was plenty of sauce, and it was DELICIOUS! Great recipe!

Incredible!  Very delicious and very attractive too.  Great "company" dish.
I Think it would be better served with rice than with mashed potatoes.

This was absolutely fabulous.  I could eat salmon every night if it was prepared this way. I did cut the butter to one cup to try and save some fat and it was still outstanding.

I thought this was very good, I made it with mashed potatoes like someone suggested.  Since I only made one serving for myself, I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed the ingredients.  Another thing, I just got home from school starving at 9 p.m. to make dinner so I didn't let it marinate and I forgot to baste it while in the oven, but still came out with a perfect amount of sweetness.

this was pretty good.  Next time I think I will put some soy sauce on the salmon before topping.

The idea is good, but it was sooooo sweet. My husband and I called this Candy Salmon. Definitely not my favorite. I felt like I was eating dessert for dinner.

I just couldn't justify using 1 1/2 cups of butter !!! for 4 servings of salmon.  So I simply fried mine in the frying pan with about a 1/4 c butter.  Didn't marinate, just spread honey and brownsugar mix onto the fillets and covered in coconut.   I'm sure the coconut would be better crisp, which could maybe be achieved by less butter!! I found even with a 1/4 cup it was a little much.   My 5 yr. old daughter really liked it and asked me to make it again and my two year old boy didn't complain either. :) Ours was very sweet!

Loved this dish! I didnt use as much butter and I used coconut milk instead of flakes. Also used a little bit more honey than called for. Great dish!

Very good, but had to cut down the butter!  I used only about 3/4 cup butter and it was still too much.

Even though I am often a fan of sweet things, I have to agree with other reviews.. this was just too sweet for my taste. I paired things down significantly, only using about 1 tbl butter, 1 tbl honey, 1/2 tbl brown sugar and a few tablespoons of coconut shavings (for one serving) and it was still too sweet. I do love my salmon, but I probably won't be making this again. If you are looking for a sweet salmon dish, this website's "Salmon with Brown Sugar Glaze" is an excellent choice.

This sounded fun, but was a little sweet, I added a can of green chilis and a little chili powder to give it a back end,and cut the butter down to 1 cup. I will be making it again.

I like sweet, and this was definitely sweet and a different way to cook salmon.  I like my salmon well done and this was pretty good when cooked longer than suggested.  I did use as least half the recommended about of butter.  My husband thought it was just okay.  He wasn't really excited for me to make it again.  Not bad though.

This was great! I used it as a starting point and added some store-bought mango chutney to the marinade (which I made much less of like other reviewers), sprinkled coconut on the fillets before baking, and served the chutney with the fish.  My husband is always skeptical about fish dishes, and he loved it!  We had a mango salsa couscous on the side, and it fit right in.

Delicious. My boyfriend loves salmon and loves sweet things so I made this for his birthday. I use 1/4 of the butter this recipe calls for and instead of mixing in the cocunut I sprinkle it on top.

This recipe is wonderful, it's possibly one of the best salmon dishes I have ever tasted.  I always love sweet sauce with salmon, but this seemed like it might be a little too sweet for my guests so I added a little liquid smoke & worcestershire sauce & it was simply delicious! You might also want to reduce the amount of butter as I only had 1 cup and it still tasted perfect. Make sure you make enough because everyone will want to go back for seconds!

This recipe is great.  It has an almost tropical feel to it and while eating it I can picture myself on a beautiful tropical beach.  I was a little hesitant about this one at first so I just made one portion but it was so good that I will be making it again and making a lot of it next time.  Like suggested I served it with mashed potatoes and it made for a quick, delicious meal.

This recipe was strangely delicious! I 1/2'd the marinade recipe and it seemed like it was still too much. But whatever, it was one of those non-conventional recipes that really seems to work for those who are willing to appreciate different tastes!

I used only a half cup of butter, because it seemed to call for so much!  I lessened the other ingredients a little as well to compensate.  The taste was terrific, my husband really liked it.  But, the whole marinate it for 30 minutes thing was not a good idea.  When I took it out of the fridge the butter sauce was just a clumpy congealed mess.  Next time I think I'll skip the marinade time and just pour the warm sauce straight onto my salmon and put it straight into the oven.  We'll see how that works.

This was really, REALLY good. But it seemed like it was missing something so next time I cook it, I'm going to cut the butter in half and add in some rice vinegar and a dash of cayenne. That should kick it up a notch!!

It's very sweet, but I liked it. I looked at the recipe, and 1.5 cups of butter seemed a bit much. So, I switched out 1 cup of butter with coconut milk. Also, I allowed the salmon to marinate in the baking dish (had more marinade than I needed), then I put the whole dish in the oven and let it bake. It turned out well.

I loved it but next time would not cook the salmon with all of the sauce, just half.

Great as long as you follow the suggestions in other reviews. Definitely decrease the butter! I also take mine out of the baking dish and move them to a pan to broil the fillets for 3 minutes after to toast the coconut.

Used coconut oil instead of butter. Tasted delicious. Next time I might just use the coconut oil & honey , skip the drizzle topping.

You can definitely cut back on the butter in this recipe and it still tastes delish! My picky two year old even loves this one, more like a very sweet main dish.

I tried this last night with red salmon fillets we had in the freezer... We live in Alaska and like many Alaskans we catch and process our own seafood... Sometimes we have salmon that has been in the freezer for a year, so we have to "sauce" it up a bit... At any rate, I did this recipe and it came out stupendous... I cut down on the sweet ingredients and put in some red pepper and a touch of marjoram to bump it up a bit... Also used natural, unbleached coconut flakes - The natural coconut makes a huge difference... Served the fillets with ginger-orange basmati rice... It was 5 Star all the way... One last thought, I like my salmon medium rare so I baked the salmon for ten minutes not the suggested 20/25 minutes - no need to kill the darn thing, again!

This marinade sauce would also work well with pork, chicken and my favorite, grilled jumbo shrimp.
