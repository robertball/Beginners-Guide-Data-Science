Highly recommended! I have made this several times now over a charcoal grill and it is fantastic.  I have also had to share the recipe with my neighbor after he smelled it while it was cooking!  I will add that you should soak the mussels before you cook them in order to get the sand out of them:
Place the mussels in a large pot (8qt or so), and for every 24 mussels add 4 cups of cold water and 1/3 cup salt. Stir well once to mix the salt, mussels, and water. After soaking for about 15 or 20 minutes dump the water, rinse the mussels and repeat. Complete the process a total of 3 times.
***
We just made this again tonight (the windchill here in MN was -14, but we really wanted to grill.)  We added a bag of bay scallops on top of the mussels and then topped off each individual bowl (when it was finished) with a squeeze of lime, and a sprinkle of garlic salt and curry powder -- WOW!  This was amazing!  We served it with a baked potato & a salad.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Definitely worth the 5 stars with the presentation value, the meal looked fantastic.  However be careful of adding too many post-cooking spices, as the dish needs to stand on the foundation of the cooking juices and not be overpowered by extra garlic salt/curry.  As a complimentary side definitely add a very crusty bread, as the sauce is perfect in combination with an italian or sourdough loaf.

I can tell THIS would be my favorite recipe for mussels ever. I wanted to review for one reason: I am a stove-top mussel cooker, and every recipe I see, I make on the stove. If you also would rather make this on the stove top, do NOT add the lime slices. Instead, squeeze some lime juice on right before serving. The boiled lime actually REALLY overpowered everything and gave a bitter aftertaste...I found out the hard way haha!

We enjoyed this; on the other hand, I've never met a grilled mussel that I didn't like.  The next time we make it, we'll probably double all the tasty savoury stuff, because that's what we tend to like.

If you are looking for the perfect mussel recipe, this is the one to try!! This is the first recipe I have made with mussels, and everyone loved them.  It is such a simple recipe and grilling them in tin foil packetts on the BBQ works perfectly and is makes for an easy clean.

I really loved this recipe.  I usually will not rate a recipe if I change a major ingredient but in this case I think that it is okay.  I used clams instead of mussels but considering that I prefer mussels, I can't wait to try it with them.  Other than this change I followed the recipe exactly.  The broth was wonderful with my homemade bread and I could eat another bowl right now.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this over the Christmas holidays.  Absolutely stellar!  Will definitely make again.  Rave reviews from everyone that was here for dinner.  Made no changes or substitutions.

Fantastic!  I absolutely agree with sosborn's review that the dish looks fantastic and that it needs no additional spicing after cooking.  The dish, as it comes off the grill, needs no embellishment whatsoever.  Hot crusty bread and a nice glass of chardonnay are all you need for the perfect dish!

Made pretty much exactly according to the recipe. Took a bit longer on the grill, but it was a cold night outside. Also added a few scallops to each packet.  Really excellent flavours! Will make again although I may try just doing it in a pot vs the grill. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

These were absolutely delicious.  I loved that these could be made on the grill, 98 degrees outside as I write this.  Curry &  mussel lovers will be in heaven.  I prepared exactly as written.  Only thing, I did not care for the added lime slices.  Great idea, and pretty presentation, but the rind adds a bitterness that took away from the overall enjoyment of this dish.  Next time I will addd lime juice and leave out the wedges during cooking.  But great overall, and a definite do-over.  Thanks for sharing, Diana.

If there were 10 stars, I would have given that!  Amazing!!  We had as a main dish and for 6 people, we ate 5lbs of mussels.

I just recently started liking mussels and this is the first time I cooked them myself. Super simple recipe. I steamed them instead of grilling them. They were soo tender and juicy and the sauce was perfect!

Delicious and unique! After reading a bunch of common garlic & white wine recipes, I settled on this one for its originality. It was very colorful and the lime put a bit of a tangy twist. I loved the curry powder. It looked and smelled amazing and the sauce was just perfect for dipping bread in afterwards. I only wish that the mussels themselves carried a bit more flavor from the sauce.

This recipe was delicious!!! We loved it... I didn't have any parsley or limes, but I did sprinkle with lime juice. I also put scallops in as well and baked it since our bbq in under a snow bank. I recommend trying this, it's easy and so good.

Amazing. Total hit in the house for a Sunday night dinner. A good baguette to sop up juices and a little garlic butter with parsley to go on top made it perfect. Next time I'm going to sauté the peppers with some red onion in curry butter before putting on grill.

Wow! Great recipe I added some green onions and cherry tomatoes as extra. Even my five year old loved them. I will be telling friends about this recipe. Thanks
