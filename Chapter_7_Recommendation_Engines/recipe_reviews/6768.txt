WHAT A HIT!!! These were awesome! I didn't have any self-rising flour so I made my own: 1c flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt.  However, since I noticed the "dense" complaints, I added a second tsp of baking powder to ensure they were fluffy. Also, once I made the batter, I added about a tsp of Italian seasoning.  WOW! Now, they don't look or taste like dinner rolls but everyone gobbled them up just the same. Also, I stink at making breads and I accomplished these without a hitch! Thank you Glenda for the great recipe!

Great rolls.  I doubled the recipe (except for the sugar), added Tbl baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt.  Nice and fluffy.  A huge hit with my family.

These are excellent and super easy! They have a sweet flavor, definitely more like biscuits than rolls. Recommended!

I've made these rolls for years but with a different recipe: 2 cups self rising flour, 2 Tbs. sugar, 4 Tbs. mayo plus 1 cup milk.  My family loves them.  Great for a quick hot roll after church.

Update: I read the more recent reviews, that suggested adding baking soda.  I added 1 tsp., the last couple of times I've made them, and they come out even better than before!! Original: Just like horseradish, I have never been able to slip anything with mayonaise in it past my husband, until now.  Not only were they super easy they actually tasted good!

Simple, easy, and very good.  I made two batches.  I left the first batch in for 10 minutes and they did taste like corn muffins.  The second batch I left in for 8 minutes and they were a little more like regular biscuits.  I don't know.  Either way, they got eaten!

Not quite bread, neither muffin nor cake, which isn't to say it wasn't strangely good. Worthwhile if times is tight.

These are more like muffins, but who cares??? They are super. And EASY!!! I made 6, could have made 8, & my family griped that I didn't make more. I used 1 cup reg. flour plus 1/2 t. salt, 1/2 t. soda, & 1 1/2 t. baking powder. What a great recipe!!! You can use it when you need a quick meal addition. Everyone always has these ingredients around. THANK YOU!!!

I'm giving these a four rating because one kid said four stars, the other said five and hubby said three. I thought it was so interesting that all three of them thought that these were corn muffins! When I tasted one I knew where they were coming from. It must have been the sweetness, even though I added garlic and onion powders to the mixture. Definitely not a roll, but very good anyway. Thanks Glenda!

Topped these with sausage gravy and received raving remarks from my husband - "the best gravy & biscuits he'd ever had..."
These are a bit sweet but very good.

Ick.  I hate to give a bad review, but I want to spare others from making the same mistake.  These rolls were incredibly heavy and dry.  We'll stick to the butter crescent recipe instead!

Wow! These are SO good and EASY to make! I was making dinner one day and forgot to take the rolls out of the freezer, so I tried these. My husband was really impressed for how quick they were to throw together.  Note:  I only got 6 rolls out of one batch, so I always double it.

I needed a quick bread to go with leftovers. Had to make my own SR flour but still quick & easy. DH was happy since more like a biscuit.

Excellent recipe.  However, I did add a teaspoon of baking powder per one reviewer's suggestion to ensure that the muffins/biscuits are fluffy.  Very easy to make.  They are so tasty, you don't even need to have them buttered!

These turned out really well for me seeing as how I'm not much of a bread person.  I added about 1/2 a packet of ranch dressing mix and some italian seasonings to my flour.  I left the sugar in there and that was a mistake.  They came out as sweet ranch rolls.  But, this being my first attempt I was pleased.  They were not dense or dry.  They did have a nice texture.  I only got 7 rolls out of 1 batch and I filled my muffin tins 1/2 full.  I'm not sure how your supposed to get 12, but oh well.  They were eaten.  Thanks Glenda.

Today is Easter Sunday. Yesterday I realized that I did not have any bread at all to go with our ham dinner. So, I searched for something that did not have yeast (all out of that)and did not have to be made in a bread machine, and was not a "biscuit".
I just made a trial batch of these Instant Rolls and they are wonderful! My father (75) asked what they were and when I tried to explain, he told me it didn't matter what they were called, they were good, and I better hide them or he would eat them all up. My 5 year old loves them too! Thanks for coming to my rescue! I'll be making these often.

One of our favorite quick roll recipes. I like to change it up to reflect the food I'm making. We like it with garlic powder and green onion for dinner and dipped in butter/cinnamon-sugar for breakfast. Really simple and always great to make with very little ingredients.

These rolls did not turn out at all.  They were quick and very easy, but you pay for it in the quality of what the recipe calls a roll.  It looked more like a biscuit and was extremely heavy and sweet.  I tried the recipe twice to make sure it wasn't a mistake I'd made, but both attempts gave the same result.

These turned out GREAT!! I added the 1 tsp baking powder as some had suggested and I think that really helped them out. My husband loved them and when I told him that they had mayo in them he did'nt believe me. I can't wait to share the recipe! Thanks Glenda!

I won't make these again. I may have added to much salt by mistake but mine had a bitter taste to them. They were nothing like rolls, definatly more like a biscut. No thank you, I'll just stick with white sandwich bread when I'm in a hurry :(

You know what, I was surprised to taste the mayo. It may be because I knew it was in it but I didn't really care for it.

So quick and delicious! I used regular flour with 2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt because I didn't have self rising flour. I cut the sugar down to 2 T, which was still pretty sweet, and added a tsp of each italian seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder. It made 8 rolls that were perfect to serve for dinner with a bowl of soup. I'm done looking for a 'dinner bun' recipe!

This was so quick and easy! I did the normal flower + salt and baking powder thing suggested by the other users, and used a mini muffin tray so the cooking time was shorter. They were really cute and done in no time.

Like everyone else said, these are biscuits.  The kind you'd want for breakfast.  They are quick, easy and, pretty tasty!  I didn't have any self-rising flour so I used 1c. all-purpose, 1 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt along with all the other ingredients.  Turned out great!  Mine browned beautifully in under 10 minutes!  Next time I'll double it as I only got 5 biscuits out of this recipe.  :)  KEEPER!

I was sure that these biscuits (definitely not rolls, and how anyone can look at the ingredients and think they're going to get rolls I have no idea) were going to at least have a faint hint of mayo, but they didn't.  I used vegenaise, half white/half bread flour and a tsp. of baking soda (all out of baking powder), and doubled the recipe to get a dozen.  

Then I fed one to my mayo hating husband, and even after I told him what was in them he still liked them!  I am definitely putting this on my list of regular recipes.

OK i'm changing the rating from a 3 to a 4 because DH and DS really liked them. DD and i just thought they were ok. I guess I'm just disappointed because i was really craving yeast rolls and i didn't have the time to make them tonight. I did add a tsp extra of baking powder as other reviewers suggested.

Great and very easy! Definitely a biscuit and not a roll. Four stars because these were too sweet. The sugar amount needs to be adjusted. My son thought these tasted like biscuits from a certain famous fried chicken restaurant. Will make again.

These were very good. I made them with chili and my family loved them, they said they were the perfect roll to go with the chili. My 22 month old son couldn't get enough. Next time I think I'll try adding the ranch seasonings.

Somewhere between a biscuit and a roll...doubled the recipe, don't use self rising flour, so I used 2 cups flour, 1 Tb. baking powder, 1 tsp salt. Only used 4 Tb. sugar since everyone said it was sweet.  Served with Honey butter and everyone was happy happy! Loved that I had last minute guests and threw these together so quickly!!

Everyone loved these rolls!  And they were so quick and easy.  I love that I can make these last minute with any meal.  I did add an extra teaspoon of baking powder as suggested by other reviewers and I used coconut oil instead of mayonnaise.  Everyone was sad they only got 2 so this time I am making a double batch.

Quick, easy & delicious! I only got 7 rolls, but other than that, they were perfecto. I used fat free mayo, skim milk and used only 1.5 tbsp agave instead of sugar. We ate ours with the All Day Apple Butter from this site. Keeper recipe!

Super easy and great in a pinch when you need a quick bread to go with dinner and don't have time for the process of yeasty rolls. They are somewhat sweet, and light with a cross between a muffin and biscuit texture.

GOOD RECIPE! I thought they were a little sweet for a 'roll' (and definately more like a biscuit) and I only added 2TB sugar. Next time I will add only 1TB or none at all. I didn't have self-rising flour so made my own as others did, adding 1.5 tsp bkg powder and 1 tsp bkg soda. Hubbs took one bite and said 'mmmm...did you make corn muffins?'  (wierd. but then I thought-hmm they DO taste a little like a corn muffin...lol) great for a quick biscuit. thx.

This was extremely easy, absolutely. I gave it four stars because I only got six and they felt pretty heavy. However, they were gone by the time dinner was over. Thank you, I might just make these again!!

I'd also say this was a muffin and like someone else, I only got 7 muffins out of the recipe, no biggie now that I know both those things.  I didn't have self-rising flour either so as another reviewer did, I sub'd 1 c. regular flour, 1 t. baking soda and 1 1/2 t. baking powder.  I'll only put in 1/4 t. salt next time as it was a little salty for our taste.  Nice flavor, fluffy and one-bowl (++++) easy.  Thank you for a quick and tasty addition to meals.  Hubby, the "bread" man really liked them, too, and he eats enough of it to know.

This recipie is proof that "faster" isn't always "better". Sure the recipie was quick, but it was also terrible! I really expected the rolls to at least taste GOOD because it recieved so many rave reviews. Sorry, Glenda. I won't be baking them again!

They are still good the next day, reheated.

Simply said... these rolls kick butt!  I use Light Miracle Whip instead of regular
mayonnaise and skim milk to make a lower fat version.

I am not sure what I did was wrong or not.  I thought it would taste like bread instead of muffin.  It is good though. I will try again later.

I made these last night for dinner and they were great.  My husband doesn't like biscuits and these are somewhat like that -- but he sure like these!!! They would be great served with stew or soup and could be served to guests.  Thanks for the recipe.  Ms. Chef, Calgary, Canada.

I was in a fix on. Hristmas Day as I forgot to get rolls to serve with my dinner.  I searched on line for a wick roll recipe and found this.  It made 10 small muffin type rolls.  Everyone thought it tasted like corn muffins which tome was perfect for the ham dinner!  I think though Ext time I will either make a double recipe or just make 6-8 “rolls” in the muffin tin.  I baked on 450 for 15 mins and I think 10 mins would have been better for the size of rolls.  This is great in a fix!

very good and easy. Not having self rising flour, i followed the first review's advice. Also,  I did not have mayo, so I subbed buttermilk ranch dressing. Then I   added an egg so it would be less like a biscuit, as other reviews compared it to biscuits. also, i added a very generous amount of Parmesan cheese ( a table spoon or so??_) and no salt ( Parmesan cheese is already salty). Lastly, i added baking soda, as other reviewers mentioned. I am not sure if that made a difference, but i was very pleased with this  and mine were very soft and tender, more like a traditional roll. i sprayed cupcake liners with PAM oil and baked in muffin pan.  Definitely will make again.

I doubled the batch but omitted 2tbls sugar and added 1 tspn
Baking Powder.
They were excellent. I will use this again and 'tweak' it a lil for my personal preference. Cut the sugar by 1/4 yet again. 
But the recipe is fine as it is. They were fluffy like right between 
good biscuits and fine dinner rolls.

So easy, so good, so quick!  No self-rising flour on hand, so I just added 2tsp of baking powder and 1/4 tsp of salt to 1 cup of flour.  The rest I did as written.

I needed a super quick roll to go with dinner the other night and tried this recipe.  I doubled the recipe and got 12 rolls.  I thought they were wonderful.  I would say they are somewhere between a roll and a biscuit.  If I have more time I will be making a more traditional roll recipe, but when I need something quick and super easy this is it.  My family loved them.  Next time I am going to try adding a little baking soda as some reviewers have suggested.  Thanks for the recipe.

REALLY good!  Followed the suggestions for not using self-rising flour, including the addition of baking soda.  Added Italian seasoning, Parmesan cheese, and a little extra milk to loosen the batter and got 12 perfectly sized muffin type rolls.  I've saved it to my recipe box and will be using this one repeatedly!

I was looking for a roll recipe that didn't require yeast, as my pantry's a bit bare at the moment. I didn't have mayo, either, so I substited an egg and added a heaping tablespoon of plain yogurt (and reduced the milk by about the same amount).  I cut back to 2T sugar as others suggested, and they were perfect!  I thought about adding a little parmesan and spices, but realized I'd want the rest for breakfast (though in hindsight, I probably would have eaten them for breakfast even if they were cheesy instead of cinnamony.  They're kinda addicting).  UPDATE: I just made them with mayo for the first time, and they're moister than when made with egg, but not quite as tasty.  Still good, though.

These were very good.  Just a tad bit sweet for my taste, but very good.  The best part was just how easy it was. And I kinda thought it tasted like corn muffins too.  I think i might try these with about half the sugar next time.  Mine looked totally different from the picture, not sure why???  But the point is try them you most likely will NOT regret it.

This was a big hit with my family as well. I made the recipe as shown, but next time I am going to try it with extra baking powder and salt to try to get them a bit fluffier. I let the rolls bake the full 15 minutes so the outsides were crisp, then kept them warm in the oven until ready to serve. The mayo keeps them moist and tender inside, so you don't have to worry about them getting dry.

I followed the first reviewer who made her own self-rising flour...and the results were INCREDIBLE.  Soft, fluffy, plus I put some Italian seasoning and parmesan in it so it had good flavor too.  It only made seven rolls, which was a pity, because people wanted a lot more.  Easiest, best recipe ever!

Was in a little bit of a panic, trying to make my parents an anniversary breakfast, and wanting to make eggs benedict (Which I have never had) and used these. They were perfect! so fast and easy. My parents liked them for eggs benedict, and I dont think they were saying it just to be polite :) and as plain buns, they are so simple and good.

This is a good basic recipe that can be tweaked in a variety of directions. DH prefers the one where I add 3 Tbsp. of parmesan cheese and 3 Tbsp. of fresh chives. When I make those, I have to hide them or he'll eat them all! I enjoy experimenting with all of the different things I can add; the results have never been unpleasant.
