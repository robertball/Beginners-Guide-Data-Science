11.10.16 ~ This is a great salad loaded with flavor! I made this in single servings and we both loved it and the dressing. We liked the tangy taste that the green apple added to the salad. The dressing is great, and just pulled the salad together. Lucky for us, we have a half a bag of lettuce left, so we are having the salad again, tomorrow.

I made this recipe as written and served it at a family gathering. I received a lot of compliments on it. It will be even better with toasted walnuts.
