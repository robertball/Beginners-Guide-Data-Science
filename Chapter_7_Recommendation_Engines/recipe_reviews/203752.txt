Contrary to the other reviewer's statements, this recipe calls for 8 oz or 1/2 a package of pasta, which I found to be just the right amount to support the amazing, cheesy, rich sauce.  I omitted the onion to suit personal taste, but followed the recipe for everything else.  This is grown up Mac and cheese!  Thanks for sharing, Tiger.

My 14 year old son made this as his addition to our Thanksgiving meal. He added some additional Colby-Jack cheese with the cheddar. It was delicious and now a permanent addition to our holiday meal!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe asks for four ounces of macaroni. Four ounces is about a cup. The amount of sauce this makes is WAY too much for one cup of pasta! Luckily I made 8 ounces, thinking this was going to be a problem. It was creamy, but I couldn't taste the blue cheese at all! It needed garlic too, I thought. If the measurements were right, then this would be a nice, creamy pasta but save your blue cheese for something you can taste it in! My favorite recipe is still Mom's Macaroni and Cheese (submitted by Maria Costello).

Oh my!   This mac and cheese is absolutely delicious.  I did double the pasta, so I automatically doubled the cheese sauce.  Next time, I will only make one and half times the cheese sauce, because it was a little much for a pound of pasta. I tried it right out of the pan and it is just as delicious as baked.  It is a sophisticated version of mac and cheese that adults and children will love.  The blend of cheeses was perfect and I thought the blue cheese came through beautifully, since sometimes it can be overpowering.  Thanks for the great recipe.  It is going to be a definite keeper for me!

This recipe is AMAZING! The flavor and creaminess was out of this world!  I made two minor changes, only to suit our own tastes. I added 2 ounces more Velveeta (what isn't better with more Velveeta?), and crushed up some Ritz crackers for the top.  The ratio of macaroni to cheese sauce was perfect, in my opinion, and the bleu cheese and hint of mustard really does make an amazing difference.  Thanks for posting this recipe, I will be making again and again!

This was a really nice mac and cheese recipe. I used more onion than called for (like 1/4 cup total), slightly more velveeta (for a more cheesier flavor) and after tasting it and deciding it needed a little something more, about 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic. Next time I will use fresh garlic (1-2 cloves), and cook it with the onions. When I first tasted the sauce on it's own I wasn't impressed, but once I added the noodles and baked it, the flavors melded perfectly. Don't be fooled by the amount of blue cheese used, you can definately taste it, but in a good way. I will use this recipe again from time to time for something different from the norm! Thanks for posting. :)

So good!! I was worried that there was too much sauce before it went in the oven but the noodles soaked it right up.  I used rotini instead of fusilli.  The taste was heavenly, one of the better baked mac and cheese dishes I have made.  I will keep the recipe around.

Absolutely loved it!! I made it for my family, even the picky eaters were eating 2 more helpings of it. Before I put it in the oven i shredded a block of cheddar cheese on top of the dish it was delicious! i loved how the blue chees gave it a totally different kick. I will make this again!

Followed recipe with small changes. Used rotini, 1/2 an onion chopped, 1/2 the milk was FF 1/2 and 1/2, about 1/2 t. of red pepper flakes added to sauce and sprinkled a handful of breadcrumbs during last five minutes of baking.  The sauce never did thicken up for me in the saucepan but did thicken in the oven.  I cannot taste the blue cheese at all.  I mostly taste the processed cheese.  I may make this recipe again and adjust the ratio of cheeses to make the cheddar and blue more predominant.

Very tasty! Best mac and cheese I think I have ever made! The blue cheese adds a great flavor! I doubled recipe and only used 3 cups of milk. I also added a little more processed cheese and cheddar cheese just to be sure I had enough of the sauce. I also used Tastefully Simple Onion Onion rather than fresh onion and added chunks of ham. It made a great dinner! Thanks!!

FABULOUS!  My boyfriend said it might be too good!I made some changes to try and make it a bit healthier and it went unnoticed! I substituted an entire box (14.5 oz) of Ronzoni Smart Taste Rotini (purple box) to reduce the calories, used skim milk and AP whole wheat flour.  Used the whole stick of margarine but could probably get away with 1/2. Also used Gorgonzola and Sharp Cheddar for more flavor and topped the mac & cheese with some Parmesan/Romano blend and plain bread crumbs then sprayed it with Pam so it would brown up.  So flavorful and rich!

Cheese food or processed cheese food is usually Velveeta Cheese, usually sold in block form 8oz. up to 32 oz. You may also use the jar, but it is much more expensive.

I'm giving this recipe 5-stars because the sauce is incredible.  I do agree with a previous reviewer that you do need more noodles 1 cup/8oz is not enough.  Other than that, the flour/milk/butter combination is perfect.  You can build off of this by adding more than just onions...you could do garlic, red pepper flakes, or whatever suits your tastes.  I added ham/bacon just for some meat.  You can also vary your cheeses based on your preferences as well.  Way to go...again, the secret is in the flour/butter/milk ratio...the rest you can alter to your liking.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe! While I agree you need a bit more than 8 ounces of pasta to support the amount of sauce the recipe creates, that sauce was simply divine! I think it is honestly the first thing that has made me truly LOVE bleu cheese! I served it at Thanksgiving dinner with about 35 people (so had 2 full packages of fusili in the pot and made only twice as much sauce as the original recipie called for because people said it made so much). It was honestly the first thing gone from the table! All my friends loved it too! I was going to add a bit of garlic myself to the recipe, but I don't think that the recipe was honestly missing it because I ended up serving it without because I know I would have added too much (I love a strong taste of garlic that most people do not). I will definitely be making this again for Christmas. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This was an awesome recipe.  I prepared a double recipe into a casserole dish as the recipe says, but did it the night before so all I had to do was pop it into the oven for my 3-year-old's party the next day.  This worked awesome and was so tasty.  I have a request to do this again, thanks for sharing a great family recipe!

The best macaroni and cheese I have ever made - the blue cheese gave it a tang and the velveeta gave it the smooth creaminess!  Perfection, to me anyways.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was great!  I adjusted the cheese amounts to fit my liking, but the blue cheese added a nice tang to the normal mac and cheese that the whole family enjoyed.

This was fantastic! I used elbow mac because that's what I had on hand and used butter instead of margarine and garlic instead of onion. I also went a little heavy on the blue cheese. I did put it in the oven for 20 min but think that step was totally unnecessary as it was awesome straight out of the pan. My sauce was perfect and didn't need to thicken.

Delicious! I put in a bit more velveeta and cheddar cheese than called for and I wish i had put in a bit more blue cheese than called for, as i could taste it much. I do recommend baking it, as that lets the flavors meld and the noodles soak up the sauce- the sauce looked like too much before I baked it, but after it was perfect. 

Next time I will add some veggies and/or meat!

This was good. I had no processed cheese food so I used extra cheddar (and also gorgozola instead of regular bleu cheese). I also added a squirt of dijon mustard instead of mustard powder. My sauce came out a bit grainy, but tasty.

Rich and creamy and easy to make.  I thought it was a tiny bit bland.  I added a little garlic and used more onion than the recipe called for.  I will certainly make it again, and experiment with the flavor.

I wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars.  It is really tasty and great overall, but the texture wasn't as creamy as I would have liked.  Maybe it was something I did, but it seemed perfectly creamy after I cooked the sauce, then was slightly chauky after baking.  Still excellent and I will make it again.  The blue cheese tasted great! I subbed the 1/4 c. cheddar for 1/2 c. of a sharp, medium, and white cheddar mixture, then topped the whole thing with more of this cheese mixture. Yummy!

I made this today I didn't have blue cheese so I used Mac and cheese cheese sauce and mozzarella cheese. It was awesome. Perfect for a cold winters night.

Velveeta makes a white version of their classic cube in little squeeze packets so I used this as the "processes cheese food." I also used a white Vermont cheddar. I doubled recipe as-is (only edit was adding a dash of nutmeg) for a party and it was fantastic. Was hard to stop from eating it all before my guests came!

This recipe was really good, we all loved it. I made it as-is, except I used almost a whole package of pasta (about 12 oz)--there was enough sauce for it. It would definitely make a great side to a big dinner (Easter, Xmas, etc)--the blue cheese gives this mac and cheese a little sophistication! :)

Delicious! The only things I did differently than the recipe was that I did not have cheddar cubes so I threw in a handful of shredded instead, and I only had mini rotini on hand so I used that instead of fusili.  I love the bite that the blue cheese gives to it.  I agree with another reviewer who said this is an adult mac and cheese - it might have too much flavor from the blue cheese for most kids.  But my 18 month old likes a lot of stuff that most might call non-kid friendly foods, so we'll try it with him and see. I am going to make this for Thanksgiving, but this time I'll use fusili like the recipe says.

Oh and also I agree with some others that a half box of pasta is the perfect amount for the amount of sauce the recipe yields.

If you like your Mac and cheese creamy and soft, this is NOT for you!!!  I found it bitter and dry, even though I love blue cheese.  I would rather have a box of kraft over this any day!

This is delicious! I added garlic in with the onion at the roux stage. I was making a double recipe, and it does make a LOT of sauce. Even though I only made 1 and 1/2 recipe of the sauce, it was more than enough for double the noodles! I didn’t bake, just threw it in the crock pot on warm for a pot luck.

I debated over reviewing this recipe because I changed it due to a lack of ingredients, but I love that this recipe was simple and delicious! I used macaroni noodles instead of spirals and I do not have blue cheese or Velveeta. I followed (doubled) the recipe and instructions using sharp cheddar and fresh parmesan as my cheeses, because that's what I had on hand. I also omitted the dry mustard because I didn't have that either. The onion made this recipe in my opinion. It turned out absolutely delicious and sinful!

I would personally add a little more blue cheese and a little more ground mustard.  I put two cloves of minced garlic with it which was great,  but I think I’m going to put three next time  and a little more onion.  I would recommend only baking it may be 10 minutes at most to keep it moist.  Crispy crumbled bacon on top would probably work well with too.

Use the cheeses that make you happy! Cant eat recipe cheeses so had to use cheddar, swiss and parmesan. I was afraid the parmesan would make it too salty so I omitted it. Shouldnt' have. Still, it's excellent!!

I followed the recipe exactly. I love the taste of this version of Mac and cheese, but I found that baking it for that length of time dried up all the creaminess of the sauce. If I make again I’ll

Needed more noodles. Too cheesy! I don’t care for the flavor that much maybe I’ll switch the blue cheese for Swiss. Would be better with some pretzel crumbles on top. However my daughter loved it, said it was the best Mac and cheese she has ever had! She agreed it needed a topping too.

This is my 3rd time using this  recipe and my family still loves it. I replace the processed cheese with another type of mild or cheddar cheese though. I also sprinkle cheese over the top before I put it in the oven. The creamy cheese sauce used in this recipe is amazing though!

I have a super picky seventeen-year-old, and he absolutely scarffs this down!  
I've also made it a few times for my picky niece who is 13 And she can't get enough of it either.
Is this is an amazing recipe, the blue cheese adds such zing!

This mac & cheese is a winner! The combination of sharp cheddar and blue cheese was a delightfully unexpected treat. I've been craving mac & cheese for weeks, but got frustrated trying to figure out how to make it gluten free. I substituted the regular pasta for a GF option, and used all-purpose GF flour. Since the pasta doesn't have the gluten to bind it together, the pasta fell apart when I mixed in the cheese sauce, but the flavor was still delicious. I also doubled the recipe to make sure I had leftovers to snack on the next day.

I would use a little more noodles than this recommends if you plan to eat it all upon preparing. If you plan on having leftovers stick with these quantities. It'll reheat better with the extra cheese. Bleu cheese was a little strong, next I'm gonna use less of that

Very tasty and easy. I made two changes. I used ground ritz whole wheat crackers instead of flour, and I doubled up on the cheddar  while skipping the blue cheese.

Crazy good mac and cheese.  I use butter instead of margarine and usually use elbow pasta.  Rather than cook it in the oven, I boil to pasta to desired doneness and fold the sauce in letting it set in the hot pot w/ the heat turned off until I serve.  The dish is very saucy and has an excellent flavor!

This was really tasty! Due to my mustard allergy, I could not include the dry mustard :(. Other than that I made the recipe exactly as directed. The blue cheese had me a little skeptical, but I have to say this will be the new "family" recipe for Mac and Cheese. I made two batches, one exactly as directed and the other I added buttered Panko crumbs to the top before baking. Delish!!! The only issue I thought was it was not creamy enough, it was very flavorful, but it needed just a little bit more of the cheeses. Will totally make again!!

AWESOME!! I never really thought about adding just a little blue cheese to this and the ground mustard but WOW! So creamy and heated up well as leftovers too. I made a lot of this and was glad I did! I will be making this always!

This is my go to mac and cheese recipe. The best I have ever made or tasted, everyone agrees. Do not change a thing as it bakes the sauce is aborbed a little by the macaroni and it turns out perfectly, The only thing I do is double the recipe, cuz it goes quick in my house!!!

Turned out great.  Wanting to increase the amount, I used about 12 oz. of the pasta but only increased the cheddar cheese and doubled the blue cheese.  Increased the onion and added some minced garlic.  Will do it exactly like this again.

I never really get a homemade feel from stuff with Velveeta, but this was totally delicious. The little bit of cheddar and blue cheese (I used Gorgonzola) took away the processed taste from the Velveeta but left the creaminess.
