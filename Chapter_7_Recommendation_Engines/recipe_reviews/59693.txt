Brought this dish to a church pot luck last night and everyone loved it.  I made a few changes.  I used one pound of low sodium bacon, about a 1/4 cup of finely chopped red onion instead of the onion powder, and 1/2 cup mayo. and 1/3 cup ranch dressing, grated black pepper.  Topped the dish with grape tomatoes. Yummmmy!

I have made this without the tomatoes and it is great, especially for lunch in the summer.  Serve on Hawaiian bread.

This is good although I changed some things.  Only added 5 slices of bacon b/c I thought the bacon flavor would be too overwhelming and I'm glad I did, I think I will leave it out all together next time.  All it does it take away from the crab.  I also added a few squirts of ranch dressing and a sprinkling of garlic salt and a little bit of fresh ground pepper.  It's better to make this ahead of time and let it sit for a few hours to a day in order to let the flavors meld together.

Great salad!  I did a couple things different though.  I omitted the tomatoes and added 1 tbsp of sugar to the mayonnaise.  Yum!

Great recipe.  I have made some clunkers, but my boyfriend commented very favorably on this one and I was looking forward to the leftovers fondly the next day at work.

Nice lunch!  I scaled down the recipe and had to fudge some of the quantities for what I had on hand, but it was still delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really tasty.  I didn't have any tomatoes so I omitted them.  Everything else I followed exact.  I will make this again!

I left the bacon out, just because every time I add bacon to a salad it gets gross and soggy and I didn't want to risk it.  It tasted fabulous... the whole family thought so and it was gone within two hours of when I told folks it was in the fridge!

I love this crab salad! I make it often for friends coming over, I've always gotten rave reviews! I always forget the tomatoes though, and usually the onion powder. I also like to add chunks of block cheese as I'm a big cheese fan. :)

I made this last night and followed the recipe exactly. Let it mellow in the fridge til today so the flavors could blend. I thought it just so-so. After reading all the reviews, I added more onion salt, some chopped garlic, a couple of pinches of sugar, a little vinegar to thin out the mayo, and some shredded Colby/jack cheese. I was much happier with the taste, but I think there are way too many peas. I will make it again with my changes, and next time increase the crabmeat and decrease the peas.
