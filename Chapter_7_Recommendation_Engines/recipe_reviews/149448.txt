I was taking this to a BBQ. The honeydew melon that I bought was flavorless and when I first combined the ingredients it didn't taste good. I refrigerated it anyway and took it to the BBQ. It got rave reviews. Tastes like a Mojito. The melon marinated and soaked up all of the flavors from the lime juice, cilantro and mint. The melon was not flavorless after all. A big hit. Everyone wanted the recipe.

I was sceptical about this combintion.  I was afraid the herbs would be odd simply chopped (chucnks of cilantro and mint).  IT IS AWESOME!!!!  I just started a low fat/calorie diet and am trying to incorporate more fresh fruit.  I cannot say enough about this recipe - it is excellent.  My husband even liked it and he is pretty old fashioned (meat and potatos kind of man).  He said it tasted exotic.  The only things I changed were I used Equal instead of sugar and I used papaya in addition to the honeydew.

This is a great flavor combo, the Cilantro, Lime and Mint bring out the flavors of the fresh fruit.  I didn't feel Honey Dew was enough color so I also added Cantaloupe, Strawberries, Blueberries, and Pineapple... Great Snack.

I doubled the recipe, which made the melon too tall to really sit in the lime juice, which is crucial!  No matter how much you toss, it's not the same.  I used maybe 5T lime (one big lime), and I still could have used more.  I think muddling might help the lime/cilantro flavors, but you cannot scrimp on marinating time.  24 hours had it at its best.  I used honeydew and cantaloupe, but I think I'd prefer the honeydew alone.

Very refreshing! I added strawberries and didn't change a thing otherwise. I made it for a bbq my husband and I were having and we didn't have leftovers. Made it again for brunch with the same result. Thanks for the recipe

This was excellent, light and easy.  Instead of sugar, I used honey and a little bit of jalapeno jelly.  It was very tasty.

Very yummy!  I added cantaloupe chunks and blueberries.  It was very good but the lime, cilantro, and mint go really, really well with the honeydew.  I will make this again.

This was wonderfully delicious.  It tasted so fresh.  

To help you out a bit with the measurements, I used 3/4 of the melon to make the 4 cups, 1 lime for the 1 tablespoon of juice, and 1 full package of fresh mint for the 1/3 cup.  I also added about 1/2 package of sliced fresh strawberries that were sweet enough so that the "white sugar to taste" was not even needed.  If you do add strawberries, it will turn the melon slightly red on the edges so you might want to add them when about to serve.  

I will most definitely make it again!

Delicious and refreshing.  I would love to switch it up and make it with watermelon or canteloupe.  I also think adding just a pinch of salt would make all of the flavors "pop" just a bit more.  I will try that next time...

This is actually a surprisingly delicious recipe :) It tastes so refreshing and light! The mint and cilantro infuses into the melon, giving it "mojito" flavor (minus the rum)! If you happen to add too much lime the 1st time around, just sprinkle in a little more sugar to balance it all out. Definately make the night before to give it the best flavor!

This was not very good, and I like all of the ingredients in the salad separately.  I made it exactly as specified in the recipe and let it marinade for 8 hours in the fridge but it just tastes wrong.  The cilantro and mint together are weird.

Made this for a breakfast meeting and it was a huge hit!  I love that it's not so sweet and dessert-like, as most fruit salads tend to be.  Everyone loved the mint & cilantro combination and best of all... it gave me something to actually USE my mint for!  :)  I used cantelope, honeydew and strawberries.  You could sub just about any fruit and have it come out delicious!

I took this to a co-workers BBQ B-Day party. It was a hit! Everyone loved it. I stayed true to the recipe. No one had ever seen the Cilantro with Mint with melons. Made a refreshing snack throughout the night. It may sound like a strange combo, but try it.

I was so sceptical - I only tried this recipe to use up the mint in our garden & the not so ripe honeydew.  I tasted the fruit each time I added the mint & then the cilantro.  Wondeful! the only subsituted honey for the sugar, and used cantelope & watermelon along w/ the honeydew to add color.  Thanks for the recipe - this is a definite KEEPER!

It was good, but the taste of the fresh fruit was almost lost in the mint and cilantro taste.  I think I would dial back the amt of herbs next time.  Also, this isn't something you can save since the fruit seemed to start fermenting/spoiling quickly when stored.

This made a great side to the grilled salmon I prepared for the family's Sunday supper.  I changed it up a bit by adding cantelope and cucumber, and I cut back on the cilantro as a personal preference. Prepared it in the morning for our meal at 4pm.

Yummy! Even though I changed this recipe to fit what I had on hand in the house, the basic flavor was a nice balance and refreshing.   I had only watermelon, so decided to try that and added about 1 cup of strawberry slices as others suggested.  Trying to cut back on carbs....I used Splenda rather than sugar, and let in marinate for at least 4 hours.   Both my husband and I liked it very much and will certainly make it again with other combinations of melon and tropical fruit.  I added the zest of the lime I used as well, and really feel that is what makes this recipe pop....Fresh LIME! Yummmmy!

I was so nervous about this after I started making it.  Like another reviewer wrote it seemed off for some reason. I ended up adding strawberrys and grapes to it and did a little prayer it would turn out okay.  So after sitting in the refridge a few hours I tried it.  It turned out sooo yummy!  Tastes like a Mojito for sure!!!  The flavors really compliment each other.

Delicious, fresh, and raw!  We omitted sugar and added fresh pineapple.  We ate it right away, so I can't wait to see what it tastes like after 2 hours in the refrigerator.  I'll be using the lime, cilantro, mint dressing on fruit when we need a refreshing change from plain fruit and also for parties.

Was skeptical. Didn't taste like much once it was mixed up. Definitely let it sit a few hours. Brought it to a party, everyone loved it! A keeper for summer. Lite and refreshing.

Brought this in for a light breakfast side item for  work party so I made it the night before. Mental note: the sugar you use WILL make the melon sweat overnight. When I went to take it out of the fridge after making it the night before, it was full of melon water. It still tasted delicious after I drained it but I lost a lot of the herbage.

I needed to use up a melon and this was perfect.  I added some cucumber pieces for a bit more crunch and served it on butter lettuce leaves as a starter salad. Everyone loved it, but I'm still not sure it was right for a starter.  Although it was very refreshing, it was (fruit) sweet, and seemed better suited to a buffet or brunch. It was certainly delicious and I would make it again.

I omitted the sugar and replaced it with some pineapple as someone else suggested and it was fantastic! It is incredibly light and refreshing.

I served this at a brunch and everyone loved it. I did omit the cilantro since I do not care for it. Very refreshing on a warm day.

A little too sweet for me.  I will not make again.
