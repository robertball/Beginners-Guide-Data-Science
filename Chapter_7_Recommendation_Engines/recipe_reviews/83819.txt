There are three components to this cake -  the filling, the topping and the cake itself, each as good as or better than the next. This cake is perfect and mouth-watering good in every way. I used fresh strawberries for the filling and added water to compensate, enough so as it cooked and thickened it was about the consistency of canned cherry pie filling (which, by the way, would also make a good filling for this cake).  I also added a few drops of red food coloring to give it a good, rich red color.  To tell the truth, I forgot to add the lemon juice but I'm glad I did, as there is plenty of tartness in the rhubarb.  That filling is so good Hubs ate it on some vanilla ice cream as I was waiting for it to cool!  The cake is rich, buttery and moist. Could there be any doubt with all that butter and buttermilk? Out of this world...  And the topping, ohhh, the topping -  buttery, sugary, and a little crunchy.  You will not find a better coffee cake.  And I don't mean just Strawberry Rhubarb Coffee Cake.  I mean ANY coffee cake.  Not at Starbucks.  Not at Grandma's.  Not anywhere.  I will keep this cake in mind for the future and will love to try other fillings when strawberries or rhubarb aren't available.  In the meantime, 'tis the season to make the most of strawberries and rhubarb and this is the perfect recipe for that.

This recipe is truly wonderful.  The cake turns out high and fluffy, and the strawberry/rhubarb contrast is wonderful!

I've now made this cake threee times, because my dad keeps requesting it! I made mine in an angel food cake pan, and it turned out perfectly. The moist cake blends perfectly with the sweet filling. Love it!

This is an excellent recipe.  Be aware that the batter is thick and sticky.  Get enough of it on the bottom of the pan to cover.  Then dollop the topp of the filling with the batter and don't worry too much if the top is not covered, but do cover the top very well with the topping - which turns sweet-crunchy!

My only remark (and not complaint) is that the coffee cake is so good that it overwhelms the filling - even though I used a quart of freshly sliced strawberries to make the cake.  This cake is sure to be a crowd pleaser!

This coffee cake is not only delicious, it's very pretty - pink peeks out from under the crumby sweet topping.  The cake itself is very light with a tender crumb.  I did have to make a few changes; used fresh strawberries (approx. 15 ounces), and because I didn't have any buttermilk I subbed light cream with a touch of lemon juice added.  I also added nutmeg to the batter, used brown sugar instead of white for the crumb topping and also added cinnamon to it.  Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, this was absolutely satisfying.  I will most certainly be making this again.

I love anything with Strawberry and Rhubarb and this sure is a nice change from the usual pies.  I love the fact that you cook the filling separate and then add it to the cake as a middle layer.  I ended up making this in a Bundt pan, and didn't use all the filling, maybe half of it. It took about 48 minutes to bake and came out delish.  I added chopped pecans to the topping and a tich of cinnamong and I also added about a tsp of cinnamon to the cake batter after reading some reviews saying it was bland, the addition of the cinnamon nicely complimented the strawberries and rhubarb.  With making it in the Bundt pan, I had to reverse the order of the layering (put crumb topping in the bottom of the pan and then cake batter, topping and cake batter), served it with ice cream for Father's Day dessert, it was very well received and as I said above, a nice change from the standard pies! :) Thanks for the great recipe!

What a great thing to have for a lazy early summer morning on the patio with a cup of coffee. Made it exactly as written except subbed the milk/vinegar trick for buttermilk as I was out and added about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the crumb topping.  I also used fresh strawberries in place of the frozen, again....it's what I had. Really delicious and easy to put together. Made the house smell great!

Good, but not fantastic.  I think next time I will double the filling (or half the cake), but reduce the sugar as hubby and I both prefer our rhubarb more tart than sweet.  Also, for the topping I might sub brown for the white sugar and add cinnamon as others have suggested.  

Just a hint for the layer of batter on top of the filling - the batter is rather thick so spreading is a bit of a challenge, but if you just glob it on randomly and then flatten your globs a bit with a spoon (you will still see quite a bit of filling uncovered) it really does bake up nicely to cover the filling.

This is one of the easiest and best strawberry/rhubarb desserts I have ever made.  You cannot go wrong with this one.  

The second time I made it I put all of the cake batter on the bottom, topped it with the strawberry rhubarb mixture and then pu on the topping.  This worked better for me as it kept the topping on top and not falling off.

First of all this recipe is TO DIE FOR!!!  I made it last night, brought it to work today and people devoured it.  This is just so good I have to make another one this weekend!  

I made the recipe as is. Did not make any changes to it at all. I did read all the reviews before, hesitated on if I would add cinnamon to it or not (have made aunt Norma's rhubarb muffins from this site, which have cinnamon in the topping and they are delish!) but decided in the end to just try it as is. I'm glad I did because it really is perfect just the way it is. The texture of the cake is amazing, the filling is divine and the topping is perfect

My only advice, when you're making the filling, stir it constantly or it will most probably stick to the bottom of your saucepan even on medium heat. Frozen strawberries are watery enough that you don't need to add any water to it.  The lemon juice won't make it too sour, don't worry about it. Like I said, the recipe is perfect as is.

The batter of the cake is really really thick. You did not do anything wrong, you did not forget any eggs, it's supposed to be that way. When assembling the cake, after spreading the filling, as one reviewer said, just take a spoon and drop dollops of the batter on top of the filling. It probably won't cover the whole filling, mine didn't, not even close, but you will add the crumble topping after and once it cooks, the cake will spread and you won't see any filling, it'll turn out great.
Thanks for this amazing recipe!

Yummmmmm! This was wonderful! Knowing however, that sugar is not good for me, I did reduce the sugar as I always do. And you'd never know it. I could probably reduce it even more next time. For the filling I used 1/2 cup, for the cake 2/3 cup and for the topping 1/2 cup. And next time I will use even less. The cake was very tender, light and buttery. The filling was a perfect mix of sweetness and tartness with a little crunch on top from the topping. The crumbs were a perfect amount. The cake puffed up quite a bit while baking. In fact I thought it was going to over flow, but did not. After removing it from the oven after exactly 45 min. it settled somewhat in the pan and looked wonderful.  I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to company. Simply divine!

This recipe is absolutely fabulous-tasting!  It bakes up very tall and light.  I did make several slight alterations, as follows:

The recipe says to combine sugar and corn starch in a saucepan, then to add fruit, bring to boil, and boil 2 minutes.  Well, there is no juice in freshly-sliced rhubarb and strawberries, so I added 1/2 cup water to melt the sugar mixture, then cooked that.  I also used freshly ground whole white wheat flour, to add a nutritional and taste boost.  I will definitely be making this recipe again and again!

This cake has become my instant favourite.The tartness of the rubarb, does not make it overly sweet.The combination of the two fruits keeps the cake stay very moist, although it never lasts long enough to dry out.

Very good.  The cake was very moist and the filling just the right amount.  Next time I will probably reduce the amount of cornstarch a bit as I could taste it in the filling.  I used fresh strawberries and probably used a bit more than 10 ounces because we could taste a lot more strawberries than rhubarb.  I may add some cinnamon to the topping next time too.

This was interesting.  I had to use up some frozen fruit (freezer gone kaput!) so I used a mixture of rhubarb, strawberries and raspberries and used more fruit (and less cornstarch) than called for.  The filling was fabulous!  I tossed in a couple of handfuls of sweetened flake coconut to the topping which I also thought was excellent.  The cake was...okay.  It seemed a little dry and the bottom seemed to get overcooked, almost tough.  I ended up cutting off the bottom 1/2 inch to serve.  A little vanilla ice cream on the side makes it very good.

I halved this recipe and then added a cup of milk instead of 1/2 cup.  I also used fresh rhubarb from my garden.  It wasn't enough, so I used more strawberries to make up the difference.  I used 1/3rd whole wheat flour and 2/3rds white.  It turned out light and fluffy and sweet and tangy.  My 4-yr-old. said "This is the yummiest cake I've ever had."  It will be come a spring favorite.

I admit...it was still slightly warm before I got to the point where I couldn't wait any longer to enjoy a piece! INCREDIBLE! Really, no other coffee cake can compete with this. I KNEW it would be a winner with the way the filling and the cake batter tasted even before baking (yes, I sampled!). Really, there isn't anything I would do to change this recipe. At all. Except make a bigger pan of it =)  I love the "old-fashioned" (or is it just "homemade") taste this recipe magically provides. Just can't say enough good things about it!

The cake is NOT a batter.  It had to be spread in the pan with the fingers or a spoon.  When adding it over the filling, it was just dropped on in small clumps.  The cake definitely needs more flavoring like cinnamon or nutmeg.  It is very bland.  A tip about the fruits.  After washing them. dry them with a paper towel.  Otherwise the filling will be too runny.

This was great, despite the large butter involved. :)  I  couldn't get the top layer of batter to spread at all, so I ended up kind of mixing it with the fruit layer. I put on the topping, and it turned out fine!

This coffee cake just became my husband's favorite.  He has asked for it a few times now.  I used a bag of frozen mixed berries and it came out perfect.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This cake didn't quite work for me.  The topping was thin and the cake was overbaked as a result while trying to reduce the liquid in the cake.  Note:  Both strawberries and rhubarb were fresh.

Amazing! I am quite thrilled with myself right now b/c this recipe is so delicious! Thanks ARKBUCKS.  Minor adjustments:  Sub'd 2 c. wheat flour for white and added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to the cake batter. Sub'd brown sugar for white in the topping and also added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.  Then a VERY GENEROUS sprinkling of cinnamon sugar right after I pulled it out of the oven.  The cake batter is thick and a bit difficult to spread around the bottom of the pan. But it bakes up light (not like a heavy pound cake). I didn't have enough of the remaining 1/3 to cover the entire top, but I made sure that there was plenty of struesel topping ot make up for it.  I made it for work and my husband and I ended up eating a good portion hot out of the oven. We both agreed it would be even more outstanding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.   SOOOO GOOD!!

This may be a truly foolproof recipe. 

When I made it, having used a full quart of fresh strawberries (hulled and halved) and a bit more than the called-for rhubarb, I was concerned that I had too much filling ... and not enough batter, especially when I had only enough batter for about four non-connecting glops to optimisitically smear around on top of the "too-much" filling. I only hoped the crumb topping would somehow fill in the gaps. 

Surprise!

The various elements apparently re-configured themselves during the baking. The finished coffeecake had a thin -- but sufficient -- layer of cake at the bottom ... and a nice layer of cake above the filling! Go figure!  It got rave reviews from my co-workers!

By the way, I forgot to add the lemon juice and did add a half-teaspoon of cinnamon to the topping.

This cake is delicious!  Instead of frozen berries, I sliced up fresh berries an used 1 3/4 cup.  Next time I will probably use 2 1/4 cups of strawberries and 2 1/4 cup of rubarb.  We like a little more filling in baked goods.

Gluten Free version:  Replaced 3 cups flour with the following: 1 cup rice flour, 2/3 c tapioca flour, 1/3 cup corn starch, 1/3 cup potato starch, 1/3 cup sorghum flour, 1/3 cup millet flour.  Added 3 tsp xanthan gum to this mixture. for the sugary topping I just replaced the flour with rice flour.  This was fantastic.  Perfect combo of cake, fruit, and topping.

I have made this twice now and we absolutely love it!  I used fresh rhubarb from our garden and fresh strawberries so added water to filling mixture. I did add more fruit to the filling the second time as we like the friut but it is still good as is. My husband loves strawberry rhubarb pie but I'm not a big fan but we both love this.  Thanks!

This was great! I was a little concerned with the recipe (had to double check it) when there was no liquid with the fruit and sugar mixture. I was sure it would burn on my stove. But the fruit juices started to flow before it had a chance and it turned out just right! Lovely way to use rhubarb!!

Fantastic recipe. I added some nutmeg to the filling and the topping. Yum.  btw, this is almost the same recipe I found in my BHG cookbook when looking for a coffee cake recipe. Only a little difference in the filling and this one less baking soda I think. Either way it's wonderful and I will definitely be making it again. To save time for the next cake I made up extra batches of the cake part minus the milk, eggs and vanilla; put it in freezer bags and threw it in the freezer.

Lovely Cake!!!
This cake was very simple to make and tastes amazing!
I had never cooked with rhubard before, but it turned out so well and everyone loved it.
This cake is definately a keeper and i will be making it again in the not too distant future! 
Yuuuuum!
Thanks.

(oh and my only advise is that you cook it with a decent sized baking tin as there is a fair ammount of mixture.)

Very good coffee cake. The next day I'd pop a piece in the microwave for 20 seconds and top with vanilla ice cream. Very yummy! I think I may have overcooked it a bit, as it was drier than I'd like, but it was probably my fault.

This was seriously, the best Rhubarb coffee cakes/desserts I have ever tasted. I made it with gluten free ingredients and it was just as good as if I had used regular flour. That being said, following the directions was difficult. I am a very experienced cook (46 years), but this recipe had three different layers and the ingredient list was all over the map! I would suggest that "All recipes" list ingredients in the order in which they are to be used in the future, as this was not the first time I have come across this. An inexperienced cook may have added all of the sugars in one bowl if they didn't read the instructions first. I would suggest the recipe be rewritten to include ingredients for the batter, the fruit layer, and the topping. Thanks for listening

I made this coffee cake but I did double the filling and I am glad I did.I used a little less than a cup of sugar for 4 cups of rhubarb and a pound of strawberries and may use even less sugar next time.  I cooked the rhubarb alone and then added sliced fresh strawberries. I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry ingredients, the fruit and the topping.  I also added about a 1/2 cup of oatmeal to the topping, and used half a cup of brown sugar and only a quarter of a cup of white sugar.

At 45 minutes my cake tester wasn't coming out clean so kept baking for another 15 minutes--still wasn't coming out clean but I took it out anyway.  Yep, it's dry as a bone except for the gooey center. I bet this cake is normally very good and I will probably try it again some day.  Trust your instincts not the cake tester!

This is WONDERFUL!!  I didn't have rhubarb, so I substituted frozen blueberries, and everyone raved about it.  The cake alone was delicious, but with the layer of berries in between, it made this a treat.

The batter was thicker than cake batter (that could have been my flaut) so it was hard to spread on the top of the filling.  But it still turned out really good.  The crumbly topping is very yummy!

This is a wonderful way to use rhubarb. It is sweet and flavorful, and pretty! I did end up using extra strawberries and rhubarb, so I added a bit more corn starch. It was very rich and delicious.

It was barely OK if you served it with vanilla ice cream. By itself I would have thrown it out rather than wasting the calories on it. (and I love strawberries and rhubarb)

So good. I used frozen rhubarb and mashed until stringy in a saucepan with a little water before adding the strawberries. I also used oats instead of flour for the topping. Excellent recipe!

We like it but I would double the filling or as I am going to do  macerate strawberries and add to the top.  I baked it in a dark
pan and the bottom was a little too dark for our liking and I took out at 47 minutes.  Next time I will either use a different pan, shorten the time or reduce the temp.

Very good coffee cake. I agree with previous comments about the batter.  It’s very thick and sticky - not pourable. The top batter can only be dropped in spoonfuls on top of the fruit, not at all spreadable. This is not a quick recipe to put together. I was surprised how light and fluffy the cake turned out to be. I would prefer a little more fruit filling.  Overall, a tasty coffee cake.

So delicious...I added extra fruit in the filling, vanilla to the cake part, and 1/2 package of sweetened coconut to the topping.

I didn't double the filling but I did one and a half it, and it still could have been more.  I used Einkorn flour, because I'm gluten sensitive, but it turned out pretty well. It puffs up a LOT.  I thought it would be very flat,  after putting it into the pan, but quite the opposite.  I do think nuts on top would be a great addition, and I would likely cut the sugar in half, somewhere along the line, or just cut it out of the filling completely, because the rest of it is very sweet as is.

This was delicious - I loved the tartness of the filling with the rest of the cake. I used brown sugar and put some cinnamon in for the topping. It does use a lot of butter so I may use the recipe from a different coffee cake I have with the filling from this one.

I have lots of rhubarb in my garden, so I'm always on the hunt for good recipes ... and this is a good one!
The cake bakes up quite tall, so I was concerned that it would not bake through completely. The  first toothpick test showed that the centre was a bit damp so I left it in a few minutes longer. I added 1 tsp almond flavoring to the batter, which was a wonderful addition. It smelled wonderful while it was baking!

Amazing. I couldn't find the strawberries in my freezer but was delicious without them. Skipped the milk and used sour cream and a touch of almond vanilla milk. Out of vanilla so I put about 1-1.5 tsp of cinnamon. Will make again

Very nice adaptable recipe. The filling came out great, I did eyeball it though. No set measurements. 
The cake itself is a great basic start point for a coffee cake. I subbed in vanilla yogurt for the buttermilk, as thats what I had on hand added a little milk to get the consistency right. And cut the sugar in half. Already sweetened yogurt plus a sweetened filling and the crumb topping? No way this recipe needs a full cup of sugar.  I do have my own preferred crumb topping of half a stick of butter melted, two handfulls of oats, 1/2c approx of flour, a palms worth of brown sugar and the same of white.

The batter was difficult to work with and trying to spread anything on top was impossible.  I used canned cherry pie filling instead of strawberries but I doubt that would have made any difference.

More than a little tired of the sheer Work involved in building strawberry rhubarb pie, I decided this was an excellent alternative.   Won't do that again!  Long story short, what a mess!   Yeah, it turned out okay but man oh man, the pile of dirty dishes that stared back at me while the cake baked made me want to cry!    & sticky?!?  O.M.G. the batter is next to impossible to work sanely with.  Thankfully, it was tasty & particularly good warm with ice cream but for the work involved, frankly I'm not overly impressed with this dessert.

I would make this again.  It was really easy and all my friends thought that I had bought it when they tasted it!!  The changes that I made were, I used regular milk instead of buttermilk, in the middle of the recipe I found that I was out of lemon juice and baking soda so I just didn't use any lemon juice and almost tripled the baking powder and it still turned out really good!

This is one of my top 5 recipes on this website! My husband was not a fan of coffee cakes until this recipe and if allowed he would eat the whole pan himself! Thank you so much for this recipe and I am sooo looking forward to making this with other fruits as well!

Yes I will make it again. 
I did a bit of substituting for what I had on hand. 
11/2 cups oil for butter in batter
sour milk - with lemon juice for buttermilk
Crumble was 2 cups oats, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, and 1/2 cup flour to 1/2 cup butter.

Loved it. However, I substituted 1/2 of the white sugar with brown sugar and used a berry mixture (blueberries, blackberries and raspberries) instead of the strawberries, and double the amount of the berry mixture.  I ended up with some filling left over, which I saved to use on ice cream. :)

I love coffee cake. The only thing I changed was that I used organic cane sugar(I don't think that's much different than table sugar except that it isn't bleached).  4 stars because it tasted a little overly doughy, just a little. I'll definitely make it again and experiment to see why my first one was doughy

We really liked this cake, very tasty and versatile. I didn't have any rhubarb/strawberries so I used frozen blueberries instead. I halved the recipe for a 9x9 pan, kept the fruit filling at full amount (used 20  oz by weight) reduced sugar to 2 tbsps and kept topping at full amount, baked in 40 minutes, cut into 9 large pieces. My son loved the topping, buttery and crunchy!

Its February in the Northeast and rhubarb is hard to come by, so I substituted blackberries for rhubarb and it came out excellent! I used dark brown sugar for the topping instead of light brown because that's all I had, and it gave the dish a nice praline quality. I made it for my boyfriend's family's super bowl party and it was loved by everyone.

Really good taste. We really enjoyed it. Next time I will add half a teaspoon salt to bring out the sweetness of the cake part.  Still it is a five star even lacking that. Will definitely be making it again and again.

I agree with them new reviewer that the filling needs to be doubled as there's too much cake for the filling. I may make more topping as well very fun though.

Way too much cake vs. the ratio of filling. If you make it like the recipe calls for double the filling.

it was good but not outstanding, like others I would double the filling.  The filling to cake ratio is off in my families option.  I would also reduce the sugar a lot especially in the topping, to me it was just sugar and nothing else.  As I had fresh strawberries that is what I used instead of frozen, I just added some water to the filling which worked just fine

Excellent cake, have all ingredients prepped  and you're good to go.  The batter is very heavy so place it in the cake pan, by large spoonfuls, then press with back of spoon to spread.   I used fresh rhubarb from the garden, and frozen strawberries, white sugar for cake and brown sugar, cinnamon and chopped walnuts for topping, 
I may have left too much for the top  because when I took it out of the (angel) cake pan, the filling just flowed down the side of the cake.  Or perhaps it wasn't quite cool enough.  In any case it was a hit, it makes a substantial cake  to feed a crowd of ten at least.  A wonderful alternative for strawberry/rhubarb lovers.

Absolutely love it! Strawberries and rhubarb are my favorites but the is never enough fruit for my taste.  This recipe hits all the right spots enough fruit,cake rich but not overwhelming and topping sweet enough to complement the tartness of the rhubarb. I used frozen fruit from the store which I did not measure and it turned out beautifully!

Fantastic recipe!! Didn't have buttermilk so used some milk with a splash of lemon juice in it. Used fresh strawberries and made a bit more strussel topping than stated (I didn't measure). Baked in two 9x5 foil tins so I could put one in the freezer. Cooked for 55min because it didn't seem quite set at 45-50 min but I probably could have gone with 50 (I was just being paranoid).

I didn't try the recipe exactly as written but made one substitution.   I used brown sugar instead of white sugar for the topping.   This was an excellent cake and I got a number of compliments on it.  I will absolutely be making this again.

I just made this cake and it is wonderful.  I had canned Rhubarb last season and wanted to use it up since it's almost in season again.  I had canned the rhubarb in a light syrup but it was very thick so all I did was add a couple tbs lemon juice to two pints of the Rhubarb, no cooking, sugar, strawberries or cornstarch.   The cake turned out beautiful and delicious. Will definitely make again.

So good!!! I used brown sugar for the crumb topping instead of white, added cinnamon to both cake and crumb topping, used extra strawberries, skipped the lemon juice, and used all butter (no margerine), DELICIOUS!!!!!
