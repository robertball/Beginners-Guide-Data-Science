It was a different way to have strawberries, but there are definitely better ways to have strawberries.  Didn't really care for it- neither did my husband.

Really good fruit dip.  Better than what I bought in the store.  My husband and daughter loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a really simple and excellent way to serve strwberries.   The only change I make is to use demerara sugar - this was in my original recipe and, for my taste buds, this is better.   Try it you might like it!

My co-workers and I tried this recipe with a little South Beach makeover.  We used light sour cream and Splenda brown sugar and it was awesome!  We all loved it.
