I have made these twice and absolutely love them.  I put the brownie mix in my piping bag with a large tip, than filled the cupcake paper up half way with the cake batter.  Inserted the tip of my piping bag into each cupcake and squished me out some brownie mix into the middle of each one.  Frosted with store bought chocolate frosting, YUM!

I prepared these as directed and frosted them with a deep, rich chocolate frosting I thought was a great match, "One Bowl Buttercream Frosting," also from this site.  There's not much more I can add to nearly 100 fantastic reviews for these cupcakes about preparation or taste.  What I *would" like to add, however, is that what this recipe is all about, what lovestohost has singlehandedly accomplished with her successful experiments, (I refer also to her other infamous cupcake and cake recipes) is to make baking fun and to create whimsical treats.  More than the finished product it's about the experience and the sheer joy you get from making these and her other recipes. Offhand, I can think of no other recipe with that distinction that is also so quick, easy, and that works for every baker, novice or skilled. These ARE a treat - for those baking them, for those who make these as a baking project with children, as well as for everybody eating them.  Great recipe(s) lovestohost.  It was a fun baking experience with a delightful result and I admire your creativity!

Yummy! These are pretty quick and cheap to make and take heavenly! First time made according to the directions and the second time I chilled the brownie batter before scooping it into cupcaking batter and this yielded yummy gooey centers. I love these cupcakes, I don't even bother to frost. 5-star with the chilling of the brownie batter and the addition of some extra vanilla to the cake batter. start check them at 15 min baking time.

These are terrific! I made them with red velvet cake mix and frosted them with homemade cream cheese frosting. Sooo good. They were fun to make and fun to eat. Dee-lish!

This recipe sounded great and with all the good reviews I thought I would try it. Afer cooking them for an hour I finally gave up cooking them. The cake batter was so over done while the brownie batter fully cooked. I opened the cupcake and the brownie was totally raw. Very disappointed.

Brownies are my favorite dessert so I couldn't wait to try this recipe! I used a vanilla cake mix and the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting as recommended by others-these cupcakes are exceptionally good!  I didn't want the brownie to stick to the bottom as someone mentioned, so I put a dollop of cake mix on the bottom, then a tablespoon of brownie batter followed by another dollop of cake mix-maybe it was just me, but it seemed a little time consuming.  Also I used a gas oven and maybe the cupcakes baked quicker, but my brownie baked along with the cupcake so there was no 'gooey brownie' in the center.  However, I have not stopped eating them because they are so good!  I used aluminum liners and my cupcakes did not stick and the peanut butter frosting is the best!  I will definitely make these again!

LTH, you've done it again! These rock! I frosted some with chocolate frosting, some with peanut butter frosting (Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting from this site), and some I swirled with both kinds. Very, very good. I love the little layer of gooey goodness in there. Thanks! :)

These turned out excellent, I used orange cake mix over chocolate-lovers brownie mix. Frosted them with a simple white frosting and they were very well received. I only broke my diet enough for one small bite (how's that for will-power), but very yummy ideed. Thanks LoveToHost

Well....hats off to LTH for an EXCEPTIONAL Recipe! One unbelievable Cuppie! I used a yellow cake mix and the "Baker's One Bowl Brownie" recipe from this site....mmm...mmm...mmmm! I took the suggestion of one reviewer who said she chilled the brownie batter - makes all the difference in the world! You get the ooey-gooey "almost" cooked through batter inside! I also took the suggestion of placing a couple spoonfuls of batter in the bottom of each cupcake liner FIRST (made easier by placing batter in a measuring cup, pours like a dream), THEN placing a scoop of chilled brownie batter and then pouring batter over top to 2/3rd's full...Baked for 20 minutes at 375F on CONVECTION....came out PERFECT! Hats off to the Creator! You have created a cupcake monster in me now! LOL!

These were amazing!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and tried to pipe the brownie batter into the middle of the cake batter. It was super messy because the brownie batter was thin, but I think it helped because the cupcakes didn't stick to the wrapper like other people mentioned. I couldn't even wait for frosting and it was a perfectly moist cupcake with gooey brownie in the middle. Definitely worth the mess! Thanks for the post!!!

How could you go wrong with these. So easy, and yummy. My brownies had a hard time pulling away from the paper cups so I try using a better liner, but they still tasted great. I didn't even frost mine. Ate them plain.

Oh, these are DIVINE!  I made Neopolitan cupcakes...brownie on the bottom, strawberry cake and vanilla frosting.  I used chewy brownie mix and moist deluxe cake which only adds to the scrumptiousness!  Baked for 21.5 minutes.

I made these yesterday for the grandkids (Yeah, the grandkids!!), and they turned out quite well.  Actually, all the problems were caused by ME, not the recipe.  I used a fudgy brownie mix and a yellow cake mix.  I made them with a dollop of cake mix on the bottom and without.  The ones with the cake on the bottom released from the papers much better than the others.  	 Found it easier to use two soup spoons to fill the cupcake pans.  (Of course, M’Lady and I had to check to make sure that they were fit to eat; that’s why  they’re about half gone already, and not a grandkid in sight!)  Those with a bit of cake on the bottom came out of the liner very nicely, but the other ones stuck.  Maybe I didn’t bake them enough?  However, the cake was done perfectly.  I got about 30 cupcakes out of the batch, and about 6 brownie cakes.  (Just let the brownies bake about 5-6 minutes longer than the cupcakes.  I’m going to work on transferring the batter to the pan.  Maybe a baster?  Just thinking!  However, M’Lady and I like them, and we’ll have to see what the grandkids say when they get here tomorrow.

I'm the recipe submitter and I realized I've yet to review these.  Maybe I should only give them FOUR stars, since they are my second favorite....hmmmmm.  While I was tweaking this recipe, I tried a few different methods:  brownie on bottom (per published recipe), piping brownie batter into the middle, and alternating spoonfuls of cake batter w/brownie batter...all worked fine; I just preferred the brownie on bottom variety as it left just the fault line of cake/brownie the slightest bit gooey (you'll have to find the perfect bake time for YOUR oven...for mine it is about 16 min).  For a super chocolatey indulgence, use chocolate cake mix!

Delicious! BEST CUPCAKE EVAR~! 
my comment is, that i guess some people didnt undertand the recipe. you were not supposed to prepare the cake mix as according to the box, you were supposed to add only the cake mix to the ingredients in this recipe. try it again, and it might work! :)

Absolutely perfect!  I used a Betty Crocker brownie mix, my own white cupcake batter, and a cookie scoop to divide both batters evenly between 24 cupcake wells.  These baked up beautifully in exactly 20 minutes, the cake was not overdone and the brownie was not overly-gooey.  After they cooled, I topped them with Hard Chocolate Glaze from this site.  I'm calling them Brownie Bottom Cupcakes :) UPDATE: Just made these for valentine's day and tinted the cake batter pink then covered in chocolate glaze.  Too cute!!

I used Ghiradelli Triple Chocolate Brownie mix and Betty Crocker white cake mix. I prepared these as directed with no problems. I took the suggestion of one reviewer and chilled the brownie batter beforehand which made a difference. I sprayed the inside of the cupcake liners with PAM cooking spray to avoid sticking. I put a dollop of the brownie mix and white cake mix on top. I made 30 cupcakes that baked up perfectly in 20 minutes in my gas oven. The cake was done, springy to the touch and light golden brown while the brownie was a nice fudgy, gooey brownie and not undercooked. I liked the perfect little brownie bite in the cupcake. The cupcake liner peeled right off with no problems sticking. I topped these off with,” Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting, “also from this website, a perfect match thanks to all of reviewers who suggested this! I just piped a little frosting on top, not a lot, so it did not overpower all the other tastes. Not only did the cupcakes smell and taste great but the layers of the dark brown brownie, white cake with the peanut butter frosting made for a nice looking treat. The combination of the brownie and peanut butter was perfect. I am glad that I finally got the chance to make these perfect little treats. This was easy to make, fun and a hit with everyone! Mahalo for the great recipe Lovestohost!

LTH these cupcakes are to die for. I had one even though I'm not suppose to eat sweets but it was worth it. I frosted them with the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting from this site which compliments them perfectly. I think I like these a little better than the cookie dough cupcake recipe but both are fantastic. Thank You

These cupcakes are SO fantastic!!! They are super easy to make. Like several other reviewers, I piped the brownie batter into the cake batter. (I used a large circular tip for this) This worked extremely well for me. There was a perfect little brownie bite in the middle of each white cupcake. They were very well received by the crowds! :) Super easy, super fun, super delicious!

I must agree with LTH. Her chocolate chip cookie dough cupcakes are the BOMB and by FAR her BEST creation yet!!! :) After having polished nearly half a dozen of LTH's cookie dough cupcakes (no kidding lol!), these just don't compare. Don't get me wrong.... These are yummy but just not AS good. As per LTH's suggestion (per her review), I subbed a dark chocolate (fudge) cake mix for the white one called for. Keep in mind, if you use ANYTHING other than a white cake mix, READ THE BOX DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY! White cakes are made with egg whites to help maintain the cake's white color. All other cakse are made with the ENTIRE egg (yolk AND white). Rather than layering a dollop of cake batter, a 1/3 of the brownie batter and the remaining 2/3 of my cupcake liner with MORE cake batter (as many reviewers have done), I followed LTH's directions TO THE LETTER. My only change (other than subbing a different flavor cake mix), was to chill my brownie batter slightly to ensure this part of my cupcakes remained gooey when baked (thanks karguo!). I lightly sprayed each liner with cooking spray to ensure my brownie layer would not stick (worked like a charm). I topped each cupcake with chocolate fudge buttercream frosting and chopped PB cups. With these changes, I ended up with a cupcake similar (both flavor and texturewise) to a decadent, chocolatey truffle. Mmmmm.... Thanks for sharing another one of your unique recipes, LTH! :-)

These are excellent!  However, they only make 24, not 48, regular sized cupcakes.  I also make my own brownie batter and I make 1/2 a recipe and it's the perfect amount this one cake mix.  My picture is #49 and shows the brownie in the middle.  I achieved this by putting some cake batter on the bottom of the liner, then used a one teaspoon cookie scoop to add the brownie, then topped with more cake batter.  I topped with Caramel Frosting V from this site (which I followed the reviews for and added 3 cups of powdered sugar while beating.  It made enough for about 28 cupcakes).  Thanks for a fabulous new dessert!  I've gotten amazing feedback, including one comment that it was the best thing she'd ever eaten.

I made the recipe exactly as written. I would of rather just had the brownies. I think it would be better using a different flavored cake mix.

These were great!  The only change I made was I followed the directions on my brownie mix, as the box was bigger than the size called for in the recipe.  I used silicone baking cups and they did not want to come out.  I let them cool completely, and they were still tough.  Will have to take some of the others' advice next time I make these.  Thanks!

These were delicious.  I followed the cooking time and temp on the first batch but the brownie came out raw.  I increased the temp to 375 and cooked for 25 minutes for the next batch and they came out perfect.

I made this in a bundt pan just increasing the baking time to 45 minutes.  Brought it to a party and everyone loved it.  I layed the cake mix on the bottom/top and the brownie mix in the middle.

AMAZING!!!!!  I too put a tiny bit of batter in the bottom of each liner before adding brownie batter (which I'd refrigerated prior to putting it in; I felt it was easier to scoop out a chunck than try to pour batter in).  I used Duncan Hines yellow cake mix and Ghiradelli Triple Chocolate brownie mix and these were awesome!  I just frosted them with some Pillsbury Chocolate fudge frosting from a can and you would have thought they were gourmet "from scratch" cupcakes the way people fussed over them.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I used strawberry on top with brownie on bottom and vanilla frosting on top for a Valentine's themed cupcake. They were really good although my husband is requesting red velvet on top next time. I am leaning towards some sort of peanut butter flavor on top next time. These were great. I did about half of them in mini-muffin tins and cooked for about 15-16 min. I think I like them even better than the big ones!

Delicious! If you bake these exactly as the directions say then you will have no problem making amazing cupcakes! I took these to my cousin's going away party and let me tell you, she didn't want to leave after she tasted these! Everyone there just had to have the recipe!

Yummy! I used a yellow cake mix because I didn't have a white one and it was great.  Definitely refrigerate the brownie batter awhile and it makes it gooey when baked.

What a great idea for a cupcake. I made the simple white cake from this site and Brooke's bombshell brownies. I wasn't sure how it would turn out because it was my first time using both of those recipes, but they were delicious. I did put a small amount of cake batter on the bottom first but I don't even think that was necessary. Next time I will try it the way the recipe states, brownie on the bottom, cake on the top.

These were so good.  I did add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to the white cake mixture.  I cooked for an additional 10 minutes. So pleased that I finally got around to trying this recipe.

I made these and they are awesome. i didnt put the brownie in first though. I put a glob of brownie on the top. It helped to cook the brownie a little before it sank to the bottom so i didnt have the problem with the brownie being undercooked.

Just make sure you follow these ingredients, theyre slightly different from whats on the packages, and the reason why the brownies bake with the cupcake. Thanks for thsi one! im definatly using it againm

Very delish.  The only change I made was baking for 15 minutes.  Family and friends loved these!  However not sure how you get 48.  I only got 24 cupcakes with a bit of cake left over so I stuck it in a mug and microwaved for 1 1/2 minutes and made a Cup-Cake.  LOL!!

I could not get this recipe to work.  The brownie mix came out too heavy and they never cooked properly.  Perhaps this could be reworked.  The lighter cake mix was interesting.  The two sections separated when trying to take out of the pan.  Good idea, didn't work.

I have to admit its a toss up between these and the CCCD! These were awesome and made a ton! I used the high altitude directions for the brownies otherwise they never turn out for me but other than that followed the recipe to a T. They turned out perfect cooked cupcake and brownie with a decadent molten brownie center!! Thx once again LTH for  cupcake perfection. Oh, and I didn't frost any of mine as we thought they were awesome as is =))

I have made these cupcakes twice, and both times there were none left. They are so good, with or without frosting. I use the Fluffy Peanut Butter frosting recipe from this site. I use the foil cupcake liners and lightly spray the bottoms, never have any problem with them sticking. Even my husband who doesn't like peanut butter loves these. Thanks for a great recipe, am going to try the Choc. Chip Cookie Cupcakes next.

:( These were just okay. I was really, really excited to make them, because I LOVE the combination of yellow cake with chocolate anything...it's my favorite. We also LOVE brownies in this household lol...so I figured, this would be heaven! I followed the directions exactly, the cupcakes came out perfectly cooked, not overdone, and they don't have any issues sticking to the paper, so that is great :) However, the flavor just isn't doing it for me. Like a previous review said, the flavors need to be intensified somehow. The yellow cake mix tastes sort of bland. The brownie loses its flavor in there somehow too...so you end up getting the thick heavy consistency of the brownie with an almost too light consistency of cake uptop :( I frosted with classic chocolate frosting....I mean, they are good, they will get eaten. I'll have my hubby bring them to work....but I don't think I would make them again. :) Was worth a shot though! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made these cupcakes for my daughter's 8th birthday. I made the cupcakes as written and I did not have any problems with the batter sticking to the cupcake wrapper. The cupcakes were delicious and everyone loved them. I tried the fluffy peanut butter frosting recipe to put on them but that did not work out well and I ended up using store bought chocolate icing.

OMG!  These are SO good!  I can't believe it took me this long to finally try this recipe.  I made these to take to my daughter's swim meet tomorrow for the hospitality suite for the officials and coaches.  I am so excited to bring these - they are THAT good.  I made these exactly as written and topped them with "fluffy peanut butter frosting" (also from this site), as recommended by other reviewers.  The combination of these two recipes is something special.  This recipe itself is genius - but the pb frosting only takes it that much over the top.  My kids LOVED them, and are begging me to not take them all to the meet.  Thank you "lovestohost" for this great recipe!

I would agree that they are second best, the cookie dough cupcakes are definitely my favorite, but still very yummy! Put the brownie batter in the fridge for a few hours and it helped. Found that I could put batter down, then a blob of brownie and then the rest of the batter to fill the muffin case. Very yummy, will try peanut butter frosting next time.

made this recipe as directed but did it in a two layer cake for my boyfriends birthday.. i was nervous about making a cake instead of cupcakes..the cake turned out quite dense..everyone loved it but i wasn't happy .. i didn't get the gooey center i was hoping for..besides that i used milk instead of water like i usually do when baking a cake.. i ended up baking this for about 40 min which seemed like a long time for me but that's what my toothpick told me to do :) i used the peanut butter icing recipe to top and it was delicious and creamy and not oily whatsoever..i was told that it was better than the peanut butter icing on the cupcakes we got in New York!! I used Kraft creamy PB i don't think we can get jif in Canada :) i will definitely be making cupcakes next time.. thanks for the recipe!!!

i just tried my cake again and i was wrong!! it's absolutely delicious! it's so decadent ... yum!

I made these last night for a work potluck.  i was prepared to write that although they are good, they were a pain in the butt to make and i would probably never make again.  and then i ate one this morning.  OMG!  i want to make them again tonight!  they were perfect.  i also made the PB frosting as suggested.  I'm a novice cook, so almost everything is a pain in the butt to make!!

These were amazing.  I put the brownie batter in the fridge for an hour or so, and also put 1 tablespoon of cupcake batter at the bottom of the cupcake thing, then filled it 1/3 with brownie batter then did the other part cupcake batter.  The brownie was moist and delicious and was so yummy with the cupcakes!  These were a big hit everywhere I brought them (went to a few smaller parties, so 36 cupcakes that come out of this is great) These were a great twist on cupcakes, and I don't even think they needed icing - they were almost better without the icing...oh so yummy!  I won't be able to make these too often because I will eat wayyy too many of them b/c they are sooo good!  Definitely try this great twist on a recipe - it's easy too!  Can't wait to try the cookie dough cupcakes - if I had time to freeze the cookie dough, they would have been my first choice.  SO YUMMY thanks for sharing!!

I made these for my birthday and they were a hit! I used yellow cake mix, whole eggs, and Ghirardelli walnut brownie mix in jumbo foil cupcake liners to make two dozen cupcakes. I had to bake mine for about 30 minutes to account for the larger liners, but they still came out great- I didn't even frost them. Next time I make these, I'll try stuffing and frosting with the peanut butter icing everyone else raved about.

Made the recipe exactly as it's shown here, not on the box.  Didn't make 48, only made 36 for me, adjusted the baking time (my oven cooks slower) - but they came out perfect!  They were a big hit for ACA Cupcake Day even with a half sheet of cake, these definitely were preferred hands down - Thank you so much for sharing!

LOVE them.  It fulfilled my pregnancy craving.  Not all of the brownies turned out gooey for me- I've eaten 2 so far.. and one had a gooey brownie and one didn't.  I tried them both ways- putting the cake mix at the bottom, and the brownie mix at the bottom.  I think they are gooey-er when the brownie mix is on the bottom.  Used the fluffy peanut butter frosting as some other posters suggested.  LOVE LOVE LOVE them.

DELICIOUS!!! We halved the batter and only got 11 cupcakes (would have done 12 but only had 11 papers lol) - so the serving yield is off - but they are sooo yummy!

A little less confectioners sugar, and a little more cocoa, suited my taste more. Beat until the graininess of the con sugar decreases.

I have made these cupcakes but used a strawberry cake mix and added some fresh strawberries that I had chopped.  I topped them off with a vanilla frosting and called these my Neopolitan cupcakes. Took them to work and the were a HUGE hit!

I made this cupcake for a good friend's birthday party.  These were absolutely amazing.  I made my cupcakes with 1/3 brownie on the bottom and Strawberry cake on top with a cream cheese icing. I cooked my cupcakes for 25 mins at 350 degrees.  Please note that the brownie is going to be soft and gooey.  I love it like that and so did everyone else but anyone that is squimish about brownie batter that isn't fully cooked might want to cook just the brownie in the oven for a bit before adding the cake batter.  I also tried putting only a little brownie on the bottom instead of 1/3.  I found that the brownie still stayed gooey and when unwrapping these cupcakes the brownie stuck to the foil cups.  All the cupcakes that had 1/3 of the brownie came out of the foil cups without a problem.  I will definitely make these again and have been deemed the "cupcake maker" of the family now.

These turned out great and didn't need any frosting.  I made frosting from the Hershey's cocoa box but I thought it was too sweet when combined with these sweet treats.  

I only changed one part of the recipe.  I baked just the brownie part of the cupcake for five minutes before topping with the cake batter and baking for 20 minutes.  Everything was baked but not over-baked.  I will make these again and again and again!

These cupcakes were a HUGE success! I made mini cupcakes, and they were amazing! I layered the brownie mix on the bottom, and then I put a layer of white cake on top. (Simple White Cake by SCOTTOSMAN on this webiste). I put a chocolate chip in the center of each cupcake, and then frosted the cupcakes with "Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting" from this website. I then sprinkled chocolate crumbles on top to pull everything together. They were beyond incredible! I recieved rave reviews! At first I was worried that the cupcakes wouldn't bake evenly considering that there were 2 different mixes with 2 different baking times, but they came out fine! Better than fine- AMAZING! HIGHLY reccommend! I will be making these again for sure. And this yields A LOT of cupcakes- I was able to make 110 mini cupcakes. But not to worry- everyone will gobble them right up!

I spooned about a Tbsp. of cake batter into cupcake liners, then added a teaspoon of brownie batter, then topped with another Tbsp. cake batter, then baked. This prevented the cupcakes from sticking as other readers had problems with. However, while moist, I really found these cupcakes lacked flavor.  The white cake was bland, and the chocolate wasn't strong enough to come through.  If I make them again, I'll try adding some almond extract to the white cake batter, and perhaps I'll add some melted chocolate to the brownie batter.  Sorry, they just didn't do it for me.

Really good and easy recipe. I didn't get anywhere close to 48 cupcakes, but that might be pan size differences or something. Paired it with the fluffy peanut butter frosting. Husband and guests loved it. I also served it with homemade ice cream. Will likely make again.

I just rated/reviewed your Best cupcake recipe too. I made these one a couple weeks ago. SO good. Like I said, I can't decide which recipe is better. I shared these cupcakes with several different people and everyone LOVED them. When I made them, the brownie batter stayed a little gooey in the center which made it even better. This recipe, along with the cookie dough recipe, are both recipes that I highly recommend.

I was worried that the ingredients listed would not work since they varied from the packages ingredients required.  But it worked out perfectly!!  I used 2 packages of Shawnee Mills brownies (real sugar) and then a box of organic white cake mix.  I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and topped it with chocolate chips/butter "frosting"...can't remember the recipe title for that but it's listed several times in the reviews.

The cupcakes were delicious! I topped them with a homemade peanut butter frosting, and everyone loved them! The only thing I was a little disappointed with, was that my cupcakes did not look at all like the picture. It was more of a "layered" look- brownie at the bottom, cupcake on top. Not a big deal, but I plan on trying to fix this the next time I bake them.

These were so yummy! The brownie on the inside was a bit too gooey, but still delicious nonetheless. I love raspberry and chocolate, so I did add some raspberry syrup to the brownie batter and it produced the best teasing taste of chocolate-covered raspberries after baking, and was even more complimented with a fresh raspberry added on top of the icing.

tHESE WERE GOOD! But I just couldn't find the best way to make sure the brownie was just right--not too cooked and not falling apart goop.  I tried several different ways.  I piped the brownie batter into the cake mix which was wayyy too messy and caused the brownie to be cooked through.  I put layered which caused the same outcome as piping but was MUCH easier to do.  But by far the best was what the recipe actually calls for...brownie batter on bottom with cake above.  It was the closest to the consistency that I wanted.  But I do have to tell you all: don't even both with piping!! The batter is wayy too thin and it just creates a mess that ends with overcooked cupcakes!

Let me start off by saying that I am not a baker. My sister (who's the baker of this family) scolded me for buying boxed mixes.  It didn't matter in the end. They were a success at my toddler's party! A little on the sweet side but no one seemed to mind! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Absolutely the best cupcakes I've ever made and I love making cupcakes and brownies.  This is the best of both worlds!  Make sure to only cook for 20 minutes even though it might seem like it's not done, it is.  Love this recipe!!!!!!

Delicious. This worked for me: I put some cupcake batter on the bottom (so they would not stick) then only used about 1 tbs of the brownie batter, then the rest cupcake batter. This worked perfectly. When I experimented w/ the brownie batter and used more than a tablespoon they never baked - it was a gooey, unbaked mess. Also, be aware that you will run out of cupcake batter after about 24 cupcakes filling them 3/4 full. Very yummy! Everyone loved them!

These were fabulous! I didn't follow the exact directions. I put a layer of cake batter followed by brownie batter and another layer of cake batter. They baked perfectly and the brownie was gooey and delicious. Unfortunately, after making 24 cupcakes, I ended up with more brownie batter and no more cake batter... maybe something I will have to revise in the ingredients or the amount of brownie batter I added to each cupcake!

Very good cupcake! I only had Moist Yellow Cake Mix on hand and they turned out great! I used a 1/4 cup to fill the cupcake liners. I used Creamy Chocolate Frosting from this site.  Will make again!

They were great.  I made them for a baby shower and dyed the white part pink.  I used Duncan Hines Fudge Brownie mix and it turned out great.  I also used the fluffy peanut butter frosting and they were a huge hit!

3 stars because i loved this idea but they were a disaster.  first the cake part didn't bake right and was cracked on almost every cupcake.  also when trying to eat them the layers didn't stick together and it was a mess.  i think for this to work some cake batter should go on the bottom then fill with about 1 Tbs of brownie and then more cake mix on top.  i will try this again because it still sounds like a good idea...

I used veg oil instead if canola oil.  Thinking they would have turned out better if I made the batter as the boxes said to.  They were just ok.  I think plain brownies or plain cake would have been better.  I sprayed the liners with Pam and didn't have any problems with sticking.  I frosted half with chocolate frosting and the other half with Peanut Butter frosting from this site.  I preferred the chocolate frosting ones.  Will not make these again- darn, I had high hopes.

I made these and they were gone by the next morning-everyone loved them...I used an ice cream scoop for the brownie batter and then filled the cups the rest of the way with the cake mix, they just seemed too small only filling them 2/3 of the way, it still made 36 cupcakes this way. I also used brownie mix with peanut butter chips in them and then frosted them with peanut butter frosting...awesome

Totally disappointing!  Was expecting something special--not, very ordinary.  As others have said, brownie layers is not done when cake is--so overcook cake or undercook brownie?  I undercooked brownie thinking a runny center would be tasty.  Wrong.  Does not make 48 cupcake--not enough brownie batter and no I did not fill muffins cups more than 1/3 full w/brownie batter.  Had planned to top with chocolate ganache but do not think I want to waste it on these.  Sorry, this is my first review but I must be totally honest.  Admittedly, I do have very high standards for my desserts and this one falls way short.

I think this is the FIRST BEST cupcake ever!  I have tried your Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough cupcakes also...and they are wonderful, but my children and I LOVE these.  The first time I made them, I used yellow cake mix, but the white cake mix really tastes better with the brownie.  I used chocolate frosting and they were too yummy!  Somehow, I only end up with about 30 cupcakes and have cake mix left over.  Maybe if I fill them only 1/4 full with brownie mix I would get closer to 48?  Truly scrumptious!

I made this recipe exactly as stated, with the exception of increasing the baking time, and it turned out beautiful.  Everyone at work was asking for the recipe.  I highly recommend the fluffy peanut butter icing as well.  This recipe is a new favorite!

Cupcakes were pretty good, definitely not the best or second best. It was an interesting mix with the half-and-half of each mix. Overall, it was worth trying but doubtful if I will ever make again.

I just made these, and they are fantastic!  I followed the recipe, without modification, and they were perfect.  Center was slighty gooey as promised.   As far as the sticking issue, if you spray your liners with a nonstick cooking spray there shouldn't be any issues.  I cheated on the icing however.  I bought a tub of whipped cream icing and mixed in a little peanut butter.  Delish!!

Very good, very moist.  I read from others to layer a little cake batter at the bottom so they wouldn't stick, and it worked lovely.  However, with the cake batter, brownie batter, and then cake batter on top I filled them too full and they spilled over.  Next time I'll try to fill them no more than 3/4 full.

I've been wanting to make these ever since I first saw them but, with my sweet tooth, I needed to wait until I had an occasion to bake them or else I would risk eating them all! And I'm glad I waited...they are sooooo good! I could eat way too many of these beauties. I put a dab of cake batter on the bottom, filled with the brownie batter and then topped again with the cake batter. I need to experiment more because I ended up using too much brownie batter in them and had naked cupcakes left over with no brownie in the middle :) But that was my fault, not the recipe's fault. For those that tried these and said they came out dry, you really should give them another try. Every oven is different and my guess is these would be very easy to overbake and risk not getting that little bit of a gooey brownie center. Mine were done in 16 minutes. I frosted mine with Special Buttercream Frosting from this site...another winner. Thanks for this keeper, I'll definitely make them again!

These were SO GOOD. I did it with strawberry cake mix and they turned out amazing. A little powdered sugar on top is also really good or some frosting but just a little bit.

Very easy to make and hits the chocolate spot! The only problem I had with them was when I took my first batch out, the brownie center was still pretty raw. I ended up baking the remaining cupcakes for an extra 4 minutes, and they turned out perfectly! Frosted with a can of chocolate frosting, since I didn't have time to make homemade. I would definitely love to try these with different flavors of cake mix and peanut butter frosting!

OMG...yum! I floured some mini chocolate chips and added those to both batters, then topped off with a basic, chocolate buttercream icing. The teachers at my son's school stalked me for leftovers!

Delicious! What a unique way to make a cupcake! My husband and I can't get enough of this little pastry. This recipe halves nicely if you use a scale, which I was able to do. I filled the cups 1/2 full with white cake batter, then piped the brownie mix into the center of them. I baked them 22 minutes and they were perfectly done, just barely golden on the top. The brownie center was partly cooked but mostly gooey.  I also used the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting from this site like some other reviewers, but we found it a bit overwhelming. So the trick is to pipe just a little on, so the peanutbutter taste doesn't take over the cake itself. The brownie surprise in the middle is exactly that. Perfect little treat! Thank you!

Everyone loved these. Though I made them double chocolate (chocolate cake and brownies) because that is what I had on hand. Didn't even need frosting. Perfect!

Oh my GOSH! I just made these with my 2 year old on Saturday and they are awesome! I took another reviewer's advice and spooned a little cake batter into the muffin tin before putting the brownie batter in and then covered it with more cake batter. I haven't iced them (chocolate icing is too rich for these, vanilla is not enough, and I have a peanut allergy). Amazing! We will definitely make these again... perhaps for a Christmas gift.

Great idea! I made them with a from scratch yellow cake recipe (much better tasting with better ingredients than cake from a box). I did use an organic brownie mix though to same on some time. The first time I followed this recipe's ingredients for the brownie. It was very good but just tasted like chocolate cake. The second time, I followed the brownie recipe on the box and just added 2 eggs and 1/4 cup oil. I also piped the brownie into the yellow cake so that the brownie was in the center. The second method I used truly made the most wonderful cupcakes I have ever tasted. The brownie was soft and chewy/goey in the middle because the batter made this way is much thicker and stays in the center. Also when you make homemade cake the batter is thicker and helps the brownie to stay in the middle without running. I will make these again and again.

Great cupcake or brownie.. Excellent combo. I made as stated and didn't even bother frosting them. They were great as is. The brownie stuck a bit to cupcake liner but just pulled it away and ate them.. Thx for a great dessert.

I used highly rated recipes for both white cake batter and brownie batter. The brownie batter recipe also had a recipe for chocolate icing so I frosted the cupcakes with that. It was honestly the best decision I have ever made. The cupcakes were delicious.

You could use almost any cake mix with this and it would be fabulous!  I can't wait to try other flavors of cake and brownies!  I bet it would be fantastic with the mint brownies at Christmas.  Oh boy!  Thanks!

The end result turned out nice, but the baking was a bit of an issue. I found that the cake batter cooked a lot quicker than the brownie batter. I had to increase the baking time quite a bit, but found that the brownie portion was still a little undercooked. Thankfully, after sitting for awhile, they became a little less gooey. I'm not sure if I'd go through the trouble of making these again, but if I do, I'll definitely top them with peanut butter frosting again. The flavor combo was great!

The brownie part on the bottom of the cupcake sometimes separated from the cupcake. I might have been that I followed the recipe on the cake and brownie mix rather than the directions on the box. Still they were very good.

These were fairly easy to make.  I followed others advice and filled the cupcakes half full with cake mix then piped the brownie mix inside.  The brownie mix was really runny so the piping bag sort of dripped as I did it.  Covered with chocolate canned frosting but would like to try the peanut butter frosting.  I used yellow cake mix and brownie mix.  Substituted applesauce for the oil and used egg beaters.  Fun for the kids to make for sure!

This recipe is really good. I made 2batches, one using vanilla and the other strawberry. However, I didn't end up with48 cupcakes and didn't overfill my liners. The recipe calls for 18.75 oz cake mix box and cake mixes now come in 15.25 oz boxes.

I just made these cupcakes for my son's 8th birthday party.  They are a HIT!  The only change I made to the recipe is I used a French Vanilla cake mix.  My husband said this is the first cupcake he's ever had that was great worth or without icing.  It's a Keeper!

This recipe is so easy and delicious. I tried one without frosting while it was still warm from the oven and it was fantastic!! To solve the sticking to the bottom of the paper issue, I sprayed the papers with cooking spray that had flour in it. I made mine with yellow cake mix and all of the egg.

These cupcakes were so dang good! I will tell you I subbed unsweetened apple sauce for the canola oil (which I always do when baking). These were done in 18 minutes in my oven, so I recommend checking them after 16 minutes. I couldnt find cake mix that was 18.25, there were only 16.25 or 15.25 so I cant help but wonder if that was a typo because I used the same measurements and they came out perfectly. Makes 24 cupcakes, not 48.  Topped with chocolate icing from here. Couldnt stop munching on them! Would like to try them with some sort of peanut butter frosting next time, as suggested by another reviewer. Definitely a keeper!

Very taste! Didn’t make 48, but that was ok. Had a problem with the brownies sticking to the foil papers, will spray them next time to prevent this.

I made these with strawberry cake mix, instead of white cake mix. (To complement a cake I baked with brownie and strawberry cake for my son's birthday). I used a buttercream/cream cheese icing on top. Everyone loved them! Mine were done after 18 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

I liked the taste of these cupcakes, but, using 48 foil cupcake papers made them really small.  I am not much of a baker so I guess practice will help me.  Next time I will not use s many foil papers.  They were just regular size ones.  Seemed like I had more papers than cupcake.  Will make again and recommend.

They were good, they don't look like the one in the pic though they have a more layered look so that was a bummer.. made them with pb frosting, french vanilla cake mix and dark chocolate brownie mix.. yum!

These came out great. I took some of the suggestions and added a little vanilla to the cake mix. I chilled the brownie mix for 15-20 minutes. I also put a dollop of cake mix in first, then brownie mix and then cake. I cooked them for 25 minutes at 375 degrees. My son loved them. My husband is taking some to work. Will definitely make them again.

I love this cupcakes, even better than the cookie dough stuffed ones!  I did as others did and piped int he batter, but also chilled it for about 20 minutes and let the cake batter sit for that long too, so it thickened up a little...LOVE IT!

I made these last night using a French Vanilla for the cake mix......oh yummm  and then cause I thought Strawberries and Chocolate sounded good together, I tried a Strawberry muffin mix instead of the cake batter.  Oh my, both are to die for.  I iced with chocolate fudge frosting, oooh good. (wonder what Chocolate fudge cake mix would be like? Or Raspberry?)  This is a keeper. The possiblities are endless!  Thank you

I made these exactly as the recipe is written and took them to a church bake sale. After taste testing I decided to not frost them which worked out perfectly as it is summer and the frosting would have just melted into a mess. These cupcakes were a huge success!

These were phenomenal and didn't last long at all.  We frosted it with store bought milk chocolate icing and it was amazing.  I'm afraid to make them too often because they are delicious!

I agree with putting the brownie batter in a piping bag. It combines the two flavors wonderfully (better then the 2 seperate layers), I also used a cream cheese/ peanut butter icing and drizzled melted chocolate on top... It was the most amazing cupcake EVER... Big hit with my boyfriends air force buddies. :)

Totally disagree, these are WAY better than the cookie ones (those were a little bland in my opinion). Yum, yum, yum...i burnt the roof of my mouth eating them so fast...:) 
I used a duncan hines butter golden and the "best brownie" recipe on this site since I didn't have any brownie mix, but tweaked it a bit: upped the chocolate to 3/4 cup and the flour to 1 cup. worked like a dream.  
made 26 not 48. 
And drizzled them with melted chocolate for a little nicer presentation without an additional flavor. 
Yum...these are pretty and yummy and oh so cute. And they're good both hot and cold...

Okay, I made them again according to the directions and I like them better my way so I'm changing it to four stars. The white cake is a little bland-use yellow. And I found the real brownie recipe ends up meltier. 
But these are a definite keeper...oh so yummy! I made everyone I know eat one. :)

I thought these cupcakes tasted good and my kids loved them. However, I ended up having to cook them longer 10 min than what the recipe said due to the cake batter not cooking all the way after that amount of time. Should there be any changes due to high elevations (3,500ft or above)? The brownie batter took up most of the cupcake when I didn't even fill the cup 1/3 full. There also wasn't enough for 48 cupcakes, but that didn't really bother me, I still had 2 dozen.

These were awesome the first time I made them. I used the self standing foil cupcake holders. The brownie cooked well. The second time I made them I used paper cups in a stoneware pan. The brownie never cooked up right. I would definately make these again, but in foil cups and not in a stoneware pan.

Fairly simple to make. I used yellow cake mix because that's what I had. I lined my muffin pans and had no problems with sticking. I did, however, overcook them so they were somewhat dry. Kids and husband (and ok, me) still ate them all and daughter is requesting more, so I will try this again. Just make sure you keep a close eye on them!

These are pretty much the best cupcakes I've ever had! I made them last night and brought them to work, 20 cupcakes were gone by 9:30am! One lady stole one off of someone else's desk because she just had to have another! I used caramel frosting on them, it was the perfect match for the vanilla cake and brownie!

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time was done by this recipe, they tasted good, but the brownie and cake separated when eating it.  The second time I used a scratch recipe for the white cake and a box brownie mix (took the same amount of time and tasted better).  I also layered them white cake-brownie-white cake and they came out perfect.

These were okay, but certainly not "the best" or 2nd best for that matter.  20 minutes is overbaking in my book.  I yielded only 32 large cupcakes, baked at 20 minutes they were a bit dry. In other words 48 cupcakes at 20 minutes is too much.  Also, I made 1 batch with the brownie on bottom as stated, the other batch was layered as cake/brownie/cake.  I definatley think the brownie bottom works best for a chewier brownie consistency. I really didn't find these to taste much different than a marble cake recipe, which is less work in the long run.

This is a great recipe, even with yellow cake. My family always requests this for a dessert during football season and I even made 100 of them for my sister's wedding! Great with chocolate or vanilla frosting or can go completely unfrosted!

Love these - even more than the cookie batter ones.  I made the brownie batter lower in fat by using applesauce and the cake batter using my usual recipe of 3 eggs, 1 3/4 cups water, and 1 box vanilla pudding.  I made 24 cupcakes, and swirled the rest of the 2 batters in an 8X8 pan.  I used mysweetcreations Milky Way Icing to frost these, and they were delicious.  No one could tell that I did not use the oil called for in the recipe.  The cake was actually a little better than the cupcakes because it stayed so moist.  The icing is the perfect complement to these cupcakes.  Will definitely be making this one again.

I tried this and was really excited to see how they came out.  After  the cooking time I checked them and they appeared to be done, but when I removed them from the pan the brownie batter ran out and was still raw.  I put them back in the oven but even after an additional 10 minutes, they were still raw.  I think its a great idea,  but I'm wondering if there's a trick to getting the batters to cook uniformly.

These were yummy. I took them to cub scout camp. I used the fluffy peanut butter frosting recipe from this site. Mine did not make 48, it was more like 40... But the kids did not mind them being a bit taller. Thanks for this fun recipe!

Made these last week for the girls at work and they absolutely loved them! The icing is amazing and I didn't change a thing. The cupcake however was okay. Nothing great but went well with the icing. The browning part didn't really taste like a brownie but more like chocolate cake, maybe I didn't had enough brownie batter to the center, who knows but it's a recipe I would definitely make over and over again! Thanks for the recipe LOVESTOHOST!!!

Made as instructed and these are devine!  I had a lot of the brownie batter left over so I just popped those in the oven for regular brownies.  Frosted with the Fluffy PB Frosting from this site as well and they are great!!

I've made these a few times now and they are always a big hit! I like to make them with chocolate cake and brownie mix with chocolate frosting. Only thing I might say is becareful of the cooking time. Give the cupcakes the old  "fork-in-them" test after they have cooked for about 10 mins. Trust me, once you make these, you may never go back to regular cupcakes!

I made these for my niece to go along with her birthday week of cakes she asked for.  THey were a huge hit!  The brownie part was gooey and the cake was perfect.  It does help to put a bit of cake batter on the bottom and then the brownie so the wrapper peels off.  I preferred these the second day after being in the fridge all night.  I frosted some but liked them without best as they weren't too sweet.  The request was that I could make these again next week.  :)  Thanks LTH!

Very good! I didn't use a brownie mix so it ended up being like chocolate cake inside yellow cake instead of a brownie texture. Mine also "blew up" a bit...not sure why. Overall they were very easy to make and delicious; just a few issues.

20 minutes was too long in my gas oven.  As another reviewer mentioned, the brownie cooked along with the cake batter and they turned out a little dry.  They still taste great, though!

Delicious! A big hit at the office, and with my boyfriend, who is a sweet freak. I filled the muffin cups 1/3 of the way and piped in the brownie mix with a ziplock bag with the tip cut off, which turned out super messy. This method also made it hard to estimate how much brownie mix went into each cupcake. I think next time I make this, I will try spooning in some cake mix and then some brownie batter, with a dollop of cake mix on top, sounds much less messy.  Bonus with the cake batter being on the bottom is that it doesn't stick to the liner. 20 minutes may have been too long, as the brownie batter was super cooked, I would have liked it to be a little gooey, but that might be my oven. Overall, fantastic!

As of right now I have not tried the chocolate chip cookie cupcakes so in my book these are the best cupcakes ever! I followed suggestions of others and frosted with the fluffy peanut butter frosting from this site and WOW! These are amazing! I got great reviews from everyone in my house. Just two days and I only have crumbs left. I can't wait to make these again! Thank you for a perfect recipe!

these were pretty good. i used butter cake mix and had some cupcakes with caramel frosting and some milk chocolate. the caramel was the best, in my opinion. overall, the cupcake was really good but I think the brownie part was too overpowering. i think next time i will use more cupcake batter and possibly use a pastry bag to place the brownie in the center so there is less of it. i shouldnt really complain thought because they tasted delicious and i ate 3.5 of them in one sitting =P

I had to make some cupcakes for a friend's party and decided to try these along w/the cookie dough cupcakes. Both were amazing. I did cheat on the brownie cupcakes though. I used the premade toll house mini pull apart brownies. Cut the prep time in half and the outcome was still great. Both these and the cookie dough cupcakes got rave reviews at the party (more so than the very expensive bakery bought cake). Thanks LTH. So easy...so delicous...definitly handing out these recipes for sure.

Oh my! What a cupcake!!! Easy ingredients and scrumptious concept! Carmely tops sitting on moist, fudgy brownies were sensational! I followed the cake mix recipe, using 3 whole eggs; used a cookie scooper for cake and smaller scooper for brownie batter. Next batch, I will add more brownie batter to the cake batter before baking...making it again for sure!

These tasted great.  I did have the same problem as another reviewer with the brownie baking too much and made it too dense, but the second batch turned out much better, more gooey as I shortened baking time by a few minutes.  I frosted some with a cream cheese frosting, and others with the fluffy peanut butter frosting (absolutely delicious!) on this site.  Yummy; I will make again!

I actually think these are better than the cookie dough filled ones but maybe it is because I made my cake batter from scratch.  I think this recipe is great because it gives you infinite possibilities.  You could use chocolate cake with chocolate/peanut butter brownies and PB frosting or anything else you can imagine! I do recommend, as someone else mentioned, using the Ghirardelli brand brownies as they have a much more "home made" taste as opposed to other brands.  I did make a chocolate cake batter from scratch and that was the only change I made but these turned out so good!  I will be posting pictures soon!

Exactly what I was looking for for an "Oh !" themed party, lol!  I put part of the cupcake batter in first so that the brownie part would be more centered, and ended up with exactly what I wanted.  I had also refrigerated the brownie batter, but I don't know if that was necessary or not.  I topped with the fluffy pb frosting and it was a great combination!

The 1st time I made it using the mix cake but I didn’t like them, so I used the recipe of vanilla cupcake and added a cup of milk and used my own recipe of brownie. After that I did what a Melanie suggested , for the Brownie not to stick in to the liner. So a tbs of vanilla cupcake then a  tsp of brownie and on top again the tsp vanilla, they are great! I’m so happy. It was my third time to bake them

Excellent and quick! I love that by using both brownie and cake mixes, I end up with 24 cupcakes (12 rarely make it to day two in our family). I took another reviewer's advice and started by adding a little cake batter in the bottom of my muffin liners, then a healthy dollop of chilled brownie mix, topped off with more cake batter. Baking time was perfect. My guys couldn't wait until they cooled before diving in. I used yellow cake in my cupcakes and iced them with Vanilla Chai Buttercream Icing. YUMMM!

Who knew you could mix the two? Not me! I absolutely love this recipe! These were a huge hit at the BBQ that I brought these to. The cake portion is so light and fluffy and the brownie portion is nice and rich. It's a very good balance. I'll most definitely be making these again and again and again and again...

I followed direction to the letter and even took the extra step of freezing the brownie dough, actually stood at my oven to make sure I didn't over bake and the brownie dough wasn't even remotely gooey. I used a large glass measuring cup to put a little cake dough, then brownie dollop, then cake dough but still didn't work. Good cupcake just not what recipe claimed. I made chocolate frosting and frosted half of the cupcakes then added 2 T creamy peanut butter to the rest of the frosting for a chocolate peanut butter frosting, both were divine. I won't be making these again, too much work for mediocre results.

These cupcakes are just wonderful! I made mine with yellow cake mix and that is because  thats what I had the first time and it goes perfect with the brownie mix on the bottom. I think either or any kind will work as long as you follow the directions on this website and not the box . Thank you for sharing this recipe and I plan on making another batch this week. YUM!!

I love this idea. It is a great idea for a dessert. They are baking right now, but i have no idea how long to bake them for! On the side it says prep 10 minutes and bake 40 minutes, but in the directions it says about 20 minutes. I wish i knew how long to cook them for! They look delicious so far though. :)

If you use a yellow cake mix, you need to put MORE OIL than the recipe here states.  I made this with a white cake mix and it was terrific, the kids loved it.  Just now I made this with a yellow mix and the cake tasted ordinary and a little dry.  
I lowered the temp a little bit both times I made this when I saw the outer ring of the cupcake was rising faster than the middle.  Started checking about 20 minutes into it and usually a few minutes afterwards it's done.  I used cupcake liners and didn't have a problem.

Okay - I tried making this one twice without success ... serious sad face ....  So - the Best cupcake for our home is the cookie dough cup cake!  (I tried that one at the same time and it worked perfectly!!!)  The brownie cupcake didn't cook properly on the first try.  (Raw brownie - like not just a bit undercooked but out of the mixing bowl raw...)  The second time I tried to make the cupcake - the brownie layer and cake layer split apart!!

Love the concept. I didn't get the ratio of brownie to cake just right on all of the cupcakes. Therefore some of the cupcakes were glorious, while some were just really great.

Made these tonight and they were AMAZING! I don't like cake and I was making these for a friend but I had to try them simply because I love brownies. I took the advice from a couple of the reviews and used a piping bag for the brownies and I also used strawberry cake mix and vanilla frosting. What a yummy combination. We will be making them again. I only gave them 4 stars because the centers didn't cook all the way but that may have been my error of adding too much brownie batter. Next time I will add a little less and hope they come out better. We will be making these again soon.

I have made this recipe several times. Always turns out great. Always a hit. The only thing I do different is two eggs instead of 3 egg whites in the cake mix because it's easier. Gonna try the cookie dough ones soon, but I don't know if it gets any better than these.

I made these twice (to give them a fair chance) and just do not see the hype.  They were a lot of trouble to make and then the result is just a cupcake with a different color center.  There was little, if any, taste variation between the cupcake and the brownie.  Plus since you are using two mixes, do the math...it makes way more than you would ever want to eat.  I didn't even want to give them away since they were so blah tasting.  I guess I had high expectations based on other's reviews.  We won't be making these again.

Not quite.
These cupcakes were easy enough to make but not really that good. I made these for a baby shower and the only really saving grace was the frosting I used (coffee cinnamon). The cupcake itself is pretty typical cake from a box, and the brownie mix really wasn't the ooey gooey center I was hoping for. Probably won't make these again.

I actually loved this, I gave it 4 stars because this recipe does not make 48, it makes 24 and I had to stop in the middle to pick up another box of brownie and cake mix. They are soooo delicious!

They tasted fine, but nothing special.  I piped in the brownie batter after filling 1/3 full with cake mix and it worked great.  The kids enjoyed the novelty of it, but they weren't particularly excited about the taste either.

perhaps I am doing something wrong. I ended up with cupcakes that were brownie on the bottom and white cake on the top. Made them twice and neither time did I get anywhere close to 48, or a cupcake with a gooey center. The picture shows brownie surrounded by white cake-my brownie all stayed on the bottom.Followed directions exactly-1/3 full of brownie,1/3 full of cake. They tasted good, but tended to seperate at the "line". What am I doing wrong? Baked about 17 minutes. In looking closely at the pic it looks like the brownie was piped into the center as suggested by another user. That is what the directions should have said if that is what was needed to get those results. Tasted good, just didn't get the "gooey surprise" in the center like I expected. Any hints?

On a whim, made these inside an ice cream waffle bowl, added about 10min baking time.  They came out great!  The fluffy peanut butter frosting is so yum. I plan to serve them with chocolate peanut butter ice cream.  Thanks so much for posting this fun recipe, I adore it!  :)

used yellow cake an baked ala cookie dough cupcake. put mix in fridge while mixing cake and dumped a spoonful in with cake mix. baked 18 minutes and frosted with milk chocolate frosting (store bought). good, but not as good as cookie dough cupcakes. made with chocolate cake. way better! Actually really good w yellow if freeze brownie mix while mixing cake. Use small scoop for cake, small scoop of brownie, small scoop of cake. Makes 18. Lots of brownie mix left over.

These were a yummy sweet treat, the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because i made my first batch placing the cake mix first and piping in the brownie mix to the center the presentation was awesome but center was not fully cooked. Made the second batch with the browning mix on the bottom cake mix on top that way they cooked all the way through, they looked nice also. I used butter creme frosting to ice it tasted great together

Awesome flavors and presentation! It does take some playing with however. I really didn't want mine to have the black bottom look so I spooned in some cake mix and then a scoop of brownie mix and then cake mix again. This method used less brownie mix than following the recipe so I ended up with extra brownie mix that I baked off. The brownie center still ran into the sides so I think next time I will spoon in cake mix and pipe in brownie! Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent....been dying to try these...made for a dinner party and they were a hit....As I was assembling these cupcakes....I decided to put a little bit of cake batter on the bottom of the liners first, add the brownie batter and then more cake batter....that way after they baked up, you could not tell what was in the middle...the brownie was totally surrounded by the cake! I did try one as instructed and you could see the brownie on the bottom....I used the Milky Way frosting from this site on top of these lucious cupcakes! So very good....thanks LTH!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with cupcakes that had raw bownie mix in the center. I think the problem was that I baked 2 cupcake pans at the same time, I ended up putting the other one back in the oven for 5 minutes more, the brownie seemed to cook fine, 4 stars because when cooked right they taste amazing. I would suggest maybe only cook one cupcake pan at a time. Thank you for sharing, I will try and make again

Cupcake Perfection! I made this using the Simple white cake recipe from this site (which made 14 cupcakes) and Brooke's Bombshell Brownies from this site, which filled the 14 cupcakes plus had enough left over to make one more all brownie cupcake. Frosted with peanut butter frosting as suggested, again Perfection!

The combination of brownie and cake was almost too much for my cake addicted brain!  I made half with the fluffy peanut butter frosting and the other half with the simple buttercream frosting - both were amazing!  I filled the brownie centre by using piping bag.  Note - this recipe makes a mess!

Well it doesnt need my 5 star or my review, but I like to review everything I make since discovering this place and since I decided to cook and actual follow the recipe.  Okay so anyways, the grandkids loved it and they had a blast helping me make them.  They had a 4 hour drive to get here, so it was something nice we got to do together and make some good memories together.  Thank you for sharing.

FREAKING AWESOME. I used the MMM...Brownies recipe on this site, as well as a white cake recipe from the Better Homes & Gardens cookbook, instead of using mixes. SO worth it!

This was the first batch of cupcakes I have ever made.  I usually don't like cake, but these were delicious (even without the frosting).  I followed the instructions on the back of the brownie & cake mix boxes, instead of using the exact amounts listed.  I also put a spoonful of cake batter in the bottom before putting the brownie mix.  It really was delicious, I brought them to a friends house and everyone said they were really good.

I made these for my daughter's birthday and they were a huge hit.  I used a French Vanilla cake mix and put 1/3 of the cake batter in the cupcake liners first, then a generous spoonful of the brownie batter in the middle, then the rest of the cake batter.  I frosted them with chocolate buttercream, then a piped star of vanilla buttercream in the middle.  They were wonderful - thanks!

Wow... this was so far the best cupcake I've ever had.... and everyone who ate them agreed! I make cupcakes all the time for events so I had to try this recipe when I saw it. I've never seen anything like it.... brought them to a party and they were gone before I knew it! The recipe was right on except that for me it made less than it said... about 32 cupcakes.  I used a white icing which was delicious. THANK YOU for inventing this!!! I don't think I'll ever make regular cupcakes again.

They were good but not something I would make again.  I had to bake them longer than the recommended time as they were not baked completely in the middle.

I followed other reviewers' advice, and alternated the white cake with the brownie batter, to avoid the brownie sticking to the bottom of the liner. It took a loooong time! It yielded 31 cupcakes for me. But I did have leftover brownie batter in the end, which I couldn't bake in the oven because this recipe combines different ingredients with the mixture than the box calls for. I topped half of my cupcakes with a store bought chocolate frosting, and the other half with the "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting" from this site. Both tasted yummy! The cupcakes were a big hit, but I would not make them again. The brownie flavor was not strong enough to make the process worth it. I LOVED the cookie dough + cupcake recipe from lovestohost though, and will make that one again!! Thanks for the unique ideas!

Wow.  These were good!  I made them for a friend and "taste tested" one to make sure it was ok before giving it to them to eat.  I don't even really like chocolate or peanut butter, but the combination was amazing!

Absolutely amazing recipe! I made a few tweaks, but the basics were really great. Instead of the white cake mix, I decided to make a strawberry cake mix and add a bit of strawberry puree to it. To top it off, I used a strawberry frosting consisting of butter, powdered sugar, strawberry puree, and vanilla. The cupcake came out amazing. The brownie and strawberry combination was a hit. You might have a bit of the brownie mixture left over.

Excellent recipe! I used the Coconut Cream Cheese frosting recipe from this site. I put the cake batter in the baking cups first, and then piped in the brownie filling as many others did. This worked well. (As an experiment I used a teaspoon to drop brownie filling into two of the cupcakes, and this also worked just as well.) This a fabulous recipe that I can't wait to share with my co-workers tomorrow.

These were pretty good.  Not close to the "best ever," but fun for something a little different.  I tried baking these two ways...one with layers of cake, brownie, cake and the other just brownie then cake, as written.  Placing the brownie layer on the bottom worked better...otherwise, it takes a long time for the brownie to cook.  Longer than is needed to bake the cake.  The fluffy PB frosting makes this, though.

These were just okay for me.  The brownie cooked too much & so it seemed more like really dense marble cake.  Topped w/ choc frosting so we still ate them up, but probably won't try these again.

Delicious!!! My family couldn't stop eating these.  I used a yellow cake mix, frosted some with chocolate and white icing left some plain.  This recipe will get plenty of use at my house.

I must have made JUMBO size, b/c I got 24 just right cupcakes (not 48)!  Used Ghiradelli Double Chocolate Brownies (chocolate chips in the mix!) and everyone *Loved* them!  Also made LTH's cookie dough cupcakes along side these-depended on the person which one they loved best! Either way, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I ended up using chocolate cupcake mix with vanilla frosting, they went very well together.  I also sprayed the cupcake trays rather than using paper since some reviewers claimed they stuck. they were a BIG hit!

Make these NOW!  I made these for a treat and they were amazing.  Use the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting receipe.  These are too good.  Had not problems as others did with sticking.   Love love love!
