The recipe was good, but next time I will chop up an onion and some garlic to add to it.

This recipe has all the things I like .....easy, healthy, inexpensive, can be served more than one day, and is delicious!  I made two minor changes: I increased the water to 3/4 cup and used regular cabbage instead of savoy.  I will make this recipe often!

This was really good, my picky eater (age 7) ate the whole thing without complaining.  I followed the recipe but I did add more water (maybe a Cup),some onion powder and 2 garlic cloves.  After the beef was ready, I placed everything in a slow cooker on low for 4 hours, because I wasn't going to have time to make the soup later.  Turned out fabulous.

Just made this.  My husband did not like the amount of carrots in the soup - I would have to agree - use less.  Otherwise it was good.  Especially loved the squash (I had some left over that was not used in another recipe) - it really added a good flavor.  All  in all, an excellent soup - don't think there will be a lot of liquid to this soup.

This soup was so good that my kids asked for seconds and possibly thirds of it.  The only thing I used different was ground turkey rather than ground beef.  My family thought it was great and they asked that I make it again, I also made if for church potluck and came home with an empty pot!

This was really quite tasty.  The store did not have savoy cabbage, so I had to use bok choy.  I also did not put the full amount of carrots in.  I did have to increase the water as my veggies started to stick to the bottom of the pot.  I also did not have flavored salt or garlic salt, but adding pepper at the end was fine.  It is very hearty.  My favorite part was the squash and while I did not measure it, I used a whole buttercup squash, so I'm sure there was more than 3 c.  Definitly make again.

LOVE LOVE this soup!! 
I made it my own by adding a quart and a half of vegetable stock, 1/4 tsp of hot pepper flakes and 3 cloves of minced garlic.  Made batch of cheddar cheese biscuits to accompany...Great cold night dinner.  Thank you for sharing!!

Recipe was ok.  I needed to add about 3 1/2 cups water and beef bullion to make it a soup.  I used the whole packet of taco seasoning and one onion to give it more flavor.

My kids (9 and 6) usually don't like stew like dishes but they did eat some of this. I had more than 3 cups of butternut squash, so I added water that was flavored with tomato paste.

I used ground chicken, which I browned with onion and garlic. 

I used a homemade taco seasoning that I got from allrecipes, and that allows me to control the level of heat and spice I put in. I keep it very mild for the kids.

My husband and I then added a few dashes of hot sauce to our plates.

I served it with crusty Whole Wheat bread.

Loved this "stew". Didn't have cabbage so I used frozen peas. Made the ground beef like I do tacos (by mixing the taco seasoning with water), which added 1/4th cup to the water. 
House smelled wonderful for the hour it "stewed". Loved loved loved it!
Next time I will add more squash. It was my favorite ingredient. :-)

This soup was a five star for my husband and I.  He doesn't like cooked carrots very much, so next time I will use the smallest carrots available or chop them.  The taco seasoning was great!

It was really good... I followed the others suggestions of adding onions and more garlic... I also added a can Rotel tomatoes and 1 can of regular diced tomatoes.  I added some Allspice about 1/2 tsp....  I wanted to add some apples but had none.  Really good!!! As always better the next day!  
Oh.. being a southerner... I added a few TBSP of bacon grease.... :-)

I made this recipe...it was just okay. I loved the smell, as it was cooking, and was excited to eat it. The soup, overall, was flavorful, but the butternut squash was tasteless. I'm not sure why it didn't absorb the flavor of the seasoning. Also, next time, rather than slice a cabbage, I may buy packaged slaw. I used green cabbage as I didn't have Savoy cabbage and didn't find it at our local grocery. It was too firm, and didn't cook as nicely as I had hoped. Maybe fresh spinach would be a good alternative. We had the soup left over. After I removed the cabbage and seasoned it further; it was good.

didn't know what savoy cabbage was so used other kind.  It should be chopped and not just sliced.  I have arthritis in hands so would recommend roasting the squash first which makes it easier to cut up and put into soup.  I definitely included the additional ingredients for flavor.  It was a very tasty way to get your veges!!

Very good quick soup- the taco seasoning gives more flavor considering the short cook time.
