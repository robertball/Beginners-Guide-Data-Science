Hey Jeffrey Scott! We thought this was worth your taking the time to write out the ingredients! I used a package of Costco's organic ground beef (1 lb 3 oz) red bell rather than green and only half the recipe. I did use 1/4 cup of oats and 1/4 cup of Progresso Italian bread crumbs. That particular meat tends to be a little dry in my opinion and so the mix of oats and crumbs made it just a tad dry. I did think it could have used a little more seasoning but next time I'll take care of that by using a little more salt and maybe Italian seasoning mix--or maybe make a little more of the topping and put that inside the loaf mix. I could have used a little more Tabasco in the topping but that's a personal issue. This will make a very good sandwich tomorrow for lunch so we thank you for our dinner and our future lunch!
