The flavors go together really well.  The only reason I knocked off a star is because I think the temperature needs to be upped to 375 F.  After an hour at 350, my chicken was still pink and the sweet potatoes were raw.  I'm not sure why I didn't raise the temperature.  I normally bake chicken breasts at 375 and sweet potatoes at 400.  Nothing seems to happen at 350.  Maybe it's my oven.

This is a very good and satisfying recipe.  After reading reviews, I sauteed small chopped sweet potato, celery and apple in 1T olive oil. Then added spices when the vegetables/fruit were getting soft.  Placed in baking dish. After that, browned 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and then put on top.  Added about 1 cup of chicken broth and cooked at 365 degrees for 45 minutes and it was done.  You definitely need the broth.

I used four bone-in chicken thighs, splash of apple juice, dried cranberries and a shallot instead of the onion. Everything else in the recipe was kept as is.  Sometimes you just have to work with what's in the pantry and freezer.  Turned out fantastic!  Next time I will cook it in the crockpot and make some stuffing for a side dish.

Very very good. I didn't have an apple so I went with out it. I was worried that the veggies or chicken would be dry but both were excellent.  I will make this again for sure. Oh and my son loved it.

I made this in the slow cooker with boneless chicken breasts. Overall, it was pretty good, but I found the ginger overpowered the other spices. I might use pumpkin pie spice next time.

I found that this was turning out very dry so I added a bit of chicken stock and plopped the whole thing into the pressure cooker. After some time in there, the sweet potatoes and apples came out so wonderfully soft! I will be trying this again!

DH & I agree that we did not care for this recipe. Chicken was tender but had no flavor. I cooked it in my slow cooker on low for 7 hrs., using boneless-skinless chicken breasts. Won't be making this again.

Well this was a fine dinner.  I am a huge sweet potato fan and enjoyed the flavor with the chicken.  I did saute the potatoes with some celery in olive oil for a bit before adding to the dish.  Remember to pound the chicken pretty flat so it will cook faster.  Mine took 45 minutes on 375.  I added a can of chicken broth so things didn't get too dry.  But the chicken really lacked flavor for me.  Needs more seasoning.

This was very good, I doubled the recipe and baked it for about 1.25 hours at 350.  Was not dry at all and I would make it again.

Listening to reviews I sautéed the seasoned sweet potatoes, onion and apple in olive oil, removed to crockpot. Then I added the salt and peppered chicken breasts to the sauté pan and browned them before also placing them into the crockpot. I poured 1 cup chicken broth over everything and it came out perfect.  Very moist chicken!  A great fall recipe.

So disappointed.  It looked good on paper, but 1 1/2 hours later, the potatoes were crunchy!  The chicken was dry...it was terrible.  I am learning to cook and thought this recipe would be a treat for my boyfriend. So sad...DO NOT FOLLOW THIS RECIPE!  Wish I had read the other reviews....

Didn't have an apple, but the sweet potatos were delicious.  Subbed 1/2t allspice for nutmeg.  Used seasoned salt and pepper on chicken.   Baked covered for 30 minutes, then poured some melted butter and honey over the chicken and baked uncovered for 40 minutes, letting the skin crisp.  Really great.

This recipe wasn't that good....the flavors didn't seem to go together that well. I used some broth as some suggested maybe that is why....either way my husband and I were both disappointed.

I used 2 chicken quarters and took a few suggestions like adding chicken broth and sautéing the potatoes and apples. I covered and cooked for 45min at 350 and it was no where near done. I removed the cover and upped the temp to 400 and it still wasn't done for another 30-40 min. Very disappointing!

I liked the flavors, but wanted something a little more savory so I made some changes...  
I didn't have an apple, so I used a pear.  Also, I added a little bit of curry powder to add a different flavor.  The potatoes were still a little underdone, so next time I will up the temp.  Also, though the chicken was moist, the inside was very bland.  I think I will add some apple juice and the seasonings and marinade the chicken for a little bit before I bake it.  I will definitely make it again!

Great flavor, but the chicken turned out very dry. It also took quite a bit longer to cook than was stated. 45 mins. after baking and the potatoes and apples were still hard.

I was disappointed with the recipe.  The spice combination was really good, and gave the chicken a nice flavor.  But I have to agree with some of the other reviews- the whole dish was extremely dry after cooking.  I baked it for 45 minutes, and the sweet potatoes were not cooked, at all.  Of course that might be a problem with my oven, but I still don't think I would try this one again.

I really liked this recipe. I left out apples and used celery so it was not too sweet. And I used the spices and seasonings on chicken rubbing it all over. I also rubbed olive oil on chicken so it stayed moist.

Sorry but I just don't agree with the reviews on this one.  I only used 3/4 tsp of the ginger and it was SO overpowering on the apples.  I used boneless skinless chx breasts and I adjusted cooking time for that difference but the chicken was so bland since it's just placed on top of the veggies and there's no seasoning or sauce for it.  My family took 2 bites and we opted to have something else.

I followed the recipe and the whole dish was too dry the chicken wasn't cooked enough.  I ended up adding chicken stock and cooking it a little longer to moisten the entire dish and cook the chicken all the way.  It was a nice seasonal dish but I probably won't make it again anytime soon.

This recipe has become a family favorite. However it took some trial  and error to perfect. 1. The sweet potatoes must be small cubes. 2. I bake the sweet potatoes, apple onion and CELERY,  about twice as long as the recipe states and 3. I bake the chicken separately only combining after I have diced the cooked chicken for the last 15 minutes of total time. The flavor is amazing .

It came out so disgusting, a really strange blend of flavors. I honestly could not eat it - and I'm not a fussy eater! I sauteed the onions before I put them in and baked it in my cast iron dutch oven. I seasoned the chicken before putting it in with the rest of the veggies because other reviews said that chicken was too plain. Looks like it's cereal tonight!

I modified it a lot, thus didn't have any of the other downsides. It was delicious, flavorful all the way through, and deserving of 5 stars.

**Thighs instead of breasts (too dry to cook this way) seared/low-cooked skin-side down in an electric skillet until half done, remove and toss (in a large bowl) with Adobo with cumin, and a generous amount of curry powder and garam masala.

**Cut the sweet potatoes and apples rather small and thin, sautee/simmer the onions in the chicken liquid and fat, then add apples and sweet potatoes for a bit.

**Pull back and put the thighs on the bottom, then pile the veggies/apples on top, adding a little water or apple juice/cider if needed, put on the lid and turn it down. Cooks quickly. 

**Serve over REAL rice (like basmati) for best flavor.

Delicious!  I basically made a half recipe, but used full amount of spices except I omitted the ginger.  I cut up a boneless breast and mixed it through.  I also drizzled honey over all of it and added some salt free chicken stock. 
Baked it covered at 350 for 1 1/2 hours.  
Easy to prepare and will likely make it again

Too much fat from the chicken.  Won't make again.

I followed directions exactly...but I am disappointed...truthfully, it is awful. It needed extra time to cook. It looked like a good idea, but I'll never make it again.

Wish I read reviews first. I didn't have an apple so used applesauce. I too thought time & temp was not sufficient. Took much longer and turned up to 375. The sweet potatoes were ok but the chicken was dry and totally tasteless.

OK,I used this recipe as the basis of our meal...

Based on the comments I was worried about the chicken being dry and the dish not having much flavour, so I cut the chicken into smaller pieces and massaged the seasoning into it at the same time as I was mixing the vegetables.  I used peppers, mushrooms, celery and tomatoes in addition to the sweet potato and apple.

I also added crushed chilli and used seasoning salts rather than normal salt.  I also put in dried mixed herbs.

Initially I covered it to cook for 45mins.  Then I uncovered it and added a splash of boiling water, and left it uncovered to cook for another 25mins.  I turned up the heat a little too.

Now we are looking forward to eating it :)!

Tried this recipe last night.  It was very easy and I always like not having to deal much with the raw chicken. It was definitely a seasonal dish, flavors better for Fall but it was still good and made the house smell wonderful!  Wish I had checked the reviews beforehand though because it was lacking something to marry it together.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and they were cooked through, not dry, but very boring. I spread butter to the tops and let it melt and then salted and peppered them again. The spice mixture in the dish is not enough to bring it all together so there needs to be a liquid added to keep everything moist and be the cohesive element. This could be chicken broth or apple juice as other reviewers have tried.  This recipe could go either sweet or savory.  I will try it again but with some experimenting, perhaps brown sugar or maple syrup and coconut oil added to the mix.

I really did not enjoy this recipe.  The chicken came out very dry and the cinnamon flavor was overwhelming.  I will not be making this one again.

Bitter from too much seasoning. Perhaps 1/2 tsp each would have made it edible, but I would not eat it as is. It was also dry.

After reading reviews here, I cooked the chicken separately in another pan (I used three legs) and added 1c apple juice to the other mixture. I cooked the chicken on 400 for 10 min, then reduced to 380 for the rest (35 min-ish). I added dried cranberries.
My two sons and husband LOVED it. Nice, quick, and easy,

I made this last night for dinner it turned out pretty good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the chicken was a bit dry. I did take the advice of the reviewers and raised the temp to 375 and if not the potatoes would not have been cooked. I will make this again because my girls loved it!!
