I've made this for years for all occasions when I need cookie platters. This year I used milk chocolate chips because I was out of semi-sweet. Yum!

I cut out the nuts and add more kinds of chocolate (aka mlk semi sweet dark) and I always double the recipe.

Instead of nuts I sprinkled toffee bits on top. Delish!

This is very similar to Saltine Toffee Cookies except the others call for more butter and more (brown) sugar and some boiling first. That recipe is better because it sets up better. These taste good tho and certainly meet the sweet tooth requirement with very few pantry ingredients.
