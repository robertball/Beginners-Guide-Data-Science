This was a big hit at home.  I added a little bit of Cumin and Garam Masala to give it a little more flavor.

We loved this! I had to make a few changes due to what I had on-hand; used brown rice instead of farro, chinese cabbage instead of celery, and red wine vinegar instead of lemon, (and added cumin and garlic powder). This is a versatile and forgiving recipe. Thanks vburrito!

Made this with a couple of changes, based on what I had on hand....used broccoli and chopped up the broccoli stems and leeks.....used a salt/pepper/garlic powder seasoning......so tasty! We will definitely make it again!

My family loved this!  It's one I can easily make for everyone, meat-eaters, vegetarians, and vegans, all of which we have in our small family. It needs a bit more spice for us so next time I'll at least add vegetarian or vegan bouillon cubes to the water when I cook the farro.

Okay. Lacking spices and herbs.
