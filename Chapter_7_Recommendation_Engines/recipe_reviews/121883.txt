This is a great, simple brown sugar cookie. BUT, for a chewier cookie, I melt the butter instead of creaming. (This rule goes for all cookies that you want chewiness from - molasses, chocolate chip,etc). The original recipe is good, but I agree adding butterscotch chips to it turns it into a bakery quality cookie.  I make mine large, bakery size (walnut size dough balls) and bake for about 13 min.  I just make half the recipe too - 2 eggs, 2 1/2 cups flour, 3/4 cup melted butter)  This is a great alternative for chocolate chip cookies and perfect for those who can't eat chocolate but can still get that sweet fix.

Great recipe!  I'm not a huge fan of butterscotch cookies, but my husband is and he just loved them (as if the look on his face wasn't evidence enough).  I cut the recipe in half and used one whole egg and one egg yolk.  I also added a whole bag of butterscotch chips which put them over the top.  I rolled them into walnut sized balls and flattened them slightly.  Them came out perfectly round and slightly cracked - great looking cookie.

This does make a LOT of cookie dough! I added a bag of butterscotch chips, and about a cup of chopped pecans as others have suggested. When I saw how much dough the recipe makes, I thought I would be there forever making individual cookies, so put everything into a greased jelly roll pan, reduced the oven temp by 25 degrees and increased baking time. Checked with a wooden toothpick for doneness. Very chewy and good!!!

great cookies. I just finished getting the last batch out of the oven. I tried one after it had cooled...ended up having a couple more before I was done baking them all. I was looking to give cookies to neighbors, so the size worked. I also added butterscotch chips, which made them great. I even got mine to be fluffy. Crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. 12 minutes worked great for my oven on the second from the top rack. I will definitely make them again.

In reviewing this recipe I didn't see much in the way of butterscotch going on here, so rather than struggle to make this cookie live up to its name I just worked with what I believed to be a nice cookie dough more interesting. (Butterscotch flavor, in my mind, might have meant one of more of the following ingredients: browned butter, scotch, dark brown sugar, or even butterscotch extract) I reduced this to a one egg recipe by scaling it down to 40 servings.  I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of salt, then stirred in one cup of cinnamon chips. Cookies that have cream of tartar in the ingredients list always catch my attention because I like the cookie it produces and this one did not disappointment. It is a wonderful cookie - sort of crunchy on the outside and sort of soft on the inside - and definitely cinnamon-y with good buttery flavor. While I added cinnamon and cinnamon chips, I think other flavorings (like maple extract) or chips (chocolate,of course!) would be fine additions too. Plain or with additions, this is a good, old-fashioned cookie jar cookie.

This does make a huge batch.  I took half of the batch and baked per directions, and the other half I added a bag of butterscotch chips.  My father loves butterscotch and he loved these cookies!

Absolutely delicious! They turned out perfect and beautiful. I had lost my favorite old time butterscotch cookie recipe and was looking for a replacement. This worked great and the cookies are just what I wanted. I did decrease the flour a little.
I made a third of a batch just to try it out and for that amount I used 1 1/3 Cups flour which would work out to 4 Cups if your making the big-batch. They were perfect!

I ignored my gut and didn't add any salt to this recipe and I really should have. I know it would have enhanced the flavor and brought out more sweetness. I even melted and browned the butter to enrich the flavor but  the cookies still tasted flat with no hint of butterscotch flavor. They're not terrible but they're not very good either.

Nice, picture perfect cookies that look like they come from the bakery!  I followed the recipe, but added a bag of butterscotch chips as many reviewers have.  I can't put my finger on it, but something seems like its missing from these ... There's nothing majorly wrong, but I think a minor change may make them a 5-star recipe.  I may try to add a little bit of salt next time to cut the sweetness just a touch.  I used a cookie scoop to make these and the recipe yielded 66 cookies.

AmAzInG! I made half the batch and added butterscotch chip as suggested by other reviewers. I baked them just less than 10min to keep them chewy. A very nice change from chocolate chip but just as easy and simple.  I will be making them again - Next time I will try Reese's Pieces or peanut butter chips. Yum!

I added a bag of chocolate chips, a half bag of white chocolate chips (that is all that were in the bag at the time) and some chopped walnuts.  My husband took them to work for the garage and they were gone in 20 minutes.  A real hit and they are asking for more.

i cut the recipe down to a third (1 egg, 1 stick of butter, etc). didn't realize till i'd already started mixing the ingredients that we were out of cream of tartar. in the hunt for that, i wasn't paying attention to my flour measurements. so i ended up with somewhere more than 1 3/4 cups of flour + the baking soda and powder. i realized this before i added it to the wet ingredients, and so i measured out of the combined dry ingredients around 1 3/4 cups. i then added 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips. baked for 12 minutes, and let sit on the cookie sheet for about 5 minutes. even with the dubious measurements of all the dry ingredients, and no cream of tartar, they were still pretty tasty! i'll most likely try again, with proper measurements. the butterscotch chips are a permanent addition, but i might try adding nuts next time

We made these cookies with our 2 year old son.  The recipe is good.  Gave it four stars only because it was missing the best part!  LOL Butterscotch chips!  We used one bag but could have used at least two bags.  Yum!  Cooked them for about 12 minutes!

These are fantastic!  I used the ideas from many of the comments and used partially melted butter, added butterscotch chips and salt.  I made large cookies from walnut-sized balls of dough, slightly pressed flat, baking them at 325.  I made a full sized batch, and next time I will double the amount of butterscotch chips because one bag for a full batch is not quite enough.  This is a large batch, but when making large cookies the batch goes pretty fast.

I'm not really sure the cookies I made had a true butterscotch flavor, but they were still very good.  After reading a few reviews, I decided to brown the butter and add some much needed salt to the dry ingredients.  I made very large cookies to which I pressed a pecan half in the center while cooling.  The cookies had a nice chew to them and a hint of nuttiness from the browned butter... kind of like an old-timey cookie jar staple.

I have been known to make perfect cookies, but this didnt cut it. Good flavor, way to fluffy. I like a chewy cookie, and i even melted the butter which makes them chewier but still it was like a biscut. Nex time i will cut down the baking soda and powder. I also used 2  cups sugar not 3 and added butterscotch and chocolate chips.

Add 10 oz of butterscotch mini-morsels and 1 c chopped pecans.  Smack the pan on the counter upon removing from the oven to slightly flatten the cookie and firm it up.

This cookie recipe is perfect! I made half of the recipe, used a smallish (maybe the size of 2 tablespoons) cookie scoop and it made 37 big cookies.  I used Country Crock Calcium margarine and 1 bag of butterscotch chips- YUM!  I found the dough was a bit runny but it cooked just perfectly.  Our tummies thank you for a delicious cookie recipe!!

They really didn't wow me. I sprinkled with raw sugar. If you want to try the recipe, go for it... just have some extra add-ins on hand in case you agree that they are kind of...boring. Others have suggested pecans or butterscotch chips... both of which may help. I didn't happen to have any, and didn't want to use chocolate or PB chips. We'll see what my coworkers think tomorrow. Maybe I was just expecting more? **FYI: i halved the recipe, using two whole eggs, and they turned out right, as far as consistency/texture/etc.

Gorgeous, great-tasting cookie!  Nice texture, too!  I added 3/4 of a bag of Butterscotch chips as suggested by previous posters.  I prefer Oatmeal Scotchies, but there is NOTHING wrong w/ this cookie.  It's a great recipe.

Very good recipe. I halved it as well, since I was only making them for a few people. I added in a half bag of Butterscotch chips, as well as some crushed Wether's Original candies I had on hand. The cookies were not quite as chewy as I usually like, but that very well might be my oven, which is "touchy" to put it nicely. 

At any rate, the cookies were quite good. I'd give them a 4/5.

This recipe is decent, although huge. I divided it in half (using 2 eggs, not 1 1/2!)  If you're a big fan of butterscotch, these cookies are wonderful.  I added a small bag of Nestle Butterscotch chips to this recipe, and the cookies are great.  Thanks for this recipe.

These are awsome! I made 1/3 of the recipe and added butterscotch chips and pecans as another reviewer suggested. These are a new favorite cookie, and something that I have never had before! I didn't have cream of tartar, but it was fine without.

These are my new favorite cookies!!  I halved the recipe (used one egg + one yolk, and 2 1/4 cups flour, half of all other ingredients) and added about 2/3 cup of butterscotch chips and 1 tsp salt.  They came out amazing!  Soft and chewy, and just the right amount of sweetness.  Thanks so much for an incredible recipe!  Can't wait to share these with friends!

These cookies are great - crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Only change I made was adding 3/4 tsp. salt. You got to give these a try!!

A good base recipe, but adding butterscotch chips and a little salt makes it a five star recipe.  I scaled the amount down from 120 to 40, so I added about 1/4 tsp. of salt and 1 cup butterscotch chips.  They took about 11 minutes to bake up in my oven and everybody was pleased with them.  Thanks for sharing!

I have tried these cookies 3 different ways.  1st I cooked them exactly like the recipe and they were good but not exceptional.  The second time I added butterscotch chips and melted the butter and they were great.  Today when my daughter and I made them I decided I didn't want to bake cookies for 1/2 the day so I put the batter in a greased 9x13 pan and baked it like brownies with the chips and melted butter, reserved some chips for the top and it was great this way too.  I baked it at 325.  I checked it every 10 mins. after the first 20 mins. with a toothpick and it took around 45-50 mins for it to be done.

Excellent cookie! I followed the recipe exactly but did add in a bag of butterscotch chips.  They baked in about 11 minutes  and looked perfect.  I will definately keep this recipe.

5 Stars because I will keep this recipe! I added a full bag of butterscotch chips and a small box (3.4 oz.) dry butterscotch pudding mix. The pudding just adds a little more sweetness. I melted my butter for 1 min. in micro & my baking time was 16 min. for larger cookies than called for.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I don't like the bag butterscotch chips so I didn't take the reviewers recommendations. Instead, I added pecans and toffee chips. These came out soft and chewy and delicious. If I hadn't added anything I feel that they would have been a bit too plain. You can really do a ton of things with this recipe, I love it!! Thanks

I was looking for a different cookie recipe and found it.  This recipe makes WAY too many cookies.  Recalculate the servings to either 40 or 80 servings.  This way the egg will come out to either 1 or 2 depending on the size of batch.  I made the first half exactly like the recipe.  The other half of the dough I added pecans and butterscotch chips.  I preferred the taste with the added ingredients which is why I gave the original recipe 4 stars.

Phenomenal!!!!!! I am in charge of making the dessert-type food for my SIL-to-be's bridal shower next week.  I picked this b/c it seemed easy and big enough.  I halved the recipe, used 2 eggs like another reviewer, and threw in a bag of butterscotch chips.  I'm making like 5 different kinds of cookies, so no standing there to drop cookies for me; I put it in two 13x9 pans, and baked in a 325' oven for about 25 minutes!  Sooooo good.  I'm hoping they make it until the shower next weekend!

These were good, I guess I didn't read how many the recipe makes, but should have realized from the name BIG BATCH. Like other reviewers suggested I added butterscotch chips to half the recipe and I broke heath bars and put in the remaining half of batter.  the cookies bar far are the best this will be how I make these cookies from now on! Yumm!

Mmmm... nice soft cookies.  I halved the recipe & added butterscotch chips I also melted the margarine.  I would have liked a chewier cookie, I will try real butter next time.  The butterscotch chips are a must!  I will make again.

Well, I was unsure how to rate this. I bake a LOT of cookies, and when I was done mixing them I thought - these are no more that a chocolate chip cookie, without the chips. I added some crushed Werthers and pecans and then divided the batch and added mini semi sweet cho chips to one, butterscotch chips to another, and topped the third with mini milk cho kisses. They all came out nice, but would have been pretty dull without. I rolled them in 1/2 brown sugar/white sugar before baking. Makes a grand bunch of cookies. I also sprayed the cookie sheets due to the Werther candies. They tend to run and stick.

These cookies are incredible. We added a bag of butterscotch chips and about a cup of chopped pecans to the mix for a little something extra. Makes ALOT, and they can't keep their hands off them!

I am SO glad I found this recipe!  These cookies are chewy and have great flavor.  We added some butterscotch chips to a few, but decided we like them best plain.  11 minutes in the oven was just right. Thanks for the recipe!

I divided the recipe by half and added 1 cup of butterscotch chips. Then I rolled them into sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon (all egual parts).  I cooked them for 12 minutes and they were scrumtcious!

I wish I would not have added the butterscotch chips, or maybe there were just too many. Both my husband and I disliked them. On the other hand, I did make the whole batch but halved it in two bowls before adding the morsels. In the other I chopped up some left over mini peanut butter cups from another cookie recipe and since there were not enough, also added some milk chocolate chips. Now THOSE cookies are good. It is not the recipe that was not liked by me but the recommended addition from the reviews. Therefore I am still giving it 5 stars. The cookie wanted to spread a little so after seeing that on the first batch I put the remaining dough in the refrigerator between batches going in and it helped a lot. Thank you for posting. It is perfect just like you said it was.

This was definately a Big Batch of cookies! I added the butterscotch chips and was very greatful that I did because the cookies in my opinion would of been a little flat without them. This recipes seems to me like it could be a very versatile recipe. So i would tell others to try it and be creative! Thank You!

This was a great recipe! I cut the recipe in half since I was making several different varieties and it made about 40 cookies. I don' know how "butterscotch" these would be without the 2 cups of butterscotch chips I added. Great recipe, everyone loved them!

The consistency and texture of these cookies were good.  But I didn't think they had a strong butterscotch taste.  Had I used choc chips instead of butterscotch chips I would have assumed it was a normal choc chip cookie.

So let me tell you about these cookies...they are easy and perfect they come out soft and chewy but not too soft. My mom and I made so many cookies to give a away and after tasting these we decided we would keep these for ourselves. We maybe gave a few away. Next year I will make even more of these...We followed ther recipe to the -T- but we did add butterscotch morsals. REally great recipes!!! YUM YUM YUM!!!

YUM!  My 8 year old calls these the cookies with the "orange things in them" (I add butterscotch chips) and even has chosen them for his birthday treat at school today!  Our preferance is 4C. flour and 2C. quick oats since we like the texture that way!

These are great with milk! I made a third of the recipe and also added about 1/2c pecans & 1/2c butterscotch chips as suggested by others.

These cookies are WOW right out of the oven, my teenager couldn't stay out of them. I bake for the church almost weekly so this is a big batch for sure. I wish I knew if this dough could be made ahead of time and frozen. Thanks for the recipe it will be used many times

Absolutely divine!!!!!  I did add a bag of butterscotch chips to this recipe.  I don't think I have ever eaten a butterscotch cookie without oatmeal.  This has made a place in my cookbook and will be used for a long time.  Everyone just raved over them when I handed them out too.

These are good cookies, not quite what I was looking for, but still great!  They are not a "puffy" cookie, they are flat much like a peanut butter cookie.  The ones I was looking for are fluffier, but this is a great tasting cookie with a nice chewy texture.
