Used Polaner Apricot Fruit Spread, steamed the carrots in the microwave, and used  diagonally-cut organic carrots instead of baby carrots.  I did add a garnish of some chopped pecans which gave it an interesting crunch.  I did not see the need to bake in the oven, the carrots were cooked perfectly and I didn’t want to see them cook to mush, and the sauce was plenty thick.  It’s a bit on the sweet side, but bursting with apricot flavor.  So many carrot recipes are partnered with orange, it’s nice to see the variation with the apricot which really works.  No complaints here, it was easy, everybody liked it, and I will make again.

This was a good side... edible but not spectacular.  I doubt that I would make it again as-is, although I might consider trying it again and modifying some of the ingredients.

Yum!  This looked like a really interesting recipe.  I had to try it!  I used what I had on hand which was a jar of Polaner's All Fruit with Fiber-Apricot, and then threw in unmeasured amounts of golden raisins, currants, and Craisins.  It turned out to be delicious!  Very sweet-maybe a bit too sweet, but that's with my changes.  My husband's first words upon trying it were, "Wow.  It's very good.  Very, very good.  Wow."  Thanks for such a creative recipe!  It's nice to have something different on the table.

I made this dish for our big family dinner on Sunday after church. Everyone enjoyed it. It was definitly different. We talked about using orange marmalade instead of apricot. Thanks!!
