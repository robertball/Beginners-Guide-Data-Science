in our family we add even ammounts of carrots and turnip. The carrots add a bit of sweetness. This is a must for all of our holiday dinners. It has been in our family forever. Thanks for sharing

Glad I found this...I am trying to cut back on potatoes one of my favs, so I tried the mashed turnips and they were just as good as mashed potatoes. I did add a bit of bacon grease in the water, and some margarine while they cooked. They did seem to drain "water" after I mashed them but I just stirred them up again. Very good recipe and will be making it lots more.

I have to admit I was a little leary about mashed turnips ... but they are actually very good.  I think next time I will cut back on the liquid a little.  They turned out a little too wet ~ so maybe a half of a cup instead. Otherwise they are a great addition to our recipe box.  Perfect for a Atkin's friendly meal!!  Thanks so much!!

Cut way back on the milk - or, better yet, stir in heavy cream a little at a time - to avoid ending up with nasty watery turnips. I also like turnips and cauliflower mashed together. Thanks!

Our family's first turnip, a big Koran turnip, I mashed with one red potato and it came out great. Mashed potatoes with slight textural changes. I will make again.

A good, basic recipe. I left out the milk and it was still a bit watery.  Easy, one pot dish.

Not very good...hard to blend and the flavor of turnip gets lost w/ the milk. Sorry, will not make again. But it was worth a try!

Turnips retain a good amount of the water they boil in so I suggest mashing without adding anything, draining the released water and then adding the butter, just a bit of milk, S&P, and I like to also add a pinch of nutmeg.

These were fantastic!  We harvested turnips from our own garden and couldn't figure out what to do with them.  I have made this recipe a few times now.  Some with mashed potatoes some not.  This is definitly going to be a new staple in our dinner plans.

My mom always did something unorthodox with mashed potatoes that I find helpful with mashed turnips, cauliflower etc. She drained the pan of water and then put it back on the stove over low heat and "dried" the potatoes (turnips.) After that she would add the butter and salt, mash it and add milk or sour cream sparingly until the desired consistency was reached. It always cut down on that too watery texture that nobody likes!

This is a good base for many great recipes. I made two variations today. I diced and boiled 8 turnips and a large carrot. Drained in a colander for 15 minutes. I mashed the turnips and carrots with 4 TBS butter. Milk was on hand but was never needed. Then separated 1/3 of the mix and added 1 TSP nutmeg. The other 2/3, I mixed with 1 TSP garlic and 1 TSP basil. I baked both casseroles for 12 minutes covered and 8 minutes uncovered at 375°. Could have just baked 15-20 minutes, without uncovering. Both dishes turned out very different but equally delicious. Slight edge goes to the nutmeg for me.

You can add half and half or cream to lower your carbs instead of using milk... and also too you can make them loaded by adding cheese and bacon.. or use a little less liquid and add some sour cream to them...

Turnips are very watery so be careful what you add into it. I added some butter and salt and it was great.
