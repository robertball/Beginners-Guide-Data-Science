Delicious. People who really love lemon may want to add more zest, but these were absolutely perfect for me. Thanks so much, Kit!

This recipe was surprising.  It had such a refreshingly light taste and I loved all the spices.  Next time I would maybe only add 1/4 T of nutmeg though with more almonds and a splash of milk.  Also, I used vanilla extract instead of brandy.  Yummmmm!

I substituted chopped pecans and cognac for several of the ingredients, and the results were pretty good. Another great recipe from Kit--way to go!

I substituted amaretto liquer for the congac, and found these to be very dry. They're good with tea, though.

These were dry and flavorless.
